“Beneath all that what?” Sherlock asked, increasingly annoyed.
John stroked his thumb along Sherlock’s nape.
“I told you.”
“What was?” Mrs. Hudson asked, keeping her voice just as low. “I’ve seen him get cross plenty of times.”
“You saw me yesterday,” John said, no less enthusiastic as he touched Sherlock’s jaw.
“Perhaps I was self-sabotaging, as well,” Mycroft said.
Sherlock hesitated. Would he? He probably would have suspected Greg of lying when he said that he had rejected Mycroft’s offer to spy on him. And all sorts of information was revealed during pillow talk, or so he had heard. Greg wouldn’t have seemed so trustworthy under those circumstances. Sherlock sagged, exhausted. The anger that had fueled a mad trembling in his muscles abandoned him in a rush.
“I try my best.”
The memory of John’s laugher flashed through his mind.
“It’s obvious. You and John smelled each other, probably reacted in surprise, and Sherlock noticed.”
“This. You know. The relationship.”
John didn’t look convinced. Sherlock had the sudden urge to smooth out his worried frown with his fingers and soothe him with his touch.
“Finish that sentence and this call is over,” Mycroft said.
Grabbing a fresh roll from his kit, he sat on the sofa, scooching toward Sherlock as he placed his ankle on his lap. Sherlock’s breath stoppered for a second at the position and the warm feel of John’s hands. Were all selkie hands this warm? Was their body temperature higher than a human’s? But if they were distinguishable from humans by their vital signs, their existence would be more apparent.
“So, no friends, no.”
A shadow had come over John’s eyes.
“Ready.”
“I like you.”
He crossed his arms over his chest, gaze guarded and uncertain. Why? Sherlock wouldn’t let Mycroft lock him up. He must know that.
“Thank you,” he said. Taking a firmer grasp of his umbrella, he stood up. “I should go.”
“The drugs,” John said, tone somber.
“Oh, doesn’t it now?”
“Bye now.”
“Yeah. Temporary dalliances are okay. Committed relationships, not so much. But it doesn’t matter. Speculating just makes one feel worse, right? You know, maybe our parents aren’t that different. Dad wasn’t supportive of what I wanted, either. It’s probably just wishful thinking to hope that mum would have been. And Harry. The rest of them.”
“I am aware. I have been trying to put it out of my mind, but it’s not so simple.”
“Is that all you had for lunch?”
“Alright. Have a wonderful time, dear.”
Closing his eyes, John pressed himself even closer and nuzzled Sherlock’s face. Now this Sherlock knew how to do. What a thrilling thought that was. Even if he had been interested in snogging, this would have been far more intimate, for he was engaging with John’s culture. Him, a human, acting like a selkie. Had any other human been granted such an honor? It was very well possible, although John assured him that long-term human-selkie unions were nowhere near as frequent as folktales suggested.
Mycroft raised an amused brow.
“No.”
Greg sighed and dropped his head again.
“You weren’t looking for it. I’ve known for years, not that I think he’s noticed. This isn’t my first time meeting non-humans. I know what wolf hair looks like. I couldn’t have been certain about John’s, though, if I hadn’t already figured it out from your story. A seal just popped out of the blue and rescued you. And John showed up right after? Of course he’s a selkie. He’s even the right height.”
“Don’t take it the wrong way. I don’t mean it as an insult. I’m smarter than practically everyone else. It’s just a fact.”
“Don’t worry,” Sherlock said, recuperating a bit from his strop under John’s gentle touch. “I won’t tell him that you secretly think that I’m prettier.”
He looked down at John’s hand, so close to his own. It lied palm upwards, fingers curled, soft and beguiling. John noticed his regard.
Sherlock scoffed. John frowned, but not at Sherlock’s dismissive reply.
Into the computer, he typed the URL for the train company so hard that the sharp clicking of the keys made him wince. He was getting out of here on the first available train. 5:15am? No problem. Normally, he hated the early ones, but there was nothing normal about today. Nothing at all. Why did he have to take this damn case? He should have stayed in London. There was no need to ever leave the city. Just because he’d been missing a bit of countryside and wanted a change of scenery and some inspiration for his music, which hadn’t even worked, anyway, except to draw the attention of impossible beings and their lonely, begging eyes. Some doctor John was to torture Sherlock with the lunacy of his existence. Hadn’t he sworn to do no harm? Well, killing a man was certainly doing harm, but that was beside the point. He had been saving Sherlock in that case, not damning him to never be able to trust his senses or his convictions ever again.
“Maybe a little.”
“I’m not going to crumble at any moment,” he muttered. So what if he was pouting? As if he cared. “I’m not made of glass.”
Sherlock raised his head, eyes widening.
“I’m not scared,” he said, voice almost steady.
“Giant? I’m only 1.8 meters tall.”
John looked down at the pavement, his fingers curling into his palms. He sighed.
“There’s no need to sound so guilty about it. Anyone would have. But you did consider getting in touch when you saw my contact information, didn’t you?”
Their next lunch date—
“Yorick?”
Sherlock dug his heel into a crease between the floorboards. He had been made to suffer too much sentimentality in the last few days. He itched for his violin and a nice cuppa from Mrs. Hudson.
“Please. Doctors treat patients at their offices, not their homes, which you have gone to three times. Why? Who is he? Why are you so interested in him?”
“None of your business.”
Greg looked away for a second, betraying his response. Mycroft raised his hand to his own face, turning away for a second in shame.
"Ah. You're awake, good."
"Oh." said Sherlock, and there was another beat of silence on the other end before he spoke again. "No, it's- I'm fine. I'm staying with Mycroft for the time being, until Baker Street is rebuilt. I haven't really been- still trying to process everything, I suppose."
He headed down the hall so he could make up the guest room's bed with fresh linens and a few blankets from the top of the closet, checking in on Rosie for a second before going to check the tea. He'd at least have a cuppa out if Sherlock wanted it, but if not, that was fine, too.
The other side of the bed remains empty. No more blond curls sprawl across the pillows, and the other side of the closet is a hollow space. He'd given away most of Mary's things a few days ago, after he'd gotten back home and had a spare bit of time to recover from the horrifying experience in Sherrinford. He still kept a few, nestled away to keep for Rosie when she was older, but he himself knew how desperately he needed to let go. Mary no longer lingered around as a figment of his grief-addled brain, so he'd taken it as a sign. He'd felt lighter in the slightest.
"You need to wake up, John." You say, walking over toward me. "You need to open your eyes, do you hear me? Wake. Up."
and it would hurt so
"Of course, Sherlock. Yeah, let me just-" John bent to grab some of Sherlock's bags, then winced as Rosie started to wail from inside the house. "Ah, I've got to go get her sorted, give me a moment. Take a seat on the couch, there's tea in the kitchen if you'd like it."
"My brother, my parents, Molly Hooper, and a select few of the homeless network." Sherlock replied, looking thoroughly put-out by that point. "But you had to believe I was dead, John. You absolutely had to. Moriarty had a sniper trained on you, and he would've killed you unless you saw me jump and you believed I had died. I couldn't- I
We'll die together. Here, with our heartbeats thudding in tandem until they beat their last. You move closer, my eyes shut, and . . .
After settling down in the chair across from Sherlock, John sighed, folding his hands together on the tabletop. Sherlock mirrored his position, almost, hands steepled underneath his chin. They both expected each other to speak first, and that was quickly going to become a problem.
"My bedroom's filled with boxes, I didn't really feel like cleaning it out tonight." Sherlock's shoulders lifted in a shrug. "I've been in the sitting room on the sofa, but even considering that I've been sleeping on more uncomfortable things the past few months, I couldn't really . . . but forget that. I was just seeing to that you were alright."
Sherlock Holmes wasn't ever coming back.
I'm not booting you from my life, alright? Even though I'm certainly going to be cross with you for a long while, I'm not just going to let you walk out of my life all over again. That'd be really stupid of me, and- y'know, Sherlock, at your funeral, I said a few things at your grave. But there was one thing that I asked you for, one thing that I really wanted. I asked you for one more miracle. I asked you to stop being dead. And here you are."
He only got as far as off the dirt before he turned back, hands stuffed in his pockets.
"Let him ride." I demand, my voice loud enough to hear over the endless wailing of the sirens. "He rides with me."
"I wasn't allowed to." Sherlock looked guilty. "Once again, John, I do apologize for what I put you through. You want me out, just say the word. I'll go. You won't hear from me again."
John was already well on his way down the hall, but the creak of the sofa signified that Sherlock was following. He reached inside the guest room to flick on the light, and stood aside so Sherlock could enter.
"There were thirteen scenarios in place, when I went up onto that rooftop." Sherlock began, his voice slow at first. "Each had a specific codeword, and teams were in place for every single one of them. I knew that Moriarty wanted me to die, to finish off his story, so I planned and I predicted. Him killing himself was definitely a setback, but-"
"Hello?" John's voice sounded tentative, even to his own ears, and he could've slapped himself.
John awoke with a hoarse scream, his legs twisted within the confines of his bedsheets, his chest heaving as he panted. It took a minute to calm himself down, to remind himself of his surroundings, to convince himself that everything was alright. He was in his bed, in his bedroom, in the flat on Baker Street. John exhaled heavily, sitting up and running a hand through his sleep-mussed hair. His nightmares had taken that form for months, forced to see Sherlock dying over and over again, but they hadn't been that fully terrifying since the first few weeks after Sherlock's suicide.
Life went on. But no, it didn't, because there was another bump in the road, another hitch in his throat. There was Sherlock Holmes, there would
"I'm sorry." Sherlock was apologizing, again, and John's violent train of thought came to a screeching halt. "I know, John. Things aren't the same between us as they were before, they probably won't be ever again, and I'm accepting that. If you want me out of your life, that's fine. I would understand. I would have told you, you know, if I had the choice. But my brother was very secretive about the whole thing, he didn't want you knowing. Or anyone close to me, for that matter."
But yet. John's life was filled with but yets, far too many for his liking. For example, he himself had a lovely daughter and a spacious house in the suburbs. Things were alright. But yet,
When John came to, he was laid neatly on the sofa in the sitting room, covered with a throw blanket and feeling quite dazed. The last thing he remembered was seeing . . . Sherlock. No, that couldn't be possible, Sherlock was
"Yeah, me too." John felt a bit easier about the entire situation. Sherlock was safe, warm, had a bed to sleep in, wasn't out on the streets trying to drown his memories with whatever he could purchase off a dealer. That was what mattered. "That's, ah- that's good, Sherlock. I'm glad."
good. I'm laughing with you, something I thought I'd never get to do again, and it feels wonderful.
he kept telling himself. He was fine, and he could manage. He reached into his pocket for his keys, unlocking the door with a bit of difficulty, since his arms were both weighed down with grocery bags. He shouted a hello to Mrs. Hudson, never rude, before he made his trek up the stairs.
"Goodnight, John." came Sherlock's voice from somewhere to his right.
be Sherlock Holmes, and nothing about that fact had changed over the course of seven years. The last time he'd seen Sherlock had been when they'd parted ways once they were back in London, Sherlock in one cab and John in the other. He'd not received a call nor text from the detective in the days since, and that slightly worried him. Where was Sherlock, now that there was no Baker Street to return to? Why hadn't he reached out? Was he waiting for John to make the first move, considering they were still on thin ice after what had transpired after Mary's death?
he hated it. Every inch of this life he was struggling to maintain, he despised it to the very core. Not Rosie, never Rosie, but instead the false air of mediocrity that he gave off to all of the neighbors. It wasn't him, it was far from him, and what he wouldn't give to burn the entire place to the ground. John knew how good it would feel, how
“Sorry to startle you Molly.” He said as he stepped inside and kicked the snow off of his shoes.
John nodded, “Yes.” He held his hand out and Sherlock stood up, walking slowly to John and taking his hand, intertwining their fingers together. Sherlock smiled and gave John’s hand a squeeze as they both walked up the stairs.
Sherlock relaxed back in the armchair, resting his right leg over the other as he pulled out his phone, scrolling through Facebook and seeing nothing but posts from his mother and Molly. He rolled his eyes and threw his phone at the sofa and threw his head back and put his hands together.
Sherlock still despises speaking in third but he knows how Rosie’s mind is as a child and wants to help her grasp on to who is around her and what they’re called. Sometimes, every now and then, he’ll speak in baby talk.
Rosie’s giggle was so sweet. Her voice so soft.
Sherlock chuckled as John did, “Wouldn’t have to worry for a last minute sitter either. I’m sure that Mrs. Hudders would be over the moon to have Rosie around. You and Rosie could take my room since it’s bigger and I can take the upstairs.”
“The development of the brain of a toddler.”
This was just the beginning of the brand new life brought to 221B Baker Street.
John sat down in his chair, grabbing the newspaper, “Sounds great.”
He sat up quickly and looked at John, who was now blinking his eyes and sat up confused. Rosie’s wails sounded louder and Sherlock whipped the comforter off of his body and placed his feet on the floor and gave John a shared look before dashing to the staircase after he rounded out the hall.
“You can only look at an unfurnished flat and listen to the contractors for so long before wanting to exit out the window.” Sherlock responds, untying his scarf and hanging it up on the rack and then his coat. “Where’s John?”
Sherlock took multiple steps as he reached the top of the floor and made his way to the room that was barely lit besides the small nightlight in the room. He pushed the door open and saw Rosie sitting on her bed, hugging her knees to her chest as she gripped tightly on her plush bee.
“My dear brother…”
“We just made out like bloody teenagers.” John panted, still catching his breath as he and Sherlock made eye contact and started laughing. “My God…”
Sherlock shrugged, “All of the books have to be replaced. Furniture. Our chairs were taken in and fixed. It smells all too new, but, adjusting is a way of doing things. I requested some precautions to be put in.”
“I-,” Sherlock started before he stopped again, “You’re not angry that your daughter called another man a figure like that?”
“I love you…,” Sherlock slipped the words he used to hold in his head for so long, “John Watson.”
He grabbed two cups and the sugars, heading back towards the room and placed John’s on the table beside him and John gave him his thanks which Sherlock just nodded and went to his laptop at the desk.
Sherlock looked to the side as he saw John walk throw the kitchen entryway, “Ah! John. Just congratulating Molly on the new lover.”
“Can we talk for just a moment?”
“Let’s go get that nasty nappy changed Ro’,” John said to Rosie as he placed a kiss upon her temple before turning around and heading upstairs to their shared room. “Unless you want ole’ Sherlock to do the nasty job.” He scrunched his nose before tickling Rosie’s belly, getting a smile out of her.
John pulled Sherlock’s chin down a little as he stepped closer, “May I?” Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock poked an eye open, “…Hm?”
“You’re making it safer?”
“You’re going to have bad dreams in life, Bee, but you know that me and Daddy are safe. Nan is safe. Molly and everyone else is too.” Sherlock added, “You’re safe. Always will be with me as your father.” Rosie giggled, “Now that’s a beautiful sound.”
“How’d the examining of the finger go?” John asked.
Rosie’s cries were softened down to small sniffles and she laid her head on Sherlock’s shoulder, her thumb held in between her teeth.
“Just arrived moments before you… Note why I was heading out.”
Sherlock looked down. “Oh,” He said. “I just- I just assumed, since-,” Gurgling came from baby monitor that sat on the table. “I can get her since you’re… yeah.” Sherlock’s face was flustered as he stood up and excused himself to tend for the one year old.
“I know, Bee, but I can’t help if you don’t talk. Tell me what happened.”
Sherlock still hadn’t moved but John’s voice broke him from his stare, “Oh, um, sorry.” He apologized, “I’m just…” He rubbed the pads together as he felt John’s stare.
“Probably, she was telling me about it last night at bed time after you left. Her meltdown was because she wanted us to be together.” John responded. He waved his hand in between him and Sherlock. “She wanted us to be together with her.”
John picked Rosie up and kissed her temple, “Hello, my sweet girl.” He shifted her over to his hip, “Did you sleep well?” Rosie nodded and rubbed her eyes before shaking her head side to side really fast and giggling.
There was a nice breeze blowing throughout the apartment as he saw the windows were propped open, letting in the air.
“I didn’t think you’d be back so soon.”
Rosie nodded.
John watched as Sherlock walked down the hallway and heard him open the door to Rosie’s nursery and the door closed again. Sherlock’s flustered face still etched in his mind as he began to think on what Sherlock had said.
Never had she said that word before.
Rosie looked back at Sherlock and then laid her head back on John’s shoulder before pointing at the staircase, “Up Daddy.”
The three of them asleep in each other’s arms.
“Rosamund, calm down. You’re going to make yourself sick.”
“The telly show?”
John sat down on his bed, sitting Rosie beside him, then signaled for Sherlock to sit down too. Sherlock took a spot next to Rosie, “Can Daddy talk to you Sweat Pea?” John asked Rosie, making sure they had eye contact. He was talking calmly to get through to her small growing brain. Rosie rolled her eyes up for a minute before saying yes.
Sherlock explored through his mind palace, looking through to try and remember any sort of time that could just possibly give the young girl the idea to call him that.
Molly smiled, “It’s no problem at all. Bye John.” She glared at Sherlock as she walked out the door.
“Dada!” Rosie babbled as Sherlock placed a kiss on her golden curls before passing her over to John. His demeanor had changed a lot since John had uttered his response to his
John laughed, “Sherlock Holmes, moving his science lab to a different room. I’m actually surprised.”
Sherlock smiled as he kissed Rosie’s head, letting her get comfortable against him.
“Cut it.” John interrupted, “What’s going on. Did something happen with Rosie?”
Sherlock inhaled slowly, “Rosie called me Papa.”
“That’s good.” John smiled, “That’s good…” John grabbed more of the baby clothing that sat in the basket and continued to fold. “Have you gotten what you need to restore everything?”
It worried him that John might get angry since his daughter is referring to another man as a father figure and not just him.
“Sherlock, if you’d have me, I want us to be a family. You, me, and Rosie.”
. It was
Sherlock sighed deeply as he ran both hands through his hair, ruffling his curls before going to his chair and sitting, listening to John talking to Rosie through the baby monitor that was sat on the coffee table. He listened to John making the weird noises to get Rosie to laugh.
He rubbed his middle finger pad against his thumb pad to calm a bit before walking back to the room and consoling the crying child for both his and her benefits.
“You want me too?”
Sherlock opened his mouth a bit before closing, trying to formulate his words, “I love your Daddy, Rosie, and I… I am honored for you to recognize me as a parental figure. I know my words are complex and your mind is growing so you’re not understanding me, but, I would be delighted for you to call me Papa.”
John was truly at a loss for words, “I don’t- All this is kind of a surprise. After everything that had happened, the last thing I would have ever thought was you wanting me back at Baker Street.”
The Detective, The Doctor, and The Bee on 221B Baker Street as a family.
“Yes!” Rosie cheered. “Need Bumbie-,” She pointed at the stuffed bee that was still on her bed.
John looked at Rosie, “You want to sleep with Daddy and Papa tonight?”
“G’night Daddy.” She kissed his cheek, “I love you.” Before Sherlock could say anything, she kissed him on the cheek and then curled up against his chest, “G’night Papa. I love you.”
Sherlock reached inside the pin and picked Rosie up, her body was still thrown backwards as she continued to cry and had shifted all her weight. He held her close to his chest and began to rub and pat her back in a repetitive pattern as he had done and seen John do when she cried.
Rosie had woken them up with squealing as she grabbed both their faces, saying “Daddy” over and over until either one of them got up. Mrs. Hudson had brought them up tea not short before so there was no way she hadn’t seen them.
“Shut up.”
“Rosamund had a small break down when I left the room.” Sherlock responded, still rubbing Rosie’s back. “I just finished an experiment and didn’t… want to get any chemicals on her by chance so I, uh, washed my hands and she completely… lost it.”
The happy giggles and squeals from Rosie caused both Sherlock and John to laugh as they tickled Rosie. She squealed their names in between as her tummy was attacked with tickles. Sherlock could keep this sound in his head forever. He could keep this feeling forever.
They were eating Chinese takeaway from their favorite spot. Rosie was squishing the noodles between her hands but offering the noodles to Sherlock, who accepted them, even though John told him that it was gross but Sherlock said he was just making her happy. They finished eating and drew Rosie a bath.
“Yes, even Daddy gets bad dreams. He was in a war that caused him bad memories but he managed through them. Sometimes, dreams can be so wrong that they leave nasty feelings inside for a while. Sometimes a dream can be recurring, but you just have to be strong and think better things.”
Rosie hasn’t ever say Sherlock, at most, just the first consonants, but she stopped; Sherlock thinking that his name just put too much work for Rosie and he understood.
Molly looked down at her shoes, “Yeah, I do. He’s- oh don’t give me that look, Sherlock.”
“I’m afraid so.”
One thing that all of Baker Street knew by now is that Rosie Watson can CRY when she’s upset. It’s the most heart breaking sound anyone could ever hear. However, the shrill cries are quite piercing and it causes Sherlock to freeze up more.
“Sure?” He answered.
“Good girl Rosie.” John said, “Daddy wants to tell you something REALLY important.” He animated as Rosie looked at him and then to Sherlock, but turned her interest away. “Rosamund.” Rosie looked back, “Sherlock told me you called him Papa today… Can I ask where you learned that word?”
It scared him.
Rosie nodded, “Papa talk. I’m okay.”
John raised an eyebrow and put his paper down, “May I even ask why?”
Tears started to form again as Rosie repeated the words over and over. Her excitement with the word found its way in his mind palace to stay. John had scooted closer and Rosie fell, caught in between them. Sherlock took his fingers and started tickling her belly as John got her feet.
Their lips sealed together and fit perfectly, almost as if it were like a puzzle piece. Soft lips that had waited too long to finally meet but finally got a chance. It was
Rosie hummed, “Daddy getted bad dreams?”
He and Sherlock watched, along with Mrs. Hudson, as Mary spoke to them. She was so incredibly smart, and so incredibly brave. She recounted everything she loved about them and summarized how much they were to her. John hurt seeing Mary on the screen, knowing she did these messages knowing she would die.
John caught himself and gave a small chuckle before trying to stop, a smile still etched on his face, “You, of all people… A man who can tell a person’s whole life story by the scar on their hand, is stumped because you were called Papa?”
Confusion wrote Sherlock’s face as he furrowed his eyebrows, clearly confused on why John was laughing at this subject. “What? Why are you laughing?”
“Baker Street.” John said, pulling the laundry basket towards him, pulling out tiny socks and pairing them together. “How the construction coming along?”
“The look you always make when you know how a guy is going to be.”
John gave a small nod in response to what Sherlock had said, looking at the distress on his two year olds face and then the blank staring Sherlock was doing. He drew his lips back as questions arose in his mind but he decided not to ask. Instead, he rubbed Rosie’s back.
April 2018
They didn’t know how long time had went by until they heard the small voice break through the baby monitor.
“Well…”
“How’s the flat coming?”
“Th-There had biiiig monster, and-and-and it scary.” Rosie animated, “I getted hurt! And- and you and Daddy…” She looked down, holding her hands together as she curled her toes. Her face dropped as she remembered. “I try stop! But it-it-it getted me.” She cried, throwing her head back as tears starting pouring again.
Sherlock couldn’t help but give a small smile at the little girl whose unruly curls were swaying from her pigtails with every movement she made. Rosie mumbled her words which came to nothing clearly coherent but Sherlock still listened as he walked to the kitchen; he was going to wash his hands once more before handling the small Watson.
“Papa.” Rosie said as her bottom lip was quivering. Sherlock hadn’t even fully made it to her little bed before she had stood up and jumped into his arms. Her whole body was shaking with tears as she repeated his name over and over.
Sherlock didn’t realize that John had come back downstairs. He had gotten dressed while he was upstairs into a pair of jeans and a long sleeve. He had also closed the windows but Sherlock was deep in his mind to realize.
Never did Sherlock think he’d be a father; he didn’t even think he could be anyone’s partner.
It seemed that John was in the shower since Sherlock had heard the water running from down the hall. He walked through the door way into the sitting room and saw Rosie’s play pin sat in the middle of the floor with her in it. She was watching the cartoon that was on the telly. As much as Sherlock hated John for letting her small brain absorb the cartoons, he knew it was, sometimes, a pretty decent alternative to a sitter.
“Sherlock-,”
John’s face softened up and broke into a smile, “Oh Sherlock…” He said as he began to laugh.
It stumped the detective on why Rosie was putting him in that sort of stand point of a figure. She is very impressionable at her age so Sherlock played different scenarios that would lead to Rosie slipping and calling him Papa.
“It does?”
Rosie sniffled and wiped her eyes as she coughed into Sherlock’s chest. “Bad dream?”
. It was
There’s no way Rosie actually called him Papa and meant it.
“Were you good for Aunt Molly today?” John asked as Rosie babbled incoherently. He tried to kiss her head but she squirmed out of his arms and to the floor as she crawled over to her toys that were sitting from the earlier hours.
“Why would I?” Sherlock asked, “Rosie’s quite the explorer. I don’t want her getting hurt.” John’s face softened into a smile as he listened to Sherlock. Kind of surprised that Sherlock thought about his goddaughter when looking at the construction of his flat. “You’re doing that face again.”
Sherlock was rummaging through the fridge, pulling out the takeaway from last night’s dinner. He picked at the rice with his chopsticks as John watched him. “Sherlock.”
The way she’d been acting since then was finally making sense to the ‘genius’ detective.
Sherlock felt his heart race as those words processed in his head. In awe of what was actually being said to him. John was okay with Rosie calling him Papa. Rosie wants them. John just said that he loved him.
John wiped the tears from Sherlock’s face away with his thumb and cupped underneath his chin, “Will you have me?”
Rosie stood up on the bed, toppling over a bit but Sherlock caught her as she turned and smiled, squeezing his face in her little hands. She squeeze his head in between her arms as she attempted to give her ‘hugs’ that Molly taught her. “Papa.”
Rosie mumbled a bit, “ ‘ta telly show got Papa.”
Sherlock finally lifted his head up and looked at John, a question lingering in his head. “You’re coming with whenever it’s finished aren’t you?”
Rosie turned her head back as she had heard the footsteps and her eyes widened as she stood up, grinning as wide as she could, showing off her almost-full set of milk white teeth. She started reaching out her arms for Sherlock, trying to get him to get her out of the pin. She started opening and closing her hands, trying to signal Sherlock to her.
“Sherlock.”
Rosie nodded, “Bad! Bad dream!”
“Why would you want me back at Baker Street?” John asked calmly. “It wouldn’t be as the same as it was the times before. I kind of have a child.”
“Daddy!” Rosie squealed, gleefully.
John was the first one to pull away and smiled up at Sherlock. Sherlock still had tears in his eyes, but happy tears. “I love you Sherlock Holmes.”
“It’s just my face?”
Rosie laid her side up against him and whimpered, her breath stifling as Sherlock wiped the tears off her blotchy red face. “Tell Papa what’s wrong.” Sherlock still isn’t used to calling himself Papa, but the feeling makes him feel great.
Sherlock sighed sadly as he pulled Rosie close to him, rubbing her back with the pads of his fingers. He placed a kiss on her head as he let her cry it out. Sending vibrations through her body as he softly drew ‘shhh’, still letting the three year old cry. She’ll stop when she’s ready to.
John had gotten a bit closer to Sherlock now, grabbing a hold of Sherlock’s hand. His thumb rubbing against the top of Sherlock’s hand. “It honestly thrills me that Rosie sees you and is as comfortable with you to relate you to her father.”
Rosie’s voice drew out through the monitor.
“Well Rosie, Sherlock and I had a long discussion.” He looked up at Sherlock and smiled, “and Sherlock wanted to tell you something.”
It was almost as if something inside him had changed.
“Papa.” Rosie’s eyes brightened. She looked at John and then back to Sherlock, “Papa!”
Sherlock smiled as he heard the excitement in Rosie’s little voice. “We’re going to be a family.” John said as he kissed Rosie’s hair. “We already kind of were one but this time… oh, this time this is going to be new.”
Construction came to an end and Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson moved back in, along with the new clothing items and other necessities that were bought by Mycroft. Mrs. Hudson was more than happy to find out that John and Rosie were moving back in.
John looked surprised, “Like what?”
“I think I know that.” Sherlock stated. “I am her godfather after all.”
Sherlock’s eyes opened immediately as he heard Rosie upstairs calling for him and John.
“No, just… googling.” Sherlock drew out.
As John had started packing, with the help of Sherlock, he had taken all of Mary’s clothes and items and placed them in secure totes that would be held safely assured by Mycroft. Always acceptable to achieve if asked, he came along a white package and opened it to reveal another DVD labeled Miss You.
He had moved and apologized, getting up to retrieve a towel as John washed Rosie’s hair.
“What happened?” John asked.
He found comfort in her words.
Sherlock chewed his chicken while John leaned up against the counter. “I assumed you would want to, but even I, the Sherlock Holmes, makes wrong deductions sometimes.”
John looked up at Sherlock, “Bad dream got her, didn’t it?”
question.
Sherlock grabbed her Bee and the three of them headed downstairs. John set Rosie after taking her to the bathroom and she climbed to the middle of the bed. Sherlock and John climbed under the covers and got comfortable. Rosie wiggled around for a few minutes, playing with Sherlock’s fingers and running her hands through John’s hair.
“Anytime Molly has a date, you always go and put doubt in her head.” He responded as he sat down on the sofa. Sherlock rolled his eyes, “Would it hurt just to be nice and happy for her relationship?”
Sherlock rubbed his hands together as he took a deep breath, the moment before still playing in his mind.
John walked up to both of them, kissing Molly on the cheek. “Thank you for caring for Rosie today.”
Sherlock stood up with Rosie, still holding her in his arms as he walked to the window. He drew back the curtains, letting the room be filled with the moonlight. He held her like he used to when she was littler, even though she’s bigger now and doesn’t fit the way she used to. He would do this every time he tended to her during the night once she and John had moved back in.
“Daddy.” Rosie spoke, words a little muffled by her thumb. She reached out to him and Sherlock handed her over and John took Rosie into his arms.
John walked towards the both as Rosie reached out for him. Sherlock took the sippy, which was warm, from John as he grabbed Rosie. Rosie gave him a hug as he held her.
John smiled, “Well she sure does love her Uncle Shezza.” He jabbed at the nickname that Wiggins had spoken a few years back. “Now she can actually stay with him and me not fear for her life.”
“What look?”
“Do you think she remembers the other night…”
Construction on 221B would be coming to an end by the middle of February since Mycroft had his team send an exclusive team to repair the blown up flat due to the unwelcoming revisit of the third Holmes sibling, Eurus, that January morning.
“I really do.”
“It’s fine if you don’t,” John added, “But, that’s out there. I have for a while. I concealed it for years. I loved you. You left. I found Mary and I love her, always will. You come back. She gives me Rosie and I love Rosie. Mary’s gone and I still love her, but I’ve moved on. That night, a year ago, whenever I broke down after talking to her. She- She told me to get on with it.” He felt his chest become tight, “You bring me and Rosie back and care for us like no other would. 221B is home. You love Rosie. I love you for loving Rosie, God knows she’s loved, but I love you.”
"John. Welcome home." Even the voice of this man, a deep silken sound, was oh-so familiar, a noise that played over and over in John's head, a melody John had thought he'd heard for the final time.
Sherlock was just sitting there, saying nothing at all, and John had every notion to tip the scalding-hot tea over that stupid head of his and-
It's just you and me here, running down a dark alleyway, our breathing harsh and in tandem. That's how it's always been, really, just me and you. Well, except when it's me and a woman, and sometimes, you show up there, and it's awkward. If I invite her over, you start deducing her the moment she walks into the flat, and most of the time, she ends up leaving. I should be mad at you. I am, sometimes, but most of the time, I pretend. I know she wouldn't be as
The response had been almost immediate, was that a good sign? Had to be, considering Sherlock had replied at all. John was almost sloppy in his attempt to fire off a reply.
was his gun? But as the door opened completely, John stopped in his frantic scrambling. Sherlock's tall figure stood in the doorway, his face eclipsed into shadow by the darkness of the landing.
Okay, we'll talk. I'm going to put the kettle on for tea." John said, trying to keep his voice steady before whirling off into the kitchen.
"I'm a doctor, let me come through. Let me come through, please." John desperately pleaded, pushing the investigators and such aside. "No, he's my friend. He's my friend. Please."
"Mm? Oh, yeah, but it's nothing. I'm alright now." John said shakily, and perhaps if he said it enough, he would believe it. "I thought you'd be asleep by now, you must've had a long journey back here from . . . wherever it was that you've been hiding for the past two years."
You look like you've gotten a fright, and yes, I suppose seeing me here on the ground would've done that to you. But I've never seen your emotions this clear on your face before, so
Sherlock couldn't even do it for himself? Nothing had changed, he was glad to observe. Once done, John settled back into his bed, listening to the sounds of Sherlock thrashing about on the mattress until he was comfortable. He couldn't see Sherlock, not in the darkness of the bedroom, but the mere knowing that he was there soothed John, just the tiniest bit.
"Sherlock,
who's failing to keep up the pace. Maybe
"I'd die before I let anything happen to you, John." Your voice is distant, and I didn't see your lips move.
You look slightly hesitant, but you nod anyways, grabbing your coat and shoes before walking barefoot out into the hallway. I watch you go, but I am not sad. I know you'll do everything as quickly as possible so you can get back here, and that's fine with me.
John felt like he was going to pass out again, and he mutely felt Sherlock's hand clamp to his shoulder to steady him. "You . . . you're . . ."
I can hear the sofa creaking now, so you're probably getting up, or at least shifting. But I hear the sound of your bare feet hitting the linoleum, so it must be the former.
John's door began to creak open at that very moment, and John scrambled for some sort of weapon. His gun,
Sherlock, in that time span, had gone to his bedroom and brought back his sheets and his duvet, and he silently handed them to John to put onto the mattress. John rolled his eyes, shaking his head as he kneeled to set up the bed.
A sofa, a rather uncomfortable-looking one at that. Your bare feet are pushed up against one of the armrests, and your head lies on the other, arms pillowed underneath your head as you sleep. You're using your coat as a sort of blanket, far too tall for the sofa, but making yourself fit anyways.
', hoping you didn't notice.
There was the sound of fabric shifting from behind him, and the sound of a wooden chair screeching outward from the kitchen table closely following it. Sherlock was most likely settling at the table instead, though for what reason, John didn't know. The piercing whistle of the kettle brought John back to the present time, and he was quick to pour out two mugs of tea, carrying them over to the table and setting them down with a clunk. The sugar bowl was set down as well, in case either of them wanted to add some to their tea.
"No." the answer came so quick that John hardly realized he'd said it in the first place. "
"You wouldn't be. Look, you don't have to accept, I just thought I'd offer. I have a guest room, so you wouldn't be forced to sleep on the sofa or anything like that."
I hope you're right, I really do. I want to go on more adventures with you, I want to feel the adrenaline in my veins. I want our quiet mornings on Baker Street, our tired nights in the living room. I want your violin playing, and I want your severed body parts in the fridge. I want everything, so
"Well, Mrs. Tawney, it looks like your daughter's just fine. Just a mild bout of the flu, should clear itself up in a few days time." John Watson scratched out a prescription onto his pad, then tore it off and handed it to the woman sitting on the other side of his desk. "But, do give her this medicine, it'll help to speed up the process."
"What about afterward, Sherlock? What about then, when it was hours after, and I was safe?" John sounded extremely hurt, which he most certainly was. "You could've contacted me."

You frown, your nose crinkling. But then you laugh, a small smile appearing on your face, and I breathe out another exhale.
"But I'm alright." I said firmly, and you nodded, so I allowed myself to relax. "That's good. That's . . .
It was me. I had gotten shot, I had gotten hurt. I hadn't been quick enough, I hadn't been able to keep up, and now look what's happened. The gunman is running away now, not wanting to get caught at the scene. I can hear his footsteps, hurried, as he skids on his heels and turns the other way.

It takes me a moment to process this information, and I'm stunned. My heart had stopped in the operating room? Good
Someone's pinched my arm. Oh, it's you, and you have an urgent look on your face. You were trying to get my attention, trying to make sure I didn't shut my eyes by accident. I understand. I've been in your position before, Sherlock, I know the drill.
"What the
"Are you sure, John?" Sherlock slowly asked, his tone incredulous. "I wouldn't want to be a bother."
John's heart felt like it was going to pound right out of his chest, taking deep breaths through his nose in an attempt to calm his already-jittery nerves. His hands shook as he took the kettle from the cupboard, setting it on the stovetop before pouring in some water to let boil. He could practically
"Fine. Perfectly fine." Since when did Sherlock even care? But considering Sherlock hadn't cared to leave his company today, even complaining at the suggestion of John going out to fetch the Chinese, perhaps he just wanted some familiar faces after being away for so long. "If you want, you can sleep in here tonight. I think I've got a pump-up mattress. Or, you could take it out to the sitting room, if you wanted to."
The sound of a violin lovingly being played.
That had been his last appointment for the day, luckily, and now it was time to head back to the mundaneness of Baker Street. Working at a doctor's office and diagnosing other people's problems helped him to forget his own, although he was always painstakingly reminded of what he had to go home to at the end of the day. It had been two years,
Sherlock was dead, and John could see it. Pushing past the people crowded around the detective's body, his mouth dropped open in horror, his heart almost coming to a stop. Blood stained the sidewalk around Sherlock's curly-haired head, his limbs at all odd angles, and as John crouched to press his fingers to the inside of Sherlock's wrist, there was no pulse. Sherlock really was dead, there was no coming back this time, and John's heart began to ache.
Molly snickered, poking her head out again and giving him a cheeky grin, "You're irresistible, it seems."
class,” John glanced at his ceiling in mock exhaustion before turning back to the lens, “You know what that means don’t you? That means, mates, that everyone is given parts, roles, characters, and that, in itself, is a bloody ordeal.”
“Little bee."
Before he could get the words out, Molly was skipping up to them, eyes bright and smile wide, her voice bubbly and giggly and all-round so very happy, John was sure she’d explode any moment now.
: aw John thank you, I’m okay but we need the details!
Sherlock stared at him, features widening in horror and frown stretching across his expression as he leaned forwards, gawking at John almost amusingly, “The floor? Don’t be absurd, John.”
And Sherlock hated himself for keeping quiet, hated that he couldn’t just ask, couldn’t just say it — but the idea that perhaps he’d possibly be a nuisance, possibly be unwelcome, was too much to risk. So, he’d go home, and he wouldn’t complain.
“The kind of music he plays on that ancient violin is the kind of music my granddad puts on for his afternoon naps,” Sholto scoffed, shrugging his shoulders and leaning back in his seat, “Boring.”
It was so hard to believe, when the sun was shining over its poor homes and people, just how dangerous District 12 became in the wintertime. He remembered tugging his jacket tighter around himself as he hiked back home after a discretely unsuccessful trip to the woods, a dreadfully cold wind caressing his cheeks and hugging tightly to his weak bones. He remembered thinking he wouldn't be strong enough to make it back, back to his mother, back to Mycroft, no matter how much he hated him, or back to Redbeard. But somehow he did, and his mother yelled at him for ten minutes straight, threw an orange blanket at him, and made him some soup with the few herbs and vegetables they had left.
“You were supposed to!”
Honestly, you needn't forgive me because even I don't forgive me. I've started classes again at University and unfortunately I'm located in Florida so I was hit quite terribly by hurricane Irma.
Sherlock nodded and rolled his eyes, “And then how he got over it the second he saw another just a slight bit prettier?”
Okay, it's here. I told you I wasn't giving up on this bad boy!
Sherlock blinked, “I’m sorry?”
Sherlock blinked and then looked down once more, shaking his head and scoffing sharply, "It was simply the honest truth. I quite enjoy them."

John felt himself blush and he playfully shoved her off, shaking his head at the sappiness of it all and looking away, “Shut up, you. He might reject me.”
John felt as though he were being torn in several different directions.
“Good on you, mate,” Lestrade scoffed toward Sherlock, appreciation in the amused smile atop his features, before he turned back to Molly with pink cheeks and the very same smile turned into a look purely
He inhaled sharply and shut his eyes, shaking his head at his own faulty discretion and turned around, taking the corner cautiously and swallowing thickly as his uncle came into view, sprawled out on the grey couch in a half buttoned dress shirt and unzipped black trousers.
It was more than a hobby - making people smile, laugh, giggle; it had become more of a mission, something he pursued with great determination, something he never wanted to put an end to.
“Well, people talk to amuse themselves,” John began, jolting Sherlock from his thoughts, “and for some reason, talking complete shite about a person is funny.”
“— fucking hell —“

Sherlock scoffed, “People do little else.”
John scoffed and shoved her hands away, groaning at her pleased expression before he slammed his head against the steering wheel and remained there, hunched over, eyes shut tight, body anxious and unsteady.

Swallowing, he turned his attention back to the lecture, only to be distracted once again as, predictably, Greg texted him back.
Sherlock merely sat still – glued to his place there, in his uncomfortable chair, his elbows digging into the wooden surface of his desk, his mind whirling with information he wasn’t sure he’d be able to contain for much longer.

Sherlock nodded.

He glanced over his shoulder with one swift turn of his head and took note of Lestrade’s worried expression and the angry faces of Sholto and Moran just behind him.
“Boyfriend forget to get you off this morning?” Sally smirked, leaning back in her seat with an arched brow, cocky and proud, as though teasing Sherlock, of whom she so annoyingly knew to be a, quite simply, and extremely, virgin

A sharp jab to his stomach sent his eyes flying open and his entire body flinging upwards in shock. He came face to face with the amused expression of his older sister, her caramel brown curls thrown up into a messy bun and her entire figure clad in her green work uniform. John sighed, mostly to get his heartbeat back to a normal rhythm, and took out the headphones from his ears, glaring at his sibling for interrupting and letting out a sharp huff, "You scared the shit out of me."
John whirled back around to face her, eyes wide and brows raised to his hairline, “

He took a sip of his tea, observing John with vivid fascination, watching as his tanned fingers tumbled over keyboard keys, the way the screen illuminated across the shine of his eyes, the way his hair fell just slightly against the top of his forehead, blonde and simple, yet entirely intricate in its own way — or, at least, how Sherlock saw it.
Scoffing to himself, he glanced down at his mobile and tapped the screen, boosting it to life and revealing his text messages. There, before him, portrayed in glowing letters on his phone’s screen, was the contact name
The first thing the man did was approach the decanter, fill his empty class, and then take a rather large sip, as though he’d been desperate to quench his thirst. The second thing he did was turn to face the two of them, his tributes, his students, the two teenagers he would have to teach his ways and then watch helplessly as they died on the battlefield. Sherlock couldn’t even imagine how they looked – surely, not promising at all.
He was everywhere. Sherlock had gotten home, strode past his uncle — thankfully dead to the world with his eyes shut on the living room sofa — and gone straight up to his room, only to have his thoughts vandalized, bombarded, harassed. He looked at his chemistry set and thought of John, that bright smile, those warm cheeks, joking with him, grinning at him, being
I'm so very excited for this story to grow and delve deeper into the plot.
“And we could always do something different, like a challenge video or—“
Sherlock let himself drift, flying, the ballet studio’s air cold against the turn and pull of his legs and arms, the bottom of his toes throbbing a bit with every movement of his feet, pink shoes nearly shimmering with their satin delicacy. He reminded himself of how very surreal his thoughts were becoming — these pestering notions that John would someday kiss
“Fine,” Sherlock snapped, and pulled his arm from John’s grip. He then glanced at the boy, watching as his eyes dropped to his slightly swollen bottom lip, his face creasing with a hint of worry before it softened yet again and fixed itself on Sherlock’s tense features, the way he was stood, angled away, guarded and closed-off.
“Sorry?” Sherlock asked, a frown in place.

He lifted his head and ran a hand through his curls, grabbing for his phone and glancing at the screen, spotting his missed messages and clicking on John’s contact hurriedly, as though, in any moment, they may disappear.

“Did you have fun?”
“Where’d you get off to?” He teased before pulling back and snacking on the few remains left on his tray.

Sherlock winced and looked down at his feet once more. His father's favorite as well. Siger and he had shared a number of things - hobbies, habits, taste in women. They had been close. And then Sherlock's father had died and their special evenings of sitting beside the fire, drinking half a glass had turned into Siger sitting alone, downing the entire bottle.

“My clothes may be a little baggy on you,” John stated, his eyes dropping over Sherlock’s thin frame, and the brunette quickly wrapped his arms around him self insecurely, ducking his head and swallowing, the idea of putting John’s clothing on now feeling just a bit overwhelming.
“So,” John smirked, reaching for his carton of milk and folding it open, “I have a question.”

Sherlock swallowed as he watched the last of his family leave him.
He collapsed to the ground, landing on his knees with bruising force and hugging his arms around his chest, placing his forehead to the floor of the ballet studio, and breathing shakily inward. He felt his teeth grinding, his eyes fluttering shut, his heart thumping unsteadily, his legs trembling with exhaustion, his ribs protesting in their already fragile state, and his mind — his
Sherlock jolted a bit in surprise before turning to fully face John and smirking a bit, stance shy and timid, eyes drifting to the silver metal block on wheels and back to John, as though thinking of a way to respond. John spared him the worry.

He could hear the dinging of silverware and plates just outside his door; he could hear the faint mumbles of a consistent conversation, and the distinct sound of Molly’s mousy voice. They would be expecting him. He couldn’t run off into the woods with his dog and his arrows.
Sherlock looked down at his hands, clasped tightly around his mug, knuckles whitening, and hands warming against the heat of the hot beverage, “I really don’t —“
“Enjoying the party so far?” Molly yelled over the music, her grin contagious, her hands resting in front of her with all the aura of an overly excited toddler.
John blinked down at the words on his screen before glancing up and over at Sherlock, of whom was blankly staring at the book in front of him, phone lying still against his desk. The rugby captain felt a small smirk tug at the side of his mouth, and he held back a chuckle at Sherlock’s sudden in-depth diagnosis. When he turned back to his mobile, he caught Molly gazing at him with bright-eyed curiosity, a soft grin lining her features as she looked between John and Sherlock almost knowingly.
“No, no, I’m bloody serious,” She snapped, and he instantly turned back to face her again, taking in the solidarity of her expression, her lips drawn in a thin, hard line, her eyes flashing some sort of warning his way as he blinked blankly and listened whilst she continued, “because whoever this person is, they sound pretty damn important.”

“Since when have you cared about what other people think?” The rugby captain asked in return, his brows furrowed in honest wonderment, his hands gripping just a bit tighter to the straps of his backpack.

He huffed and glanced at his phone, pointedly ignoring the unread messages and checking the time. He sighed, nodding once and grabbing his notebook, shoving the old thing into his black backpack and hoisting it over his shoulder, before slipping over to the opposite corner of his barren bedroom and grabbing his pre-packed duffle bag. He’d call Ms. Hudson on his way to school and see if he could reserve the studio for an hour or two - he could do this. Since when did he care so heavily about what John Watson thought of his videos? Before yesterday, he hadn't even known he watched them. So, what did it matter? He had 4,909 other subscribers who were waiting for something new, another video to watch, another composition to listen to.
