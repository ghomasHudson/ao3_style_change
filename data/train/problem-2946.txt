Castiel grabbed his chin and forced him to look at Cas. The black eye was waning a bit at least. The cast was there to stay, however. Dean adverted his eyes. Cas chased his adverted gaze. His blue eyes were so pretty. In fact they were too pretty for Dean to look at. He didn’t deserve it. He didn’t deserve anything, not even pain. It should’ve been him. It was him who should’ve been taken, not Sam.
Castiel turned his head and looked at the field before him. He held his hand up, not looking at it and Sam studied him. He got the same ethereal feeling again and if he didn’t know better, he could swear that there was magic swirling around that man.
. He croaked into Castiel’s direction but the man wasn’t looking at him. He was afraid. Afraid of Castiel and afraid of The Father. He wanted it to be over. He never wanted to come here. Why was nobody else here? Did they all sleep on their ears?
They don’t get attacked when they enter. Maybe they’re not a threat to that thing. The barn has numerous holes in the ceiling so at least a little light is shining through. They cautiously walk further in. Dean is expecting an attack any second and the longer time goes on, the more anxious he gets. He just doesn’t want the monster to jump out of the dark and attack Sam. What would he tell Eileen? Dean is still crap at Sign Language.
That motherfucker even did the puppy-eyes. They had worked so many times, Dean couldn’t even count. But not this time. Not about this.
“I’m so sorry for everything I’ve put you through,” Dean says and Castiel tries to turn in Dean’s arms.
They crept closer and they paid close attention to what they were stepping on. Well, Castiel did at least because Dean couldn’t tear his gaze from his brother. There was a hole in the roof right above him. It engulfed him in light and Dean was too worried to think that they might’ve been set up.
“Yeah,” Sam said while being busy on his phone. “I’m looking if I can find some blueprints. Unless you have a better idea Dean?”
It didn’t move at first. There was a hole now where there always used to be The Door. Whatever lay behind the opening was darker than its own room. Was this the outside word? It lowered its hand and took its first shaky steps beyond its own walls.
He wonders where the guy has gone. Would he only ever appear again if Dean lost that stone? And would Dean be willing to try this out?
“I have some in the back, but I don’t know if I should hang them up. It’s gonna be a few hours still until official opening, you know?”
He couldn’t think about the possibility of Sam being dead. The thought alone brought him to his knees. What would he do? Maybe it was good that he brought the gun, after all.
Sam laughs and shoves at him. It feels good. Life has to go on. He’s going to be okay. He looks to Eileen who’s making a small
And she was right. He blames himself for it. He thinks that maybe she left because she’s met someone else. That she’s met someone who’s better than him. He knows that she’s said that she didn’t, but – what if? What if she met some guy called Darren who’s just better than him?
I always wanted to make you feel safe. I always wanted to be the guy you could trust in. I wanted you to call me, I wanted you to need me. I
“We barely made it to his car before he ripped my clothes off and shoved me into the backseat. He wanted to be on top, of course, but I didn’t let him.”
The place across from Dean had stood empty for a while. It seems like there’s a new tenant. Dean’s never had much to do with his neighbours, but maybe this one will be different. After all, why not try?
Dean looks up at the sky and extends his hand towards it. “I can see them so clearly, but I’ll never be able to reach them. They’re always going to be a far-away dream that I’ll never get to hold.”
“Do you remember telling me about the bees in the garden? Your eyes light up then, and I got scared. I got scared because you had changed without me being there. And I realised that you didn’t
“But his daughter talked to me. She wanted to thank you. Even if it was just for a short while, you gave Susie her father back.”
. He couldn’t pinpoint it though. The sense of familiarity only got stronger the closer he got. Something... something... oh.
With the TV running in the background, in his shitty apartment, in worn-out clothes, with a dog sleeping in her bed, kissing Castiel.
“Want,” Castiel keeps on saying before he hacks up an ugly cough. Dean cries and rushes over to him.
Castiel nodded and put it into the registry. He had learned that people didn’t like it if he was too slow. Customers had complained to Nora before and he’d been so embarrassed. She had told him
You look down and you see Jack’s head. Right. You remember. The wheelchair. It seems like you had a panic attack. You hope that Jack didn’t see. You feel like a failure for breaking down like that. And poor Sam, who had to endure all of that. Before you go, you need to apologise to him. You dread it already. Maybe you should write a letter. That would save you some embarrassment, no?
Dean drops his head forward slowly until he comes to rest on the man’s shoulder. He doesn’t know why he’s allowed to do this. But it’s nice, it’s so nice.
“Last couple days actually. Yesterday was the worst; he wouldn’t even get out of bed. The day before that, he spent almost all day puking into the toilet. But he’s getting better now, I think. It’s just – I know that he’s sick. I know that these days happen and that they’ll happen again, it just – it just fucking scares me, y’know? Knowing that there’s nothing I can do, no spell to find to cure him or anything – it just makes me feel so helpless.”
Dean cut him loose and then touched his body again. It felt so nice. It had never felt so nice before.
Castiel was oddly composed but then again; Castiel always did what needed to be done. It didn’t mean that Dean could. He was shaking and Castiel squeezed his hand tighter. This wasn’t how it was supposed to end. It was supposed to end with the three of them together. Him, Sam and Cas. Team Free Will.
“Is Edgar okay with you staying away for so long?” Sam asked one time and Castiel just shrugged. “He has enough food and water for a day. If he chooses to stuff himself then I can’t help him.” And that had been that.
Days and nights were just words It had heard others use. Inside here, the light never changed. Nothing ever changed. Although that wasn’t the truth, It supposed. Sometimes the people would change. Old ones would disappear and be replaced by new ones. It wondered if they had gotten a death. It wasn’t sure what
magic. I always thought that flowers want to make people happy. They can’t do that if they’re dead. They’re alive, you know? They just want to make people happy. Do you want a flower?”
me to fix you. I realised that you could help yourself. And I came to understand that all I could do was to help you when you’d fall down.”
The man frowned in irritation as Rowena pushed Sam out of the shop. “Rowena,” Sam started, before she cut him off.
“Dean, it’s fine. Don’t worry. I would have been more insistent if I had known when your work starts, so I need to apologise.”
Dean was grumbling a bit. They were all packed into his Baby, him and Sam in the front seat and Cas and Rowena in the back. Castiel had insisted on bringing that godforsaken bird with him. “I can’t just leave him alone for days, Dean!”
needed you! I’ve been just too nice to let you stay all this time, you hear me? But this ends here, alright? It’s over, Castiel. If you come back, I will personally get rid of you. You don’t deserve anything, Castiel and I hope your asshole angel brothers exile you to the furthest desert and let you rot there in all eternity. I’m done with you. And now please excuse me while I try to save the world you want to see burn.”
They snuggled on the bed, munching away at the rest of their pizza. Edgar had tried to beg for some – even going so far as to attack the crust – but ultimately, Castiel had managed to shoo the bird back into his cage.
So he smiled. Not his cocky, charming grin, no. Castiel wouldn’t want that. Dean couldn’t stop the tears, but he smiled. Castiel smiled back and he was shining. Dean closed the lid and he kept smiling and the very last moment.
A long time ago, he believed that all monsters were evil. But he’d been wrong. They were also just trying to survive. If they were good, they got to live. And if they were bad, they got dead. If one would look at it from this angle, it wouldn’t be that complicated at all.
What if the fence couldn’t be disabled? And even if Edgar accomplished that, they’d still have to climb it and Dean wasn’t sure if he’d be up for that. Damn it. Why did this have to happen? Why did Dad have to be a part of that group? It wasn’t fair. He had wanted to get revenge on them for what they did to Sam, but now that was the furthest thing on his mind.
“I’m sorry I’ve been neglecting you, girl,” he says and Miracle huffs. She looks at him expectantly. Dean laughs.
Castiel shakes his head. “Not... not anymore. I. I fix. I. Take. I...,” he closes his eyes in strain. “It’s gone now. They. Would. They would not have. Noticed. It’s small. But I. I took it.” His voice sounds like it pains him greatly. He slumps in his chair a bit but holds Maria tight.
And when he does, Cas’ll be there and he’ll be worried and hug him and Dean’ll hug him back and everything will be okay again.
Sam pointed to the street they were on. Edgar nodded and looked at it very intensively. He began walking all across the map and they all decided not to pay him any further mind.
Castiel smiled and damn, wasn’t that a sight for sore eyes. When he smiled, his whole face lit up. His nose would scrunch and he’d get wrinkles on the side of his eyes. And don’t
. He hadn’t even known such a thing existed. “You like them?” Edgar asked and Castiel nodded enthusiastically. “They are
Castiel pushed Dean back into the seat.   Dean’s jeans were very constricting and he wished he could open the zipper at least. He nodded and tried to open the buttons on Castiel’s shirt. The man didn’t stop him, simply observed him with dark eyes and Dean took that as permission for licking Cas’ nipple. Fuck, he wanted to throw Castiel into the backseat and get him naked and do so, so many things to him.
Castiel blinked and then his eyes grew wide, jumping quickly to Sam’s side, all excited. “You mean I can use magic?! Can I? Please?”
Castiel smiles at Dean. “Because balloons make everything better. We should’ve gotten glitter, too, you know? We’ll help, Dean.”
“The soul,” Jack starts, “will help. But Dean, you have to understand that when Castiel made it out of the Empty, he took death with him. It’s not going to let him go. The – the sheer might it must’ve taken him to survive as long as he did, I...”
Dean leaned over and kissed his man’s cheek. “That ain’t gonna happen, Cas. Dude, I had a killer orgasm just from you talking to me. And hey, you haven’t heard that from me, but – intimacy ain’t all about sex. It’s about laying the cards on the table, telling people how you feel, what you want. I can fuck everyone I want, you know, but opening up to them? Nah, that’s not gonna happen. Cas, if anyone ever broke up with you just ‘cause you didn’t wanna have sex, then they were stupid.”
grasp what has been said, but then he couldn’t help the smile on his face. He didn’t want to, either.
Something in the tone of his voice sounded sad. Edgar looked up at him, tilting his head. He never liked it when he heard that tone. But he also knew better than to ask. Castiel wouldn’t tell him. He wished he could help.
Edgar flew back to his designated spot and snuggled back into himself. “Yes. I was wondering if you’d accompany me? Normally, I’d ask Rowena but she’s busy today. I need to practice magic and I kind of want someone to watch, you know?”
“You’ve let the devil possess you, all in the desperate effort to save that mud-monkey. Tell me why he deserves it. Tell me why I shouldn’t just get rid of both of them.”
“The purest being in the universe loves me,” Dean says. “You should’ve seen him smile, Miracle. You wouldn’t love me so much if you’d ever see him smile. I should’ve made him smile more.”
“Really? You really think it’s okay? And – and don’t worry, you can use my penis to pleasure yourself. I won’t mind.”
You loved me, you believed in me, you supported me when I didn’t deserve it. You explained the world to me; and
They decide that Cas would stay at Dean’s apartment. Sam had been debating if Cas shouldn’t maybe stay with him and Eileen – after all they had a whole house. But they’d be having a baby pretty soon. Dean was able to devote himself to Cas entirely. And most importantly, Dean doesn’t want to stay away from Cas for any amount of time. He’s utterly convinced that Cas reacted to his voice in the car. Yes, maybe it had been just a coincidence but Dean needs to believe that there is more to it. Cas loves him. He loves Cas.
Dean stood up again and squared his shoulders. He smiled at his mother and gave her a wink. He hoped she’d wish him luck because hell knows he’d need it. He turned away to the path and made his way back to the entrance. There weren’t any other people here today – come to think of it, he hadn’t seen anyone tending to the graves. It was probably the rain. The rain was usually the culprit.
There was too much in Dean’s head. Sam died. And then he didn’t. And then Cas died. And then he didn’t.
Honestly, he hadn’t been expecting that. So he jumped and wildly swung after that animal. He was hoping to hit him and just fling him at the wall. He could explain it to Cas later as a tragic accident and they could have a funeral or whatever.
“Go on a date with him,” Sam says, “just to see what it’s like. If you don’t like it, then stop it, yeah? But give him a chance, at least. He’s not a creeper, right?”
“I care about you so much. I love you, Dean, don’t you doubt that. But love changes, you know? I don’t love you any less than I loved you a month ago. But it’s different now. And I’m going to move on.
“I wanted to give it to Dean so he could have something of Sam’s but obviously I decided against it. Here you go. Do you want a flower crown too? I could make you one. I mean,” he looked at his hand, “it would take a while, but I could.”
Castiel tilted his head like a bird and stepped a bit forward. He didn’t let go of Dean’s hand, and Dean really liked that. He reached out with his hand, but didn’t touch the car; he just sort of hovered over it. “It looks really nice. You must take good care of it.”
Sam stared at Rowena. He knew what she was talking about, of course. There was something called a “magic-transfer.” Castiel blinked, and Sam turned to explain for him and Dean,
Castiel poked the wick and tilted his head. “Light it,” he whispered quietly to himself. He stepped away from the candle and turned back to them. Sam just watched him. He wasn’t sure what he was waiting for, but nevertheless, he was waiting for it.
harvest the magic out of mages without harming them but it needs to be done in small doses to avoid killing them. And purely by the sheer size of product that flooded the drug market I’m guessing that they didn’t take any care. They’ve killed millions after the first month. It took close to two years to find their base of operation and shut them down. And in the aftermath, more people died of course. Luckily it never happened again. They tried to figure out how to prevent something like this happening again, but as far as I can tell they still don’t have a clue. They seem to take missing mages a bit more serious nowadays but even then it’s not exactly a solid countermeasure.”
beautiful.” The man clapped him on the shoulder. “How say you, boy, you get your own flowers you have to look after. You can’t take care of a life with magic, but with heart.”
being confoundedly, almost endearingly boneheaded and blunt, and sort of helpless in the face of the human drama the poor sap had found himself plunged into against his will. Since Cas wasn’t hurting Dean, and had even gone to some lengths to protect him, Sam was slowly making his peace with this crazy state of affairs, a bit like the southwest city quarter around him. He had not yet re-conquered his calm and his routine, but he was pretending everything was
Dean’s torn on this, as with a lot of things coming from his dad. An adult doesn’t like to feel he’s still being schooled by the old man, but on the other hand, it’s been years since he got to spend time with his brother like this, outside of Sunday meals. Deep down, Dean’s delighted that Sam got put on this expedition with him-
“I suppose that is an excellent place to begin,” Rowena concurrs smoothly as she gets to her feet, all poise and polished nails. “Let me see it, then.”
... Castiel did not know how he’d injured Rufus, but he was now certain he was going to find out, along with how mad Dean was this time. He’d not looked at Castiel once since they’d left the Harvelles, so ‘very mad’, certainly. Castiel felt a sinking feeling in his being, a smudgy sense of depression at the thought that this was what was going to be between them from now on; every attempt to breach the distance only creating a greater rift, more resentment and anger... Something had changed between them the other day, when they’d argued, or maybe it was within Castiel that something had changed. He hadn’t really cared when Dean was angry with him before, it had merely been an impediment to his mission, a problem to which he would search for a solution. The fear of failure had been the motivator there. Failure still hovered over him, but the fact that Dean couldn’t even stand to look at him seemed to take up all the room in his thoughts, rather than concern over his duty to his Father.
he’s right. He remembers the terrible glory of the first nephilim he ever encountered, burning the earth to ash beneath his feet. Though he also remembers the last nephilim he’d met who’d done nothing more dire than serve him french toast...
, though oddly enough his first reflex was to glance over at Cas to see what the angel currently in his life thought of that proposition. Cas was staring blankly at the far wall with a closed off expression and hadn’t seemed to hear.
Dean ran, but every five minutes he’d stop, leave a rocket on a fuse or an ampoule of blood in a circle.
Dean wakes with a strangled gasp, half out of the recliner, a deathgrip on its armrests. The sour taste in his mouth might be nausea or acid reflux, or maybe a distant memory of beer.
“I only saw her for a few short seconds, but I’m sure I’ll recognize her when I see her again… I know I’ll never forget her… I owe her everything… But I suppose you don’t approve all the same.” Dean’s distant look switches to a much more astute one centered on Castiel. “Since healing magic is still magic.”
As a matter of fact, at four months and change  - near the halfway mark as it were - he still doesn’t look all that different, though he’s had to loosen his belt by three notches since this sleighride began. His six pack has lost some of its definition, the small bulge is still there, but it’s invisible under his usual layers. (So says Reason. Panic swears it’s visible from outer space, but Dean tries not to listen too much.)
“Wouldn’t be my choice, but hey, if you want to get to know humans other than me and Sam, and getting threats from Bobby, that’d be the place to go.”
favors, kid! I hid your grandpa, I protected your Dad as much as he’d let me, I murdered Metatron for you - though I would have done that last for the fun of it, to be honest. I made sure you and Sam were safe in the loosest Paradise there is, I left you there to live out a life of ease and peace for as long as it was possible - but when the bull biscuits started flyin’, I took considerable risk getting your brother out and made sure you could follow. You, Dean-o-”
“Yeah, I know-” Oh hell. “I... I thought that- that you guys- I mean, other sounds get you mixed up-... you couldn’t hear my footsteps last Thursday when I was creeping around.”
The abruptness and angle of Cas’s index finger indicated a spot not far away from the deer. There was still nothing to see.
Dean was bent over the piece, but his screwdriver was idly tapping the table. He was watching Castiel out of the corner of his eyes again. Castiel wondered if he should move back to the window. He’d rather hoped to see Dean work on the small mechanism up close. What even was a wind-up toy?
He would have, but Cas reached up, fast as a thought, and caught him, hands firm behind his back, holding him steady at a bit of an angle in a way that would have been completely impossible to maintain for mere human muscles.
The words ‘under attack’ rise like the tide, carried by waves of different voices. And there’s the smell of course. Sulfur. Olefiant gasses. Rot. Corruption.
Dean stared at the slug with new eyes. “That’s doable? I thought they weren’t actually made of metal - not real meltable metal.”
“So that’s why he wanted me and Sam to come to P1.” Dean sounded oddly detached to his own ears. “’Cause he wants one of us to...”
“Any news from that guy yet?” Dean asks idly, removing one of the gloves. “He should be at the hospital by now, the nearest is only ten minutes away.”
“Yep,” Dean repeated, since that was certainly going to be the case in a minute. His hand slipped to the back of his jeans and fastened on the hilt of the First Blade.
“Drew Neely. No pack. Trader, he said. Never seen him before. He passed through Peckanole, Brooks and Woodson packs before coming here, nothing reported against him. Utah?” She glances at Cas. “His itinerary is from the east.”
"The traitor. The rebel. Your Morningstar. He is dead. I am rooting out his pawns and allies, everyone who helped him, none will survive. He is gone, you will all follow, all of you. There will be nothing left of him anywhere when I am done.”
have put you two through a few more miles on this recent itinerary than was strictly required. A small number of angels have defected and eventually found their way to my side over the centuries - usually the scrapings of the P342 barrel, since no one cares if they disappear. They
It takes two minutes and many words, including Liability, Lease vs Bailment, and Coupon, for Castiel to realize that the long-winded man in the green uniform has nothing very relevant to say. He cuts the mortal off in the middle of the word Insurance by turning and walking away. The Air Park official trails after him with the slow trudging footstep of one carrying a large bag of manure he’s had to cart around all week.
His gaze is like some immeasurably heavy load he has to haul up from where it’s fallen on the table, up across the oak expanse, the chair’s armrest, past the motionless gun, up to Dean’s chest and pair of hard green eyes, watching him.
“Ah, Castiel. Anything to report?” Crowley asks straight out. Castiel wonders if Crowley is aware how much he sounds like Hannah when he talks like that, and realizes that, yes, being Crowley, he probably knows it and relishes this subtle reminder that Castiel is at his beck and call.
Dean was inspecting the lentils for stones. Then he washed some vegetables, cut some carrots up and dumped them in the pot of water starting to simmer on the stove. Some day old bread in the pantry was popped into the oven to make rusks. Dean moved easily, confidently around the kitchen. He obviously liked to cook, he was at ease here.
There were stairs here at one point, climbing to a mezzanine, but they look unsafe to the extreme. Dean vaults up the waist-high ledge rather than risk a broken ankle.
Cas nodded at him somberly, before glaring at his brother once again. “I still don’t believe you,” he said bluntly. “But my loyalty is ultimately not to Michael or the Host, it is to my Father, to the Machine that is His manifestation here on earth. He has decreed that Dean and I are united. If Dean believes this strongly that this is the way forward...”
The paper was picked from his hands. Dean’s fingers twitched, an abortive reflex to keep it, burn it- his mind was blank, echoing vastness.
“You aren’t reacting like I thought you would,” Castiel finally said, grabbing the bull by the horns
“We’re sure!” says Hannah a bit too loudly. Castiel is beginning to know his fellow angels in their present state of self-rule. This is a “we’re actually only fairly sure, but we’re so scared without Daddy to tell us what to do, that we’re going to move heaven and earth even if we’re not 100% certain” type of sure.
“Still goes down when you knife him.” Dean spun his angel blade through his fingers in illustration.
Dean glanced over at Cas, to find the angel giving him the same look of askance. But they’d come this far… they looked away again in shared resignation.
Castiel obliged, but paused again, startled, as soon as he reached the open door to the parlor. There was an additional guest this evening: Balthazar, a glass of lemon punch in one hand and looking perfectly at home and relaxed, was chatting with Rufus. Castiel scrutinized him, and so did the Winchesters.
The brother who’d fought for eons at his side had an honestly consternated look on his face as he shook his head quickly.
“Sam Winchester is innocent. His brother is not. I think you knew this,” Castiel said without much condemnation.
to stay here with me for as long as you want,” Crowley said from the safe distance he was still at. He was looking from Sam to Dean and back again with a rich slow smile that had Dean going, “Nuh-uh, not gonna happen.”
The man’s eyes leap to the door, and even over the distance of the tidy front yard and picket fence, Castiel can see the eyebrows go up. “Wide open. Did something bust in?”
“You don’t-” Dean rolls his eyes and speaks with utter assurance. “Cas, what did we say about words like that? We got each other’s back, we’re family. Fine, no need to harp on it. That’s what you meant. Right?”
It was still short of the midday meal, and Castiel was already exhausted, but he was on track for his duties and all the extras involved in welcoming their guests this afternoon. As long as there were no sudden catastrophe-
“I didn’t say that!” Sam’s eyes are wide again as he makes quick ‘whoa!’ gestures in their direction. “Dean, I’m glad for you guys! This is great, this-”
“Hell has lost all the heavy hitters it ever had, and my power’s pretty much the only thing giving this place any juice any more, however incompatible we are,” Gabriel interjected indifferently. “As for why Crowley
Dean’s head whipped around at the word ‘rest’. His husband was silent and expressionless. But Dean knew, he just knew Cas was in no way putting any faith into what his traitorous resistance-founding brother was saying.
Castiel looked back at him, eyebrows arching up. Was he surprised at Dean’s forthrightness? Dean was sort of surprised too, really. It was as if his gut was saying, yeah, don’t bother lying. And really, what was the point? Both he and Cas knew the score. If he had to choose to pointlessly dick around with the truth like a snake-oil salesman who didn’t have a hope in hell of rooking this particular customer, or just putting it out on the table, Dean was going to go with the latter.
Dean unties the leather thongs and flips through the pages carefully. “Here. It's the word Hema-... No, Herm-something… it’s about sex and stuff. Uh-”
“I don’t care what might happen! I don’t care what he might become! Cas, I swear to god, you hurt my son, I will kill you!”
“He’s not noticed yet, has he.” Surprising, maybe, but according to Rowena, a cambion’s  camouflage is second to none. And though Cas had his hands all over Dean as recently as three days ago, he’s not actually had to heal him or do anything mystical at him since before Dean went demony. That was before all this shit happened.
Oblivious to Dean’s thoughts, the baby dozes on. Or maybe it’s unconscious, because if it is sleeping, it’s the utterly-knocked-out kind that comes after a fight for your life at the finish line of a marathon. It’s not twirling it’s moustache, it’s not staring around creepily and plotting world domination, it’s head is not spinning. It’s sleeping there like it doesn’t know how completely and utterly helpless it is. Like it’s… like
“Because… because there’s something dangerous about his appearance, I think. I… Yes, I remember. In the early days, a knight found me here a few days before the equinox. This was before the forest grew quite so out of control. I was able to explain my plight, and she laid in ambush here, waiting for the fiend to arrive. She fought most valiantly, for hours, the entire night, but then… he threw back his hood… or she tore it off… and yes, I remember! The sight of him paralyzed her! She stood there, sword poised, but unable to strike!”
Dean’s non-committal noise is back, it slips out while the rest of Dean is wrestling the bristly words ‘Yeah, I’ve known about that for months now and I’ve even read the first chapter!’ back where they belong, into the inner cage of the slinky dark critter that’s been pacing around for days. A shameful flea-ridden beast made of jealousy and old hurt, mangy and starved, almost forgotten at times, yet still able to growl and claw at the bars every time Dean’s come back, tired and dirty, from a day of scouting to find Sam and Cas talking together, head down around the fire as they look at drawings scratched into the dirt.
“Yeah, this guy’s the Joker - not that I haven’t stopped reeling about that yet. At the end of the day, though, he works for the resistance and helps the railroad, and that aligns with my beliefs. I warned you from the start, right? I promised not to put a knife in your back, but that was as far as I could go. If this was some ploy to get you to betray the Host, and Samuel and Gabriel ordered me to lie my ass off to convince you, I’d do it.”
“Yeah, he can wait a hell of a long time for that,” Dean said, and went towards the trapdoor to instigate the rest of the afternoon’s fun and games.
Please note that Dean is still the emotionally constipated grump we know and love, so don't expect any grand romantic declarations any time soon, you gotta read between the lines. This is the case in most of my fics, I'm not a traditional romantic ^^;
After a few more words, the subject is dropped, and Dean talks instead of some of Charlie’s latest dust-ups with Rowena (“I don’t know, man, they seem to be fighting more and louder, but less viciously. A bit. Maybe they’re learning to get along.”) Castiel for his part tells Dean about some of the strange things he’s seen on his latest stretch of travel, some occurrences truly bizarre, others ordinary but simply incomprensible to an angel, which always makes Dean chuckle. Dean sounds a lot more energized and relaxed near the end of the call. He sends a photo of the Mark to Castiel - then talks the angel through opening the attachment - and it truly is fading, glory be. Castiel eventually hangs up and continues on his search (currently for gasoline, he let his car’s fuel run out again.)
“That’s-...” Cas sinks his head against Dean’s shoulder and talks into his neck. “I need to learn to control myself.”
“I still have the list of dancing places you printed off before our Albuquerque trip,” Cas offered, putting his hand inside his trench coat pocket.
Dean hadn’t yet gotten past the ‘Biggest-bastard-in-the-halo-brigade-wanting-to-wear-him-like-a-Sunday-suit’ part of the revelation yet, he’d not thought about what Michael would do with his body once he was down on earth. From the way Colt had said humanity was on the brink, and from his description of what he’d saw ‘Henrietta’ do before that vessel was destroyed in the final fight, Dean knew that if he and Sam were convinced or coerced to agree to- to - to
“Was somebody using Paradise 342 as a dumping ground?” The Machine normally made suggestions as to where humans and angels should be sent, but due to their losses during and after the apocalypse, Michael and his cadre dictated which suggestions had to be followed and which could be abrogated to make up for weaknesses in the deployment. Castiel suspected other angels down the line took this as permission to meddle as well.
The man stares for another few seconds before reaching into his back pocket for his ringing phone without losing sight of the bay window.
, yes,” says Dean, misunderstanding. “Then wait for me in the map room, and prepare to explain why you left your post at the border.” He is staring as if he’s hoping his gaze will knock two holes into Castiel’s forehead. “That is an order, soldier. Do your duty and know your place.”
Alone in the dark room, watching the embers in the oven slowly cool and a spider tiptoe across the ceiling, Castiel pondered.
“No, he’s not. Good grief, bro! You’ve lived a few weeks in Paradise now, do you really think that- that milquetoast watered down version of a boring sunday afternoon is what the Plan was?! That’s Michael’s thing! Control! Everyone in line! Do as I say! Not the Machine. Dad’s greatest achievement with humans was free will. See much of that in Paradise?”
With a bristle brush and a bar of lye soap, Cas attacks the first of the oilskins, up to his knees in the water near a large half-submerged rock that he’s using as a handy washboard. Dean sits on the bank nearby, feeling a little useless until Cas turns to him with a smile of one who wouldn’t mind entertainment while he works.
...that put a different spin on things. “So you put the whole country to sleep… to spare them? You actually saved the kingdom?”
Once again there’s that little shimmer in Castiel’s face that’s kind of like a smile even if it’s hard to pinpoint. It’s all in the way his eyes crinkle and the lines around his mouth smooth out.
So it turns out, salamanders are slimy stupid critters, except those born from the ashes of a witch burned at the stake. Those look like slimy stupid critters, but when exposed to naked flame, they burst into a fire that can’t be extinguished until it has consumed all it touches. Dean’s pretty sure that’s never been featured on the National Geographic channel, and he’s well acquainted with their programming after sleeping in too many motels that didn’t have pay per view.
“Shut up, angel. Cas and me, we tell it like it is. Besides, he’s smart enough to have thought of that. And I wouldn’t have it any other way,” Dean said firmly, looking back at his spouse.
The words are out of Castiel’s mouth, put there by Doubt before Faith can protest. “We really need to find out what these demons are up to, and we can’t afford to constantly lose ground to this Smith. I think we need to split up. We’ll get more done that way. Ask Jodie for assistance-”
He was about to add more, but Castiel spun on him and gave him a look in which he deliberately let slip some of his anxiety and frustration. Dean’s eyes narrowed, either in warning or in appraisal.
“No…” Castiel began to formulate words - short words, as devoid of noisy consonants as possible, that would not further pound in his head. Or maybe he could write the explanation in a letter. Yes, a letter. Then Dean could read it quietly, and-
There’s that marker with 45 on it that Dean can’t make heads or tails of. A dozen times he’s driven this route and he has yet to see a 44 or a 46.
For a moment like a miracle, Castiel feels utter relief burst through his chest. But it's short-lived.
Cas, looking critically at their cabin again, bites his lip. “A larger bed will take up a lot of space, though. If we keep this one, I could make myself a small desk and put it over there.”
He wasn’t going to say anything because he believed in the cause he’d been ready to die for since he was a kid, the one John had been ready to die for. Even though the tally of the evening was that humans had tried to kill Dean
a fucking complication and a distraction I don’t need right now, I am still borderline damned and demonized, but tell me, Sam, you ever see me get anything in my life that was easy?”
“Right.” Dean blinked. He’d forgotten about that for a second. “Hey, where is it? It’s- it’s not back in the Dome thing, is it?” That would be confusing. More confusing.
Gabriel reached out his hand very slowly and touched Henry lightly on the head. Henry blinked at him a few times, and something about him... changed.
Cas is not sitting in his corner, he’s pacing back and forth in front of the fireplace. The air smells of throttled anger, acrid resentment. Dean, elan shattered, stops in the open doorway like he hit a wall.
The warrior king only takes the frightened woman briefly by the shoulder, eyes flicking over the clearing, the trees, the dead men sprawled around, before settling on the danger up ahead - on Castiel. He moves Lutecia back and behind him with nothing but a short, “You two, watch her,” over his shoulder. Two soldiers who’d been following their king, stop on either side of the delicate woman, swords drawn to protect her. Sam quickly joins them.
“Cause it’ll take awhile and I thought you were in a hurry to see your brother,” Samuel shot back. “Besides, halfway through my explanation, your angel is going to try to jump down my craw, and I’m too old to be Israel. I’ll explain downstairs where there’ll be help at hand if he gets too agitated for his own good.”
Dean claps his thighs and shoves himself to his feet on the impetus, swapping that rare moment of stillness for his usual coiled energy. “Alright then, come on, we got a situation brewing, but I’m gonna need a map. There’s one in my tent. Also the reports I just received- hello there.”
“What-what d’you mean? M’not drunk. You’re drunk. Got wine all over your- your chest-bit there. Now, now, now you know what’s weird? It’s the quiet times. The silence. S’different silence when they’re here and quiet, and when they’re gone, you notice that? That’s what I’m talkin’ about. That’s, y’know, the feeling.”
Dean glances at his watch as he walks quietly through the house. Nap time should be winding down. He’s ready to bet Charlie is in her room, staring at her computer screen right now, desperately delving through mythical lands of ever-battling orcs while she still can, each precious minute draining away fast. Dean doesn’t bother her, he goes straight to the nursery, says, “I’m on duty, Charles,” to the baby monitor, and then switches it off.
Cas reads the paper in the light of the kerosene lamp, then he tilts it another way to examine it under the dying light of day pouring through the door behind his back. “No, sorry, doesn’t ring a bell. I can tell you we never had anyone from Novak pack with that name,” he adds with faint irony. He’s smart enough to have figured out the connection they’re most concerned about. “This word here… it says Atlanta.”
“Cambion and other truly powerful entities exist in a fluid state in time, so to speak. You can’t put a human frame of reference on that. For beings such as Robert, choices of this magnitude are made at a higher level of fate. Your son took this grave decision-”
“...You don’t think Rowena has ulterior motives in keeping me away?” Castiel asks, speaking carefully. “It sounds like she is trying to isolate you.”
Cas sat back a few inches until the back of his knees touched the bed, feet still on the floor; they would give him some traction to thrust upward later if he felt like participating, but with Dean on top, the human would have things entirely in his own hands if the angel preferred to stay passive. Dean went for the pot again, made sure Cas was slicked up properly because Dean had to be able to walk, run and fight tomorrow and all. Cas still looked really intrigued and whole-heartedly absorbed by all of this. Dean had the impression his husband hadn’t blinked once in the past ten minutes.
He flits around the planet a few times, relishing the indescribable breath of freedom he’s not tasted since-... ever, really. He’s free to go wherever he wants and do what he wills. Other fallen angels before him let that freedom go to their heads and did some pretty silly things: founded new religions, bossed humans around, smote everything they disapproved of, the like, but Castiel doesn’t see the appeal. He has no intention of violating heavenly decree, and he doesn’t feel like getting hunted down and killed by his brethren for doing so either. He now has a finite lifespan, a few centuries at most, and this is as refreshing and precious to him as the freedom to fly through crisp mountain air without pressing duties. He has
Dean feels something break deep inside, but it’s one more pain in an area that’s so scarred over already, it’s more a numb ache than anything else.
Castiel staggers as muddy sand shifts beneath his feet. As he rights himself, his arm quite naturally anchors around Dean’s back, and the other arm around his shoulder presses both his lover and the child into Castiel’s chest. In his embrace, Dean’s soul shines like never before, like a beacon, like the light divine that spilled out once over Eden, pure and warm and all-encompassing.
While all these thoughts were racing through his mind, Cas was still standing right in front of him - looking more confused with every second that Dean only stood there, letting that sudden tension between them grow.
“Because… first, Cas and I have to shovel the way to the storage room free,” Dean explained with a mischievous glance in Castiel’s direction.
“I wanted them to look like bees,” he stated matter-of-factly and just then, Dean noticed that Cas had in fact only colored the yellow-coloured eggs with the stripes.
“Don’t exaggerate. It’s just Easter eggs,” Dean laughed and gently broke away from Cas to look him in the eye. “You’re welcome.”
“I honestly like Charlie’s idea of going to the wellness area. And she is right, you know? You need some time to relax. You’re always working so hard.” Castiel actually sounded concerned.
Which was exactly the reason why he was the most interesting of the group. It was amusing to watch several guests trying to flirt with him and Castiel being totally oblivious to their avances.
When he pulled back just enough to look at Cas and opened his eyes, he could see that Cas did the same with a small smile on his lips.
But it didn’t matter – he couldn’t change it anyway. The only thing that mattered was that he would see Dean again.
“Oh no, I won't go in there again because I can't guarantee that I won't do anything stupid,” Dean answered hastily.
At the excited cheers of the kids, he quickly added, “But you have to be patient for a little while longer.”
“Meghan Rachel Winchester,” Sam finally snapped, “if you don’t stop right now, you can spend the rest of the day in our room.”
To his delight the Mistletoe discovered that, even though he wasn’t able to hear them, at least he could see the little group through the window.
“Good night, my love,” Cas replied sleepily and Dean felt him moving a little right before soft lips found his, pressing a gentle kiss onto them. They both fell asleep within minutes.
When Castiel – who had a couple of feet’s lead – quickly bent to gather a handful of snow, Dean took his chance and leaped forward to tackle him. They both tumbled to the ground and Dean landed on top of Castiel.
Cas frowned. “Are you sure? I really don’t mind going home now,” he questioned. For a moment, Dean’s thoughts got lost again at how adorable Cas looked, especially when he tilted his head like that. He smiled.
The Mistletoe couldn’t understand what they were saying but they seemed to have a little discussion. A moment later, Dean downed the remains of his whiskey and followed Charlie over to one of the couches by a fireplace.
Dean rummaged through the box containing all sorts of arts and crafts materials that Cas had put on the dining table. He was searching for something that…
“That is so mean. The other kids are already out to play. We don’t need free paths, we want to play in the snow and-”
That night the heavens opened and the already snow-laden landscape was covered in a white blanket of even more powdery snow. The Mistletoe had heard the staff of the morning shift talk about the fact that the streets were almost impossible to get through.
Hearing that, knowing that he was not in the Empty anymore – that he was finally free – it made one wish grow more than any other.
“Cas, you know Chuck – and Billie – lied a lot. To all of us. Even to them,” he gestured to Empty-Meg. “Chuck told them that he has no power here and that they wouldn’t be disturbed. And Billie lied when she said that they could go back to sleep as soon as Chuck is defeated.”
Of course Dean knew that it wasn't just the Easter eggs that made Cas so happy. It was the fact that Dean was taking his affection for bees seriously and that he was willing to help make something special for the kids. After all, the eggs were a donation for the city's yearly Easter Hunt.
“Okay, I give up. You’ve talked me into it,” Dean laughed at the way his family united their forces against him.
“Someone, actually,” Castiel replied absentmindedly, already looking at the clock and the door to the entrance hall again.
“Yes,” Castiel moaned before he fell into a chair next to Dean – who was playing a board game with his niece and nephew – and let his head rest on his arms on the table.
Eileen put a hand on her husband's arm and gave him a soft smile. Apparently, it was easier for her to endure her children's nagging.
It wouldn’t be the first time they slept on the couch instead of their bed. After all, this was the exact reason why they had decided to buy the large and extremely comfortable piece of furniture. They had a tendency to fall asleep while watching a movie or relaxing together after a long day.
But it had been truly worth it. In the end, they had too many to even count. There were the yellow bee ones; red ones with black dots that made them look like ladybugs; orange ones with brown tiger stripes, and green ones with white and yellow dots to make them look like they were a meadow sprinkled with daisies.
WHAM! A thick lump of snow hit Dean right on the back of his head and startled him out of his stupor.
“I think I’ve got an idea.” Dean had silently followed the exchange between Castiel and the kids. “Hold on, I’ll be right back.” And with that he left the room again to go to reception once more.
But before panic could settle in, Dean felt Cas leaning into him. His heart took an excited jump when Cas’ arms wound around him and he finally returned the kiss.
“Alright then. I think we need to borrow a sledge,” he smiled at the enthusiasm of his niece and nephew. “Wait here, I got this.”
The lamps in the big hall switched on and revealed the horrors he had done. All around him on the floor lay dozens of dead bodies – all of them an exact copy of Dean.
It was as if the whole world around them disappeared. Neither of them cared that they were still in a room full of people. The music was still buzzing and the people were still talking and laughing but they had only eyes for each other.
After this confirmation there was no stopping Dean. He rushed the last few steps towards the angel and pulled him into a tight embrace. The tension in Cas quickly gave way and he returned the hug.
When Cas' gaze turned hesitant, Dean realized that his voice might have been too full of emotions. He cleared his throat. To his own surprise, he discovered that he didn’t really mind. He had hidden his feelings for so long and he didn’t even know why anymore.
Then the words registered in his head and stopped his musings. Right, they were talking about a deal. A deal that supposedly didn’t affect Jack.
“I’m sorry. But if you really want to, you will find another opportunity. And do it fast. Cas is oblivious to Mick’s attempts for now but I’m not sure how he would react when he finally gets the clue. It’s actually adorable how naive he is in such matters and in this case it’s lucky for you,” Charlie spoke urgently but still in a whisper.
They were still standing close together. They had always ignored the concept of personal space; gravitating towards each other without even realizing. Using this fact for his advantage now, Dean cradled the side of Cas’ face in his hand and brushed his thumb over his cheekbone.
“Love you too, honey bee,” Dean replied with a soft voice, dozing in and out of sleep after all. He wound his arms tighter around Cas, who used the opportunity to cuddle impossibly closer by draping a leg over Dean’s.
“You really want to give Mick free rein? With Cas – half naked… in the swimming pool?” Charlie asked with raised eyebrows.
A little further down the road he saw someone standing just inside the beam of a street light. He pulled over to the side of the road and for a moment, he just sat there, the rumbling of the engine the only sound to be heard, staring at the all too familiar figure under the light.
The twins cheered and Dean stared at them in mock horror as the three of them faced him and started to bombard him with snowballs.
Everytime their lips parted and met again, Dean could taste in Cas’ breath the sweetness of the cocktail he had taken from him earlier. But other than before, the flavor wasn’t unpleasant; mingled with Cas’ very own taste it was downright addictive.
Dean proceeded to decorate the already black-striped yellow eggs while Cas kept painting the others. They ended up dying two dozen more eggs in the sunny color. As a finishing touch and to make them look even more like the little honey gatherers, Cas painted eyes on them.
Cas was very suspicious about such a deal. If his time with Sam and Dean had taught him one thing, it was that deals never came without a price. He frowned.
The Mistletoe's highlight was always when a couple found themselves beneath him and kissed. Sometimes he even cheered them on.
His smile widened. Of course, his bee-loving husband would paint yellow Easter eggs as bees. Chuckling about Cas’ dorky but adorable fondness for those little fluffy balls, he sat down on the opposite side of the table. “Well, in that case, I think we need more details.”
“Just try it. I know you wouldn’t like the heat in the sauna, but they also have a big pool for swimming, a massage area – and don’t even try to pretend you don’t enjoy a massage – a whirlpool, and even a brine bath,” Castiel listed.
Charlie looked dumbfounded at Dean and if he could, the Mistletoe would roll on the floor with laughter.
“Come on, buddy. Can’t let your holy-tax-accountant-costume go to waste,” he winked. Cas pouted at Dean’s description of his costume and Dean laughed out loud.
Dean thought about it for a moment, but he knew - even though Cas wouldn’t admit it - that Cas was having fun. He always put Dean first, so the least Dean could do now was to put Cas’ interests first for a change. Maybe the rest of the night wouldn’t be so bad if he kept concentrating on Cas.
“That’s what I wanted to hear.” She slapped him playfully on the upper arm and smiled. “Let’s go back.”
“You wanna join Cas and me for a wellness day?” He signed along for Sam’s wife and both women smiled brightly and agreed.
Dean nearly toppled over with laughter and Castiel still grinned when they left the room to get their warm clothes as well.
Cas was trapped in the middle of a circle of fire. Holy fire. At the other side of the room stood Dean – the hurt about Cas’ betrayal evident in his eyes.
Both laughed as Castiel wiggled to get free and Dean tried to hold him down. This went on for a while until both their laughters faded into smiling and staring each other in the eyes.
They were at it for a while now and both men’s faces were flushed from the exertion. They were engaged in friendly banter and it looked like Dean tried to coax Castiel into a competition. Dean's challenge seemed to be successful because Castiel laughed and suddenly became a lot more enthusiastic in the matter.
Dean preferred to spend his evenings with his closest friends - or only with Cas - a couple of drinks and a good movie or even game nights. But at gatherings like these, he always felt like an ant in the middle of a hive; out of place.
But there were people all around them so he didn’t dare to do it. He was already crippling with anxiety and the pent up longing only made it worse. He wanted to leave but he had promised that he would stay for a couple of hours.
The Easter Egg Hunt was a complete success. Since they had contributed a lot more eggs than the average, Dean and Cas had to start hiding them way earlier than the other donors. But it was worth it. Above all, the bee eggs – which they had hidden in the branches of flowering bushes – were a hit with the children. And the organizers had already persuaded Cas – much to Dean’s amusement at his husband’s expanse, who could never say no – to take part again next year.
She looked concerned and let her gaze wander around the room until she found Dean. Charlie approached him and put a hand on his shoulder.
“For helping me. It was my idea to donate eggs for the Easter hunt and you spent your whole day with it,” Cas explained, sounding as tired as Dean felt.
where he was supposed to be driving. Like a beacon in his heart he knew when he had to turn right or left. Even though he didn’t know
“Yeah, I know. And I won’t go home from this trip without having an answer. No second guesses anymore, no fear. I promise.”
Castiel was quieter than the others, almost shy, but with his dark tousled hair and his bright blue eyes, he instantly attracted the attention of women and men alike.
Just as he thought he couldn’t take it any longer, Cas once again caught up on his state of mind. He took Dean’s hand and mouthed, “let’s go.” He dragged him out of the crowded room, out to the back porch. It was a little bit chilly, so only a few people were out.
To be honest, he found Cas’ fondness for bees adorable and loved him even more because of his devotion to even the smallest creatures in the world.
Dean let his hand brush over the smooth surface of her roof. He got behind the wheel of his beloved car and let the feeling of coming home sink in.
They arrived on monday with quite a commotion; not surprising considering they were a total of twelve people, including two children. Even though the Mistletoe was sure they weren’t all blood-related, they still were as close as any family he had ever seen.
He straightened up and asked with a tense smile, “Who is Mick?” The curiosity in his voice was almost palpable.
When Mick turned his gaze in the direction Castiel was looking, the Mistletoe saw his smile fall. Looking around himself, it wasn’t hard to understand what had caused the sudden change in his mood.
They had spent a lot of time together, enjoying the day’s events and drinking at the bar until late into the night.
Cas stumbled through the darkness, in desperate need to find the source of the voice that pierced the deafening silence; realization dawning on him that this was no longer a dream.
, as the Mistletoe got used to call him – had been no exception. By now, they had been nagging their parents about it for at least an hour, and the girl – Meg – was far from giving up, while the boy – Jack – had apparently decided to let his sister fight it out. Or maybe he was just more sensitive to the mood of his parents, which was about to change from patient to irritated if the tightening in Sam’s jaw was any indication.
A young, quirky red-head, who almost bubbled over with good humor; a man in his late thirties who seemed to be almost as childish as the two children. Those belonged to the young couple, who was obviously tooth-rottingly happy and in love. She seemed to be a sweet soul and he… was freakishly tall.
He heard Dean – curled up on the ground – begging for his life but he couldn’t stop his vessel from bending down and stabbing him right through the heart.
“I think, now is the perfect time to go home, don’t you think?” Cas asked, determination in his voice.
Aside from the egg currently in his hands, Cas had already painted four other eggs in a similar fashion.
“We can wrap it around the eggs and tie it into little bows. It will look like the eggs have wings. What do you think?”
But as time passed, the familiar self-doubts and the guilt about the renewed self-sacrifice of one of the most important people in his life surfaced and washed away the certainty of Cas’ words and feelings. What if the real meaning behind his words were that he loved Dean like a brother – like family – and it was only Dean’s wishful thinking that gave the words a different meaning? The meaning that he longed so much for but had never been brave enough to express himself. The meaning he had buried deep within himself.
The older folks – five of the group – didn’t arouse much interest. They spent their days with walks around the resort, card games, and reading at the fireplaces. But the younger ones were a social potpourri.
Dean hated parties. There were always too many people in too small rooms, mostly overly sweet drinks, and music that was torture for his Classic Rock used ears.
At first, he had feared he might lose Cas if he didn’t return his feelings - but Cas had proven over and over again that he would always be there if Dean needed him.
Glancing back to Mick’s stony face, then back to the happy friends embracing each other, the Mistletoe became gleeful.
At the beginning, Castiel had the upper hand due to the fact that he was less exhausted. But what he didn’t see was that Dean shoveled his own snow back on the path that Castiel just cleared.
When he looked back at Cas he saw his own excitement mirrored in Cas’ bright blue eyes. Next thing he knew, he had his arms full of his husband. Dean smiled brightly at the enthusiasm and gripped him tight.
Dean couldn’t wrap his head around it. The entity in the Empty hated Cas with a spite that even Dean couldn’t comprehend. There was no way they would just let him go.
Through the door they could see that Dean was talking to the guy at the reception desk. He seemed to be hesitant to whatever request Dean was proposing to him, but Dean didn’t stop talking animatedly to him, and after a few minutes the receptionist nodded and Dean smiled brightly.
“Because this came up after we left for the holidays and it can’t wait until we get back,” Sam sighed. “I will make it up to you. I promise. To both of you,” he added with a look to Castiel.
“Yeah, thank you. You are a lifesaver,” Sam spoke up. “I would love to go outside with them but we really have to finish this first,” he explained, gesturing to the papers on the table.
Barely three hours later, a fuming Dean – clothed in just a bathrobe – stormed into the main hall and headed straight to the bar. He talked to the bartender and a few moments later, there was a tumbler of whiskey placed in front of Dean.
– under control and busy. Together they searched for stones and sticks to give the snowman eyes and arms.
Castiel laughed so loud at Dean’s misery that the Mistletoe could hear him through the closed windows. And it would have been funny for the Mistletoe too if he weren’t so frustrated that Dean’s attempt to kiss Castiel – and it was pretty obvious that he was just about to do it – got interrupted; again.
“Good night, Cas,” Dean mumbled into Cas’ hair while pressing a kiss onto his head, his eyes already closed again.
After Dean brought his things to his family's suite and freshened up, he and Castiel sat on one of the sofas in the main room, both cradling a cup of hot chocolate in their hands while they talked animatedly about what Dean had missed so far.
It was so great to see Bobby again and to know that his family was here – that he could spend as much time with them as he wanted, thanks to all the changes Jack had made.
Where they stood now, the music was really loud. They could barely hear themselves. Dean tried to read the words from Cas’ lips but he was too distracted from his thoughts of how soft they would probably feel on his. He really wanted to kiss them.
Dean strolled over to the bar to order some coffee and came back a few moments later with a big steaming mug of the desired beverage.
On their way out to the Impala they simply waved goodbye at Charlie, who was standing on the opposite side of the room with a huge smile on her face.
Sunday morning started early for the Winchester-Shurley-Clan, as the Mistletoe got used to calling them – even with the additional members like the redhead and the surly old guy, who always wore a baseball cap.
As long as Cas was with him, he could deal with everything. Cas was his solid rock. Always there when everything became too much, when the world seemed to crash down around him. He made Dean feel like he was worth it.
“We wanted to go sledding but everyone is saying that we have to wait ‘til the paths are clear.” His voice sounded small, not heated like his sister’s.
One of the best things of his friendship with Cas was that they could spend time together without having the urge to fill every second of it with talking. They just leaned on the border and watched the stars in the clear sky for a few minutes. Then Dean sighed and pushed off the edge.
Dean and Castiel shoveled snow – the latter admittedly with significantly less eagerness – while the children built a snowman as promised.
He could certainly deal with a stupid crowded Halloween party. It was just one night. At least he had something to drink now that didn’t taste and looked like a unicorn had vomited in it.
As he was about to execute his escape plan, a hand landed on his shoulder and had him look up at the person it belonged to. Cas smiled at him as he took the cup Charlie had pushed into Dean’s hand earlier and finished the obnoxiously sweet concoction himself. Then he leaned in to talk directly into Dean’s ear.
Charlie smiled brightly. “Oh, nothing really. Just slept in and relaxed. They have a really nice wellness area here. You should try.”
Together they walked back to the car. Baby had always been his home and as they sank into the seats and he caught the serene smile on Cas’ face, he knew that it held a special place in his heart as well. And as he started up the engine, the sound of his Baby in his ears, the taste of the love of his existence still on his lips and the man himself right beside him, his Heaven was finally perfect after all.
“Whoa, slow down,” Dean interrupted her. “Why can’t you just go outside alone?” He glanced over to his brother who was about to answer when Meg chimed in again.
One of his hands was still on Cas’ neck, with his thumb grazing his cheek. Meanwhile, the other one rested on Cas’ back and Dean pulled him closer for a moment, before he slowly ended the kiss and loosened his grip.
“Hello Castiel,” Jack answered, almost as cheerful as ever. He even held his hand up in his typical gesture.
“Hey, Charlie. Eileen,” Dean called out to the women who were sitting by one of the fireplaces. Charlie touched Eileen's arm and pointed toward Dean.
At first they both didn’t want to go to this party. They only did it because of Charlie. But now at least Cas seemed to really enjoy it. He even swayed absentmindedly to the music; Dean noticed.
“A couple of black stripes don’t make an egg into a bee, don’t you think?” Dean explained with a wink.
It was still weird for Cas to see the features of the woman he once considered some kind of ally as this powerful cosmic entity. She used to tease him and flirt with him; now all he could see in this eyes was disdain. He knew it wasn’t really her. Just a copy of the vessel she used to possess, but still…
“Yeah, you’ve mentioned it now and again,” Dean finally replied in an amused voice, but his eyes betrayed him.
“Uncle Dean, can you please go outside with us to play? Daddy says he and Mommy don’t have time but all the other kids are already outside and there is so much fresh snow-”
They spoke quietly but thankfully, they had chosen a couch close to the Mistletoe. Since there weren’t many guests in the room, he could still understand them.
“I’m sure. Just give me a few minutes to cool down. It’s hot in there.” He had already taken off his flanel and left it on the counter by the bar earlier.
Cas looked up from the egg in his hands and tilted his head, confusion clear in his eyes. “I’m painting Easter eggs for tomorrow.”
“Dean, I know that Mick is flirting with Cas. He did it all week. I wasn’t just teasing yesterday. Even if Cas didn’t see it.”
“Heya Cas,” Dean responded, feeling somewhat nervous himself. The last time they had seen each other, Cas had dropped that overwhelming bomb on him. In this moment – surprising as it was – Dean had absolutely believed him. There was no doubt in Cas’ eyes or voice when he said all those words about him – when he confessed his feelings for him. There was no doubt in Dean that Cas had really meant every word he’d said back then.
Still tired, but no longer on the brink of sleep, they enjoyed each other’s touch and warmth. Dean was listening to Cas’ even breathing, and Cas probably to Dean’s heartbeat, like he always did when they were cuddling like this.
Dean continued his game with the twins and after a few sips of his coffee, Castiel was awake enough to participate in normal conversation.
“Morning, sunshine. Want some coffee?” Dean called out to him as soon as he appeared in the doorway. Contrary to Castiel, he was the spitting image of a morning person, broad smile and happy tone included.
The one thing he hated more than regular parties were costume parties - like this Halloween party. He had refused to put on a costume but by now, three people had already told him how good he looked as a lumberjack.
For someone who could only ‘hang around’ all day – like this particular mistletoe – and whose only occupation consisted of watching other people enjoying their free time, quiet days like these were downright boring.
