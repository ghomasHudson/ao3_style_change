announcement, he’d factored the dramatic flourishing into account.)
“No, don’t,” John says, broken and anguished, and Sherlock’s vision blurs.
“Are you actually being serious?” John says. (Maybe he’s asleep and this is all a horrific dream.) “They’ve gone and made a film about our lives… in bloody
“Embankment,” Sherlock says to the cabbie, then leans back in his seat and crosses his legs, seeming perfectly content to sit in silence as Marylebone passes them by.
“Don’t joke,” Sherlock says sharply, whipping round to glare at John. “Don’t – joke about that. It’s – incredibly distressing.”
“Er –” Sherlock said eloquently, blinking down at her, then snapped his mouth shut before he could embarrass himself any further.
Mycroft raises an unimpressed eyebrow at John, but makes no move to escape his hold. "Violence?

The last thing he registers before heat envelops him is the unmistakable
John can feel heat rising in his cheeks. He glances at Sherlock out of the corner of his eye; his friend’s face is flushed and his eyes are slightly glazed over as he stares, transfixed, at the Victorian version of John’s self interrogating him about his sex life.

“The, er, the wedding’s off,” John said blankly. Sherlock barely refrained from rolling his eyes because
“Keep it,” he said, when John tried to hand it back to him three hours later, back in the comfort of their flat. (The stakeout had been a complete failure.)They were both shivering from the cold, John’s nose was red and Sherlock was feeling the loss of scarf around his neck very keenly.
” Donovan cackles gleefully, turning to Anderson. “D’you reckon we should tell him?”
it was a suicide mission, it was six months to infiltrate Eastern Europe's largest underground terrorist organziation from the inside, it had 'death' stamped all over the front cover-"
“Sorry?”
“Meant what?” John asks carefully. One of his hands still rests on Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock imagines the warmth from his hand seeping through his suit jacket, branding him so that wherever he goes, John does, too.
A delicious shudder runs down John’s spine at hearing Holmes and Watson address each other with their Christian names. It feels decidedly more intimate than even the kiss their Victorian counterparts shared; this simple act of calling someone by their name.
“Solved it!” Sherlock announces grandly, picking himself off the table he’s just finished assaulting with the side of his face in an attempt to work out some miniscule detail or other. He breezes past Anderson and Donovan on his way out the door, stopping only to grab John by the elbow – “Come along, John!”
apparent. He’s over thirty-five and barely scraping by on an army pension, for fuck’s sakes; he can’t afford to moon over coffee-addicted but sugar-loving patrons with rich baritone voices and cheekbones sharp enough to cut.
Sherlock clears his throat. "Now Mrs Turner'll definitely start talking to her married ones," he groans, releasing his hold on John and flopping back down onto the sofa.
Sherlock’s been tense and skittish ever since That Night (as John has taken to calling it in his head), as easily frightened as a colt.
“Oh,” John says sheepishly, presumably when he looks down and realizes he’s still holding the pot. “Ow,” he says a moment later, presumably when he realizes it’s still hot.
John rolled his eyes, a fond grin on his face that made the edges of his eyes crinkle. “Dinner as in a date, Sherlock. C’mon, I’ll tell Angelo to bring out every candle he owns and –” John’s face fell. “Sher – Sherlock, are you okay?”
“Everything’s a bloody experiment for you!” John fumes, flinging the carton at Sherlock with a vengeance. He catches it and starts collecting the scattered toes, shoving them back into the container. “What did I tell you about dismembered body parts in the fridge, Sherlock?”
“Right,” John says, and, before he loses his nerve, sets about making Sherlock his drink.
He looks up at John, really
“I had a perfectly valid reason,” Sherlock argues, just for the sake of it, “It would have given you and Mary the closure you needed to start your new life of domestic bliss.”

be the cold, as his tongue darts out to wet slightly chapped lips and his right hand makes an abortive gesture, as if to reach for John’s arm.
John flushes brighter than all of Santa’s reindeer’s noses combined. “I – don’t,” he says, making a swipe for the card that Molly easily evades, “Give that back!”
“Dinner?” Sherlock asks, breathless with exhilaration and terrified that John will say no.
“Are you sure this is the way out?” Victorian-John shouts at him, over the thundering wall of water.
, John thinks. He tugs the collar of his shirt down, and watches with grim satisfaction as Sherlock's eyes go straight to the bruises purpling his throat, courtesy of their sculpture-burgling murderer.
Even if John hadn’t been guilty of lurking behind a coffee grinder, and of avidly following the conversation from said vantage spot, the change in Sherlock’s expression would have been impossible to miss. The scowl on his face vanishes as he stares, stunned, at his coffee.
, how could you? Do you have
Sherlock disappears back into the kitchen. John assumes he must not be interested, but a minute later Sherlock appears again, sans goggles and bearing two mugs of tea.
that the image of Sherlock and police-issue handcuffs, now that they've been conjured, refuse to leave his mind.
"John, it's - it's fine," Sherlock says, praying John listens. He glances at Mary. "
From his vantage point behind the grinder, John watches as Sherlock rips open a sugar packet and dumps the whole thing unceremoniously in. Lestrade’s brow is furrowed as he circles something on the file and spins it round so Sherlock can see it. “How do you explain that then?”
“Ooh, this is so exciting,” she says, completely sidestepping his question, her eyes twinkling as she leads John up a slightly rickety staircase, “You must be quite something, dear. I’ve never seen him so –”
Nothing.
“Do you want my help or not, Lestrade?” their regular – Sherlock – snaps, before turning his piercing gaze on John. He nudges the cappuccino with a pointed finger across the table (no ring, John’s unhelpful brain gleefully points out). “The coffee’s unbearably bitter. I asked for a cappuccino, not death by espresso.”
John is left sitting on sofa staring blankly at their telly, feeling sad, annoyed, and very,
“Okay, I’ve sent it.”
“Don’t –” Sherlock’s hand on his wrist stops him. John turns. His friend’s eyes are riveted on the screen; at where his Victorian counterpart has stopped fighting, has given up. Sherlock takes a deep breath, exhales shakily. “I need – to see this through.”
“I do care for you, a lot more than you seem to think,” John starts, licking his lips. (Sherlock’s gaze flicks down towards it. He wonders if this is a deliberate tactic, if John’s planning an ambush whilst he distracts Sherlock with his tongue.) “And, um. Mary and I weren’t sure how to tell you this, but – uh. We’re not exactly – married, anymore.”
“He’s not my –” Sherlock starts to say tiredly (because John usually says so, at this point), pushing the candle away from him like it’s offended him on a personal level.
(In his mind’s eye he sees himself standing across the road, looking up at St. Bart’s and seeing John perched on the rooftop, arms outstretched and ready to fall.)
“It might be worth having the morgue do an autopsy,” John remarks. He gestures to the prone figure’s neck. “There’re clear signs of asphyxiation; you only get bruises like those when you’re struggling against someone exerting pressure on your neck.”
"I asked you a question," the man says now. He doesn't sound annoyed; if anything, he sounds amused. His gaze flickers away from Sherlock's to land on the corner of the room, out of Sherlock's line of sight, before flicking back again. "For both your sakes, I'd suggest you answer."
Smith's knife slams onto the metal table (Sherlock's decided it's a table he's on; a bed wouldn't be quite so unyielding), two inches from the bridge of Sherlock's nose. The drugs in his system are the only things stopping him from flinching away.
me,” Sherlock says, crowding close and tilting his head down.
Sherlock stops, breathing hard, the ache in his chest a constant reminder of his failings, of the many reasons he doesn’t deserve John. He shifts, turning so he’s sitting with his back to John. “You should go,” he says flatly, emotionlessly. He feels hollow, like there’s a cavity in the centre of his chest, eating away at him. “You and Mary are better off without me.”
“But –” John calls after him, exchanging bewildered glances with Molly, “Your change!”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “You’re just –” He blinked; there was a light on in the dinghy and by its glow he could make out two figures on the embankment heading their way.

, Sherlock!” John says, voice rising in exasperation. “You know what I bloody well mean!”

John’s stiffening body and a heartfelt whimper above him were all it took for Sherlock to take the fall. His body clenched around John’s still throbbing cock, his right hand pressing bruises into wheat-colored skin as he spent himself between them.
*****
“Am I still in coma?” John teased a bit more, watching the other drink his tea.
Grabbing the crackers from the work disc, John walked back into the bedroom, taking Sherlock’s hand to drag him along without a word.
Sherlock froze midway between door and couch table, staring at John as if seeing him for the first time.
“Will you stay with me?” John’s head shot up at that, eyes wide and mouth agape, before he looked away again, staring at the wall over Sherlock’s headboard.
The knife hung loosely from her right hand. If it wasn’t for the way the woman was vibrating with energy, ready to pounce at John any second, an unheeding observer would have thought that she’d immediately forgotten about it until she raised it to be level with the doctor’s throat.
Upon opening the door to their parlor every thought was forgotten as a strong wave of arousal surged through his body. There was a heavenly smell in the air that reminded him of summer nights and Sherlock. He felt his cock harden and press insistently against his pajama pants. John took another whiff of that seductive scent and groaned with lust.
“Fine. Very good, indeed, Sherlock. Do you want to know in detail? You know I could tell you, we have been quite busy…”
Settling down into his chair, John instantly began to read.
“Maybe it doesn’t but I want to know.” He had let go of the tentacle now but his hands were still occupied caressing Sherlock’s sides. His hands met at the lowest opening right on Sherlock’s spine where he pressed lightly around the edges.
“That hospital staff became more rude with every passing day.” She said with a glance in Sherlock's direction. “They treated you good, I hope.” John tried to answer that they had in fact been very polite as she went on. “Well, with Sherlock there everyday, I suppose it wasn't exactly easy for them.” She added a proud wink at Sherlock to the statement.
“Sherlock! Oh, god. You are so tight. So fucking hot. I want to feel you come around me. Sherlock. Please!” The detective surrenders. He held on tight to his control but now he is finally allowed to let go. He rocks down hard on John’s cock, fucking himself on it while John strokes his prick.
The trip to the Yard was a waste of time but Sherlock had expected that. He had actually just wanted to see how many people were calling in sick in spite of deeming their job important. By now, he mused, John probably already remembered the existence of TV and if he did he would be even more devastated. Sherlock had already checked all media in the morning and it was obvious that John wasn’t some kind of host for this disease. It wasn’t even a disease. Sherlock was fairly sure by now that it was an evolutionary step. In which direction he didn’t know. Clearly, John carried a catalyst and whatever ability came with his mutation. The catalyst had already made an appearance when they met Lestrade but Sherlock still hadn’t found out if John visited him in his dreams or if it was the other way around. Maybe even both.
“More.” He demanded. John complied with care, not wanting to hurt him.
“You are probably right.”
“Looking back, I realize we felt the same way. When you touched my neck, John… It hurt even more.“ At that the doctor squeezed his hand prompting him to turn away from the scene and revert to Baker Street. Standing only a few inches apart, their eyes locked.
Suddenly the press of his knot against the Omega’s entrance got more insistent. Sherlock was moving in waves upon him and John watched the muscles in his back flex and tighten. He let his tongue wander over the crook where neck and shoulder met. Gently nibbling he thrust upwards, getting bolder step by step.
“No.” Sherlock whispered exhaustedly.
John put on the night vision and nudged Sherlock to make him do the same. Everything around him slowly turned brighter and more pronounced. He could see the sand piles and rocks around them with surprising clarity. The last time he had worn this kind of equipment had been long ago and even then John remembered being amazed by the effect it had had.
Slowly, John drew back and looked up into Sherlock's widened eyes. For a short moment, they both studied the other's dilated pupils before John just repeated “Don’t go!” and took a step back, breaking their contact.Sherlock just watched him, obviously deducing John’s innermost feelings and trying to find out what he would do next. His conclusion was proven to be right when John started fidgeting, muttering “I have to think for a while.” and turned to leave. Stepping out of the kitchen, John cast a last glance at Sherlock, giving him an uncertain smile.
“Yeah, right. OK, Martha.” He emphasized uncertainly. Sherlock rolled his eyes but smiled at him nonetheless.
John slid his hand over his cheekbone and smiled at him, reassuringly.
“Alright?” The doctor whispered hopefully.
------------------
When he opened his eyes, John was alone in his room. Exhausted and ashamed, he rolled on his side and fell asleep.
“John.”
“As it would seem.” Sherlock said, his voice lowering to a whisper.
John swallowed and took a deep breath. “I’ll order some take away. Please, put something on!”
“Approximately three times per hour when we are alone. Once every two hours when we are not or in some way busy. Every 4 minutes when we are alone in a cab.”
Handing John his gun, he slowly turned the rotary control on the metal door while focussing on creating a working illusion. Keeping the gap as narrow as possible, Sherlock cautiously pulled the door inwards while John peered out through the widening opening.
Sherlock managed to nod, swallowing around the lump in his throat.
“Yes.”
Since the incident on the stairs, Greg wore an almost predatory expression of intense focus every time his gaze wandered towards Mycroft. It made John grin stupidly as he realized what it meant so without further explanation he gave the two men most of the tablecloths he had found behind the bar and helped them build a makeshift tent in the furthest corner of the room.
John closed his eyes, concentrating on his respiration.
There was no space left for them while hope started to bloom in his chest.
Capturing Sherlock’s lips between his felt way too natural. Supporting his weight with his right arm, John let his left hand card through dark silky curls while tormentingly slow dragging his rigid cock over the pliant body beneath him. Sherlock’s mouth fell open allowing a rumbling moan to escape.
“John.” Sherlock’s quiet voice shook him out of his trance. He blinked his eyes open and saw the Consulting Detective looking at him with wide, surprised eyes.
*****
He watched as Mrs. Phillips was lead out of the door, muttering that she might have mental issues, that Sherlock might have been right with her having a breakdown and that it was for the better if they kept her locked away from others. An awkwardly walking Anderson smiled uncertainly back at John before he closed the door behind himself and they were suddenly alone again.
To calm both their nerves, John brought a plate with biscuits which he placed in front of them.
Sherlock fidgeted uncertainly in the doorway of the bookshop. Maybe he went too far, but he knew what to expect of John. He
*****
“We definitely have to do some experiments on that.” He muttered to himself. Rolling his eyes, John decided to take a shower as well. He was sure that Sherlock had already forgotten about him. He knew he should have been offended but he was so used to Sherlock’s behavior that he found he didn’t mind one bit.
He had to wait two additional days. That meant 6 days in total of Sherlock being tied to the wall and getting “tortured”. Prince James always came alone, a manic grin plastered all over his face and a glint of evilness in his eyes. At first, Sherlock had expected to get hit and punched but that had been the exact opposite of the Prince’s plan.
John was extremely amused. For the great actor he was, Sherlock had never been able to hide his frustration, much less in the last two weeks. John had to admit that it was a bit cruel of him to interrupt every time they were close to coming, but that just wasn’t the way he wanted their first time to happen. He would regret it if they would come into their pants like teenagers and if he was honest to himself, he had needed some time to wrap his head around the idea of sleeping with a man.
“Oh, John, yes. Fuck…There!”
“It’s not surprising that you are always at work the whole day if you need that long for a prostate exam, John.” Sherlock complained, startling the doctor out of his revery. With Sherlock panting in between, it was difficult for John to muster up the strength to be offended. He knew very well that the consulting detective only wanted to get rid of his nervosity and that meant to come to the point rather quickly.
John thought, desperately conveying the message to Sherlock.
“It’s the scent, John. It’s all over this flat.” Sherlock was standing in the doorway of the living room, his dark coat heavy with rain. A puddle of water had already formed at his feet.
“I imagined sitting on top of you, your cock buried deep inside of me. I would be riding you, moving in small waves, while you are touching me all over, moaning my name, begging me not to stop, begging me to go on forever. Oh, John. You would feel so good inside me!”
John’s brows furrowed. “So you are…”
The first blow landed right below his left eye. It hurt like hell but Sherlock managed to remain upright. The second punch was worse. This time he was hit in the rips, all the air leaving his lungs in a sudden rush. He was certain he’d heard something crack. Sebastian pulled his hair painfully, dragging Sherlock off the mattress and to the floor to kneel in front of him.
birthday she took a walk through the Yellow Fields, daydreaming about the fest she would have liked to have had her father not decided to invite the royalty of the adjacent kingdoms.
When Sherlock was done he leant back in his chair seemingly trying to focus on the here and now by blinking rapidly.
“I miss you. I love you.” He shifted into his military stance and quickly turned around. He knew he’d never come back.
John’s eyes had closed of their own accord. As he opened them he looked right into Sherlock’s worried face.
He only got a distracted
Soon, the sticky feeling in his pants and his empty stomach would become problematic, but for now, all was right with the world. At least in the small part of it that was 221 B Baker Street.
He thrust in short vigorous movements into Sherlock’s pliant body. Sweat was forming on his neck and running down his drudging body. But still he could see signs of discontent play on Sherlock’s features. There was no possible way he could go deeper in this position.
He with thee does bear a part.
“Fuck!” John swore, quietly. He didn’t have the strength to stop his hand from stroking. The close proximity of Sherlock’s lips and breath and tongue and…
“John. I don’t want to pressure you but….There is only one possibility that would make me want to stay in a shared flat with you and it would only require one bedroom.” John tensed against his chest, his pulse starting to pound against his neck while he tried to pretend that he had not heard Sherlock.
Greg had been waiting anxiously for the couples return. The minute he heard the automatic lock he jumped up from his seat and ran to the entrance only to find a complete stranger limping through the door. He made to pull his gun, baffled that Mycroft opened the door for an incalculable thread, but he didn't carry it in the bunker and the second after he'd realized he already saw Sherlock coming in with John behind him guarding their back.
“I don’t know anymore about it then you do. I’ve never been in heat. All I know is what mother wrote in her book and as you might have noticed, she didn’t seem too fond of it.”
John let his hands slip from Sherlock’s hold to close his arms around his back.
“Well, the Great Old Ones are mythical creatures that Phillips believed to be real but asleep. Looking back he was obviously wrong, wasn’t he? Anyway, they are said to be very powerful crossings between animals, men, aliens and everything else you can imagine. Not everything at once but always a chimera. Additionally, they exist outside of our time and space. Wrong, too. I found out that Phillips had taken a flight to Shikoku and, going by what I gathered from his various manuscripts, I suspected that he would attempt to sacrifice himself in a ritual to Cthulhu. One of the more famous Great Old Ones. We lost his trace at a water reservoir. At this point, I suppose that Phillips found something before he died and fell into the water. Probably a prehistoric virus that affects the genetic composition and changes important genetic information entirely. Whatever it was he found, it scratched me when I almost fell into a burrow. John managed to pull me up before anything else could happen.” Sherlock concluded dryly.
“Ill. Don’t worry. She’s going to be alright just like everybody else.”
Slowly, John made his way on the bed, kneeling beside Sherlock and taking his hands in his own. He had to say something first.
*****
Sean nodded, clutching Mrs. Hudson’s hand.
Sherlock lay on his bed, muttering about the lack of vicious crimes in his kingdom while he shot another arrow into his closet-door. This one a bit closer to Mandy’s head. He had given her the position of his chambermaid after Prince Sebastian had tragically died.
“Oh, bloody…” Sherlock muttered as he pushed off of him and stopped Mrs. Hudson halfway up the stairs.
Sherlock felt John’s gaze upon his skin as he watched the tentacles move around him. The silk felt cool and smooth against his torso as he tried to turn around. As it had been before, Sherlock couldn’t move. John’s imagination was a heavy weight on his back as he felt his tentacles move to their destined position, holding him fast against the bed. His arms and legs outstretched, his breath hitched at the implication. John didn’t utter a word and Sherlock didn’t need him to. The pressure of the appendixes around his extremities was gentle but decisive when Sherlock felt the second pair caress his upper arms and back. It would have been relaxing had he not known what was still to come. He flexed the muscles in his legs to make John move forward with his explorations. As usual, he could already feel the lowermost tentacle against his thigh. As it idly moved towards his cheeks, Sherlock heard John’s breathing catch. The very tip slid into his crease and began to cautiously press against his entrance. The glossy surface of the pointed limb felt wet and hot and Sherlock couldn’t stop himself from moaning and pressing against it.
“A million things.” Was his honest reply.
“Ce n'est pas possible.” Sherlock was pacing up and down a dark alley. He felt the cold rain running down his face. He was soaked. Shivering, he hugged himself against the bone deep iciness that had overcome his body.
Before he managed to snap back to attention he heard the clink of the blade as it hit the floor.
“I am sorry, I don’t want to...um...embarrass you.” John quietly intervened.
“Time for a massage.” He muttered under his breath as he looked at himself in the mirror..
“Right.” John acknowledged, starting to move as Greg signalled for the others to follow inside.
“Come in.” Sherlock was still fully clothed and felt a bit awkward now that John opened the door and peeked in, cautiously. He watched as John, wearing pajama pants and an old shirt, took in his appearance and stepped in front of the bed.
“You know... I don't mind.” John told his hands. “ Quite contrary.” He added shyly looking up through his lashes.
John was still amused about the massive grin that was returning to Sherlock’s face every few minutes since Mycroft had managed to trip and fall onto the chapped cobblestone, landing flat on his face. Greg had helped him up, trying very hard not to join into Sherlock’s laughter as even Martha’s face lit up mischievously.
John had half a shift at the surgery that day. He despised those short shifts; they felt like a waste of time. Over and above, it was a disgustingly hot day and he was sweating profoundly while he tried to move as little as possible. In his four hours of work he had only two patients of which one was a hypochondriac that was convinced he had a strong flu because he felt weak and hot, all the time. The other one was a young girl with gonorrhea which he immediately sent to a gynecologist.
“Water and crackers. Do you want something else?” He asked considerate.
Agonizingly slow, the tension crept out of John’s body and he sank back onto the bed. He didn’t even manage a fast clean-up before he fell asleep.
Which, in fact, was only one. Self-lubrication. Sherlock’s body was preparing his entrance to get penetrated. That was the logical part of his brain, giving him facts but the lizard part only showed him Sherlock writhing beneath him, crying out his name and begging him to be knotted.
“Is there another one about Omegas?” He asked with forced casualty before he passed Sherlock the book.
Sherlock merely nodded beside him but was watching the doctor's face attentively.
John recognized Mycroft’s voice but couldn’t understand the words. After a minute Sherlock only said “Alright.” and hung up.
“The therapist.”
He begun to thrust in shallow movements up into Sherlock, relishing the tight heat he had never experienced before. He let his head fall back and savored the feeling of Sherlock around him, with closed eyes.
John woke up at four a.m. the next day, thoughtful and restless. Even though he was hungry, he hid in his room until he heard Sherlock leave. Fortunately, he managed to make good use of the 4 hours in between.
and it was no mistake.
Having brought everything necessary with them, Sherlock and John prepared a simple lunch. Dried egg, pulverised cream and chicken straight from the tin were good enough for most of them. Apart from one extremely disgusted member of the Holmes family that let everyone know that food frozen for 20 years was still better than food dried for one day.
Writing had never been as difficult as it was that evening. And never as exhausting.
John’s eyes widened in shock. His mouth hung open and his heart was hammering in his chest.
Shortly before sundown, Prince Sebastian entered his room with big strides. Before Sherlock even knew what was happening, the wild looking man was looming over him, his dirty hair plastered to his forehead.
“Who the hell is this?” He asked agitated, tension making his back rigid and his hands clench.
If asked, Sherlock wouldn’t have been able to explain what it was that appealed to him about wearing John’s name on his skin. Probably because, for a long time now, Sherlock saw John as belonging to him. As being his. So, of course, it just felt right that he was now marked as John’s. If it were anybody else’s initials, Sherlock would have hated the idea of being marked and would probably consider cutting the offending skin off instead of covering it with a different design. But this was John’s mark. John’s claim on him.
Sherlock was still panting but looking up at him in wonder. John tried to kiss the expression away but when he opened his eyes again, Sherlock still looked astounded. Smiling, John cocked a questioning brow.
But tonight when Sherlock showed up while Bill didn’t, he thought that Bill had told Sherlock to go looking for him and where to start. He hadn’t though. How Sherlock had managed to find him without knowing who he was looking for was a mystery to John.  But that would have to be solved later. If a Later still existed for them.
He will help thee in thy need:
“I don’t like this plan, Sherlock.” Martha stated for the umpteeth time, hovering cautiously behind him.
“Not with somebody else.” Sherlock answered between moans. His head was resting on the cushion now as he tried not to look at John pressing his finger in and out in a steady rhythm. When the doctor carefully added a second finger, he pressed back against the moving digits. He knew the burn the stretch caused. He welcomed it. When he indulged on his own like that, he rarely had the patience to let his body get used to it.
“Aaaahhh, fff….” John's cock pulsed while his body bowed with the power of his orgasm. For a second, Sherlock cursed inwardly. He was unable to grab his own cock and finish himself off, being pressed as tight as he was against his flat mate-turned-lover.  His body moved of his own accord, trying to find the desperately needed satisfaction.
“Make me yours, John. Please!” He begged in despair.
John had never felt more content.
John moved restlessly in his chair searching for the right thing to say but it appeared there was none. He didn't want to sound dramatical or even resigned but that was exactly how he felt.
Somewhere in the room below, he hears Sherlock laugh and it makes him smile in relief. That nutter.
“Sherlock?”
The meandering limbs on Sherlock's back were extracting fully now, moving into different directions to press against walls, ceiling and the concrete floor. Carefully, John took hold of Sherlock's wrists bringing them together in one hand before he held them above his head. Not for the first time he felt amazement at the sight of the incomprehensibly long tentacles.
The streets where even more deserted when Sherlock made his way home. He was in no hurry to arrive, already fearing John’s tumbling thoughts echoing through the thin walls but he knew that they’d have to talk eventually. He’d actually expected John to find out for himself what was happening inside their small flat. The changes were so very obvious to Sherlock and with John’s lingering glances on his back and their shared dreams he had assumed that they were just keeping quiet about the whole thing but he had severely underestimated John’s ability to ignore what he didn’t want to see.
“Well. That would be me.” The man,
“John, don’t just stand there!” Sherlock actually whined.
The calling of his name was constant and demanding. John braced himself for an awkward conversation when he descended the stairs to face Sherlock’s decline.

what ?!
Sherlock
drink some water xx
The living room was empty and dark, only enlightened by the thunderstorm that was raging outside. He called for John but there was no answer and when he came out of his room again after putting on some clothes, the flat was still deserted. Sherlock noticed that the sounds of the storm seemed to be coming right out of the hallway. When he stepped out on the staircase he saw that the front door was wide open.
“Non!” He yelled into the darkness. “Mon Dieu, non.” He added quietly.
“Sherlock. Let me turn around.” He said, giving his best to sound soothing and reassuring.
“John.” His name was barely a breath from Sherlock’s lips.
“Anytime.” He drawled.
“You are the best.” Pressing a kiss to her cheek as he passed, John immediately sat down.
House was too big of a word for where they were headed. John could clearly see the sky through the first floor windows of the halfway intact facade. The ground level was pitch black from the outside. He raised his hand to signal a stop and knelt down.
“As you wish, my son. You will not marry this man just yet but I want you to accompany him to his kingdom where you will live until you are ready to get married.” Sherlock’s face fell.
Sherlock sat up, his eyes scanning the room/John/himself. Clearly assessing the situation.
Sherlock fully expects John to have come to the wrong conclusion and considers leaving hints for him. He can only assume what might happen if John doesn’t make up his mind on his own. Trust issues. Fear of being manipulated. Both a bit not good. Nothing would be less futile for their future than John thinking Sherlock was trying to brainwash him into...whatever would come out of it.
“Hng…” Sherlock was beyond coherent thought for a second. Bearing down by instinct only, he managed to nod in agreement as his hands grabbed the headboard to give him more leverage.
John turned around facing Sherlock’s now intense gaze. “In here?” He asked, irritation making his brows rise.
“Too often.” Sherlock conceded. “Will you… Will he ever forgive me? Everything, I mean. Bart’s?”
Wordlessly, John got up and crossed the room. Pulling out four backpacks from a locker in the corner, he
He read Hamlet 14 times in five days. It didn’t help. He didn’t find the answer. With every passing minute, he grew more and more agitated. He had a strong feeling of being manipulated, not a thought that amused him. He had to take things in hand and be the one in control. It wasn’t that hard to find a fitting quote to express his worries and he didn’t even try to use another handwriting. What for? He folded the paper and set it in the same place he’d found the other note.
“Milksop!” He heard himself say. The man’s head snapped up in horror.
John was panting heavily above him. He didn’t seem to mind the faster, more intense pace so Sherlock decided to continue what he was doing.
“Right.” John said with raised eyebrows as they reached the nondescript meadow and lush grass was filling most of his view.
Just as he stepped out on the pavement, coming to the conclusion that even the worst criminals might be evolving, Sherlock ran into an exhausted looking Lestrade. His coat was rumpled and his shoes hadn't been cleaned and polished in at least a week.
“I am not very fond of it either but we don't have a choice.” The heavy backpack was unfamiliar and made him feel slow and rigid.
“Yes, John.” Sherlock said quietly.
He released Sherlock’s legs and watched him scramble backwards up the bed. The Omega shot John an indefinable glance before he turned on his belly.
“I am not going to throw you out anytime soon. There is no need to bond.”
John was watching the crease of the Omega’s arse, observing how the wetness advanced with every thrust of his fingers. It had gradually gotten less while the heat subsided but John decided that there was still no need for lube.
“Is it O.K. for you? That I am here, I mean?”
In the meantime, Sherlock’s tentacles had grown to their full size. Two of them were resting behind him on the mattress while four others stretched to both sides of John’s vision. They were impressive in color and length but their dexterity was still unknown to John. The one tentacle that was still thrusting up into his lover made an idea appear in the doctor’s head.
“Yes.” The doctor sighed, taking the towel from his hand and beginning to dry Sherlock’s hair with it. He had to strain his arms but somehow it gave him a sense of control. The detective’s face was impassive for the time it took John to dry his body completely but as soon as John was done Sherlock pushed him to the side and stepped from the room.
“Probably it means there is a small anaplasmosis that becomes visible when you are in a state of arousal. When did you notice it for the first time?”
John wasn't sure. Tombstones had rarely held a meaning for him. Only once actually. But he nodded.
“One last question, please.” John’s voice carried a trace of fondness that made Sherlock curious. With a nod, he signaled him to go on.
“Of course not!” John assured her. Sherlock had the tendency to state all other possibilities just for the sake of giving the client hope, even though he knew they were a) not true and b) often worse than the truth.
Pointing at Greg and Sean, he signalled for them to guard the door and the stairs leading downwards.
Cautious, the mutant flew close to the ground while keeping a deliberate distance.
Watching himself in the mirror, he undressed unhurriedly. When he was down to his pants he observed the way John’s initials peeked out between his legs and were partially hidden by his underwear. They still made him feel a sense of rightness. Somehow more complete than a week ago. More… just more.
John hadn’t exactly planned to visit Sherlock. A rather frustrating combination of a strange woman in his bed (who called herself his wife) and a strong homesickness for 221b had had him practically fleeing from his flat and wandering the streets at 6 a.m. on a Sunday.
The Omega took heaving breaths while his internal muscles engulfed John.
“No!” Sherlock’s voice rang through the hallway, dripping with petulance.
“Jesus…” He murmured in amazement. Carefully, he let his body fall on its side to bring them in a more comfortable position for the time of their knotting.
'I didn’t think things could get worse.' John thought, resting his hand on Sherlock’s on the railing.
Sherlock just watched him as he put his shoes on and got ready to leave.
He had remained sitting on the couch for an hour before he covered the Omega with a blanket and went up to sleep.
Generalization
The detective began to squirm uncomfortably before he dipped a finger into the mess on his cock and made an annoyed face. Without further explanation he got up from the bed and vanished in the bathroom. Immediately, John heard the water run in the shower.
It only took him three days to figure out who the culprits were and where they would strike next.
John notices it. The looks. The giggles Amy tries to suppress. She's in love. Well, shit! She kisses him with less tongue this time, chaste and almost reverent. John is enjoying it as always but still….There is something missing. He can’t quite put his finger on it, yet, but he already knows. She isn’t the one. They start getting a bit more sensual. He leads her up to his room, kissing her like he means it. He doesn’t.
With his upper body hovering over Sherlock’s and his tummy pressing down on sensitive hardness, John shoved deep into the detective’s tight heat.
“Fucking hell.” John said again. He subconsciously began to drag one finger over his prick while he just stood in the doorway watching Sherlock whose skin was moist with sweat.
Grey eyes immediately focused their gaze on the obvious bulge.
“We should sleep now!”
“Don’t you want to see my back as well?” Sherlock asked confidently. She threw her head around and regarded him for a few seconds.
As he entered the room, Sherlock was sitting in his usual chair, Mrs. Phillips opposite him. Her hair was a mess. Her beige jacket creased and worn. John had a hard time imagining her as the strong young woman he’d first seen in her. Now her appearance reminded him of some of the Bakerstreet irregulars. The ones that did almost everything for Sherlock only to feel useful again.
Enjoying the confining heat of his Omega, John slid in with remarkable control. Eyes closed, he pulled Sherlock slowly onto his cock until he was fully engorged. The new position allowed him to go deeper than ever before. John’s knot was already brushing against the rigid ring of muscles that surrounded his cock.
“It’s not your fault, John. You didn’t know. I didn’t know.” Sherlock said, ignoring the angry woman between them entirely.
John’s mind tried to come up with more than ‘
John closed his eyes, concentrating to feel size and texture of the anomaly. He estimated a size of at least one square centimeter. Definitely bigger than the last time. Cautiously, John pressed the bulge a bit firmer. It didn’t hurt. It felt…good. Wonderful, in fact. A strong shiver ran down John’s stomach and thighs, making his muscles clench and his breath quicken.
Silence stretched between them. Two naked men, looking at each other and trying to find a way to proceed. Sherlock held himself very very still as he watched John’s mind work through possibilities and tactics while the tension left his body bit by bit.
“Right.” John awkwardly agreed. He felt as if something was pressing against his skull from the inside as he squeezed Sherlock’s hand for reassurance.
John raised his hand, perhaps to touch Sherlock, he wasn’t really sure, but he let it fall at his side when Sherlock said, “Don’t. I’m fine!”
“I want to –” John started, but Sherlock interrupted him saying, “There is no need. It’s been already taken care of.”
“Open the door.” Sherlock said.
John nodded. He didn’t tell Mycroft that Sherlock would not forgive him for that. He didn’t tell him that he would have to do more than what he had done so far, that he would have not to be smart, clever but a bloody big brother because Sherlock would need him, more than ever.
One of the men, the one with a thick silver ring on his right middle finger was keeping his head down in the large bucket, pulling his hair.
"In the other room." Greg said and John hated the tone of his friend's voice, the hesitancy he caught in it.
“What’s going on, Sherlock?” Victor asked. He sounded even more tired, and there was pain too in his voice - but he also sounded worried about him.
It was domestic, it was–
Mr Moore handed him the tablet: it was, of course, password protected. He handed it back to the man and focused his attention on Mary again.
“Oh, God…” Molly said.
“I should have told you.” He said eventually.
to be touched.
“We have covered this already, John – no need to be redundant,” Sherlock replied.
“What do I need it for?” He asked – and he heard Sherlock’s almost imperceptible sigh. It was the sound he made when someone said really stupid things; he didn't look at him,  even if he was aware that it might possibly be the last chance he had.
“And this is not a debate,
He was sorry that he had not seen everything before, that he had not thought of the most obvious explanation.
He had promised that he would bring Joan back and he had kept his promise...but William wanted the people behind them, those who had chosen them, who had thought that using Joan to play games with Sherlock Holmes was a good idea. His fingers kept playing with a lock of Joan's hair. He had left civil service for her, to make sure that she would always be safe. He had failed.
“He was there and I was with him when he was examined.” John said.
Mary didn’t answer.
The thing was that William Moore used to be very good at his job. It wasn’t what he had meant to be growing up, that life had sort of swept him on his feet, but that didn’t change the fact that he had been a good operative. And the people he had contacted, the people who owed him favors were the sort of people that no one usually gave a damn about; it was invisible people, small fishes and people who for some reasons always knew everything, despite what their official jobs were. His old acquaintances, his friends were the cogs that let the machine run smoothly.
It didn’t matter. He had talked to his brother, listened to what he had to say, been informed on the few meaningless progresses his people had made. He had not asked anything else. He had not asked him whether he knew what Herman Bennett had whispered to John before he died, what  John had told him before he came back.
William had kept it together. He had refused to leave, and he must have pulled some strings, or called in some favors, because the initial protests from Greg died down quite quickly. William Moore was apparently better than him at obeying orders, because he didn’t protest. He didn’t insist. He didn’t need to tell John anything, he just looked at him: big blue eyes hidden by round spectacles, deep bruise like shadows under his eyes and John knew that the man would follow them, by foot if necessary. The worst thing was that it didn’t matter.
Sherlock looked at him for a moment when they parted, and said, “But don’t think, not even for one moment that I did not want
Mary had done what he had asked her to do, she had made sure that the Holmes brothers were too busy, distracted and weakened when he had needed them to be. She had been an excellent asset, a good partner.
Their behavior wasn’t that different than Herman Bennett’s once he had been caught: foolishly calm, self-assured, cocky.  Herman Bennett had not cared about being caught. The four men who had kidnapped Joan had put up a fight, of course, once he had found them, but they hadn’t been surprised either.
Mary made him sit at a table, thrusting the overnight bag in his arms and went to fetch the coffee, and John thought that he was a rubbish human being, allowing a heavily pregnant lady to bring him coffee – and the thought made him chuckle, and God – he was losing his mind. Mary sat in front of him a few seconds later and handed him a cup of coffee.
"Last I heard he was in Russia." Mr. Neal replied, breaking her train of thoughts.
“Let’s watch them again,” Anderson said.
Sherlock made a noise, something too subtle to be a sigh or anything else, for that matter, but to Greg it was loud and he had to take a breath before saying, “No. Listen to me, Sherlock, I mean it!”
He had many enemies, but he had not realised how many friends he had made through the years, the loyalty of how many people he had gained until a psychopath kidnapped him, thus starting the chain of events that had brought him there.
had had to shut up, after.
He knew it was useless to think about the things he had not done or seen, just like he knew that Molly was reading right through him, at least judging by the look on her face. It was the same look she had on her face while they had coffee and he said something stupid, something she strongly disagreed with. She took his hand in hers, and friends did those things all the time, didn’t they?
He wanted to say something, anything to squash that feeling of dread in the pit of his stomach, but stopped when, for one of those weird, creepy circumstances that made up John’s life with the Holmeses, Anthea knocked at the door and entered the room; she gave a polite nod of her head to both Sherlock and he, and handed Mycroft the yellow envelope they had found on Sherlock’s bedside table. John didn’t want to consider the alternatives – whether Mycroft had known how long it would take for Sherlock to ask for the photographs or, worse, the room was bugged. He really, really didn’t want to think about all of that.
It was about the two of them; it had always been.
William Moore had looked like a grown up version of Harry Potter in the pictures he had seen, but when he entered the kitchenette with Sherlock and finally looked at the man he saw a tall, lean man with bruises on his face, a split lip, red angry signs on his neck and a torn, bloodied grey t-shirt. His hands were steady as he drank from his mug, he noticed that his right forearm was bandaged and blood was seeping through the gauze, and he had stitches on his right temple as well.
“He doesn’t need to.” She said, and she sounded sad – and resigned. Which pissed John off; what the fuck did she think she was doing? Did she think that she was being noble by
different: that day on Bart’s rooftop had happened, he had met Mary, still half mad with  grief and loss and had married her (because she wasn't supposed to be like
Her words had got his full attention, however. Excellent. She was deliberately slow, letting Sherlock see how she shifted her aim from John’s head to his upper forearm.
he could make him regret that he had ever thought he could have
“You – you actually understood my babbling?” He asked. He couldn’t stop smiling.
He smiled. The answer was yes – and he was not truly surprised.
“I know, I’ll see what we can do later, okay?” John said.
“Mr. Holmes is an extremely intelligent man.” David said.
And he thought about Sherlock, allowing him to stay with him during his medical examinations, knowing that he could compartmentalize what had happened to him if he focused on the medical jargon, on the way to cure his physical wounds, but had sent him away whenever he had talked to Greg. He still hadn’t been allowed to get anywhere close to his official statement, it didn’t matter that he had asked for it more than once.
Sherlock had waited a few moments after he had got back to bed, under the covers, and then his body had slid closer and there, for a moment, it had really been just the two of them: cold feet and bad nights and macabre sense of humor,  giving and offering comfort to each other and it had been good.
Photographers were snapping pictures (and John would keep one of them, a newspaper clipping, in a drawer of his desk) and everything was finally, finally real. There wasn’t the ghost of blood on the pavement, of the lack of pulse on Sherlock’s wrist.
They could have killed Molly instead of scaring her, they had wanted them to know that it didn’t matter which measures Mycroft had implemented, which code word Sherlock had said the night before; they were not safe, none of them were.
"No,"  Sherlock said.
Something
She nodded, “I like this yacht. Alas, I am afraid it would be too conspicuous given the circumstances. Would you mind adding it to our deal?”
Mycroft had hidden that photograph, in a show of brotherly concern that had almost moved Sherlock. Mycroft, of course, must have known – and there was no point for John to see that particular image anyway. Sherlock supposed that his older brother had been tempted to hid the others photographs as well, since each and every shot was part of a story, it had been taken in particular moment in time, it had been chosen with care, it had been sent with a purpose.
“Yes, John, pointers to someone obsessed with Moriarty who truly wanted to fuck Sherlock in his honour.” Mary said, “And Sherlock didn’t do a thing to stop him. Not one fucking thing.”
“I really must go.” John said. He didn’t comment on the doctor’s words, but he stuck his card a pocket of his jeans and gave him a curt nod.
that,”
The door had a digital pad, they either needed to bypass the code or they could blow the door up. It was up to Mycroft Holmes to decide.
he’s right here with me
why is everything always my fault
Great
I still can't believe you have a secret brother
Wait,
their love story
For the record, I quite like sober Mycroft, too

A handful of what?

Why do bad things happen to good people

Sherrinford is on there, too.
Sherlock I am literally a cop

“When a Russian man broke my nose...he said that he had just got an idea about how to get Sherlock Holmes’ attention.” Victor replied, “I thought you would find me at first, and then - that you would find my body - pieces of it.”
Sherlock took another step, he turned toward Mycroft and said, “Excuse us for a moment.”
“Define complicated.” He said, but he already had his suspicions.
Sherlock could kiss.
“There are no records about him.” She said after a moment.
He would sell his soul not to have been blindsided by anger.
“You would kill your own daughter.” Sherlock said.
They had never worn rings, it had been too risky, besides – rings could be lost, the tattoos would never go anywhere. He had called her every day, just to hear her voice, they had travelled half the world to spend minutes together – and in the end, a posh bastard who wasn’t even connected with their past had wasted him.
"No." Mycroft said, "I will
“I read John Watson’s blog - and your site,” Victor said, speaking before he could.
Sherlock blinked his eyes and there was a note of genuine curiosity in his voice when he asked, “Would it make any difference?”
didn’t allow himself to have them. John Watson had changed that, he changed him – and Sherlock had changed the army doctor as well.
John didn't trust her, but he still couldn't read through her.
He supposed it made sense, considering how far reaching the people who moved the strings were. Anderson was many things, not all of them good, but he
She had always been good at her job, but that time she had been excellent. That said when she heard the doorbell ringing she couldn’t help being surprised for a moment. She had expected a reaction from Sherlock after the events of that day; it was only logical. She knew what would happen in the next few minutes, yet she took her time finishing to drink her chamomile tea. She rinsed the cup in the sink before going to the door. Things would become quite hectic very soon, but until then she would keep up her façade. It was one of the rules. It was how she had survived.
my word!!
ypu know tge movie FROOZEEN
*hand
It's okay, I kinda like hungover Mycroft
hey, the boys are back
Right?
