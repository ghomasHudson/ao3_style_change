Dean brushes his fingers over Castiel’s cheek, breath warm on his lips. “Well, I think perhaps,” he whispers, breathes, “that my soul gave itself away to you a long time ago.”
Castiel smiles, resting his forehead against Dean’s, breathing each other’s breath. And he doesn’t think he’s ever felt this much calm inside of him, his heart content.
It was the same as last time. It was easier enough to cross paths with Emery in the three days since he overheard the generals in the library. He’d told him of what he overheard, and more importantly of what he’d found – the map he suspected led to the grace. Emery had been shocked and Dean had been more relieved than ever when he unfolded the map and Emery told him the characters did translate to one simple word: grace.
He watches many different kinds of people cross the bridge that passes over the freezing canal – separating the town from the long winding roads that lead out in the farmlands. None are as interesting as the carriage that rolls across not too long after. It certainly stands out.
Castiel holds his eyes, his own open and waiting but whatever it is he’s waiting for he’s not getting it because Dean keeps his mouth clamped shut and finally Castiel’s gaze tears away when Eve introduces him to Christian. They shake hands over the table before Eve calls out to Mark and introduces him with that same –
And even though his birthday is on Saturday, it just makes so much sense to go out and celebrate on Friday night. Beginning at six o’clock.
But they decided that Sam was. That the young prince of the kingdom that destroyed their home, slaughtered their people is worth fighting for.
Because how could his father have this halo they speak of? If he remembers correctly, in his mother’s journal it spoke of the angels holding the halo.
It’s around 7:00 when he passes a few houses and decides that instead of going around he’ll cut through the hospital parking lot. It’s mostly empty, only a few people walking to work, but then again it is a small town. Dean’s so caught up in his own thoughts as he strides across the lot, that he trips over his own feet and goes face first into the cement.
Dean’s knees feel weak, eyes squeezing shut as he opens his mouth because he has to say something, anything.
They spring apart, Castiel shoving Dean hard enough away that he almost tumbles onto his backside but thankfully keeps his feet under him as he whips his gaze over to the man standing in the driveway, dark hair ruffled in the light breeze, big eyes wide and bag in one hand, decked out in scrubs and – Dean’s eyebrows pull together – looking very familiar.
They watch the steam rise until the water cools, nothing else left to say. Their hands holding one another tight, saying it all for them.
He squeezes his eyes shut for a second remembering his father’s last words before he left to pursue his life here at the royal castle.
But like everything else, he won’t push it. They both need to rest. Although, Dean’s sure neither of them will get much.
“I’m sorry, Charlie. But I – I can’t tell you. I don’t want to put him in a position where--” Charlie cuts him off with a dismissive hand.
“The spell,” Castiel says, wondering if the fact that it was the God of Light and not a fallen angel, the God of Darkness and not a demon, is the only thing different to the story he knows.
“Don’t speak until we’re inside,” Castiel says, harsh and upset and the rage curls inside of Dean as he’s pulled along, not understanding what is happening but knowing all the while that Michael is watching them go.
But it’s not like he can say anything. Castiel wouldn’t want any more of him after this bet. He’s made that abundantly clear. And what would his friends say? What would his own
“Standing out can be tiring sometimes,” Emery responds softly and Catharlo nods slowly as if mulling something over.
Castiel blinks. Eternal peace for all souls? Does that mean Leuric wanted all souls to go to paradise? That can’t be right.
Dean doesn’t push it though, he’s not that stupid. And he certainly doesn’t bring up family again, not wanting Castiel to be in a bad mood when they finally get to kiss.
He hears muffled voices of servants from behind the door and quickly pushes himself to his feet. He sniffs, wiping his face with his sleeve – although the tears don’t stop flowing – and makes his way to his bed. His bed. His bed with a proper mattress, already made, and a bed frame made of rich, polished wood.
Castiel closes his own eyes, not giving whoever it is the satisfaction of him bowing his head. And when the keen sound of his cell being opened reaches his ears, he opens his eyes to five guards surrounding the Crown Prince. Castiel narrows his eyes, meeting the prince’s own. He stands still, posture straight with his hands clasped behind his back, watching as another few guards enter Castiel’s cell to get him out. A side glance to the prisoners show none of them daring to look his way.
“What did you mean when you said ‘he tried to have me’?” Castiel flicks his eyes to the ground, his hands clenching into fists. He can’t speak – can’t will his mouth to form words. But he doesn’t need to – Dean does it for him. “Did one of them…try to rape you?”
"Yeah, somehow I'm getting the vibe that this game is fucking rigged," Dean says, voice harsh. Castiel grunts sitting himself in the furthest corner of the closet which by the time Dean sits down, is only a few inches away from his friend because of course the one time they're fighting they have to be stuck in the smallest closet possible.
Dean sighs above him and Castiel barely has time to even lift his head before Dean is bending down to grab his arm. “Come on. Let’s get you to your chambers,” he says, voice tired.
“Alright, enough of this!” Nyree snaps, finally lifting Castiel’s head and there’s something fierce in her eyes. “Michael, go to your cabin. Now.” Michael doesn’t even bother fighting her, merely turning and leaving without another glance in their direction. “Dean, get Castiel inside the cabin and keep him warm until the tub and water arrives. I will have no more training until we all meet again and speak of what is going on here.”
But finally, he shrugs. “Whatever. If that’s what you want. Shoes off, though.” And then he’s turning and heading up a set of stairs, Dean scrambling to pull off his boots and following after him as soon as he gets his dick to chill the fuck out.
Through the open door, Castiel watches, breath caught in his throat as the guards glance around William's chambers before finally heading back up the stairs. There is a loud shut and a minute or so passes - Castiel not daring to let go of Dean’s hand - followed by the sound of what he guesses is William and Charlie racing back downstairs.
“Reyne. It’s good to see you.” And he’s being truthful. They didn’t cross paths all that much before but when they did, Reyne was always kind and easy to gravitate to, with him only being a few years Castiel’s elder. But even so, he still feels the air tense around him. After all, it is still another person he has to face after failing his mission.
Dean pauses for a moment, watching the way Castiel’s eyes gaze over Dean’s family photo. “Sounds nice.”
The disappointment only festers when they arrive back at camp and are split into two groups – Castiel’s heading off to eat dinner whilst his own unpacks all the supplies from their own bags.
Dean’s lips are soft compared to the light graze of rough stubble that Castiel can feel on his skin. It’s Castiel’s first kiss and it’s better than he could’ve ever imagined. When they pull back to breathe, Dean rests their foreheads together before speaking.
“Would you have left me there?” Dean asks, the words slipping from his tongue before he has a chance to catch himself.
He considers ignoring the prince and standing up himself. But Dean’s lips are already turned down so he takes it. He pulls him up with more force than Castiel was expecting and he finds himself standing only inches away from Dean, their chests almost touching.
Dean sets his jaw, not letting his eyes flick away from Castiel's gaze. "Yeah. Try. Because if you didn’t get the memo this is supposed to be a date. And you haven't said two words nor looked up from your phone for more than three seconds this entire time."
Somehow, impossibly, the stone slab shifts. Backwards at first. The three of them step back as they watch it, slow but surely moving to the side into some slot perfectly calved out for it.
"I swear, I saw one. We have to tell the captain," he says, an urgency in his own voice that he doesn't recognise. He's never thought of himself as being afraid of the angels. But that empty, emotionless face… Nicolaus doesn’t think he's ever been more terrified in his life.
“Okay, guys, so I’m gonna turn this off for a sec cause I’m nearly there. But I’ll bring it back up as soon as I reach my destination and be prepared cause if you think I’m cute then you obviously haven’t seen my partner.” Dean says, and with a quick wave the video finishes and Castiel hears a collective groan throughout the classroom.
The walls are a nicely painted blue, with a rumpled bed pushed to one side, an open closet on the other and a desk and bookshelf side by side beside the door. It’s pretty clean, not as clean as Dean’s room – although no boy’s ever is – a few papers and clothes thrown here and there.
Leda greets Sam the same before eyeing Castiel – who stands with his hands behind his back and posture as straight as board. “And who’s this?” she asks, and the slight uptilt to her voice has the good feeling in his chest at seeing her again slowly dissipate.
Out of instinct, he reaches out hand. Dean stares at it and suddenly Castiel feels self-conscious wanting to pull away but instead he clears his throat and says, “C’mon. You need to get up and walk around or else you won’t warm down properly.”
Not that it’s Dean’s fault. Castiel was the one who couldn’t handle the pressure of their relationship. It’s not Dean’s fault that he’s a handsome and kind celebrity loved by millions and Castiel is just…plain, boring, unattractive Castiel. He just wasn’t enough. And after everything Dean did for him. Like coming out to the entire world wasn’t enough to prove how much he cared about Castiel.
"I have -- oil." Castiel's breath stutters and he clamps down on his own lip with his teeth as Dean slips his hand from his knee and palms it down onto Castiel's clothed already hard cock. Dean swears under his breath, raising himself up to stare down at Castiel as he takes a moment to gather himself.
There’s movement over his shoulder and she flicks her eyes to the end of the alley to find two women passing by. She inhales all the breath she has, ready to scream her loudest scream in hopes it will grab their attention when the man in front of her finally opens his mouth.
“The leaders of the angels, of Iowan, they were the only ones who knew where the grace was. It was rumoured they had a secret map that only they knew of - something that after the war was confirmed true - passed down from the two brothers to the then leaders of Iowan just as the location for the wings and halo were. It was said they decided not to pursue the grace. Despite the safety of Iowan from the demon, they thought that if anything did happen, having all of the Three, would be dangerous.” Castiel pauses. “It appears they were right.”
But from the look of it he doesn’t need to worry. Leda’s hand is on his shoulder now and their hands are clasped together. Castiel’s frowning in concentration but Dean can see the apprehension still in his eyes as Leda teaches him some steps.
“The grace,” Emery says, excited now that they could truly be upon it. None of them had spoken of it. But he’s sure all of them had their doubts that it would be here.
“Nah, don’t be sorry. C’mon let’s go.” Dean says quickly, before turning and bounding down towards the Impala where Sam and Jess are patiently waiting inside.
Just as he turns, there is commotion behind him and someone calls Sam’s name. They both turn to find a woman, tears in her eyes, an escort behind her.
Dean snorts before he can stop himself and Castiel’s gaze tears away from Mary to land on him. “Oh, really,” he says, not even trying to hide his sarcasm.
“Excuse me? Can I just whisk him away for a sec?” Dean asks, slipping a hand around Castiel’s waist.
Castiel raises an eyebrow before his eyes teasingly slow, descend to his crotch, staring there a moment or two as Dean flushes before he flicks his eyes back up. “Hmm, no, twenty is plenty enough time.”
If he could take Dean with him, he would. But Dean’s not just going to leave this all behind. His home, his brother, his friends. Even his father.
Castiel also saw him once more sitting at a café with what looked like a few friends of his. He had been walking by when he'd spotted Dean. Dean had spotted him back a few moments later and shot him a smile. Castiel had embarrassingly given him a small wave before walking faster and out of sight of the boy.
Dean flushes, hand rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly. “Oh. I just thought because you stopped posting on Instagram that you must have been preoccupied with better things.” Even as the words are coming out of his mouth, he hears how ridiculous it sounds. But even more ridiculous than he thinks apparently, for Castiel smiles wide, shaking his head.
But the way Dean touches him and holds his eyes – more so than usual now too – he can’t let that go. It seems whenever he can get the chance he’s helping Castiel up by the hand or checking the gash on the side of his head with light fingers pressed to his jaw. And it’s not only that he doesn’t want to retreat away from Dean but he can’t. The prince is the only thing grounding him. But he needs to pull away. Before it’s too late.
A hand is light on his lower back. “Cas?” The name slips from Dean’s lips as a whisper. Another thing that has changed over the fourteen summers. From Castiel to Cas – something Castiel himself has quite liked – and another thing he finds soothing much like Dean’s voice.
“Punished him? This?” His father points at Castiel’s face. “You can’t even be responsible for his punishment. I thought that was what you wanted. More responsibility. More freedom to make your own decisions.” Dean swallows but keeps his mouth shut. “Well, I’ll give it to you. I’ll give you more decisions. You have a choice between your guard spending three nights in the dungeons for not doing his duty or we’ll take all that money we just so generously gave to the mayor and punish him instead.”
“Oh, ever the romantic, Prince Dean.” Dean rolls his eyes. Leda smiles, her eyes falling on Castiel. “It
Catharlo’s eyes are wide when he pulls away, disbelieving, a hand raised to his lips as if what just happened was not real.
But Castiel touches his fingers to his cheek, the warmth flowing through as Michael’s wounds heal. His brother blinks, the blood still marring his face but he knows what Castiel has done. He would feel it.
“Oh, uh…” Dean starts, pulling out the sheet the professor handed out. “I was looking at the third one.”
"That's okay. Don't worry about it," he responds, raising his voice a little over the party noise as the boy goes to sit down on the floor, back against the wall.
“Right,” he mumbles. A minute passes in silence as Dean fiddles around with the supplies in the basket and Castiel sits motionless in the water, back to staring at his knees.
Dean’s mouth is suddenly dry. “Nothing. I texted my friends after the movie finished so they’ll probably already be outside your house when we get there.” Castiel had given him his address the night before which he’d then passed on to his friends and Dean was surprised by how close to the university it was.
He makes sure none of the coins in the lady’s purse have fallen out before walking back to hand it to her. “My apologies for the damage,” he says, handing the purse over. The lady blushes, taking it from his hands.
The man topples to the side and Dean wipes his face to find Michael standing above him, surveying for any danger around them.
If he was anywhere else, the tears would not stop until there were no more left to shed. All he can do is clutch tightly back, press his face further into her neck and imprint the words in his mind until it’s all he can remember.
And he would snipe at him if he was Seb coming back or Brady riding his ass but he’s never been able to get mad at Cillian. He doesn’t think anyone has.
“I…” Dean’s tongue darts out, wetting his lips. That desire is present in his eyes again but they’re mostly filled with hope and anxiety. “We don’t have to.” Castiel swallows. “I just thought maybe…but if you don’t want to--”
"Oh, I was just meeting a friend for lunch in the city." Dean pauses, looking up to most likely see whether they're near their stop or not yet, before going on. "Hey, I was gonna come down to the bookshop tomorrow. You got any recommendations for me?"
Dean and Sam have all their belongings with them. Castiel is the same. They have no reason to head to camp with the others.
Castiel ponders lying. He supposes it doesn’t matter anyway. “My companions and I are planning to head up there.”
Dean narrows his eyes, waiting for her words. “I said what happens if he is killed in your invasion, in your forged war? I had their attention then,” she says but Dean’s eyebrows pull together not sure as to what she is getting at. She must see an inkling of it in his eyes for she goes on. “You see I learnt much over those years with the king and queen. I was spoken to about many private things. Including things regarding this world and ways in which it could be righted when the prophesied came. They themselves did not entirely understand everything but one thing they knew for sure was that if the prophesied took upon any of the Three – if they died, if Castiel died, all would die with him and be lost forever.”
“You can’t sit there,” Dean says, but his words are empty. He’s too tired to get angry. That will come later.
Two other prisoners sit huddled together in the far corner, eyes wide. Castiel takes a step towards them, his chain restricting him from going any further, but one of them still flinches.
“Call for the guards if you change your mind and would like to talk. I’m sure your brother would appreciate it,” the king says, before following the guards out the door and with a final grind on stone it pulls shut, leaving Dean alone in the cold, dark cell with nothing but his own imagination.
Lady Alia leans forward slightly, lowering her voice as she says, “Are not in a proper married relationship. And I respect that of course,” Her eyes flash to Castiel once more, “but if it’s the case, shouldn’t you be allowed to find pleasure elsewhere, Your Highness?”
“Don’t let anyone see you,” the king says, his voice seeping into Dean’s ears. “When he is secure search him and then his chambers. Find his guard and have him stationed outside but tell him not to enter. The crown prince is terribly ill and will remain in his own chambers until further notice. I will deal with this mess.”
Something presses at the back of his mind though. A face, a voice but it drifts away like ash in the wind and Dean shakes his thoughts away.
“Don’t touch me,” he says, and the hurt is clear in his voice. Castiel stares at him, swallowing around the sudden lump in his throat.
But Castiel appears to once more snuggle a little closer to Dean throughout the night and Dean thinks that if they were somewhere else, just the two of them, that he would wrap his arm around Castiel, pull him close and kiss him.
Strangely, a small smile pulls at Castiel’s lips. “Unfortunately, in the angel’s religion everything balances out. Gods of light and of dark. Angels and demons. Good souls and bad souls. When the angel closed the doors to the underworld, the doors to paradise closed too. Balance. Except for one small thing. Since it was an angel that did the spell, the demons were trapped inside the underworld but retained their powers. The angels, however, were not trapped inside paradise. They fell to earth. And in doing so, lost their powers. It’s why it was deemed the great sacrifice. Because to save their beloved and all humans condemned unjustly, the angel had to condemn their kind to earth. To strip them of their angelic essence and leave them human."
So, this is it. This is what it’s come to. Dean threatening to throw him in the dungeons for life – maybe even have him hanged for something he didn’t do.
One glance shows, Cillian’s car is still parked across the road, the three boys still inside. He sees vague movement through the dark windows – the three of them probably excited the waiting is finally over.
"--we can just forget about all of this and I'll even hunt down Grindr man and tell him what happened and you don't--"
“You used to wear bands on your arm to symbolise who you were,” Castiel says. “But they didn’t tell the truth of you. I want you to have something to wear that symbolises the truth.” Castiel swallows, eyes bright. “My truth.”
He sighs before saying, “I will try my best to argue for punishment of Nicolaus but it’s unlikely anything will come of it.” Castiel nods, understanding. He didn’t have any hopes up for it anyway. The only thing to come of it is that his body is now more on alert than ever for Nicolaus and his friends.
Before he can even take a breath, Castiel is on him, locking him in so he cannot escape and he feels all of it, the rage, the terror, the grief burst as he raises a fist and hits Michael hard.
“Of course. Rest up for now. If you’re hungry don’t be afraid to head straight back to the kitchens. If you would like hot water for a bath, Castiel will know where the people are in charge of that.” Dean nods in thanks. “And there’ll be a celebration tonight. Stay for however long or little you would like. We all know that you are tired and terribly overwhelmed. No judgements will be made here. I will see you, then.”
, he thinks – he reminds himself. Because Castiel might not want this. And if that’s the case then he doesn’t mind – he won’t push him, certainly not after all Castiel’s been through. And especially with Charlie’s words in his head.
“Gabe!” Castiel shouts, quickly reaching out and pulling the curtains across his window and slamming his notepad down on his desk.
Dean nods jerkily, his hands beginning to shake now as they get closer to their destination, as Dean gets closer to knowing if Sam truly is still alive.
There’s that mischievous twinkle in his eye before he strolls away and Castiel’s left a bumbling caught out mess for everyone to see.
Dean reaches for it when it flies up to him. On the balloon is a note. A tear finally falls down Dean’s face and he lets out a small chuckle. It’s the exact same note that Dean had written to the blue eyed boy on the second day that they had met. They only difference is one word.
It feels like the moment has spread on forever and suddenly Dean can hear the sound of heavy breathing and feel the warmth of it on his own cheek.
He identifies where they are going before they get there. The kitchen. A glance out a window as they pass through the hall and Castiel sees the sun high in the sky. It must be midday already.
He lets the dagger drop from Sam’s throat and Dean doesn’t allow his body to crumple in relief. Doesn’t allow him to step forward or cry or scream.
He holds a pebble in his fingers, showing it to the children. He then takes the pebble and rubs it together between his hands before holding both palms up to reveal the pebble has disappeared. The children gasp. Castiel starts to speak, Dean unable ot hear from this distance, but he’s leaning down towards Leda’s younger brother and suddenly reaching into the boy’s breast pocket where he pulls the pebble out and holds it for all to see. Sam claps his hands furiously while one of Leda’s sister’s shrieks. The other two just sit in awe. Castiel bends at the waist with a smile – but it’s once again, not genuine, only polite. Dean knows by now what is and isn’t a genuine smile.
Castiel feels a slight swell of emotion inside of him. “I’ll see you soon, mother.” And then she is out the door, leaving him with his father.
“No, no, I can’t do it without you, Dean, I can’t,” he cries, opening his eyes to meet Dean’s gaze again.
Dean takes a deep breath, the fear gripping his throat and almost crushing any words from ever exiting his mouth. “I didn’t escape. I was captured. And I already told you. We were kept in a cell, somewhere near water.”
“I’m going to ask you a few questions and you’re going to answer them,” he says, voice perfectly calm but his eyes still don’t stray from the knife. “And they may not believe me when I say you’re an angel but they will believe me when I say you tried to kill me.”
He stares at them for a long while, hiding the screen away from Dean so he can’t see and Dean can’t entirely make out the expression on his face in the darkening cinema but it’s sad. Castiel stares a moment longer before shutting his phone off entirely and slumping back in his seat and Dean’s heart sinks, cursing whoever this ex is that’s made Castiel so upset that he looks as though he isn’t going to enjoy one minute of their night together.
It’s only after a good night’s sleep on a proper bed that he realises how much he stinks of sweat and blood and dirt.
Dean grunts, mouth falling open, their breath mingling together. The hand cradling his face slides down until it caresses his thigh, hitching it higher and with a few deeper thrusts, Dean hits something inside of him that has a muffled moan leaving his lips and his stomach curling tighter and his cock aches, throbbing between their bodies.
"Well, you know now. And I'm sorry I ruined your date with a guy that is no doubt a million times better than me and probably wouldn't act like such a jealous dickhead and--"
His little moment is cut short, however, when the doorbell rings. He grins, stepping back inside and passing the vibrant tree in the living room, colourful presents stacked underneath waiting to be opened after lunch.
Victor’s mouth drops open and Michael laughs loudly as Castiel watches bewildered as he continues to run his hardest around the bend. He didn’t mean it literally.
“What do you mean, it’s not working,” Dean says, voice breaking, tears glimmering. “You fixed me, Cas. You brought me to life. Why can’t you just heal yourself? Why can’t you just--”
"Sam, what's outside?" Dean asks. Sam hesitates as his eyes finally catch onto the blood at the bridge of Dean’s nose but he doesn’t ask.
Dean’s raising the glass to his lips when Castiel’s hand shoots out and he only intends to lower the glass but instead knocks it out of Dean’s hands where it spills all over Dean’s trousers and onto the lavish rug below.
But he has to start somewhere. “I can’t do it,” he says, and Dean’s eyes, if anything, fill with more worry. But Castiel shakes his head. “I can’t keep getting up everyday and facing it all. That day when Michael went missing, I found him.” Something flashes across Dean’s eyes. Perhaps he remembers. “He was giving up. Just like that. And it hurt more than anything he’s ever done to me. Because he was the one all these years that made sure I knew I couldn’t give up.” Even now he feels it, pressing in on all sides, trying to collapse him completely. He wants to let it. He wants to close his eyes and not wake. But… “And yet there he was. So, I made him a deal. He helps me figure this out as quickly as possible – working my powers, defeating the demon. Through whatever means necessary. And then when it’s all over, I’ll never have to see him again.”
He notices the looks Dean spares him. The looks asking for more, although he never asks Castiel, waiting instead. And Castiel will tell him. Soon. Once they get closer to the forest. He would rather Dean process what he already knows first. If Castiel was in his place, he wouldn't have retained half the information Dean has over the last week. Not just from sheer shock of it all, but with the sheer amount as well.
Castiel has to steady his breathing as the castle rises up in the distance. It was difficult to say the least facing Michael after revealing that he had found practically nothing. His brother upon hearing the news, however, had barely flinched. He probably already knew, especially since news of Castiel becoming Dean’s personal guard wasn’t exactly kept a secret. But Castiel could still see it in his eyes. The disappointment. It was Castiel’s decision to go in this way and he will have to find a way around it.
It wasn't the worst of his experiences so far playing this game. But over the last months it certainly hasn't been his best.
"It's okay, Cas. I'm fine," Dean says breathless, an edge to his voice as he crushes himself forward, hand slipping under the waistband of Castiel’s undergarments and smoothing down the bare side of his thigh and that's enough. He grabs Dean's hand by the wrist, stopping it in its descent and with the other gets Dean at an arm’s length so he can't keep pressing forward.
“Oh,” she says with a smile, always happy to be of service. “Is it on the same topic?” He blushes harder.
“Some of the angels tried to hunt them down for what they’d done. They were renamed the fallen angel but not because they had fallen from paradise but because they had fallen in love with a mortal – something deemed as crime. So, the angel and the two brothers fled and as they did they found out that the rest of the angels were not the only ones hunting them. One demon still remained on earth, scouring the land in search of the ingredients to the spell that would reopen the doors to the underworld. It shouldn’t have been possible. The spell should have sucked all demons on earth back through the portal to the underworld.”
The emptiness inside of him lulls, allowing a spark of something to slip inside and Castiel reaches for it, warm and comforting despite that all familiar ache returning. Because while the emptiness is easy, there’s nothing more terrifying. For it wasn’t the pain but the hollow nothing inside of him that took up that dagger and pressed it to his skin.
Dean’s steps are loud behind him though and he’s just opening the door to his own personal chambers when he sees Dean in the hall.
And Castiel grits his teeth as hard as anything, slicing more and more until Patrus’ body is covered in small wounds, red seeping from them until he thinks that’s enough.
They arrive at the spot a little while before the sunrise, everyone taking a seat on the grass and pulling breakfast out of their packs. Dean and Castiel sit behind the girls, knees nudging as they munch away at muesli bars and trail mix.
“Oh, it’s you.” He rubs a half-hearted hand over his face. “I must have closed my eyes for a second and drifted off,” he says, voice strained and barely meeting Castiel’s eyes.
"God, Cas. Like I want to hold your hand and kiss you and do other inappropriate things to you and do all that romantic sappy crap, okay?" Castiel feels a dark blush rising up his jaw at Dean's words and suddenly it's all incredibly real. But…
He wouldn’t be lying if he said he wasn’t slightly intimidated by him. He’s got the height and he’s almost certain he could take him in a fight but with the way Castiel holds himself, like the world could fall into disarray overnight and he’d still just sit there reading his stupid fucking book, paired along with those piercing blue eyes – well, it’s hard not to feel intimidated. Despite it though, and all the pretty awful stories he’s heard, Dean’s always had kind of a crush on him. Well, at least the R rated kind of crush. Not like his crotch ever had standards anyway. But at least his heart does, thank Christ. He could never fall for a cheater. Not in a fucking eon. Especially after what happened with his first girlfriend. He wonders how Castiel even got that way in the first place.
He couldn’t even close his hands over his throat. Couldn’t even attempt to squeeze the life out of him. Because all he saw were those pained, teary, blue eyes staring up at him. The blue eyes that had his heart fluttering in his chest, unable to look away. The blue eyes that stared right through everything and saw him – truly saw him. The blue eyes he fell for.
Dean jerks to his feet. Nothing makes sense and yet it's all falling together. But he needs to move now. He can't waste any more time. Because if it's true, if his father is his father no more then the only thing standing in this
“Gabe, he’s not my man crush! And hurry up and get out!” Castiel replies, glaring at his older brother.
He sees them bickering back and forth. Sees Dean carrying him to the bathing tub, cleaning him himself. He sees them kissing, Dean pressing him up against the door. He sees Dean beating him, wings splayed out for the first time.
But Michael’s not finished. One last dagger in his belt – this one real, not wooden – is in his hand suddenly and he’s throwing it towards Castiel just as he jumps--
The bed is a welcome reprieve from cold stone despite Dean’s touch and warmth disappearing. His body is too heavy for him to even sit himself up and look as to where Dean’s gone but he is able to hear a quiet murmur of conversation between Dean and someone else before the door is lightly clicked shut.
Castiel doesn’t flinch. “We are both the same, aren’t we? Just because you were born in a castle doesn’t make you any more special.” He walks off before Dean can reply.
It always feels special when he comes out here. And with Castiel standing there, head craned up to the stars, a small, sad smile tugging at his lips, he can’t help but feel that it’s even more special tonight.
“He told me about you too. Said you were a good man. And an excellent fighter just like your father.” Catharlo shoots him a small smile but Emery just continues to stare at him, eyes narrowed as though trying to figure out if he really can be trusted.
They say their goodbyes to Sam and Leda, Dean telling them he is tired from rising so early to train and that he might fall asleep right on the very ballroom floor if he stays any longer. Castiel observes the way he charms himself out of staying, everyone in his mere prescense smiling up at him as he passes.
When he lowers Michael into the grave, he stands staring for a moment before he shovels the dirt back in.
Dean sits a littler straighter. “And then they bet me I couldn’t get a kiss. And, well… I think you know what else.” And as he says it, he thinks how could his friends possibly believe he would do this to someone? Even if that someone is supposed to be a cheater. Sure, he was up for the first bet but that was because he was certain he would lose.
Sam looks at him as though he's stupid. "Castiel. I think he loves you too." Dean stares at his little brother, swallowing around the sudden emotion that rises in his throat.
.” Castiel’s face crumples slightly as he tries to hold back the sobs that sit heavy inside of him. And he’s exhausted now. Can feel it in the way his body aches to let him fall.
He’d panicked. He’d run over, frantic, wondering where he could have gone. Michael had said he would be fine. He always was.
She swallows, eyes forward once more and quickens her pace. Not far from home now. Only a few blocks although she’ll have to turn off the main street at some point. She quickens her pace even more at the thought, her heart racing a little faster in her chest. It’s not like she’s never walked home in the dark before or had some foul, drunken man try to follow her but this doesn’t feel like that.
And it looks as though they’re arguing with each other but Dean can’t hear what they’re saying over the loud thumping of music coming from inside the pub from where he’s standing frozen at the entrance to the carpark.
“Innocent?” Dean eyes widen in disbelief. “Those people have been bleeding us dry of coin for years. The amount of times we’ve tried to help them and it’s lead to nothing--”
So, he starts with what happened after she disappeared. The lies that were told, the brutality that was taken out upon the angels. Then he speaks of this man that came to his castle in chains, imprisoned inside a pig pen.
He doesn’t even think about it, his legs carrying him to the far end of the castle, passing few servants and guards as he goes – many glancing his way but none stepping forward to ask why Dean Winchester’s husband is wandering the halls alone when he should be attending a ball.
When Dean meets Charlie’s gaze, she looks sad. She’s always been sympathetic. He supposes it’s because she knows a certain suffering. She lost her parents not three years ago. They had been travelling to Tavill to visit an old friend as Charlie stayed behind to manage the pub. They never made it, crushed under a rockfall in the Farlee Mountains. Only their guide survived, living to tell her of the sad news.
Those words. So familiar. The same words that he pleaded at his father with. That he told himself over and over.
Students from other classes seem to be out in the hallway as well. They all line the hall, their phones out trying to take pictures or film the man who is wandering down the hall.
“Yeah, that’s fine,” Dean mumbles in return, thoughts still on what it is he might have said before. Castiel eyes him warily.
But in the furtherest corners of his mind, he knows he’d never be able to. He’s fallen too hard. He won’t ever be able to forget that. And there are still too many things conflicting. Like why Dean would make love to him. Why he would cry tears over him. Why he wouldn’t have just let Castiel fall off that cliff to his death below.
“I suppose it is my turn,” she says. Dean nods, and with a deep breath of her own, she tells her own story.
Sam breathes deeply where he’s curled up against Dean, under a sheet to protect them from the rain. The horse he carved at the Fletcher manor is held tightly in the boy’s hands. It wasn’t much but Castiel saw it in the cabin and took it, hoping something familiar might be nice to have in his hands once more. The rain has tapered off to a drizzle now, many things flying through Castiel’s mind.
Not that it didn’t have Castiel wide awake and petrified for those long three nights. And it hasn’t seemed to have left him even since the guards safely handed over the gold and escorted him away from the bandits.
“The halo,” he mutters, before disappearing and stepping back out before the pit. He focuses harder now and notices the light of the grace illuminating its own symbol behind it, etched on the wall.
Castiel furrows his eyebrows, thinking for a moment. He hasn’t properly celebrated his birthday since he was ten. The last year with his parents. “Twenty years.”
But despite the strange start, Castiel doesn’t hesitate before launching straight into the assignment and much to Dean’s surprise they work well together, bouncing ideas and questions off one another without any preamble, a process that’s always slightly awkward.
“I have a confession to make,” he says softly, and his cheeks are burning when he meets Dean’s eyes. “I don’t like camping.”
He hears a shout behind him but doesn't look back. The leader must have gotten back up but there's no way he can outrun Castiel. He zigzags in and out of the crowd, a few more cries and screams erupting from the people as he flies by. He pumps his legs faster, leaping over a few crates sitting on the street outside an inn before taking a harsh turn down into another alleyway. He's halfway down when he hears footsteps behind him.
Castiel steps forward and takes his own seat when he realises Dean’s not going to meet his eyes. But he doesn’t reach for any food. They sit in the quiet on either side of the table, Castiel observing Dean but Dean only focused on the knife he twirls in his hand.
So, he doesn’t know why he says, “Then why’d you do it? Why’d you go along with it?” Maybe just to say something.
"Sure thing. I look forward to it." Dean leaves with a wink and Castiel stares after him for a minute too long before he gathers himself and gets back to work.
Castiel knows he shouldn’t have done what he did. But he’s impulsive. He knows that. And it’s a weakness that Michael punished him for many times, although, Castiel knows deep down that the reason for his impulsiveness is because of Michael in the first place.
They’re missing one in the kitchen this year, however, Mary usually with the three of them. But since Samuel and Deanna moved further out into the suburbs, it’s a longer drive for his parents to collect Henry and Millie, so Dean drove over by himself in the morning after passing by the local seafood shop to collect their order of prawns to help out as he always does.
“What?” Dean whips his head towards his brother, eyes wide. Has he been staring? Are they suspicious of him?
Dean raises his eyebrows. He hadn’t yet had time to wonder what his mother does around here. “You work in the gardens?”
“No. My shift has changed. I’m now supposed to serve dinner to the prisoners tonight.” Emery’s eyebrows raise, amusement clear.
“However, not all went as you hoped, did it?” Castiel holds his eyes, unflinching. “No matter, you got there nonetheless. Now,” Michael says, taking a step closer, eyes glinting in the light. “Tell me everything.”
Neither of them speak through the ads, Dean not knowing what to say – not knowing if Castiel wants him to say anything – before suddenly the movie is starting and they’re descended into the dark.
"They know," Castiel says, and Charlie's hand covers her mouth as she takes in his battered body. "They know everything."
She seems to brighten when Dean subtly mentions it. She’s told him before that having that part of herself acknowledged, even if it’s only by him, helps.
As he makes his way towards the gardens, his throat is tight, not only wondering if he has made the right decision with Sam in mind but thinking of how little time he has spent with his mother since they’ve been reunited – so busy and tied up with Castiel and the mission – and wondering how much it will hurt to be ripped away so soon.
They sit like that for a while, breathing finally returning to normal when he lifts his eyes to find Castiel’s half closed but still watching him, that blush still staining his cheeks. And there’s still something there – a fire in those blues eyes – for he leans down to kiss him once more, rough and gentle somehow all at once before he pulls away and rests his forehead against Dean’s.
Another ball comes upon them only a quarter of a moon after the last one. It’s a much smaller ball, however, only involving the generals and nobles – and their respective families – that hold land under the king.
Mary stops them after a while, gesturing to what must be her own. It’s a small one in the second row – most likely a single cabin.
In one long gulp, Dean downs the rest of Benny’s beer before handing it back to his friend and then storming off through the crowd.
They spark a fire soon after they're dressed and everything is fitted. Castiel throws his own clothes in first, no hesitation. Dean stares at the emblem on his jerkin, brushing a finger over the fine pattern. Isn't this what he's always wanted? Not a prince. Not a royal. Not King Winchester's firstborn son.
Dean doesn’t hesitate after he’s down to only his undershirt and undergarments to climb onto the bed and sink into the mattress. Castiel dresses down to his trousers and undershirt – not wanting to have to hurry to dress if anyone decides to make an unannounced arrival – before crawling in beside Dean, the mattress a blessing after the last few nights on the ground.
Castiel, Dean, Benny, Victor and Michael are the last to leave, trailing out the door and into the nice cool air. The boys all wish him a goodnight and head off to the parking lot but Dean stays standing beside him, hands shoved in his pockets and swaying slightly after those beers.
“I asked if everything is alright?” Castiel’s eyes are narrowed, his eyebrows raised. Dean’s throat constricts.
But he knows in his heart as he looks down at the young boy wrapped around him, that the pain was all worth the…almost family he made out of it.
He pulls a small nail that he’d picked from the floorboards out of his pocket, along with a dagger. Jamming both of them into the keyhole, he jiggles them around for a few seconds before the door clicks open. He waits for moment or two, eyes fixed on the light coming in under the doors before pushing them quietly open and slipping into the king’s chambers.
He turns his nose up at the smell, rolling his eyes and walking over to the slit in the stone to breathe in some fresh air. The first roar of thunder sounds and the other guard's voices behind him fade into background noise.
Leda leans against his side where they sit in the fields, head resting on his shoulder, hand intertwined with his.
The details are easy. Dinner at seven thirty at a nice Italian place in town. Tonight. In half an hour. And Castiel’s still staring at himself half undressed in the mirror. He contemplates calling his sister who has always been good at this kind of thing but doesn’t want to get her excited at the prospect of him having a date – because that only would lead to her subsequently telling the whole family and then his parents calling him wondering about when the ‘moving in together’ party is going to be.
He can hear the pounding of his heart inside of his skull. Dean stays silent for a moment but he finally speaks. “Look, Cas. I’m sorry, but I’ve had a crush on you for a while now and I’ve never had the guts to tell you because I’m afraid that you’ll reject me and we’ll lose this friendship.”
Castiel's hand is still in his own and Sam's dozed off before him when they finally come to a stop. It's night now, the dark slipping through the gap in the curtains on either side of the carriage. He listens as the sound of the boy in the front of the carriage hops down onto the sidewalk and knocks on a door a little way off. Quiet voices follow and there's a slight rap on the outside of the carriage. William does a quick double check, peering out both windows before he opens the door and leads the way out.
"Yeah, that's right. Why don't you show me the carving you were doing yesterday? Stop worrying about this for a while." Sam nods again and Dean stands, guiding him out of his seat before shooting a reassuring glance at Castiel.
“It looks like it should be all healed in a few days,” he says, meeting Dean’s eyes as he drops his hand away. Dean shakes his hand out as he pulls it to his chest and there’s the slightest sense of relief.
“No,” Dean mutters softly. “But it doesn’t matter anymore. It’s fixed.” The words feel heavy on his tongue though because he knows that’s not true.
But he supposes that’s why they had each other. Because if they couldn’t keep going for themselves, they would keep going for the other.
“If you wanted to kill me, I would already be dead. And this,” Dean holds up his bandaged hand, “you’ve already been punished for. We’ll stop by the armoury later for you to collect anything else you may need.”
"You and Cas... Are you..." Dean's eyes fall to the table, throat tightening, that question finally here. Sam's eyes are wide and confused. Wondering. But there's no spite in them, nothing of disgust. Dean swallows.
A hundred years after they had flocked to the northern continent, the angels stole the south, finally drawing a line in the earth to mark their own country, Karlon. The only benefit the current king received was finally being able to have his country separated from the angels and the immoral lives they continued to lead on earth.
Castiel looks at him, really looks at him and Dean can only hope he can see that it’s true. That he couldn’t give a flying fuck about what anyone else wants to think.
So, he settles for, "I had plans to hopefully get a chance at becoming a guard there. I wasn't intending it to happen right away but it's what we all hoped. And as a normal guard, not assigned to anyone, I would have had more time to search the castle." Dean's eyebrows are pulled together, lips turned down when he finishes.
"Cas," Dean says beside him, voice wobbly. Charlie jumps at the sound. He lets go of Dean's hand - lets go of that feeling inside of him and they appear all at once. William leaps back in fright, Charlie cutting off a small scream with a hand to her mouth.
He nods and Dean swiftly leaves the room. Castiel hears him exit his own chambers and he finally lets out a deep, shuddering breath. He submerges himself under the water, running his hands through his dirty hair to get any muck out. After surfacing, he sits in the tub, quietly waiting for Dean’s return. He eyes are beginning to slip shut as he hears the tell-tale sounds of Dean’s boots on the floor.
Castiel shakes his head, mind elsewhere, eyes panicked. “Yes, it’s Enochian. And it needs two angels. Two!” He turns and slams his open palm against the stone slab. “We’ve come all this way and now I’ll have to go all the way back to the Ellwood--” Castiel’s eyes widen. “What am I thinking? Elaria!”
Apologies for such a long wait for this chapter! I'm currently writing chapter 22 and it looks as though the story will have ~around~ 30 chapters!! XD
Tight, black jeans – as usual – with those trusty grey combat boots. But instead of those bomber jackets he’s always wearing, Castiel’s only in a tight white shirt that’s tucked in, paired with some dark bands around his wrist, similar to Dean’s own actually.
The last entry is short and ends abruptly. It’s not dated but it must be from a week or so before the invasion.
Dean sighs into him, pushing closer until their entire bodies are lined up and pressed tightly together and when his hands curl over his hips, holding him there, Castiel’s whole body lights up, heat flowing through his veins.
“Hey Jude, don’t make it bad,” he sings as he strums his guitar in the parking lot, “Take a sad song and make it better. Remember to let her into your heart, then you can start to make it better.”
As soon as Michael’s back hits the ground, he has the heel of his boot securing his wrist that still grips his sword and has his own at his brother’s throat.
But Castiel is lying, blue eyes unblinking below him with a blank face. Dean’s grin fades. He sits back on his haunches, hands crossed over his chest.
Then Nyree clears her throat and Dean watches her transform before him into the leader she was. The princess she is. Her wings rise behind her as she steels herself. Dean feels the slightest sense of admiration. This is what he was to be to his people. But what they got instead…
"Should we try and sneak out the back door?" Sam's voice is small and timid and he grips his older brother’s hand tightly, his other gripping hard onto the string of his bag.
The air is stilted as they all take their seats once again. Michael and Reyne across from himself and Dean, Nyree at the head.
They drag him to his small room, dark and cramped, and throw him inside. He quickly wipes the small amount of blood from his face, using the small bucket of water in the corner to make sure it’s all gone. He sinks down onto his mattress, pulling his knees to his chest.
Dean breathes out a sigh of relief now that everyone’s distracted. He glances at Castiel who’s drawing something in the margins of his pad.
Dean’s stepping up into the saddle when he cries his name. Dean stops, turning and hopping back down to see him running towards him. And it’s like he can suddenly see now for the first time in weeks, what he’s been trying to ignore, trying to bury beneath his grief.
“Castiel,” Michael says, and suddenly there is a hand at his shoulder, pulling him away but Castiel stays firm, anger rising in his throat.
He starts from the beginning. He tells her he knows everything. She tries to interject, tries to ask, say anything but he won’t allow her. He tells her he will say everything, recite all he knows and then she will give her own answers.
“They sent soldiers to war against the angels. But of course, the angels didn’t know it was coming. It was an invasion instead.” She shakes her head, eyes filling with sorrow.
It’s hard to see a lot of detail through the slits in the crate but he is able to take in most of it. The gate surrounding the castle is made of metal, painted over in black. It’s tall, possibly twelve feet high with pointed tips protruding from the top. They don’t pause at the gates, them already being open wide for the horses to pull them through. Castiel doesn’t get to see much of the front gardens, only a glimpse as they veer to the right, and loop a long way around to the side of the castle, hitting his head on the floor when they abruptly stop. He waits rather impatiently as the two guards who locked him in, unlock the crate and pull him out again by his feet. Castiel’s prepared this time although it still doesn’t do much. He’s pulled up with an ache in his back and in his head even worse than before. More healing to do.
“You slaughtered it. Drenched Castiel in its blood.” Nicolaus shakes beneath him. A small tremor. But Dean notices. “Now, you did a lot of bad things to him, even tried to kill him. But I remember that very clearly. Because there was so much of it. So much blood, it was hard to tell if any of it was coming from him.”
He suddenly is caught by a certain terror. He is not enough. He is not an angel. Just a poor imitation of one. The prophecy was wrong. These powers aren’t real.
"So, I think it's safe for you to tell us about the camp now," Dean says, his eyes prodding gently from where he sits across the fire, leaning back against a log with Sam. Castiel does the same and although it's not the most comfortable, it's nice to rest for a little while.
He pauses, eyeing Dean hesitantly, once more seemingly wondering if he should go on. Dean’s about to open his mouth, ask about whether this has to do with Iowan when Castiel’s eyes cut away and he continues on as though he never paused. Dean doesn’t ask even though he wants to. A time will come for everything.
Castiel stares down at him, not sure what came over him but he doesn’t back down now. Doesn’t show doubt.
And Michael flails, attempting to use the back of his head to hit Castiel and get him to let go but Castiel doesn’t.
Dean nods his understanding, Sam’s feet returning to the floor as he places his brother down. But suddenly a smaller hand slips into his own and Dean clutches it tight not wanting to let go of his brother until they are far, far away from this castle.
Dean can feel Castiel tense in his arms as they pass the two bodies outside. But he doesn't mention it, nor is there time to stop and they continue on up the stairs. Carefully, of course. And slowly because of whatever kind of torture was inflicted upon Castiel’s legs - he can't exactly see in the low light. Castiel tenses for a second time when they round the corner to find Sam still standing guard by the door. Dean glances at Castiel to find his eyes wide and lips parted.
Sam is the first to react, quietly rushing over to envelop Castiel in a very gentle hug. Castiel looks to Dean, a question on his face.
Dean huffs a laugh as Castiel pulls off his silver bands and starts to unbutton his own jerkin. “You talk a big game, Cas. But I’ve been swimming in these waters for years.” Castiel rolls his eyes. He doesn’t know why anyone would ever willingly swim in freezing waters. Although, technically that’s what he’s doing right now.
He doesn’t know where he finds the courage but as everyone is walking off towards the stands after training is finished, Castiel calls Dean’s name. He spins on his heels, and despite being in conversation with his friends, pauses to respond with a, “Yeah?”
And Castiel smiles as much as he can in pain. He lets his eyes slip closed, drained from what he’s done and sends the warmth through him to heal.
Upon returning from their morning training session – which went a little better than he thought – Castiel finds one of the young maids from the baths waiting beside the dining table.
His mother nods, raising her hand to tuck a stray hair behind his ear. He can see it in her eyes. The slight fear. Because no matter how high the praises are sung of this man he is to be wedded to, no one can know what he’s like behind closed doors.
“That’s right. And oh, it was a slow death. But my blood, they never begged!” It shakes its head, striding towards him now, Castiel’s heart in his mouth. “Not like you will.”
His chest squeezes tight with anticipation. He neatly piles his clothes and boots on the ground before wading out into the water. It’s still piercingly cold but already much warmer than last time with the spring equinox closing in and the midday sun beating down on the shimmering water.
Dean sighs, flicking his eyes up to the ceiling to hold back emotion of his own. "I just - I don't know. I guess I just don't know anything anymore." There's a beat of silence before he timidly asks, "It wasn't, right?"
He's just pulled his bag over his head and attempted to flatten his hair down when Missouri walks over. "Going on a date with that young boy, I see," she says, eyebrows raised and arms crossed over her chest.
Sam sits across from Dean beside William, staring out through the little gap in the curtain that has been pulled across their window as he clutches his bag close to him. Castiel notices the way Dean's boots rest against his brothers, a small, comforting gesture that appears to say 'I'm here'.
Usman said the only story he’d ever heard firsthand was by an old man who merely said the cave was filled with traps, impossible to get through. But by the feel of it, there was something holy in there for sure.
“For it was clear now. My god would not let me die. It was me that was to save the world and nobody else. And I’d given in, given up and tried to abandon everyone.”
Castiel blinks suddenly, realising he might not know. “The demon—Dean killed the king but he said--”
They are quiet for a long while, every moment that passes by, a moment closer to dawn. A moment closer to goodbye. A
“Fine, although I missed your cooking tremendously,” he responds politely, thankful for the small talk. Hermana smiles sweetly before mumbling a quick ‘thank you’ and ‘I’m glad to hear it’ before moving back through the tables to the kitchen. Dean still hasn’t looked up from across the table as he piles food onto his plate. Castiel sits uncomfortably in his seat, hands clenching in his lap as he stares at the empty plate in front of him.
“In fact, I’d sent them to an old friend of mine. He was a spy stationed in Iowan. More specifically in the royal castle of Iowan. You see, I’d never been able to get this rusty old thing to work.” Dean’s eyes widen ever so slightly and he swallows around the lump in his throat. So, this is it… The simple, golden ring that the king holds a mere few metres away from him is the halo.
“I don’t regret my decision. He’s just…” he sighs. “It seems that he really isn’t afraid of punishment after all.” Dean slumps down in the spare chair, running a hand through his hair. It’s been a long day. And though he doesn’t regret it, he wishes this was easier. There always seems to be something in the way of him. Always.
He stays. And opens his mouth, putting as much effort as he can into sounding outraged as he says, “What?” It’s his only chance. Pretend Dean is the crazy one. And when they have no proof, they will have to let him go. Because if they find out about his wings – wings that can be hidden away,
Castiel grows distant and Dean feels as though, even when he is curled tightly around him, that he is watching from afar.
He slips around the back a few houses down and watches as Castiel buries Michael in the small yard in the back of their small house.
Castiel squints, head tilting to the side. “Practice.” Dean lets out a frustrated breath but points towards the guard he was facing before. “No, you’ll fight me for now. He’ll never be able to go his all on you. Too afraid of what you might do to him if he hurts you.”
Eve and Castiel share an amused look. “Well,” she starts, a bright smile on her face. “We met at uni. Cas and I were both taking the same class and um…” she huffs a small laugh and Castiel does the same, and something twists deep in Dean’s gut, “I guess it was just love at first sight.”
Their routines are slowly becoming established, everyone being slowly assigned positions whether it’s one usually considered a servant or a guard but here with the angels, it’s merely life as it has always been for them. They volunteer easily and at the end of the day they are all equal.
Castiel’s shoulders slump as Dean steps in front of him, raising his hands to finish doing his laces. He basks in the attention – in the closeness of the two of them.
He rocks once, Castiel’s breath hitching as he does, before Dean suddenly halts. Castiel’s eyebrows pinch together as he searches Dean’s eyes to see if something’s wrong. But they’re only filled with wonder and the slightest glint of fear.
“That’s correct. And since I don’t, you will be needing these.” Dean places his quill back in its ink pot and swings his feet down from his desk. Bending over to grab something he pulls out two swords sheathed in a belt – Castiel’s belt. He walks over to stand in front of Castiel and extends them towards him. “I believe these are yours.”
“I don’t have to,” he says, before he turns and begins walking back towards the field they train in.
Dean waits for him once more after training and they hold hands as they walk to Castiel’s car which has Castiel’s heart fluttering hard in his chest and his lips curved in a permanent smile. The joy inside of him is palpable – even more so when Dean gives him a peck on the lips goodbye. A few of Dean’s friends and some of the girls are still standing around but he doesn’t even notice them.
"I can't risk it if we get caught. Not until we're safe. Out of the city." Charlie nods, dashing towards her cupboards to pull out a basket of cloths, balms and thread.
“For God’s sake, Nicolaus, I don’t want to hear it. How many times do I have to save your ass? Escort yourself out and make sure no one hears of it. You better bloody hope it doesn’t leave a mark,” the guard – Salicar – shouts. Nicolaus’s jaw twitches and he glares once in Castiel’s direction before exiting out the door and closing it behind him.
Dean’s eyes flick away for a moment as though pondering something before he says, “Is this about what she said? That we’re not in a proper married relationship. Because you know you shouldn’t believe it for a second.”
“Yes?” The young man nods his head slightly, a wary look thrown towards Castiel before he speaks again.
“I know,” he responds and Dean huffs, wiping half heartedly at his eyes. He stares at Castiel for a moment, joy in his eyes – something he hasn’t seen in a long while – before he lets out a shuddering breath and rests his forehead on Castiel’s shoulder.
He clears his throat, dragging himself away from those thoughts. “How did you become…” Dean waves his hand towards them, not knowing if spy is the right word here.
Dread curls in his stomach the whole way back to the castle. That moment won’t stop replaying in his head. Dean’s fingers caressing his face in the dark of his room, breath warm on his lips. He could barely stand it. The urges to lean forward or pull away waged war inside him. Only one got the better of him in the end. He supposes it’s for the best.
“I want you to listen to me, Cas. Can you do that?” he whispers, softly and Castiel nods his head slightly against Dean’s chest. “Good, because what you just said to me - all of that was complete and utter bullshit. You are not nothing. You are - fuck - you are everything. You’re my everything and yeah, you might be socially inept and awkward and look like a friggin dork but that’s why I love you,
He lets his gaze fall on Dean. His eyes are closed although Castiel can tell he does not sleep. He does not think many of them will sleep in these coming hours – these hours that appear to be going by far too quickly and yet at the same time, far too slowly.
Dean shakes his head, wiping at his eyes. And now he’s done it. Ruined a serious chance of getting it back. Of taking an important step towards defeating the demon.
“No but seriously, what was your first impression?” They bump shoulders, hands clasped tight in between them as they make their way out into the parking lot.
They speak for a while – well, the king speaks and the guard nods, only occasionally speaking himself – before they both make their way out of the room and close the doors behind them. Castiel observes for a torturously long minute, surveying for any shadows underneath the doors before sliding off the railing and onto the stone floor of the balcony. He tests the doors and like expected they’re locked.
For the third time, Castiel frets over what to wear for far longer than he should especially since he’s going to a cinema not a date – something he has been telling himself over and over since Wednesday. He ends up going with just a plain shirt and throwing a jacket over with his same old black skinny jeans because that’s cinema wear? Right?
“That I do,” he says, and she winks one last time before walking back over to her friends just as Castiel appears in front of him, taking his seat back in the booth.
"I'm sure you haven't," he responds, and the hint of a smile turns into an amused one. Dean huffs, smiling back before focusing on the movie.
Angels part behind him and Castiel takes a shaky step forward, heart beating so fast he worries it will beat out of his chest entirely.
He closes his eyes, focusing on his breath coming in and out, slower and slower. His face crumples and he chokes out a cry before the tears flood down his face again, his body trembling.
“Dean,” he says quietly, almost a whisper, “I promise, it’s true. I’m okay.” And he supposes it’s not entirely true. He’s not okay. He’s still in shock and feels like perhaps he could cry in Dean’s arms at any moment but at the end of the day, after all is said and done, he
And now Castiel definitely feels bad. “No.” But then Dean smiles, eyes crinkling at the sides and he huffs a breathy laugh.
Castiel swallows down some more saliva but it only seems to make it worse. He finds a bruise forming on the side of his stomach and presses down hard, the pain taking his mind away from his thirst. He wonders how long he can keep it up. Keep his mind distracted. He supposes it depends on the amount of pain he can source and considering the number of bruises and cuts that litter his body that he’s unable to heal as of now, it’ll probably be a little while.
It’s been three days since Castiel was whipped and as his lash wounds have slowly started to heal, so has Dean’s wrist. Once a day at their morning training, Castiel will find some excuse to touch his wrist – whether it’s correcting technique or in a fight – healing only enough that it’s barely noticeable.
And there it is. Castiel feels his eyes tearing up before he can even stop it and he blinks back the sudden wave of emotion that threatens to drown him. Despite it, his voice cracks when he says, "How could you think that?"
Well, not everyone. Dean’s missing. And it shouldn’t be as obvious as it is. Dean shouldn’t be as noticeable considering he’s a new guy.
It only takes a glance to know that this is Dean’s room. It’s a large space, decorated with the same simple coloured wallpaper and polished floors as the hall. In the middle, pushed against the farthest wall is an enormous, lush bed with dark mahogany wood as the frame. And sitting at the end of it, pushed up against the footboard, a carved wooden chest.
He tugs his boots from his feet, almost tripping over in the process, before he crawls onto the bed after Castiel, a little hurried and impatient and he doesn’t waste a second before he’s lowering himself down against him, pressing their bodies flush together and Castiel’s lips are captured with his own.
Dimarus shoots him a sympathetic look. “Are you? Because when the guards had Castiel dragged by me, he had a bit of a bruise on his face. And I couldn’t help but notice the bruises on your knuckles just as you walked in.” Dean looks down at his knuckles, curling his other hand over it, suddenly self-conscious. “Those two things happen when you were kidnapped?” he asks, but Dean can hear it in his voice that he knows different.
“We have to go check out the crime scene. We’re on a job here, ya know.” Dean grumbles but continues to follow Cas and that’s when he sees what the angel was talking about.
Castiel stops, turning to find Michael standing now and he swears he sees something like sorrow flashing through his eyes.
“Dean, I’m sor--” Dean’s hands are on either side of Castiel’s face before he can think about it and he’s crushing his lips into his with desperation, eyes closed and throat tight. Castiel gasps and Dean swallows it down but a moment later, he’s being pushed away.
It's still mostly dark when he wakes, some light filtering through the trees, the fire a pit of ash and dirt now. He rubs his eyes, pushing himself up from his mat. Glancing to his side, he finds Sam still fast asleep. Good. He'd slept only a few hours throughout the night, his thoughts waking him and a few times he'd noticed Sam restless. Hopefully, when they finally get to camp and all of this anxious waiting is over, they can both get some proper sleep.
“Every time you tell me everything’s going to be okay or brush the hair from my face when you think I’m still sleeping.” Castiel flushes to which Dean laughs, warm and low and beautiful. “Every time…” Dean trails off, almost as if he’s lost for words, “Every
Then there's Michael. He's not sure how to feel about that. Not after all he knows Castiel's been through. But he made a promise to Castiel. He'll do his best to keep it – to not interfere.
Emery stands frozen, not sure exactly what he’s supposed to do when the prince walks directly towards him.
Castiel frowns, something sinking in his chest. "Yeah, sure." He locks his phone and shoves it in his pocket just as the closet door opens. "Whatever, Dean." He walks out before Dean can respond.
Castiel nods. He looks around him for a moment and Emery guides the torch so he can see. He scrabbles for something. A rock.
The very day after they first spend the night together, security is heightened throughout the entire castle. It’s Sam’s thirteenth birthday on the second and for a whole week before, two additional guards are ordered to follow Dean around along with himself. Dean says that usual protocol is a few days before but since the break in in the king’s chambers, everyone’s being a little more cautious.
“Right.” It’s only then that he sees the look on Dean’s face. It’s not one of pride or excitement. He looks sad. “Do you not enjoy the festival?” he prods gently.
“That when I finally got another boyfriend two years later, all I did was suck his dick so he wouldn’t cheat on me. And then the one night I wasn’t in the fucking mood he tried to come onto me anyway and when I resisted he told me how fucking difficult and worthless I was before he left to fuck someone else.” Castiel pauses for breath and Dean’s chest feels like it’s caving in, like it’s crushing him.
I hope to have the next chapter up in around six weeks or so but I've also decided to use my AO3 profile page as a place to update on how the story is coming along. I'll try to update it every two weeks even if I haven't made any progress just so everyone knows I am still here!
But then, the most impossible thing happens. It simply, moves through him, landing behind him on the floor, snarling ever louder now at its failure.
, he thinks. What would Michael say? Upon hearing his thoughts now? He would tell Castiel how weak he is. How vulnerable he will become if he continues to think this way.
He slides under the bed, feeling for anything and almost comes up short when his hands knock a plank closest to the far wall.
The guard standing in front of him sheathes his sword. “Your punishment will be delivered tomorrow,” he says with a cruel smile before kicking Castiel in the stomach. A rush of air punches out of him and he hunches forward. “I can assure you now that you’ll have quite a crowd.” So, it seems his punishment has already been decided. He will be whipped. In front of everyone. But out of all of that, he only wonders if Dean will be the one to do it. “There’s a lot of men who would like to see you bleed.”
Sam shrugs. “He was there for me when you were gone.” Dean’s eyes fall, a sadness washing over him. He hates the thought of that time. “But lately he’s been spending a lot of time with Castiel’s friend,” Sam says, pouting.
“Yeah, that’s getting me real fucking hard for you, Cas,” Dean says, cutting him off as his cheeks heat up.
She can’t be here, she can’t be real. And he’s wrong, he’s a fool and tears well up behind his eyes, chest aching because he’s already been through this once before and it crushed him. But his heart still rises in his throat and he’s terrified all over again as he takes a step forward because the hope is too much, too--
“What are you doing?” Sebastian asks, arms crossed over his chest where he watches Dean from the other side of the room.
Castiel’s eyes darken, shoulders stiffening and his gaze flicks to Seb and Brady before it settles back on Dean.
They shove him to his knees, chaining his wrists to each individual post so he’s strung apart before the guards undo his belt – and it’s hard not to flinch as unwanted hands touch him there but he restrains himself – taking his swords and searching for the daggers hidden in the sheaths in his thighs. Taking them before one of the guards rounds behind him and pulls off his boots, revealing the dagger hidden inside there. The place a pair of cuffs around his bare ankles before the silver bands signifying his position in the castle are yanked from his arm.
From Dean discussing with the doctor and maids what happened to him, Castiel understands that it was Nicolaus who had attempted to follow him into the woods under the pretence of being concerned for the prince’s safety. And took the shot as it appeared Castiel was being ‘aggressive towards the prince’ which Dean denied, claiming they were having a small argument about training. He might have been enraged at Nicolaus’ petty attempt to murder him so that he could take his rightful place beside Dean if he wasn’t so tired of everything.
He swallows tightly as he realises it is the young prince. Curled around his own brother. He barely moves but for the rise and fall of his chest. Otherwise he would have assumed he was one of the dead himself. He’s not sure how he can bare the smell, lying so close.
“Now I realise I prefer it better this way,” Castiel says, looking up to meet Dean’s soft eyes in the dark. “To know that in all of this world, it was you I stumbled into that day.”
Like now. It’s early in the morning and they’re walking back to the castle from their training spot, Castiel opting to start walking instead of riding to keep the stiffness away. It’s more comfortable between them now. Dean having even taken it upon himself to start calling him ‘Cas’. He likes it. Michael stopped calling him that after the invasion.
They stop by Castiel’s car first and he immediately becomes flustered at the memory of Saturday and from the bashful look on Dean’s face, he’s thinking about it too.
Dean sighs in relief, a smile lighting up his face once more as he shakes his head and lifts his hand to cradle Castiel’s cheek.
“Goodnight, Dean.” Dean steps inside his cabin, closing the door softly behind him. He leans against it, releasing a deep breath. Yeah. He is so screwed.
Last night was…wonderful. And at the same time, terrifying. Because there’s no going back from this. But despite the unwavering fear that is always there, teetering on the surface and lessened only ever by Castiel and Charlie, buried deep in his gut Dean knows that he doesn’t want to. And he doesn’t think he could come back even if he tried. This is what he wants. Even if it’s not how things should be – even if it scares him – even if it’s wrong. Curled around Castiel, holding him close – this is all he wants. How can this be wrong?
The guards both look at each other and as he comes to stand in front of them, it's with a sort of harsh relief that he recognises the two guards as the main guards that have been torturing Castiel the past few days. The guilt that he may take the lives of two innocent men dissipates.
Something’s wrong. Panic rises in his throat. Something’s wrong. What did he do wrong? Once the final guards have left the room, his father storms over, right up into his personal space. Dean grits his teeth, waiting for the blow.
Drunken shouting is what draws Castiel’s eyes over to a stall about thirty yards away from them. It must be a game involving throwing daggers because the drunken man in question is spinning one in his hand.
“I’ve got you, Cas,” Dean says, surprisingly soft as their noses brush. “I’ve got you.” It hits him forcefully, his body tensing and with a strangled breath punching out of him, he comes all over Dean’s hand.
“And he…” Her eyes are wary but hopeful. Dean thinks it’s safe to say that even through all that’s happened, Castiel likes him back.
How could he have thought anyone could love him the way he wants them to when he is like this? To want to kiss him and hold him close, whisper prayers into his skin and wake to him curled against them every morning without ever asking for more?
Most angels are already up as usual as he crosses the short distance to the cabin Sam and Dean are housed in. Which means Mary will likely already be in the gardens where Sam can join her. The younger prince won’t have any new information to add and he’d rather not put anymore stress on the boy by letting him sit on in the meeting. He wishes he could do the same for Dean but he’s already proven to have found and heard things that could be of great use.
Because they all knew. They all knew what happened at the cabin down at the end of the clearing. And none of them tried to stop it.
If he wasn't so entirely drained of energy he would wonder how he could possibly fall asleep. He doesn't even know where to begin. He supposes at what started it all. The God of Light and the God of Darkness. He knows the truth of it now and yet it still feels as though it’s only a story. It's hard to fathom otherwise. Angels and demons. Souls in waiting. One angel to stop a god by tearing the structure apart at the seams. And a prophecy. A prophecy delivered from the God of Light, centuries ago. To even be living in the time of a prophesied would be hard luck but to know them - to have met them. To have fallen for them.
The usual conversation flows as everyone serves up their own plates, ‘how are you’s and ‘this all looks wonderful’ and there’s some slight stress relief until everyone is served, no more dishes being passed around and it begins all over again.
“Uh, should we pick up the swords again?” Dean says, clearing his throat and Castiel nods awkwardly.
“I can’t hold him. He’s too fucking strong,” the prisoner restraining his hands yells back above the noise.
Castiel focuses on his technique and building up strength in his left hand and wrist. There’s no physicality or fighting with Castiel’s limited movement but he has Dean running through the motions of a few different moves. It’s awkward at first but Dean finds himself getting used to it.
The two guards carry the chest between them out into the square, steps slow but assured. They are merely ten paces away when Castiel speaks again. "Stop there. That’s far enough."
Eve clears her throat beside them. “Okay,” she says awkwardly, eyeing Dean carefully. “Well, we’re just gonna scoot past so I can introduce Cas to everyone else. See you inside?” But it’s not much of a question as she grabs Castiel by the arm and drags him past and down the hall, Dean saying nothing as he watches them go.
But he doesn’t know the demon is Mary. What if he is tricked? What if he fails? What if he collects the Three and then walks right back into her – it’s – arms?
It’s only now that Dean sees the tears that have streamed down Castiel’s cheeks. Dean throws the dagger into the corner of the room before he reaches a hand up to brush his fingers against Castiel’s tears.
“No,” Dean says, firm, the thought of Castiel dead all those years ago pulling an unpleasant feeling in his chest. “Castiel told me about that night. He was about to die. To perish, suffocated under a pile of dead angels. If he died, the spell could not be done for the underworld, yes, but everyone would end up here and who knows what hell the demon could unleash.”
Others took the angels falling from the sky and made up their own truths rational to their own religions.
Dean trails off as he gazes at the side of Castiel’s face, shadows dancing on his skin in the light of the fire.
“Dean!” He turns at the sound of his brother’s voice and smiles at the sight of Sam dressed in his fresh clothes. It’s not that he hasn’t seen his brother in formal attire before but he’s constantly growing now and every day he becomes more and more of a man – and he knows his mother would be proud, as is he.
Castiel tilts his head ever so slightly, his eyebrows furrowed and Dean never thought he’d think of this hunk of a man as adorable but… “Bad ones?”
He strides passed his brother, heading directly towards the forest. He can feel sets of eyes all around, turning one by one towards him.
“So, you and Castiel are still avoiding each other,” Sam states abruptly as they wander through the garden.
Dean’s wondering if Castiel is up yet when he spies the man in question sitting down by the dock. Dean has another quick glance around to make sure he’s not needed before slipping away towards him.
He rounds the corner to the carpark behind the pub only to find two guys, standing a mere metre apart, and--
“Oh, yeah. I mean, not bad. But, you know, there’s always someone who’s real uptight about everything.” He could name more than a few actually.
Dean huffs a laugh, running a hand through his hair. “Yeah, fine. I actually just wanted to say sorry I didn’t let you know I wasn’t gonna be here on Wednesday. Family emergency.”
Eve steps in as always, a hand on Castiel’s bicep. “Cas is my boyfriend! Didn’t you get the text that I was bringing my boyfriend to Christmas lunch?”
Castiel is the first to turn, leading their small group towards the trees. Dean glances back, takes one last look at his mother, smiling encouragingly, and one last look at the sprawling camp around them and then he’s forcing his eyes ahead of him, taking his first steps into the trees.
His fingers won’t stop trembling, no matter how many times he clenches his fists and forces them to stop. There are more people in the great hall than he imagined. Although he tries to focus on not tripping over his own feet on his way to his soon to be husband rather than the faces scrutinising every inch of him.
He’s back safe now that the ransom was paid in exchange for him but it’s not over. It’s a blow to the kingdom. A humiliating one. Simple bandits shouldn’t be able to just whisk the husband of the second born prince away whilst he’s in the midst of stroll through the streets with one of the lords of a sizeable city within their borders.
This won’t last forever. He’s going to leave. Dean isn’t more important than his people. Than the fate of everything. And it tears him apart to admit it. But it’s true. No one is more important than this.
Dean only just remembers to smile in time for the first shot. The next shot snaps just as Dean feels Cas rest his head in his shoulder. Dean smiles even more at that but then just in time for the third shot, Dean feels lips pressed to his cheek.
They all nod, mumbling thank you's as they sit, Orella sitting beside Castiel as Dean and Sam find seats beside each other on the other side of the table.
“Why do you need Castiel to get it for you? Just go up and ask for the prize and they’ll give it to you.”
Castiel’s chest heaves now as he takes in Dean’s bare chest and stomach, arms tense and layered with muscle. It’s not like he hasn’t seen him before but to have it all laid out in front of him… His palms start to sweat.
“It’s quite poetic, don’t you think? Holding the very thing he had been searching for in his very hands right from the beginning. If he’d only escaped with it, I assume he never would have entered this castle.” The king takes a step forward and Dean’s body tenses. “Never would have met you. And you never would have…disappointed me like you so very much have.”
And maybe it wasn’t a perfect fucking day but Castiel’s not mad at him anymore, back to being a little shit and he
Blood splatters across his face, thick and red as Castiel’s heart spikes and he pushes himself to his feet.
Castiel voices his thoughts for him, anxiety growing. “What happens now?” He tries not to think too hard about what Dean’s answer might be. Because he knows deep down that one answer will hurt him more than he’d like to admit. Even though it shouldn’t.
“And I trusted his word. But throughout the years, we tried everything to access its power.” The king curls his fist around it until it is out of sight, all of his attention back on Dean now. The hairs raise on the back of his neck. “We came up with nothing. It was only a few moons ago that I decided I’d send it over to him, where he had retired in a modest jeweller’s shop, to have a look at it himself and see if he had any ideas on how it worked. As a sort of last hope.”
But Castiel tries anyway. He kneels, pressing his hand to the pile and allows the warmth to flow through him.
And here Dean is, the first person to truly look at him and see him for what he is. Broken. And despite it, care for him anyway. Unconditionally.
His fingers quiver where they are clenched into fists on his knees. The boots in front of him do not shift from their position. Dean swallows, snatching up any courage he has and looks up to meet his father’s eyes.
And it’s all he’s ever wanted to hear. So, he clings tighter, holding onto this moment, as precious as a star that has fallen from the sky and landed in the palm of his hand.
Dean wakes that morning to a soft smile and a kiss to the lips. Usually he would get up to train with Castiel but today he promised Sam he would help with some more of the boring duties.
His sword is taken from his hands and he’s being pushed once again out of the ring and towards the carriage that waits exactly where they left it. Castiel pauses when they push him towards the open door of the crate. Do they really expect him to crawl on in there again?
“I know, Cas,” he says. “I never stopped loving you. And I would wait an eternity if it meant I could have you once more.”
Castiel nods, understanding now. His latest addition. The wings heal the physical, healing the sick now… “It’s the halo,” he says, “Which means…” The grace will yield something more.
And one demon remained on earth. Searching for the fallen angel’s hidden powers that had been scattered all over the world to open the doors to the underworld.
“Mary. My mother,” he says frantically, guiding Castiel over to where little of her remains. He looks to Castiel, eyes already hopeless.
The door to Dean’s chambers opening is what wakes him – making him jerk up to his feet, a hand on the table for balance as Dean stands there in front of him. It’s just past dawn. Castiel barely slept, crying until he had no tears left to shed and healing all of his wounds before he subsequently passed out in the floor.
“Well, better get a good sleep, Castiel,” Dean says, stopping outside his door. “Big few days ahead of us.”
“Hope I didn’t wake you,” Dean says quietly, lifting his shirt to start unwinding the bandage from around his stomach.
Castiel cries out in pain, clutching at his side as he lands on the hilt of his sword but before he can even say something more, Dean is slamming the door closed.
In this time I have written Chapter 23, 24, 25 and I'm 75% of the way through Chapter 26 (the story will have most likely 30 chapters)! I am hoping now to continue prioritising my writing so that I am able to finish the story in the next few months and then I can focus on editing the chapters quicker so I can get them out for you all!
“He seems to be alright, however, he has been shackled to the wall by his neck and his wrists too. He’s in a cell with five other prisoners – three of which are also shackled to the wall by their necks and seemed to be unconscious, although the other guards just assumed they were asleep. There… It looked as though a fight had broken out. One of the prisoner’s faces was covered in blood and the other had a terrible bruise on his neck – although it was hard to see with such limited light. Castiel, himself had a gash on his forehead but was definitely conscious and looked to be okay.”
Dean coughs up his drink. Castiel raises an eyebrow before, with a face completely blank takes a sip of his own. Dean smiles despite himself, wiping his mouth with his sleeve.
Perhaps he’s just caught something. Perhaps it was the festival food he ate yesterday. He hopes so. He runs faster, not wanting to leave Dean for long but at least finally he’s doing something, finally he’s beginning to repay Dean for all those times he cared for him.
“Do you think we’ll be a story one day? Do you think we’ll have our own stars?” he asks and his voice is reverent.
This would officially be the last time that he’s the new kid. So now he actually has to try and make friends. Sure, he’s always been popular and had a group to sit with at other schools but he’s never had a real friend. And that makes him nervous.
Nyree’s eyes widen and her mouth opens to speak but none of them can grab him as he dashes down, not caring if it’s a trap, if there are men waiting to ambush him, only knowing that sound, only hearing it over and over and needing to make sure he is okay.
Despite the number before them, the night is quiet. Beside him Dean is too, thoughts elsewhere, eyes dancing with flames as he stares at the fire.
He sits for a long time, staring at the stars, dimmer now that the sun is close. It’s quiet now. Things have been calmer lately as the angels alongside Sam work hard to get things back in order. There are still riots and uprisings throughout the continent. But less and less every day as they realise things aren’t changing as they thought they would. They’ve already changed certain laws, of course, but nothing that directly harms the citizens. It doesn’t mean some still don’t like it.
He wonders if Dean feels the same. Because of the lack of sexual intimacy between them. Another thing that keeps him up at night, riddled with guilt.
Dean rubs a tired hand down his face. “No, you…you tried and that counts for everything.” He gives him a small smile – a tired smile. “I’ll be down soon. Just give me a moment.”
“You took fucking everything!” Castiel can’t even will himself to move as Dean tackles him hard to the ground, knocking the wind from him.
But the kingdom isn’t as it once was. King John Winchester passed away peacefully in his sleep not long ago. While they mourned deeply, the family was grateful that he didn’t go in pain. But even though Adam was only crowned a moon cycle ago, he’s struggling to fill his role and take on the stresses of their people and their lands.
It’s the sight through a doorway of an unruly, brown mop in the inner courtyard that snaps him out of his thoughts. He sighs as he steps through the doorway into the fresh, cool air. Snow litters the ground but it’s not too deep – not yet. Winter has come late this year.
It’s just past seven when Dean rises, dressed and ready to eventually wrangle a bunch of exhausted school girls into waking and getting ready for the day. Jody and Donna are already moving around camp, both giving him a smile when they see him although keeping quiet so to give the girls a few more minutes.
And he hates himself for it. Because he can’t even warn him. Castiel would only try to escape and that would only end badly – with either his brother dead or both of them dead.
“What was that?” Dean says, and Castiel’s delighted to hear that he’s not so out of breath. “Aren’t you going to go after him?”
It’s when he’s finally laid his head down on the pillow that his thoughts turn to plans. Because Castiel shouldn’t have to do more, to make up for mistakes that weren’t entirely his fault, mistakes they shared between them. There are still things out there for him. Eventually facing the demon being one.
Castiel riffles through the next few pages and still no mention of Mary and for another matter, of Dean. Sam is mentioned here and there but it is mostly talking about the aftermath of the war and how their trade will be different. The writing is mostly the same but his words sound colder now, more--
His father stands, rounding the chair and standing in front of him. “You probably thought he felt the same, didn’t you? How does it feel to be betrayed? Go on, tell me.”
His stomach sinks. Any well-trained guard would never have let Castiel out of their sight. Unless they’re not well-trained guards. Meeting Castiel’s eyes, he knows he’s having the same thoughts.
But none of this comes falling out of his mouth – his mouth that’s still hanging partly open in shock as he stares and stares and stares at Castiel, wondering if in the next few seconds he’ll disappear before his very eyes because this can’t be real.
As the night comes to an end, Castiel finds his eyes stinging. He never really celebrated this day in the past. When he was younger he was too sick. When he was healed and finally happy… Well, he didn’t make it to the next birthday. And after, this day would pass over unmentioned. He always knew of course. It’s why he knew that exact day as to take his dagger to his arm and slice it open.
The lake is the same as always. Blissful. He used to worry that someone else would stumble across it and destroy its natural beauty. But no one ever seems to come this way and even if they did, it’s incredibly hard to find.
The quiet surrounds them as Nyree stands to attention, her eyes first landing on Dean. “Remember, if you feel as though the demon is there and it is onto you, tell Emery immediately and he will get you out of there. Do not take any chances. For Castiel will be training in the meantime. If you cannot find anything, he will be there hopefully soon after you. Understood?”
But Dean doesn’t go far. One hand rests on his shoulder for support, holding him so he doesn’t fall, the other rising to his face, brushing the tips of his fingers against his skin. Castiel’s own lie uselessly between them, unable to lift themselves.
“Even after all we’d been through, even after giving up in our own Elo, she never gave up on you. And I didn’t believe her,” Elaria says, shaking her head, smiling now. “But now I do.”
There is something below – something scribbled out that Castiel can’t quite make out but it looks as though it talks of a poem.
“And so I thought I’d ask in hope of spending at least prom night with you...you know...in my arms and all that chick flick crap. But if you don’t fell the same that’s fine but I just - I just don’t want to lose you.” The last sentence is nearly a whisper and Castiel’s insides melt.
"The place has been wiped clean of any evidence that you've been here," William says as if reading his mind and Dean itches to go check for himself but nods instead, forcing himself to sit beside Castiel on the bed. Sam sits beside him, close enough for their shoulders to brush and Dean spares him a concerned look but only receives a brave nod in return.
After they’re done, he watches carefully as all three guards slowly approach him. “The Crown Prince has ordered you be sent to his chambers,” one of them says, and Castiel’s eyes narrow. But it hasn’t even reached midnight yet. What did he do to get his punishment cut short?
Lighter. He supposes he is. Now that they’ve worked through their mess – and even though there will always be more to work through – for the time being things are okay.
He screeches to a halt when he gets there and quickly runs down it – night is drawing over now but he can still easily make out the six figures lying in different places down the alley.
There were no further questions. Castiel jumped the three of them back to camp – this time making sure to jump before the barrier so as to not hit it again – and without any words between them, the went to work on doing just that.
Around him, everything goes quiet. Because he couldn’t be… Couldn’t be saying what Castiel thinks he’s saying?
“I’ll call for the guards outside and then I will show you the chambers,” he says, beginning to walk towards the double doors at the end of the room.
He remembers the chill air of the night when Castiel landed him. He remembers the days after when he taught him how to do it.
“You should wash yourself. I want to have trained before we have breakfast with Sam,” Dean says, voice only slightly shaky and Castiel’s heart sinks ever so slightly but he soliders on.
Castiel purses his lips, glancing down with a smile before saying, “I’m really glad you kept flirting with me. Even after I turned you down.” Which in hindsight, was actually not a bad decision since it still led to this anyway. But if Dean had lost interest then perhaps he would have missed out on something special.
"Dean. You're alright?" Dimarus asks, but there's already astounding relief in his voice and Dean knows his friend thought he would be long dead by now.
And with every step they take, Dean’s heart beats louder in his chest. He wonders if Castiel can feel it from where his hand, gripped tight around the dagger, rests just below his collarbone. They walk on, pace steady, until finally they step out of the darkened alley and into the large, spacious square.
He decides not to ask, allowing him the time to deal with it on his own and if he wants to, speak of it later.
He doesn’t know how long he was out in the back of the wooden crate – the average time travelling by carriage from Kalapell to Anathee is roughly one day, but he already knows they stopped once outside of Kalapell for the pigs and the crate. There is no telling how many other times they may have stopped, although he couldn’t have been knocked out for too long. And of course, he doesn’t know how much time has passed since he was thrown down here.
Castiel’s chest caves like the waves breaking against the cliff and his shoulders shake as he begins to cry – loud sobs that wrack his body.
He gazes around his room to find it bare as always. He sighs, shifting around on the mattress, pulling the sheets tighter around him, and closes his eyes.
Dean meets his eyes then, glimmering with tears. “You brought me back,” he says, and it’s not a question. But there’s something else in his eyes. Awe. Love.
And he wants to scream at him. For why should he? For how can he? After everything he’s done. The Michael he knew before feels almost like a dream.
Castiel’s eyes are challenging as he cuts him off. “Yes, Dean. I’m sure.” Dean glances to the empty plate in front of him.
Orderic rambles on beside him as the shame and guilt creeps into his heart. Castiel told him. Castiel trusted him. And what had he done? Beat him bloody. Try to close his hands over his throat.
Despite the fact that Castiel quite clearly turned Dean down on Monday, it doesn’t stop him from trying to impress him. By running
“No.” Dimarus shakes his head but the smile lingers. “Look, I’ll keep an eye out for anyone giving him trouble.”
“Cas--” Dean starts, soft but challenging. Castiel doesn’t let him go on, voice rising and rising as he does.
“Huh?” Dean says, spinning his head to see Leda still with her eyes fixed on Castiel, a fond smile on her face. Dean clenches his jaw.
“Yes. In Narla. Where you went to the trouble of sending four additional guards so I would be protected from Castiel. Four guards who in turn turned out to be some of the worst guards I’ve ever encountered, letting both Castiel out of their sight and me get captured without even a fight in a few small seconds.” Dean’s chest is heaving after he’s done, biting his lip to hold back more.
He feels Dean’s eyes finally lift to his face but he can’t meet them, only staring at his own hand on the wound on Dean’s stomach.
Nicolaus. And the guard he knows as Salicar beside him, both glaring back at Castiel. He feels the rage simmer underneath his skin. If only he was king, he’d have them whipped and dragged to the dungeons for what they’ve done to Castiel. Gutting a pig, and covering Castiel in its blood. And for Nicolaus, trying to kill him on the edge of that cliff. He breathes heavily. No, if he was king, they’d both be hanged.
He slumps down on the bed with a sigh, before slowly divesting himself of his boots and upper layers. He's about to start on his breeches when there's a knock at the door. He freezes for an instant, uncomfortabley aware of his naked torso before Dean's voice filters through.
Broken out of his trance, Dean grunts before pushing out of the booth, past the red, velvet curtain to see that their are two separate strips of the four pictures that we’re taken.
And Dean bites his lip, glad of the dark for the blush that rises up his neck. And when ten minutes later he finally risks a glance to the side, there’s the smallest of smiles at the edge of Castiel’s lips.
"So…" he says, so quiet Dean can barely hear him above the noise of the film. "We should start over?"
Castiel smiles. “Yes. Really.” The smile that follows isn’t one of Dean’s usual grins but a sincerely happy smile that has something stuttering inside of Castiel.
Catharlo stares at him for a moment before he takes a step closer and suddenly, his lips are on Emery’s, softer than he remembered, brighter in his chest than he remembered.
“It’s only a few miles away,” Sam says, grabbing the reigns of his horse and pulling it over to Castiel. “And Mervyn doesn’t mind, right Mervyn?”
Dean smiles. “Yes. For standing by my side through all these years, in times of good and bad and helping me find my way.”
“If you don’t mind,” she starts, looking to Dean now, “I thought I’d introduce Sam to some of the younger ones. If you’re going to be staying here for a while, it might be good for him to get to know some others his age.”
Nyree clasps her hands in front of her. “So, we should begin with you both,” she says, looking to Dean and Castiel. “What you found first and then what exactly happened for you to end up here so we can see what we have to work with. Then we’ll think on how to move forward. Understood?” They all nod but Castiel can still feel Michael’s gaze on him. “Good. So, if you may.”
And to know now that it was all a lie… He banishes his thoughts. He doesn’t need to linger on those right now. Not with her alive and well in front of him. Not when he knows she had no choice but to leave and that none of this was his fault. The demon would have confronted her eventually anyway. It didn’t matter that Dean sent her away to fetch that book of poems, all those years ago.
Time seems to go quickly when Castiel doesn't want it to. Not that he doesn't want to see Dean but he's afraid he'll make a fool of himself. He seems to be prone to doing that, especially in front of people he likes.
Dean holds his gaze for a second before nodding. Castiel’s eyes widen and his lips part slightly when Dean steps forward, close enough that they’re almost touching. He didn’t expect this. Not now. Right after that.
Castiel shakes his head, a small, sad smile pulling at his lips. “Isn’t it obvious?” Dean doesn’t miss the bitterness in his tone, only stares at him, waiting until Castiel meets his eyes, a soft ache inside of them. “I’m here for you.”
The eldest whom sold his soul in return for his brother’s place in paradise after he’d been touched by a demon. Dean doesn’t hesitate in thinking he would do the same for Sam.
And it had all come crashing down when his father had not celebreated the news. He had only become angrier. Because they had taken all angels except those who took his wife.
For the first time in a very long time, he doesn’t dream of bloody feathers and chaos. He doesn’t dream of bruises and broken bones.
Dean breathes heavily. “Yeah, I saw. I saw that you almost put a fucking dagger through Castiel’s heart!”
to think about it, the more he ends up reliving the moment. The thrashing of his body and the clawing at his trousers, at his thighs. The thought of what would have happened if he had waited a second longer to move, if he had been knocked out cold. The severe ache of his stiff body after those kicks from the guard were actually the best thing that happened to him down here for the pain took his mind away – the pain was a distraction.
Suddenly there’s a knock at the door, which only reminds him that he has to fix the doorbell. Great. He sighs before pulling himself up and walking over to the door. He brushes a hair through his hair as he opens the door to greet whoever thought it was a good idea to show up on such an awful day.
His shoulders deflate. Finally. He’s already memorised every speck of the room. There wasn’t much more he could do. Castiel stands to attention as Dean exits followed by the bright, red hair of Charlie.
Castiel holds his gaze for only a moment before he looks away, the moment too much. But Dean doesn’t want the night to end like this. He doesn’t want Castiel to lay awake in bed all night.
Castiel’s stomach flutters, never objecting to be reminded of Dean’s concern over him. Across from them, Reyne grins and Nyree’s eyes twinkle with mischief.
“Now,” Dean starts, holding out his arm. “I hear there’s an unfortunate ball we must attend.” Castiel smiles, slipping his arm into Dean’s.
Castiel makes a strangled sound at the back of his throat as Dean gapes at him. “Dad!” And he’s never been so satisfied than he is now as he watches Castiel’s face burn bright red in embarrassment, a laugh finally spilling from his lips, Castiel’s father joining in. “Fuck you both,” Castiel grumbles, arms crossed petulantly over his chest.
“Yes. We hope that your father took it or someone amongst the king’s men. The only other option is that it burned with the rest of Iowan. And if that is the case… It is now a race against time. Against the demon who is no doubt looking for it with every passing moment. As it is no doubt looking for the wings. As for the halo…”
He slumps in his chains, head down to try and breathe normally again. Dean sits back down on his chair, waiting until Castiel looks back up before speaking as though there was no pause in conversation. “And what of your brother?”
“Quickly. We are wasting time. We will head back and get Elaria to come and open it!” Castiel turns to go back but Emery steps in his path.
And it appears it’s the same for his mother for she doesn’t waste a second before wrapping her arms around him.
A moment later, they are sitting, still gripping each other, entwined together on wild plains that run on for an age, forests all around them.
He responds with a ‘yes, I’m feeling much better, thank you’ and as Dean recedes into the stands Castiel knows that the next time he sees him, he’s going to ask him out on a date.
The guards shove him forward, Dean’s eyes forced to tear away. His grits his teeth in pain, head pulsing and bicep stinging as blood drips down his sleeve.
And in the morning, when Castiel greets Dean, the prince looks surprised. As if perhaps he thought this is where Castiel would try to leave. Where it all started – it would also end.
And he doesn’t need to expand. They all know what he means. He was dreaming of that night. Of that exact moment.
He’s standing next to Dean’s backpack, the horn in his hand. He drops it to the ground and from behind his back he pulls out a green balloon. He walks forward until he is a few metres from the building and then lets it go.
He misses him. Misses the comfort and safety he brings. Misses the skin beneath his fingertips. Misses the firmness of his touch. Misses his warmth.
Since training was called off on Monday due to a storm – much worse than the little bit of rain they experienced the other week – Castiel has had to wait a few extra days than he planned to speak to Dean. He waits quite impatiently, checking his watch every five minutes until the end of the session when everyone is heading off towards the stands after the warm down.
Reyne turns to meet Elaria’s eyes. “If we win, we win. If we lose – if Castiel loses – it won’t change a thing. I will go down fighting into the underworld.”
Dean doesn’t wait after Castiel’s jerkin is on the floor, discarding him of his doublet until he’s laid bare before Dean, a flush rising up his chest.
"An easy route from Iowan. It was the only safe place any of us could flee to without being noticed." Dean nods, picking at the dirt under his nails.
“I brushed it all aside, went along with their conversations because they were my friends but never thought anything of it. Until one day, they invited me in secret to witness a ceremony. So, secret I could not even bring my own personal guard. I was sceptical. But also curious. And I trusted them. So, one night, I slipped out and followed them down underneath the castle. And that’s when I saw him.”
So, he understands why Dean is upset. He understands more than anything. But he doesn’t have the time nor the energy to deal with it. He’s made his peace with how it’s going to go. Now it’s Dean’s turn.
I fantasised about writing the end scene to this chapter for years and finally we are here! Next chapter is up on Saturday! So very excited. Sending my love to you all and of course stay safe ♥
He feels the tears coming then and he can’t stop it. He makes his strides purposefully slow, unsuspicious – because this wasn’t part of the plan but he can’t ruin it now.
Michael stays silent and still and so Castiel sighs and stands, finally letting go of his brother. Finally letting go of everything.
“Would you like me to help you with cleaning the rest of your wounds or would you like Alissande to do it?”
The bus only takes twenty minutes to get there - perks of living near the city - and Dean's surprised when they hop off to find a large crowd of people milling around at the front of the convention centre.
He slips his hand around Castiel’s left wrist, thumb brushing over the skin, over the ridge of his scar.
This is all his fault. All of this. Both Sam’s and Castiel’s life are in danger because of him. How is this his life now? How has all of this come to be? Why is his father doing this to him? Generous? As if giving him time to think about destroying someone is generous.
Dean walks in circles, a hand running over his face, tears slipping quiet and unacknowledged down his cheeks.
Bela turns on him then, hand creeping across the table to cover his own. “You wanna get a drink at my place?”
“The captain has told me a lot about you. Your father was a good man, I hear. Loyal and a good fighter.” Emery nods, making certain that his gaze does not stray from the prince’s. “And from what I’ve seen so far, you have great potential. Don’t let Dimarus down.” His father, Baudet, a pure blood Torric whom served as a noble’s guard for more than a decade is in fact the only reason Emery, a nineteen-year-old half-blood is standing in the royal castle as a royal guard in this fine evening. His father had been shunned for taking a dark-skinned woman from the southern continent as his wife. But he had friends in high places and he was one of the best and brightest. And friends in high places included the father of the current Captain of the Royal Guard.
He’s been trying not to think about it too much, trying to enjoy the moment instead and all that shit, but he knows that eventually the bet will be up and they’ll part ways. He wonders if Castiel will even talk to him after that or go back to being strangers.
Castiel is down in an instant, sweeping Michael’s left leg out from under him causing him to stumble and before he can right himself, he delivers a blow to his chest, sending him crashing onto his back to the ground.
He gazes off, that sadness lingering. Because so much has changed. They’ve been through so much. Castiel’s been through so much.
Thousands attend. Those that were already in the castle and plenty who have come by invitation. Dean sees plenty of familiar faces including Emery’s parents, many of the allies that housed them on their many journeys across the kingdom, including V and her husband.
It’s probably not a good idea. But Dean’s half way drunk so now it is. The phone rings and rings and rings. Dean waits, an empty bottle in his hand. No answer. Dean sighs, waits one minutes and tries again. No answer. He waits two minutes, his patience wearing thin. No answer. Fuck it.
And Dean must know. Must feel the uneven breaths on his skin and the stiffness of his body beneath his palms. Because he doesn’t say anything. Only holds him, steadying the beat of his heart.
No one else had said anything to him after that. The guard with the shy smile and short clipped, brown beard had come again last night but that’s all he really noticed.
He screams and shatters the mirror with his fist, blood spotting on his knuckles. He sinks to the floor as he hears someone burst in then suddenly Dean is there, eyes wide at Castiel sobbing on the floor.
Seb stalks away, grabbing his things before heading to the door and Dean feels guilt simmering inside of him.
“Unfortunately, your punishment for attempting to steal royal jewels had to be moved in here. Sad, really. I just know you would’ve given us a hell of a show.” The guard’s eyes are alight, waiting. Baiting. Castiel stays silent, although it nearly works. He’s never been one for restraint. Let alone for men like this. The guard smiles, pulling on his hair once before letting it go and stepping back. He sweeps his eyes over the other guards and gestures his hand towards Castiel. “Well?”
Dean swoops back down to kiss him, hands this time wandering to the laces of Castiel’s jerkin. Castiel’s breaths are heavy when they part but not because of the kiss. Although thankfully, because of Dean’s own heavy panting, the man doesn’t notice.
But he didn’t die. Castiel saved him. And although Castiel almost died, it wasn’t Dean who saved him. Dean could only sit there hopeless as he almost suffered the same fate.
Sam insists on riding with him again – only making Castiel’s palms sweat and his stomach tighten. He managed on the way here so he can do it on the way back. At least, that’s what he tells himself.
Snowflakes fall to the ground, catching Nicolaus' coat and blonde hair on the way. He brushes them off, looking up to the sky to see dark clouds to the east.
They chat for a little while before the movie begins but when it does they of course delve into silence and Castiel is keenly aware of their knees and shoulders brushing.
The guard bangs on the crate again. “You even listenin’ to me, thief? The Crown Prince will be serving out your punishment. You got that?”
And maybe he’s just overthinking it and he should just enjoy the game and the to-be kiss and the company before it all ends.
Castiel stands frozen in the grass as Dean disappears into the trees. He doesn’t know what to do. Should he follow or stay behind? If he follows will it just incite more rage? But if he stays behind – in the state Dean’s in, he fears for his safety.
The carriage comes to a halt at the end of the bridge. The men in front discuss something quietly before pulling the reins and veering the horses to the left, avoiding the main street into the town. Castiel pushes himself off the wall of the inn – travellers and stable boys forgotten – and with his hands on the hilt of his swords, he follows.
"Me, too. Maybe we could do this some other time?" Castiel bites his lip, scuffing his shoes against the pavement before nodding.
He’s halfway through speaking to one noble when he remembers. The first ball they attended together, Castiel had seemed on edge and had snapped at him for suggesting Castiel had wanted to dance.
"Uh - hi," the older girl starts. "I was wondering if you could help us with some recommendations?" Castiel smiles.
And he knows she must see it. In her, he finds the same carefree child, only more grown and mature, not naïve about the world anymore but still retaining her joyful soul.
The only thing he can do is face him once more. So, he rises, dressing slowly and breathing deeply to calm his nerves. The dining hall is empty. No Dean or breakfast waiting for them. Another deep breath and Castiel pushes forward.
“Well, it is for now.” Dean’s eyes find him then, guilt and gratefulness clashing together. He nods jerkily.
Now, he doesn’t bother with knocking, opening Dean’s chambers and stepping inside. It’s flooded with light, the curtains pulled back fully, and the bed is neatly made. Dean, fully dressed and ready for the day, leans back in his chair, boots up and crossed on his desk as he writes something down on a piece of parchment.
Dean’s heart thuds inside of him. “Cas,” he breathes. But before he can say anymore Castiel is pushing himself to his feet.
“The pleasure was all mine,” Emery responds, nodding his head politely. The prince, still standing beside Castiel, is shooting a strange look in his new guard’s direction.
