"Throw it to Elliot!" Gabriel shouted at him, and Kevin tossed it as far as he could to their teammate.
"Oh, you brought a friend," his uncle said. Banshee slid onto the ground and yawned. Miracle sat and wagged his tail, waiting for the female to catch up.
Dean gave Jesse a half smile and turned back to the newspaper. Him and Sam always had fun themselves when they were asked to repeat the phrase as kids. "Use the stall and don't fall in." The kid made his way over to the coffee shop bathroom at a quick pace.
Jesse had already sucked the last bit of chocolate milk out of his yoohoo but he decided to keep going, making that annoying noise that a straw sucking at emptiness made and nearly swallowing the straw.
"Oh. Yeah." Gabriel shrugged. "No big deal."
Dean's eyes widened. "What? Is she hurt? Was she on a hunt?"
Cas let out a short "Ha". It was quiet again for awhile. "So, Cassie?"
Dean softly kisses the back of his neck, a kiss so soft it doesn’t fit in with the harsh scene. As a point, Dean’s thrusts lose control. His breath is heaving in and out, tickling Cas’s hair and behind his ear.
“Who?!” Jo asked excitedly.
Cas gives her a dangerous look and she rolls her eyes, “Fine!”
Cas rolls onto his back with a groan, “Then what are you waiting for?”
He parks in the back, facing a fence crawling with kudzu. He turns off the engine and hoists himself onto the top bunk, drawing the stout yet thick curtain. He doesn’t even take off his boots, just laying face first into his mildewy pillow.
“Jack, Dean probably doesn’t want a bunch of food in his nice car. Besides, we-”
Dean notices the sky has clouded over as Cas locks the door.
They both hide their own smiles as they get into the car. But Dean can’t keep the grin away from the sight of Cas sitting in his front seat.
“I never said that.”
“Well, it’s true!” Ash looked over to Cas and raised his beer, “But you’re with us now. We’ll fix your rap sheet in no time.”
“Howdy, boys,” the new man says.
Drex didn’t respond. Dean groaned, knowing Drex to be stubborn. Exhausted, Dean rolled his eyes and went over to the couch.
Castiel looked down and didn’t respond. He was mad, but he didn’t know if he was ready to express everything he was feeling.
“Yeah, it’s bullshit. Hey, I have to call an Uber, or cab or whatever I can find in this hodunk town. I’ll talk to you later, ‘kay?” Dean rushes, just not wanting to have his little brother go all lawyer on him right now.
“Goodnight, Jack,” Cas replies. He pauses and then turns around on the couch to call out, “And brush your frickin’ teeth, please!”
Cas’s breath shallows. It’s true, he has been much more docile than their previous encounters. He burrows his face into Dean more, “I have a lot on my mind is all.”
Dean grunted; there was some fumbling going on between their bodies on Dean’s part. Castiel heard a zipper and felt knuckles brush the base of his cock. Castiel tried not to show how much that brief, accidental touch affected him by burying his face into the spot he’d been kissing at Dean’s shoulder.
The fact that this was Castiel between his legs, almost aggressively bobbing his head up and down Dean’s hard cock, was enough to have Dean reeling. Castiel pulled to the tip and Dean could feel his tongue play and taste around the entire sensitive head, flattening against his urethra. Dean jolted, realizing his breathing had gotten short, and fisted Castiel’s hair, spitting out, “Nn! God, Cas, you’re fucking mouth.”
“He should be in juvie!” Raul chimed in.
Castiel’s instincts warned him of some danger. But he was either brave or dumb, because instead of running, an old classic kicked out of his mouth: “Leave me alone.”
Castiel nodded. He took a deep breath and his loose tongue said, “If Ash can keep his hands off me.”
“Dean,” Cas mutters between moans as he fully seats himself on Dean. It’s somewhat dry - even from the water and mild lube - but Cas is twitching to move back up. Dean doesn’t let him, pressing so hard up and into Cas that they're pressed against the tiled wall, his arms being pinned upwards. Cas yelps out while Dean tries to control his breath, feeling Cas clench around his cock.
Then, suddenly, he was there at the edge of it all. His fingers tugged at a fistful of Dean’s hair, so quickly overcome by a wave of lust that he didn’t even have time to pull away and warn Dean. He wouldn’t know what to say anyway.
He had started stepping out of his uniform when Dean walked in, sitting at the same locker he had yesterday. Castiel wondered why he was using this particular locker, since it wasn’t his locker for P.E. It was odd, but nothing for Castiel to lose sleep over.
Castiel looked around. He supposed there weren’t many decorations, but he’d never thought about putting anything up.
The memories have been something that Cas had been good at suppressing, but they have been resurfacing in a most peculiar way for Cas.
Dean’s hand knots through Cas’s hair as he starts to suck him in and out of his throat. Cas can hear Dean lose his breath, Cas’s nose nearly pressing into the shortened hairs at Dean’s pelvis. Cas can’t help but open his eyes to look up and see what kind of mess he’s made. He catches Dean’s darkened eyes gazing back. They go wide for a moment, before darkening even further, his jaw clenching and grip in Cas’s hair tightening as he snarls, “So this is what you want? Just suck my dick?”
Cas’s grip in Dean’s hair tightens as he snarls, “Fucking do it already.”
“Well,” Dean begins, stopping only a foot away from Cas, “Is there anything I owe you then?”
“Did you see where Castiel put the keys after he locked up? He seems to have misplaced them,” Coach asked, eyeing Castiel haughtily.
Castiel’s eyes came up to bore into Asmod’s. He took a deep breath, and spit in Asmod’s face.
Dean heard the door burst open and someone rushed to the bathroom. Ash’s voice was echo-y as he called out excitedly, “Guys! Two words: Pool! Party! C’mon!”
Cas reaches for his phone in his pocket and looks at the time. While looking at the time, he also double checks that he has no messages. No messages.
He heard Dean sigh and then walk away. Castiel started cleaning off the mats. He finished stacking them, wondering what was taking Dean so long. Castiel had resolved that he would walk home in his wrestling singlet, having put on his jersey coat and grey sweats he’d bought at a school thrift event, hanging off his hips by a shoestring.
Castiel’s pace across Dean’s muscles picked up as his next words rushed out, “I just want you to tell me if you’re not- interested, after all.”
to relax,” Drex said, his hands hesitating, “Your back is all kinds of jacked up.”

But Castiel couldn’t answer that. He remembered Dean standing over him that day in the hall, but it’s not as if he had done what Asmod had wanted. If anything, he had merely taken the fall for Asmod and his gang. And it wasn’t like Castiel had stood up for Dean either. However, that proved to Castiel again that he was a burden to anyone who touched his life. Castiel was resolved; it was better for everyone if Dean stayed away.
“She told me,” Castiel snapped his mouth shut. He didn’t want to talk about Anna without her there.
Cas’s mouth kisses at the slick, bruised crook of skin that connects Dean’s shoulder to his neck, mumbling, “Do you want to...?”
Also, Dean really wanted to stick it to his boss, Ketch. He hadn’t been happy to find out about Dean’s frequent overnight stops in Bootbock, Kansas. He was always a snarky asshole, trying to put a muzzle on Dean as if he knew anything. This extra pay was a testament to Dean’s independent spirit.
“Quick! Drink it! Shit!” Jo and Ash shouted as Dean quickly began drinking down the beer. He chugged it all, Jo and Ash egging him on all the way. Castiel couldn’t help eyeing Dean’s throat as he gulped it down.
“Come on, man,” Asmod pressured, “Teach this bitch a lesson!”
Jack looks to the side but nods, stepping back. Cas walks through, following Jack and closing the door behind him.
“Fuck.”
“Someone has to be here for the locksmith, but you insist on taking me to school!” Jack whines as a counterpoint as he sets his dishes in the kitchen sink.
Dean’s eyes catch the glimmer of his keys swinging from his ignition as they shimmer against the rising sun. Attached to the ring is the key to Cas’s apartment.
Dean dared to lick Castiel’s lips, tempting him to taste him too. Castiel slowly sucked Dean’s tongue against his, and Dean felt a heat pool in his pelvis at a speed that was only possible for a horny teenage boy.
“Yeah, yeah,” Cas says with a sigh, putting the cup on the counter and finishing the pour there instead. He knows that if she’s out partying tonight then there’s no way she’ll be here early tomorrow, if at all. Nonetheless, he was somewhat pleased to see some gratitude from her. There were some days that if someone did her a favor you’d hear zip from her. She must be in a truly good mood, skipping over to a table of a modest sized family that had just arrived.
“Ah!” Castiel called in surprise.
Dean chuckled and his hand slowly slid from Castiel’s back. He shook his head, “Nah, not me. I’m in the house.”
And with that sad outlook in mind, he drifts to the bathroom, undresses methodically, and starts cleaning his ass.
Cas resists with all his might to roll his eyes, because the question is so ridiculous; there are a million ways to get that answer other than asking Cas. Besides, Jack had said he had asked for Cas specifically…
Castiel reacted by pushing against Dean more, kiss deepening as his tongue licked into his mouth. Dean’s tongue worked against the soft muscle shared between their connected lips. He’d never really french kissed a lot of girls, but he couldn’t seem to get enough where Castiel was concerned. This was especially odd, considering Dean was typically the one to try and initiate this level of making out.
“But, I-” Castiel began to protest, but Dean shot him a look and Castiel quickly shut his mouth, muttering to the coach, “I’ll go look again.”
Cas takes a deep breath and hesitates. He really doesn’t want to go over there, doesn’t want to let this guy walk all over him and demand a free meal or something.
Cas lifts the shot and says, “Thanks. Cheers.”
Looking up at Dean while he sucks him off, Cas catches his eyes and Dean’s cock twitches in his throat. Maintaining eye contact, Cas pops off of Dean’s cock. He takes Dean’s hand from his shoulder and brings two fingers into his mouth.
“Why not?” Bobby persists.
He gave her a kiss on the cheek and she shoved him so roughly he fell backwards onto the couch opposite the one Dean and Castiel were seated at.
“Wow, we’re really rubbing off on you,” Dean noted.
Taking a deep breath, he sits up gingerly. The pain isn’t unbearable, but damn near close, so nothing broken per se. He sits up and looks around; his radio is smashed, the walkie talkie dangling from its coiled cord. He searches for his phone and finds it on the floorboard; no service. Finally he checks his wristwatch; almost half past four.
“Something seems to be the matter,” Cas persists, sitting down next to Jack.
Anna and Castiel’s look shifted from intensity to curiosity.
Dean had been silent that entire time, thumb right outside his rim and other hand resting on top of Cas’s clothed back. But, as Cas has him bottoming out in him, Dean comes to life. He grabs and squeezes at Cas’s hip and ass, leaning over him so that Dean’s chest was back on Cas’s shoulders, his nose right behind Cas’s ear and Dean’s lips at the top of his neck.
Jack isn’t phased at Dean’s uproar, merely cocking a brow and frowning in confusion, “‘Twink’? Like, Hostess?”
Castiel was about to feel ashamed for missing out on when Dean shook his head and looked back over to Castiel, “I’ll try to record it next time it’s on to show you later. It’ll blow your gourd, dude.”
“O-okay,” Castiel covered his eyes with his forearms.
Dean goes red as he watches Cas pull down his pants and briefs. He grits his teeth and covers his eyes with one of his hands, “No, I guess not. I just haven’t seen you in a while and I just thought- Ah!”
“Yeah, about that…” Dean trailed off mischievously.
It went down easily, and Castiel only stumbled a little to flip it upside down before he took the next. And then the next. And the next. Dean and Ash cheered as Castiel downed the fourth. Then, silence again as Castiel took the fifth and last shot just as easily as he had the others.
As he went about his apartment - it was too clean, it was too dirty, he had dressed too nicely, he dressed too casually - he felt the plug like a lump of anticipation. He bent over as little as possible and let the lust pool in his pelvis.
“Well,” Anna said with a more positive tone, “At least you’re done with detention, huh?”
A few minutes later, Castiel looked up as Dean began to walk back over the rocks. His backpack was still on his shoulder, and Castiel scooted over anxiously as Dean walked back up the slope. He sat down at Castiel’s side with a grunt, pulling his backpack to his front. He smirked and quipped talkatively, “Sonny gave me this backpack and makes me take it to school. Thought it’d be a total drag, but it’s actually pretty nifty!”
“I-it wa-was a l-late one,” Jervis chuckled.
“Ha, sort of,” Dean wonders how much this kid actually knows about cars.
Castiel heard Dean exhale shakily as he pulled the rest of Castiel’s singlet up and down to gather at his thick thighs. Castiel’s cock still got stuck on the fold, though, bobbing out and hitting against his pelvis heavily.
With lightning speed, Jo picked up and down one, two, three,
Only an hour later - although it feels like only a minute to a groggy Dean - there’s a knock at the door. Dean’s heart overrides his need for sleep, eyes stinging as he forces them open. His painfully sore joints creak as he makes his way to the peephole.
“You hear about that storm rolling in?” Donna asks in her midwestern drawl, cutting into the omelette Cas had brought her.
Dean growls and his hand scoops under Cas’s leg and pulls it up. His leg is momentarily caught on his pants, but Dean helps push it off so he can properly hook his arm under Cas’s knee.
Castiel smiled back, “I’ll see you tonight.”
Dean leans down to kiss Cas, leaving Cas to the mercy of Dean.
“Like, we can do anything here!” Dean ran forward a distance and Castiel watched as he did a haphazard cartwheel. Castiel laughed and clapped softly.
“No,” Cas replies matter of factly.
Cas catches them and breaks the kiss, saying against Dean’s lips, “Not here.”
“My life is shit, Cas,” Dean finally says, “But when I’m with you, I forget about all of that. I just want to be with you, okay? Don’t make me talk about that mushy, past shit, please. I’m fine with you not caring. I get it.”
Dean looks surprised for a moment, then gives a toothy grin, “You like?”
“What are you doing?” Cas bites out.
Dean rubbed the back of his neck and asked, “You’re still going to come help with the party, right?”
This was one hell of a situation he was finding himself in. In the ten and some odd years he’s been a trucker, he’d never known anybody that had used a runaway ramp. Or had been hit by a landslide, for that matter. Dean gives a self deprecating chuckle and hangs his head; this is just his luck.
Anna blushed furiously and defended, “No! I’m just curious! I heard something really sad about him today…”
“Argh! You’re no fun!” Jo sighed and slumped into the couch.
“I’m glad you’re here,” Anna added quietly.
“That ain’t gonna work on me, son,” Bobby says, wheeling himself past Dean to the kitchen, “You know good and well I’m stuck on studies. Now let’s talk about the shithole you’ve gotten yourself into this time.”
Dean exclaims, his hand moving down from stroking Cas’s mouth to gripping his throat. Cas feels his cock jerk in want. Dean thrusts in all the way and grinds. The combination of feeling Dean so deep and being choked nearly sends Cas over the edge.
“Oh,” Dean started, as if shaken out of a daydream. He blinked at Castiel and laughed with embarrassment. He looked away, rubbing at his neck, “I don’t know, I guess I just never saw you smile before is all.”
Cas exits the restaurant that still needs closing, locking the front door. He’ll be back soon, but right now he just has a craving to see and talk with his son. Being with Jack is grounding.
Taking a deep breath, he comes around the corner and behind the bar, plastering the fakest, biggest smile he can on his face. He grabs the coffee decanter roughly and begins topping off Dean’s mug.
“Hey, you guys!” Ash’s voice called from behind Dean.
“Over here,” Benny’s voice comes closer, “Man, they put you on Bright Lights for real?”
“Nn,” Castiel moaned into his mouth. But it wasn’t a moan. Castiel pushed back on Dean, breaking the kiss and saying, “No, Dean. We can’t.”
“Suppose all those things they say about you and that cop are just bullshit then,” Al tried to snarl.
“It’s okay,” Castiel choked out, not really sure if it was okay.
Dean bit his lip, hesitated, then asked, “Well, actually, what are you doing this weekend?”
“Directions,” Cas says quickly. Jack’s head tilts curiously, opening his mouth with no doubt another question, but Cas cuts him off, walking away as he says, “I’m taking a break.”
The searing hot water is much more welcoming to Dean’s aching skin. The doctor had given him all these aftercare precautions, especially about the stitches being wet for too long. But as the grime from Dean’s extensive journey melts off him, so do any of his cares.
Now it’s Dean’s turn to be in shock, “Uh, woah.”
Dean leaves the bathroom door cracked open for any subsequent steam. Firstly, he gets out his toothbrush to just get that out of the way. He then turns the shower faucet and let’s it run to get hot as he deftly undresses, being careful of his injuries and setting his arm brace on the sink’s counter. He gives himself a cursory glance in the mirror’s reflection - his hairy, bruised and battered face’s reflection staring back - but he can’t stand what he sees for too long.
“How are you holding up?” Anna asked.
“Yeah, you ride that dick so good, angel!” Dean moans from behind him. Cas’s hips stutter and he locks down his hips as he’s fully seated on Dean. He didn’t expect Dean to call him his pet name from high school. Maybe Dean has called all the people he’s fucked since then ‘angel.’ The thought infuriates Cas further. He rubs Dean around inside of him as he growls out, “Don’t call me that!”
Castiel entered the locker room after the last bell of the school day came.
“Ah hells yeah!” Ash hooted.
Dean moves a little closer, chuckling as he says, “Yep. Living the dream.”
Dean said, “Meet me in the school parking lot at eleven? I’ll walk us the rest of the way.”
Dean’s at half a pack a day, but he’s too drained to care. He’d hitched a ride from another trucker going to the office after getting off at the transient bus stop, basically traveling nonstop after being discharged from the hospital. But upon arriving, Ketch had stopped him at the door and brought him outside where they were alone. Dean can tell this isn’t going to be good.
Cas lazily tugs at the back of his flannel, breaking the kiss as it falls to floor with everything else there.
“So,” Dean seemed really scared, “We’re still friends?”
Cas thanks Bart again before turning and catching Jack at the bar.
“Why?” Castiel asked stubbornly.
“What?” Castiel asked innocently.
Dean knows he should leave, knows that Cas needs space and to be respected. Yet, his feet refuse to budge. Cas doesn’t make a move either. Dean rubs the back of his neck and just let’s his mouth take control over his brain, “Y’know… I could go with you to pick up Jack. In the Impala, I mean.”
All Castiel could focus on were two large, green eyes staring at him. Staring at Castiel with an unreadable, straightfaced countenance. Castiel held his eyes for one more moment before turning away again. The other boys booed.
Dean tries not to squirm in his chair, “‘Til I was twenty-eight? So, um… Oh, geez, let me think… Three, four… Nine… Yeah, eleven years.”
“Ya up on ‘ur high horse again, sister?” a low, sonorous Louisiana drawl slurs over Meg’s last words.
Castiel left, walking home along the road as the sun began to set. Autumn hadn’t quite taken over summer yet, and the day was still proving to be long. The sunset accompanied Castiel all the way home. The entire time, his mind was full of Dean’s voice, saying, “Cas… Cas… Cas…”
Castiel’s wanton breathing hiccups and he nodded against Dean’s forehead. Dean found the power to open his eyes a little so he could watch Castiel’s lustful face. Castiel’s hands grabbed onto Dean’s jacket and the tree behind him for support.
Cas starts lifting and smacking his ass down to meet Dean’s slower thrusts, trying to coerce him to pick up the pace. Cas’s hands come to push at the kitchen counter as it begins to work, them both sweating as Dean moves in and out of Cas.
Cas bites his lip. It’s a crazy question to ask at a moment like this, and Cas feels thrown off. Of course he hasn’t been with anyone else, of course he’s hung onto every interaction with Dean like it would be his last testament to romance.
Dean’s skin was hot, as if he had a fever. But his muscles were strong and clenched under Castiel’s grip. Dean was slightly bigger too, making Castiel have to get up higher and closer on Dean in order to properly wrap his arm around Dean’s chest.
Lucifer took out a lighter from his jean pocket, using it to pop off the bottle cap from his beer, letting it clatter to the floor. He leaned against the cabinets and took a swig, replying loudly, “My problem? My problem?! It’s their goddamn problem! If we don’t come back in this quarter we’re totally fucked!”
Castiel sighed and let go of Dean’s shirt, not realizing he had been holding his breath or onto Dean. Castiel shook his head in embarrassment. Dean was probably going to laugh at him again for acting so ridiculous.
“Do you drink?” Dean’s question cut through Castiel’s racing thoughts.
“Oh my god, Dean, you
“So you’re just faking not knowing stuff?” Castiel asked skeptically.
A phone alarm is sounding throughout the dimmed room, jolting a sleeping Dean. He’s alone in Cas’s bed - a new sensation, since he’s the one to always leave in the early morning. But it isn’t the morning now, Dean can tell from his grogginess.
Life went on, though.
Castiel took it gingerly, “Thank you. I don’t know what I can do to repay you for all you’ve done.”
Castiel shook his head. Ash gaped in surprise, “Then how do you even know you’re gay?”
“Shit!” She said with a sigh, “You pick who goes first.”
On his way to his locker, he saw Anna approaching from the other end of the hall. She was walking and talking with someone. Walking and laughing, rather, with Dean.
“Mm. He had a rough time, y’know. Probably just wanted to forget it all,” Bobby waxes.
Even then, he walks with trepidation to the area. Peeking around the corner, he sighs with relief that the booth Dean had been occupying is now vacant. The dining area is completely back at its humble occupancy.
Cas looks away, staring at his ceiling. His mouth contorts, considering it. He shakes his head, “No.”
“Totally,” Dean is too tired to fight Cas on what he feels comfortable with, “I’m nearly there anyway.”
Cas hangs up.
Soon, Ash had tuckered himself out and was snoring loudly, arm dangling off the side of the bed closest to the window. Dean had gotten ready for bed quickly while Castiel had been in the shower. He was casually sitting up on his side of the bed watching some dumb sitcom on the fuzzy screened color TV. But the boisterous laugh track was only a background to Dean’s own divine comedy.
Dean chuckles and moves his hand away, traveling over Cas’s ass before he falls on the bed next to him. But Cas is still leaning against the headboard, feeling unable to move, even to lay down.
“You have a good enough taste?” Cas asks coldly. He sits up fully on Dean’s face. Dean’s voice is suffocated under Cas riding his mouth, “I could eat you all night.”
Asmod smiled and nodded. Al lunged at Dean from behind as Asmod charged him from the front. Dean ducked and threw Al’s stumbling body over his head. Al tumbled and landed on his back with a groan. Asmod merely ran over his friend’s body as he continued to charge, knife first. The knife was coming right at Dean’s chest.
Dean scoffs, “You gave me your address!”
The engine rumbled idly in the driveway while Castiel’s mind went into overdrive. The tree trunk wasn’t too thick, he had only enough space to press his back against it as he pulled Dean in, and then Dean had to stand in front of him and not beside him to be concealed. But Castiel wasn’t thinking about how close they were, his head turned to listen and concentrate on the truck.
Dean looked over to him, a little surprised. Castiel’s eyes narrowed in confusion. Dean cleared his throat and looked off again, shrugging, “I mean, what could I say? She seemed like she wanted to get serious or something.”
Castiel shook his head like a child; he wasn’t going anywhere. A wetness seeped into his eye and it stung. He broke his angry concentration to wipe at it with his other hand absently. He heard Dean sigh and felt him let go of his wrist, letting his arm fall to his side limply. Then, Dean was in his personal space. Castiel’s breath caught as he looked up at Dean with the other eye that was getting more swollen and sensitive from Asmod’s punch.
Dean peed anyway, trying to clear his mind from his worry. He took his time washing his hands and stared into the mirror. He wondered how such a good looking face couldn’t just fall for a hot girl in his class like any other guy. When he’d first recognized he had feelings for Castiel... Well, it hadn’t been as easy as that. He’d spent countless sleepless nights, wandering around town alone in the dark and trying to convince himself he wasn’t having the emotions he had. But when he first had started to come to terms with it (after he’d let his drunken self fall into giving Castiel a kiss that night before Halloween), he hadn’t been able to look in the mirror for days afterward. Now felt different, staring into his own eyes.
“I can do it,” Castiel said, reaching up to take the sanitary wipe from Dean’s hand. Castiel took a glance at the partly used wipe before patting at his forehead with a clean side. He looked out at the glimmering water and asked, “How did you get all this stuff anyway?”
He’s about to head in when his phone starts buzzing. Cas heart pounds and his feet still. He pulls out his phone to see that Dean is calling.
“It’s a long story,” Dean responds, “I’ll tell you about it later. But now I’m just sort of… Showing up to Cas’s?”
He goes to pour a fresh cup when he notices Donna and Jody eyeing him. Cas looks away and bites his lip. He remembers what Meg said at the bar a couple months ago, about how Met had talked to everyone about hearing him with Dean. Benny had been at the bar that night and-
Castiel readjusted Samandriel on his hip, although the child paid no mind as he watched Anna with his hand in his mouth. Castiel didn’t know what to think. He bit his lip, “Well, I-”
“Then why did you ask me here tonight?” Dean hits back.
So that’s how Dean finds himself sitting at Cas’s humble dinner table with his son he’d just met today, passing the salt. They’d made dinner together, and Dean surprised everyone that he was actually a pretty decent cook.
Cas whips his head towards her, brow furrowed, “And what is that supposed to mean?”
“I haven’t let you down yet, have I?”
affected Dean, and
“Huh,” Cas replies shortly, moving his head to get away from Dean’s lips, “I’ll clean on my own time, thanks.”
“Yeah. And by the way, why are you calling at, like, five in the morning?”
Dean grumbles impatiently; he and Charlie have talked about this specific topic several times in the past. She had been in the same infantry as him in the marines, but had gone separate ways during their tours. Now, she’s some UI genius at a nice cooperation, but the two still stay in close contact.
Cas’s limbs are like the branches of a burnt tree; charred to a crisp, completely unmalleable yet if even a breath of wind should pass then he’d crumble to ash.
“But yeah, I came to see you,” Dean continues, licking his lips. Cas isn’t able to control his face this time as he gets caught in the tractor beam of Dean’s eyes. Dean offers a flirtatious smile, “I mean, come on, can you blame me? I can’t stop thinking about you.”
Cas imagines Jack with his cookie cereal and chuckles. He doesn’t mind Jack having breakfast (or, really, dessert) for dinner because he’s had a hard day. Cas is just glad that Jack can come home and relax. When he was his age, a bad day would happen and Cas had to endure and function through it with zero support.
He’s almost done mopping the front of house when the tape clicks to an end. Cas grimaces at the ocean of partially wet floors he’d have to tiptoe through to get to the player. Instead, he sighs and cleans in the silence of the closed, half-lit diner.
Dean got lost in looking into Castiel’s eyes again, “Uh, okay.”
Both their breathing levels out and Dean slowly pulls out of Cas. Cas can feel the cum running out of his asshole as it spasms. Dean touches Cas’s ass for a moment and says with wonder, “Fuck, that’s so hot.”
“Well, can we just talk then?”
Their grunts of attack, defense, frustration echoed the empty and dark gymnasium. The rhythm of the fight had been set, and Castiel’s mind jumped around like electricity leaps through cables to its source.
Lucifer turns to Cas and smiles, “Long time no see, little bro.”
A grin spread over Jo’s face and she joshed, “Finally, Ash says something smart.”
Dean feels Cas’s hardening cock press into the curve of Dean’s ass and his own member reacts. Cas should already know the answer to that question, Dean thinks as he turns around to face the man. He crowds into Cas’s space and continues their passionate kiss from earlier.
There wasn’t much time for more protesting as Drex went to work on Dean’s back. He squeezed his eyes closed and gripped at the sheets.
“What? I just need to lie down, I’ll be fine-”
“I’m fine,” Dean said too suddenly.
“You really don’t want things to change, huh?” Dean asked.
A tragedy occurs right after they all finish doing dishes together: Dean finds out that Jack has never watched
The bed squeaks and heaves, and then Dean is next to Cas. He holds his breath, and then Dean’s arms are against his chest, bringing him in close.
Castiel exhaled slowly, “I trust you.”
Dean huffs a chuckle and readjusts. His lips wrap around Cas’s cockhead; he pushes down. Cas bites down on his lip, trying to control the onslaught of pleasure by measuring his heavy breaths. Dean is shallow, and it is by no means a skillful blowjob, but it is Dean’s mouth on Cas’s cock, moving up and down at a slow rate that threatens Cas’s sanity.
“Catch the ball! Catch the ball! Oh! Are you kidding me?! Holy shit, you fucking-!” Luci’s voice boomed from the opposite room. The disruption not only made Castiel and Dean jump, but also Samandriel began to quietly cry into Castiel’s neck.
Castiel flushed as Dean looked over to him, lightly biting his lower lip. Castiel looked away for a moment as he shrugged, “I guess.”
“Yo, Charlie.”
Dean and Sam share a laugh and say their goodbyes. Dean puts away his phone, having no actual intention of calling a taxi service (if there really is one in the tiny town), really trying to pinch pennies. He attempts to walk the distance, but with his aching joints and wounds he promptly relents to take a breather. Instead, he thumbs a ride from a local farm hand to the outskirts of town, where his destination lies.
“Jesus,” Dean whispers like someone punched him in the gut.
“He asked for you by name,” Jack adds. Cas reels around to him with wide eyes. Jack’s face is confused as he asks, “Do you know him?”
Dean slid one strap down Castiel’s shoulder. Castiel whimpered. Of course, he and Dean changed next to each other in the locker room all the time, but it never felt like this.
Castiel gave a defeated smile and leaned over to kiss Dean one last time. Short, yet tender, Castiel left without another word.
Dean’s chest leaves Cas’s back and he starts thrusting, occasionally meeting Cas halfway so their bodies smack together. Cas is moaning, mind landing on the flimsiest excuse: “You have a good cock. Get over yourself.”
Cas is devastated, “How?!”
The engine cuts off and the lights disappear. But then a truck door opens and closes, there are footsteps nearby. They approach, stop… they get closer.
Anna scooted forward eagerly, “Robin saw him at Cus’s Place. She has such a big crush on him, she was gushing about him forever today! He’s supposed to be so cute!”
Castiel did turn around to Dean at that tone, met with a gaze that was equally as fiery as his own. Dean broke eye contact first, sighing and shaking his head. He gave Castiel a once over and walked towards him. He grabbed Castiel’s wrist and kept walking, saying, “Come with me.”
“You may want to watch where you’re going,” the man chastises.
sleeping with him... Jack is my son.”
Dean exhales like he’s been punched, but respects the shot, “I thought I explained to you already, it’s not like that.”
Castiel’s eye darted over to the embankment. Dean was opening a bandage when Castiel whispered, “Thank you, Dean.”
Castiel nodded hesitantly.
Dean’s groan intensified and he folded his arms around his head, shoving his face into the mass he’d fallen onto - Castiel and Drex’s bed.
Their eyelids slip all the way closed as Dean’s tongue slides against Cas’s.
“Dean, you don’t have to-”
Jack chuckles, “Thank you. Oh, and you don’t have to whisper. Cas is such a heavy sleeper. What’s that saying? A bomb could go off and he wouldn’t wake up.”
“Thank you, Cas! I love it!” Jack gushes over the motor scooter with a big bow on it.
Dean doesn’t wait, he bites his lip before asking, “You want me to leave?”
“Alright,” Cas feels a sudden lump in his throat.
Another bag flies in the dumpster.
Cas is looking out the window and pointing as he directs. When he turns back to the man he notices that he has been staring at his face and not seeming to focus on what he’s saying. Cas is really beginning to feel creeped out. His brow lifts as he asks patronizingly, “Should I write it down?”
He’s so swept away by having Dean fuck him that when Dean moves his hands away from Cas’s wrists he doesn’t try to get away, just wraps his arms around Dean’s back and holds on like his life depends on it. Dean grunts happily, letting up on Cas’s legs too, who promptly wraps them around Dean’s waist.
“We’re war buddies,” Benny responds with a light tone that shrouds a heavier context.
“Fuck, Cas, is that your-?” Dean didn’t have time to finish asking Castiel if that was his own cock rubbing up against Dean’s, bare and wanting. Castiel kept taking control of Dean’s mouth, seeming insistent that they remain kissing. Dean didn’t mind, kissing him back as his hands slipped to the barely naked top part of Castiel’s ass.
In hindsight, it had been a good move (for the sex, at least) to masturbate when he came home, since the impromptu penetration was fairly clean and loose. He is kicking himself for not using a condom or something, not trusting Dean’s sexual health. He takes his second shower for the day and pays extra care to make sure his anus isn’t torn or bleeding.
Castiel admitted the defeat, ducking his head as he started to walk along the treeline with Dean. He kept rubbing at his eye that had blood dripping into it, making it difficult to see properly. But Castiel walked along, holding his broken backpack by the top handle.
“Say it,” Dean demands in the same soft tone, his eyes glistening. Cas can only lie there and take the slow push and pull of Dean’s cock, staring into his green eyes hopelessly. Cas can’t find it in him to say anything other than: “Fuck you.”
“Guess you thought wrong.”
Dean laughed sarcastically, harshly, “Oh, you have got to be kidding me!”
“Shhh!” Castiel whispered, “It’s right there!”
Dean kissed behind Castiel’s ear as he pointed Castiel’s cock towards the tree. He watched Castiel’s cum shoot out of him and paint the bark, feeling the boy’s dick pulse in his hand.
Cas stares at Dean’s clean throat. Dean’s breath tickles his cheek, “Sorry I’m late.”
Dean’s brow crinkles a bit, strange that Cas doesn’t already know the answer. He reaches out his hand and finds Cas’s, feeling a mighty need to touch him as he answers: “Because you’re here.”
The back of Dean’s hand came up to his forehead and he pretended to faint. Castiel laughed and looked over to Dean, who came to life with a small bow. Castiel clapped sarcastically, “Wow. You should have joined the theater club, you’re really missing your calling.”
Cas feels his precum drip down his hard cock, bobbing with the wantan humping. He looks over to Dean and says between his moans, “What about it?”
“There are burgers at McDonald’s. You should try one,” Cas spits back through his toothy smile.
His first evil idea melts into another as he feels Dean’s hardening dick against his own member growing through their jeans. And hell, the first idea worked out so well, so maybe…
“Don’t pressure the baby!” Ash laughed.
Dean looks at Peterbilt again. Compared to his service, this is nothing. And Cas will never take him in or back; that’s a pipe dream that Dean’s careful not to confuse with reality. Cas hates him, for good reason, and Dean’s pretty sure he wouldn’t want to house a deadbeat so unexpectedly for an unknown period of time.
“Hey!” A voice came from behind the group. Asmod looked behind him just as his face connected with a fist. Asmod fell to the ground, looking up to see the person whose fist broke open his nose.
“Kiss me?” Dean breathed.
The last verbal bullet flew and Castiel could see from Dean’s expression that it was a bullseye.
“Dean!” is the only thing Cas can manage to moan at the moment, shivering under the sensation of Dean’s cock.
He has to call a million people, do a million things, and he feels like he may need to go to the hospital. He gently fingers the head wound from earlier and notices that the blood’s gone crusty. At least he’s stopped bleeding, so it can't be too bad.
Jack chews on this while he chews on his last bits of cereal. Dean looks at him skeptically, “Why are you so interested in me?”
Dean’s breath is just as lost as Cas’s. Cas feels Dean’s hands slowly trail down Cas’s back before pulling out his softened cock. Cas shudders and gasps weakly.
Cas tries not to roll his eyes and smiles fondly. The words would sound like a joke if it weren’t coming from Jack, bless that kid. An honest kid. And perhaps he would make some friends by being the designated driver. He turns his eyes back to Jack and squeezes his arm, “Just be safe, okay?”
“Sundays are slow after the church rush,” Cas observes, “Besides, I think the diner will survive one day without us.”
He looked over to her, “What?”
Bart crosses his arms and Cas knows he’s probably right. He knows letting the kid’s off the hook must not sit well with his real full time employees. Although it wouldn’t be enough to hurt their friendship; all three of them had gone through a lot together, and it seems as though Bart is more concerned about Cas than about Jack going to a party.
“Ah, Cas, Jesus,” Dean’s voice chokes out, “Shouldn’t we, uh, I don’t know, talk first and stuff?”
“Mm,” Dean growls, biting a piece of Cas’s skin, “I want to sleep next to you… But I should have been on the road like thirty minutes ago.”
Bart chimes in, “Cas, you’re scared of spiders? Want Hannah to kill it?”
Dean grins and nods, closing the book.
Cas laughs, “You drink coffee now, hm?”
The only reason Cas had given him his address and a time was Dean flattered him into submission. Cas couldn’t deny that Dean had also been on his mind since their time together in the back alley. But he would never have been in this situation in the first place if Dean had just kept on trucking and never come back to Cas’s diner.
Castiel pulled away as slowly as he had moved forward, eyes meeting Dean’s as soon as they separated. Dean couldn’t help but smile as he searched those deep eyes, “Can I just say that you’re, like, incredible?”
Dean nods, but doesn’t give any sign of letting go. In fact, he presses his face further into the crook of Cas’s neck. His muffled voice says, “I know. Just… Just a little longer, okay?”
Meg balks before letting out the loudest laugh of the day. Cas hangs his head and covers his face with his hand. Meg can hardly speak through her guffawing, “
being with Dean. The morning Dean headed out, Cas even made coffee for him and kissed him at the door - something that had never happened with their previous meetups.
The light stings as Cas flips the switch in the bathroom across the hall. He runs the faucet cold and splashes the water over his sweaty face. He feels sober, almost pure.
Cas looks behind him to Hannah who is
“Yeah, but,” Dean rubbed at the back of his neck, “Anna mentioned you’re good at helping her out with that stuff. Who knows? You might even be more entertaining than Mrs. Doyle.”
He was simultaneously intrigued, embarrassed, and jealous.
Dean laughs nervously and looks at both of them, “See? Still bad at math - stay in school, go to college.”
Castiel set the glass back down and Jo hollered, “Woo! Yes, Novak, yes!”
Castiel put down his pencil and confronted his sister, “Dean this, Dean that. Are you obsessed with him or something?”
“Mm,” Cas moans in response.
“I’m ready,” Cas says, getting up fully on his knees and away from Dean’s mouth.
“Mmm, it can be,” Castiel replied, still watching Dean’s hand as it pushed and pulled the thread.
Castiel stretched his wrists between periods and tried to be light with them. The pain still was numbly throbbing in his joints, though, and wrestling practice was especially difficult today.
Jo chuckled and punched Dean in the shoulder, “Uh, duh! Hello, you’re the new one in town.”
When their lips finally separated again, Dean immediately had another question, “Was this what you were thinking about out here?”
“Didn’t Dean help you pack up last night?” Raul asked casually.
Castiel’s brow furrowed and his head cocked to the side, “And you turned her down?”
“Yes,” Cas chokes out, “You shouldn’t have thought it was anything more.”
“Will I see you again?” Dean asks, actually sounding concerned.
“Well, um… I was wondering if I could leave early tonight?” Jack’s voice shakes.
Dean closed his eyes too and took the opportunity to kiss Castiel once more before continuing on to the inevitable.
Well, Dean’s fear of hurting Castiel’s feelings eventually overid his need for silence. So he dug his hole a little deeper by commenting: “You, uh, really do give good massages.”
Dean was quiet, and Castiel’s eyes trained on the water beside them. Why did everyone hate him… Perhaps this was some grand joke that Castiel was left out on. Maybe Dean would spread an awful rumor about him on Monday or something.
Dean manages a self deprecating chuckle, daring to inch closer into Cas’s personal space, “What? You don’t like my scruff?”
A small huff came out of Dean; he began to apply the bandage as he replied, “What do you have to be sorry for?”
now!”
“It’s no big deal,” Dean’s shakey response seemed so much closer, even though he was further away. It reminded him of what Dean had said that night under the tree after he’d kissed Castiel.
“What makes you say that?”
“Robin said she saw him at the Cus’s,” Raul said in a hushed voice, “I think she likes him.”
Cas loses his patience, “What are you doing?”
“No.”
Dean laughed and Castiel watched his face. Dean caught his eye and frowned dramatically, “Ash is kind of expecting you to be there.”
Ever since his rough one night with the new Dean, he had been waking from terribly vivid dreams of when Dean broke his heart. The dreams were accompanied by sleepless nights. These nights, Cas would stand at his railing out front of his place. His mind drifted, and Cas felt the most entertaining thoughts were to map the memories of Dean from high school.
Anna shook her head, “I can’t help if other people want to tell me things! They think it’s interesting, and in this case it is.”
Dean found it in him to feed into Ash’s enthusiasm and rally with him, wooting and jumping on the bed. The division allowed for Drex and Castiel - having a much calmer demeanour - to claim a bed together, much to Dean’s relief.
Cas’s heart pounds as he comps a coffee and tears the receipt out. His hand trembles slightly as he takes a pen from his waist apron to write his address and the time “12AM” - underlined - on the back of the receipt.
Dean considered the conversation that had just transpired as clearly as he could through the adrenaline, immediately shoving his face into the mattress and groaning in classic cringing agony. He couldn’t believe what he had said to Castiel, wished he would have put some things a better way or had done something differently.
Cas and Meg turn to her back and see Benny Lafitte stumble up to the bar. He gestures to the bartender, “‘Nother, boss.”
“Wh-what?” Cas is shocked at the question. Dean still hasn’t stopped massaging that part of Cas’s insides. Cas bites back a moan but can’t stop his body from convulsing.
Cas wraps his arms around Dean’s shoulders, not allowing him to pull away. He feels Dean smile against his lips and Cas moves down to nibbling Dean’s jaw. Dean maneuvers the lube between them and the back of Dean’s hand strokes against his thigh.
Typically at this point Cas is just begging for Dean to fuck him already. But right now Cas is being suspiciously silent as Dean slowly works his fingers in and out of him. Well, the man isn’t all quiet, moaning softly, but he doesn’t try to take the reins like he usually does.
"What is it? A foot long?" Dean's eye glanced in the direction of Cas's trunks
Castiel smoothly parked the car on the road and turned the ignition off. Turning to his boyfriend, he stated, "Okay, your appointments are in ten minutes. Get out."
Because Dean was smart, he had thought ahead and brought a book with him to the doctor's office. With his ankles crossed  and a bottle of root beer on the little table with the outdated magazines, he read The House in the Cerulean Sea while he waited for his dad's cardiologist visit to end.
Dean, looking relieved, his perfect green eyes bright, opened his mouth to respond, but Jack burst into the bathroom.
"What about tonight at 6? You busy then?"
Dean stared. "I don't under..." he trailed off when he realized what the strange shape was. Then he thought back to the hat. The mug. Sam saying "ribbit" to him.  "Oh."
After about ten minutes, it was time for a water break. Jack looked up at Gabriel, eyebrows raised.
"Ha!" she shouted, arms raised in triumph.
(See the end of the chapter for
Fred turned his tablet off and shoved it into a pocket on the side of wheelchair. "Wheel away."
Cas took his credit card out of his wallet. "Then you can take care of the bill the next time."
Dean opened one eye to peek at his brother "You ever gonna put that book down?" he asked. "Sammy?" He gave his brother  a small shove.
"Hello, Dean. Sam." Pushing the carriage, he went to stand by them in line, and Dean noticed he was being followed by a black kid wearing a wool hat, focused on a Nintendo Switch,  and a white boy holding two small boxes of Claritin. Cas pointed to each kid. "These are my brothers, Benjamin and Alfie. And my baby sister, Ambriel."
"Yep," Castiel answered. "We already bought the chocolate chip ice cream.  Your favorite. "
The game continued on, and Jack ended up stumbling while moving his right hand from green to blue. He fell onto the mat, catching himself so he wouldn't hit his face. He laughed hard enough for tears to spring to his eyes.
"No, it's private. Go away."
"No, they only care about that baby."
"Mmm. French fries and pancakes" he moaned. "I'm hungry again."
Sam groaned loudly, head tilted back and looking at the ceiling. "God. Fine." He stood and went to the window behind the television, pulling the thin white curtains with the rows of hollyhock flowers on them to the side to stare out the glass. "Damn, it is crazy outs-" he interrupted himself with a gasp. "Holy shit."
She gestured around them. "Where else do I need to be? Come on. I'm interested."
"Babies need a lot of sleep," Sam told him.
Dean had speed walked ahead of his friend and in the darkness was able to spot Jo and Castiel. His sister was sitting in the seat closest to the wall and there were two empty seats between her and Cas. Dean made a beeline for the one next to Jo, and Sam was forced to sit between him and Castiel. Throughout the movie, Dean sat annoyed and bored, but his sister and friend giggled and made comments to one other, each leaning over Dean. There was once, during a shitty jump scare, Dean got surprised and grabbed for the hand on his left, because Castiel was always on the left when they watched movies. Embarrassed when Sam shook him off him, he kept both hands between his knees during the rest of the film.
"But the point is the intent," Cas pointed out. "You meant to do it to James, and not me."
"I absolutely do!" Castiel insisted.
*****
"What are we doing in here?" Dean asked, though he had an idea.
Cas frowned and looked down at his naked body. "I see."
The kids exchanged glances and stood up. They went over to Cas and hugged him. "Sorry, Small Dad," they muttered together.
"What's with you?" he asked.
"Well, Gabriel is very annoying." Cas scratched the back of his head.  "I texted him about you and he advised some inappropriate flirting. Sorry again, about that."
She raised an eyebrow at him. "Do you think they'll do it on the couch? In front of everyone?"
Jo yawned. "Will we starve if we don't catch anything?"
Castiel stilled and thought. "Well. Nothing really. But it would not be very polite after the three of us worked so hard on this meal. And Dean owes me from his hissy fit this morning."
"Listen to Sam, sweetie. We have to take care of Claire and we need quiet."
"How long have you been dating?"
"Jack please," Cas sighed.
"Whoa, wha-what are doing?" Cas hissed. "D-don't take those off!"
More silence.
Cas went to the fridge. "Maybe we can put some fruit on the plate." He pulled out a plastic contianer of blueberries. "How about these?"
"I asked Cas if we could go there," Jack put in. "But he said it would be better to take a plane and he has to wait for the right time to ask Dean. He scared of flying."
"N-o-o-o," he sobbed. "This is where I will die."
Adam hit Cas hard in the right knee. Pain rung throughout his leg and he hid it behind a strained smile.
"Maybe."
"I got her," Sam declared. Jack watched him  lift Claire up and hold her, patting her back and whispering into her ear.
"This is ridiculous," Jo whined, and Dean heard the thump of what he assumed was her hand smacking the mahogany. "It's hopeless. I'll never get it right. Shakespeare should've talked like a goddamn normal person. I mean, The Tempest? Just say storm! A swift kick in the ass is what that lunatic needed. Talk like a human! Maybe I should drop out. What good has school done for anyone? Nothing. It's a waste of time."
There was a tap to his head and Miracle looked over at the smaller human. He had a popcorn piece that had fallen onto the floor in his hand. Miracle happily took it and crunched away. It was his reward for helping his uncle.
Dean straightened up and reached into his pocket. He handed a crumbled piece of computer paper covered in his messy writing off to Cas.
"Oh. Sorry sir," the woman said, hands up. She smiled gently and her kind eyes looked at him softly, reminding Dean of his mother. Her brown hair was cropped into a pixie cut and the beige uniform she wore had a gold star sewn into it and underneath was a metal nameplate that had "Sheriff Mills" engraved on it. "Just trying to get your attention, didn't mean to startle you." She nodded at the Imapla. "That your ca-"
"Carrots and mashed potatoes. Are you eating with us?"
As Dean waited next to the minivan for his dad to open the back he took a look at the place and his surroundings.The chalet was a dark brown, with two floors and a set of stairs leading up to a wraparound porch. He spotted a table with a few chairs surrounding it and the covered hot tub he remembered his mom raving about; it was the only reason she had booked it. There were miles of woods around, and he could see chalets of all different sizes and colors between the trees, some having Hallowen decorations covering their windows and on the grass in front. The closest one was about five feet from them and had three floors. It had a few jack-o-lanterns on the stairs and two ghosts taped to the door.
"I see. I suppose it really is getting serious."
Gabriel, watching his brother clearly struggling to fill the awkward silence, took pity on him.
"Hey, kiddo," Dean greeted happily. "Merry Xmas!"
"Right. TV remote is on the end table. Good night."
"Our dad was kinda weird, almost like he wasn't sure how to deal with us. Like, he'd read to us at night and make us pancakes sometimes, but he never kissed or hugged us." There was a lump starting to form in Gabriel's throat and he tried to swallow it down. "He sent me and Cas off on our own to trick or treat, and on birthdays and, uh, Christmas we'd get shitty toys from a 99 cent store or some candy." He chuckled. "Wasn't very good candy... anyway, when I was about nine, the morning of Christmas Eve, we came downstairs. We never actually had a tree, Dad just threw our gifts on the couch. Our suitcases were on the kitchen table, and he told us to get in the car 'cause we were going on a trip. He drove us to this old couple's house, wished us a happy holiday, and left. Never saw him again." Gabe cleared his throat and wiped away a small tear that he felt running down his face.
Loud thumping music filled Dean's ears. But it wasn't really music, at least not to him. It was just noise. The trip to the club had been his friend Sam's idea and he'd ask Dean and Cas to come because he didn't know anybody else and didn't want to go alone. Dean wasn't really sure why Castiel even agreed to go; he hated going out.
"Okay, well. You never got me a present."
"Be nice," he growled.
"Guess who?" the man's rumbling voice said.
Splashing cold water on his face, Dean stared at himself in the bathroom's mirror. There was a crack in the glass that split his face in two, so he stepped over to the side that was slightly larger and checked his teeth and hair for what felt like the hundredth time.
They ate in a comfortable silence, and when Dean had a bite left of his burger, he heard a crash form the other room. He jumped up, nearly knocking the chair over. Jo was sitting on the couch, giggling. Looking around, he spotted Sam on his knees, trying to turn the knob to Dean's bedroom. He finally got it open and stumbled inside.
Cas cocked his head. "Of course. Why wouldn't I be?"
"Y-yeah. All right." Den stood and demanded Sam take a seat while he went and got the plate with the candle on it. Cas had blown it out and it had to be relit.
Dean's socked feet slid out from under him in his rush to get to the window, and he nearly fell again when he righted hisnelf. When Dean finally got over to Sam, he shoved his brother out of the way, ignoring his noise of protest, and yanked the curtains all the way open, squinting through the blurriness of rain pouring down the glass.
Cas shook his head. "No. They need to learn to behave. Kaia and Patience are younger than you and they don't cause problems." An idea came to Cas then. "How about this; you guys be quiet during today's sermon and we'll have chocolate chip pancakes for lunch."
"Very. Just wait a minute."
Dean had jumped out of bed at 7, giddy and surprisingly wide awake as he turned the alarm on his phone off. He traded the white undershirt and red boxers he'd been wearing for three days for a black tank top and Scooby Doo briefs. Cas hadn't acknowledged him, so engrossed in the heavy novel he'd been reading all night.
Bones started smacking Miracle in the back, and he barked loud which woke up Banshee. She ran up and started scratching at the couch, barking herself.
"If we must."
The two of them spent the next few hours together; racing in the lake, a short hike in the woods, ordering sandwiches and eating them on Dean's bed. Sam had decided to stay in the living room after his swim, which was good for Dean because him and Cas traded quiet and sloppy handjobs on the bed.
"You didn't get his text?"
Castiel ticked a finger for each response. "I'm moving in, I will be living here, got evicted, while you were working, I have a key, Sam told me. Any more questions?"
After everyone ate, the kids all moved to the basement while the adults gathered in the living room to do whatever it was adults at dinner parties do.
Castiel let out long breath, relieved. 'Thank you. Do NOT tell anyone about this. Me freaking out.'
Dean looked up his brother. "Huh?"
"Hey, kiddo," he greeted. "Ya okay?"
Kevin peered at him. "You don't think so?"
"I farted," Jo called out from the back.
Cas shook his head. "It's not... you didn't do anything." He let him go and backed up. "I'm sorry, Dean."
Dean ignored him and pointed at his brother. "What about that one? Why is he here?"
"She ain't even here!"
"You gotta take turns, Jackie boy," the coach responded without turning around. "Like I've been tellin' ya."
"Huh?" Chuck finally looked up from his writing. "Oh. Ri- thanks." Using one hand to continue writing, he used the other to munch away on his cheeseburger.
When Dean came out, Cas nonchalantly nodded at him, and the rollerblader smirked and pushed him flat against the wall. He slid down to his knees and pulled down Castiel's shorts and boxers.
The phone was taken again, this time by John and Mary Winchester, wearing matching Santa hats, and that's how it went for the next couple minutes; someone taking the phone and talking to Cas for a bit before another member of the family took it and did the same. There was an awkward five minutes where Dean's ten year old twins, Ben and Emma, and thier eight year old half-sister, Josephine, got the phone and he had to speak to Dean's ex-girlfriend Lisa and her husband, Matt. By the time Dean was able to get it back, Castiel was sure he had spoken to at least two-thirds of the house's occupants.
“Great!” Anna sat on the floor and started eating while flipping through her book, “Dean, have you looked over chapter ten? You’ve been studying, right?”
The bed is cold. Cas wonders distantly how long Dean’s been gone. That train of thought has Cas sporting a headache in no time.
He tries to smile but quickly loses it once Jack turns away. He reaches for his beer as he lets out a heavy sigh. Cas is staring at him, though. Dean freezes, hoping that Cas didn’t see his mask slip. Dean lays on a smile to make sure and feels somewhat relieved when Cas returns it, but not completely. There’s something they share in their look, like Cas did see… He saw the real Dean, and maybe he didn’t mind.
“It’s seriously inhuman and I, for one, am fucking here for it,” Ash added. He chuckled and pulled another card. His brow raised and he looked around as he slowly flipped around the card, “Queen! Now things get interesting.”
“Something I can help you with, Sheriff?” Benny says slyly. He had caught Jody and Donna’s gaze, and now Dean is turning to them as well.
The particular set of memories Cas is entranced with have him feeling melancholic about the Dean that had shown up to Bootbock a month and a half ago. The contrast between the teenager Dean and the one behind the alley were hard to miss.
Cas bites his lip and slips his hand away from Dean. He fishes around in his back pocket and pulls out his keys. Against Dean’s chest, still pressed against his own, Cas takes his house key off the ring.
“Yeah, I guess,” Dean bites his lip and closes the trunk with a loud thunk. The construction workers aren’t there right now, so a silence settles between the two lone souls - not even the thunder disturbs them.
“Who could that be?” Castiel asked.
Cas bites his lip. He wants to talk about his life even less than Dean wants to discuss his, but he can’t deny the way he feels about Dean has changed. It seems now that Dean can tell too.
Coach Singer made them repeat Dean’s bottom position until he got crowding down. Dean was able to slip above Castiel and lock him down. He pinned Castiel with his stomach to the mat. Coach Singer blew his whistle, “Yes! Great work!”
Cas lets go of his breath and relaxes into Dean a bit. Only a bit, though, not daring to let his guard down.
Castiel was anxious about this last night of training, chalking it up to nerves since tomorrow would be the first day of the state tournament. But he was glad that Raul and Jervis were the first to arrive, as opposed to others…
Castiel’s body was way warmer than before, and he was feeling slightly dizzy, but he was sitting down and it was cold outside so none of that seemed to matter. He shrugged, “Yeah. Should I not be?”
Dean’s teeth dug into his lower lip as his hand slid into his front pocket, fingering the cold metal of busheled keys. His eyes quickly darted to Castiel and the coach again. His heart was racing not because he was afraid anyone would notice (he had done a little too much sleight of hand for how young he was) but what it would mean for Castiel.
“Good job, Dean! Ash, you need to work on reach,” Ash got up high fiving Dean, but seemed a little visibly shaken as he sat back down with the team. Coach Singer turned to Dean, asking, “Glean anything, boy?”
The door closed and Castiel heard Dean’s voice once more. His heart was in his throat, and he kept his eyes on the stove and simmering food.
“Yeah,” Dean smiles back, “Goodnight for real now.”
Cas collapses against the headboard, eyes fluttering close as he tries to gulp in air into his starving lungs.
Cas loses Dean’s touch from his other hip, hearing instead Dean spitting on his hand and stroking his cock against Cas’s ass. Lifting his dick, Cas feels the soft, wet head pressing at his opening as Dean holds one side of his hole open with his thumb. Cas’s body runs electric, nerve endings firing so blindingly.
“Can't have you gettin’ hurt, boy,” he grimaced at Castiel, continuing, “You always make yourself such an easy target, Castiel.”
Dean sighed again, “Look, don’t make it weird, okay?”
She lifts her own, half-sipped shot. They clink, hit the bartop, and throw it back. Meg hisses and whoots, but Cas just starts chasing it with the beer. He doesn’t stop until it’s more than three-quarters gone.
Cas nods shakily, feeling Dean’s skin slip against his. Cas is ready. Dean maintains eye contact as he bites Cas’s lower lip, growling as he boxes Cas’s shoulders in with his arms. Cas grips tightly as Dean thrusts into him faster and harder than they have all night.
“Then let’s go,” Dean nibbles at Cas’s lips.
Cas sneaks out as Bart goes on about his scary spider experience.
Castiel wanted to follow that train of conversation, but Jo was saying to him, “Oh my god, Castiel! If I knew you could hold your own you would have been my drinking partner a
Cas turns around with a flourish to the other trash, not going to feed into Dean’s flirt just as Dean wasn’t playing into Cas’s confrontation.
“Okay. And you’re just fine with that?”
Cas is shocked. He doesn’t want to care about Dean, but he also can’t help but not want Dean to feel sad. But Cas is on the outside of what has happened in Dean’s life, and Dean is content with that. The shock transforms into an urge to be in as much physical contact with Dean as possible. He wants to hold him closer.
Dean nearly spits back out the whiskey he’d just sipped as Bobby goes from zero to a hundred. Dean is convinced the old man is attempting to kill him tonight with all these crazy sensitive topics. He shoots the old man a glare as Bobby chuckles, “Well? Have ya?”
“Hey,” Dean whispered tenderly.
His gaze jumps from the flipped coffee table to the shattered television. The kitchen is a mess. The scene tracks to a quivering Jack in the corner near the closet pantry. Jack’s eyes scoot past a figure to Cas in pleading.
His eyes started to droop closed, asking against Castiel’s lips, “You trust me?”
The class oohed at that. Castiel’s ears burned for his classmate.
Castiel’s movements stilled for a moment before pressing on, replying, “I suppose you’re right… But for a while I believed them…”
“I don’t think Cas has seen this either, y’know,” Bobby suddenly says. Dean looks up at him as he continues, “I remember he didn’t buy a yearbook that year. Or his senior year.”
“Hey.”
Drex gritted his teeth at him, “Sorry, did I wake you?”
Cas tries to look behind him, but can’t see that much. He can feel though, and feels Dean pushing his already undone pants down further so his ass is exposed. Dean pulls at one of his cheeks and sucks in a breath. Cas smiles to himself and gyrates his hips against Dean’s grasp so that the larger buttplug moves a little inside him. Dean hisses, “Goddamn, Cas. You and you’re fucking plugs.”
Dean brow raises his brow, “He’s not?”
“So I heard,” Jody replies coolly.
Cas bites his lip and mutters, “He doesn’t know. Neither of them do.”
Castiel blushed and looked back up at the sky. He didn’t know why that thought made his heart pound, and it scared him. He shook his head, “No, I need to make breakfast in the morning. Nobody knows I’m not there.”
The door cracks open, “Oh, hey.”
“Ugh, stop sucking his dick!”
The guys groaned, but all still chatted excitedly as they took off the warmers to be in their singlet. Castiel methodically put his other clothes in his gym bag, trying to stay in the background.
Dean’s arms tighten around Cas. He takes a deep breath, and presses on, “What I mean is I need you back, Cas. Somehow, any way you’ll have me.”
Dean was exhilarated again knowing that Castiel hadn't gotten off. He unceremoniously reaches down between them and tugged down Castiel’s own loose sweatpants. The boy exclaimed with a gasp that soon melted into a stuttered exhale as Dean took the girth and started stroking him.
“Hey, Cas!” a woman’s voice calls out. They all turn to a woman strutting up with a messy long blonde bob, a soft white complexion and hard clothing style, fire in her black eyes.
Dean starts growing in Cas’s mouth again, and he keeps going. Reaching down, Cas unbuttons his own pants. He pulls himself out and starts stroking himself to the rhythm that he’s sucking Dean’s now almost fully erect cock. Dean, on his part, has stopped struggling and now is pushing into it slowly. He’s leaned back, elbow supporting him against the edge of the counter.
“Good game,” Dean pulled Castiel to his feet.
Castiel didn’t know what Dean was supposed to say either, because he’d never gotten a compliment like that before. Castiel had never considered his looks too much, preoccupied more by clothes than his face or body. There was a despondent bodily dysmorphia there that Dean was unknowingly validating. His words made his bones feel like jello.
“Of course,” Castiel replied, eyes unable to move away from Dean, “It didn’t mean anything.”
“Uh huh,” Coach Singer took the keys back from Castiel, “Be more careful next time, would ya? I’m glad Dean was with you or you might have lost your head too.”
Castiel shook his head, sitting up. He looked down at the ground, picking grass idly as he replied quietly, “I’m just concerned for the team, y’know? What if you leave before we go to State?”
Drifting into a dazed sleep, Castiel resolved that he would get over the fantasy of kissing Dean again. Castiel cherished Dean’s friendship more than anything, and he wasn’t going to jeopardize that over his hormone fueled desire. Still, it also didn’t stop him from drowning himself in the throbbing sensory memory of how Dean’s lips felt against his.
Dean looked up, catching Castiel’s shocked expression and giving him an inquisitive brow.
Dean was quiet for a moment before he continued, “Look, I’m just trying to-”
“Okay,” Dean sat up and got out from under the sheets, desperately crawling to the foot of the bed.
The room was much darker than before, the TV turned off and no lights on. Ash was snoring loudly, and Dean thought he could make out Drex’s face through the dark. He hadn’t even woken up when they’d come in from the party. Dean looked over to his other side, expecting Castiel to be cuddling the wall pillow between them, but no one was there.
“Business?” Cas chuckles in surprise, “Since when have you been interested in business?”
“No. I didn’t even know he was your dad.”
“Woah,” Jack looks off into the distance, “That’s crazy. I’ve never been out of Kansas.”
Castiel, against his better judgement, stopped. But this time he couldn’t turn around and face Dean. He just said to the floor: “What is it?”
“Look, I’ll just-” Dean begins but Cas doesn’t let him continue as he clears the distance between them, roughly pressing his lips against Dean’s. And then he pulls away, the space still so minimal between them, suffocating a surprised gasp he feels coming up by pressing his lips together tightly. Dean does the same, looking at him, dazed.
“Well you’ve done a lot!” Raul pointed out.
tried to contact him…”
Cas drinks more. Dean takes in all that information in waves, but is further in disbelief that Cas just let loose like that. If the circumstances were different, the reaction would have brought a smile to Dean’s face.
Cas stays as still as possible. A beat, and then Jack’s feet begin to move away. Cas still doesn’t dare breathe, and he’s glad that Dean seems to be just as cautious.
A silence fell between Castiel and Dean. Castiel’s eyes stayed put on his plate, although he didn’t have an appetite anymore. He felt weird; this was the first time he and Dean had been alone for a while, and it was also the first time that Dean was in Castiel’s room.
“Oh, okay,” Jack says, biting his lip, then spitting out: “You know, I was thinking about just staying.”
They both start at the same time. Another beat of silence, then Dean is chuckling and Cas allows himself to smile again, “You go first.”
Castiel’s eyes went wide. His lips parted before he breathed out, “What?”
Dean heads over to his duffle bag next to the couch where he stowed his pack. He leans over when he catches the sight of a slumbering Cas, the TV light bouncing over his face. He seems so peaceful and caring right then - like he can actually potentially be something to Dean. But letting himself believe in that… He wonders if it’s even worth it, or if he should just keep smoking.
! Dean’s head reels: Is this what Cas likes now, guys who are barely eighteen? Is he only indulging Dean based on nostalgia? How badly had Dean fucked Cas up in high school?
Castiel instinctually stepped between the eyeline of Lucifer and Dean. Luci raised a brow and turned away, saying to the room, “I need a smoke. Shit better be on a plate by the time I get back.”
“No?” Dean growls, but there is a mischievousness in his tone that sends a shiver down Cas’s back.
“Yeah, what the fuck, man?” Dean added.
Dean swallowed, “Who knows? It’s what I’m expecting.”
Dean’s thumbs are pressed against Cas’s hips as he stoops over further to nibble at Cas’s collarbone. Cas sinks against the countertop, leaning back and submitting.
Rufus’s own words surface to Cas’s mind. Perhaps Dean does deserve an earful, and Cas would really enjoy giving it to him.
“Oh my god, the things you do to me,” Dean whines.
“Oh, Cas, yes!
“Oh…” Dean’s mind races.
He wonders why he’s even doing this; simply completing some bodily release, perhaps. The action feels so despondent, but his hand continues and he moves the other to his jerking cock.
Dean was quiet for a moment, not moving away. Castiel looked back up to catch Dean’s eyes. Dean turned again and, without pulling at his arm, said, “Come on then.”
Dean shook his head, “Nothing
Cas’s expression is so astonished and offended that it’s enough to shut Dean up on its own. He takes a deep breath and feels as if a fraction of his steam has been blown off.
Dean swallowed thickly, mesmerized into silence by the visage of Castiel as he fully pulled off his team hoodie from the back. A blush exploded on Dean’s face as his youthful dick reacted almost immediately and pressed up into Castiel.
Dean slams their bodies back up against the door, pulling away to press his forehead against Cas’s. Cas gasps, eyes on Dean’s swollen, parted lips. But Dean keeps pushing Cas away with his head every time he moves to kiss him.
Jack takes a bite of cereal and answers through the mouthful nonchalantly, “Cas isn’t my dad.”
Castiel merely shrugged.
Castiel peeked up and caught Anna’s eye. She smiled; he smiled back.
As Cas types, a message comes from Dean. Cas sends his text to Jack and goes to view Dean’s message: “
“For that Met guy, maybe,” Dean tries still, “Are you already in a love triangle? Because you can just tell me, I can take it.”
Dean can see lightning nearby, but fails to hear the clatter of thunder over the rumbling engine and gusty rains. That doesn’t matter anyway; Dean uses his engine brakes so he can better turn around the increasingly winding road.

“Original?”
A gunshot echoes loudly, bringing the snarls to an end. The pain focuses and intensifies in a pinpointed spot. The heart’s been hit. The bullet’s still in there, a sharp lump around all the aortas that desperately try to supply blood to gushing wounds.
Cas’s curious hands roam up to Dean’s ass. His warm fingers wander to Dean’s balls, massaging them with his knuckles. Dean is almost doubled over, pulling at Cas’s hair mercilessly as he manages to push out of his lungs: “Cas! I’m gonna- !”
And then Dean’s lips are gone; he holds Cas’s eyes as the pace shifts back to what it once was. Dean’s thrusts are wild and quick as he pumps into Cas. Cas, trapped under Dean, can only riggle his body and accept the thrusts, moaning more loudly by every pummel against his prostate.
“What makes you say that?” Bobby persists.
Dean sighs and looks down at his tumbler, “Yeah, well, you should know I was never good at obeying orders.”
“Damn, Dean, you okay?” Drex's voice asked through a deep haze. Dean ignored him but Drex persisted, “Dean?”
“Likewise,” Met smiles, “Goodnight.”
“Willmaker.”
Castiel’s eyes began to close too, “Okay. But no more running away.”
Although it’s midday, the thick overcast clouds hide the sun well enough to darken the ground as heavy drops consistently pour from the sky. Dean and Ketch burn cigarettes out on the deck of the Men of Delivery truck hub and office, the thick moisture in the air clinging to the lingering smoke. The concrete under their feet is soaked, spotted with black from the wetted ash that’s flicked from their cigarettes. But the two men ignore the elements as they stand in silence.
Castiel needed to brace himself for the rest of the school year. Dean was with Asmod’s gang now, and he was Castiel’s first two periods, and may soon be wrestling too. Really, Castiel was doomed.
Dean smiled, “Good.”
Cas chuckles and easily pulls him back, “No, I just wanted to say thank you.”
” Charlie asks way too bluntly. She was also a person he’d shared his concerns with - really, the only one. Charlie was one of his only friends in the LGBTQ community, so he didn’t spare her many details when it came to Cas.
At this point in time, so young and innocent, Dean had no way of understanding what he was asking of them; they could never hold hands in public, go out on a date, even flirt or openly be attracted to one another. He was asking that they actively hide their affection, guard their actions. Dean couldn’t fathom the scope of his suggestion - and perhaps neither could Castiel - but that had no bearing on their decision. That wouldn’t matter anyway; Dean felt sacrificial as he held a quivering Castiel against him.
Dean and Castiel’s lips met once more, and that was that.
After hearing those words, Dean opens his weary eyes to look at Cas. He could genuinely laugh, “I should be the one thanking you.”
“Hey, kiddo,” she shoots him a smile before turning to Met with something in her look akin to hate, “And would you get the hell out of here, Met? Can’t you tell your existence is bothering, like, everyone?”
Castiel took a deep breath and racked his brain. Everything he thought of sounded lame and weak compared to the previous loaded questions. Instead, he looked around, shrugged, and took a drink. Everybody laughed.
“Oh, oh, dude! Watch this!” Asmod said as Castiel could hear them getting closer, “It’s a daily ritual!”
Dean’s hand from Cas’s hip wraps around one of Cas’s thighs as he rocks in and out of him halfway. Cas’s cock has been trapped between their bodies, freely leaking pre-cum against the rubbing of Dean’s chest.
“Haha, ew,” Meg drinks with him, “So why the long face if you’re getting it so good?”
“Alright,” Castiel replied, taking a card from the pile. He announced: “Two.”
“Hm,” Jack isn’t convinced. But he perks up as he turns his attention back to Dean, “This is a 1967, right?”
Castiel watched from the side as Coach Singer showed Dean where to put his arms and hands as he knelt over Ash. The whistle blew, the match began, but was quickly over as Ash was unable to switch. Dean, to his credit, held tight and was able to maneuver away from Ash’s reach.
they have on in the background and joke about the contestants and Steve Harvey’s mustache. The interaction feels easy to Dean, and he wonders why that is - when the switch flipped for them.
Castiel's heart pounded anxiously, “Oh no, that’s my brother.”
“Y-you kn-know you can’t keep-p up with C-Cas, Raul,” Jervis joked, “H-h-he’s a beast!”
“You made me another sandwich, so we’re all good.”
Dean was somewhat baffled when the owner of the footsteps crept up on him. The person had been a tipsy and teasing Jo. She had been hanging out with Ash and was sent to check on Dean since they’d both been expecting him. He fumbled for a lame excuse that Castiel wasn’t feeling well so Dean stayed after to lock up. He’d even held up the keys to her as evidence and turned to lock the door.
“Ugh, I’m going to be late to class,” Castiel groaned, pushing off the locker. He paused, turned back to Dean, not being able to help adding, “You really are a bad influence.”
“Cas,” Dean’s voice is gentle and sonorous, vibrating Cas’s lips as he says his name against them.
Castiel walked home. He did his homework. He read. He made dinner for the family. He helped Anna with her homework. He laid down on his bed and read some more… He set down his book and stared at the crumbling ceiling above.
Castiel looked up and caught Dean staring. Dean lost his breath but couldn’t look away. Castiel instructed, “Roll back.”
Cas has no idea what he’s doing tonight. At the diner, Cas had wanted to give Dean the harshest tongue lashing of his life. He would declare his deep hatred for Dean, what he really thought of him, and push him away for good.
“Hey! What’s going on!” Ash’s voice called from behind the group.
After a brief silence, Dean breaks eye contact to look down at Cas’s lips. He huffs out disarmingly, “Still don’t get that personal space thing, hm?”
Meg shrugs, “No one would blame ya if you did is alls I’m sayin’.”
Cas can’t answer, doesn’t know how to. All he can do is look deep into Dean’s eyes and moan out pleadingly, “Ah, Dean!”
A water bottle hit the back of Castiel’s head, but he didn’t flinch - he was used to it.
“You don’t know anything, new guy,” Asmod sneered, “Get out of here.”
Cas leans over so he’s on all fours, his hole positioning over Dean’s face. He feels two hands at his ass cheeks, spreading them open. Dean’s tongue quickly follows, feeling the vibration of Dean’s voice moaning as he pushes his tongue into Cas.
was weird - albeit pretty on par for Castiel’s level of strange. Dean huffed away his shock and looked off to his other teammates, throwing his jacket off his torso harshly, “What? Get your freak on by watching other people sleep?”
The strength of both positions combined sends shock waves of pleasure through Cas as he cums over his bedsheets.
Castiel was somewhat curious about how long Dean was taking in the locker room. He sighed and looked up at the windows. The sun had gone down completely, making it impossible to see through the windows past the overhead lights.
His thumb brushes up against Cas’s warm lips, his shallow breath tickling the pad of Dean's finger. Dean decides that tomorrow, after he leaves, that he’ll never return. Never burden Cas or Jack again with Dean’s selfish need to be with them.
“You’re Castiel, right?” Dean continued. Castiel didn’t respond, tying the other shoe. Dean asked, “You don’t talk much, huh?”
Dean’s smile lingered as he watched Castiel get up and walk to the bathroom. He noticed that the TV was still on as he started to clean the cum drying on his abdomen anyway with the towel that had held ice. Castiel returned with a dry towel soon after. Dean thanked Castiel by pulling him closer with the towel to land another kiss. Castiel laughed at that one, pushing him away teasingly as he went over to the window. Dean smiled after him like a lovesick puppy before remembering to properly clean himself up.
“Hey,” Cas blushes, glancing away.
The back of his eyelids are nothing and he sinks into the void. He allows his mind to go blank for a moment before the inevitable clean, shower, and dredging back to the diner.
“We don’t have to explain this game, do we?” Jo asked Castiel as she sat back down.
At the time, Castiel had been pleased to spend some alone time with Dean so he could unwind. But Dean stumbled for the fifth time and Castiel grabbed onto him so he wouldn’t fall off the road. He worried over him and said, “Dean, you should really go back. I know how to get home.”
funny!”
Castiel turned to him and saw Dean looking away, rubbing at his neck, “I was practicing my crowding with Ash…”
“Totally. He says he doesn’t really know you. We’ll all just be hanging, it will be really relaxed. You don’t even have to drink,” Dean continued. Castiel was somewhat shocked. He’d known of  Ash since he’d arrived in Smallville in middle school. Still, it was true that Castiel didn’t really know Ash very well either.
“Cas,” Dean said, looking over to him, “Your turn.”
“Basically,” Cas drinks the rest of his beer and signals for another.
“Check this out,” Al supplied. Castiel heard a paper crumpling and then felt it pelt his back. They laughed again.
“Not yet, boss,” Benny replies. His eyes slide over to Cas, “I’m waiting to meet a friend.”
Cas’s feet find the back of Dean’s calf and thigh as he responds to the contact, pushing down on Dean’s muscles with his toes curling.
Christmas has always been a rough time for the tiny family. Cas had always been resolute to keep the diner afloat, but at times getting by was hard for him. Cas couldn’t always give Jack a good Christmas, but the year had treated them well and this holiday Cas had wanted to give Jack good memories.
“Merry Christmas, Jack,” Cas replies and lifts his phone, “Let me take a picture.”
,” Dean’s voice says softly, “
Despite Ash’s serious snoring issues, Dean felt like he was already drifting back to sleep. But as he began to lull away, he became aware of a distinct lack of presence in the room; specifically from the other side of his bed. He halted his breath for a moment and listened, only being able to hear Ash’s incessant nasal drip and Drex’s steady breathing.
A hand tugged at Dean’s arm and Castiel followed the movement. The arm belonged to Mr. Wyatt, the underclassmen’s English teacher.
“I don’t think they’re going to tell anyone shit.”
Dean gets behind Cas’s ass, but his sore arms come up to cover Cas’s, fingers intertwining with his on the wall and moving them lower. He keeps moving forward so that he straightens Cas up, his chest now the one against Cas’s back. Dean's mouth finds Cas’s ear and nibbles at it as he moves his cock up and down against the length of Cas’s ass teasingly, still holding on to Cas’s splayed hands. The soft skin feels great against Dean’s member, and he whispers deeply against Cas’s ear, “Then we gotta be close. I’m still in bad shape, y’know. I gotta go slow...”
Castiel had given a short lived moan against his lips when the sound of a branch snapping interrupted their bliss. Dean’s sense of hearing heightened, noticing footsteps approaching and kicking some leaves against ground. Cas must have heard it too, because he had frozen in Dean’s arms. They parted breathlessly and Castiel looked more worried than Dean had ever seen him. Dean merely mouthed to the other boy: “Go.”
Dean deflates, nudging his empty glass on the counter, “Then I’ll probably need another one of these.”
Cas looks away from the papers and keys to Dean, eyes on fire, “So is that really why you came? You’re just looking for a place to crash?”
“I heard he punched a cop!” Drex added.
Dean laughs and Cas tenses, not expecting such a glorious noise. He shakes his head and takes another bag, minding his own business.
“Keep your voice down!”
Dean looked back to his hand, noticing he wasn’t trembling any longer. He could easily move his hand down between their bodies and get free, but he hesitated. He peeked over to Castiel’s face, so peaceful in slumber. Taking a deep breath and licking his lips, Dean stared at Castiel through the dark; the image reminded him of the night in the gym.
“Eh, I mean… I’m freaking out a little,” Dean admits, “I don’t think I’ve ever shown up to his place out of the blue like this.”
All eyes shift to Cas, but all Cas sees is Dean looking at him with a shock that Cas feels mirrored on his own face. He is just as surprised he said something as anybody else in the proximity is.
“You?” Jody half smirks, “A friend?”
Dean watched them leave. Castiel didn’t need to see them anymore, so he knelt down and began to search for his tossed backpack that had been ripped off him by Al. He sighed when he found it in a pile of wet leaves, realizing the strap had broken in the struggle as he was brushing it off. A numb surprise came next as a drop of blood dripped onto the dirty fabric. He wiped the blood over his eye as Dean asked from behind him, “You still bleeding?”
Cas’s ass smoothly moves back to follow Dean’s cock, pushing further in. Dean nearly loses his already weakened balance at the feeling of Cas squeezing down around him. Cas moans, “I-I wasn’t ready…”
Dean couldn’t help reacting, “That’s stupid.”
He looked back down to see a charming spread of a smile on Dean’s lips. Castiel’s eyes softened as he got lost in the expression.
Cas rolls over and light penetrates through his eyelids. He grumbles and puts his hand up. He’s determined to go back to sleep, but his alarm on his phone rings mockingly. Cas fights himself and blinks his eyes open. He half expects to see Dean standing over him. But there is no one. He listens for the shower, or some sound around him. There is nothing. His heart sinks slightly.
Cas nods, “Yes, well, maybe you’re right… I have some medicine back at home, could you and Hannah watch over things while I’m gone?”
Dean stares at Cas after the shirt’s fallen to the ground. He smirks, “Thanks.”
Bobby finds Dean’s eyes and stares into them deeply. Dean’s jaw clenches, “I can’t do that.”
Bobby used to be his gym teacher and wrestling coach in Smallville high school, but that’s not where their connection ended. After Dean got back from serving his first tour, he’d gone to his father’s funeral in Kansas and then went on a drinking binge. He had been a transient for a while, hopping from train car to hitch hiking until he found himself back in Smallville. He had wandered the streets, gone to Cas’s old house even. The place was condemned and run down - no one was there, especially not Cas. When he’d gone to drown his sorrows and last ten bucks at the local bar, he’d run back into Jo. She told him about Ash at MIT and Cas at Indiana State University. Dean had run away from the small town and its memories, mindlessly meandering up to Cas’s college. But when he sat on the campus yard, searching from face to face as kids walked to class, Dean didn’t see Cas. If he had been being honest with himself, he didn’t really know what he was looking for anyway.
He nods, understanding that he’s not wanted, that this is all too complicated for the boundaries of their current relationship. Dean begins to step away, “Alright, I get it. I’ll head out then.”
The only brief coupling of the two had come in history class the day before.
“Sonny’s is just right over there,” Dean replied, “I come here all the time.”
“Okay, wow. I don’t think I can help you, man. This is way out of my league,” Drex said as if feeling the detriment of his work as well. Dean sighed with relief, his muscles relaxing at last when Drex’s hands left. Then, he sucked the breath in once more when Drex continued talking behind him, “Cas, why don’t you give it a go? Dean, Cas can fix you up for sure.”
“I’m just sayin’,” Bobby is trying to be gentle, “Maybe this is a sign that you should consider a career change.”
“Hey, do you mind if I switch you Drex with Dean?” Ash asked, out of breath, “Dean’s just, uh, well… I think you’d be a better match for him than me.”
Castiel took a deep breath and met Asmod’s eyes, “What do you want?”
He doesn’t feel upset with his decision, doesn’t regret using Dean, feeling minimal shame for almost getting caught by Jack. He’s just crying; the source is obscure.
Cas forces himself to roll his eyes and suppresses a lustful shiver - he’s trying to pick a fight here. His eyelids flutter and he looks away, hissing sarcastically, “How flattering.” He looks back over at Dean and continues skeptically, “And here I thought you had a career as a truck driver or something. Didn’t know they were so easy going about making detours.”
The boy was sitting on the windowsill, hugging a propped up leg as he looked out into the night. A breeze blew by and Dean watched as the wisps of dark hair got caught in the moonbeams.
Firstly, he is jealous as hell. Cas likes to think that he and Dean’s bond is profound, but what Dean and Benny have is special. Secondly, hearing of Dean’s service had thrown a heavy blanket of guilt over Cas.
“What?” Castiel asked as she pulled him along.
The man’s mouth works before he looks down with a furrowed brow, “Uh, yeah, do you know a good place to stay the night?”
Castiel pretended not to hear Dean’s grunts during these moves. Castiel tried to lose the identity of his opponent when he was wrestling them. Although this let Castiel begin to dissociate from Dean, it didn’t help that the boy was vocal.
Castiel braced himself and started the fight quickly after settling, putting down all his pressure on Dean. Dean tried the break and twist, but he was twisting without the break. Castiel held strong and dug his chin into Dean’s back while he moved his other arm to twist up and around the back of Dean’s neck.
Ash scrambled after them, “Hey, guys! Wait for me!”
Cas doesn’t smile, doesn’t respond. Dean is close now, and Cas takes in his face with deep breaths.
Castiel’s senses came alight, “No… Why would you think that?”
Dean shouldn’t, “Yeah, sure. Thanks.”
Castiel moaned. He felt Castiel’s cock get tauter, and he moved to the side just as Castiel said in one big gust, “Dean. You’re going to make me cum.”
Cas does as Dean says, his arms now around Dean’s neck. He stares into Dean’s eyes, mustering all the loathing he can. Dean seems fueled by the look, his hands scooping the bottom of Cas’s ass and lifting him up.Cas is only a little shorter than Dean, so his legs hang out long and far. His cock bends in a slightly uncomfortable way, but Dean isn’t giving him much of a choice.
Castiel’s open eye fluttered, not knowing how to feel about being in a spot Dean frequented.
Dean takes a sip before replying bluntly, like ripping a bandage off, “I wrecked my rig.”
Dean softly kisses Cas, and Cas quickly succumbs. He hums softly and deepens the exchange, wrapping his arms around Dean’s waist under his flannel. Cas feels Dean’s hand stroke his cheekbone and the other cup his neck.
Dean is getting the idea, grasping at Cas’s body with crazed need as they rut into each other and their lips and tongues work together. Cas bites Dean’s bottom lip; they open their eyes halfway, gaze meeting before Cas is done biting. A small moan escapes Dean and Cas's nerve is steeled.
“Alright, you kids go home. Great work, thanks for coming in. I’ll see you both Monday,” Coach Singer said with a wave.
Castiel blushed, trying to relax, “Oh, yeah sure…”
Dean shrugs, stopping a ways away and leans against the other brick wall again, now fully illuminated. Cas exhales gratefully that Dean is keeping his distance, but he can’t relax.
“Bleh, there’s cum all over here,” Dean chuckles.
“Damn, sorry,” Dean chuckled, “You ready to go?”
Dean puffs his stog and dares to peek up at Peterbilt. In all her glory, the entire image is utterly tragic. The cab is busted from the surface to deep within, the trailer is irreparably torn, and almost every tire needs to be replaced, not to mention the axles... Hell, it’s going to cost him at least $2,500 alone to get his rig towed. Ketch is going to blow his lid. Maybe he’ll lose his contract.
Dean’s face fell into blankness as he looked at Castiel. At that moment, Dean’s eyes were softer than Castiel had ever noticed. Castiel lost the smile and licked subconsciously at his tender lips.
But suddenly Castiel felt fired up; he appreciated people standing up for him, but he didn’t need it. Castiel shrugged, “Well... It’s kind of hard to answer. I don’t know.”
Dean touches one of the bandages on his brow, “Huh, you should see the other guy.”
Cas only has time to turn around and briefly marvel at the sight of Dean pushing past the swinging doors of his kitchen before he’s infiltrating Cas’s space. Dean backs Cas up to a counter, arms on either side of him.
Dean is pretty astonished at the sudden shift in mood. He watches suspiciously as Cas rounds the kitchen counter and gets out two tumblers from the cabinet. Dean swallows thickly around some anxiety and approaches the counter.
Castiel sighed and looked back up at the sky, “Well…”
“What was he like?” Jack seems so curious, Dean can’t help but tell him a little something.
“Dean…”
Dean started laughing so hard Castiel had to look over.
“Damn,” Dean says breathlessly, his thumb coming to life to lightly stroke the piece of Cas’s shoulder he’d been resting on, “That was awesome.”
“Yup, then down to Choo and B Town,” Dean’s voice replies. Cas looks up just to catch Dean’s eye as he sits down next to Benny at the bar.
The weekend rush comes and goes, and Cas has his usual trials and tribulations with Jack and Claire under his wing. But at some point, he begins to rely on Jack a lot like he can rely on Gadreel. Jack makes Cas proud.
Dean faced the darkness of the room, getting his bearings and definitely not stalling. But exhaustion overwhelmed him as he stood in the bathroom’s door frame, so he eventually returned to the bed with a violently snoring Ash. Drex had spread eagle on the half where Dean had been laying, and Dean nudged him impatiently, “Hey, move.”
“Cheers! To one hell of a Halloween pregame!” Jo called.
Dean pushes off the door frame and starts stepping in, saying breathlessly, “Can I come in?”
Cas pushes back, “I want you to cum in me.”
Their laughter quieted as they both looked up at the sky, speckled with stars.
“Don’t move,” Castiel started walking away.
Cas growls and rocks his ass back at equal harshness as Dean had, replying through his teeth, “That’s. All.”
Cas’s movements still, his skin on fire while aghast that Jody may be reading his mind.
“Really?” Jack seems overjoyed.
Cas blushes, “You were?”
” Charlie asks simply.
Castiel sighed and closed his locker, turning to Dean with a cocked brow, “What?”
Castiel and Dean ended with stretches side by side. Again, the exercises went by steadily.
“Yeah, tons, actually,” Dean smiles back, “Hey. Thanks again, Bobby.”
“Yeah, so?”
“No thanks to some people,” Cas nearly growls back.
Castiel’s own laughter subsided and his eyes began to focus. Dean was staring down at him, a weird expression on his face that Castiel had never seen. He looked confused, staring deeply into Castiel’s eyes. Castiel stared back, getting swept away by how green Dean’s eyes could get. Dean’s lips parted as if to say something, but nothing came out.
Castiel stopped. Lifting his head, he realized Dean wasn’t beside him. He had subconsciously picked up the pace and Dean had stopped altogether. Castiel turned around and faced Dean, a few yards away, slightly silhouetted by one of the few street lamps.
Dean rolls his eyes, “Ye bitch.”
On the exhale, the swirly, smelly smoke billows around him and sticks in the humid air. Dean looks around him; there are tall trees, crawling up and along the mountain’s face, but he’s only in a higher, brushed area of it all. Dean inhales the deadly smoke again and feels the gravel under his boots, noticing that where the treeline is there is more dead grass and shrubbery.
Cas shakes his head, “No, I promised him and Claire the night off.”
The wind was knocked out from him, but the fall hadn’t been too harsh. He got up, rubbed at his sore tailbone, and began to walk away from the house. But only a few paces away he whipped back around, his mind reeling.
“Newsflash,” Jo chuckled, taking another card, “It hates you too.”
“Woo!” Asmod called with exhilaration and joy.
Dean quickly pulled back and tried to tame his racing heart. Castiel’s head ducked down and curled against the space between Dean’s arms, nuzzling into his chest.
Cas’s eyes widen as he gestures to a mantle beside Dean. It holds several framed pictures of Cas and Jack: at Disneyland, at the park, laughing, smiling, past and present. There’s a picture of them at the diner and Dean suddenly remembers seeing Jack working there once - hell, he’d even spoken to him! Dean’s head swims as if he’d just found out the sky is green, “Have these always been here?”
Cas sets the mug and saucer next to Dean without looking at him. He moves to the side to top off the two officers’s drinks. Cas notices that, unlike himself (who is trying very hard not to look at Dean), Donna and Jody are all but gawking at him.
And so the days and nights crawl on. Dean makes it to his destination, unloads at holding bays, and reloads his next delivery before heading off. Booze, restless sleeping at any time he can, an obscene amount of caffeine (and maybe some adderall when he can get his hands on it), and his favorite albums on repeat. Load out, load in, hit the road, repeat.
“And it’s kind of cold in here. Get it?” Dean is acting all serious while Cas is trying not to join Jack in laughter. Other people may be looking over at them, but at least now they’re having fun about it.
“Okay,” Dean didn’t know how to feel about Cas seemingly wanting to extend his time with Dean, but he isn’t going to complain. He follows Castiel out, smiling to himself.
Cas looks down instead of rolling his eyes at that question. He moves back a little, Dean’s hand falling away from Cas’s hair, and stands up. He pulls off his own shirt before moving back into Dean’s space. Their cocks slot together as he presses his chest against Dean’s, and Cas tries to handle them both, watching and feeling their cock move together as he breathlessly answers Dean, “I’d thought you’d know the answer to that.”
“I wish you would take better care of yourself,” Castiel’s voice was gentle, yet the noise itself rattled Dean to his core. He had a deeper voice than most boys his age and size, something that had astonished Dean from the very beginning. He’d learned a word the other day, “sonorous” - he figured that described Castiel’s tone pretty well.
“Oh my god,” Cas responds breathlessly.
Hannah shakes her head.
“Okay,” Jack turns to go.
“You two were just fighting about me being his lover and you have a key to the apartment,” Jack explains smoothly and plainly, “I’m not dumb.”
to know why Dean is here, with Benny, and what they mean to one another.
“Is there something I can help you with?” Cas offers with a controlled tone.
“Sorry, I just, uh…” Dean trailed off brokenly.
Donna blushes, “They’re delicious! Would you like one?”
Their breathing is ragged as Dean rides him shallowly, always rubbing up and over that sweet lump that has Cas’s legs buckling and arching his ass. But Dean is holding him up by the hip and by stroking his cock in rhythm.
“Well, what do you think?” Cas had asked hopefully. Jack merely walked around the studio space with a speculative eye. Cas’s hopes melted into fear. He asked, “You don’t like it?”
Dean takes a deep breath, “Yup. Pretty much.”
“Will one of you morons get the goddamn door?! Oh my fucking god!” Luci shouted from the other room.
“Dean,” Cas warns.
Dean is caught off guard by the direct question, “Oh, uh, V-8. Turbo Jet.”
Another pause and then Castiel heard Dean chuckle. Castiel’s eyes snapped back to the boy, a little offended, very confused, wondering what was so funny about what he’d said. Dean shook his head, “Man, you really are like Sammy…”
“Y’think?” Dean chuckled.
“B is good!” Cas tries to reassure Jack.
With Bobby’s blessing and the fire of a challenge alight in his gut, Dean rushes out with a flashlight and tool kit to give the Impala a quick tune up. Pulling back the vehicle’s cover with his good arm makes Dean’s heart flutter. He throws the duffle he hasn’t unpacked in days into the back of the old lass - the only addition to his load is the yearbook Bobby had gifted him - and he roars her to life at the turn of the ignition.
Cas watched some TV with Jack. He tried to keep up with the comments his son was making, but his mind was far away.
“You should take it easy,” Dean advised. Castiel looked over, but laid back down into the grass beside Dean.
“Stop acting like a baby,” Dean hit back, “Can’t we just talk?”
There was a tense silence and Castiel stared at the grass as a slight breeze swept passed them. Castiel felt Dean take his backpack away from him. Castiel looked up to see Dean getting something out of his backpack, “Well, then you have like five minutes, right? I forgot I brought this too.”
hurt Castiel. They were such a mess now - Dean pinned Castiel’s chest and shoulders to the floor - and all Dean wanted to do was fight!
“Don’t worry, Jack,” Cas reassures, “How about we go out of town to a nice lunch this weekend? Little day trip?”
Jack looks up at him, “Cas told you about that, right?”
“Ah, Dean!” Castiel gasped in surprise. He had barely had time to process Dean’s words, much less prepare to feel so exposed.
“Did you get into a fight?” Jack gestures at his face.
He loosely strokes the base of Cas’s cock as his slicked fingers make their way to the entrance of Cas’s hole. Cas’s breath is louder now, Dean knowing how sensitive he is back here. He keeps nibbling at the back of Cas’s neck as he presses the tip of pads of his middle and ring finger into him.
“There’s nothing to say.”
“Do you want some help tonight?” Raul asked.
Coach Singer’s brows raised as a counter, “He’s got some raw talent, don’t you think?”
Asmod’s sneer became a snarl, “I’m gonna kill you, you hear me?”
Dean dared to look over at Castiel above him and gave him a hopeful smirk, “No more massage?”
The memories fueled Dean, and moved to push up into Castiel. Lightning pain ricocheted through Dean’s back. He fell back in jolts of spasming pain, “Ah!”
Castiel tried to turn them both around but he himself stumbled and lost his balance. Dean and him hit the asphalt with a thud. Castiel grunted but felt no pain as he looked over to Dean, who was rolling over on his back and laughing. Castiel laid on his back and started laughing too.
Cas starts to pour their drinks, saying off beat, “I’ve had a pretty ‘shit week’ myself.”
Dean’s eyes are drooping as a point. He hears Cas laugh and it makes him smile.
“Well?” Dean asks, brow raising expectantly, “You going to let me in or you want to give the neighbors a show?”
Dean started chugging and all the others followed suit. Jo put down the beer first. Ash kept going, eyeing Dean from the side. He put down his beer and Ash quickly followed. Castiel was the last, but he found all his beer was gone.
Jack looked around again as he listened. A smile grew on his face and he nodded with surety. The only thought that had put Cas’s nervous heart to rest was that Jack was so genuinely good. He was fully capable of taking on his own space, and Cas was happy to provide that.
“Yeah, well don’t,” Castiel interrupted, closing his locker door with a bang.
Cas forgets to breathe. His mind cascades into the memories of last night, and the previous nights, of the first night in the alley; all the things Dean said rattles in Cas’s head.
Dean’s heavy breathing seemed muffled, like Castiel was hearing him from underwater. Dean was still on top of him, though, with his head beside Castiel’s.
He suddenly flips though, turning abruptly to Dean like a hyper puppy to ask, “We’ll watch them soon though, right?”
“Oh, come on, it’ll be way past their bedtime,” Dean begged, leaning against the other side of Castiel’s locker. Castiel opened the combination and started pulling his books out.
Bobby comes up to the driver door as Dean rolls down the window, yelling over the loud engine, “I didn’t mean
Cas is punched in the stomach by a bolt of lust and Dean angles Cas’s cock up as cum shoots out of him and onto his own shirt. Then Dean is pressing deep inside, breath catching roughly.
At the end of class, Castiel waited, as usual, until all the students had left before he exited.
They came to the back of the house and Castiel pointed up to his window, “I need to get up there.”
Dean rolls his eyes - it was worth a shot.
Cas spins around so quickly in his barstool and fixes Meg with the most shocked, terrified expression that he doesn’t even need to verbally answer. Meg starts laughing and shakes her head, “Oh man, you are in trouble.”
“Uh, yeah,” Dean’s thumb pushes across the tanned white skin on Castiel’s face, admitting, “Like, in the best way possible. Fuckin’ freaky.”
Drex didn’t say anything as Dean stood up and headed to the bathroom. He turned on the light after the door was closed and leaned against the cheap linoleum counter for a moment as his eyes adjusted. Dean didn’t really need to use the restroom, but it was a brief retreat from the situation out there.
Castiel rolled his eyes and hid his smile as he turned to the treeline. He didn’t look at Dean as he nodded, “Alright.”
Cas looks slightly relieved. Dean has a million and one questions, but he pushes those all aside just to see Cas relax. But Cas looks anxious again suddenly, responding, “Thank you...” He looks away as he continues: “I understand I probably owe you an explanation... But everything is just a lot right now and-”
Dean shakes his head and blurts out, “You don’t get it, Bobby. I think… I think he’s seeing someone else. Or possibly married, I don’t know!”
“You are really starting to piss me off, you know that?” Dean whispers.
Cas blushes and feels the fury rage inside him. How dare Dean steal the closure that Cas never got. He never had the opportunity to give Dean one last kiss. And Dean will have that satisfaction if this is truly their last interaction. But that’s up to Cas, and he knows he can’t let that happen.
“You’re not-”
Dean inhaled anger, and exhaled pity. He wondered if Castiel really had never been told how actually insanely amazing he was. But, to be fair, it was a question Dean had asked himself a lot too. Dean hesitated in his response, but dove head first: “I mean, ha, I don’t really understand either.”
“You really want me to go back?” Dean’s voice asked quietly.
“Dean,” the teacher continued after a pause, “Is there anything you’d like to tell us about yourself?”
“Ah,” he observed, “I think I need another.”
Benny turns his look towards Cas, who suddenly becomes aware that he was just standing and listening. Cas turns away and pretends to pick up some work at the window. He sees Hannah eyeing him like he’s a weird-o and he tries not to blush; he knows he’s being suspicious about not being suspicious.
Castiel was tying his shoes on the bench in the boy’s locker room when the door slammed open and the group of boy’s laughter came, already loud and excited.
While the spray hits his face, Cas imagines Dean’s new face. He turns away to go through the motions of a shower.
Castiel looked away, trying to breathe through his panic. If Dean left then everything would go back to the way it was. Maybe Castiel could have dealt with that before, but now that he knew what life was like with Dean in it, he knew he could never go back to being content with his old circumstances.
“...’And sure, if fate some future bard shall join / In sad similitude of griefs to mine, / Condemn'd whole years in absence to deplore, / And image charms he must behold no more; / Such if there be, who loves so long, so well; / Let him our sad, our tender story tell; / The well-sung woes will soothe my pensive ghost; / He best can paint 'em, who shall feel 'em most.’”
“Fuck you!” Jo shouted.
Cas hears Dean’s breath quiver. But Dean presses on, even though it sounds like there is no air left in his lungs, “That doesn’t answer my question.”
Cas stills, jolted by fear as he reels around. His eyes land on Dean, the door closing behind him.
Cas swallows thickly, not wanting to read into the soft tone of Dean’s voice with those last words. And despite Cas’s previous demands, he finds himself quickly drifting to sleep tangled up with Dean, thinking about that grassy clearing near the creek.
Jack shrugs, “He asked for the wifi password.”
Dean’s lips were suddenly against Castiel’s, swallowing the last of his words and the small noise of surprise. At first, Castiel thought it was a mistake (perhaps Dean had tripped forward or something) and so he kept his lips lax. But Dean wasn’t letting up, and Castiel’s care quickly melted away. He let his own eyes slip closed and pressed back against Dean’s lips with his own.
Dean thinks back to the dirty talk while Dean was having sex with Cas last time. No way he ics telling Bobby about
She was John’s while Dean was growing up, and now she’s his. Like the Impala, sitting idly in a dirt lot in Indiana… Dean shudders to think of how many things his dad had owned that Dean takes care of now. He puts that out of his mind - just another thing to lose sleep over - as he brings her into gear.
Dean might as well just steer the car off the road right now and save them all some trouble. It’s not as if he’s very keen on finishing his conversation with Charlie - he knows they can always pick up where they left off later - but he’d been planning on calling Cas once he rolled into town. Now, that isn’t an option. He’s really beating himself up, thinking of what he can do with his newfound circumstances.
Coach looked past Dean to the approaching Castiel with a cocked brow, arms unfurling, “Well that sure was quick.”
Dean staggers to his feet, massaging his temple as blood rushes to his head. He staggers over to the mini fridge and leans heavily on the door as he opens it. He tugs a beer from the plastic ring of a sparse six pack, wiping the top with the hem of his old shirt before cracking it open. He kicks the fridge door shut with his foot as he turns away, taking a swig.
Castiel turned away, “Okay.”
Cas takes a deep breath and looks away. He swallows the rest of his rum and looks down at the ice in the empty tumbler. He shrugs before replying, “I guess I’m wondering why you’re here.”
