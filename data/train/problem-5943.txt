When he finished playing, Steve closed his eyes for a moment before looking up at Tony. Tony was staring at him, his expression completely raw - there was no other word for it. “Wow,” Tony murmured. “That, uh, yeah. That was, uh, really… Yeah.”
He unpinned the sheet from the wall, folding it over his arm with the blanket, and joined Steve at the head of the stairs. They shared a smile, before Steve made his way downstairs, Tony on his heels, and Steve would almost swear he could feel the warmth radiating from Tony as they descended to his floor.
When Clint looked up again, he saw the tender look passing between them and barely suppressed the urge to groan out loud.
“It’s not that bad,” Tony shrugged. “You should’ve seen it after Loki. There is a reason I basically remodelled the whole Tower after the Battle of New York. Had to make it demigod proof, especially if Thor was going to live there.”
Steve cried and cried and cried, feeling as though someone had punched their way through his chest and ripped everything out with clawing fingers. Distantly he was aware of the almost inhuman noises he made as he sobbed, the pain and anger of the past year bubbling up in his throat, until finally he howled, “I want my mom!”
With a groan, Tony flopped back onto the mattress and Steve curled into his side. He smiled when Tony raised his arm automatically to make room for Steve.
Tony grinned, leaning down to brush their lips together. The angle was awkward and put a strain on his back, but Tony decided it was worth it to kiss his boyfriend. His boyfriend who said that he wanted to move in.
“I’m going to get that knife out of there and stitch you up before you know what’s happening,” Tony assured him. “You make a habit of getting stabbed during fights?”
Nefaria’s smile turned brittle, his eyes flickering to Steve. “Perhaps you really are perfect for each other. Too bad you won’t live to find out. I have had fun the past few months, but the fun is over now. I’m done playing with the Avengers, it’s time to move on.”
“Just like you,” Steve whispered, feeling the phantom pain of her hand swatting his shoulder as she scoffed in disbelief. He thought the apartment would be their forever home, but forever ended only a year later.
They made their way downstairs, picking up Natasha and Bruce from their floors, and then the four of them tumbled into the backseat of a waiting car. A short ride later and they climbed out of the car again outside the club. Angie was waiting for them and thanks to Tony’s name, they skipped the line entirely and headed straight inside. Tony waved obligingly to the dude in the line who shouted, “Holy shit, it’s Tony Stark,” and burst out laughing when they heard someone add, “He’s hotter in real life!”
Johnny nodded. “He, uh, he’s in prison. My mom died and he… he didn’t do so good without her. My sister left for college too and…” He shrugged. “Yeah.”
“No, I… I guess I was so focused on getting away with it that I never thought… I own a company,” Steve realised. “Tony, I know nothing about running a business - any business, let alone one this big.”
“I’m glad you like them, Steve. And I’m sorry it dragged that up for you. I just wanted to get you something special.”
“Always,” Tony grinned. “I seem to recall someone saying something about making quiet but passionate love or something? I don’t know who it was but I believe he was ruggedly handsome, effortlessly charming, ridiculously sexy.”
“Besides,” Bruce continued, “I’m pretty sure I should be thanking you. I mean, you did just prove the existence of mers. I could rewrite my thesis. Jeez, I’d love to see the expression on my old advisor’s face. Ross, what an asshole.”
Steve reached into the backseat, grabbing his sketchpad and pencils before fighting to get the car to lock. Rhodey kept telling him that he should buy a new car now that he was a billionaire - literally - but Steve hadn’t quite managed to get round to it. And it was only partly because his head was still spinning at the idea of being a billionaire. He preferred to spend his free time searching out good causes to donate some of his money to, focusing on marine conservation and child abuse because it felt fitting.
“The kind of incident after which he took some time off,” Carol said carefully. “There’s Nat. I better give her the paperwork for that drug company study. See you later.”
Tony hummed, sucking a mark into Steve’s neck as they stumbled into the bedroom. “Missed you too, sweetheart.”
“Do you know you can navigate using the stars?” he said, apropos of nothing. “I mean, humans can’t. Don’t. Not anymore. But it’s one of the first things you learn as a mer. So you can always find your way back home.”
He made his way across the edge of the parking lot, joining Steve on the bench, the cold of the metal leaching through his jeans. He reached out, rubbing Steve’s back, and pressed his lips to his shoulder.
Tony squirmed. He’d never been good with emotions, except for ones involving Steve. And definitely not from his hard-as-nails sergeant.
And when they woke, Tony watched Steve joking easily with MJ and felt a thrill of excitement that one day they would have this for real with a child of their own.
He kicked off the covers, finding his jeans on the floor before retrieving his hoodie from his backpack and pulling it over his head. He shoved on his glasses and checked his hearing aid as he padded barefoot down to the main level of the penthouse, where JARVIS had the elevator waiting for him.
“Seems okay,” she shrugged. “I haven’t had much of a chance to talk to him. He did a good job with that patient he brought in. It was risky but it really paid off. He saved that guy’s life.”
“Wow,” Tony breathed. Ellie reached for him and Tony let her pull his finger into her mouth, never even blinking as she started to chew on it. “Look at you, beautiful,” he murmured. “Talking already.”
“Can we keep her face out of it?” Steve asked. “I know they’ll see her face eventually, but I want to try.”
“You must have hobbies? People do that, right? I don’t know, you could collect stamps or something?”
“Yeah, I heard you the first three times,” Rhodey laughed. “Wow, man, you’re in love. Hearts and rainbows love. That’s pretty big. Do we need to go ring shopping? Can I call dibs on best man? Cause no way am I letting Barnes get in there, I love the dude, but that role is mine. I did not go through four years of MIT looking out for your scrawny ass not to get best man at your wedding.”
“There’s music, we’re moving. It’s dancing,” Tony grinned, shimmying his shoulders and leaning in to suck a mark against Steve’s jaw.
“Yeah?” Tony breathed. “Bet it doesn’t feel nearly as good as this. Being with you, being in you, Jesus fuck, Steve. Best feeling ever.”
Suddenly things began to make sense. It explained why Stane had abandoned Tony after the Starks died; because the company was supposed to be his. Steve didn’t know how, considering Tony shouldn’t even exist, but Howard Stark was a rich and powerful man and he’d made no secret of Tony - just the fact that he had a tail - so Steve suspected that Howard had found a way to leave the company to him.
“You deserve it, baby,” he murmured, kissing his cheek. “You deserve everything. So lucky to have you. Luckiest man in the whole goddamn world. Love you.”
“I’m fine,” Tony insisted with some of his usual heat behind the words. “Seriously, fuck off, Rogers. Go home. Surely you have some kind of a life outside of here.”
“Ooh, yes please. Thank you, darling.” Peggy handed him her empty cup, reaching up to kiss his cheek.
Tony’s grip went lax. He released Steve’s shoulder, then rolled onto his back, leaving Steve feeling bereft of his warmth. Pulling the condom from his dick, Steve sat up just long enough to toss it into the trash, before lying down again and curling into Tony’s side, tucking his head underneath Tony’s chin.
He hung up, but something didn’t sit right. Tony didn’t just not answer. He’d even picked up during a battle, because they only called when it was important. The rest of the time they just texted.
“His aunt doesn’t know he’s gay,” Johnny shrugged. “And she doesn’t like me. Thinks I’m a bad influence.”
Finally the class ended and Steve sank into his chair, burying his head in his hands and feeling immensely grateful that he had a free period. His relief quickly evaporated when the internal phone rang. Steve whined, dragging himself out of his chair and praying that he wasn’t about to be asked to cover another class.
“Is this- I- What- Uh. Maybe you should talk?” Tony chuckled wryly, sweeping his thumb over Steve’s cheek.
“Wow. Wish I’d known this about you before I slept with you,” Bruce muttered, shaking his head. “Look, Steve. That thesis? Purely speculative. I was a dumb kid trying to be edgy and cool. Mermaids - or mers or whatever - do not exist.”
Tony chuckled, sliding his hand onto Steve’s back, hooking his thumb into the waistband of his trousers and splaying his hand over Steve’s ass. Steve’s breath caught and heat pooled in his groin. He wasn’t usually a fan of possessiveness, but he found he didn’t find quite so much when it was Tony.
“Not stupid,” Arnie corrected. “Brave. Be brave, Steve. It’s not just Ellie I want to see loved. I worry about you too, you know.”
Tony left the room, crossing to the nurses’ station. He glanced over his shoulder at Wilson, then frowned. Because the tense, shaking, pain-wracked patient he’d been speaking to was gone. Now, Wilson was lying still, so still he might’ve been asleep, were it not for the way he was poking curiously at the skin around the knife.
Tony returned to the line, ordering another coffee for Coulson and a smoothie for himself. He threw a smile at a couple of kids gazing at him wide-eyed from a table in the corner.
Natasha pulled back a little, keeping her hands on Sharon’s waist and smiled, her eyes sparkling. Sharon’s stomach swooped in a way that had nothing to do with morning sickness. “So. You’re having a baby.”
“What do you mean?” Steve frowned. He’d started tapping his fingers against his thigh, Tony noticed. A rhythmic steady beat, each one roughly a second long.
A ripple of laughter ran through the investors as Lucky trotted up to Steve, wearing a purple vest and with a toy quiver slung over his back.
Closing the email chain, after hitting print so they had a hard copy of everything, Steve turned his attention to the final folder, which seemed to contain PDFs of scanned documents. He scraped out the last of the melting ice cream, holding the spoon between his teeth as he double clicked on the first icon.
ended and a new song began to play. Tony’s mouth curved into a smile as he recognised the song and recalled the last time he heard it. He crossed the room, reaching out for Steve’s hand.
Steve twitched and shivered under his ministrations, burying his face in his arms when his gasps became too loud. Tony smiled to himself, reaching the bottom of his spine and sucking a mark into the skin above Steve’s ass.
“I’ll forgive her. But only because she’s so cute,” Tony smiled, tearing into the gift from Angie. “Thank you for playing postman.” He leaned in to kiss Steve, flipping Bucky and Clint off when they wolf-whistled. “Hey, quick question. Why do you have your guitar?”
“And finally,” Natasha continued, only to be interrupted by the doors opening and a paramedic shouting, “Come on, clear it out guys.”
Taking a deep breath, Steve opened Instagram and began a new post. He glanced at Tony and smiled to himself as he began to type. He’d deliberated over what he should say ever since they first decided it was time to reveal their relationship to the world - it was amazing they’d managed to fly under the radar for so long, and they wanted to come out on their own terms - considering various different ideas before deciding against them all.
artwork in this chapter!!! It has been such a challenge keeping it a secret for so long because I just wanted to shout about it from the rooftops. The full version of the art will be up on my Tumblr soon. Please show Hakko some love - not only did she create such wonderful art, she was amazing to work with. Thank you so much for making Steve and Tony's engagement announcement perfect ❤️
“Tony said you finish early Tuesday and Thursday. This is Thursday. Come on, I’m gonna try and steal Matt for an hour. You’ll love him. He’s an asshole.”
Natasha rolled her eyes. “Alright everyone, meet Dr. Tony Stark, fresh from Afghanistan and the newest member of the night shift. And finally, Dr. Bruce Banner, our new resident. Meeting’s over, enjoy your shift. Stark, get yourself changed.”
“Like Tony Stark, my client was a gifted child. Like Tony Stark, he excelled in mechanics and science and invention. Unlike Tony Stark, he grew up the son of ordinary people. And unlike Tony Stark, he did not make his fortune selling weapons.”
“How ironic,” Stane chuckled. “In trying to protect Tony from me, you reminded me of his existence. Until now, I was perfectly happy to leave him here. Then you came along and reminded me why that was a terrible idea. And why I should’ve killed that fish years ago.”
“They’re putting me on indefinite leave, which everyone knows is what they do until they can find out how to get rid of you,” he explained. “But what if I quit?”
His eyes lingered on Tony’s gills on the right side of his neck and frowned. There was scarring over them, the flesh knotted and twisted where it had healed, and Steve wondered if it affected Tony’s ability to breathe.
. Jarvis thought it sounded like a horror movie, so he bought us tickets.” Tony smiled, chuckling to himself. “I wasn’t exactly thrilled when it turned out to be a Disney movie. But then it started and I… loved it. So part of it is the movie, but part of it’s the memories. That last day with Jarvis before I left home.”
“Oh, that sounds fun,” Tony grinned. “And speaking of, we should probably get going or we are going to miss our flight.”
“Positive,” Steve nodded, but his determination was undermined by the way he leaned forward to steal another kiss.
And kept scrolling, because they went on forever. On and on and on. Steve could feel the knot of anxiety clenching in his gut, but he couldn’t look away. From shaky camera phone footage of Tony’s first battle with Stane in his suit, to clips from an ABC documentary on the Battle of New York, to KTLA 5’s footage of Tony’s mansion being destroyed, the clips just kept coming.
Steve pulled out his phone, snapping a picture of the famous pool and sending it to Bucky with the caption
“We got this,” Clint insisted, grabbing a length of cable and pressing his back to the wall beside the door.
“That’s not necessary,” Steve muttered to himself. “He’s not going to do anything to you. Why can’t you just let him go?”
Bucky whined. “I’m not going to have sex with my super hot boyfriend for five months, Stevie. I don’t know if I’m going to survive.”
Evie Rose raced into Steve’s bedroom, returning moments later with a hardback book clutched in her hands, thrusting it towards Tony. The dust cover was faded and the edges torn; Tony suspected this belonged to Steve when he was Evie Rose’s age.
“I like you,” Steve grinned, while mentally trying to figure out if he could adopt someone who was only a few years younger than him.
Tony glanced at him and for a second, Steve felt a moment of companionship pass between them. Then it broke as Tony started coughing, his breath wheezing loudly.
“Easy,” Steve replied, and he didn’t even sound out of breath, the bastard. “My husband’s been deployed for over five months now. And that is a
“I think it’s an easy option for them,” he replied, his voice tight. “Blame the victim, throw her on a cocktail of meds and forget about her. Just like the Army did. But none of the meds do anything to help her. So then they decided I should have her committed. I had to fight her sister to stop her from putting Jess in an institution. I know her. I’ve known her for years. I am not giving up on her. I know something’s wrong.”
Since his mouth was still full of toothpaste, Tony simply reached up, scratching his nails lightly against the back of Steve’s neck.
Tony hung back, staying close just in case, while Steve stripped off his pyjama bottoms and boxers, easing himself into the clean clothes.
Steve turned back to the stars, barely visible above them through the light pollution. The weight on his chest was heavy, but - despite Tony’s claims that they were not friends - it was a little lighter with Tony by his side. Logically, Steve knew he should head home, but he couldn’t bring himself to move, not yet.
As Tony began to snap his hips forward, Steve trailed his fingers over Tony’s shoulders, into the dips and curves of Tony’s chest, skimming the edge of the arc reactor before running them down his arms. Tony shivered. Fire pooled in his stomach, and he picked up his pace.
“I haven’t puked since last night,” Steve retorted, before tapping his fingers against the wooden bookshelf.
They followed Thor to the staircase entrance. Bucky was the only one able to keep up with Thor, although Matt came a close second. All that parkouring across rooftops had given him a dexterity Tony eyed enviously.
Steve dragged his backpack over to his side, searching for the hand towel he always carried in case of emergencies, then realised it was going to do very little to help considering how wet he was. He peeled his t-shirt off, sitting up to squeeze the water out of it before dropping it onto the tiled floor and letting his head hang.
She took a deep breath then ground out, “I… need your advice. How long were you and Steve together before you proposed?”
Sure enough, three days later his phone rang again, Unknown Number on the screen and as much as he wanted to ignore it, Steve knew his father wouldn’t leave a voicemail if he didn’t pick up.
Steve pressed his hands against his hips, trying not to look too guilty. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the progress bar inching towards full.
The water stung his eyes, but Steve forced them open, letting Tony drag him down towards the overhang at the back of the pool. It was a poor approximation of a cave, clearly a half-hearted attempt to make Tony feel at home - if mers even lived in caves in the first place. Pressure built in Steve’s ears as they sank down.
Instead of answering, Steve swung a leg over Tony’s hips, settling himself in his lap and leaning down to kiss him slowly. Tony’s hands gripped his hips, and Steve felt himself relax the longer they made out on the couch.
“Alexander,” Steve breathed, staring in disbelief at the man who stood in front of him, smiling congenially. He looked the same; a little older, a little more lined, but otherwise unchanged.
“I don’t think you want to play that game, Alexander,” Steve warned. “I never reported you for locking me in that closet out of some kind of misguided loyalty because of what we had. But that is long gone and if you go after Tony, I won’t hold back.”
He slipped out of his chair, sitting on the floor by Arnie’s feet and running his hand over Ellie’s back. Her face lit up when she saw him, reaching for Steve with one hand. He pressed a soft kiss to her palm, breathing in her scent.
“Um… Please don’t mention, uh, please don’t tell my aunt that, that Johnny’s my boyfriend,” Peter stammered. “She, uh, I haven’t, um…”
She rolled her eyes dramatically, but nodded. Both she and Tony watched Steve head towards the restrooms then, once the door closed behind him, Evie Rose folded her hands on the table, her face taking on an expression of the utmost seriousness, which was comical to see on a six year old.
“That’s a good talk,” Tony grinned and Steve felt himself smile back. “To, um. To steal your earlier question. Why?”
“I’m gonna…” Steve pulled back, picking up the box and carefully removing the watch and wrapping the smooth brown leather around his wrist. He stared at the watch in wonder for a moment, before turning to Tony and swinging his leg across, sitting down in Tony’s lap. “I love it,” he repeated, linking his fingers behind Tony’s neck.
Steve’s hands trembled as he reached for Lucky. The dog was curled up on the sofa of the den next to him and looked as miserable as Steve felt.
“I thought, now that Johnny’s injuries have been treated,” Sharon explained, “These two could use the opportunity to see each other. And also, I have some news. Johnny, Dr. Stark told me that you were avoiding a red Buick on the wrong side of the road when your bike crashed, is that right?”
Tony snorted, but he didn’t say anything else, much to Steve’s relief. Finally, he managed to attach the net, smiling triumphantly.
“He’s never been to Chuck-E-Cheese,” Clint called. “That’s a crime. Everyone should have a birthday at Chuck-E-Cheese once in their life.”
He’d hated it ever since Tony crashed it and Steve thought he was going to be a widower before his first wedding anniversary. Tony liked to tease him about it because in the early days of their relationship, Steve thought the fact that Tony rode a motorbike was really fucking hot. Especially since he’d always wanted a motorbike as a teenager, but Abraham refused point blank to let him climb on “one of those deathtraps,” as he’d called them.
“I’m not just a dumb carny, you know,” Clint snapped, wheeling around and looking Tony in the eye for the first time.
Steve swallowed the lump that appeared in his throat at the sight of Tony and Ellie together. They looked nothing alike - Steve and Arnie were both fair so Ellie had inherited their blonde hair and she had Steve’s blue eyes - but the way they gravitated together was exactly like father and daughter, and it was a wrench to Steve’s heart every time he saw it.
“You can. You do. But you don’t call me sugar bear when you want to chat. Sugar bear is Tony-code for
Hannah started wriggling in his arms, reaching towards the ground. Tony crouched down, setting her on her feet and watching as she waddled off towards a box of toys which she began rummaging through.
“You’re the best,” Steve told her, passing a cookie to Tony before shoving the other in his mouth whole. “These cookies are still amazing,” he mumbled around the biscuit.
His voice trembled and his eyes shone, a wet sheen covering them, and a burst of protectiveness burst in Steve’s chest. He stepped forward, ignoring the threat of the knife and held Tony’s gaze steady. “Over my dead body,” he promised slowly.
Steve let go of Tony’s hand - reluctantly - as they entered the communal kitchen, already reaching for his daughter as soon as he saw her sitting on Clint’s lap.
“Are you done here, darling?” Frigga asked, laying her hand on Loki’s arm. “I think I’d like to go home now.”
“I’m right here,” Sharon assured her and Natasha allowed herself another minute of talking to her girlfriend before she went back to work.
“Alright, here’s what you do: you let that fill up,” he explained, pointing to the bag already filling with blood. “When it’s full, you pump it back into him. Then you put a new bag here and it keeps going, like a bucket brigade at a fire, okay? Okay?”
“Hey Cap,” Clint called, jumping over a pile of rubble by the service door. “Wanna hear something weird?”
Tony slowed his pace, dropping back from hard thrusts to moving his hips in small circles, chuckling at Steve’s pout.
But considering that out of the four other occupants of the apartment, three of them were small children, he thought he had a right to panic.
As he came back to himself, Tony became aware of Steve pressing tiny kisses along his temple, a hand running soothingly through his hair. Tony caught Steve’s hand, pressing a kiss to the centre of his palm. He pulled out slowly, then finally allowed his muscles to give out, collapsing onto the bed beside Steve.
Steve chuckled and eased himself down into the chair next to Tony, settling Ellie on his lap before risking a glance at the rest of the team. There was some surprise but no horror or disgust in their expressions, so he counted that as a win.
Steve sat up so he was looking Tony in the eye. “For everything,” he replied, before leaning in and kissing him slowly.
When they finally broke apart, Steve rested his forehead against Tony’s, trying to catch his breath and calm the fuck down.
“Yes, I did. Because despite it being my second language, I apparently know English better than you do.”
However, this left the door cleared for a third thug to barrel towards Tony. Tony deflected his blows - sloppy and obvious, Happy would be so disappointed except wait, this was someone trying to inflict serious harm on Tony so maybe Happy wouldn’t be too disappointed - and flipped him onto the ground. The goon groaned pitifully.
Steve shook his head, rolling his eyes, but he was still smiling and looking at Stark fondly and Scott was starting to wonder if maybe he’d walked into the twilight zone or the upside down instead.
“He’s it,” Tony shrugged. “For me. Steve’s it. There’s never going to be anyone else, because I don’t want anyone else.”
Then his eyes fell on his guitar, still sitting on the sofa where he left it when he went to meet Tony and Bucky, notebook and pencil abandoned on the table.
Tony chuckled; the noise low and throaty and going straight to Steve’s dick. “That would’ve made one hell of a first impression on my first night.”
“If there’s donuts,” Tony smiled. “I’m sorry, honey, but if there are donuts, you’re taking the backseat.”
Steve lay back. He picked up Tony’s hand, caressing his fingers gently before pressing a kiss to the centre of his palm. “Are you okay now?”
“Can’t believe you dated that guy,” Clint shook his head, letting it go for now. Steve resumed typing, his shoulders relaxing. “He’s just so old.”
Before Steve could call him out on it, Bucky levelled Tony with a glare and said, “Bullshit. Wanna try that again?”
“Michael would’ve loved you,” he murmured. “He was so good with pups.” He looked up. “What about you? Do you have anyone in the future?”
“I managed to get a locum for two weeks until her replacement gets here. I think you know him actually. He mentioned working with you.”
Tony froze, his eyes sweeping over the girl and mentally trying to figure out if she looked older than thirteen or not. “Uh huh… And, uh, what does that have to do with me?”
EDIT: Look at the amazing artwork of the kiss by Charlie! How incredible is that?? Huge thank you to pensivegrace and
“Yeah, but I already pulled that trick on them before so they went a little, uh, overboard on the knots this time,” Clint sighed.
The fake shutter sound echoed, cutting off Stane’s tirade and instantly drawing his attention to Steve.
And with Steve’s permission, Tony began to move again, his hips jerking frantically as he fucked into Steve again and again, his pace speeding up, faster and faster, until his vision whited, his blood buzzed in his ears, and he was coming, barely holding himself up on shaky arms.
“I’m guessing going big involves a press conference?” Steve said, shovelling a handful of peas onto a plastic plate for Ellie to play with.
“Did you go nuts at the market or something?” Tony frowned as Steve unloaded the boxes of fish and fruit.
To this day, Steve only did laundry when he literally had no clothes left and either couldn’t be bothered or couldn’t afford to buy new ones, the small areas of his bedroom carpet that were visible were so dusty they were a different colour from the day he moved in, there were
For a moment, there was silence, the only noise coming from their attempts to catch their breath. Then Tony mumbled, “Happy halloween,” and Steve began to giggle until they were both shaking from laughter.
Then Tony leaned in, and Steve’s eyes fell shut as their lips touched. Steve’s hands pawed at Tony’s chest, until he managed to catch the collar of his t-shirt with one, the other fisting at his waist and tugging him closer. The kiss was gentle and relatively chaste; at least it was, until Steve managed to catch Tony’s lower lip, sucking on it gently.
“Hey! We don’t bite the doctors who are trying to help us around here,” Dr. Pym frowned. “Push five of Haldol, IV,” she added over the screaming. “Bruce, you with me?”
Steve shivered, clutching at Tony's shoulders, letting his nails bite into the skin. “Oh, fuck. Yeah. Oh, fuck, that’s so good, baby.”
“Hi,” he smiled at the kid behind the desk. “Captain Tony Stark. I’m looking for a friend of mine, trying to track him down. Can you check what details you have on him?”
Then the faceplate snapped back into place and Tony took off in a streak of red and gold, chasing the Quinjet. Steve folded his arms on the railing, watching until the suit and jet became two dots on the horizon. He rolled the stem of the sunflower between his fingers, dropping his head to smell the flower. Steve stood there, staring out over the city with a smile, until the sun began to set and the sky was streaked with orange and red.
They listened to the judge’s speech, relieved to hear him say that he wanted deportation to be an option, and that he would be discussing it with the Italian authorities. Then they stood again for the judge’s exit before making their way out of the courtroom.
“He’s so much better than you,” she laughed. “Because he’s not afraid. You saw what you could be and you ran scared. He saw, and he decided to become what you should have been.”
“We’re good,” Tony replied. “Press attention’s a bit much at times. Don’t suppose you can do anything about that?”
He stood up and marched away but before he could get far, a hand grabbed his wrist and yanked him into an alley.
“I won’t keep you long,” Steve interrupted. He handed over the envelope. “I’m tendering my resignation, effective immediately.”
“Fine. T-shirt, tight, maybe white, but not the ones you wear to go clubbing. Jeans, the good ones from H&M, that make your ass look good. If you wanna wear a jacket, wear that blue one you got when we went to Boston, but make sure you take it off when you get there, because your forearms are to die for.”
Foggy tapped Tony’s elbow and handed over his phone. Tony frowned, until he read the message on the screen:
Crawling out of the tree house, Steve set off up the garden again. When he entered the house, Tony looked up in surprise. Steve ignored his wide-eyed stare, crossing to his backpack and rummaging inside until he found the hand towel he’d stuck in there just in case.
“I mean, I’m not an architect, but it works as a concept,” Steve shrugged. “We’d just need to find the right place on the coast to build it.”
“First time in twenty one years,” Bucky recalled with a proud grin, as though he was the one to score the winning run. Then his face fell into a scowl. “Then they lost the World Series to the
“I’d agree with that,” Natasha nodded, thinking of Sharon as she noted Hogan’s still high blood pressure on his chart.
“Just a bum,” Tony replied, his hand rubbing Steve’s back through his sodden shirt. “I scared him off.”
Once Steve was in bed, Tony returned to the kitchen to refill his water glass. To his surprise, Angie stuck her head out of her bedroom.
“We should probably go get her. Before he has her wearing exclusively the most hideous shades of purple he can find.”
“You could do better,” Hammer told Steve. Turning back to Stark, he continued, “You know he’s married, right?”
When he came back to himself, he gulped for air, dragging the oxygen into his starving lungs. Blinking, Steve found Tony kneeling between his legs, watching Steve with a smile that was somehow hungry and proud all at once. Incapable of words, Steve crooked a finger, beckoning Tony closer.
“Uh, I’m sure we can get a car seat here within the hour,” Tony said, clearing his throat. “JARVIS, order the one with the best safety rating. Ignore the price.”
Steve frowned, tilting his head as he studied Dr. Banner. There was something vaguely familiar about him, but Steve brushed it off. Where on earth would he have met a marine biologist?
I would love some artwork of the various photos mentioned in this chapter, so if anyone's interested, let me know.
“You need a new tailor,” Tony informed him. “And by new, I mean a tailor, any tailor, because that amount of polyester is making my-”
(If anyone asked, Tony would deny the high-pitched squeak he made at the sight of the adorable, wriggly little ginger beans.)
“You take the bathroom first,” Tony said, nipping Steve’s ear. “Quiet, remember?” he said when Steve raised an eyebrow.
“I’m glad to hear that,” Natasha replied. She glanced between Frigga and Bruce with something almost like amusement on her face. “How are you feeling?”
“If you cared, why’d you run away like a little baby? Did dealing with the druggie vet hurt your delicate sensibilities?” he pouted.
Once he finished setting Warren's arm, Steve left the exam room and slipped down the corridor. Pulling his phone out of his scrub top pocket, Steve scrolled through his contacts until he found Tony’s name and hit call.
The chances of someone managing to bypass the security systems and JARVIS and making it all the way to the lab unnoticed were very slim and from the slightly manic and definitely terrified look on this guy’s face, Tony doubted he was in any danger.
Steve exhaled, puffing out his cheeks. He was way too tired and his head was too stuffy for this conversation, but he’d opened his big mouth so now he had to deal with it.
Only Stane had turned up with a document claiming that Tony had made him his representative, complete with fake signature from Tony and witnessed by an obviously crooked lawyer. The document gave Stane carte blanche to run the company however he saw fit - and freedom to blame Tony for anything that went wrong. That discovery sent Sharon on a twenty minute rant against Stane, and Steve decided he was a little bit in love with her after that. He’d told her that she should consider a career change to the FBI or the CIA and she’d replied, “I just might!”
Steve managed a smile, bending to pick up the net again. Nothing had changed, not really, and everything still felt insurmountable, but he could breathe. He stuck the net into the water, running it along a few feet then lifting it clear of the water to dump the debris and weeds out of the net. To his surprise, Tony popped up beside him, and in his hands were two water-filled plastic bottles from the bottom of the pool.
But then something smacked him on the head and Tony had one last thought before falling unconscious.
And Steve felt a flutter of something, something that he hadn’t felt in a long time since he met Peggy, but he quickly quashed it down.
He used the time to shower - being used as a pillow by his sweaty, feverish boyfriend left him with a desperate need to feel clean again - before making breakfast for himself and Angie.
“When we’ll have two helpers looking to earn pocket money to do it for us,” Daniel grinned, kissing Peggy’s neck.
When Tony woke, he discovered that it was late morning, giving him some indication of what time they’d arrived back. He rolled onto his back with a yawn, his nose wrinkling when he realised he’d fallen asleep in the clothes he’d been wearing under the suit for three days.
“Not if that helps or makes it worse,” Bucky admitted. “Anyway. I’m going home. Stark, take your husband home.”
He wasn’t the flowery speech kind of guy, not when it came to talking about his relationships publicly. Tony knew how he felt, that was all that mattered.
Giving Steve’s cock one final squeeze, Tony dropped to his knees by the edge of the bed. Steve lifted his head, his stomach muscles curling as he sought Tony out, before falling down again with a sharp inhale when Tony began mouthing Steve’s cock through his pyjama pants.
He sent over his number, figuring with Tony’s concerns about security that he wouldn’t want to put his own number out there like that. A moment later, his phone buzzed with a new message on StarkChat from an unknown number. Steve opened the message and laughed.
But it was the final room, innocuous from the outside with its simple wooden door, which left the biggest impression on Steve. The door was stiff, swollen in its frame, and needed his whole weight to coax it open. When it finally swung open, Steve’s jaw dropped, taking in the mahogany panelled wooden grotto, which looked like something out of an old sailing ship.
Steve stepped aside, let Tony step into the room and closed the door behind them. Tony watched his every move with hunger in his eyes, causing warmth to spread through Steve. His pulse jumped.
“You sure?” Steve asked, slipping an arm around Tony’s waist and kissing the top of his head when Tony all but sagged against him.
When Steve woke, he quickly became aware of two things. First, that he was awake before his alarm for the first time in maybe ever.
“Sir,” JARVIS interrupted. “There is a call from SHIELD incoming. Apparently there are fish people attacking Atlantic City.”
“That’s just because you want ice-cream,” Zoey sniffed, climbing into the chair on Tony’s other side.
“All I’m asking is that you keep your relationship out of the press as much as possible. For the school’s sake.”
“So, the way you were talking earlier, it seems like he’s not really involved, then, hmm? Tony, I mean?” Steve asked casually.
“You know,” Tony said, folding his arms on Steve’s chest, “I had this whole thing planned out. I was gonna take you home, make you dinner, give you a bath, seduction; the whole nine yards. Until
Tony quickly locked his phone, intending to pocket it again, but he forgot he was sharing a table with Captain America. Bucky swiped his phone and unlocked it.
“It’s not embarrassing,” Tony replied, tucking one leg underneath himself. “It’s just… Alright. This movie came out the year I went to MIT. At fifteen. The week before I was due to leave, Jarvis took me to the movies. We were supposed to see
Steve flipped him off as he let himself out of the house, but he was smiling as he made his way down the garden.
“A donkey?” Tony echoed, his lips twitching. “Hmm, what do you think Steve, am I stronger than a donkey?”
Catching Tony’s face in his hands, Steve drew him in, only the stop, their lips scant millimetres from each other. Tony could feel the heat from Steve’s mouth, could feel his breath against his own lips. When his tongue flicked out to wet his lips, he hit Steve’s too, causing his breath to hitch.
“Alright, I better go play nice with the paparazzi and make a statement,” Bucky sighed. “Unless you want to…?”
“You’re a carny and a thief; you’d fit right in,” Tony replied. “Where did you get money? I mean, you bought a building. This building. I mean, it’s not much,” he added, glancing around, “But real estate in Brooklyn isn’t cheap. And being an Avenger doesn’t exactly pay. Believe me, I know.”
Steve groaned again, then let his arms drop onto the mattress. He allowed himself one, two, three seconds then sat up slowly, letting his head hang and hoping the world would stop spinning soon.
“He’d do that for anyone,” Steve replied, the words tasting like ash because it was true. Tony would do that for anyone. That was the worst part.
Natasha laughed and drew her into her arms. “So. Can we try and make decisions together from now on?”
“Now, I’m sure you’re all disappointed that the Avengers couldn’t be here today. But I think we can all agree that these kids are the real heroes,” Steve said, in a tone that implied they damn well better think of them as heroes. “You’re probably tired of hearing me talk, so go, talk to these kids. And find out more about how you can help Stark Industries change their lives. Thank you for your time.”
“Amora kicked our asses, so we kicked her ass, we sent her back to Asgard, and Thor’s taste in women will forever be under question,” Bucky declared. “Anything else? Nope? Debrief over.”
“That’s definitely not turning anything off,” Steve retorted, catching Tony’s hand and clutching it to his chest. “If that does anything, it turns things on.”
Tony smiled to himself, warmed more by the fact Steve knew he was bored from his messages than by the coffee in his mug. He slouched in his chair, grinning when Steve’s reply came though.
“Liar,” Tony grinned. He took Steve’s hand and turned them towards the elevator “So, how was your morning? Bet it wasn’t as painful as mine,” he added, rubbing the back of his neck.
Steve glanced around, before grinning as he leaned forward. “Yeah. I did. And I also saw the guy with him. How big do you think the age difference is?”
At the bottom of the stairs, they found a door usually held closed by a heavy lock. But whoever traversed the corridor last had neglected to lock the door behind them. Or perhaps they’d simply decided they didn’t need it anymore.
Steve unlocked his phone, bringing up the app with shaking hands. The bright red one hovered over the chat icon, drawing him in.
Tony nuzzled his cheek, setting off a flurry of butterflies in Steve’s gut. He curled his hand around Tony’s neck, dropping his nose to scent his once more, eliciting a pleased hum from Tony.
“Yes please,” Tony replied, tilting his head back to receive Steve’s kiss. Steve couldn’t resist turning one kiss into two. “Love you.”
Tony shook his head. “Statistically, most technology doesn’t have a great relationship with being underwater.”
He rapped his knuckles against the office of the CT tech, sticking his head into the room without waiting for an answer.
Steve woke slowly, the world blurring before his eyes. He squinted, and realised his eyes weren’t focusing which meant he’d lost his contacts. He remembered dancing with Tony and then he remembered the roar of fire, then everything was blank. He blinked, trying in vain to convince his eyes to focus. Shifting in his seat, he jerked back again, the handcuffs around his wrist rattling against the chair legs.
Natasha glanced up from her phone, her lips curving into an unbidden smile at the sight of her girlfriend approaching. “Hey you.”
They snuck along the deck, keeping to the shadows where possible, and ducking out of sight whenever any crew members approached, until finally they made it to the bow, darting up the steps and into the wheelhouse where they came to a stop, face to face with Nefaria and two goons.
“Nerding out with Rhodey in the workshop,” Tony explained. “Everyone forgets Rhodey’s an actual rocket scientist. It’s good to hang out, and build stuff, and pretend we’re still at MIT together.”
“I went last time,” Tony’s voice called from within the jet. Steve’s heart jumped. Then he heard footsteps approaching and Tony appeared. His face lit up when he saw Steve. “Hey, you.”
Steve was too tired to deal with this. He wanted to go back to the apartment and curl up in his blanket nest and just… ignore the world and its grumpy assholes who threw knives at people and stabbed you in the leg. But even more than that, he wanted to go home.
“Maxwell House instant,” Tony grinned. “But after that week, it was the best thing I’d ever tasted. It was also the only thing fit for consumption in our apartment.”
“Clint,” he began. “Wow, hey, what are you doing?” he exclaimed, spotting the wire cutters in Clint’s hands.
At least, they looked like gills. But that was impossible, right? Because humans did not have gills.
Evie Rose grinned up at Steve, before gleefully announcing, “Yes! Mom says he’s not safe to be let out on his own.”
“In that case, I’ll settle for whatever you’re making. I’m sure it smells wonderful. I’ll have to take your word for it, but I believe you.”
“I don’t know. Jess was spiralling all afternoon,” he explained. “And then, I think, this guy put his hand on her - she was shouting, clearly agitated - and she snapped. She slapped him and he hit her back. She fell down and she, I don’t know, she cut herself on something. I think she thought he was trying to kill her.” Matt’s face fell, pursing his lips. “I wish I could’ve helped her.”
Tony threw Steve a smile over his shoulders as Evie Rose dragged him into the middle of the room. Steve smiled, watching them with what he knew must be a dopey expression, but there was just something about Tony with kids which made his heart turn to goop. Leaning against the wall, Steve watched Tony and Evie Rose, until the feeling of being watched began to creep up his neck. Glancing around the room, Steve found a pumpkin head staring at him.
with Peggy and Daniel, Steve knew, was that they’d both known him for so long, they knew all his worst behaviour and were unrepentant about using it to their advantage. Peggy certainly had no qualms about using a lifetime of friendship to target Steve, however he wasn’t afraid to give as good as he got.
He released the drunk, pushing him towards Happy from security, who was waiting and instantly took the drunk by the shoulder, escorting him into the waiting room.
“Guess they noticed,” he continued, angrily swiping away a few stray tears. “Because then… Then one day there was this thing, this machine. And I’d never seen anything like it. And it was just sitting there.”
Steve accepted Rhodey and Sharon’s invite to dinner but he let them carry the conversation. He knew he should participate or tell them that technically he was their new boss, but reality was sinking in and he’d realised that he would never see Tony again.
. Any chance you can do something about that, doc? Do people actually call you doc, or is that something that only happens on TV?”
L&L Diner was a twenty minute subway ride away in Williamsburg, but worth it in Steve’s opinion. He stumbled upon it back when he was dating Daniel, and Angie even worked there briefly while completing her teacher training. L&L’s one claim to fame was that Captain America’s sister worked there during the war. It was for less than a year, and at their old premises, but that didn’t deter the Cap fanboys.
“Yeah. I like that idea,” Tony murmured against Steve’s lips. “Whoever came up with it must be a genius.”
Steve’s eyes flickered between them like he was watching a tennis match; Stane walked slowly along the outline of the pool while Tony remained in the middle of the water, watching Stane with narrowed eyes. He was watching a predator at work, Steve realised.
When he moved to LA, Steve made a to-do list every day. He was struggling, so the lists helped. In the beginning. Then one day, he just… didn’t. Which was okay. But then he just didn’t for the second day. Then a third. And a fourth. And then, he stopped even making the lists. He just… stopped.
He tried to throw a hook punch, but he’d always been bad for broadcasting his moves before he made them.
“You started it,” Tony pointed out. His eyes flickered up automatically when Natasha walked over to Hank and Pierce, drawn by the movement. “And done,” he announced, closing the file and leaning over to drop it into the tray.
“We should call a team briefing,” Natasha said, ignoring Tony’s question, which was more than a little worrying.
“I thought you’d be the one cooking Italian,” Steve said to Tony. “You have Italian family, don’t you?”
“Oh, I intend to,” Sandy chuckled. “Three weeks in Florida sounds great right about now, even if it does mean putting up with my father-in-law. What about you? Heading off somewhere exotic?”
Sure enough, Clint saw sparks flying as the fire crew used the jaws of life to cut into the SUV, no doubt to get the patient out of there.
Twenty minutes later, he had everything on the list and his car had a distinct aroma of fish. It wasn’t even five am and the sun was just beginning to peek over the horizon and turn the sky in a washed-out baby blue, but Steve experienced a sense of achievement for the first time in… well, probably since before he moved to LA.
Tony frowned. Then he put down his mug and waved his hand, the holo-display disappearing between them.
Tony kissed the skin below Steve’s ear, breathing in the scent of his cologne and soap, now mixed with sweat.
So when Tony stepped around the corner of the cabin, he had no compunctions about repulsoring the two goons in the face. He snuck along the deck, following the plans JARVIS had found for the Guiletta, until he reached the door leading to the stairs. Tony descended to the lower decks, then paused.
Steve felt tears prick his eyes because that was Arnie, who he’d known most of his life, longer even than Bucky, and he still sounded the same. Pushing open the door, Steve pulled on a smile as he stepped into the room.
It was this, this warmth and closeness with friends - family, really - he liked. Catching up with old friends, making time to see each other and just laugh together. To be around the people you loved.
“Me too,” Tony agreed. “Truth is, I’m not half as good at anything as I am when I’m doing it next to you.”
He grabbed his satchel, running to catch up with Bucky, who was already out the door and heading down the hall.
“Okay, I’m going to get you some morphine,” Bruce promised, his mind already racing through the possibilities. Back pain, stomach pain; could be appendicitis or pancreatitis. Kidney stones, perhaps? An ovarian cyst? “In the meantime, I’m going to order an abdominal CT and I’ll give you a pelvic ultrasound.”
Tony suffers from a severe panic attack following an attack on the Tower but the Dreadnoughts, who set off an EMP which momentarily knocked out his arc reactor, reminding him of being in Afghanistan. He calls Steve in the middle of the night and Steve tells him to come over. Tony has a series of negative thoughts about himself and his actions. Steve stays awake most of the night with him, telling him stories about how he met Peggy. The following morning, they return to the Tower where they see the damage inflicted by the Dreadnoughts and Tony notices something strange in Steve's mood. If you want more information, jump over to Tumblr or Discord and send me a DM.
They stumbled into the bedroom and Steve managed to pause just long enough to fish for the door, pushing it shut before Tony toppled him onto the bed.
Steve yawned, blinking blearily at the ceiling. For a moment, he allowed himself to just lie there and revel in the fact that he didn’t have to go into work for six whole weeks. Six beautiful weeks of no teenagers, no marking, and - best of all - no parents. With another yawn, Steve kicked his way free from the blanket burrito, retrieved his glasses from the floor, and jammed them onto his face before shuffling towards the living room.
“My pleasure,” Tony smiled, ducking his head under the shower spray to rinse away the shampoo. Wiping the water out of his eyes, he eyed the stall, mentally working out the dimensions, before deciding yes, the risks would be worth the rewards. “So we have the apartment to ourselves?” Tony called.
He felt light-headed, watching Steve fall apart on his fingers. He scissored and twisted, fucking deep into Steve, until Steve groaned louder with every twist of Tony’s wrist, panting as his hands fisted into the sheets, a trickle of sweat rolling down his neck. Steve whined, writhing on Tony’s hand.
“You’re probably - no, definitely - the only person I’d ever consider moving to Brooklyn for,” Tony admitted, smoothing Steve’s hair back from his forehead.
“Okay,” Natasha nodded. “I’ll put you in touch with the cardiac surgeon’s office and they will arrange everything for you.”
Steve flopped onto his back with a huff, staring up at the ceiling and remembering his last heat, the one where Ellie was conceived.
“He was my sergeant in basic,” Tony explained. “And his kid found me today, asking me for help to find him. I might be… a little attached.”
Angie struck a pose; although Steve had already seen her in her dress, but with her smoky eyes and ruby red lips, the whole picture was breathtaking. She looked every inch the 1920s flapper girl.
He exhaled slowly after hanging up. Then he tossed his phone onto the counter and went to check on Steve.
“They’re a little alike,” Tony pointed out, while being charmed by Steve’s indignation on his behalf.
Clint huffed and reminded himself that she was here as a patient, not his ex, not a woman. He pushed away the flare of attraction and moved forward to study the lump on her side.
Particles of dust floated in the air, casting tiny shadows on the carpet as the sunlight streamed through the window, fading the pictures on the wall. Steve moved closer, studying the pictures of dolphins and whales and starfish and seabirds. This was Maria Stark’s office, he realised, staring at the map of the world with tiny pins dotted across the oceans. There was obviously some kind of meaning to the different colours of pins, that much was clear from the cluster of green pins near Greenland and the orange pins dotted around Louisiana and Florida, but Steve had no chance of figuring it out. Pulling open the filing cabinet, Steve found row after row of drop files, each one meticulously labelled in impeccable handwriting. The whole room spoke of a highly organised mind.
Something shot out of the water, smacking the back of Stane’s neck. Stane whirled around with a glare until he spotted Tony in the middle of the pool.
“Excuse me,” he called to one of the sellers. “Hi. I’m looking for these,” he explained, handing over his hastily scribbled list. “D’you have any of those?”
“Hey Stevie,” Bucky waved. Steve nodded, giving Bucky a half smile which didn’t reach his eyes. Tony frowned, the feeling in his gut making a reappearance. But then Bucky asked, “Hey, didja watch the footage from the fight?”
“Mister Stark is currently in the communal kitchen with the other Avengers,” JARVIS reported. “Would you like me to take you there?”
“Our usuals, Josie. And I think we’re gonna want wings, too,” he added, remembering Bucky’s words in the lab.
“Hey Clint. And everyone else.” Steve dropped his bags by the window, before bending to kiss Tony. “Hello.”
Steve grinned. He picked up Tony’s knife, ignoring the way Tony instinctively flinched away again, and held it out, offering Tony the handle. Tony swam forward, wrapping his hand around the handle slowly and lifting it from Steve’s hand with a frown on his face.
Steve put his book down in his lap, twisting to look up at Tony, a confused frown on his face. “Why isn’t he an Avenger then?”
“Now, I make a call to social services,” Tony explained. “And find out if they’ve noticed they’re missing one fifteen year old yet. Then I can help you with everything if… If you want her to stay.”
“No,” Tony sighed. “But I’m better than I was.” Tony shifted onto his side, looking down at Steve. Steve let himself sink into the pillows, enjoying the feeling of Tony looming over him. He loved the way Tony made him feel small and protected at times. He wondered sometimes what it would’ve been like if he’d known Tony when he really was small and skinny. Maybe then, Steve wouldn’t have hated it as much. “Did I ever thank you for sticking by me through rehab and all that shit? Because I’m pretty sure you deserve a medal.”
“Ah, night shift,” Alexander chuckled, pouring himself a mug of coffee. “It brings out the crazy in us all.”
“They’re all treating me differently,” he admitted. “Just because they know I’m dating Tony now. I’ve been dating him for a year and I didn’t change before. Did I?”
When the elevator doors, Steve followed the sound of the Avengers’ voices into the communal kitchen. He found them gathered around the table, which was covered in gifts and discarded wrapping paper. Liho darted around the table legs, batting a discarded bow between her paws.
Tony flashed him a strained smile. “Yeah. But then I started thinking. Wondering. If I’d ever felt like I belonged anywhere. And I realised, the only time I felt like I belonged was when I was with you.”
He couldn’t wait to see Tony, Steve realised as he rode up the elevator, Manhattan spread out below him on the other side of the glass. His knee bounced nervously. Then the elevator came to a smooth stop, the doors opening with a quiet ding.
“You’re not hurt,” Steve said. “You’re looking for drugs - again. You were last week and I remember you because you were wearing a Red Sox shirt and I hate the Red Sox. Get out of here.”
“Alright, so we can look on the Secretary of State’s website for the company details,” Rhodey explained. “If we do a business search for… Stark Industries. And here we go. Statement of information. Corporate name… address… Ah! CEO: Anthony Edward Stark. Stark’s the CEO.”
Steve’s hand curled around Tony’s wrist, tugging it up so he could press a kiss to the inside of his wrist, where the blue veins stood out starkly against his skin. They'd had a lot of sex, but this simple gesture was so intimate, Tony swore his heart doubled in size. Which wasn’t fair, because he wasn’t the Grinch dammit, he liked Christmas.
“Okay, but we have investors here. Important investors. I have been working on building these relationships for almost a year. I need this to make a good impression.”
“I’m Steve. Clint asked me to check on you,” he explained. “He got… slightly delayed arranging your scan.”
“I hope you weren’t too set on being married to a Major though,” Tony added. “I think that promotion pretty much went out of the window when I helped her escape.”
Scott never managed to work out what it was, because at that moment Steve leaned forward and kissed Stark.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, but the answer is usually yes,” Natasha teased, brushing past him to exit the jet.
When Steve’s alarm sounded, he was already awake but it still took him a good minute to roll over and switch it off. His phone fell silent, leaving nothing but the distant sounds of the traffic outside and the hum of the bathroom fan as Rhodey took his shower.
“Come on, Mr Stane’s about to make his speech,” Sharon called, grabbing Rhodey’s hand and dragging him further into the crowd, glancing over her shoulder to check that Steve was following.
“Definitely,” Daniel replied instantly. “But I still love you. Even if you did drag me all the way to Manhattan.”
“Ecstatic,” Marci said. She leaned past Foggy, pressing a kiss to Tony’s cheek. “I’m happy for you.”
“Where’s the fire?” Clint asked. His eyes widened. “There’s not a fire is there? If there is, it wasn’t me this time.”
train of thought. Face red, he continued reading, and from what little he knew of Tony and mers, it seemed like this Bruce Banner wasn’t far off the mark. There were some things which were obviously wrong - the placement of the gills, for one - but he had the diet almost spot on.
The last week of term always felt more like an exercise in crowd control than education, and none more so than the final week before summer. By midweek, both Steve and Angie decided to forgo shopping for a week of takeout. Which was all very well and good at the time, but now it was Saturday and Steve’s body ached and he was tired, and there was no way he could function like a human being without a cup of tea.
The progress bar inched across far too slowly for his liking. Steve itched to do something. He didn’t do well with inaction, which really should’ve been his first clue that something wasn’t right when he moved to LA.
“Love you,” Tony whispered, reaching out with one hand to grab the lube before kissing his way down Steve’s spine.
He reached back, fisting his hand in Tony’s sweat-slick hair as Tony’s thrusts sped up. Tony groaned again, his head falling forward, and then he came too, his teeth biting into Steve’s shoulder. Steve gasped, tightening his grip on Tony’s hair.
After a few minutes, Tony’s hands gently rolled Steve onto his back then Tony slipped out of bed. Steve’s eyes tracked him as he rounded the bed, flicking on the bathroom light before disappearing inside. A moment later, Steve heard the sound of running water, then Tony returned with a cloth in hand, crawling back into bed and running it over Steve, wiping him clean with such care and tenderness. It always filled Steve with warmth, dancing down his spine and leaving his toes tingling. He almost loved the aftercare more than the orgasm.
Before, he would’ve gone up to the Stark Mansion to sit on the terrace, his feet dangling in the pool, but it was being demolished. Steve had decided, once the investigation was over, to tear it down. Architects and fans objected, but Steve was adamant. There were too many ghosts trapped in those walls. He would never live there and he couldn’t sell it, couldn’t bear the thought of
“And then I would’ve said that what you did was impressive,” Steve continued, remembering their first meeting when they went for coffee in Brooklyn. “And you still would’ve thought I meant Iron Man and I’d have to correct you. Then I would’ve bought you a drink.”
Steve followed, and felt he did a passable job of keeping up with Bucky. Those years of parkour with Peggy were paying off.
Steve sat up and swallowed. He found the remote and turned off the TV, keeping his breath even as he replied, “Hi dad.”
So he got back to work. He told himself that doing even this little thing to protect Tony was enough. He was doing what he could, and that was all that mattered.
His hands were shaking as he disinfected the wound on his leg again, perched on the edge of the bathtub. Steve took a deep breath, hissing, “Motherfucker!” under his breath as the disinfectant stung the open cut, pain shooting up his leg. It wasn’t deep, the cut, but it was long. It ran from just below his kneecap, curving around his calf to an inch or so above his ankle.
“Yeah,” Tony winced, thinking of Pepper’s many warnings that he and the Avengers had to be at the event, stressing the importance of it to her and the company. “Bright side.”
“He has multiple citations for bravery, he’s been injured in the line of duty defending this country,” Rogers continued. “He is so much more than a- What was it?
Scott eyed Stark and grudgingly admitted that was kinda cool. He barely even blinked in the face of the drunk’s punch and had him in the arm lock in the space of a second.
“Where?” Steve demanded. “Tony, we’re in the middle of the ocean; where exactly is safe? Besides, I can look after myself, and-”
“Thanks but, uh, no thanks,” Steve replied, pulling off his scrubs. “I’ve told you before: I’m married.”
He felt like he wanted to lie down again and just forget everything, but he couldn’t do that. Because if he did, Tony would go hungry. And Tony didn’t deserve to starve just because Steve was a terrible person.
He raised his head when Tony ran his hand through his hair and found their faces inches apart. Something settled in Steve, a voice in his head whispering
Finally, Steve was released from the stand. It took everything he had not to push past the guard escorting him out of the courtroom. He stepped into the hall and instantly Tony was on his feet and hurrying across the corridor towards him. Steve stepped forward into Tony’s waiting arms and buried his face into his neck.
He could do that, he guessed. He would have to get dressed, but he had one clean pair of jeans left and a couple of t-shirts which weren’t ready to get up and walk on their own so that was… possible.
“I’d love to refute that,” Tony replied, picking the sleep from the corner of his eye with his finger, “But...”
Hope bit back a smile. Of course Tony was attached. If she’d learned anything over the past six months of working together, it was that Tony became attached to most of his patients and definitely to the kids. He was such a dad, he just lacked his own child. For now. She had no doubt that sooner rather than later he and Steve would take the step to becoming parents.
“Catch.” Bucky tossed something at Steve. He caught it automatically then frowned at it. It was his keys. “You’re going back to the Tower.”
Tony sighed but he let Steve pull him backwards until he was lying on his back. Steve shuffled closer, resting his head on Tony’s chest and splaying his hand over his heart. He felt Tony’s fingers card through his hair and Steve closed his eyes, hoping his presence would help lure Tony back to sleep.
Who the fuck is this anyway?” Tony snapped, turning his gaze on Bruce, who was staring in disbelief at Tony, his eyes flickering from the gils to the patches of scales on his torso to his tail.
“Like why it’s at the Air and Space Museum. He wasn’t in the Air Force. The only time he flew a plane in the forties, he crashed it.”
Tony chuckled, his love for Peggy’s daughters growing every time he learned something new about them.
The hair on the back of Steve’s neck prickled. He had a suspicion that he knew where this was going.
They stumbled into the shower, the instantly hot water a blessing Steve was supremely grateful for after his impromptu dip in the North Atlantic. Tony reached past him for the shampoo, squirting a little out into their palms. Steve soaped his hair, ducking his head under the spray to rinse.
“And I know we had the conversation about not dating anyone else,” Tony continued, “But maybe we need to have the conversation about where we see this going. So we can avoid another miscommunication like this.”
“People were having sex in the forties, Stark,” Bucky pointed out. “People were even having gay sex in the forties, despite what the history books tell you.”
Steve offered him what he hoped was a confident smile. Then he almost dropped the pool cleaning supplies again when someone walked into his back.
“You bought me the goddamn books!” Steve retorted. Energy bubbled in his veins, and he couldn’t just
“That’s right,” Joseph nodded and Steve was right, his father was smirking. He reached out a hand towards Tony in a clear invitation.
He flicked the nipple with his tongue, before swirling it around Steve’s areola, then tugging it gently with his teeth until Steve keened. Tony pulled back, licking his lips, watching Steve’s half-lidded eyes follow the movement.
Steve dropped his spoon to cover Tony’s hands with his own, squeezing his wrist in what he hoped was a comforting move.
“No, but don’t get too close if you’re wearing anything that you can’t afford to lose or can’t get wet,” Steve warned.
“I’m Captain America,” Bucky snapped, ducking under the tape. “And this building’s owned by Clint Barton. What the hell is going on here?”
Tying the laces on his steel toe-capped boots sapped him of his energy, but Steve forced himself to keep moving forward. Robotically, he collected a bottle of water from the fridge for himself, then picked out some fish for Tony and tucked the small plastic container with the blanched vegetables in beside the fish.
Steve chuckled. He flipped open the cap, squirting lube onto his hand, and began opening Tony up. It had been a while since he’d topped, and watching Tony writhe on his fingers was mesmerising. Steve watched, open-mouthed, his pulse speeding up and his breath hitching. He pressed an open-mouthed kiss to the inside of Tony’s thigh.
Tony would love talking to Rhodey, Steve thought to himself. They could talk science and technology and Tony would be in his element. Steve could picture the way his face would light up, his eyes dancing with excitement. It was impossible, but for a moment, Steve imagined introducing them in a world where Tony wasn’t under threat.
“I know where it is even if it’s not on the board,” Steve retorted, falling into the familiar and well-worn argument.
Natasha tried to turn her attention back to the pile of paperwork that was taunting her and laughing, but her mind kept wandering to what she had mentally christened the Thing. The Thing first popped into her head a few days ago, but after going to Sharon’s latest scan with her this morning, the Thing had returned with full force and refused to leave her alone.
Steve opened his mouth to protest when he was hit by the memory of the fire department being called to their apartment because of the toaster he’d tried to fix, and decided staying silent was the wisest course of action.
“Right,” he announced, drawing the attention of his students. “Good afternoon. Turn to chapter five in the textbook…”
“Call Ms Potts,” Steve ordered, hurrying towards the stairs. “I’m going to change, I’ll be back in five minutes. Oh, Ari?” he added, leaning over the bannister on the second floor. “How’s your eye for design?”
To an outsider, it looked like Arnie was holding his granddaughter, all thanks to a twist of fate. But Steve knew that if he’d had Ellie in the forties, they would’ve had to bond and then Arnie would’ve been denied the happiness he’d had with Michael. Because Arnie might’ve been one of his best friends but Steve had never felt anything other than friendship towards him. They slept together because Steve needed help and he trusted Arnie in a way that he trusted very few alphas.
“I love you. I love you, Tony. Tony,” Stve groaned, burying his face into the pillow and coming hard, clenching around Tony's dick.
Tony shut down his work screens at 4:30 before taking the elevator up to the penthouse to change out of his work clothes into a fresh t-shirt and jeans. He shoved his feet into his sneakers, grabbing his wallet and keys, before heading down to the garage. On the way to Steve’s apartment, Tony detoured to Ample Hills Creamery’s Red Hook factory to pick up several tubs of ice cream, making sure he had Steve’s favourite.
“Is there a third option?” Steve asked, trying to break off a piece of chicken with his fork while holding his wriggling pup with the other hand.
he watching? He didn’t even recognise it. He must’ve zoned out for… a while, considering the end credits struck up as he watched. Which, okay, that wasn’t great, but it didn’t mean anything. And it wasn’t his fault.
The air all around him began to shimmer, and his heart sank. The shimmer faded away as they disengaged stealth mode.
Hogan looked unimpressed but he sighed, glancing at the woman by his side before nodding. “Fine. Let’s get this over with.”
When Steve woke the next morning, it was to a dry mouth and a pounding headache. He groaned and tried to burrow beneath the pillows. The usually soft linens felt rough against his skin and everything seemed too loud even though there was no sound except for a very familiar chuckle.
Then he raised his arm. The only problem was that it wasn’t the one with the sloppily wrapped bandage, a fact that he only realised a few minutes later.
Rhodey sat down on the sofa, picking up his laptop and opening it on the coffee table. He started typing, then paused, glancing up. “You gonna sit down, or just loom in the corner like a particularly buff vampire?”
He and Tony made liberal use of the building’s gym, trying anything to get rid of their nervous energy. Matt flew down for the Fourth of July and he and Bucky dragged them out for dinner to celebrate Steve’s birthday, which provided a welcome distraction for a few hours. But then Monday rolled around and there was still no verdict.
Steve watched Tony race towards the elevator, shouting out instructions to JARVIS to prepare the Mark Forty Three and relay a message to Bucky. Then the elevator doors closed, leaving Steve in the silence of the apartment.
Tony nodded. “Originally he was my patient. I asked Romanoff if I could tap out. It was… too much. I spoke to him though. Later. Don’t know if I got through.”
Steve’s eyes flickered around the room, assessing which door would be his best chance of escape. The corridor to the library was closest but a dead end. He could cut through the kitchens, but it was a risk. Stane was closer to the hall that would take him to the pool. And the front door was locked shut behind Steve.
“Steve, I’m going to be honest with you: we can’t beat him in a court of law,” Marci pointed out. “We need to win the court of public opinion.”
The little voice in his head told him to walk away before he did or said something he would regret. Just walk away.
“Hey Cap, it’s Tony. Stark. Obviously,” the message began. “If you don’t know who I am by now then frankly, I’m insulted. Anyway. So listen, I have a proposition for you. No, not like that. I don’t know if you were thinking that but apparently people get the wrong idea when you tell them you have a proposition for them. Or maybe they just get the wrong idea when I say it? Whatever. Who knows. I have a proposition for you: there’s a room in Stark Tower with your name on it if you want it. Well, really it’s more of an apartment. Or floor. Am I babbling? Pepper says I tend to babble on voicemail so I usually just don’t bother but I didn’t know if- You know what? I am. I’m babbling. So yeah. If you want to get out of your SHIELD digs, there’s space in the Tower for you. Bruce is already moved in and Clint has all but agreed but I’m working on him - not like that! - and I think if you agreed then our spider-woman’ll be onboard too. So yeah. That’s it. Bye, Cap.”
In the morning, Steve looked marginally better once more, but then the apple slices made a reappearance about twenty minutes after Steve finished eating and Tony accepted he was in it for the long haul.
Steve knew it was coming once Ellie was weaned but that didn’t mean he was any more ready when his first heat hit. He was tired and achey and everything was too much or too loud and he wished he could just make it go away.
“You can do this,” Steve muttered. “Come on, Rogers. You went into enemy territory against orders with less nerves than this. They’re your team.”
Ellie squealed loudly, tottering across the grass towards Arnie, who laughed and held out his hands.
“Didn’t we have that conversation about you not telling me when you get hurt?” Steve asked, raising an eyebrow.
“No? What about your boyfriend who loves to cuddle?” Tony asked, his mouth twitching as he valiantly tried to hold back a smile. Steve appreciated the effort if nothing else.
“Applying the code deconstructed by Agent Romanoff,” JARVIS explained, “I have been able to determine that the Maggia are using a shipping company known as Northeastern Shipping Company to bring their imports in and out of New York and Connecticut. However, there are no details on where the items are being imported from. There are also missing details on several customers who have purchased weapons from the Maggia.”
“What’s going on?” Steve called, retrieving his lunch from the fridge and popping a grape in his mouth.
didn’t wash. Because of course Tony was a dick. Look at everything he’d been through, and Steve knew he’d only skimmed the surface.
“Shh,” Tony whispered, pressing his lips to Steve’s stomach. “It’s okay, I’ve got you. I’ve got you,” he repeated, a lump forming in his throat.
Tony fell silent, spinning his spoon through his soup. Steve watched him silently; there was something Tony wanted to say, that much was obvious, but he wasn’t ready to say it. Steve could wait.
Steve hummed and nodded, trying to hide how nervous he suddenly felt again. He’d forgotten all about meeting the Avengers while distracted by the comments on his latest piece of art.
Steve replied by flipping him off, but he followed Tony back to the VIP area where Steve decided to up the ante by sitting between Tony’s legs. Which resulted in Tony’s hand curling around his thigh, dangerously close to his dick, and squeezing.
“You’re killing me here,” Tony groaned. Steve grinned unrepentantly. “Besides,” Tony continued, rubbing little circles into Steve’s hip with his other hand, “I love watching you like this.” He kissed Steve’s collarbone, pressing his finger in further and stretching, smiling when Steve’s breath stuttered. “I love watching you fall apart. You are just so goddamn beautiful, honey, I can’t believe you’re mine.”
“I didn’t steal from him!” Clint retorted. “And why are you surprised? You just called me a carny and a thief.”
He’d already been stripped of his identity until he was just Tony Stark’s boyfriend, and now he couldn’t even do anything to help find Tony. Objectively, he knew that the Avengers didn’t really need his help - even minus Tony and Clint they still had a super-soldier, a demigod, a spy and the Hulk - but sitting around and doing nothing when someone he loved was in danger had never been something he excelled at.
Steve’s mouth opened, a soft sound of surprise vibrating in his chest that, Tony realised with a thrill, he could feel where they were pressed together. Tony deepened the kiss, even as it left him breathless, curling his hand further into Steve’s hair to hold him close. His insides were melting, he was turning into a pile of goo, and it was all Steve’s fault, and Tony didn’t even care. Steve’s hands gripped Tony’s hips, and a thrill ran through him, all the way down to his toes.
“Alright,” Hogan agreed gruffly. But when Pepper moved away, Hogan held onto her hand, giving it a lingering squeeze before releasing her reluctantly.
“She’s still in the SUV,” Maria nodded. “We didn’t want to move her, that’s why we called you. The doors are jammed, you gotta go in through the sunroof.”
The Tower was filled with all of Tony’s favourite people, and as cheesy as it sounded, it was the best gift he could have this Christmas. Although he still wanted gifts. Lots of gifts. He was only human.
“I have an idea.” Dr. Stark filled a tub with water from the sink, taking it and a cloth and sitting opposite Johnny. He soaked the cloth and laid it over his shirt where it was stuck to his arm. “Here we go. Just give it a minute. So, if your boyfriend is in here getting treated, why are you lurking outside like a vampire waiting to be invited in?”
Tony chuckled, stepping into the apartment around Evie Rose and closing the door. Steve was in the kitchen, balancing Hannah on his hip, throwing Tony a soft smile.
“So, why are we waiting? So I can go get shot again? Seems like a dumb excuse when I think about it.”
He turned and almost tripped over Evie Rose and Zoey again, this time in pursuit of Lucky, whose tail was wagging so quickly it was all but a blur. Tony smiled to himself. Across the room, Clint was talking to Daniel, Hannah in his arms, and Peggy had joined Steve and Rhodey’s conversation.
They all glanced up at the sound of helicopter blades; a few seconds later, the Medevac landed by the parking lot and a group of orderlies sprinted out into the rain with a gurney. The Medevac doors opened and a small body strapped into a board was quickly but carefully loaded onto the gurney and rushed inside.
“While I have you,” Pepper continued. “I need you to clear December 1st. Stark Industries is organising a Meet the Heroes event for our potential investors so I need all of the Avengers on their best behaviour.”
“Yeah,” Steve nodded. He accepted Tony’s hand to haul himself to his feet, stepping into Tony’s arms. “This has been my home for seven years.”
“Well, I’d advise you to get a lawyer,” Tony explained. “One that specialises in real estate so they can check the contracts. Usually a survey is a good idea. If you’re planning on changing what the building’s used for-”
He slipped his arm around Tony’s waist and Tony’s hand curled around the back of Steve’s neck, pressing their foreheads together as they danced. Steve shifted impossibly closer until they were pressed together from shoulder to hip, straddling Tony’s thigh and grinding against his hip, pulling a groan from Tony’s throat.
“The door’s not opening,” Steve replied, and he could hear of the hint of hysteria in his voice but there was nothing he could do about it. “Come on, open!”
“Tracksuit Mafia, right,” Tony nodded. “Okay, first of all, we need a better name for them than that.”
Steve readjusted his arms, tightening his hold, and buried his face in Tony’s neck to breathe in the familiar smell of his cologne and the undertone of coconut that Tony always seemed to have. He felt Tony rest his cheek against the top of his head.
wasn’t in San Antonio. Home was a long way away and it was destroyed when his dad decided his two kids weren’t worth carrying on for and didn’t care that his teenage son would be left alone once he went to jail.
Tony exhaled loudly. “Not particularly but ignoring it doesn’t seem to be working,” he admitted wetly.
“There you are,” Angie’s voice rang out. Steve glowered at her. “Uh oh,” she sing-songed. “That’s a face. Who pissed in your pasta?”
“Wow. You might actually be even more pathetic than me,” Tony mused. He picked a raw prawn from the container, tossing it in the air and catching it with his mouth.
Pepper joined the crowd of waiting investors, leaving Steve alone and pretending that he didn’t notice their sly glances towards him. Taking a deep breath, he adjusted his tie and straightened his jacket. Ari slipped out of the door behind him.
When Steve returned, Tony was redressing his wound. Steve kissed his temple, before picking up the toothbrush he’d left there before. Tony smiled, glancing up at Steve every few seconds and thinking to himself how good and natural Steve looked in his space.
Tony wrapped his arms around his neck, leaning down to kiss the top of his head. “Sorry, honey,” he murmured. “I really thought you knew.”
“Well, duh,” she agreed. “Hey, guess what? Remember those cookies I got from one of my juniors at Christmas?”
Which was why he blurted out, “Do you want to hold her?” without stopping to think about it too hard.
Tony paused, glancing up at Steve through his eyelashes before carrying on with a sigh. Steve clenched his jaw and pursed his lips.
“You are a disaster,” Tony shook his head. He turned back to Steve, a feeling in his gut telling him something wasn’t right. Before he could question it, the door banged open and Bucky strolled in.
Steve had his doubts that a threatening letter would be enough to make Joseph stop, but he trusted Marci’s experience.
“Uh, Bucky took me for hot dogs earlier,” Steve replied, nerves seizing his gut. “And before that, I had a meeting with Marci.”
She nodded, letting Joseph and his lawyers enter the conference room before leaving, closing the door behind her.
“What’s going on?” Clint asked, trying for casual and missing by a mile. He’d never been good at this sort of thing. The seeing exes sort of thing.
“Fair enough,” Bucky nodded. “And hey, that means I get to see my boyfriend so, uh, no complaints from me.”
He curled himself around Tony, managing to whisper, “Alpha,” between kisses and Tony’s hand spasmed on his hip, his fingers digging into Steve’s skin as his skirt rode up and that was better, so much better, because now Tony was touching him skin on skin.
“Your mother had low blood sugar,” Bruce repeated, fighting to keep his face looking as innocent as possible.
“Sir, Agent Romanoff is enquiring whether you and Mr Rogers will be joining the rest of the team for dinner,” JARVIS announced.
Steve considered it. On one hand, he wanted to see justice done. But on the other, he couldn’t keep taking forty minute showers to wash away the feeling of Nefaria’s eyes on him.
“Hang on,” he laughed, picking up his vodka and drinking as much as he could before Angie lost patience. “How much did she drink while we were dancing?” he asked, leaning in to kiss Tony. “Back soon.”
Suddenly Peter and Johnny’s nervousness made sense. It wasn’t just about not being out as gay, it was about not being out as a couple. Sharon nodded awkwardly, pulling back the curtain.
“Like you can do any better,” he grumbled, shuffling over the tiles until he was sitting by Tony’s side.
Standing up, he wiped his face then marched back to the Tower, keeping his head low to avoid anyone recognising him. He ignored the greeting from Pilar at the reception desk, going straight to the Avengers’ private elevator and waving his watch in front of the panel. The doors slid open.
He watched Tony’s expression carefully; his face remained blank, but his eyes - always his eyes - flashed with pain and hatred.
“Okay…” Angie turned to her menu. “Waffles deluxe, side of corned beef hash, and half a grapefruit. Thanks.”
“Nah,” Tony grinned, hopping out of the water and lounging on his elbows. “I think I’ll just sit back and look pretty while you do all the work.”
EDIT 2: Look at the amazing art by profoundlyexceeded of Angie in her costume!!!! I am in love with it!!! Look at the detail on the dress! A huge thank you to profoundlyexeeded for taking my random ideas and turning it into a beautiful piece of art. I am so lucky to have it become part of this fic. Check out more of their art on
Tony’s eyes darkened. “Yeah, well, you’re good at that, aren’t you?” he hissed. “Being alone? Or did you think I was that stupid? Why else would you be here? Because you have no one else.”
“Right,” Steve muttered, grinding his teeth and glaring a little at Rhodey and Sharon’s backs. It wasn’t their fault, he tried to remind himself. They didn’t know Tony. They didn’t know that he
“The Mermaid House?” Bruce exclaimed, gaping at Steve from the passenger seat. “You expect me to believe there is a mermaid
“Like that time you tried to jump across the Charles River after the Christmas party,” Alexander continued. “Remember?”
“Good evening, Mr Hogan,” Natasha greeted the patient, closing the curtain behind her. “Sounds like you’ve had an interesting one.”
“It’s like you don’t even wanna get laid tonight,” Bucky declared, still staring at the woollen monstrosity.
“As I was saying,” Clint barrelled on. “I took him to a vet and then I took him home and I was hoping I could keep him?” He glanced pleadingly between Steve and Tony. “Please, dads?”
Then he sprinted towards the locker room before Hank could say another word, because date with Dodgy Darren or not, if Hank found out that Hope and Scott were together, Scott knew his life would become a living hell.
What was he supposed to do now? Obviously he had two options: like Tony back, or swipe left and forget about him. That would be the sensible option, because people like Tony Stark did not go for people like Steve. Tony Stark inhabited an entirely different world. Swiping left was the right thing to do.
“Bruce, when it comes to your patient, don’t worry about what other doctors think,” Natasha told him.
“Those were amazing,” Rhodey agreed, moving into the crowd. Steve followed slowly, glancing around and wondering if he’d made a mistake in coming here.
“I wanna help,” Rhodey said slowly. “And I’m starting to agree there might be something weird going on here, but if we’re going to do anything about it, we need proof.”
Very creepy, but Clint didn't want to insult the man offering to bend the rules for him.“Why do you think I want to get rid of it?”
“Let’s not tell him about what Tony did in the kitchen the other day,” Steve stage-whispered to Ellie, tickling her sides until she giggled and squirmed away from him.
“Yes. But when we were dating, I was a mess. I was addicted to painkillers to the point where I almost lost my job. I was in rehab for almost six months and Steve came to visit me every day. He was still working, and dealing with my dad telling him that he could do better than me. But he…” Stark’s mouth twisted into a disbelieving smile. “He never gave up on me. Still wasn’t sure he’d say yes, but he did. But yeah, I waited that long because I had to. If we were married when my shit went down, Steve might’ve felt like he
Tony chuckled. He picked up a pair of cufflinks from the box before crossing to Steve and holding them out. Steve smiled. He set his mug aside and took the cufflinks. He knew that Tony was perfectly capable of putting on his own cufflinks, but the thought of dressing Tony for work warmed him in inexplicable ways. Perhaps because he was here and part of Tony’s morning routine and the whole thing was so wonderfully domestic.
Tony’s fingers trailed a line up his neck, tangling in Steve’s hair. His nails scratched his scalp and Steve hummed appreciatively.
“So, uh, when I moved in here I thought this was the place where I’d be a husband and have kids,” he said, watching his toe run across the floor to avoid looking at Angie. “Things, uh, well, they didn’t exactly work out as planned and I got you instead.”
Steve and Bucky turned. Steve found himself looking at another man, slightly taller, dark hair and wearing glasses with red lenses. Bucky beamed at him; they stepped forward, kissing softly, and Steve surmised this must be Matt.
There was something weird about Steve tonight, Tony realised. It was subtle, but they’d spent enough time talking that Tony felt pretty confident in his assessment that something was off. Something related to Tony.
“Amazing. You’re just so amazing, so perfect,” Tony babbled, grabbing the lube and squirting some onto his hand. “Best sex ever. God, I love you so much. I don’t, don’t ever want to do this with anyone else ever again.”
He stayed there with her in his arms until he was sure that she was asleep, then lingered for several minutes longer, scenting her and leaning his cheek against her silky soft hair.
He finished tidying up the bathroom after his shower and padded into the kitchen in search of something to eat. Grabbing a pot of pasta, he stuck it into the microwave and hopped up onto the counter to wait for it, pulling out his phone and messaging Bucky.
“Probably,” Tony murmured, closing his eyes as the familiar hum of the landing gear filled the jet. “Or too late. One of the two.”
Natasha wanted that. She wanted what Hogan and Pepper had and the only way she could do that was if she stopped being scared.
As soon as he was able to move again, he slumped against Tony’s side, pressing a kiss to his neck, before slicking his finger again and pushing them back into Tony. He curled his fingers, pressing against Tony’s prostate until he was a babbling mess.
“Oh, that’s just great. I try to reassure you, and you turn it around and make me feel worse!” Tony teased, punching Steve’s shoulder. But then he pulled Steve into his arms, kissing him gently. “You’ll be fine,” he promised. “And if you’re not, just give me the wink, and I’ll point out to Barnes that Barton isn’t eating his vegetables and we’ll have to watch Captain America force a grown man to eat broccoli, and then we’ll all feel equally awkward.”
Steve pulled his mask from his backpack and slipped it on; there was a smell of damp which could be attributed to the giant swimming pool, but with his history of respiratory problems it was better to be safe than sorry.
Steve chuckled, part of him taking perverse pleasure from imagining the looks of shock on Joseph and his lawyers’ faces if Tony burst through the window in the Iron Man suit.
Bruce pulled off his gloves, tossing them into the bin and crossing to Matt’s side. “She’s been having these episodes of psychosis for two years?”
“Wow,” Steve deadpanned. “Did you decide to be a supervillain because of the name, or did you pick the name after becoming a supervillain? I’m just curious which came first.”
Tony was a responsibility Steve didn’t want. But who else was there? Tony might’ve made it this long on his own, but Steve was painfully aware of the way Tony’s skin stretched across his ribs. Without Steve, Tony would die. A horrible, painful death. As much as Steve didn’t want that responsibility, there was no one else to take it on.
Making his way down the beach, Steve kicked off his flip flops, abandoning them on the sand before wading into the shallows, negotiating his way across the rocks to one that stuck up above the waves. Steve sat down, flicking open his sketchpad to the latest picture of Tony and continued shading in his tail.
There was a rap at the door then it opened and Tony Stark walked in, in a sharp suit and pulling off a pair of sunglasses with an easy smile on his face.
Steve frowned. He started to look at the house, really look at it. Because something wasn’t adding up.
Tony jerked backward, his eyes going wide with a flash of fear. His hands clenched and unclenched, then he opened and closed his mouth twice before squeezing his eyes shut.
“No, I want to keep my job,” Steve snapped. “But that’s not an option. So if it’s a choice between being fired and quitting, I think I want to quit.”
They made their way downstairs to the elevator. Tony leaned against the back wall, tugging Steve close and sliding his arm around his waist. Steve went willingly, leaning against Tony and rubbing circles into his chest through his shirt.
Steve glanced at his watch to see how much time he had before he was supposed to meet Tony when the hairs on the back of his neck stood up. Raising his gaze, Steve found the blonde woman staring at him with an emotionless smile. His skin crawled.
“Wow, look at that, Ellie,” Steve said. “Look what dad got you. That’s pretty, huh?” He turned to Tony. “Can you…”
He tried the garage by the house first but found it empty. Leaving the garage, he followed the gravel path down into the grounds until he found the outbuildings he’d seen when he arrived that first afternoon, but never made it out to explore them on account of the stabbing.
Bruce ran after her; when he came closer he realised the woman was held down with thick black straps and she struggled and screamed, not from pain, but in anger. “Don’t touch me! Don’t touch me!”
Alexander stepped forward and took Steve’s chin in his hand. It was so similar and yet so different from the way Tony cupped his cheek less than two hours ago. Tony’s hand was strong but gentle; Alexander’s was demanding and unyielding. God, why did he ever think that this was something he wanted? He’d considered letting Tony go for this? Jesus, past-Steve was an idiot.
Frigga Borson swayed towards him, smiling serenely. Loki Borson however, scowled and snatched up his mother’s coat.
The doors to the courtroom opened and they filed in, claiming seats in the second row on the prosecutor’s side of the courtroom. Pretty soon the gallery was full. Everyone wanted a glimpse of the man who had tried to take down the Avengers.
Tony was in the shower the next morning when he heard the bathroom door open and close. He froze, before spinning around, smacking his elbow against the wall of the tiny cubicle, hissing when he hit his funny bone.
Tony’s grip on Steve’s fingers tightened. They watched the foreman hand over the verdict form to the clerk.
Tony hummed and when Steve looked up, he found Tony wearing an expression that could only be described as the cat that got the cream.
Steve stared at the pages he’d printed out, the instruction manuals for both the pump and filter, and tried to pretend he was reading them carefully and not internally panicking. He risked glancing up and found Tony watching him with one eyebrow raised. Steve instantly dropped his gaze back to the instructions and wished he’d paid more attention in physics or shop class or whatever would’ve helped him understand what the hell the instructions were talking about.
“Well, Pepper’s expecting us at Stark Industries, so probably around the time she threatens my life or my manhood for not being there.”
Carol’s face became carefully composed as she nodded slowly. “Yeah. I knew him. Knew of him mostly. We didn’t work together.”
“Shh, you.” Tony pushed a hand into Steve’s face. “No spilling my deepest, darkest secrets to these idiots. Thor, you have a story for every occasion. Come on, spill. Make Clint feel better about himself.”
Bruce huffed. Maybe it was the way the officer so casually dismissed Jessica as crazy, maybe it was the determination in Matt’s jaw when he told their story, maybe it was the assumption that a woman’s problems must stem from her trauma, or maybe it was just the feeling in his gut that said,
“I don’t need one,” he replied carefully. “My best friends had their first baby before they were married.”
There was a pause. The water sloshed over Steve’s knees; glancing down, Steve saw Tony pull himself out of the water, perching on the edge of the pool and watching Steve with a small frown.
“I find it highly suspicious,” Tony continued, a faint tremor in his voice, “That this happened tonight. When
Tony glanced around the room, taking in the ornate marble, guided columns, and golden chandeliers, anything to avoid looking at Bucky. He’d avoided mentioning anything to Bucky over the past three days about the almost definitely a break-up. In all honesty, he’d avoided Bucky, because he didn’t want to lie to his friend.
Despite his assurances that he wouldn’t cut off a finger, Steve caught the knife just in time a few times. It wasn’t his fault; he found himself captivated watching Tony work. It wasn’t the first time he’d seen Tony cook, but it was the first time they’d cooked dinner together in their kitchen instead of Tony’s kitchen.
Scott pushed up onto his tiptoes, eyeing the couple in question through the crack in the curtain and decided that Steve was probably right.
He shifted closer and Tony rolled onto his back, so Steve could rest his head on Tony’s shoulder. Tony wrapped his arm around Steve, leaning down to kiss his forehead.
As soon as Angie announced she was spending the night at her sister’s, Steve had his phone in hand, texting Tony to ask if he was free that night. Tony's reply was almost instantaneous.
“Spent the week in court,” Daniel replied, pulling a face. He winked at Steve. “I hate being surrounded by all those lawyers.”
It was well known that the endorphins from sex helped stave off the worst of heat symptoms, which had led to the misconception that omegas needed sex during their heat.
“Okay,” Tony nodded, reluctantly releasing Steve. His hands dragged over Steve’s waist and arms as he climbed out of the water.
“No, I don’t get it,” she interrupted. “You’re out. I know that. I’ve seen the pictures of you and your mom at Pride. Your dad got a warning from the cops last month for threatening a homophobe in a bar and he wears that as a badge of honour. So that’s not a problem. Which means I’m starting to think the problem is me.”
“Hi,” Steve waved, an easy smile on his face, the smile which automatically made everyone around him relax.
“Yeah, I'll live. This isn’t my first rodeo. Well, it’s not my first kidnapping, I’ve never actually been to a rodeo. Are they good?”
“Whoa, you look hot,” Scott exclaimed, drinking in the sight of Hope in a dress and heels. “Wait, you look hot. Did we have a-” He glanced around quickly, making sure no one was close enough to overhear, before lowering his voice just in case. “Did we have a date that I forgot about?”
“Rude,” Tony muttered. It took him a moment to locate the remote, selecting yes and settling back to watch another episode.
“I’m great,” Tony replied with a faint smile. He coughed into his elbow and it wracked his whole body, his wheezing breath cutting through the air. Steve frowned, stepping forward before stopping suddenly when he realised there was nothing he could do to help. He’d never done well with being powerless, and seeing Tony obviously ill and in pain was starting to tug on some memories he’d locked in a box and buried deep underground.
“Okay, not a dream,” he sighed, taking in the abandoned warehouse and the chair he was currently tied to. “Well, this is disappointingly cliched.”
“As opposed to you, who had everything in the world handed to him on a silver spoon,” Nefaria spat, his mask slipping.
“Doctors are scary,” Clint shrugged, tossing a piece of popcorn in the air and catching it in his mouth while Ellie stared in awe.
He waited until Matt’s hand wrapped around his bicep, before heading over to the two stools in the front window.
“I thought I saw you,” Peggy announced as she strode into the kitchen in a flurry of flowing silk and jangling bangles. “But then I said to myself,
Pepper leaned back against the wall, her expression becoming wistful. “We wasted so much time on other people and stupid excuses and now we’re out of time. And all those excuses, they don’t matter anymore. I just want to marry the love of my life.”
“Just back to my car,” Steve explained. “I got some new sand for the filter. I’ll be back in ten minutes.”
Steve and Peggy overhear a discussion between two men at the bar where one of them laughs about his son stealing a girl's snack because he "has a crush on her". The other man argues that it's not cute, it's bullying and asks what it will lead to in the future, asking if his son will understand that no means no (mention of rape with no details). He goes on to point out the hypocrisy of his friend's statement, arguing that he wouldn't react the same way if another child treated his own daughter that way.
“I like to come down here and look at it, almost every day,” Stane mused. “Pretend he’s still with us. The day Howard Stark died, we all suffered. A loss for the whole world.”
Stepping away, Tony scrolled through his contacts until he found what he was looking for a pressed call.
“Alright sir,” Stark said, his tone placating, approaching the drunk slowly. “If you just take a seat-”
They watched Foggy sign as a witness, then he smiled and wished them well, promising again to have the papers filed by the end of the day as he left. Steve closed the door behind him then burst out laughing.
Steve shook his head, gripping the steering wheel as he drove through Hollywood Hills. “Bastard,” he muttered. He wasn’t sure if he was referring to Stane or Stark. Maybe both.
Steve laid out the impeller housing ‘o’ rings and shaft seals, double checking their part numbers against the instructions to ensure he’d picked up the right ones. Considering he didn’t know what a shaft seal was until recently, Steve felt it was a good idea to double check, mostly so Tony couldn’t mock him if he put the wrong part into the pump.
Scott had a very bad feeling due to the fact that it almost kinda looked and sounded like Clint Barton was right. And if Clint Barton was right about something involving relationships, it might be the end of days.
Because it looked like they were having sex. Whoever took this picture knew exactly what they were doing.
“I think it looks like a mangy possum,” Tony retorted. “Get rid of it, or we tie you down and shave it off like we did with Thor’s soul patch.”
“I’m sorry, honey,” Tony chuckled. “My turn? Okay, uh… Never have I ever gone out with a friend’s ex.”
“I need you to run every test,” Loki interrupted, leading his mother by the elbow as they made their way towards an exam room. “And I do not want to have to wait for the results. Do I make myself clear, Dr. Banner?”
“This is good,” Marci told him. “We have a paper trail to show how much of a thieving bastard he is.”
Steve nodded but he appreciated being asked. It felt like at SHIELD everyone expected him to be okay with everyone coming near his pup but he still had those instincts ingrained into him that no one - least of all an alpha - should go near his pup without his permission.
He stepped back to avoid another tracksuited thug barrelled towards him only to run headfirst into a wall.
“You owe us,” Marci declared, poking his chest with one perfectly manicured nail. “You never would’ve met him if it wasn’t for us.”
Steve clambered to his feet. Between the alcohol and the adrenaline, he wasn’t exactly steady on his feet and all but fell into Tony’s lap. Tony’s strong arm wrapped around his waist and then his other hand wrapped around Steve’s cock.
To avoid staring at his phone obsessively, wondering if or when Tony Stark would reply, Steve decided to clean the bathroom. Then he needed to take a shower, so it was a good hour before he emerged, instantly eyeing his phone where it sat innocuously on the island.
“I hate you all,” Clint muttered, but he pulled the box of vegetables towards him, stabbing a piece of carrot viciously with a chopstick.
Tony kissed Steve’s temple. “We’re playing poker at the next available opportunity,” he murmured. “No arguments.”
“You heard him, Officer,” Dr. Pym said. “You’ll have to wait outside. She’s still unconscious,” she added when he looked like he might protest. “When she wakes up, we’ll let you know.”
“Are you okay?” Steve demanded, surging upwards, cupping Tony’s face in his hands. “Tony, are you okay?”
Steve blinked at him. Then the next thing Tony knew, Steve was kissing him, stealing his breath and leaving him weak at the knees.
“Don’t let it get around,” Pym smiled. “Who knows? Maybe over time, we’ll find we have something else in common.”
“This is completely unnecessary, I don’t need to be here,” Hogan insisted. “So thank you doctor, but I’m ready to go.”
And Tony turned to leave, but something held him back from walking out. Holding on to the door handle, he turned back to Clint.
Steve mourned the loss of Tony’s body weight on top of him, comforting himself with the reminder that hopefully very soon, and once they were away from any potential prying eyes, he could have Tony on top of him once more.
Leaving the lab, he jogged down the stairs to the communal level, heading down into the conference room where Natasha and Clint had been holed up since the Connecticut raid, trying to crack the Maggia’s code.
Tony’s morning started with a picture from Steve, a sleepy selfie of him holding a Pumpkin Spice Latte with the message
“I know how to take care of people. Well, that’s not true,” he corrected, “But I know how to take care of myself and I just do what I’d do if it was me.”
Coulson turned and stared out of the window. As much as Tony wanted to push him for an answer, he knew better.
“I have to believe that he won’t,” Steve nodded. “But I also have to prepare for the fact that he might.”
Tony watched Clint stare back at him. Then Clint spat in his chest, leaving bloody residue all over Ivan’s pristine white tracksuit. Tony winced at the force of the slap that earned Clint, but instead of crying out, Clint just started to laugh.
“Take a break,” Bucky ordered. “It’s Christmas. It’s a holiday. So take a holiday. We’re clutching at straws anyway. Go see Steve, or come out for drinks with us tonight.”
“Jesus.” Steve sat down, wincing as he crossed his legs, but remained firmly out of stabbing range. “And you’ve been here ever since?”
Opening his closet, Steve found his urbex backpack sitting in the bottom corner, resting on top of his steel toe-capped boots where he’d dumped them a year ago when he unpacked. It still contained everything he needed for exploring; cut-resistant gloves, bump cap, safety glasses and a dust mask, and a first aid kit. All of which he’d invested in after one too many incidents which landed him in the ER, and Bucky insisted that Steve needed to be more careful. Steve resisted at first, but then his mom agreed with Bucky and Steve caved instantly.
“Steve, if he hadn’t kept you out of the media for almost a year and this had happened when you first started dating? You would’ve run for the hills and lost the best thing that’s ever happened to you.”
Steve glanced at Scott who was juggling two patients already and Wanda who was assisting Hope, and sighed.
She gave Hogan one final sorry smile then slipped out of the exam room. Guilt tasted like bile in her throat. God, Hogan had planned to propose tonight and instead she’d delivered a death sentence to him. He wanted to spend forever with Pepper, but forever turned out to be six months.
“The plan,” Steve replied, swinging his backpack off of his shoulder, “Is to figure out how the hell I’m going to clean this water. I mean, there are gallons of the stuff. I looked at those water vacuum things, but I don’t think it’s going to be strong enough.”
So he saved her details and closed the tab, feeling better in himself just knowing he’d taken that first, tentative step towards getting help.
The window into the pool was no longer covered in weeds and dirt, but Tony was nowhere in sight. His jaw clenched in determination, Steve began to search, rummaging through the stacks of paper for evidence of the theory which had been formulating in his mind all morning.
(Peggy scolded him for it every time they trained together, usually by flipping him onto the floor.)
But he’d been feeling better recently. Not good, he was still a long way from good, but better. Relaxing a little more. Steve huffed.
“Steve?” a voice murmured. Tony’s voice. Steve smiled. “Honey,” Tony whispered. “I gotta go. My flight leaves in ninety minutes. I’ll see you when I get back.”
“Bucky and Tony turned up and, I guess, I may have been losing until Bucky got rid of the guy,” Steve admitted grudgingly. “Tony took me back to the Tower to clean me up and… we fought.”
Natasha returned her smile before ducking out of the room. One of the pitfalls of working in the ER was the knowledge that as a doctor, she rarely got to see the end of a patient’s story. But something told her that Happy Hogan was going to be one she followed. This was one story that she wanted to have a happy ending.
Ellie wriggled, trying to get down off of Arnie’s knee. Steve lifted her down, pulling her toys out of the diaper bag and watching as she settled down, trying to fit the plastic shapes into the right hole. A tiny pout appeared on her face when the star wouldn’t go into the triangle, one that looked exactly like Tony’s expression when something wasn’t working in the workshop.
“Sure you are. If you want to talk about how fine you are, I’m going to drop off these samples to the lab and then I’ll be back.”
Before he could try to figure out what that meant, a window shattered and something large and green fell into the room.
“Oh, good. I was starting to worry about my memory for a second there. Uh, why did you hire me a new PA?”
“I’m never going to get used to this,” Tony declared. “You, your mouth, Jesus, fuck, that’s so good.”
“Oh” Steve glanced down, as though he’d forgotten what he was wearing. “Yeah, that. Well, with you and Clint missing and the rest of the Avengers looking for you, Pepper’s Meet the Heroes event couldn’t exactly go ahead as planned. So I improvised.”
Tony inhaled sharply, glancing between Steve’s wrist and his face. Hope flickered in his eyes, like he was afraid to believe that this was really happening.
Realising he was still clinging to Tony, Steve pulled back. They shared an awkward look then without a word, Tony helped Steve towards the shallow end and the steps, falling back when Steve’s feet reached the bottom of the pool.
God, Steve would never get used to this. To the feelings filling him up, bubbling through his veins every time he touched Tony. He grinned into Tony’s hip.
“I… We lost contact,” Steve shook his head. “I tried to find her. She disappeared. I don’t know where she is.”
Pepper nodded slowly. “Thank you. And thanks for everything you’ve done tonight. I really appreciate it.”
shouldn’t tell in public unless I want to get into trouble. Not that I’m worried. I’m friends with three of the best lawyers in the city.”
Sharon tried and failed to swallow the lump in her throat. She had to let go of Natasha’s hands to wave them in front of her face in a vain attempt to stave off her tears.
“No, sorry,” Bucky replied. Natasha and Bruce also replied negatively. “Why? What’s up?” Bucky asked.
Steve’s hands waved in the air for a second before his mind caught up with what was happening. Wrapping his arms around her waist, he stepped closer, feeling her cloth-covered legs wrap around his waist. Fighting the urge to squirm, Steve deepened the kiss, pressing her back into the desk and slipping a hand below her shirt.
Steve tugged him in, feeling an urgent need to be closer to Tony, the sooner the better. “Tony,” he murmured between kisses. “I want you.”
Steve, always so shrewd, seeing through Tony’s bluster and faux casualness. God, Tony loved him so much.
“If I was going to kill you, don’t you think I would’ve done it after you passed out when we were in bed together? And trust me, I’m not the one you have to worry about stabbing you.”
“Her sire,” Steve nodded. “I want her to have a life outside of this Tower but once the press catch wind, they’re going to start digging. He deserves to know from me not from some reporter or a news article.”
you know all the best lawyers." He took a sip of tea. "And for the record? That’s a joke. I’m not interested in your money.”
Tony groaned, pushing forward, licking his way into Steve’s mouth. His hands cradled Steve’s face, and the fire in his belly left Steve flushed and shaking.
They separated slowly, both with red eyes. Steve cleared his throat, flicking away a stray tear, before pulling his keychain from his pocket. With a heavy heart, he worked his key free from the ring and held it out silently.
“This house was designed by Howard Stark,” Steve reminded himself. “Don’t think logically. If the door’s not here, then it must be on the other side, and the other side is… Library. You’re not that much of a cliché, are you, Howard? Are you?”
When she opened her eyes, movement caught her eye in the waiting room. Bruce was hovering behind Frigga Borson, who was trying to feed the vending machine what looked like a fifty. Clint must’ve foisted her off on Bruce, which was… fair enough. If Bruce was going to be a doctor, one of the most valuable lessons he needed to learn was how to diplomatically deal with very rich hypochondriacs and there were none richer or bigger hypochondriacs than the Borsons.
“Let me just…” Sharon frantically began tidying the desk, slipping the USB from its port as she lifted the newspaper. Steve had no idea where she put it, but it vanished from her hand. “Again, Mr Stane, I am so very sorry about this. Steve?”“Right,” Steve nodded and they hurried towards the door.
“You have pizza breath,” he complained. “I’m not kissing you again until you’ve brushed your teeth.”
Jogging down the stairs, Steve let himself into the pump room and searched until he found the pressure gauge in question. He baulked when he saw how high the pressure was.
Steve fished for an answer but came up empty. He gave Stane an awkward smile and shrugged, praying they could leave it at that. Stane gave a satisfied smirk, as though Steve’s silence gave him all the answer he needed.
“I hate you all,” Tony declared. “Do you think we should be worried about Matt?” he asked, nodding across the table at Matt and Bucky, who were yet to surface for air. “I mean, Bucky’s got an increased lung capacity that Matt just can’t match. How are we going to explain it to 911? He passed out after making out with Captain America?”
He fished for his phone, finding it under the pillow on the other side of the bed and scrolling through his new notifications. First on his list to check was his chat with Steve, because Steve was always at the forefront of his mind.
“No, it’s not,” Jessica insisted. “It’s the same pain. In my back, in my stomach. Fuck, it’s killing me,” she hissed.
“Tracksuit Mafia. Bunch of Russian gangsters. They used to own the building until I won it off of them in a poker game. Well, sort of. I had to buy them out to get the deeds. I told you about Lucky defending me from them. That’s how he lost his eye, remember?”
Tony paused. Then he turned to Steve, and Steve could see the exact moment Tony decided to engage rather than just walking away. The voice in his head tried to tell him this was a bad idea.
Tony watched him with blown pupils, some sort of reverence in his expression. It would’ve made Steve squirm with discomfort if it wasn’t for the wonder and disbelief in there too. Instead, Tony’s eyes held him captive.
“Detach yourself from Cap’s face for five minutes,” Foggy said. “We’re setting up an online dating profile for Tony.”
Natasha stepped into the waiting room, taking a moment to study Frigga Borson’s vacant expression before crossing the room.
Before he knew what he was doing, Steve had reached down and taken himself in hand. A ridiculously short time later, he came to the thought of blue scales and mismatched eyes.
Which turned into two, then three, then Tony snaked his hand around Steve’s waist again until Steve pulled back.
“Hi, Mr Nelson?” Steve smiled. Did his voice sound weird? Or had it always sounded like that? “Come on in.”“Thank you,” Foggy Nelson replied, shaking Steve’s hand. “Mr Rogers, I presume?”
“Can’t believe you’ve been together twelve years and I’m still doing your Christmas shopping,” Steve sighed.
“Because it’s my birthday,” Tony replied, as though that explained everything. Steve chuckled, pulling out what had become his chair on Tony’s left and taking a seat.
When Steve climbed the steps to the Stark Mansion the next morning, he found Tony perched on the edge of the pool outside, leaning back and soaking up the sunlight.
Sharon showed surprising zeal towards the whole plan. “I think she wanted to be a spy,” Rhodey mused.
He looked up at Pepper and she gave him a look filled with pride and love, leaning over to kiss his forehead.
The car was empty when Tony found it; Happy was no doubt being held for questioning too. Tony would apologise later. Throwing the car into gear, he floored the accelerator and raced towards the city.
Because he loved Tony more than anything, but Steve wanted to be more than just Tony Stark’s boyfriend. He just didn’t know if that was possible.
Steve’s heart sank. All he wanted to do was go back to the apartment, curl up in bed and sleep off his adrenalin hangover. Scratch that, he wanted to take a proper shower and then curl up in bed to sleep off his adrenalin hangover.
“Are we doing debrief now or can it wait until we’re all at least semiconscious?” he asked as the rest of the team divested themselves of their weapons and armour.
Steve was asleep. Or he should be, until Tony and his stupid idea to call Steve woke him. What an idiot.
“No, that’s not- I never asked for this,” Tony hissed. “Any of it. I never asked to be taken away, or for my family to abandon me. To be made human. To be hurt or abandoned. I never wanted this.”
“It’s okay if I come back to the tower with you, right?” Steve asked, looking up from his guitar when Tony emerged from the bathroom.
Tony was a natural on the stand, but Steve could see that, by the end of his testimony, the mask was starting to slip. Tony didn’t sleep well again the night before, and Steve wished he could stand up and say
“Have any of you heard from Tony? JARVIS said he went to Clint’s place in Bed-Stuy two hours ago and he’s not picking up.”
“And don’t forget: we were together for over a year,” he continued. “I know all your secrets. Do you really want to risk it?”
Taking Steve by the hips, Tony pushed him back and Steve felt the familiar thrill at the strength hidden below Tony’s deceptive physique. He loved how strong Tony was - especially when he put that strength to good use in the bedroom.
“Not everything. You want to take everything from me that I didn’t have to work for? Fine. But I’ll still have my suit, and I’ll still have Steve. So you can take every last dime; I’ll still be the richest man in the world.”
“How long to go?” Sharon asked, hurrying to his side. They stared at the progress bar: only four fifths done.
And if Tony thought to himself that figuring out how to have sex quietly when there was a kid in the house might be good practise for the future, well. That was his little secret.
But the artist was good, Steve realised. Howard and Maria Stark looked exactly like they did in any of the photos he’d seen over the years. So it made sense that Tony would also be painted accurately. Except it didn’t, because that looked like…
A knock echoed from the door; Steve opened it to find Tony waiting, far too bright-eyed for this time of day, with a coffee in one hand and a bunch of sunflowers in the other.
“Yeah, maybe,” Tony snapped. “Or maybe we’re going to take down your Stormtroopers using that control panel over there then take down you and your men, one by one, and then I’m going to make you watch as I take down your organisation until there’s nothing left.”
Within minutes, his lingering exhaustion was gone, replaced by fascination at this world so alien from anything he’d ever experienced before. Captivated, he watched an auction of the one boat’s catch with no clue what the auctioneer was saying, his voice echoing off the concrete floor over the beeping of forklifts and the chatter of buyers and sellers.
Tony was a light sleeper, so when the bedroom door opened, he blinked through the darkness at the small figure in the doorway.
“No,” Zoey shook her head stubbornly. Then she yawned again. “Maybe a little,” she admitted, before Steve or Tony could call her on it.
The buzzer blared, making Steve wince when it aggravated his throbbing head, as he poured tea into a travel mug.
“That’s because you’re a little funny,” Johnny replied. From his expression, Sharon surmised it was an automatic response; for a second, Johnny looked worried, before relaxing when Peter chuckled and reached for his hand.
“Alright, let’s head home, fire up those bugs and see what we’ve got,” Bucky declared. “Well, you fire up the bugs,” he told Tony, “Then go get laid, and we’ll see what we’ve got.”
But he didn’t want to. He wanted Tony but he couldn’t have Tony, because Tony wasn’t interested in being anything other than his friend.
They delved into research - or, more accurately, Rhodey delved into research and Steve supplied him with snacks and sodas - and confirmed that, on paper at least, Tony was the CEO of Stark Industries and a majority shareholder.
“And you want to date me?” Tony asked quietly. Nervously, Steve realised. Tony Stark was worried about what Steve thought of him?
Clint shuddered. “Why do y’all think my paperwork’s actually done?” Phil Coulson, head of the day shift was an amazing doctor, a mild-mannered man, and utterly terrifying in his defence of his shift and his staff.
“Shit.” Steve glanced around, but where was the best place to hide? If it was other explorers, he’d probably be fine, but it could be someone looking for a safe place to sleep, or worse: security. He was frozen by indecision, but then Tony made the decision for him, lunging out of the water, grabbing Steve by the ankle and hauling him into the pool. Steve reemerged above the surface spluttering. Meeting Tony’s eyes, he took a gulp of air, filling his lungs, then let Tony pull him underwater.
He hesitated for a moment, his fingers sitting on the keys, the cursor blinking expectantly at him. Then he slowly typed
He’d never really lived with anyone else. He had a roommate in the dorms at college, but he found himself a girlfriend two months in and all but moved in with her, leaving the room to Tony. Then he’d roomed with Rhodey, but they were ships passing in the night most of the time, each muttering to themselves about their respective coursework before collapsing into bed. The last few days, staying in Brooklyn with Steve and Angie, it was nice. Which sounded boring and twee, but it really was nice. The apartment was warm and homey and Tony felt like he belonged when he was there.
