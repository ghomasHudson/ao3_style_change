Castiel considered the possibility for a few seconds. He wanted to help Dean find a brother, and free him from Alastair, and perhaps doing it by illegal means was not a bad idea.
Castiel could smell the scent of fear that came from the Omega, and he was displeased not being able to figure out what to do to make him feel more comfortable and safe.
Pero Castiel dejó la bandeja sobre la cama, con dos platos sobre ella. Regresó a la cocina y regresó con la olla donde tenía la sopa humeante.
Within seconds, the Alpha was by his side. He approached too fast, wanting to reassure the Omega by holding his body, but the surprising and invasive touch scared Dean, who screamed in panic.
Alastair had shown him his cage and taught him rules and regulations, and the penalties for noncompliance. At first it had been difficult, over the years it had become easier, but even so he was still a bad Omega, he had many things to learn.
He settled himself on a yellow wooden bench, facing a large plate of pancakes and a cup of black coffee filled to the brim.
After the interminable meeting, all the omegas continued walking together, towards an internal courtyard.
He watched the house looking for a way out and without realizing his gaze stopped at the door of the bathroom. He remember that he had already been there, he had a vague memory about it.
"Okay, it's your choice and I won't object to that," she agreed, then looked back at him, her gaze more intense. "I hope you're doing the right thing."
Castiel gathered up his things and headed with the other passengers to the exit. But it was difficult to be a person in a hurry among so many slow people, who walked two steps for hours and seemed to be in no rush, so without preamble Castiel began to ask permission and push those who did not move, and Charlie passed him apologizing and saying it was an emergency.
"Castiel ..." Charlie called out to him and he turned to face her. She wiped away the tears with the back of her hand. "What happened next? How did the Omega end up at your house?" She asked curiously.
Dean smiled, amused. The exchange between these two amused him and made him forget his situation. The brand on his arm worried him. He was a tagged Omega now, and he knew that society despised tagged Omegas even more than regular Omegas. They were more susceptible to mistreatment and sexual assault, no one considered them worthy of respect because they had been able to flee and abandon their Alpha.
"That's perfect!" Castiel smiled excitedly, squeezing the Omega's hands tightly. They hadn't let go of each other, and neither seemed interested in doing so. "Do you want to go to the bathroom or have something to eat?" Castiel asked nervously.
"Who do you think you are to tell me what I can and can't do?!" The Alpha roared, already very angry.
Usually on days like this there was a better chance that Alastair's bar would fill up with customers, and that led to Dean having to go help him. He hated those days.
"Dean, I helped you bathe and heal your wounds. That was several hours ago, if I wanted to hurt you, don't you think I would have done it?" He asked, widening his blue eyes and moving his hands in tune.
He dragged a couple of steps towards his car blue but before they could get too close, others came to help Dean.
Al atardecer, los clientes se habían ido. El gerente de Omega cerró la tienda. Muchos Alfas habían entrado durante la tarde, pero nadie se había acercado a donde estaba Dean, y eso de alguna manera lo alivió. El gerente le dijo que podía pasar la noche en este lugar mientras estaba encerrado. Dean estaba agradecido. Mañana, con energía renovada, podría continuar su camino. Tenía que encontrar a su hermano.
He crawled across the bed and placed his hands on the knees of his alpha, without pressing but just touching him, watching his trembling hands while begging on his knees so he wouldn't call the System.
The Alpha crossed the distance that separated him from the Omega in two steps, and knelt beside him, placing a hand on his forehead to feel the temperature.
“We’re going to mark you and then you can go to your cell. Unfortunately, lunch has already been made today, but tomorrow you can eat together with the other Omegas, and if you are lucky in a few days you can return to your Alpha. ”
And there were some. An Omega sitting on the floor next to his Alpha, who was in the chair. Another Omega standing against a wall, head bowed.
Dean watched as he walked away to his desk in the corner and sat behind the laptop that he opened and turned on.
"You don't have to hit him! He has not resisted! ” Castiel screamed, but to no avail, the two men continued to beat Dean until he was hugging his own body on the ground, his sobs barely audible amid the yells of the others.
He stepped closer and sat him on the sofa. Trying to avoid placing his hands on his ribs he lifted him until the Omega was standing and began to guide him to the bathroom.
Castiel pressed his arms against her body. And he remembered that that was a typical Dean posture. Many times she had seen him doing it, those days he was at home, he did it when he felt fear, when he felt vulnerable, just like Castiel felt now. Terrified of not being able to do anything to fulfill his promise.
Castiel had sat on the edge of the bed, and as he talked with Dean his fingers played with the sheet. He hoped Dean would have said something, but the Omega did not make any comments, he was too scared to speak. If this Alpha decided to use it, there was nothing he could do, he was alone in his house, his true Alpha was who knows how many kilometers away. No one could help you, if someone really wanted to help an Omega.
Castiel realized that he ate fast, but not because of hunger, but because he was afraid that it would be taken from him. With each bite he took, he looked at Castiel before bringing the fork to his mouth, like a silent question of whether the alpha agreed with him eating.
Now, in his cell, Dean ran his finger over the record on his hand, number 5743 was still there, to remind him where he was.
Charlie didn't take long to cut off the call, and Castiel paced the house at lightning speed gathering more things. Random clothing, shoes, your documents, credit cards, passport, and anything else you found that you found useful. Then I check to make sure everything is closed and left the apartment.
Dean obeyed without questioning, wrapping the blanket that still retained its heat around his body, and bent his legs until he had them against his body, so he could rest his head on them.
Hi everyone! I have returned with more! We continue from Cas's point of view for now, but soon we will have much more of Dean;) I wanted to tell you that for this chapter I had a special help with the language, as you know I do not use fluent English, but I think that in this chapter you will notice positive changes .
"It is a vegetable and chicken lasagna" he revealed, unable to hide the emotions that filled him whenever he talked about his dishes. He had been very happy while working in the kitchen of the old restaurant, collecting some money to be independent from his father while studying.
He wanted to warn him so he wouldn't be scared. The last thing they needed was for Dean to be scared and refuse to let Castiel help him.
"How can I help you?" He asked from the other side of the room, but even with the distance his voice resonated and both Charlie and Castiel listened without difficulty.
"Come on, you need to take a warm bath to lower the fever," Castiel told the boy, leading him to the private bathroom.
He smelled the air, looking for some clue about the mood of the alpha in front of him. But it was difficult, this alpha always seemed to be calm, and safe. With the other alphas there were variants: angry, excited, very angry, funny, excited ... they didn't smell safe. Dean had never met alphas that had.
Dean lo miró por un momento. Curioso, intrigado y un poco asustado. Alpha estaba comiendo la misma sopa que él, así que si tenía algo que los hiciera dormir, ambos se quedarían dormidos ... pero tal vez no tenía nada y solo quería demostrárselo a Dean. La idea parecía inusual. ¿Por qué este alfa molestaría tanto? ¿Por Dean? ¿Una segunda categoría Omega?
Dean watched him scared and confused. What were the chances that this Alpha won't try anything with it? Almost none. He was so terrified that he almost wanted him to do it at once, to end the waiting moment. It was like when he wanted Alastair to hit him at once to end the previous fear. He knew the blow and pain was coming, so why wait? The same happened with this Alpha.
Castiel smiled kindly, but did not reply. Instead he walked over to the Omega and wiped away the tears from his cheeks.
He got out of bed and walked slowly behind Castiel to the kitchen, or at least to where the table was, since that apartment was all in one piece.
"You're right, the trouble isn’t worth it," said the Alpha, finally. Dean took a breath, but continued looking at the ground, arms wrapped around his aching body.
Castiel's stomach contracted again. The idea that Alastair was going to hurt Dean made him panic. Every time I thought about it I wanted to get off the plane and run to get there faster. He knew they were moving, but he couldn't help feeling that they weren't moving fast enough.
"He will accept it. And then, you can come back here. ”Castiel looked very excited about the idea, but suddenly caught the scent of the Omega and stopped.
"We’re agents of the System. Open the door or we'll break it down! ” they screamed from outside, and Castiel seemed to realize where he was.
Luego, entró en su apartamento y se dejó caer en el sofá. Quería preparar algo de comer para Dean, tal vez sopa con muchas verduras, pero dormiría un par de horas antes de hacer algo. Necesitaba cargar sus baterías. Algo le decía que cuando se despierte, no será un día fácil.
And the corridor was long, putting distance between the inside of the Official Omegas Facilities and its reception room, which seemed like a four-star hotel in comparison, only gray, and lackluster, where everyone's footsteps echoed.
He wondered where he was, how far he was from Alastair. Maybe far enough, but he doubted that was true.
It was strange, but he trusted him. He knew he shouldn’t do it, one part of his mind was screaming that he shouldn't give in, but another part simply relaxed in the presence of this alpha and it felt good to do so.
Dean said nothing, covered himself even more with the blanket. He was so hungry that he knew the Alpha was listening to the sounds his stomach made. But he didn't move from his place, looking at his bent legs.
And suddenly Dean was caught between the first Alpha and the other omega, neither willing to let go of him. The first Alpha started to scream, but a strong blow hit him on the chin and threw him to the floor. When the Alpha fell, Dean’s eye was hit by the Alpha’s hand accidentally, and he felt a sharp pain and was unable to see. The darkness kept him on his knees still for a few seconds, while he tried to regain control of his body.
"Did you run away from your alpha because he hurt you?" Castiel asked leaving Dean's hands gently on the bed.
"Why are you here?" Dean wanted to know. It was becoming increasingly interesting to him to know about those Omegas, who, like him, had gone through things with their Alphas.
Castiel tried to convince him to lie down on the bed for the night, but there was no way, the Omega refused after the first question, was terrified when Castiel insisted, and huddled in the corner of the sofa when the alpha tried to bring up the subject again. He didn't want to force him, and he didn't know how to make him understand that it was better without it looking like an order. So he  let  it go, the sofa wasn't the worst anyway.
"I understand, but you understand that buying Dean is not just buying an Omega, right? You are going to buy an Omega by legal means, that means that you are going to have to marry him, with papers and everything."
Dean lowered his head again shrinking with the blankets. One part of his mind told him that he had to keep moving, but another asked him to stay.
"It isn't, Charlie. Dean wants to find his brother. And he's so scared of Alphas in general. He even looks me in the eye."
Estaba humeante, caliente y muy rico. Tenía verduras y a Dean no le gustaban mucho, pero después de varios días sin comida, podría haberlas comido crudas.
"Did you run away?" alpha asked but didn't seem accusative or angry. Even his scent was more curious. Attentive.
In spite of everything, he must have fallen asleep. When he opened his eyes, a white light blinded him, and he could not see who had him when two strong hands held him by the arms and dragged him out of the van and to the ground, and then a little more, down a dirt road, scraping his hands and knees.
"I will be with you, and I need you to stay with me," the last words were a silent plea from the Alpha to the Omega, and he nodded silently.
Within seconds of being underwater, the Omega seemed to react, and closed his eyes to open them again, seeming to be aware, again, of where he was.
“Someone from the service station where I found you. The System went looking for you and someone said you had been there. They looked through the security footage and identified me. So they’re coming here. We have very little time to put a plan together. ”Castiel explained, speaking quickly but clearly.
"I ran away, but I repented and wanted to return." he started, stuttering and nervous, but didn't stop. "I wanted to come back right away." Castiel nodded, following the thread. “But I got lost. I didn't know the city ”
Alpha, Alphas in general had stronger odors, and the smell of anger and anger of this one was suffocating him.
Dean woke slowly, feeling the scent of something tasty and a gentle breeze that caressed his face. He stretched his body, feeling comfortable and warm.Even with his eyes closed, he felt with his hands what he had within reach and a soft cloth brushed his hands. He smiled in pleasure, but then another thought went through his mind. That was wrong. He shouldn't feel so comfortable and warm.
PS: I don't know if there is a Harry Potter fan here, but I started writing a Dramione <3 fanfic, but it's in Spanish. If someone is interested I can try to find someone to translate it.
When the sun made its way into the room, Castiel finished preparing breakfast and went to the bed. He gave Dean a friendly smile, trying to sound approachable.
"How do you feel?" he questioned. Dean looked better than when he had arrived, but that didn't mean he looked good. Not at all, he was still too pale, his eye puffy, and he was breathing hard.
Castiel rushed to his feet and the jeans slid carelessly to the floor. He took off the Omega’s shoes and socks and stripped him of all his clothes, to guide him carefully inside the bathtub that was already full.
There, everything was already prepared. One could see a jug with what looked like juice, and some other things that Dean couldn't clearly see from where he was. But that explained why the Alpha had been in so much motion.
They watched them take off their clothes, bathe, and controlled the time. But no Omega was there for over eight minutes, no one seemed willing to see the consequences of that.
Presenting was one of the most important. Bent over bent knees. Well disposed to availability of the Alpha. Never make a lot of noise or complain. Accept what was given to them with happiness.
He seemed to carefully evaluate the proposal and watched Castiel following him from a distance, until he agreed.
Castiel nodded silently. He had never had an omega, but he had already lived with them when he still lived with his father and his brothers, and worked at the family buffet. He knew that omegas said everything was fine, when in fact it was not; it was something they had learned they had to say because it was expected of them, to please their alpha, no matter what they were really feeling .
He went to the kitchen cabinet and found some flu pills, picked up a glass of water and walked over to the bed, but Dean was sleeping soundly. Castiel didn't want to wake him up, he was probably resting for the first time in a long time. And Castiel himself was exhausted. It was already past two in the morning.
Dean stared at him for a few seconds. He looked serious, his brow furrowed, and he pursed his mouth in an unreadable grimace. "I don't understand" he finally said, crestfallen.
“We will say that I found you at the service station in a very bad shape. That you didn't remember what had happened. You got lost and wanted to come back… ”Castiel was speaking and Dean was trying to follow along, but stopped him when he got lost in the thread of the explanation.
"I need you to understand that I did not call the System" Castiel repeated and this time Dean listened to him. He looked up slowly until he was looking into the beautiful eyes of the Alpha in front of him.
This woman, on the other hand, seemed to be much smarter and more demanding than those who had visited him before. Somehow she made him afraid.
The idea sickened him. He still remembered the scars on his palms, the fear, his body trembling at any movement ...
The Alpha opened his mouth to say something, but before anything came out of his mouth, the Omega took Dean by the arm and lifted him off the floor, leading him out of the bathroom.
He crawled across the floor until his back painfully collided with the wardrobe and he covered his face with his hands, feeling his tears soak the fabric of the shirt.
They did not let him speak, explain, or do anything. Ketch, who was a high-grade Alpha in this place, looked at him with disdain and a grimace on his lips.
He stood, looking around and evaluating the possibilities. He ended up getting inside the shed, which was abandoned, with old things inside, and went out through the bottom, to a dirt road that didn't even have houses or people. He walked along way, until he had to divert from that road in order to be inside the city again.
"I am Jacob, I also ran away, but I did not try to return. Just run further" the red-haired Omega introduced himself, showing the three marks of Cain, with some pride.
"Do you want to watch TV?", Offering him the remote, but of course, Dean didn’t even move"There are some very interesting programs playing at this time" he tried again, and when he did not get a reaction, he pressed the ON button and looked for a channel with something that might interest Dean. He stopped at what looked like a romantic movie and left the remote  atop the covers.
"Do you know where you are?" Castiel asked, and that was an easier question, he could answer that without getting into trouble.
Saying this, he gripped Dean's hand tightly and placed a number in ink. It didn't hurt, but it gave Dean the initial scare.
Hello everyone! This is a fairly long chapter, and a little different, it has more emotion and action. Things get complicated for Dean and Cas's side.
"Dean is an Omega ... that ... ah ..." I didn't know how to explain everything to him in a few seconds. There was no way to summarize the last three days in a few words.
Dean wasn't sure what to answer, he didn't know what the Alpha wanted. Letting him in alone or entering with him was the decision of alpha, not his, but he had asked him what Dean wanted.
"That's it, boy. You already have the mark of Cain on you" Ketch smirked, appearing before the Omega's field of vision.
"I’m not hiding anyone. I only gave refuge to an Omega in need… ”Castiel started to say, but nobody seemed to listen to what he was saying.
"Ahm… I went back to the station, I still remembered it and wanted to see that it was okay. B-but it wasn't okay, Charlie, he was feverish and if I left him there he was going to die. I couldn't allow that to happen, he was a person, an Omega, yes, but a person ... "
Castiel left his desk, where he had been working continuously for the last two hours, and approached the omega, and sat at the end of the sofa.
"Cain, this is Dean, the Omega who likes to run away from his Alpha," Ketch explained mockingly, patting the trembling Omega on the back.
"It's the outside hour," Jacob had said when Dean met him again in the crowd. "The best thing about this place, after the meal, of course."
He had no doubts about his decision, maybe a little scared. He felt like he was running toward a cliff without knowing what was below. But something told him it was the right thing, despite the fear and the doubts, that was the right direction.
At school he had been taught that there were different alphas, and the Omega had to be useful and please his alpha in the way that he would like. There were alphas that really did not care for their omegas and Donatello was not one of them. Since he had arrived at the house he had told him where he should sleep, where he should eat and when he should do it.
"This Omega doesn't work here, he doesn't wear a collar, he doesn't have an Alpha ... what can bother anyone if I claim him?" shout the first Alpha, hysterically.
Dean continuó abrazando su cuerpo, sintiendo su aliento caliente. Cuando el Alfa volvió a acercarse, dio un pequeño salto en su lugar y contuvo el aliento.
Dean se descubrió lentamente, consciente de que el Alfa lo estaba controlando, extendió su mano hacia la cuchara y la arrastró por el plato hasta que se cargó con sopa. Luego se llevó la cuchara a la boca y sorbió de miedo. Pero era muy rico, aunque ya un poco frío, todavía podía sentir el sabor.
Dean had remained on the ground, trembling, tasting the iron of the blood in his mouth, whispering apologies;but when he heard the man say that he would call the System to pick him up, he drew strength from his fear, crawled until he was kneeling before the unknown Alpha, begging for him not to do that.
Dean ignored him; he wouldn't fall for his games. He knew how it worked, the System officials were always provoking, waiting for the Omegas to say or do something wrong, so that they’d be able to lock them up for longer, to have them under their control and their disposition.
Before he could do anything, the second Alpha, crouched urgently by his side. Dean reacted immediately and instinctively backed away toward the closest wall.
"Leave it, don't mess, Roger,"the young woman with the Alpha intervened. She smelled soft as a beta, and looked just as carefree as the betas Dean knew, and she didn't wear a collar.
Castiel for his part tried to distract himself with a program on television, but it was a slow and boring plot that ended up convincing him to turn off the monitor and remove his headphones. He tried to focus his attention on the magazine he had to read on the trip, but the only article that caught his attention was one titled "How to make your Omegas tame" and the options ranged from horrible to negligible. Between allowing Omegas access to the nest twice a week; or when you punish him make him understand why you are punishing him; and even buy him something he likes to eat once a month, creating a routine ... and so for the worse.
"Dude, I'm not surprised you did. You did the right thing." Charlie encouraged him, placing a hand on his shoulder, and squeezing gently to cheer him up.
There was a long silence, and Castiel chose to continue working on the wound. He wiped it with a clear liquid to clean it, it was not very deep and would be fine with time. Then, he applied the red disinfectant and luckily it was painless.
Dean tried very carefully and he almost succeeded, but he let out an uncontrolled scream at the end, unable to bear it any longer.
Only one thing was sure, he could not let Dean return to his alpha, although he had no idea how to prevent this from happening.
Castiel hurried to grab it again, this time concentrating on not shaking as much, an almost impossible task.
Dean revealed and continued after a few seconds "first I walked for hours, then I got into the luggage compartment of a bus and when I knew they were about to stop I jumped. I kept walking for days, I think" he wasn't really sure of the time, it seemed more like months "and then I got in the trunk of a truck, but I fell asleep and the alpha owner discovered me and threw me out. I stayed on the road and walked back to the service station where you found me ..." Dean concluded his story.
He didn't realize that Castiel had approached until he was in front of him. The Alpha placed a tray on the bed, with bread on the side, and a plate with soup in the center. It was steaming and looked great.
"That's not going to happen, Charlie" Castiel said, looking up to see her "I'm going to marry Dean and if later he wants to go with his brother we will solve it. We will cross that bridge when we get to him, now I am going to get Dean from the clutches of Alastair, once and for all. "
He was dizzy, the taxi was two steps and braking, and already felt the stomach move in his body. He was sure he was going to throw up at any moment.
Charlie put his bags on the floor next to him, where he helped him sit down, and stopped to look at him.
Many Alphas did not consider it necessary to dress them, give them a decent life ... they felt like vomiting just thinking that Alastair could be in that category.
He did not want to challenge this alpha, he did not want to make him call the System or get hit, but the weight of that truth was stronger than everything. The man judged him as if he knew him when they had actually been together for less than 24 hours. Alastair had had twelve years to make him a good Omega and still had problems with that.
"Shut up, Jacob," reprimanded the Omega who was nearest to Dean. "My name is Héctor" he gave him a kind smile and he seemed sincere.
"Get up, it's time for the Section" someone shouted from someplace Dean couldn't see, but all the Omegas got up, stopping what they were doing.
He rarely left the house. Sometimes to run errands, but these tasks were usually done with Alastair, who took him to the shops and waited for him, making sure Dean wouldn't spend more than he should. Which he never did. He bought only what was strictly necessary for the house or for his Alpha. Nothing else.
Dean still remembered that when he moved in with his first Alpha it was because a Social Worker directed him to the best Alpha possible, and after a few days he visited them to ask them questions, mainly about whether Dean was being satisfactory for his Alpha or if he wanted to change him for someone else.
Dean raised his head stunned. He had no idea that he had distanced himself so much and that way. He didn't know where he was going or where he intended to go. I was far from Alastair, but maybe it wasn't enough. Maybe it never would be.
The man, an Alpha from what Castiel could feel in his scent, raised an eyebrow and adjusted his perfect suit.
Castiel was resting his head in his hands, bent forward on the uncomfortable and hard waiting bench when Charlie arrived.
He spent the rest of the time enjoying the wind and the clouds. He looked at them longingly, and tried to find some with familiar shapes. He could swear he could see one forming a car and a gun, but when he asked Héctor, he said that he could see nothing.
"Thank you very much." Charlie waved goodbye, and approached Castiel, handed him the sheet and the two left the System facilities. Castiel pushed by Charlie.
How long would it take from the meal until the System will arrive? One hour, two? His mind was going to a thousand thoughts, trying to find a way out. But there was only one option.
"An Omega, huh ... no Alpha, no collar ... you lost, baby?" he asked, entering the tiny space and dangerously approaching Dean, who looked down at his feet as he backed up a few steps until his back hit the wall.
"I'll help you get to the bathroom, then you can do it alone, what do you think?" Castiel offered and Dean didn't know what to do. He couldn't challenge the alpha, he owned the place, he had given him food, he couldn't deny him anything. He was an alpha.
Dean clenched his jaw. He knew there was nothing more to do, so begging wouldn’t change anything. And he was not going to do it, he was not going to crawl to the satisfaction of this group of people, who enjoyed watching an Omega suffer.
The Omega looked up and his gaze landed on the plate, and Castiel could see those green eyes that had fascinated him so much since he had first seen him.
With that idea in mind a knot formed in his stomach and he could not continue eating. The price could be very expensive.
"Lo siento, Dean, no quise asustarte ..." Dean escuchó sin estar seguro de lo que estaba escuchando. Los alfas no se disculparon nunca.
I hear Charlie speak but I wasn't sure what he said. And when he was considering moving around to think about getting out of this car she picked him up by the arm and helped him down.
"You see, my friend is very interested in that Omega, and he is interested in buying it. I was wondering if he could provide me with some contact from Dean's Alpha, in order to be able to do business. I suppose the System does not oppose this type of transaction" Charlie said. He gave a friendly smile and an intense look and the Alpha sat back, somewhat uncomfortable.
"Please, please, Alpha ..." Dean twisted forcefully in the arms of the Betas holding him, but he could do nothing to free himself from their grasp. Without preamble, they dragged him closer to the table, and forcefully supported your right arm over it.
Dean was talking to Hector about one of the cooking classes he had had at the System School when he was still being admitted to the System, many years before, when a strong blow hit his ribs.
Dean ‘s memory trip was cut short the moment a dull thump brought him to reality. To that cold, dark cell he was in now.
"My name is Castiel," the Alpha offered with a slight smile. "I helped you at the service station when that Alpha tried ..." Castiel let the sentence die in the air, looking like he struggled with the words.
He carefully lifted a hand from under the blankets and extended it to the gel tube, but before holding it he looked up to watch as the Alpha continued to move in the kitchen, focused on something. He doubted whether he should grab it or not, but he had supposedly left it there for Dean, although it could always be a trap. Alastair did much of that. He asked him if he was hungry and when Dean said yes, he left him without eating for hours. Over time he had learned to always say no.
He left the one he had and grabbed the blue tube with white letters and after opening it, he placed a little on his fingers, also the smallest amount, and applied it to his ribs, under the shirt, without actually lifting it. It was not refreshing or relaxing, but when he touched the injured skin he felt waves of pain scattering across his body and clenched his teeth so he wouldn't protest loudly. When he had enough, he used the excess cream left on his fingers and applied it to his left cheekbone, it was not much but it was certainly more than he could use.
"I'm ready to earn my food, Alpha," he whispered. He knew that sooner or later he had to pay, so it would be better if it was now.
She approached him sweetly."I know, dear. That's why we'll leave it here. But leave it alone. It hasn't stolen anything."
When the Omega was restrained on the floor, without any sign of moving or crying,  one of the System officials bent down and grabbed him by the arm. He lifted him up with the force of someone lifting a very heavy piece of furniture and dragged him to the entrance of the apartment.
Dean watched him go to the kitchen and watched as he washed the dishes and partly panicked. He should be doing that, that is the task of the Omegas, not the alphas, but he was not an Omega of this alpha, so he was not sure how he should behave.
"I made pancakes, and orange cake. This juice is orange, it has vitamin C that will help you with the flu ..." Castiel was pointing things out while he explaining what they were.
Dean was shaking, he didn't want to be hurt, but he also didn't want other Omegas to get hurt because of him. He knew that many Omegas were authorized to work, with permission granted by their Alphas and the System, and some places hired them. Restaurants, shops, service stations - places where the politics of the place protected Omegas or where they believed they could be good officials serving Alphas and betas.
His first alpha, Donatello, didn't care what Dean was doing, but he had his hours to eat. Twice a day, and there were never questions about what he wanted. Dean knew what he had to do and when. He knew when to prepare dinner and when he had to clean and when he had to present. Things had been quite simple with Donatello, he could say he was lucky to have him as his first alpha.
"This is very good for bruises" Castiel smiled reassuringly as he spoke, "You can put it on your ribs and eye."
I bring you more a chapter. We are slowly getting closer to the Great Moment! I am eager to see how this story is taking shape, before it was just a vague idea in my mind and now it has 7 chapters. Is incredible!
"Dean," he tasted his name as if he was trying something unfamiliar. "Another escaped Omega. Aren't those bastards tired of making us work? ” he spat and released a file, which surely contained the Omega's information.
"We'll come up with a plan." Charlie took the paper from him and put it in his backpack. "Rest your head, you're very white. Did you eat something?" She asked, but Castiel didn't seem to hear her.
El alfa se detuvo cuando Dean giró la cabeza y la apoyó sobre las rodillas dobladas. Castiel quería saber, necesitaba saber más para ayudarlo, pero no quería presionar. Y aparentemente la conversación había terminado.
When his flight was announced Charlie already had his ticket purchased and the two walked towards the boarding area. The afternoon chill greeted them as they emerged from inside the air-conditioned building. The wind shook his clothes, and Castiel tightened his jacket as they stripped away the distance with the plane.
He held the gel and opened it, extracted as little as possible and applied it to his feet. They were swollen and very sore, but Castiel was right, the green gel had a strange sedative and relaxing power. In seconds he began to feel that he could move his feet without much pain, which was a relief.
Then Dean caught the smell, it smelled like an Alpha. It was strong, like all Alphas, but not as strong as his own Alpha’s scent always seemed. He could distinguish the aroma of herbs and wild flowers. It wasn't sweet at all, but it somehow gave him peace of mind.
When Dean arrived at a service station located on the edge of a small town, the sun was rising on the horizon.
Castiel took a small first aid box out of the closet. He would start with what looked uglier: the left eye.
"Wouldn't it be better if you did it illegally?" I consult, somewhat hesitant. "I know, man, I know", he quickly added when he saw Castiel's gaze "we are people of the law, lawyers and we act under divine justice, but in this case maybe doing it by other means maybe is the best thing. Just think with me ... we look for that Alisatar ... "
With trembling fingers he lifted the shirt he was wearing, which was not his, it would be the alpha’s, something that made him even more nervous. He was wearing clothes of an alpha, that was wrong everywhere.
For a moment Dean thought he saw a face, and it took him a while to realize who he was remembering. Castiel.
Was he older, or maybe around Dean's age? Dean wanted to evaluate it, but from where he was, with his arm still in the grip of the other, he could hardly do more than look at the floor.
The Omega cried as his mind was racing, thinking how close he had come to finding his brother. Now he would never know how old he was, where he lived, what he liked to eat ...
He made sure to close the containers tightly and covered himself with the blanket again, and placed the right side of his face on his legs, wrapping his arms around his bent legs.
Dean looked at the Alpha, then at the soup and repeated the process two more times, without lifting his face much from his crestfallen position.
“The Alpha found me at the service station and brought me to his house. I didn’t know where it was. I told him where my Alpha was from and who I was. And he promised to help me get home. ”
He closed his eyes in pain, totally disoriented with what had happened. These days away from Alastair had made him let his guard down and not be expecting blows from all sides.
Castiel got up and walked over to Dean. It was then that he realized that his feeling that something was wrong was actually correct.
"Déjame calentarlo" el Alfa apareció de la nada, parado a su lado y agarrando el plato, y Dean entró en pánico. Era una trampa, él lo supo todo el tiempo.
Dean also stopped, staring in horror at the man. His Alpha scent permeated everything; he didn’t smell angry, but excited and alcoholic – which might be worse. He appeared to be in his thirties, and he wore elegant clothes; not a suit and tie, but still, an outfit that seemed very expensive.
And then the one Dean liked the least. Kneeling on the floor, head down, hands on legs, waiting for the punishment they surely deserved.
"Somebody shut up that crazy man, please" the other Alpha shouted. Two security men appeared and threatened to approach Castiel, but Charlie acted quickly and stopped them.
For a moment everything was clear. Or  something at least. Sammy was Dean's brother, and apparently who the Omega was so desperate to find.
He looked down, still with his hand on Dean's shoulder, and while his mind was spinning , his eyes looked at the floor.
When he was presented to a manager, a certain Ketch with an unbearable tone of voice and an arrogant attitude, Dean tried to put  the plan he had made with Castiel into practice, but he had spent hours in that small cage, in motion, he was hungry and cold, and he barely managed to open his mouth before a huge guard hit him again with the black baton.
"He should be made to go back to his Alpha to be punished ..." The Alpha was still loud, but he already seemed calmer and the scent of his anger was diminishing.
Castile nodded in agreement and walked for what seemed like a block to where the man was sitting. And Charlie followed closely, looking around at everything.
This time Dean did not protest being in bed. He let himself be carried  and fell onto the bed, covering it almost completely. He still smelled scared, but at least not with as much as when he wasn't feeling so bad.
Castiel guided Dean to the bed where he covered him up to the neck with blankets, without the omega complaining at all, and he put a wet cloth on his forehead to lower the fever.
He knew he had to keep moving away from Alastair, although no distance was far enough. He wanted to go as far as he could to make sure Alastair could never found him. He knew that the Omegas System would have been advised of his escape, would be searching, and would not be kind to him if they found him. He didn't even want to think about that. He preferred to die than to have to go back to the system or his Alpha. If that happened, he knew there was no chance he would be able to keep his promise to Sammy, and that was even worse than death.
Who could assure you that when they found Dean's brother, Dean would not want to go with his brother? Maybe he was an Omega who had a good family and could go with them. Or maybe he was a Beta and could take care of Dean ...
He heard a sweet voice."Calm down, just breathe," it said. It was peaceful, as if it wanted to help him.
Dinner was quick, after the first five minutes when  Dean seemed to doubt if he should eat or not, he just looked at the plate  and, out of the corner of his eye, at the alpha sitting at the small table but then he devoured his meal, finally seeming to give up. And the lasagna didn't last long on the plate once the Omega was dedicated to it.
Dean thought she was trying to help him, but he wasn't sure. Just in case, he was still in his place on his knees, hoping the beta could convince the Alpha.
"Dean, I have to tell you something, but it's not good. It's not a good thing," the Alpha whispered, in a confidential tone, almost as if he was apologizing.
"Castiel," he whispered to no one in particular, but he wanted to feel what that Alpha's name sounded like on his lips, even if it was for the last time.
He kept quiet, breathing as little as possible. He counted to seventy-three until the van got moving. He felt it in his body and stomach, and his emotions seized him. He was going to make it, he was further every minute. He would be able to stay away from Alastair forever.
"Perfect, love, come on!" the beta said. She pulled a bottle of water and a wrapped sandwich from the backseat and left it next to Dean."Be careful," she whispered.
"Charlie, I need you to accompany me on a trip, it is urgent. I promise to tell you everything on the way" he explained, stopping in the middle of the apartment.
He resumed the preparation of dinner and every now and then he would glance at Dean, aware that Dean was watching him when he thought Castiel was distracted. But the alpha kept an eye on him, waiting for any reaction from the Omega. But he didn't get any, he just realized that Dean only really paid attention to him, since he only looked up to see him, and at no time did he watch the movie.
I know it took me a while to come back, but so many things have happened, that it has been a bit difficult for me to catch up with history. But I'm still working on it :) I hope you like this chapter and the sense it is taking. There are still many things to develop, and I intend to do so.
When he was done he sat down in his seat and watched Dean, waiting for him to eat, but the Omega was hoping he would permit it.
Castiel tried to sleep but was unsuccessful, and when it finally seemed that tiredness was going to overcome his thoughts, the arrival of his flight at the Kansas City airport was announced, which reassured him and made him even more nervous.
I hope you like it, and if you want to leave your comments about what you think will happen :) I love reading them.
There was an escaped omega on his sofa. And that was not what terrified him, he was very happy to be able to help Dean, but the fact that they would soon discover them, would discover the Omega and the alpha that had hidden him, and there was no way to explain that without sounding bad in front of the authorities.
"That is a long way. I wandered that far? ” Dean was suspicious of the plan, he knew that the people from the System were going to be thorough with the interrogation, and that they would not stop until they got something out of him.
After the activity, all the Omegas lined up for the bathroom. They entered in tens and had eight minutes to undress and bathe, in front of the others, each in a shower.
"If you feel good about doing it I think it would be a good idea" he didn't mean to force him, but he knew that moving would do him good.
Dean barely looked up to see him and then, when he realized that the Alpha was looking at him, quickly dropped his eyes again.
Dean opened his eyes but saw nothing but darkness. Everything around him was dark, and as he moved he felt a sharp tug in his neck. He realized that it was because he had fallen asleep in a strange position, his body folded in a weird way, leaning against the wall, and his head had lolled to the side at a strange angle. It had resulted in  the cramped muscles and pain.
The ringtones were endless, it seemed like hours and not seconds, until Charlie finally answered his cell phone.
Dean wrapped the sheets tighter around himself, wanting to protect himself from the world, and Castiel, who had remained standing in the middle of the room watching him, seemed to remember where he was. He snapped back to reality and crossed the distance that separated him from Dean. In quick steps, he reached  the Omega.
But Dean refused to fall for it. He would not do it. He knew what happened next, he was sure that the soup had something to make him sleep, and use it, or worse, call the System. The Alpha would report a lost Omega, they would punish him and mark him as they mark the Omegas fleeing their Alphas. He would not find his brother and Alastair would make his life a hell, more than usually.
Castiel woke up suddenly, disoriented. As soon as he opened his eyes he felt that something was wrong, and he remembered Dean, who had to be on the sofa.
He hid,in alleys and backyards that no one frequented, until he reached an end-of-way service station. When he looked down the road, he saw nothing, but knew it was dangerous for him to stay there. He hid behind a demolished building and watched as cars came and went. Many of the Alphas or betas drove in, left their vehicles, and entered the store to buy something. Dean had an idea, as crazy as the one that had made him get into the trunk of a bus a few days ago, but it was his best chance now. He had to keep putting distance between him and Alastair. He could get into a car, in the trunk, and head for some other city.
His chest was rising and falling, quicker and quicker, as he tried to move his body away from the Alpha’s hands.
The cheekbone under his left eye was still very swollen and an ugly pink, he hardly saw with that eye. His hair was sloppy and strands fell everywhere, without any sense.
It was a huge building, it took up an entire block. It was separated from the sidewalk by a long flight of stairs. Seen with the naked eye it looked like a hotel, but if you paid a little attention you should realize that it was not.
He knew he would never forget him. But everything that had come with that Alpha seemed so distant now. Including his promise. Who takes such a risk for an Omega? Why had he done something like that? Dean couldn't understand it.
His knees had buckled, but he had not touched the ground but was hanging from the Betas' arms. He would have wanted to stare them down, to challenge the two Alphas, but all he could do at the moment was focus on continuing to breathe.
She had been unable to speak to Dean, and was beginning to understand that she most likely would not succeed.
"Dean ..." Castiel started to move closer, but seeing Dean tense in place, he stayed where he was. "You don't have to offer anything. I did this for you because I wanted to. I don't expect anything in return."
"Charlie, wait ..." Castiel tried to call because he was sure they shouldn't be entering a hotel. They had sold to find Dean and were to find him. Why wasn't he with Dean?
He hurriedly put the food to his mouth. It was a cake with something, nothing very extraordinary, not even tasty, but at least it was something to eat. And he was starving.
Then they would go to their cells until the following day, when they would get pick up for breakfast. It wasn't a bad routine, Dean could really adapt to it.
It stopped abruptly because the loudspeaker announced something, and several people started moving. It was not his flight, but he stopped to watch those people grab their luggage and walk briskly toward the plane.
"How are you going to do that? I'm Alastair’s. ” Dean uncovered the mating mark on his shoulder for Castiel to see. A clear sign that he already had an Alpha, and one that wouldn't let go of him easy.
In that big room there was everything, like in a normal and well equipped house. There was the Alpha’s room, which was just where Dean was, a little higher than the rest. There was the bed where he was curled up, a thick wooden wardrobe and a bedside table next to the bed. A large window covered two walls. Window was in the bedroom and in the kitche. It was really very colorful and modern. The furniture was not normal furniture, but seemed original, like those that Dean saw in the magazines that his first Alpha used to collect.
"I'm very sorry, but you can't. It's the rules. You should go" his tone of voice hinted that he didn't really feel anything.
"Dean ..." Castiel returned and realized he didn't know Dean's last name. But it was not necessary because the perfect man did not seem to need more information.
"When they found us," hee explained, "They took me because I was an Omega. And I never saw him again." His voice cracked, and Castiel wanted to run to hug him, to hold him in his arms, but he held himself back, using all his strength. He knew that would not be appropriate at all, other than that it would only scare Dean.
Then there was the head-down pose and standing next to the Alpha while he was eating. Without uttering a word, or looking. He had to wait for Alpha's reaction to the food and if necessary be ready for orders.
In reality Dean had not yet overcome his fear that at any moment he would ask him for something in exchange for everything he had been giving him. And the list was long, so that possibility terrified him. He couldn't say no to an Alpha.
He nodded slightly and in seconds the Alpha was at his side, carefully wrapping his arm around his back, taking care not to touch his ribs.
Castiel ran his hand over his forehead, trying to erase that moment that had hurt him so much to see.
Then Castiel realized that Charlie knew nothing. He hadn't told her about Dean, how he had found him, how he had been living the past few days with an Omega who had fled his Alpha.
“We will, I promise we will. Once you’ll be  here, away from the System, and away from Alastair, I will help you find your brother. We will do it together. I promise. ”
Dean didn't grab it. He knew it had just been opened, so it probably wasn't poisoned, but he really believed he wasn't capable of actually moving just then. His whole body was shaking.
"No" Dean retorted shaking his head. He wasn't hurt, the scars were just a reminder that he was a bad Omega.
Trying to avoid the stream of thoughts Dean did his thing in the bathroom, but before leaving he stopped in front of the mirror and looked at himself. It was a few seconds but they were enough to realize how bad it looked.
"You don't know, you don't know!" Dean shouted as he stood up and staggered away.Until he got tangled up in the living room’s rug and fell onto the sofa. "You are not an Omega. You don't know anything about being an Omega and the System.” He whimpered, covering his face with his hands.
"I know," Castiel replied, looking calm. "I'm not going to claim you, that's not why I brought you to my house."
To Dean's surprise it really was a breakfast; a huge room with long tables, and many Omegas that were entering the place and occupying the seats. Dean followed his cellmates to a table and sat next to a scrawny Omega and facing another dark-haired Omega who kept staring at him all the time.
He rubbed his palm with his thumb, unconsciously. Skimming over all the scars from that place. It was a bitter pain which helped him focus on reality.
"Your Alpha is a bad Alpha, but I'm pretty sure you're not a bad Omega," Castiel said, using his alpha voice. He was strong and determined, and somehow made Dean tremble, but he trembled in a good way.
The Omega was trembling, and this time not out of fear, but because he was cold. Even covered with all the blankets, his body was still shaking, tremors running through it.
Dean nodded, but hurriedly added a "yes" because he remembered that alphas liked the omegas to answer their questions verbally and not with nodding.
"Okay, buddy, this is the moment you explain to me what's happened" Charlie sentenced, sitting next to him and dropping his heavy backpack on the ground.
The Omega tried to turn around again, he wanted to see Castiel again, afraid it would be the last time, but this time a blow to the stomach made him bend in half, and he almost fell to the ground, to his knees. He only hadn't because the Beta officer was still holding him very tightly.
"You ran away, you wanted to go back. Right away, that's important. But you were in another city, you didn't know, you got lost, you wandered until you reached the service station. ” Castiel repeated.
The hour in the sun offered no sun at all. It was a gray and rainy day. Clouds piled up in the sky, as if fighting to be the first to turn to rain.  And their clothes flapped in the cold wind before the storm.
"You are still weak, you must eat something ... I am preparing a vegetable soup to feed you, you will feel much better later," the Alpha commented smelling nervous and worried.
At the same time, he couldn't stop thinking about his cellmates. Despite not being in a better situation he felt sorry for Héctor, it was clear that his Alpha had not planned to come collect him  early, just as Jacob had saidl, but he also felt sorry for Jacob, who had no Alpha or a home to return to.
"Dean, I'm going to find you. Don't give up ... Dean!" It was Castiel screaming, but a System officer prevented him from approaching.
And I would also like to thank Arianllyn who very kindly offered to edit the translation of chapters 1 and 2 that had not gone through that yet. Thank you very much, you contributed your grain of sand to make this story possible.
"You shouldn't have tried to go back. You should have kept going, we are not slaves to anyone. Even the Alphas" the red haired boy screeched.
And besides, his mind kept going back to how he had been ripped from his home and pushed into that truck.
Dean had never fled before, had never been to the Official Omega System Facility before, but he knew what they were like. When they had first found him they had taken him to the Official Installations of Colleges of the Omega System. And they were the same as here.
He drank only a little water and saved the rest. He could see nothing on the horizon and it might take hours to get somewhere where he could get more.
He had taken many hits from Alastair, and kept  quiet, because that was his Alpha and he could do whatever he wanted with his Omega. And because Dean surely deserved them for being a bad Omega, or careless, or sloppy, or all of the above, but he would never accept it from another Omega.
It was what he did. He waited a few seconds, but he was nervous about keeping the Alpha waiting. But this Alpha did not smell upset or angry. Castiel still smelled as tranquil  as before.
He ran down the route to get to the airport to find out that there were no flights leaving within four hours for Kansas City, which made him even more nervous. By the time he arrived in the city, Dean had probably already arrived, had already been introduced to the System, and was already one more Omega among many others. And even worse, he was closer to getting back with Alastair.
"It doesn't matter. He is a pimple on everyone's ass. He’s only here to annoy everyone and nobody stops him" Jacob continued.
Dean might not want to live with Castiel, despite the fact that he had said that if he wanted to, but Castiel knew that it could be due to the heat of the moment ... but he also knew that he could not protect Dean if they were not married under the law. Alastair could claim him as his Alpha again, and the law stated that the Alpha married to Dean was Alastair.
"Is this who you're looking for?" Castiel asked, kneeling in front of Dean, and holding his knees. The Omega was staring off into the distance.
Castiel took off the plaid shirt the Omega was wearing and dropped it to the side, he had to wash all the boy's clothes.
Dean's heart was pounding in his chest. Instinct told him to run away, but he smelled the Alpha next to him, it was safe, and despite being so nervous, he still felt like he was in the best place in the world.
He didn’t really  know if he should trust the alpha, just as he didn’t know what he was agreeing to. He didn't understand why an Alpha, who apparently had enough money to buy an Omega, wanted him.
"I want to help you get better, but I can't do it if I don't know what hurts," Castiel continued from his place, he seemed very calm and patient, but in his voice Dean heard some restlessness.
Well, I've been missing, but let you know I'm still working on this story! One more chapter, which I hope you enjoy! I await your comments! I love :D
"Don't get your hopes up rookie, it's only an hour," Jacob replied, without taking his eyes off the sky.
Suddenly a scent  of Alpha approached, it was soft, but Dean felt worried. And then followed a blue-eyed Alpha who appeared before Dean. He wore a white apron over  black jeans and a blue shirt.
But the other's appearance said everything, something that brought a pleasant smile to Dean’s face. At least until something hit him on the back of the neck with a dull thump.
He felt bad, he was cold, but he knew that it had nothing to do with his body, but with what he was feeling. With the nerves of losing Dean and never seeing him again, of not being able to do anything to help him, of being late, of not being able to avoid him returning with his damn Alpha…
Another Social Worker went to Alastair's house years later. And both times he was lucky, his Alphas were satisfied and did not want to return him, which was a relief for Dean at those times.
Dean slid to the ground and closed his eyes. He had no idea what time it was or how long he had been in that place. Or what was worse, how long he would still have to be in that place.
Dean wanted to turn around to see who it was, already sure it was Castiel, but with a strong tug on his arm they returned him to his path.
"What is the name of the Omega?" He questioned, calm, like someone who just got up and has all the time in the world.
“Dean, you can't run away. Not anymore. If you leave now, you won't get far. And it will be worse.” Castiel explained, he sounded soft and composed, but he smelled so afflicted.
He smiled at that idea. That would be his weapon against Alastair now. Nothing he’d to him would knock him down anymore because he had those sweet and cute memories.
Then I look away to look out the window. At least that way I could see how they passed over the clouds, and how they were eliminating distance towards Dean.
He felt like he was going to pass out. His legs didn't seem to support his body. He was hungry, cold, and in pain. He wanted to crawl to somewhere warm. Almost without thinking an idea invaded his mind. Castiel's bed, and he is appearing before his eyes with a tray of food. But instead it was Ketch who appeared.
He was finishing placing small bandages over the wound when he heard the omega's voice again. Hoarse and almost so low that Castiel wasn't sure he heard it well.
"Dean?" The alpha tried to call him, but even though the Omega had his eyes open and seemed to be looking at him, he didn't really seem to see him. "Dean, we’re going to have to go to the bathroom, I’m going to pick you up, alright?"
Castiel almost smiled at the irony of that. He didn't go out or invite many friends until he brought a stranger home.
"Should we go find a hotel to stay or ..." Charlie started but Castiel stopped her as she went out into the street to stop a taxi.
He hugged his legs to his chest, feeling his breath slow down. He closed his eyes, he didn't want to see the dark interior of this wooden cage. He didn't want to hear the sound of the vehicle's engine taking him to hell. He didn't want to hear Castel's screams on the other side of the door promising something he couldn't keep.
As a precaution, he moved away from the road, behind the trees. He didn't want to try his luck again. He had no idea where he was, or even what day it was. He tried to keep out of sight as he walked.
What he had expected to be few hours turned out to be many, and it seemed to extend endlessly. Dean had no way of really knowing how many hours had passed - 3, 6, 10? But it felt like an eternity in there. His body ached again, his ribs shouted at every hole in the road the van passed over, and his arms and legs were stiff from being in the same position for far too long. He wanted to get out, and stay still, although he was sure he would still feel the rattle of the van several days later. He was dizzy, nauseous; it seemed like he was going to vomit at any moment, except for the fact that he had nothing in his stomach to bring back up.
"Yes, of course" Castiel guided him along the path, helping him with the step that separated the room from the rest of the house and helped him settle on the couch.
"He has the mark. Did you run away, boy?" Another inquired, and this time Dean insisted on opening his eyes to see who was speaking.
"Are you running away from your Alpha, Omega?" Theman held Dean by the collar of his jacket. Before Dean could react, he was slapped in the face so hard that it sent him to the ground.
"Are you going to call them?" Dean asked again without giving credit to what he heard. It could be a trap, he could be lying. The alphas lied a lot.
"You can use this, it is a very relaxing and refreshing Aloe gel ..." he handed the gel tube but Dean made no move to grab it, instead he stared at the Alpha, startled by how enthusiastic he was, trying to help him stared at the energy that the Alpha put into it. As if he really cared.
Dean reached out and grabbed the bottle. He tried to open it and close it again. But in the end he ended up sipping the water. I was so thirsty. He didn't remember when it had been the last time he had drunk water, or eaten something, and it felt like years ago.
He uncovering his shoulder to show Alastair's bite. It was a scar that didn't look old, but recent, thanks to the fact that Alastair used to renew it every two years to reaffirm his ownership. He did not like the brand to fade over time.
When Castiel spoke, he knew that his voice was cutting off and that more tears were coming to his eyes, but he also knew that it was something impossible to make him stop, so he took a breath and continued:
And then Cain put the hot metal down on his skin, on his right forearm, slowly enough that every moment of that metal's contact with the skin was extremely painful.
Unconsciously his gaze wandered to the couch in front of the big TV. It was not ideal for an Omega but it was better than being in an alpha’s bed.
It's not like he had an interest in being out there, anyway. It was ugly, dark and wet anywhere in the System Facility. There were screams from the detained Omegas, and from angry officials.
Dean nodded They were going back to bed but he didn't like that idea. He felt uncomfortable being in the bed of an alpha, that was not right at all.
Castiel left it casually on the couch when he realized that Dean was not going to grab it with his hands. Beside that tube he placed another blue one, with a rare name in white letters.
He looked around trying to find some Omega. He didn't know why he suddenly felt that need. He had never stopped to look for Omegas in the places he was. I saw them, I saw how they treated them, but now I looked for them.
"Sorry ..." said the Alpha, with what seemed like a sincere apology. Dean looked up, confused with his words, but as soon as he saw the blue eyes of the Alpha, he looked down at the floor. He knew he shouldn't look Alphas in the eye. He never learned, Alastair always told him, he was a stupid, slow Omega, that he didn’t retain the things he was taught, and he was always doing something wrong.
"I'm not going anywhere until I talk to Dean ..." Castiel yelled and Charlie tried to calm him down, but to no avail, Castiel broke free of his hands and started to wander around the place, screaming.
He walked across the parking lot, to his car, where he had left it the day he arrived with the Omega.
Dean kept walking almost passively and because the others were pushing him forward, but he had no idea what the Beta was referring to. Until he came to a part of the Center where there were many numbered doors, and there was section 14.
And suddenly he remembered, he had fled his Alpha, had been wandering the roads trying to run away and make it possible to find his brother. None of this comfort made sense.
We continue with Cas now, seeing things from their perspective. This chapter was going to be together with the one, but it seemed to me that it would be very extensive, so I opted to set it apart.
"That's fine. That’s perfect." Castiel smiled but the joy did not reach his eyes, it was like a smile of satisfaction with the plan. And Dean could understand it.
"Don't listen to him. When your Alpha comes looking for you you will be a better Omega" Hector replied.
They drank pure milk and ate toast, maybe a little overdone, but it was more than what he received with Alastair. According to his Alpha, Omegas only ate once a day, and not exactly for breakfast.
"I ran away but wanted to go back, but I got lost and I didn't know how to do it" Dean offered, somewhat doubtfully. He shouldn't lie to the Alphas or the System, but an Alpha, who was kneeling with him on the ground, was telling him that he had to lie.
Almost without thinking, he stood up and charged at Gordon. He shoved him hard and wrapped his arms around his hips, like a hug but not friendly at all. He pushed him as far as he could and punched him hard, with all the force that had been contained all these years, and his fist collided with the Omega's abdomen and then with his face.
"If you call the System, we’ll have to wait here, and it will take hours. We're already late for the congress," she continued, stroking his arm gently, her very sweet face persuading him to do as she advised.
Castiel walked away for a few seconds and returned with ice wrapped in a tablecloth to hand it to the Omega. "You have to press it to your eye and that will make the swelling go down," he explained, handing him the ice, and after a few seconds of doubt, the omega took it and put it in the right place. He leaned his head against the wall and closed his eyes.
"I tried to go back ... but I got lost" Dean repeated, not really knowing why he did it, but those words kept echoing in his mind. And the worst thing is that they were in  the voice of the Alpha Castiel.
It was surely the most comfortable sofa he had ever sat on, and there were some pillows that seemed very soft, but he didn't dare touch them.
