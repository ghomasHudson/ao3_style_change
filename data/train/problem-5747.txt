Tony's new schedule meant that he also attended about half of the Avenger’s training sessions. They weren’t all as entertaining and involved as the first, and the entire team wasn’t always able to attend. The most recent session had been comprised solely of a wrestling match between Thor and Bucky. (Which wasn’t to say it hadn’t been a damn delight to watch; Thor obviously had the edge in the strength department, but Barnes was almost endlessly patient, and sneaky as hell.) After every one, Coulson asked for Tony’s impressions, and he always seemed to actually listen to the answers.
“Want me to get that essential oil thing from your purse? The one with peppermint that you swear helps with the migraines?” Pepper’s eyebrows rose in a brief show of surprise, which made sense; they’d all worked so hard to treat Tony as his own man, entirely separate from his counterpart, that moments like this where he knew things they hadn’t told him were bound to be a bit jarring.
“That’d be great, Tony. The team and the folks at SHIELD do the best they can to maintain everything, but we haven’t honestly made any major improvements to the team’s gear since…well, it’s definitely been a while.” (The pause was unlike Coulson. Another trace of Mark II. Another gap inhabited by his ghost. He sounded like he’d been great and all, but Tony was really starting to hate the guy, which just took self-hatred to a whole new level.) “And even if you're not an active member of the team just now, we should still have you sit in on training more often. You were a huge help during the mission the other day. JARVIS, pull up the Avengers’ master calendar, please?”
“When was this?”
“…sure. Yeah, that’s cool,” Peter agreed. His attempt to save face by sounding indifferent to the idea was thin even to his own ears, but Tony didn’t say a word. So even if Tony grinned a little when he bent back over the workbench, Peter wasn’t going to call him on it.
After days of avoidance, Tony and Phil catch up. Meanwhile, Steve and Pepper talk next steps in the battle with SI.
Instantly, all traces of softness were vanished from Pepper. It was just as ominous as watching Thor summon the thunder, or Natasha produce a weapon from thin air, and Steve reflected that while Rescue was great, Pepper really didn’t need a suit of armour. She was her own suit.
“Shh!” Her reached out to throw a hand over her mouth and then winced, drawing it away as if burned. If waiting for Kamala on her usual route home was a little suspect, trying to cover her mouth was way more so. He was going to have to get some tips from Steve or Coulson when it came to this whole recruiting thing. “Sorry. But seriously, you gotta be quiet, kid. It’s kind of a miracle I got here without tipping off any press.” Kamala nodded, her eyes wide with fear or excitement, or maybe both. Probably both. From everything he’d been able to find out, the kid really did love superheroes.
“I ran out yesterday,” she confessed. “I’ll order more, I just haven’t gotten around to it yet. Tony, you don’t have to—why am I still talking, you’ve definitely ordered it. When should I expect it to arrive?”
None of it had worked. Because Steve himself didn’t want to be down here. It was unbearable to be surrounded by such a dearth of evidence that Tony had been alive so recently—the open holoscreens, the dunce hat he’d left on Dummy that morning, the half-diassembled upgrade to a piece of War Machine’s left shoulder that lay on top of one of the long tables. (Tony would never finish it. Would never complete any more projects, or go to that gala next week on Steve’s arm. Wouldn’t ever fight alongside Steve, or kiss him when the battle was over and both of their systems were still surging with adrenaline. He’d never
There was rather more in that confession than Tony had really intended to say out loud, but it seemed to do the trick. Phil stood and stripped his jeans, socks and underwear off with characteristic efficiency, folding them and leaving them on the side of the bed. Tony watched with no little disinterest. The other man’s thighs were just as phenomenal as the jeans had suggested they were, thick and bunching with muscle as he moved. His cock was long, enough so that Tony could already imagine choking a little as he slid it down his throat. Phil watched Tony watch him with something resembling indulgence, like Tony couldn’t possibly be expected to think of anything except getting Phil’s cock in his mouth at the earliest damn opportunity, and he shuddered with want and a hint of pleasant humiliation at the thought.
“You were supposed to be here two hours ago. I’m starving.” Steve’s smile melted away instantly, replaced with the blend of impatience and guilt that so often seemed to colour his interactions with Peter.
So no, this wasn’t that. Peter would have that life now, would get to do all of those things and so much more; it was just that Tony wouldn’t be there to witness any of it. He’d be just another on the long list of parental and psuedo-parental figures that had come into Peter’s life and then made an abrupt, painful exit. He liked to think he’d still impacted the kid for the better—certainly the money and the shares in SI that Tony had left him would be enough to ensure that even Peter’s great-grandkids would never feel the threat of financial insecurity ever again. But for once in his life, when it had come to Peter, Tony hadn’t just wanted a legacy. He’d wanted a
“I want to believe the best in my Dad, as I imagine any son would,” an uncharacteristically emotional Tony stated. “I know that his relationship with orientation was a complicated one, and that’s of course something I relate to to some degree. But to place that discomfort, or the profit of corporations like Stark Industries, above the public’s health is a violation of the trust that many had in him. It is also not something I could ever knowingly condone or extend, which is why I’m standing in front of you today.”
Which wasn’t to say their time together had been bad. Sure, Tony was a little embarrassed to remember how clingy and needy he’d been that first day, when Bruce and Nat had made good on their plans to coddle him with food and cuddles and soft things. The second day Tony had initially planned to get back to work, but Natasha had had…well, other ideas.
Bruce gives Tony a crash-course on the science of orientation. Steve avoids the Tower, but still can't run away from his new reality.
“I tried to tell them that you were feinting about the bloodwork. But even Pepper was fooled this time.” He pitched his voice high in an imitation that would undoubtedly earn him a smack if Pepper were ever to hear of it. “‘Oh James, he’s just scared, don’t you understand?’ None of ‘em seemed to get that the first thing any version of Tony Stark is gonna do when he’s really scared is gather as much data as he can get his hands on.”
With JARVIS’s rather reluctant help (the AI was definitely another resident of the Tower who was pissed at him, and the team had long since learned that that never boded well given his near-complete control of every aspect of the Tower), Steve tracked Tony down a couple hours later. He was in his…the shop, of course, completing what looked like some heavy-duty upgrades to the War Machine armour.
“Tony?”

This story had lived in my head for so long before I actually did anything with it that I sincerely worried that the experience of actually writing it could never measure up. Your kudos, comments and questions constantly prove me wrong, and make this fic a joy to write. Thank you! And keep those #AskStrange queries coming too, if you're so inclined! This chapter definitely has a lot of opportunities in it for his commentary.
“I’m sorry. If I had known what this was I would never have brought you in on it so soon after Peter.”
“Answer just the question I’m asking you, Tony.” There was a prickling edge to Clint’s tone that suggested he was just barely refraining from allowing his Dominant instincts to surface. It was…provocative, simultaneously tempting Tony both to press his luck and to acquiesce to whatever demands Clint made.
We join Tony and the rest of the team a few days after the last chapter as they work toward building the foundation for a 24/7 relationship.
Tony’s gaze fell back on the Asgardian prince, who stood wet and laughing as the team of emergency responders applauded. The towel that someone tried to drape over him didn’t even span the entire length of his back, but he thanked the man as effusively as if he’d just rescued Thor’s first-born child from certain death.
“Oh, just—well, when I first started trying to fill this out, I called Rhodey in a panic. He sent me to bed with a vibrator and a dream, essentially, and told me to go to town fantasizing about this stuff.” The way Phil choked on his coffee in response to that was entirely too satisfying. Even moreso was the visible struggle that played out on Coulson’s face afterward, like he wanted to take Tony right there and was just barely controlling himself. It was so rare to see Phil anything but smooth and contained, it felt like Tony had cracked some kind of secret code.
Content Notes: Some pretty big feelings in this one, as you likely assumed because it's me, but I don't think any other content notes required. As always, feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns you have before, during, or after reading.
“Captain Rogers. I do apologize, but your presence is required in the penthouse.” He groaned, rolling over onto his stomach. Phil must have been up for some time, because the second Steve was in motion Coulson was on his feet, seeking out a fresh pair of dress pants and a collared shirt while Steve was still blinking away the last remnants of sleep.
“And what’s it like to get that time, especially being reunited with your True Love?”
Natasha had laid out Steve’s old sweater and a pair of soft grey pajama pants. Tony let them dress him with almost disturbing obedience, stepping or raising his arms when he was told without the slightest concern. He was asleep in minutes after his head touched the pillow, one hand still clasping Steve’s. Natasha bracketed him from the other side, and ran her fingers through his damp curls with a shaky breath.
“Sir—”
“I could use the help. And SHIELD did originally ask you to consult, right?” Tony’s smaller, cooler hand finally met Steve’s, and with Herculean effort Steve managed to follow through on shaking it instead of grabbing on with every bit of his enhanced strength and refusing to let go. (Better to be friends than nothing at all.)
Thor, meanwhile, was practically vibrating with ill-concealed excitement. He couldn’t even speak beyond a series of jerky nods that made pretty much everyone laugh fondly. They really couldn’t have picked a more perfect person for Tony to try this little experiment with, Steve mused; Thor’s generosity was as boundless as his enthusiasm, which meant there was pretty much no risk that he’d somehow make Tony feel like he was getting Domination ‘wrong.’ And Steve had yet to see anything Tony couldn’t do with his hands; he’d probably love perfecting the technique involved in Shibari.
Wanda Maximoff was a fatality of what is popularly referred to as the Scarlet War. Her brother, however, survived the conflict and successfully evaded capture at its conclusion.
“How can I be of assistance, Mr. Stark?”
Department of Research and Development, Stark Industries
“I’m sorry, I didn’t, I—” How could Tony begin to apologize for mocking something that was clearly so special to Bruce and to all of them? Let alone begin making up for the fact that he will only ever be able to play at being that man for them?
“Well that’s unfortunate, Clint. Really unfortunate. I do know something about shitty times, as the CEO of a multi-billion dollar corporation. And so does Tony, actually, so I could really use his help with this.”
“No, Sir.” Any other time, that would have been the end of the conversation. Childishly, he wished he could put his hands over his ears in anticipation of what was coming.
Eventually, the sounds of destruction slowed, and then ceased altogether.
“That would be acceptable to us, Captain Rogers.”
The shop was the best place in the world. There was always something incredible happening; Dad would work on new designs for the shield (for when he found Cap), and he’d talk to Tony about vibranium and everything that made it such a unique, unreproduceable substance. Or he’d work on his flying car, which was going to be perfect one day as soon as he stabilized the repulsor technology. Or he’d make new weapons that helped keep kids like Tony safe in their beds at night. Tony liked all of those things, but what he liked most of all was how his Dad was down here: attentive, happy, alive in a way he never really seemed to be anyplace else.
when the Hulk dropped him off in the living room where Coulson was waiting, as promised. To his everlasting credit, Phil didn’t even blink at any of it, not even when Hulk instructed him not to allow Tony to kneel at all that day. Coulson thanked him, polite and calm as ever, and then sent Hulk off to the kitchen where he promised a hefty pile of leftovers from the night before would be up for grabs.
“You are somehow the most sadistic of all of the Doms here, you know that right?”
Thank you all, as always, for your wonderful kudos, questions and comments about this series. I absolutely love hearing from you in all forms!
The days following Tony and Clint’s date were decidedly odd. Coulson dropped out of their work sessions, rarely leaving Rogers’ floor. Which was fine, it wasn’t as if Tony didn’t have plenty to do that didn’t require Phil’s presence, but it seemed entirely unlike Coulson to abandon anything mid-project. And it wasn’t just him; the rest of the tower was filled with a weird kind of tension. The team still made sure to spend plenty of time in the penthouse, but they were all clearly preoccupied with whatever was going on with Cap.
“He knew who I was.” It was the first time anyone had broken the silence in hours, and it was a mark of how distressingly used to this new world order Steve had gotten that he was surprised it was Tony. The man didn’t say much these days; oh he worked, just as obsessively as he had when he’d survived down in the workshop for days on a steady stream of energy bars and caffeine. The joy of discovery and creation that had once driven Tony to babble incessantly for minutes or even hours on end, though? That was long gone. Turned to dust, like everything else. “Thanos.”
“Monophonic.”
It had only been a matter of days. Hell, technically they’d been with Tony for most of the day of the press conference, and for several emotional hours immediately preceding it. But it felt like it had already been weeks since Tony—theirs, forever now—had stepped into the penthouse. His eyes had been red-rimmed and bloodshot, and Steve’s stomach had dropped, preparing for a goodbye he wasn’t sure he would survive a second time.
has been touching War Machine for anything but the most basic maintenance I will pretend to be a ghost and haunt their asses. Jesus Christ is this—what is this tech? It’s not Hammer, I’d know his shit anywhere, but it’s way too close for my liking. JARVIS, get me specs, and a background on whoever made this garbage.” Tony was…well, he was fondling War Machine, there was no way around that. (So sue him. The last few years had been focused entirely on getting War Machine compatible with Rhodey’s new bracers and other changed physical requirements. There’d been zero time for the fun kind of upgrades. And the poor thing had been practically in tatters when Tony had made his rather abrupt departure.) But this shit was honestly beyond the pale. He could tell just from looking at several of the guns affixed to the suit that they were shoddy; one of them looked to have a damn bullet lodged in the barrel. “Squib load? Seriously? This could have taken your damn hand off, Rhodey, Jesus.” Midway through Tony’s muttered complaint/work list, a soft mechanical swish signalled the opening of the shop doors. Somehow he was not all that surprised to find Coulson making his way inside, trailed by Dummy. The latter immediately made himself busy, circling the shop in long loops like a king surveying his territory. Coulson, meanwhile, flicked his gaze back and forth from the suit to Tony several times, then nodded, that decisive, tight motion that had always meant business.
The room was silent except for a soft gasp that came from the direction of Pepper Potts. It came as little surprise to Steve that she was the only one who seemed to realize where this was going. Out of all of them, she and Rhodes were the least self-interested parties in this conversation; much more than trying to maintain particular relationships, they just wanted Tony happy. (Steve wanted that too. Even if it felt like his insides were splintering.)
This project is a coordinated global and multi-institutional effort, designed to follow-up on and extend the work completed in the 1960s under Howard Stark’s supervision.
“I…well, the first time I went in to rescue him.”
“I just…I mean, they just let her on the team, after that?” Cap confirmed. Natasha had, mercifully, changed the subject a few seconds later, but it had taken an entire hour for Rogers’ fists to unclench. And he wasn’t the only one who seemed pissed off, either.
“And this bucket of bolts? How did he end up—he was living with you’n Cap before I got here, yeah?”
The AI that Shuri had running the palace (or rather assisting in its running—she and Tony had had many hours-long debates over the safest and most ethical uses of technology, most of which had ended in one of them flipping the other the finger and then both of them cackling) had announced Talia’s imminent arrival nearly two minutes ago. But he still let her stream-of-conscious babble continue for another thirty or so seconds before making an overdramatic show of jumping up as if startled. Talia glared and flipped every light in the room on; Steve could practically feel his pupils constricting in protest.
to know us. So get your shit together, Rogers.”
Tony was not remotely a fan of this plan. He wore irony and bullshit (and, apparently, the passive voice) like second skins, he couldn’t just…shed them the way Phil was suggesting. He wasn’t a damn snake, and what Phil was asking was much. Except he wasn’t even asking. There had been no hint of a question in his instructions just now, no sense that perhaps this was something Tony couldn’t accomplish.
(Believe me, the ambiguity keeps all of them, but especially Coulson, up at night.)
“Are you telling me you haven’t had an orgasm in weeks because you were waiting on our permission?” Bruce’s voice was taut and strained, and one of his hands clutched the edge of the table like he wasn’t quite sure what it might do if given free rein. Alarmed, Tony shoved his way up backward on the table enough that he could sit up and cross his legs. Maybe it was pointless to try to preserve his modesty now, but the prospect of facing this conversation as exposed as he had been was entirely unappealing.
“In truth I still despise them,” Masdee confessed. “So of course, where does Talia ask to go during our walk today? To meet the royal goats.”
“I really am happy for all of you, Steve,” Domen told him as she folded the note back up with care. That seemed like rather more showmanship than was necessary, but when Steve cocked his head in question…was Domen
“Yessir.” Steve watched carefully as Bruce circled Tony’s hole, pressing gently all around the rim with his gloved index finger. Tony’s hips kept wanting to move, to shove back into Bruce’s touch, but Steve could see he was also working hard to respect Bruce’s ‘no sex in check-ins’ rule (the bane of every sub and Switch that had ever experienced them.)
(See the end of the chapter for
That same feeling he’d found before during the paddling, that release that felt like it liquified Tony’s bones and forced every bit of tension from his muscles, finally took him over. He sagged against the bench, barely feeling the last two blows. The strap fell to the floor, and the team was all smooth motion and soft words, unbuckling Tony and helping him down from the bench while they petted and praised him. His ass was on fire, but the hurt was some kind of beautiful paradox, making Tony untouchable and freer than he’d ever felt.
Actually falling asleep had required hours worth of reading on JARVIS’s part (they’d moved on from JARVIS sharing innocuous world news to his reading Tony a novel the evening prior, and it was working pretty well), but Tony had, eventually, managed it. This meant he was particularly pissed off to be woken what felt like only minutes later by having the covers ripped away, exposing him to the cool night air.
“Okay. Then we should talk about how you think we could handle these cases better.” Just like that, like it was nothing for Tony to walk in and criticize how Steve was running his massive spy agency, and nothing for Steve to offer to change based on that input.
Halfway to the door, Peter remembered that Liz was the captain of the academic decathlon team. He turned around, ready to beg, even to offer to join one of the sports teams even though masking his powers during football or something would be a nightmare, but Principal Morita was already on the phone and having what sounded like an increasingly intense conversation about that year’s budget.
There were things he wondered. Natasha’s contract had felt a lot more conditional than Clint’s; she’d ranked most things toward the middle of the scale rather than as things she strongly enjoyed or did not, for instance. And her rankings didn’t always fit neatly into some of the categories Steve had suggested Tony use to sort things for himself. If contracts told a story, like Clint had said, hers felt harder to read, or like it was maybe telling several different narratives all at the same time. But he didn’t really know how to convey any of those impressions into actual words, so he elected to say nothing.
However, I would posit that this will start to shift in the immediate future due two factors. The first is the increasing visibility of those identifying as un-oriented. The second is the conversations around measures to more effectively balance work and orientation. While I am not an expert in the field, I would posit that when individuals are no longer so starved for orientational interaction at the end of the workday, they will likely be more inclined to consider sexuality outside of those boundaries.
“You’re Tony Stark!” she declared. Tony winced, preparing for one of Steve’s agents to go full-on fan at them. “You must have so many embarrassing stories about my boss. I’m pressed for time, so I’m going to need the top five immediately.” Another woman who seemed to be even better than Bucky or Nat at moving silently (seriously, where had she even come from?) appeared, a look of mingled amusement and exasperation on her face. The expression felt so much like Steve that Tony liked her immediately.
Tony! Given how much time Peter had spent with the man as of late, it shouldn’t have come as quite such a shock to realize that he had someone to call, now, when things got weird. But then, Tony had been pretty deliberate about keeping a careful distance between himself and Spiderman, offering suggestions that often felt more academic than personal. Peter didn’t need his caution or detachment now, though. This blurry-fast dude was going to tear the man in front of Peter apart, and he had no idea how to fight an enemy he could barely see.
“What?”
Also, the portrayal of Christine Everhart is also very much a nod to dixiehellcat's wonderful Wordsmith verse!
Had they been alone, Steve’s stubbornness probably would have had him chasing Peter down immediately. Barnes and Wilson proved to be somewhat stabilizing influences, though, because while he could hear all three of them calling his name from down the hall, no one emerged from the gym fast enough to prevent what Peter did next.
Using a range of philosophical, cultural studies, humanities computing and feminist/critical race scholarship, as well as popular culture case-studies, this course explores the obligations humans and machines hold to one another. Core themes of the course include an exploration of pain and empathy, shared responsibility, and acting within a context. By exploring this topic from such a wide array of directions and perspectives, our aim is to present human-machine interaction not as a singular script or process, but as a dynamic and ongoing relationship shaped by mutual respect, shared goals, and informed decision making.
“That upsets you,” Domen observed.
For now, though, he stood across the kitchen island from Phil Coulson, who was chopping up bell peppers for a salad and making conversation about the latest advances in medical technology. While Agent’s mind wasn’t quite genius-level like Tony or Bruce, Tony had discovered that in addition to his awesome dry wit, the guy had a delightfully eclectic set of interests that made for consistently interesting discussion.
“Shoulda told them. I hear honest communication is important,” Tony advised with a grin. Steve laughed, unable to help himself, and gathered the submissive up and into his arms. Bucky, meanwhile, slithered his way into Phil’s lap, effectively averting Coulson’s reply to Tony while also shielding Phil from glares and follow up questions from the rest of the team. Tony hummed happily and went about the apparently urgent work of trying to press all of himself as close to Steve as he could manage.
The thing is, it hurt because Steve was starting to agree with him. Not that Bruce couldn’t handle this; Steve had been entirely sincere in his confidence that he and Natasha would take Tony through the scene capably. But he wasn’t sure how much longer he could stand being on the outside, watching as the team lead Tony into submission and all that it had to offer. Steve wanted to be there, even for the parts like this that were hard, that hurt.
“Your Dominant asked you a question, buddy. You go tryin’ to play us like that and I don’t got any problem with refreshing your memory on how that spanking felt.”
Voices, one of them very familiar, sounded from down the hallway. There was no real need for Tony to hide—as Pepper herself had said, they hadn’t really fooled anyone by acting aloof toward one another—but instinct had him ducking into the office of an employee he knew was on maternity leave. The conversation between Fletcher and the woman he was with ground to a sudden halt as they both glanced significantly in the direction of Pepper’s office. The woman was as nondescript as they came—blonde, tall, with a pinched expression that had Tony making mental quips about her face having become stuck like that in the wind. But she was familiar, too, and if their conversation couldn’t be had in front of Pepper…
won’t you just—” The second Talia managed to force Masdee to break her attention enough to look directly at her, Steve could tell how much she wished she hadn’t. There was nothing kind or tender in Masdee now, nothing but the cold fury of a woman whose duty to her King and country was being interrupted. Masdee murmured something to Ayo, who nodded gravely and made a quick departure, and then she snapped,
For the first time, Rhodes falters just a little. Peter is almost viciously satisfied by the sight of it.
Peter had seen the armour so many times lately—in his dreams, in street art, in cheesy made-for-TV movies that always got Tony so, so wrong—that it had started to take on a kind of surreal quality. He’d forgotten the way the red and gold gleamed in the light, and how much the harsh lines of the faceplate had somehow come to feel nearly as comforting as looking into Tony’s own face.
“I’m fine,” he said woodenly. “Mr. Stark covered everything, I’m—it’s fine.” It felt odd, after weeks of referring to the man by his first name, to return to the formal title Peter had used while his mentor had been alive. But then, he still was alive, wasn’t he? Just not here, not where Peter needed him, because apparently being needed by a parental figured would be just ‘too much’ for Peter…
“Tony, shut up.” He had snapped out the words without thinking, before even realizing that there might be enough of his Dominance pressed into them to make Tony’s submissive side react. And wouldn’t that be a horrible way to re-encounter his sub after years apart, to start issuing orders that Tony would feel compelled to follow? He was halfway to an apology when Tony answered, apparently unbothered.
Shuri added:
This still sounded somewhat dubious to Tony, but the sheer force of Steve’s Dominance ultimately left little room for real doubt. Tony gave his permission, then focused his attention back on working the too-thin, too-short, not textured enough dildo in his ass.
“Are you kidding? An escape room designed by the Avengers? This is fucking brilliant. Although I hope it gets a little more challenging than sliding a magnet around a piece of glass.” The magnet was even on a table right next to the maze, for goodness sake, had the team no faith at all in he and Clint? Tony held the thing up above the ring, not even bothering to look. It fell to the ground. “What the…” he tried again, this time with a little less ogling of Clint’s biceps and a bit more focus. The magnet hit the floor again. Tony eyed the equipment in the corner with a little more intent. It was everything he would need to safely heat something to—
“Bruce.” Steve stayed far away from his Dominant tones, which could easily have pushed a dropping Dom into further discomfort, but he injected just enough Captain America that it cut through the haze that the other man appeared to be in. “Take a drop kit down to the workshop, or wherever Tony is right now. There are generic ones with the first aid kits in the main bathroom. JARVIS, the emergency override codes haven’t been changed, correct?”
He did briefly consider ordering food after she and Happy finally left. But maybe Steve would want to eat when he got here. Peter didn’t really know what he liked, or even what places would deliver up here.The longer he thought about what should have been a relatively simple decision, the more complex and unachievable it seemed.
“Natasha’s at SHIELD covering for Steve and Phil,” the archer offered immediately, as if Tony would have otherwise expected her presence. Agent produced a box of donuts seemingly from thin air.
In between all of the crabbing, he did actually try to just do the damn homework. It didn’t have to be elaborate, after all, just one damn sentence, one thing Tony genuinely liked about himself. He made and then scribbled out several dick jokes and other glib remarks, one of which resulted in the ink from the fountain pen spattering everywhere. Through it all, Coulson never so much as glanced up except to occasionally peer out at the rolling waves of the ocean. Tony was starting to truly believe there was something superhuman about the guy’s focus.
Tony’s ass was bright red and hot to the touch as Rhodey helped unbuckle him and move him from the bench. It wasn’t even close to the worst of the pain his counterpart had taken, but this man was not that Tony. This was new to him, and probably scary as hell, but he’d come out the other side of it, and the relief in his tears was so clear and so potent that James’ own Dominance was a humming, contended purr in the back of his mind.
“No. Saw a video though. Watched that big metal arm crush my mother’s throat. And then when I went after Barnes for it, Rogers put his shield through my chest and the two of yo-them left me in Siberia to…well, die sounds dramatic, but with a disabled suit in the middle of a Hydra base I’m not sure what else they thought I was going to do.”
“Thanos,” Steve said, “The mad Titan. He was hell bent on destroying our world, along with half the universe, and he had an army, the Chitauri, and many allies capable of doing it.”
Pierce smiled, “Excellent, and ironic. Captain America being destroyed by his best friend, the Winter Soldier.”
“What be-towed?” Zach asked.
Zach was full of energy and bright as a button in the morning.
“Indeed sir, I wonder where he picked up such a trait.” Jarvis said.
There was movement outside of the door, someone was outside of the door!
Tony was in no better shape, his left arm was broken, like Steve he had a bloody nose and lips, his throat was badly bruised and swollen from where Bucky had been strangling him. His left side was bleeding too, some shards of metal had pierced his skin when the suit had caved inwards.
Making Tony witness the brutal deaths of his children, of his family, to hear his family blame him for the deaths. It was a torture beyond anything Steve could imagine. His hatred for Wanda was greater and more intense than he had ever thought possible.
"There is a que." The receptionist said dismissively and Tony nearly launched himself over the desk at her. But thankfully Steve caught him about the waist and held him still.
Taste they approached with the same caution, taking care not to overwhelm Peter’s taste buds and only giving him plain foods at first then gradually increasing flavours and textures.
They stared at each other for several more seconds before both breaking down into laughter. When he finally got himself under control, hand over his stomach Steve breathed heavily, still grinning at Tony.
“Ah, that’s the stuff,” Clint said, getting to his feet and straightening his shirt, “You looking for Tony?” he asked Rogers, “Because he’s not here. He and your really, really big brother have gone to a Gala.”
Tony had created for Zach his very own Tardis. It didn’t work, of course, but the outside was Tardis Blue, it had a light on top that light up, the Police Box sign on the double doors, and the inside had the Tardis console with various levers and buttons that made noises and flashed lights. Zach could go inside and pretend he was flying his own Tardis, and since it was on wheels, it could be easily pushed too and from his bedroom.
“Rogers did his basic training here.” Natasha said, “Its in his file.” At Clint’s blank look she rolled her eyes, the day Clint Barton did the reading was the day the world began to revolve backwards.
Not even his favourite double chocolate fudge brownie sundae with extra whipped cream and caramel syrup was enough to distract him from worrying about his Brother. Instead of gobbling it up as he normally would, he swirled his spoon about in the dish and poked at the brownie pieces.
Like Steve he was dressed in Sam’s sweat pants and a T-Shirt, however, he had to fold over the waist band and roll the legs up to keep from tripping over them, and the T-Shirt looked rather like a mini dress on him it was so long.
“ANTHONY EDWARD STARK!” Pepper shouted making Tony’s reproductive organ shrivel and retreat back inside his body for safety. “What in the name of all that is sane were you doing?”
Peter gulped as he felt eyes upon him and the whispering started again, he was about to try and hide behind Ned when MJ suddenly thumped the wall loudly with her fist,
Thanos fell to his knees with a wounded cry, clutching at his stump, from behind him Thor charged, wielding Strom bringer and sliced off Thanos’ head.
Tony sucked in a sharp breath, “He was a…complicated man, sweetheart. He was very close friends with your Grandfather, my Father. He was a lot older than me, he was also a very big man.”
“Thank God.”
MJ rolled her eyes and leaned forward, lowering her voice even though there was no one but them in the living room. Likewise Peter and Ned leaned forward too.
The image, while amused, was not encouraging when it came to imagining Tony in charge of his personal safety.
Steve went and joined the other avengers around the TV where Clint and Sam were arm wrestling to decide who got to pick the movie of choice while Natasha cat called them and Bruce flipped through a science journal, only Thor was not seated and appeared troubled.
“Absolutely.” The Black Widow said her smile promising broken limbs if Tony tried to leave the bed before Bruce was back with the wheelchair.
When they reached City Hall, Tony moved so he was next to the limo door and gave everyone a reassuring smile which he stretched into a full, white teeth grin as the door opened and he stepped out; being greeted by the scream of fans and the flashing of cameras.
“I haven’t been using the injections since the night Peter got hurt. I needed to use them until my heat, that means we’ve lost this cycle.”
Zach glared at her, “Don’t call me little one.” He snarled at her, “My name is Zach Stark and I want my Mamma, I want my Daddy, I want my Peter, I want them NOW!”
Curien, despite his fear glared at Tony, “It wasn’t karma it was Osborn, Stark, he did this to me.” He gestured to his abdomen and leg, “And you did this.” He pointed to his missing arm, “I should sue you for that.”
“My Friends!” Thor boomed and the entire kitchen froze upon seeing the God with pink foam curlers in his hair, pink nail polish on his nails, and wearing a bright pink velour tracksuit.
“Don’t worry, it does get easier.”
“You are trying to make me prematurely bald, aren’t you? You’ve been trying to do it since college when I found you rewiring the power socket with wet hair and a screw driver between your teeth!”
“Nothing like last night then?”
“What about Maria Hill?” Tony asked, “I thought she was Fury’s right hand.”
Tony held his ground, his chin jutting defiantly at Steve, “There’d have to be competition for me to be scared of first, Captain Tight Ass.”
The teacher opened her mouth to reply but was saved from doing so as a Nurse called out for Tony and Steve.
Natasha leaned forward her eyes narrowed, “Do you?” She asked, “How many have you killed Stark?”
Tony was strong, he’d survived worse than a gun shot, he’d had open heart surgery in a cave for God sakes, been tortured hours after it, had gone through being blown up multiple times, fought a demi God, an alien army, gone into space with a nuke and lived to tell the tale!
“What?” Bruce deadpanned.
Whimpering he tried again, tasting blood at the back of his throat as his body shuddered, the wetness was deeper now and spreading out, Tony could feel it under his chest, under his arms and on his face. He was in a pool of his own blood, was bleeding to death.
Sharon returned with a hot drink for everyone, and took a seat herself.
“A choice Tony.” Killian said, walking towards him. He hardly looked human anymore, his skin was red and glowing, his eyes flames, his hands pulsating with deadly heat as he stalked towards Tony.
“A bit banged up, but he’ll be alright.” Bruce said democratically, in truth neither he nor Happy knew exactly how badly either Tony or Steve were hurt, they could only assume that they were not too seriously injured by the fact that they had not sort medical attention. However, Happy had said that Tony had once nearly severed a couple of toes when he’d been bare foot in the lab and as he’d been too busy to go to the hospital, he’d attempted to patch his foot up with electrical tape and his shirt!
“You’re real big.” Zach said, “And got long hair like Auntie Pep.” He reached out a small hand to touch Thor’s hair which the God allowed seeming delighted by the Pups attention. Peter however only had eyes for Bruce, immediately talking with him about science and Biology, quite startling the Doctor by his enthusiasm and depth of knowledge.
With it all going so well, Peter had decided to make Friday Night his regular patrol night. Of course this meant sneaking out of his bedroom and climbing down the side of the tower, but after the first couple of times he stopped being scared of doing so.
Steve nodded, “He was a very bad man, he didn’t deserve to be bonded to your Mamma, or to have a Pup like Zach.”
After breakfast came the presents, firstly from Rhodey, who sent his love but unfortunately couldn’t get away from his assignment to be there. He’d sent Zach an Ironman and War machine action figures that light up and made the noises like the actual suits did.
“Since Afghanistan.” Tony explained, “Since I was water boarded. I can’t have deep baths or swim. I’m still afraid of deep bodies of water.”
“Bite me Tin Can.” Clint shot back flipping Tony the bird, as he bounced Lily, and blew raspberries at her.
“No.” Tony said, “Steve and I will go in, you guys can wait outside, keep an eye out for danger, don’t engage unless strictly necessary.”
*****
"He'll be okay Tony." Steve said placing a hand on Tony's knee as the Billionaire ignored traffic lights and broke the speed limit, swerving around corners and narrowly avoiding hitting other traffic and pedestrians on the way to the hospital.
Zach giggled and leaned down to whisper in Thor’s ear, “Mamma was gonna say a No no word.”
For once Tony was quite wrong.
Natasha glared at Clint who had the grace to look chastened, “We’ll talk about it later.” Steve mumbled, red faced and embarrassed.
“I like burgers and hot dogs, and pizza.” Thor offered.
Finally he came upon it and with shaking hands opened the door, finding the Doctors wallet, car keys, and mobile phone. He took the phone out and paused, toying with the idea of trying to find which car the Doctor drove, but doubted he’d be able to get behind the wheel and even if he did he was in no condition to drive and there was no way there wouldn’t be some kind of security check when it came to getting out of this shithole.
Rose Hill Tennessee
“Romanoff and Rogers.” Tony snarled, as the assembly bots placed the suit onto him, “They knew about this, and now they’re going to pay.” Before anyone could stop him he was blasting off the landing pad, heading for the compound.
The other side of the Island, as Tony had said was all rocky cliff face with some sand on the top most rocks and view down into the crystal clear water below.
Tony smiled, “Well think about what happens when Stars die. Towards the end of their life they swell up and swallow the closest planets to them, consuming them and all their matter. Then, when they finally produce Iron in their cores they go supernova, all the matter, the atoms, everything gats scattered throughout the galaxy, some of said matter and atoms goes crashing into a nebula and kicks off the whole process of a solar system forming once again. Thus rebirth, reincarnation.”
Tony glowered, “Do you think Matt would defend me for the same crime?”
Tony was dressed in cream suit, with just enough yellow in the shade to keep it from being white, which complimented up his tanned complexion, he wore a black silk shirt with a matching tie and pocket handkerchief. Rather than wearing a rolex, he was wearing his gauntlet bracelets on his wrists so he could call the suit to him if needs must, something he hoped would not happen but was prepared for anyway.
“Beach Mamma, beach time, and pancakes!”
Steve sighed wistfully. He’d give anything to have that in his life, but he knew it could never be. He was lucky to have Tony as his friend, he shouldn’t be wanting more than that, he should be contented at having that much and not wish for anything more.
Steve snickered and shook head as Tony climbed into the sports car and gunned the engine.
“And what are you, but a pathetic little Daddies boy with a big mouth?” MJ snarled,
He could go where he wanted, do what he wanted, eat and sleep what and when he wanted.
“Yep, the evil Witches spell gets broken when you rescue me and Peter and Zach turn back into kids and stop being animals.”
“We’ll talk every day I promise.” Tony said to Zach, ruffling his hair, “We’ll video call and you can tell me everything that you are doing at school, and you can tell me what Dumm-E, Butterfingers, and YOU have been getting up to. Jarvis and Friday are supposed to tell me but they secretly conspire with them, it’s a whole AI union thing, I think they are secretly plotting to take over the world, they are probably programming sentient toasters, microwaves, and fridges in the lab right now and will unleash them on the unsuspecting world, within a few weeks the world will be over run by unstable sentient kitchen ware, there will be war on the streets, people will be bombed with burnt toast, microwavable food, and milk cartons!”
Tony got out of the suit and approached Zach who stepped back fearfully, “Don’t wanna burn you.” He said looking at his glowing hands worriedly.
Half an hour later the tents were finished and everyone was enjoying their ice creams and listening to Zach telling them all about the weird things he’d seen in the rock pools.
Clint’s eyes widened, he hadn’t considered Social Services becoming a problem, but with what had happened, the fact the Peter was in hospital for the second time in almost as many months and had been involved in something so dangerous was bound to raise questions of his and Zach’s safety, especially since Peter was adopted.
“Actually we were going to try and keep the trip there as secret as possible.” Steve said, not imagining that Thor could do covert or quiet, he always seemed to be loud and boisterous.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony would later cheerfully decree that Steve had finally learned the value of making an entrance. Steve would insist it was the sight of Taskmaster tossing the arc reactor from hand to hand like it was nothing more than a mildly entertaining glowing ball that he was juggling that made him unable to wait any longer. Whatever the case, it was that moment when Steve gave the signal to JARVIS, who opened up the armour Steve was wearing and allowed him to step out of it. Taskmaster’s face showed equal parts surprise and rage.
Clint pushed. He found a submissive’s buttons, sometimes ones they didn’t even know they had, and he pressed away at them with what often presented like thoughtless glee. Tony had subbed for the guy enough to know, now, that Clint’s Domination style was actually the farthest thing from thoughtless. He usually enjoyed the challenge of sceneing with Clint, who didn’t seem to fear or regret the darker, sharper edges of Tony the way some of the others did.
“You charge by the minute for these kinds of calls, Rhodey-Bear?”
“Hey, Cap, welcome home.” Tony, previously hidden by the shadows of the setting sun, waved lazily from the kitchen. The first thing that stuck Steve, even before his mind caught up enough to panic at the thought of being alone with this man, was the fact that Tony wasn’t wearing his boots with the lifts in them. Their Tony had barely ever worn the things, but this version had dug them out of the back of the closet on his first full day in the Tower and had practically lived in them ever since. But now here he stood, nearly a full foot shorter than Steve and padding around the kitchen in Steve’s sweater and a pair of soft, worn jeans. He looked truly at home here for the first time, and a vice tightened around Steve’s chest. “Can you fill that?”
Even though I had a version of this scene outlined ages ago, it still kind of broke me to write it.
“Not really. I tend to find that the folks most invested in thinking about corporations as people are the same ones who really want to avoid thinking about people as people. I will admit the benefits are probably better than freelancing though—which is good seeing as it looks like you’ll need ‘em.”
Tony didn’t want to turn the page. He didn’t want to imagine a man he had laughed and joked with just this afternoon in this much pain, and he definitely didn’t want to let himself wonder how Howard still could have ended up feeling so indifferent towards his own son when he’d fought so hard to help bring Tony into the world.
“Eew, no. I don’t want to be up on a stage Steve Jobsing it. Let’s do it in R&D. Pretty much everything that separates the labs into discrete spaces comes down—doors, any walls that aren’t load bearing—we’d be able to squeeze everyone in there without even breaking fire codes. And the work-stations have great talk-to-text functionality for anyone who can’t hear us from where they are.”
“As soon as you get to your floor. Before you even start getting ready for bed,” he confirmed. He’d seen Pepper, overwhelmed on all sides by SI, preparations for funerals and public memorials, plus numerous addresses to the media, on the brink of sub-dep multiple times in the aftermath of Tony’s death. He’d be damned if he let her unravel that way again.
“You’re really gonna chastise me about skimping on food, after all the shit you’ve pulled int he past coupla years?” Bucky could turn vicious when he really wanted to avoid something, and fairly often his efforts to distract Steve by enraging him were successful. Bucky did, after all, know all the right buttons to push to really piss him off. This morning, though, Steve was prepared for it. He pulled the comforter and sheets unceremoniously away from Bucky and tossed a pair of jeans and a worn green henley into his lap. (He ached to be more tender toward his oldest friend, but even though he seemed to have emerged from the soldier’s grasp on his headspace, Bucky still wouldn’t be ready to accept any kind of gentleness yet.)
And then there was Steve. Steve, who was heartbreakingly concerned not with where Tony had come from, but where it might mean he would go.
“Get. Out.” Before, during his breakdown over all that he’d left behind, Tony had at least felt guilty for shutting the team out. And he definitely should have felt something about ejecting them from their own gym given that he doesn’t technically own this version of the Tower. But any excess stores of emotional energy he might have devoted to those ventures were all being burned through, feeding the all-consuming rage that was nearly suffocating him. It was anger like he’d never quite known before, like choking on bile or acid, something that burned on its way up and bubbled and burned at the insides of his mouth and throat. Even Rhodey gave up his attempts to linger after the fourth time Tony barked at him. “J, what did your Tony do when he was pissed and unable or unwilling to leave the Tower?” Truth was, Tony didn’t expect much to come of the request. Wasn’t like Mark 2 had had much to be angry about anyway as far as Tony could see. The guy had had everything: a Thanos-free existence, a public that genuinely seemed to admire him, a team that—
“No, you’re not.” Sam’s voice was kind and even as it always was, and right now Steve sort of hated him for the fact that he could sound this way when the fragile seams keeping Steve’s world together were suddenly unravelling. “All the more reason to ask for help, yeah? Look, man, caring for a teenager is hard at the best of times, and this particular teenager has been through a hell of a lot. I know that the two of you seem to have bonded in the wake of Tony’s death, and it’s great that you’re steppin’ up, but that doesn’t mean you gotta be his only source of support.”
“We’re going on a field trip. Get dressed and meet us on the 27th floor.” In his own world, Tony remembered with a pang, R&D had taken up all the of the floors in the 20s; he’d been considering a hostile takeover of some of the corporate offices on the 30th through 35th floors right before Ultron had rendered the combination of ‘Tony Stark’ and ‘research’ too dirty for even his team to touch.
Dr. Domen’s response to this news was entirely underwhelming. She congratulated Steve, yes, but then she slid her tablet out of her bag and seemed to intent to proceed as usual. No discussion about reducing the schedule, or ending their sessions altogether.
“I’m coming back,” he announced, rising to his feet and seeking out the shield. Talia would have to understand, and if not he could probably figure out a way to leave her with the Wakandans and check in. Whatever else this Tony was, he was still a version of the man Steve loved, the man it had become Steve’s goddamn purpose in life to protect and care for. He’d failed his version of Tony, would never get him back, but that didn’t make his instincts or his heart any less determined to ensure the wellness and safety of this Tony Stark.
know you,” Steve retorted, voice harsh and thick with emotion. “You like almond milk but hate cashew milk because you insist it’s too sweet. Your left hand trembles sometimes, when you’re tired or thinking too hard about the other world, your other team. It always makes you smile to watch the news in the morning, even when the story is something pointless-especially when it's pointless, actually. Somewhere along the line I think you faced starvation, real, actual starvation, because I’ve seen kids with little or no food. I’ve watched how carefully they guard it and how hard it can be for them to share even years after, and you do the same thing sometimes. You resigned yourself to losing your life to save a world that fundamentally didn’t deserve you, and some days it makes you so angry to see how easily it could have gone differently that you can barely look at any of us without clenching your fists. Should I continue?”
“Like it when you watch me,” he confessed, no longer sure he was play-acting at all. “Like the way it feels to have all your focus. I’d do anything to get you to look at me like that, Steve, please, pleasepleaseplease—”
Eventually they stopped fondling Barnes’ welts and continued on with lunch, but the entire encounter left a heated feeling behind in Tony’s stomach. His mind kept fixating on the feel of Clint’s strong, calloused fingers in his own, and the way Barnes had pressed up into their hands despite (or maybe because of?) the obvious pain the touch caused. His own limited experiences with kink had been nothing more substantive than some name-calling and a bit of light spanking, and he’d never had any particular interest in going further with any of it. But now…well, it was hard
“There we go, that’ll help you settle down, hmm?” Steve murmured, leaning down to press a kiss against Tony’s jaw, pairing the gentle gesture with a brutal press of his hips that made Tony yelp and then moan around Thor, who roared and uttered several Asgardian curses in reply. (He was careful, though, Steve noticed, cognizant even now of the need to ensure Tony never felt for even a second like he was choking.)
“Which one? There are no Gods I am aware of specifically concerned with your Midgardian orientations,” Thor interjected. That drew a grin out of everyone in the room, Coulson included.
A small piece of what turned out to be dark chocolate was pressed into Tony’s mouth. It wasn’t just any chocolate, either; it was from a little Canadian chocolatier he’d fallen in love with on a business trip in his twenties. He used to pay to have the stuff imported all the time, but like many of the fun things about being wealthy, that habit had fallen by the wayside as Tony devoted more and more time and resources to cleaning up after the Avengers.
If he’d ever imagined being hungover for the first time around Captain America, Peter definitely would have expected something harsher than the quiet disapproval in his tone. An air horn maybe, or being thrown out of bed at 6:00 am and forced to do chores. Somehow, Peter still couldn’t find it in himself to be grateful.
“I got that doll. You don’t gotta clean up my mess.” Barnes was emptying the dustbin into the trash before he spoke again. “I ain’t gonna apologize for them. It might make me feel better, but it won’t really help you any; just because he was wearing my face don’t make me him. And I’ve done enough in my own universe I gotta atone for. I’m sorry that happened, though. You deserved better, from both of ‘em.”
Steve said what he did next because he had to. Because Bucky had to understand that little Stevie Rogers, the one who could do this all day, get up as many times as he’d been hit, no matter how brutally, had died right alongside their submissive. He didn’t know yet who had taken his place, but if he was to be stripped utterly of the right to hope, he wouldn’t permit the team to imagine he was capable of making it out of this with his soul remotely intact.
Content Notes: In the third response, Phil muses on how the scene with Obie's removal of the arc reactor in IM1 closely resembles a form of sexual assault. (I am, of course, by no means the first person to point this out, but I still wanted to flag it as a potential trigger.) That scene also returns us a little more acutely to the fact that the team still grieves the other Tony.
(See the end of the chapter for
“If it helps, I wasn’t actually in the suit.”
“No, Clint.”
“This was nice, but you should get dressed, Sir. Nat will be down in ten minutes to walk you to therapy.”
He thought about crying off then, because now that seeing Peter and Harley again was such a real and immediate possibility Tony was fucking terrified. The magic, though, seemed not to differentiate between thinking about them and feeling indecisive about actually seeing them, because this particular wave was an onslaught.
“Pepper, I swear—”
Given all the time that Tony had spent trying to avoid getting work done for SI, it was a sick and cruel irony that now that he needed the distraction, he was being shut out.
“I don’t remember, does the Dom or the sub wear white? And what do Switches wear?” Clint mused.
Before he knew it, two days had past, and Tony had barely had time to think about the Dinner at all. He’d been gloriously busy, flitting between suit upgrades (he’d had a breakthrough with Natasha’s that he could hardly wait to show her), after-action reports (Thor wrote the best ones, hilarious and poetic and overwhelmingly sweet)), and more background reading on the SWORD project. Phil was happy to be as involved as Tony wanted on any particular day; sometimes that meant they didn’t see each other until end-of-day check in, and others they spent virtually the whole time together, Coulson completing paperwork in the shop so he could provide feedback on weapon and suit upgrades, or talking Tony through some of the Avenger’s past missions that the reports themselves had trouble capturing.
“Wuss!” Tony called after Jarvis as he exited the hospital room, he then narrowed his eyes at Steve, “What are you smirking at?” He demanded, “And where are my recalcitrant brats, have you sold them to highway men, if so you better have gotten a good price for them, Peter’s worth at least a horse or two!”
“Watch it, you nearly took my eye out! Damnit woman I’ve already lost limbs here, I can’t afford to lose an eye too!”
Coulson appeared in the lift looking unimpressed, “Security breach.” Tony declared.
Steve had no idea and Tony didn’t intend for him to ever find out, not if he could help it, but with these symptoms it was growing increasingly hard to hide.
"Oh my God it's Stark's kid!" another tech wailed, "The boss'll kill us!"
“Okay.” Peter said setting an alarm on his phone and then called Ned to set up the communications.
“Really? Who names their kid Eugene, no wonder he ended up with such a shitty nickname, not like my Petey-pie!”
“What happened sweetheart, why would you get into a fight, are you hurt?” Tony immediately asked, hurrying to Peter’s side and began to check him over for injuries.
“To spy on me.” Steve snapped scowling at the two women in the front of the car.
Once all the presents were open they had breakfast and went to shower and dress for the day. Cooking Christmas dinner had been split into individual jobs, Bruce was in charge of the Turkey, Steve was in charge of the stuffing. Natasha was in charge of the roasted vegetables, Rhodey was in charge of the gravy and other condiments, Tony was in charge of the bacon wrapped sausages, Pepper was in charge of the boiled vegetables, and Happy was in charge of the Christmas pudding.
“It’s a talent.” Tony said happily.
Steve stood up tall and proud, his chin jutting out, “I do not fear the press. I always strive to tell the truth and always shall.”
The skrull bore the pain for several moments before screeching out, “They were taken by surprise.”
“You said she barely knows her name.”
This will sadly deprive Peter and Zach of a “Father figure” which they will naturally have grown close to. The fall out from this failed relationship will no doubt also have a devastating effect on the rest of the Avengers team.
“Drink.” Bruce said, pushing a bottle of water into his hands.
“Not yet, there is another lab I need to get into.” Peter said, “I need to break open the doors, can you cut the alarm?”
Hydra never gave them anything like this and Winter was keen to sample all things that tasted “Good” since escaping.
“No and that will be up to your Mamma.” Pepper replied,
“What do you think of this Mr Stark?”
He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t think. He couldn’t move.
Steve sighed heavily and eventually nodded, “So, no more snowball fights.” He said, “Small steps right?”
“And put it to good use.” Pepper said, “I’m going to have the lawyers pressure the schools to make a decision about Zach and Peter’s future, and demand that they have cast iron reasons for excluding them, and “They are mutants” will not be sufficient.”
It hadn’t been easy, he’d lost a lot of muscle while bed bound and on a liquid only diet, which was thankfully now lifted, although he was still on a strict diet, nothing containing heavy sugar, grease, or starch was to be consumed for a while yet so his body got a chance to heal.
The thing was, he was already insecure about Steve, or rather of his ability to keep Steve’s love. He was brutally aware that he was much older than the super soldier, was rapidly heading into Middle-Age, his body was scarred and battered after Afghanistan, Vanko, the Mandarin, the Avengers. The fact he couldn’t even give Steve a child just made all of his body issues feel so much worse.
Steve joined him and frowned as the images of his face were enlarged. “They’re the same.” He said.
“Because we’ve be around six shops already and you’ve barely glanced at anything.” Pepper replied, “You enthusiasm for what is supposed to be the happiest day of your life is seriously lacking.” She frowned at him, “Are you sick?” She asked looking him over, “You look….” Her eyes widened and she quickly checked to see that there was no around them to over hear what she had to say.
“Tony.” Steve cautioned placing a hand on Tony’s knee.
******
A silence fell and the team regarded each-other trying to gage one another’s opinions before they spoke, “So, you think we should go ahead with this documentary?” Steve asked Pepper.
Orchestral music was playing as Rogers walked into the reception and people were dancing, or standing off to the side, watching the dancers and talking animatedly as they sipped their drinks of choice that were being mixed to order by the bar tenders.
Steve growled low in his throat the rumbling threat of an angered Alpha whose mate is in danger.
“Blenny.” Bruce said, “These are Blenny. You are lucky to see them, they, like the sea scorpion can change their colour so they can camouflage.”
Tony made his way over to Steve and lay himself down besides him, “Thank you for breakfast and for the lay in.”
“No.” MJ said, “So he’s not breeding that kind of stuff for the Military, or at least not the US Military. Anyway the Hybrid stuff isn’t just limited to animals, I found references to human experimentation.”
“He asked for your blessing?” A part of Tony light up at the thought of Steve going to ask Rhodey’s permission to date him.
“I do not see why I must be clothed at all times.” Thor complained looking adorable and ridiculous in the Garfield pyjamas that Darcy had bought him as a gag gift along with fluffy bunny slippers for his feet. It was hilarious to see Thor in such attire, yet he loved it and was proud to wear such “A fine gift from a fair lady.”
Zach using Tony’s favourite caution for Peter made everyone pause for a moment, Tony looked torn between being amused and proud of Zach having started to use this.
“Don’t get cocky,” Steve said, “Thanos will bring an army with him, and have the use of several stones, we need to get the compound and get ready.”
In the end it took the signing of nearly a dozen forms for the Hospital to release Peter into Tony and Steve’s care and be satisfied they wouldn’t get sued if Peter’s health took a turn for the worse.
The rest of the country, were either on Tony’s side, or were remained neutral.
That could not happen until he had investigated Oscorp, and thankfully MJ had gotten back into the systems and found a warehouse for him to infiltrate. While this would not reveal everything, it would make a start on their collecting evidence against Osborn and lead to them bringing the man down for good.
Tony frowned.  “That’s my job.”  Steve shook his head, but his face was crimson.
“What the hell?  What just happened?  Please tell me nobody kissed me.”
was Tony sleeping on a lumpy mattress with Bucky snoring on the next bed over in a crappy motel room on his first sort-of vacation with Steve.
Except . . . who was Theseus’s father, exactly?  Aegeus, or Poseidon?  There were plenty of stories of the godly cuckold, and the products of it were known to claim multiple fathers.  A godly father to bless them in their adventures and a mortal father to leave them a kingdom when questing days were over.  Could it be . . . ?
Tony groaned.
He would have Steve’s attention, and wouldn’t need to sacrifice anything for time with him.
to me.  You’re the paradigm of American virtue, it doesn’t suit you, you shit.  And stop pretending you still get confused by the twenty-first century.”
Tony continues to stare at his fingers.
But then he remembered Steve’s earlier words:
“Against drunkenness.”  He laughs hysterically.  They have to give him something so he doesn’t have a nervous fit at the funeral.
“Stark, we got ‘em.”
“He didn’t want to interrupt us.”
“Why shouldn't they guy let off a little steam?”  He slung an arm around Rogers’s ridiculously broad shoulders, who promptly slung it off.
He fiddled with the radio.  “This is Captain Rogers.  Do you read me?”
“Why wouldn’t I want to know you?”
Curious, he stands and fishes the comm set from the mass of metal and tech. Voice message from Captain America, level three urgency.
It took me forever to find time to watch the movie to lift the dialogue, then I did like half the movie, then found a website with like everything already written.  *bangs head on table*
“So did!  Why we didn’t do it before is beyond me.  Look, look, look!” he forcefully shoved the box at Rhodey, and they all settled on the couches and chairs to look.
Steve slid the tablet onto the bedside table and scooted down so they were at eye level.  He tucked his arms under the side of his head, so adorable that Tony had to physically restrain himself from asking
a forge, like food and drink and sleep and air.  He needed the fire burning and metal heating and the echoing clang of a hammer in his hand.  It was the only way he stayed sane in Athens.
“Actually, yes.”
He liked to cuddle, to curl up in the warmth of another, but the people who occupied his bed in the olden days were not those who he could laze about with, and now there was no one he was taking to bed for that to even happen.
There were worse deaths, he supposed. The acrid tarry smoke making everything blurry, dulling the omnipresent pain of existence. The fire was spreading, quickly, and all there was to do was wait for the fire to spread to the fuel tank.
without causing major monetary damage.  It was a combination of anger, jealousy, resentment, a million things he couldn’t name.  Hurt.  Hurt was one of them.  “It’s bad enough that . . . .”
If only.
a baby?  Where do I get a baby for him?”
Tony shifted restlessly.  “Do you not . . . are you not . . .
He never really understood just how relentless the Russian winter was until now. As he is in the midst and at the mercy of it.
“That bastard -  When?”
Tony nodded, still feeling jittery.  But Steve
Her cheek was wet when he put his lips to it.  “Mother?  Is something the matter?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He turned to greet the sound of conversation.  Steve, now in a more formal light blue peplos, was in deep discussion with Fury.  “Ah, Tony, I see you’ve met everyone.  Have you settled in?”
They were both exceptionally worked up, so in no time Tony was clenching around him, crying out and pulling Steve over the glass-thin precipice.
had been the rumbling reply.
He finishes the coffee and sets the mug down gently, trying to preserve the stillness, but when Steve speaks, it isn’t what Tony expects.
Lightning blasted him.
I cherish comments, so if you kind of want to . . . . Please?
But water was the first thing on the agenda, so he peeled the slit-eyed helm from his head, sopping hair sticking to his fingers.  He let the helmet drop to the ground and knelt on the bank.
But looking at Tony now, he knows that it depends on the person.
But he became obsessed with his children, asking their opinions and trying to learn as much as he could about them.  His captivity was the thing that made them close, and now he didn’t want to let go.  He had spent twenty years ignoring them, and the pain he felt over his imminent death had more to do with Peter and Ria than himself.
“Very much so.”
"Thank you, Carol," they shout in unison.
“Delivery,” Tony announced, muffled by the wall of cloth as he finally navigated his way into the second guest room.  He heard a deep, warm chuckle and the weight left his arms.
“My people want nothing but peace with your planet.”
“I will have two children, but it’s not really something I’m comfortable talking about.  Is it less taboo to talk about them now or something?”
Rarely did he vomit after drinking, but several of those occasions had turned his stomach.
And he had failed.
.  Dionysus’ cousin, Makris, fled here from Hera’s wrath after Zeus entrusted her with the care of the baby.  Then, Poseidon again.  He kidnapped a beautiful nymph and brought her here, saying the island would be named after her, and her descendants would rule over it.”
“Thank you,” Steve said with the slightly breathless way of someone who was in the middle of stuffing their face and had been interrupted. “You didn’t have to do that.”
“Well, it’s impressive, I’ll give them that,” Tony huffed, striding down the sidewalk in the shade of twisted cherry trees, tiny ripe cherries crunching under his loafers.  He quickly snapped a picture of one of the tiny songbirds picking at the ragged remains around the pips and sent it to Clint with the caption “Found your replacement”.
.  A brooch at her belt bore the shield of Thebes, superimposed with a bee instead of a club.
As he walked forward, he caught Steve’s tiny “I already do.”
.  So, most of the existing stock was either especially expensive or was gotten by gathering sea water in flasks and allowing the water to evaporate, leaving a small amount of salt.
Some small part of him was telling him that if Steve hadn’t set up the room personally, he at least made all the decisions regarding it.
want from
Steve nodded a few times. He glanced out the window and his eyes widened. “Is that the site of the World’s Fair?”
“What’re you doin’?”  Cap called.
“I  . . . think?”
“You should have left in the ocean.”
“Wake up, Daddy’s home.”
She sat down next to Fury, and he wrapped an arm around her like they were the best of friends.
He never was to begin with.
Tony surrendered his bowl without complaint, burrowing down into his sheets, blinking sleepily.  “JARVIS, lights.  Wake me when it’s time for my next dose.”  The blackout windows activated, and the light gradually faded to a soft golden glow about the edges of the room.  “Thanks, Steve.”
people.  What are the qualifications?  What makes us special?  What
“This isn’t about me right now!”
Tony’s fall had been captured on video (because wasn’t everything?), and after several days with nothing other than an official statement of “Mr. Stark is expected to make a full recovery” the news cycle had time to dig up and polish their pieces on why Tony shouldn’t be allowed to be an Avenger.  Pepper had told Steve that falling into their pressure would only add fuel to the flames, but Steve didn’t understand how anyone could sit around and let them spew that sort of vitriol.
“Well, I don’t need the target practice.  But I’d rather shoot you than get stabbed by her.”  The owner of the voice came around from where he had been behind the shed, bow drawn back.  The man was blond, but darker than Steve, and his rather sparse beard was pain brown.  He was dressed like a hunter in a deerskin tunic, and he had a pair of large silver earrings that cuffed his earlobes.  “Oh.”  The archer loosened the tension of his bow and lowered it.  “Well, I’m guessing you’re Tony.  But it’s not likely you know of me.  Kyllenios of Aetolia, but you can call me Clint.”
No matter if it was far more intense than anything he had ever experienced.
“No, I – “ but he can’t lie in the face of a double captain glare. “Alright.  Yes.  I think I know what he’s looking into.  I can’t really say what it is right now, but it’s not good, whatever he’s planning.  I have some faith that he doesn’t know much about
Then being marched.  Bright sunlight.
“Tell me what?”  They just smiled and exchanged glances.  “Realize I’m going to be annoying if you don’t tell me.”
They were phosphorus matches.  And knew exactly the angle to strike.
Cursing, Tony pulled back, massaging the knot at the base of his skull.  He was more than ready to be done with this journey.  Howard had given the ship’s captain orders to sail quickly and unostentatiously, which meant minimal stops at ports along the route and that Tony was not allowed to go into the cities and towns to take advantage of the local king’s hospitality.
We’re both committed to making this work.  When the lust fades, is the love and commitment still there?”
, but they couldn’t come up with four for everyone, so they cut it.  Still, they made a limited-edition batch, which we could auction off – ahh-ha!” Tony grunted as he pulled an industrial package filled with a dozen burgundy polishes.  “Pepper, take one.”
“No, no.  Sort of?  We don’t worry about the harvest so much as we get fed.”
interested.”
When he heard Philips shout “Grenade!” he didn’t think.  He just threw himself over it and thought
“Well,” Bruce said, determiningly watch Thor peel off the top of the container, “you should be there when he wakes up.  I think it would make you both feel . . . better.”
They unload Tony’s things, which consist of a large pack filled with food, tools, and other necessities, and the hand case holding his armor. His clothing was engineered to generate and retain the ideal temperature while being fit for weeks of wear if necessary.
.  You aren’t to know,
“Of course!  May I introduce you to my lady mother Frigga, along with my father Odin, and brother Loki?  And these are some of the brave fighters of Crew 91 of the Sequoia National Forest.  Samuel, Clinton, Natasha, James, Steven.  And Steven’s intended, Anthony.”
“Isn’t there always?” Tony mutters, shifting on the yoga mat.
“The only child I’ll ever have is my work.”
, and
“Uhh, Maria says she and Peter were not named after any friends.”
. “I have to go now, but can you keep Shapanka secured until the guards show up?”
“<There have been others. Lost ones.  They insist on going up into the mountains.>”
“Thanks, Pep.”  He pulled her into a hug, sniffing softly.  Even since things started with Steve, he’s seen the biggest weight come off her shoulders.  She didn’t have to worry nearly as much anymore.  “Are you gonna give me away?”
Deciding he’d seen enough, Tony left them to it.  He could still hear Redwing’s squawks and Clint and Sam’s yelps and the sharp
“Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Wednesday.”
Steve had already busted the ring twice on missions, and once in an arm-wrestling match with Thor.  Tony really hadn’t gotten mad, because Steve was careful to collect all the pieces, and Tony simply melted them down and recast the ring.  The vibranium thankfully hadn’t been affected at all, though Tony had developed an annoying habit (to others, not Steve) of banging his ring on the table when he drummed his fingers.  Fury often complained that he needed his conference tables to have gyroscopes installed.  Steve’s husband simply drummed harder.
So his decision to take up a sword and become a hero like the days of old had been met with enthusiastic praise in Athens, and elsewhere.  Women discussed him around the public fountains as they fetched water, men raised cups of wine to him as they relaxed at dinner.  Everywhere he went, people recognized him and asked him for accounts of his deeds.
– who did
, Steve.  Have you ever tried to see just how long you last?"
“Yes.  Though, I’m much more partial to mixing up something and telling you to drink it or apply it twice a day than I am to stopping traumatic injuries.  When I lived in Epidarus that was what I did.  But since Steve convinced me to become an Alastor and move to Korkyra, and there aren’t a ton of practiced healers here.  Sure, most people can set a bone temporarily and staunch moderate bleeding, but I have more knowledge, and they were coming to me for advice, so I capitulated rather quickly.”  Bruce rubbed a hand through his beard.  “Small price to pay.”
Steve gazed down at where Tony was listing sideways in the icy spray.  “I gotta get him upstairs.”
It should.  A dragon has told him that he is a dragon too.  That isn't something most people would just
Emergency beacons are a feature of every suit he builds nowadays, but he let Steve give his advice. It made him feel better.
“Oh, years ago. A lot longer than it feels. But it also feels like no time, so that’s why it’s . . . .”
The edge of his irises seemed to glow like a wire in fire.
He was going to marry Steve.
Steve.  The only thing that could distract Tony from his unsolved identity crisis was the enigma that was his host.  He could see now, what his father and Peggy and everyone else was always talking about.  The man’s
JARVIS warned.  Like he could do anything about it.
“What usually happens before you wake up?”
“You’re not supposed to enjoy it.  This kind of food is supposed to appeal to the lowest common denominator.  Basic and bland,” Bruce supplied as he fished his tea bag out of his cup with a spoon.
They’d been in Europe for nine days, trying to get as much business in as possible, and every moment away had been almost agonizing.  All it was doing was enforcing how much he missed the rest of the team, with their odd hours and emotionally stunted quirks.  And how much he missed a certain supersoldier taking up space in his workshop, and heart, if he ever cared to admit it.
He swung around to see the alarm’s light blinking steadily. The pattern of flashes – long short long short pause – indicated a Code C, a person attempting to access a secure area that was not accessible without Tony’s presence and permission, likely one of the vaults beneath him. Tony was about to lurch over to the attaché case when he noticed the golden gauntlets already covering his arms.
Howard held up his hands for quiet, and the men respectfully allowed their cheering to die down.  “You have done very well, my son,” Howard proclaimed, venom dripping from his honeyed words, “and we should honor you for your dealing with this, ah, terrible threat.  We shall feast in your honor tonight.”
“No eraetes,” Tony said over Steve.  “There’ve been offers . . . .”  He shuddered.  “But no.”
“Someone’s in trouble,” Bucky sing-songed.
“You know damn well why!  Back off!”
Beneath the redwood of Tony’s eyes was gold, shiny and incorruptible and delicate and precious.  “You’re ridiculous.”
“You need to step away.”
“Okay, since you seem to know what’s going on, what do you think he’s gonna have me do?”
“Then suit up.”
It was love.  Finally.
But he never
“I can
Steve continues examining the inside of his eyelids, wondering why there was a sudden deluge of chatter in his mind.  One male, deep enough to be reassuring to a causal listener, but somehow pitched higher in a way that implied constant indignation bordering on affection.  The other female, pleasantly low, but also pitched higher, and sounded both energized and exhausted at the same time.  Her tone was loving.
“Does it bother you?”
How could Tony have been so calm about this?
The girl considered it.  “Does that mean I get another story?”
Natasha reached out and tapped his bicep.  “You’re the new kid in town, and heir to the throne of one of the most powerful city-states around.  You’re gonna get an unfair share of the attention for a while.”
“Did I have the balls to name you after me?”
He smiles, and this time it’s genuine.
“Get yourself something to eat. Or drink, I don’t care. On me. I’ll be down in a bit.”
“About what?”
Tony didn’t change his life after finding out he would someday have kids.  Ria had assured him that they wouldn’t be born for about thirty years, so he just tuned out her disapproval and went about his business.  He slept around, partied, go shitfaced at every opportunity.  He didn’t go searching for a love that wasn’t going to make an appearance for a couple decades.
Having Steve and at the same time not having him . . . it would drive him out of his mind, out of his skin. Vulnerable and weak as he is, Tony has no desire to die. Because he figured long ago that both having Steve and not would kill him.
“Look, Steve, Clint and I have a usual bet.  Thor wanted in, so Bruce went in as well.  It’s not a huge deal.”  Steve still looked about ready to throw something, so Nat turned to the others.  “Okay, pay up and show our good Captain what was at stake before he has a coronary.”
His vision whites out as he comes, but he keeps his eyes open, wondering what Steve will see.  He comes down with Steve spooned into his side, pressing butterfly kisses to Tony’s eyelids.
“What – what I’m
“Sorry if it’s too personal-“
The thought of where it was supposed to
He lightly traced a finger through Tony’s ejaculate before raising it to his lips for a taste.  Tony stared, slack jawed.
“Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?”
“We done here?”
The crazy, manic inventor gleam was shining in Tony's eyes.  "I could lend you a bit of help, if you wanted."
Steve’s voice is deathly quiet. “I’m just concerned.  I – Tony, you’re you.  Don’t lose track of who
“Steve?” the fingers on his arm jolted him.
“Son of a bitch!” the kid grunted as he primed his gun and climbed out.
Tony looked at Steve in exasperated askance, but he just rolled his eyes again.  “You know Clint is an ass on purpose, right?”
“Nahhh,” Odin huffed.
“Okay, then.  I’d need to see it in person, but it sounds like your problem’s in the fluctuating pressure.  If it was designed to withstand the pressure of a fuller pool, then when things dry up a bit there isn’t enough to sustain a decent flow.”
Tony had never been showered with dried fruits and nuts before.  It was tradition to shower new members of a household with offerings to Hestia to formally welcome a person into the house.  The ritual was usually performed for new brides, slaves, and other people who were “adopted” into the
“I was having twelve percent of a moment.”  There it was.  “This seems serious, Phil seems pretty shaken.”
“You’ll meet someone,” she whispered in his ear.  “Someone who will see underneath all your bluster and bluff, and love
Palladium poisoning.
“Well, Thor loves his brother,” Clint supplied, tripping and swearing.  “He’d forgive him for anything, no matter what he says.  I’m not going to blame him; Thor’s got the biggest heart I know, but I don’t think he’s able to be rational where his brother’s concerned.”
Cap also had obviously heard something funny, as he was nearly bent double, laughing at something Tony couldn’t hear.
“Mother?”
.  I don’t have the patience, nor the time.  I love you, but we have to look objectively at this.”
With those magic words, Tony pulled Steve down by the collar of his shirt, and slid their open mouths together.
“You miss him?”
“Iron Man!
These occurrences are always so surreal, because there are few people as direct as Steve about certain things. Sure, Steve would need a double-dose of emotional laxatives before you could even broach any sort of
“Why not?”
He finds a song, because he looks for songs that mention eyes.
“ – and we need to talk.”
He at least could follow a few steps right behind.
be able to go back.  You’re self-centered enough to think that – “
Then he let himself go.
Steve took one look at the rumpled genius, nasal cannula and stitches and glassy eyes.  “Okay.  Fine.”
“That’s one hell of an understatement,” Rhodey puffs, the tendons in his neck pulling taunt.
Had Tony set JARVIS to watch Steve and alert him if Steve seemed pissed?  Steve wouldn’t have put it past him.
“Okay, I’ll buy that.  But, Tony,” if Fury had been a more approachable man he might have put a comforting hand on his shoulder, “you don’t know Steve.  He doesn’t get out there much, but he’s still very conscious of the fact that he was born to a supposedly virginal priestess of Asklepius who ended up having a son anyway.  He grew up lower than dirt in the city that you were born in the highest position.  Sure, all kings and tyrants love him, but he’s not stupid.  He keeps his distance; he keeps the mythical hold over them.  Were he to get involved in your petty politics, he’d quickly become just another king from a backwater island further away  than Aetolia, and the mythos of the grandest hero of the Hydric War would be lost.”
, and returning with the pill bottle and a glass of water.  He fumbled with the cap, finally getting it off and pouring the prescribed two pills into Tony’s waiting palm.  He gulped them down dry.
And he was.  More than anyone, so it sometimes seems.  Steve at least understands, most of the time.
The bed shifts as he sits, removes his shoes, then he stands, shucks his clothing off.  The clang of his belt buckle is inhumanly loud.  The shift of sheets, and the gust of cold air his Tony’s legs.  But he’s already frozen.
“Name?”
“Well, not exactly like Talos.  He walked around Krete three times a day.  I only get around to doing it once,” Steve squinted at the sun, high in the sky.  “I’m not going to make you come along, if that’s what you’re wondering.”
So instead of saving it, Tony dug his nail through the salt deposit that had formed in the fold between his chin and neck, then scraped it off on the bracer on his wrist.
Yes, it was occasionally hard to concentrate when Tony did things like smile. Or start in on one of his signature monologues. Or when he called Steve’s couch his own and started consistently using the same coaster (a glass-blown piece in yellow and blue that Ella from Steve’s art class had gifted him) to put his drinks on. But the thing was that even despite all that, they still
“You eaten yet?” Bruce asked, gesturing to the yogurt, fruit and granola he was now assembling in careful layers into several identical clear bowls. Tony blinked, the easy contentment of earlier fading slightly.
“I’m just about to head over to the Tower, actually.”
“I thought, uh, check-in first?” Bruce’s hands stilled, just long enough for the thin layer of honey he’d been adding to the parfait to become a thick, uneven blob. (It wasn’t like it mattered if Bruce had given up on check-ins, right? Tony hadn’t liked them anyway. The disappointment that had him feeling like his stomach was sinking into his shoes was just about the loss of something familiar, that was all.)
The second Tony placed a period at the end of the sentence, written out just as Phil had dictated, his Dominant was waiting with a kiss. He gripped the back of Tony’s neck and took, teeth and tongue insistent, greedy, impatient, all the things Phil Coulson never was except like this. Tony whined when it was over and couldn’t even muster up the energy to be embarrassed.
Coulson sat back in his chair and frowned, staring at a spot somewhere past Tony’s left ear in thought.
Ah, yes. This will likely be one of my more frustrating replies, simply because several of these events have not yet happened. Some (particualrly the first gala, given the upcoming celebration devoted to Stark and his team) will be unfolding soon in the main narrative, so I will reluctantly allow the author to share them.
Tony never should have gotten out of bed.
Steve didn’t remember getting dressed. He had to have put on more than the boxers he’d been sleeping in, but the entire block of time between realizing who would be on the other end of the line and actually making it into T’Challa’s offices were just gone, as if he hadn’t even been conscious. (His hand trembled when he picked up the phone, and he was painfully grateful the rooms were empty.)
After several failed attempts at sleep, Tony had given the whole thing up as a bad job and retreated to the workshop. He’d managed to fill close to an hour with rearranging various parts and tools to reflect his own preferences rather than Mark II’s. This at least made the place feel a little bit less uncanny, plus he would stop stabbing his fingers on the skillsaw when he was reaching for wrenches.  However, it didn’t solve the larger issue, which was simply that Tony didn’t actually have anything to do down here.
“You come if you need to, sweetheart. We have all night. We’ll start back at the beginning when you’re ready, see if you can make it until you’re ready for my cock next time.” The idea of starting back at the tiny smooth dildo made Tony want to sob in desperation, and he slowed the movement of the one in his ass, trying his best to avoid his prostate and stimulate himself as little as possible. Steve growled and aborted a swing of the crop that would have landed on Tony’s hip. “Don’t you dare. You work that toy, Tony, you be good for me. If you need to come then you come, and you let me worry about what happens next.”
“Okay. Short version: Peter’s suit contains an AI that draws upon digitized versions of my voice and memories, and then uses predictive software to react to present circumstances. It’s similar to the technology I used to make JARVIS, which is…well, technically a bit less advanced than FRIDAY, but AIs are somewhat easier to make when they’re modelled on an existing person rather than created truly from scratch.”
Tony still had feelings, numerous, dubious, borderline-shouty feelings about everything that had happened that morning, and all of it was made worse by how hungry he now was.
He would reflect later (much, much later) about what made that particular night what it was. Tony and Steve had scened together before, had fucked just the evening prior, there was no reason in the world for it to suddenly feel like what everyone said about Trues was not just possible, but the most absurd understatement in human history. Except maybe that was the point. Maybe it had only been when they’d stopped trying to prove anything, when they’d been nothing but a submissive trying to comfort his Dominant after a long day, that their instincts had been able to recognize one another for what they were.
“Nothing to do with Stark.”
“There’s more than one way to be submissive in relation to clothes. Lots of subs like bein’ naked, and it does help your Doms to be able to see you like that, but sometimes it’s just as fulfilling to see your sub in clothes you chose for them. The underwear was all Barton, but the rest is stuff I picked. Should be comfortable to exercise in.” Tony groaned, loud enough to be clearly audible even over the shirt he was busy sliding over his head.
As for Captain Rogers in the so-called MCU, well…it is probably for the best that I show you. Thinking about Stark in a romantic context always leaves me wishing for some kind of decontamination shower.
that’s so good. I could fuck your throat for days, do you know that?” Thor moaned in enthusiastic agreement with this plan, and the heavy vibrations against Steve’s cock spelled the end. He came with a shuddering cry, fingers roughly settling into Thor’s long blonde hair.
Tony clearly assumed that the tumultuous scene at breakfast was going to get him out of exercising, and Steve did wonder if his complaining when he learned otherwise was ever going to end. He did brighten up, though, when he learned that the entire team would be joining he and Rhodes on their run, and they all did their best to make it fun. It was nice enough outside for them to use the beach rather than the gym, and Rhodey shouted Air Force running cadences over the sounds of the crashing waves as they ran through the sand in what could only very loosely be called a formation. This naturally led to Steve and Phil both trying to persuade the team to use Army cadences instead, resulting in a cacophony of jumbled calls and responses which eventually culminated in Clint singing what turned out to be the Hogwarts school song. The exertion and the ocean breeze had brought a beautiful  to Tony’s cheeks and Steve was deeply sorry when Rhodey eventually called a halt to the session. (Judging by the cheers and pained groans that came from the rest of the team, however, he was very likely the only one who felt that way.)
“Personally,” Howard continued as if Tony hadn’t spoken (a good sign his had been the right answer), “I think True subs and Doms are uncommon because orientation is a trait that’s just dying out. And in my book that’s a damn good thing. No one should have to rely on anyone like that. People…they disappoint each other. It’s what we do. We hurt each other and leave each other and end up on the bottom of the
It was never not a delight to watch Coulson troll the team, so it took Tony longer than it should have to register what he’d heard.
No one would even tell him if Steve was planning to attend, which undoubtedly meant he was still holed up in the gym.  This suspicion was confirmed when Tony stepped out of the elevator and into the penthouse living room to find the rest of the team gathered, with Steve’s spot on the couch conspicuously open.
“Morphine doesn’t work on me, my system burns through it too fast.” Tony winced. Of course this Peter wouldn’t have found a work-around to that issue yet, not without Tony’s help or resources.
It's so fun to be back in this verse in a more consistent way! Thank you so much for sticking with me, and for your comments and kudos You can also free to let me know if you have AskStrange questions!
“Oh, hey, I almost forgot: some of you might have seen Melissa Collins, head of CNOW, come in today. She was scheduled to meet with a senior member of SI this morning because we had hoped that the organization’s stance against trans-orientation, and even recognizing social factors as a factor in orientation, had softened with time and consideration as many do. Unfortunately, CNOW remains committed to an extremely rigid and exclusive definition of orientation—and, honestly, a terrible name, and this is coming from the guy in a relationship with several employees of the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division. I want to reiterate that this is entirely out of line with Stark Industries’ views and commitments. While I particularly want to thank Mr. Fletcher for his valiant attempts to open a dialogue, there are simply some topics about which there cannot be compromise; as far as I and SI are concerned, the right of all individuals to dignity, safety, and self-determination is one of them. And now I should really get back in there before they realize my lunch break has been about an hour too long.”
his ass?” There were appreciative murmurs from several distinct voices, and when Tony looked up he could see that everyone who was visible to him was touching or being touched by someone else. A shirtless Clint was between Steve and Rhodey, trading energetic kisses with both men and appearing absolutely delighted by this development. He couldn’t see Thor or Phil, but he heard the former give a particularly enthusiastic moan of Coulson’s name (his first name, even), so he assumed those two were enjoying themselves as well. It was nice, sometimes to be the centre of attention, but right now Tony found himself relieved by the idea that they were focusing on each other as well.
“No, the wedding. We should do it all here.” Watching his team’s reactions to this proposal was somewhat like a character study all in itself. Natasha, Phil and Bucky began to survey the space from a security perspective—plotting out obvious sightlines, methods for securing or blocking off particularly vulnerable areas, probably planning where they could stash a weapon or fifteen. Clint, while likely undergoing similar mental gymnastics, was also smirking widely, amused by the challenges that were making the others hesitate. (Rhodey, who Tony would never stop reminding people was just as inclined towards mischief as Tony himself, just slightly better at hiding it, wore a nearly identical grin.) Thor, with all the overconfidence of a god, surveyed the land like it was another territory he now ruled. Sitting next to him, Bruce’s expression gave little away. Tony carefully didn’t look in Steve’s direction, not yet.
Steve has been so busy watching Bucky, preparing for the attack from one side, that he neglected to guard his flank. And now Sam leans against the doorway wearing Bucky’s t-shirt, a steaming mug of tea in his hands, openly projecting the kind of concern that Bucky would have hidden behind several layers of snark. (Steve hates that look. During long, lonely nights in Wakanda that look had brought Steve to tears more than once.)
He did open it, to find it soft red velvet lining. A cylindrical stand sat square in the centre, and the housing unit he’d handed to his Dominants the day prior was nestled on top of it, covering everything else with warm blue light. Around the stand itself was nestled a collar. After imagining this moment for so long, Tony’s first, ridiculous impulse was to close his eyes, afraid that if he looked too hard for too long, this beautiful, perfect moment might turn to dust. It was Steve, like always, who called him home.
“But you said—or implied, at least, that you and the other Dr. Strange speak.”
“He is training with the team. While he is still not an official members of the Avengers, Colonel Rhodes provides his assistance and trains with the team whenever practical, particularly after the…loss of your counterpart.” Even JARVIS paused when he mentioned Mark II, like acknowledging Mark II’s absence still hurt him. (A part of Tony was relieved that his FRIDAY had lost him so young. She would adapt far more easily. And she’d have Pe-people to help her grow and learn.)
“Like I said, your point is still well taken, Bruce. But whatever his reasons are, right now Tony’s boundaries are extremely clear. So I think we respect what he’s saying he is and isn’t willing to take on right now, and we come back to some of the reasoning behind it at a later date. Agreed?”
As the time stretched on and the team still didn’t return, those small and almost certainly unintentional acts of Tony’s were no longer enough. Steve stood and began to pace the length of the penthouse, wondering whether he’d be able to lift the shield, and for how long, if he went after the Avengers now. Then Tony moved and made a slight hissing noise. It was quiet, something Steve probably would have missed entirely without his enhanced hearing, but it was there, and it was decidedly pained. Now every Dominant drive Steve had was all but screaming at him to
“You’re leaving them.” Tony spluttered, made a vague attempt at denying and deflecting, which she swatted away like they were particularly irritating insects. “Don’t bother, I know it’s true. Have they…did they hurt you?”
While Clint was still marinating in his outrage, Steve abandoned his attempts to undress Nat with his eyes and turned a somewhat disbelieving stare on Phil.
“Is…what is this?”
Eventually, even being held and fed by Rhodey wasn’t enough to distract Tony from the silence of the room. Especially since everyone kept staring at him like they were waiting for something. And hell, they probably were. It wasn’t as if there wasn’t a million damn things they should probably have been talking about, like how Tony had gotten here and what had happened to other-Tony and when he’d be leaving the Tower and—yeah. Not going there yet. Not until he could even think it without wanting to hyperventilate.
As to the first, this universe does have to make some concessions in terms of labour practice in order to accommodate orientational needs. (There’s a brief allusion to this in my Chapter Five responses.)  There are particular provisions set up for new submissive which (were Stark’s status not a secret) would cover the fact that the team is currently devoting extensive time and resources to his care. Settled Dominant/submissive dynamics, while still requiring time and energy, are not quite as demanding. That said, I would speculate that the tension between labour and orientational needs is a significant aspect of Stark Industries’attempts to cover up the fact that the standard 8+ hour work day leaves many in states of borderline deprivation.
“Its Spiderman!” Peter cried. “Ugh parents!”
Not entirely used to making choices like that Bucky shrugged, “Well think about it over breakfast.” Tony said, “And order anything you want, hell order the entire menu if you want!”
“Yes Sir.”
As the Doctor continued to speak, saying something about motor function, bowel and bladder control, rehabilitation. Tony tried desperately to make his toes move. He poured all of his energy into making just one stupid toe wiggle, to jump, to do anything, but no, his toes might as well have been cut off for all the use they were, his legs too, laying limp and unresponsive.
They made it down to the common room where everyone was standing around in shock when Tony’s legs went from under him and ended up back on the ground crying out that he needed to push.
Reaching a stairway, Tony unclipped the key card/name tag from the jacket and pressed the barcode against the scanner, the door buzzed and unlocked letting up through.
“Time to go home,” Tony said, with another forced smile, he opened the car doors, and helped Steve fold up the pram, and settle Lily into the car seat, securing her for the home journey.

“Digging your own grave there Dad.” Peter said, his voice growing a little timid as he finished the sentence. Steve paused in folding his shirts and looked at Peter surprised. “Is it, um, is that okay?” Peter asked worrying at his bottom lip, “I mean I know you’re not technically my Father, but I um, I’d like to.. I think of you as…” He trailed off as a smile spread over Steve’s face.
“Whiny, shiny, tin bauble.”
“Hubughthosptaled?” Tony asked, his voice garbled and unintelligible.
“I hate you!” Tony spat at her, as he rose from his seat, willing his erection away,
“Ummmm….?” The super soldier frowned not following Tony’s line of questioning, mainly because it had come out of the blue as Tony’s questions often did, not having anything that led up to them so a person could at least get the general idea of the topic he was talking about.
“Wedding coordinators?” Steve asked, “That’s really a thing, not just a Hollywood made up thing?”
“Steven Rogers!” Tony mock gasped, “You are supposed to be above such lewd and depraved things, what would America say if they knew their golden boy was such a pervert?”
“I guess.” Peter murmured.
“You know how Captain Jack Harkness behaves around people he likes a lot and the Doctor tells him to stop?”
I wanna wake up with you in my bed every morning, I wanna fall asleep with you at my back, I wanna spend my heats with you, have breakfast in bed with you, get a damn dog and go on stupid afternoon walks with you and the kids, so don’t you fucking dare leave me now Steve.”
“Are they your kids?”
“It’s been sitting out for a while.” Steve murmured. He looked at the leather book, “What’s this?”
“But we’re not dead.” Steve said, “That’s a spanner in the works.”
“I guess we should…” Tony began, trailing off and nibbling at his bottom lip,
The analogy fitted Tony to a T. He was always doing it, had always been doing it and Steve had been just as fooled as everyone else, but his eyes were open now and he could see past the armour to the vulnerable man beneath, a man that needed support and understanding, a man that needed love that didn’t come with judgement, a love that Steve was determined to give him.
“In other circumstances and if I were ten years younger, then I would jump at the chance to be with you.” Tony said, trying to let Steve down as gently as he could, “You need someone your own age, someone unspoiled and without all of my issues.”
“You’ll be alright, Tony, just lay still and take deep breaths.” Bruce instructed him.
Steve nodded, “That’s plausible and I doubt anyone will argue.” He glanced through the window of Peter’s room to where Zach was enacting the battle for Peter, bouncing on the bed as he dramatically told his story, “What does he think of this?”
Maria made to sit on the rush mat, but Tony snatched up a flattish cushion and pushed it towards her.  She smiled gratefully, then seated herself.  Tony plopped down next to her, the addition of the cushion making them the same height.  She took his hand.
“Then don’t take my stuff.”
“Tony, you’re shaking,” Nat murmured, putting a hand on his elbow.  “What’s wrong?”
“Okay, I’m taking you to Cape Canaveral.  And Houston.  I’ll get you a little orange flight suit and everything.”
“Um, actually, no, but keep thinking that.” The armor clanged against the wall and he groped for the switch that triggered the trapdoor. Despite the clumsy fingers of the armor, he managed to grip it and pull. The door’s hydraulics engaged, and Shapanka fell with a clatter. It took a minute to fumble the switch in the opposite direction, and in that time, the motor whined and groaned to a halt, ice coating the interior workings.
“Right.” Tony steps away, peeling off his clothing.  Steve doesn’t avert his eyes, it’s nothing he hasn’t seen, but he’s allowed to look now, Tony supposes.  Or he allows himself to look.
He didn’t look away from Tony’s face.  “I’m not leaving him here alone.”
He pressed his thumb into the slit firmly, allowing himself a tweak of a nipple before he stuck his left pinkie in his mouth, biting harshly to muffle the obscene sounds he was making.
“They’re my competition!” Clint shouted, and Tony felt the dull sting in his calf of a popcorn kernel.
Rhodey sets the pastry box down as Tony screws the top off and smells strong coffee. He foregoes the small cup in the cap, and drinks directly from the thermos.  Rhodey just sighs, shakes his head, and roots through a drawer for a pair of scissors.  Carol is bowed over, wheezing.
They paused to catch their breath, listening to Shapanka’s groans and curses in Hungarian. Steve was grinning at him like he was the sun. “Iron Man! To – Mister Stark said I might see you around. I hadn’t guessed it would be today!” A look of concern crossed his face. “Everything’s alright?”
They’d all tiptoed around him at first (except Thor, who was on Asgard, and Natasha, who tiptoed right up to his face), but Tony hadn’t.  He’d been brash in his teasing yet uncruel, and would always answer any question that Steve had.  He made fun of his age, yes, but he never made Steve feel stupid or like it was his fault.  He helped Steve were he could, and directed him to someone if he couldn’t.
Tony couldn’t pinpoint what formal place the Alastors kept in the hierarchy, but it did seem that they were recognized akin to a royal family.  (In Steve’s absence, people seemed to defer to Sam in his place.)  However, they didn’t remain separate or aloof.  Different members of the household came up to Tony quite brazenly to introduce themselves, expressing their desire that he would enjoy his stay.  Oileos, Steve’s chief steward, a boisterous man of about fifty and a transplant from Salamis, entertained Tony with a lengthy anecdote about a fight he gotten into with a potter over a prostitute and some anchovies that had them all doubled over, clutching their knees.

The Tony Stark Aesthetic: three piece bespoke Italian suit, Italian loafers, some personalized scent that made him want to retch when he opened the bottle, sunglasses.
They stared each other down: on one side, the mechanical engineer who never likes to be wrong, on the other, the chemical engineer who is probably right.
, clenching around him and
“Right.  I caught his act in Stuttgart.”
“Just don’t eat it all,” Steve scolded playfully as he pulled off his suit jacket and hung it by the door, and rolled up his sleeves around his bulging forearms.
Water in his lungs.  Maria calling out to him.
Why in the hell did Steve think Tony needed someone normal?  They wouldn’t be able to keep up.
“You’ve already watched it?”  Tony knew all about Steve’s almost childish enthusiasm over the Apollo program.  The idea that man had left Earth was an astounding concept for Steve (even though the man lived with an alien prince from another galaxy), and was convinced Apollo 11 was one of the greatest events in American history.
Steve huffs.
A chuckle vibrated through the bed, and Tony allowed himself to smile into the darkness.  “Well, you’re consistent in your inconsistency.  How’s that?”
The sun had yet to rise, but there was light enough to see, purpling as it threatened dawn.  He could hear the grunts of pigs awoken with feed, and the crackle of cooking fires.  In the hills, shepherds were driving their flocks to their new pastures.
“Just . . . don’t feel good.  Got a bug.”
“I’d – I’m no
It already forms a sort of lump-shaped pile, covering an empty corner at the back of his workshop.
It was like thunderclouds rolled across Steve’s face.  “I see.”
It was a ridiculous thought, but Tony couldn’t find it in himself to care.
Tony didn’t answer.  He heard Steve take a deep breath.
“You’re beautiful.”
Uh, no.  “Call your mom, can you bunk over?”
He was most
and Steve has to refrain from yelling that this is already complicated.
“As a matter of fact I did.  He was one of the founding members of SHELID.  And I get the feeling you’re gonna be a much better father than him.”
“Is it his bird guy?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Unbidden into his mind was a image of Steve, in a soft thin hoodie and flannel pants standing in an empty kitchen at 3 A.M., holding a bottle to a tiny infant that he cradled to his broad chest, crooning some old Irish song about Carrickfergus and Ballygrant and the sea being too wide to cross.  Steve would look up, and smile at Tony with soft eyes –
Tony returned by grasping desperately at Steve’s biceps, forearms, the bases of his shoulder blades, clawing and gripping like this was a one-time thing, like Steve wouldn’t be perfectly happy staying exactly like this for the rest of his life.
He and Pepper didn’t end up having their discussion.  She took one look at Steve hovering protectively over Tony’s bedside and said softly “Oh, Steve.”
“Need pills?”
He built his armor from metal because he knew he could trust it.

“I’m a SHELD shadow.  Once we know you were ill I was tasked to you by Director Fury.”
“The season just ended, and I make sure to clean up after myself.  No one will ever know,” Steve offers.
It started slowly, with a fever.  Then he couldn’t control his impulse to take the suit through the In-n-Out drive-thru.  The skin around the arc reactor began to get red and inflamed with a silvery raised hashed pattern, and the compulsion to liquidize assets.  He donated ridiculous amounts to charity and stopped looking at profit margins.
Bruce looked about ready to Hulk out just to get out of there.  “Uh, I just wanna finish my work here and . . . .”  He trailed off.
He answers on the second ring.
Even beloved fathers had the fear of being ousted by sons.  That paradox in their society, with the strive to have strong son to inherit bringing that fear of the son becoming greater than the father, was a plague they would probably never eradicate.
’?  Why haven’t I herd of this before?  That’s like my autobiography.  Put in on,” Tony demanded.
“You wanna go?  I’m done here.”
“Who’s going to?  Surely not you.”  Steve knew he was overstepping the line, but he was so tired of how they treated Tony, like some bratty toddler instead of a mind that could tie them in knots.
He didn’t know where they were.  Some part of him said Natasha had joined them, but another disagreed.  But it wouldn’t be like he would be trusted with that information.
“Take all the time you need.”
“Little?”
“Never,” Clint declared, stanching up a platter of roast pork and heading over to lounge across one of the couches.
“You know,” Tony found himself saying after a while, “if you like the jargon so much, I can set up a live feed to the design labs downstairs.  If you want.”
Obadiah Stane, Howard’s business partner and heir presumptive until Tony’s birth, had taken control and had encouraged Tony to head to MIT while still producing inventions for Stark Industries.  A year later, and after an incident of kidnapping that Steve still hadn’t been debriefed on, Tony had built the Iron Man suit and had taken over from Stane, who had mysteriously disappeared.
“Well, yeah.”
But time to put Steve out of his mind for a while. He had to check Iron Man out.
For a moment, Tony simply wallowed in the pearls Steve had just given him.  Howard had never said anything to this effect.  “You . . . really enjoy fucking with me, don’t you?”
Still staring vacantly into his wine, he was filled with a fierce determination to not only prove himself, but to thrive here, and not just to gain these people’s respect, but to belong in their midst and their love.
So standing here in Barton’s completely middle class farmhouse was something far out of Tony’s depth.  For him, hospitality was something you paid others to give to your guests.  Even if you did get personally involved, it would be more of a situation where you found the guest’s preferences and sent them to the staff catering to their needs.  It was nice, if impersonal, and everyone went away smiling.
Tony threw back his head and moaned obscenely, adding to Steve’s mental catalogue he would
Steve gave him the most brilliant smile before pulling him in for a morning-breath laced kiss.
Tony turned his chest light to full beam.
“I said I
JARVIS answered, a hint of humor in his voice.
“Tony, nothing about this process is average.”
“So?  Can I throw things at you?” Nausikaa whined.
“I had an oxtail soup in Mexico once.  Tomatoes and green beans?” Bruce asked.
“Bond with your daughter.  I’ll be back up soon.”  She patted Tony’s still overloaded arm once before blowing Clint a kiss and slipping down the stairs.
It would work.  She would like the antecedent of the twins.  As much as he’d love to tell his mother everything, this letter was not the place to do it.  Someone would read this correspondence undoubtedly, and he could not rely on it only being Jarvis or Pepper.  Tony still wasn’t sure what exactly Steve had planned for him, but he could not very well write “train me to become an Alastor”, so it would have to pass.  He thought of writing to Pepper, Rhodey, or Peggy, but they would all undoubtedly see this, and no one would think anything different of him if they found him writing to his mother.
“What’s gonna be better with the next year?” Tony asked suspiciously.
The inflections they had, their vocabulary, and their pronunciation were slightly different than what he usually heard, so he supposed these voices were like something from the future.
.  Sure, a few monsters had shown their ugly faces, but aside from the Attic Boar and the Argive Bull, nothing had posed a threat to any major population.  There was peace and plenty.
Steve, you have a mighty need to take care of that boy.  Yes, you do.  Stop denying it.
An excellent question that I am deeply pleased was asked. Trues are venerated enough in most parts of the world that many countries offer subsidies for one or both partners to remain home; there are also legal protections that force employers to make flexible arrangements for True employees who wish to complete the majority of their work from home.

…) He’d been prepared to exchange a greeting with Tony, maybe some polite and distant conversation about work or training. A discussion about kink and sex and limits with a Tony who was struggling to walk normally because of whatever he’d done to himself the day before had
“Nope. Brucey-Bear is just a tattle-tale, s’like a universal constant. And I slept fine, Rhodeykins.” A spot of black dangled at the edge of Tony’s peripheral vision, and he didn’t need to bother turning his head to realize that Rhodey had his damn mug and was using it as bait. Asshole. “I slept at least three hours longer than I’ve slept in recent memory. Let’s let that be enough, alright?” Rhodey made a disgruntled noise but surrendered custody of the mug at last. It turned out to be full of coffee made (mostly) just the way Tony preferred it. The other guy—ha!—used a different sweetener, agave syrup maybe. Tasted less immediately sweet, but it was also less assaulting than white sugar, and it didn’t linger on his tongue in the same slightly unpleasant way.
through anxiety; with as much practice as he had with the feeling, how could he not?
Which means whatever this is is more sensitive than any of that. His stomach tightened into knots so painful that for a moment he thought nausea might make it past the serum. (Tony.)
Thanks again for this question, and merry (extremely belated) Christmas to you too!
Ah, an interesting question. The previous version of Stark had provided a brief outline of events related to Stave’s betrayal (that he had engineered Stark’s abduction and, when that failed, procured an arc reactor by force and attacked.) However, until the events outlined in the chapter from this week, no members of the team aside from Agent Coulson were familiar with the full details of those events.
Not everything was big, intimidating structures, though. There was a set of drawers against one wall that wouldn’t have been out of place in a regular bedroom, though Tony assumed the contents were far more interesting than socks or t-shirts. The reclaimed wood of the drawers, full of beautiful imperfections and inconsistencies, matched the frame of the truly massive bed that took pride of place in the middle of the room. Off to one side of the bed was another area; it might be too large to properly be called a nook, but that was the name Tony was going with in his head, because it was recessed and somewhat secluded from the rest of the room. There was another mattress, thinner and much smaller than the bed, covered in a thick stack of folded blankets that all looked so cozy that the urge to dive into them face-first was embarrassingly strong. The bed stopped a few feet short of where the nook itself ended; the rest of the nook contained a curved oil diffuser, some candles, massage oils, a white box with a speaker, and a small basket of fuzzy socks. His brain focused in on the latter, recalling Bruce sliding a similar pair onto Tony’s own feet back. (Aftercare. This whole area was just for aftercare.)
None of which meant that Tony didn’t agonize about the whole thing. He changed outfits seven separate times before winding up in the same pair of jeans and dusty rose button down he’d started off in. (The latter was a little bolder than Tony would have usually chosen, but he was still working with Mark II’s closet, and the guy had apparently been a little more adventurous than Tony tended to be.) Clint met him at the elevators in a pair of black jeans and a clingy green sweater, so Tony had at least managed to guess the vibe. Rather than stepping into the penthouse, though, Clint crooked a finger to beckon Tony into the elevator with him. (Dummy, who had supervised the whole getting-ready process, rolled up behind Tony in an attempt to subtly nudge him forward.)
“It’s not about that, not at all. There are a lot of ways that aren’t related to sex for a Dom to care for your body, though, and makin’ sure you’re in shape is one of ‘em. I’m not remotely worried about your strength, I know the kinds of muscle that making and using the suit requires. But I’d like a better sense of your stamina and endurance so that I know what areas we should be working on.”
For several long seconds, the two of them stared at one another. It was unclear which of them was more surprised by Peter’s outburst. Peter was considering what it would actually take to dig a tunnel through the floor (it was Hulk-reinforced, so unfortunately probably a lot) when JARVIS alerted Tony to the fact that the vibranium they were heating into an ore was currently in danger of burning. The fact that Peter’s tantrum had distracted Tony to the point of nearly ruining the most expensive and precious material on the planet was almost unthinkable, and it made Peter’s concerns about losing the guy feel suddenly laughable.
going up there if he has to face Rogers. Something like sympathy flickers across Pepper’s expression, sympathy he suspects isn't directed at him, which is almost enough to get Tony riled up all over again. Whatever else he and Pepper had come to disagree on, she had been firmly on his side after the whole civil-war debacle. Her list of insults for Rogers was actually stunningly creative and often downright vicious.
And of course Phil was pissed, possibly more pissed than any of the team. The man took his job as handler extremely seriously, and while Steve hadn’t actively lied to anyone, he also had been far from truthful. All of them had seemed to assumed that he was practicing some long-distance Domming with other members of the team, and Steve simply…hadn’t corrected any of them. Not a lie, but definitely not the full disclosure they had all come to expect from one another.
Content Notes: So, this chapter is abut 75% sex. Plot-relevant sex, but still. That's pretty much it. To the point that reading around it would mean almost skipping the chapter altogether, but if you want to give it a shot, you probably want to stop reading at "These are pretty heavy" and pick up again after the section break.
“Certainly it’s something we would need to be particularly cautious of. Bucky actually had a great idea the other day about how to alleviate some of those concerns, though.” As one, the table’s attention turned to Barnes, who plainly hadn’t been expecting it and had just put a heaping spoonful of soup in his mouth. He swallowed, a loud gulp that to be at least partly for show.
“Some sort of altercation happened between your Son and Mr Osborn. I am not sure of all the details yet, but Peter was seen by multiple teachers hitting Mr Osborn who has had to go to hospital.” He looked at Peter with a confused and disappointed look which made Peter’s stomach churn, “This behaviour is very unlike your Son, he’s never been involved in such things before.”
“We recognize that for now this is mostly between the three of you. However, I do have a suggestion if you’re willing to hear it,” Phil said, his voice was the same deep well of calm competence it always was during the worst, most disastrous missions. May, Tony, and Peter all nodded. “Peter, I think the only thing that’s going to really help you believe that Tony is serious, and that you can trust him, is time. Perhaps prior to starting your internship with Tony, both you and your Aunt would consider joining us for dinner on a weekly basis—whenever works for your schedules. Then all the pressure of getting to know one another isn’t placed on this one morning.”
Tony, Thor, and Natasha had just wrestled a truly monstrous tree into a stand when JARVIS announced, for the second time in as many weeks, the arrival of Peter Parker. When the boy stepped out of the elevator and into the penthouse this time he had none of the fury or the fire Steve had seen a week before. He had brought not only his backpack but also a worn green duffle bag with the initials ‘B.P.’ stitched into it, and there were tracks of moisture on his face that Steve was certain weren’t the result of the lightly falling snow outside.
“Ten out of ten would recommend,” Bucky drawled. “Somethin’ you need, doll?” The tips of Tony’s cheekbones turned a dusky pink when Bucky referred to him that way, but it was Steve he was looking at when he replied.
“Get a little lost?” May teased.
a catch.” May reached and placed a hand on his forearm, tapping some kind of pattern that the kid seemed to recognize instantly. The exchange was small, but it gave Tony the time he needed to regroup.
Because Tony’s mind and body were contradictory right down to the cellular level, being given permission
Recalling Rhodey’s account of how the room had been made, his eyes found Bucky’s, begging for and trying to hide from an explanation he wasn’t yet ready to face. The other man stared back at him, gaze hooded and sharp. With no hint of the hesitation that had shaped most of their interactions outside of shared submissive headspace, Bucky reached out, taking one of Tony’s hands and leading him over to the chest of drawers to press his open palm down on top of the wood. Instinctively, Tony’s fingers spread, feeling out the shifts in the grain. Some were small and subtle; others, like the thick, dark growth ring under his index, drew attention to themselves, refusing to be smoothed away or made to match what was around them. The metaphor there was obvious, but Tony didn’t let his mind grasp for it, taking comfort instead in the simple material reality of love and care and attention that surrounded him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh please, you already have plenty of that. Anyone who has ever seen the two of you in public can see how gone you are for each other. No, listen. Tony is terrified of the bloodwork because he wants to know you’re really choosing

, coupled with the fierce, enveloping ache he’d left behind with the strap was impossible. Tony would never survive it. He thrashed and tugged at the leg straps, and against Rhodey’s hands, shaking his head frantically.
“That sounds fun, baby. What do you need to do first?”
“Same here—without the ankle, obviously. He and I and Bruce had a really intense scene that we wanted to let him recover and get a bit of distance from before we tried anything else,” Natasha confessed. Her hand was tracing the outline of the spot where one of her blades would be if she had her tac suit on, a sure sign that she was far more distressed than she was otherwise letting on.
“There were things you didn’t understand, Peter.”
“I think there are a lot of things about how all of this happened that many of us would likely change if given the chance,” Phil cut in. He sounded as smooth and even as ever, and Tony had maybe never been more grateful for the idea of having a handler than he was right now. “Certainly several people, myself included, owe Steve an apology for not hearing his concerns sooner. Those conversations are important, and should be prioritized. But in the interest of sorting out some of the most immediate and pressing concerns, I would like to turn our attention to how we might move forward from all of this. Tony, is it still your intention to leave following the press conference?”
Now, Steve was in fact grinning and humming showtunes under his breath even as Domen read the note aloud, which was somewhat damning evidence. But he was going to have stern words with Natasha for ratting him about the skipping thing.
Tony truly intended to let Steve leave him at the elevator door if that was what he wanted. Steve liked to take things slow, he knew, and tonight had been so intense on a number of levels already. Stepping back was the smart, responsible way to play this, to make sure they didn’t end up going too far too fast. Sure, the thought of Steve actually leaving kind of made his skin crawl, but at least letting him go for tonight meant Steve would probably be more inclined to come back sooner, right? And maybe in the meantime Tony could convince Rhodey to come snuggle him and 'accidentally' fall asleep in his friend's lap.
“Well I’m not, I didn’t mean healed, per se,” he sputtered, hurt and a little embarrassed. “But I mean, I’m good with the team, good with Tony. I might even--I mean, I’m thinking about asking to maybe be included in their relationship with him after all.”
“James, can you come home like yesterday? I’m pretty sure that the fact that we haven't fucked yet is some kind of human rights violation.”
Steve woke early the next morning, like always. Lazing in bed, drifting in and out of consciousness just long enough to press lazy kisses or extra blankets onto the body next to him, that was another indulgence belonging only to Before Steve, that other version of him who had taken as much pleasure in these quiet moments of domestic intimacy as he did the most intense of scenes. Clint, however, was snoring away contentedly, and Steve still had a duty to right by the archer. So he prepared a simple but filling breakfast of toast, bacon and hash browns, the ones cooked in bacon grease that Clint coveted above all other breakfast foods.
This chapter is set during the evening of Tony's day off, which took place during chapter 49.
“That’s convincing,” Bucky opined, seizing the opportunity to steal a handful of caramel corn from the bowl in Sam’s lap. For once, Sam didn’t bother rising to the bait.
“What—”
“It’s not…that’s not what Pepper meant,” Steve sighed. "Something happened to trigger this, something clicked for him when we were at SHIELD together. It does concern me that he took off like that, but it’s not like that’s totally unprecedented when he has genius moments.” The others nodded their agreement with varying levels of exasperated fondness in their expressions. “But I think Pepper, and I would agree with her here, is more concerned with the fact that it feels like he’s almost regressing. Refusing to come out of the shop or let anyone else in, probably not eating or sleeping much, forcing JARVIS to lie to us—”
“No?” he guessed.
Less than five minutes later, he was deep in stage one.
It could only be adrenaline carrying the guy through. Stark had fought the same battle they had, after all, and that didn’t even account for his journey to space and subsequent near-death experience. (A vision of Tony falling through the sky, falling just as Bucky had fallen...Steve shook his head, trying to ward it off. Tony wasn’t Bucky, goddammit.) He would crash any minute now, and the more energy he expended fetching Diet Cokes and tahini, the less likely he was to make it home before he did. Finally, Steve couldn’t take it anymore. He barked,
“And is it okay if I check in with JARVIS about yesterday’s food intake?”
“I apologize for intruding,” he greeted Steve. “I required your attention without our submissive, and as you are rarely apart these days, I chose to act when I could.” Steve was rapidly leaving the 'mildly' part of 'mildly concerned' behind, his mind already spinning potential options for the source of Thor’s upset even as he sat down on the bed and patted the spot next to him.
“Good. Keep that in mind please, then, and use it if you need to. For right now you and I are going to have a little conversation, and you’re going to remember to answer just the questions I’m asking you, and that you are
At this, Peter couldn’t help but snort. If there was one thing he’d assumed someone like Steve would understand it was that there was no way to not end up isolated when you were like them. He’d tried to balance super-heroing and a normal life, and had managed only a few blissful weeks before Quentin Beck had turned Peter’s entire life upside down.
“I know, Mean Green.”
Forcing back the wave of pity that this realization caused, Peter focused his attention on the floor of the closet, where a heavy glass jug marked in an unfamiliar language sat. Whenever Thor came around, he always brought Asgardian liquor for Steve. Apparently, it was the only thing that worked on super-soldiers. Peter didn’t know for sure if he would have similar problems with metabolizing liquor, but he wasn’t going to take his chances. Not tonight. He hauled the heavy jug to his room and then pulled out his phone and opened the group text.
After the coffee meeting was finally, mercifully over, Tony found himself in a car with no clear direction to give the driver. He considered going back to the Tower, but he’d spent the last two days holed up there with Nat and Bruce, and that had been…intense.

“Stop telling me you can’t. The lack of faith you have in yourself borders on absurd, and it stops right here, right now. I’ll never ask you for anything I’m not one hundred percent certain you are capable of. If you truly think I’m wrong, you have your safewords, and you should always feel free to use them if you need to. Otherwise, you trust me, and you trust yourself, and you
“I’ve thought a lot about what I could do, what kind of gesture I could use to start scenes. I like the way Phil does it, but that’s him. It’s not me. I didn’t know what I could say or offer that wouldn’t seem trite or overly-sentimental. But I wanted you to know. I need you to know.”
The echo of Sunset’s earlier words combined with the vulnerability of the posture…that was probably about when things started to go downhill. But Tony wanted fiercely for this to go well for he and Steve. He’d put the guy through so much just to get here in the first place, for fuck’s sake, the least Tony could do was make it through a relatively simple scene without freaking out.
“Steve. I think I know what this is about,” Sam says, the gentle balm to Bucky’s aggression. Steve pushes down the horrible urge to laugh. (Oh Sam. I don’t think so.) “I know what happened with Peter was upsetting. But you really did a fantastic job handling it, you told me even May was impressed. You gotta let yourself off the hook for whatever build-up you missed leading up to it and just focus on now. What’s he up to today?”
Christine Everhart was not quite the last person Tony expected to see on an otherwise quiet Thursday morning, but she definitely cracked the top ten. SI’s above-board, weapons-free projects were all flourishing, and the Avengers’ last several missions had been flawless, beyond the reproach of even their most cynical critics.
“Definitely,” Steve agreed. “I could maybe draw it, too, if you want?”
“No.”
“I don’t hate him.” Bucky raised his eyebrows and crossed his arms across his broad chest. His posture had lost all of the loose easiness that subbing for Natasha had brought to it, and that sight on top of everything else made Steve ache all the more.
“I need hot dogs,” Tony announced upon entering, with all the severity of someone warning him of an imminent attack on the planet. Steve arched a brow.
Stephanie Wilson,
“I do.” He’d planned to just leave it there, but Steve had never been particularly good at holding his tongue. “But take it from a guy who spent the better part of two years stomping on the rewind button until the damn thing broke? The work of building something new and actually getting to just be in the present is worth it. I swear it is.”
He woke on board the Wakandan jet, and debated for less than a minute before placing the call. Natasha, per usual, seemed unsurprised to hear from him, though her voice betrayed more stress than she would normally allow to come through.
“We can keep adding to it as we figure out more of what you like,” Steve burst out eagerly. That seemed to break the communication dam with the rest of the team, and soon they were excitedly talking over one another, pointing out their contributions and their favourite details in the room. it overwhelmed Tony in the best of ways.
Their attitudes and responses toward kink are likely the biggest site on which they differ, and yet the area in which they are most similar as well. The previous Tony Stark, while classified as a True, also struggled constantly against that identification, to the point that it was occasionally difficult for both he and his partners to differentiate between what he disliked because he simply did not enjoy it, and what he disliked because he was ashamed to desire it. The MCU Tony has, of course, no such hang-ups given that the was not raised in his universe or by this version of Howard Stark.
“Can you at least tell me my options?” he tried. “If is it…I mean, I’ve been working with the assumption that I can’t return to my universe without screwing up all the things that sent me here in the first place. And now there’s the whole subtonin thing…is this whole choice thing really just academic?” Strange steepled his long fingers; as he considered his answer, a cup of what looked like perfectly-prepared coffee appeared next to Tony’s right hand. He swallowed it in two gulps.
“You always call the Witch by her first name,” Thor observed shrewdly.
“If anyone here is being babysit it’s me, Talia. Though I’m glad to hear you visited a Dom.” And it was true. The woman was definitely still pissed, eyebrows furrowed and lips pursed, but the painfully tight, strained look her features always started to take on after too long without subspace was gone. She knew it, too, because she didn’t even bother arguing with Steve beyond a soft snort, and the woman was the type to claim the sky was purple and not blue just for the sake of it.
Peter was halfway to the school’s main entrance, grateful, at least, that the day was finally over, when he remembered with a groan that he had one more stop to make. He pivoted on his heel, narrowly avoiding a collision with two senior girls. One glared poisonously at him; the other, someone he recognized distantly as a friend of Liz Toomes’, managed something closer to a sympathetic kind of grimace. (That one was worse, Peter thought. The last thing he needed was for people to start feeling sorry for him.)
As if the awkward gesture towards his surroundings reminded May that their reunion had an audience, she peered suspiciously around the room. Tony took a huge bite of his apple fritter and tried to appear as unthreatening as possible.
Even compared to everyone else in the present, Tony had always felt almost untouchably ahead of Steve. He’d always had a foot in the future, had struggled to slow down enough to truly be in the present even when he wanted to. Hell, the basis of half their scenes had involved Steve and the rest of the team trying to keep Tony grounded for even a few hours at a time. Steve had never expected to encounter a version of Tony who felt ignorant about
Steve still didn’t quite understand exactly what had gone on between Bucky and Tony the other night. The effects, however, had been clear and immediate. Tony had cheerfully adopted Bucky’s tireless stubbornness, and if his sudden and unprecedented appearance at Steve’s office was any indication, he was confident in a way he hadn’t been before, either. (Not to mention sneaky. He knew damn well that Steve couldn’t turn him away without raising eyebrows that they definitely didn’t want raised.)
love you—that’s not a lie. And as far as I’m concerned that’s as much as anyone else needs to know. When I agreed to the super serum I never once consented to giving up every shred of privacy I had, and nor did you or the other Tony when either of you became Iron Man. The thought that he could help, I don’t know, shield you from some of that, create a kind of barrier between us and the rest of the world, I find that kind of beautiful in a way. Like a gift you’d be giving each other.”
He briefly considered pulling up data on the team’s uniforms and trying his hand at some upgrades. He’d gotten a couple of ideas while watching their fights yesterday; while in some ways their tech seemed a bit more advanced than Tony’s own team’s gear, Mark II definitely hadn’t had the chance to get far with nano-tech, and there was just a world of possibility there. A thin coating of it over Barton’s bowstring, for instance, would greatly enhance the tensile strength. And since nanoparticles barely added any weight, he could probably add a few protective layers of it to the most vulnerable spots on Nat’s suit without facing complains about stiffness or reduced mobility. But that all felt…intimate, like something he should probably ask before he did. And Tony didn’t want to ask any of them anything when he still felt so off after the night before.
“If you want to punish me for not being him I guess that’s your prerogative. If you could just…give me a two hour head start or so? Before you tell the others I’ve left? Can you do that for me, at least, Ms. Potts?” He was unsurprised when the clicking of her heels started up again, and prepared for a slap or at least the shrill pitch of Pepper’s voice that only came out when she really, truly screamed. Instead, she planted herself directly in the middle of the path he’d been tracing around the shop and cocked an eyebrow.
“Is he already up in the penthouse, JARVIS?” Peter asks hopefully the second he steps into the private elevator.
But there was more to the kiss than that, so much more. There was an aching tenderness to Steve’s touch, the way he never let his weight come to rest too heavily on Tony’s chest, and how the same hands that had manipulated Tony’s position to Steve’s own exacting demands also seemed determined to cradle and shield his head. And every few minutes he pulled away from the kiss entirely to stare down at Tony for a few seconds. Each time Tony jarringly recalled what it had been have the universe in his grasp in his grasp, because Steve looked at him exactly like that, like Tony wasn’t just a bit of Soul Stone but the entirety of the multiverse held between his palms.
