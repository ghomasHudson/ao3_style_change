“Ooh yes yes yes. Sorry. Of course. We’re going in. Hold on, shouldn’t we wait to have someone send in the proper coveralls so we don’t contaminate it?”
“Yeah, but I’m not the nephew of the director of the Galleria Nazionale. I bet you listen to much more droning on about art than I do…or that even either of us would like,” Sergio quipped.
“I could, but I would have to investigate who the owner is first. Or we could go to our other suspect’s place and check if this one is back later. What do you prefer?” she replied.
Whatever he’d expected from this interview, it wasn’t for the girl to open the door, ignore the—uniformed—policewoman and screech, “Jooooohn! You came after all! And brought friends!!!”
“Mobile phones are annoying like that. But you know, if I was the type to believe in such a thing, I would think you’re psychic.”
"Apologies. I promise I'll take care of it, now we're on the same page. Speaking of same page... did I interrupt the muse?" John keeps getting closer with every word, and oh ...does he mean... really?
He clearly has something on his mind, something huge, and as usual it seems like something he has no inclination of letting John in on.
Rocks again, and again, and again, whines when he throbs against his own palm, and then rolls over onto his stomach, scrambles with the sheets, pulls his pillow down against his chest, pushes it down between his thighs, tries not to think too much about why, makes sure not to think of John when he thrusts against it, pumps his hand quicker, slicks the pillowcase with lube and his own pre-come.
It had shocked John to learn that Sherlock had been there before, because of him, and it had shocked him more that Sherlock had been willing to keep going—together.
All in all, it is a rather pointless jaunt across the city, and so he is more put out than he would usually be when he arrives back at his flat only to find his brother, Mycroft, seated in one of the chairs by the hearth.
“Like all of you, I’m just hoping he recovers well, isn’t in too much pain, and has someone to sit with him.
John favours the most sentimental pieces, and is always very responsive to them, whether he realises it or not.
Sherlock’s cheeks are flaming again, but he does as he’s told, lays down in only his pants, the usual silky blue ones he’s been favouring lately.
He knows when he’s ready to let it subside, as Sherlock is well past the middle of the chapter by now, and John feels sweetly sated, somehow, even though he’s still coming in wave after blissful wave.
But hollow, reaching, tugging, like the whole of his body is this great empty thing that only John can fill.
“What do you want?”  Sherlock sees the question catch John by surprise.  “What did you want, just before we stopped?”
But John is dipping down to kiss the chin in question and Sherlock feels some of his mortification drain away.
“Want more.”  John presses down a little more, stops, and then relaxes, taking Sherlock’s fingers all the way in.  He settles, breathes, and then his hand finally begins to work Sherlock’s cock again.
“Talked about Dad and Mum, talked about Mary, and Harry, and—and me and you, and when I got out of there, I just—I just drove.
He had known that he missed this, John’s regular presence by his side on cases, but now that John is here, arranging transportation, lodgings, ensuring that they are fed, Sherlock realises just how great the hole was that John left when he’d decided to live a more solitary life.
Sherlock goes down and checks the front door, goes upstairs and checks on Rosie, who is sound asleep, then he comes back down and shuts off the gas to the fire, and the lights in the flat.
His fingers are digging into Sherlock’s hips and arse so hard he’s sure it will leave a string of lovely bruises, and the thought of it simply turns him on more.
He does it again, and watches John’s lips part, and when he reaches the top of John’s thighs the fourth time, he sweeps his thumbs in a crescent along the soft skin between them, and watches a slight bulge begin to form beneath the cotton of John’s pants.
The anger and bitterness had begun to be too heavy a burden, and no matter how painful the thought of his feelings never fully being returned may be, it’s still easier to bear than the rage, regret and self-loathing.
He didn’t feel anything leaving the cramped little flat behind and when his cab had finally turned the corner onto Baker Street, he had let out a sigh of relief.
He texts Sherlock the details, doesn’t get a response, leans back in his seat, and tries desperately not to think about the day before.
John looks over at his suspiciously acquiescent patient, sitting and sipping his tea innocently, and narrows his eyes.
But there had been a bloke with long, flowing hair, a plum velvet jacket, and a sleek, black cat sharing her flat the one time he and Harry had gone to see her.
Over time he’s learned to turn a wary eye toward anything or anyone who is overly passionate, but still…
And John kisses him again, because he wants to, because Sherlock has John’s hand still pressed against his abdomen, and their foreheads are pressed together, and Sherlock looks gorgeous, smells incredible, and John still finds it hard to believe that this is his life, that Sherlock wants him,
He traces a finger over the texts they had exchanged earlier that morning, scrolls up, hesitates on:
It puts Sherlock in a foul mood, because they wasted a better part of a day with no progress (save John’s suggestion on where to start the next day), and with the headmaster already champing at the bit it’s an unpleasant thing to have to tell him they’ve come up short.
They are nearing the end of the time indicated on the invitations, and Mrs. Hudson is bundling up children and handing them bags of sweeties before sending them off, when Sherlock looks around and realises John is nowhere to be found.
He remembers how fortunate he’d felt when Victor had started to seek him out, how it made the year easier.
He reaches out for the countertop with one hand, and for the top of Sherlock’s head with the other, fisting curls, and gently easing Sherlock’s head back so he is looking at him.
She’s exhausted by the time they’re done and falls fast asleep against Sherlock’s ribs on the cab ride back to Acton.
John presses another kiss to his spine, and another, moves his body a little, let’s Sherlock get used the feel of their bodies close in this way, gives himself time to relax, to feel all the little tells in Sherlock’s body, the way his thighs tremble, even though he’s not putting any strain on them, the way he’s tense all over, clearly prickling with desire, but underneath it all, something else less pleasurable.
Like a man standing at the threshold of a great cathedral, awed, ecstatic in the perceived presence of his god, and if that isn’t the most flattering thing, then…
Perhaps he’d been a disappointment, and this is Sherlock’s way of saying, ‘Sorry mate, made a mistake, let’s just put the brakes on.’
There was a time, only a few days prior, really, where John was still anxious, tense and alert, even in his sleep, but not anymore.
Sherlock reaches the trees on the far side of the garden and takes cover behind one, leaving John out in the open to take volley after volley of fire.
He reaches out and finds Sherlock’s head, fists his fingers in his hair, and pulls his head back, away from his neck even as he arches his back off the tile and thrusts his cock against Sherlock’s.
“Right.”  John begins to eat again, a little more quickly than before.  His movements are precise, measured.  There is a tension there.  Anticipation.  Arousal.  The eagerness to move on from one order to the next.  Sherlock can’t help but feel the tingle of anticipation himself.
Did he have friends, was he involved in activities outside his lessons, or was he a solitary child?”
Spent all his time at school, at the library studyin’, away from the house, then uni in London, then the army…”
“John…  John.” He takes John’s upper arms in his hands, and feels John still, chest heaving, as he pants against Sherlock’s neck.  “Bed?”
He scans through his text history and stops on the text he’d received from John earlier in the day saying he was running late.
John can see the sheep grazing in the field beside the lane, and sure enough, when they see him, they begin to trot toward the fence.
“I know it means something to you—helping people, whether you’ll admit that or not, and I’m dead proud of you for it, too, just so you know.
One of John’s hands lifts from Sherlock’s hip, comes to rest on his upper arm, slides slowly down, and falls away again.
When he gets back to the bedroom, Sherlock is standing beside the bed stacking together some of the empty food containers.
He pulls closer until their bodies are fully flush, and he can feel that Sherlock is as warm as he is, sleep soft, and pliant.
still ill, and he had no business getting down on his knees on a cold stone floor just to give John the pleasure and release he hadn’t even realised he had been craving, but isn’t that just Sherlock all over the last few years.
When he does finally return to the garden it is with a steaming mug of tea in one hand, and crocheted blanket draped over one arm.
Sometimes he lifts a brow, or frowns, or clears his throat if Sherlock isn’t being as solicitous as he might.
They’re essentially hidden from sight where they are, not even their nearest neighbour could see them, but they’re still outdoors, a canopy of bare-limbed trees clacking overhead in the wild wind, snow swirling around them in icy clouds, and something about it just seems to add to John’s excitement.
The tone is light, conversational, nothing to indicate the weight and utter mortification of what has just happened.
He’s wearing a dark blue shirt that makes his skin of his upper chest and throat glow with the contrast.
He barely makes it to the loo, and somewhere in the back of his mind he registers the fact that John Watson has just said that he would like to have an intimate physical relationship of some kind, with him, that it might just be the luckiest moment of his life, and now, true to form, he has utterly ruined his chances by turning around and being violently ill.
It’s a matter of pride, almost, knowing that he can provide for him and Rosie, that he’s not burdening Sherlock with that, at least.
“You have to believe me, if I’d had any idea all the cards were about to come tumbling down, I never would have—I would have kept my distance from you, I wouldn’t have dragged you into my life, into all this.”
“I mean, you will speak plainly.  I will speak plainly. Orders will be clear.  Obeyed without question. No games.”
Sherlock shifts beside him, lays down, reaches out, and pulls John against him, arms slipping under and around, wrapping him up, tucking John’s head under his chin.
All there is is the tension building in his belly, the white hot, curling ache that builds and builds as John’s mouth works a kind of magic around him.
D.I. Lestrade mumbles around a mouthful of doughnut, as he leans back in his desk chair, doughnut in one hand and paper coffee cup in the other.
He steps forward and slides his jacket over his shoulders, laying it on the end of the bed, before starting to unbutton his waistcoat.
Redbeard is gone and never coming back, but he can’t help what he feels, and when he looks at the those amber glass eyes, staring at him across the dusty expanse of the office, golden with late autumn light, and lined with old books filling the space with the scent of benzaldehyde, vanillin, toluene and ethyl benzene, he yearns to gather him up and draw him close with an ache so fierce it almost registers as pain.
John who somehow, inexplicably looks ten years younger than he did two years ago, who no longer seems to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders, John who reaches up, and slides a hand around the back of his neck, and pulls him down into one of the deepest, sweetest kisses Sherlock can recall, in front of a room full of people, for the first time.
John’s finger drops.  He takes a step back. His head tilts to one side as though expecting a blow, but he doesn’t say ‘stop’.
Thus satisfied, he pulls back the sleeve of Sherlock's shirt and scowls down at the fresh track marks.
He takes the pushchair and wanders off to a bench a short way away, and Sherlock looks down at a red-faced and exhausted Rosie.
By the time they get back to their room, all Sherlock wants is a long, hot shower, and to go to bed.
And Sherlock?  Sherlock still itches for stimulation when he has been still for too long, and still shuts down from overstimulation when things get too intense.  He still struggles to vocalise the important things, to remember to ask or tell John things before he acts. But the two of them are getting better—together.
Sherlock can see things settling, behind John’s eyes, in the lay of his body, in the way his fingers stir at the placket of Sherlock’s shirt.
He sits up, swings his legs over the side of the bed, and slips off the condom, tying it off neatly, before getting to his feet.
Cleverer than he appears, a bit bristly, rather poor communication skills at times, but clearly makes an effort at being kind.
Sherlock starts to pick at his food, and John goes back for the rest, decides to climb up onto Sherlock’s bed and have a proper picnic.
He’s guarded his heart, and kept everything, all his fondness, all his love, all the yearning, aching desire, locked down tight.
Sherlock is surprised at how affected he is, how his lust seems to feed off of John’s, and John’s off of his, a surging, heated ouroboros of desire.
A huge thanks to Ariane DeVere whose amazing transcript of The Great Game made this chapter infinitely easier to write.
Sherlock is breathing hard, like he’s just run a marathon, and maybe he has in a way, maybe they both have.
And John thinks that Thing One and Thing Two should maybe get their act together, their plan synched, but he does look up, catches Sherlock’s eye and nods.
Forgiveness he never deserved, but he swore over a year ago that he would do his utmost to make that up to him, and he’s tried, god help him.
He enjoys her company, if he’s honest, and she’s always full of stories about John which he finds enjoyable too.
The clouds rolling in from the sea are heavy and dark grey, plunging everything into an artificial dusk.
John clicks send, and then slams the lid to his laptop and tosses it to the end of the bed, before lying back down and having a furious wank.
He holds his breath, and then lets it out in a long, loud sigh of contentment, when John folds his fully clothed body against his.
To his credit, John holds his gaze, even though his cheeks continue to flame, even though his eyes look full and slightly terrified, even though his hands tremble slightly against the mattress beside his thighs.
And just for the record, no matter what happens, I think—I think I want to have the chance to at least try.”
The blackness at the end of the corridor seems to shudder and move, and then, without warning, it dissipates like the dissolving of a morning fog, leaving the shadow of the man clearly visible.
Sherlock goes to the bedroom and sets the tea down on the nightstand on John’s side of the bed, and then lays on his back, stares at the ceiling, and listens to John vomit some more.
Sherlock’s hands reach the top of John’s thighs again, and John’s mouth drops open, his hips roll, and he lets out a small, breathy grunt, like he’s had the wind unexpectedly knocked out of him.
Sherlock briefly wonders if the gesture might qualify as a date in John’s mind, and then stuffs the thought down deep.
He feels Sherlock grin against the skin of his belly, before sliding lower, letting John’s cock brush against his cheek, and burying his nose in the thatch of dark blonde hair at John’s groin.
Sherlock looks slightly stunned, but John presses up and kisses him anyway, soft, and chaste, until he feels Sherlock’s body catch up with his brain, and he kisses back.
“Paddigton Thtathon.” Sherlock orders as he gets in himself, sounding much less intimidating with his stuffy nose and the lisp that always seems to appear with exhaustion or illness.
“If you think that what I felt for Teddy was anything like what you feel for him, then you don’t have the first idea what it is to love another human being.”
He shivers, and Sherlock rubs the pads of his fingers over his scalp, in slow, infuriatingly pleasurable circles.
John’s hand shoots out, presses against the centre of Sherlock’s chest, over the scar left there by the woman he’d married as punishment.
He likes them that way, and lucky for him, that had been precisely the sort of girl you met in med school in the nineties.

He can feel how he fits neatly in Sherlock’s cleft even though there is the thin cotton of his pants, and the thin cotton of Sherlock’s pyjamas between them.
John shakes his head and crosses his arms over his chest, lifting one hand to squeeze at his bad shoulder.
John tells him it’s got to be staged, that they should be admitting the kid to psychiatric care, which doesn’t go over very well at all.
They’ve made love a handful of times the last year, each time as revelatory and breathtaking as the last, but it’s not something either of them seems ravenous for regularly.
Worse yet, the fierce biting in his eyes makes him think that maybe he’s going to cry, and he has no idea why.
I’m trying to help you understand your reactions to him touching you, I assume you meant with tenderness, in moments of physical or sexual intimacy?”
Sherlock’s cheeks are scarlet red, and his hands are shaking as he attempts to work the small buttons into place.
It takes a little doing to get the ring over Sherlock’s knuckle, but once he does, it fits perfectly, and he’s rather pleased with his own deductive skills at guessing the size.
He stops to suck in air, to try to push down all the things he hadn’t even realised were still stirring, just waiting for a tiny crack to come rushing out, to drown him, to destroy him again, just when he’d been doing so well, so well…
It all happens so quickly that Sherlock hardly gets a chance to take in the sight of John’s generous cock, long and thick, even when flaccid, deceptively large given John’s height.
It’s heady and wonderful the way John’s whole body lights up, wakes up, as Sherlock’s body moves against his.
Outside it is raining, a soft patter against the single-glazed windows, and a distant staccato on the chimney pots.
There were a few years afterwards where I thought it was the worst day, but still—still, deep down I knew that I was better for having known you than not.
Sherlock feels a surge of panic.  He’s lost.  He knows what it all looks like, but to presume now, would be potentially…  “John, I…”
Sherlock buries his face in John’s arse again, his tongue gliding slow, and methodical, until he finds John’s hole with the tip again, and presses.
Sherlock is panting hard, now, and John can hear the rhythmic rustle of sheets as he strokes himself.
“No, though he is the one who contact the Met, which I gather the father of the boy isn’t too pleased about.
He curses himself as he curls up small under the covers and tries not to think about how perfect the evening had been, and how very much he’s just…
On the fourth day, the sun comes out, warm, almost like Spring again, and he thinks maybe he’ll brave the tube and go back to Regent’s Park.
Well everything does, but especially the ability to keep thoughts of John from his mind, the memory of his smile, his laugh, the light in his eyes, and crinkles in the corners when he had only last night said:
“Which is what I’m sure your wife would have said if she could have seen you and your secretary in your office just before you came here for lunch.
Tears spill over before he can stop them, and it’s fucking inexcusable, embarrassing as hell to be like this, in the face of this.
He stirs a little, to let John know he is awake, and John sniffs, and grows quiet, but doesn’t pull away.  His shoulders still shake.
You were standing right there in that open square, and they could have taken you out at any time, and in that moment I had to make a decision.
And Sherlock sits, and he waits, and he’s holding his breath, must be, John thinks, because the only sound in the loo is the buzz of the fluorescent light over the sink, and the hushed fizz of the bubbles in the bath slowly dissolving.
His eyes snap back to John, and suddenly he is striding toward him, dropping to his knees, hard, on the tile floor, and reaching for John’s clothes.
“I wanted you every minute of every day I thought you were lying six feet under the cold hard ground.
The video begins with a shot of the now familiar black, leather chair, and after a moment a set of legs appear, hop up onto the seat, and then the man himself sinks slowly into a cross-legged, sitting position, facing the camera.
He twines his legs with Sherlock’s again, starts to touch him, a slow, soft surge of John’s body against his, a slide of fingers through his hair, down his neck, down his spine, the mingling of breath, a press of lips, slide of tongue, until Sherlock is melting against him, until he’s almost forgotten what it was he was so eager for a moment ago.
It’s when John lets out a sound, half growl of frustration, half whimper of desperation, that Sherlock comes back to himself, and decides to do something about it.
More a simple, firm reminder, underpinned always with the aura of fondness that seems have settled over John like an ever-present glow.
Sherlock thrusts into the ring of John’s fist by way of answer.  He’s not sure he trusts his voice at the moment.
Maybe you can feed her after I’m done here, and I’ll shower, then when I get out, I’ll put her down and you can do what you need to do?”
John stops in the middle of the room and looks around himself like he’s trying to figure out what to do.
Sherlock turns in John’s arms, effectively pushing him down to the mattress, and moulds their bodies together.
The wind picks up outside, sending the lace curtains at the window billowing into the room, and up over the bed.
Wednesday night he gets all the way to the front door of the flat, and is shrugging into his coat, about to hit send on a text to Bill Wiggins when Mrs. Hudson comes out in the foyer and says she can’t sleep, says she’s made some cocoa and won’t he come help her drink it.
John is shocked at the surge of adrenaline that courses through his veins and leaves an all-encompassing heat in its wake.
He opens his mouth, desperate that John not feel he doesn’t want this, doesn’t want him, but nothing will come, and John looks even more worried.
It’s a risk, a big one, but as far as affectionate gestures go, he wagers it’s a fairly innocuous one.
Mrs. Hudson does tidy, as do Molly, and Greg, and the single mother who had tipped Sherlock off about the nursery bully earlier in the day.
He kisses, and kisses, and kisses until John loses all track of time, all sense of place, until he tumbles headlong into the velvety, honeyed heat of Sherlock’s mouth, surrounded, held, and wonders, for the briefest of moments, if he really did die in that pool and all of this is some bizarre and beautiful dream wrung free from his brain in it’s last, stuttering, gasping moments.
Sherlock walks close enough to be touching the whole way back, and he is remarkably obedient and docile, eating the toast John makes him, drinking the chamomile tea, and even slipping into the warm bath John runs him, as long as John promises not to go too far.
Mrs. Hudson is already dressed, already has Watson fed, and her hair pulled up into two curly bunches with bows that make her look like an exceptionally pampered poodle.
I was three or four, I think, and come to think of it, I’m not sure how much I actually remember, and how much of it is what Harry told me, but I refused to eat my veg, and so he hit me up the back of the head every time I took a bite of something other than peas, and then finally shouted at me to eat or there would be hell to pay.
Tutting like John is a misbehaving child, and John struggles a little, because he wants to, because it feels like Sherlock wants it, and Sherlock only smirks down at him.
And John pushes that thought away, pushes it down deep, because it’s accurate, probably, and he doesn’t want to think about that, about how much he deserves this, how much he had it coming.
He’s had to be sure he doesn’t seem too eager, doesn’t pressure him, doesn’t give him a reason to leave again.
He’s changed, it’s true—nasolabial folds are deeper, corners of the mouth starting to draw down, flesh under the chin softening.
Sherlock sighs, and shrugs out of his coat, tosses it on the floor in the hallway before walking through the door into the loo.
And we’ve only known one another a couple of weeks, I know that, and I know this is mad, I know I’m probably coming across like a real creeper, but I—I just want to be near you—all the time,” he finishes in a fierce whisper.
The tears in Sherlock’s eyes spill over, and John reaches down to thumb them from his cheeks.  “Come on, then.  I’ll even let you use my sandalwood bathbomb.”
“I seem to remember you saying something about it being more dangerous and crime-ridden than the city.”
He rolls over twice until he’s on his side of the bed, and fumbles around in the nightstand for some tissue and a bottle of lube so old he has to check the expiry date.
It doesn’t take them long to reach the twin villages of Friston and East Dean, And John turns left off of the the A259 at a small, country church, and onto a gravel lane.
It makes him feel useful, desirable, wanted—still—even though he’s not as quick as he was a thirty-three, now he’s forty-three.
John is sitting in the middle of his bed, photos spread out in front of him.  Photos from his army days. Dusty, tanned young men in uniform, stretches of desert, what looks like the inside of an army hospital, nurses, doctors, a photo of a man Sherlock recognises as James Sholto, John’s old commanding officer.
It’s possible the boy ran off to be with his mother in Italy, though there doesn’t seem to be any evidence of it so far.”
After a few more minutes of things clattering against the vanity in the loo, Sherlock reappears in doorway to the bedroom.
“I imagine it doesn’t require saying, Watson, but your father and I missed you quite a lot when we were gone.
John pales and then flushes purple, the vein in his forehead distended and pulsing with barely repressed rage.
He waits until he’s back in the confines of his own flat before fishing the phone out and looking at it.
Perhaps he has been selfish today, pushing, forcing the issue just to get John to stop talking about Sherlock deserving someone, needing someone, to stop talking about how he’s done with marriage, with relationships, how it’s just him and Rosie now, how he’s content with that, to stop saying it like it’s a life sentence.
Sherlock watches his throat bob, and new tears spill over, one’s John doesn’t bother to tend to this time.  He lies down and tucks in close. He waits.
They’re nearly face-to-face, with John perched on the sagging edge of the mattress, and Sherlock kneeling there, propping himself up with hands gentle on John’s thighs.
His cock is a hard, twitching, bulge in the front of his trousers, and Sherlock wants to see him come undone.
He kisses back right away, and John thinks that he might be willing to do that and only that, for as long as they’re both given, because Sherlock is a bloody good kisser for someone who supposedly has had little to no experience.
And when he says nothing, “John you’ve had my cock in your mouth, I’m fairly certain that nothing you say now could surprise me.”
His solution to handling it was to tell me that it had gotten away from him, and I should handle it, and we all saw how that worked out.”
He shivers, and John must notice, because the hand that had just retreated, returns to the top of his head, stays there, a comforting weight, John’s fingers tangled lightly in his hair, his thumb moving almost imperceptibly against his scalp in the smallest of caresses.
But when Sherlock somehow manages to push deeper, to curl his finger, just so, just as John is doing to him, John’s mouth drops open, and his eyes flutter shut.
When he comes back downstairs after putting her down, it’s to the sound of John vomiting in the loo.
John’s chest is heaving, cheeks flushed, his hair is sticking to his forehead in lank, sodden strands, and there is a vein straining against the usually smooth surface of his forehead.
It’s almost chaste at first, just a tentative, tender press of lips, and Sherlock frozen, his hands hanging by his sides, body rigid.
John turns to Sherlock, who cheeks are flushed, eyes glazed, and nods for him to shut the door to the cab.
My love for Francesca, for Arthur, it seemed an affront to him, and if I would not love him, and give him the life he saw as his, then I suppose he felt that Francesca and Arthur did not deserve that life, or my love either.
He sees Sherlock’s shoulders drop with relief, and his hand dips lower, knuckles grazing over his chest, over nipples peaked and hard beneath the thin fabric of his shirt.
He jumps and stares down at the paper envelope, before craning his head around to look up at Sherlock in question.
When he finishes, he dips the sponge in the water again, and wrings the water over John’s chest, watches his nipples peak beneath the flow, and his erection, which had been waning start to show interest again.
Sherlock grins, slides up his body, the whole length of him providing the most delightful friction, and when he lets his weight settle down on top of him, John knows it’s right, because it’s there, that feeling of calm, of safety, of everything aligning and clicking into place.  When Sherlock cups his face in one of his large hands, and dips down to kiss him, slow and sweet, he wants to let go, he wants to come undone, and he does.
Sherlock looks up from the table top, and John sets the glass down, leans back to grip the edge of the countertop with both hands.
Like he’s never had a kind word in his life, and Sherlock’s small crumbs light up something hungry and desperate inside.
Sherlock presses back in his chair a little as John advances on him, suddenly, mouth a straight, tight line, the now familiar vein in his forehead pulsing, and pushes a finger under his nose.
And when Sherlock pulls away, he gazes down at him, and strokes a hand up the length of John’s spine, and down again, and then pulls him close.
His eyes are red-rimmed, confused, but also filled with something that looks a great deal like hope.
It’s frantic, and desperate, and hotter than anything John can recall, the way Sherlock wanks and jerks them both, fast and hard, desperate to get them off before Rosie wakes up fully and demands attention.
The risks are still there.  The spectre of Moriarty still looms.  John’s leg still aches and grows stiff in the damp weather, he still wakes with a cry some nights, still trembles at times, when they come together, even though their intimate explorations have grown more frequent and more daring since they returned from Scotland.
It’s more beautiful than he could have imagined, seeing John finally let himself go, let himself chase his pleasure, spill into his own pants, wet, and hot, and utterly gorgeous.
Perhaps not the wisest use of their funds, but what is the point of money if one can use it to spoil the people they love.
He heads back downstairs, and gathers up their breakfast dishes from the lounge, taking them into the kitchen.
The rather appropriately named Mort, simply raises a trembling hand to his lips, and chews at the hangnail on his thumb.
It’s a bit like sex—everyone likes something different, and it’s just about finding out what you like and don’t like, and sometimes that takes time and experimentation.
John heads for the loo off the bedroom, and Sherlock pulls down a tin of tomato soup, and sets to making toast.
She ignores him, as she always does, moves into the kitchen, puts the bag on the counter, putters about clearing the table of the dirty dishes from that morning’s breakfast.
One of John’s hands is at his hip, it inches down, between their bodies, and Sherlock thinks he can deduce its intended destination.
He lets his head fall back against the pillow with relief, lets his eyes slide shut, and there is John again, waiting for him, cheeks flushed, straddling him on the bed, thrusting into Sherlock’s hand, his thick cock sliding along side Sherlock’s, over Sherlock’s palm, and he’s making the most beautiful sounds.
Sherlock both does and doesn’t know what it exactly is he’s suggesting, but he’s said it now, and it’s left hanging between them, ball in John’s court.
Leona shows up this morning, a very attractive woman, a woman he obviously was acquainted with when in Afghanistan, and it’s only natural he should—have a reaction.
He lets his fingers stir against Sherlock’s palm, and Sherlock lifts his other hand to cover John’s over, to shelter his bruised and bloodied knuckles in the warm cage of his hands.
And Sherlock could only shrug.  But his brother had been right for once.  Something was different. Something had settled.
His eyes fill, shimmer above John’s until a single tear breaks free to splash down on John’s cheek, and then Sherlock gasps, makes a sound somewhere between a moan and whimper, and goes rigid.
He heads straight for the loo, and shuts himself in before John even has a chance to ask if he’s alright, which was coming, Sherlock is quite sure, as John had been ridiculously, almost irritatingly attentive over supper, pressing his foot against Sherlock’s under the table whenever someone said something irrationally stupid, or refilling Sherlock’s wine glass whenever it’s level went down even the slightest, even nudging the back of his hand against the outside of Sherlock’s thigh when he could sense things about to get heated.
John looks pained for the briefest of moments, but then he sniffs again, and sits back in his chair with a scowl.
He shrugs into it, moves the laundry from the washer to the dryer, and goes to check on the mattress.
But in the end, they wrap it all up by publicly exposing the company’s nefarious plot in the same manner they had trapped Melas.
“I seem to remember you saying something about it being more dangerous and crime-ridden than the city.”
He gets up, considers going out, gets halfway to the door and realises he doesn’t know where he would go, where he would even start looking.
“What is this?”  He’s standing in the doorway to the kitchen.  He’s looking at Sherlock, frenetic, buzzing at 6:00 am on a Saturday morning.  He knows what it is.  He knows.  But he needs to hear him say it.
John hoists himself out of the tub, surprised his shoulder doesn’t give its usual twinge, and then reaches out a hand to help Sherlock out as well.
And if I were to search this flat, right now, are you telling me that I wouldn’t turn up even the slightest little sweetie?”
Two days after she began her plotting Sherlock had shown up in John’s room in the wee hours of the morning looking, from the bags under his eyes and the wild state of his hair, like he had been up pacing half the night.
The pleasure is sharp and sudden, and he groans loudly, and then runs his hand through the precome on his hip and belly and wraps his hand around his flagging erection, gives a tentative stroke, and groans again.
John who is subconsciously rubbing a hand along his thigh, self-soothing the pain, the trauma Sherlock’s words are stirring up.
He traces a single finger lazily over the surface of the tea table beside his chair, and then rubs the pads of his fingers together, before dropping his hand to his lap with a deep sigh.
He takes in the sight of John’s sincere and slightly troubled eyes, the way he holds his body at attention, alert.
Sherlock has seen it, admired it, submitted and yielded in the face of it, but now he has John close, feels that tension pressed against him, contained, all but vibrating with the need for release, he wonders what John might look like, feel like, were he to ever come wholly undone, not in a moment of desperate, broken rage, but raw, vulnerable, open instead.
And that is when John swoops in, presses deep, sucking, sloppy kisses to Sherlock’s neck, and starts to palm him in earnest.
He’s injured trying to protect his mother, and she dies anyway, abandons him, and his father remarries, and then suddenly there’s a wife, and a baby, essentially taking his father away too, and Jack is left alone, wholly alone.”
It’s little moments like these, where the words drop so easily and casually from Sherlock’s lips, that still take him by surprise, and please him to no end.
And Sherlock sits across from him and nibbles at his food, occasionally rubs the side of his foot against John’s under the table, and generally beams.
“Which is precisely what you should be doing.”  Sherlock’s head jerks up at the sound of his brother’s voice.
“Do you have any physical or mental health conditions you would be willing to report?” Sherlock fills in for him.
But it does worry him sometimes, in still quiet moments in the dead of night, when he would usually turn to a good wank to calm him down and sleep.
He sees Sherlock understand, gives him an almost imperceptible nod, and then tenses, ready to spring the second Sherlock gives the signal.
There’s something about having gone to Van Coons apartment, and him being dead in the middle, but then more prattle about violin concertos, and the works of John Locke, and something about a rare cat from Borneo called pardofelis badia.
His phone vibrates in his pocket, and he pulls it out, looks at the alert from his bank, and then thumbs open the app.
His leg lets out a twinge, as though suddenly remembering itself, and he hurries back in and grabs it before heading out again.
After rolling up the cuffs of his shirt, he crosses his legs, and leans forward, elbows on knees, chin resting on the heel of one hand, and stares out at the scenery.
The pushchair does come in handy, as Rosie starts off strong, skipping and practically running to Regent’s Park, but has all but worn herself out by the time they finish standing in line, and get through the front gates.
“Hand picked so it puts less stress on the fibres, leaves them straight and intact. Longer fibres mean better yarns, and stronger, softer cotton.”
He records some snippets of video, for his vlog on the way: a bit on the tube, walking down Baker Street, a quick bite in Speedy’s cafe, with violin music floating down from above.
When you came back I thought I hated you, but really, I think I hated myself for never seeming to find the courage I wanted to find.
It wouldn’t take Sherlock Holmes to deduce his girlfriend Barbara, in first year, or Beth in second, or what’s’-her-name in third.
And then John is moving across the room to the dresser, fishing through the top drawer, coming back with a white t-shirt.
Sherlock’s always been a bit loud, but he’s been exceptionally vocal since they’ve got to the cottage, and John is swiftly learning that it drives him wild.
Sherlock nods, arches his back, pushes back into John’s eager fingers, and lets his eyes slide shut.
Lestrade had called Molly Hooper, and they had both come over and set things to rights as best they could.
It takes him awhile to realise that it’s over, that Sherlock’s thumbs are rubbing small circles on the insides of his wrists, that he’s easing back against John’s thighs.
He groans a little, and rubs at his thigh, a psychosomatic pain which is yet another thing that has made an appearance since their last case.
After John has refilled his plate a second time, and added a log to the fire, he stabs a dumpling with his fork and speaks.
“Was thinking about how we met in a lab, how we almost ended in a morgue.  We always seem to do the big things in the bowels of a hospital.”
His mouth still feels too dry, and his kidney’s are offering up twinging protests of their own, but still he thinks he might be up for getting up and making the messy miracle of a man in his arms some breakfast.
John lets go of his hands, and it takes everything in Sherlock’s power to not snatch them back, press them to his cheek, his chest, his lips, to not say all the things he has been holding back for six years, all the things he is still holding back, may always be holding back.
He slides his lips down over John’s jaw, down his neck, back behind his ear, and John can feel him grin any time John’s cock gives a throb or twitch of interest.
Sherlock blinks up at him, cheeks flushed, eyes red-rimmed, burning with shame and gratitude all at once.
He wonders what the the next day will bring, or the next one, what it might be like to have John touch him the way he had just touched John.
And then John is pulling out, and pushing Sherlock back, scrambling about on the floor for the discarded lube, and then pulling him back in, plunging back in, three fingers this time, and the burn is exquisite, the slight, bright twinge of pain so delicious Sherlock moans loud, feels himself twitch and pulse around John’s fingers, and pull him deeper, as deep as his fingers will go, and somehow it still isn’t deep enough.
He thinks about their bodies slick with sweat, sliding and clapping together, thinks of John pressing Sherlock’s legs back, stroking the backs of his thighs, peppering them with kisses, burying his nose in Sherlock’s perineum and breathing deep.
And now, to top it all off, he’s fishing for—well, he doesn’t know what for, but the fact that Sherlock is taking it all in his stride, seemingly unbothered, seems a small miracle.
John can see his fingers slowly fidgeting, playing with the curls that no doubt have a home there, and John’s own fingers ache, and his own nape tingles.
A small wrinkle forms at the bridge of Sherlock’s nose.  John fights the urge to kiss it away.  “I do have everything.  This.  You.  Us.  That is everything, all I’ve ever wanted, and I’m bloody furious at myself for taking this long, and having it all happen like this, but it did happen.  Last night happened, and I have no regrets.”
It’s always helpful to know how people form associations, how that influences what gives them pleasure.
Sherlock nods, and then must register what’s just come out of John’s mouth, because he sucks in a giant breath, and then coughs a couple of times before striding into the room, snatching the small metal hook from off of his nightstand, and dropping to his knees at John’s feet.
Sherlock’s brows knit, as his lips pop off, and a bit of saliva dribbles from the corner of his mouth.
Though if James has already bolted, it is most likely to fetch Arthur, and I can only pray we aren’t too late.”
All Sherlock can hear is the soft hum of afternoon traffic outside, the occasional clatter of dishes in the cafe below, and the tick of the clock on the wall in the kitchen.
Mrs. Hudson is good enough to take Rosie when John leaves for Acton, and Sherlock lays on the sofa in the quiet flat, and thinks about John driving across town to sell his flat, the sad little flat that never quite felt homely, never quite felt like John.
“More,” John begs, and Sherlock is only too glad to oblige, pulling out further this time, and each time, realising all too soon that the pleasure building can’t be put off much longer.
John huffs, and then laughs, and Sherlock glances over at him, and then chuckles softly himself, some of the panic dissipating.
He actually falls out of bed, and Sherlock hurries around the side of the bed, only to find he’s stuffed himself in the small space between the bed and the nightstand.
There is the exchanging of rings, and Rose completes her duties as ring-bearer quite well, and totally without incident.
I met an old friend, Mike, in the park, and he told me about this weird YouTube channel run by a friend of his, and it probably sounds crazy, but I think it’s helping me.
And John doesn’t obey him this time, not exactly, but it’s alright, because his hips stay still, while his hands slide down Sherlock’s thighs, and back up again, slow, soothing strokes, and it helps, helps Sherlock relax enough to take John more easily.  He knows John must feel it, the moment his body lets go.
His mouth is lax, and his brows knit like maybe he’s in pain, just a little.  It’s possible with the way he’s sitting, kneeling over Sherlock’s body, but there is a long, hard bulge straining at the front of his trousers, so if it is pain, it might just be the sort John likes.
Sherlock swallows down a wave of emotion as the pounding of tiny feet approaches down the hallway, and then Rosie reappears with one of his old Biology textbooks in hand.
When you finally wanted to go and fetch Mary, when we came back, it—it was harder than I’d anticipated.”
He whines as it takes him, surprisingly powerful and drawn out, before he collapses atop John, face burning hot, buried in his neck.
There is the scrape of wood on linoleum, the soft pad of Sherlock’s feet behind him, and then a large, warm hand on his shoulder, and something square and heavy being dropped in his lap.
Christ, it hurts, because like an idiot he’s fallen in love, and it’s way too soon to be feeling things like that, but he’s in too deep to get out easily now, and he hates himself for it.
He’s dressed up a little: plaid button-down shirt, done all the way up to the collar, navy v-neck jumper pulled on over top, a pair of neatly pressed chinos with brown leather brogues to finish it off.
They’ve never done this before, never come anywhere close, and in many ways John is glad Sherlock is the one initiating it.
Sherlock buries his warm face into John’s cool neck, and relishes in the way John lets out a deep sigh, every ounce of tension draining from his body.
He shuts his eyes and breathes, feels the sting of the cold rain on his face, and hears the ping of it against the metal roofs of the buildings around him, he smells the petrichor, the old tyres, the tar, and he reaches.
The room is still stuffy, even with the window thrown wide and the bracing morning air washing in, and there is an overall atmosphere of what can only be described as oppression.
"I don't think it's wrong to be gay," John said, thinking to himself how accepting he could be of others while not turning the same light on himself.
It was idiotic. He should have seen the man swing at him, but somehow he didn't. And yes, he'd got the drop on the killer eventually, after sussing out the details of the case that had bothered him for weeks, but he'd done so with what he was sure was a broken rib or two.
God. God, the heat. Sherlock's body gripping him as tight as an angry fist and sliding down with fevered urgency. His fingers were really digging into those hips now as Sherlock settled in his lap and breathed a heaving sigh against his neck. He couldn't think, let alone move, as the slow rolling began.
"Ah," Sherlock breathed, taking the tissues in hand, "humor, even in the darkest of times. Even as I'm dying of boredom. Sweet John, sweet, sweet John."
Greg's heart raced and he licked his lips, appreciating how slowly Mycroft was taking things. "Want me to join you?"
He leaned forward again and pressed the button just left of the record button. The camera turned off.
"Are you going to eat?" Sherlock asked, taking a disgustingly large bite on purpose and grinning around it.
Throughout the day he found himself becoming aroused just thinking about the characters, and realised that as the embarrassment and shock wore off, he wanted to read more.
Sherlock glanced over, as if trying to figure out what on earth he was talking about, and then chuckled. "Oh, you mean the vicar thing."
Sherlock tossed a condom at John and opened the tube of slick, walking with purpose and straddling John's lap the second the condom was on.
John felt himself blush and took over the task of throwing the ball for Merrick, letting Sherlock lay and stare at the sky as he pondered whatever was troubling him.
Sherlock looked him over, tried to parse out what was keeping the man so surprising. It was as if he was rolling a particularly good sweet around on his tongue, lips pursed and mouth working slightly as he tried for a response. John, urged on by that, raised an eyebrow.
"Yes, ma'am. Very pretty indeed," the man replied as he rubbed the outside of the glass erotically, dipping his pointer finger in rhythmically.
"Ah, I see where the confusion comes in. They're often ANNUAL, these school years. I know it's difficult to follow, so if you like, we could come up with a mnemonic together," Sherlock answered brightly.
John huffed and leaned down to unlace his shoes, pulling his feet free of them and his socks and walking to the water's edge. "If I ruin my trousers I'll get a walloping from Mrs H."
"Oh, John," Sherlock said, leaning back and rolling his eyes, "your entire name was on it? It was the second thing that showed up in a search of your name. You put your picture on it. How many reasons do you want me to give before you admit it was meant for widespread consumption?"
There was a second where it really looked as if Sherlock was going to do as he was told, really, truly. John knew he was sunk in the next breath.
"Is that meant to be a compliment? Cause it's coming out quite shit," Jane replied, feathers ruffled to the Nth degree.
John was fine with that. Let the arsehole say he was incompetent. Seriously. It was what came next that turned the tables on his calm.
Sherlock said something in return and backed away. Jane had been so focused on what she thought was coming next, that the words didn't make it to her ears.
When Mycroft finally entered the room some fifteen minutes later Sherlock was in his chair, rocking it back and forth and sipping his best brandy.
"I'm serious," Anderson said. "We can do our jobs just fine without you traipsing around the crime scene."
The accident affected John when the injuries and deaths caused by the war only made him feel numb. He sees that as his failing to be human. He's worried he won't get over the accident.
"She came to me with a proposition," Sherlock explained, cleaning and drying John's hand. "She would let me copy her astronomy notes for the final if I found out whether or not her boyfriend was cheating on her. He was cheating on her and I told her as much. And you...you hit him. I'm sure that's worse than me telling her the truth."
Three hours later Sally and the group were properly sloshed and she was sitting in Greg's lap, arm tight around his neck and forehead pressed to his.
"I...like you," Sherlock murmured, eyes fixed on the screen. "You're smart and pushy. It's...I like you."
"Vicar Watson," he said, looking back around the corner as if he shouldn't take his eyes off Sherlock, lest he disappear.
John placed his hand back on Sherlock's bicep and rubbed his thumb in circles as he shushed him. And, damn it, it worked.
"I know," Greg said, pulling Mycroft's trousers down his thighs and leaning forward to tongue at his prick through silk pants.
"Remember to chew," John teased, setting the laptop on the floor and starting in on his own sandwich.
"Yeah, well, this is how you get me, love. Take it or leave it," Greg said as he picked his half empty beer back up and drank it down.
John snorted, and it hurt. "Me? I'm an out of work, recently divorced, middle aged man with a cane. Who in their right mind would want to live with me?"
When Mrs Hudson finally got the fire going properly and laid a kiss on Sherlock's head, she left the room. John swallowed and sat back in his chair, tea still too hot to drink.
The next few months were spent learning sign language and studying for school. They flew past without John getting the chance to speak with Sherlock about his concerns.
The dining room was set up unlike the bunks, with husband and wife sitting next to each other. John and Sherlock stood at the open door, out of sight.
Sherlock watched him do it, completely enthralled. That was usually the point when people wrote him off; criticizing something they care greatly about. John had even looked ready to do just that. How had he changed John's mind with just a small bit of back peddling? Had his position as a vicar made him more likely to forgive, or did that just make him a good vicar?
John, who had been reading the article over Sherlock's shoulder, was bright red by the time he'd finished. He swallowed roughly and sat back in his seat, clearing his throat. "I think people are reading a bit more into this than is, uh, uh, appropriate."
Sherlock felt himself smiling back, that soft, sweet smile of shared exhaustion. "Well, John," he replied, enjoying the name on his tongue, "I just happen to have the answer to the first issue."
There was a twenty-something waiting on the doorstep of 221 when Sherlock and Jane got there. Sherlock excused herself and spoke quietly to the girl for a few moments before taking an envelope from her and turning to unlock the door. Jane watched the girl leave uneasily. She was pretty and young, much closer to Sherlock’s age than herself, and the flip of Jane’s stomach had her scratching at her hand. Jealousy never looked good on Jane, and she was more than a bit surprised to have it raise its ugly head just then.
Once, when he was thirteen, he'd found an Army recruiter's pamphlet in a bin somewhere. Back then, that was where all pornography came from, as far as he was concerned; a bin, or his father's drawer. The things his father kept had never been of any interest to him, so imagine how he felt when he found out that it was the gender of the 'model' in question, and that he didn't even really need to see them naked to...well, the point is, the pamphlet excited him.
"Oh, bloody hell," John grumbled, standing again. "See, you got shot and now I've got to break tradition."
Jane hesitated and Sherlock rolled her eyes and held her hand out, as Jane had just done. Jane acquiesced and saw, for the first time, the mark there. It made her stomach lurch slickly and she felt a bit ill. She still had a bit of nerve damage, and it was unsettling whenever she was confronted with it.
John shook his head and went to put his jacket on. "Stop. I'm going for a drink. Not sure when I'll be back."
It only takes a second or two before John cries out, fists his hair, sobs into the quiet of the room and spills hot and thick over Sherlock’s tongue.
You’ll stay here with me and Sherlock, and then after Christmas is over we’ll go back home to London.”
“You and I are going to catch up later, you mark my word, but right now I think he needs to see you more than I do, so off you go.
He reaches behind himself and takes up the bottle of lube lying on the bed, and John sighs with relief, as he watches Sherlock dispense a little in his hands, rub it between his palms to warm it, and then…
Sherlock sighs, crawls over, turns around, folds himself in half and shoves his arse in John’s face.
And John lets Sherlock touch him, for the first time this way, lets him slide his hands down his back, over his arse, lets them settle there, warm and large, lets him pull their bodies closer, lets their half hard cocks settle and press bare against one another.
He had been doing well since the Culverton Smith case—calm, collected, and even starting, he thought, to find a sort of balance, an ability to care without the spectre of hyper-empathy that had haunted his youth coming back to haunt him.
John reaches under the futon and pulls out a pillow, gets to his feet and pulls the futon out into a bed, and then motions for Sherlock to make himself comfortable.
Sherlock’s hips arch up against him, the finger pressed up against John’s entrance, presses harder on instinct, and John gasps and then moans as he feels his body take Sherlock in.
Sherlock hisses, and then thrusts back hard, grunting in surprise when John’s second finger pops inside.
That includes not putting yourself in positions where you go off half-cocked, and get yourself into shit where I can’t help.”
The backs of John’s fingers whisper over the side of his shaft, and it’s a pleasant, sweet feeling, but then John seems to find his courage, and he rests the whole of his palm against it, and presses with a pressure that sends sparks flying over Sherlock’s skin and a thick, hot ache blooming in his centre.
Sherlock is filling his glass, and buttering some bread, and sliding it in front of him, and then filling his own glass in turn, before settling back in his chair.
After a moment he sits up in his chair again, and swivels the laptop on his desk so Sherlock can see the screen.
Sherlock does, and John slides his hand further still, slips a finger back behind Sherlock’s balls, and waits.
John sounds like he can hardly breathe, and Sherlock simply pulls back a little, hollows his cheeks and hums around John’s cock.
“You know, if I tie your wrists you’re not going to be able to pinch me, if you decide you’ve had enough.”
“Listen, I know we haven’t always been on the best of terms, and you’re panicking right now, so you’re going to be dick about this, but—I get it, okay.  He means something to you. Seemed a decent bloke from what I saw. You two deserve a chance to at least see. So, all of us here are going to do what we can—our best, okay.  So just—don’t give up. We’re nowhere near that point.”
John didn't know why that affected him, but it was easier to ignore the fact that it did and press on than to pick it apart.
"I, uh, think there are some stories that just need to be told," Jane choked out. "Your class looked like the most comprehensive."
At the end of class, Sherlock stopped her at the door and nodded towards her desk. She walked back with a sigh and waited while the other students left. When the door to the lecture hall finally closed for the last time, Sherlock leaned towards her with a grin.
Sherlock scrambled for something to say back, trying to think about what he'd written on the blasted index cards. He fumbled in his pocket, the sense memory bringing it back to him.
"I'm Mrs Hudson, by the way," the woman added as she went to leave. "I'm sure he forgot to mention that bit in the letters."
Sherlock stayed silent but took the cheese, chewing silently and looking up into the tree. John sliced some bread and made himself a half sandwich, then went about eating it.
Sherlock was so focused on John that it was his turn to speak before he realised it. He cleared his throat several times and then blurted out 'trust' before quickly going silent again. Sally said 'comfort' in that sickly convincing tone she'd taken on, and the circle went on.
Greg closed his eyes and listened as Mycroft left the flat without showering, then got out of bed and got ready for work. He would not cry over that heartless bastard again. Not one more bloody time.
John sighed and kissed the man's cheek gently before looking him in the eye. "Sherlock, you really thought I wouldn't be there?"
Sherlock walked into Lestrade's office and around his desk, the man in question looking at him like he was mad and trying to stand up.
Greg held his breath as he came down, letting his eyes remain closed as he waited for Mycroft to get up and clean himself with a rag at the kitchen sink before leaving. Instead, the man collapsed against him and breathed out a shaky sigh.
Sherlock stared at her, perplexed, and she tried to explain. "Sorry, sorry, it's just, you said that like you really thought I would do it."
John grinned and ran his tongue in a circle. Less than a minute suckling a him and Sherlock pulled at his hair and he sat back, panting, just in time for Sherlock to grasp the head of his cock and come into his handkerchief.
"Everyone in the world. You're my sweet one, aren't you? Aren't you?" John asked, amazed at the fact that he could feel Sherlock tightening around him at the declaration.
"I'm fine," he grumbled sinking lower in his seat and waiting patiently for John to go back to reading the newspaper.
Sherlock worked her way higher and Jane steeled herself. 'You bloody asked for this,' she told herself. 'Keep it professional.'
"I was thrilled that you could make time for me on such short notice," Mycroft said, following Sherlock in and stepping over the pile of school things the man had left in his wake.
He didn't have much time to feel so, though, as he was being dragged from the room by Sherlock's retreating presence soon after.
Ah, the screen name! DoctorJohn. If the writer really was a doctor, perhaps there was some information he could glean after all.
Sherlock bit his lip and covered his face with a tissue to hide the cruel look it had decided on, and tried not to seem overly eager.
John was at his neck then, prodding with his nose and licking the hollow below his Adam's apple. It was enough to halt the sentence completely. He rocked his hips and nudged at Sherlock's earlobe.
Sherlock ushered John up the stairs and into a crowded flat and then pushed him towards the sofa. John simply stood there with his mouth hanging open as tea was started. He closed his mouth resolutely when Sherlock finally joined him in the bizarre sitting room.
Greg had been right about Sherlock's book. John had barely got through four pages before he gave up trying to read it. It wasn't just that there were words he honestly had to look up, it was also that the characters lacked depth. They were obviously there just to spew out the knowledge Sherlock was full of. The cases were interesting, yes, but interesting in the way peer reviews and medical studies were interesting. Very much not relaxing reading.
"London's underbelly is a lot rougher than the average citizen is comfortable believing. All you need is a good head on your shoulders and a contact at the Met. You'd be surprised at the cases I've covered just in the last four months. Corporate espionage is also interesting, and London is perfect for that as well," Sherlock answered smoothly, the bit of discomfort that had shown through her thick veneer earlier had evaporated. "And, of course, it can get a bit dangerous."
Mycroft surged forward and kissed Greg, gripping his arm and shoving his tongue into his mouth. Greg took a step back and put a hand on his chest to push him away.
"Because you're mad," John said, voice getting rough as Sherlock heard the sound of a zip being pulled down. "My mad genius."
Greg folded the newspaper carefully and walked down the hall, trying his best to reconstruct a straight face. When he made it to Sherlock and John's table the men were sitting next to each other, leaned in close, sipping coffee and talking under their breath. Greg snorted, couldn't help himself, and pushed the paper forward.
"Not a major anymore," James said with a sad smile, but a smile nonetheless. "Now tell me about your crisis."
"You two settle in and I'll bring supper to the library. That boy won't be able to pull his nose out of a book long enough to make something for himself," Mrs Hudson said as she set up a platter.
John laced their fingers together and waited for his heart to stop doing those frightening little jumps. "Tell me, tell me about the case."
"Do I clean up well?" John asked, comb running through his hair to adjust it, the pomade making it shine.
John was there, standing at the sink. His hair shone silver and gold in the light of the setting sun, and while he didn't look young, he was the epitome of health. Regret bloomed fresh in Sherlock's stomach as he remembered what his imminent death would do to John. He'd only just got to see the edges of his affection.
"This detective I'm working with. She's closed a case I was helping her with and deemed the death a suicide. It was obviously a murder. The woman has no idea how to do her job so I'm going to end up doing it! Although..." Sherlock trailed off.
Mycroft straightened his tie and held his arm out for Greg, who took it apprehensively. "I've become aware, recently, of certain things. Things I have been denying, even to myself."
They ended up watching telly the rest of the afternoon and into the evening. Sherlock had nearly fallen asleep. His mind was more than happy to stay there in John's arm, being petted and cared for, until the end of bloody time, but his body was aching from the sedentary day, and he knew he needed to sprawl out a bit.
It was difficult to tell if the grunt and cursing was due to injury or orgasm. Sherlock pressed her ear to the door and heard Jane turn on the faucet. Orgasm. Unless, unless she'd hurt herself and was cleaning off the blood. Sherlock looked through the keyhole, the old thing was quite large, when the sink was turned off, and saw Jane pad out into the living room and collapse into her chair.
Sherlock struggled to his feet and kissed John roughly, choking on his breath as the man reached into his trousers and started stroking him. He shuddered and rested his upper body against the man.
John set some money down on the bar and stood. "Sorry, uh, I have to go. I'll get you the next one, yeah?"
Sherlock covered his mouth again with one hand, not sure what might fall out if he didn't, and held the other out. John pushed the ring onto his finger and fetched the matching one from his pocket.
Sherlock blushed and rolled his hips. John pulled off the rest of the petals on his arse and back before tossing the condoms and lube onto the pillow and pulling him down for one last kiss. Sherlock followed him onto the bed and rested on his side, back to John, clutching a pillow to his chest.
Sherlock let the mouse hover over the comment button for a few moments before slamming the laptop shut.
"I don't sleep," Sherlock replied, hurting with John and wanting to stop it from festering. "Well, not often. Three hours a night is enough. I smoke cigarettes and used to do cocaine and heroin to deal with reality. I don't have friends, I don't even have lovers."
"Doctor Jane Watson," Jane amended, eyes fixed on Sherlock's plump bottom lip. "Formerly of the Northumberland Fusiliers."
"Oh, uh, hello," John sputtered, chewing his lip and pressing his tongue to the roof of his mouth in an effort to shut up.
Something was wrong when John got home. He walked through the door a bit slowly and his smile didn't reach his eyes. Sherlock, refusing to admit he cared that John was no longer going to flirt with Anonymous, rifled through the newspaper a bit and stayed sat on the sofa.
They finally climbed from bed and made their way to the shower, John pinching Sherlock's bum several times on the way and then gripping it when the man bent over to turn on the taps.
John bristled at that. This man was arrogant and John had never warmed to that personality trait. "I believe I can choose for myself how I spend my time."
"Stop talking," Greg said, rubbing the tip of Mycroft's cock with his thumb and tracing around the head as his foreskin drew back.
The man with the broken bicycle, a collection of cans, and trousers five sizes too big was the one in danger.
"Sit down and I'll bandage your ribs again," he said plating both omelettes and bringing them to the kitchen table. "Have you taken anything for the pain yet."
Greg surged forward and kissed him, hands finding purchase in expensive lapels. That, it seemed, was enough to shock the usually unflappable man, and when Greg pulled back he was met with a gasp and searching eyes.
Sherlock watched as he put on his jacket and then walked forward to meet him. "Shall I tell you a secret?"
"And you're going to pay me to...what? To follow you around? Do I have to quit my job?" John asked as the food arrived.
"I keep forgetting to pay," Sherlock explained, doing something with her thumbs that had Jane groaning in relief.
She sat exactly like Sherlock, her back to the woman, and lifted her faded RAMC tee over her head. Folding it and laying it in her lap, she tried to relax. She could smell the balm the second Sherlock opened it; peppermint and something else wafting into the room.
I don't believe you'd be useless muscle. I could always use another pair of hands. Strangely enough, I don't believe I've ever said that to anyone in my life. You make me think such peculiar things.
This suit was a much brighter blue pin stripe than he'd expected, double breasted and cinched at the waist. The shirt underneath was an unsurprising bone white, but the tie more than made up for it with its diamond pattern and orange and beige colouring.
"Ms Watson," Sherlock said, softer than before, but still with an edge of teeth, "I will endeavor to surprise you."
"I...I'm to blame as well," he said, pinching the bridge of his nose and closing his eyes. "I can't be the man she wants, I can't..."
Mycroft let his hands slip below Greg's shirt and rub up and down his back, sneaking down every once in a while to pull his arsecheeks apart before scratching up his back again. Greg let him, hissing when fingernails pulled at his skin, and slowly added a third finger.
What met John when he returned was obvious skepticism. Sherlock watched him carefully as he brought in two of the blankets from the large linen closet upstairs, barely breaking eye contact as John tucked them around him. It was a bit uncomfortable, Sherlock's eyes that close up.
He focused on the head of his prick and moaned softly as the feeling of John's toe on his calf continued up.
"Vicar Watson," he said, peeking around the corner to find the time, the clock showing half five in the morning.
John caught a cab home and jogged up the stairs. Sherlock was sitting on the sofa with his knees tucked up under his chin. He looked expectantly at John when he walked in.
Sherlock huffed through his nose and leaned in to kiss him once, chastely. "Finally listening to your therapist?"
Sherlock turned the shower off and stood there for a moment in silence. When John shuffled his feet again he bit down on the instinct to tell him to go to hell, and cleared his throat. "I'm fine, John."
It only took several more thrusts before John was shouting Sherlock's name and emptying into the condom. He kissed Sherlock's neck as the aftershocks rolled through him and then turned them back onto their sides. He was hesitant to pull out, the heat of Sherlock's arse still quivering around him. Sherlock must have noticed.
Sherlock stood and let go of John's hand to slip into his greatcoat. John pulled out his wallet but Sherlock stilled his hand as the woman from earlier, the owner and chef, reappeared. She handed Sherlock a takeaway box and smacked John's hand.
She sighed and shook her head. "It has a sticker on the front that specifically says 'not for human consumption'."
The family loved Greg. It was to be expected; Greg was a remarkably agreeable man. Mummy fussed over him and Mycroft tried to ignore it, hiding his disdain for the woman well. At least, he thought.
"A murder would be much more interesting than an accident," Sherlock said, bending to look into his microscope.
OF COURSE NOT, Sherlock replied, YOU'RE MUCH TOO UTILITARIAN FOR THAT. TELL ME ABOUT THE ARMY, DOCTOR.
“Both.” Sherlock shrugged. Technically, he wasn’t used to having associates at all—his family didn’t count, as they were forced to be at his side—but why spell it out?
Gemma’s mouth snapped closed, widening into a smile as she led them through the hospital, The pathologist, a forty-something, lanky man, jumped when they entered.
Damn, maybe he had sunstroke. Usually chemistry didn’t make him maudlin. But today he felt odd. He should just have made something explode. That kind of adrenaline rush always boosted his mood, despite people at his university forever whining about it. He doubted that the Italians would welcome the idea, especially if it was louder than he expected—which had happened in the past. Exams were stressful enough without adding blasts to the mix.
"I thought – my mistake." He's about to run away, even quicker than he climbed up, but a hand traps his arm. He's going to have to give more answers than that. Fine. Maybe he can learn where he's gone astray, then.
She frowned, examining them, but said, “O-kay, I’m making a snap judgement of my own. It might get me in trouble, but you do have a point, commissioner Di Giovanni really should make sure I have someone relieving me. My shift ends in...oh, about ten minutes. At least I should have got a message asking me to report. These don’t look fake to me, besides the names, but in fairness, they’d be ridiculous names to pick for an alias. If you promise me you’ll go to your room and stay there, no sneaking out to investigate crimes or commit them,” she grinned, “then I’ll just go home and meet you tomorrow. If this is a mistake, I’m trying to make it the least bothersome I can. And if it means my colleagues are going to do all the work while I babysit a couple of tourists...well, it’s not my fault.”
“Okay. You have a point. If we’re breaking the rules, we’re breaking the rules. Besides, I’m here to make sure that you won’t actually damage our investigation. And I have to prove you wrong about the talent of our police force...though it’d be embarrassing if my friends locked up the right person before we can.” She giggled.
“Are you all for real?” Gemma interjected. She nibbled on her lower lip, eyes shifting between them.
Oh. John grinned reflexively. He liked their agent. Maybe they wouldn’t need to mount an international scandal. “Erm...I don’t speak nearly as much Italian as I’d like. If someone could translate the pathologist’s words for me, it’d be lovely.”
"As if. You should have started to feel the difference between our capabilities. But maybe that's asking too much of you. Sherlock? Any last words?"
"Coffee?" Sherlock sounded like he'd been offered a mysterious brew from Alpha Centauri. Or as if the idea of going for a coffee was an unprecedented event in the history of mankind.
Instead of answering, Sherlock dives for a kiss. Instead, of the immediate enthusiasm he expects, he's shoved off. He should have known. He shouldn't have –
When someone came—a fresh-faced, smiling policewoman—he smiled back. She told him, in decent English, “You won’t believe what I’m here for.”
It had been a long time since he'd played tag; now was his chance. The guard was unarmed, after all—no one would risk a bullet damaging priceless art, or even centuries old walls. Sherlock was surprised to see his pursuer sit down after chasing him through two rooms, but then he was almost intercepted by a different guard. Even though all of them made a token attempt to catch him, they didn't seem overly concerned. He didn't get close enough to any of the art pieces to damage them (or even slow down enough to see them) and their priorities were driven deep.
accidentally contaminate the crime scene so they can come back and find something to use against you,” Sherlock rapped out, grey eyes turning almost dark blue.
"If you want, it'll take me only a few minutes to track down their IP address. That'll be a good start to see what they might actually be up to. Sure, it's probably nothing...but they might be victims of an interesting murder." He grins.
The only problem was that, their little issue solved, they were now expected to solve the major one. They could have tried to just retreat to the...thing and figure out how to turn it on (couldn't really trust the Colonel, could they?) but Sherlock was pretty sure they'd be followed, and dealing with hoplites wherever they ended next didn't seem like an appealing prospect. Normally, he'd just nod towards John and unleash him. War was his beloved's specialty. But this war would obviously have parameters quite different from the ones John was trained to.
His grudge melted when she started acting like a proper tour guide instead. It was hard to stay angry when everyone huddled together, and she whispered—in English, for their sakes—a brief highlight of the art in front of them, as well as the rooms they walked in. Especially since she peppered it with maybe not strictly historical but certainly funny, and sometimes even saucy, anecdotes, and some of the others excitedly interjected with more details. Almost every time, Sergio or Bea. And yes, the art was brilliant, too, of course, even if most of it was religious in nature. How many saints' and Virgin Mary portrayals could a country really need?
For a minute or two there was no reply. So, the man gave up that easily. Not even a ‘when will you be back?’ The journalist wasn’t disappointed. Not at all. It was what he wanted in the first place.
“Didn’t I tell you? Nantes requested its loan. I couldn’t refuse, as the director is a college friend of mine,” the professor said, waving away her words.
Finally slowing down, Sherlock allowed himself to observe the place. Typical of his brother, finding a museum that once was a Duke’s palace. Sherlock wandered through the halls, with their half-faded frescoes and painstakingly engraved doors, and wondered if Mycroft was planning to eventually take over the director’s job. It would definitely be in his style…and having him a few hundred miles away might actually make him more tolerable.
Someone was wrong—and it couldn’t be him. He was going to prove it was John. What a pity the man would hate him for it. That would've happened anyway, though. He only had to demonstrate that his persona was the one that any sane person would mock and despise. Then, John would leave himself, unwilling to even share a nation with him.
He grinned, waving at his new friends. The monumental entrance in the town’s thick walls looked like a more auspicious beginning for his travels than sneaking in the tiny arch at the base of a fortified tower jutting out from them, anyway.
is not a fake name.” Finally, the man shook it. “Since we’ll be here for a whole week, I thought that I could steal my brother for a while, no matter how many details you need to sort through. It’s an important matter.”
Two rings, and John answered. He could feel the man’s grin even through the phone. “Sherlock! It’s brilliant to hear from you.”
They sat in the rearmost pew, the shadows—after coming from the blazing sunshine—doing nothing to hide both men’s scowls. “So?” Mycroft ground out.
“Wait, what?” Sherlock didn’t mean to yell, but John claiming to have followed a white rabbit through the local undergrowth wouldn’t have astonished him more.
The Colonel wasn't one for flashy displays. When Moriarty wanted someone skinned and his limbs strewn in different neighbourhoods, he had the right people for that. The Colonel was a shadow, and you'd crumble into one yourself if he had to deal with you. No matter what threats Sherlock could make, the almost mythic aura of the criminal kept lips sealed. Maybe he should have acted a more fantastical part himself. Play actual immortal, to go against a purported one. But for all his talent for pretense, that always felt too silly to even attempt.
Sherlock was dancing. Not literally dancing, it’d be quite concerning if his reaction to blood splatters was bursting into a pirouette, and the ultimate proof that John had been run over on the way to Misha and in a coma ever since. But the way he moved between the stains, the way he’d lean to examine a detail making sure not to brush against anything. A partner in a tutu wouldn’t have been out of place any more than a surprisingly quiet Gemma. You’d think that she would have words—lots of them—”Careful,” and, “Don’t”, and, “What are you even looking at?” The answer to which would be interesting. Instead, she was just looking at him like an oddly fascinated falcon, her head tilting to follow his movements.
Alessandra didn’t move. “Again? She’s in shock, you know. You might be used to...to...that,” she replied. Her arms opened in defeat, the right one turning in small, aborted half-circles, as if she could physically grasp the words she couldn’t speak “But we’re not. How don’t you understand that?”
“Any suggestions?” the doctor asked, turning to Gemma. It was an obvious move, but, the journalist would rather ignore the presence of Ball And Chain (his personal nickname for their guardian).
Sherlock whispered the translation into John’s ear, and then snapped in perfect Italian, “How don’t you understand suspect in a murder investigation?”
“I told you it was insane.” She shrugged. “Now let’s get a move on, your friend was sure we’d release you in seconds and he’s been waiting for the last four hours. He managed to get a lawyer and...his brother, I think?...to the station in the meantime. I don’t think he will like having to wait any longer.”
“That’s so cuuuute!” she honest-to-God screeched, and John cringed. Better than being lectured or insulted, sure, but not much. Luckily for his eardrums (and sanity), they were almost there.
She shook her head. “No debts, I'd know about it. I mean, she'd ask me first. I was right there. Loans—to everyone who asked, really, but they were mostly small amounts. You don’t murder for 20 Euros. The only one who came round more often than the others...I mean, I’m not saying she would do that, but... Viola. Classmate, too.”
John looked chastened—or maybe pretended to?—but Sherlock refused to indulge her. “If you’re done, we can proceed with our enquiry. I was about to leave on my own. We can't cater to people's feelings until our trail goes cold.”
"Step away from there," John ordered, levelling the gun on...well, whoever it was. If someone was actually there, and it wasn't just part of the current hallucination.
Gemma decided to take the lead after that, one eye on her charges, but refusing to have the blind (blindest, in fact) leading them. It made sense, but still she rushed to apologise, almost tripping over her own words.
She replied (according to Gemma, who took over translating duties without even being asked), “Speak up, then fuck off.” Good. Raging would help her.
Finding his way to the research centre was easy—and spotting his new acquaintance too. With his height and striking features, Sherlock (he still couldn't wrap his mind around that) certainly didn't have an easy time slipping by. Immediately, John blundered again. He knew better than anyone that just grabbing someone's arm wasn't always a good idea, but he wanted to avoid the other fleeing before he could apologise. He just didn't expect the instinctive attempt to bring him down with…was that some sort of judo move? Military training kicked in before he could think the answer, and John strictly avoided being caught. That seemed only to incense the other, and John went from the pursuer to the pursued. How did they go from an attempt at normal conversation to a mini scuffle right in the middle of the ward's corridor? To his surprise, restraining the madman wasn't as easy as it should have been. Other people looked at them with various levels of fear and disapproval. Damn.
John put a hand on his friend’s back—people who solved murders for you were definitely friends—in an attempt to soothe him. That was why he felt him shudder. The poor man looked as if he’d have nightmares about today...and they hadn’t even seen the crime scene yet.
“Prepare for heaven,” Gemma said, with an exaggerated flourish, in front of the door to her recommended place. “Oh, and one last question—if you prefer, I can sit by myself at a neighbouring table. I can’t exactly give you complete privacy, but, you know.”
. This time, it was a brilliant red, with deep blue hinges. He prayed it meant his brother was in a good mood, because he needed Mitch to be. There was no way that he could face this alone. Not when the universe had stopped making sense.
Sherlock sighed deeply. If that was necessary, why hadn’t she asked as soon as they met? He showed his, anyway, and so did John. There was no need to antagonise the woman without purpose.
He hadn’t wanted to see that happen. Stupid. He’d acted in fear—fear of losing what shouldn’t have existed in the first place—and look at the mess he got himself into. This stopped now. He didn’t have feelings. Had refused to have feelings for so long. So why had he been indulging such…such animal instincts? Maybe Mycroft had been right, if for the wrong reason, in forcing him to confront his bogeyman. A cheerful, supportive bogeyman. Only him…then again, he’d never pretended to be normal.
Mum would have done as much…if she’d known that he met a John Watson. But she couldn’t have, so the only option was… S-
“Any hint? What about both of you using fake names? The most glaringly obvious of fake names, too? Criminals usually make a token effort to be able to pass off their documents, but not you. Do you really think so lowly of the police? We’re not Carabinieri, you know!” the commissioner snapped, eyes narrowed.
“Not on bas-relief, on war…Now, if the actual army captain will be so kind to explain,” the journalist said, grinning at him.
Once inside, a loud stomach rumble came from their group. No, it wasn't John, who had complained about being hungry in the first place, but Sherlock. The smell of food had gone directly to the enteric part of his nervous system to remind the one in his skull that they’d missed lunch, too. The day couldn’t have been worse.
. I can’t waste it on anyone else. What did she get involved in, by the way?” the young man replied.
Sherlock did his best to ignore their guardian, since she was useless as far as investigating went anyway. He’d already noticed three details that should have told the police that no, John wasn’t involved at all. Technically, there were seven, but he’d seen these people. He couldn’t assume that they’d notice the subtler signs, the same way you didn’t expect a first year student to pull off Paganini.
A redhead sat upright, smiling at him. “So? Did you get the cum laude, or what?” she asked – or at least John assumed she did, since he did recognise the word laude at least.
...If only John would have let him. He was ensconced in his armchair, a hot tea in hand and a throw around him (lacking shock blankets or, how he'd have preferred, a boyfriend plastered all over him), when John laughed. "I couldn't resist. Googled Thebes and Gorgidas. Well, turns out he decided that the thing to do was to have on the front line all pairs of lovers. So they'd be their heroic selves – can't exactly be a coward with your boyfriend around – and boost morale. And later, someone else took these off the various phalanxes – battalions, maybe? – and turned them into a single unit. And they totally kicked Spartan arses."
If Sherlock left, though, he would eventually have to explain his reasons to their parents. There was no doubt that Mycroft would tell on him if he didn’t get his way...whatever his way was. The last thing he needed was a concerned mum asking why he ran away. Once their mother was aware of the situation, the only way for him to be rid of John Watson would be to straight-out murder him and ensure the body was never found, which the journalist would rather avoid. As much as they had to dodge each other, for everyone’s sanity, John hadn’t done anything to deserve death. Yet. In fact, if he’d been called something—anything—else, Sherlock would have accepted his invitation without a beat. Not many people (fine, let’s be honest, nobody to date) praised him. Not after being the object of his deductions.
Judging by the soft smile on John’s lips, he found it amusing. “I don’t. Honest to God, I was surprised by the text myself.” He took another sip of his coffee.
“I thought that we had an agreement that John Watson and I should be as far away from each other as possible. Just because I didn’t flee to Australia, it didn’t mean that you’re authorized to invite him along.” Sherlock kicked the pew in front of him, ignoring his brother’s chastising look.
“John Watson! You didn’t get involved in a murder in order to keep my interest in you keen, did you?” Sherlock would have loved to say he was horrified at the prospect, but he was afraid that his voice came out more along the lines of impressed. The other laughed. And even if he didn’t mean to, he found himself smiling, too.
Sherlock’s eye-roll, while translating the last words for John, was so heavy the doctor worried that he'd twist his superior oblique eye tendon into a knot.
The academic looked down on them (never mind that Bea was actually taller than Sherlock... nothing so inconsequential would change an obvious decades-old attitude), and his eyes finally zeroed on the journalist. “I didn’t expect you back so soon, Mr. Holmes.”
Sherlock finally pivoted, ignoring his brother’s disappointed moue. He didn’t care if Mitch expected him to be cleverer than this; he wished he was just an idiot. He groaned loudly. As much as he tried to be reserved and snappish when anyone was around—he had a reputation to hold up—Mitch didn’t count. “It’s not fake, that’s the problem. It was supposed to be just a job, and then…John Watson crashes into my life. And you haven’t heard the worst part. He’s an army doctor.”
Sherlock barely kept from flinching at her volume. And John—former soldier John—actually took half a step back, and looked as if he’d have retreated more if the stairs didn’t hinder him.
“Even when it’s this hot?” The words had just left his mouth, when he realised how ambiguous his sentence sounded.
He might have zoned out for a minute there, in his righteous anger, because next he knew Sherlock’s glare had changed into a smirk, which didn’t seem a logical reaction.
The youngsters in their group, instead (John turned 28 this year, but God, he felt ancient) barely dared to breathe, their eyes shifting between the two arguing like the public of a tennis match. All but Livia, whose gaze was helplessly wandering.
“Alex,” Livia said. Just one word, but her tone reminded John of someone dealing with an unruly pet. John couldn’t swear it, but he bet that the following, hissing Italian sentence threatened to leave him here unless he behaved.
“Don’t tell me you got lost,” John quipped, shaking his hand…perhaps a little longer than strictly necessary.
“Him, actually.” Would that change her attitude?It was a long time since John had come out as bi, but every new person was still an unknown quantity. Good thing that he'd stopped caring about people's opinions long ago.
As heart-warming as that was, it was just one more detail that made him wary. John Watson, finding Sherlock Holmes and appreciating his brasher side? It just wasn’t true. A prank. It had to be a prank. But his brother’s? The universe’s? John’s nonchalant attitude towards their matching names only made the situation more suspicious.
John kicked his shin, not hard, but the urge was too difficult to suppress. It had always worked on his boisterous brother, when a teenager John’s ‘wingman’ role meant stopping the idiot from behaving in the most inopportune way for the circumstance and the girl involved. Who knew it was precious training for the future?
Luckily, the suspect's expressive face cued him in on the gist of the conversation, despite the man's babbling. Or perhaps it just sounded like that to John because he wasn’t able to parse any words. Still, some of them undoubtedly were, “She wasn’t actually annoying,” “Her art was inspired; inspired, truly!” and, “We were the best of friends!” And—John assumed—plenty more.
When Viola heard he wasn’t here for leisure, but following someone he had feelings for—even if these feelings were intense fascination and curiosity at the moment, he wouldn’t go as far as to say he’d fallen in love at first sight—she exclaimed, “Aaaawwww!” He’d never heard that, or even seen it outside internet forums, but there was no other sensible way to spell what she said. “If you run into any problems, just text any of us. We’ll hunt her down for you!”
Mycroft turned and looked Greg in the eyes, the lights outside lighting his face in brief intervals as they moved quickly through traffic. "I've always loved you."
Sherlock smiled at his anger. "Who am I partnering with? Someone on the local team, I hope. I would honestly-"
Sherlock's head was tingling as he typed out a response, sure sign of blood loss. That was, of course, because all his blood had taken a mid-winter migration to his prick.
"You!" Mary hissed. "You've been trying to steal my husband the whole time. Don't think I didn't see you!"
Soon, Sherlock was coming, breathing in short gasps. John fumbled with his belt and pulled his own cock out, stroking it and promptly staining the sofa.
He’s probably frightened the bloke off with all of his—well, whatever the bloody hell it is that’s wrong with him.
He still sees her as a friend in that strange way of his that ignores his own best interests just for a scrap of affection.
Well, he’s not sure what they are, but they share a flat again, and there nights of John picking out films he thinks will amuse Sherlock, and Sherlock deducing the plot in the first 5 minutes and then shouting at the telly for the rest of it, there are late night picnics of Thai takeaway in front of the hearth, and there is the sound of Sherlock’s violin lulling John to sleep again., and John ignoring body parts in the crisper again, and Mrs. Hudson’s tea waiting whenever they happen to get up.
Sherlock has just spent a long, lazy hour snogging him senseless, and he still feels a little boneless.
John stops and waits for them to come over, and then reaches through to pet one head after another, while they nuzzle and lip at his pockets.
And maybe this makes me sound like a sentimental idiot, but I’m glad to just be here with you, whatever does or doesn’t happen.”
He doesn’t want to play co-parent if Rosie is going to be snatched away from him and placed in the arms of whatever nameless woman du jour John lands on next.
He is capable, skilled, somewhat reliable, intelligent, and always willing to serve, even if it is grudgingly, but he’s rarely thought of himself as exciting.
John takes the opportunity to advance on Sherlock, backs him up against the tinned beans on the shelf opposite, finger pointed under his nose.
Now it’s come down to the moment itself, he’s not sure his knees will hold him, and it’s ridiculous, and inexcusable, that, that they have been everything to one another for well over a decade, and this is still that difficult.
I love you, and I know you don’t—do that, and I don’t have any expectations, okay, I just—I needed you to know that I’m not just back because it’s convenient, or because I need an adrenaline hit, or even just because I’m lonely.
It’s slightly cold in the flat, but John sits down next to him, slides in close, and his body heat is soon radiating against Sherlock’s side, chasing away the cold.
The motorcycle roars by, halfway up the lane, and Sherlock cranes his neck around to follow it’s route in the gathering dusk.
It’s a voice John would know anywhere, and he has to fight to push down the emotion, to not think too hard about that fact that Sherlock is just the other side of that door, that they’re finally going to be standing in the same room, finally face-to-face, and that he would give anything, anything for it to not have happened this way.
He reaches inside his pants, and strokes out the last drops of pleasure, and then stares up at the dark ceiling and cries.
“Mmm,” Sherlock hums, and pulls back, John’s cock popping from between his lips to slap wetly against his belly.
Ella walks him to the door, and when she opens it to let him into the reception area, there is Sherlock, sitting on the prim little sofa, looking far too long for it, his coat buttoned tightly, looking wildly uncomfortable.
Properly divested and comfortable, John walks back over to the bed, and traces a finger over the fabric of Sherlock’s pants.
John lets Sherlock stoke the fire when they get back, while he goes into the kitchen, and sets out his supplies: flour, baking powder, butter, black currants.
The steady glide of Sherlock’s hand speeds up for a moment, a gasp, a soft grunt, a surge of slick heat spilling down to slick them both, and Sherlock’s encouragement coming in panting, breathless sighs, but the smooth motion of his hand resumes again after a moment, steady, sure, safe.
And when Sherlock arches a brow suggesting mightn’t she just be being a wee bit hysterical: “Kate’s father made his money in refrigeration.
He had his ideas, and that’s how it was, and that’s what you did, and so I did, and now here I am, just maybe figuring things out and…”
She pulls the scarf from around her neck, and shakes out her hair, before catching sight of his face, and lifting a gloved hand to her mouth.
Ahh, so he had seen the videos, and he hadn’t decided John was an obsessive, hideous nutter and run for the hills yet, so that’s something.
Sherlock’s hands slide from his shoulders over his chest, and he feels his chin come to rest on the top of his head.
John follows, climbs on top of him, and sits down on Sherlock’s thighs, staring down at him with an expression that makes Sherlock warm all over.
John glances down at Sherlock’s cock, and reaches for the lube, puts a bit more in his palm, and returns to what he was doing before.  “Thought the first time, I could maybe—set the pace?”
With his mother, on the rare occasion he saw her, odd, fawning affection, which he’d lapped up like a starving kitten until he’d realised the falsity of it, like it could ever make up for the fact that she’d abandoned him to a raging drunk.
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say.  He reaches blindly for John’s hand, and when he finds it, John takes his, without hesitation, meshes their fingers and squeezes.
Sherlock is so close now that John can breath his breath, and he wonders what will happen, why he wants to run, but doesn’t.
“You wanted to know why I’ve been pulling away the last few months?” he offers after draining the glass.
The pub is small and run down, dusty, too, so it appears they’ve been closed up for at least a week or two.
For the briefest of moments he thinks he’s angry, but then he realises his eyes are burning with an altogether different emotion.
The lounge is toasty warm now, and Sherlock lets himself be tucked back in on the sofa, John sitting on the far end, on top of his toes to keep them warm.
There’s only the soft hum of noon day traffic outside, the muffled clatter of the cafe next door, the whisper of Sherlock’s breath in his hair, and the heavy, grounding weight of his arms still slung loosely around John’s waist.
He waits until he hears John pad back toward the lounge before cracking the door open and pulling the offerings inside.
He scoots closer to John and reaches out, traces a finger up and down the arm of his shirt, watches John’s nose wrinkle.
He nods once, flushes the toilet and turns on the water in the sink, just so Sherlock will think he’s actually been doing what one does in the loo, and not standing in front of the mirror like a prat, psyching himself up for what comes next.
When he gets no response to that either, he gets up, steps into his pyjamas, yanks the duvet off the bed (let him freeze), and stomps out to the lounge where he flops onto the sofa and listens to the soft hum of late night traffic outside.
Sherlock reaches down and lays a hand lightly on John’s waist, waits until John nods, and then wraps his arm around and pulls him closer.
His eyes are everywhere, reading John in that way he has that makes him feel naked even under three layers of clothes, and he’s wearing considerably less right now.
John cocked his head to the side and clenched his fists, this time out of confusion rather than anger. "Do you read my books?"
Four days. Four bloody days of whining about the cold, and now it was all taking a strange turn. The whining John could handle, this new facsimile of sweetness, of care, hit a bit too close to home. Could Sherlock really not see how it stung when he said things like that?
The woman thrashed in John's arms and pointed an accusing finger. "You hear that, you wretch? The jewelry he gave you was paste! You meant nothing to him! I should have killed you the same way I killed him!"
John rang off and walked into the kitchen. Sherlock was bringing his plate to the sink, Merrick glued to his ankle and whining for one last bit of egg.
