Sherlock approached the window, taking out his magnifying glass and eyeing the dried specks of blood, already forming a conclusion as to what might have happened.
The blond didn’t get to know Mycroft well but from what Lestrade tells him, Mycroft is nice if you use the right buttons and it’d be good to have an ally around. “
Sherlock grabbed the shoe. “The owner whitened them when they got discolored. Changed the laces three… no, four times. Even so, there are traces of his flaking skin where his fingers have come into contact with them, so he suffered from eczema.”
Mycroft grinned mischievously, “You were promised that, weren’t you?” He pecked the D.I.’s lips. “Get in the car and remove all your clothes.”
Professor Cairns wildly flung her arms around, pressing her fingers against the buttons controlling the editing features of the documentary. The woman was losing consciousness, her body was going limp as she failed to struggle against the man killing her.
Mrs. Hudson quickly opened the door and smiled at the handsome stranger. “Hello.” John smiled and gave her a small nod in return. “How can I help you dearie?”
John started to lose consciousness when the man released John, stuffing something inside the John’s jacket before leaving.
Sherlock was in his flat, sitting in his armchair with his eyes closed and his hands under his chin forming a pyramid, his usual thinking stance. He heard Mrs. Hudson roaming away downstairs and making tea, as always. His mind was racing around with one prominent word,
Sherlock made a disgusted face, he wasn’t used to seeing Mycroft’s soft side. Mycroft stood up straight and pinched Greg’s butt, then faced his younger brother.
Once Sherlock left the hotel, he kept running until he reached the building where Greg was holding his party. The Omega boy entered the hotel and noticed many people taking party supplies to the thirteenth floor, where he suspected that his brother was praising his mate for the promotion the Beta received.
“So, you’re doing well. You’ve been abroad a lot. Flying all the way around the world twice in a month.” The detective said.
John looked at his boss and the older man winked at him as he suspiciously slipped away from the two and disappeared into his office.
Sherlock lifted the tape and went beneath it. “Always Sally. I even know, you didn’t make it home last night.”
“Are you willing to place a bet on that? Perhaps someone enters the church and stabs your lovely John Watson to death. Or perhaps a mob of people who know about John’s secrets will enter and kill him. There are many more scenarios, which one do you prefer?”
Mycroft smiled sinisterly. “Well, according to Mrs. Hudson and-“ He said the next name with such sweetness. “Gregory Lestrade.” The sudden drop in Mycroft’s voice caused Sherlock to lift his eyebrow in suspicion. “You’ve been acting peculiar ever since the incident. You’ve been locked in here, taking zero cases, and not chasing killers. Did that encounter affect you in any way?”
John felt an unbreakable bond between —with one sniff— towards the Alpha before him, the Omega could have sworn that he knew this man from somewhere but his memory could not place the name to the face. It was almost as if this man was part of his prior life when… hell no. John wasn’t here looking for a one night stand, he needed to finish a job and no Alpha with sharp cheekbones and Cupid bow lips could make him drop everything to go in a dark corner and let this man fuck him.
Sherlock released John, walking away and expecting John to follow him. John took one step when he received a text from Mycroft, his relieved expression changing into a deep frown.
The landlady wanted to question the detective a bit more but she shook her head and went downstairs to phone Lestrade.
Sherlock dramatically threw himself onto the couch, stretching his legs and arms while blankly staring into the abyss.
Sherlock snorted and regretted the action when continuous amounts of foam dripped from his mouth. “I didn’t know, I saw. Your haircut, the way you hold yourself, says military. The way you immediately attended to my welfare, anyone without medical training would phone 999 and wait at my side without taking extra precaution of making sure to prevent myself from choking on my spume — so army doctor.”
John was looking at a small tea cup, he picked one up and looked at the price when he noticed the same symbol from bank was written on the tag.
Sherlock came closer and took out the memory stick, wanting Moriarty to stop hurting John and easing the scorching pain burning through his chest at knowing that someone else was hurting John. “Take it.”
John was diving in between cars when he looked over at the Alpha who was shivering uncontrollably. “Hey, are you okay?”
Angelo came to their table with a small glass bowl containing a candle surrounded by rose petals and placed it in the middle of table. He gave John a thumbs up as he walked away to quickly retrieve a plate filled with salted caramel cheesecake bars. Angelo smiled excitedly and made kissy noises while pointing at Sherlock and John. The blond falsely smiled and sent a wink towards Angelo while mouthing a silent ‘thank you.’ Angelo smiled merrily and left the two men alone.
Sherlock glared at the D.I. “Crystal clear but do you have to set up a pretend drugs bust to bully me? Is it fun to come here and mess up my flat?”
In confusion, Sherlock headed towards the window and saw a CCTV camera moving from side to side. The detective flipped off the camera as Lestrade laughed at the man’s reaction. “What does my brother see in you? I do not know. But apparently, you two were made for each other.” Sherlock looked around his flat. “I am clean!”
“You got it. The points.” Sherlock said, standing a few feet behind John and admiring John’s tenacious determination.
The speed of both bullets was hindered abruptly for Sherlock and John’s bullets met halfway and collided against each other. The impactful clashing of both bullets resulted in their ammo —which was made from different substances— to morph into broken ammunition that fell limply on the floor between Sherlock and John.
“There’s a bakery down the road, it has a wide selection of cakes and other sweets. I wouldn’t mind if we both went together.”
Sherlock looked at the horrible blue coverall. “He doesn’t need to wear that. Here.” He gave John a pair of latex gloves. “Wear these and you’ll be fine. Where are we?”
A high sing song voice rippled throughout the entire pool. “How clever, Sherlock. Though a bit slow, if you don’t mind me saying. I gave you my number… not directly but it was in your hands. I thought you might call.”
Sherlock wanted more of the hidden vigor that John was unknowingly taming, he knew that John had an equally potent force that could combat Sherlock’s own malevolent energy but never enough to defeat Sherlock’s reign. The waves of unhallowed flames were spreading throughout Sherlock’s veins and the unholy sensation of finding the perfect mate caused Sherlock to revert back into primal instincts that overtook his following actions.
Victor predatorily placed both hands on the bed and began to corner the Omega boy. The boy began to take frightened steps back until his threadlike back hit the wall. Sherlock whimpered and began to emit distressed pheromones that only made Victor want the Omega boy more. The boy began to hyperventilate, his fingers were itching to reach the inhaler in his trouser pockets but the Omega boy forced himself to not grab it.
The force was too great that the car flipped over the railing and fell towards the Thames river. Without even thinking, John grabbed Sherlock to protect him but he wasn’t fast enough for the vehicle hit the water with a loud bang and as soon as the car touched the water, the Alpha banged his head horribly against the glass window.
But perhaps there was a 0.01% of goodness inside him; so instead of delving into drugs, Sherlock stuck to smoking cigarettes. Cigarettes weren’t considered as divine pathways that led into a healthy long living life but they were preferred than raw narcotics that slowed Sherlock’s capability to think. The new set up of his life was the beginning of something terribly wonderful.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and faced Dimmock. “He climbed up the side of the walls, ran along the roof, dropped in through this skylight.”
Mycroft rolled his eyes. “I’ll speak with you later about this.” He gestured between John and Sherlock.
Sherlock’s phone rang and he immediately answered, putting the call on speakerphone. “The painting is a fake. It’s a fake, that’s why Woodbridge and Cairns were killed.”
But the bustling vibrance of London gave promise to many Omegas who were still looking for their place in high society with Alphas. Though, it still seemed like a bit of a long shot. In a flat located in 221B Baker Street, there lived a young Alpha by the name of Sherlock Holmes. Like many Alphas, Sherlock considered himself a true believer of keeping Omegas in line and never giving Omegas the reign of taking control.
Jim stepped away from John, winking at him. “So, you’re Sherlock Holmes. Molly’s told me all about you. You on one of your cases?”
The detective walked over to Lestrade and grabbed the folder from the table and gave them to Greg and shoved him out of the flat. “Goodbye, Lestrade.”
And for some odd reason, the detective was certain that John shined brighter at speaking with this idiot.
They could conquer and kill anyone that they desired, share the wealth of blood together and intensify the undying pact they will have as a couple. Sherlock wanted John to reign by his side but Sherlock wanted to engrave a specific message into John’s skull.
The Omega boy moaned when he felt the trickles of slick drooling out of his pink puckered ass, he forced his legs together so as the hide the scent of arousal that he was close to emitting. The boy felt himself becoming hot, he almost believed that he caught a fever for he started to sweat. Sherlock touched his forehead and felt his curls becoming damp.
The coachman was whipping the reins in his hands, prompting the horses the run faster for he didn’t want to get himself in trouble by taking the prince late to his own wedding. The trip from the Holmes kingdom to the cathedral located on the outskirts of London was about 40 minutes away but with the rain, the trip would be delayed to perhaps an hour or so.
The bullet never pierced the blond for when Shan took the shot, John knocked his chair over, hitting the ground and breaking the wooden chair. He struggled to free himself while Sherlock fought the other man remaining. After a harsh battle with the ropes around John, he picked himself up when he saw the detective pushing the man into the pit of fire.
John managed to give a tired nod, already feeling the loss of blood taking effect on his body. Sherlock could feel John closing his eyes and resting his head against Sherlock’s chest but Sherlock couldn’t afford John to sleep right now.
Sherlock nonchalantly turned around and eyed the horrible spectacle taking place before him, the closeness shared between John and Jim was making Sherlock incredibly angry.
Sherlock stopped his rapid pace and turned to stare at John, he was 103% sure that he wanted to kiss John on the mouth. Right now, in this moment in time, Sherlock wanted to capture John’s lips and feel the smooth rhythm of their mouths intertwining. My gosh, if John really tried, he could be another Sherlock Holmes but Sherlock wouldn’t want to change a single damn thing about John.
Sherlock wasn’t sure of the answer to his own question but the possibility of finding an answer kept rolling around in his mind. Sherlock would abandon any experiment that was in progress and visited his mind palace, finding the moment where John approached him and remembering how close John was to capturing his lips.
Nearly six centuries had passed since the night Jim Moriarty was killed. Yet the ancient feud between vampires and werewolves had proved unwilling to follow Moriarty to the grave.
“Exactly! Wow, you’re not just an average idiot. You’re a clever idiot! Anyways, yes, there was no phone on the body and no phone in the case. We know she had one — that’s her number; you just texted.”
“John, how nice to see you! I was hoping it wouldn’t be long. How can I help you?” Mycroft said as he went to look through a pile of papers.
The detective did not enjoy the spectacle in front of him, his thoughts were scattered all over the place. He almost forgot the reason why they were here in Scotland Yard.
John pulled away and lightly ghosted his fingers over Sherlock’s lips, which were now turning pink after the kiss. “I love you too. More than anything.”
“And if I don’t? What will you do? Kill me?” Sherlock chuckled. “Are you going to kill your baby brother?”
Sherlock faced the blond. “Will you come live with me? I mean, I would like to have your company when I’m visiting crime scenes. What do you say?”
Sherlock entered the room, where he found the blond on the floor. “John! What happened?!” He picked up John from the ground.
John and Sherlock approached the body, the detective squatted down on one side of the body while John took the other side, resting himself on his knees. “Well?” Sherlock questioned.
The Omega boy screamed and cried in repugnance when he felt the Alpha’s lips against his skin, Victor’s lips were cold, chapped, and dead. The boy shuddered in revulsion when he felt the Alpha’s tongue being dragged along his cheek. Sherlock was crying so much that the alleviation of trying to breathe was impossible.
John had noticed the repeated demeanor the detective acquired and John stuck with his usual response, walking away and breaking the eye contact. John smiled as he returned to his seat, looking at the overdue bills waiting to be paid. John had forgotten about the overdue bills but luckily, with his job, he was able to pay half of each bill.
Sherlock looked down at the corpse, “What do we know about this corpse? The killer hasn’t left us with much, just the shirt and the trousers. They’re pretty formal, maybe he was going out for the night. The trousers are heavy duty. Polyester, nasty, same as the shirt, cheap. They’re both too big for him. So, some kind of standard issue uniform. Dressed for work, then. What kind of work?”
“Do you know why the human race is weak? It is because of sentiment and for that, we must blame the heart. If it wasn’t for the heart, we wouldn’t care about anything but since we do have it, we are susceptible to feeling emotions.”
“You are correct in that sense but you’re wrong in your first assumption. Mr Prince didn’t kill his sister. She was murdered for revenge.”
Sherlock ruffled his curls in frustration. “What’s he doing? Working his way round the world, showing off?”
Sherlock released Anderson and brutally threw the boy back, a slight twitch of a smile flickered across his lips at the prominent injury created between Anderson’s head and the ground. Sherlock faced everyone and felt a surge of power running through his veins as he realized how afraid his friends were of him.
Sherlock turned around, happiness spread all over his face when he noticed that John wasn’t following him. His run was paused as he waited for John, the detective began to desperately fidget in place when he noticed drops of yellow paint on the pavement before him. Sherlock eyed the paint in suspicion, obviously these were fresh drops of paint.
Sherlock reached for the gun. “Thank you. Though I think it would benefit you more. I have more at the flat. Keep it.”
Sherlock rested his forehead against the nape of John’s neck, the warm pants escaping Sherlock’s mouth were creating specks of water droplets onto John’s skin. “You want someone like me because I’m the only one who will treasure your very existence. Can you not feel how hard my cock is for you? Every time I see you, John, I just want to touch you and make you mine.”
John Hamish Watson had all the fucking qualities of becoming a field agent and a killer. It wasn’t long before John climbed to the top of the ladder and became the most merciless agent in all of London.
“Never mind that. We found the case. According to someone, the murderer has the case, and we found it in the hands of our favorite psychopath.” Anderson remarked.
The detective’s face came to rest over John’s shoulder, his cheek lightly grazing against John’s soft one. John remained still, not moving a muscle as he let Sherlock rearrange his stance, to improvise John’s holding on the bow. John ignored the rapid beating of his heart, hoping that the detective wouldn’t hear his heart palpitating.
Sherlock faced John. “You wash your hair, there’s a difference. No, no — tinted eyebrows, clear signs of taurine cream around the frown lines. Those tired, clubber’s eyes. Then there’s his underwear.”
Sherlock faced Anderson. “Oh, shut up, Anderson! I’m not a psychopath. I’m a high functioning sociopath. Do your research.” He faced Lestrade. “You need to bring Rachel in. You need to question her I need to question her.”
From what John could remember of his past; he joined the army for a few years and ended up getting shot in the shoulder. Or at least, that’s what he’s read on the files pertaining to his name. After an accident that John could barely remember, he was immediately recruited by an anonymous corporation who sought out potential human beings that had the capacity of becoming trained killers.
Shan took the shot when the detective came out of his hiding spot and knocked over a trash can, darkening the place.
Sherlock was only seven when his parents died and he was left under the care of his brother. Since then, all hell broke loose. Mycroft —the legal guardian of Sherlock— proved to be an unforgivable brother who demanded Sherlock to achieve more than just knowledge and forced the boy to evolve into a similar nature that overtook Mycroft and transformed him into the man he was today.
Sherlock tuned out the sound of every person in the flat and went over the facts of every murder before Jennifer Wilson’s and in a matter of seconds, the pieces to the puzzle fitted together.
“It’s all computer generated, electronic codes, electronic ciphering methods. This is different. Its an ancient device. Modern code breaking methods won’t unravel it.”
John scrunched his face in horror as he watched the ugly cat approaching him but John forced a smile on his lips. “
“Well, I’m dealing with a freaking child. Sherlock, this our case. I’m letting you in, but you do not go off on your own. Clear?” Lestrade eyed the detective.
Victor snarled and in deep voice he said, “Sweet Omegas like yourself shouldn’t be alone. Perhaps I can keep you company.”
The boy reached forward and grabbed the box, physically retracting from the Alpha, for the man’s scent was revolting. The Alpha smelled of cheap cologne, fast food, poor hygiene, and drugs that reeked of garbage. During Sherlock’s entire life, he’s been a victim to different scents but this Alpha took the prize of being the worst smelling Alpha in all of London.
The detective and the blond were exiting the house as quickly as possible. Sherlock was already hailing a taxi for him and John.
In the middle of London, there stood a young man in between the crowds of people and trembling in fear while his beige jacket hid the deadly bombs strapped onto his body. Sherlock looked at John, signaling John to join him outside while Greg continued looking for any reports of a missing vehicle. John left Lestrade’s office and stood behind Sherlock.
John felt the shaking and quivering as Shock set in, his body was acting as though it were freezing though he didn’t feel particularly cold. It wasn’t a good sign, though it was inevitable.
“You realise that you don’t need to recklessly injure yourself every day to come and visit me?” John scolded as he finished stitching the slash marks across Sherlock Holmes’s back, the shoulder wound from the day before was already weeks ahead of where it should be healing wise but that didn’t make it appropriate for the man to be out fighting again.
Some were easy to distinguish as their regular personalities reflected their Wesen stereotypically, generally the Wesen of prey were easiest though the only difficult part about their slow brutish counterparts was telling one aggressive lump from another.
Destroying that many trained soldiers, and displaying their heads as a warning, was a clear sign of Wesen beast mentality. Under normal circumstances the soldier in question would have been sent on another ‘mission’ which he wouldn’t return from. Doctor Watson had been invalided home instead, released from the military and turned loose on the world.
Mummy said that Sherlock was too stubborn to let his Grimm abilities fully develop, that to him it would be like cheating or taking the easy way out and Sherlock was forced to admit he agreed. Being able to see Wesen woge from fear upon seeing him, while mildly satisfying, would take half the fun out of his detective and Grimm work.
Or so he thought, right up until Joe turned his head away from Sherlock to whisper into Adler’s ear. The woman giggled in a practiced manoeuvre which drew eyes to her seemingly by accident, everything this woman did was precisely calculated. While Sherlock watched his Soldier slowly detangled himself from Adler’s long, sinuous limbs then bowed formally and left for another room. All without looking at Sherlock a second time, his body language surprisingly hostile.
With drink in hand Sherlock watched a few of the early scenes, making comment only when he could see a submissive nearing their limits or perhaps needing an adjustment in play. The other Dominants, as long as he didn’t physically interfere again, had begun to appreciate his input and mostly listened to his advice. If only the rest of his associates would be so easily trained, he’d have a much easier run with Lestrade and his underlings.
John looked up with a start; he’d been in his own little world while waiting in line to order his coffee at the chic little café in central London, mind full of thoughts of sand and blood and shouts of ‘Medic’. He’d been so absorbed in his own thoughts however that he hadn’t seen the line move forward and realised, somewhat belatedly, that it was the barista at the counter speaking.
Though their voiced were hushed John could clearly see both men becoming agitated, and the way Travis was clearing at the man had John moving before he could think better of it. John strode towards the counter, an overly chipper smile on his lips as he drew out his wallet.
This telling however left several things out, including whether Captain Watson was taken hostage or simply wasn’t as easily killed as anticipated and followed their attackers with Wesen stealth, how exactly his injury came about, and why he was found surrounded by severed heads mounted on hand made spikes.
“Focus John, you’re a doctor. What do they need to know?” Sherlock applied more pressure to the wound and John felt his mind clear for a moment as the pain exploded back to the forefront of his mind.
“Oh, do keep up Doctor, Dinner. Your finish your shift at 5 o’clock so I will see you at 5:30, that should be plenty of time to finalise things for the day.”
A few of the others nodded and began swapping stories about things they’d seen or heard of ‘Joe’ doing. Sherlock smiled, this man was becoming more of a puzzle by the moment and Sherlock thoroughly enjoyed puzzles.
The soldier leaned in to the woman and whispered something in her ear, apparently this persona was much more talkative, which caused her to shiver again before nodding and the man smiled evilly beneath his mask before the dungeon master returned with a cup, not unlike the one Sherlock had used on the man previously. True to his expectations, this cup too was filled with ice which the soldier put on his table before picking up a simple blindfold and taking away the woman’s sight. With gentle hands the soldier began to rub the woman’s back, his progress only slightly impeded by the rope which constituted her clothing for the evening. The Captain massaged her neck, back, buttocks, legs and feet with skill and concentration until she was a puddle beneath him. Only then did he pull out a cube of the ice and the scene truly began. The Captain traced the ropes with the ice, then her major veins and muscles, chilling her skin and making her squirm with the sensation. He hadn’t gaged her, so they were all privy to her gasps, mewls and breathy pleas.
Pulling away Sherlock sized up the expanse of flesh before him, he hadn’t expected a response and he hadn’t received him. The hour had started the moment he restrained the soldier, but Sherlock did not expect to need that long, not with his experience at Barts. One of the pluses of his profession and his continued interests in human anatomy, he knew where to hit to maximise pain and where to avoid true damage.
Though perhaps not as easily as their puppeteer planned, it seemed he’d not accounted for John’s presence and had then been forced to make rushed contingencies. So John had be lead, by scent, to another part of this damnable building so as to be unable to interfere, he could smell ‘Smug’ in the air around him. Clearly they hadn’t expected much from John, few people ever did. Many forgot he was Wesen at all, let alone what kind. Mild mannered, gentle, pacifist, Doctor Watson would never be considered a threat. He certainly wouldn’t be carrying an unregistered fire arm and if he did then he wouldn’t possibly know how to use it despite his years in the military. He was a Doctor after all.
It seemed to be a running game within the Club, long enough running that Sherlock wondered if perhaps his soldier knew the Dungeon Masters or had been attending this venue for years.
“Will that be a problem anymore?” John asked, part of him feeling a deep-seated pleasure at Mr Holmes’ discomfort and pain as the lacerations were cleaned.
Though apparently Mycroft’s trip to Sherlock’s apartment was not without reason, as was his challenge apparently. That night when Sherlock attended the Club, he lay eyes on the infamous Woman for the first time. Dark hair coiled artistically up, red lips inviting sin as she radiated power in little more than a yard of black lace ribbon woven around her curves to cover… nothing at all. Truthfully this would have elicited barely a raised brow from Sherlock if not for the fact that this presumptuous ‘woman’ had herself wrapped around Sherlock’s Soldier. ‘Joe’ was back to his usual submissive attire with a full-face mask once more, a sense of satisfaction filled Sherlock at the fact that the man seemed unmoved by Adler’s advances. His posture rigid and composed, if not slightly annoyed, despite the way her feminine curves were draped languidly over him.
Sherlock felt something stir within him, he’d always appreciated the aesthetic of his soldier but this was like a new person entirely. The way the man held himself, previously rigid and controlled was now languid and predatory. Like a feline, fully aware of its power but in no rush to use it. When the soldier’s eyes locked with Sherlocks there was a kind of smouldering heat there and an undeniable challenge. Clearly this was the other side of the soldier that Sherlock had been warned about following their last scene. There was nothing submissive about the man tonight, he’d even switched out his usual club tag for one announcing him as a dominant. Sherlock felt his skin prickle with anticipation to see what the man would do. The detective himself had never had thoughts of being a submissive, despite labelling himself as a switch in an attempt to get closer to Adler, but compared to this new side of his soldier, Sherlock couldn’t seem to imagine himself as anything else. The realisation stunning him as much as the growing heat he felt as the Soldier prowled closer, dropped the duffle bag Sherlock hadn’t really noticed he had slung over his back and eventually threw himself onto the lounge beside Sherlock.
Sherlock pointed at a length of wall which had been replaced with a segment of chain-link fence and waited for the soldier to position himself in front of it, facing Sherlock. A simple turning gesture of the detective’s slim finger had the soldier facing the fence as Sherlock reached up to restrain his wrists, using his height to its full advantage against the shorter man so that his body was stretched taught.
The tag seemed so contrasting to the man Sherlock saw that perhaps that explained his fascination but somehow, he doubted that was the extent of it.
“Doctor Watson,” Mr Holmes waited until John had closed the door before he spoke, he was leaning casually against the raised procedure bed waiting.
“From the way his breath smelt, I have bad news for you.” Mr Holmes retorted as John began to clean the jagged, oozing gash.
Mycroft was unable to push further than that, not without risking his position as ‘impartial’ to Wesen-Wesen dealings, but he kept tabs on the doctor anyway and was thoroughly relieved when Sherlock stepped in to take over Wesen-sitting.
John was trying very, Very hard not to lose his temper. He’d been on edge for weeks, living with Sherlock Bloody Holmes did that to a person, but this was a whole new kettle of fish. John had been trying to retain some semblance of normalcy since moving in with Sherlock, had tried to continue his life outside their bizarre friendship, but apparently that was asking too much. It was asking too much that he be allowed to continue working regular hours at the clinic without Sherlock bursting in with a case on his heels, it was too much to expect that Sherlock and those around him would play by societal rules such as not kidnapping people, Damn Grimms and their messed-up families, but above all, apparently it was far faaar too much to ask that John be allowed one night off to take Sarah, another doctor from the clinic and a very beautiful Fuchsbau out on a date without hell intruding.
“Right, well then this will be our last visit Mr. Holmes.” John said with a grim finality, pulling off his blue surgical gloves with a snap, “I won’t treat patients with death wishes, I’m not that kind of Doctor.”
What he hadn’t expected was the lopsided yet predatory grin, which revealed just a hint of straight white teeth, levelled his way before he was wrenched forward by a fist buried in the fabric of his shirt. Sherlock expected a handful of things might happen in that moment, that he might be threatened, hit, thrown, etcetera… what had not made the list however was that he might be kissed.
Three minutes Sherlock spent, no more, refreshing his mark before he moved on, he grazed the crop over the man’s heated flesh and considered the script he’d planned earlier within his mind. It was pleasing to see the man’s nipples were standing pert and erect, but whether that was due to the chill of the evening, heightened by his previous exertions and the sweat slowly drying on his skin, anticipation for what was to come or Sherlock’s earlier efforts with the crop. Despite his exception deductive skills, Sherlock couldn’t say which he found both frustrating and intriguing.
The man’s mask was a sight to behold; it covered the entirety of his face, held in place by a hood that covered his hair and looked moulded off the helmet designs of medieval knights. There was a whole for each eye but no others, Sherlock could not see the Man’s eyes, but he shivered at the thought. The mask was designed to be light in colour, off marbled white and gold but to have highlighting cracks of black throughout it, it fit the image of the broken soldier perfectly, and the other patrons mostly let him be with a wide berth, as generally speaking the majority were overly friendly and strangely ‘cuddly’ for what the main stream would consider to be a group of deviants. The other patrons didn’t ignore the soldier, they acknowledged him openly as though he too were part of the furniture and they knew better than to try and drag him into conversation.
Mycroft smiled devilishly. “No. Something worse. If you don’t break off this marriage, I will kill John Watson.”
The blond started to make his way to the right, they raced down the street, taking a shorter route in order to intercept the taxi. Sherlock pushed his long legs to run a bit faster, with the new energy flowing through his body, he ran in the middle of the road, hurling himself into the path of the approaching cab. The taxi halted abruptly, and Sherlock quickly pulled out an ID badge and flashed it to the driver.
Sherlock angrily muted the tv. “Well, obviously I lost this round. Although technically, I did solve the case. He killed the old lady because she started to describe him. Just once, he put himself in the firing line.”
The shorter man felt touched, no one in his entire life has ever apologized to him. When he was young, all those kids who bullied him never once apologized to him, adults who have insulted him didn’t even think of saying sorry. Now this person, Sherlock, was genuinely apologizing for his actions. John was this close to accepting his apology, but those words really did sting his heart. He remained silent as he allowed Sherlock to get closer to him.
“You use this tactic quite a lot. Approach the people you find sexually attractive and pull off the charming and funny persona that you’ve mastered over the years when in reality, you’re fishing for sex. Obviously, a one-night stand. You’ve clearly had a number of lovers in the past but its perfectly clear that long relationships aren’t your
There was no answer, so Mrs. Hudson opened the door and entered the room. She saw Sherlock rummaging through a pile of papers, “Sherlock, someone is here to see you.”
Sherlock simply stared at John, an emotionless expression on his features, tiny hints of jealousy intermingling through his lagoon eyes.
The same day that Alphas lost their voice in society and were labeled as unimportant like Betas and Omegas, the government announced their monopoly on everyone’s privacy. People in London were to be watched under surveillance 24/7. Phones, computers, internet, social media, bank accounts, and anything that dealt with privacy was to be tapped into.
Sherlock was secretly pleased that John wasn’t a total idiot. “You know what it was. You’ve read the papers.”
Sherlock couldn’t help the small glimmer shining through his eyes as he watched John becoming excited. “Oh yes, your previous suspicions were correct. She’s in on it too. Now, go and arrest them, Inspector. That’s what you do best. We need to let our friendly bomber know that the case is solved.”
John growled at the pet name that was sickeningly sweet when Sherlock purred it through his lips. “Don’t fucking call me, sunshine.”
“Obviously, if you’re a genius like me, you’ll learn how to play the violin in three seconds. But since you’re not me, it’ll take a bit longer to understand how everything works. First, we’ll start off with a soft tune.”
Sherlock threw his head back as he continued teasing himself until his urge couldn’t be held back any longer. Sherlock curiously slipped his fingers past his briefs and gripped his erection, already feeling a stream of pre-cum trickling down his length.
There was no response, so Sherlock sighed as he faced the blond. His eyes were met with a soft sight. The detective rarely saw John sleeping, it was a private moment that he failed to view. Sherlock got up from his seat and approached the blond.  The detective gently combed his fingers through John’s golden strands, storing the touch of the blond’s hair in his mind palace when he stopped.
A surprised look came across Sherlock’s face as he directed his line of vision towards John. “How the hell did you know that?”
“No, no, no! Course he’s not the boy’s father! Look at the turn ups on his jeans!” Sherlock yelled out in passion while making hand gestures towards the telly and facing John.
John hesitantly came closer to the body and used all his knowledge that dealt with the medical field, in order to figure out how this woman died. The blond placed his head close to the woman’s hair and sniffed her body, then he lifted her hand and studied her skin. “
John snarled and lifted both hands into the air while longingly looking at the man on the screen and feeling his heart bursting into blooms of passion, god how he missed this man.
Why couldn’t the commencement of flaming embers flicker with the reckoning of targeting those —which meant everyone— whose secrets were on display all the time? Why couldn’t Sherlock create a rebirth of poisoning others by spreading the virus of mischief? Why couldn’t the boy be consumed by the dark injections of rage that allowed Sherlock to direct a contagious hate towards others?
Sherlock growled in bloodlust fury and spun John around by his hips, pressing John against the seat of the bus. John wanted to brace himself against the seat but Sherlock pulled back both of his hands and pressed them against John’s lower back. Sherlock fastened his slender fingers onto John’s hip and shoved his hard erection against John’s ass, slowly thrusting his erect cock in between John’s ass cheeks.
Two times, already two fucking times has John tried to kiss Sherlock. The first time they were interrupted by Mrs Hudson. The second time, there was no interruption, the only change was that the detective pulled away. During their first ruined kiss, Sherlock was willing and didn’t stop John from coming closer to him.
Jim threw the memory stick into the pool and skipped back towards John, crouching over John’s sprawled body and taking out a knife. “You don’t understand, do you Sherlock? I don’t care about the missile plans.”
“I’d be very careful about the words you use against John. He is mine and anything or anyone that belongs to me deserves respect. Is that understood?” Sherlock forcefully brought Anderson down to his knees and continued choking him.
How fucking dare, they, why did his ignorant friends — actually acquaintances — disturb the precious moment he was sharing with John?
John was sitting on his armchair as he stared at the detective across from him, currently Sherlock was staring at the pink suitcase that they both found in Lauriston Gardens, which belonged to Jennifer Wilson. “
From a certain camera outside, the footage provided was transmitted to Mycroft Holmes and even the elder Holmes felt his heart sink at the revelation John was willing to expose. And of course, his stupid brother didn’t pay attention.
Sherlock groaned and sat up dramatically, ruffling his curls in annoyance. “Where the hell is Lestrade?!”
John caught sight of a young boy who had pale skin that resembled freshly squeezed out milk, the dark curls crowning his head were a beautiful contrast to the boy’s ashen skin, the boy had opal colored eyes shining in green and blue shades of sparkling glitter, and to make things even sweeter, the boy was an Omega.
Sherlock was sitting in Greg’s chair while uploading his findings onto his website and waiting for the call to come.
The Omega boy looked down at himself and wanted to cry so badly, how could someone want Sherlock for who he was? How could the perfect Alpha even notice a feeble Omega like him? Who on earth would want damaged goods like him? It was no use trying to get this Alpha’s attention, the man would never waste his valuable time admiring a flimsy Omega like himself.
“There’s a mistake. Find out who Jennifer Wilson’s family and friends were. Find Rachel!” Sherlock and John were at the entrance of the house.
“Yes, well Custody Sergeants are known to not be hurried. The usual, fingerprints, charge sheet and a court date in the magistrates court on Tuesday.”
Better for John, cause if Sherlock appeared and started another argument, John would have lost it and most likely punched the detective in the face. John removed his jacket and went up towards his room, he approached his bed and face-planted the mattress. He took a two-hour nap and oof, that was the best nap John had in weeks.
Sherlock was inside a lab at St. Barts; deducing every information belonging to the shoes. The anatomy of the shoe was being dissected by Sherlock’s eyes; the way the laces were tied together, the sturdiness of the soles, and the small bits of matter stuck onto the shoes. Sherlock used the pieces of matter for sample testings and delved into many theories correlated to the revelation of the shoes’ importance.
They entered a specific aisle, an aisle where the book in the detective’s hands was checked out yesterday. Sherlock began to look through one shelf while John looked through the shelf across the detective. John began to take out every book on the shelf when he noticed the same mark from the bank was sprayed across the back of the shelf.
Sherlock gently squeezed John’s hand as he helped John move the bow correctly over the strings. John allowed the detective to control his movements, he gently watched as Sherlock’s fingers pressed against his. The detective slipped his fingers through John’s, physically showing John which strings should be pressed down so as to control the desired tune they wanted.
Yeah, it was just another shitty night that involved coming home, being drenched in water from head to toe and possibly catching a cold.
But curiosity got the best of John and with a final glance at the mysterious Alpha, he gave a small smile before walking down the platform and waiting for the train to stop. Sherlock felt his entire body breaking into tiny shards of glass. John doesn’t remember him; the Omega doesn’t fucking remember him.
Sherlock unlocked the phone when the voice of a woman read out a new incoming message was sent. After the voice of the woman was cut off, there were five Greenwich time signal pips playing before the phone went silent.
Greg scoffed. “What?! I can talk about him whenever I want! You just have to get used to the fact that I’m shagging your brother!”
Lestrade was confused at the intense gazes he’s currently receiving. “What? There’s nothing wrong with being a bottom. Mycroft fucks me all the time and I love it. I like him as a top.”
Sherlock stepped away from Lestrade, “I imagined this situation going another way. I would have expected him to shout and become incredibly angry which would have led to him trying to pick a fight with me. I would’ve accepted his attempt to fight me due to the fact that I haven’t had someone try to inflict violence upon me for a while. It would have been a pleasure to feel that long lost adrenaline pumping through my veins but I made a huge mistake.”
“Yeah, okay, I did. But the flirting’s over, Sherlock. Daddy’s had enough now!” Jim sang in a high voice.
Sherlock did not want to carry the burden of having others’ respect due to the name tied into his family history. No, he wanted to gain the respect from others due to the reputation he would create for himself and he wanted to carry on
“And?” The D.I. felt so uncomfortable. “I don’t know. When you introduced us… you remember… Mycroft just simply stared at me for a good five minutes. And next thing you know, he smiles at me and slips me his number in my hand. Next thing you know, I’m texting him and then he started with the whole courting thing and basically making me feel… noticed. After that, we became a couple and I don’t know, he makes me feel happy. I wouldn’t call it love at first sight but it just felt right to be with him. And once I felt comfortable with him and I realized that he loved me for me, I just knew he was the one.”
Jim stopped before leaving the room, he looked back at the Alpha who was doing a poor job of masking his heartache and answered in a passive tone. “Yes.”
Sherlock said nothing as he removed the phone from his ear, shaking his head and making his statement clear while John and Greg shrugged in disappointment, knowing that a life was taken away.
Mr Ewart shook his head and answered Sherlock’s question. “No, those are jags. Which are still lovely cars.”
Sherlock kept looking everywhere, failing to see the Golem sneaking up behind him and covering Sherlock’s mouth with his enormous hand. Golem began to smother Sherlock while Sherlock hastily struggled against the man’s strength. Sherlock tried to push away Golem’s hand from his face when John appeared before them.
The entire kingdom was eager to see the most awaited wedding between their Prince Sherlock Holmes and his husband to be, Prince John Watson. Out of the entire Holmes family, the one who should have been appointed king was Mycroft Holmes, the elder. Except Mycroft had no interest in becoming a king, he preferred having a seat among the knights who were treasured in the king’s round table.
Sherlock stood tall, looking at his group and deducing their thoughts in three seconds. Sherlock ignored the loud questions thrown his way and walked towards the spot where a lovely puddle of John’s blood glimmered underneath the moonlight. Sherlock pressed his nimble fingers against the still freshly damp essence that gave John Watson the precious gift of life and rubbed the beautifully colored liquid between his fingertips.
Hello lovely readers! How are you all doing? Well, my semester finished and I’m free to chill and live but most of all, be fucking lazy in bed while writing hehe. So, to those who are following my other works, expect updates for the rest of this month before i go back to school.
The Omega boy quivered at the sound of the deep and dark voice that was spoken next to his ear, Sherlock felt himself melting when he could feel the Alpha’s body morphing against his. The boy remained silent until he grew the courage to turn his head to the side and face his rescuer. The Omega boy felt his knees going weak when he met the gaze of the Alpha holding him so dearly.
"You're feeling better," John comments, when they've finally settled down into a mess of sweaty limbs, out of breath and too warm, and the button on John's denims pressing uncomfortably into Sherlock's hip bone but neither of them particularly motivated to untangle.
Sherlock tips his head up to the ceiling, needing a nice, plain, distraction-free drawing board on which to do some hasty calculations.
“Apology accepted.” It was stiff and stilted, just like his posture, but John’s smile spread into an outright grin.
His eyes cut over to his cards, now literally on the table. A relationship - whether friends long lost or something more about to begin - goes two ways. The image of a door with a two person control locking mechanism pops into his mind, and he smiles at the metaphor. (A Bond film tonight?) For all his protestations that a reply isn't necessary, perhaps John is waiting for Sherlock's response. And Sherlock himself needs John's answer in order to understand what paths are available to him. To them.
, but his own Glock is safetied and slipped behind a cushion. When this relaxing of defensive measures brings no protest from the soldier standing guard, he floomphs down onto the sofa and arranges himself into the best languid lounge he can manage in the few seconds he has left. There is an eloquent snort from before him.
He closes his eyes this time, eager to collect and compare and consider. Focuses entirely on touch, blocks out sight and sound and scent so that he can concentrate. Hums contentedly when John brings his other hand up to cradle his jaw and sweeps his thumb along the side of his face.
"And this is my partner, Sherlock," John says to a stranger cooing over Watson. He asks if that's all right, too. Sherlock hums yes.
Nearly two thousand pounds out of John's pocket later, he demands to know what in the bloody hell he's paying for. When he's told that it's up to him to decide what he wants out of his care, John gets even more frustrated.
John's quick hop-bounce across the sofa catches him by surprise, and the rest of his confession falls, ricochets off a cushion, and rolls away. Hands enter his view but before he can start up the fear that John means to take the decision literally out of
The brolly enters the room first, followed by gleaming brogues and impeccable suit and toffeed nose.
“Flip over and scoot  down,” he commanded, nudging John with one knee while he pecked away at  the remote. He saw John uncurl a bit and peer up at him, but kept his  gaze locked on to the television.
Sherlock wrinkles his nose, though it's tempered by a smile. The happiness to be found in being silly together is quite ridiculous. He's turned into a sentimental sop and does not give one good God damn about it.
“You do it all the time!” Sherlock shouted, sounding exasperated now, as if John’s slowness was just one burden too many for the detective to bear. “You appointed yourself my blogger but you’re so eager to hit ‘post’ and start chatting with people in the comments that you pretend that things like composition and style don’t exist, and you also serve as my email triage unit but you spend much more time and care in pecking out so-called poetry to your girlfriends.”
After  mentally making a note to brush up on codependency, he set his book  aside and tried cajoling Sherlock back into the conversation.
"No, certainly not." Sherlock curls himself around his cup and gives an exaggerated shudder at the havoc a rich, oily meal would wreak upon his gastrointestinal tract just now, and earns a snort from his friend. (Friend! John John
He does not square his shoulders or straighten his spine. He is not a soldier, like John. He is an impulsive amateur scientist with finely honed mental skills and no clue how to handle even his own heart. Instead of coming up with plans of attack, he throws volatile chemicals about and then waits to see what happens.
"Sherlock, if anyone should be saying thank you, it's me, not you," John protests. He sets his plate down and takes the other as well, and reaches over as if to clasp Sherlock's hands before halting suddenly.
What happens is that John decides that Sherlock is amazing and extraordinary and fantastic and worth killing a man for.
“Guessing these aren’t happy  tears?” he joked, patting awkwardly at a tricep. Watery eyes blinked  rapidly, knocking yet more tears loose, then fixed on him, wide like  they were surprised to find him there.
. That I want you; as much of you as you're willing to give me. And if it's friendship and a flatshare and no more I'll still be perfectly happy to have that, and only that. But if you want more too, then...well, I'm telling you that my answer will be a very enthusiastic yes."
, too," John interrupts, scowling now and looking like he's near to coming off the sofa to literally fight the matter out. "This Project Pompous or whatever had better be a one-off, Mycroft. He doesn't even
It's like reverse napping; he sleeps for long stretches and then catches a brief taste of lucidity before falling back into unconsciousness. In the first of these intervals he's fed a cup of watered down, low sodium, fat free chicken broth. Sherlock wrinkles his nose at being told the menu, but once the warm liquid washes over his tongue he hums in amazement and pleasure.
"Just...your face," John giggles, and oh how he's (dreamed of) missed that sound! Sherlock pretends offense at his face being deemed laugh-worthy, and turns away to focus on his eggy toast. Getting a lacy bit of crisp egg-edge is enough to pull his attention away from John entirely, and he sighs in gustatory ecstacy, setting off another giggle from his chef.
. If Mycroft hadn't needed me to talk to her and get her to keep mum about all this, it might've been days before I remembered to call her. It was like...relying on a penlight to navigate a dark room...and when you get out and it's all bright outside, you can't even see the beam anymore. And this is such a fucking awful way to describe an amazing woman, like I was just using her to get by, and I--"
Sherlock drags their entwined digits closer so that he can press a kiss to John's knuckles, then settles their hands right where they are, over the right lobe of John's liver. His curls are given an answering peck, and then the story is picked back up in a more Watsonian fashion.
"So that's why. That's the only reason," John murmurs, and gives Sherlock's head a tiny shake as if to ensure the sound vibrations are properly traveling along his ear canals and drums and mallei and so forth. Wanting to make sure that what he's saying is getting through. "And, well, with my luck this has bugger-all to do with your request but I couldn't take the chance. I've wanted to tell you for so long anyway, so there it is."
"No, but you did miss a little detail," John notes, still relaxed but now with a hint of teasing. It draws Sherlock's mouth into a pout even while he sags a bit with relief.
John has a bit of a reputation, with how quickly he'll vine and leaf and bud. Where most of his army mates patiently cultivate relationships over the course of weeks or months, John can pop buds practically at first sight, if the attraction is strong enough. He doesn't even wait for love; sometimes respect or lust is enough.
The reward for staying obediently put upon the sofa is the sight of John carefully stepping out of the kitchen with a loaded tray, pausing to snort as he catches sight of Sherlock eagerly rising out of his slouch. It
It would almost seem casual and careless, except for how insistently they keep seeking each other out again.
"The ingredients you've been cooking with are of much higher quality than you generally procure. Even as concerned for my health as you are, you wouldn't have splurged on Bresse chicken breasts or pullet eggs. I recognize the tea blend as being one that Mycroft favors as well. He - or one of his staff - is choosing and financing the groceries. But they're not arriving in regular deliveries.
John took a stunted breath as he felt the pinch in his side throb, the adrenaline was starting to fade now the fight was over and he knew he wouldn’t have a lot of time until he lost consciousness from blood-loss or, more likely, shock.
John began slowly stitching what he could of the wound, a lot of the flesh was missing, luckily for Mr Holmes Grimms healed uncommonly fast for Kehrseite.
Sherlock’s eyes burned as the followed the man’s retreating, though thoroughly abused back, until he was completely out of sight.
It wasn’t until one of the Dungeon Masters, a surprisingly supple female with a keen eye for crops and whips herself, touched Sherlock’s crop arm that he realised his hour had passed and despite the other plans he’d held he too had wasted his time on simple, though forceful, impact play. Sherlock received a polite applauding and commiseration from the audience as he untied the Soldier who looked like he’d be fine with continuing.
Mycroft, in his position As the British Government, had made an agreement with his Wesen counterpart that Military affairs, so long as they remained in the military were not ‘Grimm’ concerns. Having a Grimm overseeing things kept the Wesen aware and any warning signs were dealt with immediately. Except for Doctor Watson.
From the hips down the man was dressed the same, however he was no longer topless and had again changed his mask. Now the soldier worse a grey singlet and the camouflage jacket which matched his trousers with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. His mask tonight was a sculpted silver half mask, much like the ones worn by most of the men here. It still maintained a medieval and tarnished look as his previous ones had but this one revealed much more of his face. Now Sherlock could openly appreciate not only the man’s lips and jaw but also the side swept ash blonde hair that had previously been hidden beneath the hoods of his masks.
The wind turned cold on his neck and the screams stopped, John looked at the face of the soldier frozen in pain with eyes wide and unseeing. John felt the shards of metal cut through his gloves and bite at his hands even as he worked harder and harder to clear the debris even as the blood cooled and the nurses attempted to pull him away. Calling to him that there was nothing more he could do, that others needed them now, needed him now but John could not seem to stop, could not take his hands from the young man, could not close his eyes to the blood and death as the blinding sun glinting off the silver medallion resting in a motionless hand. The light shining off the medal grew brighter and brighter until it was all the Doctor could see, pain shooting threw his head even as he shot up in his lumpy bed, soaked in sweat, sheets tangled around his body, sun shining through a gap in the curtains directly over his pillow.
Though he’d already dismissed the soldier from his mind Sherlock had no expected himself to not be so readily forgotten as the man stepped away from the fencing and towards the detective. Leaning in close to Sherlock as he passed by the thoughtful man the soldier paused just a moment by the detective’s ear and in a surprisingly dark voice whispered a single word which made Sherlock burn within before he moved on to leave the club as was his usual practice following a scene.
The first candle was lit, a beautiful crimson red, and a hush fell over the audience as it dripped onto her skin. Her response was exquisite, ‘Lucy’ arched her back as much as she could given the restraints which held her in place, her mouth opened in a silent gasp even as the next drop fell. Sherlock watched in avid fascination as the Captain painted this woman’s back in crimson wax while she moaned and squirmed beneath him. Slowly he changed candles, slowly increasing the heat while changing angles, distances and patterns, all under the supervision of the DM… though Sherlock realised quickly that it was less about supervision and more about control. It seemed ‘Lucy’ was a pet of that particular Master, who was only okay with her playing as long as he was supervising. Upon realising that the sickly feeling in Sherlock’s chest vanished and he found himself able to enjoy the performance more openly.
Miss Wenceslas flinched at Sherlock’s rabid tone but Sherlock ignored her. “No, shut up. Don’t say anything. It only works if I figure it out. It must be possible. It must be staring me in the face.”
People were at risk of being harassed, raped, robbed, insulted, and beaten to death. This alone helped increase the number of deaths by physical violence at the hand of a human. Due to the lack of functioning hospitals and pharmacies, masses of people have died due to viruses. The spike of victims arose within a high range that accumulated in less than a month.
Sherlock pulled out a piece of paper and began to write down a few words, folding the paper in half and slipping money inside the folded paper. The detective told the cabbie to stop the cab, asking the man to wait, for he’d be right back. Sherlock left the cab and approached a homeless woman, giving her the piece of paper and money.
Sherlock happily kicked the door open and left the gallery. Miss Wenceslas was left alone, she walked towards the painting and stared at it for a long time.
Sherlock was jolted across the coach, the sudden movement of the horses running wild caused the prince to bang his head against the side of the door. The prince groaned in pain, caressing the side of his head when he noticed the tree before them was on fire. Sherlock rolled his eyes and deduced that the horses became spooked and due to the lack of control from the coachman, the horses were running on a wild spur.
Sherlock and John were in Mr Ewart’s office, Mr Ewart was responsible for renting the car to Mr Monkford. “Can’t see how I can help you gentlemen.”
Sherlock directed his ocean blue eyes towards the smaller man who had fair skin with a light tan and short brown hair with slight streaks of grey hair. “He recently began working here, eight months ago. This is his primary job, comes in about 4-5 days a week. Always has morning shifts and rarely has any night shifts. Doesn’t live far from here, probably three blocks away. He lives alone and has no pets-“
John wanted to speak, to tell this man to piss off but he couldn’t therefore he felt vulnerable and powerless.
The detective couldn’t help the enormous smile gracing his lips, god he loved how John wasn’t terribly slow and Sherlock knew that he’d seen this place before but his lovely John managed to beat him to the punch. “Then let’s go.”
“Careful, John. You’ll regret these words when I have you at the palm of my hand. Whether you like it or not, you’re mine already. You just need to come to terms with it. And if pain is the only way you’ll see that, then I’d be more than happy to oblige and give you pain.”
“Yeah, exciting isn’t it. Now, Sherlock, what the hell do you have for me?” Lestrade asked impatiently.
Sherlock was looking out the window. “If she deviated by one word, the sniper would have set her off.”
Sherlock untangled himself from John’s body, making sure that John could sit up by himself before he remembered the gun on the floor.
Sherlock began to circle Eric. “Judging by the red lipstick smudge on the collar of your poorly hidden shirt, it’s obvious you’ve had sexual intercourse with a mysterious woman this morning. In fact.” The detective looked down at his watch. “You had sexual intercourse three hours ago when you became bored of her. So, you headed out of your flat, keeping in mind that you needed another form of entertainment.”
Sherlock walked over to Jim, pointing the gun towards Moriarty’s head. “What if I was to shoot you now? Right now?”
Again, he was rejected, the recruiter told him to hit the road and forget about joining the army. The recruiter made it clear that they didn’t want to take care of a baby who couldn’t even speak. John walked away, sad and worthless. He returned home and forced himself to find any job and move out of his parents’ house. It took a few try’s but he managed to get a job at a café. The owners were good people and they were the first ones to not discriminate against John and luckily, they knew sign language as well. They trained him and made it possible for John to run things smoothly without having problems with the customers.
The blond lowered his head and smiled. He reached forward, pushing the newspaper away from the detective’s face, exposing Sherlock’s features. “
All those centuries without John had been a living hell but now the restoration of their love can commence a second time.
Mrs. Hudson couldn’t stop her comments. “Oh now, don’t be shy. You really are. Look at that face, those eyes, your hair, and I’m sure your body is not disappointing. You’d be a delicious treat to whoever captures your heart.” She wiggled her eyebrows towards Sherlock. “Am I not right Sherlock?”
“Well Sherlock dear, think about it. Society has named politicians with rich last names and reputable tempers to dictate that everyone should be normal. But when people are out of their minds and going bat shit crazy, it’s almost a sixth sense that we have to put away criminals, psychopaths, and cold-blooded killers inside four walls that promise to deliver punishment and rebirth.”
Mycroft smiled. “Since I met Gregory.” The older man began to walk away. “Till then little brother.”
Sherlock’s features darkened but the Alpha remained calm as he allowed the idiot before him to point a gun at his heart. “Introductions must be established. Should they not?”
The prince sat back miserably in his seat and felt a sharp pain in his chest, all he ever wanted was to be happy with John. Of course, Sherlock didn’t know everything about John but there was a pull, a bond, that could be created between the two of them and Sherlock would be a fool to let an opportunity for love to slip past his fingers.
Sally looked back at Sherlock and with a nod, Sherlock cocked both guns and faced Bainbridge. In a spilt second, Sherlock snarled in rage as a warped misinterpretation clouded his judgement. From Sherlock’s point of view, he saw Bainbridge attacking John. From John’s point of view, Bainbridge was still unconscious and John had finally managed to keep the werewolf upright so he could swoop down and lift the werewolf onto his shoulder.
Sherlock took the invitation and inhaled John’s scent, exaggerating the breathing sounds that escaped his nose and seductively purred out, “I feel my ears burning, are you guys talking about me?”
John unwittingly provides him a hiding place in which to recover, the both of them happy to indulge in mutual comfort after the stark review of the two years they'd spent apart. A quick hand clasp turns into a rough grab at his shoulder, and then John pulls him into a sideways embrace despite big brother looking on. Sherlock noses along a shirt-collar and breathes in washing powder and shower gel, warmth and safety, and sighs gratitude into the crook of John's neck.
Reservations! Ha! He has none, not anymore. He's finished,  he's succeeded, and now he's going to see John. It's going to be fine. Everything is going to be fine, all fine. He's giddy with relief and drunk on hope.
"Look Sherlock," he fumbles out, awkward and hesitant and determined and courageous and oh how it makes Sherlock want to weep for how much he has loved and missed this man!
John does not return to Eleanor's office. He stops showing up at Marcus's, too, and refuses to return the receptionist's calls about his missed appointments.
"Mrs. Hudson's on holiday with an old friend, also courtesy of Mycroft. Not sure who or where actually; like I said, couldn't be arsed about the details. Spot on with the mold in C, and they're actually doing a renno, not just banging on pots to sound busy. Maybe there're some construction blokes mixed in with security, or some of the agents are handy with a hammer? Dunno, quite frankly don't care. As for me, I've had a little crisis and am off in the hills somewhere, hiking and trying to find myself or some bollocks like that."
Remembering the notecards puts paid to that notion. No, never again will he take John for granted. He may slip up, of course, but he'll
John dutifully fulfills this item, carefully monitoring the goldenness of the toast under Sherlock's supervision, and even tries the results out himself. He admits it's delicious and then reluctantly declares that it probably won't hurt anything to indulge in the fat- and carbohydrate-laden snack once in a while. The way he closes his eyes and hums appreciatively over his last buttery bite makes Sherlock think that it will not be too arduous a task to tempt him into making the sweet treat at least every other Sunday.
Sherlock's first instinct is to scoff and sneer and reply in the negative. He's grateful, now, for the half-masticated bite of sandwich keeping him mum. He forces the food down and overcomes the instinctual urge to react defensively, and tries to think of how to answer honestly.
He gets a hum by way of response; interrogative, affectionate, attentive. The smile accompanying it is content, sated, and sleepy. The man delivering all this is gorgeously, gloriously naked and splayed loose-limbed all over Sherlock's sheets. It's all
“Random stranger. Literally bumped into him at a gallery. He looked at me like he was looking at the art, and it wasn’t appreciative. Then he called me - what was it - a touch-starved, love-famished skeleton of a child hiding behind money, playing with lives because no one ever taught me to play with blocks.”
John is wide-eyed and already reaching for the notecards, but at the last moment his hands merely overlap Sherlock's fingers a bit, not taking away or taking over.
John and Sherlock only end up arguing instead of explaining. Before  they can escalate to shouting and draw the attention of the nursing  staff, Mycroft steps in.
The opening sequence of the movie has the consulting detective questioning the wisdom of the choice. The titular character falls and falls and falls through the air to his supposed death, leaving behind a colleague who blames themself for the tragedy, but John's reaction is no worse than a hitch in his breathing and a soft sigh. One hand sneaks over to lightly curl around Sherlock's wrist, fingers resting over a quickening pulse. The sight enchants Sherlock for a good half hour, at the end of which he is slumped down and sliding over and snoozing away on John's shoulder, and all in all it's the quietest he's ever been during a Bond night.
By some miracle, his mobile was still in one hand rather than having been thrown at his flatmate’s insufferable face, and he opened up the Contacts app to look for his current girlfriend’s number.
The king to whom all these outrageous obeisances are being paid lounges poolside with a humble IPA in his hand, looking more relaxed than Greg's ever seen him. There's even a sleepy sort of smile on the man's face that takes years off of him and almost tempts Greg to take a surreptitious photo.
"Does he pay better kickbacks than your other colleagues?" John sneers. He thinks Eleanor has a point about her not being suited for what he wants, but he doesn't like being told 'no'.
John is carefully poring over his handful of petals, turning a few intact flowers over with one careful finger.
"All right?" John rumbles, and Sherlock jumps a bit in his embrace. "You were doing your thinky thing but then you suddenly went all stiff."
“Right, here, drink this,” John orders, and grabs his hand to press a mug into it. Sherlock obediently drops his gaze from the ceiling and swallows down the small amount of liquid. Huh. Not tea.
"I've, um...got some notes," John confesses. Sherlock eyes the cards curiously, finding them to indeed be a handful of index cards packed full of scribbles. The doctor's handwriting adheres to the adage but Sherlock can make out a few phrases beginning with "I".
I used Irene Adler's letter from "A Scandal in Bohemia" as a general outline and put Mycroft Holmes in the place of the King. Kate is the Kate from BBC's "Sherlock", however. I took her last name from the actress who played her.
Two  more big fat tears were shaken loose, and John gently knuckled them  away. It made Sherlock shiver and sigh and close his eyes.
The fact that John did not slam his head against the wall in frustration might largely be attributed to the fact that he was too far away to reach it with any immediacy.
Sherlock wants to latch on to that one precious word and tug and dig until he's been reassured that John is indeed going to be his flatmate again, but there is a more vital point that he must address first. With one hand pressing upon the stack of John's notecards, as if to a talisman that grants courage, Sherlock reaches with his other hand and mirrors the wrist-clasp he'd been given a few minutes before.
"We can't even get on a plane, much less into the country before his brother's goons are plucking us off the street and throwing us into a cab, but I think we eventually managed to be so annoying that they just started sending us updates on the promise that we'd stop trying to get in the way. I rather feel like a kid being handed a lolly and told to run off and play, but I have to admit it's a lot easier and cheaper this way."
fallen asleep, though he hadn't technically "gone to bed". He's a bit impressed, and more than a bit on edge now.)
Or perhaps they're already three years into their romance, but only just now learning to celebrate it together.
and aware of and grateful for my body in a way that seems completely new to me. I am experiencing actual cravings for food, if you can believe it."
"One thing I have never lacked, Mrs. Hudson, is confidence," he says dryly, but she piffs and flaps her hand dismissively.
“Yes John?” Sherlock asks sweetly, giving John a picture perfect Disney princess smile. It sends chills of horror up and down the doctor’s spine.
John Watson they're in company with, but soon enough the evidence of obscene wealth all around them is politely gotten over and
), Sherlock fades out soon after their conversation. Nor does he manage to stay awake for more than an hour or so at a time for another few days, much to his frustration. The painkillers John is adding to his IV line are keeping him comfortable, but also making him dozy on top of the fatigue he's still battling.
"It's nothing," he eventually answers, getting back to the topic at hand. "Just trying to acclimate myself. Or rather, I am attempting to acclimatize. I suppose it's more accurate to say that I am adjusting to the entirely new realm of a romantic relationship, rather than adjusting to the addition of kissing to our existing partnership."
(Perhaps the back and forth rule applies to sessions of kissing, not individual kisses. Must research.)
Sherlock's so thrown - thrilled, broken, hopeful, devastated - that he can't immediately recall what request he's made, and for a horrified split-second wonders if he'd actually written down his eighty-three and hundred twenty requests (1. Kiss me.) and accidentally given them over along with his actual message. But then he remembers, and John elaborates anyway.
John peeked out from under his  forearm. He seemed to be frowning again, though it was difficult to tell  without a better view of his eyebrows.
Lover? Technically true, but somehow a bit too libidinous and limited a word for Sherlock's tastes. John is -
, John. He knows it'll only take me a few hours at the most to disable the security measures. Once I have access to the internet and a means to communicate with whomever I wish, what would be the point of continuing to restrict me to the upper floors? Tyranny! Petty, fatuous tyranny!"
"I'm shut up in the loo attached to your room and she's pointing out that I can't even be sure you'll survive - God, that made me so angry - or that you'll want anything more than friendship even if you do. She wanted me to wait to make decisions, at the very least. Called it ridiculous to do otherwise. I mean, I suppose she had a point, but I couldn't think about you rationally. I just knew that whatever happened, you were it for me. I'd got you back, and there wasn't going to be room for anyone else. Not enough, at any rate, for anything serious. Basically just like it was before, except now I was being honest about it."
The warm baths and soothing massages afterwards also help to make the physical therapy well worth the exertion.
John  teleported down the hallway somehow, snatched the cigarettes out of his  best friend, flatmate, and date candidate’s hands - “John!” - and  chucked them down the stairs for Mrs. Hudson to trip over, tut at, and  bin.
S: Too pedestrian? I coooouuuuld...um...cut you into some cocaine and snort you? I'd probably want to get high if I was grieving your loss.
They share a conspiratorial grin, and Sherlock wants to jump on every bit of furniture in the room while hollering his glee at having such a perfectly pugnacious and pugilistic protector. Or at the very least, he wishes he was strong enough that the mere thought of doing so doesn't make him want to lie down. He settles for mourning aloud that Mycroft's no doubt had all the footage destroyed, and delights in the snicker it draws from his knight in woolen armor.
It helps that not only is the businessman former military, he's kept in fighting form out of sheer bloody-mindedness despite spending most of his days in meetings. The man's also got a competitive streak wider than the executive conference room table. He earns the respect of Greg's three friends within the first five miles, and thankfully all the good-natured joshing that the group uses in lieu of encouragement is taken in stride. John coolly accepts the remarks about his stature and hair and ears and slings some rather creative insults right back without missing a beat. Anything edging too close to personal, such as inquiries or imaginings about family and lovers, is merely met with a growled "fuck off" and refusal to engage, and that's that.
“He thinks that I need some excitement in my life.” The executive huffs in amusement. “So it’s been a few weeks now, of offering to take him to Italy or Japan for a weekend and instead eating Chinese takeaway at his flat while he rants about how unimaginative criminals are, or getting dragged down dark alleys by the hand like a little kid so we can watch for a burglar or blackmailer or whatever. The turnover rate in my security detail’s giving HR the fits.”
Sherlock reluctantly allows himself to become immersed in Bohemian politics. Czechia holds no particular allure for him, but perhaps a little time and distance away from London will help him to gain a bit of perspective, and it's always handy to have Mycroft owe him a favor.
Sherlock weeps with all the abandon of a small child, pouring out pent up emotion at full bore until finally, finally the flood dwindles to a trickle and then to little drips, and he is utterly emptied out. He sighs and hiccups and shudders in John's arms, goes limp, and falls asleep so quickly it's like a gentle faint.
Happily, he realizes that he can still run his mind through its paces even if his body is confined to bed. All of John's strictures have been regarding physical overexertion, not mental, after all. Sherlock examines this loophole from all angles. Concluding with a satisfied nod that it's got quite a comfortable margin of safety, he then gathers up observations that he hadn't been consciously collecting but knows he's made all the same, and begins doing some maintenance on his Mind Palace.
As far as proofs go, it's not exactly something that would stand up in court. The impulse to show his writing to bolster his side of the debate is not entirely without merit, however. People tend to believe what's written down. It is a habit acquired as soon as c-a-t is taught to be synonymous with the drawing of a kitten, reinforced throughout one's school years, and subsequently bolstered and taken advantage of by the media. Sherlock has scribed his guilt onto paper; igitur verum.
Silence is John's only reply for a long, long while, and then he seems to shake himself out of whatever reverie he'd fallen into and attempts to repair some of the damage. Pestering Sherlock for directions and details all the while, he damps the frizz back down a bit, then a bit more, then carefully finger combs mousse in, doling the stuff out in over-cautious, walnut-sized blobs. Sherlock is still a mess once John is finished, but it's a great improvement over the dandelion clock look he'd been modeling nearly an hour earlier.
“Now get out!” Sherlock snapped, stomping a foot for emphasis and miraculously not coming off like a three year old while doing it.
Can confirm no amnesia and slight xerostomia. Expressive dysphasia was only in you. Also our recollections of proposing to each other with walnut prawns seem to be accurate. Anthea just dropped off papers and a stack of CCTV stills tucked into a congratulatory muffin basket. My prawn was still in my shirt pocket, by the way. You may want to sort out your laundry instead of letting it pile up as usual. I'll be in my room eating muffins in bed if you want to talk about any of this.
It’s the easiest out he’d ever been offered, but John  stayed silent. Sherlock wanting “a proper kiss” had particularly struck  him, for one. It was sweet and endearing and a tiny bit sad, which made  John hesitate to jump out the conversational window he’d been shoved  toward. He also remained mum on this point because there was no universe  in which Sherlock would react favorably to being told that John felt  badly for him in any way, shape, or form.
So to sum up, I want you to know that I understand why you left, that I'm so sorry you had to leave at all, and alone on top of it, and that I'm so glad you've come back..."
“Pearl  Garden and tea, yes please,” John said. “Archeology marathon, fine.  Gemma, no. God no, she chucked me months ago. I meant…well, I was  thinking of you, for the…um. Company. Only if you’re okay with it. Just  sharing the couch is fine, too. We don’t need to…um. Touch.
Eleanor Dunaway may be the one billing him four hundred and seventy-five quid per hour, but Martha Hudson is the one who manages to finally kick over John's basket of issues and make him start sorting the shit from the shine.
"Well done, Sherlock," Mycroft says quietly, which is surprising enough. But he gives Sherlock a subtle but genuinely proud smile and glances at the folder, but then at John as well, and it sinks the younger Holmes into a flustered silence.
"We can pull these up a bit, to hide our faces," Sherlock explains. "And I've got a hood to hide my hair."
"He's still in France," Greg reports, fingers running down his notepad. They've got some of the best cybersecurity available, but John still has a distrust of such things when it comes to personal matters. Not to mention the revelation that Sherlock isn't quite "nothing, with no family connections". On a computer monitor, Mycroft Holmes appears to be nothing more than a mid-level bureaucrat, but the reality that they've crossed paths with a few times now is much more unsettling. It makes John cautious in a way that few things - or people - do, and he makes sure that anything to do with Sherlock stays only briefly on paper before being shredded and then soaked or burned, and Greg is the sole person entrusted with the details.
"I am trying to tell you - and apparently doing a piss-poor job of it, so no more faffing about - that I love you. That I'm
"Look at you, being brave and honest and openly communicating," John adds, smiling but not mocking, not at all. Obviously proud, in fact, and it makes Sherlock preen a bit, and relax more than a bit.
"A bit..." Sherlock begins, and gets all the more fussed when he can't come up with a proper description of how he feels. Every word he can think of - discomposed, unsettled, uncertain - sounds too negative for the gift he was given, and finally he settles on a tentative "...off balance?"
"...and now I'm thinking I've offended you terribly," he tentatively adds, despite the evidence - John's hand softly come up to cradle his face - to the contrary.
Sherlock smooths one thumb over the whorls and slashes of John's writing and then, because he is a genius, has a brilliant idea.
“Listen,  kay?” he interrupted desperately. “Just listen. This may be the most important conversation you and I  ever have so pay attention, and…and be honest. Two questions; yes or no is all I  need. But I definitely need you to be truthful. All right?”
His psychologist gazes at him with her usual demeanor of boredom. It’s soothing in an odd way; someone who isn’t afraid of him.
Sherlock goes still, then noting that John is probably waiting for some sort of response, nods slightly. There's hardly any space between them, and the moment is unbearably full of sensation; noses brushing, skin and skulls rubbing, shallow breaths mingling between them. This is why most heart attacks occur in the morning; Sherlock isn't sure his body can take the sudden switch from peaceful slumber to...to...
“How  was that?” he asked, settling smoothly into his  I-am-about-to-be-given-a-right-good-bollocking-by-a-superior-officer  face. His body had automatically shifted into parade rest as well, and  he had to struggle not to fidget awkwardly out of it as Sherlock stared  at him.
Head's up: John reacts protectively to having an unexpected visitor and Sherlock briefly panics. It's just Mycroft, though, so no worries.
"Just computer work," Sherlock scoffs, piqued at John's attention focused elsewhere. "Hates crowds and dirt and everything useful for data gathering."
"But you knew most of that already, and you also know I'm a very busy man keeping all your assets safe, so I'm curious about why we're having this meeting over dinner instead of in the atrium or your car like usual."
Sherlock blinks, spiraling thoughts and emotions jolted off to the side, leaving him only puzzled for a moment. John looking unperturbed but for some mild impatience is not one of the potential outcomes he's considered. (Fever dream? Structural damage to the Mind Palace? Alternate universe?)
The heavy-handed flirting has also stopped, and John seems to be approaching Sherlock now with a dogged determination to at least claim the title of friend and partner, if he cannot become his lover.
“I…already peeled the labels off,” Sherlock confesses. “I wanted to run the experiment blind and then do blood draws to determine–”
"So I had a 'natural emotional reaction' and stopped there instead of moving on to 'step two: deliberate thought'," John confesses. "How calm am I supposed to be before I try to have the conversation over again? I'm in a bit of a time crunch."
Greg attempts to talk to John about it, but only manages a few words before getting reamed for his presumption. At the next mud run, he tells Colin, Tom, and Dan that it's the busy season at work when they ask where Watson's hiding his fine self. They grumble good-naturedly and melt easily back into their former four man configuration.
“Keen observation,” The young man said with yet another bored eyeroll, “Assam bold in a pot, soy milk, two scones with apricot jam and no cream.”
But that was better than the wolves hidden in their defences, filling out the upper ranks and covering up Wesen crime. Not that Mycroft was much better, infiltrating the British Government as a Grimm and making his own survival assured through sheer position and status.
John didn’t hesitate when he walked forward and pulled the trigger, one bullet after another. Sherlock was still a bit dazed but immediately recovered when the sound of bullets were whooshing through the air and aiming towards his chest. Sherlock lifted his gun and blocked the bullets that were coming from John, one after another, bullets were limply crashing against one another and uselessly falling onto the ground.
Sherlock stole a glance at the stairs when he instantly recognized the back of that man. The detective ran towards the door when he tripped on one of his experiments. “Dammit, Mrs. Hudson!! Can you please for once keep this flat clean!” Sherlock ran past her, “Why didn’t you tell me it was John?!” He barked out as he ran down the stairs, still wearing his blue pajamas and navy-blue silk robe.
John fucking Watson, the hottest boy with arctic blue eyes and shining golden blond hair. Oh John, a creation given to Sherlock by Satan himself, an entity destined to fall at Sherlock’s feet.
Sherlock tossed the syringe into the trash bin and recklessly headed down the stairs when he heard Mrs Hudson leaving her flat. “Ah, Hudders. Off to see your sister again or are seeing the owner of Speedy’s next door? Either way, he’s married and has four kids. I doubt you’re the kind of Omega that participates in polygamy marriages.”
Once he said the name, John removed his foot and instantly, the man died. The blond looked at Sherlock, as the detective ran the name through his head.
The woman delivered another blow to John’s face. “The hairpin! The Empress pin valued at 9 million sterling. We had a buyer in the west and then one of our people was greedy, he took it, brought it back to London and you along with you partner, have been searching!”
So, psychosomatic limp then. Fascinating. But a small defect was not enough to put Sherlock off. What captured Sherlock’s attention was the way the prince held himself, clearly the man was a fighter and he was strong. Sherlock never craved to live the rest of life with someone at his side because he didn’t do relationships but if he dared to dream about living his life with someone, then he wanted someone who would make his life worth while.
It seems like a fair opening for an "obviously" and a shared giggle, but Sherlock doesn't trust his vocal chords with so many syllables. Or even a single syllable. He manages a shaky nod and then as John leans in, a quick inhale, like he's jumped off a bridge and is headed straight for the water.
“No  need to panic,” Sherlock snapped over one rigid shoulder. “I’ve no  intention of conscripting unwilling participants for this particular  experiment.”
He’d  rather expected a detailed spreadsheet of Sherlock’s past experiences  so that he could recreate them to the best of his abilities and give his  flatmate new data to compare against, but other than some occasional  hints -
After opening fragrant cartons or boxes or tubs at 221B, they spend many a night settled side by side on the couch, always close enough to knock elbows or nudge into the other's knee. Sherlock steals bits out of John's plate or bowl, and they're constantly in each other's field of vision as they talk over clues or sort through the research scattered all over the floor and coffee table and sometimes even draped over spare bits of couch and their own knees.
