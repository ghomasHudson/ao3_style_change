Knelt on the bed at his side, John muttered soft words in the detective's ears who, a bit nervous, stirred his limbs, tightening the ropes.
The officer swallowed with difficulty, trying to show a calm he was far from feeling, and looked again at the DI, imploring his help.
“Miracle happens every day,” chuckled the landlady, climbing the stairs after them.
He felt the metallic taste of blood in his mouth. Shit. How could Mycroft have been so wrong? The information he gave them about Mike's whereabouts led them straight into a trap.
"Yes, it is," she replied.
"But there is no full moon," Sherlock whispered, a bit lost.
"It was Sherlock himself who asked us to clean the books for her daughter."
Sherlock stared at him until his eyes caught sight of shadows moving behind Bill.
"Why?" roared Mycroft looking at Lestrade. "Why did he have to sedate us? Why go alone when he's got a team with him?
"It all seemed so real… he told me he was part of MI 6. He even showed me photos of my war crimes with me on them! I was horrified. I couldn't believe it, but, with all those proofs… How could I go back to my old life, my son, after committing those atrocities? I was disgusted and horrified by myself".
"You always said you didn't need any more power, that your minor position was enough for you," Sherlock reproached him, opening the case and checking its contents.
The man nodded. He raised his hands and turned around slowly. Luke walked over and pulled down the cloth covering his face, getting a shocked cry from the soldiers who could not believe it. There, in front of them, was Mike.
Why?"
He shook his head, tears shining in his eyes.
His phone vibrated.
Then, he waited. He knew, sooner or later, the other would get suspicious about their buddies’ silence.
He found himself sat on a chair in what seemed an ancient living room, the walls covered with shelves full of old books.
"For him."
Seconds later, Sherlock heard him yelling his name and felt his hot cum inside him. He cried out across his third orgasm, only a few drops of cum dripping from his cock, his back arching, his hole clenching around John's cock. The doctor embraced him tightly, giving some last hard thrusts that rose Sherlock's body and finally collapsed on the sand, panting heavily. Sherlock lay boneless on top of him, still moaning softly, both enjoying the last orgasmic shivers.
"I had to get it back", mused the detective, sitting up in the bed, wincing in pain.
"Does it feel ok?" asked Sherlock.
“He has a border collie!”
"ohmmmmmmy gooooooodddddddddddddd" Sherlock arched his body when the dildo started vibrating against his prostate "fucckkkk, stopmmmmmmm gooddddddddd" he jerked wildly, as the others licked and sucked his cock and nipples. The detective actually screamed in pleasure agony, as Donovan slowly fucked him, keeping the dildo inside a bit to vibrate against his prostate before taking it out and shoving it inside again, as Sherlock breathed out a long, high-pitched moan, bucking his hips a little harder, Donovan again rubbing his prostate with the vibrating dildo.
"What did you say?" he hissed, threatening.
John thought of Sherlock and Rosie.
“William was very pale in skin so, during the day he did not leave the barracks other than the essential. At night, however, he used to walk around the base and the surroundings, to the despair of the sentinels and those blokes who had to protect him. He misled them with an astonishing easiness and reappeared as if he had been walking through Central park. His bodyguards went mad, shouted at him, trying to make him see it wasn’t sure for him to go out by himself, but he didn’t mind. I think he found it funny, like a game of cat and mouse. And he really was good at it.
Sherlock lay down, letting his head rest on John's legs. The doctor chuckled and stroked his hair gently. Both with a bittersweet feeling, happy that their daughter was well and quiet, but feeling bad about lying.
“Errr, sir?”
"But Rosie..." John started, and he melted at the sight of his four-year-old daughter, pouting. He looked at Sherlock, but the sulky detective didn't intend to support him in the least, so he did the only thing he could - give in to his sulky fiancé and his pouting daughter.
John told him Sherlock was suspicious of the mission. Still, the two of them, looking at the reports, the photographs, and the rest of the documentation, decided that the detective had a colossal jealousy fit. Even Mycroft asked for confirmation of the information, and a second raid offered the same data.
"They found the graves."
Before his brain came entirely out of the dream, he noticed the hand approaching his head, and in an automatic movement of a well-trained soldier, he held it in the air with his left hand and, in a quick motion, twist the arm of the attacker on his back.
"But, what if it wasn't?"
Rosie looked at his Papa. It was a lie on the size of the Tower Bridge. Sherlock never misunderstood John. Moreover, Sherlock never misunderstood anyone. But her Papa was the smartest man of the world (more even than uncle Myc, but as he made a lot of fuss when Rosie told him that, she would never repeat it in front of his uncle), so the little girl decided to carry on with Sherlock’s game.
“It was not that…”
John pressed the panic button and untied himself. He sat and, without taking his cock out of Sherlock, hugged him, as both laid down slowly again, Sherlock shaking in his arms. He put his mouth to the detective's ear, who groaned as he felt his breath warm.
“And where did you were transfer?”
Slowly, John circled Sherlock's entrance with one finger, easing it until the detective relaxed at the touch. Then he started pushing in slightly, gently relaxing the muscle. The detective arched his back and moaned as Greg watched in fascination how John slowly thrust his finger in and out of the brunette, the doctor groaning at the sensation as his already hard cock grew impossibly harder.
The only thing that calmed the infuriated Sherlock a bit was the promise that Sholto and Mark would go up the hill to look. If he had followed instructions correctly, they were close to where John and the others were kept prisoners.
The landlady patted John's arm affectionately.
“Of course,” mumbled the man, his voice trembling a bit. “I’ll tell you exactly what when we see them.”
"We will be home before you know it," promised Sherlock.
Sometimes it was late afternoon, others lunchtime or early morning. Sometimes it was just a couple of minutes, and sometimes they had time to talk some more. It became a way of trying to normalize such an anomalous situation, supporting each other and avoiding anybody feeling lonely. They were joined from time to time by Mrs. Turner, or by Mrs. Hudson's sister, and even Anthea appeared from time to time without letting go of her precious mobile, thought Mycroft insisted that she rest for a while. Sometimes John's hospital companions also joined if they were lucky enough to have a quick rest.
Everett nodded. He looked intently at Strange and opened his mouth to say something, but closed it. Anyway, it was too late. It wasn't worth talking about yet. John and Ross nodded sadly and looked at each other.
"Down to the smallest detail."
Irene closed the door and returned to the room, where Rosie was reading, sat on one of the armchairs, her legs bent over her body, the book leaning on them. The Woman smiled. Even if she was not his daughter, she had an undeniable resemblance to Sherlock, mixed with John's stubbornness and determination.
"I told you. I don't care. Maybe I should have died two years ago".
The doctor pushed inside, and Sherlock got two fingers inside him. John growled, feeling Sherlock's warm and tight entrance, anticipating the moment he will shove his cock inside it.
“It's not your fault”.
“Of course not. Trust me. But you haven’t answered my question. How my books saved your life?”
Thank you a lot for your readings, subscriptions comments, feedback and encouragement!!!
Anthea, Donovan, Molly, Mrs Hudson and Craig looked at each other, puzzled, when the men stopped shooting, retreated, got into their cars and drove off at full speed.
Lestrade offered her the coffee they bought a few minutes earlier in one of the coffee shops in the square, with chocolate and heavy-creamed. The woman picked it up enthusiastically and drank it slowly, shovelling it, as if she were alone.
“Did you resign?”
"What?"
"I am always prepared for anything."
The Major ignored the phone that vibrated in his pocket four times. On the fifth, exasperated, he picked it up.
Several walking dead managed to straddle the gunfire and approached John, Donovan, and Lestrade. They repeatedly shot at them and were so concentrated in that group that wasn't aware of a zombie that walking by the ceiling, dropped himself on Lestrade, making him fall to the floor, the zombie sat on him.
Sherlock leaned forward, resting his forehead on the ground, indifferent to the cold, the loneliness, and the night, just aware that the love of his life had chosen someone else to share his life with.
"Sherlock, love, open your eyes. You are scaring me".
"Yes, he should have been watching the camp," answered Pete.
But DI knew their relationship could not prosper if Mycroft did not let out everything about Anthony; neither if he did not do the same with the whirlwind of feelings that such revelation provoked in him. He didn't want the ghost of Mycroft's dead boyfriend flying over them. He had seen it end badly too many times.
That morning, they went to the place where they bought the snacks to spend the day. They usually went later, almost at two o'clock, but that day Donovan was in a dog's mood (more than usual), and Lestrade decided to go and eat something to see if a little sugar would sweeten the sergeant's character a bit.
"Very, very, very caloric," repeated Bill and looked up at the roof of, which would be about four meters above them. He twisted the gesture, looking at the rest of his companions. He pressed his lips "Impossible. None of us would make it".
"You want to choke on my cock?" John teased, and Sherlock nodded eagerly.
"And it's easy to guess that there's something underneath. See the undulations of the ground around the building?" observed Rob.
"Daddy, who's going to be your bridesmaids?"
John tilted his head, watching him. In a way, he could see in him the child that the cook and the butler were describing. His face seemed younger than usual, abandoning the gesture of concentration that always accompanied him. Sherlock was relaxed.
"I'm sorry for what I said, Myc," the detective's words took him by surprise, and even more so that he used the diminutive with which he called him when they were children "When we found the graves, I shouldn't have said that."
The DI pulled his boyfriend, and both of them, followed by the officers, went out on the street.
Greg waited for a few moments until he realized Sherlock had no intention of continuing to talk.
“But he is a freak, a psychopath.”
Everett closed his eyes, summoning up the courage to say what he had been silent about for so long. If he didn't do it now, he would never do it. He worried his lower lip, thoughtful and closed his eyes. He took a deep breath and mental run, just like an athlete would do before the long jump. The difference, his was a leap into the void, a fall into an abyss from which only Stephen could save him.
John moaned and grunted, his eyes closed, losing himself in the warmness and tightness of Sherlock arse, gently stretching his cock.
She raised an eyebrow to the DI.
"John…I don't want… nohhhhhhh" Sherlock moaned as the doctor liked his ear and kept on nibbling and sucking his neck. His hands unbuttoned his shirt, exposing his chest. The doctor passed his arms under the detective armpits, rubbing them across his arms until his wrists and grabbed them, taking his jacket and his shirt off to finally move Sherlock's arms behind his back.
"Don't lose your hat, cowboy, you've got a wild horse to ride tonight," whispered John naughtily, slapping the detective's arse, who shouted, "yiiiiihaaaa" and trotted back into the living room to help Rosie remove the tea set.
The food was more bearable than Sherlock initially thought. For Rosie, he avoided being sullen and distant, enjoying John and his daughter chatting and laughing with the others. As Sherlock had predicted, Rosie already splashed out little phrases in Spanish, talking to her new friends, with whom she went to play after lunch.
Dimmock lowered his head.
"Yes, pet?"
Sherlock gave up and put his head down. They kissed embraced. When John broke the kiss, he had trouble getting out of the detective's embrace.
"Mr. Holmes is not in his office," repeated the receptionist with an icy smile, "and neither is his assistant. I'm sorry, I can't let you in."
"Behind Blackbushe Airport, there is a privately owned estate. Across the wire, about ten miles down a country road, there is a small hangar.
"Can I? Please, please!!!!!" she begged, jumping and running, delighted that the animals followed her wherever she went, barking excitedly.
"Luke Sheridan" read aloud.
He could go back to his office, lock the door, pull down the blinds and listen to how John punished Sherlock.
"Really? When he was like me?"
He opened his legs as much as he could in the tube, placed a towel behind his neck, and started stroking himself again, slow and softly, his hand barely caressing his cock, sending teasing sensation to his brain, his lips parted, his tongue licking his lower lip.
"Don't you dare tell Mycroft, John or anyone else about what I said" Sherlock hesitated a bit "Please, Greg".
Then, at the end of the aisle appeared Sherlock and Rosie, Sherlock grabbing Rosie's hand, the girl elated with joy, the detective visibly nervous.
“John, please, please … fuck me!
"Sherlock, Sherlock, love" John stroked his bruised cheek "we have to get out of here," he urged.
Mycroft closed his eyes. In other circumstances, others' rejection wouldn't have bothered him in the least. But it hurt him to know everyone thought he was guilty of John's disappearance and Sherlock's departure. As if he didn't know enough of it himself. Mycroft wasn't used to being wrong. And the mistake had been so massive and its consequences so disastrous he had not yet been able to assimilate it, causing him to be sensitive to others' comments and accusations. Now it turned out that he too had a heart.
He looked sideways at Everett when he felt his gaze on him, lowered his head, and cleared his throat a couple of times, trying to pick up the thread.
Sherlock shook his head.
"Dig," he ordered.
The men spoke angrily to each other. John hadn't spoken Farsi for a long time, but he understood something about them running out of time, running out of time for what?
He put his fingers in his temples, closing his eyes, breathing deeply, trying to think.
"You have to introduce me to him. He seems a good match," laughed Bill.
"I know, dear, but I don't mind."
“Of course, after having a bit of fun with him. The same is going to happen to you”.
"I'm not wearing a liner," joked Mark making the rest laughed, excited with the plans.
******
"But then you entered in Sherlock's life and I…, that black thing in my chest slowly started melting… and Sherlock…".
"Will you be safe here alone with Mycroft?" he mocked.
"You are still in danger."
A VIP hostess left the building and waited at the foot of the van. She smiled as Lestrade stepped out of it, slightly embarrassed by the onlooker's large crowd the display was gathering around them. A second later, a stiff, haughty, and completely calm Mycroft got out of the van.
“He didn’t…” started the detective and winced in pain.
Strange smiled smugly, and Tony rolled his eyes, while Natasha and Steve chuckled, shaking their heads.
"Yoooohoooo boys, time to goooo, the car is here," Mrs. Hudson crooned.
"Brat."
The parents, hearing him chuckling and realizing their sons and daughters were wearing only their pajamas and jackets despite the cold, started demanding explanations at Sherlock, who remained undaunted before the parent’s anger.
John nodded.
“Call us whenever you want to come back,” she said, her eyes full of tears. Sherlock hugged her back and quickly dislodged the embrace. She chuckled and turned to Rosie, who tightly hugged her.
Mycroft drowned out a sob and ran to them, followed by Lestrade, Sholto, the SAS members, and the homeless.
John panted, wishing to have the whole London's shortcuts map in his head as Sherlock did, as he ran across the big avenue arriving at Scotland Yard. He put the gun in the backpack, greeted the officer at the door, ran towards the elevator, and then burst open Lestrade's office door.
John moved his hand over the detective's head, grabbed him firmly, and groaned while he fucked Sherlock's mouth deep and fast. When the detective felt the doctor's cock throbbing and tightening in his mouth, he rubbed more firmly his perineum, massaging his prostate from outside, caressing his balls at the same time.
“What happened, John? Did Sherlock do something wrong? She asked, alarmed.
Some of them even dared to get up and walk behind him, trying an approach, oblivious to a John who felt an atavistic desire to growl underneath and show his fangs, making it clear that he was the only who fucked the detective.
“On the third day, I was driving a jeep and William was sat next to me. Suddenly, several snipers started shooting the convoy. William pounced on me, to serve me as a human-shield. Thanks to him, I only got shot in the shoulder.“ John gulped. “He wasn’t so lucky. He got shot in the abdomen and the chest. Our comrades dragged us out of the vehicle and left us in the gutter.“ He stared vacantly at some point on the wall. ”I couldn’t do anything for him. I, who had saved hundreds of soldiers life’s, couldn’t save my loved one.“ With every word, he hit his temples with his fists. ”I only was able to hold him in my arms until he died.”
“Could you enlighten us with your wisdom, Ms. Hunter?” asked Mycroft, coldly.
"It's going to be great," replied John, surprised when the woman embraced him with the same effusiveness and planted a kiss on each cheek.
John at home and Lestrade in the shop laughed at the detective, who swelled with pride at his daughter's compliment.
When she arrived at his apartment, she poured herself a glass of wine, contemplating the city lights. If New York was the city that never sleeps, London was not lagging. The wine helped her to relax and forget about the strange kiosk. She got into bed and picked up a book to read for a while before sleep. Tomorrow she would have to deal with the freak, but for now, she could calmly read his novel without any alleged genius telling her who the murderer was by just glancing at the cover.
John grabbed the detective by his sides, inviting him to turn around. John caressed Sherlock’s inner tights, as the detective moaned again, the doctor hands traveling from his knees to the point where the legs met the hips, avoiding to touch the detective’s cock that throbbed inside his pants, aching for attention.
And then, Sherlock did what he was dying to do since the very first moment he met John at the lab, what he should have done at Angelo's if he hadn't been so scared for falling in love at first sight with the doctor.
John smiled fondly, looking at their four-year-old daughter. He could not help but feel a twinge of emotion when he saw her dressed as a surgeon, as he had done so many times before being shot in Afghanistan. Not that he mainly wanted Rosie to follow in his footsteps, but he couldn't help but get his hopes up.
The veterans, Sholto, Mycroft, and Lestrade began to fire, the bodies of the mercenaries falling disorderly from the trucks and or beside them between cries. At the same time, the SAS ran through the dune and near the vehicles, parapetted in the undulations of the sand, firing, to prevent any of the mercenaries from escaping.
Too late. When Steve brushed against his girlfriend's, the ghostly hand transformed into a rope that wrapped around his arm. With a firm tug, she pulled Captain America from the shield, throwing him against the other ghosts of his past, who rushed at him like piranhas, while the orange ball vanished, leaving them at the mercy of the spirits.
"Cut that asshole off," growled Tony to Friday, and the screen turned black.
"What about us?"
"Doctor Watson…"
““I understand that looking for a file that Sherlock requested.” recited Greg.
Mycroft's words conveyed no emotion, nor did his face, at least, no more than an imperceptible tremor in his left eyelid.
The detective hawked again.
Sherlock felt as his brain was one of those old outboard engines, that no matter how hard you tried to choke it, they only cracked several times, but never got to start, so drowned his mind was in the orgasmic fogs. He turned back his head, looking back at John’s cock, red, swollen, and near to explode. Trembling, he raised one leg and, pivoting on one arm, freed himself for a second from the doctor’s lips and motioned to positioned himself, so his face was on John’s cock. Quickly John trapped the detective’s cock again and swallowed it.
“And you could learn something from him.“ added Sally “ you have been working with him during ten years and you are as moron as you were the first day.”
He climbed the stairs to the door flat and remembered himself to put on a surprised face when he found everyone there.
They heard suppressed chuckles and “eeewwws” behind them, and then Rosie saying: “You see? I told you. Kissing all day long”.
"Yes, yes, yes, yes," cried the little four-year-old Rosie.
"Go to hell," Mycroft chuckled. He got serious. "You really wouldn't have let him?"
"Jooooooooooohn, no!" shouted Sherlock, running after the doctor, straight to the portal. Ironman pushed him, slamming the detective against the wall. Grunting in pain, he rose again, but Ironman flew at him, pinning him down.
"But John was talking to you," replied Lestrade.
The only thing he kept from that time was the wedding ring he and Anthony bought together during their wedding preparations, a few days before his fiancé's death, the only memory of a time he was truly happy. To the few people who dared to ask him, he said it was a family inheritance, ending the subject.
It seemed the older Holmes hesitated between blowing up or sending the landlady to hell. But this woman commanded him a respect that he could not explain. Not to mention Sherlock's affection for Mrs. Hudson, which made her untouchable, as she well knew. So the woman squared her shoulders and held his gaze without blinking.
"Because if I hadn't, I would have gone crazy. They were watching me all the time. So I could only trust their word," he rubbed his eyes, exhausted.
Stephen looked at Sherlock, who shrugged.
John approached the stairs as he put his foot on the first step, a small light came on the next one. The steps were small and uneven, carved directly into the rock on the hillside, and moved left and right to avoid the pines. He got barefoot when he stepped on the sand, white and shiny under the moonlight, just like Sherlock's who, sitting on the shore, barefoot and dressed only in shorts, let the water lick his feet. A few meters to his right, under a small awning, a wicker basket that he most certainly had not carried with a bottle of wine and two cups.
“Twice a week? Copycats? “ she started to feel sick.
The others tensed at the arrival of a cab at the door of the warehouse. Lestrade look at the two figures that got out of the vehicle, trying to see something different in them.
“Where is my drink?”
Sherlock wasn't worried about John.
Sherlock took a step forward, but when John turned to him, threateningly wriggling his fingers in the air, he stopped short.
"Time is running out!" threatened the mercenaries' chief.
"Your wallet?" asked the puzzled DI.
John was aware that Sherlock knew there was something else behind that game, but the doctor did not want to give in to the detective's impatient nature.
"In command, Captain. But for the record, if... when we get back, I'll kill your brother-in-law."
Sherlock pressed his lips together and, without responding, sprayed the wound on his cheekbone with a small anesthetic spray that took from the case. Mycroft clenched his teeth, holding a hiss.
"We tricked the only consulting detective in the world!" shouted Rosie, clapping excitedly and high-fiving John.
“It’s ok.“ Muttered John.
“I hope is nothing serious.”
Both laughed. John kissed the detective's neck. Sherlock turned to kiss his lips.
"And I guess that is not good, for a change," grunted Tony.
"With the ghoul, there is only one downside," explained Moriarty as if he were giving a lecture. "As my beloved detective has graciously pointed out, they don't like alive people. For me, it's not a problem, but the smell of fresh meat, the blood's heat of the living beings… they hate it and make them go berserk. And the way they kill, it seems inhuman even to myself. A slow, painful, and agonic death." He sighed, pretending to be grieved. "But after they eat you alive, a new era will start. An era without an annoying consulting detective and his pet".
The detective didn't respond. He looked at the graves as if hypnotized. He knew he had to get close, to examine them, but he couldn't.
"Mike's rescue operation was... clandestine, in some way. Only a few of us knew about it. If my name comes up connected with the request for a hypersonic aircraft, mobilizing troops near it..."
"Ready?" Bruce asked.
Sherlock inhaled deeply, and closed his eyes, trying to withdraw to his Mind Palace, to block the pain, as he did when he was tortured in Serbia. But everything that happened since John's disappearance, plus the memories that Clay's back stirred up, left him emotionally exhausted, and he couldn't manage to slip inside.
"One last question," said Sherlock.
Sherlock closed his eyes, fighting the tears, fighting the fear.
"What's the matter?"
"Tell me, Greg."
"You say you always miss something. So do I. When I planned all this, I missed one thing: John would protect you at any cost, even in exchange for his life. I tried to convince him to take you, but he refused outright... and that tore everything apart. I missed how much he loves you".
"As even you could guess," retorted Mycroft, "bringing her here would be dangerous for all of us. We made it so today will be as special as possible for her. Anyway, next time you speak about my sister in those terms, Sargent Donovan, I will arrange it so she will pay you a visit. You are warned,".
Bruce set up the GPS space-time coordinates.
"Flatterer. I don't expect any compliments from Sherlock, mostly because God knows where his head is at the moment".
"Mycroft, being as smart as you boast, you should know it by now."
"Do you trust her?"
Sherlock shook his head. He had only recently learned to swim, but he still didn't feel completely safe and didn't want to move beyond where his feet were still touching the bottom. He decided to join Rosie when John started teaching her to swim. John agreed and taught them both, the girl with the innate confidence of children in the water, the detective almost having a heart attack when his daughter broke loose from the pool edge and went into the water. With patience (tons, kilotons to deal with a soaked, grumpy, nervous, and insecure detective totally out of his element), he managed to get them both to end up swimming freely.
" Oh, god, I..I… OH, JOHN!"
Mycroft hesitated. If he left Sherlock there, he would indeed be killed soon. But he knew his brother. If he didn't want to go with him, he wouldn't do it. He gestured to sit at his side.
"I have this for you."
The pilot went down the stairs and came to greet him, while the purser instructed the waiters to put away their luggage. They boarded the plane and sat in the comfortable leather seats, waiting for it to take off.
"We're doing experiments."
The detective went mad with worry. If the rift between the two brothers when Mycroft asked John to return to Afghanistan had been epic, the one they had when the doctor disappeared was apocalyptic.
"... It's time for you to wear a real suit".
"I have nothing to say to you, Mycroft."
"Guilty," chuckled Sherlock. They humbled face-to-face, their noses rubbing together, feeling each other's body heat but without touching.
"Why...?" he asked, opening his eyes.
The man ran his hand through his hair. A glow that Donovan could not decipher crossed his gaze. He sank his shoulders.
"Give him his due, nothing else."
“Moriarty”
His brother nodded, took Sherlock's hand, and the detective lifted him effortlessly. He brought his hand to his cheekbone.
"Sherlock!" called Mycroft, trying to stop him, but his brother easily got rid of him, smashing another chair against the wall.
They both chuckled. Sherlock sighed again.
Everett turned to Thor.
"Really?" asked Patrick.
Mike nodded.
Lestrade was about to pick up the phone to lecture the transmitters when he froze.
Stark's shot went through them without doing any damage. They only dissipated for a few seconds to form again. Steve threw his shield, which pierced the figures' waists, blurring them and then reappearing, as the sound of the shield crashing uncontrollably against the walls of the cave reached them.
Sherlock closed his eyes and bit his lower lip.
“Go to your desk and…”
"I feel like I'm not myself, like a part of me has been left... crouched or scared in a corner, and I'm not able to connect with it. I don't know how to explain it."
" he read aloud and chuckled. ”This Holmes is amazingly brilliant.”
Minimum of eight hours of sleep? The detective watched him like a hawk, and if he came out of the bedroom fifteen minutes before the established eight hours, he forced him to go back to bed until he rested for the necessary time, ignoring the patient's protests.
Sherlock made a sound between a growl in frustration mixed with a groan of pleasure and was forced to let go John’s cock to arch his back, as John crossed his legs on Sherlock’s back, forcing him to lie on his body as he kept on fucking the detective with now two fingers, still sucking the detective’s cock, enjoying the desperate sounds coming from Sherlock’s mouth, when the detective grabbed John’s cock and started stroking it hard and fast, his fist firmly gripped around it, his tongue moving on the head of his cock as if he was licking and ice cream.
"I hear that!" John retorted in the dark, making them giggle.
John looked at him hesitantly. He could not deny he wanted to get on it, but Sherlock's falling tied to the structure could be dangerous even if he was not too high off the ground. On the other hand, even with his brain overloaded with the need to be fucked, Sherlock was Sherlock, and if the detective assured it would hold out, it would.
"I can… wait," gasped the detective, although it was evident for John he couldn't.
"He's been like this since I brought him breakfast an hour ago. He hasn't said anything; he hasn't moved... I didn't want to call John so he wouldn't worry".
There was a little silence.
After them, Roy, Patrick, Daniel, and Andrew, stiffer than a stick, were also gawking at the interest they raised in people; they were used to being invisible to Londoners when lying, sleeping, eating, or walking through the streets of the city.
"He's not going to find his brother," she said to Lestrade, nodding to Mycroft.
"I'll make you beg me to go faster so aloud that Lestrade will send here a squad car."
Everett felt the SIG barrel sticking to the back of his skull and heard Holmes pull the gun's safety."
Anthea's tone got deeper.
“He was protecting your children, bunch of idiots,” cried the shepherd in a hoarse voice. The parents shut up, looked at each other, puzzled.
"Well, certainly, it is different, you can't deny it."
"Son, you are on my turf now. If we storm London, you'll give the orders. Until then, behind me. We're soldiers, and you're a civilian."
“But the sound comes from it” Greg muttered, checking the pockets again. Then he realized there was a hole in one of the pocket’s lining. He run his hand over the bottom of the coat and got a black tiny device, similar to a “beeper”. On the little screen, he could read a message.
John moaned and was about to order Sherlock to release him when he saw Sherlock's lubed finger start circling his own clenching hole, as he bent to lick John's balls, letting his tongue ran up and down on the doctor's shaft. From the position, John had a perfect view of Sherlock's fingering himself, gently pushing one of his long fingers inside his hole.
“How did you manage to organize all of it so quickly?”
"Anthea?" he said. She and John were on an open line, so they could both hear them.
"I hate you both, I hate you, I hate you Joonnnnnnnnnnn, fuck!"
"I knew it."
The chairs started to give in. Knowing time was running out, Sherlock threw a Muay Thai uppercut elbow to Moran’s chin, which made him fall to the ground. The detective straddled on him and punched Moran’s face repeatedly, charging every blow with all the rage and the pain Sebastian inflicted him, his eyes filled with tears that blurred his vision. He kept on hitting Moran even when the man finally lost consciousness, his head bouncing uncontrollably due to the strength of the hits.
"Throw the phone away," someone snarled at his back.
"Ohhhhhhhhh, you bastards, I can't, fucking shit, nggggggggggg you are killing me, faster, fuck, oh, god, faster, deeper" moaned Sherlock, bumbling something about skinning John and Greg alive.
"This will be the first place where they'll look for me."
"Time to go back home," Mycroft announced, "or instead of a wedding, tomorrow, you will celebrate a nap."
In this chapter, there are some references to the last episode "The Final Problem" but adapted to this fic, in which Sherlock and John get together after what happened in Culverton Smith's morgue (there is a kiss instead of a hug).
Mycroft closed his eyes, remembering his colleagues and subordinates who, at that time, suffered "accidents" similar to his, but with much more severe consequences, or were accused of carrying out non-authorised operations. They were investigated, but no one ever found the culprit. And those who claimed it was Clay who organised them, had no way of proving it.
"Greg, where the hell have you been?"
Oblivious to their parents' tribulations, Rosie let out an excited shriek when Sherlock, in his run, took her in his arms and got into the water, splashing with great strides, the girl laughing out loud as the detective jumped the waves, she holding on to his neck, both jumping every time a wave approached them that Rosie anticipated screaming "wave, wave, wave!!” as, John dove into the sea behind them.
"Lucky for me," John whispered happily, feeling his heart explode for his mad genius while pecking the detective's nose. "Are you okay?"
"Sherlock, get out of the way," hissed the doctor, behind whom the other four soldiers gathered.
"No, what you are seeing is a model based on the hypothesis that both matter and antimatter remain constant. That's why it remains in time, but in the universe..."
It had been a hard blow for all of them to get back to the idea that Mike was not alive, that he was still the only one who had not survived the ambush that the snipers laid on them in Afghanistan.
The detective frowned in surprise and swallowed, reaching out to grab it.
"A month or so passed, with no news of them. Then they told me I had to get you away from London and sent me Mike's file."
"And why didn't you tell him this before?"
"Sherlock, what are you saying?" John asked, distressed.
"Don't get jealous," giggled John, kissing his lips, and Sherlock smiled in the same way as Rosie.
He stopped, panting with lust.
"John, and... the other John, put your guns down!" repeated the DI.
"As Anthea said, she only needs time. And the fact that she's here instead of at Baker Street also takes her off balance a bit" Mrs. Hudson said, patting Sherlock's hand reassuringly. "You and John should keep what you're doing: reassure her, listen to her, and answer her questions. That is the best for her now".
"Papa!" the detective was grateful to be using headsets. Otherwise, Rosie's scream would have rung out across the plain.
The pathologist paled, scared. The idea that they could have broken into before getting Rose to safety made her shiver with fear. Donovan looked in the rearview mirror, blinded by the glare of the headlights of the vehicle following them.
The sleuth waited till one the men entered into the tent nearest to him, which was out of sight from the shed, and, jumping on it, he trapped the man inside the fabric. The man cursed, kicked and fought, but before he could free himself, Sherlock quickly removed the tent fixings and wrapped the cloth around the man’s body. Finally, he knelt on the man and used the tent ropes to fix the pack firmly. The man kept kicked frantically, but the fabric muffled his shouts. Sherlock dragged the lump out of the camp and, searching for a stone, knocked down the other man, in the same way, the first four, and hauling the body next to the first one; he tied him up with the rest of the tent ropes.
Lestrade put the belt on him, did the same in his, and nodded. The driver started up and sped off to the point marked by the GPS.
Mycroft cursed to himself as the car drove him to the military airfield from which they were leaving. He was... no, not scared. Mycroft Holmes was never scared or, if he was, he didn't recognize it. It wasn't fear, just restlessness and worry, he said to himself. He shook his head. As much as he tried to lie to himself, this time he was really freaked out. If caring was never an advantage, now less than ever.
"Quantum suits. We can't travel through time as he can," he pointed at Stephen." And, to travel through it, we need the Quantum Suits." Steve, Bruce, Stephen, Natasha, and Sherlock followed him. The billionaire was already on his way to where they kept Quantum Suits and the stocks of Pym Particles that Henry Pym produced.
"It's me."
“Papa! Daddy!” shouted the girl at the top of her lungs, making the woman jump. “We are going to be late! My friends are waiting!”.
"Three chocolates?"
"Oh, yessssssssssssss mmmmmm, I can't, ohhhhhhhhh god, I'm gonna….fuck" moaned the detective, feeling his orgasm approaching.
"We could make it out of chocolate. I'll let you lick the spoon."
"Nobody noticed? Nobody saw it coming? I mean, Eurus."
“I want to go home” protested the detective.
"I was thinking, as the basement will be empty, would you like we turn it into a playroom?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter put his hands up.
The girl smiled and stopped tickling him
John giggled.
Sherlock gaped. They were in a spacious wooden cottage, the fire from the large fireplace lit, providing a gentle warmth to the room. The lights were off, the place only illuminated, besides the fire, by hundreds of candles set on the walls' projections, which gave the room an intimate, cozy, and romantic touch.
Right at that moment, Tony, Steve, Sherlock, and Natasha materialized next to him.
John should have hit Sherlock’s prostate because the detective moaned so loud that Lestrade was afraid it could be heard out of his office. The DI knew he had to cut the eavesdropping, that they were illegally invading John and Sherlock’s privacy, but hearing them making love had something hypnotic, addictive, not only for him but for everyone in the room. Lestrade could feel his cock hardening, and, looking at the other men, the sexual game had the same effect on them.
"Press it as soon as you need it."
"I'll explain to you later, but don't. piss. him. off, for God's sake."
“I left my phone at the camp.”
"I... I'm not much for tea, but yes! What the hell! You drink tea for the whole day!"
The waiters with the luggage trolleys followed them. Then Mark, Pete, and Rob, entirely in their roles, distilled professionalism, walking upright, serious, and paused. Mycroft and Lestrade, the former standing upright and not paying the slightest attention to what was going on around him. The latter, almost dizzy by Mycroft's words and a little embarrassed by the commotion they caused, also stood upright and trying to maintain the most distinguished posture possible.
"And on top of that, modest. Charming," Tony grumbled. Natasha snorted, and Steve mouthed "jealous."
Anthea reappeared at the door. Donovan wondered if the woman would be really able to take her eyes from her smartphone.
They looked at him, gaping first and then smiling faintly. That would signify that everything they went through would not have been in vain. John shook his head, doubtfully.
And then, the box inside his Mind Palace exploded and the Hell overflowed Sherlock, who hid his face between his hands and started sobbing heavily. John embraced him, holding him tight, caressing his hair, muttering tender words, making Sherlock feeling safe and loved between his arms, helping the detective to, finally, start healing his wounds.
"Shouldn't he be watching the camp?" Jake asked mockingly.
"Do you want to come?" purred Lestrade.
The anguish vanished from Sherlock's heart, tempered by John's defense of him. His determined gesture, his tight lips, his slightly bowed head, and that sort of smile which announced he wouldn't mind turning the place into hell in a second.
"I hope so, for his daughter."
"Sherlock!" berated John, as the rest gasped, scared.
He showed it to Sherlock. Mike took photographs since the first day in the camp and the last one displayed the children with the fallow deer.
"Ahhhhhhhhhh" moaned Sherlock, finally able to do it freely "Jooohn, yesss, please, I need…. Ngggggg oh my God, touch me," the detective bubbled incongruently, straining the ropes, trying desperately to free his hands, trashing his head from side to side.
"You will explain to me later who your brother met, young man. For now, John, don't worry. I'll talk to Mycroft".
Clay smiled mockingly.
John felt his lungs burning. His muscles spasmed from lack of oxygen. Blood, pooled in his head, was throbbing in his temples. His vision became blurry, and his head stopped thinking clearly. God, he needed to open his mouth and breathe in forcefully. But if he did, his lungs would fill with water.
Sherlock blushed, even more, his cheeks and neck burning with a deep blush, that increased while hearing Donovan and Anderson's giggles.
Just as he said it, the sound of machine guns shooting was followed by the cries of fired officers. John, Sherlock, Greg, Molly, Donovan, Anderson, and the remaining officers looked at the window, astonished.
"I don't know, Greg. I haven't the patience to listen to him. I don't want to hear any of his absurd excuses, his stupid reasoning or impossible deductions. I'm sick of this. You were right. You and everyone else. How could I have been such an idiot?"
"And fill it with soldiers," Sholto added, "your brother put John in a hornet's nest."
Ross lowered his head. The ghosts of his past surrounded him without attacking him, almost expectantly, whispering.
"John Clay, you are under arrest for the murder of Anthony Craig, the attempted murder of Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes, embezzlement, malfeasance, theft, extortion and all those other charges you made Mycroft sign" he pushed him towards one of the officers, who just arrived at the warehouse "take that scum away".
John shook his head amidst the other's drowned laughter.
John smiled mockingly, took his phone and opened the app to order a taxi.
"Bartholomew!" cried Geena, startling them. "Can you set the table?"
The doctor also bogged down in a cloud of sexual pleasure bliss, not only for the fucking but for having Sherlock's at his mercy, for being able to melt the detective into the pleasure, to dominate him, to make him squirm, and beg, and lose his mind, to turn the genius into a bubbling and wanton creature unable to think or speak coherently.
"We will work on that hypothesis for now," he pulled out his phone and dialed "Mycroft?" he asked, unsure. With Sherlock's brother, you never knew. One minute he was affable, and the next, he was looking at you like a hideous bug. "I need to see you" he closed his eyes and blushed. Why had he said that?
“Lestrade” Sherlock looked around, assuring the rest couldn’t hear him “Regarding the arrested… and the interrogations, I wouldn’t like anyone to know…, I mean…”
"We don't have any bridesmaids, sweetheart. We have best men."
"Like my Papa".
They exchanged a desperate look.
“John, if your goal was discouraging me for flirting with the rookies, this wasn’t a good choice of method,” Sherlock gasped, mockingly.
Only one thought reassured him: Sherlock and Rosie were safe, hundreds of miles away.
Sherlock pressed the button. John's rule. Whenever they were in a new place, they had to try it out. The bounds came loose, releasing him, and immediately he heard a noise upstairs. Instead of coming down the stairs, John slid down a fire pole connected with the upper floor.
“We have a press conference in ten minutes. Tell me you have something, anything,
Sebastian released his hair, his face a mix of proud and rage.
"That's why. You have seen, as I have, two Sherlocks. Why not a third?"
When he came out of the bedroom, Lestrade whistled at him with admiration.
"Michael".
"For me, it is."
"Stop fussing, John," ordered Sherlock.
"Yes, you. I'll take a shower." John got off the deckchair, his legs still wobbling a bit, "Whatever happens, you can't stop cooking, got it?"
A VIP passenger van was waiting for them outside. The driver got out and loaded the heavy bags while they got in. He set off and took the road to Bern airport.
“Oh, my God, John, nnnnnnngggggg don’t stop, don’t stop, ohhhhhhh God…..”
Watson smiled, smug and mocked at the same time.
"Let's go back to camp. We have to move fast," the detective ordered.
Sherlock read in the teenager's eyes the suffering when he lost his parents, the years of crying for them, the loneliness, the rejection by others, the feeling of being different – and adolescence so similar to his own. He also read the admiration and devotion to Tony, the pride of belonging to the Avengers, of feeling that he had finally found his place.
Before John could continue reading, they heard Sherlock’s recited by memory the following paragraph. He had leaned on the door frame, watching the scene without being noticed since John started reading. His voice was firm, although a little shakier with emotion than the detective would like to admit.
Sherlock made a gesture with his head towards the ceiling from where the swing held and saw the roof carabiner slowly giving way.
"So he didn't go back to Baker Street. Where is he now?" he asked another agent besides him.
John’s lips left Sherlock’s and travelled down to his neck, kissing it down towards his collarbone, making Sherlock shiver. Softly, he went down the other man's chest, kissing and licking every bruise he found in his path, as to make them disappear. He reached Sherlock left nipple and circle it with the tongue, his lips encircling it, sucking the pinkish skin, as he rubs the other nipple with the palm of his hand and pinched it with his thumb and index fingers, the detective arching his back below him, his hands grabbing the doctor's biceps, moaning loudly.
He sighed, defeated, left the book, and nodded, walking behind them. A couple of steps later, he returned to the sunshade and put on his T-shirt to hide his scarred back. Not that Sherlock cared that people found it more or less disgusting. He didn't care at all, but he preferred to avoid comments, gestures, or questions in front of Rosie.
"Mrs. Hudson will have a heart attack if you take them all to the flat," replied Sherlock.
Moran was right. They were in Alcatraz Island, in San Francisco Bay, formerly a federal prison, currently a National Park. Some prison officers were waiting for them. None of them paid attention to Moran’s bleeding face, to his broken nose or his limp. They surrounded him and obliged Moran to walk towards the fortress followed by Mycroft and John, ignoring the man’s protest and ranting.
"You!" John cried in his best Captain's voice, addressing a group of officers, "Go to the armory and bring here all the arms and ammunition you can find. Move!"
"I said, get back to bed!" he repeated, "the last you need is to reopen the wound! But what the hell is wrong with you?!!"
Molly composed an apologetic gesture.
Mycroft punched Sherlock in the upper arm as the rest of the group roared with laugh.
“The Chief Superintendent,” Anderson announced, rearing his head in the office. He gestured toward the phone.
“Daddy! I guided Papa to us!” cried Rosie, running towards John and jumping so the doctor could pick her up.
John chuckled.
He crawled back to the camp. According to their step speed, he wouldn’t have more than ten minutes before they arrived at the shed. Sherlock entered Rosie’s tent and woke her up. The girl rubbed her eyes and muttered a protest.
“You know how to entertain a girl, don’t you?” gasped Molly, climbing up the stairs at full speed.
"Yes, she can do it," the elder Holmes opened his mouth, but the DI cut him off. "It's her house. Just because Sherlock lives here doesn't give you the right to enter."
Suddenly, in the living room, Holmes and Ross materialized as if from nowhere near the fireplace. The detective was looking at Everett with his eyes out of his head. Although Ross rested his gun's barrel on his head, Sherlock's gaze contained no fear, but surprise, betrayal, pain, and confusion. Everett was so focused on the detective that he didn't realize the doctor and Peter were there.
Lestrade chuckled at the innuendo.
“You kicked me” protested the detective, but John detected a trace of a mockery in his tone.
Everett smiled mischievously at the blush that filled Stephen's cheeks as he said, "You go to New York. We will go to London Sanctum".
John nodded.
When he surfaced, he held on to Sholto's outstretched arm, which pulled him up quickly and helped Sherlock to climb up afterwards.
“A bit, at first, but I realized you only want this to run smoothly. I know I can be a bit… scary sometimes”.
“Are you drunk?”
"You are going to..." started Everett.
All the parents similarly yelled at John. The doctor rubbed his mouth with his hand, now truly worried. He felt about to cry. Where was Sherlock? What happened to the kids?
John covered his eyes with his hand. Mrs. Hudson looked at him, worried.
"Put the gun down, please."
“You know, you said dangerous, and I’m here.”
"Good evening, DI and company," she cheerfully greeted them.
They all stared in that direction, surprised, and then at John, who pinched the bridge of his nose with his fingers, trying not to explode.
John, nearly unconscious, grunting in pain, was lying in a pool of his own blood while a frightened Sherlock knelt beside him, compressing the deepest wounds to stop them from bleeding and trying to calm down his husband until the paramedics arrived.
John's breathing partially relaxed. Part of his brain wanted to send Bill to hell, but, as a doctor, he knew exactly what he was trying to do. He forced himself to search through the mists of his brain, and he finally saw the cake. A cake with the characters from Frozen movie in fondant, a movie Rosie loved.
Rushed footsteps were heard and Sherlock’s older brother appeared on the doorpost. Donovan froze. Physically, he was the Mycroft she knew, but, apart from that, in that man there was nothing left of the proud, pedantic, posh, and self-confident freak’s older brother. Instead of his usual three-piece suit, he wore an ugly tobacco sweatshirt and old worn jeans. In his left hand he carried a pen and in his right one a notebook. But what impressed her most was his gaze, elusive and frightened, avoiding by all means making eye contact with the writer.
"We don't have much time." announced the detective, fastening his army boots, as Bill folded small pieces of paper written by Sherlock.
Bart, Geena, and Rosie disappeared inside the house. John turned to Sherlock.
"And now?" asked Sherlock, ignoring the fight between them.
Lestrade hold back a guffaw. He was happy for not have to act like a WWE Smackdown referee in the usual Donovan-Holmes combat.
He moved to the back of the doctor's head, watching his every move. Sherlock studied him carefully, looking for any sign of discomfort. For now, apart from nervous, the doctor was fine.
John's heart constricted a bit, envisioning a broken, hurt, and lost young Sherlock, struggling to quit the drugs, listening for the first time to say that he was worthy of being loved, wondering about his reaction.
Donovan gulped.
"Ohhhhhhhh, nngggnooo, yessssss, I can't, oh god……I can't." moaned the detective, lost in the sensations.
Peter's face was transfigured with emotion.
"The camera doesn't work," replied John. "But I'm fine. I'm sorry, I couldn't call you until now. I've had a lot of work".
The sound of the whip surprised him more than the smack in his ass.
"Let's see if you can play with that," teased Thor.
Donovan snarled.
"No, we must keep waiting."
"When Sherlock proposed to you, she finally proposed to me, which is why we are all here. We are celebrating both Sherlock's and our stag party. So you don't have anything to worry about. But she can't stop being a pain in the ass sometimes, especially with Sherlock nearby. You know how they are." she said, scolding Irene, who smiled in a way that pretended to be shy.
He was sitting on the arm of Sherlock's armchair, where the detective sat, both holding their hands, still fearing that something might separate them again. Although Stephen looked totally relaxed and confident, neither of them were calm after  playing with time.
John slowly ducked until his ass touched the tip of Sherlock's cock. The detective moaned as John grabbed his cock, to hold it firmly while, with the other hand resting on the detective's chest, he slowly lowered himself, inserting the tip of the cock into his already lubricated hole.
“Who do you think you are, Sherlock Holmes? Do you believe you turned into the reincarnation of that freak?”
The DI, almost buried in papers, looked at him, surprised.
"Stark?"
**********
"Please" Mycroft mused on his lips, "please, please, please, I can't, I can't anymore".
“No, you are not, he beat you to a pulp” replied the doctor, making the detective sit on one of the chairs and checking his ribs.
Mycroft didn't say anything until he opened the door, and music came to them.
John shook his head. How could the intelligence services have been so wrong? True, it was not the first time they had provided misinformation, but the mistake had been blatant.
John, afraid it was too much, made the others stop teasing Sherlock and he, Lestrade and the rest of the officers stroked themselves looking at the dildo going inside and out of Sherlock's arse at breakneck speed, the dildo nearly leaving Sherlock's passage each time and then stabbing back in, rotating and vibrating against his prostate, as the detective moaned and whined, sobbed and begged, a wrecked mess of sweat, cum, lust, pleasure, and exhaustion, arching in pleasure, shivering and crying with oversensitivity, as Donovan plunged in and out of the detective's ass, until her tights started trembling and, with a deep growl, she came, impaling the detective with the vibrating rotating dildo. The detective's body shook as the rest came hard also, covering Sherlock's body with cum.
Soon the kids started complaining about the long waiting and about wanting to go back to the camp.
Mycroft's face turned into a pout, and, for a few seconds, he looked like he was going to cry. He managed to pull himself together quickly.
*********
The assistant couldn't help but smile at the DI's hesitation, but she also noticed the panic in his voice.
"We are celebrating it together."
Sherlock smiled.
"Oh, I would love to, Mr. Stark, but... I would rather stay here with Doctor Watson, if he doesn't mind, of course."
"Shall we play Cluedo?"
"From time to time, the universe opens interdimensional portals. They are random. No one knows where they lead. If you are in the place where the portal opens, you slide through it."
“Let’s go home. I’m going to be making love to you until…”
Lestrade, who initially thought it was a bad joke, got livid when he realized Mycroft meant it. Enraged and disbelieving, he left Mycroft's house after a massive argument, intending never to meet that insensitive sadist again.
"I would ask you if you have been drinking, but since you are with the eldest Holmes, the question is: has he drugged you, and is he holding you against your will? If so, tell me to look for something in your office".
"Don't dare to give me a pep talk," Lestrade hissed. "When do we go?"
"Nobody, shoot!" ordered the Captain.
Sherlock smiled at the same words his Mind Palace’s John said before in the dolmen.
Sholto closed his eyes, desolate, assimilating the three words a rescue team was most afraid to hear.
"This feels sooooo fucking great," groaned the doctor. "God, I can fuck you like this all day," he moaned, holding on the ropes more tightly, to give higher intensity and speed to his thrusts, while he motioned the strings so, in addition to the swaying, the swing began to turn in on itself. John knew Sherlock's body, losing all spatial reference with the movement, would become more hypersensitive, his brain exacerbating all nerve connections to reorient itself.
"For the beach."
"When Sherlock arrived and held my hand, I told myself that, if I survived, I would not let anything or anyone take that away from me. And something inside myself got disconnected, ... something like the strength or the courage or the energy ... I don't know how to name it, but I'm unable to reconnect with that part of me. Somehow I'm not able to put myself back together since that day".
"Satisfied?" he grunted, although he could not deny he felt better.
Sherlock blushed furiously, while John chuckled.
"Let's check if you are correctly bounded."
John mumbled, stroking his cheek.
John moaned hard at Sherlock's fingertip, slowly tracing around the head of his cock, spreading his precum across it, his cock twitching hard. The caressing felt unbearable and delicious on his now extremely sensitive tip of his cock, but the detective controlled the pressure so John wouldn't come.
"Well, the new age nonsense just came through the gate," announced Natasha.
"Mycroft..." sighed the DI again.
“John!” this time, a warning filled Sherlock’s voice, “I swear I’ll kill you if you…”
He stopped at his brother's warning gaze.
“Everything?”
"What did you say?" John asked in a hoarse voice between coughs.
"Young lady, don't overdo it. Or what do you think, just because you have a new girlfriend, I won't scold you?"
Sherlock almost squatted down so that John could hold on to his back.
"Elaborate," asked Lestrade, rolling his eyes.
John pulled him back, away from the detective.
"Yes, but you can only resort to it on special occasions; otherwise, the way gets mad."
The bulge inside his trousers grew almost painfully, and Sherlock's erection became evident under his pyjama.
"Well, Batman, I must say it was a pleasure at the end," smiled Tony, reaching out to Sherlock.
Sherlock turned to him. The same James Sholto he met at the wedding: shoulders back, head held high, eyes flaming with determination. Although he was dressed in civilian clothes, it was easy to guess his military past.
"Would you mind returning the cab and then going back with them? I would be relieved if they were with someone who knew how to shoot a gun."
Sherlock parted, panting, blinking rapidly, his brain trying desperately to process what had just happened.
The receptionist flinched, picturing the scene. She gazed at Mrs. Hudson, who was staring at the wall and leaning over the chair, mumbling to herself, shaking her head. The receptions did not want to imagine the repercussions of trying to throw her out of the building.
"John is going to Mycroft's," Lestrade warned with a smeary tongue.
“All the victims, current and former ones had one thing in common: they were receiving treatment on an outpatient basis from their cancer.”
Mike looked at the other mercenaries, nervous. He still couldn't believe that John was really there, the same John Watson he had fallen in love with in Afghanistan, with whom he had shared everything until that damn ambush blew everything up. The same one of whom, ten years later, still had a photograph in his pocket, to not forget him.
"Sure," John smiled briefly "Thanks for listening to me."
"Something happened that led him to another dimension. Keep one thing in mind. Whatever happens, we cannot intervene. This Sherlock will lead us to Ross. If we intervene, we will create another timeline, and we may never find him".
"I'll kill you with my own hands," threatened the detective.
"Nobody did, Mycroft, not you, not me, not even John" the DI tried to comfort him. After almost two years of being together, he had learned to read behind the older Holmes's apparent coldness. He only saw Mycroft so defeated when he was shot.
"Strongest men." Sherlock kissed him back
"Oh, no, of course not. Besides, don't think we're going to stay in this private patch. Rosie needs to see people and interact with children, or she will become a premature adult."
“What about Lestrade?"
"What is that?"
John made Sherlock lie on the bed and straddled him, supporting his body with his forearms and feet, being careful not to rest his upper body onto Sherlock’s chest. It was kind of frustrating not be able to join their bodies, but extremely arousing at the same time, feeling their bodies' warmth without being able to touch each other, their hips the only point of contact between them, both already fully hard, panting and moaning softly, when they rubbed their erections.
"It was the only way to put up with that idiot," Sherlock justified himself, smiling slightly as well. "But thanks to that, I remembered it. I had no idea and didn't care who said that, but I knew Mycroft would".
"Sherlock is in the queue for the flight to Kabul," announced another of the officers.
making Sherlock come.
Lestrade sighed in anguish and hugged him, letting Mycroft sink his nose into his hair, trying to comfort both himself and his boyfriend. He was sure Mycroft did know what to do. But not how to deal with what was sure to be the first panic attack of his life.
But instead, he felt his hands cupping his face and the gentle, tentative rubbing of the detective's lips on his own.
After deciphering Sherlock's message, she told Rosie she had to get into the carrier and be very quiet, no matter what happened. Rosie, knowing that something else was cooking in that game, obeyed without complaining or asking questions, reading the nervousness and fear in her godmother's face.
Suddenly, he was again the child that nobody liked. The child that was insulted and segregated at the school, the child that, on a daily basis, was cornered, bullied and beaten by his school mates for being different, making him feel dreadful just for being himself.
"Shit."
“Have fun, Rosie!” said Mrs. Hudson, bending to receive a quick kiss from the girl. “See you on Monday.”
"I never sold anyone out for drugs."
Stephen nodded.
“Actually, she is my stepdaughter, my husband’s daughter, for previous marriage, with a woman.”
"Let me finish this, and I'll go. It will only take me around half an hour," he explained, knowing she was dying to ask him precisely that. She nodded and ran again to the next room.
Both climbed the stairs to Lestrade’s office. The DI requested to officers to get back the rest of the boxes to the Archive.
"I didn't see it that way, I'm sorry." Mycroft conceded.
"Everything is ready."
John turned to him, tilting his head with a threatening gesture.
She woke up at nine o’clock, had a shower, sipped a bit of coffee and went to New Scotland Yard. She was smiling hopefully.
"Yes, I do, because werewolves are the only creatures capable of slaying ghouls. It's the only way to end with this nightmare".
Another whiplash landed on his ass, and Mycroft stiffened, feeling how two stretchy rings attached his cock and testicles separately and firmly.
Sherlock checked them and then took the file from John’s hands, reading it quickly.
It was Sally Donovan who first realized it and told Lestrade and the rest of her colleagues, but none of them took much notice. Greg was in no mood for guessing. For a week, he and his team had been spending ten hours a day, making sure that the drivers they met didn't break through the confinement.
“Great!“ He took his phone and texted Sherlock.
He turned to the rest.
"First, let him free."
“I've told you it a thousand times: not at work!”
"Sherlock is right. You don't tell us where the bombs are because you know we would disable the code immediately."
"What would you give to be with John now?"
John checked Sherlock's pulse, worried. His heart rhythm was lowering; he was gasping for air, shaking for hypothermia.
******
“It’s time for you to understand that I love you, and that means that I will take care of you, I’ll share your burdens and I’ll help you to get over everything, no matter what it is. And if I were to leave you because you have the disgrace of coming across that… sadist, it would only mean that I am a complete arsehole, a slobbering idiot unable of appreciating all the intelligence, courage, strength and resilience you needed to put this behind you and get to be who you are now, the best man I’ve ever known, the brilliant fool I love madly”.
“Your first boyfriend?” squeaked the doctor.
"Just follow the arrows on the ground, Gregory," Mycroft's voice has a tone somewhere between desperate and almost tender to John's astonishment.
"That is what you read while you were tearing up Baker Street?" grunted Mycroft.
Sherlock let out a whiled moan. John looked at his hard-rock, reddened cock, and looked at the stream of precum flowing from the tip down the shaft. Unable to restrain himself, John bent down and gave a couple of licks to his dick's tip.
"Come with me. I'd like to show you something..." Anthea asked Sally who, surprised, followed her up the stairs to John's old room, which was now Rosie's.
"I know," Lestrade replied, and both chuckled. He walked over and kissed Mycroft, stroking his cheek wound.
"I told you it wasn't me! I don't know who that man is, or why he is trying to frame me, but it wasn't me!" Sherlock fought back, desperate.
"Half an hour. And by prescription," Bruce pointed to the teenager with his index finger, "if you take any longer, I will come to get you myself, and you'll be grounded until you turn thirty."
“Mr. Holmes, Doctor Watson. We all owe you an apology. John, you were right. Mr. Holmes not only protected our children but gave them the best time of their lives. I’m afraid we… were seized by… you know, rumours and…” she cast an accusing glance at Donovan, who lowered her eyes, ashamed, mumbling an apology.
"Sherlock?"
John enjoyed those moments in intimacy, in accompanying silence. Between cases, his work, Rosie, and the wedding plan, last months had been complete madness, in which they hardly had time to be like that, alone, calm and in silence, just enjoying the pleasure of being together.
The detective opened his eyes wide and cried with surprise, his body trembling as his prostate was mercilessly attacked. John soon mimicked the fucking machine's pace. Sherlock let out a moaned curse. Suddenly, all the edging John had undergone was coming back, and he felt an orgasm grow inside him that would break him in two.
The question was followed by roars, especially from where the Yards.
Mycroft lowered his head. He couldn't understand what happened to Sherlock. He kept a close eye on his brother, and since his marriage to John, he achieved greater stability than at any other time in his life.
“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t…” apologized Greg.
John nodded. He also feared the place, the books, Bart and Geena, impacted negatively in him. Although months passed since the events in Sherrinford and Sherlock had time to process them, he hadn't confronted any scenes from his childhood, from his life before Victor's disappearance, something they both knew he needed to do sometime.
Anthea sighed sadly.
Everett nodded, mentally trying to warn her.
The door burst open. Lestrade, gun in hand, stumbled over Donovan's body lying on the floor.
"I'm giving you the chance to fix it."
“I’m sorry, John.”
Both men looked at the paper, a kilometric list of things needed for the camping, most of them provided by the school from former Friends’ camps.
John's moans intensified. He bucked his lips a bit, trying to get Sherlock's attention to his cock, but he limited himself to smile against his crack while licking the rim, as John squirmed with his licks. Sherlock gently tickled his balls while kept licking him. John's chuckled moan ran directly to Sherlock's cock, just as his chocked sound when Sherlock's tongue traveled through his perineum to the base of his balls.
In response Donovan took out a dossier and handed it to John.
Moriarty approached a bit more. As it happens with any dark creature, the negative emotions attracted him, and Sherlock’s intense hatred towards Mycroft, mixed with his grieve for John, acted as a magnet for him.
Peter opened his eyes wide.
The detective spread his fingers in the back of John's neck, softly caressing it, making the doctor shiver at the ghostly touch while he slipped his tongue into John's mouth, licking his tongue with deliberately soft strokes.
Eight armed men surrounded Mycroft and Sherlock. From the shadows of the door, a short, strong, redheaded man with a white scar on his forehead appeared. He wore a smug, cold, dismissive smile, framed by very thin, almost non-existent lips. He walked around them, slowly, watching Mycroft from top to bottom.
“I don’t see how sharing other human’s mites could be fun,” he growled.
Sherlock stopped the motorbike on the slope of the dune and rested it on the ground. He climbed to the top and lay down on it, looking at the wooden hut at the foot of the other side of the dune, when the sandy ground ended and the stony ground began. Sharp the coordinates provided by John.
Mycroft sighed.
Dog tags.
“Sherlock”…
"Of course not. I love you," he assured, mentally adding Stephen. "I thought you were mad at me for the wedding. It was a mistake, but I was so confused…"
"You jumped out of a car to come back to me?" he smiled, kissing him softly.
Molly laughed.
The Supreme Sorcerer didn't answer and just disappeared behind the gate. The others followed silently.
“I DIDN’T!”
"Why don't you say so?" Mycroft's tone was a mixture of anger and grief.
“Sherlock, I’m a doctor and I…”
Sherlock seemed on the verge of throwing up about John’s word.
"What about the implant?"
"Oh, Gooood, this is the best day of my life…" moaned the DI.
“I don’t understand… Do you mean going back to Afghanistan? I can’t go back there!”
"God… Sherlock," he closed his eyes, panting, mad with desire, "let me…" the plead dissolved in a loud moan.
"Fucking hell, John!" exclaimed the detective, who was not expecting it, worried by John's indefinable expression, "Are you okay?"
"All right, all right, I won't say anything to Donovan and the rest. You will remain the same heartless smug prick convinced that we Yards are worthless".
"I'll just ask Myc to take a look at it, although I guess he already knows that."
"The woman in the square?" asked the DI, who had seen Sherlock talk to her a couple of difficult cases.
"I don't know either, apart from the obvious, which is you to stay out of London."
Sherlock smirked and shook his head.
He heard Sherlock grunt at Bill, mumbling "fuck, it wasn't that hard", but before he could say anything, the detective was already talking.
Lestrade cut her off amidst the other's laughter. He looked at Stephen in amazement.
"But… this is too much," he gasped, caressing the facsimiles of Paganini's original scores he just unwrapped.
Sherlock smiled, eyes full of happy tears.
“When I see her accepted by other children, playing with them... so different from my childhood, I think I'm doing something right and that any effort is worthwhile”.
"What are you doing here?" he bellowed.
"Someone just broke into your house. A neighbor called NSY".
“Yes, you are,” shouted Rosie from her bedroom.
She looked radiant. She, like Molly, had been appointed by Rosie to be her bridesmaids. When the girl told her friend Sarah her parents would get married, she asked her who the bridesmaids would be. As soon as Rosie came back home, she stood in front of the armchair, where John was updating his blog and threw the bomb.
"After testifying, Sebastian tried to kill me twice. They enrolled me in a protection program for witnesses until the trial. But, I decided I didn't want to spend my life as John Smith, unable to practice medicine. So, as soon as I finished my studies, I enlisted in the army and went to Afghanistan. But I didn't count on being shot and coming back to London".
"I have to die," mused the elder Holmes.
Everyone heard a guttural, mumbling, almost inaudible at the first sinister laugh, which gradually grew louder, wicked and smug. It was Lestrade who first realised that it was coming from Clay's throat., his eyes fixed on Mycroft. The DI closed his eyes, fighting the urge to snap his neck.
Sherlock grunted as John opened the oven, pulled out the stuffed aubergines, and turned to look at him.
"They'll be fine."
Clay cracked a laugh.
“You said you need my help, what for?”
Lestrade looked at him, surprised. It was easy to forget these men had a life before living in the streets, with a job, a family, and a routine. Life, at times, could be a bitch.
"Your daughter?" Mike's voice sounded puzzled. "The London team was supposed to follow Mycroft Holmes' niece, not your daughter."
"Clay is a clever guy. He always stood out from the rest, in tests... in everything but also has an excessive ego and he was proud to surpass all his previous bosses. When I hired him, every time he was promoted, he repeated the damn thing" answered the older Holmes.
"I can't believe it," he smiled, "I am shaking Captain America's hand.
"He worked as a warden at the Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford."
"These are your magnificent deduction talents you are so proud of?" Lestrade asked.
But, what if Bill was right? What if Sherlock googled for the perfect stag night and was now enjoying his last sexual encounter as a bachelor?
John gave himself a couple of strokes to release a bit of pressure in his hard cock and walked to the basket, looking for something that could serve as a lubricant. He blushed slightly when he found a tube of lube, imagining Bart or Geena happily humming while preparing the basket.
"Ahhhhhh, not…" Sherlock grunted when John's hands rubbed over his nipples, pinching and playing with them. John moaned and shivered, feeling Sherlock's walls clenching around his cock. He started thrusting deeper inside him, as one of his hands snaked down from his nipple to grab his cock, while bitting his neck, as Sherlock cried in pleasure, arching his back.
"I will fuck you slowly…".
"No, I shouldn't have blamed you. You wanted to help John. In your own twisted, bossy way," Mycroft snorted, "but you wanted to help him overcome Mike's death, the nightmares and... you know."
"I love you, Sherlock."
Once out of the house, the detective took his phone and attached the man's photograph to a message.
Mycroft smiled to himself. He took the bait. One of his employee's obsessions when working with him was to prove that he was smarter than him and Sherlock combined, which he never did, of course. True, he was an extremely clever man for the average, but a fool compared to the two of them. And also vain. He hated it when Mycroft recruited his brother for some mission that Clay couldn't compete with and Sherlock did it in a blink of an eye.
"He had to know," replied Mycroft.
Sherlock's quicked his pumps. John grunted loudly, as Sherlock hummed softly, kissing him, his hand running back and forth, his thumb gently caressing their glands, spreading more precum around their cocks.
"But John didn't marry Mary," replied Steve, frowning. "He married John."
"We have a problem. Remember the spatial-temporal coordinates you asked me to lookup? There is indeed an anomaly."
"Fuck…. Fuck," he groaned, "ohhh holy shit."
“Now, Sherlock or this is over” he ordered firmly, pointing the two of them.
Sherlock sucked a gasp, and his cock throbbed, suddenly remembering the previous game. John shoved the object into Sherlock's mouth, which the detective licked gluttonously. The huge dildo was an amazing, exact replica of John's cock. The doctor fucked Sherlock's mouth for a few moments, then pulled it out and covered it with lube.
"You are amazing, John Watson," said Sherlock, cupping John's head between his hands and kissing him softly on the lips. "Every time I think you can't surprise me anymore, you achieve to do it."
"I had to double the sedative," Lestrade replied, watching him with concern. "And Sherlock?"
Donovan knew why. She recalled that the report mentioned that the taxi driver suffered from a terminal illness. As Sherlock and the ghost shooter weren’t there to catch him, the ”suicides” should cease when the taxi driver died.
She laughed and raised her hand to do the military salute.
"I said no".
When they finished, it was almost dinner time, so John organized the C captains to help him cooking, while the rest, helped by Sherlock, set the big portable table stored in a little shed next to the camp and distributed seventeen camping stools around it.
"He said I would fall in love with him, and he would also love me just the way I am."
"Yes, yes. No!" he blushed when John and Sherlock exchanged a mocking look and turned to escape Sherlock's scrutiny "Women, thirty-five years, no signs of violence, her bag holds all her belongings, money, credit cards, everything."
The punch on the table made Mycroft finch and startled Donovan. She was aware of Doctor Watson’s outbursts, especially the ones addressed to Sherlock (which she enjoyed a lot), but the doctor was about to lose self-control utterly.
The doctor knelt slowly, his blue eyes fixed in Sherlock’s blue-green, for a while each floating in the other’s eyes, oblivious to the rest of the world, drinking each other’s love, lust and passion, lost in each other, found in each other, the broken pieces finally put together into a perfect puzzle until, with no warning, John took Sherlock’s cock in his mouth, swallowing almost the whole of it easily, his nose buried into Sherlock’s pubic hair as the detective growled, grabbed the doctor’s hair, thrust up and came instantly, arching his back, trying to bury his cock in John’s throat as deep as he could, as John moaned, almost chocking with the detective’s cock, sucking and swallowing his powerful orgasm, firmly gripping Sherlock’s hips to prevent him from falling from the chair as the detective, almost screaming, shivered and moaned in shocked pleasure.
Three hours later, when everyone had left, Sherlock and John dropped off on the couch, the first smothered, the second exhausted.
He got into Speedy's and ordered a coffee, hoping that the caffeine would help him get up the courage. It was still early, and he needed to clear his head a little. No. There was nothing to clear up. He had been an asshole, being taken against Sherlock by the same people who hated him from the first day when, high on drugs, told them they were wrong about a murder case.
But Sherlock was puzzled by the murders. He certainly didn't behave as if he was the perpetrator. He shook his head. What a stupid thing to do. If anyone knew how to cover up the fact that he was the author of a murder, it would be Sherlock. But he didn't. Greg knew him, and he knew the self-proclaimed high-functioning sociopath wasn't that. With John, he achieved a stability he hadn't had before. No matter how hard Donovan tried and the cameras proved it, it wasn't Sherlock who did it, he was sure of it, but he would need a third Sherlock to prove it.
"No, my brother is excited about pissing me off, and that's why he wants to be the best man."
Lestrade blinked like a deer caught by the car lights.
Mycroft and Sherlock looked at each other. Mycroft cleared his throat and pursed his lips.
They got into the cab, still arguing. Donovan, aware of the car following them, kept quiet until they reached Baker Street.
He didn’t want another accident on the river, so he carried the kids piggyback one by one to the other shore. At first, he just walked, but soon he was jumping and splashing in the water, running from shore to shore to transport them, which was celebrated with laughers and excited cries from the children, carried in pairs, in threes… Suddenly, he felt as when he played pirates with Victor in the shore, both running and splashing through the water also. He lost count of how many times he crossed the river.
"We don't know, sir. He disabled the tracking system in his phone".
"That is why you behaved like a sadistic prick."
“Or I could make you come so many times that I’d shut your brain down.”
Anthea looked through Donovan before answering.
John chuckled.
"I want to believe that he did. But..., I get the impression that..., the universe has been wrong about me".
The DI's tone alarmed him. He sounded angry, worried, sorry, and scared.
Mycroft shuddered. Lestrade dressed in military gear and dominant was more than he could handle. One more word and he would be on his knees to him. He shook his head. The mission, the mission; he should focus on the task, though it was clear that Lestrade should keep the uniform.
It only took him a tenth of a second to realize Bill had sold him out.
"He won't do anything like this. He promised me he would bring them to you".
The Supreme Sorcerer sat down on the floor, crossed his legs, closed his eyes, and levitated. A couple of minutes later, he opened his eyes, turned his hands, and created a portal just where Sherlock's body had disappeared.
Mycroft got up and went over to the lectern. The door opened, and Donovan and Anderson came in, accompanied by Gregson and the Chief Superintendent.
He shook his head in Sherlock and John's direction, who were walking away from a portal opened in one of the semi-ruined castles.
"You still can't come until I tell you to. I don't care if you have your cock in my arse."
Even with the dildo, Sherlock's ass was still fucking tight, his cock impossibly hard inside him. John moaned with pleasure, Sherlock made agonizing sounds, breathing heavily through clenched teeth, hands firmly resting on the counter, forcing his arms to prevent John's hard push to ram him up against the counter.
“In the Archive, I guess. Line two. Don’t keep him waiting. He’s fuming”.
Sherlock blushed, delighted.
“You have been busy, haven’t you, Holmes?” asked Anderson, puzzled.
“The convicts imprisoned here haven’t had sexual contact with any human being since the day they arrived here” explained the doctor “but today, they are overexcited, because they got a present.
The only thing he was sure about was he couldn’t lose John again. No matter what would happen, he wouldn’t let Moriarty separate them again. Neither let him hurt any of the few people he actually cared about.
Mycroft looked at his brother.
The C.I.A. agent grabbed it and began to push the spirits away with all his might, trying to advance to John, but failing to do so.
Sherlock looked at Lestrade, imploring. The DI sighed, defeated.
"Antimatter?" asked Clint as an echo.
"I'd better take them off, lest they get stained," Sherlocks' hands reached under John's pants, avoiding touching him and took them off.
Donovan snuffled.
"Or I'll blow your head off before you can pull the trigger," replied the woman, firmly holding the gun in both hands.
John, who until then had limited himself to watching both contestants fighting, leaned forward to bring his face as close as possible to Donovan's.
********
"But she used to be an independent girl and now is glued to us constantly," Sherlock".
He gasped in surprise when John left the cup on his back. He lay down on his back behind him and crawled under his open legs until he was under the lump that Sherlock's expectant cock had formed in his shorts.
"I seem to be doing okay so far," Sherlock mused, rotating his hips slightly, noticing how John's cock started showing a big interest.
Sherlock smiled, embarrassed.
“I love you too, Bumblebee."
Lestrade stood up as the plane landed in London, twenty minutes later.
"So the red thread of destiny connects the pinky fingers of both lovers" he unconsciously ran his finger over his and seemed to lose himself in a dream for a few seconds until he came back to reality.
“I know, but it so gorgeous that it has to be said twice...”
"Clay stood up as a leader and thought he had it all figured out, but Sherlock went off to smash Moriarty's network, that is Clay's net. The last piece of it left was the Serbian one, which was when Sherlock was captured".
"Nor I deserve you. But that's why we're perfect for each other".
Mike smiled at John's amazed look.
healed."
"Who is John. Who is the real John." hissed the detective, madly.
"Not dating" hissed Irene, her turn to be offended, scowling at Molly.
"Can't you read?"
He put flour, butter, and sugar in a bowl and put it all together and then put the dough on the floured table.
John put on the gown and the surgical mask Sherlock gave him and followed them into the dining room. Sherlock had emptied the kitchen table and brought it by the fire so that John was warm and comfortable. On a white tablecloth decorated with red hearts chosen by Rosie, as John would later know, were set two plates, a mug, and a soup tureen. The doctor looked inquisitively at Sherlock.
The DI shook his head. He never heard that name before.
Sholto sat and fastened his seat belt while Sherlock did the same. The plane ran down the runway and took off. The passengers looked out of the window, commenting on what was below.
The detective came instantly, wildly jerking his hips, tensing his body, moans, and grunts stifled by Anderson's cock, who kept torturing the detective's throat, enjoying all the sounds that came from it.
*********
The cook disappeared inside the house. John looked at Sherlock, distressed.
Inside the portal, ghosts of the past wailed, howling around Everett, Sherlock, and John, circling each one until they almost disappeared.
Sherlock nodded
"When suffering from amnesia, it is important to return to a familiar environment to help the brain remember," Holmes replied. "Does it feel familiar?"
"Don't be afraid, Aunt Irene. My parents will save us".
"Time to go home. This visit to London has been great, but duty calls" said  Thor, standing up.
“Them?” Do you mean we are going to see more than one?” asked Sarah.
"Look at me." the detective sneered.
"Was he at the other wedding?" James asked.
John could see the detective was in the same state as him, his hard cock swollen and red, his thighs trembling. But detective arched an eyebrow with a clear meaning: John was not in the position of giving orders.
"Please, Sherlock……..," he moaned. "I can't, I can't... I need..."
"But what if Mycroft would have read the papers?" asked Lestrade, and the others nodded.
*******
stop, John. Fuck me, harder John, fuck me ahhhhhhhhhhhh" until he came in Anderson's mouth while John fucked him through his orgasm. The doctor groaned in pleasure sensing Sherlock arse clenching around his cock while the detective came, his hands gripping the table with all his strength, whining and moaning as John hit his oversensitized prostate, the doctor almost howling, approaching to his own orgasm, to finally coming hard inside Sherlock, twisting his body while the detective clenched and unclenched his hole, squeezing John's cock inside him.
"Yeah, they make cool to be an only child," mocked Tony.
"Is it working?" panted Ross, piercing spirits with the sword, knocking and slamming others.
“No ... I can't… er. It is confidential.”
******
“I know, thanks, Bart.”
"You may wonder?" replied the doctor.
Clay's laughter was heard more clearly over the phone, flooding everyone's ears.
“Sarah, could you make them go back to the camp?”
Soon after, in the cemetery, when finally everyone, including Mrs. Hudson, left him alone, John stood by Sherlock's grave, a shallow marble tablet with the detective's name on it.
“Novels? John Watson writes a blog.“
She cursed Zoltar. No. One moment. She had the chance of her life and couldn’t ruin in. Shew will prove everyone that she could solve the crimes without the freak’s help.
He shook their hands and spoke to them briefly in a mixture of English and Pashtun. They helped the soldiers load the luggage into the cars, except for Sherlock's backpack, that the detective would not let go.
"Insufferable knowing-it all," muttered John, kissing the back of Sherlock's neck, making him giggle. He brushed the skin with his lips, turning to lick it with the tip of his tongue or gently nibbling it, as SHerlock squirmed under the soft teasing as John's hands ran up and down his chest.
"It's all right, Peter, don't worry. Everything's under control".
Holmes observed him for a few seconds. The CIA agent held his gaze, which allowed him to look at him more closely, for the first time in broad daylight. Sometimes, Everett couldn't wonder if he wasn't Stephen; if the Supreme Sorcerer somehow lost his mind and transmuted into the man in the coat. The physical resemblance, except for the long, curly hair and the lack of a mustache and goatee, was impressive. He could even see in Holmes some of Stephen's gestures, which, deep down, reassured him. But it also made him sad. Listening to the man who looked so much like Stephen, saying the words he wanted to hear Strange's lips, filled his heart and broke it at the same time.
They both shook their heads without moving an inch.
John looked back at her.
Rosie looked at Sherlock, pouting.
“Noooooooo” they shouted in unison, stomping the ground to make his opposition clear.
“I lost them, John, I lost the kids,” sobbed Sherlock.
"Well, I think we could cut the social crap and move on to..." Stark started.
“Going back to the point when all started to be wrong.”
But it was short because John uncapped a bottle of lube and poured it into his fingers to softly rubbing Sherlock's hole, relaxing it. The detective bent his legs, feet firmly planted on the table, raising his pelvis to make it easier for John to play with his ass, John groaning hungrily with the vision of Sherlock covered with cum and surrounded by cocks.
“Fuck, John!”
"You weren't going to tell me?"
"This is none of your business."
Bart nodded.
"Yours and your cock's fault."
He moved away from the man and addressed to the door, mentally counting from three to one. When his mind reached the one, the man screamed.
Lestrade arched an eyebrow.
"Obviously."
"Come, Papa, as in class, I'll help you. Don't be afraid".
Sherlock lowered his head.
He came out of his stupor when John gently nudged him. Following his gaze, he saw Mycroft and Greg gently brushing their little fingers on theirs left hands as tryinf to find the thread that bound them together. It was Mycroft's turn to hawk and separate Lestrade's finger as if it was burning when he noticed the others looking at them.
