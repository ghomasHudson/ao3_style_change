John chuckled as he sorted through the cupboards and found the bread and beans, then went to the icebox to find some eggs and a nice ripe tomato for a proper fry up. Surely much heavier than the fawn was used to, but he needed the calories when he was on the mend.
Within an hour he reached the old tree, and slipped inside, inhaling the familiar scent of his mate. He went to work collecting quilts and folding them neatly into his pack, then the books, cradled in the soft blankets.
Sherlock smiles as John talks, still gripping his hand. After John finishes Sherlock speaks, "Here, wait a minute, " the younger boy pulls his backpack from the floor, and unzips it, he pulls out a heavy (to a child) book and hands it to John. It's a book on the African continent's animals and stuff all about them. "It's for you. I noticed one day when you came over to do homework in the library how you liked this book. So I asked Mycroft if we could find another copy for you."
"Um.." Mycroft laughs lightly, looking away.  He'd never been in a relationship platonic nor romantic before, people tend to stay away from him; like his brother, he is too forward with what he thinks and makes enemies.  What would be proper of him?
"My life...my love. I'm going to make you feel good...just lean back and get comfortable." He promised, smiling and he moved down, planting kiss after kiss down Fawnlock's chest and stomach, working around the healing wounds.
Once the jumper was out of the way and not a scrap of fabric was between them, John relished the soft slide of the warm, velvety fur against his bare skin. He was careful not to put too much pressure on the healing wounds on Fawnlock's chest, but keeping him on top helped tremendously. The fingertips sliding up and down his sides really was lovely, but it was the snuffling wet nose at his neck and the mouth against his ear that was sublime.
John laid back with a smile as Fawnlock continued to nuzzle at his shoulder. It was adorable really, and really touched John. Usually, people had shied away from his wounded shoulder, they were disgusted by it, or pitied him for its existence. But Fawnlock accepted it as part of John and had no problem pressing his cheek up against it, his nose, his mouth his fingers. It was little things like this that echoed his love for John, things like this that verified he'd just been waiting for Fawnlock all his life. Laying here with him felt more right than anything in his life. It felt perfect.
The fawn smiled softly, the jumper fit nicely, and it didn't feel confining like the other clothes he'd worn before, and as John had said, it was very warm and toasty. The fawn gave a soft bleat leaning forward to rub noses with his mate, the rumbling sounding deep in his chest.
Sherlock smiles, shoving his softest blankets into the fort, "Mycroft and I do, when there's storms out or I can't sleep." He goes over to retrieve his bumblebee plushie, shoving it behind his back as he throws some pillows at John, "Let's go inside, you've got a torch, right?"
Moosecroft unfastened his cloak and folded it to rest upon his lap as he sat across from his brother, watching with a curious lift of his brow and the fawn seemed to ready himself for a vocal volley between them.
There was no point on keeping himself contained and proper anymore; apparently the fawn had no hang-ups on pursuing their relationship in more physical terms, so John shouldn't either. Which was more than fine for the blond.
John smiled and thanked Mrs. Hudson again before she left, then leaned over to inspect the sandwiches before plucking one up and biting into it happily. They may have just been butties, but the food had that wonderful homey grandmother taste to them, and John found he was absolutely in love with the older fae. She was a sweetheart, and made John feel at peace in a way he'd never known, his grandmother having died when he was very young. He looked about her cottage as he chewed, but his gaze was eventually drawn back to the most interesting thing in the room, Fawnlock. John reached out with his free hand and gently patted the other's knee. "What else do you have planned for today?"
As the fawn reached his shoulder, John felt the moment of hesitation, and knew the reason for it, leaning back and staring up at Fawnlock. The wound was healed over, but still was angry and red, marring the skin just below the curve of his shoulder. The back was scarred as well, a starburst pattern where the bullet had exploded as it exited his body, leaving hot shrapnel to burn the skin. John's opposite hand stroked the fae's back, trying to take his attention from the ugly scar.
"I apologized, but she was still upset, it's barely my fault." The fawn's eyes and ears fell downcast as he stepped into the clearing and started towards the cottage.
"I love you, I love you. Always...forever." He promised, slipping his hands down along his mate's svelte body and curved rough hands down over his soft backside.
Even without most of the quilts, Fawnlock's original nest was wonderfully comfortable to sit in. The leaves where soft and worn, and the whole thing smelled like Fawnlock. John watched the fae flit about to stoke up a fire. When he scooted over to warm up John with himself, John was all too happy to accept. He could tell the fawn was excited however, and he hurried away to retrieve his beloved instrument.
"I'm pretty sure we already have Mrs. Hudson's blessing. She was all sly smiled when I visited her today. There's no hiding it from you fae, not when I smell like you." He smiled and leaned back so he could see Fawnlock's face.
His tail swished playfully as he peered over his shoulder at his mate. The Fae mock pouted, "Master pillow fighter of no, bring it on, I still know how to romp, thank you." he grinned a bit coyly at John.
When Mrs. Hudson returned, John released Fawnlock to look up at her, nodding in thanks and watching as the fawn directed his pouted at her, his silver, baleful gaze sweeping up to look at the elder fae as he made his cup of tea.
John loved the feel of the fawn seated in his lap, close enough so John could rove his hands up along the sleek body, feel every flexing muscle ripple beneath his fingertips. Fawnlock's voice was deep to begin with, but the rumble made it even lower, making John shudder and sigh against the fawn's throat. He hated to ask him to repeat himself, but he didn't want to miss a single word between them.
Sherlock settles his backpack into his lap, with a smile, "I don't know, Mary cooks all sorts of things every day, though I think she said something about chicken." The taller boy shrugs, tapping his fingers on the seam of his bag. "I can't wait to show you my lab, John, it's bigger than the one in the summer house, and maybe we could go out into the yard and I can show you my tree." The younger boy smiles at his friend reaching over to take his hand.
John glanced down at their hands pressed palm to palm, then wriggled his fingers up in between the fawn's, linking their hands together. His gaze flicked back up to Fawnlock's, staring into the pale eyes. "I have an older sibling, like you. We aren't very close. My mum died when I was very young. Da tried to step up and raise us, but her death broke his heart and he lost himself in the bottle. Our aunt took us in and raised us while Da drank himself to death. I'm not angry at him for it...I understand he had his reasons. Harry though... she's following the way of our Da. It's driving a wedge between us, but she's old enough that I can't make her decisions for her. She wasn't around at all when I came back. Didn't even come to our Aunt's funeral. So...I do have a herd I suppose. Its just very small and broken." He gave a small smile up at Fawnlock, shrugged his shoulders gently.
The fae’s chatter, which John had been enjoying didn't last very long, for soon the fae was bolting up, excitingly alerting John to the existence of an instrument. John blinked in surprise; he hadn't known that Fawnlock played anything. Before John could even comment on it, his mate's face fell, distraught over the fact his violin had been left behind. Well John could fix that. He smoothed a hand over a drooping ear, then chucked under Fawnlock's chin.
He walked slowly along the path, letting his gait match Fawnlock's so they were side by side. Despite his brother's obvious worry, Moosecroft would have never denied him happiness. He simply had to see how dedicated his sibling was. A bond was nothing to take lightly after all.
There was a dull throb on his neck from where Fawnlock had sucked his mark, and it wavered in that wonderful place between pleasure and pain, making John gasp out his mates name in an almost desperate plea.
"We invited you. It's my pleasure." Mycroft gives Mrs. Watson a brilliant smile and passes out the tickets.
"Fawnlock..." he breathed, hands slipping into the thick curls to hold the fae's head as he leaned in for a kiss, bringing their lips together urgently.
"Of course," John smiled and drained a sip of the tea himself, looking out into the flickering flames of the fire.
Winston takes off and both Sherlock and himself are practically bouncing in their seats. "Don't worry, I told him to pack all of your favorite things."
The corners of the fawn’s Cupid bow lips twitched up in a slight smile at the almost electric feel of the magic all around him, just as he remembered it from his days as a young fawn, frolicking through the Fae Forest of his childhood "journeying" on fantastical adventures of his own each day.
After collecting some newspapers Mycroft said he was done with, Sherlock shows John how he usually folded them.
The Fae tipped his head slightly to catch John's lips with his, nipping at his mate's bottom lip lightly to calm him, "/John, you're doing it again, you sound adorable,/" he murmured softly, "/Your accent is clumsy and thick, it's lovely./" He bleated once more and nuzzled at John's jaw.
"I want to stay here with you tonight. I know you have to go to the gate at midnight...but I'll be here when you get back and we can sleep together."
John laces their fingers, shifting closer and lays his head on Sherlock's. The peace that they had made when they met at the beach returns and he is happy.  No one can take that from him.
The Fae pulled away from the kiss panting softly, ears flicking, his dark hands slide from John's hair, down his sides and down even more to grip his mate's hips.
Sherlock looks up to his brother before nodding vigorously, "Yes, for mummy." He assures him. Sherlock leans into his brother for comfort that he rarely seeks. Typically only when he's in a bad way.
Sherlock sits next to John and rolls his eyes at Mycroft. Winston enters with a tray of four bowls and settles one in front of each boy, then sets one down for himself for after he cleans up.
John bandaged the sealed gashes on Fawnlock's chest, taking note of what medical supplies he needed to replenish on his next ride into town. Just as he was making a mental checklist, he felt the fawn take up his hand, bringing it to his mouth and kissing it ever so softly. He smiled gently, bringing his other hand up to cup the fae's cheek.
"What do you think about?" John asks, staring out at the beautiful London view. He could get used heights if he could see views like this.
Once John had settled in, moving his meager belongings into the old home, it had become more of a home to him then any other structure he'd inhabited. That rustic charm had drawn him in almost immediately, and he rarely left the sanctuary it had created for him, except to stock supplies by way of the old Ford Angelina that sat rusting in the car park, also an inheritance from that dear old aunt. He told himself that it was just for a few months, a year at most, enough time for him to heal and re-acclimate to the world that didn't revolve around the war. But the more days that separated him from and the general population, the longer he realized that he wouldn't survive in that world any longer. He had become a different creature.
John rested his hands on the fawn's hips, stroking slowly and encouraging his exploring hands. Really,. For a split second they pulled apart, gazes meeting, and John could see that ghost of a smile before the fae grew braver in his approach, earning a quick intake of breath from the man.
Sherlock nods, "Yeah, the back yard," he grabs John's hand once more with a small smile on his lips.
Fawnlock's ears flickered towards the noise, his tail swishing twice in slight irritation, his gaze flitted to John, a question in his gaze he was sure his mate could read without trouble.
"Yes, would you like to help us finish?" John crawls over to the maze, picking up the piece he was using before and sets it in place.
Sherlock frowns slightly, he didn't want John to think he was weird, and not like him, but he also didn't want to lie to his only friend, "I like to perform experiments and examine things," he mutters softly, "I like gaining new knowledge and finding things out for myself." He stands with a slight sniff, a bit afraid John would write him off for a know-it-all weirdo and leave him.
He flicks up his eye patch, "It isn't nice to embarrass your younger brother, though." He points out quietly, raising a brow at the older girl, "That's what Winston tells my brother."
He looks to John expectantly, smile still painted on his lips. John grabs Sherlock's hand and squeezes it, he had sincerely missed his friend. It had worried him that he wasn't going to show for a moment there, "Yea, love them. Why?"
"She went to a friend's house," Sherlock lies smoothly. Even Mycroft couldn't tell, "John and I are perfectly safe, we locked the door, and it's a safe neighborhood."
"Mycroft, Winston, Mary and Mrs. Hudson surprised me with this, it's a mouse maze... Mycroft said once I've put it together he has another surprise."
As he felt the second set of fingers skim over his thigh, John slid his legs open further to allow more of those light touches, each one sending a tendril of pleasure into his rapture hazed mind. He could already feel the beginnings of an orgasm coil tighter in his belly, every slick slide of his mate's hand bringing him closer.
After Winston finally gets out and opens the boot, hands him his bags, he's off to the house's front porch to settle his bags while he reaches for the spare key on the jam. He soon opens the door and rushes inside.
Mrs. Watson looks over at the boys in surprise.  She didn't know they were... or even could be that close and is amazed at the fact Sherlock gifted her son something so personal to him.
It was interesting to watch how different his moods were depending on who he was talking to. When the fawn turned his attention to John more, nuzzling him affectionately, John flushed with the constant praise. He hummed to clear his throat so he didn't speak with a squeak.
With a soft laugh, John pet the side of the fawn's hip and then moved his hands down to unfasten the button and zip, and then dragged his hands away again, letting his mate take back over. He'd had his fun exploring Fawnlock's body last night, so he was content to let the overeager fawn do the same to him. He imagined it wouldn't be long before Fawnlock would be banishing clothing all together once it got warmer.
"It's not always hugs and kisses, John, most of the year I hate Mycroft's guts, and I make life miserable for him." Sherlock shrugs. He narrows his eyes slightly at John's torch, "Is that a sonic screwdriver?" He asks, a slight quirk to his lips.
The Fae gave a slight nod, nuzzling against John as he recuperated the embrace, arms wrapping around his love.
"Please...come and visit some time. You're always welcome. And it will do him some good. Do you both some good."
"Where are you parked?" He asks, trying to remain as calm as possible. He is both excited and nervous.
John's eyes brightened a bit, (he was steadily getting used to the fawn being able to practically read his  mind, so that alone didn't surprise him.) But he was still skeptical, not wanting to over step the boundaries of what was considered polite. Fawnlock had given him permission though, so John leaned closer, prodding his tongue out over his lower lip in a nervous flick before he reached up with one hand and just barely traced an index finger up along the sloping curve of one of Fawnlock's ears. When he wasn't slapped or hollered at, he grew bolder, rubbing the silky fur towards the inside of the ear, then back towards the tip where the fur was shorter and velvety. "Oh...that's lovely. So soft." John stroked around to the back of the ear now, scratching it gently with his blunt nails.
The adoration sparkled in the depths of his dark blue eyes as he made no attempts to hide it, watching every minute gesture the fawn made with such reverence. Eventually he'd finished his share and just watched the fae nibble at each bite at a far more delicate pace, transfixed by such simple gestures.
"Fawnlock, love...what happened," he asked softly, checking the gashes on his torso to see if they would be needing stitches.
The Fae curled up once more as he started to thumb through the tome he had before. His velvet ears twitched along with the domestic sounds of John's cooking, and the Fae took several appreciative glances at his love's back throughout his work in the kitchen.
John giggles at his best friend's  excitement, asking his own question when Sherlock is done. Soon they are done, the beekeeper leaves and John turns to Sherlock as he's tucking Bilbo back into his bag.
The fawn hummed softly, cuddled up to his mate and enjoying the warmth radiating from John's fingers into his where they intertwined and up his arms and throughout his furred body. "A pendant close to your heart is a wonderful idea, John. I'll send an owl to Moosecroft tomorrow, he can start on your crest soon." The rumbling quieted slightly in his chest, the fawn's ears and tail twitching slightly as he sensed the sky darkening outside and the nearing if the witching hour starting to itch in his veins faintly.
Fawnlock bleated as the kiss ended, his white tuft of a tail swishing with excitement that overran his earlier embarrassment. He leant forward to rub their noses once more, "Yes. Spring, though my antlers will be gone, it'll make dancing easier, along with other things," there was a coy glint in his eyes for a moment before he went on, his ears twitching with his happiness. "It'll give me time to shed my ruff so I can wear my choker and for Moosecroft to fashion you your crest."
John's eyes widen as wide as possible when he is handed his gift, staring at the title of the book, his mouth agape.
John winced when Harry raised her voice and turns pulling Sherlock with him. He walks a bit faster than he normally would, tears spilling over. He hated how much Harry could always affect him, she was always mean if she wanted. Why did she have to be that way?
The younger boy quirks an eyebrow, "Oh, you want to experiment? Well then, the maze can wait." Sherlock scoots closer to his friend, curious eyes glowing slightly with unusual warmth.
John listened to the fawn as he held him, tilting his head up a bit to give him plenty of space to snuffle and scent. He stiffened at the mention of Fawnlock's brother sending potential mates in the forest for the fae. His heart dropped for a moment; they would no doubt be gorgeous and powerful, and able to give the fawn far more than John could offer in his little cottage and ordinary company.
"Thank you again," John says to Greg with a smile, settling at a table with Sherlock, bags on the desk top.
"If a wood is magical like mine, they draw those creatures near... Most woods without a steady flow of magic are the home if creatures that'd rather stay hidden."  Fawnlock popped another berry past his lips. His ears twitched as a chilly breeze nipped at them, he gave a soft sigh. "It's true that it's harder to keep most mystical creatures in line, they don't like listening, especially to someone they'd consider younger than them." He huffed softly. Though Fawnlock was older than John, he still was young in terms of the wood, and it was an understandable hassle to get others to listen.  John opened both eyes and properly gazed up at the fawn. He did look very young to John, even if he was taller. He was much slimmer though, and his face was more innocent. John's own was well worn from sand and wind and worry. Nothing like the peaceful breezes of the wood.
"You're always bored." John replies, finishing the last paragraph of his essay with a neat '.' at the end.
"My room isn't always much better, and Sherlock's can be far worse."  When Greg finally settles down on the tidying, kicking some things beneath his bed, he speaks. "Ah, so did you want to get started or...?"
"I know, I know," he snuffled softly against John's neck, "But he just knows how to irritate me, ever since we were little. I've always really hated it when anyone points out my young age, questions my authority as Prince and Guardian of my wood. Moosecroft always deems it necessary to mention my age and do just that. Belittle me." Fawnlock snuffled once more, burrowing close to his mate, scenting him quietly to calm himself.
"Collected shells, found a dead star fish. I have it at home if you want it." John squeezes Sherlock's hand reminding himself that Sherlock is really there, "How was the rest of you summer?"
"Ah, never mind that... it's okay, we're here." He pulls into his driveway and shifts the car into park, taking the keys out.
The taller boy purses his lips in thought, steepling his fingers by his chin. After a few moments he tilts his head, "I'm not really sure what I should name him." He looks to his friend, "What do you think, John?" Sherlock gives a smile.
"Want to try it by yourself first?" Mycroft looks at the question he'd been working on, the one Sherlock will be starting and moves on to the next one. If there was anyone more proud of Sherlock, other than their mother, Mycroft would take up jogging daily. Thankfully he can say that there is no one of the sort.
"It's healing very well. You must have a very good doctor." He winked at the fae and then dipped a cloth in the warm water, using it to clean the wound and the residue left from the sticky tape. While the fur dried, he readied new gauze and ointment, then applied the bandages to Fawnlock's chest tenderly. He worked very diligently so the wrappings were placed comfortably, then smoothed his hand over his work with a soothing touch. "There we are love. How does it feel this morning? Do you need some more pain medicine?"
"Oh, she'd adore us.. Give you biscuits galore." His ears twitched as he looked at the berries in his cupped hands. After a few moments he spoke, "If you gather a few fern leaves I can weave us a pouch to put these in." He offered quietly, tail flicking.
"John, look, this stone has mica in it." He says, "a real big piece too.." He rubs his thumb against the shiny smooth piece of stone.
"Shall I put him in?" He inspects the cage. It has nice bedding, colorful. A hidey house, water, food and an exercise wheel. There are some tubes for Sirius to run about. John thinks he'll like it.
He slid a dark palm up John's bare golden chest and pushed the jumper up the rest of the way, ridding his mate of the woolen sweater.
The fawn bleated soft at John's words, his hands wrapping around his mate's neck, "Thank you, John" he'd murmured, pressing kisses to John's cheeks and the bridge of his adorable nose.
A set of speckled fingers gripped a hip, while the other hand palmed John through his pants. "John, can I make you feel good, too?" He asked softly, gaze set on John's ocean blue eyes, a small smirk painted on his Cupid bow lips.
He looks to John with a bright smile, squeezing his hand. Sherlock was so happy to have a friend, someone who likes some of the same stuff the little genius did.
"You were always gorgeous...from the very day you were born. Your whole family is beautiful. I would have loved to meet them." John looked shy for a moment, an expression that wasn't often worn on his face, and it showed. "Do you think they would have liked me?"
Tail swishing in slight irritation and ears flicking, the younger Fae lead his mate to the sitting room, taking his hand once more. As they entered, the fawn dragged John to the love seat to cuddle, and to try and calm himself with his mate's scent and presence.
"So what do we have to do? Study for your final exams?" Mycroft's own work is placed on the desk to the right, his study packet for his calculus final.
Fawnlock watched his mate stroke himself as he pleasures the fawn, he whimpered softly, he decide in his lust hazed mind that as soon as he was done, he'd make his mate feel just as good. The fawn eyed John's hard length through the fabric of his pants, he keened.
John was more than happy to adapt completely to his way of life and leave everything else behind. This was the only life he wanted. Save for one thing. But he'd deal with that once their bonding was properly complete.
As he repeated himself, John felt his heart swell, and slid his hands up the fawn's back, rubbing his shoulders and kissing a line up the fawn's neck, over his chin to his lips.
He tripped over something and fell with a thud, he whimpered softly, ears dropping. He pushed to his hands and knees, bleating softly, he could tell he was bleeding heavily and the gate was too far from his den, John was closer, John could help. He pushed back to his feet with a soft bleat of pain.
Fawnlock stretched out in the nest, letting out a few soft bleats and hums as joints popped and cracked blissfully all over before he sat up cross-legged. His gaze swept over their nest, and the rumble sounded low and contented in his chest as he crawled out of the nest in search for the jumper John had given him earlier. The fawn's tail swished as he groped and Fawnlock bleated happily when his speckled digits found the soft knitted material.
John picked up a thick duvet and unrolled it, holding out one end to the fawn, and walking the opposite side across the nest so it was spread out. Kneeling down, he began to tuck the blanket down, smoothing it out. As they worked, John glanced over at the curly haired fae, smiling.
Sherlock huffs, "Don't call me Sherly, or I'll call you Myky..." He pouts slightly before he follows John, striding beside him. Mycroft just rolls his eyes at his brother.
The fawn slid his damp nose along John's shoulder, and into the crease where his mate's shoulder met his torso, burying his nose there. John watched as they fae nosed along the seam of his shoulder where he was currently tucked under, smiling as the faint blush blooming beneath the fur.
The Fae pressed his face to John's neck, huffing softly, "I sent away most of his raptors, but they still might've seen something.... His constant supervision is his way of trying to belittle me and lord over me. Remind me that I and the younger brother and that he's King..."
Sherlock buries his face into his older brother's shirt, he sighs as he pulls back slightly, brows furrow slightly but a small smile quirks his lips.
John's confusion only racked up a few notches as Fawnlock moved to hug him, though obviously nothing was horribly wrong if the fawn was embracing him rather tightly, vibrating at the seams with excitement. As his mate asked his question, to which John nodded in response, then seemed pleased all over again and informed John that he wasn't speaking English, John blinked, trying to concentrate on the words the fae was saying. It sounded like English to John, granted it was English with a thick accent, a little posh and a little proper and crisp, like a foreigner who wasn't quite used to speaking in the language. It was very distracting with Fawnlock rubbing at his stubble though, the rougher skin adding a bit more friction that hand John humming pleasantly.
The fawn nodded and gave a soft happy bleat, leaning forward slightly to nuzzle the human's jaw as a departing gesture. "Goodnight John, stay safe." He bowed his head slightly before reluctantly exiting the house. He padded into the woods, and once under the cover of the woods, he stopped, turning back to watch John close the door. After he was sure the human was secure inside, he stepped out and carefully wove a protection spell to lay on John's cottage. The fawn huffed in satisfaction as a soft glow enveloped the cottage before fading, the spell was intricate and would take a lot to break. Fawnlock watched as a ring of toadstools popped up around the cottage, including John's garden, a sign of his protection. He nodded and started to make his way home.
Sherlock grins softly and tugs on Mycroft's sleeve until his brother crouches to his level. The younger boy presses a quick kiss to his brother's cheek, whispering quietly; "You're the best big brother." He then moves back to the hive with John, excitedly watching the bees.
They were in a sort of limbo, where the world around them slowed and only they existed within it. It was paradise, with the soft sound of that rumbling purr a sweet symphony to John. The soup was still cooking away, so John decided to finish the rest of their conversation.
"Thanks for inviting me over for lunch." He says to the Holmes brothers, climbing into one of the nice wooden chairs.
Sherlock would never admit it to anyone, but he's always striven for his brother's approval and pride, wanting to do just as well as him. Though sometimes he hated his brother, he would always love him.
The fawn took a step closer to the elder Fae, nostrils flaring, "/We both know I never intended to have a mate in the first place, it was up to you to find a mate and sire a littler to continue our family's line. I don't want anyone else, John means too much to me, it disgusts me that you'd even fathom the possibility of making him my concubine!/" Fawnlock spat out the word with a darkened gaze, "/I love John, John means everything to me, I don't care if he'll be gone one day. We both know my days were not long as the lonely Guardian of the Wood of Spirits, it's a dangerous wood with many perils. Along with my tendency to be uncaring for myself, my days were always numbered. Now I have reason, Moosecroft./“
The fawn nodded slowly and ducked under a fallen tree, turning to watch the human. His ears twitched slightly, a small smile tugging his lips, "Yes my home. It may be a tad messy though." He murmured, ears flicking, he pushed some more branches away to reveal the massive oak. Hollowed out and a large flap of soft leather acting as an entrance. The fawn swept the flap aside and ducked inside, then held it for John. He let the leather go, moving to sit on the small nest of leaves, grasses, quilts, and old books that served as his bed. His fingers moved to stroke his scarf, eyes going to the small baubles, tomes, and such he kept about, most in baskets he'd weaved from reeds. "Would you like me to start a fire?" The fawn asked softly, gesturing to the small fire pit by the wall. Ducking under the flap, John stepped into the hollowed tree and straightened up, looking around the inside of the den. He glanced back at the fawn before wandering around to look at the woven baskets  and the bundle of leaves  that made up the nest. He hesitated though, surely it was a faux pas to go poking around what was essentially another person's bed. At the mention of a fire, he smiled and nodded, pulling off his pack and setting it down against the smooth wooden wall.
Greg smiles at Mycroft, leading the younger teen out into the lot with a sweaty palm gently touching the small of his back. He is thankful Mycroft only twitches slightly at the sudden pressure- his touch and that he did NOT move away from him as he guides them along.
The fawn's gaze flicked over his wood as they walked, always on guard, though nothing'd be dumb enough to attack Moosecroft, he was a very powerful King, even his younger brother had to admit.
Was the fawn acting on instinct or tradition? And would he even know, abandoned so young? Maybe he could take Mrs. Hudson aside and ask her about it. He didn't want to commit some faux pas and end up ruining the whole thing. He was quite fond of Fawnlock's kisses and nuzzles.
Sherlock shrugs, Watching his brother write, "I don't know, I'd like to go up a few levels, my lessons are so dull."
The fawn’s padded bare feet were nearly silent on the fallen leaves and twigs of the forest floor. His ears twitched at the crunch, crunch of the human behind him's boots snapping twigs and crushing leaves. Fawnlock's ears flicked and a small smile grew on his lips. He began to hum softly as they went, squeezing John's fingers gently.
John smiled at that, not too devastated over being unable to read fae writing unless it was from Fawnlock's hand. It wasn't as if John wouldn't have a lifetime of being with the fawn.
He arches a brow slightly, surely it can be heard in his voice. He smirks softly, squeezing John's fingers.
The fawn leant into the fingers tangled into his curls, the feeling absolutely heavenly, the rumbling deepened at his mate's offer.
After they were both satisfied, and Fawnlock was warmed to the very core by his mate's words, the fawn bleated softly, burrowing into his mates embrace, careful of his antlers. He panted softly against at the warm skin of John's neck, his tail swishing lazily, ears dropping in exhaustion.
John slid one hand down around Fawnlock's waist, resting it at his hip and keeping his mate close. He could tell by the fae's body language that he was considerably more relaxed, so more than likely things had gone well.
"I see you're setting up the maze..." Mycroft He smiles lightly, he would never admit how happy - yet jealous of his brother he is. So happy and has a friend who loves him dearly.
John settled back against his pack like a make shift back rest and watched as his mate reclaimed his instrument and caressed it lovingly.
"John!" Sherlock calls, waving his friend over, where he is sitting at a small lunch table, an untouched sandwich on front of him and a small novel open in his little hands.
As he pulls away he blushes slightly, then looks around the room, taking it all in. A smile quirks his lips, "I like your room."
"Oh? Excellent, how advanced? Think they'll skip a few levels or just one?" Mycroft tucks Sherlock's work aside and places a blank piece of paper in front of him, he writes out the first question on the paper for Sherlock from his calculus work.
John reached down and set his hand on the fawn's hip, holding him close as he suffered the barrage of adoring kisses with grace. John tilted his head to catch a kiss on his mouth instead, capturing those plush lips against his own with a contented hum.
"Mmmm...then I'll go get them today." He felt the press of Fawnlock's nose and leaned into him, nuzzling slowly as his hands slid down to lay on his mate's thighs, rubbing them gently.
John plays with a different curl, his other hand behind the back of his head. He feels as if he is playing with a puppy almost or a kitten like he had when he visited the farm last year with his parents.
Sherlock grins, turning to spot his brother along with Mrs. Watson and Winston nearby, who he noticed had been allowing them to explore freely with the adults watching them at a distance. He drags John over, practically bouncing with excitement.
He wasn't trying to be rude, or anything, the language was indeed complicated and many words required sounds that humans weren't usually required to use in succession or in the way Fae used them in human languages. The couple continued this activity, the fawn teaching his mate other words too ("/Owl,/ John." Said amongst slightly muffled chuckles).
After a moment or two the fawn pulled away, "John, could you help me with my jumper? Oh, and I think we need to redress my wounds, the bandages pulled a bit last night." Fawnlock pouted slightly, the gauze was still pulling a bit at the moment, he suspected it was starting falling off.
"Mummy, Harry got drunk again and when Sherlock and I took her booze she chased us into the bathroom and screamed at us for twenty minutes and then she left.  She went out."
The fawn arched up into the kiss, a dark hand skimming over John's bare back to cup the back of his neck, speckled fingers brushing the human's sandy locks. The Fae's other hand moved to the human's hip, gripping gently. He bleated against the human's lips, nipping softly at John's bottom lip, ears flicking.
John murmured and hummed beneath the attention, feeling the long, broad ears flick against his collar bone. By now he was well aware of those rolling hips, and he lifted his own up to meet them, slotting their pelvises together perfectly and getting the most out of the sensation.
Once again the fawn lowered his book when John approached, he took the utensil his mate handed him, twirling it in his speckled fingers. He watched John closely, using his piece of toast to do as his mate did, the fawn gave a curious glance at his human before taking a bite of his toast.
"I got dressed? Umm...I didn't shave?" He raised a hand and rubbed at his chin, did he not like stubble?  "What did I do?"
The fawn had never felt the intense need to be close to someone, to share such space and intimacy with anyone, ever. It was all so new to him, yet he seemed to know what he wanted, instinct telling him so, yet still.. Fawnlock barely knew how.
The fawn gave a soft smile as he accepted both into his dark hands, ears flicking and eyes fluttering shut momentarily at the press of lips to his cheek. His smile fell lopsided as he popped the pills past his lips, watching his mate go. His tail swished in distaste as he swallowed to pulls along with a large gulp of tea. He stuck out his tongue momentarily before taking another sip of the sweetened tea, before he settled the cup by his side, outside the nest.
"Your sent is heavenly, John. It smells like home, and makes me know I'll be safe." Fawnlock's eyes fluttered partly closed at the lazy, sweet kiss, he followed John forward slightly eyes opening in time to catch his mate's wonderful smile. The rumble started out strong deep in his chest, the fawn stroked his fingers through John's short sandy strands, a small smile painting his Cupid bow lips.
John tilted his head up as the taller fawn nuzzled down against him. He smiled and chuckled, shaking his head. John didn't look regal, he would always look like a war worn soldier.
The Fae's tail twitched and flicked as his speckled fingertips drew over the spines and sides of the scrolls and books settled before him, humming softly the fawn finally pulled out and mostly empty leather bound journal, he moved to find a graphite stick, rummaging through the baskets hanging on his walls.
Then finally, the coil tightened and then snapped, and the fawn almost sobbed into his release. The fingers in John's hair tightened and tugged slightly, as the fawn's thrusts slowed, the Fae panting softly.
A large grin spread over Sherlock's tiny Cupid's bow lips, "Oh, brilliant!" He takes the lead, moving around the exhibit ecstatically, "A live hive, oh this is fantastic! Look, John!" He pulls his friend beside him to look at the live bees working away, get as close as they possibly can.
"If Moosecroft decides to offer his blessing, he'll come back with me. It's most likely that he'll do this, just for the sake of meeting you, even if he has no intention of blessing our bond." the fawn explained quietly as he bowed his head to make wrapping the scarf around his neck easier for his mate, "He'll ask questions, and decide of I was correct in deeming you worthy to be my mate. Moosecroft'll know somethings from his birds." The Fae gave an irritated huff at the thought of his brother's spies, "He'll judge you, and then offer his blessing. Don't worry if he doesn't though, it may take him time, he's a pretentious git, and he'll try to intimidate you. And even if he didn't wish to bless our bond, it doesn't matter, I'll do all I can to stay with you and protect our bond. As I've said." The fawn explained, leaning forward after John'd finished with his scarf, to rub their noses.
There is a soft knock at the door, Mycroft standing in the door way where he enters after a moment and raises his eyebrows at Sherlock sitting in John's lap, hugging him tightly.
"We just broke it in sooner than later." His smile turned smug and he beamed up at the fawn, then dropped his hands to push them behind him into the blankets and lift him up a bit. "Shall we finish it now? Then I start the soup and we can have a place to cuddle up while it simmers."
"Ooo!" John claps his hands twice at the pretty colors the driftwood is making as it burns. He clutches his and Sherlock's sticks tightly, careful to not drop them. "That's awesome Sherlock! What other types of wood do that?" He asks curious as ever, a huge smile on his face.
The musky scent of arousal was thick on John’s tongue, as well as the faint smell of the bath salts they'd soaked in earlier. John gently lifted the prick and licked the underside, down to the soft bollocks beneath. He drew the soft skin here into his mouth, sucking on it slowly before coming off with a wet pop, and retracing his path back to the glistening tip and drawing it into his mouth, suckling at that as well. Every action was deliberately slow, not wanting to overwhelm his mate with the new experience, despite how eager he was to hear all those needy cries and breathless call of his name.
John was considering, he could use the same wheelbarrow to pile up Fawnlock's books and bring them back to the cabin. He could bring the quilts as well...those paired with the pillows and blankets in the linen closet and he could make a nest in front of the fireplace in the sitting room.
His ears flicked, and he slid his nose up and down the column of John's throat, "I've told you before, I was different back then, my temper was much shorter than it is now. I was very aware of her... Let's say crush, on me, I did not recuperate, she's a smart and interesting Fae, but also very timid, she lacked a certain.. Spark, I craved to find, one you possess."
The Fawn had froze when the human spoke, and his ears dropped as he thought. His flicked as his pale gazed scrutinized the human once more, after a moment or so he nodded to himself. "That would be acceptable, I wouldn't be able to stay long though." He answered, walking over so he was beside John, "I must go before the witching hour," he said softly.
The fawn complied with John's hands and snuggled close as his mate pulled him over John's torso. The Fae snuffled softly into John's neck and rubbed his damp nose against John's warm skin.
"Together we are stronger than your brother, and stronger than this whole world. I'll never stop fighting for you." He reached out to Fawnlock, fingers wriggling in invitation. "Let's go love."
The noises the fawn made sounded something like a purr, though he was nothing like an overgrown cat. No, even with him rubbing against John's hand, he was nothing like an animal. For once, he talked, and for two, those eyes held so much intelligence behind them. With both hands free now, he brought the other one up into Fawnlock's hair as well, stroking up the length of the velvety antlers now and coming back down the rub  at the soft ears. The fawn shivered slightly at the sensation of gentle fingers gliding up his fragile antlers. His antlers had always been sensitive, that's why he'd almost never let anyone touch them, it made him feel undeniably vulnerable, even more so when Moosecroft had touched them when he was younger. Even Mrs. Hudson avoided touching them most days, it required the fawn to have extreme trust in someone for the fawn to let them touch him in general, let alone his sensitive antlers. yet, undeniably, Fawnlock knew he could trust John, and he did, completely. Usually the pace of this development would alarm him, but the brave human had swept his alarm away the moment he invited the fawn into his den.
John pushed at a few pillows, and smoothed out the blankets and duvets, then looked over at Fawnlock, biting his lip for a moment and then standing, holding his hand out to help the fae climb into the nest he'd made.
"I never really got modern art." He sighs softly, pouting a bit. The taller boy looks to his friend skeptically, "How about you, John?"
John watched the fawn consider his words, the look of deep concentration painted over his face. He was tempted to kiss those wrinkles and creases away, but he stayed still, letting his mate make the decision for himself.
"I'm gonna be so lonely!"  John cries out, clutching to Sherlock again as the tears just flood down his cheeks.  He can't stop it, "I don't wanna go! You either!"
The Fae frowned slightly, before he turned to John with a soft smile, "Tea, and then..." his brows furrowed in thought as he tried to find the right word, he muttered softly in his native tongue before his ears flicked up, perking slightly.
As John's hand swept up his antlers the fawn gave a soft gasp, arching his back slightly, toes flexing under the warm water. The Fae leant into John even more so, if he'd known John would have treated him like this in the bath, the fawn would've demanded to be cleaned the night before. It felt lovely, his mate's fingers buried in his raven curls and skimming his curved antlers. His expressive ears flicking against John's sudsy palms as he practically massaged Fawnlock's scalp, and a shiver tripped up the Fae's spine as he gave another bleat.
John smiled at that, it would be lovely for them to have a ceremony. He really didn't have anyone that would come save for Harry. He didn't have many friends after the war, they were still all deployed. And he didn't think he would have inviting them here anyways. These woods, and the fae were something special and wonderful, and John didn't want to do anything to risk either one.
"Come on, My! We're waiting for you! Winston said we can't start it unless you're here!" Sherlock tugs on his brother's arm dragging him off the patio and towards the fire ring, which John's sitting by. He plops down next to John before turning to him, "I got him, now we can start the fire!"
Now that the worry of last night was a distance concern of the past with Fawnlock on the mend, he could focus simply on the thrill of new love once again and how it made every bit of him sing with a warmth that grew in his ribcage and spread down to every limb till he was filled to bursting.
John’s fingers tightened gently in the thick curls, head tilting back lazily against the pillows as the fawn explored his neck and pulled moan after moan from John's lips. His brain and mouth seemed to be treacherous, robbing him of the ability to perform any sort of actual speech in favor of sounds of deep pleasure, buffeted by that wonderful rumble that vibrated every gasp and groan.
"Of course, my love, please do." Sherlock smiles a small smile and opens the book settling it before he starts to read to his mother like she used to him when he was younger and her of better health.
"Let's go Sherly."  He grasps Sherlock's hand tightly and walks out of the room with him so they can gather Sherlock's things for collecting his little things.
The vibrating rumble moved through John to, through his chest and down to the tips of his fingers. He smiled softly with his mate's promises, and believed them with everything he was. Love would keep them together, and surely there would be rows and arguments, and they may butt heads at times (Fawnlock had the advantage there), but it would always come down to them loving each other. Nothing else mattered.
John sat back and watched him kick his feet like a happy child with a treat, feeling the tension seep out of him now that the danger was over. Fawnlock brushed the crumbs from his speckled fingers and licked his lips, tail thumbing against the table.
Awhile later the takeaway delivery rings and John buzzes them in.  As they wait for the delivery man to arrive at the door he gathers the money.
"Coming, My!" He calls as he pulls on a hoodie and then opens his door, giving his older brother a small smile, "Though I already finished most of it during recess." Which was true, Sherlock usually spent their outside time in the library doing homework (or research) or out collecting samples. Today he'd had time for both. He follows his brother into their father's old study, it's where they usually did their schoolwork. Sherlock liked it, he liked the books and despite the fact that their father wasn't the best, he misses him and the study made him feel closer to him. Mycroft sits at the desk and pulls Sherlock into his lap so that he can reach the desk top comfortably. Sherlock's homework placed on the surface to the left.
John sighed with a dreamy look on his face. He adored that fawn, brave and beautiful and strong. He was everything that was good with the world, and he was John's.
He starts sitting up on the rock and suddenly Sherlock remembers his manners, he frowns slightly but knows if Mycroft ever knew he'd be disappointed, "Thank you for your concern," he turns to the boy.
Fawnlock took the tray in his steady hands so John could sit down, the fawn leaning forward to scent the soup, eyes fluttering closed as the warm steam wafted into his face.
Fawnlock smiled and nuzzled into John, careful of his antlers, "Thank you John." He pulled back slightly, ears twitching. His tail thumbed the nest once more as his smile lessened slightly, just a curve of his lips. "And you have me." The fawn gave a nod, nose twitching. He looked back down at their intertwined hands and squeezed the human's fingers gently. It was nice to know he had someone too be there, other than Mrs. Hudson. Truth be told, he could never always be certain of how Moosecroft felt towards him at the time, it irritated the fawn.
Fawnlock's tail swished side to side in excitement as he waited by the door for John to be completely ready. The fawn bleated softly, speckled fingers tangled in the fringe of his scarf, wriggling them a bit as he watched his mate, "Ready?"
John finished his own sandwich as the fawn talked, eyes widening a bit as he made the claim that John would never be boring. He coughed around his mouthful, swallowing the last bite and bringing his hand up over his mouth as he regained his composure. John only ever though of himself as average, ordinary. But here was the most magnificent creature he'd ever met telling him he wasn't boring. "I'll do my best to live up to your expectations." He said with a cheeky smile, brushing his fingers off on the knee of his jeans.
The fawn snuffled softly into John's neck, scenting the heady smell of his mate. His speckled fingers brushed over the soft skin where John's thigh met his groin, murmuring softly in his native tongue. The Fae found a spot on his mate's neck that made John writhe in pleasure, pressing from kisses around the patch of skin before he lapped against it. Fawnlock sucked at John's neck, and nipped lightly till he'd made a mark, the fawn smirked slightly.
Sherlock frowns slightly as he looks at his brother, "John is not precious, Mycroft."  he narrows his eyes slightly before going back to his tea.
John was very reluctant to let Fawnlock down when he was wrapped about the man like a limpet, kissing his nose and generally being irresistibly attractive. But he had promised to do something for his mate and there was no way he would ever go back on his word, even just to spend some extra time snuggled up to the warm fawn.
He nuzzled against John's jaw, pressing warm kisses to his mate's strong jawline, he mumbles softly in his native tongue.
Sherlock smiles brightly, letting go of John's pinky and leaning forward to wrap his arms around John the best he can.
"We really wouldn't even have to do much differently, people already think it of us, but if we were to act the typical way they see them, it might be different."
A shiver ran up the fawn's spine and he gave a soft muffled bleat. Fawnlock pulled away, a soft smile curling his lips. The rumbling continued as his fingers stroked John's cheek, his breathing was a bit short and he leaned forward to nuzzle the human once more. The fawn murmured softly in his native tongue, pressing his lips to John's neck.
John had taken note of the fawn's interest in the books. Being alive that long and knowing about the existence of humans, surely Fawnlock had learned how to read. He wondered if the man would like to take some of the books home with him; if anything it would give John a good excuse for him to return to the cottage. He nodded with the thanks, flashing the fawn a warm smile as he took his own sip. "You're welcome, of course." He was pleased to see that the fawn seemed to enjoy the tea, only further cementing the fact that he was a wonderful creature. He hummed around the edge of his mug, taking another deep swallow and sighing happily as the liquid warmed him from the inside out. "You're welcome to borrow some if you like." John said softly, pointing to the books Fawnlock has been rifling through. He slid the cup into one hand and reached past the fawn, pulling down a thick, leather bound book from the shelf. He stroked his fingers down the cover lovingly, then held it out to Fawnlock. "You can...umm...come and borrow more. Whenever you like. You're welcome here." He flushed quickly, dipping his head down to hide it. "It's part of your woods after all."
Mycroft is standing by the car with Winston, looking sadly after the pair. This is painful for him, but they'll have to go soon if they want to have time to prepare and settle back in at home.
The fawn nuzzled against John and stayed still for a few moments before he wriggled slightly to lay his cheek back atop John's shoulder, turning his head slightly to press a warm kiss to his mate's scar. He leant up into his mate's touches, the rumble sounding softly and vibrating his chest.
John watched with adoration as the fawn worshiped his hands with kisses, those perfect lips moving over knuckle and palm alike, paying homage to the worn, rough digits as if they were any more than just flesh and bone. It was almost sad when it stopped, and his hands were placed back at his sides. It was well worth it however when those dark, beautiful hands slid down to push away his jeans.
John was certainly pleased to make his mate so wonderfully happy, and without much effort on his part apparently. Well, no, that wasn't exactly true. John was pouring all his being into loving Fawnlock, and the effects proved it beyond a doubt. His heart melted to hear such devotion and dedication in his mate's beautiful words. He sighed happily and held the fawn tighter, nuzzling against whatever bit of him he could get to, be it curl or ear or soft cheek. He hoped the fae would always be this happy with him, though surely every relationship would have its bumps along the way.
John reached for his own bowl and copied Fawnlock, breathing in the delicious smell of the soup. He'd have to thank the older fae woman tonight for the recipe-there was plenty still in the pot, he'd save some in the icebox for them to eat tomorrow, and then bring a thermos of it to Mrs. Hudson. For a brief moment he wondering if having Fawnlock bring his brother some would be a nice gesture, but from the way he'd been described, he'd probably turn his nose up at it. With a shrug, John lifted his spoon and tucked into the soup, making a small noise of happiness around his mouthful with the wonderful taste.
Sherlock nods, a smile curling his lips. He starts to take pieces out of the box, organizing them in his own manic manner.
John supposed he'd be tossing out his deodorant than. He didn't wear it much anymore out here, unless he was going out hiking all day. But now he could imagine it'd just offend Fawnlock.
John discovers something wonderful about his bond with Fawnlock, and the pair go in search of Fawnlock's violin.
Mycroft too blushes, knowing what Greg must be thinking due to his silence, thankful for when he breaks said silence with his attempt at tact.
"So please do ask away." The fawn rolled his eyes slightly, with a soft huff and a tail swish, knowing his brother well. Always wanting to know everything about everyone, so nosey with his spying birds. Fawnlock tapped his speckled fingertips at against one another in a soft drum, ears twitching expectantly as he gazed at his brother, lips quirked up slightly on one side. John’s hand still laying reassuringly on the fawn’s knee.
Once John felt the shift of weight as Fawnlock sat on his hips, he steadied his hands on the fae's thighs, rubbing the softly speckled fur there.
Fawnlock nodded slightly, "The gate is a place, but there is a site, where the veil is thin, when we get to it you'll know." The fawn padded through the brush, slow enough for the human to easily keep up. "At the site we must be quiet, whisper only, and be respectful."
As the fawn woke, John's touches became more active, now tracing the curves of his smile, or the wrinkles that formed when he scrunched his dark nose. The fawn looked so thrilled just to see John, and it made the blonde’s heart swell immeasurably as their noses pressed together in an affectionate rub. For some reason, the fae adored his nose, which was snubbish as best, not at the elegant slope of the fawn's own.
As they entered Mrs. Hudson's cottage, the Fae took a deep inhale, scenting the air that was heavy laden with the smell of fresh baked biscuits. The fawn wriggled out of John's hold to practically skip into the kitchen. He made a soft chirping sound, his tail swishing, he moved over to embrace Mrs. Hudson, snuffling softly.
An owl swooped down from the branches and landed on the Fae's outstretched arm, hooting softly. A smile curved the fawn's lips and he raised a hand to brush speckled fingers over the white crest of the owl's chest. John turned and watched as the owl fluttered down to perch upon the fae's arm.
John returned to the side of the nest and saw Fawnlock reaching out to him with needy hands. He chuckled and knelt down beside the fawn, setting down his supplies and taking Fawnlock's hands in his and kissing his wiggly fingers. His heart swelled with adoration for his mate, John was not only wanted, he was needed.
"Oh," the taller boy tilts his head slightly, "Lots of stuff, science, my experiments, puzzles... You, cause I missed you a lot." The younger murmured.
He shifted and stood up with Fawnlock in his arms, letting the fae's feet slip back down to the floor and stretch out to his full height. John tilted up and kissed him, then broke away to find the fore mentioned cloak, which was buried in one of the baskets. He drew the robe of fur and hide around him, it was too long of course, but that just made it a better blanket.
The blond went down immediately into the pile of leaves as Fawnlock pounced on him, his own arms wrapping around the lithe torso of his mate. Johnlaughed and held him close, nuzzling back against him, and rolling in the leaves.
The woods were alive with nightlife, soft songs humming a buzzing energy through the forest. Unlike Fawnlock's woods, this one was entirely in the Fae world, all flora and fauna bursting with magic in such abundance it leaked from the very ground and cast an unearthly glow upon the path.
The rumble strengthened as the fawn leant closer and bowed his head slightly to nuzzle at his mate's jaw.
The Fae hummed softly, his lips twitching up into a smile. He nuzzled at John's neck, "Alright, but just tonight, it might get cold. I have fur, you don't... The nest might not be warm enough... Tomorrow, I'll stay with you in your cottage." He huffed softly against John's skin, damp nose brushing softly. "The hour's close," the fawn peered up at the darkening sky up through the smoke hole. "I wasn't paying attention, I've been distracted.." His gaze moved to meet the human's, he smiled softly and leaned down to kiss across John's jaw.
His damp nose and cheek rubbed against the wool as Fawnlock nuzzled into John's belly, snuffling softly, tail swishing against the bare mattress. The fawn's dark palms and speckled digits explored his mate's wool-clad lower back, the speckled digits tapping out a slow rhythm on a the vertebrae of John's lower spine, like they were ivory keys on a baby grand, a small shy smile curling his Cupid bow lips.
The ancient wood had once been an excluded piece of his father's territory, Moosecroft, his most irritating and oldest brother, had inherited it when their father had passed, and Moosecroft had decided Fawnlock was an unruly and wild Prince of the Fae, and needed some responsibility to calm him, like watching over boring idiotic creatures could entertain him. But yet he was fair and had a more detached fondness towards some of his charges, he wasn't an unbearably horrible Prince, he wasn't cruel, he just kept the wood in check (mostly) to ward of Moosecroft's surprise visits. Besides a quiet wood was great for his thinking.
"And you're gorgeous. Perfect in absolutely every way." John slid his hand down Fawnlock's arm, up his shoulder until it could curl around the nape of his neck, and John could thumb at his dark curls.
"When can we start?" He asks softly after, hand lifting back up to ruffle his hair, a nervous habit.
Fawnlock gave a wicked grin, nipping at John's neck lightly. He huffed softly against John's neck, pressing damp kisses along the golden column of his mate's throat. His tail swished with slight nerves as the fawn keened at John's skilled fingers kneaded the swells of his arse.
He inhaled deeply, nuzzling at John's throat, "You smell delicious," he murmured. The Fae nosed at John, a soft smile painting his lips, after a few moments he pulled back.
"I love stars!" John says excitedly and then blushes, realizing how girly that must have sounded. His sister always teased him for being a bit girly. "I-I really like Mars 'cause it's red and Saturn because of its rings. I know they're not stars but I like space. I might become an astronaut... or a doctor like my mum." John trails off, he didn't want to keep changing the subject. He knew the whole point of Sherlock changing the subject was to make him feel better but then John just had to go screw it up again.
John watched the fawn's reaction to having his tail bone scratched with a smile, and made a mental note to explore that further once they’d gotten the nest arranged to each other's liking.
The Fawn watched John work on his arm, it didn't really surprise him at how gentle the human was being, even putting something on the wound to numb the pain, which it did perfectly. The fawn's head tilted as the human spoke and a small smile curved his lips, "Nothing could scare me away, I'm guardian of the Wood, John." He gave a little huff, but a half-hearted one. Fawnlock watched silently as the human rewrapped his arm, head tilted curiously. "I thrive on danger." His gaze flickered and he stared down at his loose fist on his thigh, tightening it slightly, "Well most of the time that is." He ears dropped slightly as the tiniest flush tinted his cheeks. "I heal quickly, anyway John. You've no real need to worry." His ears flicked slightly and he watched the human for several moments, pale gaze flitting about. The fawn sighed softly as his ears dropped once more, "Usually wargs know better to leave other creatures be if I say so, but the packs have been restless this season. Not many other creatures in the wood would attack a human, they know better." He sighed softly, he would have to go find the warg in the morning, punishing it sufficiently. He didn't like punishing his charges, but the warg could've hurt or killed this wonderful, not so ordinary man, who Fawnlock found he was becoming fond of quickly.
While he watched Fawnlock rummage through the baskets, he tugged the cloak tighter around him. It was very warm, and the fur was soft. And the lining smelled like Fawnlock through and through. John breathed it in with a satisfied hum, then looked back up to his mate as he came close with that sneaky grin. As he pulled free the woodsy crown and placed it on John's head, the blond followed the movement with his eyes, smiling even wider.
"Ah, thank you," Greg gives a shy nod, rubbing the back of his neck. He flushes slightly once again, "uh, sure... It may be a tad bit messy."
"Oh, nice to meet you Mrs. Watson. Thank you, I've done my best in bringing Sherlock up to be a tremendous individual."
"What kind of plant do you think it is John?" He asks softly, looking at the sprout in his friend's hand.
John beamed at the eldest fae, thanking her for teaching him to bake Fawnlock's favorite recipe. It surely would come in handy when the fawn was having a sulk. He said his goodbyes as well, then took the bundle from Fawnlock so they wouldn't all be gobbled down before they reached their home.
Fawnlock leant forward to seal their lips once more, the rumbling sounding deep and loud in his chest. After a few seconds he pulled back, nipping at John's bottom lips, ears flicking lazily and tail swishing playfully.
There were accompanying portraits with the brothers added as well, and separate drawings just like the ones of the family in the earlier pages. Fawnlock's ears dropped slightly, "This was the last set done before Da fell ill," he gently turned to the page with the whole family, tracing the forms of his mummy and Da.
John laughed to himself, finally figuring out what had his nose twinging recently. Not a bit of allergies at all, but rather a tickle of magic that his body was desperately trying to get him to notice the flux of magic. He reached out to Fawnlock and pulled him close, kissing the center of that perfect bow.
Finally, John lifted his eyes again, and stared at the fawn curled before him, trying to bury himself into the blankets in shame.  John leaned over and gently touched His mate's neck, turning his face back up to John. He ran his fingers across the soft ruff, gentle and sure.
"Greg!" Mycroft is shocked to see the rugby player on the other side of his locker. He clears his throat to calm himself down.
Mycroft pulls Sherlock into his lap and cuddles him close.  He would be a liar if he said he had been worried about leaving his baby brother alone like that.  Scared even.
There was always something different in the forest. It didn't settle; it was always changing. The plants, the creatures, and especially the creeks and ponds. They all moved with some otherworldly elegance, a world that didn't care about how the Earth was growing and populated beyond it's borders. It operated with its own set of rules, an ancient order that had been carved within the very core of it in stone and wood. While it seemed to let outsiders come and go as they pleased, there was always something that was left behind, some small bit of its visitors that it would keep in tribute. There was always that ache it left in the visitors heart that in left in return, making them yearn for leaf covered floors and sun spotted canopies.
"Hi Sherlock."  He creeps closer and places a hand on his.  "How was your trip?"  He asks smiling.  He wanted to hug Sherlock, but he is sleepy and he didn't want to disturb him.
John came hurrying back into the sitting room with such urgency that he stumbled into the coffee table, nearly sending his armful of blankets scattering.
"I'll take care of you love...It will sting a bit, but I know you can take it." He leaned down and pressed a kiss to the fawn's mouth, reassuring him, and then pulled out the antiseptic wash and the stitch bonding agent.
Fawnlock's eyes widened slight at John's words, he pulled away and cupped John's face in dusky palms, speckled digits framing his love's face.
After a few moments Fawnlock pulled back, "Now I can teach you proper nest construction." He chuckled softly.
"It's okay, if she bothers us I can just deduce her. I can tell she doesn't like me much though, at least during the summer she didn't." He squeezes his friend's hand, letting him lead him up the stairs.
"I can't wait!" John laces their fingers, innocently unaware of its significance, smiling with Sherlock. Mycroft watches them silent, pretending to be preoccupied with his organizer. They were so wrapped up in each other that he wonders if they realize how much they are the one percent of friends to be so close. So... unconditionally friendly and loving.
"I have a supply of logs out by the tool shed, but I'll need more for the winter. Once you show me where the trees are, I can come back with an axe and cut down a haul. I'll remember each one, and plant seeds in the spring to replace what I took to keep warm."
((I am SOOOO sorry it's taken sooo long. I started college last year, and boy is that an experience, so I've been busy.
"I, uh... is there anything I can do for you?" He asks, blushing faintly at the attention he is suddenly getting.
The fawn had froze momentarily at the hug but quickly recovered, but not in time to return it. Still John'd left a warmth within him. Fawnlock nodded and stood, "Mrs. Hudson, we're going out," he called to the older Fae as he pulled his scarf slightly. He moved to lead John out the cottage door, but not before stopping and taking Mrs. Hudson's hand from where she stood by the kitchen, kissing her knuckles lightly, promising to do his "chores" later. He turned once more, leading John out into the chill. He looked up into the sky and began padding into the woods, "There are many places, there's the gate's site, my den, the berry patches, the stream..." He trailed off as he looked into the distance, ears twitching at the sounds around them. He pulled the scarf up more to frame his neck, "The gate first then..." He quirked a small smile, moving to lead John deeper into the wood.
The human was oblivious, the growl and snapping twigs blending in with the babbling of the river, the Fawn lifted its head slightly hoping the human wouldn't see his imposing crown of antlers but the warg would, this creature's under my guard, do not touch! The warg growled louder, ignoring the threat.
Sure it's hard practically being a parent at the young age of fourteen, but it is something he has to do. Sherlock needs him and if he is supposed to be the one to raise and praise him. Guide him and be there. Then fine. Mycroft will do it. He loves Sherlock with all his heart after all.
Not only was Fawnlock a male, but he was...well, a fawn. John didn't see him in any light other than love, but that didn't mean that was how other people would respond to him. He was so unsure of Harry's reactions since she'd followed in their father's footsteps and taken up drinking.
John would have loved to lay there in the mess they'd made together till they became obnoxiously sticky. But he didn't want to get Fawnlock's wounds dirty, especially when they were still fairly fresh. John was probably pushing it by being intimate while he was hurt, but the Fawn seemed to fair well with the anti-inflammatory pain killers John had given him.
Perhaps it just had to do that it was a part of John, he considered and therefore by extension, another bit of him to love and smother with affection. John hummed as the large dark hand settled over his cheek, staring into the pale eyes that were so bright and intelligent, even as they sluggishly blinked away the last remnants of sleep.
Everything Fawnlock was doing, every nuzzle and pet and soft little kiss was making John glow from the inside out with such happiness and utter adoration. Having this gorgeous creature rubbing and cuddling against him was starting to make John flush with a new heat though. John hummed low and cleared his throat, leaning back a bit so he could look the fawn in the eyes. He wasn't sure if this was just friendly cuddling, or if the fae would even know if it was considering he hadn't had much in the way of friends before. "Fawnlock...," he said softly smoothing his fingers downwards until they slid up along the furled curl of his tail, stroking the soft tuft before moving back up towards his spine. He arched up and smoothly kissed his lips again, then leaned back just a bit, their lips still just barely touching. "Just friends aren't this close...this is the sort of things that lovers and mates do. Is that what you want?"
Sherlock smiled brightly and practically bounced in his seat until he fell asleep against the window. Mycroft carries his baby brother inside the summer house, he is completely out cold.
It was so hard to concentrate on any one thing. The noises Fawnlock was making, the tensing of his muscles and the roll of his hips. Or just the press of the prick against his tongue. It was almost overwhelming to be so surrounded by his mate, but it was magnificent none the less. John had never been so aroused, nor so happy to be able to give his mate this sort of pleasure. He let Fawnlock control the pace with his thrusts, hollowing his cheeks for suction and swirling his tongue to help him along to climax.
"Okay, let me take a look." Mycroft notices how close Greg gets to him but does his best to pay no mind to it trying to hold back his blush.
"Well, I don't like it." He sticks his tongue out. Suddenly a smirk plays across his face, the delinquent part in him coming out. "Let's conduct an experiment."
"It's one of the savanna's most important and interesting big cats." He begins spewing off random facts, glad that his best friend is listening intently even though they are running to the exhibit.
"I'm going to build you a nest now. So I can lay in it with you, and show you how much I love you. I want you to be comfortable." He leaned up and kissed the fawn on his dappled cheek, then stood up, flashing a smile before hurrying upstairs to gather blankets and pillows from his bed, as well as the linen closet.
He honestly did like the way John had done it, but it wasn't very versatile without his human, the fawn carefully gathered some blankets and pillows up to make a sort of backrest. After that he snugged down and started to read, angling himself so he could peer over the edge of his book to see John cook if he so pleased, a small smile curving his Cupid bow lips.
Knowing he'd be cold when he returned, John went and made Fawnlock a cup of tea, stealing a few swigs of it before sweetening it up with sugar and honey as he liked. Then John waited patiently for his lovely mate to return.
"Shall we go then?" He asked, reaching out for Fawnlock's hand and rubbing at his stained fingers with a smile. The fawn smiled softly and took John's hand, nodding. He padded back into the trail and followed them until they had to go off the trail.
Sherlock smiles broadly and pulls John to his feet, "I don't have a lot of friends, John, only you."
John considered this as he watched Fawnlock move away again to examine his baskets. Obviously Fawnlock's family had the higher status, because John didn't have any sort of crest. As his mate returned, John looked at the crest, noting the horns and vines and heart. He stroked the design with a thoughtful hum. Should he wear this crest then? A pin, or maybe a pendant?
John had been teasing about the consort thing of course. It didn't matter what title there was for it, John liked mate. It was more than a boyfriend or a lover. Husband sounded odd to him as well. But mate. That sounded forever. John liked that best
It was sad to hear that the fawn had never loved anything. Someone with so much magic in his life should have felt the magic that came with being in love. Even John had felt the pull of that grand emotion, though it had never really seemed to work in his favor, for there was no one waiting for him when he got back from that hateful war. Still, even love that eventually fizzled and broke was still an amazing thing while it lasted. John was a sentimental romantic. However if the woods were more of a part of the fawn, they had suffered because the fae had not loved himself. That speech was bittersweet, as was the soft smile tipped up at the end of it. Perhaps John was too physical of a person, but every bit of him screamed to reach out to the fawn. So he did just that, arms encircling Fawnlock's shoulders to draw him into an embrace. His cheek pressed to the soft downy fur of Fawnlock's, and John hugged him tight for a brief moment. "Both you and this wood are so special...absolutely priceless treasures. This forest would not be so beautiful if it was not for you." He leaned back and ran his hand across the soft scarf as well, then stood up off the couch and retrieved his pack, tossing it up over his shoulders. "Come Fawnlock...show me some of your favorite places in the wood. I want to see more of your world."
The fawn pouted at his brother, ears flicking back and forth. He was about to speak harshly once more when his mate interrupted, he immediately looked down at his mate as he spoke, givibg him his whole attention, like he deserved.
"Here, let me just-" the older teen scoots his stool closer, so their knees brush... He takes the younger's hand, intertwining their fingers.
For the most part, perhaps due to his looks and war worn frame, it was John who felt the elder of the two, with his steady patience and careful teaching his mate the ways of the world. But there were times when John felt so absolutely young, which compared to Fawnlock, he was beyond any doubt.
((aka smut, if you don't like smut, skip to the last few paragraphs so next chapter doesn't confuse you))
John smiled nervously at the fawn’s assurance; he was a worrier, but then his mate was head strong and practically fearless. He'd been hurt twice before, and one of those was from protecting John. He was a soldier and a doctor, but he felt so helpless when Fawnlock was hurt. He had even control over his nerves to not dissolve into a panic, but that didn't mean he wasn't anxious when he saw the person he loved in pain.
John was quickly coming to understand that Fawnlock was a tad pushy and liked to lead John around, which was well and good with the blond. He was happy to be tugged and pulled, and shown the proper way to do things according to the fae.
'Can't he just make one friend? He didn't make a single friend this year at all...' Mycroft waits by the limousine, not running forward to meet his brother, having been demanded by Sherlock to not do that, as the other kids made fun of him for it. Sherlock quickly slips between his brother and the open limo door, scooting into his normal seat. He slumps against the window and crosses his arms, refusing to speak as per usual after a bad day.
He finished off the berries with a smile, and his gaze wandered to look over the wood with bright eyes. His gaze settled on the human and he gave a soft bleat moving to nuzzle his cheek before pulling away to let him finish with collecting fern leaves.
"I believe you Sherlock... I couldn't imagine you to be that way at all..." John watches the spider disappear into the grass, hiding. "It'll feel better soon," John's hand finds Sherlock's again, needing that reminder again. When you are nine, everything feels like it is forever. "I wont ever hurt you on purpose either, and hopefully never on accident Sherlock."
Mycroft is wearing a full three-piece suit - as usual, he has people to "impress" ((yes even at fourteen-years-old he has to. He is a Holmes after all)).  He smiles at John's mother after she opens the door to greet them.
"How was Mrs. Hudson?" He asked softly, snuggling up against his mate, fingers gently curling against John's jumper.
"We all make mistakes...let our emotions get the better of us sometimes. But that just is obvious proof that we have hearts. And they can hurt." He pressed the faintest of kisses to Fawnlock's lips, letting it linger between them until John lazily pulled back.
"It's not a problem John, you're my best friend, it's my job to defend you." Sherlock's nose scrunches for a moment before he moves and wraps his arms around John.
Fawnlock bleated softly as the human's fingers slid through his curls, warmth tingling where John's fingers touched. The fawn moved his head to nuzzle his nose against John's palm, the rumbling deepening slightly. Suddenly, he jerked his head back, careful of his antlers near John's face, ears flattening against his skull. Mrs. Hudson came bustling back into the room with a tray and a new kettle. "Hullo boys, sorry it took a bit, I had to put those fish into the smoke house." The fawn's ears stayed down as a blush stained his high cheekbones, tail flicking slightly in annoyance.
He took a sip and his ears flicked and his tail thumbed the floor, "Thank you." The Fae made a pleased sound, before humming softly.
"That's really the job of older siblings." John murmured, though he wasn't denying Fawnlock his worry. In no way was his situation with Harry anywhere near the same level, but she'd terrorized him like a big sister only could. He drew his wonderful, lovely mate close and let him snuffle and scent as he saw fit. John wanted his smell all over his mate, wanted there to be no doubt that the fae was John's, and John wanted him.
"Can we just go.. er... watch something maybe?"  He looks up at Sherlock with pleading eyes, wanting him to guide him.
"I'm sorry she doesn't feel well... but I'm glad you're back."  John admits and embraces Sherlock in a hug.
He crawled through the opening, already missing John dearly, a small pout pursing his cupid bow lips. Fawnlock let the flap settle behind him as he padded off down the path. The young Fae made his way quickly to the gate site, finding a spot by the gate to settle and curl up, knees tucked under his chin and lanky arms wrapped around his legs, ears twitching and flicking. Fawnlovck sighed softly, breath huffing out in a frosty cloud, missing his John very much. It'd be a long night until he saw his mate again, the fawn knew.
The rumble started deep in the fawn's chest a John gentle strokes to his sensitive belly, his eyes flickered shut for a moment before they fluttered back open. The Fae settled his palm out over the water, the soft pads just barely being tickled by the water. He sunk a little lower into the water, head tilted to lean into John. He bleated softly, murmuring softly in his own language.
Sherlock pouts slightly before letting his hand drop slowly to the grass, allowing the spider to crawl away, "I don't want to scare it." He murmurs, standing, "Whenever I bring insects, spiders or any other creatures home, Mary throws a fit, she thinks they'll get into her kitchen." He scoffs softly, "So Mycroft makes me release them. Sometimes I think he's afraid I'd hurt them on accident... I really like the different creatures you can find outside," he explains, "I'd never hurt anything though, not on purpose,"
Harry watches the boys stupidly, her drunken brain catching up slowly.  Had that seven-year-old just insulted her? She is pretty sure he did.  When she goes to retort they had already left the room.  She fumes angrily but chooses to take another swig of the liquor in her hand and stumbles to the kitchen.  It is a matter of time before she begins throwing up, drinking on an empty stomach.
Fawnlock had told him that he'd known of John before they met, but John didn't realize he'd known so much about him. Like his nightmares. As the fawn apologized and pulled John close, the blond smoothed his hands back to his mate's shoulders, rubbing them gently.
Fawnlock gazed up at John, a puzzled look in his eyes, his ears flicking as John gently flipped them over, a surprised bleat slipping past his lips.
As Fawnlock spoke his love, the blond hugged his mate tighter, closing his eyes at the overwhelming rush of emotions flooding through him.
John stares at the silly paper kids' menu a moment longer before setting it down. He remembers how little Sherlock eats.
As soon as Fawnlock had opened the gate to Moosecroft's wood, it was as if the elder fae had known of his arrival before the fawn had even made his decision to come.
He took the scarf from his mate and unraveled it, wrapping it around his neck. His fingers worked around the soft knitted cashmere as he listened to Fawnlock, nodding where appropriate. He already was sure he would care for this Moosecroft- he already sounded like an outright git.
'Hope you and Sherlock enjoy the museum! Text me when you are free, wanna plan a date with you. :)' - G
The soft plea made John shiver, and of course he gave into it, stroking the the fawn's pulsing prick with long, shallow pulls of his hand. The fawn whimpered again as he nipped John's shoulder lightly, his chest vibrated with the rumble that signaled all the pleasure his mate was giving him. The Fae's hand tightened on John's hip before letting go to let his speckled fingers brush over John's stomach, desperate for the feel of John bare, almost molded against his body.
Fawnlock bleated in surprise as his mate scooped him up and brought him into what seemed (and smelled) to be John's original nest. He wriggled slightly in the burrito John'd put him in, trying to sit up. He dislodged himself and spread out over the bare mattress, stretching, giving blissful little bleats as his back and spine cracked and popped.
"Excuse me, you're spitting on our faces." He starts calmly, the older boy laughs and shakes him a bit at his interruption before starting his threats once more.
John listened to Fawnlock, slowly nodding with his words as fingers still lazy stroking the side of his mate's neck. It made since of course, John spoke the language like he was a child. That didn't mean he was particularly thrilled to sound like a toddler, lisping and stuttering. "I know you will."
The fawn gave a soft bleat and bowed his head slightly, blushing at John's genuine praise. His ears twitched slightly under the human's fingers, he rubbed his nose against John's in recuperation. "Thank you John, not.. Not many have ever told me such things..." Fawnlock's eyes fluttered closed as he placed a soft kiss to the human's cheek. "John, you yourself genuinely care for and appreciate my wood, anyone who can do so must have a brave and kind heart. I've said it before but, this time I mean it even more so."
"Eleven pounds fifty."  John eyes the man before closing the door and then undoes the chain and hands the twenty-pound note and takes his change and the takeaway bag.
With a woosh! The flames engulf the wood, burning it slowly, "Alright, what first boys?" Winston asks. "We have a quite a selection here. We could also tell ghost stories. I know a few good ones." Winston says proudly.
The Fae tweaked the nubs slightly with a mischievous glint in his eyes, raising a brow at his mate's reaction. After he gave a soft smirk, the fawn continued down John's torso, palms and fingers sweeping over hot skin, his hands stopped again at John's hips, and the fawn leant forward to press kisses across John's collarbones. Fawnlock nipped at his mate's flesh, sliding his mouth down John's chest. The fawn was both unbelievably curious, and a fast learner, and both aspects only seemed to work in John's favor.
The fawn's eyes flicked open as his mate came back into the room, all dressed, the Fae's eyes glowed with excitement. He stood quickly and spoke in his native tongue to his mate, "/John, do you realize what you just did?/" He asked softly.
When the first hint of a stutter passed over Fawnlock's lips, John's eye blinked open again, and he tilted his head back to look at his mate, considering, "Love, you don't have to be sorry for things that happened before we met. I would like to know about her if I'm going to be working with her in the future. But don't think for a second that I will think any less of you for whatever happened."
The fawn frowned at his title, ears flicking with irritation. "I rather dislike that title, Prince, I'd much rather be referred to as the guardian of this wood." He huffed softly, speckled digits tapping on his stomach lightly, "It's not like haven't done anything to earn their respect, it's been little under a millennia that I've protected this wood. I do resent my brother for sticking me here, not as much as before, obviously. But I wouldnt let the wood suffer, no, that'd be cruel. They just don't like me very much. I am hard to get along with." The fawn sighs before sitting back up, moving to stand, "My oak next, then." He held out a dark hand for the human.
"I'll always win..." John teased, mouthing the words against the fae's throat, nuzzling into the thicker fur beneath the cashmere fabric.
John leaned back on his hands and watched Fawnlock flit about the den, tail twitching as he searched for various writing implements. He rather liked the setup of baskets, and considering having the fawn show him how to weave them so they could decorate their home in them. John wanted to remodel the cottage to make his mate even more comfortable there.
The younger boy shrugged slightly after he came back from grabbing his book, "If you'd like, John, I don't mind much." Sherlock tilted his head towards John as he sat next to him.
Mycroft's eyes widen slightly as his cheek is cupped, pink blush deepening into scarlet.  Everything Greg is saying just sounded too good to be true but he seems to be genuine with his words.
"Here we are. We'll have to take the lift up to the eighth floor.. I really hope Harry isn't going to bug us."  John mutters that last bit quieter.
John chuckled and handed over the canteen, tongue darting over his bottom lip as he felt the weight of Fawnlock's hand on his thigh. He sighed softly and reached up to cup the the fae's cheek, rubbing it slowly.
"We won't, there are some ways to protect it.  I can get a canvas bag to cover it.  Keep it warm for the short journey to and from school."  John gives Sherlock a bold smile, looking to the building, they are approaching the stairs.
The fawn practically purred, leaning into John's touch. But at his mate's words, the young Fae murmured something incoherently, crooking a finger under his mate's chin to tilt his face upwards as he pouted slightly, "Yes, I have to go, the gate's call is strong now," Fawnlock leant to rub his nose against John's, ears twitching and flicking. "But I'll be back very soon," he didn't want to part ways with John just yet, he hated being away from John's calming and warm presence.
John chuckled at the demand, more than glad to fulfill it as his mate wanted. He had barely stretched out beside the fawn before he was rolled on top of, arms tangling around him and the cold, wet nose pressing insistently against his throat. His own arms slid carefully around Fawnlock, hands resting on his lower back, rubbing the base of his spine with soothing circles. He was mindful of the bandage, but leaned forwards to nuzzle into the fawn's hair, lips grazing over the curve of a furred ear. Fawnlock arched up slightly into John's hands on his back, his ear flicked as his mate's lips skimmed its edge. He nuzzled into John's neck, damp nose sliding up his throat as he hummed softly,
"Shhh....I've got you." He murmured softly, reached with one hand to curl around the base of the cock, holding it steady as flicked out his tongue and swirled it around the swollen head.
you, I will never hurt you intentionally and I WILL respect your boundaries... Nothing has to happen if you don't want it to... okay?"
Mycroft can't help the relieved feeling from washing over him at her easy acceptance. "Greg... he's lovely, a rugby player."  Mycroft begins telling her about him, feeling a warmth in his chest talking about Greg. He doesn't realize this is the first parent-child relationship of sorts he's experiencing even if it's only slight.
Fawnlock's eyes fluttered closed as he played, clam painted over his features. John tucked his knees up to his chest and listened to Sherlock play, sighing happily. His eyes eventually slipped shut and he let himself float in the smokey warmth of the den, and the melody of the violin playing. The fawn's nose twitched slightly as he finished, settling the violin down in his lap, speckled fingertips tapping along the hollow body.
The fawn finished his rounds, and moved his being to his den to see if John had been their yet. He found his mate still there and a smile graced his Cupid bow lips.
He stepped closer to his brother, moving around him in a slow circle, subtly inhaling the scent of the human that washed over his brother, though it was weak at best. He came back around before his sibling, sniffing with distaste.
"Forty pounds. Adults are ten, children five. Special price because it's before noon." The woman hands over the tickets and has Mycroft sign the receipt.
Fawnlock's ears twitched as he listened, a thoughtful light shining in his silvery eyes. A small smile quirked the corner of his Cupid bow lips, "Fae custom says that to celebrate the seal of a bond, there's also a ceremony, were one mate offers the other their family crest, usually engraved on a piece of jewelry, a ring or pendant perhaps. Once the other accepts, the families celebrate with gifts to the new mates, and foods, there is also dancing and music as well."
"Thank you, My." Sherlock turns to stare out the window at the rolling landscape, a small smile playing on his lips.
Sherlock snickers softly as John describes his family's car, "Come on, John!" He pulls John into the lift, letting him hold the door for Mycroft and Mrs. Watson.
He blushes softly, "It's my duty, I couldn't not do what I do. But thank you." He leans forward to press his lips to John's forehead. He leaned back and finished another Tim Tam, smiling softly as he gently kicked his feet, careful not to hit John.
Moosecroft followed his brother into his new home, looking around the dwelling at the curious decorations and furniture. The nest at least, he recognized.
John nods and fiddles with the object. He wished he had Sherlock's brother. So what if it wasn't always good? His relationship with Harry was never good.
Fawnlock's promises made John so utterly happy it felt like he'd swallowed a miniature sun. His non messy hand still slid through the fawn's hair, stroking the tangle of curls soothingly as his mate's breathing calmed and his heartbeat slowed back to normal. He didn't mind as Fawnlock smeared their combined release across his chest and shoulder, they were already plenty messy and the fae was probably more than pleased to have John smell more like him anyways.
There was no doubt they were mates now, they had each other's scents all over their skin. Eyes raising to those captivating silver orbs, John's own dark blue gaze reflected all the live and adoration he felt, completely swept away with the fawn in a romance he'd never thought he'd ever be able to experience. His opposite hand slipped down to Fawnlock's hip, tracing lazy circles in the sticky, matted fur. Every kiss made him happier than the last, no matter how small or fleeting.
The younger nods in agreement, smiling softly, "I'm glad too, John." Sherlock leans against John's shoulder lightly.
After two days, John was sure he was starting to smell ripe with only washing his face in the creek. The fawn seemed to have no complaints of his smell at least, so he didn't let that matter bother him too much.
Fawnlock sat up and tugged his feet under his furry bum, smiling softly at his mate. "Thank you John," His dark nose twitched slightly as he took the mug into his dark palms.
The Fae tugged his scarf up over his chin, huffing quietly as he padded back to his oak. He cleared some snow from the leather flap with dark palms before ducking under. As he entered he shook his head to dispatch any flakes, leaves or burs that had tangled into his curls. He gave a soft bleat as he saw John, a small smile curving his lips. "Evening." He moved to the fire to warm his hands. "Have you been warm enough?" He asked softly.
When his brother commented on how lovely the wood had gotten, and that Fawnlock was doing a wonderful job keeping it, the young Fae had to take a sharp inhale, and regard his brother to check for honesty, the fawn had to blink several times, his brother has complimented him. That was a very rare occurrence indeed.
"Wonderful." Mrs. Holmes seems to have brightened up quite a bit now. She had been seriously worried about Sherlock, he hadn't been making friends and was showing serious signs of becoming extremely antisocial.
"What?"  Harry slurs. the fourteen-year-old stumbling back into the foyer.  "You brought your little boyfriend home! How cute! Don't do anything dirty."  She teases, not sounding very friendly in the least, her words drowned in liquor.
Reaching out to help the fawn onto his feet, he first stepped over into the tub himself, then held Fawnlock's hands steady and he guided his mate into the bath afterwards. Sliding down into the water and leaning back against the porcelain edge, John coaxed the fawn to slip down in after him and lean back against John so they could soak together.
The fawn flipped open the journal to a blank page and wrote John's name neatly and clearly in his graceful scrawl, he turned the book into his mate's hands and handed him the graphite stock, smiling brightly as his ears twitched. "Here."
A whimper escaped the fawn's lips as a wetness swept over his navel, and then John nuzzled at the curls at his abdomen and the fawn couldn't help but moan softly. A dusky palm settled on the back of John's neck, speckled fingertips curling slightly into his mate's sandy hair, he tilted his head in slight question before he spread his legs for John to settle more comfortably between.
Fawnlock smiled softly at John's words, ears twitching, he completely believed the human when he promised such things. He knew deep down that John wouldn't let anything part the pair if he could, things may happen in the future, but John would always try and do his best for the fawn.
A smile soon painted his Cupid bow lips, as he leant down to press soft kisses over John's face, "You should always play fair when romping, John, or else I'm allowed to play dirty as well." The Fae chuckled softly as he pressed a kiss to John's nose, "Would you like me to play dirty, John."
The fawn's damp lips trailed up his mate's delicious neck to meet his lips with John's. His ears flicked curiously, his unsoiled hand moving to stroke over his lover's shoulder. He broke the kiss to nuzzle at John's heated flesh, murmuring softly in his native tongue, weaving the words as his slightly damp nose trailed up the side of Johns's face to rub at the soft skin under his love's ear.
Cuddles seemed to be the cure all for his night terrors, and he received no short supply from his mate. His dreams were no longer of blood drenched war, but rather of the happy life he'd found with the fawn. It felt good to be accepted by Fawnlock's family, as if that was the final stitch needed to make this all wonderfully official. And he supposed it was. The weight of that was not lost in his dreams.
The fawn smiled into their connected lips and pressed forward to intensify the kiss a bit before he pulled away with a soft smirk, his head tilting to the side as he considered John's explanation of his dream.
"/How about Mousey Hopper? Though she's not a healer per se, she's more than familiar with the healing arts, Moosecroft./" He offered.
The older Fae opened the door after a few seconds. A smile graced her lips and a twinkle shined in her eye, "You must be Fawnlock's human, come in, come in." She gestured the human inside. The Fae looked like any other elderly woman would, save the downy feathers that blended into her short greying hair and dotted around her eyes, down her arms, neck, and hands. Though she did seem to posses eyes that looked a bit owlish. She wore an old fashioned long sleeved, high necked violet dress. She patted her hair as the human entered and shut the door behind him, "Let me light a few candles, I snuffed them when my dear fawn left this morning. Make yourself at home dear, I'll be back in a tic." She scurried off and began to light several candles scattered about, lighting the dim cottage a tad more brightly. She came back in front of the human and smiled, "There we go, now, I'm Mrs. Hudson. It's lovely to finally meet you, sorry about the lightning but I prefer the dark, you see." She chuckled softly.
The fawn's ears twitched slightly, "Everyone?" He murmured almost silently, tail thumbing once more. His head tilted and his ears flicked down slightly in thought, "Nothing's ever really easy anyway, that's why I never really tried looking for friends or a mate.. There was no point." Fawnlock gave a slight shrug, hands gently squeezing the human's shoulders lightly. He leaned forward slightly, moving so his nose just barely brushed John's. "But it seems I didn't even need to look very hard either way and I was wrong.. There is a point." The corner of the fawn's lips lifted slightly in a smile.
"I'm sure they'll soon start with me, you're not alone anymore," he reaches out to squeeze John's shoulder, giving him his Sherlockian smirk.
Fawnlock's ears flicked back and forth as he laid down in the nest. He wriggled a bit to get comfy, burrowing his back into the warm nest. The fawn snuffled softly as he wriggled to the side John usually slept on, taking in his comforting scent. He groped for his scarf and soon found it amongst the soft blankets of the nest, he took it and smoothed the knitted material over his tummy, running his fingers over it for a moment or two.
The fawn pushed off from the counter he was leaning against, brushing crumbs off his scarf. He moved forward to nuzzle the elder Fae's cheek as a departing gesture before moving to his brother's side. Mrs. Hudson was immediately in action after the fawn's goodbye, moving to spit the platter of biscuits evenly and wrapping each portion in a bit of cloth.
The Fae cleared his throat quietly, "I-I said, my kind warrior..." He stuttered slightly as he repeated the words in his native tongue more clearly for the human to hear, his ears still lowered as his tail swished. John could feel the fawn twitch, but the flushed heat of his skin beneath John's fingertips proved he was caught between irritation and embarrassment.
"/Moosecroft, dear, hullo, it's your favorite as well,/" She looked over to John with a mischievous look, "They can almost never agree, but they can agree on their favorite kind of biscuit," she moved forward, taking the plate of biscuits with her (to Fawnlock's dismay), holding them out for the bull.
John chuckled softly at the thought of the Fawnlock sulking and the flowers and trees drooping along with him. However, when he remembered their conversation last night, he realized that Fawnlock must have sulked because he felt so lonely. John felt a tug at his heart for the fawn, a wonderful Prince of the wood, and yet he had no one to share himself with. When the door opened and the sounds of the fawn padding inside were heard, John stood quickly, a grin spreading over his face. He watched the interaction between the two Fae, though his eyes focused more on Fawnlock, eyes roaming up and down as if confirming that he was really there and just the same. When they finally broke away and he came over beside John, the man's smile grew wider, tongue darting out between his lips anxiously before he spoke. "Hello Fawnlock. It's good to see you again." He reached up to chuck his fist under the fawn's chin, then remembered Mrs. Hudson's comment about him being a Prince, and dropped his hands, palms slapped against his thighs as he bowed, movements sharp and precise like only a military man's would be.
John was chewing furiously on his bottom lip as well, trying to bite back moans and cries to hear more of the desperate whimpering and pants of his mate, every disjointed word and call of John's name like music only meant for the blond, a symphony that made his heart and body sing with such love he was sure he would burst. Finally he realized holding anything back was selfish, and he whispered the fawn's name with such revelation, nuzzling any bit of fur or skin he could touch.
"Hello John, Sherlock." He turns to Greg nervously, but keeps his cool, "hello, they aren't bothering you, are they?" He is being polite, knowing most teenagers do not like the small children.
Then, in a soft voice, he spoke, "My maman taught me the proper ways and techniques to construct nests when I was young. Usually it's the females who are in charge of the maintenance of the nest, but I've always been very good at it. I've kept it to myself for the most part, but Mrs. Hudson knows. Nest building... Calms me, I guess is the right way to put it." He flashed John a  soft smile, then moved over the best to snuggle against his mate briefly and press a soft kiss to his shoulder, the rumble starting low in his chest.
John smiled warmly, his heart swelling till it felt as if it would burst from his chest. It was only the barrage of kisses across his face that kept him from simply exploding. He leaned into the touch of Fawnlock's hand, humming softly.
John swished his fingers through the water to check the temperature, then looked over as Fawnlock settled beside him. He smiled back, reaching over and stroking his thumb down over a velvety ear.
Fawnlock’s tail swished as he leaned into John, minding his antlers. His ears flicked as he moved to carefully pepper kisses across John's shoulder, just then noticing the wound there. His eyes widened slightly, ears flicking, he had known John had been wounded in his people's war, but this, other than the man's not so frequent anymore nightmares, was the first sign the fawn had of his human's past.
The caress of Fawnlock's hands down his neck and shoulders had the same effect on John as a touch to the ears and antler did the fae. He closed his eyes and shivered, listening to the fawn speak. Just as he thought...they was much more meaning to being mates than what humans considered a lover to be. It was what a lover /should/ be, but humans had perverted it over the years. That wasn't who John was, and there was no reason to bring sad facts like that to the forefront. "There are people who spend their whole lives looking for a mate as well. It's not always easy...but it's well worth it. Love is the most precious thing you can have in this world. Everyone deserves to find it."
The fawn cupped his hands for John to put more berries in, "Mrs. Hudson says these berries make excellent the jam she uses in some of her biscuits." He murmured. He popped another berry into his mouth and gave a soft bleat.
"Oi, why don't you put down the kid half your size?!" The high school student raises a brow, the bully's eyes widen slightly in anger and he drops Sherlock, who ooffs softly on the pavement, rubbing his bum, John rushing to his side. The older boy grabs the back of the neck of the bully's jacket, pulling him away from the two boys, "Get! Go before I change my mind about not punching the bloody prick who threatens kids half his size!" The bully runs off once he is free, sprinting out of there like his hair is on fire.
John could feel the timid press of Fawnlock's tongue against his and knew it was a new experience for the fawn, who'd only just learned what kissing was days before. But if anything, he was a quick learner, and the kiss was better than he could have ever imagined.
John distractedly pet Fawnlock's curls as he too caught scent of the heated soup, and gently dislodged himself from the tangle of the fawn's limbs to retrieve the thermos out of the coals by rolling it out with a spoon from his pack.
Mycroft leans into the chaste kiss, hand covering Greg's as it lasts longer than most first kisses do. When they pull away his eyes flutter open, he didn't even know he closed them
Fawnlock began to speak once more, gaze going back to lock with his brother's, "I didn't want her to leave either, but she kept distracting me when I was performing important experiments, Moosecroft, I almost burnt down my wood because of her." He grumbled softly, pulling John closer.
Soon they're at the museum and the youngest Holmes pretty much drags Mycroft and John across the car lot after they all hop out of the car and makes sure they're ready for such treatment.
"Alright Sherly. I won't be long." Mycroft smiles after his brother and turns back to his work. Quickly the study packet is complete and Mycroft is relieved. Work is done and it is 4:15.
"Maybe we should find somewhere else eat lunch, if it isn't raining I mean." John looks out side, typical for London it is currently raining. "Did you want to come over, it'll just be me and my sister and we're getting Chinese take away. We can work on our science project together."
Strong fingers kneaded against the fae's arse, pushing him down closer against John. John’s thumbs swept up under the fluffy tail, rubbing gentle circles.
"You too Moosecroft." King or not, John preferred to lapse back into the casual. After all, he was essentially John's brother now as well.
The Fae tightened their intertwined hold on their pricks slightly, whimpering as the human slotted their legs together, bringing the pair even closer. After a few moments, Fawnlock pulled away from the kiss, panting, touching his forehead to John's. The fawn gave a loud sharp bleat, his release fast approaching, his damp nose rubbed against John's cheek. He completely trusted John in this moment of vulnerability and intense ecstasy, muttering his mate's name like a soft breathless mantra.
John was very guilty of having a lay in, that much was true. He was usually an early riser, learned from his military days, but a good night's sleep had made him reluctant to climb out of his bed. He would have loved to go roaming through the woods with the smell of fresh morning dew in the air. He smiled sheepishly with a roll of his shoulders. How did the fawn know he'd slept in? The fae was so very observant, it was probably evident in the tussle of John's hair. "I did sleep in, yes. I just felt too happy and relaxed to get out of bed. That's rare for me. I pretty much just straightened up and packed for an afternoon hike." He picked up his tea again and swallowed a mouthful, watched the flicks of the fawn's ears. He had such a strong urge to touch them, as well as those curving antlers. But that wasn't something you really did with a friend, ask them to hold still while you groped at their head.
A small smile quirked the fawn's lips as he turned slightly to regard his mate, "I love you, John."  He responded in kind, tail flicking as he sought out his scarf and put it on before turning and gently opening the leather flap.
The fawn bleated softly at John's touch, tail swishing in pleasant contentment as he leaned over his mate.
"The museum we're going to had just gotten a new exhibit on bees!" Explain Sherlock excitedly, "It's that brilliant!"
Sherlock pouts as he pulls a notebook out of his pack, then a paperback novel, and a pen. He settles everything on his desk as he stares at the teacher, immediately deeming him annoying and useless, opening the paperback on his lap, peering at it steadily. He already read the text for the subject the teacher was prattling about, he didn't need to listen. Lips pursed, he continues reading throughout the time allotted for the one subject and even when the teacher announces that it was time for a break, and reminded everyone who needed to use the loo or get a drink to sign out and wait their turn fairly.
Mycroft flushes bright tomato red at his brother's comment. "Y-yes......... He asked me out the other day." The ginger looks down at his lap, embarrassed, staring at Greg's text, it was simple but sweet.
"Thank you, My." Sherlock chuckles and scrubs his face with the washcloth, being careful with his bruise, wringing it out afterward in the sink and hanging it to dry. He looks in the mirror at his brother, then himself with a small smile as he fixes his hair so it's not going to stick to his drying face.
"Why not," Mycroft sits on the floor beside the maze and looks to Sherlock, "you don't mind, do you baby brother?"
Once his love was settled, the fawn brought both his hands down to John's pants, fingers hooking in the waistband and pulling the fabric down John's thighs and calves, over his feet, there they lay discarded as Fawnlock climbs back up John's body.
The river was several feet wide, but not overly deep, creating a poor barrier between them that wouldn't take long to cross. Quickly, his options ran through his head; he had nothing to attack it with or scare it off, and running would only prompt the beast to run. So his best bet was to slowly back up, taking sure steps to guarantee he wouldn't stumble. Gaze steady on the creature across the river, John knew at least not to meet its eyes, least that be viewed as a challenge. His heart thudded in his chest. This wasn't the way he wanted to go at all. As an almost after thought, he noticed his tremor was gone, as well as his limp. How ironic. Maybe he could get to a tree and climb it before the animal caught up to him. John swallowed thickly, readying himself to run towards one of the oaks.
Sherlock examines John quietly with quick and narrowed eyes, "Your sibling is gay, and you were bullied for it in school." He shakes his head slightly, "You shouldn't listen to them, they're idiots. It'll be better after you move, I suppose," He adds before morning on to the next pool and waving John over.
Fawnlock leant forward to press a soft kiss to John's lips, "I love you too, John, with all my heart. I'll do it, I'll make him know what you mean to me."
The fawn smiled softly and nibbled on the biscuits John gave him. His ears flicked as the sounds of his bare padded feet and John's boots padding through the frost stiff grass echoed through the clearing, though admittedly John was making more noise than the lithe fawn.
"Doesn't that make the chicken a flawed creature? They are closely related- if not directly." John gives that tidbit of information as he drags his friend around the skeleton.
He drags John into what is obviously the kitchen, moving to shut the door after them, "John, we should get the bottle away from her, is there any more liquor in the flat?" He asks, "we can flush it after we get the bottle she has."
John's gaze flicked upwards, following the curve and point of the antlers in awe, then back down to the large ears the flanked the sides of his face, buried under thick curls. He was so tempted to touch them, but that was out of the question between two strangers. Instead, he just cleared his throat and reached into the kit for some more gauze to wrap the wound. The fur beneath his fingers was short, yet velvety soft. "I'm a creature of the wood then?" He asked curiously, not missing the implication. He gave a soft hum of amusement, though he felt a warmth bloom in his heart at the thought that these wonderful, beautiful woods had accepted him as one of their own. Tying off the bandage, he reluctantly let go of the arm, but there was no honest reason for him to keep hold of it any longer. "I'm John...John Watson."
The moment break is announced, John had to stay sitting for a moment, to collect himself. Finally, he gets up, dressed in his khakis and polo shirt, sneaking up behind his younger friend.
John glanced up as he felt the hand curl around the back of his neck, flashing the fawn a smile before he returned to the body before him. His hands moved to Fawnlock's slim thighs, gently pushing them apart to give him better access.
After a while John too began to wake, and the fawn felt a wave of happiness surge through him as John's eyelids began to flutter, he leant up to press a series of sweet kisses to his human's face, the soft rumble sounding deep in his chest. "Good morning John, are you hungry?"
"Don't you worry about a thing. I'm right here with you." He leaned up and kissed Fawnlock's ear, feeling it twitch against his cheek.
Sherlock groggily rubs his eyes, "Ah, good evening, Mrs. Watson." He yawns softly, before leaning his head back on John's shoulder.
It was unfair really, but last night they had reached out to each other. It was the start of something, even if it was an incredibly small step.
"Er... right."  John continues clinging until they get to the kitchen, finds the phone and dials his mother's work number from memory. The phone rings and the office answers, he asks for his mother and they page her.  It is a few more minutes before he recognizes his mother's voice.
The fawn huffed softly, "/I don't get hurt that often, brother./" He grumbled, though it was true the fawn was often careless, and got into tight places and situations that caused the young Fae to acquire many bruises and scrapes over the years.
He tilted his head to the side in thought, ears twitching slightly, "Though once Moosecroft brought me to a hot spring when I was younger. It was nice."
Sherlock snickers softly, "It's okay, Myc, I approve," he gives a small smirk, "but I will beat him up terribly if he harms you." He says dead serious.
"You're smart, brilliant, so very handsome. Some days I walk down the hall and spot you and it would hurt not to be able to run up to you or trace your freckles."
The soft rumble in Fawnlock's chest grew stronger, even if the fawn's eyes flicked away from John in slight embarrassment, staring down at his dusky palms and speckled fingers buried in John's sunshine hair, the blush darkening over his cheeks and visible through the lighter bits off fur over his upper body.
John for once, didn't have nightmares, and slept throughout the night. When he finally woke, it was well into the morning, and he stared up at his ceiling with a dreamy smile, remembering last night with fondness. He was quite sure it hadn't been an hallucination, and if it had been, then he was glad to finally be going crazy Finally, he dragged himself out of bed and off to the loo to take a shower and then dress for the day. He pulled on another flannel and jumper, finding them the best for fighting off the chill of the forest. Once downstairs, he changed the supplies in his pack for fresh ones, then made a light breakfast of porridge with an egg, and toast with jam. As he made tea to drink with his meal, he remembered how much Fawnlock had liked the drink, and made some more to put in his thermos and bring along for the fawn. Once he'd finished and washed the dishes, it was half past 11, and he grabbed his pack and headed outside in search of the owls. Pausing, he noticed the circle of toadstools and knelt down to poke them, which of course made him sneeze again. He rubbed his nose with his sleeve and stepped over them carefully, spotting a white barn owl sitting high in the branches and following it as it flew off, making sure to take note of the direction so he'd remember it in the future.
The Fawn spent the rest of the morning gathering berries, fruits, and catching fish, gathering it all in a basket, for Mrs, Hudson, the older Fae always asked him to do so every once in awhile, since she didn't go outside during the day. He huffed softly before noticing the position of the sun in the sky, thinking he should start back, the fawn padded back into the woods from the small wild orchard he'd cultivated long ago. The Fawn obviously knew the way by heart, but still the owls still escorted him, one even flew down to land on his arm when he'd held it out. He caressed a finger over its downy feathers, the owls had always been the most accepting of him, most likely because of Mrs. Hudson, but honestly the fawn didn't mind. He let the owl flutter off, and continued, eager to see John. Fawnlock could already smell the pie and sweets that the older Fae baked frequently, giving a happy bleat, the fawn moved faster through the forest, though he doubted he'd get there before John, who'd probably have left earlier than he.
Mycroft Holmes, age fourteen, nearly six foot tall, a bit chubby but he loves his sweets, can you blame him? He is dressed in his school uniform, dress pants, blazer and tie with a white dress shirt. His ginger hair combed back. He waits outside the limousine for his baby brother, Sherlock, age seven, a little over four feet tall and has the wildest head of dark brown curls to ever born to a child.
As he moaned into John's mouth, the man returned the sound with his own thick groan, already keyed up to the point he felt as if his skin might split.
"And I have no plans of making regular visits to Moosecroft's wood. He may know more about Fae mating customs, though, he explained when I was younger and maturing, but I didn't pay much attention. Never thought I'd find someone I wanted to spend the rest of my time with." He murmured softly, ears twitching, tail flicking and swishing a bit.
"I'll be fine. I'll be here when you get back." He pressed their noses together for one last nuzzle and then turned Fawnlock around and gave his pert bottom a little pat, urging him towards the leather flap that covered the entrance to the den.
The Fae brought up his arms in a gentle hug around John, his chest practically vibrating with his soft rumbles. "I love you too, John." The fawn murmured softly.
Fawnlock gave a soft bleat, nosing at John's jaw, huffing softly against damp skin. The Fae's specked fingers kneaded at his mate's erection for a few more seconds before he gently pushed John over so he was flat on his back.
He could feel the stress and worry melt out of both of them now that they were cuddling in the nest together, nosing at each other in silent affirmation that they loved each other. He hummed with the kiss, arching up a bit to bare more of his neck to Fawnlock, complete submission and trust in the gesture. He listened to the fae speak, eyes fluttering closed as those sweet words washed over him accompanied with the rumble, pushed him towards absolute bliss.
The elder Fae stood on her own doorstep, the large white owl perched on her arm, her nose nuzzled against its downy crest. The Fae murmured softly to the owl in hushed tones in the Fae language before her gaze snapped to the couple entering the clearing.
Greg looks up in time to catch Mycroft's gaze, and he smiles softly. The rugby player pushes back from his locker, shutting his locker door. He follows up and hides behind Mycroft's now open locker, hiding slightly behind his door.
John giggles and nods to Sherlock. He remembered Sherlock had figured it out rather quickly. "I remember, they were really smiley with each other."
"Two please," Mycroft answers and smiles as his tea is served, taking it when finished. "Thank you." Mycroft watches his baby brother and his mother chat lightly, knowing Sherlock needs this.
Mycroft is in his own bathroom, washing his hand with a proud smile on his face. He knew Sherlock could make a friend if He tried hard enough,
"Did you bring Bilbo for that? He should see some live bees in action," He whispers to Sherlock as the lift goes down.
Fawnlock's ears twitched slightly as his nose scrunched, "Moosecroft lives in his own wood, it's much larger than mine," he bows his head slightly and sips at his tea, "He does look like me, but his antlers are bigger, much like a moose's. He has dark ginger hair, not raven black like me, and his patterning isn't as complex as mine, he has freckles, a lot of then. He often uses his glamour to make himself look human, so he has more connections than I do in the human world." The fawn huffed slightly as he took another biscuit, "I can do the same I just don't bend in with humans as well as he does. He's rather dull, in my opinion..." He shruged slightly with sigh and nibbled on his biscuit. His ears flicked, "The birds are his spies, so careful, but there are very few in the wood." The fawn sipped more tea.
"Want to share fish and chips?" John asks with a soft smile, proud he remembered this about his best friend. Friend's are supposed to know and remember things like that- especially about their best friends!
"That would be nice, we could go to the cafe next to the museum. There is a surprising variety there to choose from!"  Mycroft offers a smile.
Neither of the boys notices the older boy walking several paces behind them. A wicked smile on his face. He is a few years older than the two and he sees them in the cafeteria from time to time and he always has the desire to approach and pick them apart. He usually has bigger fish to fry but looks like his schedule just opened up.
Mycroft stares at Greg, shocked at the question but recovers quickly when he sees that Greg begins to lose confidence in himself due to his lack of response.
"I have to... if they ever get home... usually it’s just me and Harry - mum has plenty of emergencies at work. Dad travels for work... Never home really. Not often at least when I need them." He sighs and puts his brave face on. They need to get that other bottle.
He looks around after shouldering his satchel's strap and picking up his sneakers, "You came from that direction, right?" He asks, nodding in the direction he assumes John came from.
"Thank you,"  John says in return clutching to his best friend, arms tight around him.  "You can come over any time."
His gaze bored into his brother, "/John deserves more than being a lowly whore to a Prince, he deserves this, a permanent bond between us, we've already become closer than I've ever been with anyone. I want to be with him./"
Her eyes brightened slightly as she remembered something, "Oh, I have something for you, dear." She held up a finger and disappeared into the depths of her cottage to return with a folded jumper, the exact color and shade of John's eyes. "This is for you, dear, I know you've probably got loads, but with the winter coming you may be needing something warmer to wear. I'm sure Fawnlock's told you about the quilts, he'd never let me give him any sweaters." She sighed softly, before handing John the jumper and continuing, "Now, you better be off! Don't want that fawn to miss you too much." She chuckled, smoothing her feathers before she lead John back to the door, "Just make sure you two visit, as soon as the dear's better." She smiled warmly.
Fawnlock gathered the books and scrolls into his tawny arms, then pushed up off the nest and padded to his empty pack, slipping the reading materials inside. He moved back, flopping onto the nest, a few scrolls still in his hands. Fawnlock sat up and tucked against John's side, dumping the scrolls into John's lap, rumbling softly with contentment as his ears twitched on curiosity.
John looks at the plant, tilting his head to the side.  The sprout is a deep green, lightening at the tips.  It hasn't shown any sign of what it may be, other than a plant.
"It's lovely. You're brilliant." John took the pouch and a kiss as well before standing and beginning to pick berries to fill it, humming happily.
The fawn's eyes followed John as he stood and moved to the cellar, he tilted his head back slightly as his mate reemerged. He scented the air, sniffing softly, there was an odd scent, one that resembled John's, but was different somehow, and a bit stale. Fawnlock crackled a grin as John handed him the bunched up sleeping bag that the scent came from, the fawn bleated softly. His tail swishing and brushing his feet from where he'd tucked them under his bum.
As Fawnlock wandered off to sort through the shelves, John collected the mugs and thermos, setting them back in his pack so he wouldn't forget them. He wasn't sure how long they were going to stay here, though John frankly had no problem spending the night. It was closer to the gate, so made things easier for his mate.
Congrats Mycroft on your first relationship, kiss and having the courage to move forward. Go you Greg for not being a piece of shit jock and went for it! I'm sure you will both be very happy together ^_^
"Yeah," John pulls his eyes away from the experiments and to his rainbow eyed friend, "Tell me about this tree we can climb? "
"There," the fawn kissed the human's cheek before he stood back up to shake himself, water droplets flinging off his fur.  "We best get going." He murmured, ears twitching as he scanned the forest.
The young Fae bleated once more, leaning forward to nuzzle at John's hairline contently, "I'd like that, a ring you've made." Fawnlock murmured softly, rubbing his speckled thumbs over John's knuckles gently. "I'd wear it every day, never ever taking it off."
John kissed his mate's cheek before pulling back, hands drifting down to find the hem of the fawn's jumper and lift it up carefully over his head and the sweeping antlers. "Of course, love. I should have checked sooner. Lay down and make yourself comfortable while I get my kit." He pressed another kiss to the fawn's nose this time, then moved to the kitchen to grab his doctor's kit and a bowl of warm water and soft cloths to clean the wounds out and prepare them to be redressed.
John was nearly breathless with the passion burning through him, and the growing swell of impending release that filled him with an immense, needy pressure. But he couldn't wrench his gaze away from their sliding pricks and fumbling hands, the fae's desperate eagerness spilling over into him as well as if it were contagious. However when he felt the press of the fawn's lips against his, he tilted his gaze back up to catch sight of those silvery eyes and their fluttering lashes, kissing back with enthusiasm and desire.
"We have to go to the beach a few times though. Especially the first day. I want you to get some vitamin D before you go and hide in your little lab."
Fawnlock bleated softly, taking the journal back and smoothing its pages as he settled the book over his lap. He took back the graphite as well and his tongue stuck out as he scrawled across the page, then showed it to his mate, the rumbling sounding softly in his chest.
John poured a cup full into the tub, then swirled the water around, releasing the smell into the air. Once they had dissolved, John stood up and hooked his fingers into the waistband of his pants, pulling them down and tossing them towards the laundry hamper in the corner of the bathroom. The Fae nodded and his eyes flicked open to watch John rise. The fawn watched appreciatively as the human slipped off his pants, his tail swishing happily behind him.
"And then you found me. And now I'm mercy to the attention span of an overly curious fawn who easily gets bored. I've got quite the handful." John teased and laid there happily, never having found a place in his life that was more comfortable than this.
"You're more than welcome, love. I'm happy to spend time with you doing things like this." He pet the fawn's curly hair and closed his eyes, just basking in the warmth of the nest and the company of his mate.
Fawnlock smiled softly up at John, he murmured something in his language before he remembered to translate, "My gentle warrior, thank you for all you've done for me. I am truly blessed to have a mate like you.
John bit his lip as he pictured the fawn butting at an oak, or the side of the cottage, tuft of tail flicking in annoyance as he tried to get to that itch that evaded him. It was fairly adorable. Whatever his imagination was considering, he put it aside when his mate leaned in for another kiss. John's eyes widened with the nip, and he chased Fawnlock's mouth, assaulting it in return.
His speckled fingers traveled up to tug gently on John's short sandy hair, and he met John's gaze briefly before he rubbed his crotch against John's. He keened softly as he felt his mate's arousal through his jeans, the fawn gave a slightly smug look.
Sherlock jerks away from his older brother, covering the bruise with his hand. "It's nothing Mycroft, just some stupid idiots idea of fun, leave it." He scoots a little bit away from his brother, looking up at him with a scowl. His gaze narrows slightly, "Don't give me that look, Mycroft. I don't need your sympathy, I'll live it's just a bruise." He turns to look out the window at the rolling views. With a sigh, he slumps back into the opposite door. Mycroft sighs, but does not shift away from Sherlock, allowing him to lean against the door again.
Rinsing away the blood and patting him dry with sterile bandages, he then began squeezing the cuts closed and pouring the glue like liquid over the gashes, keeping an eye on the fawn's face to make sure he wasn't passing out.
Fawnlock padded over to some of the baskets and started to rummage carefully. Finally he hid something behind his back and made his way back to where John stood, a small smile on his Cupid bow lips. The fawn gently placed the crown of dull thorns, along with slightly dried berries and white flowers that he'd just retrieved on John's brow, a smile quirking his lips.
John smiled at Mrs. Hudson and followed her inside. "Oh yes...he has some fairly nasty cuts, but they seem to be mending alright. I had my doctor's kit, so thankfully I could take proper care of him." He sighed softly and closed his eyes for a moment, picturing Fawnlock's face. He put so much trust in John, and he wanted to live up to it.
"They'll learn to respect you. It is earned after all. A title doesn't really get you much, Prince." he teased with a smile, feeling happy and relaxed in this sacred place.
"Thank you." The three of them say simultaneously to the security guard, all three wearing ridiculous grins at the compliment.
Sherlock's gaze flickers to the other boy and huffs in acknowledgment before he goes back to examining the crab, cupping it in his hands before settling it back carefully. He stands and wades out of the pool, ignoring the other boy. And picks up his sneakers and makes his way to the next pool. As he kneels down to pick up an interesting bit of coral Mycroft's words from earlier that month come back to him, about making friends. Sherlock rolls his eyes at himself, what a ridiculous idea, I don't NEED friends.
The rumble continued on contently as he laid, speckled fingertips went to picking at the gauze on his chest gently, just unsticking tiny tuffs of velvet fur from the medical tape so it wouldn't hurt too much or pull at his fur anymore. The Fae huffed softly as he waited, staring at the healing gashes, they weren't too bad anymore, another few days and he'd he full healed. That thought quirked a small on his lips, his eyes flickered towards his approaching mate, "John," he murmured, reaching out his arms and making grabby-hand gestures at his mate.
He hugged Fawnlock tighter, pulling him up into John's lap while the blond roamed his fingers in calming patterns down his mate's spine.
Fawnlock's mother and father stood side by side, and a young Moosecroft stood in front of them. In the mother's arms, was a very small fawn, light skinned and dappled all over like a baby deer. There was the unmistakably lock of dark curl atop his head as well, no doubt where his name had come from. John ran his fingers carefully over the little sleepy bundle in the picture. It made his heart simply ache, with love, with sadness. It was overwhelming, and he couldn't find any words for it. It was in no way his fault that Fawnlock's family had suffered. But John had never felt so sorry for something in his life. He felt the burning prickle of tears behind his eyes. He'd never seen something so perfect in all of his life.
The fawn's hand tightened in the bedding of their nest, he tried not to buck him hips up into John's mouth, tried not to hurt John with the speckled fingers in his sand hair,  the fawn took deep breathes to steady and level himself.
He wriggled slightly and slid off of John's lap, "Let's finish our nest," he pressed a kiss to his mate's lips before he crawled back over to the considerably smaller than when they started pile of blankets, he gathered a soft one in his arms, "Then you can start our soup," he smiled softly and spread out the blanket, tail swishing, he bowed his head for a moment, smoothing out the fabric.
The fawn nodded eagerly, a smile tipping up the corners of his lips as he carefully tipped the instrument upside down and whole it gently, tapping the back of the body with speckled fingertips to deter any arachnids from staying put.
Fawnlock chuckled softly as he tried to teach John some of basic words in his native tongue, mostly tree names, "/Oak,/ John, it's pronounced like that," the Fae easily transitioned between languages as he spoke, "It isn't too complicated, it's basic, unlike the ready of the Fae language." The Fae explained softly before he said the word once more and promptly snickered softly at John's attempts.
Threading his fingers with his mate's, John glanced up at the owls flapping overhead, and felt wonderfully warm and safe between the two brothers. He smiled up at Moosecroft, who was watching the pair of them curiously, not as if they were an oddity, but rather, something amazing.
Moosecroft nodded as he stepped into his brother's wood; he knew where Mrs. Hudson was, for he'd visited the older fae before, both with and without the fawn. She was wise and kind, and he appreciated what she had done for his brother.
