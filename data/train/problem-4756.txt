"It was
Cas knows about sex, obviously, but as far as Dean's aware he's had very limited experience. It seems likely that Cas is not going to have a good handle on the subtle implications that can accompany these apparently-minor acts of physical contact. Things like, oh, chins on shoulders, and hands on chests... things that can slide a session of mere companionship into something... more.
the most important thing?"
At last Claire nodded, and she sank down on the edge of the mattress next to him. She was quiet a moment, looking at her hands.
Jimmy had been intending to ask her about Not-George's name, but it was clear she wouldn't be able to concentrate on that just now.
"Shoulda been just like that," Dean, still kissing him over and over, grief clear in his voice now. "Shouldn't've just been a dream. Shoulda been just like that... it shoulda been just like that..."
He texted back, "I'm waiting to see somebody."
Dean finally had to grunt out, "You had goddam better get both of our pants off soon. 'Cause I can't do it myself if you're gonna hold my hands pinned like this."
His hyper-controlling "religious family."
) After another long pause she added, thoughtfully, "I wonder if he could be in Heaven after all?"
, Dean thinks. The honeybees might be a nice reminder of Cas, actually, once Cas has totally moved out. Once Cas is totally gone.
Dean began to feel a little silly, the anger draining away as he bent over, rubbing his sore foot. He started to say, "That thing must be frickin' titanium—" when the black footrest shivered, all on its own, and bounced a couple inches away.
"... so....very... distracted by it, that the angel's ability to report is impeded." Cas finished. "Because of this phenomenon, we are trained to only report events of tactical significance. A sparrow may fall, or two, or three, or a thousand, but that doesn't matter for the mission." Cas's mouth tightened. "I'm not so sure anymore that God actually does grieve every sparrow, but anyway, the idea is, if we're on a mission to get an army through the gates of Hell, and we see a sparrow fall, we may grieve the fall of the sparrow, but it is not tactically relevant. In such a situation, we are trained to not report the sparrow and only report whether the gate of Hell is open or closed. The army and the gate matter, but not the sparrow." Cas gave a rueful sigh, his mouth twisting. "I see now that I still have that habit, even with you. I only report to you the things that are of immediate tactical relevance. I really hadn't fully realized that you might interpret that as hiding things, or as deceit. It's just how I was trained, you see."
Cas sighed, lowering the washcloth. He'd apparently gotten through the shower successfully and had just started the shave, but he already had some small bleeding nicks on his neck, and a really nasty one right under his lower lip that was bleeding pretty freely.
Dean quietly held out both hands. Cas took hold of one of Dean's hands in his own, and crouched on his heels before Dean to study that hand carefully, turning it over, looking closely at the palm and the back. He studied every fingertip with intense focus, and then did the same with Dean's other hand. And with Dean's left foot, and then with the right.
"Seriously? Like... end of the world?"
Dean wants to ask,
Every single day Cas heads out to the Gas-n-Sip. He's putting in long hours, too, with barely with a single day off. So once again Dean and Sam head off on the case on their own.
At last Cas steps forward and gives them both a hug. He's slightly hampered by the shoulder bag, so it ends up being just a quick one-armed hug, one to Sam first, and then one to Dean. It may be quick, it may be one-armed, but it's strong. With Dean, Cas again does the hand-on-the-back-of-the-neck thing, and again he gives Dean a quick little scritch there, almost ruffling the hair of the back of his neck. When Cas steps back there is something sad in his eyes, and yet he's smiling too.
It was mundane, it was routine... and it took him well out of camp. Boardwalk-checking was actually one of Dean's favorite jobs, for it required that he get out and about, circumnavigate the entire lake, and get not just one hill away, but two or even three hills away from camp. By about the second hill, he knew, the low drone of Big Mama's generator would finally fade away, and he would at last be in true wilderness.
) but grew increasingly longer, till it read:
Dean looked over what he'd written, hands on his hips. "You get the idea. We need to know where you went. The feet, truck, bike column is so we can look for the parked truck or the bike or whatever, to see where the bear jumped you or whatever happened. Or if you went by foot, then we kind of know how far you might've gotten. And the "overdue" is basically to give us a clue about, when should we really start to worry? Like, right now, the two of us might hang out at the sauna a while longer than I planned, but if it gets past the overdue time and we're still not back, that's when the other staff would swing into search mode."
Cas just nods. "Or alulae if you favor the Latin plural," he says, "Alula actually just means winglet, you know. Little ala; ala is the Latin for wing." He cocks his head, studying Dean for a moment. "How far did you read?"
Dean swings his feet out of bed, sits fully up on the edge of the bed so that he can face Cas directly, and says, "It's not gonna be like that this time."
"Holy shit, it worked," said Dean. "What's
"Yes," is all Castiel says.
In lieu of a kiss, Dean strokes the back of Cas's neck. For nearly half a minute.
Dean texts back, from the rest stop he's sitting at. (He is, in fact, at a Gas-n-Sip, embarrassingly enough. Cas's Gas-n-Sip, in fact. Though it turns out Cas isn't here today.)
But no. They
Dean blinks at him, and looks over at the T-bird.
Jimmy had to swallow, past a lump in his throat, before he could speak. "I wanted to make you pizza. It's the only thing I remember making for you."
"I know," said Sam again.
, and you see what you
, angel?" Dean says, deliberately dragging out the words, emphasizing them. There's just a "nnNNNgh..." in reply from Cas, like he's beyond words now. Dean says, "Then you better
? Would he just
"The trees are wonderful," said Cas, smiling up at him. "And the view's not bad at all. But it's even better now that you're here."
"Dean, he's not a pet," says Sam. "So he's busy. It's allowed. C'mon, let's grab breakfast."
Claire looked at him.
The orgasm wrings its way through him, spasm after spasm. Dean thrashes on the bed, bucking helplessly, groaning with every spurt as Castiel sucks him dry.
it — as if had suddenly unspooled to reveal that it was actually an immensely long road, a road that was millions of miles long, with multiple places where orishas could walk in from the sides. A moment later the Gate once again seemed to have no length at all, to simply be a seamless transition from silvery grasses to a soot-streaked cave-floor.
Dean flips past a few more pages and soon comes to another illustration, this one showing a fully spread wing. It's an impressive arc of a wing; a human vessel is drawn for scale and the wing seems truly immense in comparison, far bigger than even an eagle's wing. It must be some eight or nine feet long, a gleaming fan of dozens and dozens of perfectly aligned feathers stretched out in parallel arrays, almost architectural in their tidy organization. Groups of feathers are labeled with more of those tiny, elegant hand-lettered notes:
Sam was smiling now over the memory.
"You should stay warm," Cas commented.
When Gabriel came walking back a while later, he found Dean trying to sneak the one remaining fleece jacket over Sam's shoulders without waking him up.
There were complications to it all, to be sure. But he did love her.
"Cas'll like them," said Sam, trying to sound confident. "Besides, he's had totally different clothes recently anyway. He hasn't had this original outfit in a long time, you know. He likes those jeans, actually, you know, the ones you picked out at that thrift store...." Sam trailed off as he remembered that those were the jeans that had been completely soaked with blood, and that Dean had cut off with the shears last night, and that Sam had bundled up in a black plastic bag and carried out to the trash at four in the morning.
It was a very soft kiss, for Dean was vividly aware of Cas's split lip, and his bruises, and how weak and tired he must still be.
Dean had to play it again.
A great feathered dragon bursts up out the pool, roaring, in a shower of sparkling spray. It rockets straight up, shaking the water free, sparkling drops flying from its glittering wings. The dragon roars again, a bellowing, trumpeting sound that echoes off the distant rock walls as the enormous beast banks out over the canyon in a wide circle. There's an unmistakable sound of joy in that throaty sound, and the dragon trumpets again as it wheels around, making extravagant loops and serpentines and barrel rolls, the glittering wings spread wide, the golden crescents catching the sun. Its joy is infectious; Dean's standing now, jumping, and cheering too, yelling, "YEAH! YEAH! FLY, BABY, FLY!"
Dean paused, thinking. "Well, there's a couple other phrases, like, 'go ahead' when you're first replying to someone, to let them know you're able to hear them; 'say again' if you want them to repeat something; 'roger' if you just want to convey, I heard what you said, I acknowledge it. There's the emergency stuff too, of course, y'know, like Mayday if you're in a boat or a plane that's in real trouble, Sécurité for an important safety announcement, Break if you have to break in to other people's conversation for something important. Oh and, normally we would also have call signs. Over."
, thought Dean with a grin. In moments it was out of sight.
?" he whispered to Sam.
"The Franklin Bluffs," Sam read from his brochure. "We must be close to that river. It says here: Scan the gravel bars along the river for muskoxen and caribou."
Dean feels his face going warm.
Then something seemed to catch Cas's attention near the edge of the hole. Cas turned his head to the border of the ragged carpet and delicately plucked up something small and shining with his teeth. He retreated then, backing rapidly to rejoin Sam and Dean, wings still flared out tensely. Something was glinting between his teeth. One of the longest threads still seemed stuck to it, and it trailed all the way over from the bottomless pit. Cas brought it over to them, huffing a little in excitement, like a gigantic black retriever who'd found a particularly interesting stick.
Sam was saying, "So the Mark was only supposed to be temporary?"
— okay—" He soon has to give up any other attempts at speech when Cas shifts into an erratic rhythm that Dean's never shown him, sets of rapid jerks at Dean's preferred tempo that are interrupted, very unpredictably, by an excruciating pause of about one or two seconds, during which Cas's hand goes absolutely still on Dean's cock. The first time this happens, the pause is completely maddening; Dean groans with frustration, twisting his hips and trying to thrust into Cas's hand, desperate for motion. But a second later Cas's hand starts moving again and it feels, somehow, twice as exciting as before, twice as wonderful; Dean can't help letting out a groan. Cas keeps doing the little pauses, and each time the sensations ratchet upwards, like a roller coaster car creeping up the first big hill.
He thought,
" Cas burst out, taking a step toward Raphael. Gabriel and Balthazar each grabbed one of his wings, and Cas flinched, eyes closing. He stepped back into place reluctantly, and they let go of his feathers. "What deal?" Cas demanded again, opening his eyes and glaring at Raphael in near-disbelief. "Raphael, you've truly been working
Was that even possible?
"Hey... um.... " says Sam. He, too, darts a look at Cas, and then he pulls Dean a little farther out of earshot, to a corner of the kitchen, to ask, "Should we ask him... about... you know. The details?"
Dean's left standing in the middle of the room, surrounded by the scattered chairs and pillows, holding the little plant. All he can do is watch the closed — and locked — bathroom door. Watch, and listen.
Sam said, "It's a wall! Isn't it? It's a wall to hold the Darkness back?" Cas gave an uncertain grunt and banked his wings to go into a wide, slow circle, studying the lightning-wall. He was calling constantly to the other angels now, in a series of gruff roars and grunts, his ears flicking right and left constantly and his head angling around as he tried to figure out what was going on.
Dean pulled him back to bed, and Cas finally followed. Dean lay down on his right side, guiding Cas to lie down next to him, even helping Cas keep the trenchcoat in place as he lay down next to Dean. Cas got on his left side, so that they were facing each other, side by side.
Dean holds Sam's eyes for a second, and Sam gives a faint shake of the head.
This time Cas let him.
Soon Dean's cock's like iron. It feels red-hot, ridiculously hard; it's throbbing almost painfully. Cas spits into his hand again and spreads the spit over Deans cockhead and Dean almost cries out.
"I could learn," says Castiel. They all turn and look at him.
And now this.
Now Dean almost doesn't want Castiel to wake at all, for he's suddenly become certain that this faint and puzzling "warmth" that seems to be lying across Dean's shoulders might be an actual wing. Or at least some sort of wing-related aura.
He thought a moment and scribbled
At first there were just vague impressions, like a hallucinatory dream of falling. Was he falling, really? Or was he swimming in water? Or high above the Earth, maybe, falling through clouds? Or flying over mountains, clutched tight in a huge feathered foot... or sitting in the Impala, driving through the night....
"It's a high-resolution carpet, can you believe it?" said Sam. "Look at this one. Cas, is that Saturn?" He pointed to an image of an extraordinarily beautiful ringed planet with an Earth-like moon hovering in front of it.
that feels," Dean gasps.
"It happens to some angels," said Cas at last, and now he was speaking so softly that his voice was barely audible. "Not all."
, Dean thought.
The nurses then got into a complex discussion about whether they should still be trying to warm Cas up from his hypothermia or whether the major problem now was to make sure his pneumonia-related fever didn't take off. Apparently Cas actually was running a fever, at least in his "body core"; but somehow his "extremities" still hadn't fully warmed up from last night's hypothermia.
Then it gave a rather resigned-sounding sigh. It brought one wing forward, and a set of small feathers at the bend of the wing brushed Sam lightly on the head. At once Sam's eyes closed, his head sagged and his knees buckled. He would have pitched face-forward onto the ground except that the dragon nimbly slid one wing down below him, catching Sam neatly on a wide bed of feathers as Sam toppled over. The dragon shook its wing a little, sliding Sam carefully to the ground, as Dean looked on in confusion. He blinked up at the dragon, totally bewildered now — was this for real? Was it really Cas?
They went to the alley out back, where (Cas now knew) there was a handy spot between a scrawny tree and a dumpster where two men could get somewhat out of view.
"That's what I thought," said Cas, with a little nod.
Cas never came back.
They're seated at the library table. Sam's bending over a book, his hair falling over his eyes. Dean's tipped back in his chair looking up at the ceiling, with his legs stretched out and his feet up on the table, one foot crossed over the other.
Dean ran one hand through his own hair. "I had to wrap you in a sheet," he said. "Tie it around you. Tore up some curtains, used them to tie it around your feet, around your waist, around your shoulders. Whole nine yards, the whole deal. Found some dead trees to cut the wood for the fire. Takes hours, you know that? Took all damn day. Cut all the wood, stack it up, carry you out, put you up there.... douse it— you — with — with lighter fluid—" And there Dean had to stop again for a long moment, his throat aching.
," Dean says, "Not that it ain't a nice back." Cas just gives him a very embarrassed look and disappears at near-lightspeed around the corner, towel wrapped firmly around himself like a cape, leaving Dean still chuckling — but still a little confused.
"You were dreaming," Dean informs him, kneeling down by the bed to get eye-to-eye with him. Dean cups his face with one hand, stroking his cheek gently with the pad of his thumb. "You back with us? You're okay. Everything's okay."
"I appreciate you going along with it," Cas says. "I really do. I know this must seem a little unusual, to a human."
"What the hell..." Sam was saying from behind him. "Dean, there's these butterflies—Look, there's, like three of them. No, look, more, they're all over! Dean, there's
Cas held very still, as the mammoth felt delicately at Cas's wings, her trunk huffing breaths of warm air over Cas's feathers.
"Why didn't we ever do this," said Dean. "We never did this."
... with
And, Dean realized now,
Cas shook himself and sat up a bit (though still leaving his wings splayed wide out). He shifted one front foot to the ever-reliable patch of sandy ground and began writing. Dean hurried back over to him and read:
Dr. Flaherty sets his iPad down, and Dean's intensely grateful when he hands Dean a Kleenex, waits till Dean blows his nose, and then reaches out and gives Dean a professional pat on the knee. "These things are very unpredictable," Dr. Flaherty says. "If he'd gone out running or something like that, I'd be more concerned. But sex and walking are more minor. It may have been neither of those events. And, the thing is, life can't stop entirely. The only way to keep blood pressure down for sure is to chain someone to a bed, and enforced bedrest is actually
The knot of desperate anxiety in his heart at last faded.
"She cursed my truck. That's why I got stuck in the storm. Nearly killed me, actually — Cas found me just in time. I broke the curse though."

get to feel what that's like, and Dean won't ever get to feel it either, not with Cas, not ever, and then he's choking back tears.
Claire said, her voice muffled behind her hands. "Nobody ever answered."
to get the mammoth's attention. He ran at top speed, waving his arms to catch Raphael's attention, and leaped between Cas and the mammoth, yelling, "LEAVE HIM ALONE, RAPHAEL, YOU FUCKING ARCHANGEL SON OF A BITCH!"
. There's a certain optimism to this whole scent-shopping expedition, actually; it implies that there will, in fact, be a "later" to worry about.
"How thoughtful of her," said Dean, only half-listening as he checked his watch. He'd have to leave within a half hour to get out of here safely.
moving under him, rolling him around a little, letting him settle more perfectly against Castiel, with skin to skin contact all the way down. Cas settled closer, incredibly close, a long lean sinuous band of heat that seemed wrapped all around Dean from all angles. Outside the wind whistled, and the snow hissed endlessly against the strangely huge tent's dark walls.
male vessel... so that... you wouldn't... get distracted.
) froze as Dean touched him, the vast wings on either side twitching up a little. It watched him carefully with those huge sapphire eyes as Dean began to stroke its face.
Dad, c'mon, we gotta go, c'mon, please?
"—ter One, Hunter One, this is Blackb—" echoed through the room again as Dean picked up the channel-six radio. Dean frowned a little at the crackly sound of Cas's voice. The sound was a little more staticky this time, the signal weaker.
Only then did Castiel realize that he actually
"How many summonings have you
"No, it.... wasn't," said Dean.
, Dean thinks. He glances over at Castiel, who is not really looking very Impala-like at all at the moment, as he shifts in his sleep on the sofa, his feet tangling in the blanket. Even in his sleep he still looks tired and thin, and Dean's eyes linger on him for a long moment; the cancer's suddenly in the forefront of Dean's thoughts again.
. I'll admit I seem to be losing some of my former... abilities. I have felt the cold sometimes, a little bit, this year."
"Maybe not," Dean said, with a nod. "Okay, maybe not. Not yet. But we can hope. And we'll work on it. Maybe we'll figure out a way. Find a way to figure it out for sure."
The flicker of hope didn't seem to last very long.
But this time it was a nightmare.
Dean scrambled up to his feet, wobbling a little as he tried to balance on the skinny ropes. Cas helpfully stuck a wing out toward him, and Dean grabbed onto the wing for support, looking over at the chair and the softly glowing lamp. It was definitely a chair. And it was definitely a La-Z-Boy.
Sam was quiet for a while too.
Cas smiled.
The second they got going Dean realized that driving had probably been a mistake. For one thing, the June sunlight seemed far too bright and vivid. Actually
"Up, up!" said Sam. At the last second Cas gave a little burst of six or seven slow, lurching flaps and gained a few feet of height, barely managing to clear the wave. Dean heard a

Instead Dean found himself saying, "I still got your feather."
"Well," said Dean after a few moments, "Why don't... uh... why don't you keep going on the liminal-gods, I guess... and... " He thought for a moment, and said, slowly, "I think I'll take a look at Cas's notes."
Cas steered Dean's hand to his own chest, pressing Dean's fingers flat, until Dean's hand was spread exactly over Cas's heart, in a reversal of their earlier position.
wasn't out of the bathroom. Dean started to get a little worried. He walked to the bathroom and listened for a moment.
"Sparrows are always such drama queens," agreed Dean.
Their roles seemed to have flipped somehow; now Claire was acting as the parent. Her next plan turned out to be to get Jimmy settled and comfortable on the sofa, tucking a comforter around him, and even bringing him his favorite little pillow from his bedroom. It was a little hand-sewn pillow that had been a gift from Claire long ago, and Jimmy thought it was a nice gesture that she actually went and fetched it from his room for him now. Jimmy was quite fond of this little pillow; it had been nestled under his head back when he'd first woken up last year, at the clinic, back when he'd surfaced from those six years of blackness.
"Your name's Cas," said Dan, turning his head to kiss him on the cheek. He wrapped one arm around Jimmy's —
This is always the place where Dean stops reading.
Dean considered that; it was an interesting point.
- Such heartfelt comments you all left, such deeply moving and touching stories, such thoughtful analyses of the fic and of cancer and of life. I wanted to reply to each and every one but was so desperate for time that I kept putting it off till later. Basically I had to prioritize writing the fic over writing repies - I'm so sorry!!  My plan now is to start replying, at the very least to the comments on the last chapter, but please forgive me if it takes a while.
Sam, we seriously
As soon as Cas caught Dean's eye, he raised both his forelegs in the air, slowly lifting both front feet till they were clearly in Dean's field of view.
Cas took that in for a moment, touching his chest gently, and looking at his hand. No scar on the hand either, just as Claire had said. Slowly he folded the pajama-top closed, as Claire pulled the comforter tighter around his shoulders.
She brightens immediately at the idea. It soon turns out she still won't let Dean do any work; he's only allowed to roll around on a second mechanic's dolly in order to point things out on the underside of the car. (Cas soon joins them, of course, and he ends up walking around the T-Bird and studying its wardings with professional interest.) Dean also insists on a thorough tutorial about properly chocking the wheels when working under any kind of a vehicle. But it turns out he only has to point and explain; Claire does all the work, and she does a very careful job. Then she wants to hear about how to do brake jobs, for her Subaru. The parts have long since arrived (Dean ordered them weeks ago), and Dean talks her through that too.
day after the burial, the day after adding the finger-string, it had occurred to Dean that Cas might not even be able to move his hand. What if he couldn't heal up his wrist wound? What if the finger-tendons were damaged or something and he couldn't move his finger? Then, too, it was getting late in the year— what if Cas woke up when it was really cold? What if the dirt packed down too tightly in the rain and the string got stuck? What if the ground froze solid and the string froze into a total block of ice or something? Dean had gotten pretty worried about all this, and Sam had found him pacing around in the basement later that day looking for a place where he could store Cas's vessel. Dean had concluded it really would be best to disinter the vessel completely and bring it back to the bunker, but Sam had finally managed to convince him that they had no place cool and dry enough to store a vessel where it wouldn't stink up the whole bunker.
Sam shook his head, with a wan smile. "Honestly I'd love to," he said. "But Ruby really wants to just take off."
The dragon tilted its head, scanning the sky with one eye. (
! The colors, how your feathers had flecks of gold here and there, and how you'd lost the longest feathers but that your wings were still really pretty anyway. She was asking me if you'd lost the feathers because of the chemo, and if they would grow back. Isn't that funny? I checked with the docs and they were like, well, chemo can sometimes cause hallucinations, you know, chemo-brain and all that; but I couldn't bear to tell her it was just hallucinations so I just... went with it. I was like, oh yeah, absolutely, Em, that Castiel sure has such gorgeous wings, doesn't he!" She's laughing again now. "And now you turn up with a frickin'
Plunking the whole bundle in his own duffel, Dean zips the duffel closed and picks up the entire thing, hefting it over one shoulder. Sam raises an eyebrow and Dean says, "I think I'm gonna room with Cas tonight. There's two beds in there — plenty of room. Nothing personal, it's just, you snore, dude."
Right on the bend of the wing, where the little winglets were. In his surprise, Cas couldn't help lifting up the winglets a little.
Dean flailed awake, yelling, "Watch out, Sammy, it's coming!" He nearly hit Sam in the head. Sam seemed to be right on top of him somehow; Dean realized that Sam was leaning in the open back door of the car, leaning over Dean to shake his shoulder. Sam was too exposed! It would see him too!
He stopped short.
"It comes with conditions," says Dean, and Claire's gaze slowly shifts back to Dean. "And the first one is, till you get some real snow tires, you

, and a
And he realized, rather slowly, that Cas was, for once, letting him get a clear look at the wing.
Dean would've even been willing to go through the camp trash. But at dinner that night Ryan told him that he'd burned all the camp trash already. Recyclables and compostables were hauled away, but everything else was burned on site, and yesterday had been burn day.
And Dean's job is to hold him up. Dean's job is to make sure that Cas's heart keeps beating, that he keeps breathing, and most of all that he doesn't choke, and that means holding him up.
A spark of light; a tiny flame? Cas was holding a match, and the match was the only light in the world, and it lit Cas's face from the side, and he was beautiful. He was beautiful. He was so stunningly beautiful... and he was also swearing under his breath, cursing God quietly, but that was all wrong and must have only been a dream, because angels didn't swear.
Cas pulls the feather out of his pocket and shows it to her. "She won't feel anything, I promise. I would just put this feather on her throat and then speak some words. That's all."
Cas is very still a moment, one hand on the door handle. He holds out his hand; Dean knows what he means, and pulls the feather out of his pocket for Cas to see. Cas plucks it out of Dean's hand. The end of the feather is shuddering in the wind, and Dean's suddenly paranoid it's going to blow away, but Cas keeps a firm hold on it, studying it for a long moment. In fact Cas is gripping it so tightly his fingertips start going white, his hand clamped down like iron on the little feather-shaft. Again there's that sense that he's been wanting to hold it, and look at it, all along, but has been deliberately denying himself.
"It's broken," said Sam, fiddling with the little clip. "Look, it's supposed to close, like a hair clip, but it can't anymore. The bottom half's gone."
Sam held Dean's eyes.
"Seven...." said Dean. "Eight... nine... ten... " He paused, glancing up at Cas, and found that Cas's eyes were glittering with unshed tears.
Cas had one hand over his mouth now, still gazing up at the tree. His eyes were looking a little glittery again, just like last night when he'd seen his room.
Cas then stood, got his own snowpants back on and looked around for Dean's underwear, which had somehow ended up on a willow-shrub almost ten feet away. Cas fetched the underwear; Dean, by now, was getting to his own feet, dizzy and stunned and somewhat breathless. Wordlessly Dean put on his underwear, and Cas helped him back into the snow pants and boots. (The long johns now seemed unnecessary, for Dean felt completely overheated). Dressing was a slow process, interrupted by occasional wordless kisses, and caresses, and a few more wistful touches.
," snapped Dean, a blaze of fury running through him. For it almost seemed, for a moment, that the orishas had stolen away Castiel himself. Dean had been
There was a gentle touch of roughened hands on his face. It seemed unreal. The radio-play continued:
"Damn risk you took," said Dean. "Pretty friggin' risky move, bud, exploding your grace like that—"
Cas flipped the blade around in his hand, staring at Dean. "Dean," he said, "This isn't you. This is what you were becoming in Hell, before I pulled you out. It was what the Mark was going to turn you into, too, eventually.
? It sniffed my boot! A wolf pup
"But, Dean—" Sam started to say.
crazy dream. Like the most insane dream I ever had."
During the last hour, every other concern has blessedly disappeared. There had been only Dean, and Cas, and the bed, and nothing else. But now in a rush it's all back, and a dreadful vision comes to mind of what it'll truly be like if Cas... leaves.
"It's Sam, right?" said Castiel. "You're Dean's brother? Would you like to come in?"
Lying limp in Dean's arms....
The next five minutes are all terror. First there's a sickening moment when Cas almost slithers right off the stone bench. It would be only a ten- or fifteen-foot drop here, only to the next section of trail, but that's still a potentially fatal fall, and Dean frantically yanks him back, grabbing him anywhere he can reach, scarf and jacket and arm, scrambling back till the two of them topple backwards together over the stone bench and land safely onto their own section of trail. Cas ends up on top of Dean, blood dripping everywhere, and Dean scrambles wildly to get Cas off him, and get him face-up, and then to get onto his own hands and knees next to him. Cas is still unconscious and Dean can't seem to get through his scarf to try to find a pulse, and suddenly the damn wind's picked up again so that it seems impossible to tell if Cas is breathing. Dean screams "SAM!" at the top of his lungs, bellowing it toward the top of the trail, hoping desperately that Sam or maybe some Christmas-Day tourist will hear him. But the trail's deserted, and Sam doesn't appear. Dean's hands are shaking so hard that for a moment he can't get the
But now the nurse is nodding. The nurse's
After a short pause Sam turns back to Cas to add, "After Bobby we did find a new place, too." He gestures around at the bunker with his beer bottle. "A new hidey-hole, right? New places, new cases, a whole new routine — that always helps."
Cas pauses right there, framed by one of the snow-frosted windows as he rummages around quietly in his duffel bag. He finally pulls out his old cream-colored scarf, along with one of new extra-warm hats that Dean gave him for Christmas (even though he's already got the monkey-hat on) and a new pair of Christmas mittens too. He studies the mittens in the dim room, apparently trying to make sure he's got a matching pair, and as he does so he's outlined perfectly against the window. Etched in perfect silhouette, by the faintly glowing winter light.
"Stop saying that," said Dean.
Dean let out a ragged laugh. "Hell of a true form, isn't it."
A smile spread over God's face. He hopped off Cas's wing and put his hands on his hips, beaming at Sam, Dean and Castiel (who all were still clinging to their bundles of stray threads). "At
Once they got back down to the bunker, Sam sat Dean down with a cup of coffee and scrambled up some eggs for breakfast. Sam had gotten into this funny habit recently of making ridiculously big breakfasts. Pancakes and eggs and bacon and all kinds of things. It was weird, really, because it wasn't Sam's usual kind of food. It was more the kind of stuff that Dean used to eat.
"Just experimenting," suggests Dean.
"Alula-feathers," Dean murmured, and once again he touched the little gold-tipped feather on Cas's wing. To his surprise the little feather he'd been touching moved. It moved on its own, as if independently controlled, raising up slightly from the leading edge of the wing.
spat the regal man, this time finally turning around to glare at Gabriel.
. As the reality of it began to settle in, Dean soon began to feel almost giddy. The little kitchen seemed almost to brighten, the bunker somehow becoming warmer, the light more golden. Soon Dean felt as light as a balloon, almost drunk with the relief of it. He even finally got a few bites of pizza down, but eventually set down the half-eaten slice, finding he still didn't really have much appetite. But he stayed right where he was, one knee still pressed against Cas's, studying Cas's profile as Cas chatted with Sam. (Cas was quizzing Sam now about the iPad, and soon Sam had fetched it to show Cas a few of the apps.)
"I'm not a complete idiot," said Sam. He caught Dean's eye and added, "That contract was insane. I invalidated all the codicils before I signed. I overwrote them with my own codicils — crossed out the old ones, put the new ones in the margins — and initialed and dated each one." To Crowley he added, "What did you think I was doing, all that time in the back seat?"
Somebody dressed in long flowing clothing of red. Long loinclothes and robes, almost. Somebody who was running around on the ridge below... running amazingly fast, it seemed, and swinging something that looked like....
"Ha!" Dean called up to them, between pants of his own. "Not so easy after all, was it?"
It seemed laughable.
And Castiel blushed. It would have been funny, if he hadn't looked so rattled.
and at that bizarre thought, every muscle in Cas's groin seemed to pulse at once. Cas cried out, his hips rocking forward one last time as the wave of ecstasy ripped through him. Come began flying out of his cock, the first two spurts shooting all the way up onto Dean's chest.
"Little Jackie Paaaaper," sang Dean, "loved that rascal Puff! And brought him stringgggs and sealing-wax, and other faaaan-cy stuff!" (That was all there was to the first verse — it really wasn't a very complex song.) "Oh, Puff the magic draaaa-gon, lived by the seeeeaaaaa..."
, an outlier and an outcast - it has haunted me since. And it all seemed to boil down to this tiny little moment about who would drive me home. Anyway, later when I decided to write this fic, that's why I decided that the very first gesture of assistance that Dean would offer to Castiel would be to drive him home from the clinic.
"It was... when... I... didn't know where you were. The first time was... right before Mom disappeared. I didn't know where... you... were. I didn't know if you were alive... I didn't know if you would ever come back..." Claire's voice was getting choked, and Jimmy refocused on her, realizing she was getting lost in some mental quagmire of her own. "I didn't know where you were..." she repeated, "And I didn't know what had happened to you. I was just praying you were still alive. I was praying you would come back to me. I prayed every night, but—"
"Dean?" Sam said hoarsely.
, he thought.
, Sam, you had nothing to do with this—"
Cas grimaced. "I know I'm not family. But it seemed an appropriate phrase anyway. Anyway, you can still be in the play if you want. And I bought the tickets."
to Dean, sitting up in bed with such a bright eager look on his face, and such a beaming smile, saying "Dean, I was
. You're the only Cas I've got. Don't you get it? You're the only one, Cas, and you
"Yes," said Cas quietly. "Even the alulas."
There were still a few days till Friday, though, and Cas's description of his completely inadequate camp situation wouldn't leave Dean's mind. The next day he drove the Chevy around the lake, hiked up the long boardwalk, up and over the first hill and up the second, past the icewater pool to the wooden box, which he unlatched and swung open. Into the box he placed three charged batteries (he'd started borrowing a third from a little-used radio), a twelve-pack of Fig Newtons, six cans of tuna and a can opener, a jar of peanut butter along with a sturdy stainless-steel knife, a loaf of bread, several granola bars and a couple of apples, and the Tupperware, which this time was packed full of banana bread and oatmeal cookies.
"Elegua's opening gates!" said Sam. Cas veered over to the new gate, but Elegua had disappeared from that one too — and reappeared on the next hill over. Cas and Gabriel both followed, both of them snorting with excitement now.
That, at last, drags a little smile out of Sam.
Another puzzle piece is slotting into place, a vivid memory of Castiel practically cowering in the Denver motel shower last week, and how he'd hurriedly wrapped that plastic shower curtain around his waist as soon as Dean had come into the room. How careful he'd been to cover up everything below the waist.
"You do remember that thing I had you sign, Sam, on the drive down?" added Crowley cheerfully. "When we were kind of implying that things weren't gonna go too well for your bro if you didn't sign? That contract about how you'd get all that sweet, sweet, Alaska Petroleum salary money, how you could take care of your brother? You
Dean tried to give him a smile. "Cas... it's.... it's an okay song, I guess. It's... fine. I just had sort of a headache, is all, but it's—"
"Cas doesn't know, does he?" says Dean. "That I'm alive? He got zapped before I called, right?"
Well, that was intriguing.
Cas gave a little grimace, but he nodded. "I'm aware it's a little pointless; I know you've seen my wings already. But I guess I've gotten used to keeping them hidden."
Dean looked at him. "Why wouldn't it work?"
Cas pulled back a few inches and stared at her. He felt at his chest again. Claire disengaged from his uncoordinated hug and went over to the wall to turn on the room light, and Cas looked around in confusion.
too of course, but first of all there'd been that unexpected hug from Castiel in the cemetary. Dean had somehow been taken by surprise, for Cas had never before really given him that kind of one-on-one heartfelt hug.
It was another long, long hike. Dean spent most of the time chatting to Cas and explaining to him (for the millionth time) that Cas really needed to get his feathery ass back
"You look
"Yep," said Gabriel, "We're each just looking out for number one."
Sam adds, "You said it yourself, he's usually gone a few days after a zap. We gotta be patient. Here, I brought your laptop — why don't you start in on North America news item searches, I'll start on the international ones, and we'll check the John Does again tomorrow."
time and don't think I don't remember the first, too. And also it means
Nothing happens. Cas lets out a small sigh, and his hand moves on.
So many things Dean wanted to say to Castiel then.
Cas nodded, saying, "Claire was just a—"
, it might be possible..." He's frowning, thinking hard; Dean can almost see him rummaging through his mental back catalogues of information about souls and how to access them. "It might work," murmurs Cas. "It
you do?"
Dean remembers now what his own reply had been: "It's not gonna be like that this time." He grimaces at the memory, at the way he'd worded it. Thirst and hunger and fatigue and pain were, indeed, all extremely familiar sensations for Castiel now, weren't they? No wonder Cas had given him such a strange look in return.
Cas shakes his head. "It's true. Cancer is a flaw in Creation." At Dean's puzzled look, Cas explains, "It's an inherent flaw of multicellular life. All life forms will get cancer if they live long enough, and if they don't die of anything else first; it's inevitable. It's widely regarded as a design flaw. Or at least that's been Legal's interpretation."
After a long moment of breathing very carefully, he was able to turn back to Cas, who was still staring at Dean in absolute silence.
"Lapsang Souchong," Sam mutters. "Different soap... no aftershave tomorrow morning... Anything else?"
Dean breaks in with a loud, "NO MORE DEALS. No... multi-dimensional bras or whatever; just get out of here. I mean, thanks for your help and all, but, you
Sam repeats slowly, "She... wafted away?"
God actually ended up much more benevolent than I was originally planning, fond of his Creation and the "bunny rabbits" that invaded his Mona Lisa. I was originally thinking he'd be more standoff-ish and distant, unconcerned with humanity, but he turned out to be pretty friendly, didn't he?
But had never heard of "snow machine?"
Occasionally a monster leapt at the "SAM" figure. Dean's mouth always twitched when this happened, but each time he felled the monster instantly.
away. She was stumbling back a step, and another, until she fetched up against another little tree.
Silence. Sam stole a glance over at Dean. Dean was gazing straight ahead at the road.
opportunity to devise an appropriate spell, or just a wee speck of time to refine the feather approach, I could—"
tight hug this time, as if Cas is trying to weld Dean right onto his own chest. Cas has also gone for the both-arms-on-top hug option, a little tricky since he's not as tall, but he pulls it off, one hand on the back of Dean's neck and the other wrapped tight over Dean's shoulders.
"She's been working on it for the last three days," explained Cas. "She's lining it with ptarmigan feathers now. Which are not abundant, you may notice. She walks a mile or more of tundra to find a single feather, collecting these rare feathers one at a time and bringing them back here. And look, look carefully—" Cas bent to the nest and gently brushed back some overlying willow-twigs.
Maybe it wasn't the life he'd originally had in mind, but that was okay. Sure, he still had dreams, sometimes, of some endless road trip down south, of wild adventures down in the lower forty-eight, driving from state to state on the long back roads, drinking his way from bar to bar, a life straight out of Kerouac. He even had dreams, sometimes, of driving an actual Chevrolet Impala. (Black. It was always black, in his dreams. Just like the truck.) But somehow he'd found a job up here that he was good at, where he could use his hands, and his mind, where he wasn't stuck at a desk, and where he could even have his guns. It always felt good to know he was taking care of his people.
Both Cas's wings are giving urgent bursts of flutters now. The med student's leaning out into the hall and calling for someone, and a nurse comes running over. Again Dean begs, "
Castiel said, "Actually, it's an eighth of a tooth. But it should have the full genome, and enough connection to the soul to call it back. I hope. With the three of us together we just may be able to pull the rest of it together." He raised his head a little to peer over the snowdrift again. His sharp intake of breath made them all look back toward the parking lot.
Though, of course... no Cas this time.
The same two men he'd shoved past earlier were standing facing him. Castiel halted before them, looking around; Lucifer was not in sight.
"You okay?" says Sam.
find Castiel, Dean. There's a terrible threat facing Heaven—"
Cas nods, looking at the feather. "Seemed I might need a way to hide it," he explained, "and I've had a fair bit of practice at concealing items in the sleeves of this coat."
She was quiet for an unnervingly long time. At last she stopped worrying at her thumbnail, lowered her hand and said, slowly, "There's not much precedent. If he died as a human... He could actually be in the Veil, I suppose?" (Dean drew a slightly ragged breath, starting to feel a little better.
"Yes. It was a quick fix, you understand, not perfect at all. For one thing, it tugs constantly at that one point. The chaos of the unraveling threads leaks through. Later, while I was thinking about it in my lockbox — I had quite a lot of millennia to think about what I'd done wrong, you see — I realized it probably would have conveyed a deep sense of wrongness, I think, to the bearer."
But nothing happened; it remained an iPad.
Dean had to chuckle when he took the Continental over the Continental Divide, the invisible line at the pinnacle of the Rockies that divided the watersheds of the Pacific and the Atlantic. I-90 actually crossed the Continental Divide no less than three times, as it looped its way through the mountains, and on the third time Dean finally parked and took a picture of the Continental exactly straddling the Continental Divide. Cas woke up again when the car stopped, and rolled down his window to tell Dean, "But this watershed division is constantly moving, Dean. Just another million years or two and it'll be in an entirely different place."
know, you ninny, she was guessing and you just confirmed it. Oldest trick in the book. Dean, haven't you taught him
Dean dozed, and he awoke, and he dozed again, in a series of catnaps that might each have been hours long or mere minutes. It seemed impossible to tell how much time was passing. The night seemed to be endlessly long, the logs always burning alarmingly fast, and though the area right by the fireplace was still warm, the arctic cold always seemed to be hovering very near by, just outside the ring of firelight. Each time Dean awoke he tried to rouse himself to check Cas's back and his face, and Dean called his name, checked the pulse at his neck, felt his fingers and his toes, and tried to re-wrap the blankets around him. Twice more Dean even managed to "rotate" Cas again, rolling him over to turn a different side toward the fire.
"Do you think this could've all been one building once?" said Sam, pointing out some of the other ruins. "In, like, gigantic circles maybe? Look at those ridges. Is that natural or are those... polygons or something?"
"Don't back it up, it'll take forever," suggested Dean. "And get out of this email app, it's just getting depressing. What else does it have?"
, Dean thought, walking slowly up to him on somewhat wobbly legs. He reached out one hand to try to pat Cas on the nose, feeling almost timid as he did so, but Cas's soft purr started up again almost at once. Dean stroked a hand down his long nose, and Cas lowered his head so Dean could reach him more easily, even closing his big blue eyes.
"There's no case," says Dean. There seems to be absolutely no point anymore in sticking to the original story.
Where the fuck are you, Sam had asked. Where the fuck are you? You good?
Sam eventually chased him back to the hotel to grab a couple more hours of sleep. This time Dean realized it was maybe a little silly to make himself sleep as uncomfortably as possible (the nurse had been right, Dean
All the possible feints, dodges and counter-attacks played out with Dean regaining control of the battle and Cas just more exhausted than before.
"You didn't ask," said Cas, unable to stop himself. "You didn't call."
"Not taking that bet," whispered Dean back. "Pretty sure this is the First Damn Everything. I'm certain that was the First Wooden Stick. We're probably sitting on the First White Plastic Chairs."
Dean gave a sharp inhale, his arms tightening around Cas's shoulders. Cas paused, only now realizing that he'd drifted a little outside of normal hug territory.
Sam seemed unfazed, though, and got right back to work. Dean kept working his way dutifully through his steak, watching Sam paging through the Enochian dictionary, and started to feel a little guilty that he wasn't helping more with the research.
None of it seemed real. All of it was distant and irrelevant. Just a play on a radio station, dimly heard through the static, as he rode along at night in the back seat of the black car.
damaged. I mean, the sigil was all healed... so... I think... I think he could heal up a
Dean stood completely frozen now, his mouth actually agape. If it had been overwhelming to meet dragon-Castiel, it was downright impossible to meet human-Castiel, and Dean could not seem to take it in. Cas was looking over Sam's shoulder at Dean, and though Cas was patting Sam's shoulder he started to look increasingly concerned. As soon as Sam finally released Cas (Sam was sniffling again), Cas reached over to Dean with one hand, squeezing him on the shoulder. But it didn't feel real; it felt ghostly, amorphous. Dean thought,
He wonders if he should dump the ice down the sink. It's already starting to melt in Dean's lap, the ziploc bag damp with condensation. But then he thinks:
Dean waited, smiling, until Cas's fragmentary transmission had ended, and then said, "Okay, so, you need to wait one second before talking. Press the button down and wait one second. The radio needs a sec to start broadcasting. Same thing when you end, don't cut yourself off or I'll miss your last word. Over."
"You don't," she said at last, in a very tiny voice, her head down. "You just think you do."
, Dean wants to say.
"Oh, it's worth it," said Cas. "I'll let you get back to sleep. Um... over? Is the conversation over? Do I say over now? I forget how to end. Over."
They both turn to watch Cas for a moment. He's across the store from them and he's got at least ten people waiting in line with food, several trying to pay for gas (one of the pump's registers is broken), one person asking for help with their car, another asking for lottery tickets, and a third who's just asked for a pack of cigarettes from the stacks behind the counter.
human Cas was, with everything that came with that: Hunger. Poverty.
of Quidditch, I think, is that the individual matters, that it's not just a team sport but also an individual battle also. That there's a way a single dedicated individual can make a difference all on his own. And the flip side is, the team doesn't give up either. Even though you know things could end at at any time through something that's not in your control, you still try your best with your buddies anyway. For example, in the second movie—"
Cas nodded. "I'm aware," he said. "I was planning to take the radio up Topaz as soon as the snow lightens, to call your people to let them know you're here. Would they receive my transmission, do you think?"
It had been a little unusual for him to scoop the thing up and bring it all the way back here. Dean had long gotten over the impulse to collect miscellaneous stuff from the tundra. Everybody went through that phase early on, the tundra-scavenger phase, but by about his third season Dean had realized that there were only so many caribou antlers, stray hunters' arrows and fox skulls that one could collect. Caribou antlers in particular were always the irresistible tundra-souvenir (so much so that Flight 143 even allowed them as carry-on luggage), with freshly shed ones scattered around temptingly every spring. But these days, whenever Dean found a good antler he just brought it back to camp, to put in the antler-stack by the parking lot for the new grad students to pick through. The only souvenir Dean had been planning on holding on to this year was the little antler Sam had found, and he was only holding onto that because Sam wanted it.
"And if he does, I'm going to ask him if he might be willing to drive here sometimes while you finish out your school year. It's only a few months more. He's on the road a lot, you know; he and Sam do a lot of trips west anyway. I thought, maybe he could come visit? Once a week or something? Till summertime, and then in summer... well, we can figure something out for summer. Till then, would you mind if he dropped by sometimes?"
The problem was that you eventually had to fall asleep.
But then again, Cas should be fine tonight. He's been fine for several nights. It was really only that one night, the Monday night, not even a full week ago, when he'd seriously been in trouble.
All of it. Everything they had shared; everything they ever would share. With the last of Dean's strength, he sent it all to Cas.
"Enough of this," growled Raphael, and he staggered to his feet and backed away. He was leaking silver light from at least four places.
"What works?" said Castiel.
Cas's clothes start changing. The trenchcoat and suit have suddenly gotten dry-cleaned at one point; they're both spotless all of a sudden, the mudstains totally gone. Cas also has a new (spotless) white shirt, and the blue-striped tie is completely gone too, replaced with a solid blue tie a little more like the original one. He's not wearing the blue vest back and forth, either — he's apparently only using that at work now, and he's acquired a couple other shirts and a rather nice-looking short jacket that somewhat startles Dean with its snappiness.
Dean and Sam look at each other. "Thursday?" Sam mouths to Dean. And something starts pinging at Dean's memory.
"Safer if we burn it," pointed out Dean.
Keeping Dean safe.
"I'd love to learn to cook," he says. "I think I could do it. This whole... experience... has taught me just how important good health is. And good nutrition." (He darts a glance at Dean.) "You just follow a set of instructions, right?"
"I've been planning to burn them," he said. "There's no reason to keep clipped feathers. They have no power. And if certain... if certain colleagues found them, they might put them to ill use, and I have reason to believe I may be seeing those colleagues soon. Also..." He paused. "It's not a good memory for me anyway. I mean, seeing these clipped feathers just reminds me of.... well, of the incident when they were clipped."
They're in a booth at a diner just a few blocks from the motel. Sam's sitting in front of a big chicken salad that he's barely touched, scribbling things on the little pad of scratch paper that he always carries around for making notes on cases. And Dean, sitting across from him, is about halfway through a burger.
Then his gaze slid down. Down Dean's body... and back up.
Dean had gone totally mute.
At last he looks up at Dean and says, quite gravely, "I'm sorry I can't do more for you. I can't tell you how much I regret it."
Dean obeyed, stripping in the dark woods. Or rather, he tried to strip. His jeans, undershirt and flannel shirt were all frigid and soaking, like layers of abrasive wet ice on his skin, and the buttonholes now seemed stiff and unyielding. Between his increasingly strong shivering and his numb fingers, he couldn't even un-button the very first button on the flannel shirt.
"And if we'll ever get home," added Cas softly, breaking eye contact with Dean to look around at the millions of glowing threads. Dean, following his gaze, realized Cas was right; for where was the thread they'd rode in on? They would never find it again. Even when Cas had first skidded to a stop, they'd already lost track of which thread was which.
"Oh man, you are really not getting it," Dean says, and now it's his turn to take a step closer and grab both Cas's shoulders. "You really don't have any idea what you're worth, do you?"
DEAN GUILT - Poor Dean. Though a lot of this fic involved watching poor bby Cas suffer, there was an equal component of Dean suffering as well. It really was rough on him having to face what he'd really done when he'd abandoned Cas. I thought it would be Cas-like, too, if Dean's big "I'm guilty and I suck" speech got interrupted by Cas INSTANTLY and completely forgiving him. Cas could have been bitter, and could have let Dean stew; but it seemed Cas-like, and angel-like (Cas's brand of "good-angel" that is), for Cas to offer forgiveness instead. Ever since Cas first said "You don't believe you deserve to be saved" to Dean, way back when they met, it's been clear that Cas knows how guilty Dean feels, and I thought it would be fitting for Cas to finally offer Dean some angelic absolution.
you?" he said, his arm slowly dropping to his side. "What?"
, thought Dean, remembering Bobby's last hours.
Cas is even eating again. Dean's been sitting by his side tonight at dinner, feeling almost light-headed with relief just to see Cas slowly, but steadily, eating a small plate of Jody's delicious Friday night dinner — rosemary roast chicken, mashed potatoes, and perfectly-done peas swimming in butter and a bit of pepper. Cas has now gotten to a small slice of excellent pumpkin pie that Claire and Alex have somehow whipped up, and though it's a very small slice,
He closed his eyes, frowning a little. Dean did his best to stay quiet.
Oh, I'm so very sorry, Dean, I shouldn't have forced you to let me be intimate with you before you were ready. I didn't want to let another chance go by. I'm sorry."
really a surprise to hear Cas's voice instead of yours, but using your phone, ha ha!" Crowley starts trotting down the stairs, still talking over his shoulder up to Dean. "You know, I almost didn't pick up when the phone rang—"
"Oshossi," said Sam. The name burst out of him as if he'd been waiting for permission to say it. "You're Oshossi, aren't you? I read about you. The blue-and-yellow. The bow and arrow, and the bull's tail. You're the orisha of the hunt."
Obviously the spider-demon-thing must've got Cas, but how exactly? Was the spider-demon still alive? Was it still out there?
Dean can still hear the slightly embarrassed tone in Cas's voice.
"Will do," said Dean, grinning. "If I ever see him again."
It's becoming clear that Cas takes a real pleasure in finding shows that were released after that weird, brain-invading moment he'd had with Metatron. Dean's getting the impression that by watching these new shows for himself, seeing the plots unfold in real time, Cas maybe is able to feel a little more independent of all the awful things that Metatron (and, by extension, the other angels) have done to him over the years.
They had barely gotten settled in the feather-saddles when Cas sprang into the air. Soon they were spiraling upwards, Cas's strong black wings beating the air powerfully on each side. Soon he'd outstripped the other three angels, climbing dizzyingly high.
They'd made it.
Sam was still staring at the little map of Jupiter.
"Good," said Cas. He then added with a worried tone, as he frog-marched Dean through the chilly night, "Now we have to find shelter."
Dean could only shrug. "Kind of losing my mind, I think," he said.
"Not what I'm looking for right now," Dean says, as he rummages around deep in the duffel. Soon he pulls out a long, thin box. "There," he says with satisfaction, and he pries open the box, studies the contents thoughtfully, and lifts out a long, glossy white feather. "I brought some extras. Not alula-feathers, but I thought they might do the trick for... y'know... other stuff. If you feel up to it?"
sorry," Cas said. "I'm so very sorry."
“And that is the
Poor kid still just didn't really get it.
It was a beautiful drive. Sometimes the Montana passes could be pretty dicey in winter, but today they'd been lucky with the weather; the snowstorm that had passed through yesterday had only dropped a few inches, the snowplows had sprung into action, and road conditions were perfect now. I-90 was dry as a bone. The mountain vistas, though, were spectacularly snowy. The sky was crystal blue, the sun bright, the dark trees and snowy world beautiful. Cas even sat up a little again and looked out when Dean started remarking about how beautiful it was.
Dean's fault for getting suckered into Jack's bright-eyed innocent-son act. Dean's fault for getting attached. Dean's fault for letting Jack cloud his judgment.
"Right behind me and grab on around my waist," Dean instructed.
with it. Dean skips over that part of the puzzle — surely Cas could figure out what to do. He'd come up with some Enochian chant or something. Dean goes on to picturing the next step: the feather would probably start to glow, and maybe then Cas would have one of those spectacular shiny silver glowy moments. And when the glow faded... magically he'd be healed.
and the UV-fluorescent paint flared into view, the whole devil's trap glowing in eerie violet-white lines around Crowley's feet.
That's the first in a long string of what seem to be self-improvement efforts of various types. Sam finds Cas wandering around the bunker gym one day, and Dean even catches Cas weighing himself on the Men of Letters' old-style scale, clad in nothing but a t-shirt and boxers, sliding the little weights carefully along the balance arm. Again Cas jumps about a foot in the air when Dean surprises him, and there's something almost comical about how fast he lunges to grab a towel to wrap around himself (even though he already had the t-shirt and boxers on). "Relax, dude, I only saw your
Some time later Dean wakes in the dark. Cas is still right next to him, though they've both shifted position; Cas is now spooning Dean, his arm draped heavily over Dean's waist.
"You do?" says Dean, a little startled.
They were grotesquely bare. Stubby and short and completely bare.
"I'd like to bring him too," Dean confessed. "We were even just talking about doing a road trip together. But... he's met this Ruby chick, he's got this job possibility... I guess I should just leave him alone? Let him find his own path." He shook his head. "Damn, though, I wish I could figure out some way to get him to come along."
Dean looked shocked. "I thought you were doing okay?"
Dean's fingers tighten on the wheel, and he says, his voice suddenly a lot gruffer, "Okay, let's get something straight here. I'm not 'dropping you off' in the middle of
Cas looked at him a long moment. "You would do all that when we've only known each other a few weeks?"
Cas is alarmingly still.
It was gone.
," Sam whispered, elbowing him in the side. Dean glanced at him, and Sam added, in a low voice, "Just by the way, the staff at the hot springs place told me that the two wolves in California must've come all the way down from Oregon. If these are really the same wolves, that's, like, hundreds of miles."
"Would you like to come inside?" said Cas. Dean gave a jerky nod, and Cas held the door open while Dean walked the last few steps to the house.
He hesitated, one hand actually brushing the mud of the truck's dark side. Even the mud seemed surprising; Dean had somehow been expecting the polished mirror surface of a well-loved classic car.
rolling around naked on the bed. And if Dean's totally honest with himself, it's not the first time this has happened, either. There've been a few other moments, in the past. A few other times when a strange thrill of interest had gone twining through him, when he'd glanced over at Cas, in any one of the thousand strange settings they'd found themselves in. Cas in Purgatory, scruffy and dirty; Cas handing him the blade, in Heaven's green room; Cas's tousled hair, back in the barn when it had all started; Cas staring him down in a hundred different places, his blue eyes boring into Dean like lasers. Cas gazing at him just a few months ago, lunging at Dean with that sudden hug. Saying "I could go with you."
Though that night, "taking it easy" turns out to involve a huge meal of Christmas leftovers, a giddy round of heavily-spiked eggnog (Dean's managed to get hold of some rum by now at a little corner liquor store, and he gets a little carried away). Then there's a rowdy viewing of Die Hard — the all-time-great Christmas movie as far as Dean and Sam are both concerned, and it seems like this whole week is turning into one long extended Christmas. There's even a second round of present-opening. This round includes a replacement for Cas's white Christmas scarf (this turns out to have been the only unrecoverable casualty of the Christmas-Day bleedout, so Dean's bought an exact replacement); along with Lynyrd Skynyrd tape for Cas, containing the all-time classic live performance of "Free Bird". Sarah and Sam turn out to have accumulated quite a generous amount of thunderbird-themed mugs, bumper stickers and the like; and a hiking guide to the Grand Canyon appears (this, interestingly, is Sam's gift to Sarah), complete with a highlighted trail that apparently leads to a certain bluish-green pool of water. There's one last present too, one from Castiel to Dean: a lovely old vintage copy of "Winnie The Pooh" that he'd found in a secondhand bookstore.
The three men were drinking beers from a large cooler; they waved briefly at Marcos, nodded at Sam and Dean, and went on chatting in low tones to each other in some mellifluous language — Brazilian Portuguese, presumably.
Dean felt almost drunk with power. The next goal, of course, would be to get Cas flat on his back on the heather. This would require removing the ever-present backpack, and in the heat and thrill of the moment Dean entirely forgot that this might be an issue. Still drifting one hand lightly over Cas's dick, reaching deeper to fondle his balls lightly, exploring around his whole groin now (with Cas's breathing accelerating), Dean slid his free hand under one of Castiel's backpack straps, planning to slide the backpack off and set it aside.
camp, and these were
Sitting down just a couple feet away from Dean, he said, quite seriously, "I consider this whole disaster my fault. You were very kind to come looking for me. And you never would have tried to follow if I hadn't fled. I'm so sorry."
long enough. Couldn't it still work?"
Rowena starts chanting.
Dean did so, burrowing his hands down into the silken plumes of the dream-creature's neck. Bands of golden light flowed through all the feathers then, running across the creature in glittering waves, from the tip of its nose to, Dean knew somehow, the very end of its long plumed tail.
An instant silence falls.
. The days had flown by. It had been weeks since Cas's....
it's not charged enough," Cas replies. He's taking off his trenchcoat now, and the sight is oddly unsettling. It's like the angel is disappearing before their eyes — and the cancer patient reappearing. His thinness is all too apparent now, and some of his arm bruises are visible too. Claire even asks, with a worried frown, "What happened to your arms?"
Cas shakes his head, slowly. "I've been thinking it over, and I'm sure now that Chuck must have given me the soul-seed the last time he saw me, in that little bar. I felt something, then... And that was when he and Amara were still at each other throats, weren't they? I very much doubt they planned it together."
Dean said, cautiously, "Kids these days and their crazy slang, you know? It's so hard to keep up."
, when Cas was obviously so starved for sex. Not to mention he might need a little emotional support if he was really so brand-new at all this. Emotional support and, well, of course he'd need practice too. Lots of practice, lots and lots, which Dean could help him with. They'd only really done just a couple positions, up there on the heather. There were about a hundred other positions and permutations that Cas really needed to experience, ideally as soon as possible. (Dean would therefore have to experience it all too, which was a definite added bonus.) Had the poor guy ever even had a blow job? What Cas clearly needed first was about a hundred blow jobs immediately, and then he needed to feel what it felt like to pounded like that on the receiving end. (Oh and, he probably needed assistance with that crazy-religious-family issue as well, and the looming surgery on his back, and his freedom and everything. But blow jobs and pounding
"Where the hell
They lay there quiet in the night, Cas stroking Dean's hair, until at last Dean, exhausted, fell asleep once again.
Ryan didn't budge. "You
Hunts always involved a tedious amount of waiting around. This time, on this hunt (which Dean was now reasonably confident was a "real hunt" and not a "Chuck hunt") there was a long time waiting to see if the ghost would show. Sam had taken the Impala up the mountain to the cemetary; Dean was stationed at the bridge. Because Dean might have to deal with the ghost, he had the shotgun, loaded with rock salt as per usual, while Sam had taken the pistol. Getting cell service anywhere outside the town had been a persistent issue, but Sam reported that he still had a small speck of cell service in the cemetary, and though phone calls kept dropping, so far they'd been able to trade sporadic texts back and forth to coordinate.
He started shifting one leg, too, starting to hook it around Cas's hips again.
It was a long hike. Dean cradled the baby parrot in one hand as he walked, holding it against his shirt. (It slept the whole way.)
Cas just grins at him. "More like, now it's
Well, there were lots of reasons.
He looks unbearably pathetic, and so terribly exposed and helpless as he lies there, naked except for the tiny stretch of bloody sheet. Dean's horrified, and he can't help rushing over to Cas's side and calling his name, and trying to grasp his hand, but of course Dean's hand just sinks right through Cas's. Medical staff start to walk right through Dean — one's slipping little oxygen tubes under Cas's nose, another's slapping ECG leads to Cas's chest, one's swapping out the bloody sheet for a fresh one. A fourth one, a nurse, is carrying a fresh new IV bag of dark-red blood and she, too, cruises right through Dean as she starts hooking up the bag to Cas's IV line.
"Where'd they go?"
"When are we going to call him?" said Sam.
"We gotta make it count," say Sam. The sentence has a disturbing finality to it, as if this might be Cas's last good week ever. Sam fiddles with his beer, rotating the bottle in a little circle on the kitchen table, and adds, "I just meant—"
"That's not a chair."
"Where did you
"We'd be very grateful," said Sam. "Sirs."
Cas looked over at them both and said, "That element was new to me as well. Come on, you two. We have to get out of here. It's not over." He whispered something to Gabriel, who nodded. Gabriel took tight hold of one of Balthazar's shoulders, Cas gripped the other, and Gabriel murmured something. The flow of light from Balthazar's wounds seemed to dim a little, but the effort seemed to weaken both Gabriel (who crumpled to his knees, white-faced now), and Cas, who was also now weaving slightly on his feet. "Go," Cas murmured to Balthazar. "You've done enough. Go hide. And heal." Balthazar gave a quiet nod. The two others helped him to his feet, and then, oddly, they dropped their hands, backing away and leaving Balthazar unsupported. Balthazar was wobbling a little on his feet, but he stayed upright. His wings stretched out unevenly, and he met Dean's eyes.
Ryan's expression was cheerful. None of the camp staff knew how catastrophic Dean's storm adventure had nearly been, and none knew where he was headed now. All they knew was that Dean had gotten his truck stuck in the snow, had ended up "hanging out with the bird guy" for a few days, and that the university had approved his staying in his original dorm room for a few more days until the road cleared. Now that the Haul Road was clear, he'd just told them he was going camping to enjoy his remaining week of break, and that he'd be back shortly to help Shelly manage the big influx of June and July summer-season scientists.
of them failed. So I realized that if the Apocalypse were ever to occur, I would have to do something quite different. I admit I miss the sense of drama that such a battle would have provided..." He let out a regretful sigh. "We've all been looking forward to a Lucifer-Michael showdown, haven't we? But it clearly just wasn't
Sam glanced down at God's iPad, where
"Yes," says Cas. He doesn't elaborate.
"The Flagstaff doctors recommended a certain oncologist in Denver," Cas says, now apparently talking to his coffee mug. "Aaron Klein. That was how I met him. He does research on the most recent forms of chemotherapy for this stage of testicular cancer. And then I found that Gas-n-Sip does cover treatment in Denver, even for an employee in nearby states, but their health-care arrangements for employees don't begin till after thirty days of full-time employment. Also I knew by then that there'd be this cost called a deductible, an
Cas's voice got even weaker during the chant; Cas had talked far too much, Dean knew, and he resolved to make sure that Cas shut up and went back to sleep after this. Cas paused at one point, and Dean somehow knew, from a faint sound at the door, a change in the air of the room, and a shift in Cas's hands, that Sam had hesitantly poked his head in the door, seen that something important was going on, and that Sam had gotten an "It's okay, but give us a moment," glance from Cas, and had retreated.
Well, maybe it'd been an
"He's so bad already," Sam whispers to Dean. "And it's only been, like, one hour. How long did you say this goes on for? I mean, how long did it go on last week?"
, Dean thought, and then he couldn't hold Cas's eyes. Confused and embarrassed, he grabbed the nearest fur and pulled it over his waist. He then tried to turn the move into a more normal throwing-on-a-robe, as if he were just casually getting out of bed in the morning, and ended up sitting up on the edge of the "bed" (which, he was slowly realizing, was simply a huge pile of heaped furs) as he awkwardly pulled a soft spotted fur around his waist.
