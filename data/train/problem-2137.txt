"Oh Mountain!" I lifted my tenants' considerably large cat from where she was lapping at the milk in the cream jug. Mr Holmes was replacing the milk jug after using it for some experiment or another. I heard two taps of his cane and then he called her
"It was absolutely delicious, John. A straight left against a slogging ruffian. I emerged as you see me" What I saw was a deep cut over one eyebrow and a split down the centre of Sherlocks lip. I was not. Pleased. "Who are you more angry at?" My Gem's voice un-entranced me and enchanted me completely differently. I kissed his forehead.
"Right you are but I'm afraid mine are" Dr Watson's voice never gave me such a turn! "My standards are fair and Sherlock Holmes meets them. Look at the rings on his hand."
(Mrs Hudson's POV)
(Watson POV)
"We're taking the case because he wants it now I advise you to leave" Dr Watson's voice changed somewhat to correct himself "I order you to leave" I may have let slip a smile at Mr Holmes weakening at the knees.
Though I heard a thud that made Mountain quite puzzled.
"And my Doctor is back" Sherlock smiled and laughed a bit into the glass. "Mr Woodley was taken home in a cart".
"Sherl-" My answer, which would have been a firm 'Health First' one, was cut short by Mrs Hudson coming along the corridor with a charming young lady in an entirely blue outfit. She looked fit to have been pulled from a fairytale and knew it well. Her face held that resignation that some poor girls are due to feel when constantly stared at by passing boys. She went straight over to Sherlock and looked at his hand.
A hand touches his wrist, pressing lightly, before fading.
But oh, how he wants to.
He's home.
On those nights, John would sleep well.
And now he waits.
Behind him, the machine set to monitor him begins to beep erratically.
, remember? Ordinary people try to get on with their lives after the death of a loved one.”
The steps approach, a crisp staccato. He's two meters away.
would stop shaking as he walks.
Do what, exactly?
Sherlock's legs ache when he finally reaches the watering hole. A small number of animals crowd the small pond, none of which pose much of a threat to him. He dives almost head first to the ground next to the pool, scaring away the few fauna that remain. The dirty water is more delicious than the finest wine, more invigorating than any cup of tea John ever made for him.
“John, I need you,” he states, leaving no room for argument. John hesitates just a moment longer before relenting, releasing Sherlock's face and settling back into the chair. Sherlock immediately returns to the task at hand, slipping his fingers into John's pants to touch his rapidly hardening member. John sighs contentedly, touching Sherlock again unconsciously, fingers blazing trails over his head and neck. Sherlock arches into the touch like a cat, starved for attention. John chuckles lowly.
The smell of home.
“I need an ordinary person's perspective on this,” he explains. At John's wry expression he lets out a beleaguered sigh. “John, for the last time, ordinary is not an insult when it comes to you,”
. In flesh and blood. His John, who isn't scolding him the way he imagined. His John, who isn't avoiding touching him the way he imagined. His John, who, despite everything, is here, with Sherlock, in this hospital, carding his fingers through his hair, lulling him into a sleepy haze. Sherlock reaches for John's free hand, tugging it to his lips to kiss each finger in turn. His nails are torn short to the quick, the skin angry and red around each fingertip. Stress coping mechanism. Sherlock tangles his own fingers with John's, cradling the hand to his chest. John spares him a glance and a ghost of a smile. Sherlock drinks it in intently.
Sherlock doesn't sleep that night. Instead, he stays awake. Watches John sleep. Touches him freely like a starving man eats, though never anything untoward. Nothing unexplainable to John should he wake. Just innocent taction. The need to feel the way a child does. Reacquainting himself with the shape of John. With the texture of his skin. With the thickness of each hair strand.
“How lovely to see you, brother mine,” Mycroft greets. Sherlock shows no signs of having heard him.
“Are you sure this will help?” he asks breathlessly. His face is already tinged pink and Sherlock can't help but lick his lips at the flush. John's eyes track the sight hungrily.
Infinity with ghostly touches and echoed voices. Sherlock thinks he could live with that. At least he won't be entirely alone.
He wonders if Mycroft is telling John what happened.
“Of course, John,” A squeeze of his arm accompanies the statement. John makes a humming noise and turns to burrow his nose into Sherlock's neck. Sherlock scarcely breaths for fear of fully waking his doctor. His chest aches at the familiarity of the action. He needs John to be
Yet he has.
“I want to see John,”
The jumper. It's the one Sherlock himself bought for John at Christmas years before. Well worn, sandy beige. Highest quality wool money could buy. John never used to wear it. Said it was too expensive to wear about the flat. Why was he wearing it now?
Sherlock is impatient. Has always been impatient. But more so when it comes to John. Mycroft calls him childish and selfish. Those traits are twofold when it comes to John. His doctor can simultaneously bring out the best and the worst in him. The more days pass without John making a move on him, the worse he gets. He begins to do anything to get John to look at him more, to touch him more. Complaining of the cold in his room so John stays the night in his bed. Pretending he can't lift himself from his chair so John helps him up. Lounging in nothing but his thin robe and pants, legs slung out on the couch so John can't help but stare at the slim, milky length of them.
The words echo around inside his head as he wakes. 'Come home'. Such an easy thing to say. Not an easy thing to do. Not after how he had left.
He manages to trudge another few miles before exhaustion overtakes him and he collapses, the faint ribbons of sunrise beginning to peer over the horizon.
He wakes slowly, eyelashes fanning on Sherlock's collarbone while he blinks the sleep from his eyes. His legs disentangle from Sherlock's, and his body rolls slightly away. Sherlock feels at a loss as the chill of the morning hits his chest. He keeps his own arm firmly around the blond, trapping him as close as he can while feigning sleep. John makes no move to escape, however, seemingly content to stay in Sherlock's arms. The detective doesn't dare open his eyes. Refuses to break whatever magic is happening.
Where the real John is.
Obviously.
“Okay,” John finally says, clapping his hands onto his legs. “I think I about get it,”
“John,” he croaks, vision blurry, voice watery, “John I'm home but I'm not and you aren't there and there's only white and Mycroft and sad people and sick people and I told Mycroft I needed you but he said you wouldn't come--”
Even if it is all just in his head.
Not that he has much to live for now. John has almost certainly found a new lover at this point. Sherlock has tried to keep track of the time, but lost track at 14 months, 23 days, when he was captured and held underground for an extended period of time. The Afghan soldiers mistook him as an American spy and attempted to ransom him to their government. It was only thanks to Mycroft that he managed to escape as quickly as he had.
The nurse straps him into bed when he's back in the room. Not that he needs the restraints. He's not going to run away again. Not now that he's home.
Words he had never said out loud to John, but wishes he had. There's lots of things he knows he should have said. Would they have made a difference in the end? Sherlock doesn't know. He doesn't like not knowing.
Endless desert sweeps before him. Sherlock doesn't know how long he's been walking for, or how long it's been since he last drank water, but he keeps on. He's been undercover for months on end, trying to find the missing links of Moriarty. Yet every string he has followed, every bit of ash and debris that he found the stink of Moriarty on, has lead to a dead end. His newest expedition to Afghanistan had been a bust, just like all the others. He had thought that perhaps going to where John had been stationed would bring leads...
Moriarty clicks his tongue chastisingly.
“John,” he croaks, voice hitching. The hand moves down his face, gripping his jaw and pulling him forwards.
“A query, John,” he starts. John raises an eyebrow at him before sitting in his own chair. “If someone were to fake their own death, then come back to tell you it was fake years after, would you be upset?”
“Sherlock, what's wrong?” his doctor asks, immediately caressing his face. John sets the computer to the side and leans forward, elbows on his knees. He makes hushing noises as his thumbs begin to sweep under Sherlock's eyes. “Love, why are you crying?” Sherlock stiffens, unaware of the tears leaking steadily down his face.
He knows this, of course, but its ramifications have not truly been felt up until this moment in time. Still, he doesn't need some ghostly voice of John reminding him.
His hands reach unconsciously for his doctor, pulling their faces together. He kisses John's snickers away. John caresses his cheeks lovingly, face still split into a smile despite everything. Sherlock gazes at him, his only love. His one person he would go to hell and back for. And Sherlock knows that John feels the same way. Their relationship is patched with bandages and tape. Fragile still, but together all the same. All that matters now is that he's here. He's back in London. Back in 221B.
. Because of Sherlock.
Sherlock isn't quite sure how long he's been in his mind palace. Days pass in 221B. He wakes later the same evening in bed, a warm arm draped loosely over his waist. Twisting to the side, he can see the silhouette of his doctor, sleeping soundly. John used to have nightmares, still does, but not the same way. Sherlock remembers being woken up, pinned to the bed by his neck, John's eyes glazed over, unseeing. It had been a long moment before John realized that the person touching his face, calling his name out, was not an enemy. He had been so sad that day. Sherlock remembers it bitterly. John tries not to remember.
.” He grips John's hand to the point of pain, but John says nothing, lost in thought. The fist loosens slightly.
Who's speaking to him? The voice is so familiar, but he can't put a finger on it.
The sharp feeling of a slap lights up his cheek. Sherlock stops, lifting a hand to it. John is standing before him.
Sherlock groans through the water in his mouth, gasping for air after drinking his fill. The water leaves grains of sand in his teeth. Coats his throat in grit. At least his tongue feels relatively normal again.
. I went to your
“Only when it comes to you,” he tells the man. John moves below his arm, waking partially. He blinks blearily at the detective.
The blond hushes him with a soft kiss. His eyes are sad when he pulls away.
“There we go, now, back to bed with you,” the voice tells him, but Sherlock isn't listening. He can see out the window now. Can recognize the silhouette of those buildings anywhere. He knows where he is. He's in London.
Occasionally he can sense a hand touching him as he walks. Feels lips touching his skin. Hears a familiar laugh ring out in the silence. He knows he's going mad.
“You think that after two years, he will just accept that?”
“Alright there, Sherlock?” he asks sleepily, rubbing at his eyes. Sherlock slinks his arm farther around him, tightening his grip. He no longer feels the ghostly touch. Real John is here. His lips graze John's hair, as he knows for this moment it is fine. Knows sleep-addled John is soft and forgiving.
Memories rush back to Sherlock. John, with a bomb strapped to his chest, laser dots marking every inch of his face. Sherlock, helpless but to listen to Moriarty. Bart's hospital. Sherlock's letter.
“I need to see him. Tell him I'm not dead,” Mycroft huffs out a laugh.
The kiss starts off chaste, just a brief press of lips in greeting. As their lips part, Sherlock lunges  after them. They meet again more hungrily. Sherlock breathes John in as if he's oxygen. How has he survived so long without John? How did he survive before? His tongue presses in, mapping out the shape of the other's mouth before tangling with John's. His doctor makes a surprised noise before reciprocating in earnest. The hand is back in his hair, gripping firmly this time, and another snakes around his hips, pressing their growing hardnesses together. Sherlock breaks the kiss with a moan before gripping John's lower lip in his teeth and sucking it in his mouth. John's eyes flick open, pupils blown wide with lust.
Chapped lips touch his cheek, barely there. Breath cascades over his face. Sherlock can't tell if he's imagining this or not, the touch is so faint. The lips press to the corner of his mouth. Sherlock stops breathing. Hopes John won't notice. That John is real.
“Such a demanding thing you are,” he muses, scraping his nails on the detective's scalp gently. Sherlock hums in agreement as he pulls John from his clothes and leans forward, his breath cascading gently over the throbbing hardness. His hand strokes it gently, bringing it to full hardness, before he drags the flat of his tongue up the length of it. John's breath stutters, his head falling back. The hand in his hair clenches and unclenches, pulling his hair pleasantly. Sherlock trails his tongue over the tip, circling it slowly. He takes his time. He has all the time in the world here. No amount of John's urging hands will make him go faster. He wants, no he
Sherlock blinks in the darkness. He knows that name.
He's finally going insane. Maybe that's what this is.
Sherlock burrows further into the warm shape before him, running his nose along John's hairline and pressing the faintest kiss to the nape of his neck. His arm tightens around John's waist, feeling the soft curves of his doctor. John makes a sleepy noise of awareness. Sherlock only squeezes tighter.
“Short version,” Sherlock murmurs, “Not dead.”
“How many times must I explain to you, John?” Sherlock cries, turning around to face the other man.
“John,” he says, hearing the panic in his own voice as the other man is severed in half, mist swirling up out of the wound. “John!”
John crooks his fingers inside Sherlock. Sherlock spasms at the sudden movement, the wave of pleasure finally crashing over him. He shudders as he spills between them, virtually untouched. John is kissing his face. Sherlock is crying.
“I need to see my brother,” he tells the nurse, his voice scarcely there. They pause in their leaving to give him a nod, then are gone.
'Me neither,' Sherlock thinks back to the voice, 'But I'm glad you did.'
“That's it, John,” he murmurs to his doctor, “Come for me,”
Sherlock knows this is a dream. Knows he still exists out in the desert. But he wishes it weren't.
it's a hallucination. John smiles sadly at him, pressing a ghostly hand to his inflamed cheek, almost like an apology.
” he babbles, voice cutting in and out as he speaks. John shushes him.
“P—please, John,” he gets out, voice whingy even to his own ears. John's smile turns devious as he turns Sherlock's face back to his, kissing him firmly. After pulling away, he presses his fingers to the brunet's mouth. Sherlock sucks the fingers in eagerly, coating them liberally with saliva.
, Sherlock. What makes you think he will be so willing to come when I call?”
Sherlock steps out into the hallway, picking a direction at random, and begins to walk slowly down it. The door to his room swings softly shut behind him. All he needs is a window. Just one glimpse of the outside world, to know for sure where he is right now. If only his
“Sherlock, I only want to help you,” Mycroft chides.
Sherlock grips his hair, tugging as hard as he dares to get Moriarty out. His voice seeps under his skin like a poison.
Sherlock stops fidgeting. Stares at John in rapt attention.
'Come for me,' Sherlock's eyes command as he takes John all the way in and swallows around him. John swears as a moan is ripped from his throat and suddenly he's shuddering, spurting into Sherlock's mouth. The brunet pulls back slightly so as not to choke himself as the hot liquid hits his tongue. He continues sucking, milking John for all he's worth. John's eyes are still glazed over as Sherlock slips his now soft member from his mouth and surges up to kiss his doctor. He wants John to taste himself on his tongue, to know just who it is can bring him this much pleasure. He needs John to remember that he can do something for him. Only Sherlock will ever know him this well, will ever be able to take him apart until he begs for release.
Sherlock often ignored it.
John warms up to him again slowly, but surely. After a couple more days, he doesn't recoil from Sherlock's casual touches. A few more days, he's initiating a few of his own. The simple touches make Sherlock's blood thrum through his veins. Knuckles grazing over his cheekbones. Hand pressing softly into the small of his back. Fingers threading with the hair at the nape of his neck. Sherlock is preening under any attention.
” he repeats as the wind whisks him away. Sherlock is left staring at the empty desert before him, an empty feeling in his core. His entire body aches, he realizes. The hunger and the desert are finally catching up to him. He stumbles as he takes his next step, falling heavily to his knees. The desert sun beams down on him, and the sand below him feels like fire.
“John,” he calls softly, lifting himself from his reclined state. The sounds from the kitchen halt, and John's head pops out around the corner. He's gotten a haircut since Sherlock last laid eyes on him, and he's changed clothes, but the lines still remain on his face. The tiredness still rests in his eyes. Sherlock wonders if he's slept since they returned to 221B. Wonders how long he himself has been asleep.
Back to the real London.
Mycroft's smile drops from his face at the words. His eyes go stony.
“Don't be stupid John, no one has,” he replies, seeing Mycroft's face twist in concern at his words. Sherlock's brain stutters to a halt and his expression closes off.
He still doesn't know if John will ever forgive him.
“I don't see how that's any of your concern,” he spits, staring intently at a spot of peeling paint on the wall. His fingernails dig crescent shaped marks into his palms.
“Sure sounds like one,” John fires back.
Army doctor. Captain in the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. Trained at St. Bart's hospital. Served three years in Afghanistan. Excellent shot. Shoots with his right hand, despite being left handed. Doesn't take sugar in his tea. Isn't afraid of his brother. Sherlock's moral compass.
His next kiss goes right beneath his jawline, and he traces the carotid artery down towards his doctor's chest. John is wearing a loose shirt that Sherlock has tried to toss on many occasions, offering to buy John three in its place. John is a simple man, he says, and doesn't need Sherlock to spend the money on him.
“Then come home,”
Sherlock kisses down to the stretched out neck of the shirt before sliding a hand up John's stomach to display more of his beautiful body.
John gives him a bland look. “This is all hypothetical, clearly.” His voice drips with sarcasm. Sherlock waves the comment away with an impatient hand.
, to take John apart right now, piece by piece. His lips wrap around the head and he sucks lightly, pumping his hand along the length. He hears John hiss his name above him, but pays him no mind for now. He won't listen until John can't pronounce his name.
Sherlock stares at John, wordlessly. A shocked laugh escapes him. More follow, until Sherlock is doubled over, giggling hysterically. He feels intoxicated. Drunk on relief. Drunk on John.
Gathering himself, Sherlock gets to his feet unsteadily. His body feels much heavier than it had before his little siesta. He must find water soon. His tongue no longer feels moist, and is more akin to a dry sponge laying in his mouth.
,” John's ghostly voice reminds him. Sherlock scoffs. What did it matter the way those simple fools looked at him? The only person who is—who was worth his time is John. Sherlock still has trouble forming in words his feelings for his doctor. His emotions towards John always preceded simple
, he's so
He knows he's stayed too long.
Sometimes taking John apart piece by agonizing piece wasn't enough. Sometimes John screaming his name into the pillow at night sounded like someone else's name. Sometimes Sherlock could swear John was looking a
A window.
“Take you apart, surely. But harm you? Definitely out of the question.”
“How am I supposed to come home?” he asks, pushing himself to his feet. “You'll hate me if I come home,”
Raising his hands, Sherlock slid one around John's waist, the other threaded into his hair. He felt the doctor start at the suddenness of his actions, but proceeded regardless. His lips crushed into John's, memorizing their size and shape. Snaking out his tongue, Sherlock licked along the line of John's mouth, enticing a startled gasp from the smaller man. Taking advantage of his parted lips, Sherlock slid his tongue in, mapping the inside of John's mouth. He wanted to know everything about John, and this was just one more thing to excel at.
In the distance, an alarm sounds. Soft, but steadily growing louder. Sherlock walks towards it. Knows not what else to do.
“Not good?”
“John, are you really here? I'm so sorry. I can explain everything to you. You're so warm. You must be real. Please don't go, again. John, I was so alone.
“You didn't seem to care about my well being when you buggered off for two years,” John spits. Sherlock sighs heavily.
“You're awake,” John says, crossing the room to him. He presses a cool hand to Sherlock's forehead. “You still have a fever. Are you hungry? I can warm some soup,”
Instead, he repositions himself to the floor in front of his John, laying his head and arms on his lap. John's hand instinctually begins petting his hair. Sherlock can't bring himself to leave.
John finally speaks. Barely audible. Just one word.
, Sherlock, that's
“Sherlock,”
John is merciless in his onslaught, slipping a second finger in to work Sherlock open, brushing his prostate with almost every thrust. Sherlock can do nothing but rock himself between the fingers and John's cock. His senses feel overloaded. John grasps his jaw with his free hand and crushes their lips together. The detective moans into his mouth, feeling himself teetering on the brink. Then John stops. Stops moving, stops kissing. Sherlock sobs in loss. John's eyes are dark.
When Sherlock wakes, it's dark. His side aches, and his clothes are filled with even more sand than before. Pushing himself into a seated position, he concludes that he must have fainted from exhaustion. He frowns. Why was he even dreaming of being with John? It's only extending his pain at their separation. His eyes sting, and he brings a hand up to rub at them, finding his face damp. Tears. He can't afford the loss of more water from his body; not if he wants to make it out of this accursed desert alive.
” He's breathing hysterically now. Sherlock stays quiet. “You know what I said to your grave afterwards?” John asks him. Sherlock shakes his head. “Don't be dead. I asked you for one more miracle, for me. How could you do that to me?”
“Oh, I get it,” Mycroft groans, “This is you pouting about almost dying in the desert. Well, it wasn't my idea for you to go out there, Sherlock. You've only yourself to blame for that whole mes--”
Four hundred, seventy-six. Four hundred, seventy-seven.
Sherlock surges forward in desperation, only to have his leg buckle under him, casting him to the floor. He lands in a heap with a loud
” Sherlock scowls, but heaves himself to his weary feet. He'll walk to a safer place, then he can rest.
He waits. What for, he's not sure. But still, he waits.
He feels the brush of fingers on his arm, just momentarily, and whips his head to the left. Only barren wastes greet him. A warm puff of air in his ear makes the hair on the back of his neck stand up, and he slaps his hand to his neck, rubbing self consciously. He can feel eyes watching him, but the desert is flat all around for miles.
“John,” he croaks, leaning into the hand that has moved to cup his cheek. His throat feels like fire when he speaks. His sight blurs as tears roll down his cheeks. John smiles tiredly at him.
'Petulant child,' says the traitorous voice in his head one evening as he lays in bed, John beside him but not touching him. 'He's obviously not interested in you like that anymore.' Sherlock's nails dig angry red crescents into his palms. John just needed time. Sherlock could give him that. Sherlock would give John anything.
He kisses John over Chinese take-out one night weeks in, unable to stop himself. John is obviously shaken. Sherlock apologizes. John's lips taste of sweet and sour. Sherlock wants to kiss him again.
John wakes with the sun. Military training, even now.
, thrusting into Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock relaxes to let the blond fuck into his mouth. Had been expecting it to happen. John always get to a point where he can't control the movement of his hips, and Sherlock craves him passing it.
John could tell that Sherlock was hurt by his dismissive reply, it actually pained him a little to see the boy so disheartened. He did not like having to give Sherlock the cold shoulder, but he had promised himself that he would not compromise his position as a teacher – not until Sherlock was not long a pupil of his at least. He just wished he knew how to tell Sherlock that his withdrawal was not a genuine attempt to distance each other.
"There's not a lot to tell really" Sherlock said.
John leant over and gave Sherlock a chaste kiss on the forehead. “I guess this is when we should say goodbye.” They had both agreed that they should sit in different carriage as they approached their final stop, so that they could exit separately.
“True, that was quite a day. You definitely took to the city environment” John smiled.
"You mean that?" Sherlock asked, hoping John wasn't just being polite.
John looked up as Sherlock pulled over a chair and sat opposite him. "Oh hello Sherlock, how are you finding the museum?"
Mycroft paused briefly as he tried to remember the other boys in his brother’s year. “Not John Dun by any chance? His brother Tyler was in my Law class.”
For one of the first times in the last five or so years, John Watson was able to spend his Christmas with a sober sister. Christmas was always a difficult time for Harriet Watson and normally she hid herself away from her brother when times were rough. John had thought it best to have Harry over to his for dinner, just so he could make extra sure there were no hidden bottles she could reach for. It was ever so slightly unnerving for John to see his sister so well (she was nearly at seven months of sobriety), almost as if he were standing around a repaired vase, hoping it wouldn’t fall again. Nonetheless, it was good to see his sister so well and John decided to put his doubts aside for once and just appreciate her company. The pair quickly fell into conversation, both having a lot to fill the other in on, and naturally, the subject of romantic interests came up.
Fortunately for Sherlock the drive to the train station wasn’t long and they were soon pulling into the drop off zone. Sherlock slung his rucksack across his back, gave a quick “thank you” to Mycroft and shot off towards the station entrance.
“Sherlock you can call it part of the birthday treat.” John justified, adding with a smile “and if it really bothers you my birthday is the 7th July”.
“We really are a sentimental pair aren’t we” he chuckled, “now come on, mother is expecting us”.
“Wow, that was fascinat -…” Sherlock trailed off as he saw the accused’s defence lawyer entering the near-by male toilets. “Actually, will you excuse me a second.” He added and shot off behind the lawyer.
John swatted Sherlock's arm with the textbook he had paused marking in order to watch the teen eat. "I know that. It's just I don't think I've ever seen you eat before, I thought you just survived on carbonated drinks and chewing gum."
After she let there was a brief pause, both worried what the other was going to say. Sherlock was the first to laugh, but it was more of a giggle really. This was quickly picked up by John and the pair laughed in unison as the exited the pub.
It was the first day back since the class trip to London that previous Friday and Sherlock was feeling more than a little apprehension. It was as if they pair had shared a moment of intimacy with one another, but now had to go back to pretending that they were no more than teacher and student. Sherlock was eager not to overstep a line with John, he was his student after all and Sherlock did not want to let a schoolboy crush affect the career of someone he care about. As usual he waited for the lunch bell to ring out before heading over to John’s room, he had always thought it would be best to give it a little time so that all of John’s students had filed out of the classroom before he entered himself. Today was no different to the many other times he had spent his lunches with John, however Sherlock could tell instantly that something was not quite wrong with John. In the days before their trip to London Sherlock had noticed that John would brighten up the minute Sherlock stepped through the door and more often than not would put aside whatever he was doing to engage in conversation with him. However, when Sherlock entered the biology classroom this time he watched as John called out a quick ‘hello’ without taking his eyes away from his pile of books to be marked. Sherlock observed that this was more than likely a forced effort not to look directly at Sherlock as it was an obvious change in John’s usual behaviour. Why he did not want to be seen to look directly at Sherlock he did not know, and he didn’t like not knowing. He decided to hope that he was just overlooking John’s reaction and make causal conversation.
"Well, if you want," John quickly checked the time on his phone, "it's only 1:17 and we don't catch the train back until 4:30, so, I could take you to see a little more of London?"
John shot Sherlock a look that said Sherlock-you-are-brilliant-but-please-be-aware-that-we-are-in-a-live-court-trial-and-you-cannot-shout-out. This was followed by one of the court bailiffs giving Sherlock a much shorter shut-the-hell-up look. The pair decided to leave as the courtroom adjourned for lunch. Both keen to see just a little more of London before they departed home.
He watched as Mycroft unwrapped the gift he had brought him, a pair of sterling cufflinks.
Sherlock was pleasantly surprised to see a look of wonder on the teacher's face. "That's not what people normally say."
"Hey Sherlock?" John queried, watching the younger man as he worked.
John grinned, “I booked them for the thirteenth of the month, your birthday”.
“John that would great.” Sherlock beamed, noticing John’s features relax into a smile.
After setting up the experiment, Sherlock sat back and waited for the chemical reaction he needed to take place. He decided to use the natural pause in his work to bring up to John the idea of meeting over the Christmas break.
“Dare I ask you to elaborate?” John questioned as the pair sat down at table in the far corner of the breakfast area. “Oh and before you ask, yes you are required to eat at least one thing for breakfast.”
As he exited the room, Mr. Watson caught him by the arm. "Sherlock, could I have a word?"
“Goodbye Sherlock.” John replied, giving him a final wave as he disappeared down the train.
"Probably the drugs again" Sherlock murmured, but to his horror, the entire class, including Mr. Watson, turned to look at him. Crap, he had meant to say that quieter.
“Here, I got you something Sherlock. I know you needed new one.” Mycroft said, handing Sherlock a small parcel.
John smiles softly and placed his hand on Sherlock's arm. "Well then, it's a good thing you have me. Anyway, you should be heading back to lessons; the bell should be going soon."
John laughed at Sherlock's expression. "Sherlock please, don't look so worried, you're welcome to call me John when we're out of class. That's what friends do right?"
John returned to his desk and pulled up the register as his tutorial class filed in. He hadn't meant to be so pathetic around Sherlock whilst they were talking about London, but John couldn't help it. Ever since he had been discharged from the army he desperately missed the excitement and adventure that came with being a soldier. Well, until he met Sherlock, that boy had lit a flicker of wonder inside John, what with his incredible intellect and the sense of mystery that followed him. 'Huh', the constant thrill-seeking part John thought, maybe he should go with Sherlock after all. John had to stop himself in his thoughts. It was not appropriate for a teacher to be thinking about one of his students like that. But Sherlock wasn’t just his student, John felt as if the pair had become good friends as they bonded over the last couple of weeks. John had thought that his lunchtime appointments with Sherlock would’ve raised a few eyebrows among the faculty, but the other teachers actually seemed grateful – apparently Sherlock was known to ruffle a few feathers around the school. John supposed that his colleagues were just pleased that he was able to mentor the younger Holmes and help keep him focused in classes. As long as no one questioned his budding friendship with Sherlock, John did not mind. He had grown very fond of the boy.
“Right, where would you like to go first?” John asked an honestly ecstatic Sherlock “I can show you the science labs or the tech rooms. I can even show you the morgue if you’re up for that.”
Sherlock's cheeks pinked, "Thank you John".
"Right class" John began, standing up to shut the door as the last student skidded in, "who here has been to the Natural Science Museum in London before?" A few hands grazed the air.
Sherlock found John sitting in the station café, he appeared lost thought over a lightly steaming coffee. John snapped out of it when he noticed Sherlock’s arrival. He gulped down the rest of his drink, pulling on his coat before exiting the café and heading out into the January air. For once a train to London was running on time and they didn’t have long to wait out on the platform edge. The train filled with people which delighted Sherlock as he was able to impress John with some basic deductions.
It was clear to Sherlock that John's denial of his appeal to the opposite sex wasn't a masked attempt to fish for complements, but rather a genuine failure to see the obvious. However, instead of trying to convince John otherwise, Sherlock thought it would be best just to keep quiet and not risk revealing just how attractive he found John to be. Sensing a slight awkward pause, John changed the subject to their trip to London and began to tell Sherlock about his own experiences at the Science Museum. The pair fell into natural conversation and before long found that they had reached King's Cross Station, all that was left to do was to hop on the underground for a few stops and then it was a short walk to the museum.
“Sherlock, do you really not get it?” John marvelled, “I’m not ashamed to be seen with you, I just don’t want to lose my job to idle gossip”.
Sherlock was caught up in the moment, his anxieties falling away. That was until John stopped smiling and stood still. Sherlock panicked, he had let himself get carried away. He dropped his head, not wanting to look John in the eye and waited for a rebuffal that never came. Instead John lifted Sherlock’s head up with a gentle push of his hand. John closed the gap between them by softly pulling Sherlock towards him. And then they kissed. Neither knowing who moved first as they both rushed to meet the other lips. It wasn’t until a group of teenagers walked by wolf-whistling that they realised they were making out in broad daylight in the busy streets of London. As they broke apart Sherlock bit his lip to stop himself grinning like an idiot. John straightened his coat, ignoring the teenager that were still jeering and held his hand out for Sherlock to take.
“Yes, well, erm” John spluttered, doing all he could to stop his cheeks pinking.
“I’m not bisexual, at least I don’t think I am. Emotions can sometimes be beyond me, not usually my own – but it can happen. I do think, however, that I am gay”. Sherlock paused, he’d never actually said those words out loud. Mycroft knew, but then Mycroft knew everything. However, Sherlock did not regret confiding in John, if anything he felt as if their recent display of honesty with each other had brought them closer together.
"Hey, Sherlock" Mr. Watson greeted him with a warm smile as he finished collecting left-out textbooks from his last lesson.
"Clarinet." John matched.
Sherlock soften, he knew that John was lying but his friend had gone to the effort of trying to reassure him and so he felt compelled to play his part equally.
“Ah so it’s a ‘he’ this time” she tried again and was delighted when John turned around as if to say something, only to realise that he’d given himself up.
It was Sherlock’s turn to blush. Not because he was ashamed (‘a Holmes is many things, but ashamed is never one of them’ his brother frequently told him), but because John had been able to deduce something that Sherlock had not seen in John himself.
Sherlock studied the teacher, this was one of the longest conversations he'd had with pretty much anyone ever at BSC. Better still, it was one of the rare times he felt he could show off his skill and not be sneered at.
“So because some substitute teacher had an opinion, you decide you don’t want to be friends” Sherlock couldn’t help but sound bitter. “Oh but then, when she leaves and you don’t have to be ashamed anymore, it’s fine for you to be seen with me”.
“How? I didn’t say?” Sherlock asked.
I’ve been an arse, a complete arse. I let other people’s judgments influence my behaviour and for that I’m sorry. I hope I can have the opportunity to apologise to you properly. Merry        Christmas,
“Okay, please don’t think I’m over stepping here John,” Helen was trying to be as polite as possible, “but I just wanted to make sure that you weren’t feeling uncomfortable with the attention shown to you by some of the pupils”.
"Well Mr Magnussen, I don't approve of bullying in my class. So I suggest you and your friends sit down now before I ask you to leave my class." The unnamed teacher released Magnussen, who proceeded to scuttle back to his seat.
Since his trip to London Sherlock had not stopped thinking about the city, he had only been able to spend half a day in London and he was eager to return as soon as he could. Sherlock had always known that London was the place for him, he need the speed and intensity of the city to keep his mind entertained. When he used to imagine life in London he would first picture the flat he and Mycroft would be sharing, thankfully his brother would be spending the majority of his time in Downing Street and wouldn’t be home that often. Sherlock would picture himself in the well-furnished flat (a Downing Street intern would receive no less) with the lounge set up as his meeting rooms for clients – people who would present him with interesting and complicated cases. He also imagined that the flat would be home to an array of on-going experiments and specimens ready for him to conduct thorough analyses. Before Sherlock had ever experienced London he had always thought that rather than feel anxious at the prospect of being virtually alone in big city, he would thrive of it. He would have Mycroft of course, but in order to fully focus on his work and research, Sherlock wanted to keep social distractions to a minimum. But this was before Sherlock had visited London and since the trip he had realised just how much he thrived off of John’s company. Sherlock knew it was silly to even entertain the thought that John would want to come with him to London, John had his own life of course, but it didn’t mean that he wouldn’t miss his friend. He had also quickly come to realise that with the approaching Christmas holidays, he would have to go a whole three weeks without seeing John – something that he was more than a little dismayed by. Their time together in London had been extra special for Sherlock as it was the first time the pair had met outside of the classroom. Sherlock felt as if he had gotten to see the real ‘John Watson’, the man behind the teacher. It really shouldn’t have surprised him when John revealed his true sexual orientation, all the signs were there, however certain human emotions, especially that of physically attraction were sometimes lost on Sherlock. That was why his growing feelings for John terrified him so much. Sherlock had always been able to count on his sound mental judgements, but when John was around he always found himself distracted. Nonetheless, Sherlock also found that being with John gave him a bit of a head rush, particularly when John was so fond of complimenting him or his work – it wasn’t very often that Sherlock felt admired, and rarer still that he was so attracted to the admirer. However, Sherlock was also aware that when he was next to see John, they lunchtime meetings had become routine, that the pair would have to be a little more reserved than they had been in London. If he was being honest with himself, Sherlock was getting a little fed up of only being able to see John whilst he was acting as his teacher, if they were truly friends then it shouldn’t matter if they spent time together outside of lessons. He decided that during their next lunch together he would suggest that the pair try and meet up over the Christmas holiday.
"What happened? Your self-pity suggests that we're probably talking your average drunken night out? Possibly a one-night stand?" Sherlock inquired, somewhat hesitantly – he didn't know if he truly wanted to hear about a possible one-night stand John might have had.
As he drifted off to sleep again Sherlock thought not of his mother as he should've done, but of John and how his teacher had been insisting for him to start eating more regularly.
“Brilliant, now bugger off, we all have homes to get to” John teased and pretended to shoo his friend away.
Sherlock scoffed, looking away "Hm, and the rest."
John’s smiled widened to a grin, he loved the way Sherlock’s mind performed, like he was always working. As they sometime did, John let Sherlock set up a small experiment whilst he continued to mark the results of the last biology test he gave to his year eleven class. Thankfully it was a comfortable silence that the pair fell into, they just always seemed to click, no matter what each other were doing.
"Looks like we lost track of time again Sherlock" John said, flashing a smile; his previous display of emotion forgotten.
John inched closer towards Sherlock, "Listen to me, the next time someone says, or does, something to you, you come and tell me and I will deal with them. Okay?"
Even as a child Sherlock was not an early riser on Christmas Day, it was rarer if he roused before eleven o’clock, and this was usually only if Mycroft came to wake him. It wasn’t that Mycroft was any fonder of the day, he just always woke up in the early hours – usually to fit in as much work as he could before his mother insisted he ‘put away that damn computer for once’. This year was no different and as usual Mycroft appeared in his doorway at precisely ten thirty. Sherlock had fiercely tried negotiated with mother for a later start to the day, by Violet had insisted that he must get up then as his aunt and uncle were set to come round at midday. Sherlock grumbled and forced himself to sit up in bed, Mycroft had already turn on his lights so he had no hope of returning back to sleep.
“I know Christmas isn’t your favourite time of the year, believe me I share your distain, but you seem to be more glum than usual, is anything the matter?” Mycroft asked.
“I got you something too, just to say thank you for always having my back.” Sherlock cut his brother off before he tried to make an attempt to explain his new found kindness.
The contents of Sherlock's satchel included his nearly full, but not just yet, A5 notepad –to record his favourite deductions; his 5x 30mm magnifier – a recent birthday present from Mycroft; a print-out titled 'How Not To Get Lost In London' – his mother had insisted; the second packed lunch he's ever bothered to make himself; his iPod; £20 and a packet of spearmint gum. It would be the first school trip Sherlock had ever been on, not to mention the teen's first time in London, and he wanted to be prepared – despite his brother's insistence that 'the most fun you'll get up to on a BSC trip is getting lost and winding up on the other side of London'. Screw him, Sherlock had come to the conclusion that he could be forced to listen the drivel Sally Donavan spouts on a daily basis, and as long as he was with John he knew he'd find a way to make it enjoyable. But he wasn't going to be listening to Sally Donavan all day; he was going to be at the Science Museum, and he was certain he would enjoy it, with or without John.
"Sorry?" Mr. Watson enquired.
"Please Sherlock, when we're not in class, call me John. Mr. Watson is my dad; I'm still not used to the name." With the last of the textbooks put away John pulled out the chair at his desk as sat beside Sherlock. "I know this is probably a little odd, I have only been your teacher for a day, but what you did the other day was genius, I'm quite intrigued.
John smiled warmly. “You are special Sherlock. I hope you know that.”
John moved a step closer to Sherlock, who was currently dropping small amounts of blood into a test-tube, and leaned against the desk. "Before you started coming here at break and lunch, where did you go? Because, and don't take this the wrong way, you don't seem the most sociable of people."
John was about to add that being the one earning a fixed, he could afford lunch for two. But the waitress interrupted.
John sighed as he watched Sherlock leave so uneasily, he vowed to find a way to explain to Sherlock his difficult position without revealing his true feelings. If there was such a way of course. John retuned back to his books, he had only managed to mark three test papers and his year eleven class were timetabled in for the lesson after next. As John sat down to continue his grading, the substitute teacher that had joined him on the class trip to London, Helen Jones, walked into his classroom.
“Yes, emergencies.” John retorted. “I can’t imagine your parents would be best pleased if I lost you in London.”
Sherlock half-smiled in acknowledgement and bent down to get a pen from his bag. On his way up he came face to face with Charlie Magnussen and his trail of admirers behind him.
It was decided in their last class together before the trip that they would meet at the train station so that it would look like a coincidence that the teacher and student happened to be travelling together. Sherlock had thought carefully about which family member to ask for a lift to the station that Saturday morning. He went for Mycroft, in favour of him being less likely to ask probing question than their mother. To Sherlock’s delight their conversation was minimal.
"Don't be silly Sherlock, you are far more interesting and much better company than Helen and if I'm being a little honest I think she may have a small crush on me."
“Was not.” John argued petulantly. “She was just very forward that’s all. Anyway, less of that, have you decided what you want to do today?”
John reached Sherlock and passed over a form, resting a hand on his shoulder he bent down and whispered, "You can kick start your Consulting Detective business". John continued on to the rest of the students and watched out of the corner of his eye as Sherlock grinned at him.
John tried his best not to look taken back. It was not that he did not want to see Sherlock during the Christmas break, on the contrary, he would have loved to be able to spend more time with him. It was just that seeing Sherlock outside of the classroom would be a bigger step than he probably realised. Bunking off of the school trip to gallivant round London was one thing, but if the pair were to meet under non-educational purposes, certain questions might be asked. John realised that he was taking a bit too long to answer.
"I'm curious Sherlock. Not that I should be confirming such rumors but, between us, how did you know about Mr. Dior's erm, let's say 'condition'?"
"Holmes!" Dimmock shouted. The young teacher did not dislike Sherlock per say, he definitely admired the boy’s flare for his subject, but rather he did not always have the patience for him.
“No, not him. John’s new. Started this year.” Sherlock tried hard to sound convincing, he was never much good at lying to Mycroft.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Stop playing coy John. We both know you’re good looking.”
The pair might have been grateful once again for the empty carriage, had either of them actually been aware of anything except each other’s lips. Neither of them wanted to break apart from the kiss but eventually their bodies eventually gave out for some much needed air. They pulled away, both grinning wildly.
“Miss it?” Sherlock inquired as he noticed the soft smile on his friends face as they entered the science laboratory.
Sherlock sat in his last biology class of that term, technically he had biology classes on a Friday too, but on the last day of term his school allowed their students to take the day off. This meant that this fifth period biology class would be the last opportunity he had to see John before they broke for the holidays. Sherlock was aware that he was exhibiting the same behaviour that John had when they had met after the London trip, but Sherlock just couldn’t bring himself to look him in the eye. It hadn’t really shocked him that he was so hurt by John’s earlier signs of withdrawal from him, Sherlock guessed that maybe he had been too full on in London and that John was starting to regret befriending him. Consequently, Sherlock was feeling more than a little upset and frankly, a bit pissed off. He vowed that in order of saving John the trouble of making some half-hearted attempt to excuse himself from meeting him, which would just embarrass the both of them, Sherlock would just exit the class without saying another word. Which is exactly what he did and when the class finished he forced himself not to look at John – he feared if he did his resolve would break and he would find himself drawn to John once again.
As he was walking around Sherlock caught sight of John sitting in the museum's café clutching a takeaway cup of coffee like his life depended on it. Sherlock headed over to him. "I did a study on coffee that suggested that those who drink it are at a lower risk of developing diseases such as Parkinson's, Type II Diabetes, and Heart Disease due to the antioxidants produced that fight off harmful chemicals in the body."
Before Magnussen could finish he found himself being tugged off of Sherlock.
John looked like a child about to find out how a magician accomplished his trick. "Come on then, spill. You said you'd teach me a bit about how you deduct."
"Uh huh?" Sherlock replied, only somewhat paying attention.
John grumbled as he corrected his jumper. "It's that obvious? Christ."
“He?” Sherlock started “But I thought? I mean Mary?”
John had arrived at station almost an hour before their train was due to depart. He hadn’t slept much the night before and had found himself rather restless. He told himself that he was just coming down with the flu, it was that time of year after all. That would explain the weird sensation in the pit of his stomach. It definitely wasn’t butterflies. Not at all. Besides Sherlock was his pupil, a fact which he soberly reminded himself of on quite a few occasions. John felt that it was Sherlock’s intelligence and demeanour that matched them as friends, despite the age difference. It was of some comfort that in six months, after taking his exams Sherlock would no longer be John’s pupil. John didn’t quite know how he felt about this yet. He was still trying to ignore the growing fondness he had for Sherlock and pass it off as friendship.
“We could always stay. If you wanted to of course, there’s no pressure and of course we would have separate rooms.” John wanted to make sure he wasn’t abusing his position and getting Sherlock into something he didn’t feel wholly comfortable doing.
But before the pair could discuss it further, the sight of the Science Museum was quickly upon them. A sudden sadness hit Sherlock, his time in London, whilst extremely thrilling, had come to a short end. Nonetheless, his day had been wonderful and more than that, he had spent some quality time with John. Quite some time in fact and without wanting to raise any eyebrows, he decided he should maybe sit with Molly for the duration of the train ride home. John also shared this thought, although he didn’t verbalize this. He let Sherlock go off to find his friend, but not before pulling him into a brief, yet warm, embrace. As he watched Sherlock rejoin his peers John reflected on the day, he’d only just notice that his hangover had disappeared hours ago. Not only had his hangover been cured, but John had actually had a greatly enjoyable day. Though this shouldn’t really have been surprising, he had spent the day running around London with Sherlock, even if they had just visited his old medical hospital. One thing was clear to John however, he was most definitely falling for Sherlock Holmes, and he knew it.
In reality, John was wide awake, sprawled out on the couch where he had passed out the night before, feeling a horrible mixture of hungover and self-loathing. It had been a long time since John had drunk that much, it had taken him back to his teenage years. The last time John could recall getting that wasted had been after a particularly nasty row he'd had with Mary, how ironic. It had been nearly nine weeks since John had watched Mary walk out of their apartment with her bags packed and her belongings gone. Since Mary’s sister lived only a half hour away, his ex-girlfriend had decided to let John stay in the apartment, seeing as he himself had no immediate family nearby. Realistically John should have known that Mary would try and contact him again. It was stupid of him really, to think that he could just put Mary behind him and move on; the problem with Mary was that she always had to be in control. Which is why, at a quarter to midnight the night before she had turned up outside their old apartment, wanting to talk. John had known it was not a wise decision to pander to Mary’s demands, however he saw how much of a state she had gotten herself in and ever the doctor, had wanted to make sure she was at least safe. Nonetheless, the pair had ended up arguing heavily, to the point where John could no longer take it. John had given up around about an hour after Mary had turned up, which resulted in him calling Mary's sister and asking her to come collect her. However, this only angered Mary more and by the time she left the flat John felt so defeated that he allowed himself to get into the state that he had just awoken from. John groaned as he dragged himself off of his couch, he really should not have allowed last night to happen, not with the class trip to London today. Crap. The class trip, John checked his watch, he only had twenty minutes to get ready and meet his students at the train station. He hoped he could get away with just getting his students inside the museum and then he planned find a quiet corner to spend the rest of the day in.
"Will it hurt if I shake with you?" She was not breathless but her voice was not quite normal.
"My Captain..." His voice was hardly a whisper and I thought he'd need help up. I smiled and picked Mountain up. We left my boys to themselves.
I would say 'rarely' but it simply isn't rare that I am this proud of him.
I did not really know, if I may be frank, how many laughter could express. When I am tired and derisive I either laugh or emit a noise we have placed between a laugh and a snort. When we are apprehensive we may laugh nervously, but when he is angry... My alpha is a sight to behold. I could claim his cheeks flush red and he is a characiture, but I do not mean that... What I mean is hard to describe, but no doubt I will in a later writing.
Regular characters:
"You misunderstand me Sherlock. Morocco Case aside, I could never be enraged at you. I must say I think only an appalling Alpha would react so. I'm angry at him darling, not you. Now drink the brandy"
"He would not care if it did" I drew her attention towards me and studied her. She had a certain quality in her eyes that I cannot describe... no doubt I will in later entries. She smiled a little and introduced herself.
Gracie Gallows
Various Villains as well (Woodley survives and becomes obsessed with Holmes as a warning, so he may be the only regular villain)
"That cheery an outward disposition... that constant a smile and a laugh... I do not believe it for one second" My Gem voiced it out loud and I thought about Gracie's eyes. The quality in them was still undefinable.
"Come now Mr Carsen" (the name the young man begged to replace his own in my recount of the tale). "You cannot possibly have come all the way here..." There was a faint glint in his eye of amusement when Mr Holmes spoke. "Merely to compliment my bone structure" He purrs like a cat when he recounts this now. Dr Watson more often though growls like he did back then. Mountain shifted and pawed at his lap when Mr Holmes laughed again. This seemed to continue for quite some time until the young gentleman stepped over a line. In my opinion he was quite the flirt!
"It cannot be plausible..." My dear then turned to me and watched my lips as they quirked up and I lead him down the few feet of corridor to the room I had left the purchase beside. Holmes slowly kneeled down and I did so with him, if only to see his deduction frown while he pondered before opening it. "Such a particular shape... but surely you did not...!" Pale fingers unlaced the bow and turned around the package so that the back which I had partially removed was facing him. A soft gasp relieved me of a weight of whether he would like it. Sliding those hands partly inside he coaxed out the jewel I had got him. Lifting her up my dear gasped again. "Oh she is a monstrous beauty aren't you?!" My dear smiled when our addition meowed back at him. Mountain (as she was christened) was a monstrous more than one meter long. My darling adored her and still pampers her. Our Norwegian Forest Cat (as Sherlock deduced was her breed) is our gorgeous little girl in our family.
"M'fine." Sherlock muttered, trying not to draw further attention to himself.
John’s face lit up, glad they could put the past weeks behind them. “Good, because I have a little surprise for you. It seems you’re not the only one who can make clever deduction.” John reached into his bag and pulled out an envelope containing two travel passes to London. He had brought them as a backup in case his apology failed, but was glad to give them out on better terms. Sherlock viewed the contents delightedly.
John realised the moment Sherlock left his class without a word of goodbye that he had upset the boy, more than that John knew he must have really hurt him. John cursed himself, he should never have let Helen’s comments unnerve him, he should’ve made an effort to apologise to Sherlock before the class had ended. Of course John had not wanted to cross a line with Sherlock, but he most definitely did not want to lose him. John realised that he’d have to do an awful lot to make it up to Sherlock, but he’d be damned if he let that boy slip away from him.
John was thankful for Helen’s discretion but really did not want to be having this conversation. “I see where you’re coming from Helen and I appreciate your concern, but honestly I think I have the situation under control. Really though, I don’t think it is anything more than silly infatuation.”
Mycroft rolled his eyes at his brother’s keenness and made a mental note to find out more this ‘John’.
Sherlock was never known for being overly fond of Christmas, in fact it was probably his least favourite holiday, but this year round he was more miserable than usual. He kept replaying his last moments with John over and over again in his head, maybe he shouldn’t have stormed off like he did. John probably already thought of Sherlock as just a teenage boy and Sherlock’s behaviour that day would’ve only made the assumption worse. If John been pulling away before, Sherlock was certain this would most definitely drive him further from Sherlock. Nonetheless, he still forced a smile onto his face, if only for his mother and father’s faces, he knew he wasn’t the best of sons and so around Christmas time he always tried to make more of an effort.
John was left to reflect on the conversation he had just had. He knew that Helen was not threatening him or coming from an accusatory position, if anything she seemed to think that Sherlock was the one showing feelings for him – not the other way around. Even so, Helen may not have been warning him, but that did not mean that John should not take this as a warning sign. Sherlock still had five months of classes left at Baker Street Comprehensive and John did not want to put either of them in any awkward situations. But at the same time John did not want to have to pull away, if he had to cut ties with Sherlock, even for a short while, it would really trouble him. John hoped that the Christmas holidays would give them a little breathing space and that when they came back they could return to just acting as friends. John could no longer kid himself that he was attracted to Sherlock, and even more he had some gut feeling that Sherlock must be at least a little attracted to John – his behaviour earlier that day indicated that he wanted to spend more time alone with John. That was why John took it upon himself to promise that he would ensure that they both did not cross a line that might ruin what they could have.
Sherlock quickly placed the postcard back inside his coat pocket as he saw John retuning down the aisle. John began to tell him some funny story about an argument that broke out between this couple up ahead. The pair carried on in comfortable silence for the rest of the journey. It was as they pulled into their penultimate stop that Sherlock handed over the postcard and keyring.
John regained composure and internally cursed Sherlock for the effect he had on him. They both gathered up what little belongings they had and headed for the train station. It hadn’t occurred to them to stop holding hands, not that either of them minded.
Sherlock swallowed, "Nope. Never been to London either."
“Do you want me to stop coming over as much?”
John frowned slightly, “I am sorry to hear that Sherlock, I can sympathize somewhat, I didn’t exactly have the easiest schooling experience either. In my first year of college I had this on-off relationship with a classmate, but they weren’t ready to be open and when the relationship came out… well he turned nasty”.
Sherlock’s heart sank. He didn’t want to return to a place where he and John had to hide their affections. Something tugged inside of John as he watched Sherlock’s face fall in dismay. John reached a hand out across the table and took Sherlock’s in his own.
“I see having a governor as a father really pays off” Sherlock gathered that Magnussen’s father must have used his position to keep his son in education, despite his lacking grades.
“Well Sherlock Holmes, I think you just solved your first case as a Consulting Detective. Shall we go and celebrate?” John beamed, glad to have shared this moment with Sherlock.
“And this is where you actually trained right?” Sherlock replied, still in awe of his surroundings. He knew that no one could truly fall in love with a city but he had a hard job telling his brain that.
John kissed Sherlock properly this time and stood up to move over to the next carriage alone. “I promise we will see each other again soon, and not in class. I mean properly. We’ll think of something.”
"Sherlock you're just in time" Molly said, "Sir has shown up yet".
Sherlock nodded; his mouth currently occupied with eating.
"For once Holmes, can you at least act like you are partaking in the lesson" the teacher returned.
John swatted him Sherlock’s arm and stole one of his chips. “Don’t be silly Sherlock, you wouldn’t really want me hanging around now would you?”
Remembering where they were, John regained composure and rolled his eyes at his friends teasing. “Come on Sherlock” he called, checking the time on his watch, “we’ve got just enough time to catch the next tube back to the museum”.
Sherlock just rolled his eyes. "Your jumper is on backwards and, deduction skills or not, I can tell you're hungover."
Violet beamed at her son, kissed him goodnight and turned to leave – satisfied that her son was fine and well.
Sherlock started copying down the information from John's presentation, not that he didn't already know that receptors are groups of specialized cells that can detect changes in the environment called stimuli, or that they are often located in the sense organs, or that each organ has receptors sensitive to particular kinds of stimulus. But he had promised John that he would at least try and participate in the class. Not to mention, Sherlock wanted to get further into John's good books so that when it came to the date of the trip he might be able to sit next to his teacher on the train – giving him even more time alone with John. The lesson ran by relatively quickly, Sherlock never felt as if he had enough time with John and certainly not time where he could be his usual self, not with Magnussen ad his friends around in the class. As always Mycroft would be picking him up after class in order to drive the pair home, his older brother worked in the local council building and so could get Sherlock on his own way back to the Holmes household. Normally Sherlock would find small amusement in wanting to make Mycroft wait for him, however today Sherlock was eager to get home early and get his mother to sign the form for the school trip. When the bell signaled the end of the day, he decided to pack up with the rest of his peers and actually leave on time for once. However, he still made sure to say goodbye to John, smiling at his friend as he left the room.
"I am honored, thank you John." Sherlock replied, hesitating when he realized he had used his teacher first name.
“She’s having an affair, the husband knows. He shagging the nanny.”
Oh, he wasn't expecting that. "You mean apart from the weight loss and the tremors? Or maybe the permanent glazed look in his eyes?"
Sherlock smiled back and gathered his things. "I have English next, but I'll see you last period."
"Well it's simple really. I observe everything. From what I observe, I deduce everything. When I've eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how mad it might seem, must be the truth. For instance, when I deduced that you used to own a black cat, I first observed the scratches on the back of your hand. From the size and depth of the scratches I deduced that they were caused from a feline. I then deduced that you had recently given up the animal, I had observed that the cuts were relatively new but were somewhat faded. Now, that could just mean that the cat stopped scratching you, maybe you stopped petting it. However, as you never wanted the cat in the first place, it's pretty obvious you prefer the loyalty and companionship of a canine; I concluded that you gave the cat away. Lastly, the colour of the cat, this was the easiest – your coat still has the odd black hair on it. You see, it's all in the logic." Sherlock exhaled, he'd reeled that off without stopping.
"Yeah, well… urm."
"Magnussen, Charlie Magnussen" the boy retorted.
With that Mr. Watson began to introduce their first topic of the term; it was something about genes that Sherlock had already filled away in his mind palace the previous term. But, for Mr. Watson's sake, Sherlock decided to at least try and look like he was engaging in the lesson.
“Coffee, black. Thank you.” Sherlock answered.
“Okay, I know a few places I think you’d be interested in.” said John. “Oh and I think it might be a good idea for you to take my phone number, in case of emergencies.”
“Oh go on John, who is she?” Harry waited for John to respond, but John just ignored his sister and instead got up to start on the dinner.
“Hmm, if you say so Sherlock.” Mycroft clearly did not believe his younger brother; however, he wasn’t about to launch into a heart-to-heart in the middle of a Starbucks.
At that moment a paper airplane flew past John, narrowly missing the side of John’s head, snapping him out of his thoughts about Sherlock. C’mon John. He scolded himself, it wasn’t like him to get all doe-eyed, he felt like a teenager again. John picked up the paper airplane, threw it back to the student who had launched it and began calling out the register for his tutorial group.
“Twenty-five and shut up, we’re here now” John teased and in an effort to distract from the current topic of conversation, dragged Sherlock by the hand threw the foyer of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital.
“The science labs, obviously” Sherlock joked, smirking at John “Do you even known me?”
This is a revamped chapter of the original fic, I will be quickly updating the other chapters and posting as soon as possible. For those following the story I promise to get to writing the new chapters quickly.
"Consulting Detective?" John asked.
As John’s lecture drew to a close, the atmosphere between him and Sherlock had barely eased.
Sherlock chuckled, "Piss off."
Sherlock nodded, not wanting to get too emotional. “Goodbye John, see you soon.”
Sherlock refused to dwell on John’s last comment. “Yes, of course John”.
Sherlock had spent all the previous night researching which exhibitions he wanted to visit, he had decided on going to the Computing, Medical History and Psychology exhibitions first and then see what else was around. He'd even made sure he got an early night, which meant postponing his latest experiment analyzing fingerprints, so that he would be up on time the following day. Although Sherlock realised that it wouldn't have mattered much anyway, he had managed to get up and ready in less than five minutes; leaving him with a half hour wait before Mycroft was set to drive him to the train station to meet up with the rest of his class. Sherlock spent that time wondering what John was doing in that moment. Was he just waking up? Or, like Sherlock, had he woken early in anticipation? Maybe he was still fast asleep? Or was he awake, thinking of Sherlock as he was thinking of him?
"Okay, so you're in a long term relationship – I'd say roughly seven or eight years, you met at university – but not married. You used to own a black cat, although not your choice, you wanted a dog. You're a younger brother, but you don't get along with your older broth- no, not brother, sister. You wanted to be an army doctor but, presumably, the injury you sustained on you right leg put you out of action. Probably why you became a teacher, you didn't want to waste the training." Sherlock let out a long breath. "Was I close?"
Sherlock was definitely getting pinker. "I know what people want," he shrugged.

"What am I doing? Sherlock, what the hell are
"Yes."
John cleared his throat. "Speaking of which, I think you can cross off number twenty-two, there."
"Who are you?"
"I…I have no idea. Is there a problem?"
"Right," John said a little roughly. He cleared his throat, conscious of the warmth spreading through his chest. "Well. Good thing we're experimenting, then."
Sherlock's jaw dropped at the sheer gall as the captain pocketed his phone.
"It's what I do." Sherlock lift his chin regally. "Goodbye, Miss Wenceslas."
intimidate me, too."
John turned and then paused in the doorway of Sherlock's office. "I just wanted to, you know, stop by and tell you. That I still think what you do is amazing." He smiled. "That you're really amazing."
. Sherlock's arms went around John, and John pressed his whole body into the next kiss, and there was nothing else in the world.
It was past dawn, the storm long gone, when Mycroft closed the folder on the table in front of him and said, "Well?"
Molly made an encouraging noise.
John gave Sherlock a pained look. "Really?"
"Hadn't noticed they'd gone, had you?"
of you."
"Don't leave me," she whispered into his ear.
"Shut. Up."
Watson?"
"You." Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Obviously."
Sherlock's eyes were just as startling several inches away as they had been from yards away. Okay, probably more.
"Look at me, John. What do you think most people see when they look at me? Who am I,
"No, sir, but he left instructions. One moment and I'll bring a candle for the table." Their attendant smiled as the set the tray down between them. "More romantic."
"You were smiling at her."
"We knew we wanted to share our love," Ravi grinned, cheeks flushing a bit, "but we didn't realize how badly we wanted to
John couldn't help but smile.
"Well, I work as a PA," Janine began. Her voice was rich and lilting. "And that's a strictly professional personal service, none of those naughty ideas, you lot."
"Pathologist, you said, right?" John popped a last morsel of blueberry muffin into his mouth.
"In that case. Mycroft Holmes. I'm taking you into custody. For the murder of Andrew West."
"There were no instructions. I don't take instructions. They simply asked for the perfect wedding."
"Oh, just…wedding stuff," John said blithely. "Probably."
"Er. All right. Why not?"
"He's a policeman. What do you do?"
A howl of wind rattled the glass in the windows.
recent employee."
Mycroft's smile was tight and smug and not at all affected by the appreciative glint in Lestrade's eyes as he offered his hand on the agreement. "Shall we settle the details, then, Detective Inspector Lestrade?"
There was color everywhere, painted on the walls, the floor, the ceiling, the furniture, bright and bold, jagged lines and sensuous curves. There were landscapes and figures and clouds and eyes. It was Prague, all spires and spikes. It was London in the rain. It was a tropical island, flamboyant and lush. It was tanks and war and anger. It was peace in the parks and the sky. It was passion. It was life. Dogs and dragons.
"Yes," Sherlock breathed. "Yes, I think—"
Warning: bit of blood
"Mr. Holmes. I…" Lestrade cleared his throat, shook his head, and glanced at the window. The sky was growing brighter. "I should go. I…have to go get my son."

, and jerked his head in Paul and Ravi's direction. "Who is that?"
"Excellent!" Sherlock beamed and shoved him onto the stage. "Relax. You'll do fine."
"Just go. Our business is concluded. All of it."
"—wade into the pit, right. I thought you meant the, er, pool…scenario…specifically."
"Janine, feeling any better yet?" John asked. The card said "what do you think" again, but he thought he was up to a little ad libbing.
"Yeah," John said roughly, "you have. James, you and I—"
The busyness had its benefits. It had helped Sherlock avoid thinking past what happened
John's smile bloomed. "Oh, god, yes."
"I had some time to think, without my phone. I thought about you."
"Because it's you. You've made everything different."
be afraid of a woman like her. Radka Wenceslas was intimidating. She made certain of it. She was tall and sharp and strong and she made the most of it. Her lipstick matched her red-soled pumps, and the necklines of her fitted black dresses did not hide the scars near the base of her throat. All of it she had earned.
"Okay. Something different about this time?"
That was what was important here. That was the only thing that was important.
He couldn't tell Lestrade everything, obviously, but Mycroft explained what he could about the Bruce-Partington case, given what Lestrade would know from having seen the file now as well as the information from his own investigation. Lestrade was thorough, listening intently to every detail and challenging Mycroft on point after point.

looked calm and confident. "At least, that's how I see you."
"Hello, Mr. Holmes." The man's smile was calmer than his eyes, his voice pleasant. "I'm Captain John Watson. And I've requested all passengers turn off their mobile devices."
"Sherlock?"

John grinned all the wider.

"Yes, there is," Andy insisted. He would

"It's over here," Raz was wiping paint off one hand with a dirty rag, "the painting, I started—"
"Yes?"
"Why?" John asked quietly.
No, that was unfair…John adored Mrs. Hudson and didn't begrudge her family or friends or festivity or any good thing in the world. He was more than a little puzzled with Sherlock's attitude towards the whole affair, though. On one hand, Mrs. Hudson was a much appreciated employee and it was completely understandable Sherlock would grant her request to host this event. On the other hand, Sherlock had been in—and there was no better way to put it—a complete

He should have just fucked the man in the gazebo and had done with it. Now he had a man in his sitting room and documents to re-file and
"Sent away."
How quiet was it inside that enormous white villa of Sherlock's? Was he sulking in silence or—or what? John didn't know, but he felt uneasy.
Soo Lin touched Andy's chest and smiled. "Here."
"This isn't his fantasy. It's yours."
"Beautiful!" John's seatmate leaned across him to gaze out the little window.
"Well." John straightened his jacket. "How did I do?"
"We've said our goodbyes." Sholto held out his hand. "Take care, Mr. Holmes."
The "cottage" turned out to be an enormous and ornate, white-painted, red-trimmed, rambling Queen Anne style villa with a tall bell tower jutting up near the center. Inside Sherlock's private offices, however, the island aesthetic fell away, replaced by an actually slightly shabby, completely disorganized, cluttered and curiously homey space. Sherlock was sat in a modern leather desk chair, which he turned to face John as John walked in. Sherlock's island aesthetic had fallen away, too. He was wearing a simple, fitted, plum-colored button-up, not a trace of white. He rested his elbows on his desk and tented his fingers in front of his chin.
Henry shook his head. "I can't even touch her yet."
"I was

John moved cautiously towards the…yes, those were most definitely sex sounds…until he could see…everything. Absolutely…everything. Every single bit and bob of everything. The pool, empty of water and filled with cushions and towels and a…creative variety of toys…writhed with slick bodies. At the center, on a raised platform for all to see, Ravi and Paul had a place of honor. And they were making enthusiastic use of it.
John bit back a snappish reply, because he was

"No, no, it was a long time ago now. I just…sometimes he can…shock people."
"But you got one thing wrong."
"Yeah," Lyons shrugged.

. Sherlock Holmes stayed out of the pit.
If Sherlock didn't understand that kind of pain, John was glad of it. The mockery underlying Sherlock's performance, even if John was the only one who heard it, he wasn't so glad of.
"But I didn't."
Mrs. Hudson gave him a look.

"Well, I'll just…leave you to it," he finally said.
"Sir? The captain has requested that seat belts be fastened for take-off. For passenger safety."

Andy wiped the back of his hand across his cheek, swallowed down the
"Not lately," John said darkly, trying to remember what stories he might have told Mrs. Hudson that night they broke out the rum. He hoped he hadn't given away anything too shocking. Although what would actually shock Mrs. Hudson, he could hardly begin to imagine at this point. "And none of my dates ever took place in front of a studio audience."
"It is always beneficial to have more than one set of options available to address any given situation. You would, of course, continue in your current employment with New Scotland Yard. I would ask nothing of you that interfered with those duties. I would simply request…and provide…information that would enhance your effectiveness in that role."

Sherlock made a cut-off, sort of choking sound. "Nothing," he assured the phone. "Ignore that."

"John, that's hardly an appropriate remark to make to your employer."
"Shhh!"
"You did say you wanted to be useful," Sherlock pointed out, like

him, nuzzling into his bare shoulder. He froze.
"No one else knows how to refill the lubricant fountain," Sherlock muttered. "It's quite inconvenient."
"You'll have a friend for life," Lyons grinned.
"Don't pretend you aren't excited for the next client." John looped his tie around his neck. "And we'll have plenty of time. Always."
Then Sholto's mission had gone bad. And even though Sholto came out of it alive—was the only one who came out of it alive—John had lost a fellow soldier, a friend, and a
Sherlock's head was bent over his mobile when John returned, his thumbs a blur of motion on the keypad, issuing instructions for staff to collect the unfortunate guests at his feet, John presumed.
John cleared his throat. "I…hadn't quite…realized that."
From his podium, John's view of Janine's potential suitors was blocked by the same panel that blocked her view, so he had no idea if anyone was actually over there. He breathed a little sigh of relief when someone responded.
"Sherlock," John pointed at Mycroft, "he

John glanced at Sherlock's profile. He had turned his attention back to the still lagoon, but a smile played at the corners of his mouth. "Why?"
Sherlock looked up. Their eyes locked. Slowly, deliberately, he stroked his thumb along the back of John's hand.
John hesitated, hovering.
"Spell it out, Sherlock. You know how slow I am to catch on sometimes," John said tightly, looking not-at-all slow or uncertain. In fact he looked

There was most definitely something in the air tonight.
"Other business," John said primly. "Do you want your tea or not?"
Sherlock smiled over his shoulder as he stepped out into the rain.
"And now you aren't." The man pressed the power button on Sherlock's phone. "For passenger safety."
His guest was fully dressed. He was standing. He was frowning. And he was holding the Bruce-Partington folder. "This is yours?" he asked Mycroft quietly.
…bloody hell." Lestrade grimaced.
"Oh, you enjoyed it."
Sherlock emerged from the bathroom and tossed his damp towel at John, who snatched it out of the air with an appreciative leer at Sherlock's naked form. "He's going to

tears. John resisted the temptation to rub his eyes in disbelief. Which was a good thing, because he might have otherwise missed the silver-haired man who launched himself at Sherlock for a hug of his own. Sherlock stiffened, but allowed the man to clap him on the back several times.
Sherlock gave him a long, close look, then rolled his eyes. "Oh, I see."
John looked around the mostly-empty garden. "Except
John started, jerking his hands free to reach for Andy. "What the hell?!"
As the plane took off, Sherlock turned to John, looking expectant.
"No." Sherlock drew a neat circle around item twelve. "It's my notebook."
“Mycroft, do be so kind as to stop sticking your oversized nose where it does not belong,” Sherlock snaps, tearing his eyes from the ceiling to pin his brother with them.
“John, I--”
He wishes he hasn't hurt his doctor.
When Sherlock wakes, it's to the smell of cleaning products. The dust no longer rests in the air, and the entire flat looks slightly brighter. He can hear John puttering about in the kitchen. He's unsure if this is reality or not.
Sherlock opens his eyes slowly as John pulls away. John looks surprised, but not overly so. Mostly just embarrassed to have been caught. Even quirks a small smile.
longer?” Sherlock murmurs in return, sighing at the faint feel of an arm around his waist, mirroring how his arm is on John. John-in-his-head huffs a laugh.
“I wish I hadn't bollocksed everything up,”
This time, Sherlock is seeking that feeling. He wants John to fall apart in his mouth, fucking down his throat, screaming his name, thinking of only Sherlock.
He doesn't.
“What does it matter what my hair looks like?” he asks the air, voice rasping. He remembers this day: the day he first claimed John as his own. Or rather, when John claimed him.
Echoed laughs bounce through his head, growing gradually louder until they are booming into Sherlock's brain. Stinging his heart. Leaving a bad taste in his mouth. Or maybe that's just the sand. He licks his lips, tongue coming back gritty and dry. Sherlock scolds himself for thinking of John now, when he is so far away from London. When he can never return. Not now. Not after this long. The pain in his doctor's voice is still palpable as it echoes through his mind; the hurt that his selfishness has caused in John. Sherlock hates leaving him this way, but he knows there was no other choice. He thinks wistfully of how things would be if John were here with him, if he were to reveal his trick and be forgiven.
Has he been here before? He thinks he would remember this void. Thinks he would remember this ache of isolation.
Beyond the room lays a white hallway lined with doors identical to his own. Scuffed rubber trimming edges where the walls meet the tile floor. He's in a hospital.
“Mycroft thinks a lot of dim-witted things, John, don't listen to him,” he replies smartly, voice still catching. Laughter lights John's eyes, though none is released. Sherlock hears the murmur of an annoyed voice to his right. He doesn't care to look. His doctor says something to the voice and he distantly hears a door close. John bites his lip as he looks back at Sherlock, hesitating before he speaks. The laughter is gone from his face. Sherlock's eyes track the movement like a hawk. Nervousness. Embarrassment. Anger.
Eventually.
Door by door passes. No windows. Is he underground? Is this some secret facility of Mycroft's? Sherlock wouldn't put it past him.
“John, we both know that's still me,” he replies, voice sounding raspy to his ears.
John was kissing him again. It was chaste, just a press of the lips. John was worried of his virtue, he supposed. Worried of spooking him. Sherlock did not have much experience to speak of, but he wasn't entirely dense in the area of sex. His mind palace did have a drawer for such knowledge.
“Doing what?” He can see John saying the words, but his voice comes out muffled. Sherlock likens it to him being underwater. He gets up, reaching for John. His hand rests on his shoulder momentarily, then passes through. It feels as though the appendage is moving through mud.
A familiar hand strokes his head, and he finally glances to his left. He takes a long moment to inspect the worn jumper, the faded jeans, the unkempt blond hair. Moves his gaze to rest on the figure's face. There's more lines than he remembers being. Those blue eyes are more tired than he had imagined them being. But it's him. In the flesh.
Sherlock redoubles his efforts, nose touching the pale curls on John's body with every thrust into his mouth. He moans around the thick member in his mouth, making John swear at the vibrations sent along it. His hands are fists in the detective's curls, his eyes are glazed over as he stares down at the man between his legs. Sherlock looks up through his lashes to meet his gaze, putting all his love and lust into the look. John groans.
Sherlock kisses him slowly. Thoroughly. Licks his way into John's mouth. Remaps the shape of the cavity. Threads his hand into John's hair as he pushes him back into the bed. John squeaks at the suddenness, yet makes no move to get away from Sherlock's hungry mouth and covetous hands. The taller man swings a leg over, straddling him. Presses their twin hardnesses together as the kiss intensifies. John's hands are roving over his back, dipping to squeeze his arse, just the way he had dreamed of it all those weeks ago. Sherlock grips his lower lip in his teeth, nipping lightly, making John gasp into his mouth. Their tongues tangle, a messy dance. Sherlock sets a pace with his hips, and John matches it. Sherlock is rapidly approaching orgasm. Feels like a teenager about to come in his pants for the first time. From the looks of things, John isn't faring much better. He wrenches himself away from John's mouth to pay some attention to his jaw and ears. The only sound in the room is their panting breaths. The rustling of cloth. John slips his hands below the band of Sherlock's sleep pants, a finger gently stroking over the pucker of his arse. Sherlock moans into John's ear. His lips press wetly against his neck without purpose now. All he can think of is John touching him again.
“Alright there, Sherlock?” John asks. John discovered months before his leaving that touch is the easiest way to bring him into the present, out of his mind. Sherlock furrows his brow, steepling his fingers before his face.
“My beautiful genius, you need to calm your mind,” he says, kissing each of Sherlock's eyes in turn, “What will help? What can I do?”
He teeth catch over the sensitive flesh of John's bullet wound, making the doctor squirm in sleep. He laps his tongue over it as an apology. He would never hurt John. Would never cause him any sort of pain.
Sherlock blinks owlishly at him before raising his hands to John's lap. Long fingers undo the button, make short work of the zip. John's hands stop him, turning Sherlock's face back up to his.
He's running his fingers through John now, distorting his image, the heavy fog that is his doctor being churned around by his own hand. Slowly, 221B crumbles away around him, brick by brick, leaving a black void in its place. Sherlock watches the setting drip slowly away. The darkness encroaches in on him. He turns back to John. John is gone. 221B is gone. Where is he? Still in his mind palace? Somewhere farther, more real, but less reality? The panic sets in as the last scrap of colour slips away. Sherlock spins in place, hands in his hair. He can feel his eyes burning, his throat welling up. What happened? Where did John go?
Concern mingled in with the frown. Sherlock's brow creased; his head shook a firm 'no'. A sigh escaped John.
“Bloody hell, Sherlock, your skull was bashed open,” John cries, running his hand through his hair, messing it further. “I checked your pulse. You were
Those times Sherlock would throw himself into a case. Seclude himself into his mind palace for days on end until he forgot those traitorous thoughts.
“I don't live in the flat anymore, Sherlock,” he tells him. Sherlock freezes. Opens and closes his mouth. John holds up a hand, the one that had previously been petting Sherlock. “Don't...just don't talk right now. I just couldn't be there. Not with you...” He swallows thickly, choosing his words. “...gone. Christ, Sherlock, I could barely be anywhere we used to go. I haven't spoken to Mrs. Hudson in months. Greg stopped texting me after the first year I didn't respond. I haven't been able to hold a job, let alone sleep soundly at night. Thank god for my pension,” He covers his face with his hand, laughing with no humour. “I've been seeing my therapist again, for all the good that's doing. I've been having nightmares of you--” He pauses, swallowing. Sherlock can see his eyes glistening. “Of you falling,” he finishes in a whisper.
The words work like a spell, and John is spilling into Sherlock's hand with a grunt. The brunet captures his lips again, kissing him deeply as the orgasm wracks him. John looks unexplainable when he comes. Sherlock craves the sight with every fibre of his being.
will have to do.
But the gentle touches his John here gives him feel so real. The soft looks from across the room, the playful bantering, the way John holds him at night. Sherlock can't convince himself to give it up.
“Fuck,” John groans into his mouth, fingers digging almost painfully into Sherlock's arse. The detective keeps up his pace, thumbing the head the way he knows John likes. He moves his mouth to John's ear and slips the lobe into his mouth. The blond's words are no more than babbles as Sherlock nips the bit of flesh, accompanying it with a firm squeeze of his hand. His free hand goes to John's chest, pinching the sensitive nubs there. John is nothing but a ball of pleasure now, thrusting wildly into Sherlock's hand as he lathers his jaw and ear with attention.
John.
Dragging his way across the floor, Sherlock hears the double doors open, and a sharp “
Then why can't he ignore the painful throbbing in his chest as his mind fills with his doctor?
“Close your eyes, Sherlock,” John instructed. The detective obeyed. How could he not?
“John,” he rasped, a needy whinge in the heavy air surrounding them.
Sherlock kisses John's head more firmly, allowing his lips to linger. His hand strokes small circles on John's back, making John snuggle contentedly into his chest. The blond's legs tangle with his, making their bodies entirely flush.
“I haven't seen the good doctor since your
Sherlock could feel the closeness of the doctor. John was a miniature sun radiating on him. He often wondered how the small man could make the room feel so much warmer just with his mere presence. It was scientifically improbable, but the truth remained. The heat closed in on him, making his skin prickle pleasantly. Sherlock briefly wondered how long this sensation would last, but his brain halted when he felt something pressing onto his lips.
” John confides in his ear, pressing a kiss to the shell. “
“Mycroft thinks you should stay here for another week or so until your health improves,” John tells him. Sherlock scowls, eyes narrowed.

too long at a woman on the street, or a man on the tube.
“Welcome back to the land of the living,” he greets wryly. Sherlock winces, bringing a hand up to hold John's to his face.
“Sherlock,” he pants, grinding up into the man above him. “Look at what you do to me,”
” he hears John ask. Sherlock shakes his head. He keeps walking. Obviously.
The room is silent. Sherlock feels eyes watching him.
