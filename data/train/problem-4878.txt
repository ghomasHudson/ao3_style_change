“Hello, Dean,” his friend greets him. Always one for formalities. Dean huffs a greeting, grinning at Gabriel standing bundled up against the cold by his brother’s side.
“There’s Cas’ on that piano again,” he murmurs. “He’s so good at it. He’ll be out of this town before any of us, playing piano somewhere fancy…”
Castiel nods. He can work with that. “Okay...okay. But how do I know I won’t just go back down to hell? How can I be sure that if I...
She doesn’t answer right away. She glances out one of the windows near the door, her hand curling into a fist by her side.
She blinks. “Um, okay, but —”
“Let’s go,” he agrees.
“Guess this is it, buddy,” he whispers. “Hope this is, um...okay. I figured you’d like this kinda thing, right? All...peaceful and calm and crap. Look, there’s even little freakin’....wildflowers growing in the grass. You—”
“You shut up!” Dean laughs, trying to sound less serious than he feels. “But...really,” Dean begins, “All that...it was...it was fun. But I don’t think I can really keep doing it again.”
Castiel smiles, looking between the two fondly before placing a gentle kiss to the top of his brother’s head. It's tender and impeccably gentle; so, so different from the vicious, angry boy who diligently protected Dean from school bullies not so long ago.
“My father was religious, as you know. To this day, I still don’t fully understand what branch or sect of Christianity he chose to follow. Only that, over time, he grew more and more convinced that he was a messiah and that God was speaking to him in languages that only he understood. I often wonder if he suffered from some kind of psychosis, or if he was simply a man delusional enough to believe in his inflated sense of self-importance fueled by the Bible and its messages. But you know that, already. You were the last, normal friend I ever had before my father cut Lucifer and me off from the rest of the world.
“Castiel,” she says conversationally. He says nothing. Even bound in more ways than one, Castiel feels small before her. They had come to an understanding in hell that Castiel had hoped would have burned away when he resurfaced; he was the great apprentice, the one who learned the ways of hell’s greatest torturer. When he was taken off the rack, he would carve into human souls with a decadence unprecedented in hell. She would demonstrate and he would copy. He would watch and forge new methods of his own. There was a power in that, a sense of belonging when the only thing
Balthazar huffs in thanks. “Well, I’m always down for a little midnight action, but I’m currently nursing a hangover anyway. Don’t have to worry about this ‘liability’ dragging you boys down from your fun. Guess I better get busy on the basement door,” he mutters. He passes a wary look at Castiel. “Cas? Be careful out there. Please.”
him, to use him to be something monstrous. He doesn’t want his father to be in heaven or hell or any place in between. He wants his father to have never been born.
“Dean, seriously. If he’s as crazy as you say, maybe you should stay out of this and call the police. He could hurt you, or — or get you arrested or something.”
“Better sick than a coward,” the older man snaps. “This is the only way.”
- hold, his other self brings the butt of the gun across his temple, sending him into a quick flurry of unconsciousness.
“Cas’...” Dean breathes, quiet enough that their father wouldn’t be able to hear everything. “Just come back to my place. He’s a jerk. You weren’t doing anything, he’s just — “
“Samhain!” Lucifer roars triumphantly. Castiel feels the very blood in his veins grow terribly, terribly cold. Samhain — the Seal. He hadn’t seen his brother in nearly a year and now he’s opening a Seal to the Devil’s cage and if Castiel could just
“Left?” Castiel repeats. He tilts his head. “Since when do ghosts...leave?”
And here Castiel is, asking him to do the very thing Dean wants more than anything else. But Dean knows, better than anyone, that he can’t leave.
“I love you, Cas,” Dean grunts. “You don’t gotta say that back, I know humans - er, myself included now, I guess - don’t like throwing that around a whole lot, but —”
“Like...not even Meg...or Ana? I see you looking at them sometimes.”
read what it said. We managed to capture one in Michael’s charge, and after almost a month, she broke and told us exactly what was needed to cut off an angel’s power: the trials inscribed on the tablet.”
Dean thinks to himself. What had Castiel gotten himself into?
Castiel knows that he didn’t. He wouldn’t. He never, ever would - he knows how those end. And desperate as he’s been, he’s never been so desperate as to bargain with a deal for something that he wants. The reasons for Castiel’s damnation, Castiel knows, were not the result of any deal that he made.
“Tired.”
Castiel frowns as they walk, but nods in response to Dean's offer without saying another word. Soon, the neighborhood begins looking like its former self again; greener yards. Kept houses. The same, boring American life that’s supposed to be the life. Dean sighs.
. He recognizes the song playing on the speakers - “Cherry Pie”. Castiel swallows the lump in his throat as they push past a clutter of long, flat tables. Cloaked in a neon purple light, the club has a wide stage across the back with three metal poles connected from the base up to the ceiling. Several more, smaller stages sit near the corners. Two men with tanned skin and black thongs nod at them as they walk in. Castiel accidentally catches the eye of the taller one and flushes down to his chest.
Jo chuckles. “Yeah. He said that, and I quote, “I bloody well knew you dumbasses were banging behind my back. Can’t say I’m not happy for you both, though. Dean looks like a model and he’s a good guy. Give him lots of kisses, Cas. I miss you a lot, and if I see you up here any time too soon, I’ll do my damndest to send you packing right back down to earth again.”
Castiel had been his ever since. And he’s never been happier for someone to be such an intrinsic part of who he is, now.
Dean’s chest hitches in a tight sob. He clenches his jaw so tight it hurts as his fingers curl over the urn. This is it. He’s going to let him go. This is what he drove all night to do.
Castiel sighs as he rubs his hands down his face. Relieved as he is to be away from the frightful nightmare, none of this still makes any sense to him. Apparently, angels can visit dreams, too. And manipulate them, if this really is Dean’s doing.
“A den of iniquity,” he says after a moment. Balthazar stares at him in disbelief. Only now does Castiel realize he’s in a bathrobe and, likely, not much else underneath.
Dean draws in a deep breath. With a dark look, his father turns his back to Dean and moves to walk out of the kitchen and into the living room.
Jo tilts her head. Her curious expression trails across his face - hauntingly similar to the way Dean looks at him, sometimes. The look of an angel trying to understand the thoughts of a human mind. “Why would you go back to hell?” she asks softly.
Castiel nods, still watching his brother play.
“So what if we do leave?” Dean asks. He fights against the tremble in his voice, relieved when his voice sounds strong and confident and not nearly as terrified as he feels. Dean draws in a slow breath, daring his father to turn back around to face him again.
“I like him, too. He’s easy to pick up on the piano. Simple chords, easy to follow just by listening to the vinyl once or twice."
“Save it. Come inside. Let me take a look at that before it gets dirty.”
he wants to cut her, to carve her as she’d done to him, to turn her into
Castiel looks at Dean warily. His eyes seem to crinkle, as though trying unsuccessfully to piece together what Dean is trying to say.
A deep, instinctual urge prompts Dean to defend his father as he worries his bottom lip between his teeth. The urge to scold Sam for thinking such a thing, to brush him off and call him crazy. But something else, something heavy, nags at Dean until he can’t ignore it anymore.
“What about our brother?” Castiel asks softly. “Lucifer? Where is he?”
He can’t let that happen. He can’t even
good in the past couple of months.
“Thank you, ma’am,” he says quietly. Without another word, Castiel turns and hurries down the hall.
“How did you find something like this?”
His other self gives him a dirty look. “Because Dean isn’t
“Well, you’ve certainly got an angel on your shoulder now,” Balthazar breathes.
Unable to believe what he’s hearing, Castiel shakes his head, bringing his hands up to grip his hair tightly in his fingers. He feels utterly and completely lost. Spinning along a tidal wave of pain and frustration with no end in sight. He looks at Dean miserably, fighting the urge not to cry.
, no matter how much he was told otherwise. Sam had been silent on the matter. They had a roof over their heads; that’s all that mattered.
Dean bites his lower lip, his amusement falling. “I see. I’m sorry about that, buddy.” He pushes his drink into Castiel’s hand. Castiel shivers when their fingers brush together for just a moment, feeling like touching an angel without permission is surely some terrible crime. Or a beautiful one. “Just drink it,” Dean grunts when he notices Castiel’s hesitation to accept the glass. “Think you need it more than me.”
Freedom, that's what I need…”
Dean’s frantic thoughts are interrupted when Sam pushes open their bedroom door. He takes one look at Dean — his puffy, tearstained eyes, his red face, and immediately looks down at the floor.
This was a story that has lived in my head for about seven years. As I said in the notes of the very first chapter, this was a very different story with a very different ship that I never finished. I'm so glad to be able to finish it like this and that it resonated with at least a few people.
Gabriel trots over to the pair, offering a small, yellow flower in his tiny hand. “Here. For you,” he chirps. He gives his brother the dandelion. Castiel accepts it, and Gabriel’s small forehead scrunches up in a frown.
“You useless son of a
Dean sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose.
Dean looks down. He presses his fingers through the sand, watching as it shifts and pours between his fingers.
But the sunlight does not burn.
“Dad, it’s just for a little while - “
“No.”
And with that, Castiel turns and hurries off into the night, leaving Dean dazed as he watches his friend hurry away. The moon covers the quiet town in an ethereal glow, and a chilly wind blows through the leaves, stirring the coattails of Castiel’s trenchcoat behind him. Dean watches him leave in astonishment, wanting nothing more than to reach out to him, to follow him into the dark and learn the unearthly secrets his friend holds so close to his own heart.
) bubbles in his throat. The watching isn’t what is wrong - it’s hard
Devil,” Dean finishes for him. “Devil with a capital ‘D’. Same one as in your Bible, Old Testament and all.” Castiel looks down at the table. He feels numb, and yet, his heart is pounding in his chest like he’d just run a marathon. Memories of his childhood come rushing back in a sickening whirl of color.
“Dean, it’s always like that with kids like him. I’m not saying you can’t be friends with him. Just watch your back. You know how that type gets sometimes. And you can always tell real young, too.”
you! And you know me. You can fight this!”
“Yes. It’s just cold. Very cold.”
“Mate, did you just call my
Dean laughs again, taking a reluctant sip. “You don’t seem the type to drink beer, I guess.”
Castiel looks at him in disbelief. “Dean. You come into my house at
“Well...you said it yourself, Dean. ‘The whims of heaven are my own, but it does not mean I am not bound by them.’ You’re disobeying. You’re...doing what you think is right. Not what heaven thinks is right. That’s...a good thing. You’re thinking for yourself.”
“He ran. He was...much stronger than we anticipated. We fear he might be drinking demon blood to give himself abilities, though we can’t imagine why.”
“Castiel. Joanne. This is a surprise. I was only looking for
“My father...was difficult,” Castiel murmurs in weary agreement. “You did more for us than I could have ever asked you to, Balthazar. I felt like I would have betrayed my brother somehow if I had given any details. I guess, fifteen years later, I figured you would have found out the truth somehow.”
be able to save him, should he take his grace back. But this isn’t a normal death. This is his body fulfilling his end of a deal that he’s ready to make. The last, good thing he was ever able to do. He’s so sure he’s dying. He believes it with all his might. And maybe, just maybe, he’s a little bit relieved. He isn’t strong enough to live.
this, Castiel realizes, and that makes his head spin. The pleasure is almost too much - he’s never felt this good before, never let himself be completely spread open, vulnerable, and
Her left eye is a bright, beet-red. He swallows thickly before asking again, “Who is killing the angels? And how? Is it you?”
“Thank you, Dean.”
Castiel doesn’t ask him what he means - he can’t. Dean vanishes, and Castiel is left to stare out the window, rolling his words around in his head like bullets pinched between the tips of his fingers.
“Um...Dean? It’s-it’s Castiel. I think I...I may have found something big. Some girl who knows about the apocalypse. She escaped from a psychiatric facility and...I don’t know what to do next. I could use some help.”
“I haven’t...done this. Not this way. I’m usually...the one on top.”
John sighs. “Good. Now, I’m gonna go get changed, and then I want you outside to help me look at the transmission. Your brother’s going to make dinner tonight.”
“Then let’s get out of here,” Castiel says quietly. “And we can make it up as we go.”
“I’ll go slow,” Dean promises him, his voice breathy. He climbs on top of Castiel and cups the back of his neck, gently pulling him up for a heated kiss. They both moan, soft and weak, when Dean finally lifts Castiel’s legs and guides himself inside. It’s not something Castiel is used to - his other sexual encounters, brief and hurried as they were, never ended with anyone else making love to him this way. He never let anybody else inside him, never let anyone touch him or press into him, let alone
a good idea; this part of the town was dangerous. If something happened to him...
“Dean,” he breathes, “What did you — “
In the kitchen, Gabriel is quick to show Dean the small pieces of chocolate aptly tucked away in the small cabinet above the gas stove. Castiel allows him one before sending Gabriel off to play with his toys in the living room. Dean is impressed with how willing Gabriel is to entertain himself - and with how clean he looks when he’s with Castiel. The grubby boy with the dirty shirt and wild hair Dean had seen before is nearly unrecognizable. Wordlessly, Castiel touches Dean’s arm and motions for him to follow him up the flight of steps and onto the top floor. The wooden stairs creak with their age, and the quaint, yet bland hallway at the foot of the stairs boasts two, dusty photographs; one of a woman, presumably Castiel’s mother, and another of all the Novak family sitting together on the sofa. Dean eyes the man with the scruffy beard - Castiel’s father, another member of the family Dean has never seen in person. Pushing open a chipped, white door with a wide crack down the middle, Castiel leads Dean into a bedroom with a large, black piano in the corner that takes up almost half the room.
He doesn’t know where Castiel is going. But something tells Dean he likely wouldn’t see him ever again, and that wherever he would go, it would be to a place where Dean couldn’t follow.
“I’ll try giving Lucifer another call. If he doesn’t pick up, I’ll track his phone...but if I cannot find him, we begin looking for what did this to me. And why.”
him, that familiar musk of faint cologne and pine from Benny’s time spent outdoors.
But Benny is right. Dean loves Castiel like the rain loves the breathing earth; inevitably. A love without stopping to ask why or how it came about. One, unable to exist without the other. And since the day Castiel ran, Dean hadn’t stopped thinking about ways to bring him home. To bring home back to
Patting his leg, Jodi gives him a small smile. “If you ever need anything else, my door is always open, kid,” she says. He nods, rubbing the back of his head. Dean thanks her again before she shoos him out, telling him to get home and do his homework that Dean already knows he isn’t going to do. He walks home alone, quickly, grateful that he’s beaten his dad back to the house when he finally pushes through the door. Dean would start heavily working in the shop next week, and he’s grateful he’d be able to hide his injury from his dad, at least for tonight. When Sam asks about it later, he says he got into a fight and doesn’t say anything more.
“I’m...glad, Dean. You were the one person I was hoping would hear it. That means so much coming from you.”
Castiel grits his teeth. “And when will that time come, exactly?”
It feels like the most natural thing in the world to run back to the pond’s edge and quickly begin flipping over rocks, looking for salamanders to beat his brother’s record. He keeps stealing glances at his mother, her brown skirt blowing in the wind, watching the two of them with her head held high. She’s happy, he realizes. They both are.
“I’m an angel. I was never a child.”
He’s in a small, one-room cabin. With a dusty window to his right and a rickety sprawl of chairs around a single table across from the bed. On one of the chairs is
“I’m sorry, Castiel,” is all she says. He’s sorry, too. Suddenly aware of the little cross dangling from the thin chain around his neck, he grips the pendant in his fist. It feels like a mockery, now. He rips it off and throws it into the grass.
“When do you start?”
Eradicated from the map.” Dean catches Castiel’s wide eyes and immediately looks away. Robert huffs a laugh, eyeing Castiel’s silent, disbelieving anger mapped across his face.
“Then don’t ask me,” Castiel says hoarsely. “He and I have been through too much. You have some level of authority in heaven, don’t you? Don’t ask me to do this. Find another way.”
. But instead, Castiel is
Castiel nods. Bewildered, Dean lets go of Castiel’s shoulders and leans back against the door, looking at him in disbelief.
who let his brother downtime and time again. Fleeing a broken home just to throw Lucifer into the arms of some drunk who can barely see straight on a good day. You know you deserved to be down there, Castiel. You’ve always been bright enough to see yourself for who you truly are: someone who’s better off buried six feet under and left to
Dean shakes his head frantically.
Castiel thinks suddenly to himself. He bolts upright in bed, scrambling to push the bedsheets aside with a shaking hand. “Lucifer.
“There’s a spell to banish the Witnesses,” Dean says quickly as he lowers his hand. He looks at Castiel. “You need to conduct it quickly. Or they’ll kill you.”
, don't you? And this man — " Naomi reaches down and grabs Castiel by the jaw, forcing him to look at her. " — this man is important to you, isn't he? More important than
Castiel breathes heavily as his older self releases him, turning away to lean his hands down against the table.

Downstairs, he hears Sam push through the door. In less than a minute, Dean can hear muffled yelling coming from downstairs; a sure sign that Sam and their father are going at it again. Sam never doing enough for the family. Sam using school work to “escape family responsibility.” The usual shit that Dean doesn’t want to deal with, but knows he has to for the sake of the sanity of the entire family. But Dean can't bring himself to break it up. Not now. He gives Castiel a pained, silent apology that Castiel dismisses with a wave of his hand.
“Brothers, right? They're real jerks,” Dean continues, trying to lighten the mood a little. “I’ve got one at home, too.”
“You’re the one who said that he needs to figure this out on his own, right?” Robert snaps. “So let him figure it out.”
Benny raises his eyebrows. “I’m glad. You weren’t doing nothing wrong.”
Later that night, after Castiel explained to Balthazar everything that he could about what Dean had told him, Castiel grabs his cellphone and flips it open, quickly dialing Lucifer’s number. His room is dark, and the crescent moon sitting high in the nighttime sky casts a thin film of light between the drawn curtains, cloaking half of Castiel’s face in a thin layer of moonlight. Castiel’s hand shakes as he holds the receiver to his ear, praying to a God he hardly believes in anymore for his brother to pick up the phone. The phone rings this time - it hadn’t before. But it takes him right to voicemail. With a sigh, Castiel bows his head and squeezes the phone tightly in his hand.
“You could come and visit our weirdo neighbor with me,” Dean suggests. Sam rolls his eyes.
Sam shrugs his shoulders. He turns his back to Dean, hurriedly dressing for bed with an impatient huff of breath.
Dean looks up, blinking down at him in wonder. “You sure?”
“Okay,” he says quickly. He isn’t expecting answers. And he doesn’t feel like wrestling them out of Dean, now. Even with the sleep he managed to get, he’d been wrestling answers about the apocalypse and the Seals all day. “Okay. It’s...midnight. And I guess I’m...your human shield now. What am I supposed to do?”
“Jo’ is pretty,” Castiel agrees. He sounds like he’s analyzing a painting instead of talking about an attractive girl in the grade above them. “She looks like a girl one might see on television.”
“What sent me to hell, then?” he rasps. All at once, he doesn’t care if she’s lying or not. He wants her to hurt. He drives the knife coated in holy water through her stomach and she screams again, her body writhing against the scorching blade. “Why did I go to hell? If I’m so
Castiel laughs bitterly. “You’re apologizing for the wrong things, Dean,” he says. They meet eyes again, and this time, Castiel doesn’t back down. He stares straight through him, letting Dean know just how serious he actually is.
Dean’s want pressing against his hip, the bulge in his pants twitching and aching against him, and Castiel no longer cares about God or fate or angels or even his own brother - he wants
Dean laughs. “It’s...not meant to be.”
“You have to come back to earth with me so we can stop Lucifer from starting the apocalypse. We might not have much time - if he hasn’t already, Lucifer only has one more Seal to break.” Castiel stares at him, unblinking. Refusing to let Dean believe this is all a figment of his own mind. If Dean is being reprogrammed as they speak, they don’t have much time.
When he dares look up at his haggard expression in the dirty mirror, a figure stands behind him, startling him. It takes him a moment to adjust to the sight, but he realizes with a sickening jolt that he
Dean doesn’t look up. Not even when Sam comes in and silently places something on the bedside table next to Dean before leaving again. Dean only cries softly into his pillow, slamming his fist down against the mattress with a soft groan as his whole body shakes and heaves. Finally, pushes himself upright as the weight of everything he’d just seem settles heavily in his chest. He looks beside him. On the table, Sam had left a bottle of beer and a small grilled cheese sandwich. Despite himself, Dean digs into the food, not realizing how hungry he’d been.
“So many damn
You don't have a choice, Jo
wants this, wants this
Castiel feels tears burn in his eyes. He curses under his breath, kicking aside his bag in frustration as he tries to press the back of his hand against his mouth to ground himself.
Dean realizes with a jolt.
Castiel’s face is red. His lip is swollen, and a dark, poorly-concealed bruise stretches across his jaw. He looks dazed and unable to focus his darting gaze on any one thing. Dean feels his stomach lurch.
“Angels...are a story," Castiel says slowly. "They...they are not like you…" His voice trails off -- awed and cautious. Hesitant to believe. The angel’s mannerisms do not align with Castiel’s perception of the creatures derived from the Bible. He is cocky, smirking, and seems comfortable prodding deep under Castiel’s skin.
“It was, uh...a fight,” Dean admits. “That kid back there -Benny - was in trouble. Three guys who are total assholes. I stepped in and they roughed me up. Cas’ scared ‘em off.”
anymore. He’s Michael. He’s the one burning this planet down to its ashes.
“Hey —” Castiel begins, wanting to demand answers to the inventory issue, but the other waves him off.
“You’re plenty smart yourself, Dean.”
Panicking, Castiel looks over to the others.
“I’ve told you before, Cas’. If anyone can get the hell out of here, it’s you.”
He recognizes that word. “Croatoan” is the name of the demon virus that turns people into raving, violent monsters. Castiel and Lucifer had dealt with a small outbreak of it several states over and nearly died trying to protect the rest of the town. He remembers it vividly, and now, the recollection brings uneasy goosebumps to his arms.
“Oh, I was about to,” Balthazar snaps. “I just knew it wouldn’t do anything.”
“Dean?” The question comes before Castiel can stop it. Dean raises his eyebrows, pulling his lower lip out from between his teeth.
“I’m an angel. Angel of the Lord. Though...I wouldn’t go basing your perception of me on what you've read. Since you do read the Bible, don’t you?”
He jerks Sam back, causing him to stumble against the wall before releasing his shirt. Without another word, John stalks out of the kitchen and up into his bedroom. Sparing one, wild look in his brother’s direction, Sam lets out a tortured groan before running upstairs to their room. Feeling dazed, Dean’s heart races in his chest as he lingers in the kitchen, feeling too numb to move right away. With a heavy heart and an ache in his ribs where John had shoved him into the table, he follows Sam upstairs.
“He was going to kill Lucifer,” Lucifer’s voice says, not looking up from the sight of older Castiel’s bleeding body. His brother’s voice is otherworldly, measured, and not his own. Castiel realizes, with a jolt, that it’s the Devil speaking through him. With a shaking hand, the Devil reaches into the dying Castiel’s jacket pocket and pulls out the tablet.
He stares at Dean, aware that there’s a faint hint of a
“I created a pocket dimension and put her there. She’ll be safe.”
“Dean, I’m going to need your help with the car.”
She covers her mouth with her hand and shakes her head in barely-contained laughter. And that’s how this day went so many years ago - all three of them laughing. Castiel splashing water on Lucifer, vowing to dunk him under the water, their mother watching fondly and laughing right along. These are their good clothes, and their father would rage at them for soiling them with water. But their mother would clean them to perfection later. Their father isn’t here, and he would never know.

“Not bad,” another older man says once Castiel is finished.
“Hey, hey! Look, whatever’s going on, we can deal with it, okay? Dad, I told you I can pick up extra hours if you need me to — “
“Come in, or don’t. The choice is yours, Castiel. You know what happens when you disobey me.”
“Just leave me alone,” Castiel whispers. “Please.”
Jo closes her eyes, placing both of her hands on his head. “Sorry if this hurts,” she murmurs. Castiel doesn’t have time to comment. Before he can so much as blink, the inside of his head ignites in a terrible, horrible fire. He screams, unable to move, unable to even push her away as the fire grows and roars, scorching his insides to nothing but molten liquid in his body.
“You’re hiding her,” Castiel says slowly, realization dawning in his voice. “You’re...disobeying heaven to protect her.”
are ugly...and it’s your fault.”
Dean rolls himself on top of Castiel, kissing him softly as he cradles his face in his hands. Castiel is grateful for Dean’s weight, for his presence, and for him. Without him, Castiel doesn’t know if he would have had the strength to keep going in the past couple of months.
“Oh, don’t you give us that look,” the other angel snaps. “It’s one town. Blowing this place off the map means killing a few thousand versus several
Castiel sighs impatiently. “Look, I didn’t come here to cause problems, okay? I just want to figure out why I’m supposed to be here and get back to my own time. My - our brother is out there. He needs me.”
“She would talk about these ‘seals,’ whatever that meant. She said that there were six-hundred sixty-six of them. And that if someone broke sixty-six...then the Devil would rise from the Cage of hell. Something like that, I don’t know...she went on and on about it. I swear, the girl was a good storyteller, I’ll give her that much…”
Castiel nods quickly. “Yes. Balthazar found that out — wait.
Balthazar’s voice interrupts the onslaught of the intrusive memory, sending Castiel reeling back into the present. “Only angels can save a soul from hell. No other beings have that kind of power.”
Castiel watches Dean with heavy eyes as Michael lights his cigarette.
the religious one here, aren’t you?” Balthazar asks. “I’d have thought you of all people would believe in this whole angel...business.”
Giving him one final look, Castiel wrenches his gaze away and charges towards the clearing, his heart pumping in his chest as he makes his way for the clearing. Scrambling over one of the rocks, he slides down and makes his way for a large, dark opening between two in the middle of the thick ocean of rocks.
Castiel turns the key of the ignition and drives off into the night towards Balthazar’s house.
“I’m gonna get a beer,” Dean announces. “You want anything?”
“It’s late, Dean,” Castiel says at last. “Your father will be missing you.”
Not that Castiel is surprised, but Dean is a quick learner. Soon, Castiel is completely inside Dean’s warm mouth, and Castiel lays back as his eyes flutter shut. He has to resist the urge to thrust into Dean’s mouth, and it takes all his willpower not to
. We had nothing left. I can’t let you do this to yourself.”
“My father hit me. Gabriel saw it happen and ran between us. My father shoved him aside and pushed him down the stairs. He died of head trauma, but he was unconscious the entire time. He didn’t feel any pain.”
“You know,” Balthazar begins slowly. “As much as I’m practically dancing to know what pulled you out, I’d also like to know what put you in that pit in the first place, Castiel.”
Castiel pulls his hand away sharply. “Well, I don’t blame him! There’s nothing left to fight for, Jo! Nothing. The world is going to end one way or another, and as far as I’m concerned, I’m finished trying to clean up the messes your kind decided to make.”
but it’s damn close enough.”
so now all the angel destiny bullcrap is
Castiel nods. His stomach flutters with nerves - but the light inside him, Jo’s grace, fills him with a renewed hope.
“Cas?” Dean whispers.
. Before I really give you something to get all scared about. I won’t hear any of that disrespect in this house. You don’t like the way I run things, you can get the hell out!”
"Dunno. That was weird. I think he fell out of that tree…"
“It won’t be,” Castiel says. “I promise.”
“Oh! Yeah. Uh...you still want me to?”
It became an unspoken agreement between the two to keep their heads down when Dean's father was around. He never told Castiel about his father's comments, but he never had to. Castiel could sense Dean's aching discomfort around his dad, always more in-tune with Dean's emotions than he ever was to his own. And so, it was a dance. When they're with Sam, they are friends. When they're with Dean's father, they're acquaintances. When they're alone...they're good friends. They talk and laugh about school. Sometimes they even talked about their families.
He grabs it from Michael, who gives him a hard shove. With the older brother being much bigger — and stronger — Castiel stumbles back, tripping over the bottom step and landing on the second step hard on his rear end.
“Blimey. Sounds like a crappy date.”
how I’m feeling right now,” Castiel snaps. “The only thing keeping me from ripping you apart right now is the fact that
“I’ll hold you to that.”
Dean claps his hand together. “
As he pulls himself to his feet above the shallow grave that held his body only moments ago, he looks around him, realizing he’s at the center of what looks like a massive blast site. Before him, a circle of trees bows before the earth in an empty field, flattened by some massive force as though his very Lazarus-esque act had been enough to send a force out for almost a mile around. The grass beneath his shoes is dry and crunchy. Something was here. Something big. Castiel is alone, and he is not in hell any longer. He is confused, weak, tired, and unbearably thirsty. Behind him, the shadow of the cross which marked his grave disappears and reappears as the sun dips in and out of the clouds.
They look at one another and laugh nervously. Castiel feels years younger, like a teenager giggling over a crush. An experience he never got to have when the time had come for him to have it.
Faintly, Castiel remembers Dean mentioning someone named Samuel. He wonders just how many brethren he’s lost for the price of love.
If it's not obvious already, "The End" and "Sacrifice" are my two favorite SPN episodes. I was very,
“I don’t give my real name,” the bartender laughs. “But you can call me Alfie.”
“I’m blaming you for this, Dean,” Castiel groans. Dean rolls his eyes, standing up to walk over to the pair. A single dandelion draws Gabriel’s attention, and Dean gives Castiel a soft laugh when Castiel tumbles to his feet, only to collapse down onto his back beside Dean on the cool grass.
“Yeah, yeah, sure...maybe tomorrow then?” he asks hopefully. “You can meet my brother, Sam. He’s a weirdo, but I promise he’s not a jerk like your brother is.”
"I will walk home alone," Castiel says quickly. He snags his backpack off the floor, his movements jerky and uncoordinated. "I will see you tomorrow."
“Yes. You’ll just need to take it slow. I have lubricant in my drawer.” Even now, Castiel’s voice trembles with nerves. He wants this - he
Sam sighs. “I do. But...Dean, is this about finding Castiel? Is that why you want to go?”
“I may have enough money saved...Seattle. I’ve heard Seattle is...is a good music scene. No more playing for men in the dark. No more...any of this.” He looks at Dean, his gaze taking on an intensity Dean is unused to. Hesitantly, Dean pushes himself off the lawn to sit upright to look at him better.
I will try to update every Tuesday. As of now, I'm planning on this work being 12 chapters, but that still
Castiel clamps his mouth shut. Dazed, Dean blinks, trying to understand what Castiel is trying to say. He doesn’t understand him any more than he understood him the first day that he met him. Any more than he understands Castiel disappearing at night to work a strange job at a dive bar downtown.

He lifts his head, reaching a hand out to her when she tilts her head. “Jo, why are you here? Are you in danger? Is something coming after you?”
"Not bloody likely!" He launches himself at Castiel again, and Castiel neatly sidesteps the attack, ducking under his arm. He smells a whiff of alcohol - Balthazar is drunk.
Dean frowns, wiping his chin when a dribble of milk spills down past his lips. “I think it was my Father. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen his face. He was throwing a ball at me and I kept dropping it. He told me if I couldn’t catch it, I wouldn’t be ready.”
“Problem being,” Dean continues, “I may be in trouble. With the other angels. I, uh...the whole ‘sticking Jo in a pocket dimension’ thing? They can’t prove that but, uh - they know Jo and I were close back in heaven. And since she resurfaced, they’ve been able to pick up traces of where she’s been. And where I’ve been.”
Sitting alone, Dean peers out across the water, the gentle push and pull of the incoming tide not quite reaching his feet in the sand. Castiel watches him for a moment, the breeze stirring his hair as he squints against the sun. This must be Dean’s heaven - a beach. He didn’t even think angels - archangels - had their own heaven. Hesitantly, he pads across the white sand, wondering if Dean knows that he’s here, or if he simply is ignoring his presence. When Castiel walks up beside him, Dean doesn’t even look up; he stares across the water, transfixed on the gentle waves as he hugs his knees close to his chest.
on those freaks when they were pounding on me. I barely know him, but Benny isn’t a bad guy. We should help him. It’s the right freaking thing to do.”
“You use your vessel’s name?” Castiel asks hesitantly. “Do most angels do that?”
the essence of who she is - spark, her rebellion, and her fiery determination. But with that, he can feel her sorrow, too. Her loneliness. That brief, flicker of solitude that rests deep within her being startles Castiel, making him want to reach out to her and pull her into a tight hug.
“I can’t see,” she whimpers. Castiel can only stare, silent and wordless as his gaze darts between her and Balthazar. Panic rises in this throat as his hands begin to shake, gaping at Balthazar wordlessly as he gropes to take her shaking hand in his.
“Dean, you find what you need for the spell. Balthazar and I will hold them off.”
flipping clue who or what I actually am, sweetheart."
“Dean. This is real. I’m
"Why? It's stuffy."
“Hey, don’t thank me. I’m just speaking the truth. Like I said, man...you’re the kinda guy who’s gonna get a record deal someday. You’ll be out of this town like it’s nothing.” He claps Castiel over the shoulder. Their shared smile is sad.
Castiel feels a tremble threaten to run through his body again.
He swallows, shifting his legs to cross them the other way when the itch in his lower gut comes back.
unannounced. You’re lucky he didn’t
“Dean, what are you — what
“He changed his mind,” Castiel rasps. “He doesn’t want this anymore.”
Dazed, Dean nods. “He wasn’t bad. Never did anything wrong...he just asked too many questions. The archangels...we weren’t supposed to ask questions. No angels should, but especially not us. He...he was worried that humans would bring about the downfall of heaven. Questioned my father’s motives..criticized human’s use of fire...war...their selfishness. But he never hurt nobody. I’m the only one left who remembers...but my Father painted him as the worst of us all before He left. Said Samuel was evil. Cruel. And I’m afraid of what Samuel will do once he’s free. If I was him...hell, I’d raze the whole planet to dust. He’s been alone in that cage for eons.”
Jo folds her hands behind her back. “The angels told me,” she says simply. “Your brother, Lucifer...the angels don’t like him very much. He is going to start the apocalypse. And they expect you to stop him.”
A flash of light makes Castiel’s eyes fly open again, just in time to see Dean plunge his blade into Alastair’s chest. Alastair howls in pain as a brilliant light erupts from his eyes and mouth. Castiel scrambles back, shielding his eyes as he gapes at Dean in disbelief.
“Me?” Dean asks. His voice is barely above a whisper.
“No,” Castiel interrupts. “It was stupid.”
The other Castiel huffs. For a brief moment, a small hint of a smile flickers across his face.
“Sorry, Dean," Michael grumbles over his cigarette. He jams a finger in Castiel's direction. "This one likes to act like he owns the place. Feel free to rough him up if he starts running his mouth again. Now get outside before I take a sledgehammer to that piece of out-of-tune crap. Go be useful and show the new kid around the town or something.”
Before either of them can say another word, the lunch bell rings. Castiel stands abruptly from his seat, marching towards the lunch tray drop-off and hurrying out of the lunchroom before Dean can even call out his name. Stunned, Dean follows suit as Castiel disappears. They’ve always left lunch together — always. Clearly, something is up with him. And, though Dean doesn’t want to think about it, he knows it has something to do with his absence the past couple of days.
when he dares to do something to disobey his brother or his father whom Dean has never even seen. It hurts like a rock in Dean’s stomach.
“Alright,” Dean murmurs. “You’ll be alright?”
. The words are unspoken and clear as the sunny, autumn day. Dean turns up the album, grateful for the distraction, and even more grateful that Castiel doesn't seem to mind.
Dean. Don’t do this!”
When Castiel comes to, he has a wicked headache. His vision spins into focus as he groans softly to himself, registering that he’s sitting upright with his hand secured to a bedpost by a metal handcuff. He tugs at it uselessly, baring his teeth as he tries to make sense of his surroundings.
“You will.” Jo closes her eyes and reaches a hand up to gently cup Castiel’s face. Unable to push her away in time, he stumbles back as a warm flood of heat erupts from her fingers, making his vision swim. He pushes her away, but it’s already too late. His vision spins as a whirl of color makes him feel weak in the knees. As her stern face shifts and fades away from his line of view, a rush of vertigo sends him tumbling to the floor before his vision blacks out.
After they eat, Castiel wanders over to the table where Balthazar often studied lore, bent over the table, reading diligently through different books and countless other texts. He traces his fingers across the open bible - his own Bible - and across the notes that they’d both taken in the margins. He thinks about how hard Balthazar had worked to help Castiel save the world. How heavy with grief Balthazar had been over the loss of his sister to a force he couldn’t understand. From the doorway, Dean watches him, keeping his distance.
Dean blinks, pulling his hand away from Castiel’s shoulder, severing the connection. His stomach sinks.
“It’s going,” Dean says. “I dunno. I like it.”
“Yeah, you told me,” Castiel growls under his breath. His heart hammers in his chest as he tries to sound braver than he feels. “And yet you failed to specify what kind of
The church is quiet. On a Thursday afternoon, it’s empty of any inhabitants. The lead he has on Joanne is weak, at best - but it’s all he has. He slips in through the back, breaking the lock with a stone laying on the cracked parking lot. Above him, the sun hangs heavy in the sky, making him sweat as he looks around to ensure he’s not being observed.
She flicks her eyes up to the ceiling, pursing her lips in a mock expression of thought. “I don’t know,” she says with an attempt at a shrug. “Maybe you need to get a little more creative with that blade to jog my memory.”
The extended melody that Castiel wrote himself was inspired by
“Are you gonna give that necklace back to that kid, or what?” Sam asks. Rolling his eyes, Dean drags himself out of bed, glaring at Sam before hastily pulling on a pair of clothes. Taking the necklace from his bedside table, Dean weighs it in his hand. It’s the kind of necklace a woman would wear - not a young, teenage boy.
“Lots of people. They were all people from one of my old schools, though. There was this girl named Cassie. She was
No, he wants this as badly as his head is screaming at him that he doesn’t. He wants to prove to himself that he can overcome the abuse he’s delved onto himself for as long as he can remember. Plus, this is purely practical, right? Dean needs to hide. Castiel offered to help. Angels wouldn’t find them here. Dean would be safe and so would he.
“No -” he whimpers. “No. Castiel —!”
"You're gonna stay and help unpack," their father says. Sam, always one for steely logic, passes their father a sharp glare.
Dean’s eyes sparkle as his mouth moves around that word: faith.
He takes off across the lawn, leaving Castiel alone with Dean. Dean grins and shakes his head. With a careful hand, he brushes loose strands of grass from Castiel’s hair.
we need to go to a —
. He’ll be in danger if there are more.”
That day, Castiel feels lighter. He presses a soft kiss to Dean’s temple as they sit on the ground, surrounded by the people they lost and the memories they’d given to them along the way.
Castiel offers him a small smile. “Thank you.”
Castiel bites his lip. “That’s...that’s good,” he says quietly. Consent. Regard for human well-being. It might be the most angelic thing he’s heard out of Dean’s mouth since the day they met. “So...you’ve never had sex?” Castiel asks hesitantly.
Castiel gives him a long, knowing look. “Did you ever tell anybody you gave the Archangel Michael a handjob in the backseat of your car?”
“Where is the girl?” Castiel breathes. Dean is standing stiffly in the middle of the room, staring at the door. Castiel quickly regains his bearings and pushes himself from the wall with a grunt. “What did you do with her?”
He drives the blade into her flesh again and again. Blood dribbles from her mouth, causing her to cough and sputter. Castiel is numb; he can’t feel. Can’t think. The only thing grounding him is the sound of the blade slicing through her suit, through her stomach, through her organs. Her pain. Not his. Her pain, hers. His brother wouldn’t do that, would never, ever do that, Lucifer loved him, loved him as Castiel loved him, always —
Castiel laughs without humor, placing his hands on his hips as he looks down at the floor. “My father was on the verge of starting a cult before I took my brother and ran. I was the one who...who defended our father until the day he…”
“Gone,” Castiel croaks out. His voice feels hoarse and weak like he hadn’t used it in some time. “It’s gone. It’s all gone.”
Castiel seems perplexed. “Isn’t seventh grade a little bit young to be kissing other people?”
On the ground, the newspaper unrolls itself. The headline at the top of the page reads:
Castiel manages a small smile. “If it means anything, you probably made the right choice. It seems...confusing up there. And bloody.”
But Michael isn’t sick. Not anymore. Are you, Michael?”
Castiel shakes his head. Truthfully, he doesn’t know what he wants. He hates having lived with no sense of self. The shame of years upon years of repression and lingering murmured whispers of the evils of being gay. He just spent a half-hour in the car with an angel who told him that angels don’t care. That God Himself doesn’t care. He may not know why he went to hell, but surely that couldn’t be it. Could it?
On the grass outside, Dean lays down beside the large oak tree in the Novaks’ front yard. In the slick grass damp from last night’s rain, he watches as Gabriel chases Castiel around the yard, trying to scare him with his fake mustache. Occasionally, Castiel lets out a dramatic groan of fear and topples to the wet ground, letting Gabriel pounce on his older brother. His tiny fists beat against Castiel’s chest, sending them both into hysterical laughter. Dean is grinning the entire time, enjoying the sunshine finally reaching from behind the misty clouds.
It isn’t three weeks after the incident that Dean spots Castiel in the hall. He has to physically hold himself back from launching himself at his friend and throwing his arms around his neck in a massive hug. Dean nearly trips as he stumbles over to Castiel’s locker where his friend stands stiff, loading books into his backpacks. His vision tunnels and darkens around him, not caring about a single thing except for the sight of his friend. Dean’s hand lands on his shoulder as he turns him around with a wide grin.
Castiel shakes his head. He grabs his shoes, silent and stiff as he pulls them on his feet. Concerned, Dean sets his magazine down on the floor with a puzzled frown.
idea, okay?” Dean growls. “You have
to him. He doesn’t even want to think about how many times Dean has frequented places like his before. It makes him feel tight and on-edge like his skin is suddenly red-hot with an itch he doesn’t know how to scratch. Castiel crosses his legs, trying not to draw attention to himself or to the strange way that Dean’s presence here makes him feel.
Dean wishes he knew what to say. He hates being helpless — and he hates his friend being helpless even more.
“His brother is a jerk,” she says shortly. “His father is a psychopath. I’m surprised, living next door, you haven’t heard them bring the whole house down with their fighting. Their little boy, Gabriel, must be so scared. Castiel loves that boy, but I think he fears for him, too.”
like Dean in ways he knows he’ll never be able to wash off and will never truly
Finding the camp isn’t hard. On the outside of the city, Castiel finds the gates with CAMP CHITAQUA plastered across the wooden sign hanging near the gated entrance. He parks a distance away from the camp, climbing out of his car with his gun in his hand as he inspects the border, trying his best to remain hidden from the guards. He doesn’t recognize the faces of the guards from a distance, and, not knowing the rules of this broken world, fears getting too close.
“Castiel - “
“I would like that,” Castiel says. “Goodbye, Dean. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Dean breathes a sigh. “You’re angry.”
He glances at his Bible again and ponders over every question that the book could never answer. Every question he’s never wanted that book to answer. In a quiet fit of frustration, Castiel looks away.
“And for the record,
“No. Only a select few of us ever knew about the Angel Tablet. They all died assisting me in the trials. These people are going to serve as a diversion so that you and I can go around the hill and down to the barn - that’s where Lucifer is hiding with the Devil inside of him.”
Happy
to him.
“Whoa, you alright?” Dean asks. “You sure you don’t wanna leave? I’d be lying if I said I didn’t kinda
“Well...then only you and I would know that, wouldn’t we? So I can’t possibly be lying. I’m just as much you as you are.”
Dean swallows a thick lump in his throat. Tears drip down the eldest brother’s face. Silently, Sam motions for Dean to follow him downstairs. Numbly, Dean follows him into the kitchen, feeling his whole body shake and tremble with the weight of it all In the kitchen, Sam pulls the phone off of the receiver on the wall and hands it to Dean. His hand trembles as he accepts it, feeling the world spin around him in a flurry of motion and unbearable pain. His fingers shake as he dials 9-1-1. And when the operator answers, Dean’s voice feels very small and far away.
“This,” the other says quietly, “is the Angel Tablet. It’s an instrument of heaven. It has instructions engraved on it to close the gates of heaven forever and cut off all of heaven’s angels from their power.”
“Naomi,” he says quietly. Of course, it’s her - Castiel could feel her presence the minute she entered the room, stifling and sharp. She smiles, cold and unfeeling as she crouches down to meet his terrified gaze.
He speaks the words as though he already knows the answer.
Castiel thinks hysterically to himself, listening to Dean’s agonized cries of pain.
“Leave her alone,” Castiel rasps. “You can get all the information you want about the apocalypse from me if that’s what you’re after. Leave her out of this.”
Behind Lucifer — Samhain — Dean and Robert appear. The two of them raise their hands as a blinding flash of light erupts through the room, forcing Castiel to turn away. The roar erupts in his ears, the light making the handprint scar on his shoulder tingle and burn. He drops to his knees as the roar grows louder and louder, so loud he has to clap his hands over his ears. A wave of dizziness washing over him, and soon, Castiel can no longer stand. He slips into a tunnel of black as his eyes roll back in his head.
Stunned, Castiel blinks at Dean. His head is foggy and sluggish - must be a concussion. It takes him a minute to register Dean’s words. “My brother...Lucifer...came in and killed Naomi? I don’t understand.”
“And why does it have to be me?” Castiel asks quietly. “Why do I have to kill my own brother? Why can’t the angels just do it and be done with it?”
Gabriel giggles.
as in destroyed by heavenly power. Vaporized.
Their daily routines don’t change much. However, as time passes, Castiel decides to hunt more. He doesn't do it as often as he used to, and he doesn’t travel far. He keeps the hunts local to the state and even begins to show Dean a couple of techniques.
Castiel runs his hands down his face, already feeling overwhelmed. “I’m not strong. I’m not who you think I am. My brother is going down a path that I can’t follow and I don’t know how to stop it.”
Finally, after a fumble of awkward shifting on the bed, Castiel is half-slumped against the headboard with Dean laying between his legs. A line of light, red hickeys trail down from Castiel’s chest down to his hips where Dean had kissed and gently sucked little marks on his skin. He brushes his thumb over one of them and Castiel shivers.
Castiel gapes at him. “
“Blimey - I’m getting her to the hospital,” Balthazar says quickly. Castiel’s head swims as Balthazar takes her and rushes her to the car as Castiel stumbles out after them, watching him hurry her away. The handprint tingles again. Castiel wishes he could rip it off his skin.
“Wait, really?”
Castiel sighs. Distant. Yes. Distant is the word. He sits down on the chair opposite Balthazar. His legs feel weak and rubbery, like the muscles aren’t quite accustomed to movement just yet. His fingers find the Bible on the table - his Bible. The well-read bookmarked copy of his own Bible. The cover, sleek and black, is a familiar touch under Castiel’s calloused fingers. He takes it into his hands, feeling its familiar weight.
Camp Chitaqua. Castiel has never heard of that place before. But if this message is to be trusted, then he might be able to find the answers he’s looking for.
“Hey,” Dean says quietly. “It’s alright. It’s gonna sound...good, Cas’. Just pretend that I’m not here.”
for me. Not to mention he’s handsome and -”
as Castiel - what the hell had it ever given to him in return? The thought stirs a thread of anger in Dean’s chest, but he quickly pushes it down. Castiel wouldn’t want him to be angry now.
On the last day of school before Christmas break, Dean is finishing a shift at the garage when Castiel comes to visit him with his little brother bundled in a dark, green jacket and hat, trotting along loyally beside his older brother. He hasn’t seen Gabriel often; occasionally, he’d wave at the kid if he walked Castiel right home after school, his little face always pressed up against the window in wait for his older brother.
“She gave us the location and was even kind enough to translate the instructions for us. But during the translation, one of my men had a little bit too much fun with the angel and killed her. And the last trial that we needed was extracting the grace of an angel. We couldn’t extract it in time, and now I’m left with nothing but tightened defenses on Michael’s front and no means of finding another one of his angels less we open ourselves up to a massive, insurmountable attack.”
And yet Castiel swears all he can do is laugh lest he cries instead.
“You might have even beat your brother’s record, don’t you think? He caught a big one last week, but…” She holds out her palms for Lucifer to give her the salamander for her to inspect. “This one might take the cake.”
“Demons have a way of tricking people into making deals, don’t they? They might not always be clear about their intentions, at least according to -- “
Be mindful that, in this chapter, there will be a lot of homophobia and more examples of emotional and physical abuse taking place. As I've said in the tags and in my responses to the wonderful comments I've been receiving, this story WILL have a happy ending.
“Do you want to stay?” Castiel asks seriously.
“Dean,” Castiel says after a long moment. “That was you in my dream the other night. Wasn’t it?”
The way he looks at her with a protective longing in his eyes makes Castiel’s chest tighten where he stands.
. Relief floods through Castiel’s chest. The creature hadn’t killed him.
“Yes?”
Castiel swallows. “Okay. Thank you, Jo. For everything.”
didn’t deserve this.
He’s not here to relive this perfect day. He has a mission - a promise he made both to Jo and himself. Was this what Jo meant by being tempted to stay…?
“Grace from an angel is life. If I bury this vial here, it might make the soil less rocky and gross. And in the springtime, flowers will grow. My brother...he always liked the gardens humans would grow over time. I never really understood it. But he liked flowers. I figured, um, if we’re building a little memorial here...maybe I could make one for Sammy?”
You’ll have to keep moving along whatever path is presented to you until you find him...if it isn’t already too late. Alastair is the one who reprograms “defective” angels up in heaven. And he is ruthless and effective. Dean will be going right to him.”
"Not likely," Naomi scoffs. "Give me the girl, first, and maybe we can work out a deal. You angels still honor the old practice of
“I must go, Dean,” Castiel says quietly. He’s still smiling,
“I-I’m sorry, Dean. I can’t. I just...I need to sleep. You should too. Balthazar’s bedroom — you can sleep there.”
Castiel nods. “Thank you.”
Then, he remembers jerking off a virgin angel in the backseat of his own car before he disappeared into the night. Castiel blinks at the far wall, feeling a strange combination of pride and existential dread. Pulling himself out of bed, he hurries out of his room and downstairs, relieved when he sees Balthazar sitting in his recliner, still in his robe from the night before, reading the newspaper.
“The cops won’t do
“Dean.”
“I found one! Cas, I found one, look!”
with this other man. He knows himself well enough to spot those little movements - the way Castiel shrugs his shoulders, tilts his head one too many times while he talks, the way he’s surely cracking some stupid joke he’d be hellishly embarrassed about later.
Dean flushes all over again. He blinks, trying to find the words. He always knew that...didn’t he? That he loved Castiel. He simply never strung those words together before. He’d do anything for Castiel. He’d looked and looked and looked...followed the stories. He’d stood up to his brother. He’d wanted to run away with him, to be by his side…
Castiel swallows. “I thought you didn’t...gather with other hunters.”
“I...why wouldn’t it be?” he whispers.
With a jolt, Dean realizes this is his cue to leave. He turns and bolts away from the door, hurrying down the hall before Castiel has a chance to exit the room. He hides behind the dumpsters by the door until he sees Castiel walk outside. Castiel shakes his hands excitedly as he all but skips down the parking lot and hurries down the sidewalk. Dean doesn’t think he’s ever seen his friend so happy or elated.
“I didn’t need to. I was just curious.”
“Yes, you could, Dean,” Castiel says gently. “Would you like to try?”
“I think so. Dammit. I wanted to, um, make you food. And for myself. Didn’t work, though. Uh, good morning, by the way. Did you sleep okay?”
Well, he gets it. He had stepped outside the cabin for all of a half-hour. He’d been attacked by those infected with the Croatoan virus. He doesn’t need to see anything else.
“These were her drawings,” she says. “Joanne was a good artist in her own right, but she always drew such dark things.”
and soft words of encouragement that spur Dean on more. He presses in deep and brushes against a tight spot that makes Castiel whimper out Dean’s name.
Dean scowls. “Well, he’s kind of a jerk anyway, isn’t he?”
“Proposing marriage?” Benny suggests. Dean punches him again, which only sends Benny -- and Dean -- into a roar of laughter. He’s grateful for Benny - grateful he can diffuse the tension like this. That he isn’t mad.
Balthazar pinches the bridge of his nose. “So you have no idea what sent you down there? None at all? Because I’m getting the feeling that maybe whatever pulled you down like that could have had the power to drag you out, too.” He sighs. “Look. I know a psychic - she’s the best there is. Little flirty. Pretty lady, though. I’m gonna contact her and see if she can get this figured out.”
He lost track of the time at least an hour ago. Like a tide pushes and pulls its way to the shore, Dean is mindless in his search for a spot of earth suitable for his task at hand. Somewhere across state lines, he drives with the early-morning sun at his back, the car silent, save for the hum of the engine as he speeds down the highway. Eventually, he finds it like he’d been pulled here by some unknown force of will. Instinctive. Intuitive, maybe. Whatever it is, Dean knows he’s found the right place as the dawn of a new day rises steadily over the horizon.
His figure remains shrouded by the wet leaves, though the tree from where he watches the family is only several yards away from the house the new family would make their home. Two boys, the older just about his age, and a father. No mother in sight. The older brother, a gruff, broad-shouldered boy even at his young age, kicks a puddle of water at his younger brother's already-soaked clothes. The younger boy shoves him angrily, causing the older boy to laugh. Even Castiel laughs a little at the banter.
He throws her spasming body to the floor with an impatient huff. She claws at her throat uselessly, and Castiel has to step back, disturbed by the sight before him. Finally, as blood pools across the floor, her body twitches, and stills.
Castiel rolls his eyes. “Yes. I assumed as much.” The two dancers they’d seen by the door look over. The taller man with dark hair and freckles below his eyes winks at Castiel again. He shifts in his chair, catching sight of Dean’s wide grin.
“I suppose it’s safe to presume your relationship with your dead daddy is still just as complicated as it was when you poured your heart out to me down there. Remember that? I was curious and you wanted the pain to stop. I don’t even think you had it in you to lie. That was a rough day for you, wasn’t it?”
Cas’.”
“Then call the police. Report it.”
Thank you for reading!! I will try to update every Tuesday.
“Cas’ — Cas’, what happened?” he gasps. Castiel turns to face him, his eyes filled with tears. Michael follows his younger brother outside, looking dazed and pale. He glances between the two, unable to believe what he’s seeing. Michael barely acknowledges that Dean is there at all.
then who
Castiel swallows, almost too afraid to ask any more questions. “Okay...and Dean? What about Dean?”
“No, no, he’s fine,” Dean says quickly. “He just...I dunno what got into him today.” He jerks in pain when she dabs the peroxide on his wound again.
That puzzles Dean, but he doesn’t push. Couldn't he just tell them he'd be a little late...? But then again, Dean knows better than to question his own father's demands - when he has them.
“Cas’,” Dean huffs, “It’s really not...a big deal. You just do it when you want to, and when the other person wants to. No real rhyme or reason to it, most of the time.”
She gives him a long, dark look, but says nothing more. Castiel glances between them, confused as ever, not daring to expect to receive any answers. Dean sighs.
“Where is Naomi?” he asks hoarsely. Dean sits down in the chair across from Castiel’s bed.
Dean breaks the silence between them. “So...stipulations are I don’t burn dinner?” he asks. Castiel rolls his eyes, swatting him playfully on the shoulder.
Castiel frowns. “Dean, I’m real. Jo brought me here to find you. You need to come back to earth with me - Lucifer is going to raise the Devil soon and I need your help.”
“So you’re telling me you’ve
“Castiel.”
Dean nods, giving him a small wink that makes Castiel struggle not to choke. He collapses into the closest chair near a smaller stage, looking around him with a hard press of his lips as Dean shoves his hands into his pant pockets and approaches the bar. Castiel is baffled that this comes so
“Not only that, but we can ward the doors if we’re careful. No one’s gonna know, at least for tonight. Should shake ‘em off my tail until I can come up with a good cover why I’ve been tuned out of angel radio for the past few days.”
“I don’t know what to say,” Dean breathes, a sad smile stretching across his face.
Swallowing thickly, Castiel pages through the notebook. Rough, rigid sketches in black and blue pencil scour across the pages, each more terrifying than the next. One depicts a startlingly familiar scene: Samhain rising from the cracks of the warehouse as a figure -
“Yes,” he says quietly. His eyes are wide as they land over Dean’s, wide and strained. As though the very foundation of Castiel’s strength is in looking at Dean. As though ripping his gaze away would unravel every, carefully-woven thread Castiel has achingly stitched together in his own mind and leave him in ruin. Dean grasps at Castiel’s hand with both of his, desperate to understand, even though the truth is horrifically, achingly simple. He’s never touched him like this in public; if he could hear the snickers and pointed laughs directed at them, he would have punched somebody in the face then and there.
I can put on a good show up in heaven, but I’m not like them. Not anymore. And they’re starting to catch on.”
“It’s not just about that,” Dean protests weakly. “I want to get out of here with you, man. I hate it here. I just need to get away.”
Dean is silent for a long moment before he speaks again.
Castiel rolls his eyes. “I look at them because they look at
But Castiel says nothing. He storms back into the circle of the demon trap, grabs her face roughly in his hand, and shoves the salt directly into her other eye. Like before, she screams and even tries to twist away before he lets her go and steps back to watch her. And like before, her screams trail off into weak laughter as she spits out some of the salt that had trickled between her lips.
Castiel nearly jumps out of his seat when Dean sits back down, sliding the glass of whiskey across the table. Castiel takes it and finishes it in several, quick gulps, breathing a heavy sigh when he places the glass back down.
But he does. Wrapped in their mess of limbs and happy sighs, Castiel feels content. He feels at peace. He feels at
“He’s my friend,” Castiel says quickly, wincing at Balthazar. “Not my pet.” Dean makes an indignant noise. Castiel has half a mind to push him out the front door and slam it in his face. Not that Dean couldn’t just walk back in whenever he wants to.
Castiel blinks at him. He doesn’t know what to say. He’s never been called
“You were so
Dean sucks in a quiet breath. A moment of silence greets him. He doesn't dare look around the door in fear of being caught. But sure enough, the tense silence is greeted by the sound of the drifting piano. Dean recognizes the song almost immediately - “Goodbye Stranger” by Supertramp. The song Castiel had asked him to play again and again, one he had been transfixed by on the record player. As Dean listens, the melody drifts through the open door, clear as day, without a single note or chord out of place. Even the rhythm and the pacing sound completely perfect. Dean doesn’t have to watch Castiel play to know that he doesn’t have a music sheet to look off of; he’s playing the entire thing by memory. Transfixed, Dean passes a thick swallow. He’s never, ever heard anything like it, especially from somebody who can listen to a song and play it back so perfectly.
“Dean,” Castiel says slowly. “This isn’t you. You didn’t want this. On the beach, remember? We were going to run. We were going to figure this out
“No problem.”
decide not to smite your ass. Deal?"
“I said nice
Dean sighs. Despite his neighbor's odd behavior, he knows that this is his best shot at making a friend his age. He can’t remember the last time he actually had a friend that he knew for more than a couple of weeks at a time. He wouldn’t admit it, especially not to Sam, but it was his own loneliness driving him towards any opportunity for companionship. He could always ditch the kid if he proved to be as weird as he seemed.
“My bed’s right there,” Dean suggests. “Take a nap or something.”
“Let’s go.”
“No, I’m not scared of much these days,” he says quietly. He drives the blade through the cloth of her suit and straight through the meat of her shoulder. As the blade pierces the muscle, Naomi lets out a yell through clenched teeth that quickly fades into weak laughter.
“Getting out of here? What do you mean? We can’t leave.”
“You don’t like your father very much.”
“Cas’. H-hey — “
But how could he when he feels so warm inside?
Castiel watches him steadily. “And you don’t think that maybe - just maybe - Dean wanted you to find the Angel Tablet? That maybe part of him knows what he’s doing is wrong, and that he wants this to end as much as you do?”
I wasn’t told anything else.”
After almost a half-hour of listening to the album, Castiel stands up abruptly, startling Dean who had been scowling at his English homework.
Well into the day, he stays in his room, reading through magazines, tinkering with the broken TV remote, and even looking at his homework — once. It’s maybe two or three hours when Castiel wakes up again. Dean looks up from his magazine, watching Castiel's bright, blue eyes go from sleepy, to confused, to alarmed. Dean stumbles back as Castiel flies out of his bed, standing upright and looking around the room with a wild expression.
Dean runs into the kitchen, stopping short when he sees his father and Sam standing from across the room. Sam’s face is flushed and Dean can tell his younger brother is on the brink of tears.
“I want to take him away from this place. This summer,” Castiel says suddenly. Dean looks at him, a bit surprised.
Dean shakes his head dismissively before Castiel can say anything else. “Look, my dad does, too. You don’t drink it because it tastes good. You drink it to get buzzed.”
Dean leans back against the stool, intimately aware of how close they’re sitting together. He doesn’t want to pull away - but he can all but
— and finds Dean, in the kitchen, cursing at a metal pan sizzling on the stove with a snarl. Plumes of smoke rise from the pan. When he hears Castiel run into the kitchen, Dean nearly jumps in place, clearly startled. Castiel blinks at him in stunned silence.
Castiel curses as Dean climbs out of the car, quickly following him as the rush of the cold, night air greets his warm skin. Outside the car is a smaller man - the bartender from inside. Castiel blinks in surprise. “Alfie?” he asks hoarsely. Castiel feels his face heat up in shame. Despite Dean’s efforts to fix himself, the car windows are still fogged and they’d both scrambled out of the backseat - not exactly inconspicuous.
He does. He misses a few keys here and there, but he can hear the music, even with the keys out of tune. Castiel carefully repositions Dean’s fingers, gently encouraging him to try again. And when Dean does, he gets it perfect.
“...pocket dimension,” Dean repeats. Castiel nods warily, still half-asleep as he blinks against the harsh light in the kitchen. He refuses to try and wrap his head around that concept. “And now that she’s gone, they, uh...they think it might’ve been me who hid her away.”
“Hm?”
Balthazar and Castiel sit in the barn in silence. With anxious anticipation, Balthazar snaps at Castiel for loudly drumming his fingers on the table, before quickly silencing himself when the two hear something stirring from outside.
ridding hell of the master of torture
She smiles. “Good. Now...I’m going to try and make this as painless for you as possible. Use my grace and find Dean. You’ll have to move quickly. When you get up there, you’re going to be sent to your version of heaven. You’re going to be tempted to stay, Castiel.
“Good on you for making a friend. It’s a shame he seems like one of those queer types.”
"I didn't start a fight. I was tired. I couldn't even see straight. Dad would have made us unpack everything and you know it."
Feeling frustrated and more confused than ever before, Castiel hesitantly slides out of bed and makes quick work of discharging himself from the hospital against the advice of the secretary and two nurses. Not like he could tell them an angel healed him - he’d be checked right into the mental wing. He hardly remembers physically climbing into the front of his old junker or driving to Balthazar’s empty house. He was there, and then he was standing in the living room, his Bible clutched tightly in his hands. Balthazar is nowhere to be found.
Castiel smiles. “Dean, that’s a wonderful idea.”
him he was going to work a job tonight. But Dean never imagined it was this late. Or this...secretive.
“What are you talking about?”
“I should show you what nothing looks like,” she says, her stare meeting his eyes with a calm sort of fury that only angels seem capable of bestowing. “What the
“No, I will not look back, Dean. I’m not afraid of you. So why don’t you --”
The words are a lightning bolt to every nerve in Dean’s shaking body. Castiel reaches a shaking hand up to cradle Dean’s face, tears dripping down the sides of his face. Dean feels his heart angrily hammer against his chest, demanding the words that Dean can’t bring himself to return as Castiel leans close, bringing his face mere inches from Dean’s. Their lips don’t touch, but the whisper of Castiel’s breath against Dean’s mouth is enough to feel like the kiss that would never come. Dean closes his eyes.
Balthazar had been close to Castiel for some time. About ten or so years older than Castiel himself, he had been a youth pastor leader at the church Castiel used to go to before he quit and disappeared from the church for good. No warning, no notice - he simply stopped showing up. When Castiel came to his apartment one day after school (before he was pulled into his father’s version of ‘homeschooling’), Balthazar had told him he was “done preaching the word of an invisible fucker that lives in the sky.”
That draws a nervous laugh out of Castiel.
Jo shakes her head, taking Castiel’s wrist and gripping it tightly in her own. Her eyes are wide, angry, and pleading - begging him to understand something he already understands far too well.
Thick and heavy in his hand, Dean is already fully hard by the time he grabs Castiel’s hair, sighing against his skin as his mouth explores every expanse of skin he can reach. Spurred on by the touch to the handprint, Castiel grabs Dean’s body and pulls him closer, unashamed as he sighs and gasps at every touch of Dean’s lips to Castiel’s sensitive skin. He kisses down his body as Castiel gasps and throws his head back, his tongue finding a nipple to gently lick and suck before he kisses down to his stomach. Dean is breathless the entire time - he keeps pausing to
“He did?”
“Well...you wanna know why you were saved?” Dean asks slowly. He’s circling Castiel again. Watching him. Observing him. Castiel feels goosebumps erupt up his arms and a harsh shiver passes up his spine. A sense of foreboding casts a cold shadow over Castiel’s shoulders as he watches Dean with wide, wondering eyes. “You were saved because God commanded it. And you and I? We have work to do, Castiel.”
“He said that if we go, he doesn’t want us to come back.”
But even through the heavy days, he knows that each morning, they will both wake up with a reason to smile.
The familiar scratch of the record in the room begins playing a song Dean doesn’t recognize. Some strange pop song with a difficult rhythm. It speeds up, slows down, and the vocals are all over the place. He winces; there was no way Cas’ would be able to play that back the way he could play the music he hears in Dean’s room. But sure enough, when it’s done, Castiel begins to play. It takes him a minute to adjust to the rhythm, but without fault, he plays it back, leaving Dean stunned.
“Careful!” Castiel barks, aiming his gun at the woman as he jogs over to the two. “She’s a witch. You need to be —“
“Do you mind if I add something…?” he asks hesitantly. “It’s alright if not.”
Just as he’s about to decide on making himself seen by the front gate, a hand grabs him by the back of the shirt and throws him up against the hood of his car. Castiel fires his gun, but it’s quickly knocked out of his hand. Castiel groans as he feels his wrist twist at an unnatural angle, sending a sharp spike of pain up his arm as his assailant presses the cold barrel of a gun against his temple.
But Benny Lafitte is
Dean winces. Why did his first meeting with their neighbors have to be some weirdo kid who hides in trees in the pouring rain? His dismay for the small town only grew at the fact that this was what he had to look forward to in a neighbor.
Dean chuckles. The laugh reverberates across the barn walls until it reaches a thunderous crescendo. Castiel flinches as lightning flashes through the barn, causing him to stare back at Dean with wide, wild eyes.
Movement to their left makes them both turn. Dean stands in the aisle between the pews with Jo beside him, a protective hand laid across her shoulder. He narrows his eyes at Naomi, a hint of a smirk stretching across his face.
“I’m an angel too, Cas,” he growls. “Don’t you worry your noggin over it. Call me Robert.”
“Castiel, where are your manners? Don’t tell me you don’t remember me.”
"You okay?" Dean asks. Castiel stammers for an answer. He takes in the sight of his new neighbor up close; wide green eyes. A curious quirk of an eyebrow. Panicked, Castiel remains utterly silent before quickly wrenching his arm from Dean's grasp. He turns and bolts for his house, his feet flying out behind him as they thud against the soaked ground.
“Jo. I already told you. I can’t. I’m finished with this. With everything.”
Silence again, save for the chirping of the crickets in the grass.
“How could anything kill one of us?” he whispers, his voice cracking. “That shouldn’t be possible.”
“I think that you...that you have good intentions. And I think somewhere along the way, those intentions broke. I think that somewhere along the line, you had rules. And those rules were bad. And now you don’t want to live by them anymore, and you don’t have the strength to fully break free.”
“And you're hard.”
” Dean can feel his eyes burn with tears. He’s grateful that it’s dark - that Sam can’t see him fighting not to cry.
for him…? Castiel thinks of the night before with a rush of guilt. Surely Dean doesn’t understand what he’s saying. Angels don’t
from how much I’ve screamed his name. He won’t listen to me. He isn’t
Robert laughs. He’s amused, which only enrages Castiel.
In the light of the early evening, Castiel has to blink twice to be sure he knows what he’s seeing - surely, it wouldn’t be the strangest thing to happen to him all day. But as he blinks open his eyes, he stares straight into the face of a man all-too-familiar - one Castiel has, for as long as he can remember, looked upon with so much guilt and anger and shame that he’d spent the past twenty years trying to bury it at every cost to himself.
Usually, Balthazar was drunk. But that hadn’t stopped Castiel from coming back to his apartment to play chess or drink with him or watch strange cartoons on his box TV when he had still been allowed to leave the property.
He sees himself. Weak, afraid, and too much of a coward to do anything until it’s too late.
Castiel kneels beside him, placing a soft hand on the boy’s shoulder.
“I shot him because he was displaying symptoms of the Croatoan virus. He may have already infected members of the camp! We were out on a supply run and came across a large group of them near the outskirts of the city. I did what I had to do!”
. I won’t stop believing in that, now. You can kill me...you can...do whatever you want with me. But I won’t say yes. I won’t watch you burn the world. And I won’t let you turn into something that you aren’t.”
“Maybe some water, too?” the bartender asks with a raise of his eyebrow. Castiel nods.
Benny huffs a laugh. “I’m not the one with a bleeding face, Dean,” he points out. “I’ll be fine. You saved my skin back there. You too, Castiel. I owe you one, brother.”
“The last one?” Castiel repeats. “Lucifer...I didn’t know you would be here. I-I’ve been looking for you. I came back, I-I went to hell but I’m back, and it was angels who — “
“What is that?”
He holds out his hand to shake. Castiel stares at it for a long moment, before reaching out his own hand on the same side in a very awkward, backward handshake.
Castiel finds himself grinning. “I...I think so,” he whispers.
“I know what it is. As I’ve said, I’ve had it before.”
“It...it does matter, Dean,” Castiel says. “Being human...understanding a world beyond where you’ve been raised? That matters. Even if it doesn’t matter to heaven.”
Pulling off to the side of the road, Dean slams the driver’s side shut as he steps out onto the street and lifts the hood of the trunk where Castiel’s urn rests amidst a mass of protective padding to keep the urn, hand-crafted years ago, from breaking. He takes it, leaving the car where it’s parked as he trudges through the weeds near the edge of the street and steps across the small, bubble of water that makes up the tiny stream. The weeds thin out, and Dean’s feet find an even stretch of grass, lush and green.
“But — “
These people have enough to worry about as it is. They don’t need to see a duplicate of me walking around, too.”
“Hey, I said sorry. Some people...are able to handle it. I had my doubts, even with your religious...stuff going on there. But, unfortunately, my suspicions were true; I knew you were without faith. And, well, it showed. Didn’t mean to blow your eardrums out, though. Sorry, again.”
Dean sighs. “Yeah, sure — but you’re not getting off the topic of not having kissed anyone. I still find that hard to believe.”
. Maybe this is what love is. The strange, blossoming swell of his heart - the way he could look at Dean
Dean bites his lower lip, casting his gaze to the floor. “I can try,” he says quietly.
“Well, you’re the one who said you didn’t make a deal that woulda sent you down to that pit,” Balthazar continues. “So...maybe an angel thinks you didn’t deserve the hellfire after all. And look -”
Once again, Sam is quiet. Dean pulls his face into a scowl when he doesn’t respond.
Smiling, Castiel jogs around the perimeter of the pond as Lucifer’s quick hands dart beneath the rock to pull a slimy, black salamander out and hold it in his hand.
“I said
“I’m sorry, Castiel,” Dean says quietly. “I’m sorry I couldn’t...convince you to put more faith in me. The one who’s failed here ain’t you - it’s me. I...I think I gotta reevaluate. I’m...I’m slipping. I am. And it’s gonna get ugly if I don’t fix this. Fix

“You’re not gonna like hearing this,” Dean warns. Castiel grits his teeth.
going to fight!” Castiel snaps, already exhausted. “And you — “ He points at Dean. “ —
“Yeah, I remember,” Balthazar croaks, his voice dry and raspy. He pours himself another glass of whiskey. “Blimey, Cas...you...I didn’t know it was that bad.”
He watches them both carefully. Surely he’s misunderstanding them.
This isn’t...something that was meant to be part of the plan.”
Gabriel mumbles a tired "g'night", waving a tiny hand towards Dean as he slumps over against his brother's shoulder once more. Watching them go, Dean hears Gabriel mumble something to Castiel about singing him a song. With a jolt, Dean wonders if Castiel can actually sing - he wouldn’t be surprised if he could. Curiosity gets the better of him, and he shifts closer to the open door, straining his ears for any sound from the room beside Castiel’s. Sure enough, he
Not that it will stop Castiel - he had decided long ago that saving people was important. It was a duty. It was something to make up for the endless string of failures he'd muddled through since he'd been a child.
“Well, that’s the valve stem...this here is the rim lip. Those are the lug holes.”
Dean nods. “In the flesh. Well, I wasn’t in the flesh then. I am now. This suit isn’t really me. It’s my vessel."
And God, he’s so sick of being afraid.
“Was it that obvious…?” Dean asks faintly. Benny laughs gently.
Inside, the walls are a musty yellow. Dark, brown pews, undoubtedly old and worn down from years of use, line the inside. He peers around, gazing at the massive stained glass lining the walls as the sunlight trickles through, providing dim lighting within. The patterns are remarkably recognizable; with a jolt, Castiel realizes he’s seen them before in Joanne’s journal from back at the hospital.
“Well, I don’t plan on dropping dead any time soon,” Dean says seriously.
“What other songs can you play?” he demands, a little suddenly. Castiel seems startled by Dean’s sudden, rapt interest. Dean hardly notices.
But first, Castiel needs water.
“Look,” Balthazar continues, “I know you two were distant and all before all of this ungodly crap went down. But I’m sure he’ll be happy as who-knows-what to hear you’re back from the dead.”
“Yep.”
He turns to his brother with a frown.
Sam shrugs, giving it a long look. “I guess. You should still check, though. It looks kinda fancy.”
Dean thinks to himself.
Breaking into the old gas station across the field is easy. And much to his relief, the fridge is stocked with water. He drinks enough to satiate him without the threat of throwing it back up again and digs into the first granola bars he can find. When he’s fed and watered enough to think more clearly, Castiel touches his right shoulder. It tingles and, for a moment, it burns when his fingers brush against the skin. Raised skin, like an ugly scar. Castiel is sure to have many more of those.
The two smile. Benny offers his hand and Dean takes it in a firm handshake. A connection. A silent promise. He nearly stumbles when Benny pulls him in for a tight hug. For a long, long moment, the two of them stay like that, clinging to one another in a silent promise. A silent
seriously, overall. I wanted to lighten the mood with this a little bit before delving into some much heavier chapters that I have ready to go for the next few weeks. Thank you to everyone who's been reading and following along!
“Not exactly. He, um...he actually wasn’t cool with us going on the trip. At all.”
what was left of his body.”
“Ain’t your fault.”
He recognizes his surroundings immediately; he’s back home, on the farm. Beside him, the gentle breeze stirs ripples across the water of the pond, hissing gently through the reeds. A handful of crickets hop across the grass. Laughter from the other side of the pond makes him turn, tilting his head as he squints to identify the source of the sound. But it’s laughter that he would recognize anywhere, even now in the voice of a child. By the dock, Lucifer sits by the pond, grinning from ear to ear as he lifts a rock and gasps in surprise.
“And I’m sorry for it.” Dean stands up, walking over to the side of his bed again. Castiel kneels upright to face him. “It is not how I want any of this to be. I will do what’s in my power to leave you out of this, but I don’t think either of us has a choice.”
Dean snaps his head up. He looks at his father in disbelief. Of all times, he hadn’t expected
“That’s your problem, Castiel," he continues idly. "You’ve always been a religious man, haven’t you? But you’ve never had any faith. ”
this man. Standing only a few inches taller than Castiel himself, the man with the beret and wide shoulders is none other than Benny LaFitte.
Castiel turns to smile at him. It’s a sad, worried smile. “You would not come with me?”
His brother doesn’t answer his phone when Castiel tries to call from the dusty payphone box on the edge of the dirt road. It goes straight to voicemail. When he tries to call Balthazar, Balthazar hangs up with a deadly, albeit colorful, threat on his lips, unbelieving that Castiel could possibly be real. Castiel is a dead man, of course. And there are many creatures eager to take a dead man’s face. He and Lucifer had been notable hunters in their time, and Castiel is sure they’d pissed off enough of the things they hadn’t killed to make them want to use Castiel for their own benefit.  He would have to find Balthazar - or his brother - in person and hope that they wouldn’t kill him before he had time to explain that he is real.
“You kept this?” Castiel asks. His mouth works around another, small smile.
“I am going to play the piano.”
Castiel doesn’t answer. He knows the other is right, no matter how much it threatens to rip him apart where he stands.
“I don’t know what to think anymore.”
“You’ll probably be fine. But this book has warding sigils to keep angels away. I don’t think they’re gonna bother you, but just in case they come looking, these will make it harder for them to detect you. Draw them on your doors and windows after I leave. I’m sorry you can’t come with us, but you’d only be a liability out there.”
Dean frowns. The wings fade from view, cloaking the barn in its gray, inky darkness once again.
for all that had happened between them. When Benny pulls away, he seems content. Happy that the two are leaving off on a good note when things have felt anything
“Dean,” he gasps. “I don’t want to rush you, but —”
Castiel stands at attention, stiff as a board, eyes wider than fear itself as the man stalks across the lawn. Even little Gabriel stands stiffly at his brother’s side, a small fist clutching his brother’s coat. His small eyes fill with fear.
But he doesn’t. It won’t matter, now. Maybe his mother is here in heaven, somewhere, but this isn’t her - it’s only her memory. He forces himself to look away from the pond, away from them both, and away from the perfect memory with an ache in his chest that he can’t seem to shove down. He lets the tiny bit of Jo’s grace tug him towards the dirt path leading off the property, guiding him in the right direction as he trudges along the path with Lucifer’s laughter in the distance and his childhood home watching over him like an angel on his shoulder.
Castiel gives Dean a sad smile. “You care about me. Don’t you?”
“What’s so funny?!” Castiel demands.
“Loosen up, Cassie,” Balthazar snorts. “Could be fun. Anyway - can I go back to bed now? Or do I have to worry about heavenly wrath reigning hellfire down on my house?”
“Who cares?”
Dean bolts forward, stepping between them and looking at them both with a strained expression.
Dean shakes his head. “Nah. Don’t be. I was getting sick of this place, anyway. They can find someone else to lead them.” He looks at Castiel. Much to Castiel’s surprise, Dean smiles and claps his hands together. “Always wanted to be a runaway. Like that uh, Bon Jovi song, y’know? ‘
They meet eyes. Dean tilts his head, studying Castiel before his eyes flicker to the sight of the older Castiel’s body on the floor.
“The existence of angels implies the existence of God and Heaven,” Castiel murmurs. “Implies that my...my father’s faith is, perhaps, not without the extremism I assumed he came to adopt later in life.”
Dean grins. "Yeah, that sounds like something I would do. Now, why don't you give me that poor human you've been harassing and I won't set your black, ugly soul on fire?"
here anymore. We could go...and we could get out.”
“Right! Because you usually sleep at this time.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean lets out a short laugh.
But, as Dean follows Michael through the house, the sound of an out-of-tune piano floats through the house from upstairs, instantly capturing Dean’s attention. Dean listens intently, recognizing the song; an Elvis song from one of his records. The smooth, steady melody drifts through the living room, played with the pace and rhythm of a seasoned musician. Despite the instrument being so old and out of tune, the notes are played with careful precision, delicately flowing from one chord into the next. It's as though the instrument's lack of tune is part of the song itself; the lack of sharp tonality giving the song a haunted, unearthly sort of beauty that stuns Dean where he stands. The song is undeniably an Elvis song, and yet entirely unique in the way the piano’s melody ebbs and flows. Dean can hear the words sung as though the King himself were upstairs, singing right along. He doesn't even realize that he's smiling as he begins humming under his breath.
Castiel turns away. His face is red, burning with a shame that he doesn’t want to acknowledge. He knows why he went down there. And to be saved, by an angel no less, is impossible to rationalize. He watches as Dean tilts his head, slightly, taking a step closer to Castiel. It’s not threatening; it’s curious. Dean studies him like he would an intricate puzzle, tracing the lines of his face to find the missing pieces.
“How am I supposed to find Dean once I’m in heaven?” Castiel asks.
“Because I’ve tasted it before and it tastes disgusting. My...my father drinks these quite often.”
And then, everything fades. He tumbles into a dark, warm emptiness that cradles his body, ushering him to embrace the comfortable silence until everything grows bright again.
Dean grits his teeth. “Dad — “
. I’ve heard you play before. You’ll nail it.”
“Who have you kissed?”
“Cas,” Dean says, firmly but gently. “Hell, you know I’m down whenever you are, but I am
“It’s okay.”
“I-I have to go,” he says quickly. “I’m sorry, I have to — I have a meeting.”
“Then I don’t know what to tell you!” Dean snaps. “I can’t make dad stop yelling, okay? But maybe if you just shut up and did what he asked you to do, things would be easier around here.”
In disbelief, Castiel remains silent for a long moment. He watches Dean, his head bowed. Poised to strike should this man -- this angel -- make a single wrong move. Not that he had anything to kill him with anyway; the demon blade hadn’t worked. Neither had their guns.
Climbing off the bed, Castiel stands to meet him. “Why? Are you planning on killing the witch? I wasn’t able to locate her just yet.”
Sometimes, Benny will say hello to him. But Dean is distant and quiet and turns down his offers to hang out after school, saying he’s too busy with work. It isn’t a total lie.
“Yes, well, you asked!” Castiel huffs. Dean can see a blush spreading across Castiel’s face. With a smirk, Dean gets up and grabs a beer from the fridge, popping it open and taking a long sip from it. It tastes like garbage, but it’s still
Before Castiel can even open his mouth to call out to them, they charge. Castiel draws his gun, firing two rounds into the woman’s chest. It’s not enough - she keeps coming. It takes four shots to make her drop to the ground, her limbs writhing before growing still.
Dean nods. “We will. I plan on it.”
- he’s Michael. The most powerful archangel in heaven. He’s doing what he’s always been meant to do; kill his brother at all costs.”
“Dean, seriously! Listen!”
Dean slides a finger past his rim without warning. “You good?”
Dean nods. “Yeah, I’m done with it. I thought I’d change my mind...but...y’know. I don’t think I will. Being human is...really weird. But so far, my biggest complaint is having to pee every five hours.”
when he tries to keep still enough to feel tired. Maybe it’s because, for the ninth night in a row, he doesn’t hear Castiel’s piano playing through his window. He checks his clock - twenty minutes ‘till midnight. With a groan, Dean sits up in bed, rubbing the back of his head as he gazes out the window. The chilly night is mostly clear, the full moon providing a blanket of dim light over the town as it peers through a thin film of clouds. It’s a thin sheen of illumination; a cozy glow, enough to see what’s in front of you, but not enough to see behind the looming shadows of the houses and trees.
Dean glares at him. His accusation strikes a chord in Dean - Castiel can tell. “Yeah, I am. What about it?”
If Dean Winchester knows one thing, it’s that Castiel’s strange behaviors and even stranger secrets would surely drive him insane one day.
But Dean is endlessly patient with him. He doesn’t hide his desire for Castiel - but he doesn’t hide how much he wants Castiel to want this as much as Dean does, either. He doesn’t push no matter how badly he wants it. Despite this, it’s Dean who pushes Castiel off his lap when Castiel tries to rip his clothes off, drunk out of his mind, exactly three months after Lucifer and Balthazar died.
Castiel shakes his head. “I can’t. I can’t do that.”
Castiel shakes his head, watching him fondly. “It’s okay. I think it’s about time I climb out of my shell now and again. I...I enjoyed watching you.” He’s definitely tipsy by now. His courage astounds him as Dean raises his eyebrows. Though it’s dark, the lights from the club illuminate their spot by the car as Dean leans back against the hood.
Dean smiles faintly. Benny’s tanned face seems soft in the sunlight.
“Your guess is as good as mine. I have no idea what could have dragged me down like that,” he lies softly. Easily. He wonders what other lies would spill past his careful lips. Castiel was always a terrible liar - perhaps it was his greatest deficit as a hunter. But lying feels as easy as picking up a blade and plunging it into a monster’s heart.
everybody?”
“Place your fingers at A sharp...C….and E sharp. Like that. Good.” And then, Castiel is moving Dean’s hands over the keys. The tempo is slow, to start, and a little clunky. Dean keeps his eyes fixated on Castiel’s hands, effortlessly moving Dean’s own over the correct chords until the music becomes recognizable. Dean smiles nervously, watching his hands move. Castiel isn’t having him play the melody, but the chords themselves are familiar, and soon, Castiel is slipping his own hands away. Dean can feel the absence like a shot of ice through his veins and it startles him enough to have to readjust his hands.
Without a word, he stands up stiffly and marches out the door. It slams behind him, leaving Jodi shaking her head.
Then, the quiet.
Dean goes to answer, but he can only laugh again. Tears spring at the edges of his eyes as he gasps for breath, and Castiel, as embarrassed as he is, clearly seems to be enjoying laughing at himself, too. Dean doesn’t even hear the front door open and shut or the familiar sound of his father’s footsteps thudding into the kitchen until they’re feet from him. He stops laughing at once, clearing his throat as he nervously peers around the couch. The light, laughter in his chest fades, leaving him taught and on-edge as quickly as the tension had left.
Dean winces. “Would it help if I said ‘please’...?”
it’s a Seal. The first Seal. The one that must be broken first in order to break the others and raise the Devil from his cage.”
“Yes, I’m trying to find Dean. He’s --”
“And some classical music. I tend to try and play whatever I hear. Once I hear it...it's in my head." Castiel taps his forehead for emphasis.
“Well,” Dean continues hesitantly, “I’d be down for coming to see you play sometime.”
“Yes, sir. I understand that.”
From his pocket, Dean pulls out the little vial containing his grace.
Sam shrugs, looking away from Dean. "I dunno. I kinda like it here. I wanna stay."
Balthazar shrugs unhelpfully. “Hey, you don’t exactly put yourself out there. Figured a pretty angel boy would be just your style. He even saved you from hell - your own knight in shining armor. Look, I’m straight as a board and I’d be throwing myself on any man who did
“There’s no way!” Lucifer proclaims. “You won’t, I’ve got the biggest one…”
“Awesome.”
to come here. Full disclosure.”
“Why would he want to leave?” Sam asks, genuinely puzzled.
It’s a bar, Dean knows, and a gross one at that. Even from his careful distance, he can hear loud talking inside, and can practically smell the cheap beer from here. It’s a dive that not even most high schoolers bothered trying to sneak into with fake IDs. Shady and known for keeping unpleasant company, the idea of Castiel walking into a place like Purgatory is almost enough to make Dean laugh out loud. But, much to Dean’s bewildered amazement, Castiel crosses the street and walks around to the side of the building. Unable to believe that he’s actually going to
“Dean, I don’t think Castiel wants to be found. And even if you did find him, what’s the point of bringing him back home? He hated it here, didn’t he?”
.” Dean’s eyes glow a brilliant white, that same glow Castiel had seen back at Balthazar’s house. Robert glares at him and releases his hand. Castiel gasps, his lungs rapidly expanding with air as his chest heaves. The relief makes him dizzy. When he finds his bearings again, he staggers to his feet with bared teeth.
Castiel shakes his head. Balthazar bites his lower lip, knowing full-well where this conversation is going. “It doesn’t matter now,” Castiel says quickly. “If God is real…”
“Leave him alone or I will cut your face,” Castiel growls. The boys draw back. Dick lets go of Dean’s shirt, shoving him away. He nearly topples over, but Benny catches his arm before he can fall. He pulls Dean away from the group and back against the lockers.
Kneeling beside him, Dean digs a small hole in the dirt between the two rocks and places the vial in the ground. He covers it quickly after, watching the dirt pile around it until they can no longer see it. Castiel watches Dean work with awe - burying away everything that once made him an angel. It’s like he’s changing before his very eyes, molding and shifting into something permanent. Something whole. When he’s done, Dean looks at him with a shy smile. They’re kneeling close to one another, their breath mingling in the chilly air. Dean’s nose is red, and it’s terribly endearing.
Castiel remembers the stripper inside the club, how weak with desire he’d made Dean slumped in that chair. He wants to do that now - wants to do better. Angrily, he grabs Dean’s shoulders when he pulls away to slam the door shut, and drags him back against him, pulling their lips together and plunging his tongue past Dean’s lips. Dean moans softly at the intrusion, and the noise makes Castiel shiver. He doesn’t want to take his time, doesn’t want to drag this out. This isn’t love. He refuses to love a being who keeps so many secrets but will shower him with vulnerability Castiel feels like he doesn’t deserve.
“I’ve conducted every test that I could think of on you while you were asleep,” his other self says with a sigh. He places his gun down on the table with a tilt of his head. “Holy water. Silver. Salt. And yet, you’re remarkably clean. What am I supposed to do with that?”
Castiel lets out a weak cry as Dean begins to chant, keeping his hand poised above the bowl on the table. Castiel can feel his vision blur and flicker, his eyes rolling back as Benny tightens his grip around his throat. He can’t breathe, can’t
Castiel pays for his drink in cash, tipping the waiter more than he intended to, but hardly caring enough to count out the bills. He swallows the shot quickly, grateful when it burns down his throat. He quickly finishes his water after, grateful when it seems to calm the slight tremble in his hand. He orders another and the bartender gives him a wary nod before sliding him another glass.
“No,” Dean snaps. “If you knew how to listen with whatever my Father crammed into your ears — “
Dean realizes that in the few months he’s known Castiel, he’s never been to the Novak household before, save for the one day Michael Novak let him inside when Dean was returning Castiel’s lost necklace. Castiel feels like someone he’s known for far longer than just a few months - surely, he has, hasn’t he? No - Sam and Dean moved in back in August with their father. It had only been four months. Dean feels dizzy thinking about it. Surely, he’s known Castiel for a lifetime.
Dean says nothing for a long moment. He looks at his drink again before turning his eyes back to Castiel.
“But you lied,” Dean says slowly. Testing the waters. “You do remember hell."
Beside the tools, a syringe lays next to the holy water. He takes it into his hands and draws water in through the thick vial up to the brim. Her words settle deep in the nooks of Castiel’s skin, but he pays no attention. She knows everything about him. He has nothing to hide from her simply because he
“ What are you?” Castiel asks sharply. “What is your...species?”
“As in
Castiel frowns, his mouth worrying into a puzzling line.
he thinks to himself. The words echo, a gentle repeat thudding around in his mind. Castiel’s voice is an echo, casting a sharp tendril of longing through his chest.
“You…”
Dean rubs the back of his head. “Hey, yeah, sure,” Dean says. “I’m almost done - you guys mind waiting around a minute?”
Over cereal (after the small kitchen fire had been extinguished, the scorched eggs abandoned in the garbage), Castiel can see that Dean is less tense than the night before.
“Dean?” Castiel asks softly when Dean doesn’t move. Maybe he’s nervous about this, too. Dean had taken to being human well,
The spot he finds is startling easy once he reaches the edge of town. Maybe he was always meant to find it here. Maybe he was meant to find this place because maybe Castiel was always meant to die. Maybe Dean
And so, Castiel begins to play. And like everything Castiel plays, even on the old piano in desperate need of a tune, the air itself turns into a brilliant melody of liquid gold. Dean sits, terribly still, and listens to him play. The melody is perfect; not a key out of place. Its gentle pace perfectly compliments the rise and fall of the melody with careful chords filling out the sound. Whatever unreadable scribble on the page is guiding Castiel, it’s guiding him well. And when the melody changes pace, quickly jumping to a brisk tempo that almost startles Dean, Castiel is completely lost in the performance. It’s all in his eyes; Dean knows, in that instant, that Castiel has already forgotten Dean isn’t sitting directly beside him, watching him with an intensity Dean hardly understands himself. Dean has never thought about music as art before he met Castiel, but now, he understands it in full.
And, of course, major thanks to all who have left kudos and comments. It means so much.
“My brother brings home women sometimes. Michael. I’ve tried to ask him about this sort of thing but...he always shuts me down.”
“God, you might be right,” he whispers. “But why the Devil? Why
Castiel looks around warily. “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”
“Lucifer — “ Castiel begins again, stunned by what he’s seeing. He’s never seen anybody take out a witch with such ease, much less lift a woman with one hand like she weighed nothing. “What are you…?”
Castiel gives him a lingering look. He opens his mouth as though to say something else, but he doesn’t finish his sentence. He turns, and both he and Dean see the harrowing sight at the same time; Gabriel, wandering into the street to chase dandelion seeds dancing in the wind just as a car rounds the corner, driving too fast for the quiet street.
Castiel freezes. A beat of silence - then;
Castiel’s mouth opens and closes wordlessly in disbelief. Benny stands just as Castiel remembers him; black overcoat. White dress shirt underneath. Thick, broad-shoulders and a heavy, Cajun accent. But before he can make a single sound, Benny swings his fist back and punches Castiel in the mouth. With a grunt, Castiel clamors back against the sink, his head rocking back as blood spurts from his lower lip. He watches Benny with wild eyes as Castiel fumbles for the knife in his belt.
“Welp, you
“Dean!” Castiel barks, trying to catch his breath. “What the hell? Can you...
he may act. Castiel is a breath of fresh air, a home in a place Dean could never find by himself. Sudden anger boils in Dean’s gut, the urge to lash out at his father a bittersweet temptation on the back of his tongue. But Dean can only nod along, averting his eyes from his father’s harsh gaze. He knows better than to disagree with John Winchester. He’s not like Sam; the brunt of his father’s rage stings in ways that Sam seems to bear with pride well beyond his years. Dean would never understand how, or why. Perhaps Dean is just a coward.
Castiel doesn’t even have to ask him — as Dean weakly pumps his hips through his orgasm, he takes Castiel’s aching cock in his hand and strokes him, making Castiel’s back arch off the bed. It takes him less than a minute to spill across Dean’s fingers, and finally, he comes down from the high. His whole body is weak and boneless, and as Dean collapses onto his chest, he knows he’s never going to want to move from this bed as long as Dean is here.
“Here. Drink this.”
“Dude, you sounded like an expert freaking piano player. There’s no way you played that well just by listening to the song a few times.”
me, Castiel,” Benny says, almost conversationally. Castiel shakes his head, raising his hands with a pained noise. Guilt floods his system as he
"I would like to come to your house to see your music collection sometime. Is that...okay?”
” His arm throbs in pain, a clear reminder that there is
“I don’t know. She isn’t here, now. She just...sent me here. She told me I needed to gain
Dean raises an eyebrow. The small motion cuts Castiel off mid-sentence.
Castiel looks away. The Bible’s depictions of angels are vastly unlike what he experienced back in the barn. Now, the black book sitting on the table mocks Castiel, taunting him to
“I don’t know. But I don’t like the look of this. Looks like she salted her windows...but whatever this was got her good. She was a good hunter, too. Been doing this for years, not the type to die from a normal ghost haunting. We need to get back to the house so I can get a better look at this.”
"I said leave me alone."
“I won’t be joining. There’s a vigil being held for Olivia Lowry today and the other hunters who were killed by the Witnesses.”
“Cas’ isn’t feeling well,” Dean murmurs when Sam insists that they wait for their friend. Even Sam has grown to like Castiel, though nothing could penetrate the bond the two older boys share. Their argument from the night before goes unspoken, but yet again, guilt bubbles up in Dean’s stomach, just like before. He knows that he should be doing something. He
“I don’t wanna go in there,” Gabriel whispers. “I don’t wanna go to Daddy.”
Castiel could do to this angel that Dean couldn’t deliver back tenfold.
Benny shifts his weight where he stands. “Are you hoping to find him out there?”
“Very.”
“Sorry about him,” Castiel grumbles once they’ve finally put distance between themselves and the house. His cheeks are flushed as they hurry down the sidewalk, no real direction; just an urgent need to get away.
“To save the world, yes.”
“She was a good girl,” the woman says finally. “‘Jo’. I liked her. I was her doctor while she was here. She usually kept to herself and her drawings, but she suffered from schizophrenia and psychosis. Has ever since she was little.”
“You’re supposed to put it in your hair,” he insists. Castiel chuckles and tucks it behind his ear. “Like that?”
“Okay...what do I need to do? Given that the only way you’re going to get me to do anything is by being honest. I don’t want any secrets, Dean.” He looks into the rearview mirror, catching Dean’s eye. He quickly averts his gaze with a slow nod.
Castiel pulls away from the harsh kiss, breathing heavily as Dean braces his hands on Castiel’s shoulders. He leans forward and threads his fingers through Dean’s hair, pulling his head back with an ease that startles him. Dean is
Garth looks down. “I don’t know. I wanted to contact you, but I was afraid it would alert the others.”
“Seriously?! Dad’s gonna let us go on the trip?”
"Play one for us, then."
is weird. It’s not like it matters, anyway. Dean hasn’t been thinking about girls in the past few months as much as he used to.
and now, it is coming to bite him while he’s down. He hurts in every way that an angel can’t fix, hurts in every way he doesn’t deserve relief from. He would burn all over again for this and he would deserve it, just as he deserved it the first time. He’s tortured and enjoyed it. He broke the first Seal. He’d let Lucifer down so much, Lucifer saw fit to throw him into hell just for a chance at power.
“Dean. No,” he hisses. His voice is weak, hardly convincing. “No — “ He shoves a hand down Dean’s boxers, much rougher than he intended to. But Dean doesn’t seem to care - he keeps pressing, keeps pushing against Castiel’s fingers. The angle is awkward, but he’s able to take Dean’s cock in his hand, thick and heavy and straining against the fabric, and quickly begin to stroke him. At the touch, Dean reacts like lightning scorching across his skin. He grabs Castiel’s shoulder, the one marked by the raised, red handprint, and a rush of heat floods Castiel’s limbs.
“I conjure and command you...I conjure and command you…”
He tries to avoid mirrors when he can, but with the woman’s blood and intestinal fluid still settling across Castiel’s skin, he knows that he has to clean himself off to be able to think clearly enough to drive. He feels clouded and on-edge:
“Cas’, I — ”
“Calm your britches there,” Dean murmurs. “A Witness is the ghost of somebody who
“Nope. Doors aren’t really a thing in heaven. And angels don’t have a concept of privacy like humans do. I’ll, uh, knock next time though.”
for the fic! Aaahhh!!!)
The problem is, he has no idea how to leave. Even as he walks, he remains on the edges of the property, the wooded area surrounding the far borders of the farm stretching endlessly in a vast sea of trees. His clothes dry off instantly, no longer soaking wet as he tries to figure out how to leave without turning to look at the house again. He would be tempted to return if he did and Castiel can’t afford that now.
“You, uh, you might want to check who has access to the inventory, then,” he stammers.
I wouldn’t have — “
“Yeah, no thanks.”
Benny should be
“Yeah,” Dean says quickly. “Uh...it was at the base of the tree. I guess it came off when you, uh...fell. The clasp is broken, though. Sorry."
He knows what Dean wants. What he fears. The very notion of Dean threatening
“He’s a good kid,” Dean says instead.
Dean goes into autopilot. He tears his gaze away from the window and carefully climbs out of bed, moving as swiftly and silently as he possibly can. He yanks on a pair of jeans, throws his coat over his gray tank-top, and hurries down the stairs, holding his breath the entire time. In the living room, his father is asleep to the gentle sounds of the TV, an empty beer can sitting on the table beside him. Dean quickly grabs the flashlight from the toolbox sitting on the kitchen table and hurries outside.
“Dead,” he says shortly. “Your brother appeared while you were knocked out. He killed her.”
“'Cause, like, I’ve never heard anyone play Elvis on the piano before.”
Dean tilts his head. "Might be. Might not be. But that doesn't stop you from having
Still speechless, Castiel takes a moment to gather his bearings. “You-you’ve
“Poor, poor boy from a religious fundamentalist, a

Castiel snorts. “And you won’t even tell me why.”
Castiel’s breath heaves in and out of his chest as he stares at Dean, wishing desperately that he could punch him again. Dean is angry, too — angry and
.’ And you will let me in,” Dean snarls. Castiel shakes his head slowly, groaning in pain when Dean’s fingers tighten in his hair. His presence is commanding; powerful and terrifying and vast. Castiel looks up at him, beholding the terror and fury of an archangel denied what he has been promised by fate itself.
“No that’s...that’s good,” Dean breathes. He turns to Castiel, his eyes unreadable.
Castiel can’t bring himself to shoot the boy, a mistake Castiel realizes he’s made a second too late. The boy’s nails dig into Castiel’s chest as he’s slammed back against the car, the boy snapping his teeth towards Castiel’s throat as he screams and growls like a wild animal. Castiel thrashes away, kicking the boy twice in the shins hard enough to splinter the bone, but the boy seems entirely unphased. Pinned between the boy’s weight and the car door, Castiel manages to raise his gun and fire three rounds into his head, dropping him instantly. A violent wave of nausea makes him gag at the sight of the dead child. He clutches his stomach, forcing himself to calm as he turns away from the body and fumbles to open his car door. Gripping the steering wheel tightly, Castiel forces himself to breathe, to calm down long enough to assess the situation.
Dean shrugs as he quickly pulls on a pair of faded jeans and a black t-shirt. He nabs his jacket, pushing his fingers through his hair with a quick glance in the mirror."
“We haven’t either,” Robert says shortly. “And there isn’t the time to go looking. She’s carefully guarded and very, very powerful. This whole town needs to go to prevent her from breaking the Seal. And you need to come with us. We can’t kill you while you’re still useful to us, and trust me, if I had it my way, that wouldn’t be the case.
He’s always found Dean to be most beautiful just like this — dressed down with dirt smeared across his face. It’s rivaled only to seeing Dean entirely naked — something Castiel has seen plenty of times when Dean comes out of the shower.
“What do you mean?”
They stare at one another, unblinking. The mindless chatter in the hallways is a dull, muffled roar in Dean’s ears as the earth stands still around them. Hesitantly, Dean lifts his hand to brush his fingers across the bruise on Castiel’s face, forgetting about anyone who could see. It’s the first time he’s ever acknowledged the marks on Castiel’s face.
Castiel hesitantly agrees.
Dean disappears, leaving Castiel alone in the warm, morning light. Around him, crickets chirp in the grassy weeds. A bee buzzes by his nose before settling on a patch of daisies a few feet away from the water. Feeling more confused than ever before, Castiel closes his eyes and slips into an inky blackness as the familiar dream fades out of view.
But now, Castiel Novak feels a different kind of pain; a muffled, diluted pain that his brain registers as different. Unintentional. No flaying of the nerves, no peeling of the skin or ripping or carving or screaming that would drive Castiel to madness if such a thing existed in hell. Instead, he is suffocating on a mouthful of wet dirt, locked in a tight box with no light. Castiel wonders if this is some new torture, some new way to burn his soul until nothing remains but acrid, black smoke. Perhaps making him think that he is free is the worst of it all.
as the breath whooshes from his lungs. He coughs and groans as Gabriel and Dean shriek with laughter.
Dean smiles. Of course, Castiel could sing. Dean doesn’t know why he even wondered that in the first place. Music flows from Castiel as easily as a river finds its way to the sea.
Days pass slowly, and Castiel doesn’t notice the change, most of the time. He doesn’t leave the house willingly. Sometimes, he brings himself to look up possible cases in the area. He doesn’t follow the leads, though. He doesn’t have the energy.
“You didn’t take your grace back,” Castiel notices. He assumes so, anyway - angels don’t need to eat, even though Dean has expressed an affinity for burgers in the past. But now, Dean is wolfing down his cereal, clearly
Dean isn’t surprised. Just crestfallen. He inhales, taking a steady breath as he watches his father fold his arms across his chest. They’d barely spoken since their confrontation after John walked in on Dean and Benny. Dean had been terrified to ask for anything since then, let alone something he knows his father wouldn’t approve of. And now, in their small kitchen, Dean can barely look his father in the eye.
“Thank you, Alfie,” Castiel says slowly. He finishes his second glass with a sigh. Alfie grins before hurrying off to take the order of a group of women. Reluctantly, Castiel turns his head, watching the stripper finish Dean’s dance. From this angle, it’s hard to see Dean’s face, which is a relief. The longing in the angel’s eyes is too much for him to bear. Dean gets up when the stripper returns to the stage and hurries over to Castiel at the bar.
not Michael. He offers a hand to Castiel, helping him stumble to his feet. Carefully, he reaches a hand across to cradle Castiel’s face. The blood splattered across his skin vanishes as the swelling fades, leaving him feeling renewed. Dean sighs, keeping his hand gently pressed against Castiel’s jaw.
The other laughs bitterly. “I told you to stop doing that. Dean is not who we thought he was. Not anymore. He’s not even
Dean freezes where he sits. “Cas’...I’m not any good. I’ve never played before.”
Quickly pulling into the top of Balthazar’s driveway, Castiel ignores Dean’s grumbling about the slow transportation and hurries out of the car. Castiel can hear a crash of noise from inside before the two even reach the door. Panic creeps up into his throat. The very idea of losing Balthazar --
And it’s true — Dean is. Castiel had been sitting on his lap, grinding down on top of him as he kissed him, and Dean had eagerly kissed him back, licking long and slow into his mouth as he held his hips in place. Now, Castiel is ready (so he thinks) and he wants this,
him the way Dean is, now. Dean is gentle and urgent, eager and soft; he doesn’t treat Castiel like he’s
“She was the last one,” Lucifer sighs. “But she did most of the work for me, killing those other two.” He turns his eyes up to his brother. His pale face is splattered with the witch’s blood. A small, knowing smile upturns the corners of his dry lips.
“Won’t you at least tell me why I’m so important to you?” he breathes.
find out about this. Wouldn’t find out about this Not under any circumstances. Dean winces as that ugly word rings in his ears again, harsh and unfaltering.
things for humans. Surely, they can’t.
“I am no soldier,” Dean says quietly. “I am something you do not understand. Just because we — we were close does not mean you have the right to make assumptions about me.” His eyes glow - a warning. A warning that may have frightened Castiel once upon a time. It does nothing to him now - he’s seen Dean at his most vulnerable,
Dean thinks to himself. He doesn’t mention the knife. Best not to bring that up.
“Huh?” Dean asks, startled. “Sorry, ‘mmh good. You’re just - shit, Cas, you’re beautiful.”
“I just...I just wanted to say that I hear you play the piano. At night. And...I really like it. I love it, actually. It’s something I look forward to, no matter what the song is. I just wanted you to know that.”
“Don’t mention it,” Dean murmurs. Waving them both goodbye, Dean watches Benny take off down the street. Castiel’s gaze lingers on the boy, watching him go.
“I’m going to Cas’ house,” he says gruffly, trying not to meet his brother’s eyes.
“One day, Lucifer snapped. It wasn’t his fault. One of the women, Rebecca, I believe her name was, began screaming at him for leaving his toys out on the kitchen floor. He was only eleven...and he had been playing. I don’t know why she made such a fuss about it, but she came after him and began striking him again and again. I begged her to stop, but she wouldn’t. She was bruising him, backing him into a corner, calling him horrible, horrible things. So he fought back. He grabbed a knife and began slashing at her and...I don’t know what happened after that...it’s blurry...but he killed her. I found out later that she...she was pregnant. Only a few weeks along...but…”
Castiel gives Dean a tired, weary smile. His hair is tousled and littered with pieces of cut grass and dirt. As rays of light dart out from behind the clouds, they cast little reflections of light across his damp hair like the beginnings of a halo.
“No,” Castiel says.
Castiel shuts the door, leaving Dean on the porch alone with the thoughts racing like bats in the night. He hurries home, eager to clear his head and the thudding in his chest.
"I think it’s time for bed," Castiel hums. "Say goodnight to Dean."
Castiel frowns. “I suppose it was.”
“How do you know when the other person wants to? Do they tell you?”
“Cas’,” he whimpers. “I’m...so sorry.”
“Thank you,” he breathes. “Wow, thank you, thank you!”
Dean hears Castiel gasp.
Both of them are laughing. And, even from a distance away, careful to keep his hood pulled over his head to not draw attention to himself, he can spot the telltale signs that he’s
The angel winces. “Ooh, that’s too bad. Because...I’m done. The name is Alastair, by the way. I specialize in this kind of work. Michael trained me himself. Only fitting that he’d end up in this chair, too.”
The older Castiel laughs bitterly, wiping a hand down his dirty, haggard face. “Of course...
They run back across the sand. The roar fills Castiel’s ears, reaching a dizzying crescendo that would surely blow out his ears. It’s only Dean’s hand grasped tightly in his own that keeps him moving, keeps him trudging back over the beach before the water crashes down around them like icy, liquid concrete.
” he growls. “And you’re not moving from that spot. I run this camp and I don’t need you walking around making everything
“First time, huh?” the bartender asks. Castiel nods, hating that it’s so obvious. But there’s no use lying to the boy - he sticks out here like a sore thumb. “It can be a little overwhelming. I used to be a dancer here. I think I like bartending better.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Without breaking the kiss, Castiel awkwardly stumbles back, pulling Dean with him as he tries to back away from the hood and against the back door of the car. He fumbles for the handle, jerking it open awkwardly before lowering them both inside. It isn’t much privacy, but it is better than where they were standing before. Their knees bump together as Dean climbs on top of him, making soft, eager noises into the kiss as he awkwardly climbs onto Castiel’s lap with a gasp between parted lips.
is the matter with you?!”
“Yes.
“You found this?!” he demands. Much like his brother, Castiel has incredibly piercing blue eyes. They stare straight through Dean, making his skin feel tightly pulled over his bones. Short stature and a stiff, steely posture make the boy seem ready to pop a loose spring as his eyes dart to the locket in Michael’s hand. His short, inky black hair sticks up from an attempt to comb it back.
“Only if you do the same for yourself.”
Garth laughs. “Yeah, well, I know how to do my job.” His eyes flicker between the two of them as Castiel shuffles awkwardly in place.
“...never evil,” Castiel finishes for him. “He was dark. He was...angry. Our father is to thank for that. He...he never...quite fit in with the rest of us; the women our father brought into the house, our mother who just...stayed in her room all the time. Lucifer never wanted to study his verses, never wanted to go to church. And none of that is all bad. But...I don't know. He was so angry all the time. Sometimes I don't think he knew what to do with himself." Castiel draws in a slow, shaky breath.
“Hey, be nice,” Dean snaps. “Didn’t Bible camp teach you any manners? They aren’t whores just because they’re doing crap you don’t like.”
“This is all I am good at. And it allows me to save money. For myself. For Gabriel.”
“Perfect, you’re perfect, mine,” Dean chants softly. He doesn’t even seem to be aware he’s doing it. Castiel squeezes his eyes shut, the praise making him feel weak. He doesn’t
“I know.”
“...then we all have a hell of a lot to atone for, huh?” Balthazar finishes for him. Castiel laughs again with a shake of his head. Nothing about this is
Peering out the front door, he keeps a distance from the small crowd pulling open the gates as a large HMMWV comes to a stop. He spots the man the older Castiel had slept with the night before - James - following Castiel out of the vehicle, his hand twitching noticeably at his side. Without warning, the other Castiel raises his gun at his side and shoots James through the head, dropping him instantly in front of the rest of the camp.
“You knew you would go down there?” Dean asks suspiciously. “Really? ‘Cause, it doesn’t seem like you know a damn thing.”
“I’ll be seeing you, then?” he asks finally. “Or...you’ll at least give me a call?”
Castiel sighs, gritting his teeth. The way that Dean is casually avoiding the events of last night is honestly a relief to Castiel, even if it’s blatantly obvious. He grips the steering wheel tightly in his hands, pulling off the exit to park the car outside of an old library.
Castiel shrugs. “Perhaps that is what makes her pretty,” he points out. Dean grimaces, wiping a hand down his face.
“I always worry about you.”
“No, you’re right,” Dean says quietly. “There’s nothing I could possibly do to you. It would...hurt me worse than it would hurt you, anyway."
John tells him, day after day.
“I don’t know if we will,” Dean murmurs, feeling dazed. “But I’m not gonna give up on him, Benny. I can’t.”
Dean makes Castiel drive and provides directions along the way. Angel teleportation would make it easier to track them and Dean doesn’t want to risk it. If need be, the other angels
“Yes.”
Dean pales beside Castiel. He wipes a hand slowly down his face with a shake of his head.
He blinks, and the world disappears. He’s no longer outside - he’s on a bed, inside the motel room where Lucifer left him, the sounds of Dean’s pained cries still ringing in his ears. Gazing out the window, Castiel nearly weeps with relief when he sees the street is back to its normal, fixed self. He checks the date on the calendar folded up on the motel table: 2009. He’s back in his right time.
“I’m doing what I have to do to save the world,” she says quietly. “I care about this place too much to let it burn. And...as
this day. Before their father had lost his sanity, he would leave the house for days at a time to preach at massive faith seminars across the state, leaving them alone with their mother and the other women he married in the past couple of years.
Castiel casts his gaze down to the floor. His finger finds a loose piece of the brown carpet and he absently pulls it through his fingers.
Another punch to the mouth unleashes a rough groan from Castiel’s throat. His legs buckle as Benny hits him again and again. Guilt and unbearable shame render him foggy and unresponsive.
when someone is in pain.
It’s his way of honoring Balthazar’s sacrifice and finally being able to let Lucifer go.
December 1976
as we said, is protected. Warded off. We can’t track it down on our own in time.”
At least, in the future, he knows how to properly get laid.
Before Castiel can ask what he means, the warehouse begins to tremor. It’s soft at first, so gentle Castiel could barely feel it at all. But soon, the shaking grows in volume, and Castiel nearly tumbles to the ground as the very floor beneath them begins to
Sam has club after school, and Dean and Castiel walk back alone. Dean chews the inside of his cheek, grappling with how to confront Castiel about his odd behavior. Or if he even should. He decides that the silence, the aching, terrible anticipating, the
Dean opens his mouth, but Robert raises a stiff hand, passing a glare towards Dean.
“You’re strong, Jo,” Castiel murmurs. “You always have been. You’re fighting a good fight.”
“Keep out of sight. And go to bed. I have a supply run early tomorrow morning. If you can’t do that much, I’m just going to get rid of you.”
“Dammit, Balthazar…” Castiel murmurs. He hurries into the kitchen, equally as abandoned. A thin line of dust lays across every surface, save for where a singular notebook lay open on the kitchen table with the words: CASTIEL - FIND CAMP CHITAQUA. NEAR THE WESTERN BORDER OF THE CITY.
Dean’s eyes droop, half-closed as he reaches up a steady hand and touches the man’s chest. He rips off the thin, white shirt, exposing his toned chest and tattoos that Castiel can’t quite place. Dean’s
Dean gives him a small wave. A small, worried smile stretches across his chiseled face. “Hey, Cas.”
Castiel shakes his head, before uttering;
“No. We wouldn’t have done this. We wouldn’t have sacrificed innocent people - people who
Castiel pinches the bridge of his nose. He stares at Dean in quiet disbelief as the angel sips from a glass of whiskey in quiet thought. The irony of an angel taking him to a
And now, this strange string of killings that appear to be targeting hunters and nothing else. He can’t help but wonder if they’re connected somehow.
“The answer is ‘a lot,’” Dean adds.
“Man, I felt kinda bad dragging you in there. You sure you’re alright? I’m sorry if I, uh, made you uncomfortable or anything.”
Dean wipes a hand down his face as he sighs.
Sam is standing over Dean when he blinks awake the next day. With a jolt, Dean glares at him, kicking at him through the blankets, which Sam ignores. The clock reads 11:30 a.m. — Dean had slept in late. It takes a moment to familiarize himself with the strange, new surroundings.
She could beat me up with one hand tied behind her back.”
Balthazar stares at him, his face blank and unreadable.
“I don’t understand,” Castiel says quietly, rooted in place at the entrance to the barn doors. “I don’t understand what you are or what you want. What did you do to my brother?”
“You’re right. It isn’t...but all that...that’s not why I can’t...we can’t…”
Castiel feels like he might pass out. He ignores it as they climb out of the car and hurry inside through the front doors.
At Balthazar’s house, Castiel tells Dean about his reaper deal in a dull, monotone voice. Angry at the
“Threaten me all you want. I’m going to kill that witch and you’re not going to lay a single finger on this town. If I’m really so important to you...then it looks like you’re out of options.”
“I’ve got time, buddy.”
“You and Sam, man...both of you are too smart for your own damn good.”
“Castiel -”
“Why not?!”
“This isn’t a fairytale, Castiel,” Alastair says, his voice low and sing-songy as he folds his arms over his chest. Dean grabs Castiel by the hair and forces him back up onto his knees, ushering a harsh cry from his mouth as the pain makes his eyes sting. “Your sad, human definition of love isn’t going to save the day. Michael will either take you as his vessel or kill you if he finds he no longer has use for you - that’s the way it was always going to be. He doesn’t care about your poor, broken heart.”
Walking back into the trap, Castiel raises his hand gripping the syringe, and gently presses the needle to her throat.
“Call me Dean,” he says simply. He moves his fingers across the array of weapons Castiel and Balthazar had brought with them, idly observing them, but making no move to pick any of them up. With an impatient sigh, Castiel bares his teeth.
“Wait, what are you — “
Behind Dean, Alastair is laughing, clearly amused by the spectacle.
"Cas, what's up?"
Dean quirks an eyebrow, silently waiting for Castiel to continue. Surely, Castiel can’t lie to an angel. That would be...offensive, wouldn’t it? Surely Dean would be able to tell. Angels, as Castiel knows, are holy, perfect beings. Even if Dean is already shattering every, perfect image of an angel Castiel has kept in his head since childhood. He draws in a deep breath, suddenly wishing he had a drink for himself as forces himself to keep talking.
“That’s because I am. There’s...a lot that I can’t tell you. But I can help you. You have to trust me, Castiel. Anything I can do to earn your trust...anything at all…”
When Dean nods, Castiel turns and staggers up the steps like a blind man, gripping the rail hard in his fist and drags himself into bed without taking off his clothes.
And the Bible didn't mention us
Castiel opens his mouth and closes it again.
“Most food just tastes like molecules to me,” Dean points out conversationally. “But that Eat ‘N Go is
“Our brother is his vessel?” Castiel asks hoarsely. The other nods.
I wanted to post chapters once a week since I have them all written out and simply edit/revise them before I place them here - but I was so excited to share this with you all that I've been posting all over the place! There's one more chapter left after this one, and I'm hoping with all my might that it's gonna be a good ending to this story that's been sitting in my head for so many years.
Castiel feels his chest flutter as he looks at Dean. He feels his face flush with heat as he stammers out his next words.
Wordlessly, Castiel glares at his brother, before pushing past him. Dean stumbles awkwardly to follow him, giving a half-hearted wave to Michael before the two finally stumble out outside. Of all things he expected when returning the boy’s necklace, this certainly hadn’t been one of them. Feeling on-edge, Dean feels a twist of pity in his gut for the boy as he quickly follows him up the driveway and out onto the sidewalk.
“Then the whole world will die. Dean will destroy
“Who are you?” Castiel asks lowly. The man chuckles.
He follows a far distance back, only hurrying to catch up when Castiel rounds the corner of the block and disappears out of sight. From this distance, Castiel wouldn’t be able to hear his footsteps, especially with Dean creeping across the grass of the neighborhood lawns. The streetlights and faint glimmer of the crescent moon provide enough light for Dean to watch Castiel and follow him from a far enough distance not to be detected.
“Oh — goodness. Alright, alright, Cas, that was better. That’s a little bit better. Much, much more like my good apprentice. You learn fast, Castiel. Good boy…”
Castiel opens his mouth, shaking his head with a weak cry. He raises a hand as Benny brings his fist down on Castiel’s face again and again and again. His vision flickers in and out, and for a long moment, Castiel is sure he’s looking down the barrel all over again. He’s going to die, again, except this time, he is going to die curled up in a gas station bathroom by the hand of a man whose death he was responsible for.
Dean thinks about it for a moment.
“She was my sister.”
. Shaking himself off, Dean marches forward, ducking behind a tree when Castiel stops across the street from the entrance of a building with a dim, neon sign blinking in bright yellow and white:
Castiel and Dean look at each other.
They kiss a lot, too. Castiel likes that, and so does Dean, especially when he realizes how different kinds of kisses feel. Castiel kisses his cheek, and Dean blushes. He kisses the back of his neck, and Dean’s whole body wriggles like a content cat. They kiss, long and slow on the couch, half-clothed, hands wandering around each other’s bodies at a steady easy pace. No need for rush, though it’s clear from the shared, muffled moans, quietly passed between slips of the tongue and muffled lips, that they want more.
is the song I had in mind when I pictured Castiel playing a melody of his own.
For a long moment, Dean doesn’t say anything at all. He tilts his head, staring at Castiel as his blade slips down his sleeve and into his hand.
Castiel reaches back and punches her in the face. Her head jerks back, but as a trickle of blood begins running down her nose, she only laughs and cups his face with her hand.
“I’ll go get you a dry towel, my little salamander,” she says with a laugh.
From his position, he can see the two of them fall together from the window, uncovered by curtains. His future self stares at the other man with stoic intensity, suggesting he’s going to devour the man instead of screwing him. He’s another mission, Castiel realizes; the man is something that he will take and conquer without faltering. It’s all a hassle of movement as they dip in and out of view from the window, quickly undressing without taking their time as discarded clothes drop needlessly to the ground.
“Me?” The man shakes his head faintly. “It’s not obvious? I’m the one who gripped you tight and raised your ass from perdition.”
are going to be nice to him. He’s my friend. He took me in when I had nothing. And you walked into his house at
Dean eyes him warily. “Hey. Don't say that."
Castiel feels his veins run cold at the ugly memory. “Yes,” he admits. “And he wasn’t the first. But Benny died because I got too close to him. I...it hasn’t exactly done anything for my conscience.”
She throws a rolled-up newspaper at his feet. “I suggest you read that. And then, I want you to spend some time in this world to see how your actions will affect those around you - to see how much more you really have to lose.”
But with the love he’d surely carry with him for the rest of his days, he knows that there will still be grief. And he knows that not every day will be easy. He still spends many of them unable to get out of bed, hardly able to bring himself to eat or drink or bathe until Dean coaxes him out from under the covers with gentle hands and a goofy joke. There are days where Castiel will catch Dean sitting on the table where Balthazar once sat, staring absently out the window like he’s waiting for someone to come home. And with a gentle hand on Dean’s shoulder and a whispered promise in his ear, Castiel draws Dean back to the land of the living, back
“I can leave if you have other duties to attend to,” Castiel says, standing up abruptly. “It was nice spending time with you, Dean. And seeing you, Mr. Winchester.”
“I dunno. I’m kinda getting used to this whole “human” thing. Not a fan of being hungry, but
Something about the surly way that Robert says Castiel’s nickname irritates him, but he tries not to let it show.
SENATE APPROVES EXECUTIVE MILITARY USE
“Thank you!”
“I was.”
“I considered studying theology when...if I go to college,” Castiel says slowly, noticing Dean’s curiosity. “My mother used to read to me before she died. But music was always...what I liked to do best.”
“I don’t know,” Dean shrugs. He slurps the milk out of his bowl, setting it down with a please sigh when the bowl is empty. “It wasn’t that different from what he used to tell me his whole life. But then, in my dream, he turned into a chicken. Then I woke up.”
“Guess that makes me the weary maiden you kiss and run from, huh?” Benny teases.
“And how am I supposed to trust you?” Castiel whispers fiercely. He slams a hand down on the bar, baring his teeth to Dean as though he’d be any
And Dean...he’d been expecting rage from Dean. Disgust, perhaps. But Dean looks crestfallen.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No...no. You can say whatever you want, okay?”
“He’s gone for good. Lucifer, too. It’s over...it’s...it’s all over.”
Castiel. He made a deal, a deal for power. Your brother will be able to wield the power of the Devil himself, be a proper, powerful vessel in life and death, all for the price of one soul:
“Excuse me - “ He flashes her his badge. “I’m Agent Harkness. I’m here about the missing girl - Joanne Harvelle. Is there anything you can tell me about her?”
That draws a chuckle from the other boys. Briefly, Dean catches Benny’s grateful eyes before Dick grabs Dean by the front of the shirt and jerks him closer. Dean glares at him,
He grabs the necklace from his pocket, holding it out for the older boy to see. He raises a slow, cautious eyebrow. Regarding Dean with little trust in his eyes as he reaches out to take it from Dean’s hand. He examines it for a moment with a shake of his head.
I wanted to thank everyone in my Discord chat who provided encouraging words and who looked over the final chapter to make sure the formatting made sense. I also wanted to thank my friend Avery who was a big source of encouragement back when I was working on this story in high school. And of course, I want to thank everyone who left comments and kudos. It's appreciated more than I can say.
When Castiel returns, he collapses onto the chair and tells Balthazar everything. Balthazar needs at least two shots of whiskey to get through Castiel’s explanation, his eyes blowing wide at the mention of the Devil and the broken Seal. When Castiel finally finishes, Balthazar leans his elbows on his legs, watching Castiel with heavy eyes and a quiet shake of his head.
Balthazar gives him a long, steady look. Castiel is aware of how he sounds - hopeful, yet apprehensive. Terrified, but steady in his words. Castiel hopes that it wasn’t Lucifer’s doing just as much as he hopes that it was his attempt. Perhaps he is selfish enough to hope that Lucifer cares for him enough to try, as much as he resents the idea that his brother would be so stupid as to doom his own fate for Castiel. The paradoxical tide of everything Castiel feels for his brother is nothing that Castiel is unaccustomed to.
album, and hauls it downstairs, glancing out the window for any sign of his father. It shouldn’t be a big deal - two friends listening to music after school
His hands shake as he quickly opens it, heart thudding in his chest. The message reveals a single word and set of numbers.
With alcohol. His dad
Dean’s expression softens at once. He blinks in surprise, unable to speak for a long moment before he takes a step forward again, this time with less intention to shake the absurdity out of Castiel’s body. He reaches for Castiel’s hand, instead. But Castiel pulls away, turning his head away from Dean.
Castiel follows Lucifer’s gaze towards their house upon the hill. In a long skirt and button-down shirt, their mother jogs down the hill, eyebrows raised in delight. Castiel’s heart swells, his eyes filling with tears at the sight of her - happy, not hunched in bed, out in the sunlight. Her long, black hair is tied neatly in a bun, concealed by the small, white hair covering she always wore whenever she left the house.
“It’s -- it’s not just about that,” Dean sighs. “I just...I don’t know. Don’t you feel like you need a break? We could get the hell outta here for a little bit...maybe just a few weeks. A month over the summer before you go back to school.”
Dean nods. Wringing his fingers, he shoves his hands into his jean pockets and goes upstairs to change into a messier shirt and a pair of faded jeans. He knows, deep in his chest, that his father is wrong about Castiel. He doesn’t
“I’m going to take him home,” Dean says. “Jo, you...you need to…”
The colors of hell burn brightest in the dark.
“Perhaps I will.”
“You don’t need him, Dean,” Benny says seriously. “No one really gets it...but at the end of the day, you and I? We weren’t hurting anyone. And I doubt your brother wasn’t hurtin’ no one either. None of it matters. Call it gross and shit...I don’t know. People throw around all kinds of dumb stuff about who other people kiss or fuck or whatever. And it hurts. It always hurts. But...at the end of the day...hell, it doesn’t matter. It ain’t gross. Or bad. It’s...it’s none of that.”
Dean looks up at him, his eyes searching Castiel’s face.
The offer surprises Dean. He’d never been to Castiel’s house before - another, unspoken agreement. He didn’t want to be around Castiel’s family any more than Castiel did. “To your place?”
“Ssshhhh.” Lucifer presses a finger to his lips, silencing Castiel at once. Startled, Castiel lowers his gun. The two brothers stare at one another wordlessly for a long moment before Lucifer leans down and grabs the woman by the throat as effortlessly as if she were nothing but a doll. Stunned by the display of inhuman strength, Castiel watches as he shoves her against the wall and draws a knife from his belt. With a quick flick of his wrist, he slashes her throat as easily as one would cut through butter. Blood spurts from her neck, ushering a weak, strangled scream from the witch. It drenches Lucifer’s clothes in an acrid splash of red, but he pays it no mind.
to risk it all to grab your ass outta that hole. Don’t take me for a blind soldier, Castiel. I know of heaven’s flaws. I didn’t want this town gone any more than you did.”
Of course, an angel would send you - me - here. They want you to see the show, right? The show where...let me guess...we never save Dean from his self-imposed brainwashing? Where we let him and his angels decimate the earth?”
"Let's go. Castiel - I'll explain everything later. Okay?"
Castiel nods. He still seems puzzled. But he appears to understand better than before. Affectionately, Dean pats him on the shoulder as a soft tendril of longing creeps into his chest. He’s always suspected that Castiel is...not quite comfortable in this world. God only knows that his friend is about as strange as they come. But Dean wants him to be happy. Romantically and otherwise. Other than Sam, Dean’s never felt such a strong urge for another’s happiness like he has for his friend.
Gingerly, Castiel lifts up the sleeve of his t-shirt with shaking fingers. Across his shoulder, a red, raised handprint scars his skin. Something had grabbed him by the shoulder and left that imprint there on his flesh. The scar burns, but the burn is entirely unlike the scorching flames of hell that, molecule by molecule, yearned to burn his very soul of its essence until there was nothing left. This burn is a live wire of nerves and light, not unpleasant as it is strange and alien, so unlike anything Castiel has ever felt. Swallowing thickly, he pushes the sleeve of his shoulder back down, concealing the handprint once more.
He glances at Benny who seems just as eager to leave. Benny follows the boys out as Dean keeps a firm hand on Castiel, who remains completely silent. They hurry out of the school and half-jog down the sidewalk, trying to put as much distance between themselves and the school as possible. The biting, winter air stings Dean’s face, ushering Benny to push another clean tissue up against his lip. The walk home seems impossibly far; now that the adrenaline’s wore off, Dean can feel the pain shoot through his entire jaw. Every gust of wind feels like knives raking down his face as they walk, huddled close together. Castiel doesn’t say a word the entire time; like a soldier staring down the battlefield, he marches ahead of Dean and Benny, quiet and rigid as an automaton. It takes almost five minutes to urge Castiel to put the knife back into his coat pocket where it was clenched tightly in his fist.
“Joanne?” he calls out weakly. “Joanne...my name is Castiel. I’m not going to hurt you.”
that shakes the rest of the cabin.
Pamela is a handsy one. Her hands go to Castiel’s hips, even his thighs. Light, friendly flirtations bordering on too touchy, too much. Balthazar has to shoo her away when the words are stuck on Castiel’s tongue. She’s confident and perhaps could be attractive if Castiel had the affinity. He watches her speak to Balthazar, reassuring him that if something otherworldly was to be found, it could be traced with the mark on Castiel’s skin. He’s aware of her eyes on him as he pulls off his coat and tries his best to look away.
“Aw, c’mon, Cas’. You know you love me.”
He wouldn’t get rid of these for anything, especially now that he actually has space to display them. In his room, he sets the stack down beside the others as he pulls at the silver necklace in his pocket again to show it to Sam.
“Father,” Castiel begins hesitantly. Dean can hear the fear in his voice. Carefully, Dean makes a move to stand beside the two brothers, unsure of what he can or should do — only knowing that he
“You punch like a freaking girl,” Dean laughs weakly. Stars dance at the edge of his vision. But the comment earns him another blow to the eye. His vision blurs, and he barely makes out Castiel stalking over to the group of them. A glint of silver catches his eye.
” Save for his heavy breathing and soft moans, Dean is quiet. He’s trembling, from overexertion or pleasure or both, Castiel doesn’t know. But he nods as he sinks his teeth onto Castiel’s shoulder, the bite hard enough to bruise as he begins pumping his hips faster than before. Each thrust makes Castiel’s body sing as he hits his prostate again and again, and with Castiel’s head thrown back and Dean’s name on his lips, Dean whispers a broken curse as he spills inside of him.
