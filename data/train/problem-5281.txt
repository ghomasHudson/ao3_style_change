"Gimme' that" Dean snatches the phone out of Cas's hand and inspects it. It's a text from Claire, a picture of a grumpy old cat and the text message reads:
Jody and the girls are sitting in the library, Claire flipping the pages of the book she's reading with her switchblade. Watching her is like staring into a mirror of himself twenty-ish years ago. He gets this weird fuzzy feeling in his chest, God he loves her.
Jody raises her eyebrows, "anything else besides a liquid diet?"
"Sam, no," He growls in a tone that leaves no room for arguments. His tight grip on the steering wheel makes his knuckles whiten.
"Okay, you're okay," Dean soothes. It feels like he's comforting a child, not an antediluvian ex-celestial being wearing the body of a middle-aged man. He used to do this when Sammy was a kid, and cried about Dad's drunken outbursts, them moving away (again), or when the other kids in school teased him.
"What?" Sam pops out from the kitchen, his eyes wide, probably prepared for another apocalypse coming their way.
"This was lovely Dean," Cas says after his third portion. The other's nod affirmatively.
"Hello Sam."
The purr of Baby's engine when he turns the ignition sends a shiver down his spine. It still feels like coming home every time he sits behind the wheel. God, he has missed this. Making things even better, Cas is sitting next to him in the passenger seat, shuffling through the box with cassette tapes.
"Where did you get this? I've never seen it" Sam signs, looking perplexed.
And Dean shuts off, he can't deal with Sam's disappointment. He stares at his brother, but he doesn't see him. He is somewhere else, back in the dungeon, running away from Death. He hears Cas' voice, saying goodbye for the last time.
—another name for core, the Self that can tap the power within the Blood. If shattered, the Jewel shatters, and the Blood is broken to either Birthright or completely shattered to basic craft. (See Shattered,  Broken to Birthright)
Dean avoided the pointed look his father shot at him. Maybe he and Dad had a different definition of family, but by trying to advance the technology, it’d keep the Winchesters secure. Why couldn’t his dad see that?
“Cassie, he doesn’t deserve you.”
Bobby shrugged. "Lots of people forget for different reasons. Maybe you knew it was something that wouldn't exactly help you with peace in the hereafter."
Well, Gabriel now knew the gates were closed, in any case, and he knew Metatron did it. "Metatron stole my grace to make it happen," Castiel admitted sheepishly.
Once the server returned for their change, they asked to wrap the extra sirloin for them.
They call guards to accompany Hansel, the boy they saved in the woods, for a hearty meal before sending him back to his family. Dean notes that his own family is in mourning clothes. He feels guilt over the fact that he's not only caused them enough grief for the entire hunt, but he's also forced them to mourn for him.
To Cas' credit, he puts two and two together. A bluish silvery light envelops Castiel while his eyes glow, and mutters to himself, "That's why I haven't been able to track her lately. I've been hunting for the
Cas has been
that particular story. "You a voyeur now?" Dean demanded because that memory had been private. Treasured even, because it was the first time he had laughed that way in a long time.
." Thus they were given His grace, and they called him Father, for it was He who made them whole. The grace He breathed into them because it was His power; the swords the angels forged because it was His will; finally, the wings were bestowed because angels were first and foremost His messengers, and it was His grace personified in them. Thereupon, the youngest angel was made whole, His celestial being, finally given name and purpose: "Castiel, Angel of Thursday."
“You wanted to see a light show, right?” Dean indulgently said as they strolled in. “Just keep it within budget, Sammy.”
A throat cleared to his left, and he jolted at Manny and Sam, who both had different expressions on their faces. Dean resisted the urge to run back for a towel and hide his near-nakedness behind it. Thank god he had drawers on. What was Sam thinking for Chrissake? He shouldn’t have brought Manny inside their room.
“I understood the words,” Sam drawls, pausing to look at Dean boggled before he continues, “but somehow, I don’t really understand the sentence.”
It took him more than nine hours by guesstimate to return to his personal patch, and that was saying something for his state of mind, because, as Tessa pointed out, time was a variable in Heaven dependent on how much your soul can bear it.
The One That Got Away'
Dean winked as he caught Manny watching him. Manny looked away, and Dean noticed the smallest of blushes on his face. Dean found the reddened tips of his ears even cuter. He liked the slight stubble the man had, and the creases underneath his eyes. To top it off, his hair was disheveled beyond belief; Dean mentally dubbed it ‘sex hair.’
Hannah has been a slave in Michaela’s court since before Castiel served. She has been a companion for him and a friend while he learned the ways of the Eryien court. It was a Blessing from the Light in his adolescent years. Especially when he’d transitioned from being a warrior-slave into a pleasure slave.
I will get your promise in the unknown future when you do decide to get reincarnated. You get more out of this than I do, whereas I don't even know if you're planning to be reincarnated at all."
“Yeah, it’s the closed space. It’s messing with our heads.” Dean sighs as he crosses over, wrapping his arms around Castiel’s waist and hooking his chin over his shoulder. “We haven’t been this stationary in a long time. I miss driving Baby across the open road.”
Both Hannah and Jack settle in the middle, and the trunk is long enough, despite being narrow, that they are far away from Balthazar and Castiel’s axes.  Hannah calls in a decanter filled with ale, honey, and spices and pours some over the gnarled log. Jack happily writes the symbols he’s learned from his lessons before they strip the tree of its bark.
The Chevrolet Impala is obviously a 1960’s car (duh) and since we were going for steampunk, Baby was converted to its earlier cousin, a
She had sensed the levity of the moment as she straightened and leaned towards him. “There are things you don’t know about me, John.”
"No," she said softly, closing her eyes to breathe in a couple of times before looking up at Kevin. "It should be fine, then. I had a smooth pregnancy; the prenatal visits were fine. The baby had a heartbeat and everything. He wasn't really that active, but he was fine. He was just delivered dead, that's all. I'm sorry, agents, will that be all? I feel like I have to lie down for a while."
His duty was to bring Sam to college. After that? Who knows? He planned to grab whatever job he could get and work to support Sam through school. Dean could give Sam the freedom to concentrate on his studies while he focused on keeping a roof over their heads and food in the kitchen.
It’s Jack who always wakes up first. The nephilim doesn’t require as much sleep as humans and his initial task is usually to look for Castiel. Jack finds him kneeling on the dungeon floor, scraping stubborn candle wax from the cement.
"Yeah, yeah, laugh it up, gigantor," Dean muttered as he resisted the urge to keep recording.
At the moment that his arm passed through the gaps in the bars of light, images of his arm returning to him hacked in pieces were bombarding his head. It was so much more disturbing when Lucifer lifted Dean's wrist to his mouth, and Lucifer
“I quit NovaCorp and devoted my focus to this. Cas, it’s sold out already, and I have another hundred waiting with just enough capital to build more.”
Yeah, Dean was afraid of that. He was never a fan of blackberries, but hey, it was Cas’ pet project and there were a lot of blackberries. “Why are you making food? ‘Cuz last I heard you didn’t need to eat.”
“You can have one.” Cas paused to think then decided, “Gabriel can have one too.”
"But I like these songs," Cas mumbles, hand reaching towards the tape recorder.
To distract himself from the intensity of the gaze, Dean—ever the patient one—began to tap his thumb on his thigh and surveyed the thermal-gas station. He noticed the barest hint of the piping running underneath the gutter of the building. He assumed it was for the engine he’d found beside the bathroom door, always ready to produce steam to power the station.
was just a fifteen-minute drive, or Dean would have throttled the car in anxiety or would have dropped to his knees to beg for forgiveness. Both would have been a bad idea.
There was even one perfect moment where the wind blew softly. It ruffled all the surrounding leaves in a whispering symphony. The sun’s dying rays lit random spots from between the thick branches of the forest. But the beauty faded into insignificance as Dean observed Castiel.
. I don’t know about you, but I’m getting antsy.” Dean swings his accusing glare from Sam to Castiel. “If you purge any nasties hitching a ride now and then purge them when I return, it

It doesn't prevent it from happening in the
Once they got to the spare bedroom, Sam heaved himself heavily across the single bed and pouted. “Your face is gonna get stuck that way, Sammy,” Dean teased, pulling out fresh clothes for Sam to change into before bedtime.
While waiting for the beverages, the chimes from the doors ring and John Winchester walks in. He goes straight to the counter and orders one slice of pie before sitting down at a table next to Dean’s. They don’t talk on a spear to spear thread in Terreille for fear of being overheard by a darker Jewel.
When the Righteous Man chooses reincarnation over an eternity in Heaven, Castiel is lost. He begins searching for the soul he knew in an Earth that has been vastly changed by the times.
Huh. So there were no answers for that then. “Do you have a recipe somewhere? Because I’m not letting you kill the pie.”
- represents all orders needed for a specific deployment, led by a captain who oversees other garrisons deployed under him.
“Dean and I Googled stuff instead of using Bing,” Jack babbles, almost vibrating with the news in contrast to his usual stillness. “We Googled your name, and he’s correcting Castiel’s Wikipedia article.”
I would also like to thank
off-topic," Gabriel said in exasperation. And Castiel tilted his head to the side because he thought that that had been the message. "Point is, brother, I am an archangel. I am a pillar that holds creation up. I know why I came back. The question is… why did you?"
"I'll be back," she whispered before she stepped through and the doorway closed.
The Enochian on this fic was heavily researched, so I could come up with a good spell foundation for Castiel. All the Enochian on Supernatural have been translated by
Clearing his throat from the impropriety, Castiel lights one of the many candles by the poolside with Craft. The aromatic scent of sandalwood fills the air. Castiel reaches for Dean and tries to scrub his back, but Dean waves him off. Instead, he tries to hold Castiel motionless with one hand on Castiel’s shoulder.
Once Castiel had arranged himself sufficiently on the couch, and Bobby had dragged something comfortable to sit on to make the angel's neck eye level, Cas hyperextended his neck and drew a line on his neck from his ear to his clavicle, "This muscle is the sternocleidomastoid." Castiel then pointed to the area that bisected the muscle he previously mentioned. "This blood vessel is the external jugular."
Oh wow, okay, this is part of the
Balthazar is a few centuries Castiel’s senior, which is almost of an age in their long-lifespans. He’s been in Michaela’s court for far longer. A pleasure slave broken a handful of years before Castiel was deemed worthy to serve.
Joshua looked at Castiel. "The baby was not granted a soul."
"Speaking of which, how did I get here?" Dean asks, waving his hand around the room.
"Maybe, but they're Heaven's children," Cas answered.
The whispers are inevitable because he is a slave, and the mother is a Queen. But since there are other Queens in attendance, Lucian pays mind to them and leaves Castiel. She makes her circuit and talks to them, accepting their well wishes and gifts, reveling in the attention.
Sam sighed as he pushed the plate of
Dean caught Sam’s curious gaze and briskly shook his head. When Sam cast one more questionable glance at Manny, Dean cleared his throat. Sam turned to the woman and paid her for two unlimited tickets, which came in the form of bright red armbands.
"And how was that, Cas' dick?" Lucifer asked in mild curiosity as he brushed through his feathers and hummed. He was straightening the feathers as he passed, moving over the primaries and the coverts as if wondering which, of all the feathers he had, he would give to Dean.
"The Chamber of Souls? We're looking for a conduit from the treasury to the womb," Kevin supplied when it became clear that Castiel was still thinking about the Caretaker.
"It's a gift." He snatched the mix from the table and tapped it with his fingers for emphasis before offering it back, arm outstretched to the angel while his eyes were pointedly still looking at his work. "You keep those."
(I wanted to add Take me Home, Country Roads... but... it was a 1997 song. I guess it's a  BONUS track then XD)
“You have impeccable timing,” Sam says, admiring the slowly moving sun and clicking off his light. “Even with this virus, I mean we still get moments like these, you know. It gives me hope.”
Gabriel pursed his mouth, squinted at Castiel before he continued, “I had a hundred boxes made with my money.”
Closing the book, he brought it to the till, manned by a young woman whose name tag read ‘Becky.’ Castiel pushed over the antique tome before asking, “Do you know where I could change my GRACE uplink codes for the NovaWatch?”
"Oh god, you should watch more things in your downtime, Cas, because the TV is God's playground brought to life," Dean pointed out as he found a seat on the small desk that Castiel had dragged from one of the libraries into his room. "Besides I get lost with all the Zebra and Sheikh that you keep mentioning."
Castiel gives him a wide gummy grin in congratulations. If Jack had been stronger, he would have been ringed as a dangerous male, traded court to court to get a darker-colored Jewel. Opal is stable, solid, and able to protect if needed.
for most of his life. Since his dad figured that putting in the deep sea mineral aquacasite immediately after mining was key to a cleaner and more efficient engine, they’d put all their tinsel (and borrowed more besides) in a massive behemoth working vessel. It mined, constructed, and transported their product to shore.
His eyes widened as he recognized the opportunity it presented. Castiel let his arm drop, shutting down the hologram. He switched his watch from personal documents to place a call by pressing another cog. “Nova, call Balthazar Roché,” he addressed the voice-controlled personal assistant that came bundled with all NovaTech.
He started frowning when a tub of ice cream was unceremoniously dropped in front of him. He looked at the big container with a puzzled expression, noting that the condensation was going to mar the antique wood if it remained too long on top of the table.
and cranked the volume up.
- this post started the idea that Gabriel was in witness protection in a Pepsi Max commercial
Now, the Cage looked somewhat nondescript and ordinary, if you could call bars made of blinding white light ordinary. As if Castiel's mere presence had summoned the archangel, Michael was waiting for him.
"And whose fault is that exactly, dick?" Dean spat out, gripping the bars in anger. "Those angels are going to die.
"Well, he is an angel," Kevin said, eyes still on the screen, back braced against the couch and the armrest. "We could always just pray."
Sam flipped the tape over and checked the label that Dean’d plastered on over the old one:
He made sure he had everything with him and gestured for the Chevrolet’s pilot lighter. Sam tossed them at him in a smooth, practiced gesture. Dean abruptly opened the door and turned to the two men gaping at him in confusion. “Are we going now, or waiting until it’s closed?” he asked, sarcasm lacing his words. “We still have to check out.”
Castiel tightens his wings around the fledgling and rubs his cheek against his brown hair, his hands smoothing the child’s white feathers, spotless despite the red massacre around them. “I woke up, didn’t I? Prince Winchester seems like the sturdy sort.”
“I bought tickets for the Umbrellas,” Dean said proudly as he held up the four tickets Manny would need for the ride.
"The Caretaker?" Gabriel repeated. He frowned, eyes flitting briefly between Kevin and Castiel before settling on Leilah uncertainly, confirming for Castiel that the archangel physically
There was thunder before the silhouette of Michael appeared, then solidified into Adam’s form, wings in the deep green of topaz glowing underneath the bar's lights. Instead of a cloak, he was dressed for battle in a coat of mail. The only concession to the celebration a crown of gold and silver, which looked like it had the rays of the sun shining through at certain angles. “Welcome, brothers. I am blessed for I have not been in your presence since the Second Fall.”
). There is also an axis mundi, which for Dean is a highway. [For Cas, in this fic, it's a star.] The axis mundi, will lead to the center of Heaven which is the Garden. Ash says that Heaven is a butt load of places crammed together (
He was practically fresh out of Purgatory and upset about losing Cas. Kevin had just added on to the entire emotional upset. Dean realized that he was recording the songs for Cas when he recorded
Castiel understood it as the evasion that it was, but let it slide. "It's difficult to grant you eternal happiness if it goes against someone else's idea of happiness."
When he rounded the car, Castiel found that Sam already had what they needed in one hand, his phone in the other. “He’s taken to calling the Chevrolet ‘Baby’,” Sam explained, as he lodged his stone against the curve of a wheel to prevent the heavy car from rolling.
finding you,” Dean argues.
writing Enochian on my baby," Dean warned as he shifted gears, eyeing the chalk that Ash held with his fingers, bypassing the usual means of travel so they could move around Heaven smoothly.
Bobby huffed. Most humans knew that injuring anyone in the neck could kill them and not much else, so Castiel knew where the apprehension was coming from. "Why is it again that you're getting a hunter to extract your grace when we're in Heaven and we could probably scrounge up a doctor somewhere?"
“For me?” Dean asked with a wide smile. Sam made a show of moving away from the meal, hands in the air in surrender.
Castiel had smoothed Aravoth to throw Raki'a back into place, while everybody settled into their former lives back in Heaven. Gabriel, as the only archangel present, was rallying them and ordering them about.
(Or maybe it was because he was locked up after the Garden, but CAS should have known better). One of the
"She's your grandmother. She's the one who told Ash you wanted out." Because it was Heaven, and its residents were nothing if not generous.
There was a pause before Castiel responded, “That you’ve moved on?” He sounded awake and entirely too good compared to Dean’s entire shitty night.
Dean rubbed the bridge of his nose. Heaven didn't even allow headaches as part of the entire afterlife package, but something was soothing about remembered habits. "So you're saying what I'm doing is practically useless."
Castiel almost drowned in the bathwater. “He doesn’t want to hear it.”
Composed of three circles, each circle with three orders
When Dean looks towards the village, two dots illuminate the night sky. This far, they are mere flickering specks, but the lights, coupled with the clanging can only mean one thing: children are missing again.
His family wouldn’t approve;
as the same entity, but, in growing up, we sometimes change. It is the
The Jhinka, like the Angelus, is a patriarchal clan joined by tribal chiefs. Hopefully Dean would find and kill the war leader quickly.  He has an advantage of wearing Jewels since they didn’t, but their numbers are not to be sneered at. Especially for a lone Warlord Prince and a boy barely learning Craft.
They end the call and Dean can still feel the fear burn like acid in his throat. It doesn't make any sense, hunting is all he knows, it's in his blood and engraved in the marrow of his bones. He doesn't know who he is without a gun or a blade in his hand.
"The guy said it might help us" She flips through the delicate pages until she finds what she's looking for, "here!" She says and signs along, smiling widely.
Cas looks at him, with a puzzled expression on his face.
isn't the right word for the chaos that was his experimenting in grungy motel kitchens as a kid, but whatever. He will never forget the time he got the brilliant idea of making a pasta sauce with canned tuna and peanut butter. Disturbingly enough, Sam had licked the plate clean. He sure was a weird kid. Or it was the knowledge of not knowing it could be days, even weeks, before they got to eat a hot meal again.
He's going to make it up to him. To all of them. All he wants is for them to be happy and safe. That is all he needs.
Hesitantly, he lies down and wraps his arms around Cas until his back is flushed against Dean's chest. They've been sleeping in the same bed for almost a week, but this feels ten times more intimate. Dean hasn't been this close to another person in years. But it doesn't feel wrong. Instead it feels like he's been lost and finally found his way back home.
"You gonna tell me what's going on?" Dean murmurs.
Cas smirks and Dean wish this means he's not pissed about the stupid comment he made earlier.
Warnings: Implied underage sex work and mentions of physical abuse.
Dean bites back a laugh, "It's
what he wants? If so, that is a really depressing thought since his life has been nothing but a shit show since 1983.
"Oh God, what happened?"
Dean's been gone before. And Sam managed to live a whole year without him when Dean got stuck in purgatory. Well, if diving head first into a relationship with someone as broken as you can count as
"And blood from below, I'm guessing hell?" Sam questions.
Dean tugs his hands into Sam's shirt, with such force it rips at the seams.
Sam explains what's going on and Rowena gasps and sighs and grimaces, dramatic as always. Dean zones out and stares at the syringe in his hand. He loathes the grace floating inside it. It stole his body away from him. Sometimes it feels like Michael is still inside him and will take control at any given moment. His body doesn't feel like his own anymore.
many animals! Did you know giraffes have seven vertebrates in their neck? Just like humans! And did you know the stripes of each zebra is unique, just like our fingerprints? Oh oh oh, when we get back can we compare our fingerprints? Please Cas!" Jack babbles, Dean can picture him practically jumping up and down with excitement.
- no. There's no chance in hell. Dean brings the tip of the blade up to John's neck, pressing lightly.
"Can I stay here now?" Jack asks, a worry of rejection in his tone.
Dean's chest tightens and he takes a deep breath, "look you said it yourself when I asked you what was real or not," he pulls himself up to rest on his elbow, "
Dean tells her the whole thing. Jody listens carefully, chimes in with a few questions every time the words get stuck down his throat. It is an out of body experience, he can hear his own voice, but it's not really
They both flinch when the door suddenly swings open and Sam bolts in, with a smile going from ear to ear.
Cas mostly stays in his room and only comes out to eat whatever Dean decides to cook for him. So far, he has found out Cas likes lasagna, chicken stir fry and waffles while anything involving fish makes him gag. The stove in the bunker has probably never been used this much since it was installed .
Jody sighs and gives him a warm smile, "I need to do some paperwork down at the station, but I'll probably be back by noon, so don't even think about bolting out of here."
Judging by the soundless movements it's not his brother entering the room, it is Eileen. She's been staying with them ever since Jack brought back everyone Chuck erased. Sam doesn't want to let her out of his sight again, afraid that she might cease to exist if he does.
and kind of wanted Sam to put a goddamn bullet in him to give Chuck the ending he wanted. It would have been easier.
. How could he go on and live his life like nothing happened? Knowing that Cas died because of him. He was ready to die
"Dude, if you're gonna stick that thing in me you should really get your shaking hands under control"
He should be filled with rage, he should be ripping the fabric of the entire universe apart to get Cas back, he should do
He tries to cast an innocent glance at Cas's crotch to see if the movie is affecting him the same way, but can't get a good look without staring like some kind of freak.
"Dean, I know you're grieving but you can't just shut me out. We're going through this
Soon Dean is left with a plate with two  BLT's and a mug of steaming coffee in his hands.
Sam nods and bites his lip, "well… yeah, sure. But Dean, the archangels are dead. The ones we know about at least."
you've felt it, haven't you Dean?" The Shadow says with his dad's voice and wraps one hand around his throat.
worried about before. Maybe because you don't really think you'll die from a bad taco when the world is ending around you.
Eileen picks up Chinese takeout and they eat in front of the TV. It's Sam's turn to  pick out a movie and of course he decides on a pretentious French one. Dean and Eileen mouth to each other behind Sam's back about how much it sucks.
Jody walks to the kitchen and gestures to make him follow along, she starts to prepare sandwiches for both of them.
When that didn't help, he became desperate, he yelled at him, anything to get some kind of reaction. Now it's the silent treatment, the last thing Sam said was that he won't be around to see Dean slowly kill himself.
__________________________________
But he really missed Cas. Just having him around the bunker. But how could he repair things with Cas, would it ever be as it was before? Dean's mind started to wander, he felt himself sinking into that deep black hole of despair he always tried to run away from, or rather tried to drown in whiskey and beer.
. The blade falls from his hand and disappears in the dark.
Dean wakes with a jolt, heart stuck somewhere up his throat. He throws himself out of the car and hurls his guts out on the asphalt beneath him.
Cas could be saved by now, if Dean hadn't been a self-pitying piece of shit. Instead he's been stuck there for more than two months.
Is this a date? Are they on a date?
tried, was ready to exhume the feelings which he buried years ago, only to be interrupted by Jack's return. It's like the universe is trying to send him a message.
Dean swallows thickly, "buddy, I promise you, I'm real."
(Sam) decided he had more important things to do than take care of the dishes.
"Good to know Cas."
Dean slams the wrench against the steel chassis, "Stop!"
"Sam's fine, he's at the bunker, Eileen's there too."
"Cas!" He calls out again, louder this time. Still nothing, not a single thing indicates there's someone or
Just fyi: The Latin is complete mumbo-jumbo so don't quote me on that. Kudos/reviews are much appreciated <3
Since Sam didn't seem to think it was that urgent to extract the grace, Dean gets another beer. And another after that and now he may as well go for a third (or seventh? He doesn't know anymore). Anything to fill the aching hollowness inside of him.
They're interrupted by Eileen who's carrying a book that is almost the same size as her. "Guys, I think we got something."
"Oh, well we're fine" he gives him a fake smile and downs the rest of his beer.
Cas takes forever to decide, he shuffles through the entire library on Netflix before finally pressing play. It seems to be a cowboy movie, so maybe this won't be too bad after all.
Like all chapters, this wouldn't have been possible without my wonderful beta and friend anotherxfangirl <3
Sam brings in the cavalry and in a few days, the Bunker is filled with hunters.
he did. Cas is saved. He's alive. No no no, that means -
if someone can open up the Empty it's him."
"You're taking off? Seriously?" Sam doesn't even sound angry anymore, just drained. Dean doesn't respond, and he can't make out what Sam yells after him the moment he slams the door shut.
The door opens and Eileen slides down the wall to sit beside him. The silence between them is comforting. Sometimes it feels like she gets him more than Sam does, which is strange since she's only been a part of their lives for a few years.
"Food?" She signs and he nods and brings out the leftover pizza which has seen better days. He doesn't care to heat it up, it tastes like ash anyway.
"Something tells me Sam is actually right on this one," she signs back and smiles apologetically. Dean throws his arms up in vexation and glares at the both of them.
"I… I
"I think we need the grace of an archangel, I mean, we used Lucifer's when we saved mom and Jack, remember? And Michael opened the one to Purgatory. It might be the key to crack open this bitch too" His blood is rushing in his ears,
. Any guesses what to make of that?"
"Shut up Cas"
She flips him off and Kaia, who's sitting next to her, bites her lip and smiles. When Kaia notices him looking at her, she tenses up and her eyes widens for a second. Dean's heart clenches and he feels sick. She's scared of him, and she has every right to be. He put a fucking gun against her head the first time he met her. He storms off to the kitchen, downs two beers in quick succession and pops the cap off a third one. All these kids who never got a chance only because he was close enough to screw up their lives completely.
But, It wasn't supposed to end like this. For Dean to die immediately after they got their freedom. It wasn't

I just wanted to say thank you for all the appreciation I've got so far for this little story, it keeps me going <3
Sam's mouth slams shut and by the looks of it, he's fighting off a snarky remark. After a while, the silence becomes overbearing and Dean puts another tape in the deck. Metallica this time, it never fails to soothe him and he manages to get some sleep.
want the most?"
Sam was patient at first, sat by his side in bed and talked softly, helped him to the bathroom when Dean was too drunk to stand on his own two feet, and brought him water to dilute the alcohol in his bloodstream.
"I let you down," he sniffles and wipes his nose on his sleeve.
"Then don't. " Dean says, hoarsely.
The atmosphere in the room grows so thick Dean could probably slice through it with a knife. He curses himself over and over. Is there a spell to give him the ability to think before he speaks? Maybe he should call Rowena about that. On a more positive note though, the strained atmosphere solved the situation in his pants rather quickly.
"Stop accusing me of giving up! I'm just saying, if it

listen to it. Dean's heart rate speeds up and an unfamiliar feeling sets in his gut. But not in an uncomfortable way, no instead it feels like butterflies fluttering around. What has happened to him? He's become a goddamn sap.

"Are you alright?" And no, Dean's
, him staring at the ceiling of the guest room he stays in and drinking himself to sleep only to wake up screaming. Sam still hasn't reached out, but Dean has a feeling Jody has told him by now, otherwise there would be a nationwide search for him.
The tune of some horrible pop song disrupts his thoughts and Cas picks up his phone from the pocket of his jeans.
Sam groans and rubs his temples with his fingers, "he cut his finger while slicing apples, I wouldn't call that

on a hunt'," Jody rolls her eyes, "Alex is working and Patience is in school, so we have the house for ourselves, at least for now."
"Let me" Cas who apparently has been watching him from the kitchen doorway, walks up to him and grabs his hand.
"Well, either you do it, or I get one of them to do it," Dean gestures to the doorway, "and I trust you poking me with a needle more than I trust Claire doing it."
"Need help with that?"
many of them in Dean's opinion, but he's going to keep his mouth shut, they're here to help after all. The loud noises that follow from dozens of hunters being in the near vicinity of each other makes him jittery and in desperate need of a drink or five.
Fingers run through his hair and he meets Eileen's worried eyes. She sits down on his lap and he nuzzles his face in the crook of her neck.
needs something to take the edge off the massive chaos going on in his head. With a well-filled glass of whiskey, he heads back to Cas who is still on the couch, looking at something on his phone.
-" he sings quietly into soft disheveled hair. He repeats the song twice before Cas' body finally stills.
Nick opened a rift to The Empty, and Dean was too focused to drown in booze to even think of that. Now it's too late, the blood sigils on the wall are cleaned up and the blood on the jacket is dried and crumbling off.
__________
And that's fine, he shouldn't, because everyone Dean loves and cares about gets killed
. Dean can't do this again, have some of him and then lose him once again. Not when Dean finally has accepted the feelings he's tried so hard to ignore for years.
He can't stand losing anyone else. So it's not just the thought of his family going on hunts that scares the shit out of him, no, he's even scared of the most mundane stuff. What if Eileen doesn't notice oncoming traffic and gets hit by a car? What if Cas stops breathing in his sleep? What if Sam trips over a rock on his morning run and bashes his head open?
Dinner is a success. Even though there's no marshmallow fluff in the cheese sauce this time.
Everything turns into an awkward mess. Dean was not prepared for it to be about two gay cowboys, which turns out (
he gestures wildly towards the TV screen, "it just ain't my thing"
Cas ignores him, and he wraps his hand around Dean's wrist. Dean feels the familiar wave of heat flowing through his veins as Cas's grace heals him. The blister is gone in an instant, but Cas doesn't let go. Another pulse of warm energy and the dull ache in his bad knee goes away, then another one which melts the tension in his shoulders. Dean has to lean against the counter for support. It's like his nerve endings have caught on fire.
There's a noise behind him, someone is walking towards him. "Cas?" He whispers into the dark, raising the angel blade in his hand.
"It looks like you've dropped 20 pounds since I last saw you"
the world to him, but Dean can't burden Sam with this too. After all Sam has been through, he deserves peace.
It's been two weeks since Dean stepped into the rift and it sealed right behind him. Sam could probably count the hours of sleep he's gotten since then on one hand. He's a complete mess.
"You need to pull your head out of your ass and tell him, that's what you need to do."
Cas purses his lips, and crosses his arms but stays silent. Dean wipes his hand down over his face, why did he say
and no one else's. Dean's the reason Cas is dead,
"I remember it like it was yesterday. You coming through here," he gestures towards the door, "the lights exploding over your head. You scared the crap outta' me. You were intimidating back then, now weren't you?" He bumps his hip against Cas'.
The pages are black and thin. The letters almost seem luminescent, he's never seen anything like it. And he's seen a lot of weird books through the years.
Sam takes a shaky breath, "Ok, here we go then." The needle pierces through the skin right under his jaw. And Sam was not exaggerating, it
"I'm not giving up on him. If you want to,
But, maybe we have to accept there won't be. I'm not saying we shouldn't
"Leave, if you can't deal with it anymore, then fucking leave!" Dean yells with a broken voice. He doesn't recall getting up from the couch, but now he's standing leaned in over Sam with his fists curled up.
Dean's thoughts are an endless loop of self-hatred, shame and anger. He should leave. Except he has nowhere to go. Sam would probably beat the shit out of him if he waltzed back into the Bunker in the nearest future. Panic rises in his chest.
. They walk cautiously up to the library, guns raised and Sam's heart is hammering in his chest. The place is warded to the teeth, nothing should be able to get inside. Yet, here they are.
"I'm sorry" he signs, shame buzzing in his veins.
Dean's head is swimming, an endless loop of broken thoughts. Jack rescued him.
"No you're not. You still blame yourself for everything that has happened, and I know you still blame me, and I do too, I should have looked for you" Sam said. His voice dripped of guilt.
"You're ready for this?" Jody says and places her hand on Dean's back.
have peace again you son of a bitch."
"Thank you Jode's." His voice is hoarse and everything else he wants to say is lodged down his throat.
When the dishes are all done, they just stand side by side resting against the counter, Dean feels Jack's eyes burning holes in his skin. He wants a drink. No scratch that, he
He knocks once but doesn't wait for a reply before stepping in. When his eyes finally adapt to the darkness, he realizes the big bundle on the bed is Cas, hiding underneath a thick layer of blankets.
Dean swallows his disgust, "Bring me to Cas or I'll tear this whole place down and you'll
again. Well, as normal it can be in the life of a Winchester. Eileen decides to try and break the brothers by telling the dirtiest jokes she knows and Dean laughs for the first time in weeks. The guilt hits him immediately and it grows to a smoldering abyss in his abdomen.
"Dude, why don't you say something when you're hungry? You would starve to death without me."
"You weren't there."
The room is actually pretty nice for a random roadside motel. The carpet has no suspicious stains and it doesn't smell like mildew. The bed is placed right in the middle of the room, the beige bedspread matches the white floral patterned wallpaper.
"I tried to make him go back to you sooner you know, but he refused. I should have made him return to you. I'm sorry," Jack looks devastated, bottom lip trembling when Dean meets his gaze.
"Hey Dean? You there?" Sam said, waving his hand in front of Dean's face. "What?" Dean snapped out of his thoughts about Cas and looked at Sam. "I said, should we head out for breakfast?"
It's quiet.
"It sounds like you are having fun, are you being nice to Sam and Eileen? And you remember the rules, right Jack?"
"Guess again" a familiar voice says.
Icy water floods through Dean's veins. The thing is lying, of course Cas is here, he made a deal.
"Someone owed me one, so I decided to cash that favor now" She says and shrugs, Claire looking impressed at her.
' something in the line of
Sam purses his lips and says nothing. His shoulders drawn up and his hands clenched tight.
Dean moves his head and drives the needle deeper in his neck, "keep going" he hisses through gritted teeth. The pain surges through him once again and he bites the inside of his cheek until his mouth is filled with a metallic tang. It feels like this might actually kill him. And honestly speaking, he doesn't care. At least then he died trying to save Cas. These last few weeks have made something very clear, Dean doesn't know how to live without Cas. He doesn't
Dean tries to swallow the lump stuck in his windpipe, unsuccessfully. "C'mere," he gestures to Jack and wraps his arms around him, the lanky kid melts in his embrace.
"What does it say? Anything?" Dean rasps, desperation bleeding through the words. When she doesn't answer Dean starts to pace around the room until Jody puts a hand on his shoulder to keep him still.
"I just don't want you to think -"
and instead it was all over before it even started.
There's a rock face along the road and the thought of smashing right into it runs through his mind. Maybe the new Death will carry out Billie's threat of throwing him into the Empty. Then he could find Cas and figure the rest out from there. It's risky, and besides, Baby would turn into a pretzel and that's really an off-putting thought, even if he wouldn't be there to see the aftermath. There are better ways to end it after all.
The small flickering light from the rift dies out and Dean stares at the spot where it was not even four seconds ago. Okay. Breathe. He can deal with that problem later.
"So yes, I can keep you here. And I will, I will drown you in your worst memories forever. Goodnight Dean, sleep tight."
Sam opened his mouth to say something, but didn't seem to find the words. "Dean… maybe you need some time to adjust to being back."
"Dean… I'm so sorry."
"You looking for that angel of yours?" The man sneers, "I knew you would show up here and disturb my peace."
Dean faces his brother and throws his arms up in exasperation, "Sam look, I'm messed up, that can't possibly be news to you."
This is the resting place for demons and angels, how many of them are here because of Dean? He doesn't have a chance if they get a whiff of him and decide to get some revenge.
But I'm not. He belongs here."
Dean turns it off. Sam furrows his brows, "You okay?"
Dean breaks the glass in his hand and the water turns red.
"Where's Castiel?" Dean says, trying to keep his voice steady.
Things are getting kinda smutty in this chapter (:
"Cas…" he rasps between the sobs. "How could you? You fucking
She sits down with the girls and immediately seems to bond with Claire. Dean does not want to think about the trouble they can get themselves into together. But that will be a problem to deal with later.
The water pressure is terrible and the water heater sputters in an alarming manner every time he increases the heat. He tries to relax under the spray and groans. Ever since returning from The Empty, the pain in his already beat up body seems to have doubled. The four hour drive here seems to have left his shoulders in a constant tense state. Damn he's getting old. The water grows colder and he gets out, not wanting to face Cas' wrath if the warm water runs out.
He twists and turns in his sheets and he can't stop thinking about what Cas is doing right now. The guy doesn't sleep, so will he just stare at the wall the whole night? For a brief moment he considers asking Cas to spend the night in his room, because why not? Dean and Sam shared a room for fifteen-plus years, so if Cas and him spent

to live without Cas.
They finished their meal in silence, Dean didn't feel like small talking or making lame jokes. He was tired. Heading back to the bunker, they stopped to buy some groceries. Dean waited in the car, took out his phone and started writing a message to Cas. He wrote and erased, wrote and erased. "
Like that thought hasn't struck Dean a thousand times already. Dean relied on Jack, comforted himself with the knowledge that Jack wouldn't leave Cas behind. Now he's not so sure anymore.
. But if he doesn't think or talk about it, it never happened, right? Slowly wasting away in his pitch black room seems easier.
Dean swipes a shaking hand over his face and takes a deep breath. The air is crisp, the clouds grey and hangs low beneath the sky.
"I know. I won't be able to forgive him but he doesn't deserve to be stuck in that place. You have to get him back." She looks up at him, and she actually has tears in her eyes.
"I believe you, Dean."
"Oh, by the way, I think there's a case in Missouri. Seems to be a quick salt 'n burn, maybe we meet up and take care of it?" Sam says enthusiastically and the blood inside Dean's veins goes cold.
Dean takes a deep breath and starts over,"If I'm stuck there, don't try to get me back. Just let it be man, you got some good stuff going on here and I want you to have that, okay? You can do it without me," Dean says and gives his brother, what he hopes is, a reassuring smile.
_______________________
There's some references to underage sex work in this chapter, just a heads up <3
Being behind the wheel is a bad idea, but since Dean has a Ph.D in bad ideas, he doesn't care. The headlights from the passing cars make him see double, and he is exhausted. Falling asleep behind the wheel would be a first though. But since he's been sleeping less than two hours every night since Cas died, it wouldn't be a surprise.

A guilty look washes over Cas' face, "I never meant-"

"Hiya Sammy."
"I will, I'll do anything," Dean chokes out, trying to swallow past the lump in his throat.
Back in the bunker, Dean started to clean his guns. Taking them apart piece by piece. When all of his guns were practically shining, he started to make some rock salt shells for the shotguns, cause who knew, maybe the next case would be some vengeful spirit. He paid no attention to the fact that the trunk of the impala was full of every type of bullet they could possibly need for the next 3 years. He knew if he let himself relax for just a minute the flashbacks would return with full force. The images that haunted him both day and night. Being tortured in hell, not getting Cas out of purgatory, seeing Sam get stabbed to death by Jake, Bobby taking his last breath. It all seemed to have caught up with him. He felt like his chest was about to implode, like he had a nuclear bomb inside him about to go off.

"No, please," he whines.
When Cas releases the grip on his wrist, Dean's legs feel like they're made of Jell-O.
Miracle barks and runs towards the door, clearly hearing something Dean doesn't.
There's no response from Cas, Dean sighs, "You can talk to me, okay? I know I've been a dick, but I- I'm here, okay?"
"I'm sorry" Cas mumbles and Dean remembers he has to breathe or he will pass out.
. You're mother-henning, he needs to figure some stuff out himself."
alright. He forces himself to look away from Cas' protruding hip bones. How long has he been staring anyway? Probably much longer than what's appropriate. Dean can feel his ears heating up as he meets Cas' piercing gaze. "Uh-huh, yup, definitely," he says and he winces at how high-pitched his voice comes out.
to me?" Words are soaked in frustration and suppressed anger.
Cas eyes twinkle and he brushes his fingers over Dean's knuckles. "You did not think you deserved to be saved. You still don't. But saving you was one of the greatest moments of my existence. Saving you changed me."
"You know
"I'm not leaving! This is my home too!"
Krissy cocks her head and raises an eyebrow at him, "you don't?"
Cas' lips are soft against his and Cas moves his hand to run his thumb over Dean's cheekbone. Cas opens his mouth, an invitation for Dean to slowly brush his tongue against his. They kiss for what feels like an eternity, like the other one is air and they are both drowning. When they finally break apart Cas wipes the tears from Dean's cheek with his thumb and smiles.
"Did you miss him?" Jack asks and Dean focuses his gaze on the floor and nods, clenching his jaw tight.
Dean goes to get a drink, because he
I know its really really angsty and it will be for a while but our boys will get a happy ending I promise.
, I just, I dunno."
"I know you didn't wanna hurt her. C'mon now." He steps out of the car and the chilly breeze makes the hair of his neck stand up.
, Jodes. Cas would still be alive if it wasn't for me, the stupid bastard died trying to save me."
Tears trickle down Jack's cheeks in a steady flow, and Dean would rather face all the monsters in the entire world at once than have this sight seared into his brain.
There's a sniffle coming from underneath the blankets and Dean's mouth goes dry.
They had been living in the bunker for quite some time now. Dean loved having his own place, a room just for him. Something he never had his whole life. He had decorated the room in his own style, guns on the wall, pictures of mom, a few pictures of him and Sam through the years. Even a picture of Cas and and him, a picture Sam snapped of the two of them toasting at a bar a few years back. Smiling at each other.
Cas turns around and faces him, with eyes red and puffy from all the tears. They're so close, their noses are almost touching and Dean can feel the warmth of Cas' breath on his lips. He swallows hard, this is about a hundred miles outside of his comfort zone.
now, Cas kinda gave you a gift, so you will be able to live your life."
Cas hasn't been up yet. Dean snuck out of the room around 5 am, after staring at the sleeping Cas for hours. Like every other night, Cas had been haunted by nightmares, thrashing around in the sheets. Dean hadn't dared to touch him, even though he wanted nothing more than to thread his fingers through the dark hair resting on the pillow, or to softly press his lips on the worried crease between Cas' brows.
"Look Dean, I am
He watches all the hunters from where he stands, scattered around the bunker, drinking beer and going through tons of lore. He can't help but to feel guilty, they're all here because he screwed up his chance with getting Cas back.
close by. This place could be endless, an entire universe in itself. He's really looking for a specific needle in a stack of needles. Did he actually think this was going to work? That he could walk right in, pick up Cas and waltz right back out?
it hurts.
Castiel smiles, "Yes, very much. It was on the mixtape you gave me."
"If I don't come back from that place-"
Dean nods.
Jack's smile falters when he sees Dean's clenched jaw and furrowed brows.
"Boy, you're more demon than you are a human. Your soul is charred and flayed beyond belief, it's barely even there anymore. I
Sam drives them back to Kansas, since Dean's left eye is swollen shut. Robert Plant's voice rumbles through the speakers.
Sam has texted him four times since he ran off. The first are written in outrage, accusing Dean of being a coward and running away just like their dad. But the last two are apologetic and he can tell Sam is worried. Instead of answering, he turns his phone off and shoves it into the glove compartment. It's childish, but he needs time away from his brother. Sam means the world to him, hell, he
puts the weight of the whole fucking world on his shoulders. "Then Amara thanked me for giving her what she wanted the most, and said she would give me the same thing."
"I have always wanted you, Dean." All the walls Dean has built around himself shatter and crumble to dust. He leans in and presses his lips against Cas'.

Jody leaves with that, and the house is so quiet and empty it makes Dean's skin crawl. Deep down, he knows Jody is right, he needs to keep living. But he doesn't want to, that's the thing.
"I took Miracle for a walk, and he tried to befriend a raccoon, but he got beat up by it instead, you should've seen it."
"Sam, listen to me-" He doesn't get to finish that sentence and both of them turn to look towards the door.
"S'nothing, the easiest food on the planet."

for help with cooking, that's the day you should take me out back and put me out of my misery," Dean grumbles, "but you can make some of that rabbit food you like, 'cause I ain't touching that shit."
Hi guys! I'm so so happy for all the feedback you keep giving me, it keeps me going! I really struggled with this chapter though, but thanks to B (anotherxfangirl) and her amazing input i managed to get it done, so.. enjoy!
Dean, on the other hand, is barely holding together with spit and glue. A while back, he walked in on Sam and Eileen checking out apartments up for rent on Sam's laptop. This led to him going on a bender across the state, stopping at every shady dive bar he could find. The only thing he remembers is waking up in a drunk tank in Concordia, wearing someone else's clothes and vomit all over his shoes.
"So you lost your wee angel? That's too bad," Rowena cocks her head but Dean doesn't respond. "Did you at least fix the rift between the two of you like I told you?"
"Why would you do that? My name is Jack."
Dean takes a deep breath, braces for impact, ready to flee right back out of the door if needed to. His tongue is stuck to his soft palate, it feels impossible to say even the simplest of words. Then Sam turns around and meets his eyes.
Cas rolls his eyes and sits down on the opposite side of the map table.
They settle down on the couch with the bowl of popcorn in between them. It's Cas's turn to pick a movie, and Dean already knows he's going to hate it.
"Y'know, what happened to your family, he never got over that. He hated himself for it."
It's in Latin. Dean recognizes about two words on the pages and he doesn't even know what they mean. Great.
This has become a regular thing, Cas going batshit crazy whenever Dean tells him to be careful. It's not Dean's fault the guy seems to have a death wish. First it was the broken toe (that healed rather quickly thanks to Dean's meticulous care, thankyouverymuch), then he slipped in the shower and got a nasty bruise over his ribs. And now he nearly cut his finger off. So sue him for looking out for the man.
"Sorry 'bout the -"
"Dean," Cas' tone is grave.
"Sam, I'm
Jody hugs him tight, "You're going to find a way to get him back,
Dean's throat ties itself together and he gets thrown back to the moment before The Empty appeared.
dude"
Despite all the pain of hearing the voice of his best friend, it comforts him. There are tiny fragments of Cas left that will never fade. Dean places his hand on his shoulder, it's like an instinct. The bright red scar faded years ago, now it's barely visible. But it is there, the calloused elevation of his skin, perfectly molded after Castiel's hand.
"I should probably stay here. It hurts when I walk," Cas pouts. Dean has to fight hard to avoid rolling his eyes, sure getting used to real pain must suck, but
"I was just asking about how you two were doing."
"We took down Chuck, it's over, all of it." Dean talks slowly, can't find the words to describe what's
"That's what you said when I saw you in the Empty too."
He hears footsteps approaching and he gestures the direction it's coming from to Eileen. They cock their guns, both with their eyes dead set on the doorway leading to the kitchen.

This was the moment when their lives were supposed to
"What's going on?" Eileen signs, walking in from the war room, a duffel bag hanging over her shoulder.
Sam practically beams as he runs between the groupings of hunters, giving directions, handing out more books and rambling about lore to everyone who will listen. The same way he did with all of the hunters who escaped from the apocalyptic world. He's good at this.
The five hour drive back to home is over in an instant. Dean has no idea how he got back, his brain shut off the moment he waved at Jody on the driveway. He parks Baby inside the garage and walks in with heavy steps, heart thumping inside his chest.
The tune of Thank You fades out and Dean lets go of Cas' hand to lower the volume. "How about we find a place to catch a few Z's? I'm beat." Cas yawns and nods.
quiet. Since the Kitsune case, there's barely been a single article indicating some kind of monster activity. Only a possible salt-and-burn, which wasn't worth the four day drive when there's other hunters out there who could take care of it.

Jack reaches out and wraps his arms around Dean's waist. "I can and I do," he mumbles into Dean's flannel. Dean doesn't answer, he just holds him tight and doesn't even fight the tears rolling down his cheeks.
"Okay so here's something, I think,

hate him. But now that he's gone… I kinda want him back." Claire mumbles between the sips, her eyes fixated on something across the room.
They keep tip-toeing around each other, like a slowdance on eggshells and shards of glass.
Baby takes him north, out on highway 281. For a brief moment he considers turning off his phones, making it harder for Sam to track his location. But fuck it, Sam is probably happy Dean is out of the bunker. Walking out on his brother, something he never thought he would do, but here he is. Acting just like his dad.
Dean shrugs, "It's five o'clock somewhere."
He pulls over for gas in Silver creek. There's a liquor store next to it and temptation wins. He heads back to the car with three bottles of Jack and a beer case. Enough to make it through a couple of days at least. The booze leaves a trail of soothing fire down his throat.
After emptying the chamber of his 1911 twice in the target's head, he slumps down against the wall, feeling numb. If only talking was as easy as yelling. If love was as easy as anger. He stares at his calloused hands, so much blood and pain they have caused. They are not meant to be used for gentle touches and loving actions. They are molded to hold the grip of a gun and to bring pain and mayhem. That's what he does. That's who he is.
"Look, that means jack-squat right now if we can't get up to seventh heaven without Meta-troll finding out," Dean reminded Castiel, looking into the words. Knowing Dean, it would take concrete proof before he even thought about himself being the man of the prophecy.
While working on this someone asked me, well isn't Heaven really just a bunch of memories in Supernatural? Which is really where the world building comes in. What is explicitly stated in Supernatural is that there is no single Heaven. Cas says that each soul generates its own Heaven. (
By the time Dean finishes with the hooves, Alfie moves to clean the horse trough. He’s looking at Dean intermittently when he thinks Dean isn’t looking, worries his bottom lip by biting it.
Outside, Dean opened Baby’s hood and stared blankly into her engine block. The smell of motor oil and grease reminded him of work back home, and he lost himself in its familiarity.
"If you mean 'is the Tree still dropping bright comets of flowers into a great waterfall and being a blindingly twinkling Christmas tree,' then yes, you're still good."
They’d grown up, Sam didn’t need minding anymore, and they weren’t exactly living hand-to-mouth.  Winchester Motors was a government contractor with businesses all over Stava. They mined their own aquacasite and built it in-house—or rather, in-ship.
“What do you mean you’re taking this trip for me?” Sam shifted in the chair and placed his elbows on his knees, his chin rested on his palms. “We went to the US because Dad ordered you to marry someone you didn’t know.”
Castiel frowns, aligning his grace with the time and noting that it is almost 5 o’clock. “Do you want to continue, Jack?”
Because Castiel was raised in an angel garrison, the order gave him comfort, and rituals gave him structure. He hadn't stepped foot in his Father's house in ages, but he did find comfort in the fact that in this bench, in this field, he found the peace that he could not receive with his Father's blessing.
Sam and Eileen insisted on taking Jack to the zoo in Topeka after they watched Madagascar 2 during their last movie night and he desperately wanted to see a real life zebra.
"You'll see," Dean smirks and his stomach flutters. When he woke up this morning, his head resting on Cas' chest, it all clicked into place. Maybe it had been a subconscious decision when they first left for their little road trip, because why the hell were they even going east to begin with? But now he knew exactly where they were supposed to go.

When he goes to bed that night, he does so with the green jacket next to him. With his hand wrapped around the bloody handprint.

He has put a gun against his head, and not just once. He tried to bury him alive in a box for fucks sake.
Cas adjusts himself on the couch, ending up really close to Dean, their thighs are brushing against each other, and Dean holds his breath. Jesus christ, he's a soon to be forty year old man and he's acting like a teenager on prom night.
Alicia, Max and Sam snaps to attention, gathering closer around the book. If someone had told Dean ten years ago his brother would practically be a witch, he'd probably laughed in their face. But here he is, the wicked witch of Kansas. The Sam-witch.

Jody puts her arms around him and he exhales, allowing the tears to fall. It's a quiet whimpering type of cry, and he tangles his hands into Jody's shirt like a small child seeking consolation, not a forty year old man. She holds him tight, and when he tries to wriggle away, she holds him even tighter.
Cas puts his hand on Dean's arm and squeezes it lightly, "It is okay to want things for yourself too"
