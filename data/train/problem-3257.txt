"Hello Charlie," Castiel said with a nod of his head, biting his lip as he hoped they would go easy on him.
Anyways, Castiel did not tell Meg simply because he knew it was not important for her to know the insults Crowley had thrown at Dean, it was none of her business. It wasn't even his business really, Cas only heard it because he was there. This meant Dean had not told Castiel but he was not offended in the slightest, he understood the feeling to hide your family's business away from others.
Castiel nodded sadly, wanting to take the creature home. Just then another guinea pig stuck his head up from the hay, running to the glass' edge to see the other animal. The lonely pet raised his head, shuffling to the edge of his cage to see the lighter guinea pig.
“If it appeases your recreational bravado, you may win,” Castiel offered, hoping to fix a problem before it started.
"Well... It's just, I don't really like the attention they bring is all. I don't like being singled out, Cas."
She smiled once more, the poisonous expression spreading like a disease across her cold skin, "Yes, I suppose we do."
Azazel had left the gun, oh no, they were firing at the wall- Cas closed his eyes, praying he would not be discovered.
"Listen here Sam, I work my ass off so you can keep clothes on your back and I'm working my ass off to find your brother! So shut your damn mouth because this is the way it has to be!"
Castiel's unease dematerialized as fear overtook him, knowing Zachariah's true question, "Well, sir."
Kissing Meg was okay, kissing was fine. As long as no one ever found out- as long as neither ever told anyone. The man had never kissed Castiel's lips, because why would he want to dirty his lips with something so bad?
Alright was the farthest thing from what Cas was. Dean just wanted to help, but would Cas ever tell him anything? No. They'd known each other for seven months, and Dean still knew next to nothing about Cas' family.
Luckily, the only one home was Anna and she had been worried about him- but not angry, asking him to tell her if he planned on staying over at Dean's house. Cas had been pretty surprised by that, if his reaction was anything to go by, since apparently he thought Anna would be mad. Now Dean knew Anna didn't mind though, and if asshole Zach wasn't here he'd use that to his advantage and have Cas over.
"Stop that," Cas said, eyes cast down in shame. "Pl...please stop, I'll-I'll listen to what you have to say, jus-just stop repeating him."
He was not the same around crowds of people, and Castiel could not understand why his behavior changed with the number of teenagers in a room. He could not explain the rise and fall of Dean’s bright grin or why his green eyes flickered from face to face within the high school’s walls.
It seemed he was more speaking to himself, as if coming to some incredible realization. Cassie's blue eyes returned to his drink, his eyes wide and unmoving. Gabriel took a step towards the dark counter, frowning with confusion.
Dean was basically being foster care, the very thing the two worked so hard to fight against- not that they'd ever had any real experience with one, but it was an unspoken predicament both boys made sure they would never have to deal with. When John called to tell Dean he was coming to visit, Dean said nothing of it and had in fact hidden it very well- but Dean couldn't really get Sam out of the house for a few days without raising suspicion.
"Ugh, this is ridiculous that I'm saying any of this. But... I don't know, he's just being... him, I guess. Which is great! I like him. He's just... sometimes he gets like this, he'll distance himself from me. He’s barely talked to me since he went all The Incredible Hulk on Crowley. That was two days ago, guy won’t talk to me, and I don't know why. Maybe it's cause I'm too much if a bother to be friends with, I don't know."
Dean listened to their dad, he followed him around- what would Dean say if Sam didn't want to be a cop, didn't want to serve in the marines? That wasn't Sam! He could never be a strong, brave solider like John wanted him to be.
This was the first time Cas had really smiled around Dean, not shy or a ducked head, but an honest, sweet, open smile. And Dean thought it was a nice smile, hell, it was cute. The blue eyed boy before him looked like a child on Christmas; he was a proud, happy smile and a sweet voice. It was so odd to see on Castiel, and Dean welcomed it, imagining how rare an honest smile was from this kid. And he'd said neat,
Crowley frowned, "Y'know, if I was really the bad guy- I'd stick around and let them see me, and then make you to lie them even more."
Sam rolled his eyes, before pausing, and looking at Dean with a smirk, "So uh, why'd you ask me to tag along Dean?"
Lucifer frowned, staring at his little brother, "Don't you see, Castiel? They will always protect you. Naomi perhaps was too cold to do so, and Michael always kept himself busy- but for how long, how long did they take you somewhere else as a child? How often did they bug you to go outside, and then they played with you?"
Dean wanted to Castiel to feel at home, with him. He wanted Castiel to be a part of Dean's life, and Castiel wanted Dean to be a part of his. Anna smiled at him.
The phone call ended abruptly as Dean heard his father hang up. Dean rested his head in his hands before pulling himself up and staring at the phone in his hands, a shaky sigh escaping his tense body. His mom's anniversary was coming up, and he knew his father was more on edge than usual- which was saying a lot.
As he walked up he heard the banter continuing, "so you agree, your generation is immature." "No, I agree you're immature." Castiel looked around, seeing an old wooden rocking chair piled up in the back, surrounded by faded cardboard boxes. He walked up to the chair, and saw a box marked 'Dad's Stuff' and another 'Mom's Stuff' followed by a box for each of his siblings.
“That it’s under appreciated by children of this day who have their parents waste their income on electronics that will indelibly break after rotting their brains?” Castiel offered. “Oh, right foot blue.
He shrugged, "Alright. Man, you make it sound like you're going against the mafia or something, do you mind if I ask- who all is in your family? Unless that's touchy or some shit, 'm just curious."
Cas laughed darkly, before staring at Naomi, nodding with a somewhat concerning smile. His cold, dark blue eyes shone with unabashed darkness as he smirked at his sister.
Cas who hid all traces of a smile when he was nervous, who pushed people away if he became too nervous. Cas who drove a shitty car he didn't own. Cas who had a panic attack when he thought his sister was dead. Cas who hugged Anna for an hour after she was found.
Cas looked at her wearily, "Anna. I don't need help. I don't need anyone's help- it's appreciated, but unnecessary."
He tilted his head as his brow furrowed, and his eyes darted over to Dean, questioning what this was.
to make your own breakfast this morning? The answer to both, is no. But since it’s no, the other had to help out." He held up his pencil, standing to his feet,"
When Castiel was younger his room was a combination of hand me downs and cheap furniture. The crowded, chaotic room was a mix of browns, dark blues, mustard yellows, fading reds, blacks, and fungus greens. The youngest Novak, Hael, shared a room with Anna. Before the Novak’s knew what autism was they had placated to whatever Castiel wanted, or what they thought Castiel wanted.
"Right, um, well I just… I thought someone should offer you, y’know, driving lessons… Um, I could take you if you wanted."
"Anna, your word means nothing in this house- least of all when speaking of those who don't belong, we both know you're only too eager to prove outcasts fit in here."
John didn't really know how to watch Sam. Whenever he tried Sam would sneer at him, or quietly glare. This only angered John further. The yelling would then start all over again.
Dean laughed, even though he could barely remember which Christmas movie that was from, only that it was. John hadn't ever celebrated Christmas very much with them, but Bobby had put in a film or two for them when John dropped them off.
Castiel?" Naomi hissed, "Do you need to interrupt me so you can cry to Anna? Were grades posted and you got a B? Was a girl called out for being a whore? Was an atheist told they were going to Hell? Did a gay boy cry? What happened in your sad little world now? Because I really don't give a flying
"There could be a three hour battle without a single causality, both sides coming to a peaceful agreement and she'd wax poems about 'love in war.'"
"Yeah, I-I think so. I mean, not that I'm a jerk or anything- I didn't mean I was unsure like it was unknown- I just... Well we haven't talked in a few days, and I'm worried about him."
Cas nodded, sitting at the empty seat next to Dean. His lips lifted briefly before falling, though it wasn't as fake as it had once been. Sam smiled at the exchange, pulling out the other seat besides the two males.
He was ignored by a screaming Naomi. Gabriel threw his hands up into the air, excusing himself to call Michael. They'd listen to him, if he was ever around.
"Well, I wouldn't want you to be bored. I guess I'll just have to go get him," Dean said with a smile.
She spoke calmly, careful not to upset him lest he misinterpret her comment. "It looks like this runs deeper than frustration, Castiel."
Cas’ unblinking eyes reflected Dean’s pink cheeks. Dean blushed deeper, self conscious as he felt the warmth spread across his skin. He raised a hand to rub his face.
"I don't know we had a good thing going!" She raised her hands to her face, "This is so embarrassing I'm sorry."
"This the one, kid?" Bobby said with a raise of his eyebrows, another mannerism of Bobby's that reminded Cas greatly of Dean.
“What is he going do when he’s an adult, Anna? He can’t be a kid forever,” his mother huffed. “One day he’ll have to grow up.”
He had nodded then, but he still felt bad for not helping. He only wanted to do the right thing, but he was stuck between which was more important. Castiel felt the least he could do was not bother her when she cooked.
"As lovely as it is to hear society stirring insecurity in a young woman, why are you speaking of this?"
The dress shirt he wore was white, cotton. It was soft and buttoned. The soft breeze against his hands was comforting.
Their cracked, old phone's ringing was enough to distract him from further Cas related thoughts. No one ever called the home phone. He stood from his chair and walked towards the kitchen.
"Exactly! Most people truly aren't cruel at heart, and I believe that society is often too keen to apply that description to others. People can be mean, very mean- but I do believe most people are not 'evil' as some are so eager to exclaim. There are various reasons the actions of those around us."
What could Castiel give Dean which he was truly passionate about? Yet still minuscule? Castiel wanted to present the young man with a present that would show the depth of their friendship, to show how much he knew of him and how he cared for him.
Sixth hour had never been very entertaining to Castiel, not that he had anything against Spanish, and it was an interesting language to learn. Rather, his class was contaminated with obnoxious students. It did not help the class’s maturity, when the teacher announced she had to go off and make a few copies and to behave. Naturally, everyone broke out into dialogues even more odious than before.
WARNINGS: Mr. Novak is not a good dad, there is no physical abuse in this chapter from Mr. Novak, but this may be triggering. Castiel is shown to be quite scared of his father.
Sam had glared at him, biting his trembling lip, "You clothe me? What, do you watch me too? Put me to bed? Steal food for me so I can eat? Try and sew my clothes? Patch me up if I'm hurt? Take care of me?!"
The class was silent for once, Ruby smirking as Mr. Hadlum held out his hand, accepting the office's papers. She smiled, lip pulling up as if a hook was caught in her face. She looked over at Sam, raising her eyebrows.
Dean smiled, Cas wasn't offended, he thought it was funny! Cas wasn't annoyed, he was laughing, he had finally understood most of Dean's life was filled with him being a goofy, dumbass and not some strange, weird ass-
Zeppie raised his head, staring at Sam's sudden unhappiness as if he was responsible. The German shepherd ducked his head. Sam rubbed behind his brown ears and smiled before shooting Dean a
Cas shook his head, glad he'd only been able to cry for a few minutes- God this was so embarrassing, why was he always so embarrassing? Could Dean and Meg not have one night which didn't require them tending to his problems?
"Hey, you two idjit a quit giggling like a bunch of schoolgirls and get up here!" Bobby shouted from his porch.
"No she was stumbling around and laughing about everything," Lisa said, brown eyes flickering from face to face of her gathered crowd.
Cas isn’t sure how to voice this, but he sees the telltale shaking of Dean’s shoulders. He raises his arms to give Dean a hug when his brain feels suddenly staticky. No, that’s a poor choice of words. He feels… like lint shoved inside of the dryer. Gabriel found lint stuck inside of their dryer once. It was a long, messy rectangle of gray and lose fabric. Naomi had complained about it being fire hazard, her hands resting on her small hips as she’d yelled. Anna had rushed into fix things while Gabriel joked about the unlikeliness of a house catching fire over some lint.
The body hit the floor, "I misunderstood what a miserable creature you were," Crowley said with a frown.
She shook her head, walking over to her brother, "You don't have to be sorry Castiel, it's a nice gesture- but like you, I am capable of paying for my own gas."
Dean had never stayed in a city for any longer than a month. Of course, his dad had usually been home for the weekends so it wasn't as if he never saw him. Dean tried not to ask, he knew it wasn't any of his business what his father was doing.
She nodded, smiling as she stood from the seat at Castiel’ desk. “Right, because Michael’s craft store is very mature.”
Wow, that was stupid of him. Why did he try and talk with Sam about anything? He just started thinking of when the preacher would- no, when he made the preacher, because he was bad. Of course.
So he no longer spoke of what happened, and when it happened again and again and again, Castiel never told anyone. How could he? What good would it do? His family would only hate him more, Naomi would only yell at him more, he would only burden Anna further, stress Michael more, disrupt Gabriel's happy life again, and cause Lucifer too leave more often- what positives could honesty possibly offer Castiel and his family?
He didn't mean to cry, but the tears were suddenly streaking his cheeks, and he was reminded of younger days when Naomi would corner him in the kitchen and yell at him for how much of a burden he was, and how everyone hated him.
Sam smiled, “Well, uh, I’ll you get back to your locker then, I guess. It was nice to meet you, Castiel.”
Michael’s dark eyes flicked briefly to Gabriel and back to his youngest brother, “Would you like some help, Castiel?”
His green eyes flickered over to the paper beneath Castiel’s hand. The silver pencil rested between Cas’ long fingers, small dashes dancing from beneath his grip and onto the page.
Castiel sighed, breath rattling his chest while he lowered his face. His arm was perched on the dark chair and rose to cover his blotchy face. The room had been filled with stifling cries and wet words of pain, now it was as silent as a graveyard.
but… no, if we’re doing the pet names-” Dean raised his eyebrows, mouth pulling to the side with a grimace, “
"Thank you for your support Dean, truly, but as you once told me- I really can't take any more positive reenforcement right now. The police refuse to put a warrant and we cannot find Anna anywhere, I truly cannot see this positively at the moment. I do appreciate your sentiment, but may we discuss something else for the time being?"
As the two boys continued speaking at Castiel's locker, someone approached them. Crowley. Castiel's tranquil expression easily slipped into a glare. Something Dean thought both strange and curious, Dean had never spoken with Crowley before, but from what Cas had said of him, he was kind of a douche.
A sharp knock on Castiel’s door pulled him from his fear. Anna Novak stood in his doorway, soft smile brightening her face. Her hand moved from her jacket’s right pocket and she shook a ring of shiny sounds, her keys.
In fact, as the bell rang Dean began teasing him once more about his sedulous studying. The two friends left the library, the chatter of other students following them as they both turned on another hallway, approaching their lockers for their second to last class.
When the boy walked into the long room, with four large fold up tables placed in two rows he was greeted by a face he had not noticed yesterday, Dean. It would make sense, Mr. McCoy was a more relaxed teacher and thought introductions awkward, and always asked the student if they wanted one instead of forcing them to stand up awkwardly in front of the class and speaking.
Truly it was rather irritating to Castiel to never understand what those around him were speaking of. Meg spoke of many different movies and tv shows, or music, or books which he had never read- of course, this was not Meg's intention, simply that Castiel was almost alien to pop culture references. Except for those regarding The Beatles, of course.
"He's not getting ready, he's cleaning the room he shares with three boys, doing laundry, cleaning the bathrooms, and any other cleaning he can think of at the moment," she said coldly as she stood from her bed.
Cas bit his lip, most people didn't deserve the cruel punishments they were given from religion. Well, really almost all, no one deserved that. Except him. Th preacher was helping him.
His green eyes looked so thin, lost within the lopsided smile he wore. Dean sighed, flipping a page in the book he was not reading. Castiel frowned, following his white fingertips.
"Well I kill for all my friends," he said calmly, he gestured to the man on the ground, "you and I have only just met you see so I merely shot him in the leg." He frowned, considering the situation, "A lot could come from a leg shot, there's a potential for acquaintanceship. I killed six men for your brother, but don't be jealous things can change."
Really, that wasn't that long a time in the grand scheme of things- and yet, now he couldn't picture his life without Cas. Wow, that was a stupid thing to think, after the crap he and Cas had said, the guy was probably pissed at him and wouldn't want to talk to him. God, he needed to find him.
Castiel looked at her, “No, no I do not wish to learn how to drive. I- does this cause you anguish? If that is so I could wa- um… I could find another way to get to school.”
Cas frowned, Dean would not be happy with him divulging information of his emotional stability without his knowledge, "N-no."
Anna sighed once more, turning back to the window with her arms crossed, "I want him to be okay, Gabriel. I want him to be happy."
Castiel nodded, silent as he wiped his runny nose. Anna looked at him regretfully, before hurrying down the stairs to answer the door.
"Then again, it's always the little things that matter, isn't it Dean?" he said with a frown. "Like your little brother, Sam- who I don't like. That's not a good thing for you Dean. You don't have that much family, and one of my personal acquaintances just happens to share a class with your little baby brother. Don't worry Ruby has no reason yet to become involved."
She gave Cas a soft look, "You as well, Castiel. Do you value your time? Dean you said you have a job and you're both in school, you must have some kind of schedule."
They kissed, and it was great! Honestly, he thought he'd never work up the nerves to kiss Cas- and then he had! It had been so great, kissing Cas- he was soft, and sweet, and subtle.
to delay Sam going to school, as if his schooling was more important than Dean's own life, and going to the hospital would be a burden.
He frowned, "I should hope not. Besides, there is the obvious problem that I do not have two X-chromosomes."
Misty blue eyes looked down at Anna, "you have to understand, I was a mess- I was awful, and I should have told you but I didn't want to upse- I-I'm sorry, I just..." Cas sighed, looking at the ground, "I couldn't face you."
Cas frowned, but followed Dean over to the DJ- Ellen loved to celebrate New Years Eve- and tapped his shoulder. Dean looked back at Cas before asking him to wait a moment, whispering something to the DJ who nodded.
Dean had only known Cas for a day, and he wasn’t Vivian Sanders, his life hadn’t changed when he’d seen the blue eyed teen. But he was interesting, and from what little Dean had seen of the guy- he didn’t seem to smile a lot. Some chick had been trying to get Cas’ attention in homeroom and he hadn’t seem interested in her, why was he interested in Dean?
He sighed, there was no going back now. Castiel would have to tell Dean, and then he could only hope Dean wouldn't toss him asi-
Messing with Sam was always fun. The kid was a natural uptight nerd, but that week had been hilarious. Sam’s horrified, oily mug reflected in their bedroom’s cracked mirror, making the place even uglier than usual.
Sam raised his eyebrows ever so slightly, his big brown eyes staring back, "I mean, it's not like I have a set on opinion on every day of the week, but Thursday's okay."
She smirked, "Crowley, you can try and outrun me- but we both know you can't. You can't escape me, you can't escape Lucifer, you can't escape Abaddon."
Joe Kidd was everything Dean knew him to be: daring, adventurous, badass, and totally awesome. When the movie finished, Cas was watching the screen with a please look on his face- thanking Dean for watching it with him. Dean only smiled, saying it was his idea in the first place.
"I may be helping you," Cas growled, resting the chair on the floor, "but you will not speak of a Meg Masters in a such way when I am present, regardless of my position."
Cas wouldn't lose her, not after everything that had happened- Castiel wouldn't lose Anna, he couldn't. She was too nice, she was too sweet, she was too good a friend, she was too great a sister she was too- she was too... she couldn't be gone.
"You know what Sam, I'm tired of this!" John shouted, throwing his glass down. "This disrespect is unacceptable!"
"You look exhausted man," he said while guiding Cas to the couch, apologies hidden behind Dean's tongue.
Cas really had come a long way, even though they'd only had three or four lessons to go off of, he'd shown some serious progress. As his boyfriend (honestly, it still made Dean giddy to say) continued to drive, he stuck out the tip of tongue, narrowing his eyes. A small, smug smile slowly spread across his face as he gently pressed down further on the pedal.
She raised her eyebrows, looking at her brothers before returning to Dean, "And yet you're here working with us."
Maybe Dean didn’t know everyone in the school, but he made sure to introduce Cas to all of his friends. After all Cas livened up every conversation. Although, Dean’s favorite Castiel conversations were between Cas and himself.
Dean, Sam, and Cas arrive home. Sam goes for a walk. Anna and Gabriel wait for Cas to return. Dean and Cas talk.
Dean frowned, Crowley's explanation had been brief, why had he killed people? Just because he was Crowley? Were they past enemies? Had something happened? What had they done to ask for it? Had they kidnapped Cas?
Course, Lilly Anders was a mystery case- never had found the girl, something that still threatened to send Bobby to cahoots. But nah- that kind of talk was for John, god knows they didn't need any more workaholics who blurred the line between their personal life and work life. Lucky for Bobby, he didn't have any kids lives to ruin- course, that meant he didn't have any brats to watch grow up.
His blue eyes darkened to a stormy navy blue, and his frown was present once more, though it seemed to appear as more of an apoplectic frown than his typical, confused frown.
Dean shook his head, "Cas man, ya gotta focus on something else. What d'ya wanna do? Anything. You wanna drive somewhere? We can. You wanna watch tv? We can. You wanna listen to music? We can do that too, whatever you want man."
She raised an eyebrow, "Too cold again? Clarence you're a good guy and all, but ya gotta work on that."
, she should have left a long time ago but she didn't- you know what though? I don't care that she's gone!"
Castiel frowned, brow furrowing as he considered this. His gaze rested on Gabriel before dropping to the ground. He smiled with something between embarrassment and guilt. Gabe frowned at the movement before Castiel spoke sheepishly.
Castiel frowned, staring down at his swirling dark beverage. "You were going to say something else and stopped. Why?"
Castiel could not help but think in that moment the accusations of denial he would have been accused of had Naomi been there, or the irritation of Michael for speaking with someone who cursed. The endless taunts and teases of Lucifer for attempting to make friends also rang in his ear.
Dean considers this a tad annoying really; he wishes his friend would just relax once in a while. But whatever, he and Cas still have a good time together, and that's what's important. Another thing that puzzled Dean about this friendship, was how long it was looking to last. Dean wasn't gonna lie, it'd been three months, and he'd expected to have left by now. This was the longest he and Sam had ever stayed somewhere, and he wasn't sure if that was a good thing, or a bad thing.
"I am truly sorry I am not as talented as you are Dean Winchester, however, not everyone is as capable on the dance floor as you."
So when Cas wasn't in school on Monday and Dean was worried, he had to remind himself to calm down. It wasn't that Dean nervous or anything, it's just he hadn't spoken with Cas since Tuesday, and that had really only been long enough to see Cas looking upset and walk away.
Castiel frowned, "Dean, for someone who claims to know so much about me as we are close friends- you have a lot of trouble with remembering my name."
"He's almost home," Sam said happily, "just wait. Oh, this is gonna be great, Dean never lets anybody really celebrate- so this gets to make up for all past refusals."
No one would ever... God, he'd let Cas suffer- why didn't he try harder to find out? Why didn't he stop him from meeting with Crowley? Why didn't he do anything?
Castiel bit his lip upon seeing his brother, "Gabriel, would you mind if Dean and I went for a driving lesson?"
Lilith huffed out another laugh, holding her side, "Know my limits?! We have no limits! We're taking over the world! We're going to make your life a living hell, Crowley. We're going to rip everything away from you. Everything you love? We're going to burn it all to the ground."
Sam raised his eyebrows, knowing he could say something, but said nothing. He shook his head before Dean grabbed his keys off his bed, waving for Sam to follow him.
"Hey Cas?" Dean asked nonchalantly, "I'm willing to bet your legs are kinda tired- what do you wanna do now?"
Do you train your children and watch them, never letting them make friends so they won't be hurt? Or do you not train them? Do you keep them by your side and lie, and put them in harm’s way because of their ignorance, and innocence? John Winchester didn't know what was correct, and he did the best he could because he thought it was right.
Dean sighed as his brother walked away, turning back to his boyfriend. He held his tan hand out to the pale, which was shakingly accepted. Dean's worried frown softened when Cas took his hand, and allowed Dean to help him to stand on his shaky legs.
"Cas," Dean said softly, "I felt awful just watching you. So I'll tell you and stop this really awkward attempt at a confession of yours- I... Heh, now I'm awkwardly confessing- I like you. A lot. I really like you, I've been trying to work up the nerve to ask you out for a while now. I don't care if you don't think you're normal because I'm the farthest thing from normal here. But I like you- and I don't care if you want to do that. I really like you."
Cas frowned, brow furrowing as he thought. Dean smiled, admiring his expressions- he still loved to count them, and he'd found their number had grown over time. Sometimes for good reasons, sometimes for bad- but Cas was always fascinating to look at, and had only grown to be more so for Dean as time had gone by.
"You don't know a thing about love, you've spent most of your life pushing people away and arguing and making sure to please dad but guess what? It still didn't matter. Everything you did? It didn't matter! I guess you're a real
He grinned, sticking his hands out in front of him. "'Yes, hello, 16 year old virgin child! Yes, I'd like you to give birth to the next god."
"I'm...sorry?" He smiled brightly. "Personally, I think my specialty lies with white lies. I mean, it's in the name. You think little 'angel Gabriel, messenger of Heaven' didn't tell a white lie now and again, make things sound better than they were?"
Castiel laughed the car sitting in front of the school as the two siblings guffawed. Tears were streaming down his face, but Castiel didn't pause to wipe them, too busy laughing. When their laughter had subsided to the point where Castiel could breathe, he opened his door.
However, Castiel had stopped giving anyone the satisfaction of knowing his emotions a long time ago. He included. He was determined not to show weakness in front of her, instead he opted for his usual routine- cold eyes, frown, and enough internal damage for this household. So he did what he always did when he was upset and at home (which he almost always was). He turned on The Beatles, and endured the weekend- hoping his music wouldn't bother his brothers.
"Mr. Winchester," the teacher spoke sternly, moving from his podium. "You will not receive extra points for reading ahead or revealing the ending to those who have not."
But Cas doesn't celebrate Halloween. Doesn't carve pumpkins or go out for candy. Never went around his neighborhood after bedtime, never got dressed up in stupid shitty costumes. And if that isn't fucking disappointing (well, there are worst disappointments in life, Dean knows) he doesn't know what is.
He frowned, "Should I? Unless our mother possessed telepathic abilities I cannot imagine either of knowing what the other thinks."
The red head was flitting around the kid like a red eyed fly. An old woman hurried past them, her face bent into something spiteful as she whispered to her husband.
"I am not being ridiculous Dean- I don't understand your need for their to be something wrong, do you revel in chaos? Do you need something to be wrong at all times?"
Gabriel and Castiel discuss Dean. Sam and Dean discuss Cas and play with Zeppie. Sam has something he wants to tell Dean, but does know how. Castiel has something he does not want to tell anyone.
Like the shaky, soft need to swoop Sam into his coat. The need he never told anyone about, the need he denied. The need for others to be okay, for him to be okay.
Dean turned his chair towards his books. As quickly as Dean had opened, he'd become closed off and locked the door behind him. Leaving Castiel alone in the cold.
They both appeared rather silly, cheeks red and grins spread across them as they spoke excitedly of Dean's present. Today was his birthday, and a Saturday, so they only had to wait a short time for Dean to come home from work at Bobby's garage, an operation shared by both Dean and Bobby- as Bobby was still a policeman.
“School. Is. Awful. I want to go out and do something with my life, make a difference. And I know I need at least a little education to do that, but everyone at school thinks I’m the freak with a knife collection.”
He could understand that, the need to feel wanted, but sometimes he worried Sam looked for that in the wrong places. Last move Sam had become almost a lackey of a boy’s, Brady's. He was very strange, always asking Sam questions, trying to force himself into his life.
Naomi said nothing, glaring at Gabriel. Anna sighed, hiding her face. Why couldn't Naomi just not talk about-
Dean shrugged, “Whatever. What did you learn in the first day of math that was so hard anyways? One explanation and you’re normally good to go.”
He sighed, "You and Cas are taking the dog for a walk to Bobby's, then Bobby's gonna watch the dog while you guys have your driving lesson, and then you're walking back here."
Dean said nothing, gaze dropping to the floor. He tried to ignore his friend’s concern. Cas’ questioning eyes were burning a hole into his head. But as always, Cas drew him right back in. Dean met Cas’ eyes uncertainly; Castiel didn’t blink.
Sam chose that moment to walk over, as Dean frowned at the two women. “What are you guys, my mothers? I just came here to eat, god.”
Several aspects of this story are personal for me, though not all, and I had intended to further some of these subplots for my own self image and processing. Castiel going to therapy in order to learn to be kind to himself? Me. Internalized homophobia from Dean and/or Cas at points? Me. Older sibling born out of wedlock which causes Family DramaTM and people being Assholes? Can relate. Emotionally abusive relationships with parents, nightmares about not being able to save your family, depression, bullying, anxiety, panic attacks, Castiel’s #TerribleSelfImage? All based on experiences of mine. Not to alarm anyone! Because I am certainly doing better than I was at 15. And I appreciate everyone supporting “Break Me Out.”
Castiel frowned, tilting his head, "I should hope your association with me doesn't cause you to feel like a kidnapper."
Sam nodded, "It was definitely a scrupulous movie. Y'know it wasn't just about jump scares, or showing blood. It showed real, human conflict and managed to make you laugh while shrinking back from real events and behaviors in our country."
Cas just went about things in really creative ways. He thought about things in ways that had never occurred to Dean.
Besides, it had only happened a few times- and- and hadn't the preacher been helping Cas? He scoffed, he didn't know anymore, he was so tired of arguing with himself on whether or not he deserved his punishment.
The cafeteria was cool and welcoming, in contrast to the hot, crowded halls. Dean spotted them from across the room, waving. Jo laughed at something Ash had said, before stealing a fry from his tray.
It seemed the house was looking for something, for someone. 463 Bentley Drive had a certain code for who could live there and what they could do when inside. Obviously Charles Novak had not qualified, or the house had been mistaken when it first allowed him inside. Maybe the house had a problem understanding people, too.
"Where are you going, Lucifer?" Cas said to himself in the crowd as he silently followed his brother, disappearing into the trees so as not to be seen.
Dean was glad Zeppie could help, even if he could not. Sam would shut him out if Dean ever breached the subject of nightmares. But Zeppie, the sweet, loving shepherd, need only rest his head on Sam and his chest would settle.
Sam hurried in the bathroom, thankful he had showered at night as he quickly brushed his teeth and ran a brush through his hair. He shook his hair, his brown bangs lying sloppily against his head. He hurried down the stairs to meet Dean, who only laughed.
"No one knew any better than the lessons our father taught us, so no one in the household could help me- but you see, that's alright. I managed just fine on my own, Azazel," Lucifer said calmly.
He and Dean had begun a list of movies which Cas apparently needed to see. Unfortunately, there were not many days left to Christmas vacation- which Castiel oddly found he was enjoying for once- so the two could only get so far on the list, but they had already watched all the Back to the Future movies. Which Castiel found he enjoyed immensely. They had also seen a Clint Eastwood movie in November, something Dean had been rather pleased about.
"Oh quit trying to make everyone feel bad for you Castiel," Naomi said in irritation from the passenger seat.
Dean cleared his throat, "he was pretty high up in his gang, same gang that killed my mom, and uh, he was a wacko."
"Thank you for making sure the present was alright Sam," Cas said with a big grin, happily hiding what they both knew the present was.
She chuckled, "What I mean by that is it sounds like you're going through a lot right now.’You've got a lot on your plate' is just an expression. It means that you have multiple things going on, things which may be upsetting or confusing to you."
Gabriel made a sound of approval, "Hm, then I guess I've got no problem with the guy. What's his name? He cute?"
"I know I know I'm sorry." She eyed the locker, fistful of hair trapped inside. "It's just... there's a lot in there."
"Well sorry I can't tell you what I had for breakfast this morning, Cas. Not a big sharer over here."
Since Dean and Cas had not yet properly met- properly being knocking into each other in the hallway- they did not notice the other in their study hall. In fact, Castiel was so quiet Dean had not noticed him the second day either, which he found outrageously humorous when he saw his friend on their third day of school.
"Castiel, it's okay. It's alright, you're safe now. You're safe," Anna said, scooting closer to him on the small bathroom floor.
Castiel smiled to himself as he continued to walk around the store, eyeing a small guinea pig resting in his cage. The other kennels were large enough for each pet to have a friend but it seemed this creature was alone. He sighed, wishing he could take the lonely animal home.
"Not your sister, she's not mine either. She's not anyone's sister, unless whoever mom was with had his own kids. Anna is a bastard, we didn't know until sometime after dad left. That's why he left Castiel, don't you see? She made him leave! She tore this family apart!"
"I swear I'm not trying to be a jackass, but don't you wanna shower? Trust me when I tell you that living in your own sick does not make you feel better."
It was such a heartbreaking thing to watch her brother go through, and she had no idea what she should do. She never knew. She felt so helpless around Castiel, she wanted to reassure him he was okay- calm him down, but she could never keep him away from the things that dragged him down, especially if she was one of them.
He scrubbed his skin of tears; the salt burnt like acid running down his cheeks. Friends laughed and sang and danced in drunken glee as Dean sat alone.
What was he? Sam said something to him, a soft voice of ups and downs. Castiel had understood nothing.
glaring at him for approaching. His hand froze before the knocker and just as Castiel turned to leave, cursing himself under his breath, the door opened.
Gabriel stepped back, still glaring, "Well, you think about that. I'm gonna go find Anna, she doesn't have to be your sister, but she sure as hell is mine."
part of him worried the man would know they were discussing him and waltz right in, taking Castiel with him.
Cas tilted his head as he continued to wash the dishes, "When we first met, you would say you would '
Jo welcomed his brother and friends into The Roadhouse with a grin, having expected a small group from Dean's car- though she was surprised two of these were Meg and Cas. Sam couldn't exactly blame her for either, especially since Meg Masters did not often associate herself with Jo- she mostly kept to Cas, flitting by his side in the hallway.
The man's body fell against Castiel, who flinched back, before prying his shirt out of the dead man's grasp.
Dean nearly cried out again, his lip ripping further with the forced smile. "Suh it? Suh, suh? I'm smilin'.
for not liking people in this household- Lucifer's a disloyal psychotic immoral junkie, you're an overly caring dramatic awkward pathetic waste, and Anna's-"
He paused, looking at the dark blue hat. Inside the package, was a police officer's hat- not a real one of course- but a police officer's hat. The golden badge shined, the glimmer of the gold catching in Dean's eye as his mouth broke out into a smile.
"Castiel," she spoke softly, fearing her suspicion would be confirmed. "Castiel what didn't you like? Did something happen?"
"Did you want that older man to have sex with you, Castiel? Not to mention that you were a child and children are not capable of consenting."
They pulled out of the driveway, the music blaring at a level Michael would yell at them for were he there. But Anna was different, besides, she had promised Castiel she would sing to him on his birthday. He had told her it wasn't necessary, but on Anna's birthday he often did this- and Anna said she was not to be out celebrated.
It didn't take long before Meg could do this on her own, and Dean had to say he was impressed, Castiel was a good teacher. He also seemedto be a good friend, over the week Dean had witnessed Castiel help other students, despite being somewhat nervous in their presence, and they had been quite grateful.
Bobby straightened up slightly at the term before smiling, "At ease soldier, you can just call me Bobby."
She paused, hearing some rather frightening, maniacal, drunken laughter approaching. Anna looked beyond Crowley and saw a car speeding towards them.
Dean's kind of categorized his friend's expressions, and he has to admit, it's amusing. The main, almost constant expression on Castiel's face is stern. A frown, and ever so slightly furrowed eyebrows, Dean thinks it's kind of strange that Cas so naturally furrows his eyebrows. Honestly, it doesn't even seem like he puts effort into it, it's just always there.
Gabriel walked over, pulling out their father's box. He gasped, "Gabriel, you should not touch that!"
"You aren't insane, Castiel. But you do see yourself in a way that sounds cruel and unfair to you. And you know, you can change that. It's important not to give those thoughts too much power. Because that is your power to give, to whatever you want. You don't have to feel that way about yourself."
His green eyes are amicable and open, and Castiel can’t help but wonder if he deserves such kindness. No, no he is stopping that thought right there. Castiel cannot allow himself to go down this road, to hold matches in his hands as if its nothing more than a game. After all, he’s playing with fire and he is tired of playing games. This whole thought process started because Cas was trying to express how much he cared for Dean. Why was it so difficult for him to just tell Dean how he feels?
He grabbed Cas roughly by the shoulders, pulling half of his body up from the cold, dirty wooden floor, "I said shut up!" He screamed, roughly slamming him back against the ground.
Castiel lay on his bed, legs dangling off of his white bedspread. He was too exhausted to do anything of value. He said nothing as the muffled voices continued. His hands itched to move, to scratch, to tie his shoelaces, to draw- to do
He frowned, as he entered the kitchen, “I’m sorry. Anyways, I did not stay up all night, I went to bed the same time I normally do. Gabriel, I told you what I was reading yesterday- do you listen to a word I say? The Man Who Would Be King?”
Henriksen frowned, "Well yes, while your playing could make a grown man cry- that's not why you're here."
Castiel blushed softly, dragging his foot across the floor, "Perhaps I was having a somewhat enjoyable time."
Castiel closed his eyes, inhaling and exhaling deeply. He knew Naomi, he knew her- always more than willing to make him feel unworthy, pushing him around since he was a child. The youngest Novak was well aware of her feelings towards him, which were similar to most others in the household.
The stout one started pulling down his trousers, ripping them off his body, before hungrily grabbing his underwear.
Disgusted with himself, upset, outraged with his failure to ever do something good, and silenced, if ever anyone were to ask him what was wrong.
Dean had wrapped him in a blanket, and driven him home after Castiel's panic attack. Cas couldn't blame him, if a puddle was enough to make him sob and scream, how could he be trusted driving a car?
"Yes Dean, I understand the deception this meeting- and/or meetings- would require. However, I believe it too risky- I am sorry, but this would be bad of me to do, therefore I cannot condone this action."
He hums along with the princess’ next song, Dean offering a thumbs up when the heroine decides to pursue her dream and step away from her family’s island. Dean is also humming, though Cas is unsure whether it pertains to the movie or his own thoughts. The soft pressure against his palm is comforting and Dean must know this because he doesn’t let Cas go.
Crowley's grip tightened around his jaw, fingers turning white against Castiel's reddening jaw, hissing he said, "
"I have said it before and I will say it once more, your incorrect opinion is invalid- I like this car very much. I have driven this vehicle multiple times, yes, as I am rather fond of this car. This car and I have developed a strong bond over the months that have passed, this car is bound to me, and I to him."
Dean rolled his eyes as the boys waked into their school, "I still don't get why Sam. Most people hate Mondays, what's so bad about Tuesdays?"
He frowned, "Dude, you're a junior- I'm a senior. So, like it or not," Dean said with a smirk, "I'm older than you."
Castiel's eyes widened, "What do you mean she's gone?!"She's gone Cas, her side of the room is practically empty.
"Sam Winchester, my knight in armor, if you were up here I might..." she smiled, glad he wasn't looking at her. “I'd kiss you."
"But..." Castiel's voice dropped to a whisper, eyes glued to the floor. "I was..." he closed his eyes, hating his inability to
Lucifer chuckled, lowering the gun to his side, "You see you... workers, of mine. You're not- you're not... worth anything," Lucifer said calmly, clicking his tongue as he walked around the room.
Sam offered no further information, his mouth a sharp line and his eyes carved of emotion, hollowed with bitter acceptance of the uncontrollable.
He sighed, obviously they were both scared. Their family was built off of spite and competition. They probably didn't know how to trust one another.
So when Sam brought up his brother's upcoming birthday at lunch, Cas knew Dean felt uncomfortable. As many jokes as Dean made, as fearless as he could be, sometimes he was shy. Cas had seen it when walking with Dean to get Sam, and a teacher would talk to Dean.
"Sammy and I, well uh, Sammy was playing with a neighbor's kid- Jake- he wanted a friend so bad, Cas, so I let him play with him. I watched, of course, kid was only 11- didn't want anything happening to him. Jake pushed him, they were playing around, and Sam fell down hard- I ran over, and out of nowhere, this big dog-"
Cas frowned, tilting his head in thought, "I don't understand...what else does ejaculate mean other than to-" his eyes widened, "oh."
"You seem troubled," Castiel said abruptly. "Of course, that's a primary aspect of your personality so-"
Castiel tossed him a green apple, smiling with something bitter. Dean caught the fruit easily. He bit into its skin.
He paused when he reached Anna, and joined her in kneeling. He made sure none of his siblings were looking at him and leaned towards his sister, avoiding his other’s watchful eye who had just turned to look at him. Naomi took church very seriously. Anna smiled at him and he pointed at the wooden cross, she raised her eyebrows and he leaned towards her, cupping his mouth with one hand and dropping his light voice to a whisper.
Dean bit his lip, "Um, if you're not busy... could you help me study for something? I have a test in my history class tomorrow- but if you have a quiz, or- or a test or something... Then that's... I mean, that's- that's cool."
"Yeah, well we would 'ave hurried up, but we were busy with the dog!" Dean said, throwing his hands up in the air.
Castiel felt his eyebrows furrowing as he stared at Dean, tilting his head as he did so. "You were?"
"He was hidin'!" The nasally voiced man said, "Behind some books 'nd shelves- hidin' in da back! We found 'im- we-we found 'im for ya, sir."
"If you are supposedly my younger brother, this would make me the older brother I presume, correct?"
Anna’s muffled voice was there, somewhere. Castiel placed the orange on the green rack, wincing when his finger accidentally pushed into the fruit, coating his hand with a strange, sugary smell. And he just couldn’t wash his hands in the men’s warm smelling bathroom at the grocery store, it was too warm and messy with everyone else’s germs.
"Because rock and roll was done. Over. Gone. Elvis Presley had gone off to the war, as well as various other retired rock and roll legends. Thus, the world moved on. The Beatles made people want to play guitars again; The Beatles aroused rock and roll. Without them, who knows when rock and roll would have come back? If at all. They grabbed rock by the strings and pulled it back in."
Anna shook her head, filling him a plate, "No, I haven't. I'm sorry, I'll keep an eye out for it- you should ask Michael, he might’ve seen it."
Her short sleeves revealed warm chocolate skin a few shades lighter than her hair, moving as she finished writing.
"Fine," Sam said, now frowning, "good luck finding someone else who'll want to save your nagging ass."
Crowley sighed, Cas' continuous attempts to appear all powerful were so annoying,"Just go do your job."
Sam smiled, "Yeah but, who knows if I'll even be here that long- I never know with my dad. You see... his job, it- it has us move around a lot. I just always feel bad, because I don't know if I'm staying or not."
Years of lamenting his experience in church and denying its existence seemed pointless. A year with a new boy had changed his entire life.
Sam saw his displeased expression and sighed, "Why don't you go find Cas, Dean? You guys are friends, go find him. And play nice."
"Yeah, sorry to bug you guys with this," Dean said with a laugh that Sam knew to be forced. "You probably really don't wanna hear about my stupid new friend drama."
His name. His lashes flickered against his pale skin, acknowledging the speaker for the first time. Cas said nothing, raising his eyebrows.
As much as Dean had enjoyed teasing Sam about the beauty of puberty, Dean wouldn’t be able to laugh off a public boner. Sure, he was graduating in a few weeks and no one would ever know what had happ- unless someone already knew.
Also, a chapter or so ago I had someone new comment on my fic and I just wanted to let everyone know that that's totally cool- don't be shy, it's cool.
Cas was silent, before his glare deepened further, "At least my family wants me around," he spat, "you hypocritical
Castiel sighed, "Perhaps she has simply grown tired of me. I am not exactly an easy person to be around, Dean."
A stir in his chest feared Anna knew him all too well. A couple passed their small car as they rolled a grocery cart to their steps, looking at the siblings. The woman wore a large green sweatshirt and baggy jeans, her husband wearing similar clothes despite the warm weather.
WARNING: This chapter contains mentions of rape, bad father son relationships, and Crowley harshly insulting anything to do with/anything he BELIEVES to do with bad father son relationships.
Dean looked at the ground, then back to Sam, and his face lit up, “Well hey! At least we live around Jo and Ash this time, it’s been a while since you stopped by the roadhouse, hasn’t it?”
Despite the tightening of his chest, he nodded, after this she had to leave him alone, right? Then he could go back to studying for his quiz. She rested her hand on his shoulder, and he visibly flinched. Her cold, tight grip unnerving him. She looked down at him, the frightening calm masking her face in a way he found eerily reminded him of Lucifer.
Cas bit his lips before taking a shaky sigh, "Yes, this is the car I wish to learn in if you do not mind."
He tapped Cas on the shoulder who turned around, "Cas, I don't think you get it- I'm not letting you do the dishes."
Castiel smiled from the garage, crawling out from under the window and across the garage so as not to be seen, hearing Bobby muttering as he left the room.
"I understand. I too have experienced difficulties with 'this stuff.' But it does not make either of us happy to see you suffer Dean." His lips rose before falling into a deeper sadness against his face. "My feelings completely aside, this repression is not
Cas returned Sam's sigh, though it was far deeper and longer than Sam's, "Fine. Fine, Sam Winchester. I will sit with you and your brother and listen intently to what everyone has done today. Will that make you happy?"
, Anna dear. I shot a man in the leg so you could escape, I am fulfilling a deal- I am keeping my end of the bargain and if it is required I will
He sighed again, "Yes yes keep up with me your world's crashing at your feet you should be paying attention. Your older brother's the leader of a gang, cliche I'm aware but it's your fucked up family not mine. So since you seem to be hopeless on your own and Lucifer's grown tired of being ignored in his own house what say we get you out of here so one of his men doesn't spill your guts on the ground, hm?"
Dean scoffed, rolling his eyes at the comment before his lips pulled back into a forced, mocking smirk. Despite this expression his eyes held no mirth or confidence, only a frigid acknowledgement was shown in his eyes.
"And does this look like something I would rest in?" Gabriel said with a bewildered expression, holding his brown sweater up in disgust. "Because I don’t think so."
Dean leaned over and turned the car away from the tree, both being thrown in the fast turn. Cas then remembered his foot and eased off of the gas, resisting the urge to yank his foot off of the pedal.
Did all help feel like that? Was that the real kind of helpful he strived for? Or was this simply a helpfulness he didn't deserve? And the others didn't know it yet?
"Well Romeo and Juliet's human flaws have much to do with their tragic story," he said with a knowing smile. "Which you will expand upon tonight."
Worse yet, at times there was this odd tension between Sam and John. More of an awkwardness. John didn't leave Sam alone as often as he would Dean; John's drinking occurred outside their motel and his sleeping was on their couch. John had to stick around and watch Sam to some extent. He couldn't work as much with Dean gone.
Dean laughed harder, "Oh... Oh, nothing." He wiped his eyes again, Whew. It's been a long time since I've laughed that hard," he shook his head. "Oh. It's been more than a long time. Years."
His smile grew and he chuckled, "Oh, no, Led Zeppelin's a band. Their names were Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Bonham, and John Paul John. They were an English rock band too- and they formed in the 60's thought it was the late 60's but, and I mean no disrespect, they were different than The Beatles."
Castiel and Samandriel always interacted considerably well, as well as Castiel and Muriel, this had always been an interesting change of dynamics for Castiel- to be older than members of his family. Though he did have cousins his own age he enjoyed to be around. These were Balthazar and Uriel- there was also Rachel (Balthazar's twin sister) but Cas' relationship with her mostly consisted of watching Balthazar tease her.
"Cas I- I'm sorry, I can't talk right now. Listen man, I didn't mean to drag you from your house to here me cry about a bad dream I had," Dean said with a scoff, "you don't have to stay."
Cas' eyes widened as he realized he'd almost forgotten one of the most important names, "and Julia!" He rushed to recover.
God, he couldn't say it. He couldn't, he just couldn't! Cas didn't know how to tell his boyfriend how awful a person he was, how disgusting he was, he didn't know how to do that. Maybe that wasn't helpful, as the priest had said it was, but...still, Castiel had deserved it.
Anna smiled softly, wrapping the remaining food in the refrigerator for her brother, “Do you have anything in particular you’d like to do?”
"I'm sorry Dean," Castiel said with a frown, not looking at Dean's hurt expression. "But I don't need your help."
"What cause I don't? You're throwing me to the dogs, Cas," Dean said, staring at the small coiled vase before him.
Having Castiel in two classes, not counting homeroom, was a delight to him. He only wished he was smarter so he could be with his friend more often, not that he would tell Cas that. Surely his friend would think he was strange, and Dean didn't need that. Still, it was nice to have the classes he did with him.
At the same time, he no longer wished to keep this a secret- but, the fear of disgust and rejection was still there, still inside Castiel, discouraging him from ever seeking help. However, with Dean being as he was, Castiel could only hope Dean would be different. That Dean would care about him.
"Meg was being quite a kvetch for the duration of yesterday's aurora, and I was informed of many cavils of hers. One of these including the quibbling and demur to a science test."
Cas was.... Dean liked... Cas was... well, Cas, and Dean just sat by and left him suffer alone. What was wrong with him? Did Cas mean nothing to him? Why hadn't he known?
However, Naomi tended to her work far too similar as she would a business. Children were not to be treated as another number at the end of a check, he said this because money wise Naomi very well with the school. However, some people, especially Naomi, were not meant to deal with children.
He shrugged, "Sure. Rita, Martha, Vera, Chuck, Dave, Jude, Michelle, Molly, Bill, Bonnie, Joan, Rose, Valerie, Desmond, Lucy, Penny- not Sadie, because I do not want my child to be sexualized- Lucy, Abbey, Eleanor, Mackenzie for a boy, Prudence, Madonna, Lizzie, Rocky, Nancy, Dan, Pam, Jo-Jo, Robert."
would punish him, for being bad. Castiel managed to stumble out of the crowd, closer to the actual bar and away from those people- he noticed Meg look at him, running after him.
Gabriel said nothing, his eyes moving to the corner of the kitchen. He didn't want to be the guy to tell Cassie he'd heard the couple's shouts (and not the good kind) the other day. It was obvious the two seniors were in disagreement.     It must have been something importabt for so many doors to be slammed around their house.
Cas' eyes widened slightly in realization, and he nodded gratefully at Dean before turning to Ash, "Oh, nothing of import I suppose."
Anna nodded, looking down as she continued to clean, "Yes, our family isn't exactly the best example for friendliness."
"Hey man, you sure you want to drive? We can just hang out at my house or something, you look like you've been through the mill, man," Dean said as they backed out of his house, not mentioning the fact that maybe he just wanted to hang out with Cas alone at home for once.
She sighed, as if she was speaking to an incompetent child, "That language is hardly necessary, sometimes others can speak so harshly. Dean I am simply trying to protect my family at whatever costs. I fight my own battles as you have; I'm a warrior, just as you are. You and I are on in the same, we have more common than you think."
Gabriel noticed her worried expression and rolled his eyes, silently telling her to relax. She sighed, but nodded, looking at her little brother hopefully. This was it. Cas was going to a party, with friends, to celebrate a holiday- yes, this was normal. And he was doing just fine with it.
Cas' frown turned into a downright glare at the mention of Dean, "I believe it is safe to assume you did not truly come here to discuss with me the status of my relationship. What do you want?"
She nodded nervously as Sam rummaged through his bag. "Sam Winchester I swear to god if you try to make this Sixteen Candles I will murder you. I will
The white haired man turned, looking both ways for the obnoxiously loud music. The car inched slowly behind him, blaring 'Bicycle Race' as the old man teetered on his bicycle. Cas covered his mouth, laughing softly at the bewildered expression on his face.
“You see, the thing is, I don’t really…” he coughs, “I’m not really a huggy, touchy feely kind of guy. And uh, I used to think that was a good thing. I used to think that’s what kept me… uh, what kept me going.”
Neither brother spoke. Gabriel stared at his brother, watching him more carefully with the recent declaration. Their sink dripped.
Despite these difficulties, Castiel found he rather enjoyed school. He found he liked that it was a charter school as well.
Dean chuckled, "Yeah, my- my folks used to argue sometimes, and my brother argues with my dad, I've been there."
She crossed her arms, her glare darkening, "Believe it or not Winchester, he was my friend first. Yeah, he was your boyfriend first, but I don't care- I'm coming."
Dean shook his head as he took another turn, "No I mean- well yeah but he's- he's different lately. He was kind of... cold, to me yesterday- other times he'll be completely normal. But it's just... I just... there's so much I don't know about him, Sam- and he knows basically everything about me."
Gabriel rolled his eyes as he closed the bar door behind them, "As charming as you may be some people may still hate you, I know I know, it's shocking."
He ran a shaky hand across his tired eyes once more, god he hated crying, "Um, D-Dean, it happened more than once."
"What you meant, was that you were being overly emotional- or showing emotion at all, which, for whatever reason you think is bad. That's not something only women do, that's something humans do." She frowned, "You're being human; don't blame my gender for it."
meretricious," he said angrily, "Yes, you are attractive." Cas rested his hand on Dean's knee, looking him in the eye, as if willing his point to be heard, "You are beautiful, but your features do not restrain you from being more than your reflection. You're strong Dean, you have struggled through your life and more often then not- seem to have come out on top. You are so intelligent, I am sure you would not have yourself believe me- but you are."
Meg rolled her eyes again, her arms moving as she spoke. "She's great and all but every battle on the goddamn earth turns into an entire class of 'lives lost' and 'the emotional turmoil of rebellion and reluctance'."
Even though Dean doesn’t mind that Cas loves those headphones. He doesn’t mind even a little, not even at all.
Cas grimaced, how did Dean not gag at his touch? He tried to pull his disgusting hands back. Dean's hands moved with him before he gently slipped his fingers from Castiel's grip.
Cas smiles with something that doesn’t quite meet his eyes. He ignores the part of his brain that asks him why Dean puts up with someone as awkward and awful as he is. Dean can’t hear his inner turmoil, and he can’t assume to know what Dean is thinking. Dean doesn’t mention that Castiel never answered his question, and a part of Castiel kicks himself for not giving Dean what he wants. Why doesn’t he ever just give Dean what he wants?
"Uh," he laughed nervously, rubbing his neck, "Hm- I- uh, I really didn't mean for this to become a 'boohoo Dean Winchester' session."
Everyone at the table -except Dean- laughed. Well, Cas smiled softly, only barely chuckling, but the intent was the same. Dean rolled his eyes at the annoying group of dumbasses he sat with.
Gabriel's expression darkened for a moment as he chuckled, "I guess making her proud didn't include sticking around, he certainly didn't. But whatever it's passed, not much we can do about either of 'em I guess. Families are fragile I suppose."
Thank you everyone who has been reading and giving kudos! Sorry updates haven't been so regular. This was just a really long chapter and it took a long time to write.
Of course Anna was supportive but Castiel couldn't discuss his appointments with her. Gabriel meant well but therapy was far too serious a topic to discuss with his brother. After all, Castiel had to fake some semblance of sanity, didn't he?
Castiel awoke in a considerably better mood the next day, even almost smiling as he prepared himself for school.
Ellen placed a plate of chicken salad in front of Sam, and a burger for Dean when she returned from another table. The boys eyed the food hungrily, making no attempts to hide their delight at the sight of it. Ellen smiled, shaking her head, and handing each boy a set of silverware.
He smiled, "Lilith pardon my rudeness but why don't we skip the formalities tonight? Both you and I have places to be, things to do, people to kill."
Sam didn't have to worry, his record would always be squeaky clean. After all he never did anything, what friends did he have to get him in trouble? Any friends he did have would be long gone soon. If Sam wasn't careful his family would soon be long gone as well.
"What?" He sputtered, frustrated the woman continued to focus on him. "I don't know, aren't we here to help Cas?"
