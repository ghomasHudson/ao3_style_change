“Staring at the door isn’t gonna make him show up any faster,” Jo said, setting another beer on the bar in front of him.
“It’s, like, twenty degrees outside, Cas.”
“You could’ve told the truth. But I guess law school being paid for is more important than me, right?”
“Can we stop talking about Dean’s boring ass job?” Ash grumbled. “We’re supposed to be celebrating!” Dean raised his glass.
Next update will be later today, probably when I get home
“Yeah, I know, but I’ve been looking for a project to keep me busy on my off days. Baby’s mint, and I’ve been thinking about getting that one. Think you could do your project on it?” Cas bit his lip. It was a good idea. Hell, it was a great idea. He nodded.
Hey Cassie how’ve you been?
Dean smiled. He was glad he had taken Charlie’s advice.
“General information is fine, but I really don’t need a list of all the people you’ve ever hooked up with floating around in my brain.” Dean’s eyes snapped up.
“See, thirty minutes and you’re already better than Gabe.”
“Surprisingly well.” Charlie raised an eyebrow.
“Well, how about Cas’s mystery man?”
“I’m not in love. I have a crush on him.”
“The things I do for that woman. You look very handsome, by the way. Cas is a lucky guy.”
“Great artists are never appreciated in their own time,” Cas said with a wistful sigh. That was his goal, after all. He didn’t want to be a famous artist until decades after his death. He wanted to be one of the artists covered in college lectures, and who got entire wings of museums dedicated to them. He wanted to be a legend.
Dean mumbled something that definitely wasn’t coherent and Cas chuckled. He wrapped his arms around him and Dean buried his face in the crook of Cas’s neck. Cas pressed a kiss into his hair.
“Thank you, Charlie.”
“Thanks.” Dean sat across from him. They ate in companionable silence for a few minutes before Cas said, “What do we do?” Dean frowned slightly.
Cas looked up from his book when the little bell above the door went off. Meg stood in front of the counter with her hands on her hips.
“And?”
“I’m not angry, I’m tired. I wanna go home. I’ll see ya.” Cas walked out onto the street and took a deep breath of fresh air. Fall had always been his favorite season. It was always just cold enough for him to be able to wear long sleeves or a jacket without people giving me an odd look. He was about to head up the block when he felt a hand on his arm.
“Nothing, sorry.”
On my way back. Didn’t find anything. Dad’s gonna have Sam check the cameras when we get home. You guys good?
“You’ll always be Sammy to me, no matter how old you are. What’s up?”
“Cas, buddy, I’m scared of a lot, I just got good at hiding it. Kinda had to. Couldn’t let Sammy think something was wrong. But you know you can always come to me with stuff like this, right?”
Yeah that’s fine. I’ve got news
“Hello, Sam.”
“Smells good in here.” Dean jumped a little. Benny grinned at him.
“You weren’t giving me the information I needed, so I had Michael follow you. He said you and Dean were spending an awful lot of time at each other’s apartments.”
“It’s not that simple for me.”
“I don’t know, Dean.” He reached out, and cupped his cheek. “I’m sorry, but she was an idiot for letting you go.” There was a beat of silence between them, eye contact unwavering, before Dean leaned in. His lips were soft and the skin on skin contact was electrifying. Cas sighed into the kiss. It was better than he had imagined. He was also acutely aware that they had just crossed that line. They could call it a one-off and chalk down as a drunken mistake, but Cas knew he was screwed.
“Ow. I know. And if you’re gonna be mean about it, I’m gonna sit on that side.”
“Yeah, a search team, not the Hardy boys.” Christian bristled.
“No idea. She wouldn’t tell me. She just said they were gonna make tonight more fun.” Dean’s face paled a little and Castiel couldn’t help laughing. “Oh, calm down. If you pass out, Cas’ll catch you.”
“Of course it does, angel.”
“Get what?”
“Yeah, I’m good. Just tired. Didn’t get a lotta sleep last night.” He sighed and got to work on some brownie batter. Benny didn’t say anything else, but Dean could feel him watching him. He ignored it. He stuck the pan in the oven, set the timer, and walked back out front to get a cup of coffee. He leaned against the server station and took out his phone.
“Well…okay.” Dean nodded. “We can do that.”
“Make me.” Cas swallowed.
“Dean, sit down and talk to me.”
“You’re drunk.” Dean took a moment to consider that.
Second update for today!
I’ll let him know. Thanks Cas. He needs this.
“Hey, Deano!” Gabriel said with a grin.
“Why do I feel like you’re trying to set me up with this guy?”
“Yes, sir,” Dean said, thankful he didn’t get yelled at. Of course, that didn’t mean he wouldn’t get yelled at later. Bobby went back into his office and Gabriel smacked Dean on the back of his head.
“Hey, I don’t mind people looking, but the staring was making me a little uncomfortable.”
“That is actually not a bad idea. Talk to me about what?” Charlie’s blush deepened. Cas rolled his eyes.
“I like him. I can’t explain why, I just do.” Gabriel nodded.
“Three? I’m pretty sure this is number three.” Cas chuckled.
“How’s Balthazar handling this? I haven’t talked to him.”
“It’s not as fun when you’re not there to distract me,” Cas said. “I don’t want to talk about work tonight.”
“Yeah. Let me just tell Bobby I’m takin’ off. It’s been dead all day, he should be good by himself for the last twenty minutes.
“God, you’ve been spending too much time with Sammy. Here.” Dean slid his plate between them. “Eat like a normal person.” Cas smirked and took some fries. Jo stopped by to drop off another round of drinks and gasped.
“What?”
“You wouldn’t lie to me, would you, Castiel?”
“Are you sure? I crossed a line and I don’t want you to feel like you have to keep being my friend.” Cas tilted his head and laughed.
“Pretty much the same. Sam’s with Eileen and I’m sure Adam’ll find someone to kiss.”
“Hey, babe.”
“We are, but what about them? We just left them.”
“Excuse me?” Was all Cas could think to say.
“Hey. Sorry. I didn’t mean to crash here.” Dean smiled. He didn’t seem hungover, but his hair was wet which meant he had showered.
“You’re late,” Charlie said.
“Oh, God. What did I do?”
“Shut up,” Cas grumbled. “These pancakes are amazing. I’d fuck these pancakes.” Dean snorted.
“Yeah. Sam had an astrology phase when he was, like, eight. He would stay up all night, just watching the sky. I’d stay out there with him just to make sure he was okay, and so he’d have someone to ramble to about outer-space.” Cas looked down and returned the smile.
Feel free to drop a comment. I love feedback and constructive criticism!
Of course I love you and I promise I’ll be home. I’m taking Maggie for a walk but I shouldn’t be more than an hour.
“Won’t work. He seems…prickly. I don’t think he even really wants to help me.”

“I know, but you still shouldn’t have to change things for me.”
“Definitely. These last three days were hell without you. Even a
“I didn’t throw a bitch fit! He betrayed me!”
“All I was saying was that Jess and I are gonna start touring campuses soon.” Dean frowned slightly.
“Don’t get snippy with me, Castiel. Dad’s pissed at you.”
“Thank you.” Cas got out of bed and buzzed his brother in. The elevator took two minutes and forty-eight seconds to reach the penthouse. That gave Cas just enough time to brush his teeth and throw on some clean clothes. When Gabriel walked in, Cas was sitting on the couch under a blanket.
“Damn it, Cas. Don’t do that.” He set the tray on top of the oven and leaned against the counter for a second to try and get his heart rate back under control.
“Don’t get what?”
“DEAN WEARS PANTIES!” Sam yelled. Dean rolled his eyes. That wasn’t much of a secret anymore. So, of course, Cas had to open his mouth.
“I need to talk to you and I need you to be serious for once,” Castiel said. He had been up all night, trying to decide if talking to Gabriel would be worth the ‘I told you so’. He had to talk to
“Hello, Dean. I see you’re alive and well.”
“I’ll miss you, too, sweetheart. See ya in a few hours.”
“You won’t be disappointed, I promise. I’ll bring it out when it’s ready.”
“You’re very welcome, Dean,” Cas replied, and Dean could hear the soft smile in his voice.
“Mom and Dad?” Dean asked Sam, even though he could take a guess at the answer. Sam swallowed some whiskey.
“Fine. But you really don’t have to.”
“Don’t start, Dean, she’s a child.”
“Fine, fair enough. My turn. Give me an animal and a time limit.” Cas thought for a minute.
“Are you okay? You don’t sound okay.” Dean chuckled weakly.
“Got it. I’ll be right back.” Sam left and Dean breathed a little easier. He loved his little brother, but Sam had become a little overbearing as the wedding got closer. He knew it was because he cared, but all Dean really wanted was a few quiet minutes to himself. A knock came at the door and he sighed.
“Hey, eyes front,” he hissed.
The rest of the night was a blur. Cas remembered bits and pieces, but for the most part it was a haze of alcohol. Gabriel had cut him off at some point, but the next thing he clearly remembered was waking up in the middle of the night. His scream had been cut short by the sudden need to vomit. Gabriel was beside him in a second.
“Hey, Cas.”
“Stay. I could use the company.” Cas sat back down, but he didn’t look too happy about it.
Dean melted into the embrace. He had to be strong for Sam, but he knew he could be open with Cas. He also appreciated that Cas wasn’t talking. He wasn’t telling him that everything would be okay or that it would get better. He was just there for Dean to lean on. A warm body to hold him until he could get a grip on himself. It took twenty minutes, but Dean’s sobs eventually faded into soft hiccups. He lifted his head off Cas’s shoulder.
“We’ll be good, I promise,” Meg said. “We just missed you. It’s been a while since we all hung out.”
“Apparently I am now,” Castiel muttered.
“Get some food in your system and then you can drink as much as you want.” Dean couldn’t argue with that.
Dean weighed his options. He was going to spend the night getting drunk anyway. At least if he did it at a bar with a friend he could say he was being social.
“Dean, wait.”
“Damn it, Cas. Don’t do that.”
“Really?”
Thank you. Very helpful. I’ll try calling him after the weekend. He does deserve some uninterrupted time with his girlfriend. And I think I deserve some face to face time with my boyfriend.
“You are still coming out here, right?” Cas chewed his lip.
“Great. See ya, Gabe.”
“Nope.”
“I can do that.” Cas put his hand on Dean’s arm and handed him a glass of water.
“No. Kinda feels more like a job interview, honestly.”
“Sam, how tall are you?” Balthazar asked. Cas shot him a warning look, knowing full well where his cousin was going with his questions.
“You’re right, I don’t. So are you gonna buy something, or just stand there wasting my time?” Dean looked around the empty store.
“You haven’t given me a reason not to.”
“Because I never had time. Guess I’ve got a lot now.” Sam rolled his eyes.
“I’ll take most of the credit for that. And I’m sure Gabriel with accept the rest.”
“Mr. Singer said he’s gonna get the car registered for me and get the plates. I can pick it up tomorrow. Can you bring me again?” Dean nodded.
forgive me for this, Gabriel. He thinks I chose Chuck and Naomi’s money over him.”
“Well, this is awkward. Guess it’s a good thing I showed up.” He sat in the booth beside Cas. “I should’ve known “late lunch” meant early drinking.” Cas looked at the time on his phone.
“Thanks, Dean. What’s going on with you?”
“Deal.”
“I got my LSAT results.”
“Why do you always do this to me?”
“I never said better. It might be safer, though.”
“So, we’re on for later?”
Not yet. Dad’s keeping his guard up. That’s all we can do. I’ll let him know you’re alive. Stay safe.
“You don’t have to.”
“Good.”
“That’s the only reason anyone hangs out with me.”
“Talking from experience over there?”
“Thank you.”
“Being dragged there would be a more accurate way of putting it, but yes. Meg invited Sam and Sam said I have to come. I think he’s dragging Adam, too.”
“Hey, babe!”
“Gabe and Sammy are gone. We should leave, too.” Cas didn’t argue, but he did stop Dean from getting behind the wheel of his car.
“In his defense, Jack has killer puppy eyes,” Dean said.
“Gee, why didn’t I think of that?”
“Relax,” Charlie said after releasing his hand. “I’m just here to make sure Dean doesn’t disappear. He’s all yours. If you guys need anything, I’ll be in the next room.” She winked and closed herself in the adjoining room. Cas turned back to Dean and found him blushing a little.
“I’m not having this conversation.”
“Yeah, I know.” He held out the little ceramic star. “Put this on top for me.”
“You’re too nice. I know I’m good-looking, but I’m not that good-looking.” Cas chuckled.
“I really am happy for you, Cas.”
“I fixed it up myself. It’s mint. Take good care of it and it’ll run for another forty years.”
“With her, ya never know.”
Cas put his phone in his pocket and started the eight-block walk. It was the middle of February, so it was still chilly out. He zipped his jacket and tucked his hands in his pockets. He hadn’t scratched in almost a month and planned to keep it that way. The perpetual red marks on his arm were finally starting to fade, leaving only the white scars. He also hadn’t had a nightmare in the last couple weeks. In short, he was feeling better than he had in years. Cas opened the door to the Roadhouse and walked straight to the bar. Jo smiled at him.
“I know you do, but it’s the vest or no deal.”
Next update will be Wednesday!
“I don’t know. I thought I should learn how to do everything before I decide what I wanna do. Dad seemed to think it was a good idea. He said I should learn everything from you.” Dean sighed. He didn’t want to. He wanted to go back to six months ago when they didn’t know Adam existed and everything was fine. But he had told Sam he would try, so he was going to.
“I gather you don’t like him very much?” Gabriel said.
“Hi, Missouri.” Dean went for a hug and was met with a slap.
“Sammy, you can be whatever spoon you want,” Gabriel said.
“Okay. If I don’t see you later…” Dean kissed him deeply. Then he grinned and disappeared back inside. Cas stood there for a minute, trying to catch his breath. Dean Winchester was going to be the death of him.
“CAS, NOW!” Cas frowned slightly.
“Oh, come on, it’s fun. One day you’re gonna look back on this and laugh.”
Cas followed his nose to the kitchen. Benny was chopping vegetables on the counter and Dean was pulling something out of the oven. A pie, by the smell of it. Cas leaned against the entryway and sipped the wine Charlie had given him.
“Can I buy you dinner?”
“You two having fun?”
“Well, I know Cassie is,” Balthazar teased. Cas rolled his eyes, but he was smiling.
Horrible. Absolutely horrendous. I don’t know why I keep coming back.
“Can’t remember the last time I saw you in a suit,” Sam said. Dean didn’t say anything, but he knew when the last time was. Their father’s funeral. After that day he had vowed to never wear a suit again. But fancy restaurants required fancy clothes, and he was willing to make the sacrifice every once in a while if it meant having a nice evening with his friends, and family.
. He looked to his brother.
“God, if I died now, I could die happy.” Dean chuckled.
I'm so sorry, I forgot to update yesterday! Everything was crazy. Please enjoy and Happy Thanksgiving!
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas said automatically. Dean smiled and Cas found himself smiling back. As soon as he walked away, Cas refused to make eye contact with anyone at the table.
“You’re all going to do this all night, aren’t you?”
“No.”
The craving for a drink hit again and panic gripped Dean a little tighter. He dialed Sam’s number.
“I plan on being a civil rights attorney. The world could use more good people.” Cas smiled.
I know. I’m sorry.
“Seriously? I don’t want you to feel like you have to.” Dean shook his head.
“Thank you, Cas.” Sam changed the subject. “So, Dean told me you’re a writer?”
“Meg. To what do I owe the pleasure?” Cas had a weird relationship with Meg Masters. She taught logic and argumentation in the philosophy department. She was nice enough, but she could argue someone into dust without breaking a sweat. She once told Cas she liked her job because she got to teach people how to argue with style.
“Humor me.”
“I guess.” Dean didn’t look convinced, but he must have decided it wasn’t his business because he didn’t press it. “So, you’re not gonna freak out about this, right? I mean, that wasn’t your first time, was it?” Cas rolled his eyes.
“Oh, God. You love him, don’t you?”
“Look, Dean, I’m not happy about this either, but Cas came to us nearly in tears. You’re killing him. I know you’re hurting, I know this isn’t fair, but you’re an adult and if you don’t start acting like one you’re gonna lose the best thing that ever happened to you. Grow up.”
“Boy, what are you doing here?”
“Hey, you showed up!”
“Let’s talk about it later. I need to talk to Sam about something first. Get some more sleep, if you can.”
“I hate you so much right now,” Charlie grumbled. Dean pressed a kiss to the top of her head.
“The pull, you mean? That empty, longing feeling when we’re not together? Is that the feeling you mean?” Dean smiled back.
“We can get a better look if we sit on the hood.” Cas smiled and opened the door. They settled on the hood and Cas rested his head on Dean’s shoulder.
“I love you.” There was a moment of silence in which Cas began to wonder if Dean even felt the same way. Then Dean grabbed his face in both hands and kissed him.
Attached was a picture of bomber jacket in bi colors. Dean burst out laughing. He couldn’t help it. Sam looked over.
“Yeah. Professor Novak has time on Thursdays.” Charlie raised an eyebrow.
“Why do you move around so much, if you don’t mind my asking?” Cas was fishing and Dean knew it. He glanced at Cas and shook his head slightly. Cas held up a finger while Claire answered.
“I didn’t mean to. I lost control for a minute. Did I hurt you?”
“Hey, babe!” He called. Dean didn’t answer, and when he came into the living room his annoyance was written all over his face. Cas frowned. “What’s wrong?”
“Why do you always wear this coat?” he asked, tugging at the lapel of Cas’s trench coat.
“Doesn’t matter. I overreacted.”
“Don’t start,” he sneered.
“You asking as a friend, or something more?” Cas shrugged, a smirk playing at his lips.
“Dude, why are you naked?”
“I really don’t have one. I don’t watch TV. I can’t sit still long enough.”
“We care about you, Clarence.”
“You live right next door. Your elevator takes under three minutes. What the hell took you so long?”
“Why do I feel like you’re not taking this seriously?” Cas held up his nearly empty bottle. Gabriel made a grab for it and Cas pulled it back.
“Which one of you idiots gave Jack a cookie?” Cas turned around. Claire was standing in the doorway to the kitchen with her arms crossed and murder in her eyes.
“Got a second?”
“I know.”
When he stepped off, Cas was noticeably absent from the living room, but Dean could tell by the scent that he was close by. He walked further in and caught a glimpse of sandy brown hair out on the balcony. Cas really needed to stop changing his hair color. And his eye color, too, for that matter. Dean walked out onto the balcony. Cas smiled.
“You’re welcome.” Cas rested his head in Dean’s lap and drew up his knees so he could work. Dean turned back to the TV. He subconsciously sifted his fingers through Cas’s hair as they sat in silence, the only sound coming from the show he was watching. Dean smiled to himself. They had hit a rough patch. Actually, it was more like one of those sand pits on golf courses that he could never for the life of him get out of once he was stuck in one, but they got past it. He still wasn’t sure he completely trusted Cas, but he was happy. Being with Cas made him happy. And they were just dating. It wasn’t like they were talking about marriage.
“Maybe…” he paused, “You know what would be cool? Buy a junk car and bring it back to life. I could document the process.” Dean grinned.
“Doesn’t matter. I know you get nightmares and I shouldn’t leave you alone at night. I’ll just leave a bottle of water on the table.” Cas lifted his head off Dean’s shoulder.
“What are you doing here?” Dean shrugged.
“Why do people keep saying that? We
“We’re not done opening presents,” Charlie pouted.
“Yes, I can tell.” He poured himself a cup of coffee and leaned against the counter. “I just wanted to thank you again for the other day. I did have fun.”
“I was trying to kill you!
“What?”
“Charlie, marry me.” They laughed.
Castiel sighed. He had never liked social media and now he
“How come the rest of us don’t get nicknames?” Nick asked from underneath the hood of a mangled Porsche.
“Don’t we all.” Gabriel’s face fell.
“Please, Cas,” came Dean’s breathless, lust-filled response. Without hesitation or warning, Cas slammed into him, bottoming out and then waiting for Dean to adjust. It stung a little at first, but the pain quickly turned to a burning need for more. When he was ready for Cas to move, Dean pushed his hips back. Cas took the cue. He pulled out almost all the way and slammed back in with a sharp thrust of his hips. Dean cried out as he hit his prostate. Cas set a steady pace that hit Dean perfectly with every other thrust.
“I just pulled in,” he answered.
“You haven’t beaten us at a Trivia Night in three months.”
“Tell me what? Charlie, what the hell’s going on?” Even as he said it, he knew, but he wanted to hear Charlie say it.
“Yo,” Dean said.
. Sam, he decided, was probably his best bet. He’d tease him, but at least Sam knew when to keep his mouth shut.
“It’s just a game, Dean.” Dean broke off a piece of his cookie and threw it at Cas. Cas managed to catch it and popped it into his mouth. “Thank you.”
I’m gonna kill your brother
“Maybe.” Jo yelled for Charlie and she ducked out of the kitchen, leaving Dean alone with his cookies.
“You know what? Fuck off, Gabe.”
“I know, angel, but we gotta.” He looked at his phone to check the time. It was a little past six in the morning. “Come on. We can shower then make breakfast. Jack’s gonna be up in a few minutes anyway.” Cas sighed.
“You know, I’m really not. But no one really seems to care how I feel about the whole thing. So just do whatever you have to do.” He stormed into his room and slammed the door. A tidal wave of emotions crashed over him and he did the only thing he could think to do. He put his fist through the wall. He looked down at his bloody knuckles. It hurt, but at least he was feeling something now. A soft knock came at the door before Pamela came in.
Meg and I will be there. I’ll find out from Gabe.
“I love you.” Cas blinked.
“Just because
“We’re just messing with each other,” Dean said. To prove his point, he kissed Cas on the cheek.
“Guess I should buy more of that,” Dean said, “if it’s gonna keep you around here longer.” Cas hummed quietly. “Do you wanna watch another movie or do you need to get going?” Cas looked at the clock on Dean’s nightstand. He really needed to leave.
“A little past ten-thirty.” Cas groaned.
“You underestimate me.” Cas’s phone buzzed on his desk. He looked at the screen.
“I was the only professor with available office hours.”
“Got room for two more?”
“I can…uh…hang out…for a while…if you want.” The offer caught Cas off guard.
“You’ve got quite the acid tongue today,” he grumbled. Cas smiled softly and patted his cheek.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well…thank you, then.” They continued up the street and Dean held the door open out of habit. Cas didn’t say anything. They sat at the bar and Benny brought them their drinks.
“What? No. I’m not in the mood and you’re in no condition to give proper consent anyway.”
“Shut up. It’s been a while and you have magic fingers.”
“All right, I get it.” He turned to leave and was startled when Cas appeared in front of him.
“Nice to meet you. And Dean has every right to be rude. I was less than friendly to him yesterday. I wanted to apologize for that.”
“Bite me, Harvelle!” Dean shouted back with a grin. Charlie dragged him over to the tables everyone was occupying and Jo came over with some whiskey.
“Why do you assume I have a story?”
“Keep the change,” Cas said for him. Then to Claire and Jack, “We’ll let you two eat in peace and think about it. We’re home most the time, so if you do decide to take us up on our offer, come by any time.”
“Do you trust me?”
hear about that? I just had a meeting with him today.”
“Well, I don’t know anything about you, so how would I know? From where I stand, it’s fitting.” Cas looked down at his coffee. Suddenly he felt like he wanted to vomit. He fought the urge to get up and bolt. It wasn’t like he could go anywhere. The silence that had fallen over them was tense and uncomfortable until Dean said, “I should go. Sorry I made this weird.”
“I’m so sorry he did this to you,” Sam said. Cas smiled warmly.
“You think we can get past this?”
“It’s not even eight yet.”
“Whatchya working on?”
“No promises!” He’d done that exactly once, got caught, and had never done it again, but that didn’t stop Jo from teasing him about it. He picked his way through the crowd. He wasn’t dead set on hooking up with the older guy, but he definitely wouldn’t say no if asked. He found an unoccupied table and Charlie joined him a minute later.
“Thank you, Dean.”
“Well, you look like shit,” Charlie said. She folded her arms on the counter and leaned across it. “Spill, angel eyes.”
They stopped by a clump of trees and Dean lit a cigarette. Castiel followed suit and leaned back against a tree. Dean stood next to him, their shoulders pressed together. The warmth coming from Dean stirred something deep in Castiel’s stomach. He breathed out some smoke, trying to tamp it back down.
“Just checking.”
“You got a little…problem there, Dean?” Dean couldn’t even pretend he wasn’t blushing, but he wasn’t about to let Cas win this time.
“What if I just kill everyone off?”
“Thanks, Dean.”
“All right, fair enough. Thank you for finally sharing your breakup story. And I’m sorry your ex is a bitch.”
“Wait, really?”
“But—.”
“Sam seems to be extremely aroused,” Cas said.
“Yeah, yeah. I’m gonna kill Sammy for making me wear this.” He took his shirt off, put the vest on, then finished getting dressed. He walked around the bed and gave Cas a deep kiss. “I’ll text you if Dad doesn’t kill me when I get home. We can do something later or tomorrow.”
"Did you find someone to help you with your paper?” Dean found an empty table and sat down. Charlie sat across from him.
“How do you do that?”
Dean stared at his computer for an hour before he gave up. He couldn’t focus on anything. Every time he blinked all he saw were blue eyes and dark hair and it was driving him crazy. He got up and went outside. He had just lit his cigarette when the door opened. He looked up and his eyes locked on Cas’s. He smiled on reflex.
“Balthazar wanted to be Sonny and Cher, but he said Gabe was too short and Meg refused to be Sonny, so…how bad is it, really?”
“Sam doesn’t hold any of that against you.”
“I mean, I guess, eventually, yeah. I’m not really thinking about it right now. I’ve got too much other shit to think about.”
“And I reciprocated.”
“Yeah. I think you’ve earned a real lesson.” Adam turned and ran down the hall. Dean chuckled to himself. Yeah, the kid wasn’t so bad. He got dressed and went downstairs. Adam was leaning against the side of the building. “All right, kid. Hunting is the hardest job. We’re gonna take this one step at a time.”
“You remember where it is?”
“That is
“Hey, Sammy. Did you know I have PTSD?” He couldn’t hide the shit eating grin on his face, but it didn’t matter because, without looking up from the book he was reading, Sam said,
“Right.” Lisa opened the door to let him in. “It’s already boxed up. Shouldn’t take you more than ten minutes.” Dean blinked. He knew Lisa didn’t want to see him, but he hadn’t expected her to be so cold.
“Hey, Winchester.”
“We can’t,” Gabriel said. “Dad’s gonna have people searching every hospital for someone who matches his description, just to make sure the job was done. This is the only safe place.” Dean cursed under his breath before looking up at his brother, who was keeping a respectable distance.
“Dean did. I was complaining he wasn’t spending enough time with me, so he invited me and I haven’t seen him all night.” Cas chuckled.
“I really don’t care. Just pick something.” Dean shrugged and settled on
“Okay…” Something was happening here that shouldn’t be. Cas was acting like they were just two friends hanging out. That wasn’t what this was supposed to be. Dean had to take action before this went too far. He downed the rest of his bourbon and closed the distance between them on the couch.
“Hey, Lise,” Dean managed to choke out. “You look good.” Lisa folded her arms.
“Neither. I’m not
“You’re both idiots. Dean’s a friend. Besides, he never specified that the dinner would be just the two of us. It’ll probably be all of us at the Roadhouse on Friday. You’re reading too much into it.” Gabriel and Balthazar exchanged a look.
“It just seems like an odd name, so I was wondering if there was any meaning behind it.” He heard Cas sigh on the other end of the line.
“Meg!” the rest of the adults in the room snapped.
“There’s a reason for that. You broke up with me and you were pretty much a horrible person all around the entire three years we dated, so what makes you think I would ever wanna see you again?” Dean glanced at Cas, who smiled encouragingly. “Leave me, and my boyfriend, alone.” Dean didn’t wait for Lisa to say anything. He grabbed Cas’s hand and dragged him to the other side of the room.
“Just a little spell Rowena taught me. It should keep him out long enough for me to get him home. Thanks again, Castiel. You didn’t have to stay with him and you didn’t have to help me.” Cas only smiled and nodded before turning and going back into the building. He was immediately confronted by Gabriel.
“Dean, you let your guard down. He could’ve easily killed you.”
“Yes, we can. I made a stupid deal once and you broke it. Well, let me return the favor. I’m gonna break this deal for you, and you know why? Because I love you, Cas. I love you more than I ever thought it was possible to love another person and no Shadow is going to get in the way of that. You mean too much to me for me to lose you over something so stupid. Not this time.” Cas smiled. It was warm and genuine and laced with a certain level of pain.
“Don’t worry, Cas. You’ll be fine.”
“Who the fuck drinks
Cas sighed. He loved his cousin, but Balthazar was…a lot. Balthazar was a three-day advance warning, minimum. Cas wasn’t sure how much he would be able to handle with only ten minutes to brace himself. Another message popped up.
Please keep in mind that I literally know nothing about cameras or taking pictures and Google was zero help. If anyone who actually knows something about photography would like to correct me, please do.
“So you’re just avoiding me.” Dean cringed internally are how “heartbroken lover” that sounded. Cas shook his head.
“Isn’t that suspicious?” Cas shrugged.
“I’m fast and careful. There’s a difference.” Cas laughed.
“If I told you, it wouldn’t be a surprise. But I think you’ll like it.” Dean hoped Cas would like his surprise. He figured he would, but there was that little voice in the back of his head telling him that this was a mistake. He was trying to ignore it.
“Ow. Cas, your boyfriend keeps abusing me.”
Just us. Sam’s spending the weekend with his friends.
“Yes!” Dean was pulled into a bone-crushing hug and a familiar warmth began to bloom in his chest. He held Cas against him and kissed the top of his head. He was happy, he was content, and he was completely screwed. He drove Cas back to his apartment and went upstairs with him. Cas immediately walked over the basket on the table. He tossed Dean his spare kay.
“No. The vlog was your idea. It’s yours. I’m just in the background sometimes.”
“Shut up, Sammy,” Dean muttered.
“What do you think about ditching these guys?” Cas rolled his eyes.
“I know, but my species alone makes you wary and you decided to trust me anyway. That means something to me.” Cas turned in Dean’s arms and cupped his face, drawing him into a kiss.
“Right, sorry. Stop talking to the guy you’re traveling across the country to have sex with and watch a movie with me.”
“You think I do? You think I wanna see our family dead? I can’t do anything until he’s ready. If I try too early he’ll try to kill me.” Gabriel folded his arms.
“Cas, the whole point of this was for you to move on. It’s not like it’s that hard for you.” The words left a bitter taste in Dean’s mouth, but they were true. Cas folded his arms over his chest.
“Only when you do it.” Dean smirked and Cas rolled his eyes.
“Fine. You’re more than welcome to crash here, you know that. We’ll talk when you get here.”
Anyway, enjoy!
“Touch my fries one more time, see what happens.” Dean moved his plate out of reach. Castiel rolled his eyes.
“Good. I promise I’ll stop by next time.”
“Hey, fancy running into you here. Waiting for somebody?”
to keep his last shred of sanity from crumbling.
“I still wouldn’t go over there if I were you.”
“Thank you, but I don’t think my intelligence has anything to do with this.” Jack shook his head.
You’re welcome 🙂 Everyone should have a support system. What are you doing?
“Yes, dumbass. Both of you.” There was a pause and Cas was fighting the urge to go in for a kiss. They weren’t there yet. “Have you been updating your vlog?”
about moving in together and she still left. I haven’t known Cas long enough to be the reason he stays here. And even if he did decide to stay, I know he wants to go to California. If he gives that up to stay with me, a small part of him will
“Well don’t apologize for it. I’ll keep my hands down here. Promise.” Cas smiled a little.
“So sorry to have kept you waiting,” Castiel said, rolling his eyes. Jo came over and set a plate of chili cheese fries in front of Dean.
“I’ll draw you a map if we live that long,” Dean said. He found the garage and made sure the coast was clear before he got into Baby and started the engine. He handed Sam his phone so he could punch the coordinates into the GPS.
“Excuse me?”
“Nothing, Dean. I’m just…I have
“That entirely depends on what you’re about to ask me.”
“No, you listen to me. I have to say this. I have to get this out in case I die. You have to hear it. You…look, thank you. Thank you. Knowing you, it…it’s been the best part of my life. And the things that…the things we’ve shared together, they have changed me.” Cas stopped to cough, then looked Dean directly in the eye. “I love you.” Before Dean could muster up the courage to say anything, the door opened and Meg came in. Sam and Gabriel came out of the kitchen.
“Never let your guard down, Novak. That’s rule number one. Your enemy will always find your weakness and use it against you. And I could feel your
“And which is it this morning?”
“Talk to me, Winchester.”
“Tell me a secret.” Cas stopped sketching. He tilted his head back to look up at Dean.
“Maybe his dad asked him to keep tabs on you,” Kevin said.
“You make me feel safe, Dean.”
“You gonna answer him?” Oh. Right.
“Come on! I’m your best friend, you have to tell me everything!”
“Yes.”
“Aren’t they though?” Jack asked with so much sincerity that Dean couldn’t even be mad at him.
Balt says I have to get a drink with him tonight. Wanna be my buffer?
Cas waited fifteen minutes before he decided that Gabriel wasn’t going to text him back. He set his phone on the night table and pulled Dean into a soft kiss.
“Well, I’m here,” Dean spread his arms, “and I can assure you that I don’t feel obligated to be here.”
“You can go if you want. I can take a rain check on dinner.”
“Okay. I know this is a weird thing to talk about, but if you need anything from me, let me know. I want you to be safe.” Sam stared at him for a long time.
“Deal.” Dean left the cash on the table and they walked back to the garage. Dean folded his arms and surveyed the Continental. “I’m gonna start with the body. It needs the least amount of work.”
“Sweetheart, you burned Ramen. That’s nearly impossible. I love you, but you can’t cook for shit.”
“So what
“Hey, don’t…” he trailed off when he saw Lisa. “What the hell are you doing here?”
“You okay?” Dean rolled over in his arms and their noses bumped gently.
“Why?”
“Yes, it is, Dean. I don’t need your charity.”
It's almost 1am here, which means it's Wednesday! I'm updating early because I have to go to work for most of the day and I figured you guys would prefer this sooner rather than later. Enjoy!
“You need to have a real conversation with him,” Chuck finished. Dean sighed. He hated it when his friends used logic and reason on him.
“Oh, trust me, we are,” Gabriel said. “You just haven’t spent enough time with us yet.”
He wasn’t expecting a response, so he was startled when his phone buzzed in his hand a minute later.
“Come on, Cas.”
“I promise. I’ll see ya.” Cas smiled before ducking outside. Gabriel and Balthazar were waiting in the car.
***   ***   ***
“You too, Novak.” Dean let go of Cas’s arm and he walked away. Dean watched him. Something tugged in his gut. He turned and walked towards Baby, trying to ignore the growing feeling.
“I can’t help you.”
“Home,” Cas said. “Sorry, guys, but I actually do have stuff to do tomorrow.” It wasn’t a lie. Michael was supposed to be taking him out on a surveillance run tomorrow morning. He probably wouldn’t because Michael would rather spend time with
love with him,” Cas admitted.
“I always pay on the first date.” Cas tilted his head.
“We’re moving in together,” Gabriel repeated. Cas looked at Dean.
“Yeah.”
“Sam, please.” Dean was only a few more gentle words from breaking. He just wanted to leave it alone. “Just…please.” Sam seemed to get the message because he dropped it, but Dean could still feel his little brother’s eyes on him. That was almost worse. He got off the couch and grabbed a light jacket.
to live here, not someone who’s just placating me. I was hoping you would be that person, but I was wrong.”
“You and everyone else,” Cas muttered without thinking. “I don’t need help, Dean. I need time and sometimes I need space. Nobody seems to get that. I’m not trying to push you away, believe me.” Dean leaned against the bar.
Sure sounds good. See you Monday
“Leave it outside, Winchester,” a gruff voice said from behind him. Dean’s smirked melted into a grin.
“Yes, exactly!”
“I won’t. You’ve all been so nice to me. That’s hard to forget.” Cas pushed off the counter and went into the living room. Dean’s glass was full again. Cas went over to the table and poured himself a little more wine. Benny came out of the kitchen a minute later.
“Dude, it’s my kitchen!”
“Why?” Dean asked. “I love working here. Ellen and Jo are like family. You all are. Why open my own business when I can get a paycheck
“Well, it’s working for you.” Cas rolled his eyes.
“Oh. Shit, Cas, I’m sorry. I was just getting some water. I shouldn’t’ve left you alone like that.”
“Sam and Jessica seem set on Stanford as their first choice.” Dean nodded slowly.
***   ***   ***
“Wow, Dean. You’re really not subtle.”
“Yes,” Dean said. He leaned back against the wall and folded his arms over his chest. “You weren’t around for the first war. It was bad. Bloody. Dad’s just trying to keep us safe and I think he’s doing the right thing. I don’t like it either, but it sure beats ending up dead. At least you can get some more practice in.”
“There are also fewer distractions,” Cas said with a pointed look in her direction. Meg rolled her eyes.
“You can’t ever just let us have a moment, can you?” He tucked a strand of his hair behind his ear. “It’s good to see you, too, Dean. I missed you.”
“One more.” Cas nodded.
“Yes.”
Gabe it’s Meg. We will absolutely be there!
“Well, excuse me for missing my best friend now that he’s working from home three days a week.”
Just woke up. I’m okay. We can get lunch tomorrow.
to be alone. Sometimes I don’t trust myself alone, but I can’t be with my friends because they’ll keep asking if I’m okay. You don’t know enough about me to do that.” Dean gave a sympathetic smile.
“Well, I wasn’t gonna ask because I didn’t think it was any of my business, but I just basically gave you my life story, so, what’s yours?”
deserve pizza after the day
“Yes and I’m not ashamed of it.”
“Gabriel and Balthazar like glitter, I’ll just leave it at that.”
“Relax, we’ll be fine,” Cas assured him as the game got started.
“No. Gabriel, I can never thank you enough for everything you sacrificed for me. All I’m saying is, Balthazar didn’t live with them. He knew it was bad, but he didn’t know how bad. He couldn’t. He just went out to live his life. That’s all. He wasn’t abandoning us.” Gabriel finished off whatever was in his glass.
“You’re all idiots,” Jo said as she dropped off their food.
“Hey.” Cas stirred awake.
“I think she has a crush on Dean, but she’s too proud to admit it and seeing him happy with someone else isn’t easy for her. She’ll get over it eventually, but just be careful.”
“I really didn’t mean to bother you.”
Cas reached across the table and stole a fry off of Gabriel’s plate.
“Sure, Cas. Everything’s gonna be just fine.” Cas looked down just as Dean tilted his head up and their lips brushed together. Cas froze, startled more than anything else. Dean stared up at him for moment, his eyes still glassy, before he put his hand on the back of Cas’s neck and pulled him in for a proper kiss. Every instinct he had was telling him to pull away, but there was something else, deep in his gut, keeping him from moving. Dean’s lips were soft and pliant. Cas was vaguely aware that Dean was way too drunk to really know what he was doing, but he couldn’t seem to pull away.
“Better, I think! Watch!” Castiel watched as Jack performed the move. He smiled.
Bonus update this week because my friend is dying at work and she needs a distraction! Love you 😘
“Yeah.” Cas gave Dean one more deep kiss. Then he got to his feet and held out his hand. Dean took it and they locked themselves in Cas’s room.
“Yes, as long as the dynamic doesn’t change. I’m in love with you, Dean. I don’t know how long that’s gonna last, but I do know that, right now, I don’t wanna lose you.”
“I thought they’d stop doing that once they--.”
“If you want it so bad, come and get it.” Cas put his phone back in his pocket and got off the couch. Dean was holding out his plate. Cas reached for it and Dean pulled it back a little. Cas narrowed his eyes.
“Of course, Gabe, I’m not stupid.” Half of that was true. Cas wasn’t stupid and he knew the risks of unprotected sex with strangers, but he and Dean had had that conversation. They were both clean and they both got tested regularly.
“You’ll drink to anything.”
“Did you tell everyone we broke up?” Cas shook his head.
“What did Dad want?” He asked after taking a swig.
“Who’s that guy he’s with?”
“Let me take care of this first. Please.”
“Eating a yolk won’t kill you,” Dean muttered as he headed for the coffee pot in the kitchen. Sam didn’t say anything until Dean sat down across from him with a mug and the entire coffee pot.
“Okay, but we’re gonna do this slow.” Cas nodded and Dean kissed him slow and deep. “I love you, Cas.”
“I didn’t ask for your opinion.” Charlie crossed her arms.
“Way to make it obvious, Cas.”
Yeah?
“Dean, you’re thinking too hard,” Sam said without looking up from his book.
“Whatever.” In truth, Cas didn’t see them breaking up any time soon. He had never loved anyone more than he loved Dean. “What do you think?”
"Yeah, yeah, whatever you need to tell yourself.”
“Have you tried talking to her?”
“Let me have a drink first,” Dean said. He went into the kitchen and grabbed a bottle of whiskey from the cabinet and a six-pack of soda from the fridge. Charlie pulled all the pillows and cushions off the couch and made the customary fort in the middle of the living room. Dean sat on one of the cushions and set everything on the floor. He mixed himself a drink in an empty to-go cup sitting on the end table because getting up to get a real glass seemed like more trouble than it was worth.
“Yeah, so?”
“How dare you? I am
“Uh, yes, sure.” Jo sat in the chair across from him. “So, how are you liking it here so far?” Cas smiled.
“I love him.” Charlie tucked her phone into her pocket.
“Cool. Bye.”
“Those are my books. I told you I wrote under a penname so my parents wouldn’t find out. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you earlier, but…I’ve been around too many people who only want to be around me for my money. You’ve proved time and time again that you’re not like that. I trust you, so I wanted to tell you.” Dean sat there for a moment, probably trying to process. After a few minutes, he nodded slowly.
“Drinking. Avoiding awkward social interactions with people I don’t know. Talking to Dean.”
“Well, if you need anything, you know we’re here,” Ellen said. Dean half smiled.
relationships.”
“I believe I owe you a night of anything you want.” Dean laughed.
sulking. And he thought he had a right to. One stupid decision and his entire life felt like it was ruined. He never should’ve left Dean. He loved his cousin and his siblings, but he loved Dean, too. He also loved his friends, who now hated him more than Dean did, it seemed. He had received several angry texts from Charlie and Jo, and a thinly veiled threat from Benny. No less than he deserved, but it still stung. He’d been hoping they might understand. Of course they didn’t. Dean was family to them and Cas had hurt him.
“So just be on the same team,” Bela said.
“Oh my, God. Did a strip joint throw up on you?” Cas chuckled.
“Sure. See ya.” He rolled onto his side and closed his eyes. He definitely wasn’t going to be able to sleep now. He waited to feel Cas get up. Instead, he felt a warm hand on his shoulder.
“As entertaining as I find this,” he interrupted his brother, “I have to go.”
“I promise, Sam. I won’t do anything stupid. I just need a plan.”
Cas was losing his mind. He had every intention of keeping things with Dean platonic, but then Dean had been cocky and arrogant and it lit something inside him. That part of him that he was never quite sure what to do with. Cas knew now. He was going to turn this cocky, arrogant bastard into a whimpering, begging mess.
“We’re gonna need another milkshake,” Cas said, giving Dean a playful glare.
“No one really dies in this family anyway,” Dean pointed out.
“Okay.”
Cas let the camera dangle around his neck. Gabriel hadn’t once looked up and Cas admired his concentration. He knew it couldn’t be easy to work with someone taking pictures. He also appreciated that Gabriel didn’t seem to mind. He was about to wander outside when a slightly familiar face walked in.
“No, Cas, I’m not.” Dean sighed and turned to face him. “Are you gonna go back to your apartment?”
“Okay. ‘Night, Cas.”
“I can’t tell if that was a compliment or not, but I’m glad we’re friends, too.” Cas was smiling softly and Dean fought the urge to lean in. Instead, he picked at his fries. “Does your diet consist entirely of things that could give you a heart attack?”
“Believe me, I don’t wanna know this anymore than you want me to know it. Maybe we should change the subject.”
“I’m sorry. I’m happy for you, it just feels…I dunno. It doesn’t matter how I feel anyway. As long as you guys are happy, I’m good.” He got up from the table and walked out onto the small balcony off the living room. He really was happy for his brother, he just felt that their relationship was moving too quickly. Gabriel didn’t sleep around as much as he did, but he still had a hard time staying in a relationship for longer than six months. He and Sam had barely been dating for two. It didn’t seem like a good idea.
“Takes one to know one. What’s going on with you and Lisa?”
“Hello, Dean.”
“I’ve noticed.” Dean smiled. “I have no idea why, but I don’t mind. I appreciate that you think I’m that interesting.” He paused. “So, who do we tell first?”
“Three days, give or take. I kinda lost track of time. Everyone kept trying to keep my mind occupied, but that only made me worry about you more.” Cas had to smile at that.
“Cas, why are you like this?”
“Let me know.”
“Bite me, Novak. I’m only five minutes late.”
“How dare you? Leave. Leave my apartment. You are no longer welcome in my house.” Cas laughed.
“Okay.”
“Nothing to apologize for, Dean. We can leave if you want.”
“Come over later. I believe I still owe you a night of whatever you want.” That got a real smile out of the vampire.
“Oh yeah? Well have you told Cas about that time in the backseat of the Impala?” Dean stopped laughing immediately.
“Jesus Christ, don’t do that!” Castiel laughed.
“I think he went out and lived his own life. He was allowed to do that. I wouldn’t’ve been mad at Gabriel either if he had left. But he didn’t. He stayed until he knew he could get me out, too. It was an entirely selfless act that I can never repay him for. He put himself at risk to save me.”
“Delicious.”
“I--WHERE?” Cas got off the couch and walked over to him. He crowded into Dean’s space and slipped his hand into the back pocket of his jeans, his fingers digging into Dean’s ass. He touched his lips to Dean’s ear, his breath ghosting over the shell, and Dean whimpered a little. “Right there.” He squeezed Dean’s ass a little harder. “You’d love it if I just bent you over that table and fucked you into next week, wouldn’t you?” Dean’s breathing was labored and Cas chuckled. “Well, don’t burn dinner and see how far you get.” He backed away and went back over to the couch, knowing Dean had been expecting a kiss. He settled back into his original position and went back to watching Dean, who was busying himself with the steaks, clearly trying to act unaffected.
“So, we’ll see you guys tomorrow?”
“I didn’t wanna believe that everything we had together was gone just like that. If I told my followers that would make it real.” Dean smiled a little more.
“I’m fine, Cas. Just can’t sleep.”
When Cas got upstairs after his shift, he was nervous and excited. He used the spare key Dean had given him and unlocked the door. He stopped in the doorway. The floor and the bed were covered in rose petals. The lights were dimmed and there were candles on almost every available surface. The table was set for two with a bouquet of blue morning glories in the middle.
“And you’re the emotional equivalent of a weeping willow, what’s your point?”
See you Friday, Dean
“I’ll be down at noon.” Cas kissed him again and Dean didn’t want to let him go.
“I prefer my alcohol less colorful.”
“I’m not all that exciting either, though.”
He went with the second option. It was just easier. He leaned back against the wall and used his free hand to keep himself quiet. Two minutes and thirty-six seconds later he flushed the toilet and cleaned himself up. He walked out of the bathroom both incredibly relieved and a little guilty. The guilt vanished when Dean smiled and handed him a cup of coffee. He took a sip and choked.
“I don’t care. It’s bad enough that you’re friends with a bunch of witches. I don’t wanna get involved.”
“Ah. Pop quiz on what we did last week. Sorry. But I’m starting gun training tomorrow. You any good with a glock?”
“Oh, Sammy, you’re so cute when you’re angry,” Gabriel said.
“So,” Meg said after a minute, “that was Dean.”
“He does. He hasn’t slept in almost a month.” He looked past Cas. “Thank you, for not leaving him out here by himself.”
“No, Cas, please continue,” Dean said.
I wish I knew. Sam said he and Jess are gonna be doing college tours soon. If we’re on speaking terms by then maybe I’ll go with them. I know they’re gonna check out Stanford. You were thinking about going there, right?
“Oh, Lord. Balthazar might actually kill him.” Dean phone went off. He took it out and sighed when he saw the caller ID.
“Woke up, decided to get a drink, now I’m at my apartment. Just needed a little break. Everything good?”
“Your Netflix list sucks, Novak,” Dean said. He looked up at Cas. “Get me a beer?” Cas folded his arms.
“Whatever, dude. I just don’t want a repeat of Halloween.”
“You’re writing a book?”
“I know, but your water pressure is better. Besides, I have to drive past the hotel to get to my apartment, so it’s kinda stupid to go all the way there only to have to turn around and go back.”
“I’m a witch,” Claire said. “Jack’s my familiar. I didn’t know that when I first met him, but I guess I should’ve. I felt drawn to him.” Cas nodded.
Next update will be Sunday!
“Thank God you’re okay.” Sam hugged back.
“Welcome to Missouri’s. How can I...Cas?” This happened to him a lot. He would be bored at work and get lost in a fantasy world where Cas tore ass to Kansas to try and get him back. He was always jolted back to reality before it got very far. Cas smiled softly.
“You’re terrible with words, Winchester. It’s not weird.” Dean considered it. It felt weird. It
“We could move in together. If you decide to move out there.” Dean grinned.
“Are you sure? We can leave, if you want. They can finish the game without us.”
“You’re awfully impatient today,” Cas noted. Dean shot him a look that landed somewhere between lust and longing.
“Wait, no, Cas I’m sorry.” Cas just stared at him, looking like a kicked puppy.
“I don’t either, sweetie. Dean was sober when I met him. Sam’s really the only one who can help, and I’m sure this brings back bad memories for him.” Cas sighed. He didn’t want to bother Sam with this anymore, but it seemed like it was his only option. Charlie sat next to him. “I can’t believe you actually talked Dean into doing a vlog. He hates attention.”
“Tonight. We can talk at your place.” Dean nodded.
“Something you wanna tell me, Sammy?” he asked once they were in Baby.
“No rush.”
“I’ve been pretty busy at the garage. I fired Gordon because dude…I don’t know what his problem was, but he snapped. He kept threatening customers and me and…really anyone within earshot. I let him go after he brought a gun to work. He wouldn’t go quietly so I had him arrested.”
“Dean, you always say that actions speak louder than words. You can tell me everything I want to hear, but it won’t make a difference if you continue to treat me like a tool.” Dean blinked back another wave of tears.
“Took you long enough.”
“Not bad, huh.”
Dean ran the school. That would look bad for everyone. He also wasn’t attracted to Dean. Not romantically, anyway. Physically, well, the man was a walking wet dream, and he definitely wouldn’t say no if Dean was looking for a one-time, maybe two-time, thing, but they were too different for him to develop any real feelings.
“Anything you’re comfortable telling me.” Cas was quiet for a moment. Dean took the opportunity to really look at him. He was attractive in the conventional sense, but there was something else he couldn’t place.
***   ***   ***
, but you can’t know for sure. I can never know for sure.”
“All right, you know what?” Dean snatched Cas’s half-eaten cookie back. “No more baked goods for you.”
“You do have arms, don’t you?”
“I’m really not. I’ve spent the last three months missing you more than I’ve ever missed anyone. You blocked everyone’s numbers so none of us could get in touch with you. I didn’t know if you were dead or alive. I was scared.”
“And it never will be if you two don’t shut up,” Bela snapped.
“Sam, I’m scared,” Cas said. “I don’t know what to do.”
“Yeah, okay.” Cas smiled.
“Maybe. I like it here. It’s quiet.”
“Unfortunately, yes. What’s this guy like?”
Tailing Sam and Gabriel was going even better than Cas had thought it would. They had gone to the bar they had all been at Friday night and had gotten the perfect table. Cas and Dean were sitting at the bar so they could see their brothers, but their brothers couldn’t see them. Everything was going great. Except that Cas was finding it increasingly harder not to touch Dean in any way that could be perceived as sexual. The man was absolutely gorgeous and the beer he was drinking was giving him a quicker snark than usual.
“I have thirty kids in each class and five classes, do the math.”
“What’s wrong?”
“My car. She’s a ’67 Impala. She’s got a lotta history in her.” Cas chewed his lip.
“Not yet. Breakfast?”
“Don’t. I’m fine. I’m just gonna go back to sleep.”
“Thanks. I can redraw it by hand, give it a little more character. Think he’d like it?”
“How’s the commission work going?”
“You’re twenty-three, Red. You’ve got time.”
“You’ve killed unimaginably evil creatures and you’re scared of bees?”
“Why? What did you do?” Dean laughed.
“Oh, God, seriously? Did I throw up?”
“Meg, what were you thinking? You and Balt? Seriously?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas I’ve called four times. This isn’t funny. Where are you?
“Force of habit.”
He looked through all his sketches, drawings, paintings, watercolors, and digital prints. There was nothing there. Nothing that was worthy of his attention for as long as his assignment would take, anyway. He sighed, and gathered his papers. He tucked them into his messenger bag before pulling out his laptop. It was looking more and more like he was going to have to use his fall back plan.
Next update will be Tuesday
“Hey, guys! Today marks six months since Dean became the best thing that ever happened to me! Say hi, Dean!” Cas turned his camera on his boyfriend. Dean rolled his eyes playfully.
“You can’t be serious?”
“Good morning, Dean. It’s Thursday, where’s my muffin?” Dean crossed his arms loosely over his chest.
“How many times are you gonna ask that? Yes, I think he’s cute. What’s wrong with that?”
“I haven’t--.” Dean snapped his mouth shut when Charlie gave him a knowing look. Either he was being a lot more obvious about it than he’d thought, or Charlie just knew him that well.
“Because life is a rainbow!” Cas raised an eyebrow and Balthazar laughed. “They’re not mine. Redhead named Charlie brought ‘em. That was her slogan.”
“Why would I lie?”
Dean walked out of the bathroom and spotted Cas talking to his band and his brothers. Panic gripped Dean for about two seconds before he got ahold of himself. None of them knew. He walked over.
“Who’s this?”
“Everything’s fine, Cas. You want some ice cream?”
“Cas, I…where did you get this?”
“You’re still mad.” Dean motioned to the table and they sat across from each other.
He brushed his teeth, then took a good look at himself in the mirror. He actually didn’t look that bad. A little dehydrated maybe, but that was nothing a little water couldn’t fix. He went into his room and dug through his clothes. He found his favorite Led Zeppelin t-shirt, pulled on a pair of jeans, and laced up his boots. He grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge before he headed out.
“He won’t,” Cas said. “My brother is a child when it comes to most things, but he’s the most caring, loving, and loyal person when he’s in a relationship.”
“Probably, but you wouldn’t be you if you weren’t always late to class.”
“I know, but this is more fun. Spill.”
Cas smiled at his phone.
“I bet Sammy could make me scream,” Gabriel said with a wink.
“Well, you are to him. You should keep in touch after you move. He needs a friend like you.” Cas sipped his bourbon. Maybe he would.
“Don’t apologize. I’ll make you some tea and give you some space for a few minutes.” Dean got out of bed and left the room. Cas took a few deep, calming breaths. He knew Dean wouldn’t hurt him. He wound up the music box and lost himself in the soft music. By the time Dean came back, mug in hand, Cas had calmed down significantly. Dean smiled and approached slowly. He handed Cas the mug, careful that their fingers didn’t brush. Cas smiled.
“Oh, I know. Sammy likes him, too. I gave Gabe his number yesterday.”
“I…what? Aren’t you the head mechanic?”
“I moved here a few months ago with my now-ex girlfriend. Dog belongs to a friend. I’m just watching him for a few days.”
"Shit. Jesus Christ, how are you so good at this?”
“You’re not intruding,” Cas said, shooting Dean a very point look. Dean pulled out his customer service, I’m-smiling-because-I-have-to smile for the fifteenth time that day.
“Yeah.”
“No, I absolutely could, but if I have the option I would much rather have you with me.” Cas smiled softly. “I wanna make you the subject of every single one of my projects for the rest of my life. I want my most famous works to be of you.” Dean turned a crimson shade of red.
“Dean Winchester, don’t tell me you broke up.”
“Yeah. Go.” Charlie got up and made her way through the thinning crowd. It was almost ten and most of the people in the bar had class in the morning. Dean sipped his drink and waited for Charlie to work her magic.
“I will do my best, but I won’t promise anything.”
“Not at all. Most students just tell you what they liked about the class. I’ve had a few kids admit to having a crush on me.”
“Probably a good idea. Listen, I was actually planning on calling you today anyway. Jessica’s dying to meet you and everyone else and she doesn’t wanna wait until winter break. I put in a request for a week off work, so is it okay if we visit in a couple weeks?” Dean grinned.
“Off-limits as a topic of discussion while you’re here because you’ll just make it weird.”
“I knew I knew your name. Cas was in a couple of my classes freshman year. I’ve been following him online a little since we graduated. You seem to be the subject of a lot of his pieces.” Dean felt himself blush. He hated that Cas had that effect on him.
“Nothing, kiddo, I swear. We’ve got much more important thing to talk about, don’t we? Like dessert. I’m thinking pie instead of cake.”
“We’re not dating, Charlie. We’re friends. I don’t have romantic feelings for him and we’re finally at a point where I’m not worried about pissing him off. Just leave it alone. And tell Jo to delete that.” Charlie nodded and got off his desk.
Point. See you later Dean.
“All right.” He pulled Sam into a hug. “I was just worried. I guess I should get used to it. I can’t have you check in with me every second while you’re at school. You need to have your own life.”
“Thanks, Bobby. You mind if I do some work on the Continental until we get some business?”
“You took a big step.”
“I know. You’re awesome, Sammy.”
"Yes. My cousin would like a cappuccino.” Charlie raised an eyebrow.
“Sure. There’s a nice restaurant about a block from my apartment. I’ve been there with Gabe a few times.”
“I love you, too, Cas.”
Next update will be tomorrow!
“Let’s do it then.”
“Can I get you boys anything?”
“You bad mouthing me to the new guy?” Dean asked from behind them. Cas was hit with the scent of fresh cookies and turned around.
“Jo’s Instagram post? Yes. Charlie sent it to me last night.” Dean sighed.
I’ve noticed. My friend just kinda had his entire life shit on. Thought you might be able to do something with the sad puppy look he’s got going on right now.
“Hey, buzzkill.”
“I’d like that. I think it would be good for us to spend some time away from everyone else. You don’t have to move in, but I’d like it if you stayed here more often. With Sam gone…” Dean choked up. It was too much right now. Cas squeezed his hand.
“Jesus, Cas.”
“All I’m hearing is that you’re sleep deprived because you got dicked down by your supermodel boyfriend. Tell me I’m wrong.” Dean poured himself a cup of coffee and stayed quiet. He took his phone out of his pocket and texted Cas even though he knew he was still asleep.
“Pie,” Dean said.
“Well, if it worked that’s all that matters, I guess. They’re cute together.”
Castiel’s breath hitched when the guy he had been staring at caught him. He felt his cheeks flush with embarrassment. Then the guy smiled and waved at him. He waved back purely by reflex. And of course Gabriel picked that moment to turn around.
“Well, then. It’ll be an adventure.” Dean put Baby in gear and pulled away from the curb.
“Is your cousin definitely coming?” Jessica asked Cas.
willing to make a new friend though.
“Ever the wing woman,” Dean said sarcastically. He dried his hands on a towel and went back out to the front. Jack was just clocking in.
“I wanna move in with you. I’m crazy about you.” Cas kissed him, and Dean felt his heart flutter. This was new, exciting, and terrifying in the best way. “I’ll call Charlie, and let her know I’ll be moving out in a week or so.”
“Even if Sam were straight, I don’t think he’d have a problem with it. He’s your brother. He loves you.”
to. But he couldn’t. There was no one to tell that wouldn’t immediately start teasing him for it, and he needed to have a serious conversation. This was bad. It was very, very bad. He never should’ve kissed Cas. It had been almost a month and nothing was different between them, but Dean absolutely could
“Thank you.”
“How can you talk about this like it’s no big deal? You tried to kill yourself.”
Something warm curled in Dean’s chest at the knowledge that Cas remembered Sam had the SATs. He had no reason to remember that. It had no bearing on his life, and yet, he not only remembered but thought to ask about it.
“I’ve never been more sure about anything in my entire life. Will you marry me?” Cas broke into a grin.
“An engagement ring. Dean proposed last night.”
“I wanted to make sure we were serious first!”
“You want breakfast?”
“I will. If you can find a way to make it tasteful, we can do it, but I don’t want our wedding to look like Comic-Con.” Cas smiled a little.
“I kinda like it over here, but go. Have fun. I’ll be here if you need me.” Adam smiled.
“Understandable.” He clicked on one of his favorite Netflix specials. “Give it a shot. He’s funny.”
“How?”
“Coulda fooled me.”
“I’m sorry about last night. I didn’t mean to dump that on you. I never had any intention of telling anyone any of that. I’m sorry I scared you.” Dean shook his head.
“I was wondering if you wanted to go out with us tonight? I understand if you don’t, believe me. It just felt like things were a little better.” Dean looked at Castiel.
“You’re insane.”
“Oh, I was messing with Sam and he said he’d shoot me. I wasn’t sure if he was serious or not, so I got in one more jab then bolted.” Cas chuckled and patted his cheek.
“The best. I love him more than I’ll ever love anyone. Add that to the long list of reason my parents hate me. I respect Gabriel more than I ever respected them.”
“Hey, Gabe. You busy tonight?”
“Good.” Dean assessed the Continental. “I should be done with her in a few weeks. It’s really just details at this point.”
“I love you,” he whispered before slotting their lips together.
“Oh my, God, I can’t believe you guys missed it! Ash got up on the karaoke stage and absolutely butchered Bon Jovi. Dean would’ve killed him. It was so funny! I took a video, I’ll send it to you.”
Dean sighed. He loved his band, but everything just seemed like too much lately. Between the garage, training Adam, and trying to dodge Castiel, he was burnt out. He wasn’t going to disappoint his friends or their fans, though. He got off the couch, took a quick shower, and grabbed his guitar case. Tuesdays were usually slow at the Roadhouse, but Dean didn’t mind that. He liked small, intimate crowds. It made it easier to connect with people.
Dean never responded, but twenty minutes later, Cas heard the buzzer. He walked over and pressed the button.
“Sure,” Sam said. Dean put Baby in gear and drove to the movie theater. He took out his wallet and handed Sam some cash.
“No, that’s great! I was worried no one would be interested. I’ll make it work.”
“Can I?” Cas wasn’t entirely sure what Dean was asking permission for, but he knew he didn’t want anything to stop.
I would like to apologize for not responding to comments like I normally do. I think my jobs are conspiring to kill me. I haven't had a day off in a month. I am very tired. But I am reading all of them and they all make me smile. I love you guys. 💕💕💕💕
“You didn’t either.” Cas sat up a little to press a soft kiss to Dean’s lips. “We should clean up.” Dean shook his head, burrowing into the pillows.
I come back all the time.”
“That’s not what I meant. You didn’t do anything. She loved you. She just couldn’t handle whatever was going on in her head. It had nothing to do with you.”
West Wing door, take a right, behind the dumpsters
“You’re an idiot.”
“All right, but Sam’s…Winchester nice. Imagine…Dean times ten.” Cas blinked and Charlie smiled. “He’s like a six-foot-four, overexcited labrador.”
Cas stared at his phone for a moment before checking the time. He still had about an hour before he was needed. He put his phone back in his pocket and headed for the door.
“What?”
“Okay, I only brought Sam because he was in the room when I got the call and he wasn’t gonna let me go alone. I didn’t have time to argue with him so I didn’t. And I didn’t question you because you sounded scared. Whatever had happened was bad enough that you broke our deal, so I figured it had to be important.”
“Dean, I wasn’t trying to imply…I just want you to be happy, and I feel like that’s never gonna happen if you don’t leave.”
“Shit, you’re right. All right, so before that. My point was, I haven’t had a friend like you in a long time. I’m glad you’re here.”
“Hey, Cas. What’s up?” He didn’t sound happy or relieved or angry. He didn’t sound…anything.
“I thought you were here with your brother?”
“I have a question,” Gilda said after about twenty minutes. “If Dean and Cas are dating, and Sam and Gabe are dating, why are you on opposite teams?”
Gabriel was absolutely out of his mind, but Cas didn’t have any other options. Two weeks had passed since the press conference, the first debate was next week, and Cas was desperate. Gabriel had been keeping close contact with Sam and apparently Dean was slipping a little more every day. Mary Winchester had released an official statement saying that her son was being falsely accused and appropriate measures were going to be taken. Cas wasn’t quite sure what that meant, but Chuck had been yelling into his phone a lot more lately.
aware of was Gabriel sitting beside him.
“Students, too?” Dean nodded. His eyes were glassy and looked like he might start crying again.
Hello lovely people. Sorry about the slightly late update. My mom's birthday was on Saturday, but I had to work so we celebrated today and...let's just say time flies when you're drinking daiquiris.
“Thanks,” Dean grumbled, avoiding eye contact.
“Why does Dad want you tailing Novak? Which Novak?”
“Thanks, Cas.” Cas closed his sketchbook and snuggled into Dean, sighing as he drifted off to sleep.
“Mm. I’m getting up, I’m getting up. Sorry, you’re warm.” Castiel pushed himself into a kneeling position. Dean sat up, running his hand through his hair in a failed attempt to tame it. Castiel’s hair probably looked worse. “I’m going to go shower.”
?” Cas frowned.
“Gee, thanks, Cas.”
“Great. I’ll text you when I’m off work.” He ducked out of the coffee shop before Balthazar could say anything else. He couldn’t believe his cousin had the fucking balls to ask Dean for his number. Dean, who, based on looks alone, was straighter than uncooked spaghetti. Dean, who was way too nice for his own good. Dean, who could light up a room with his smile. Dean, who was the sole reason Cas had made going to Harvelle’s a regular thing, even though it was the furthest coffee shop from his job and his apartment.
“I think you just like smelling like my soap.”
“Pining’s more like it.” Benny nodded in Cas’s direction. Meg, Gabriel, and Charlie were all at least four drinks in, but Cas had been nursing his second Long Island for almost an hour. He looked like he was having fun, but he also looked ready to leave. When Cas got up and headed into the bathroom, Dean left his rag on the bar and followed. Cas was standing at the sink, splashing water on his face.
“We don’t do that,” Dean sneered. Cas leaned forward and pressed their lips together.
Forget the stupid book. Go out and get laid. You need it.
Great! See ya later.
“I’m really proud of you, Cas. I know how hard you worked for this.”
“Who works on New Year’s Day?”
“Because it bit him while he was feeding the ducks and he didn’t like that. So he want snake and chased it.” It wasn’t until she said that that Dean saw Jack curled around Claire’s shoulders, fast asleep. He steeled his nerves to keep from taking a step back. Claire must have noticed because she chuckled. “Vamp who’s afraid of snakes. You do realize how weird that is, right? I mean, you both have fangs. You’re practically cousins.”
“Sam told me what you wanted to talk about.” Dean tensed. He never should have talked to Sam. His little brother could never keep his damn mouth shut.
“I’ll show you when we get to it. For now, build up that wall.”
“Sam!”
“True, but you could’ve just kept your mouth shut.”
You home?
Meet me outside
“Dean. You threw up and stole a shot from me. That’s a
“My little brother has grown up so much.” Jack spoke up, clearly still confused.
(See the end of the chapter for
That’s understandable. I’ll talk to Gabriel about appropriate conversation topics for teenagers. He’d never do anything to Sam intentionally, but your concerns should be addressed.
“You told me you were only comfortable topping and I’ve always been a switch so I didn’t really think we needed to talk about it again.” Dean folded his arms loosely. “I know it’s none of my business, but I’m guessing this has to do with your ex?” Cas nodded, his eyes dropping to the ground.
“Why? I already have a job that I love and I get to help my friends out.” Cas considered that. Dean really was a genuinely good person. It made him smile a little. Dean furrowed his brow. “What?”
“Bye, Dean.”
“He’s blood, Sam. I can’t stay mad at him for something Dad did. He needed me and what kind of older brother would I be if I told him no?”
“Since when are you a party planner?” Dean jumped at the voice and looked to his right. Cas was leaning against the bar, a smirk on his face. He looked past Dean and smiled at Charlie. “Hey. Charlie, right?” Charlie grinned.
He pulled up to the bar and cut Baby’s engine. He took a minute to collect himself before he walked in. He scanned the room and saw Cas sitting at a table near the back, nursing a drink. He pushed his way through the crowd. Cas jumped up the moment they locked eyes. He closed the remaining distance between them and Dean caught him in a hug. He was still mad, but having Cas back in his arms felt right.
“I’m sorry, Dean.”
“Real smooth, Winchester.”
“I’m okay, sweetie.” Maggie put her front paws on his chest and licked the tears sliding down his cheeks. He kissed her forehead, then hugged her close to him. “He’ll be back, right?” Maggie barked once. Cas smiled a little. “Thanks, Maggie.” He held her a little tighter. Not enough to hurt her, but just enough to know she was there.
“Why?”
Love you guys! 💕💕
“Wanna go to the park?” Castiel blinked.
“Come on, Cas. We’ve got this incredible opportunity to do whatever we want. Live a little!”
“Yeah. Or, well, she asked my college girlfriend out
“Words are nice, Dean, but they’re just words. And maybe you do mean them now, but if your father asks, you’ll kill me without hesitation. It’s in your blood.” Everything in him wanted to snap, but he understood where Cas was coming from. He had no way to prove he was sincere. He had killed Anna for no reason other than John had told him to, but Cas was different.
“Took some convincing, but yeah. Dad told me to keep tabs on you. Didn’t seem like too much of a hardship.” So Dean wasn’t just hanging out because he wanted to. He had been told to. That made Cas feel a little better. Dean didn’t have an angle, he was just doing his job.
“You’re paying for that when we get home.”
“Not yet. But…I don’t wanna lose you.” Dean reached across the table and put his hand over Cas’s. “I don’t know where we go from here.”
“Does that mean you’re staying?”
“Get used to it, angel.” The name slipped out before he could stop it. Cas didn’t seem to mind it, but that wasn’t the point. They weren’t friends. They weren’t dating. Dean had no right to be giving him a nickname. And definitely not one that sounded so…intimate. Cas smiled as they walked back out to Baby. This was the point where Dean was supposed to drop him back off at his apartment, but…he didn’t want to.
“MY ASSCHEEK!”
“Saving the city isn’t enough for you?”
You sure you’re okay?
“CAS, NO!” Dean interrupted. “Don’t. And what do you mean almost all the time?” Cas shrugged.
“We thought you were dead, you asshole!”
Keep it up and you’re gonna be uninvited. That goes for all of you (Sam)
“You make a point.”
“Dean, I appreciate everyone taking care of me, but I’d really like to just get out of this bed. It’s boring.” Dean’s smile shifted into a cocky grin.
“I work from home most days,” Cas told him. “I need to get to my laptop at some point, but it can wait.” He paused, considering. “Or if you have one, I could just work from here. If that’s okay?” Dean was back to smiling.
“Does he know it was you?”
“Is that something norm--?” Cas pulled away from Dean’s grip and stormed back into the library.
“You waiting on a date or what?”
“Likewise. It’s good to finally put a face to the name.”
“Dean-.”
“That’s fine. I don’t like pain either. You seem to take orders well. Do you like that?”
Dean woke up in the middle of the night to Cas’s irregular breathing. That usually meant he was having a nightmare. He opened his eyes and rolled over. Cas was still asleep, but he was sweating, shaking, and panting. Dean gathered his boyfriend in his arms and kissed his temple. He softly hummed
Sorry about the late update! Sometimes I think my job is trying to kill me. Enjoy!
“In my defense,” Cas said, “I didn’t want to do this.”
“I wouldn’t say no.”
be an exception to that, true mate or not.
“Thought I was boring?”
“I hate you so much right now,” Gabriel muttered.
“I don’t know.”
“Yes. You make a very comfortable landing spot.” Dean was still laughing.
“Yes.” Cas tugged Dean’s hair again and angled his head to deepen the kiss a little more. Dean popped the button on Cas’s jeans and lowered the zipper. He pushed Cas’s jeans and boxers down just enough to pull him out. Cas groaned at the contact, which only served to spur Dean on. Dean dropped to his knees and looked up at Cas through his eyelashes, his eyes asking a question. Cas nodded and threaded his fingers through Dean’s hair. Dean took him into his mouth and Cas’s head tipped back, thunking gently against the brick. He closed his eyes and tried to keep quiet. He had done quite a few stupid things in his short life, but this…he never imagined anything like this.
I’m supposed to say that to you. Be good while I’m gone. And hey. Kiss the girl already. She likes you but she’s not gonna wait forever.
“Okay. You couldn’t just text me this?” Sam furrowed his brow.
“So? You have a nice smile and I’d like to see it more often. If I can make that happen, then I’m going to.” Cas smiled and Dean smiled back.
“It’s not a mess! It’s organized chaos!”
Dean headed up the stairs to his room. Today was the first day in months that he actually had nothing to do. He didn’t have to work and he didn’t have any training sessions with Adam scheduled. He had really wanted the day to himself, but Charlie had the day off, too, and she had been hounding him about getting together outside of their thirty-minute lunch breaks. He had agreed to meet her at the Roadhouse at eleven. He didn’t want to, but the smile Charlie had given him when he agreed was worth it. Dean opened his door just in time to see Adam sit up. He rubbed his eyes and blinked a few times.
“Clearly. Hey, why’d Meg call you Clarence?” Cas rolled his eyes.
“It just feels like a lotta pressure. I mean, the economy is in the toilet and the country’s being run by a carrot in a wig. I don’t think I wanna be the backbone of this country right now.” Cas laughed.
Cas spent the next two weeks systematically telling everyone he was leaving. He told Charlie first. He figured she would be the hardest to tell, other than Dean, so better to get it over with. She didn’t cry, but her eyes did get misty and she made him promise a hundred times to keep in touch. Dorothy was next. She hugged him and told him to take care of himself. Kevin, Benny, and Ash all gave him a handshake and told him he would be missed. He dragged out the goodbyes until the end of the second week. He had promised Dean he would give him a week’s advance notice, but he just couldn’t. Every time he got up the nerve to tell him, he chickened out. Now, it was the night before he was supposed to leave, and he didn’t know what the hell to do.
“Roadhouse. Ran into Dean. Talked to him for a few minutes.” Cas slipped his hand under the sleeve of his shirt and dug his nails into his forearm.
“Only if you’re sure.” Dean’s voice was gentle. Cas pressed the bottle into Dean’s hand.
Nope what’s up?
“Have I mentioned lately that you’re an idiot?”
“Why is Novak soaked?”
“Yeah, okay. One second.” Dean hit the first speed dial on his phone.
“Yeah, he told me.”
“Hey, guys. It’s Dean. Cas is making me do this. I don’t know why, but the smile on his face when I told him I would was more than enough of a reason to do it. I’m taking Maggie for a walk today. It was the only way I could get Cas to go grocery shopping, but I don’t mind. I like Maggie.” Dean panned the camera to the Jack Russell. “Say hi, Maggie!” Maggie barked happily and wagged her tail. Dean laughed. “I like spending time with you, too, sweetheart. Where are we going today?” Maggie immediately bolted down the street. Dean had to jog to keep up.
“But what if…what if he slides all the way back? What if he drinks himself to death?”
Cas scrolled through his phone. He briefly thought about texting Dean, but it was way too late for that. Or too early. Either way, the vampire was probably asleep, and even if he wasn’t, they weren’t friends. Cas had no right to bother him at five in the morning just because he couldn’t sleep. He put his phone down to avoid doing something stupid and tried to focus on the TV.
“You’re welcome. You want bacon or eggs with these pancakes?”
