“Greg.”
"Sherlock you are scaring me, what is 'this'?" Sherlock squinted his brow as if the world around him was lopsided and no longer a place that was trying to understand him. "John, I am and have never been good at being someones friend, I see all of their flaws and secrets laid out in front of me as clearly as I can see them entering a room. Due to this, I constantly feel the need to fix and sort and compartmentalise everyone and everything about everyone." John leaned forward in his chair and rested his elbows on his tired knees, "Sherlock I don't understand, you've lost me."
As they turned the street to the station there were approximately thirty or forty reporters alongside which were their camera crews and their equipment. They were all pacing and attempting to prepare themselves at the start line of the competitive race that was journalism. As a few saw Sherlock Holmes walking towards them they began their sprint. "Mister Holmes! Mister Holmes! Tell us about Delaney! Who did it? Any theories Mister Holmes? Mister Holmes, one comment please!" Sherlock said nothing and swiped passed them all without even a glance. John could barely see from all the cameras flashing and the noise was unbearable, John could hardly think. He was just glad no one was shouting his name. They rounded into the police station and were met with some relief. Detective Chalmers was particularly excitable and voiced so, "Thank god! They won't leave! Maybe tell them something so they go away, the noise is ridiculous." Sherlock didn't even say a morning before his questioning began, "anything new from the autopsy?" Everyone in the office, including the old owl eyed man who claimed that he was off to report them the last time they saw him. John gave an apology smile in his direction. It was met with a blank unremitting gaze. "Everything as you said Mister Holmes," chimed Olivia like a true professional, "it was amazingly one hundred percent accurate, everything you said, the stab wounds and the shirt still had detergent in the awkward places," Olivia blushed slightly, but it didn't avail her, "he had alcohol in his stomach, we don't know what kind, we have had no need for an autopsy here for over eighteen months, equipment for such things is therefore a waste of budget, but it smelt so and it was the only thing in his stomach, he had no bruising or other marks of any kind, here." Olivia produced a thin folder with images of the dead man resting on a metal table they had in the small hospital clinic not far off the beach. Sherlock didn't even look, he simply passed the folder onto John, of which John opened it and flicked through the grim stills. Olivia continued, "the doctor who inspected him believed he had been dead for only a day." Sherlock had what he needed so he moved it along, "and the interviews?" Olivia was confident in her swift reply and Sherlock acknowledged her as competent and therefore probably had a bright future, a rare conclusion from the allusive detective, "there were sightings of a boat, a fishing vessel saw a boat with the name 'Cleopatra,' of which we know was belonging to a James Williams, Mister Williams reported it missing around midday yesterday." Sherlock interjected, getting excited about the progress of such a case, "how big is it?" Olivia smiled, happy to bear good news, "it's one of the largest and finest boats in all of Minehead." With that she walked towards a board on the wall and pulled off an image of a boat, she placed it in Sherlocks hands. Deductions began bouncing around the detectives cranium. It was what's known as a Ketch sailboat. Two large white sails and one smaller sail at the back, making three sails total. It was forty-five foot long. Big enough for what had violently occurred, potentially not enough floor space for more than three living people. So two murderers, and the victim, most likely murdered on the boat, alcohol on an empty stomach would have made self defence difficult, even more so when against two sailors who stole the bloody boat in the first place. The mahogany planks to build the vessel informed Sherlock it was most likely built in ninteen-fifties Italy. 'Cleopatra' was written in a bold green paint along her flank, Sherlock imagined it may have been removed in an attempt at anonymity or precaution from the fleeing criminals. Shame. Sherlock admired it's artistic nature, a racing green with a white outline. Sherlock handed the print to Watson who raised his eyebrows and blew a short impressed whistle, which received a stare from everyone in the ageing office. Sherlock pushed up onto his toes before proceeding to inform all of the strangers, "right, we're off now, lovely case, thanks for the email." With that he headed for the door and John shrugged and followed, "wait Mister Holmes!" was all Olivia could muster, another officer followed suit, "you haven't solved the case? Where the bloody hell are you going?!" Sherlock spun around for the second time today, "we're going to catch the murderers." With that the two men were out the door, un-followed by the now stunned out of depth police team. John had files in hand and thankfully had placed the boat image behind the others, otherwise the reporters outside would have had a field day and it would have been a huge cue to the criminals to get a move on. The shouting continued just as before, "Mister Holmes! What did they tell you? What did you tell them? Mister Holmes, who killed Paul Delaney, is it anything to do with his racist connections? Fellow politician? Why was he here Mister Holmes?"
When Lestrade placed John on the sofa there was an awkward pause that was only made worse by words.
Sherlock gave a curt nod, almost embarrassed by the realization that he was still in his dressing gown, he tightened its cord wrapped round his waist. John noticed, of course he did, he notices everything (much to the impressed surprise of Sherlock- another person who notices everything, finally!!)
The upward curve of a smile on Mycroft’s face and the calm tone was deceived by the sadness of his eyes and the severity of his words. Brothers finally arrived at eye contact and Sherlock new he was in fact serious; this was no longer a game. In rivalry Sherlock really had lost the altruistic connection to his brother, yet Mycroft remained empathetic to his brother, always had and always will.
Like sassy fucking real
“From what?”
“Mycroft I was only a child, a confused and desperate child, please don’t use it against me like this. I accept that I often require some form of drug to stimulate something other, something unbeknown to me, it’s my head, it runs and runs and sometimes I need it to stop. You and I both know that. Work is all I need, I understand your concern, well actually admittedly I don’t, but you appear to possess it anyway, like the weak idiot you are. Rehab is for those who have nothing else. I have my work and if I leave, people will die and cases will remain unsolved. I cannot leave my work.”
The boss, who was clearly impatient and deemed this a nuisance but a cigar to his lips, and one of his crows, lit it in an instant. On the first puff of smoke, he breathed it into Johns face, (to which he didn't blink nor move,) and rubbed his brow with his left hand. “We know you are here about Eleanor Scott. Do you play poker Doctor?”
The Victim And For the General Justice
“Yes Sherlock.”
Apologies if any feels occurred.
They faced the mirror, looking at each other and analysing themselves. "Name?" Sherlock asked, "Detective superintendent Joshua Williams, yours?" Sherlock whizzed the syllables off his tongue, "Detective Lewis Williams, aged thirty-seven, we met when I was twenty-eight and married only two years ago despite such a long relationship, our first date was at the Natural History Museum, you bought me a ridiculous hat and I threw a penny into the Thames on your behalf and made a wish that only you know of, our wedding was elaborate and took place in a tiny village not far from Lille, it was rocky in the beginning and we faced our trials and tribulations, especially considering the fact that you are bisexual, but we settled down and work together by happenstance, we met as police officers and have made are way up until we are almost in the same position, we adore France, we have been assigned this case because you have a masters degree in American social science and wrote of Karl Marx, and the relationship between American Governors and their relationship with money, I am on this case because I am an expert on boats, having sailed the world twice over alone, and a very good detective, that one is not a lie but it fits as we are in these positions we are able to do so."
John gave Sherlock a questioning look, almost as if he was saying ‘you up for it?’
“Didn’t answer my question, is she beautiful to you John.”
John began howling with laughter. The nerve of man honestly.
Once Sherlock ended his speech John spluttered, “Sherlock that was amazing, you are amazing, yes! Yes to everything! What’s my move?”
Sherlock was happy with his progress with John and to prove a point he moved his King one-step closer to its castle attacker, from D1 to D2. He felt no need to defend himself in any capacity with John, he knew they were on the same side, somehow even whilst playing chess. This was so different, so new to Sherlock, everyone has felt like his enemy up until this point. John has been the first he has felt safe with.
AlL tHe SmUg GiFs
“Oh right yes” John blushed slightly, “erm, they are fairly sporadic, I guess depends when she works.” Sherlock continued to pace, “And the anomaly?”
Within a minute there was water and several straws placed in his lap. No questions asked. Sherlock had cut his head open with the force of his collapse against the thick plastic seat directly in front of him. The gash was large and deep at his hairline, he would need further stitching there now, as well as all the other make do stitching John had done back at the hotel. Most alarming however, was what John feared the most, had come true. Sherlock was bleeding from his mouth and his breathing was so slow and quiet John feared breathing would stop all together. This whole time since being reunited, Sherlock’s left lung had been slowly filling with blood and now it had reached its saturation point. It was forcing its way up his esophagus and had now reached his throat and was dripping out between his lips. He was dying from the inside out, John was aware that it was unlikely that he would bleed out if they got to a hospital quickly, the main concern was suffocation. He needed a tracheostomy, or a chest tube insertion, and he needed it now.
John's face contorted and Sherlock could see him receding further into himself away from Sherlock, from what he was hearing, even though there bodies were physically closer than they had been in days. "John I will always be a disappointment to you." John fell backwards in a slump so his back touched the chair and his entire form tightened into an obvious state of anger. As Sherlock continued to speak John could only look away from that mouth that spouted these words, "John listen to me, you like me now, you think you know me, you think I can be honest and present with you, but I cannot spare anyones feelings and you will get tired of both that and me, because knowledge and logic outwit all in my mind."
“Of course, but I do promise you John that you have not gone insane and I am one-hundred-percent here.”
“Oh?” John said post second bite.
spoiler, dead body in the next chapter.
Sherlock caught John staring at the magnifier with a question in his eyes, Sherlock opened his arms and impatiently said, "what?! I knew he was a big man so we need a big magnifying glass!" John put his hands up in a don't-shoot-me manner as a way of saying 'I didn't say anything, carry on ya' big weirdo.' So Sherlock did, he bent lower and began scanning the prehistoric device along the corpse. With a groan John got on his own knees on the other side of the body to face the detective. He began to look in his own manner. "Sherlock did you bring gloves?" Without looking up or affecting his activity he said only "bag." So with a further moan John went to stand, but Olivia grabbed the bag and passed it to the doctor. He said a genuine thank you and remained on the ground. John unzipped the bag and found a large torch and clicked it own, hauntily illuminating the now forever eternally still flesh, taking a pair of plastic medical gloves he pinged them on, he tossed Sherlock a pair and he passed John the magnifying glass, with which John put away whilst Sherlock pinged on his own gloves. They both sat for maybe a minute staring down at the body in almost exact mirror positions. Moving only there head every now and then to focus on something different. Olivia definitely was not comfortable with silence, "so what do you think then?" was all she said but Sherlock shushed her immediately, John looked up in horror and scolded Sherlock for his behaviour, "Sherlock!" The detective replied in his exhausting dramatic manner, "What John?! I need to think, there's no time to answer stupid questions!" Sherlock was evidently back in case mode, John gave Sherlock
feels
John finished reading and looked up, once again confused, "how do you know all this?!" Sherlock sighed, threw his hands up in the air and dramatically heaved "does it matter?!" John nodded violently, "yes!" Sherlock sighed once more and he said in a hushed tone making John have to lean in further, "Whilst you were getting the tickets, I met with someone and paid them for information." John jumped back into his seat, "what? How?! We received the email like an hour ago!!" Sherlock didn't move and spoke calmly still, "John be quiet, people are looking, I have been in this work for a very long time, I know people, I'm connected. There are people out there in every city globally who will find out anything for you, at a price. Whilst you were packing, I wrote an email from my phone to one of these connections. It's vital to this work, especially when time is of the essence." John was aghast, London truly was more complicated than he ever imagined. John just said, "right yeah. How do they do it?" Sherlock finally sat back, "no idea." John made a mock surprise face which made Sherlock giggle, "Sherlock Holmes, no idea?! Well I say, I might ring the papers! Because frankly it truly is newsworthy." They then began to both properly laugh in unison. A case awaited, an interesting case with a shit ton of leads thanks to Sherlock's 'connections.' The game was on.
Sherlock scoffed a laugh and John continued in the chase to further that merry noise, "it doesn't need to be big, it's not about size, a tiny cupid of a crab will do." Sherlock looked up from the rocks at his feet to catch eyes with the frankly ridiculous doctor he'd now proudly call a friend. He admitted defeat. "Alright John, you are clearly the expert, where do we start?" John smiled and excitedly tucked the file and photographs into his coat before zipping them in secure. He then rubbed his hands together before bending down to untie his laces. Head as close as possible to his feet John huffed out a "well, first of all, we simply must be bare foot." Sherlock rolled his eyes, pleasant at the humour this direction was continuing, "oh must we now" was sarcastically strung out from between his teeth. John with one foot now bare, removed sock shoved into its allocated shoe, a defiant "yes" brazenly reaped the sound waves. With that John bent down to remove his second shoe and sock whilst Sherlock followed, being purposefully slow which caused John to be bouncing impatiently on the flat ancient stone as he waited for the detective to also be barefoot. Once all twenty toes were free Sherlock placed his shoes next to Johns. "Follow me" John said with all the youth that befitted this activity, Sherlock followed, smile forcing its way upon his mouth. He led Sherlock to a rock pool maybe ten feet away from their abandoned foot wear, it was full of large stones that would require some determination to shift, but theoretically was possible. John dipped in a toe, the water was warm due its time apart from the tide, which was a good sign. There was seaweed around the edges, another good sign. Like a children's television presenter, John asked, "so Sherlock do you think this pool will hold us some crabs?" Sherlock began to laugh and said in a high pitched disbelieving voice, "oh for fucks sake John." This made John laugh now, alongside which he said, "shh! You'll scare the crabs away." Sherlock funnily cussed some more as John began his 'hunt.' He stepped daintily into the ankle deep water, the bottom of his jeans touched the waters surface, but he didn't care; this is what this was about.
John walked to stand opposite Sherlock so that the dead woman was in between them. It had been a while since John had seen a dead body, and he had to confess he’d never seen one this decayed before. The dead he’s been around had always been fresh, almost as if in sleep. Yet the woman before him had been dead for seven days, almost eight. Her jaw had started to hang loose, her skin was clearly dry and tight, and there was a definite aroma.
Sherlock still eyed up the letters. “Happens more than you think John.”
“Right, yes well, we’d like to leave right now instead.”
Lestrade added to the conversation, "I thought the same, he insisted even though I followed protocol in homicide and said it was just a 'chat' but he insisted, so he's bringing a fellow lawyer with him, a colleague actually, guy called Mark Warren."
Before Lestrade could end and Sherlock could begin Mary interjected.
Washed Up On That
He rubbed his free hand with his contorted brow. Both Mary and Sherlock could tell that he was fighting the tears. Mary placed her free hand onto John’s knee, which he took kindly.
Sherlock focused on the pages in front of him, “Oh not sure just picked it up really.” John was so enthralled he couldn’t focus on anything but Sherlock’s face, “people just don’t ‘pick up’ Mandarin Sherlock!”
The beach that stretched before them was arduous. Day brought the beach into new shape. The tide was put far at such an early moment of the day, white wash was at the horizon and it's blue lapped upon the rolled imprinted sand. Breakfast was more than agreeable to both Sherlock and John and gave them some much needed fuel for what lay ahead. Sherlock had considered several options on how to get to France. Without telling John of course. "John I've booked us to pick up a rental car at three o'clock to drive to Paris, so we have a few hours to kill. I suggest we..." John interrupted, "sorry Paris, and you want to drive?! I'm sorry Paris?" Sherlock stood on that beach with an 'of course' face and a whooshing coat, "yes Paris. The killers are obviously in Paris." John was bemused and stared out to sea in search of the answers, "But they went by boat? You said they went by boat, so if they did go to France most likely they'd have docked in somewhere like Calais, why then Paris? And why by car?! Surely flying is faster, you're all about speed and whatever and by car it'll take forever." Sherlock arched his brow, "eight and a half if there is no traffic." John rolled his eyes. "Why Paris Sherlock?" Sherlock placed his hands in his Belstaff pockets and took his time in his explanation, "if you had just murdered an American Governor and dumped his body in the ocean with a vessel at your disposal it's not safe to stay at sea. People would search the waters, because gold fish are boring and obvious. So they would go to land. On the water all you have to do is watch the horizon line until your target pops into view and then bam you've got them. On land however it's much trickier, not a straight line as you would in the water.There are other people and restrictions in your way." Sherlock spat the word 'people' like a bad memory, "Where are there the most restrictions and where are there the most people, easy, cities, we know they probably only took enough fuel to get them across the Channel, so they dumped the boat and boarded the train to Paris, why Paris? So you keep insistently asking. Time. The body only washed up yesterday morning and he was dead for between seven and twenty hours, most likely the lesser number, therefore by the time they reached France and left the boat and boarded a train to get to Paris, they cannot have got much further, they probably think they have bought themselves some time, we know they story is out. Look at the papers, that reporter. So you're in Paris, think you've got away with murder, then bang your victim washes up on a beach, what do you do?" John stared intently in the eyes of the detective, "run?" was John's guess. Sherlock scowled and raised his hands, finger tips clawing the sky line, "panic!" John's faced remained unchanged, "oh for christ sake John! If we panic we freeze, they stay where they are. Amid the sea of millions of faces it would offer comfort. Paris is romantic to normal stupid people, they'd stay and try to remain guilt free for as long as possible." With that Sherlock spun and began to walk along the beach towards where the body lay only mere hours ago. John was irritated. The amazingness was still there, but the delivery was starting to wain. John really needed to talk to Sherlock about his showing off. He paced after him, tight lipped before barking, "Sherlock that's all very well but your plan involves being in a car for over eight hours and you didn't even consult me." Sherlock swivelled in a quick whip, spitting sand around his heals, causing John to stumble, "John the car means we are only dependent upon ourselves, I imagine who we are looking for will run once they feel fear or know we are involved in tracking them down, and due to that reporter that will be imminent. Either you come or you don't, but I'd rather you were there." Sherlock spun once more and began to practically run up the beach in what appeared to be an attempt to run away from the very admission of apparent compassion he had just divulged. John remained dumbfounded, feet sinking into the wet sand second by second. Sherlock Holmes had finally admitted he needed him. A smile diffused upon his cheeks. He walked to Sherlock once more. "So what next?" was the only confirmation Sherlock needed to tell him that John was on board. "The police station and then the rocks near the end of the bay." John nodded and they walked in synchronistic poise all the way to the police station they had frequented only last night.
“’Charlie’ what are you talking about John?”
In delight or shock or god knows what Sherlock jumped up from his seat to his bare feet “John, John! You’re not limping!”
“Maybe.”
Immediately he turned around and descended the stairs once more.
“Alright fine, have it your way.”
Out For Yourself
salt linEd gut
John looked up from the foreign paper and spoke hesitantly, "our...job?"
John scowled, “Tell, me, how, you, know.”
Sherlock and John are chasing a case that's taking them across the channel to the French coast. Sherlock's boredom of being in a car causes some bristly discussion.
"What if they paid these Americans to murder Delaney, say they were his bodyguards or something, if Parisian congress is involved, then they may have known of whatever Delaney's plans were, hell he may have been a flight risk from the start, walked round for the past fifteen years with a big red 'X' marked on his back, if they knew he was visiting England to visit his mothers grave they could have paid a big enough fee to persuade these Aryan Americans to kill him off, makes sense then that they've travelled to France, pick up their pay check" Sherlock listened all the while, "Sherlock you were right, they are headed to Paris."
The first night in rehab was famously the worst. Cold turkey wasn’t easy. Sherlock was shown to the best room in the whole premises and Mycroft had sent over Sherlock’s necessities. Sherlock stripped off his clothes and climbed under the sheets almost glad to a small amount of privacy. Within half an hour he was shaking violently and the nausea was excruciating. Ten minutes after that his sheets were absolutely soaking from the volume of sweat that was leaving his pores. His body was working extremely hard to force out the toxins from his body. From that point on every fifteen minutes through the night an array of Doctors, including John would open the door just to ensure that Sherlock hadn’t done anything desperate. At around 1am John entered the room and came to take Sherlock’s temperature. Sherlock had already vomited into an assigned bucket by his bed several times and the exhaustion on his face was obvious.
John sprang awake for the voice attached to that sound, was all he had wanted to hear for days and days and days. He was facing the wall when he awoke and when he turned around the site that greeted him was horrifying and relieving all at once. John sat up to be eye to eye with Sherlock, who looked more than worse for wear.  John was sad, really sad about everything. When he last was by Sherlock’s side he was angry with him. Now Sherlock sat in front of him, chained to a chair with dry blood over practically every piece of visible skin. With his free hand John reached in front of him to touch Sherlock’s cheek. The touch made Sherlock initially wince, before he nestled into it, soothed by the for once gentle touch.
Sherlock interrupted him immediately “John I can’t think of anything I’d want more.”
On reaching his room Sherlock changed from his dressing gown to a purple shirt and suit trousers, not black but charcoal. Sherlock always thought presentation was a way of ensuring people didn’t know anything about you. It was a tool, a key to show whomever you meet that you are powerful. Sherlock thought dressing smart and rich was a way of intimidating and adding to his persona of a complete asexual intellectual. A man that you could trust with knowledge, but not with personal information that was unnecessary to logic. Logic that could have the potential to save lives. Often, Sherlock would be frustrated by the lack of information he could keep at the foremost of his thoughts. Hence why he created the conceptual Mind Palace. A practice that keeps logic to a computerized system; one that has a tested and proven success rate. If Sherlock were to dress like everyone else on a daily basis people may tell him useless information, things that will not add to saving people or providing true justice. Sherlock had to be good at what he did, he needed the work, if he wasn’t good at it, then he would not ever have access to it. That would definitively kill him. Now he was with John though, what he wore maybe wasn’t as important, especially if he wanted to work with John in the future. Sherlock looked at his bare feet and smiled.
“Sherlock your King is completely exposed, and it’s all your fault, why are you smiling?”
“We are looking for an Eleanor Scott,” said Sherlock as matter a fact as is possible. “Aha!” Sherlock pulled out the file labeling her name. He briefly read through some of the pages it encased.
“Erm, right, loss of blood, high blood pressure, muscle weakness, anaemia, rhythm disturbance, overactive glands, err, heart failure could be hereditary, or heart attack caused by a many number of things, bad lifestyle, diet etcetera, again genetic likelihood again, or it could be caused by shock, or…”
Loved writing this chapter.
John sat back relaxed, smiling also, “Good. Do you play chess Sherlock?”
The woman across from John typed something into a computer and with a confused look on her face said, “you are not supposed to be leaving until next week?”
Sherlock and John analyse some letters which lead to some clues as to who killed smuggler Eleanor.
"Sherlock!" There he was, John, seeming unharmed. Sherlock felt his gut untwist. Thank fuck he thought. "Hands up!" A gun appeared in Sherlock's peripheral vision. He did as they asked and walked calmly to John's side. "Very rude of you, I'm hear to retrieve my phone." It was flung at his feet, the screen smashed against the stone work. "Well this has been a waste of my time hasn't it." Sherlock loved this part. The talking to get them to give him some time to figure it out. There were two of them alright, both smartly dressed, but not overly so. One was blonde, died by the looks of it. He had manicured nails and was holding the gun with absolutely no confidence. His face was smooth, clean, and his eyes showed fear. He bared remarkable similarity to Paul Delaney. "What was the last thing you said to your father?" The gun shook more. "Shut up!" He barked with a bespoke American twang. "Sherlock" was uttered by John. He did not want them both shot. This could not be the end. The second assailant seemed stronger, less stressed. Less emotional. He was darker, tanned, his eyes spoke vengeance. Sherlock spoke to him directly, "you are the one that stabbed him aren't you? Your toy boy here couldn't hack it." His face became smug, confirming his guilt. "So what homophobic vengeance? It is so cliche. You wanted Daddy's money? You were cast out weren't you. Daddy never intended on paying into your college fund. Uh, I was hoping for something much more interesting." Sherlock looked at John, smug himself that he had figured it out. John grabbed Sherlock's wrist. It conveyed desperation. John wanted Sherlock to stop.
A place they've never been to and a murder like no other awaits them.
“Excuse me?”
“Yes it is.”
Me What If It's Too Late
Lestrade struggled with the scanners and the doors but he finally made it back to the window room at the very end and he found thankfully a very calm scene. He sighed in relief and exhausted. Fucking Sherlock.
I am writing to you anonymously with regards to a death. A relative of mine died all of two days ago and I am finding it hard to believe it was from natural causes. Her name was Eleanor Scott. She was 34 and I have knowledge that she was involved in some pretty shady business regarding illegal smuggling of an array of things, particularly from the East. Whoever she worked with paid her between £20’000 and £60’000 depending upon the item. After her death, I visited her apartment on Sycamore Avenue in Hampstead, to find the place looking practically ransacked. I think her death was a struggle. I don’t know if the police know she was murdered and are keeping it a secret, or if there is another explanation. Any help would be useful, I have a contact with Scotland Yard who will inform me of your progress. Any success will mean reward.
That is correct I am alive. Did you miss me?
Is Why, Sherlock, We
“What are they Sherlock?”
just dreamt
Sherlock shook John out of his complicated thoughts with "Gee' and Tee' John?"
If people struggle with the cockney, let me know in the comments and I will translate <3
John and Sherlock pulled up to 221b and on thanking and paying the driver, John hastily followed after Sherlock who had already entered through both entrance doors to their flat and made himself comfortable on the sofa. Their sofa thought John. He had splayed out all of the information they had on paper; all five letters, all photocopies, two bank statements, both photocopies also and the notes Sherlock had been making. All in Mandarin of course. On seeing the script John thought ‘cocky shit.’
John wheeled Sherlock up along side a row of chairs before seating himself down, and together they stared at the board, saying nothing. Waiting for their gate to come up. Their flight was due to leave soon, why was it not up yet? After eight minutes John was convinced something had happened, this was somehow a trick, a way to get them to believe they were finally going to definitely live before BAM! and the carpet would be ripped out from beneath them and they would be back in those cells and this time they would make John watch whilst they tortured Sherlock. Once more John was finding it exceedingly difficult to breathe.
John went to his array of books and picked out a book called “Cocaine: A definitive history” by journalist Dominic Streatfield. Sherlock recognised it instantly. “I’ve already read that John.”
John smiled, a genuine toothy smile. All of a sudden he could breathe again and his mind cleared of all that pessimism and panic. Sherlock would have his diamond moments it seems. Maybe John would just have to be a little patient and dig for them.
“John it’s okay.”
“He’s going to surgery you can’t go.” John tried to push his way past.
... sorry?
To find ones fate
Immediately Sherlock lit up from longest toenail to the highest hair on his head. He looked John straight in the eye and just began to uncontrollable laugh. Laugh and laugh and laugh until the pair of them were keeled over on the floor unable to do anything other but be happy. Once they managed to catch their breath, on their backs like paralysed turtles, they attempted to keep it together. “John that may be the best thing anyone has ever said to me.”
Maybe a bridge, no matter how quaint, wasn’t the greatest spot to try and gather his thoughts. Sherlock’s body going over, Mary’s blood on his hands, and that one random case where he’d thought he’d seen Sherlock’s legs coated in blue scales and a tail all flashed back, causing nausea to bubble up into his throat. He barely held back the impulse to wretch into the creek. Inhaling rhythmically through his nose, he fought the bile back into his stomach.
Sherlock and John had a very uneventful sleep. John talked in his sleep several times, however much to Sherlock's disappointment most of it was indiscernible. There was something about a bed, definitely a bed, and given the circumstances of unusually sharing a bed, such sleep talk was understandable. John was grateful to hear that Sherlock was in the shower on awakening. He did not particularly fancy that awkward encounter. What if he had bad breath? Worse! What if he had morning wood?! Oh god that would have been awful. Thankfully the hiss of the shower was bliss to John's ears. And even more than that, Sherlock was singing. Sherlock was singing in the shower. Really loud singing in the shower. Sherlock shower sings. John was learning more and more and he began to laugh so hard into his pillow that the force of it nearly made him fall out of the bed. John stood and tiptoed to stand with his ear pressed against the bathroom door to hear what it was he was singing. He appeared to be singing 'let it be' by The Beatles, rather enthusiastically actually. John was surprised by the quality of his voice, he supposed it made sense, his voice was a deep baritone always, so why not also in song? John was about to join in with Sherlock, but he stopped himself. It was going to be a funny way of making fun of Sherlock, John would have caught him out. Just as Sherlock had with John the night before about him changing in private. But this, this was different, much more personal. John did not want to make Sherlock self conscious in such a way. John wanted Sherlock to be comfortable enough to do anything he pleased in front of him, social deterrents were the opposite of what John wanted for his fast becoming dear Holmes. So he backed down, stepped away from the door and slid back into bed where he pretended to sleep. Eight minutes later, Sherlock walked out of the bathroom, wearing nothing but a robe. His hair sodden and droplets dripping from his hair to soak the towel like fabric hanging loosely from his shoulders. He saw John exactly where he left him, the sight of John in such peace made him smile and hum content. It was a shame to wake him up really.
“I’m quite used to vomit working in a rehab facility. Whatever you need.”
Sorry it has been a few days, been a bit busy, I hope you enjoy it!

Sherlock pushed up his eyebrows as if offended by the idea that John had thought him so stupid, "cannot believe you think i'd never thought of such a thing, I took my  I-V out exactly 12 hours before leaving the hospital so my system is in fact clean."
“Exactly so he’ll be interested.”
Sherlock in his complete isolation had apparently lost all cause and consequence of human, no John’s behaviour. This frightened him. Frightened him to the point where his mind went somewhere else, he was on a fast train that wasn’t stopping even though he was screaming to leave.
Sherlock gazed directly in front of him looking the most concentrated John had ever seen a person. He spoke as if alone, John wondered briefly if Sherlock did that alone, rolled off his ideas as if in a dialogue, even if he was alone. “The language also suggests that they are educated...” John shot a slightly confused look, Sherlock looked irritated about having to explain himself “regards, array, all of, knowledge, particularly, inform…”
Sherlock reached up and pressed the little button with the image of a stick figure to call over a flight attendant. A striking looking woman approached and she made John practically blush. Sherlock didn’t even seem to notice her beauty. She was so pristine and every hair on her head was in its place. “How can I help you today?”
“Amazing” said John before chuckling. Sherlock smiled at his Doctor before turning to Anderson with a stern look, “Anderson is there a printer with a photocopier in here?” Anderson practically jumped out of his skin.
John just watched him through out all of this. Lips slightly parted and eyes with almost a film layer on the iris, John couldn’t take his eyes off the detective. Maybe he’d gone into shock. Maybe it had finally hit John at what he was doing. They barely new anything about each other. Sure they had recounted events, things that had happened to them, and even if they were personal whomever you tell the story to, they are completely and utterly detached from it.
*dun dun dun*

Sherlock huffed and folded his arms as if discontent, as John put the box on the table and sat he saw Sherlock go into himself all at once. His body language was all wrong and his eyes were once again gazed outside, but not, in actuality Sherlock wasn’t looking at anything at all. He was in his head. They were only discussing feet.
John sat back in his chair and folded his arms. He placed his right thumb to his lips as if the taste would provide him with the thoughts he needed. Once the correct thought hit him he placed both his hands face down on the table as if to give him some grip on their discussion. He took a deep breath before his words chimed from his voice box.
Sherlock not looking at his brother harshly replied, “You won’t send me to rehab Mycroft. Your little brother being exposed as a drug addict is a scandal you want to avoid.”
There was disturbance in the hall. Feet marching with purpose their way. "Voici la police! Bouge toi!" Several voices shouted and the two guilty parties looked at each other panicked. There was no way out. The gun was dropped and they hugged one another knowing it may be the last time. The police arrived batons up, "se tourner vers le mur!" The two Americans were pulled apart and cuffed. The gun was collected and placed in an evidence bag. One officer approached Sherlock and John, "qui êtes-vous deux?" Sherlock stepped forward with an outstretched hand, "I am Sherlock Holmes and this is Dr John Watson." The officer took it eagerly and shook his hand with excitement and spoke with a thick French accent, "Merde! Mr Holmes, it is a pleasure to meet you! Is this about the American man who was murdered in England?! Merde, well come wiv us to zee station and we will talk it all out. We can transfer these men to your jurisdiction no problem." With that Sherlock and John followed the troop of armed blokes back into public domain. John could almost taste the fish and chips they would be getting once back in Somerset. "Fuck Sherlock, the son, I didn't even think of that." Sherlock placed his hands behind his back like a proud peacock, "Ah John, remember that you must not make me full goldfish." John smiled, "I vow never to do that Sherlock."
pRescribed forced cut
As he had watched Sherlock in that surgery room (the first time,) and he felt those pangs of butterflies, and as Sherlock sat beside him now, relatively healthy, John could say there was definite attraction. John would even call him handsome; only to himself of course. For the most part, John had been in denial about the whole thing. There was the initial revelation, but John had put it down to the stress and possible trauma caused by the capture. Some need to be close to someone he knew in an alien place, or maybe the doctor side of him took hold of him, Sherlock was an ex-patient of his so it did make sense. And besides, John didn't think he was gay, was he gay? He still likes women anyway. Many women throughout this airport even were paying him a lot of attention for a blond head in China was a rare thing. It confirmed to him that he still liked the attention from women. Attention from Sherlock almost always ended in John blushing. Maybe that was a sign, of some sorts. Essentially John didn't know. He has been certain in the recent past, but in hindsight, as of that moment, waiting for the plane to take off to London, sitting next to his friend, flatmate and colleague he did not know. John was actually contented. For once, not knowing was comforting. All he knew was that Sherlock and he were still with one another, on their way home, to interview a murderer. Perfect.
Sherlock had his hands around his coat collar held close to the skin on his throat as if something was going to strike any second. He was attempting to make deductions about the place and Dr. Watson himself but he was currently on a bit of a come down and it was proving to make things rather difficult. His deductions were more like benign assumptions at this stage. They entered a room right at the end of the corridor to the left. The sign next to it read ‘Dr. John Watson, rehabilitation expert.’ Sherlock rolled his eyes. Books lined the walls on either side of the doorframe for at least two meters into the room. They were sectioned and alphabetized under certain categories. The first was all alcohol related, the next parts were all dedicated to different drugs, all of which Sherlock had tried. John caught Sherlock eyeing the shelves quite intently. “Ah so I see you’ve spotted my weakness Sherlock. Can I call you Sherlock?”
John watched Sherlock read, watched his face calm and unravel into a child who was awaiting christmas, and in that instant he felt ready. Maybe just being alone in that living room, even for a second made him question it all. Hesitance is not fruitful for this business. He had to throw himself at this, at this opportunity, even if it does bring pain and suffering. No matter what he decided he'd follow Sherlock Holmes to the ends of the earth. To the end if ever necessary.
Sherlock and John smiled at one another and Sherlock replied whilst still looking at his Doctor, "Scotland Yard." John's mouth turned into an 'o' shape of surprise. "I thought we were going home, you need rest anyway, it's been a very long flight and you are still in recovery, and Sherlock I am very tired." John's stature sagged as he spoke. Sherlock interjected but still talked calmly "John you go back to Baker Street if you wish but I need to see Lestrade, I need to know how far this case has gone and where they are in this investigation. They may even be bringing the brother in for questioning this evening, but if you've had enough..."
Once again Sherlock couldn’t bring himself to speak. On reflection of their laughing fit, Sherlock had never actually laughed, properly laughed to tears like that. It was like he’d gone into shock; he needed one of those orange blankets the police gave out to victims. The shock had made him quiet. John was maybe someone he should keep around. He could keep up with a case right? The fact that his words were ‘take me on a case.’ ME. He wants to go on a case. He is curious, everyone else has been scared of the work, not that Sherlock has ever made the offer, but everyone has grimaced in horror, apparently normal people cannot cope with death in any regard. But John, John has seen it all already; he’s an army doctor for fuck sake. If anything maybe he misses it. Maybe he needs it just as much as Sherlock. Sherlock should keep a hold of John. He might be the only shot of a friend he had.
John chuckled to himself and looked down at his hairy toes. “Yes but in here Sherlock, in this room I can just be. People in rehab have too many problems of their own to notice my hobbit feet, besides you are the first to actually notice, or at least to vocalize the fact.”
Sherlock placed his hands behind his back and jumped down from the table with a surprisingly loud thud, the noise forced John from his concentrated state to look up from the envelopes to Sherlock who was now a mere foot in front of John. To the extreme that John had to crane his neck to look into Sherlock’s eyes.
Before they knew it, they were outside of Scotland yard. "That'll be furty' squid mate." Sherlock handed over cash before John could make a fuss about expenses. Raj handed them their change whilst using the rhyming cockney slang, "yer' lady and yer' shrapnel lads." They thanked him and whilst exiting the taxi Raj said kindly, "hope you catch em' lads." They thanked him, John arguably a bit too over the top, but it was definitely appreciated. They walked over the concrete, suit cases wheeling behind their heels. Then they were through the famous spinning doors and were understandably forced to leave their luggage by the doors and searched at security. On a successful entrance they walked to where they knew where Lestrade would be. There were some stares as they walked around the large building,
The taxi driver turned around and said “which one?” to which John replied, “doesn’t matter. Just drive.”
“I hate this job, day in day out people come in here smelling of alcohol or sheer uncleanliness because drugs have consumed them to the point that they don’t wash. And by the time we get to the bottom of it, the cause of all their troubles, it is always their parents, always! And then you, you Sherlock, you walk in, and it’s about your mind, the thing that runs the whole show, and I have never seen someone be so fine being taken off drugs, normally people are catatonic for a week, but one day in you are deducing these incredible things, if you are this way during cold turkey I can’t imagine what you will be like at one hundred percent! And you know what Sherlock, I want to see it! I want to see you running the streets of London solving murders. But most of all Sherlock I want to run with you! I want to see it all, I want to do things as important as what you do and you do it every day! Sherlock can I ask something of you? I completely understand if you say no…”
John moved from sitting to lying in a very awkward manner, and with one hand attached to the bed by cuffs he could do nothing but lay uncomfortably, but at least he was lying down. Almost instantly he crashed into a very deep sleep, for as of right now unconsciousness was all he craved, and he had not slept for a very long time.
The double doors of the hospital room had been flung open and John felt embarrassed to be walked in on like this, in such a personal moment. But wait, none of this made sense. Sherlock was in the bed, in the hospital bed, fast asleep, he can’t have moved that fast? And John was still in the chair?!
Sherlock placed both letters in his lap. John and he took a moment of pause to gather the new piece of information together and fit it all together on their mental map (or Sherlock’s palace.) John sighed and asked “what about your letters?”
“Just answer it John.”
Sherlock moved his hand from his mouth to point at the page furthest on the left in one swift movement, chin lowering in preparation. "See that one?" Sherlock practically whispered, John nodded a single nod, shuffling his feet in order to feel more ready. "It details a..." As Sherlock was just about to begin, the French man appeared at the door, a second cigarette smoking on lip, hands holding the frame in a tight grip, "venez, you going to be much more?" Sherlock lost it and his voice escalated to a loudness that would have made the wind change its course, "Yes we are, now go!" Normally John would have attempted to correct his behaviour, yet the game was on and all the mattered now was what was on those bloody pages. "Alle! Vous ne pouvez pas me parler comme ça!" He was evidently upset, Sherlock retorted back in perfect French, the deceit was over, "cela est une affaire de police si vous ne descendez pas ce putain de bateau, je vais vous jeter par-dessus bord, puis les autorités britanniques ont fermé votre quai bas pour toujours, tu comprends?" John had to stop himself from laughing, he had no idea what was just said but God it was fantastic. The man nodded fervently and his eyes spread wide like a rabbit caught in headlights, he left almost instantaneously. "You speak French?!" Sherlock rolled his eyes, "what the bloody hell did you say?" the taller man smiled now, "fuck off." John began laughing hysterically, the seriousness of before was all but gone and even Sherlock giggled momentarily.
(See the end of the chapter for
The taxi rounded to a halt and shocked Sherlock from his thoughts. "Nous sommes arrivés." Sherlock threw him about a hundred euros, it was all the notes he had, and left the taxi with purpose. He so hoped he was in the right place. Sherlock was not going to wait in that queue. He pushed his way to the front and used his fake ID that him and John had used on the docks to get aboard the Cleopatra. "British Police, my constable is in danger. And call the police!" He was allowed through and he moved as swiftly as he could down the windy staircase, shouting 'MOVE' as he went at the top of his lungs. There was an overweight tourist upset at the pace they was forced to go. Once in the catacombs, Sherlock did not take in his surroundings. He knew there was only one way through this maze, and it was from entrance to exit. All he could hear was John's name over and over again in his head, beating as fast as his heart. He moved through the maze of bones and forced his way past anyone dawdling. Where could someone hide here. Through a connecting corridor, he came across a striking sight. Skulls shaped into a heart. There were about four people snapping photographs of it. It made Sherlock's stomach churn. Something was telling him to stop. To the left of the mound of bones the skulls were formed in, there was a dark space, like a shallow  gangway to somewhere else. Sherlock was pulled in. He had to duck to watch from banging his head. At the end of the darkness, was a barrier, a rope connected to each side of the wall. I guess this was a point that tourists were supposed to turn back. There was a light flickering further ahead, he could not tell if it was flame or electricity. He followed it and a pathway with the same dirt floor and stone walls led to an opening ahead. The floor was upset, recently disturbed and Sherlock felt the hairs on his neck stand. He could feel that what lay ahead was exactly where he was supposed to be. The doorway opened to a large circular room. Bones were piled in a circular fashion, like a column supporting the roof in the center.

Fav line: 'John giggled, "I have never met anyone who has eaten ice like that before."
John and Sherlock find something crucial to a development in their case, and it's much bigger than either of them ever anticipated.
“Reading has ruined many of my relationships. I can’t ever seem to stop reading about my profession. I have an addiction it seems myself.”
“John.”
Stone
Molly then took a small key from her white lab coat left pocket and preceded to open up no.23. As her body was being pulled out on a metal sort of tray, John finished reading and announced, “by the sounds of it Sherlock the suspicion is justified. She has marks on her wrists, mouth and neck almost like she was bound. I think we should check her arms and jugular veins to check to see if something has been injected into her system. Has the toxicology report come back yet Molly?”
About six hours in neither were sleepy, even though it seemed the entire rest of the flight consisted of everyone asleep. They had to keep themselves occupied. “Sherlock have you ever been to China before?”
John continued to walk.
You And A First For Me. We Have
Sherlock shook himself out of his palace and said simply “business. It’s all about money. The earliest dated letter, only written days before the other, is arguing that Eleanor has been paid already and that she shouldn’t demand more money. Sounds as if she brought back a particularly risky item, worth a lot of money, more than usual, possibly she felt that she deserved more money for it and in asking caused a bit of trouble on the other end.”

John meets Mrs. Hudson and Sherlock finds a letter that could be leading to something new.
“It’s a private practice of course, I’ll pay for it all, and you won’t have to see anyone other than the Doctor you are assigned. He’s the best in his trade.”
“What has that to do with my treatment?”
John walked towards Sherlock at a pace and hugged the daft sod. Sherlock, never exactly used to hugging just sort of patted John on the back. Mary had relieved written all over her face. ‘Thank god for that’ she thought.
John outstretched his left hand and dragged it hovering over the board, pondering his tactics. He went right across his pieces and then moved a pawn from H7 to H5 before sitting back in his seat.
“You’ll thank me for it later. Just eat a banana and definitely drink the water. You would have lost a lot last night.”
“So you thought I would let the cat out of the bag?! One word Sherlock! That is all I would have needed! You are unbelievable! I visited your grave all the bloody time! I told your gravestone for you to please not be dead! I asked..”
“Sherlock, I don’t think this kind of sitting therapy is going to work for you, you need more, you are so much more. Your body needs a rest though, so I say stay here for a week or two, we need to get your weight up, during that time we can do whatever you like within these walls, we can talk, read, play chess whatever, but when I deem you physically fit, I think you should take me on a case.”
There is a little bit of autoerotic asphyxiation, very brief mention. But if it’s a trigger in any way be warned.
Sherlock ordered two more cognacs, and they wavered between comfortable silence, clever conversation and enjoying the smooth amber liquid. Sherlock studied John over the rim of his glass form time to time, the smoky sweet heat and John’s presence warming him in a way that was unusual, but not unwanted. What an interesting man this John Watson. He seemed well placed in whatever setting he was dropped into. He seemed well placed in Sherlock’s life odd a notion as that was.
John sat himself up in the bed, in obvious pain but unhindered and just stared, more alive in that moment then he’d been in years. More afraid then he’d been on the battlefield and just as in love as the first day they’d kissed in uni.
"Not your area."
No answer. Shit shit shit. John sprinted up to his room, (pain be damned) threw on some clothes and called Lestrade.
"Not my boyfriend. You may want to see John Watson on that score though." Irene enjoyed the look of shock on Thomas's face, before it turned to a twisted rage. He grabbed Irene hard by her upper arm and pulled her up on her tip toes.
On the plane.
"John." Sherlock's voice was imploring. He knew that John was going to pull the truth from him, he'd danced too close to the edge of it and John knew Sherlock's defenses were breached. All he could do was make a play for mercy. There would be none. John had seen the crack in the wall, and he meant to see it brought down. John fixed him with a look. Sherlock felt as if John had reached into his chest and taken a gentle hold of his heart. It was terrifying. It was John. "Are we a couple." John let the answer stand. He understood what it meant. Sherlock NEVER said a word when someone insinuated they were together. John had long since stopped wondering why, he'd speculated that it was because it made Sherlock uncomfortable, but John had never allowed himself to think about why. He had a good idea why. Actually better than good. He knew. Just as sure as he knew why he himself denied it so vehemently. The truth of it had been hard for John to face, but face it he had. And now it seemed that the young detective was ready to face it as well.
“Apparently he is. Sherlock’s blocked somehow. I don’t understand it either. But I did receive a message for you when I attempted the trace.”
"Yes John." Sherlock stood and was led from the kitchen by the man he loved for the second time today.
John had known the speech was unavoidable, and that ever bit of it was true. Twins and all.
“Thank you Odin.”
This chapter is dedicated to a lovely song bird at choir camp. Here's hoping this chapter makes your heart sing. And yes that was incredibly corny.
"Who do you think pointed your people in the right direction?"
"You're angry with me." Sherlock stated.
Administering CPR, was on average was no easy task. One can only imagine that it was made only that much more difficult when trying to see through the blur of tears and fight down a rising panic.
“My shoulder is infected isn’t it?” Sherlock asked sluggishly as the drugs began to closed his eyes.
“Bat shit crazy.” John answered good naturedly.
17. How do you feel in this very second?
“Hello Mercy.” John stood naked in front of the mirror with a face full of shaving cream.
Everyone perched against the bricks or leaned on a railing, a few sat on the ground, Sherlock stepped out and attempted to merge with the rest of the crowd, but Thomas’s eyes found him in an instant and cast Sherlock a look of smug nastiness that made his skin crawl.
"No. But you are most certainly a drama queen. If not you wouldn't have sent me this letter and your wedding invitation together. You wanted me here, in Northumberland (which also did not go unnoticed) you wanted me to stop this wedding didn't you?"
“No. We can be together later, because there’s nothing to discuss.” John nodded and pulled Sherlock in for a kiss. It lingered almost spilling over into something else. John broke the kiss with a gentle suck, teeth pulling at Sherlock’s bottom lip.
IIEA~
"John you just can't keep asking me questions."
The voice mail was short. Too short. But it was John, and Sherlock held that dear.
"He was found dead this morning of an apparent heroine overdose."
“And that’s me?” Sherlock was a bit sheepish in his question.
11:37am
Sherlock seamed to not understand the action at all and advanced again this time with more purpose. And this time John made it a little more clear with a little more force. This finally registered.  It was not received well. A tussle broke out between the two men ending with Sherlock planting a hand in the center of John’s chest and slamming him against the wall hard enough to knock the breath from John’s lungs.
Bullets fired at a constant pace, wizzing through the air unseen, muzzle flash and deafening sound added to the havoc all around John hunkered down low to the sand.
"Then I suggest you do your best to keep quiet." Sherlock covered John's open panting mouth with his own in a scorching tangle of lips and tongue that left John dazed when Sherlock withdrew only to drop to his knees and wrap his perfect mouth around John's cock.
"Don't." There was no question that Captain John Watson, did not need any help pain or no pain. Sherlock nodded and let John led the way, careful to stay well back, so as not to crowd him, and in case he stumbled. Once John was settled on the couch, Sherlock brought tea, which he'd made himself. John did not let this go unnoticed
“He speaks. Hello there Colonel Moran.” John never one to back down responded in kind. Jim, seemed to curl up next to Sebastian as he joined them.
Sherlock read from his tattered copy of Poe, for hours. Little sleep, less food. It didn’t matter.
“Exfill and recovery. High value target, British citizens and uranium.”
”Yes. Now will you help me or should I get Pope?”
"Well I thought you'd want to see it, so you could you know...deduce it or something."
Sherlock always loved returning home, returning to London. Nothing made his heart jump the way London did. Well nothing that is except John. Anomalous John. Exactly what Sherlock hadn't known he'd been looking for. The thought made him smile, London made him smile, 221B Baker Street which the taxi had just pulled up in front of made him smile.
"Irene I've done a terrible thing."
“Hit your coordinates.”
The campus was a buzz with the apparence of the mysterious "Truth or Dare Night" flyers. The flyers outlined a campus wide game of truth or dare and had been taped to the doors of various students, seemingly at random.
“What? I think it’s adorable how in love you are.” The chuckles spilled over.
“Reading the paper and drinking tea.” The man said in his defense.
12. Favorite fiction book?
“There is. Take your clothes off.” Sherlock leaned forward suddenly on the prowl. Now John laughed out right.
"For what a doctor? I'll be fine. You can patch me up." Sherlock nodded and helped John walk to the sofa.
Owen Lucas or Priest. Use to be my second.
John made for the cell. Oh god, please god please please please please...
John squeezed his eyes tight and pinched the bridge of his nose. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck! He really shouldn’t be this deep this fast on nearly nothing but Sherlock Holmes was everything lighting in a bottle wished it was. And John was hopelessly in love with every elusive powerful and brilliant bit of the man. And now John knew that Sherlock didn’t feel the same, all his beautiful stumbling over his words had made that much clear.
"Shut it while I think of my first question." John closed his eyes, trying to think of all the things he had always wanted to know about Sherlock Holmes. 20 questions wasn't going to be enough he mused.
“Fine. Say I wanted to see John. Too much has happened. Time changes people.”
John's lips pressed into a hard line and he clenched his fists at his side, quickly he spread his shaking fingers wide in a Herculean effort not to pull his L9A1 from the small of his back and pistol whip the living shit out of Trevor. When Trevor noticed John tremble he gave yet another shit eating grin and reached out to pat John's shoulder in offer of false comfort. And here was Trevor's fatal mistake.  The take down John used was text book, if that text book taught lessons on brutality. The hand that rested on John’s shoulder was wretched around in a violent one eighty  with the resounding snap and pop of bone and tendon. Trevor's eyes bulged in shock pain and fear, he buckled at the crippling raw pain and went to one knee with little more then a strained whimper, next John's knee connected with Trevor's chin, and the mans jaw made a horrible inexplicable sound, Trevor started to howl, but John wasted no time and silenced the building noise with a violent blow to the temple.
“Do you mean to imply that your sexual prowess is greater then my intellect?” Sherlock asked through mild laughter.
“Look, I have a...a...ahh...very dangerous experiment in the kitchen that could go  off at any second.” John’s eyes went wide in fake shock looking around the kitchen for said experiment. Sherlock didn’t know if he wanted to laugh cry or scream in Lestrade’s face.
“I...I...oh God John. Oh...fuck...fuck...fuuuuck I’m going to cum!”
"Yes please. But don't you try anything." Sherlock winked. John held out his hand and led Sherlock through the path of broken things on the floor to the shower.
John’s mark was to take out both perimeter guards followed by a series of flash bangs, his team behind him like the force of the gods. John had come armed and ready for whatever the Russians had in store. So the locked labs and bulletproof glass posed no obstacle for John’s .454 casull strapped to his thigh. He shot out the door locks as he passed stepping over the guard and tossing in several flash bands. It was hard to tell from that point who did what.  The hail of bullets and casings pining to the floor with a hollow metallic ring was a rush of pure adrenaline that pushed John forward to the lift doors. Towards Sherlock.
“Well, thanks,” John said, feeling equal parts delighted and awkward. He cleared his throat. “So, what started you playing for your neighbors?”
“That’s what you were looking at?” John muttered. He sat down in front of his laptop and turned the camera back on. Those full lips were tilted up in a secretive smile, making nervousness flutter in John’s stomach.
But… he didn’t want to damn Sherlock.
Their journey came to an end as they reached the very back of the cabaret, where there was a large wooden bar supported by thick brown wood columns. Men, in their dark suits and top hats, were crowded around, pushing in close to try and be near a woman who was seated on top of it. This was Henri’s Queen, then, and it was true, she looked as though she was holding court. Her body was similar to Louise’s, which was rather voluptuous and bordering on plump, but her tiny waist was cinched into a vibrant red gown trimmed in black lace. An impossible waterfall of red curls fell over her shoulders, perfectly framing her ample décolletage. Around her throat, there was a large black ribbon choker with a tear-shaped charm hanging from it. Her eyes met Sigerson’s, holding a sparkle that implied she’d seen the world and laughed at what she found. Her cat-like stare watched them as Henri pushed his way through the crowd, situating them at a far corner of the bar.
Mary’s smug smile faded and turned a little sad. She swallowed, averting her eyes to stare at the table. “You watched what you were meant to watch. I’m harder to kill than most.”
“I’m sure if you weren’t married, you’d still be just as much of a ‘rowdy townie’ as the next of them,” John told him. Bill laughed, but before he could reply they were interrupted by a kind looking woman with a blond bob. She’d clearly had a few too many and her husband lingered near, with a nervous look that suggested he was ready to haul her away if she said anything offensive and that she was known for doing so.
[What sort of work involves dead bodies?]
Which is why, on this disgustingly grey day, he was poised at his window with his violin tucked under his chin and his back to the door of his flat. He had already looked at the clues, solved the case at hand, and now he waited as his opponent moved their pieces into play. Such a pity Watson couldn’t be here to document the event.
“Well, you know how simply devastated I’ve been since my mother passed away,” Violet began. John knew well that his young wife sorely missed her mother, who had been a patient of John’s prior to her death. It was how John met his wife, in fact. He still couldn’t stifle his groan as he guessed at where Violet was going with her request.
Sighing, John rinsed and stepped out of the shower. He dried himself and then wrapped the dampened towel around his waist before stepping back into the main room to get some clean clothes, but paused when he noticed his phone on the floor with the notification light blinking. It buzzed in his hand as he picked it up and swiped it open.
“Yeah,” Silver Hair was saying. He led John out of the cell and started to walk him out. “He called in a few favors I’ve owed him to get you out of here. He says you’re imperative to his Work. I didn’t know he had friends, much less a colleague.”
Lucy Ferrier, wanting to talk. John ignored it.
dull, indeed.”
“No, I’ve already facetimed a mortician I know,” Sherlock said. “You are determined to distract me from my work.”
ago! You’ve done this on purpose to embarrass me in front of my friends. We’re all assembled and waiting for you!”
“Am I crazy? You died,” John said, his voice hard with accusation. “I watched you. I watched both of you.”
“You really don’t,” Sherlock said, and he grew more confident. He dropped one of his arms and turned the gun towards his own head. All John could think was that Sherlock’s reasoning was if Moriarty wanted his brain, he’d best damage it now? Panic flooded the ex-angel’s body. “And you were meant to be clever.”
“Dr. Watson, please message me back. I need to speak with you.”
He would never forgive himself for leaving Sherlock that fateful afternoon, especially after what they’d shared the night before. However, what was done was, indeed, done and it would do him no good to continue to dwell on it. John slowly gathered up his things, picked up his bag, and headed home for another evening of entertaining Violet Watson.
[Zoom? -SH]
“A harbinger? Of what, Death?” John asked, and she only laughed at him.
John frowned. He’d most certainly heard her in the room and when she’d spoken there hadn’t been any of that distant, staticky background noise that came when you put someone on speaker. “Okay. Sure. You know, I think it might be nice to walk around for a bit. Do you mind if I go get some breakfast by myself instead?”
“Ah! Of course! Billy,” John said, recognition blowing his eyes wide. He moved back from the door to beckon the two boys in. It was astonishing how much the lad had changed in such a short amount of time. Billy took a step forward but then seemed to remember his companion. He turned and offered gentle assistance to the fellow, helping him to stand up. Together, they made their way inside. John took the opportunity to look at Billy’s friend closer. His expression was petulant, bordering on defiance, as if he was challenging John to say something about their closeness. With dark hair and high cheekbones, John was reminded of someone who had been too much on his mind. “To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?”
, gentlemen, as there is so much of it in the court of her Majesty.”
“You- You are-” Fell was at a loss for words. The man’s temper was beyond infuriating. “You are barely functioning, sir. No matter who sent me, if it’s not an enemy then why should it matter? I am here to help you. The least you could do is tell me how to do so. And your brother
“To assume would be to guess, sir, and I assure you, I never guess,” Mettie hummed. “In addition to a few other small observations, your delight at your cohort’s discomfort told me everything I needed to know. You are not appropriately attired for visiting our establishment for pleasure, one does wonder what Henri was thinking, bringing you to me. I know nearly everyone that is worth knowing, therefore you are looking for someone, a woman. I know many women.”
“I’d rather not talk about it right now,” Bill said, taking a pointed sip of beer to remind John that he’d uttered those same words just a few hours ago. They were interrupted once more by the waitress bringing their food and slipping John one more wink and her phone number.
“It’s written in every blog post and story you tell about him. You just have to read between the lines.” The day was fading. The sky was turning from orange to a dusky pink-purple, twilight blue edging in and the spring warmth tilting to cold. “I bet you’re starving and I forgot to grab something for us for dinner. There’s a good microbrewery a few blocks over and they do a great crab smothered pretzel. Let’s go get something to eat.”
It made John feel like an idiot for enjoying the pretty scenery at the time, yet even now he’d give anything to hear that stupidly patronizing voice one more time. To see the quirk of those thick brows, the slight tilt of the lips in that smile that seemed to only exist for John, as though they were both in on the same joke that no one else knew….
After that, everything faded to black and John knew nothing else for a long, long time.
“No, I’m curious as to who told you that,” John told him. He shifted, tilting forward and folding his arms as he leaned on the desk. “What would make those marks in that sort of setting if not a whip or a riding crop?”
“Afghanistan or Iraq?”
The music stopped abruptly.
“I only just got here, Louise. I’m sure he’s here,” Henry said, and she was snatched away, a blur of lace and legs, by a tall thin man. Henri laughed, turning back to the two men following him. “The Glutton. Do not leave your drinks alone with her, she will drink them before you even realize.”
Sherlock chuckled, shaking his head. “You know that the appointment was a sham, Dr. Watson. I’m healthy and whole, I assure you, with all parts functioning as they should.”
“I know you’ve explained your methods before, Sigerson, but I’m afraid that I still don’t quite understand what we’re doing in Montmartre,” the petite blonde was saying in a soft voice. The much taller man’s hair was escaping his pomade and falling in dark curls across his pale forehead.
“It’s such a shame, she was so young,” one person wrote.
“He’s my friend, Dr. Watson,” Billy said. The boy decided to speak for himself at that moment. Through gritted teeth, he managed to get out his name.
“Okay. Why did you come here to find me?” He watched her every move, wondering to some degree if she was really there, alive and in front of him, breathing. It seemed like a continuation of his nightmares more than reality.
John pressed his lips together, his own brow wrinkling in frustration as he tried to process the question. “I’m sorry?”
“But she wanted out?”
John shook his head gravely. Slow and painful. Clinical.
Without looking at him, Sherlock gave one nod of the head. There was another brief pause.
Oh, fuck, he was already caving in and it had been less than a day. No, Aziraphale needed to be taught a lesson and that wasn’t going to happen with Crowley awake.
- Not beta'd or Britpick'd, and for once this is a gift for me, not Mags. I work in a medical environment in the US so I've been under a lot of stress lately, so the medical aspects of this are based off what I've experienced and might not be true in other areas of the country or world.
“Amazing. That’s not what people usually say,” Sherlock said. John quirked an eyebrow at the man on the laptop.
Fell allowed himself another glance around. He wasn’t a stranger to such places, per se. While waiting for his demons to awaken, he’d taken to all manner of distraction. He’d even learned the gavotte! He might as well give in to temptation this one time, for the assignment’s case, of course.
“Like this,” Sherlock rumbled, stepping even closer behind him. “Allow me to demonstrate.”
- Inspired by a true story I read on Tumblr that I thought was beautiful, I'll try to link at the end. But also a smidge inspired by the Bubble date people.
“Shut up, John.”
The usual warnings. I guess period typical prostitution and drug use? I'm actually probably going to have a lot of historical inaccuracies, so please bear with me, but I promise I did a lot of research for this one.
Existence was tiresome.
“Violet!”
It had been three years since John’s heart had been smashed at the bottom of the Reichenbach Falls, dashed and disappeared on those cold rocks with the loud noise of rushing waters all around. He had hoped by this point in his life he wouldn’t think of it so often. His nightmares of war hadn’t plagued him in ages and what was life with Sherlock Holmes but a type of war? It hadn’t helped that he and Sherlock- well, those things were best left unsaid. Pledges made in the dead of night and without an audience were hardly worth anything.
“You might be the worst demon,” Sherlock told him. “But you are an excellent guardian angel.”
“I just wanted to let you know that your one thirty cancelled, sir. It was a double so you have a pretty large break to fill,” Nadine told him. She flashed brilliantly white teeth at him in a suggestive smile. “In case you want to get some lunch or something.”
Crowley’s face was creased with angry lines, glowering as he walked back towards his own flat.
“You won’t be in the office tomorrow,” Sherlock told him. It was a statement of fact rather than a question. John nodded.
John tried his best to glare at the man, although he was fairly certain at least one of his eyes was too swollen shut to communicate the appropriate annoyance. “I’m a doctor, he wasn’t wearing a mask. I told him it was bad for his health. He should have listened.” And then, “I’m sorry, did you say Sherlock bailed me out?”
“I dunno, I’m really starting to warm up to the harbinger idea. Maybe my presence is just a warning that not everything is as it seems,” Mary said, watching as he slid his hand away from hers. “I was worried about you and how things were left. I needed you to know I wasn’t dead. It’s important, John. Not to mention I’ve read your therapy notes. You seem very hung up on the idea that we’d both passed away and you have to know it wasn’t your fault.”
He never saw the man that was playing. It was a man, he was sure, as he could sometimes see the tall, dark shape pacing around as he played, but he stayed far away from the windows. Sometimes, just as he had the first day, he saw the curtains move as though he were being watched before he limped off into the evening.
. He had a bookstore to run! And he’d already been gone quite a long time by human standards. Not to mention there was that awful business he needed to settle.
John’s eyes widened. Sherlock was
Summary: As it’s been a little while since I’ve updated, to catch you up- John and Sherlock had a ~moment~ the night before the Reichenbach Falls. Now, still grieving his friend, John is married to Violet who is very into seances. Meanwhile, Siegerson (Sherlock) and Fell (Aziraphale) are attempting to take down the rest of Moriarty’s criminal network so they can return home to London. They’ve met the enthusiastically drunk Henri de Toulouse Lautrec and a mysterious woman named Mettie. Crowley has been napping… maybe it’s time to ‘wake the snake’, as the youths say. Either way, Violet is about to throw a very interesting séance.
This week it had been Col. Moran. The old Colonel was in his late eighties and, despite being in a risk group from his age and other preexisting conditions, he’d continued to venture out on his own to pick up groceries and other necessities. When the group really started connecting to one another, John had taken up the habit of calling him sometimes to let the old man rattle on about back when he was a soldier.
“Hang on.”
“It’s certainly one of your many interesting features,” Sherlock purred. Offscreen, he picked up a cigarette and took a drag.
“Doctor Watson,” the man was saying. A thin smile pulled itself over his lips. “I’d like to speak to you about your relationship with Sherlock Holmes.”
“I explained to your receptionist that I have a personal issue only Dr. Watson would be able to solve,” Sherlock told him. He was reclined on a leather sofa, head propped up on the arm. His dark hair was wild and frizzing around his face, as though he had been running his hands through it while he worked through the case he was trying to solve. He rolled his eyes at John. “She may think it’s an erectile dysfunction. Your patient was transferred to the other physician.”

The cabaret itself had an immense auditorium inside, where everyone and anyone could mingle together. There were strings of lights hanging in draped curves from the ceiling, illuminating the crowded dance floor below. The auditorium was lined in secretive little alcoves that held round dining tables and shadowy corners. The temptation in the air was palpable, and for the second time that evening Fell wished he were in Paris with someone that
It sounded silly when phrased that way, but Fell had no other way to explain.
He was beautiful.
Perhaps he’d try a female corporation for a while? He admired the rougey color on his lips and imagined his hair long and flowing over his shoulders. Even though he’d never said so, he knew that Aziraphale admired his hair the most when it was long. He’d never been able to resist-
,” his wife said.
The good doctor turned to wincingly smile at his coquettish wife. While it was common practice for men to take a wife much younger than themselves, he often wondered if she was just a
What kind of man had a nemesis?
“Now, see here-”
Even with the mask that he was wearing, his overgrown dark curls and alabaster skin combined with piercing grey-green eyes were stunning. John was sure his mouth was just as perfect. His face shouldn’t have worked- his eyes were slightly too small, his cheekbones too high, but something about him -
“Bugger,” John swore, hurrying to his dresser to root for some pants at least, before Sherlock let him into the call.
The taller man, Sigerson, paused to light a cigarette. He scoffed at the words of the blonde man, sneering down at him. “If you’re having trouble following my reasons, Mr. Fell, then I must inform you that you are
“I’ve been listening to a lot of things,” Fell complained, his hopeful brows pulling back down into a disappointed frown. He sighed. He’d
“That- That’s never happened before,” the Madame murmured to herself as the table continued to rock. Red light oozed from under it, highlighting how very dark the shadows were. Or, perhaps, was it possible the room had darkened further? “Ss-Spirits! Hear our-”
Delete, delete, delete.
“I’m not scheduled. If someone is sick, of course, I could be called in,” John said. He didn’t want to promise anything, not with the plague looming over London. Sherlock nodded, eyes going unfocused for a moment.
“I’ve explained the case to you quite thoroughly, Watson. The evidence I’ve compiled against our good friend, Professor Moriarty, is in Lestrade’s capable hands now and his companions in crime are under lock and key,” Holmes said, but it was gentler than John had ever heard him before. Holmes detested repeating himself and, when he was made to do it, there was usually some edge of malice or arrogance. This time, however, there was a tenderness that John wasn’t used to. It only caused him to panic more. “Our conversation- well, perhaps there were a few things regarding my meeting with the professor that I may have left out for your own benefit.”
Lucy’s last name turned out to be Ferrier. She was tired of him ignoring her comments on the blog, apparently, and had unearthed his personal email and sent him a message to request an in-person interview. Journalists, gossip bloggers, they were all the same. They never gave up when they wanted something to write about. Pike’s popular Instagram was a never ending source of drama. Ferrier, well, John couldn’t find anything with a quick Google search about her but only journalists called Sherlock’s death the “Franklin Fall”, so he assumed she wasn’t any different than the others.
“And you hardly ate any of it. Most of it ended up in the bin,” Sherlock reminded him. John nodded.
There was a small creek running through the downtown area, with several decorated brick footbridges crossing over them. On one of these picturesque little bridges, John paused and leaned on the damp railing to glance down into the murky water. The reflection of the yellow sun that was painted on the bricks rippled back, twisting into something that reminded him of that sinister face from his nightmares. He shut his eyes.
“It’s more painful when it’s someone you care about,” Bill told him. John nodded along. “The worst is when it’s someone you love.”
John laughed out loud before slipping his phone into his pocket. He clicked into the virtual waiting room, waiting for the patient to join him. If the morning was anything to go by, it was likely to be an older person who hadn’t the foggiest as to how to use apps or allow permissions for phones or laptops to records. Most of his appointments had been him coaching patients through the process.
“The piece is not a thing, it is a person. A woman. Perhaps even
“You are, too,” Bill replied, patting John on the back. “Come in, come in. You’ve had a long drive.”
Their rooms in Sweden had been dimly lit the night before that fateful walk, which made John’s memory of that evening all the more foreboding and haunted. Holmes had perched himself in a chair, with his behind on the top, balancing with his feet planted on the seat, puffing away at his pipe like some dragon on a mountain, his mind hoarding facts like gold.
Bill’s mouth opened and closed a few times, his eyes flicked around the room, as if searching for something. He hesitated, then pulled his cell phone from the pocket of his shirt. “Oh, speaker. I- I had her on speaker. She’s still out. Um, at work, I mean.”
“Gideon.”
“Who said anything about love?” John asked, letting the smile fade from his face.
“No, no, of course, that’s me,” John groaned. He swung his feet over the side of the bed, wincing as his head throbbed. The policeman was chuckling at him.
The doorbell clattered as he slammed his way out of the shop. He’d forgotten all about the coffee. He wanted to forget about everything.
Perhaps she did not. Men lost dear friends all the time, and in horrifying ways. He knew that from his days in the army as well, but Sherlock… Well, it did not do to dwell on it.
“Oh yeah? What do they usually say?”
It was a lot like being stabbed by Sebastian, actually. His human form leaked red blood onto dusty sand. Losing his body would be interesting, but it hurt, and he hadn’t expected that.
He grinned. Apparently this was an every afternoon sort of performance. John’s eyes glanced back up at the window in time to see the curtains flutter, like someone had been watching him and moved away quickly. John nodded. He’d be back again tomorrow.
“He’s my
* “John couldn’t figure out what he said that pleased Sherlock so well” - He said love, FYI.
Snap.
“You’re a kind man, Bill. You mean well enough, but you should take your own advice. It’s time to move on,” Trudy said. She sighed. “That part about reading between the lines, though. I’m surprised he didn’t deck you. The old Captain Watson would have had your balls for that. And since when do you pay attention to subtext?”
“John, I spent several years working for a criminal mastermind. Tracking your phone location is the least impressive thing I can do,” Mary told him. He scowled at her and tried another question.
“You were one of us, Seb- ah,” John accused, gritting his teeth at whatever evil enchantment was working its way through his form. He felt the toxin seeping across his aura, paralyzing him with pain. Sebastian laughed at him and then made a slice in John’s leg, sending a fresh venomous wave through him. The smaller angel cried out.
John grinned to himself, not noticing any pain in his leg as he started the walk home.
John considered that, with his lips pressed tight with stress. It had been a long time since he’d left the city. Definitely before Sherlock had- well, that was over a year ago, so it had to be long before that. A drive down to Maryland and spending the weekend with a friend sounded like just what the doctor ordered.
“Do you have many vices?”
John squeezed his eyes shut, but he couldn’t escape the vision of that face.
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John, placing his hands over where John’s heart would be if he actually had one. Everything changed. The blisters faded, the blood soaked back into John’s skin and his eyes turned an alarming shade of blue; one that John had only seen in the Above Place. A light began to shine, dusting over John’s skin and through his eyes, and it was bright. Even his wings didn’t look so very black. Sherlock grinned.
“Okay, that’s enough, dear. Let’s go,” her husband Also Jon said, dragging the woman off while she was still babbling. He cast an apologetic look at the table before they left.
“You’re not really on social media much. It was um, a relative. Cancer,” Bill said, shifting uneasily in his chair.
“Well, hello again, Watson,” Moriarty said, appearing in a swirl of black sand. He gazed down at John with sharp teeth and crazed black eyes. “Oh, dear. You’ve gone and damaged your body.
“Well, you’ve got to. Time to go home,” the man was saying. John pushed himself up onto his elbows to look at the guy who was talking to him. He vaguely remembered being put in the holding cell and his face felt swollen beyond belief. Through bleary eyes, he could make out a handsome silver-haired man in a decent enough suit grinning at him. Or, John assumed he was smiling. The mask he was wearing hid a bit of his face, but his eyes had a sarcastic, humorous edge. “You must be special for his Nibs to bail you out.”
The late hours took their toll on John and he overslept. He hadn’t noticed through his excitement the night before that he was exhausted. His bones ached with it, pulling him into a numb, coma-like slumber he couldn’t shake. Even when he woke, he stayed in bed, groggy and contemplative. His first thought upon opening his eyes was to call Sherlock but what would he even say? Was he overreacting? He lay staring at the ceiling, thinking over what had transpired the night before.
“And you are looking for a woman but I am not she,” Mettie said, grinning at him.
“N-No-” But John wasn’t so sure. James was very, very good at tempting and John didn’t want to die. Sure enough, though, across the fields of blue sky and fluff, he could see the dark figure with no side but his own looming, reaping angels and demons alike, but coming in John’s general direction. He swallowed, feeling his wings twitching beneath him.
avoiding someone who also lived there and, as his military days had taught him, stealth was sometimes necessary in delicate missions. Such as going to work.
. As the afternoon continued to drag towards it’s inevitable conclusion, John had to admit to himself that he was quite…
“He was concerned that you would not be able to look after yourself and from what I’ve seen his fears are entirely realized,” Fell sniffed, annoyed at Sigerson, whose mouth was already curling up at the corners in the nasty facsimile of a smile.
“I do believe, Miss Mettie, that we could make some sort of arrangement. I would have to view the messages in question, of course,” Sigerson said. Mettie nodded.
“Thanks for letting me know,” John said, returning her overly-friendly smile with a grateful one. He dreaded having such a wide gap of time in his schedule. Gaps allowed those invasive little memories to creep back into his mind, forcing him to relive all of the events of the past. Nadine smiled at him once more, a little disappointed that he didn’t seem inclined to have lunch with her, and she left, closing the door behind her.
“Look, Bill, you don’t need to explain-”
With a heavy sigh, he braced himself for what was going to be an awkward breakfast with Bill. Back in his room, he stripped out of his flannel pyjama bottoms and tee shirt, trading them for thick jeans, feeling the heavy denim scrape over his thighs as he pulled them up. He remembered a time at Baker Street where Sherlock had criticised his department store fashion sense, specifically how rough the fibers of his jeans were. At the time, all he’d been able to do was imagine Sherlock’s long fingers stroking over his legs. It never happened, but it was a nice image to have at the time. With a clean tee shirt and sweater thrown on, John trotted downstairs in search of his friend and a morning meal. He could hear Bill and Trudy in the kitchen, and he paused just outside of the door when he heard his name.
“Same spot, too. Tut, tut, dearie,” Moriarty grinned. “Sebby must just have a lot of nostalgia for that particular shoulder.”
“Henri, mon ange,” she purred, after she’d stood up and walked down the bar, her boots tapping on the wooden surface. She seated herself again, smoothing over her skirts, and then she bent to press a sweet kiss on the small man’s cheek. “To what do I owe the pleasure? I do assume you’ve brought me this handsome specimen for pleasure, after all.”
Sherlock would scold him for being so sentimental. For having emotions, like a normal human being. For missing him, probably. Frustrated, John rolled over and picked up his phone. Bill was right, John mostly avoided social media, but here he was, in the dark, scrolling over his friend’s profile to see if there was any mention of the relative who’d died. Bill’s profile was actually pretty sparse, until about seven months ago when one or two people mentioned the funeral. John frowned.
He stood and began the ritual of closing for the afternoon. With someone as competent as Miss Addington working for him, it was a short ritual indeed and all he really needed to do was walk to the coat rack near the door, slide his coat on and take his medical bag before locking up.
“Which way is that, because I’m going back to Philly,” John told her. She slid in, closing the door behind her. He watched her buckle her seatbelt before he pulled off again, threading his way back into traffic.
“Shut up, it wasn’t like that,” he said. He squinted as the sun shone through the clouds, brightening up the park even more. “Are you hungry? We should eat.”
Insurance!
“If something should,” Sherlock said. “I would rather you know all of my secrets than die having lived a lie. Not with you, John. Not with the man who knows me better than any other.”
“Yes, Holmes, you’ve said. Several times,” John pointed out, eyebrows raised.
“Hmm?” John asked.
“What are you-”
The flustered Fell huffed but then decided to admit, “I am anxious to return home and I cannot do that until our- our journey is complete.”
She shook her head. “No, sir. I’ve finished tidying up for the day and wondered if there was anything else you might require before I go home for the day.”
John helps Summon a Demon
“I’ll see you Thursday, John,” the man said, turning to go back inside.
“No. I should have thought that you, of all people, would know how I feel. You may not wish to speak of it, John, but I know there is someone you also long for,” Violet ground out between sulky, clenched teeth. Her eyes accused him of something he dare not name.
The American who refused to wear a mask should have fucking known better, anyway.
“Lucy. And you never answered my messages,” the dead woman told him. She motioned to the chair in front of her, beckoning for him to join her at her table. He did, but only because he felt his leg begin to throb and he was unsure if he’d remain standing. He was, after all, seeing a ghost.
The silver-man snickered and then regarded John, taking him in with a thoughtful expression. “You know, maybe after all this is over, we could grab a pint sometime and I’ll tell you all about how right you really are.”
Thank you for reading!
[I never claimed to be sweet and that has no bearing on the case. -SH]
“It was busy, wasn’t it? I’m perfectly fine, just doing a bit of daydreaming while I had a moment of peace. Is there another patient?”
“That is a conversation for a time when you don’t want to be distracted from your work,” John pretended to scold. “Your appointment is almost over, Mr. Holmes, and we’re no closer to solving your murder or erectile disfunction.”
Except, that if John were being honest with himself, he’d be forced to admit that he was already just a tiny bit in love with the man.
“That is what your friend will be saying. Repeatedly,” Henri giggled.
(See the end of the chapter for
Emergencies! That’s what the whole fight had been about, anyway! It was one thing to ignore the angel on a lark but a wholly other thing to be so out of it that he couldn’t dive in for an exciting rescue if need be. Alright, sleep, but with ‘one ear open’ so to speak. Leave a bit of his consciousness floating about in case the angel needed him. That was a good plan.

Obviously!
“No. I’ve been calculating how much money we’ve wasted on charlatans and magic acts. There is no contacting the spirits, Violet. Once the dead are departed, they do not return,” John told her firmly. He truly didn’t mean for his tone to be so snappish, however she ought to know-
John grinned at him, though, excited to see his friend and relieved to be out of the car. He hated the nickname ‘Johnny’. Harry had used it too often for his liking, and although he’d repeatedly asked Bill to stop, it never happened. “You’re looking good, Bill.”
“Ha! I know that to be false. I may have my doubts about Brother Mycroft’s special agents, but even their most ineffective would not blunder their way through life the way that you do. If you will not be honest with me, Fell, then I see no reason to explain my plans to you,” Sigerson told him. He leveled Fell with a pointed glare. “Again.”
John held back a groan and gave her a pained smile. “No, thank you. Please enjoy your afternoon.”
“I won’t let it,” John promised fervently. Sherlock smirked at him, eyes crinkling at the corners.
In this position, his visitor would only be able to see him from the back, silhouetted against the windows. The afternoon light might outline the pale curve of his face, but very little else. It would look dramatic and beautiful, and he knew that his opponent would appreciate the effort.
John had been so absorbed in his own torment that he hadn’t heard him approaching. Usually he was so much better at hiding, but- but the stress of selling his best friend’s soul to the actual best demon in Hell had him distracted. He stood before Sherlock, and Luce knows what his face looked like. Did he have solid black eyes like Moriarty and Moran? Did he have beetles crawling from his nose or sharpened teeth? What horror was Sherlock seeing?
He needed to get off the bridge and get some sense of equilibrium back, so he started to walk again towards what he hoped was an area with more restaurants and possibly a coffee shop. He was in luck and found a sweet, tiny mom and pop shop that reminded him of his college days. He ordered from the young girl working the register and waited for his coffee, glancing once more at his notifications to make sure Bill hadn’t tried to text him. Another popped up from this Lucy woman. She was relentless and apparently ignoring her wasn’t going to work.
Fell whimpered. If Sigerson didn’t have an actual lead here, they’d never return to London and he was
John didn’t really mind, actually. Of course he didn’t want patients to suffer, but the tension brought him back to his army days when he felt useful. He stood and began going through the motions of making tea, needing the comfort after the sad news he’d just received. He filled the electric kettle, setting it back in it’s cradle with a little too much force. As he waited for the water to boil, he opened his cupboards.
“Maybe some other time. Just because it’s so late, I’d probably fall asleep before you even started. I want to be able to enjoy it,” John said, his voice going soft and gentle.
“Sherlock Holmes! Speak to us! Speak to us now!” the medium cried, apparently deciding to give it another go.
“Er, yeah. Right,
He pondered that thought as he pushed himself to his feet, lumbering his sleep-heavy limbs into the bathroom to brush his teeth. He was definitely happy, he decided. He’d just sat up until the early hours of the morning video chatting with a beautiful genius about serial killers, the idiocy of the police and some of John’s time in the army (with another round of conversation regarding his scar and Sherlock’s fascination with it). Yes, despite the apprehension, John was feeling… tentatively happy. Much happier talking to Sherlock than the zoom group therap-
“I would be the harbinger of resurrection, if that were the case.” Mary chewed on her lip nervously, leaning forward to touch his hand. “I’m not the only one who noticed you’d stopped writing. I’m not the only one who was worried. I’m here, John. I’m real. I’m alive.”
