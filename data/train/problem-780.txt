“Will do. Nice wood you’ve got." John felt a wave of relief, moving on to normal subjects.
.” Despite the interruption, John could not meet Sherlock’s eyes.
John gets to the car and Guglielmo is there, waiting. He looks sulky. The car is very old, says the landlady, Guglielmo, he can fix anything. He can rest while you picnic. John nods. He tosses his scarf around his neck and puts his sunglasses on. Guglielmo moderates his breathing and gets into the back seat.
“I will extinguish it for you.”
“I should say the same to you.”
“More likely any evidence is on the other side,” he said, “but better safe than sorry.” He’d map the whole thing into a notebook later, but for now he was just trying to get to the scene as quickly as his sense of scientific inquiry would allow.
"Greg and Oliver and Phillip were old Archibald Lestrade's children.  His first wife was their mother, your Great-Aunt Martha’s sister. When he was sixty he married again--a young slip of a girl, your Great-Aunt Janine’s sister this time--who died when your mother was born.  Juliet was twenty years younger than her half-family, as she used to call them.  She was very pretty and charming and they all loved and petted her and were very proud of her.  When she fell in love with me, a poor young journalist, with nothing in the world but his pen and his ambition, there was a family earthquake.  The Lestrade pride couldn't tolerate the thing at all.  I won't rake it all up. We were both in the wrong, but things were said I could never forget or forgive.  Your mother married me, John—and the New Moon people would have nothing more to do with her.  Can you believe that, in spite of it, she was never sorry for marrying me?"
Emotions. John had said that emotions were dangerous. Sherlock frowned. He himself found emotions—usually those of others, as he himself was admirably scientific and self-contained—rather tiresome, and so he could sympathize with John’s point of view. And yet—he had felt emotions in John’s company that had not been tiresome. Quite the opposite, in fact—the emotions had been exhilarating, comfortable, warming.
Sherlock nodded and left.
“It’s not my compass that’s pointing true north,” John said, pressing his cock against Sherlock’s thigh. “Come to bed and let me deflower you.”
"What would have happened if I hadn't gone to speak with him?" John asked. Angelo's eyes cut down.
“No—no! Just…”
“It is. But…” John had to break eye contact; Sherlock’s face, wide open and earnest, was more than he could bear.
John shook his head. It? Sulking? Afraid of bears?
This title is barely a reject, because it makes me laugh (it’s from “Company of Fools” by Great Big Sea, which is actually the theme song of a future chapter), but I did call this chapter “Escape Goats” for a while.
If you’re wondering whether Stamford ships it: he ships it. A lot. Angelo also ships it.
"I'm going out, Sherlock, to the barn," John said, after dinner. Sherlock didn't even look around as John took the grease from the cupboard; he was staring meditatively into the fire, wrapped once again in his blankets.
Sherlock forced himself to meet John’s eyes.
John cut his eyes to Sherlock, who shrugged.
John filled the final two buckets with nearly-warm lake water, and came back. He suppressed the urge to speed up his pace as he approached the house. It was as if the lamplight had made the rest of the world unsafe; who knew, now, what lurked at the outside of lighted circle.
“Fine,” he snarled, and held out his hand. “But I hope you win.”
Uncle Gregory looked at him in surprise, but didn’t say anything. John saw the twitch of his mouth and decided to follow suit. Instead, he drank the milk and worried down the oatcakes, uncomfortable now despite the friendly firelight. He saw, with a child’s perspicacity and something more than a child’s intelligence, that Uncle Gregory was ill-at-ease with him there. He was just still angry enough about the burnt account books, though, to hold his own silence and let the tension pervade the room. It was a strain, though, to a child used to harmony, and he was glad when Great-Aunt Martha stood and collected the dishes.
"Thanks."
“Was Mycroft still there?”
“You know my brother’s an arsehole and that I’m perfectly healthy.”
“Sit,” he told John, after wrapping him in a blanket. He himself did not sit, but paced around.
Well, at least Sherlock hadn’t seen it. And he wasn’t going to, either. John had barn work to do and fields to hoe; he could manage to be outside all day. Squatting down by the trunk, he lifted the lid as quietly as he could to fetch his spare trousers and shirt.
But could he be convinced? Sherlock focused his mind—so
Sherlock launched himself forward in anticipation.
“You aren’t.”
“Poor thing. Can’t say as I blame her, the old bastard.”
“A scion of a degenerate family.”
Lestrade blanched. "Mycroft?"
John Watson, discharged from the army, disillusioned by the idea of nation, is no longer able to stand the sight of England. He buys a ticket to Italy—Calabria—on a whim. He barely has time to pack; he forgets socks, jeans, all but two shirts, some pants, and a cream linen suit Harry made him buy for her wedding. He doesn't shave. He buys a scarf and some sunglasses at the airport.
The Barrymores drove into the yard just then. John shook Mrs. Barrymore’s hand, then the Major’s. Could these two, the definition of “solid citizen”, be responsible for the straw dog? John frowned. This uncertainty had the potential to poison all of his relationships. His eyes flicked to Mrs. Barrymore’s neat moccasins as she walked towards the house. Some of the raw anxiety he had experienced in his first year in this community came flooding back to him; he struggled to keep his posture relaxed, holding his left hand rigidly at his side.
“Christ, Sherlock, do you have to discuss my bowels?”
"John!" Sally Donovan's voice carried across the barnyard, and turned with a guilty start.
“Why the roof of the shanty?” he asked, once the foot was bound.
“Winter wheat, first, then potatoes, then Indian corn and pumpkins.”
There was no answer.
Frantic bleats from Harry and Clara began at the sound of John’s voice. Even the geese set up a plaintive honking. They made it to the door of the barn—then jumped as something crashed against the wood.
“Acclimating well enough, I suppose. Got on the wrong side of a moose, but my garden’s never been better.”
“No, but I’m ordering tea. Same cup.”
“I suppose I should have reasoned it out,” Sherlock said. “Mike is smarter than he looks, and the Ojibway have suffered a significant loss of traditional territory, not to mention incursions of disease and alcohol. Do you suppose the Indian has a smaller liver than those of Caucasian descent?”
“It was.”
Just as Harry poked her entire head around the corner of the barn, John transferred Idiot Horse’s halter rope to Sherlock’s hand, then, in one fluid movement, leaped towards the errant goat. He missed her collar upon landing, but the weight of his body bore her down, and he was able to wrestle his hand under the leather strap and subdue her.
hysterical? He certainly seemed healthy, if antisocial and frequently cross. And costive.
"You taste salty."
John rubbed his eyes and set the water on before going to the barn. Tea was a necessity this morning; he hadn’t dreamed last night, but he’d woken still tired and wrapped in twisted blankets. That pile of scat in the woods had caused an avalanche of painful memories. What was done was done, and he could do nothing further—as a rational man, he knew that. And yet his cursed brain could not leave the fear and betrayal and shame behind him.
They ate in near-silence, too. Sherlock tasted everything, holding the fiddleheads up to the light with intense interest. Appetite good enough, John thought. In fact, as he scrutinized Sherlock's tall frame, spare but healthy, he wondered what exactly, besides the rudeness, had caused Mycroft Holmes to send his brother away. Lestrade had said "political ambitions"…
“What’s wrong wiv you, bruv?”
he remembered was the four hundred and thirty-eighth.
Sherlock stiffened immediately, and John looked at him searchingly, wondering what he had said. He waited, though, for Sherlock to speak.
“If I can help, I will,” John said. The crease in Greg’s forehead gave the lie to his nonchalant tone.
“I didn’t do a damn thing,” Sherlock said, sounding cross. Thank God.
I can’t guarantee when I’m going to post the next chapter, but I’m hoping to surf this wave of productivity a little longer. As for the total number of chapters, I’m still hoping to come in under twenty. This chapter contains, as I mentioned, only about half of the events it was supposed to. This is entirely down to both John and Sherlock being exhibitionists and also my penchant for sexy banter. I’m not sorry.
Maybe that was the solution to his problem. John wondered if Lyons would be up for it. He smiled, a degree more warmly than usual, and Lyons smiled back. Was that a spark of interest in his eyes?
“Kissing on the mouth is allowed at any time,” Sherlock agreed, gravely. “Now you sit back. I’ll time.”
“Ah,” John said, and subsided.
"Goodnight."
“It doesn’t hurt, Sherlock, not physically. It’s another type of pain that is at stake when it’s between two people: your peace of mind, for one, and your heart, for another. Physical contact—sexual contact—raises emotions that can be difficult to manage.”
I’m so grateful to everyone who’s reading, and super grateful to those of you who take the time to comment. I have been swamped by work these last three weeks and it’s your comments that have kept me going. <3 I’ve read every one and I’ll answer them soon.
"Well then,” John hesitated. "Just be careful."
“Hm.” Sherlock said, dismissing the ham with an imperious gesture. “And it was cut.”
can.”
“It is, and I am not, in any sense, joking.”
That night, without the whiskey, he dreamt of the days before Agra. Mary smiling at him through her fan, Commander Morstan urging them to dance, that first kiss the same night, almost shocking. Then, Captain Sholto was asking him, in Mycroft Holmes' voice, to take the rear and protect the men. He couldn't. He couldn't protect the men. He couldn't protect himself, he thought, as the rebels poured down upon them and Mary's dead face rose dancing in front of his eyes.  He woke with tears on his face this time, his chest heaving. He got out of bed as soon as he could, but several minutes had elapsed before he was able to do anything but hold his body together.
The theme song is “Fishing in the Dark” by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Hi, I’m Red and I was a teenager in Canadian cowboy country in the ‘80s. However, I still don’t hate this song. Find the Easter egg.
him? And lose all that data?”
Placing both hands at the curve of Sherlock’s incredibly lush bottom, John broadened his tongue and licked a very wet stripe from the base of Sherlock’s testicles to his sacroiliac. The noise Sherlock made in response was unreal, a low moan that made John fully hard. He did it again, relishing the quiver under his mouth. Then, slowly, he traced the same route a third time, this time infinitely slowly, exploring each millimetre of musky skin--but this time, he did not overshoot his target. Instead, he stopped licking, and began to drop miniscule, infuriatingly light kisses on the curve of each buttock, working from the outside in, never touching Sherlock’s pink puckered hole until Sherlock was pushing back towards him. John could see Sherlock’s cock was pressed uncomfortably up against the back of the wooden chair, and he could smell Sherlock’s arousal, but still he continued in his deliberately slow approach until Sherlock was very nearly begging under his breath.
When they flinched, he froze. He knew he should step away; he was aware of that much, but he had never seen such young ones before, and their charm was undeniable. They had huge ears and plump whiffly muzzles, and though they were breathing fast, they did not move, which allowed Sherlock to examine them closely. Not more than a week old, then, and ….
"This guarantees nothing," he said.
John choked on his tea.
As they climbed the hill south of Lestrade’s potato field, the moon emerged from behind the clouds and cast a silvery light over the fields and woods.
“No.”
Sherlock pinned John's arms over his head. John let him, but not without wriggling.
“Something startled her. It’s not her fault.”
“Those hens are laying beautifully now,” Sherlock said smugly. John rolled his eyes. Sherlock had insisted on giving them a warm mash through the rainy period despite John’s loudly stated opinion that it was cosseting pure and simple. Now, apparently, he would have to concede that it had worked.
It would have been easier to ignore his own attraction had Sherlock professed some interest in women, but he clearly had none at all. John suspected that if Sherlock loved at all, he loved men, which meant that there was a chance that John’s caresses might be well-received, if they were offered. But that would land them both in a terrible predicament. When, not if, John arsed it up, Mycroft Holmes would rampage, John would lose his farm, and Sherlock would lose his family’s approbation.
It had been his choice. He'd never wanted to see another person again, after Agra, and seven years of self-imposed exile hadn’t changed his mind. The goats and the geese were usually enough for him, though they were poor company in the house and their conversation did leave a little to be desired.
“It’s only a three-hour walk, no?”
John snorted, and went to bed.
“To shou…oh.
Sherlock’s heart leaped.
He glanced at the crux of Sherlock’s trousers, which confirmed his suspicions. Sherlock was clearly aroused—by him,
John crowded against him and kissed him; his physical presence was strength and determination, and Sherlock melted like spring ice under his force. John’s mouth was everywhere, hot and insistent with a sweetness that could not be discounted.
“It was wonderful,” Molly Kuskatoo added. “I’ve never heard such music.”
“Dammit, Sherlock,” he muttered, “Of course he didn’t fucking shovel.” Shivering in the February night (easily thirty degrees colder than the inside of his truck) he wrenched the snow shovel from its place in the garage and began to hack away at the solid white mass. His nose and hands were frozen by the time he cleared enough space to get to the door.
Stamford snorted.
“What do you want?” he asked. His own voice seemed loud in the darkness.
“Sherlock,” he said, once the kettle was on. Sherlock did not answer.
“Breathing is good.” Sherlock said.
Lestrade's lips thinned.
Sherlock flopped back into bed when the door closed behind him, letting his face drop out of the mask of calm he had feigned for John’s benefit. In truth, Sherlock was the opposite of calm; his body, so sluggish yesterday, now tingled from head to toe. His cock was distended more than usual, so much so that bolts of sensation flew up his belly and down his thighs when it brushed against the blankets or his hand.
“That’s not what my brother says.”
“Cat!  You'll take no cats.”
“Can I help?” John said, holding Arthur back with a firm hand. A warm flush went through Sherlock’s body—the pleasure of companionship, he thought fleetingly, and turned his attention back to the grass. No disturbances, not up until about ten feet after the fallen tree, and that could easily be John’s tracks.

saner than you--that scar is not enough of an injury to prevent you from doing farm work, so clearly there's mental trauma."
“Maybe I will,” said John, and stalked out. He ordered another beer and leaned on the bar, staring blankly into the heaving crowd.
“Is your rifle handy? I feel a sudden need to use it.”
Now both John and Sally’s mouths were hanging open.
“Probably,” Sherlock said. He leaned over Idiot Horse’s withers and slid to the ground with a bump. Together, he and John dragged the tree to the side of the road and left it.
“You are a pain in my arse right now,” he said, instead. “You will extinguish that revolting item.”
"He had some experiments to do, he said. He’s got some new
“And sugar.”
“John?”
“Convent school,” Mrs. Hudson added. “Dreadful place. Cold as Satan’s arsehole.”
“I know what I’m doing,” Sherlock said, but he stopped rotating the square.
“I must see you. Show me your face.”
She did not move. He could now see the very faint rise and fall of her breathing.
“Are either of them stupid enough to…No—I see your face—they’re too experienced and Lestrade too careful to have left a tree half-cut that close to the road. Some people would, but neither of them.”
“Provided by the glands we’re not discussing, fine. I presume this gland is internal, then?”
In the fading light, Sherlock’s hair was just another dark shadow, but his skin gleamed. His hands were on his hips, and his shirt buttons strained a little. His ridiculous cupid’s bow mouth curved upwards, shining in the firelight.
“Harry! John! Is she hurt?” he cried, and bounded out into the barnyard, presumably in search of whatever was making Harry bellow. John, who knew by bitter experience that nothing was wrong with her except that she was a goat, and a particularly cussed one at that, sighed. Instead of rushing out into the yard, he doubled back for a heel of cheese and, as an afterthought, a ripe piece of pickle from the bench.
“Bears don’t eat squirrels, as a rule,” he said, looking around—for what he didn’t quite know. Sherlock caught his uneasiness and smiled, though he could see John asking himself if that smile was meant to be reassuring.
Sherlock eventually did bank the fire and stand, stretching his body out of the cramped position he had taken. His muscles protested and the congestion at the base of his spine surged back into his consciousness. He thought, briefly, of taking himself in hand again—in the loft he would be untroubled by bears, surely—but the memory of John’s anguished face stopped him. If it were an act of sexual congress, then he dare not subject John to even an accidental participation, given John’s scruples.
“Am I as bad a liar as that?”
Again, Sherlock could only smile. He’d been called an idiot twice in twenty-four hours, but John Watson insulted him with warmth and admiration. Really, it was impossible to be angry at someone who had assaulted a giant ungulate to protect you. It created a bond, he supposed.
The rejected chapter title for this chapter is “A Bear Shits in the woods. Also, Boners.”
"Getting sentimental?" John teased, for something to say.
Wiping his forehead, for it had become quite a warm day, he sat down on a felled birch tree at the edge of the new field. He unwrapped Sherlock’s good bread and cheese and uncapped his bottle of cold tea with relief.
Sherlock was concentrating on carrying the enormous pot of beans from kitchen to table when he heard the commotion Stamford’s arrival caused. Setting it carefully on the huge table, he shook his hands loose and went to greet him.
What drove John Watson? Survival, now, and, he thought, companionship. Danger, excitement, and...
“There can’t be another one, surely?” Sherlock asked, as he tested the door.
"You haven't smelled me."
"I'm not bored," John said reflexively, though the ghost of the whiskey bottle did flit across his mind. He wasn't bored.
“There is a vast difference between asceticism and neglect. Feel free to tell my brother that.”
"My cock is almost painfully distended," Sherlock continued. "These are not unfamiliar symptoms."
“Quite.” He reached out and pulled back her eyelid to check her sclera, then stroked her smooth ears. Had her pupils changed during their—he hesitated to call it a conversation, but could not think what else it could be. Perhaps John was not so mad regarding talking to animals.
Which would make
“It was a flat refusal, not a dissertation on zoology.”
“As if you didn’t know that my moulds need to sit for at least another thirty-six hours.” Sherlock’s voice was petulant. “You are being deliberately provoking.”
It dissolved immediately, slippery and silky. John was impressed by the smoothness of the fat and made a note to thank his friend. Perhaps it would serve to grease some of his finer tools--although at the price it had cost him he would have to use it sparingly.
And yet, he had felt no shame. Surprise, yes, when John’s words or movements caught him in the pit of the stomach and his cock sprang to life. Curiosity, when he woke every morning in torments of desire—that is, if he had not ejaculated into his blankets. It had become so severe that he had taken to sleeping in a spare shirt rather than have to wash the blankets again and again under John’s watchful eye.
What he saw shocked him deeply. Sherlock’s cock was painfully erect, the veins engorged with blood. It bobbed against his belly, as Sherlock’s arms were shaking slightly with the strain of holding still. A thick line of clear fluid dripped from the purple head to the settle.
John smiled.
He finds a cheap pension somewhere in the south, on a farm. He sits, morosely, in his linen suit, with his bare ankles, growing a beard. His landlady thinks he's very elegant. He thinks he's a bum.
“Bears aren’t dangerous, Sherlock, not as a rule.”
“So,” Sherlock said. “Not only is Tim Horton’s conspiring against me, but you think I’m a hormonal nitwit.”
"Simpler than that.
“I do love you.”
“Sherlock? Are you quite all right?”
John went through their normal breakfast routine with an odd, disembodied feeling. Sherlock’s question about his own sexual emissions had started the scrambling of his brain; his shot about soldiers had finished it. John’s previous rational resolution to reduce his emissions was all mixed up in the previous night’s torment. Sherlock’s confirmation that he was indeed a lover of men sat on top of the mess, something almost too tempting to think of.
“Perhaps the fowl?” Sherlock asked.
He reached out and plucked the offending cigar (it was really an insult to use the term cigar) from Sherlock’s lips instead. He strode to the door and flung it out.
“Legs wider,” John said, giving him one or two light smacks on the inside of his thighs.
She looked right through him.
“Very well, John,” Sherlock said, with a calm that sent a shiver of disquiet through John’s body. “But we’ll be at Lestrade’s work bee early.”
“My feelings are of no importance.”
“I suppose. It’s an odd place for it, though.”
“No, I think that’s true,” he said, softly. “Are you all right?”
“Right!” John exclaimed. “And I didn’t know that! I’m a shit doctor, Sherlock; it’s why I’m here, it’s why I don’t practice. I could hurt you!”
On the other hand, this was a glorious opportunity to give Sherlock a proper scare, and maybe even keep him within reasonable bounds until this mystery was solved. Shedding his heavy boots, John went to find his moccasins. He’d show Sherlock what was what.
“Sholto,” John whispered.
Sherlock shrugged.
“Morning, John,” he said, with such a brilliant smile that John was rather rocked back on his heels.
“Hello, John.”
“No, I don’t.  Now come to bed.”
Well, then, that was exactly what he would do. His parents had always thought him unreasonably stubborn (a bit rich, surely, coming from the people who had burdened the world with Mycroft). There was no reason he shouldn’t apply that stubbornness to getting exactly what he wanted.
He ran back to the house in the hollow, excited to write down his sketch before the memory picture of what he had seen grew a little blurred, but found the Widow Turner waiting for him on the front step.  John smiled at her, so full was he of the joy of his walk, but the Widow Turner simply looked gloomily at him and said, with a ponderous sigh:
"I've noticed something odd about Isadora this morning," Sherlock said, coming in from the garden. "She's been refusing her feed, at least occasionally, and making unusual noises."
“It wasn’t a mistake. It was bad luck.”
“I was an army doctor, Sherlock Holmes,” John’s voice was low and calm. “I could break all the bones in your body while naming them. Don’t posture in front of me.”
“She caused so many deaths. Sholto would have been court martialled if he’d been in his right mind.”
"It's just... there's so much..."Sherlock sounded almost distressed.
"Good," Sherlock said smugly, and kissed him. John's mouth was warm and a little sour, a delicious contrast to the coolness of his own. Daring, Sherlock licked John's lower lip, and John opened to him, their tongues sliding together. Sherlock hummed his pleasure.
“Everything’s upside down,” he complained, “and backwards.”
This brief medical disquisition was met with silence.  The fire snapped and popped, sending up sparks.
To his surprise, there was a parcel for him at the post office. There was no return address, but it was heavy, and wrapped in expensive paper.
“Letters?” he said, and the boy, his face impassive, emptied his pockets. Something for John from England—that was rare—and a bill from Angelo’s, and…
Ha! He had won--a donut. Grinning, he snapped a picture and texted it to Sherlock with the message “I’ll bring you dessert tonight”. He smiled all the way to work.
“But it wasn’t enough?” Sherlock asked, feeling towards something heavy.
And yet…Harry was
“I’m not worried about that, John. As I have intimated, I am not averse to such a liaison. You, on the other hand, appear to be.”
He bent forward a little further. John tilted his face up, and then their lips were together.
There is a lot of talk in this chapter, too, and part of that is the mystery and part of that is setting up for what I am devoutly hoping I can turn into a series of original queer romance titles.
“I’m so sorry.”
“Thank you,” Sherlock said, almost gravely, “So are you.”
He nearly dropped the beaver grease. Instead of lying down, Sherlock had stood; his hands were on the back of the settle and his legs were parted. His arse, sleek and beautiful, was spread and ready.
“He’s never wrong!” the other boy shouted at his back. John did not deign to answer. Degenerate, indeed. He had only just met the Lestrades, but he knew in his heart that while they were many things, degenerate they were not. This boy was more degenerate than the lot of them.
“Nothing.” Sherlock flung off his coat and sat. “Soup?”
“Why?” Sherlock said bitterly. “So you can realize, again, that I am abnormal?”
"Please," Sherlock said, his voice low.
Outside, huge grey clouds were massing in the east. More rain, John thought, and left the cottage.
"And don't worry," added Great-Aunt Martha, "the cows know the way so well they'll go of themselves.  You have only to follow and shut the gates."
“It was hard for you, in India.” Sherlock said.
Looking to prove himself, Sherlock thought. And willing to take risks. He watched as John put down his axe and showed the boy how to lift the end of the log safely. The boy smiled shyly, and came out of the shadows, standing ready to help.
“It’s what I want,” Sherlock replied, and began to sip his coffee with equanimity.
I think that’s it! Let me know if you have any questions or comments, or if you see any typos.
“You did,” Sherlock said, ruffling his curls into place. They were getting long, John thought. How would Sherlock maintain them? Lestrade’s rough barbering would certainly not be up to his city standards.
"You bloody madman!" he exclaimed. He strode across the room. Sherlock braced himself, but instead of a reprimand, John put his hands on Sherlock's chest and pushed him up against the wall. "I ought to spank you."
His own neglected cock throbbed, but now that they were actually touching each other, he could revel in it.
“And her goat Frank?”
“Almost there,” John said, as soothingly as he was able. “Tell me when I have it.” He worked the tool out a little, then in further, and out again. Sherlock’s hips were rocking a little in rhythm with the motion, but it was clear when John had hit his target. Sherlock’s movements stuttered and a breathless gasp escaped him.
and stood stock-still.
“Do you have a long rope?” Sherlock asked.
“He’d leave a bigger pile of shit; it’s not him. Come on, let’s go; there’s a
“We should.” John said, taking a canvas sack from Arthur’s saddlebags. It wasn’t ideal for fish; he should see if he could trade with Mezenee for a creel. Usually he didn’t have much to trade—nor time to fish, which was the reason he didn’t have a creel—but perhaps if he managed to send Sherlock away safely, he might afford both things.
“So you know, my dear John?”
They were halfway through enormous plates of Angelo’s meat pie when the store bell rang. Angelo leaped up and disappeared into the main area. A jovial “Doctor Mike!” echoed through the building not a second later, and shortly after, Angelo came into the kitchen with Mike in tow.
Disoriented at first, John was only conscious of the pain in his shoulder; he cursed. Then, Sherlock's weight crashed down upon him and John's breath was crushed from his body. When it returned, and with it consciousness of a body over his own, a radiating heat and some expensive hair oil. He pushed away.
“Should we move the tree?” John pulled up right beside it instead of going around as they had before. “If Lestrade sees it, there’ll be questions.”
John had clearly noticed the same, and a pucker of worry formed between his eyebrows. He laid his hand on Sherlock’s hip; it was warm, even through the damp wool, and Sherlock moved towards it. John frowned.
, lost his footing, and slid down a four-foot rock face onto a thin ledge, “That’s the biggest ravine in this area; one more step and you’ll go crashing through those trees to the bottom.”
“We’d better go back,” John replied. “Something’s not right, and all the livestock is out.”
“That’s your final word?” Sherlock asked.
“Are you—a doctor, a man of science—suggesting that corporal punishment would have affected my psyche and thus changed my behaviour?”
John examined his face. There was no breath of fear, no bluff; this was a man who would stop at nothing.
Then, Sherlock leaned forward and kissed John swiftly on the lips.
"I thought books belonged to everybody," said John.
In the field behind them, Byron mounted Isa, to the apparent pleasure of both parties.
“No!” John cried. “We’ve always been just us two. I’ll face them when it’s time, but not before.”
“She’s not such an idiot as all that, though frankly I can’t fathom why she likes you,” John said.
“Better? You should have told me how cold you were, you great idiot.”
Frowning, Sherlock sat up. He needed a notebook. And yet, he was very uncomfortable. His mind kept sliding sideways to the image of John, half-dressed in the firelight. His body was pleasing: a slender musculature that was surely closer to da Vinci's ideal than anything Sherlock himself had ever seen in life. At the thought, Sherlock’s cock throbbed. Damn! Even his hands were not as steady as they usually were. He shook himself and got out of bed. As he went up the stairs, he stepped in a pile of scattered matches; a stab of shame at yesterday’s weakness deflated his erection, and he did not have the trouble dressing that John had had.
“I am,” she said. “Where would you like these eggs, Mrs. Hudson?”
No. That way lay madness. Clucking at Arthur, who was only too happy to pick up the pace, John bent his mind to the problem of the swamp in the back quarter.
"So you're a pain in your brother's arse, then, and he's offloaded you on me on the pretext you need medical treatment?"
“Don’t be too quick to throw family away, John. There may be very good things for you there. In fact,” Douglas paused, coughing so hard his thin body shook and trembled, “I will write to them now, if you like, so you can meet them before I’m gone.”
"I never doubted it," Sherlock said, and smiled. "Tell me."
“It’s an animal we’re trying to catch.” No use in saying her name.     “Keep talking.”
John held onto the feeling of wellbeing as he dipped the end of the towel in water. Holding his breath, he rubbed it around his pubic hair, under his ballocks.
“Could it be her?” Sherlock felt a low panic, breath caught in his throat. “Did she live, John?”
"No. Not now."
John froze. ‘Best’? He could not quite believe it.
Almost there. Clara’s haunches tensed as she flew towards the heap of manure.
“Idiot Horse, obviously.”
"Fat chance of that," John said. "I can barely stand you."
"Did he offer you exorbitant amounts of money for written updates?"
“I have more time to cut wood than I have money. Now, do you mind very much if I start the fire? Lake's still too cold to wash in, and I'm covered in mud."
“That’s a no, then.”
“We are leaving right now.” John said. Taking Sherlock’s hand—it was enormous, engulfing his own—he headed for the exit.
“Oooh, scary,” Sherlock said, but he complied, settling himself slowly over the back.
“Fine,” John said, and held out the cup. Four sugars, no milk. They were almost out of sugar, too. He hoped things would dry up soon, or he’d have a bad crop and he—-they--would be eating nothing but what Sherlock could gather and grow, and milk would be their only source of protein.
“Lunch?”
In the week that followed their disastrous—to John’s mind—attempt at prostate draining, John was never sure which way was up. He supposed, as he was shovelling out the barn one evening, that he should not have allowed himself to expect that Sherlock Holmes would behave in any kind of predictable way.
John snorted. Sherlock slouched down in his chair and began to unwrap his sandwich. They ate in silence for a while, the warm odour of chicken noodle soup filling the room. Then John reached for a cup of coffee.
“Yes. Will you be ready?”
Sherlock woke the next morning with no memory of having fallen asleep.
“It might. Harry would defend us.” Sherlock set his cup on the bench and bent to retrieve something from the bottom shelf. Setting it on a glass plate, he took his scalpel from the meticulously maintained leather pouch and began to poke at the plate.
John completed his barn work in a hurry, both curious and dubious about Sherlock’s ability to make a drinkable beverage. Harry bleated at the cursory patting she received, and even Arthur snorted.
I learned some things about bear dressing for this chapter. If you’re interested in why John does these things, this video is useful but graphic: http://www.themeateater.com/videos/skin-butcher-black-bear-steven-rinella/
. He trusted the evidence of his senses: if he had not heard anything, there had been nothing. How, then, had it fallen?
“I do, thank you. No, wait until I get this last log up and I’ll go down with you.” Somehow, John felt apprehensive about Mrs. Hudson and Sherlock meeting without supervision. What could they possibly find to say to each other? Bread-baking techniques, he supposed, and the state of the garden, recipes for salt pork, John’s digestion…no. No. He secured the logs as quickly as he was able, untied the oxen, and nodded to Mrs. Hudson.
“No,” Sherlock’s voice was low.
She's been spending too much time with Sherlock, John thought sourly.
“That may be the case.”
The leaves were on the trees and John’s fields were ploughed and seeded by the time Sherlock was truly up and around again. He had properly begun his botanical work—joking to John that flora were significantly more tractable than any of the fauna he had so far attempted to study-collecting first around the buildings, then the edges of the fields, and finally in the smaller woods on the home quarter. He had also, to John’s delight, devoted himself to the kitchen garden, and now it flourished as it had never done before. It was not yet June and bean and pea plants were popping up, and the onions and lettuce were already edible. He had also taken over the bread-making, with a success that had made him quite puffed up; his salt-rising bread was better than Mrs. Hudson’s, though John didn’t intend to tell him that.
Then, he remembered. His summer drawers were in his chest; he’d put those on and save himself at least some embarrassment. He spread Sherlock’s clothes over the settle to dry, then his own, and pulled on the linen drawers. They were thin with wear, but they would be protection of a sort.
“And Frank.”
but they have nothing to do with the
“Generations of farmers. The men raise good sheep & cattle, and the women are excellent dairymaids.”
"I hear you have a house guest," she said, without preamble.
“No rush. Let’s go over to the sports section.”
“I thought I’d go into town today,” he said, finally. “The roads are dry enough, and I don’t have anything but clearing to do today. Will you come?”
Sherlock stared at John’s back as they made their way through the damp spring forest. He tried to read the set of John’s shoulders for deception or dissimulation, but there was none. All their interactions had been scrupulously honest, reflective of John himself. Something unspoken, yes, but it was deeply personal, unrelated to Sherlock. What had happened in Agra—before Agra, even? Sherlock felt the desire for knowledge, for facts, for data, gnaw at him. He resolved to have a second look at the letters John kept hidden in his trunk; they had not revealed anything he had not already known, but perhaps with the fragment more he had learned at the fire, he would be able to glean something new.
John looked at him, almost angrily, but the boy’s young, white face remained unmoved. A chill skittered down John’s spine.
Then, through the crack in the wall, he saw a flash of movement.
"Maybe I wouldn't have," John corrected. "But I regret it, all right?"
Then, John opened his mouth slightly and bit Sherlock’s lower lip, very gently, and all Sherlock’s breath released in a long trembling sigh. His cock felt heavy. The breathlessness of the day of the prostate massage was back, but this time Sherlock let himself feel it, feel John, whose body was solid against him, and was… was that John’s cock against his thigh? He pressed forward.
Sherlock shrugged. “Such is life,” he said, and proceeded to brush whispery kisses all around John’s cock for three minutes without touching it once.
“H-h-h-here,” Sherlock stuttered.
They were facing each other now, their chests rising and falling almost simultaneously.
"He's difficult, isn't he?"
"That's more like it. Just don't damage my animals."
“It makes a lot of noise too,” John replied, and reached up to run his raspberry-stained thumb across Sherlock’s lips. “Someone should stop it up.”
“Yes, but for how long? Do you really want to be buried in the bush all your life?”
“I have other priorities.”
In fact, Greg Lestrade had been quite torn over where to put this strange, serious boy. He could not have given him his sister Juliet’s room, though she had been the boy’s mother. There was something too bitter yet about it, and it didn’t seem right somehow. He didn’t want to wish the legacy of Lestrade pride on John; Juliet had had it and it had chafed and hurt her, and she had kicked the traces. He himself had kept within them but at a price.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock” he said, taking a deep breath. “I should have warned you not to come to the barn.”
Also, I mean, you knew I had an opinion about the stinkiest manure. Pig manure does give chicken a close run, but in the end, there’s a slightly higher level of whatever stinky organic chemical compound (look, I asked my friend who holds a Canada Research Chair in organic chemistry and he couldn’t tell me so … stinky compound, okay?) in accumulated chicken manure.
"Mike, can he...Holmes, I mean...ride? Is it just the horse?"
It did not, however, do well on humans. He wrinkled his nose. His clothing was definitively ruined, as was his hair; he dared not think of his boots. In fact, what he needed to think of was removing himself from the pile, and frankly, that posed a bit of a difficulty. It meant extending his arm down in to the pile, in the hopes of finding firm ground from which he could push himself up. And yet, extending his arm into the pile seemed a rather unpleasant choice. He decided to first try pulling himself up using the strength of his lower body. Tensing his abdominals and flexing his gluteus muscles, he succeeded in pulling himself nearly to his knees (an additional problem, as his knees sank deeper into a soupy concoction of horse and ox manure) before falling back into the pile.
“Then what are we doing here?”
“Up,” he said, hauling on Sherlock’s arm. Sherlock wrinkled his brow but allowed himself to be pulled into a half-sitting position.
Sherlock groaned.
Diving down, he seized a double handful of sand to scrub the rest from his skin, then broke the surface again.
“If you consent to this, you consent to sexual congress, not a medical procedure.”
A straw dog. Something tingled deep in Sherlock’s memory; he couldn’t grasp it, but a gnawing dread installed itself at the base of his spine. This was something to fear, something that tickled at a hidden memory.
"We both win." Sherlock began to stroke gently—too gently, but John let it happen, slowed his breath and let himself feel. What's sauce for the goose—no gander. What's sauce for the gander is sauce for the gander. He laughed.
Sherlock stood, his eyes speculative.
“Mrs. Hudson!” Sherlock said, smiling back. John frowned.
“I?” John slammed the door. “I’m being deliberately provoking? You’re the one filling the indoors with the reek of God knows what, and then pouting when you’re asked to consider basic courtesy.”
“Don’t know. Get some sand to scrub it off—but don’t use the peat mud, it’ll stain just as bad or worse.”
“Why is that goat so
"Eh, supper." Sherlock's shoulders made what could only be a dismissive gesture from the inside of the hearth.
Sherlock added one more log to the fire and rose. "I'll get a towel."
He would have to find a place to conceal it; there was no other way. The house was impossible, and the barn no better; Sherlock was entirely too comfortable commandeering anything he felt was essential for his experiments—except the geese, which made John smile still. The shanty, used for tools and food storage, was no better.
John laughed.
They saw it at the same time. Tied to the top of the fallen tree was the figure of a dog, crudely fashioned in straw.
"Very well." John said, and indicated the feed basket.
“No. I didn’t. Or the orderlies or the native enlisted men either. It was wrong, Sherlock. So very wrong. I was given orders that were immoral, meant to civilize the heathens, but in reality it was only a way to drain the land of wealth. There was no respect for a culture older than our own.”
John nodded as noncommittally as he was able. He was starting to wish that he had not opened this line of conversation, even if he knew he was obliged by Mycroft Holmes to do so. It was one thing to insist that Sherlock look to his transport in the matter of eating, drinking, and sleeping.
“You been out there a long time with that new friend, eh?” Angelo’s smile was broad and genuine, but there was no mistaking the elbow to the ribs. “He’s a good one!”
"John," Sherlock breathed, arching his hips up. He could get no contact, though, because John had positioned himself too far back on Sherlock's thighs. "Bastard!"
The fire crackled, and the warm smell of food and smoke rose in the air. They sat, with greasy fingers, enjoying the rich cheese over bread and watching the last of the sunset. John was gratified to note that Sherlock ate a substantial wedge of cheese and at least half the loaf before drawing a long sigh and taking a healthy swig of port out of the bottle.
John’s cock. Sherlock shifted uncomfortably as images of John's cock, seen incompletely but compellingly through the crack in the barn door. It was thick, hard, and the tip had glistened in the diffuse light; when John's crisis had hit him, the spurt of white liquid had affected them both strangely, John crying out and Sherlock breathless. Then, John's face in spasm floated up before his eyes, and then installed itself, contrary to his bidding, in an alcove in his mind palace. It joined images of John's face in laughter, in anger, in concern.
Sherlock fell silent, wincing as John crouched before him, carefully removing his boot, and then his sock.
Theme song is “It’s Getting Hot in Here” by Nelly, I’m sorry.
He'd swim. That's what he'd do. It was cold yet, but it would feel good to be clean, and remove the stench of billy goat—both literal and metaphorical—from him in the icy shock of the lake.
“As right as it can be,” Greg replied. “Don’t worry, you’ve got your own problems.”
“Granted.” John did not know what else to say. At least he knew, now, that excess emissions were not Sherlock’s trouble—if indeed, he had trouble with that part of his body. John sneaked a glance at the front of Sherlock’s trousers.
“I did not want to endanger your heart. But there have been so many moments where your body was endangered, I have genuinely feared for your safety. And,” John continued, running his hand through his hair, “Yesterday, I could not bear the sight of other men who love men looking at you coveteously. So many times, I have regretted not having you for my own.”
"Would you rather sleep in the loft or here on the settle?" John asked, suddenly cross. He was tired, and he should have decided it earlier, he supposed, but he didn't feel like cajoling now.
Behind
Sherlock sat back with satisfaction.
“Ready?” John’s voice was softer than usual—the drink, most likely, but something else as well. Suddenly, Sherlock wished he could see his face in the light.
Choleric, John thought; perhaps Holmes did need some sort of treatment to relieve his humours.
“No,” Sherlock looked at him thoughtfully, but did not ask.
Then, Sherlock glanced sideways at John’s arm, partly hidden under his linen shirt. Before he could censor his mouth, he was asking a question he knew to be presumptuous.
"This is," he said, drawing himself up, "definitely more work for me. Please go back to the house and let me finish. If you wish to help, you may fill the kettle at the spring and set it at the fire."
John sat for a brief second in the still wagon. It was not yet dark, and he would not be breaking their resolution about being in the woods after dark if he were to examine the tree—and he should. Something did not feel right. He leaped out of the wagon and tied Arthur to a (very solid) birch tree. Then, hefting the axe that had been in the wagon bed, he walked back to the base of the fallen tree.
“The geese are undoubtedly smarter. And her babies are healthy.”
And, of course, once they’re out they’re really really hard to catch. I promise I’m not exaggerating the chase even a little. OR, honestly, in a horse being curious and/or silly enough to come and see what’s happening.
“I will take my time if I choose.”
John ended up, rather uneasily, truth be told, hiding it under a shingle on the outhouse roof, as Sherlock spent the least time there of all the buildings. In the ensuing days, he would be able to work at the tool on his own visits to the outhouse, making it smooth. Once it would assuredly not give Sherlock splinters in his arse, he would polish it with a little beeswax, just to be sure. When he was finished, he would have a rather efficient little tool, long enough for its purpose, but not so thick that it would incommodate a man unused to penetration in his nether parts.
"Stay turned around for a moment," John said, "while I finish."
“I'm NOT ashamed of it,” cried John, backing away, “But I won't let you--or ANYBODY--see it.”
“Come on, Sherlock. Wake up. Warm up,” he pleaded, rubbing his hands over Sherlock’s chest. Surely the treatment should be having some effect by now. Well, effect on Sherlock. It was certainly having one on him, worry and cold notwithstanding. He twisted his hips back and breathed deeply. If Sherlock didn’t respond, he couldn’t take his torso, the main source of heat, away for long, but he needed some breathing room. He stretched down and rubbed Sherlock’s feet with his own.
“Bloody buggering fuck!” came from the pile—rather muffled, to be sure.
“Ah!”
"Very well."
“Is that…are you…”
He did not want to be a burden to John Watson. He wanted, he thought with some surprise, to be his friend.
“It’s been a long day,” John said. “Drink up.”
“Sherlock, it’s fine, you know.” John put a careful hand on his foot. “It’s all fine.”
“John?”
Damn these dreams, he thought, and reached for the whiskey bottle.
John scrutinized the sample more closely.
“It was.”
“At least I can make you come in under six minutes.”
The light in the caravan was weak, but the view was wonderful. Sherlock lay on the bed, a slick, shaking mess. His mouth was pink and plump, and his eyes were fixed on John.
"Further?" John asked, despite himself, "How far along was it?"
“It was a simple example.”
he seen? John cursed himself. He could only hope that Sherlock’s apparent naivete would protect him from the realization of what John had done, and that Sherlock’s native embarrassment would prevent any searching questions, or worse, curiosity.
The theme song is “Ahead By A Century” by The Tragically Hip.
“Go on,” Sherlock said, and John heard the beep of his watch.
“Oh!” Sherlock squeaked.
John turned his body and grabbed Sherlock’s hips, pulling their bodies together. There was a hard ridge in those damn shorts, and he felt reassured. He ran his hand up Sherlock’s neck and pulled him down.
“Very well.” Sherlock turned further toward the fire, his profile still as marble.
“Our culprit has a small hand,” he said, indicating some irregular smudges on the middle part of the tree, “but they’re strong. The tree was bent back quite far. Look, here’s a …wait. What kind of knife could have made that?”
“The Lestrades can go to,” John hissed, regaining his powers of speech but reluctant to wake his father, “to… Halifax!”
“Think I will. Goodnight.”
“No childhood friend? No schoolmate?”
“Tell me if you want me to stop,” John said, wickedly. “Because I will.”
“Or ‘idiot’” Sherlock muttered.
"Mostly," John said.
By the time they’d butchered the bear, filled the barrel full of meat and shoveled the skeleton and guts up and buried them on the far side of the manure pile, it was dinnertime. Sherlock washed the knives while John did the chores, securing the door with an extra bar as well as a leather strap.
I wrote this note and then I realized that Cohen’s “Hallelujah” could be pretty gay but I still stand by my choice. The Pentatonix version is more joyful and these two are having a hell of a good time banging each other silly.
Neither of them won that night, and they spent a delicious six minutes touching each other in turn before John headed to bed, leaving Sherlock hunched in front of his laptops, with maps and about sixteen notebooks.
“…previous experience. Sherlock!”
John felt a flush of terrible excitement. He had caught only a glimpse of Sherlock’s congested face as Sherlock retreated, but he had had time to see the strained flies of Sherlock’s trousers.
"I prefer to use proper terms."
“Oh no,” Sherlock said. “Remember the rules. Come here.” He tugged John back in to the corner by the bicycles.
“Everyone has chinks in their armour, even you.”
John, meanwhile, was staring at the fire. They had had a pleasant day, and so he would stay up, Sherlock knew, for longer than he wanted out of some misguided sense that Sherlock needed companionship.
“What's this?” he asked.
“I take it that’s ‘no’ for the rope?”
"So the second drawing room was the best choice."
“I am cold.” Sherlock said, flinging his arm over John’s waist.
John, fighting desperately for self-control, went into the sitting-room. Much more cheerful than the kitchen, it was, with bright colours and comfortable furniture, though it was very rich and imposing and Lestrade-like.  John had never seen such curtains before.  But best of all were the friendly gleams and flickers from the jolly hardwood fire in the open stove that mellowed the ghostly candlelight with something warm and rosy-golden.  John toasted his toes before it and felt reviving interest in his surroundings.  What mysteries might lurk behind the chintz-lined glass doors of the bookcase!  Books were John's friends wherever he found them.  He got up and went to open the bookcase door, but before he could see more than the backs of rather ponderous volumes, Uncle Gregory came in, followed by Great-Aunt Martha with a mug of milk and a plate of oatcakes.
Sherlock's face, looking at him naked in the firelight, was the most beautiful thing John had ever seen. His lower lip glistened where he had bitten it, and his eyes were huge and dark.
“Obvious, isn’t it?” Sherlock said, and suddenly it was. He recalled the way Lyons’ fingers had sunk into the flesh of Lestrade’s arm as they had swung past. John’s brief enjoyment had been entirely different.
"And you're a city fool," John snapped. Sherlock barely looked as though he had fallen at all, much less spent days travelling through the woods. He was still all elegance; his clothes, though plain, were finer than anything John had ever owned, and his handsome face seemed calm. Only his ruffled hair showed that anything untoward had happened, and that was not enough to make John feel any less homely, crumpled, and old.
“Not a hormonal nitwit. You just...need a lot of stimulation. Also, can you please lower your voice, because this is my workplace.”
“True.” Sherlock said, and his smile was genuine. “But you’re a cock.”
John stepped back and sat on the settle uneasily but he leaped up again as if remembering. There, Sherlock sympathized; he sat on the settle because there was no other place, but every time he looked at it he saw splatters of spunk.
John caught his breath.
?” Sherlock complained.
“We can,” John said. “D’you think we should tell Lestrade about this?”
“It’s Dimmock,” he said, from the doorway. John, who could not see a single thing through Sherlock, shrugged. “He probably has letters. Sometimes I do get mail.”
Sherlock looked up scornfully.
“You were quiet.”
“Is there no way we could go to town before that?”          “Impossible in this weather. The mud clings to the wagon and it would take three days I don't have; on horseback, it’d be shorter but that’s no way to really bring anything back. I'll take my gun on our walk and try to get a deer, though they'll be thin or pregnant.”
“I rather thought not. What do you make of it, then?”
“What if I am? It only shows my persistent unfitness!”
When he broke the surface, however, he was just Sherlock, again, splashing and shaking his head with vigour.
able, in fact.”
“Because I like raspberries and so do you.”
“Not you, you berk, the horse.”
He would not make a bed, he decided; he would not do a single thing to make his home something it was not. Let Holmes choose between spruce branches in the loft or the narrow settle, since it too was long enough for a man, though narrow, and it was closer to the fire. He would bear this intrusion, but he would do no more. He had three weeks at least before Holmes arrived, and he would make the most of his solitude until then.
“Good thing he’s here,” Greg said, smiling. “Sarah could do it, but it makes the Major costive.”
Then, he stood. He got up, his own legs weak with desire, and closed the caravan’s curtains. He turned on the light.
Sherlock didn’t respond. Instead, he took three quick steps into the woods.
“Oh, so you are fishing?”
Sherlock did not object. He watched Major Barrymore plane his way meticulously through the pile of logs beside him: every time he finished a log, he lifted it seemingly effortlessly into a neat stack, despite his age. Cyrus Dimmock, working beside him, was both slower and less industrious. His pale eyes darted around the barnyard, more concerned with others’ work than his own.
"Keep the skin."
Sherlock sat back up on Idiot Horse, still with Arthur’s rein in his hand. He drew a deep breath, and caught the tang of bear. His skin crawled, and he gripped Idiot Horse’s mane in his left hand. She snorted reassuringly—of course she would, the moronic animal—and kept her pace.
Sherlock was not so lost in the music that he did not see the conversation, nor see John reaching for the rum once again, his anger plainly stamped on his face. But he didn’t stop fiddling, and soon John’s glass was empty and he was rising to dance with Sarah. Sherlock raised the tempo, and then everyone was dancing a mad reel, whirling in the firelight.  Sherlock’s only regret was that he could not dance and fiddle at once; it was a heady feeling, calling the tune for all these people, but he would have liked to abandon himself to movement, perhaps even cling to John as Sarah was clinging to Soo-Lin as they passed, or kiss, as Sally was kissing…Stamford? He filed that away for future reference.
“What was in the letter?”
When John entered, Sherlock was hunched on the settle again. Without speaking, John poked up the fire and located his cleanest towel. He kept his back to Sherlock until he was able to secrete the massager under the towel on the bench.
“Very well, be as imprecise as you like.”
“I’m bloody tired of you telling me I’m wrong! Don’t you think I want this too, even though I know I can’t have it?”
Instead, he saw something else entirely. Sherlock’s cheeks flushed red, and his face took on a slightly pained expression.
"For you, maybe," John said, "but I ploughed four acres today, and dug my heavy plough out of clay. And I have to do the same tomorrow. I need to sleep. The loft or the settle?"
In the dim light, its reasons for falling were not immediately evident; John squinted as he leaned over to check, his hand firm on his axe. Running his hand down the thick trunk, he got to splinters—which indicated a natural fall—and then, chillingly, to the blunt-edged marks of an axe.
"Goodnight."
“Left!” John called out, his voice low.
The house had warmed, though not much, and he drew the latch and closed the curtain over the entry. Setting a huge kettle of water to boil, he unpacked his provisions and sat down with a sigh. He'd wash, he'd eat, and he'd make a plan.
Was the answer that Sherlock himself had not sought out the consultation—did not wish to be “cured” in any way? He was at John’s farm under duress, and so John, caught between his own personal and professional ethics and pressure from Mycroft, displayed tension and embarrassment. It was a plausible theory.
“Showoff,” John growled, his pupils dilating. Sherlock opened his eyes wide. “Yes, you. With your curls and your mouth.”
“Hold on, Sherlock. Just a few more minutes.” Thanks to the heat of the animals in the barn, he wasn’t hypothermic, but he would be soon if he didn’t take off his own wet clothes. He took small steps across the cabin, and found the pile of matches. The candle rolled under his foot, and he picked it up.
“Hold out your leg.”
Sherlock came bounding up some time later, coat over his arm and hair and shirtsleeves damp.  His notebook looked suspiciously sticky, but John had no plans to touch that.
“So you finally slept some, did you?” he asked. “Tea’ll be on in a moment, if your transport would like some.” Sherlock grunted, then fell back into bed hard enough to shake the loft.
“Yes.”
He slipped carefully from the bed and opened the door. The sun was already warm, and he basked in the feeling of it on his naked body. He felt, danger notwithstanding, like he wanted to run nude outdoors, as the ancient Greeks had done.
Sherlock bounded ahead, his long legs allowing him to clear fallen trees with ease. He was graceful, although John thought his enthusiasm made him seem less so; he looked so young when he wasn’t being a terrifying know-it-all.
Sherlock watched with unfeigned fascination as John roasted two large trout, which cooked quickly over the flames despite the light rain that had begun to fall. John flipped them off the grill on to chunks of Sherlock’s salt-rising bread, and, too impatient for fresh food to wait, they ate with their fingers while it was still hot. The rich flesh burned, but it was delicious, and so they took their pleasure with their pain.
The young woman was small, with a very straight back. She stepped easily down from the wagon, but there was a constraint somewhere—ah. The clothes. She was dressed in a conventional town outfit, but it sat uneasily upon her, her blue serge hem dragging in the dirt. Recent, then, and not made for her.
“No,” John said, “I mean there’s someone. Something. Here.”
“I wouldn’t dare say that word to her. She’s a mathematician.”
“And you didn’t
“Repeatable results, John. Scientific method. You tell me that this goose bloodied a fox’s nose, and I seek to assemble the data that proves it true or not.”
“Someone passing through, surely?”
He smelled the bear. Held himself in place, now, with the solidity of John’s muscles under his hands. He would not succumb to fear.
“I’ll clean up afterwards,” Sherlock said, forestalling any comment, and began to rummage under the bench for the nest of tinware he had stored away for experiments.
He turned back into the cabin and pulled on his trousers.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
“You certainly are,” John said. Water droplets glistened here and there on Sherlock’s skin, and his curls clung damply to his face. The morning sun made his long, ivory body shine.
The rejected title for this chapter is “Dumb Dumb DUMMMMMMMMM.”
“Very possessive—not to mention presumptuous—of you.”
"Of course. Good idea. We should check the house, though."
I KNOW THIS CHAPTER HAS YET ANOTHER REFERENCE TO ANDERSON AND BESTIALITY. I’m sorry, he’s a convenient whipping boy and I can’t help myself.
“Fucking Mycroft,” Sherlock interjected.
John could do it again. He should do it again. He could take out the massager and, with a clear and doctorly explanation, oblige Sherlock to lower his trousers once more.
Thanks to doctornerdington, girlwhowearsglasses, turifer, ellioop, and marigolds. <3
"Yes, do get up." Sherlock said, and slithered out of John's personal space and over to the settle. His papers seemed to have multiplied overnight, and there was a handful of fresh fiddleheads on the table.
“Well, I’ll tell you right now, they aren’t. And that’s because this is a very old sample. Look at the lustre, and smell the mould.”
“Come, John,” he said, and began to walk out of the clearing. John stumbled, then followed, scooping up Idiot Horse’s reins as he passed. Arthur, clearly disgruntled, went on ahead.
He did not. John lay behind him, chafing with his hands, until the water boiled and he had to tear himself away to make tea. Dumping tea profligately straight into the kettle, he prepared two cups, both with three spoons of sugar, and Sherlock’s with a tot of whiskey. He refrained from putting any in his own; he wasn’t so cold, and he didn’t need any lowered inhibitions, either. The shock of a naked body against his own had already awakened a deep hunger within him, but he stood firm against it.
"I live to serve." Sherlock said, with a faux-humble expression.
“Did you just face down a moose for me?” Sherlock asked, answering raillery for raillery.
“Maybe it was for the best.” John sighed heavily. “But the men themselves, they didn’t deserve it. The army, yes. Not the men. So many good men were lost or broken.”
The first day was not so bad. Sherlock had bought cream when he’d gone to the grocery store, so John made coffee at home that morning. An acceptable case had appeared on Sherlock’s website, which meant that instead of spending his day rushing about buying John coffees he looked set to spend it creating complex spreadsheets about the differing tensile strengths of dogsled harnesses and snowmobile treads.  John left for work both relieved and disappointed; while providing (or receiving) sexual services on demand and within a time limit was exciting, his workplace was not exactly the place for it.
Mike looked at him nonplussed, but John felt a certain relief. This was a mystery, a disturbing one, but Sherlock’s quick mental action was reassuring.
“I’ll be fine.”
John lifted his hands.
Crack! John's shot echoed through the air. The bear bounced back, rolled, twitched a few times, and was still.
“My bed, Sherlock. Aim for my bed.” Sherlock staggered forward, and John only just managed to pull back the blanket before he fell.
"I see," Sherlock laughed. "I find I want to watch you dress the bear, but I think perhaps we could resume this stimulating little mise en scène afterwards.”
The theme song for this chapter was really hard to find. I finally decided on “If I Were A Moose” by Fred Small, which, despite the weird YouTube iterations, has quite relevant lyrics. Do you like the song? Did you find the Easter egg?
John pursed his mouth. He didn’t need to read the text to suspect what the topic of this pamphlet was. The word “prostate” caught his eye and he quickly turned the sheet over in case passersby saw him holding it. But the other side was no better. John’s ears burned when he saw the sketch of a long cylindrical object and the large words “PROSTATE MASSAGER” below it. Someone had underlined “A Cure for the Refractory Young Man” in purple ink. Exhaling gustily, he crumpled up the paper, cursing Mycroft Holmes under his breath.
“Tea stimulates the faculties, John, and while my faculties barely need stimulating, the quantity of new information I expect to gather today prompted me to draw upon it.”
wait. I guess you could. I mean, medical kink/prostate milking, then aftercare isn’t such a bad idea. Just don’t overboil those towels, because I made that shit up.
The song is “Wondering Where the Lions Are” by Bruce Cockburn.
“Would you…I mean, d’you mind, going in and starting the fire? I wouldn’t ask, but the animals are hungry and cold themselves. Not,” he added, seeing Arthur and Idiot Horse coming around the barn, “that some of them don’t deserve to be.”
“Okay,” John said, setting down his tray and reaching for the keys.  It wasn’t until they were in the truck that he thought to ask.
“Gentlemen, let us pray for the success of this venture,” Cyrus Dimmock said, rather unctuously. There was no church even in Bonne Chere yet, a lack that Cyrus and his wife were trying to correct. Meanwhile, there was prayer at every opportunity. Frankly, John was surprised that they had allowed Joe to chore for such an obvious atheist as Lestrade, but his money was as good as anyone else’s, he supposed.
John’s mouth curled up, just a bit. Sherlock continued, a little flushed with his success, “And yet you’re worried, too. Seriously worried. The man that concerned you—that man, someone dear to you—you think it’s him. And you don’t know whether to hide or help.”
“If you insist,” Sherlock said, and went back to his notebook.
“She doesn’t,” he said. Idiot Horse nudged Sherlock again, as if to disagree.
The only significant obstacle to this scientific progress was John’s disapproval. Sherlock looked down at the far end of the home field, where John was turning the oxen. It took, by his pocket watch, seven minutes on average for John to cross the corduroy bridge over the creek and make the trip down to the end, then ninety seconds to turn and another seven to come back, barring any unforeseen encounters with clay holes. The seven minutes in which his back was turned were vital; Sherlock was certain that John would not countenance anyone climbing up to the roof of the old shanty with Philemon tucked under his arm, much less Sherlock with a plan to throw the goose off.
“You’re not so bad,” John said, rising. “Now take off your trousers and lie on your side on the settle.”
"Letter, Dr. Watson."
“Has there been any damage? Attacks?” Sherlock asked, and Mike shook his head.
The one thing he would not do was bring himself off with his own hand. He could not quite explain why, yet, and so he endured, hoping that an answer would come to him.
“Sherlock!” Stamford exclaimed, and Sherlock made his way cautiously forward. “Miss Kuskatoo,” Stamford said, smiling at her encouragingly, “This is Sherlock Holmes. I believe you might share certain interests. Sherlock, this is Miss Molly Kuskatoo. She is my new apprentice.”
“No. I’m fine.”
“And mine is my arse.”
“Well then,” said Mrs. Hudson, “If it isn’t Sherlock Holmes! Of all people, hidden away in the backwoods! Here I was worried that you were some stranger that was going to murder John!”
For a moment, everything was so silent that John could hear the tiny breeze rustling through the strawberry leaves.

“Um,” John said, “Haven’t you had your fill of manure outdoors?”
Well, he was a rational man, and he could rationally keep his hands to himself. And they were going fishing, after all, a most wholesome activity. There was no room for debauchery while angling.
A thump and a rustle seemed to indicate her agreement—or was it her desire to eat the handful of summer hay he had grasped to wipe the wall?
"It is," John said, rummaging for his trousers. "I've never been so worried to be outdoors before. It's bloody ridiculous."
“And yet I have done.”
"I'm not a complete idiot, John. I know this is a critical time."
"We'll stay together to the very end, then. And, you know, death isn't terrible. I'll find your mother there--she’s waiting for me.”
“You should hear what’s in his second sock drawer.” Sherlock giggled.
“So: Mrs. Hudson, Sally, Mrs. Dimmock, Mrs. Knight, Sarah Sawyer, Soo-Lin Yao, the Ojibway.” Sherlock leaped down from the settle and seized a notebook.
"Perhaps. Fall still can't come soon enough, though." Sally nodded, almost approvingly. Mrs. Hudson looked up, bright-eyed but serious.

"You're lowering your voice on purpose," John complained, but it wasn't a complaint, exactly. Sherlock's hand was around his cock, engulfing it completely, and John knew he didn't dare look. He wanted to, but he didn't dare.
They went to bed, but not to sleep. John could hear Sherlock’s irregular breathing, so different from his regular, quiet sleep. He himself was fighting away the memory of Sherlock’s flushed and submissive face; he rolled on to his stomach and shut his eyes. It had not been two weeks, though almost, and ceding to his animal urges was not helpful in any waySherlock’s own animal urges had been awakened today, and John wondered whether the man would allow himself to relieve them. Depending on nocturnal emissions was not an effective long-term strategy and could damage Sherlock’s nervous system.
Sherlock’s icy stare was almost as cold as outside.
Finally, after they had gone nearly a mile, he could not restrain himself any longer.
“So how did the tree get on the fire?” John asked, hoping to focus Sherlock’s thoughts.
"Once, when I was seven," Sherlock said, suddenly dreamy. "Mycroft took me to our nurse's farm. I spent the whole day exploring and didn't want to leave. But he made me. Stupid Mycroft."
"Sherlock is very resourceful, when he chooses to be. If he does not choose to be, you have my full permission to leave him to suffer the consequences of his actions."
“Today, John,” Sherlock said the next morning, as though he didn’t have a strained ankle and several significant contusions, “I am going to conduct a thorough survey of the environs. This” —he waved a government ordinance map— “is essentially useless to me. I should manage that by dark, I suppose.”
“You were withholding food. They don’t like that.”
"Back off, you bastard," John said, without heat. Byron's huge glistening cock was already out, and while John was profoundly uninterested in beasts (unlike, apparently, Anderson, who, Mrs. Hudson had intimated, had been dismissed from his previous place for certain irregularities in his care of the livestock) he could not help being impressed by the size of the bull's equipment.
Nothing.
Another drop fell from the tip of his cock, John noted with satisfaction.
“I get the pot to myself then?” John said. “Righto.”
“Don’t let the Widow Donovan sour you.”
John blanched. Hm. Perhaps that expression wasn’t as friendly as he had meant it to be, Sherlock thought.
“But it’s as recent as the damage at the base of the tree.” Sherlock examined it again.
“They were deeply unqualified.”
"No goats." Sherlock fell silent, his eyes flicking from John's face to John's cock. "This is fascinating enough."
“Frank?”
“Tired,” Sherlock said, finishing the tea. “Is there more?”
John watched Sherlock bang around the kitchen. He was clearly doing his best to suppress his agitation, but it was pervasive; in fact, his condition appeared to have worsened over the course of the afternoon. Anger—never far—surged through John. Why would the daft bastard not accede to his body’s demands? First the hypothermia, and now this! He was the most stubborn man John had ever met.
He ground his teeth in annoyance. Usually (well, the last two escapes) he had been able to catch Harry by the simple expedient of extending some tempting morsel through the door and seizing her by the collar as she craned her neck to take it. This would have worked at least one more time, based on the speed by which he’d been able to catch Harry before, but now it was out of the question, and they were in for a morning’s aggravation, no mistake.
What, exactly was Mycroft trying to do? John did not trust him in the slightest, and the appearance of this package at such a critical moment was highly suspect. Did he, Mycroft, believe that pelvic massage was medicine? He had mentioned it in his initial letter, certainly, but why press it? Prostate massage, on the other hand, John knew was medicine. He had seen men in later life unable to piss because theirs was so swollen; early evacuation would have helped, no doubt. Still, Sherlock hardly seemed in need right now, so John filed it away for later reference.
