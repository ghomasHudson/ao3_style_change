Gabe looks at his glass as if it knows the answer and then his focus shifts to Dean. “Hey Dean-o!” He waves energetically, spilling more of his drink. “This is great. I’m drunk, Michael is furious, Anna is MIA, Lucifer is probably getting high, dad’s helpless and you brought your boyfriend to meet the family at mom’s will reading.” He slaps Cas on the shoulder and giggles before downing the rest of his drink. “You can’t make this shit up man, I should film it.”
That comment seems to hit a little too close to home for Michael and before anyone can step in Michael’s fist connects with Cas’ face and knocks him on his ass. Dean sees red and immediately puts himself between Michael and Cas. He’s torn between checking on Cas and beating Michael to a pulp but before he can do anything Gabriel steps in and drags Michael out of the room. Dean pulls Cas to his feet and starts assessing the damage to his face.
Sam leaves for class with hesitancy, not wanting to leave Dean alone all day. Dean assures him he’ll be fine and that he’s not a damn child that needs constant supervision. He especially doesn’t need his little brother hovering over him all day and fretting about every little thing he does. Dean briefly considers bodily, shoving Sam out the door when he expresses his concerns, for the third time, about leaving. Luckily Sam is smart enough to get the hint and leaves of his own volition.
He sits in his car for ten minutes outside the bar before starting it up and driving off. He tells himself it’s because the bar looked packed and he really wasn’t in the mood for that many people. After driving around for another half hour he finds himself at the movie theater checking out movie times and ignoring the pitying look of the guy at the ticket booth. So what if he’s going to a movie by himself? People do that all the time.
Castiel groans when Charlie bounces into his office wearing a Santa hat and brandishing a plastic bowl full of paper scraps.
“Dean please, I need to be close to you. I need to know that you’re not leaving too.” Cas pulls him closer and Dean lets him. They lay back down and Cas slowly mouths at Dean’s neck.
The third time they see the man Cas turns away from Jack to place his order at the counter when the child takes off toward the door. Cas isn’t fast enough to get a hold of his hand but when he turns to follow he sees Jack skid to a stop in front of the drink swapping art connoisseur. The barista clears her throat and he quickly finishes his order, keeping an eye on his kid. Jack is bouncing around the man while he waits in line and instead of looking annoyed he’s chatting animatedly with the kid.
“Yes you do. Kali said you were free till two. I even chose a place within walking distance so it’ll be fast.”
“Daddy can Dean come play with us this weekend?” Jack asks a few minutes later. Cas considers the request. He doubts an attractive guy like that, would  want to hang out with him and his kid on the weekend. They barely even know each other but for some reason Jack has connected to him. Jack is a friendly child and he is not shy at all but it’s weird for him to latch onto one person like this. Usually he’d be saying hello to everyone in the coffee shop but the second he sees Dean it’s like no one else exists.
Cas’ heart shattered at the news. Here he was this whole week cursing Dean and being angry with the man when he was in the hospital. And then the knowledge that Dean wouldn’t remember him, or anything they’d been through over the last year, hit him hard. His shattered heart felt like it had been set on fire and then stomped on.
“Yeah, uh… Listen, I wasn’t following you. I recognized you at the coffee shop that first time and I knew you didn't recognize me so I didn’t say anything. I honestly never thought I’d run into you again after that. But then you were there the next day and the next day and by that point it felt too awkward, ya know?” Dean rambles and Cas has to admit, he understands what the guy means.
“I don’t know, Sam why did you bring up Cas?” Dean glares at his brother as if to silently convey a death threat if he reveals anything about what he may or may not know regardings Dean’s feeling toward Cas.
Charlie and Sam stand in a corner of the room with their heads bent over Charlie's phone, not looking suspicious at all. Dean points them out to Benny after they’ve been there for several minutes.
“So we can take them to the police and get a restraining order.” Sam says as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world. And Dean has to admit that it does make sense.
“What do you mean? Why doesn’t anyone know?” Dean can think of a few reasons why he’d keep something like this a secret but he’s still a little angry at being misled so he chooses to feign ignorance.
“I . . . it, it wasn’t . . . “ Cas took a deep breath. “Yeah.” He really didn’t want to talk about this.
“Please” he whispers brokenly “please, I’ve missed you so much and I just… I need…” He tries for another kiss.
Dean paces back and forth across his beroom floor for roughly ten minutes before storming back out. Sam, still on the other side of the door, prepares to be yelled at but is shocked when his older brother storms past him without a glance.
The smell of Mary’s pie brought back the memory of that moment and he suddenly felt like he’d never understood his mother better than just then. He now knew how she felt as she sat on the dirty kitchen floor and cried for her own mother. Before he can stop it a sob breaks free and startles everyone at the table. He hastily excuses himself and scrubs at his teary eyes as he darts out of the room in search of the bathroom.
While they listen to the story an elf walks to the group of parents with a signup sheet. She has them put their children’s names on the list if they want to have a picture with Santa and informs them that Santa will call each child up one at a time to take pictures. Eileen puts Mary’s name on the list and then hands it to Cas so he can jot down Jack and Clair’s names. After the story is finished Santa tells the children to wait on the rug until their name is called and Dean is surprised by how well they all listen. Dean sees the elf with the signup sheet walk over to whisper the first name into Santa’s ear, and he calls out the child’s name.
“You couldn’t even wait until after the funeral. You just had to come and rub your deviant lifestyle in all our faces.” Michael gets right in Cas’ face. “You disgust me.” He shoves Cas.
“That’s how you do it Charlie.” Dean gloats as he watches his little brother and Jessica flirt behind the counter. She couldn’t get Dean and Cas together in five months and it took all of five minutes for Dean to get Sam to ask out his cute coworker. Charlie flips him off and disappears in the back. Cas just rolls his eyes and sips at his peppermint hot chocolate.
“Nobody does.” Gabe pats his brother’s shoulder “But it is what it is.” and with that he leaves Cas alone to wallow in his misery.
“Yes Dean I know what it means, I even made sure to give you other gifts that held similar sentiments so you’d know I knew what I was doing.”
“Did I just hear it was time to eat?” He sniffs at the air and pats his belly. Sam and Cas roll their eyes but give him fond smiles.
“Wow, that sucks. I mean it’s a little crazy, like it’s the plot for a cheesy chick flick, maybe you should sell the idea to lifetime or something.” he jokes “What are you going to do?”
Before he can think better of it he’s sidling up next to Castiel and making a comment about how boring work christmas parties are. The man looks up at him with a confused expression and mumbles something along the lines of an agreement. Before his talk with Charlie, Dean would have automatically assumed his lack of response was due to him thinking he was too good to talk to Dean. But now he can see how the guys hands were shaking slightly. He really was nervous talking to Dean, of all people.
“Dean, what are you doing?” Dean jumps at the unexpected voice and bangs his head on the inside of the cupboard. He turns to see Jack standing in the doorway of the kitchen.
“I know but we’re with the FBI and we’d really like to hear it from you instead of read it in a report. Plus there might be something you missed, we’re just being thorough.”
Dean tries to hang back to ask Cas what’s wrong but his little brother excitedly starts telling him about a prank war he’d had with his friends the day before. Dean gives Cas a ‘what can you do?’ look and follows Sam into the kitchen.
Cas and Dean also lived in a state that was trying to repeal prop 8, and had plenty of laws in place that allowed people to refuse service or jobs to people on the bases of sexual orientation alone. They both just agreed to keep it private for the time being.
“Oh that’s a fun age” She nodded toward the toy cars and trains. “When my oldest was that age he loved toy cars and so did most of his friends. Trains too. Or if that doesn’t work you could try toy swords, guns, lightsabers, anything that makes a noise or a mess, coloring books, balls, pretty much anything really. Five year olds are pretty easy to please.”
“Mother” Gabe finally looks at Cas when he says it and tears start to stream down his face. “She’s gone Cas.” His voice breaks on the last word.
They take turns holding the newest Winchester and then they leave to let mother and baby get some rest. Sam tells them they can go home and get some sleep as well and Dean pulls him into a hug.
“Cool see you in a few.” She singsongs and then hangs up. Dean hastily gathers the box and it’s scattered contents and stuffs it back in his closet where he found it. He’s not sure whey he’s keeping it a secret but he knows he doesn’t want Sam to accidentally find it. It’s private and the things inside hold some kind of importance to him, even if he doesn’t remember what that might be.
Dean wakes late on christmas morning and as he walks toward the kitchen he can hear a low hum of voices. He wonder’s who Sam could be talking to when he remembers that Eileen had planned on staying with them for a few days. He’d gotten pretty drunk the night before and he vaguely remembered being manhandled into his room late last night or was it early this morning? Dean shakes his head and stumbles into the kitchen. The voices go silent almost as if they’re holding their breath. Dean doesn’t even spare them a glance as he makes a beeline to the coffee pot. For half a second he thinks he’s caught a glimpse of a tan trench coat but he ignores it. He knows it’s a trick of his subconscious, Cas isn’t there. Cas is never there, not since… Dean shakes his head again and focuses on not spilling the coffee.
“I got it!” A little voice yells excitedly from the other room and Dean rushes out to stop their four year old from opening the door by himself. He gets there in time to see Eileen on the doorstep saying hello to Jack.
Cas racked his brain for an appropriate story that wouldn’t give too much away. There were a lot of stories that he wanted to share with Dean. Stories he wanted Dean to remember. Like that time they broke Dean’s couch during an impromptu wrestling match over the remote. They’d propped it up so it looked fine and then when Sam sat on it later that evening, after Cas had left, it fell back down. To this day Sam still believes he was the one who broke the couch. Or When Dean bought Cas flowers for their first date only to find out that Cas was allergic to something in the bouquet. He had hives all over his hands and arms and Dean, upon realizing it was the flowers, snatched the offending things from Cas’ hands and threw them out the window. Cas had looked on in bewilderment and then started laughing. “I could have still put those in a vase or something. They wouldn’t have bothered me if I didn’t touch them.” Cas still teased Dean about the flowers, well, he did before  now Dean wouldn’t even know what he was talking about.
Dean nearly has an aneurysm while he stares at the proffered cup. Sharing popcorn is one thing but a drink is a completely different thing altogether. It’s so . . . intimate in a way, like, Cas’ mouth has been on that straw and if Dean takes a drink then his mouth will be touching the same straw. And yeah, Dean thinks, some people share food and drinks with their friends but he never has. He can maybe justify it with a boyfriend or something but not with a friend. He wants to though. He really fucking wants to. So he takes it and sips it, he doesn’t even know what kind of soda it is, didn’t even think to ask.
Jess: I know you said you were flying out to see your parents today but I’m guessing you probably ended up in the same boat as me and your flight got canceled.
“That’s ok, I don’t need gifts but I did bring a gift for you. Well I guess it's for you and Sam in a way, but mostly for you.” Jack smiles at him mischievously.
“325 South Prescott Street” Sam tells him and then points at a house to their left. “I think it’s that one”
He goes back to the group and tells them not to expect Dean or Cas back any time soon. No one asks him to elaborate.
“In a couple days. They wanna do a few more scans to make sure there isn’t any bleeding or swelling on the brain before they release him.”
“Oh, he tried to give me some bulshit excuse about studying when I invited him but after I, subtly, hinted that Dean would also be here, he changed his tune pretty quickly.”
When Mary’s turn rolls around she bounces up to Santa with a huge grin on her face and climbs up onto his lap. Eileen pulls out her camera and starts snapping pictures.
Jack looks at Dean like he can see right into his soul and Dean has the sudden realization that he probably can. Then his gaze shifts over Dean’s shoulder and he smiles knowingly. Hope flairs in Dean’s chest and he struggles to shove it down again. He’s frozen in fear, fear that if he turns there will be nobody there, or it’ll be Sam. Fear that if he turns he’ll see Cas but it won’t be Cas or maybe it will be, and that thought sends a whole new wave of fear. What would he say? What would he do? Jack gives a slight nod and then stands up.
He takes another long sip of hot coffee, bracing himself before he turns around. He knows what he’s gonna see and he knows it will hurt. They’ll be sitting at the table, sharing a ridiculously domestic morning with coffee and light conversation. They’ll be gazing across at each other with shy, private smiles and entwined fingers. And then they’ll notice him staring and they’ll feel bad, they’ll pull away from each other and invite him to sit with them. The conversation will be forced and awkward and he’ll bow out with some lame excuse and spend the next couple hours holed up in his room or driving around aimlessly until he doesn’t feel like his chest has been ripped open and his insides are spilling out.
“I was still sharing an apartment with my brother and it was quieter at Sam and Dean’s apartment with Sam gone most of the time.” Cas explained. Garth sympathized with how loud he knew Gabriel could be.
Castiel has been staring at Dean for a ridiculously long time. He’s sitting on Anna’s desk and chatting with her animatedly. Castiel finds himself desperately wishing he knew how to read lips so he could know what they’re saying. What business does Dean Winchester have with his secretary anyways? Dean looks up as if he could feel Castiel staring a hole through his head and their eyes lock for a moment. Castiel looks away, his cheeks flaming at being caught.
“Yeah” Sam smiles and he’s about to tell his dad to tilt the screen again when he sees Dean reach forward and do it. Finally he can see their faces. His mother beams.
“I never took you for a prude Sam” Dean chuckles uncomfortably. “I mean you and Eileen lived together for two years before you got married. Don’t expect me to believe you slept in separate beds that whole time.”
They look at each other and collectively agree that Dean, Jack and Cas should stay in the waiting room. Sam wheel’s Eileen down the hall behind the nurse.
They don’t see Dean again that week and then it’s christmas eve and Cas finds himself at the mall with Jack, yet again, dragging him to the line for Santa.
“Sorry I forgot. You don’t remember how close you and he were.” Sam says pointedly. Dean glares at him and Mary, sensing the tension between her sons steps in to defuse the situation.
“Hey Cas, sorry to call you after hours but I just received an email from Mr. Alistair. He needed a copy of the invoice. I can't find it in our files.”
“Come on Cas we can’t let them get away with that. Start making snowballs.” He hurls his creation at his brother, hitting him in the shoulder.
Gabe’s on the phone still but he motions for Cas to come take it. When he does he hears his father’s voice on the line and Fresh tears well up in his eyes. Gabe takes a calming breath and wipes his eyes while Cas talks to their father. He goes to the kitchen to start a pot of coffee and rummages through his brother’s fridge. He’s not actually hungry but it’s something to do and in the back of his mind he acknowledges that he hasn’t eaten anything since the night before and Cas probably hasn’t either. After a few minutes he settles on heating up some leftover pizza and taking a slice to Cas who nibbles at it for a moment before abandoning it on the coffee table.
“Last Christmas” he says with a shudder. “I can’t get it out of my head.” Sam looks at Dean who shrugs, neither of them know what song he’s talking about but they don’t ask.
“I tried to follow the directions Alice left. Her daughter got sick and I told her to go home and now I’ve ruined dinner.”
“I didn’t really have plans. My dad wanted to do a family dinner later so we could get things settled.”
“Dude, do you see what you left me to deal with?” Dean grumbles and Sam gives him a look that says ‘sorry, not sorry’”
He're a recipe for cream cheese sugar cookies. There's a frosting recipe on the website too but I alway do a cream cheese frosting on cream cheese sugar cookies so that's what I had Dean do.
“Daddy kissed Santa last night when he thought I was in bed and now you’re gonna get divorced like Katie’s parents and we’ll have to live in separate houses.” She sniffles.
He paused for a moment to watch their little faces as they slept, Dean curled protectively around Sam. They looked so innocent and vulnerable. Not that they didn’t always look innocent and vulnerable, but something about sleep made it more apparent just how young they were.
“Yeah buddy, that would be an easier gift to give you.” Santa clears his throat “I’ll have a talk with your friend and your daddy to set up a playdate”
The memory of his friend, Jack’s mother, still causes him pain. Especially on days when he feels like he’s failing her. When he’d agreed to be Jack’s guardian if anything ever happened to her he hadn’t expected her to die just a few days later. Jack was only a couple days old when Kelly invited Cas to come and meet him and that was when she asked if he would be Jack's guardian. She’d almost died giving birth to Jack and it had scared her, so as soon as she got out of the hospital she’d called up a lawyer and set up her will. She told Cas she’d named him as Jack’s guardian but if he wasn’t comfortable with it she could change it. He’d assured her that he was fine with it and then the next day she was rushed to the hospital. She’d gotten an infection from the complications during Jack’s birth and it hadn’t been detected early enough. It spread to her lungs and she was put on a ventilator but by that point the damage was too extensive. She’d died after a couple days in the ICU and Cas went home with a newborn baby.
“I said I loved it didn’t I?” He holds the scrap of fabric against his chest like he’s trying to protect it from Dean.
“Gabriel!” Cas admonishes as he pulls the phone out of his brother's hand. “You are not filming this, and I brought Dean for emotional support not because I want him to meet the family.” he hisses and shoves his brother’s phone in his pocket for safe keeping.
Cas beams at her and they spend the rest of dinner talking about the benefits of growing your own produce and other ways to be self safficient. Cas tells her about his dream of one day being able to raid bees and collect his own honey. Mary talks about her family raising chickens and how her mother always had a large vegetable garden in the backyard. They both lament about living in the city and the lack of greenery.
Cas just rolls his eyes and reaches for the door knob and then suddenly the door swings open. Mary grins at them from behind it.
“You want to go see what kinda food they got in this place? Maybe grab another drink?” He hooks a thumb over his shoulder toward the food. Cas nods and they spend the rest of the night talking and getting to know each other.
Sam smiles at his phone. He’s trying really hard not to imagine celebrating next christmas with Jess and introducing her to his family. It’s way too early for that but his heart doesn’t seem to care.
“Well, I honestly thought you were talking about some chick until you told me the story and I was like “wait, I’ve heard this before” then I remembered Garth’s friend Sam, Kali and I talked to him at the engagement party about his brother, and then I remembered you talking about some guy named Dean that you were doing a project with a few years ago. It wasn’t too hard to put two and two together.” He shrugs.
“No” Dean chuckles as he answers. He’d gotten Becky two years in a row and she’d been a little obsessive. That is, until the day she ran into him and Sam at the grocery store and her attention focused on the younger Winchester. “Though now that she’s set her sights on Sammy it would be a lot easier to pick a gift. Hell I could probably give her one of Sam’s socks and she’d love it.”
“That’s so cool buddy.” Dean releases his husband and goes over to get a closer look at the new toy. He finds a button that turns it on and the room is filled with lightsaber sounds.
“Ok, I get that, I honestly hoped I’d get over my hang ups about being out eventually, especially if I was seeing someone. But I can see your point.That still doesn’t explain why you didn’t tell me.” He levels Cas with a hard stare.
“Can I have your number?” Dean blurted out. “I mean just incase I remember something . . . about you.” Dean cringed at the awkwardness. “To check accuracy.” He finished lamely.
“Well I appreciated it Sam, and I’m sorry to hear about Dean’s accident.” Cas tried to sound casual.
“I would love to see you guys Sammy but I kinda had plans with Cas.” Dean tells him and hopes his little brother understands.
“No, I said his lease was up and he’d be staying with me until my lease was up and then we’d get a new place.” Dean corrects.
“Oh” Sam says and looks at the grouchy man huddled over his coffee at the table. He wonders how Dean knows what Cas is like in the morning but then remembers they were roommates in college.
“True, but I don’t mind spending it with your brother. I actually like him and Eileen.” Cas gives him an earnest look.
Dean pulls into his driveway just as his phone starts ringing. He puts the car in park and fishes the device out of his pocket.
Sam was next. “So for the past few months, I’m not sure exactly how long because I only noticed it recently but, for the past few months Dean has been humming softly under his breath. I really only noticed it when Madison pointed it out but when I thought about it I realized he’d been doing it for months.”
“I’m fine Dean.” Cas tries to reassure him. “Really. Don’t miss out on time with your family because of  me.”
“I should be apologising to you. My family just ambushed you like that. You don’t have to share a bed with me. I’ll sleep on the couch. I’m sorry they made you feel uncomfortable” He rassures Cas.
“Clair won’t get out of bed, and I want to open presets. Papa, tell her it’s time to get up” Jack whined.
They walk Sam and Eileen to the door. They’d offered to chat with them some more, maybe even open a bottle of wine and enjoy the rest of the evening without a kid around like they’d planned from the beginning. But Sam and Eileen can see how tired the two men are so they make an excuse to call it an early night and leave.
Jo is there soon after and the box is forgotten while the two get lunch and chat about the two years Dean is missing. It’s nice and Dean is thankful for his friend for thinking of him. It’s not until they’re getting ready to leave that Dean sees a flash of blue eyes and dark hair and his thoughts turn back to the secret hidden in his closet and the feeling nagging just below the surface. Something is not right in Dean’s world and he has no idea what it could be.
Mary had smothered her eldest son with kisses and bone crushing hugs the second she saw him. John rolled his eyes at his wife with a gruff “Kid’s fine, see? Still in one piece.” And if the hug he gave Dean lasted a little longer and was just a tad bit tighter than normal, well, neither of them said anything about it.
“Course not. We should get going though, if we don’t want to be late.” Dean motions for Cas to go get changed and then tells Sam they’ll be there to pick him up in a few minutes. While Cas is getting dressed Dean Calls his mom.
“Careful!” Cas admonishes but no one is paying attention. He sighs and decides to not make a big deal out of it. They've already had quite the morning and all he wants to do is enjoy his family. Dea smiles at him over the boy’s head and they share a moment of happiness as they watch their children.
“Trust me this will work.” Charlie whispers to Sam as she pretends to show him something on her phone.
Kali: And it’s nice to have someone to gripe to when you’re being exceptionally annoying. He gets it.
As the silence stretches on Dean panics. Maybe he’d read the situation wrong the guy probably had a date. Of course he had a date, she probably had to freshen up or whatever it is girls do, and sent him in to find their seats. No way this gorgeous guy would be going to a movie alone.
“Yes. Mommy said we’re getting a baby brother, but I don’t want a brother, I want a sister. So the new baby can’t be a boy.” Eileen shakes her head at her daughter's grievance and when Santa gives her a slightly panicked look she just shrugs.
“Oh, DVDs like Dean’s old cowboy movies?” Jack is excited to finally know what Sam is talking about.
“How much you wanna bet that those hoof prints came from a reindeer?” Dean whispers to Sam while the police tape off the area and collect evidence. All the cars in the area are on and they’re all blasting Run Rudolph Run by Chuck Berry.
“Oh they have, have they?” Dean says at the same time. Jessica nods solemnly. “Well, hate to burst your bubble dude, but I’m already seeing someone.”
“A couple months. I told you about him, remember?” Dean gives his brother a look like he’s lost his mind. “Speaking of, can I get a large coffee, black, and a peppermint hot chocolate?” He turns back to Jessica and she enters his order into the machine. She tells him the total and he swipes his card.
“Did a bag of flour explode in here?” He asks and Dean laughs before he realises that Cas was being serious. He genuinely thought that something had exploded.
They pull off the highway when they see the large sign lit up with christmas lights and an arrow pointing to the ticket booth for the light show. Cas drives up to the booth and a small woman leans out and gives him a cheery smile.
“Ok, yes, I was going to ask what I should get Dean.” Castiel decides to just be blunt about it. There’s no reason to hide it from her.
Cas rolls his eyes and takes his coffee with him into the living room. He’d have thought Dean would know by now that dairy products upset his stomach. He plops down on the floor in front of their tree and starts searching for the gift he’d hidden away in the back so Dean wouldn't try to snoop and see what it was.
“I love you.” Cas pants as he comes down from the high. Sweat and cum cooling on his exposed skin. Dean groans from his position next to Cas and then drags the shorter man in for a searing kiss, not caring about the mess between them.
“She just sold out her girlfriend like that?” Castiel asked. He almost looked offended on Charlie's behalf.
Cas turned to see a tall man with familiar eyes standing over him, he was holding a coffee cup in one hand and a cup of juice in the other.
“Go away Jack” she grumbled and pulled her comforter over her face. She didn’t want to see any of the presents that man brought and she definitely didn’t want to see dad.
He spots Charlie when Anna leaves his office and he has a sudden idea. Charlie and Dean are friends, he can pump her for information on a gift Idea for Dean. Castiel rushes out of his office and catches up to the petite redhead in the breakroom.
“Oh, Hannah.” Cas muttered when he realized whom Dean was talking about. “No, uh, that didn’t pan out. She moved to Phoenix last year.” The relief was plainly visible on Dean’s face. If only Cas would look at him to see it.
“Cut out her own heart?” Dean gives him a disgusted look. “And she was still walking and talking enough afterward to try and give it to some guy?”
“I’m fine, put the tree back in the base and hold it still while I screw it in.” He grumbles. Cas rolls his eyes but complies with the older Winchester’s orders. He doesn’t understand the point of cutting down a perfectly good tree just to dress it up and watch it die slowly, but the wistful look in Dean’s eyes when they drove past the tree farm the day before almost broke his heart. So, if he was the first person on the lot when they opened the next day and he spent two hours examining every tree until he found a perfect one to surprise his favorite humans with, well it was nobody’s business but his own.
“It’s fine Sammy. I blocked him on all social media and removed him from my contacts. He doesn’t even know where I’m staying and he won’t know where my new place is. If he bothers me at work Bobby will call the cops and we can see about a restraining order then. But I doubt he’s gonna be a problem anymore.” Dean tries to reassure him but Sam can think of plenty of other horrible things that could happen. Charlie points at her wrist and Sam nods.
“I loved you Cas!” Dean blurts out, he’s not sure why he said it but he knows it’s true. “I may not remember loving you but I know I did. Hell, I still do, I can feel it deep in my bones. It’s the one thing I’m sure of in this crazy, jumbled, mess of a life.”
“Cool, I’m glad you’re enjoying it kid.” There’s a smile in his voice that Cas can hear and it makes him smile.
“And there was nothing else weird about that morning? Any strange smells? Was it cold in the room?” Dean asks.
“What are you two up to?” He tries to take a peek at the screen but Charlie closes the laptop before he can see anything. Sam comes in shortly after and they get to work on a new case Sam found. Gift purchasing temporarily forgotten.
“Um, why is there a tree in the middle of the war room?” Jack asks. He’s squinting at the light and running his fingers through his sleep tousled hair. Sam wonders how the kid slept through all the arguing and general comotiong of putting the tree up.
A week later Dean and Cas fly into Cincinnati and Sam picks them up at the airport. He and Cas chat amiably while they wait for their luggage at the carousel and Dean grumbles about not having his car and how he almost died on the plane. Cas just rolls his eyes and tells Sam that Dean’s “near death experience” was just him freaking out over a little bit of turbulence which resulted in him swallowing his drink wrong and a coughing fit. Dean glares at the two of them but decides it’s not worth arguing over it. They’d just gang up on him anyways. Then he spots their bag and grabs it.
“I wasn’t ‘guilt tripping’ him. If I wanted to do that I would have reminded him that I told him to come out on the 21st instead of waiting until the 24th.” She argues. Sam can see his brother roll his eyes behind her back.
Gabe bangs his head on the fridge shelf, Lucifer chokes on his drink and starts coughing, Michael drops his phone and Cas looks up so fast he probably got whiplash. They all stare at their father and then Gabe starts howling with laughter. Pretty soon Lucifer joins in and they're both gasping for breath. Cas cracks a smile but tries to hide it when Chuck asks why that’s so funny.
They walked back to Cas’ office in silence, Gabe following him up to the fifth floor so he could say hi to Kali before he left.
“Just mix it around until it's smooth.” He hands  the mixer over to Jack and returns to his own task. He pours some vanilla and some almond extract into the bowl with the egg and then sets it aside. After Jack’s mixture is smooth Dean tells him to turn off the mixer and add in a cup and a half of sugar. Then he has the kid mix it again until it’s light and fluffy.
They’ve also run into the juice swapper two times at the coffee shop. The second time they see him waiting in line for his coffee, Jack runs over to show him the pictures he’d colored the day before. The man crouches down and examines each picture with interest.
Dean pulls him over to the couch and they arrange themselves in a comfortable position. He gently strokes Cas’ hair while the other man uses him as a pillow; silent tears soaking through his shirt.
After Cas left the other guests started to taper off too, leaving Dean and Sam to tidy up before heading to bed. Sam only managed five minutes after the last guest left before asking Dean about New York again.
“Why?” He drummed his fingers on the kitchen counter trying not to think of the time Dean had pinned him up against it and tried to sucked his brain out through his dick.
Sam gives them a short tour of their place while Eileen finishes making dinner. Sam tells Cas they have the guest room ready for him which earns him a weird, confused look from Dean as he rolls the suitcase into the room.
“Ok kid now put the mixer on low and keep going while I add in the rest of the wet ingredients.” After all the wet ingredients are mixed together Dean slowly starts adding in the flour, salt, and baking powder while Jack mixes.
“You only have a couple more dude. Just open them.” Charlie tells him and Jack looks at the partially opened gift with curiosity.
“Didn’t you already tell Santa what you want?” Cas asks warily. He’d hoped to avoid the mall but he’d realised last minute that he hadn’t gotten a gift for his brother Gabriel. He’d seen something at the mall the last time they were there but he hadn’t bought it because he thought he could find a cheaper one online. He couldn’t. So he’d dragged Jack to the mall on christmas eve with the vain hope that they could get in, get what they needed, and get out in under thirty minutes.
“Mommy and daddy and uncle Cas and uncle Dean and my dudes.” Ever since the twins were born Mary has referred to them as her dudes or baby dudes. Nobody knows how she came up with that but they suspect Charlie had something to do with it.
“Ok just because I don’t have my memories doesn’t mean I can’t detect bull shit. You’re lying.” Dean points an accusing finger at his brother.
Five minutes later, yes Dean was speeding, they pulled into the hospital parking lot and around to the front entrance. Jack jumps out and runs to grab a wheelchair while Sam and Cas help Eileen out of the car. They get her settled and then wheel her inside while Dean parks baby.
Cas goes to his room to get his phone while his brother talks to his girlfriend. His screen lights up with three missed calls and eight texts. He scans the ones from his family briefly, they’re all variations of “where are you” and “call me” and the voicemail from his dad is pretty much the same. Then he sees a text from Dean. It’s just a stupid meme about your crush liking you back but it makes Cas laugh and then he starts to cry. He scrolls through his contacts to find Dean’s name, barely able to see the screen through his tears, and hits the call icon. Dean answers on the third ring.
“I’m not really a genius.” Cas mumbles and his cheeks go red. “And of the two of us I’m the least intimidating.”
“Dammit. Sam!” Dean yells and tries to shield himself from the cold projectiles. Cas just stands there looking perplexed and then a well aimed snowball gets him right in the face. Dean’s lips twitch but he manages to hold back his laugh and crouch down to form his own snowball.
“Why didn’t you tell me you got your memory back?” Cas asks and gently strokes the side of Dean’s face with his thumb.
Bobby searched through the camping and fishing section of the store and found a pretty decent tactical knife and a whetstone. He was pleased with himself. Dean would like it now he just needed to get something for the little one.
“That’s probably for the best. We won’t be back for a couple hours and a burger would get cold in that time” Cas reasons.
“Sam, how many kids did this guy have?” Dean’s still looking at the stockings hanging above the fireplace.
Dean flops down on his bed and pulls out his phone. He’d felt it buzz while he was arguing with Sam but he didn’t check because he knew his stupid brother would ask about it. Especially when he saw Dean’s reaction to the message and Dean knew he’d react to the message. If it was Cas he’d grin like an idiot and if it wasn’t he’d probably look like a kicked puppy
Cas flops down face first on his bed. The weight of the last few days holding him down and he silently wonders if it was all really worth it. All the secrets and lies? In the end all they did was cause him heartache.
I had no idea where I was going with this story and I stayed up way late writing it. sorry in advance if it's a little disjointed.
“You’re the only one who thinks that. All of our friends constantly complain about how 'disgustingly domestic’ we are.” Dean says, quoting their friend Crowley.
“I don’t mind” the stranger assured him. Cas hesitated. He shouldn’t let his child drink something from a complete stranger but the man seemed so sincere and he’d stopped Jack’s tantrum dead in its tracks. Cas caught sight of the clock on the wall behind the man and internally cursed. He was so late.
“You know what I meant,” Dean parks the car. “With all those lights on it’s gonna be next to impossible to get in unseen.”
“I wore the suit home because I thought daddy would think it was funny to see me with a big fluffy belly and a white beard. He kissed me last night, not the real Santa. The real Santa didn’t come until we were all in bed.”  She looks between both her fathers and Dean nods enthusiastically to everything Cas says.
“Last minute christmas shopping.” Sam explains and starts digging through the rows of records. He selects a few of Dean’s favorites and then walks up to the counter to check out.
Dean really was not in the mood for a dinner party. He wasn’t in the mood for guests at all but Sam was so sure that these people would help him regain the two and a half years he’d lost. It was weird enough waking up in a hospital and having some nurse tell you that you were two years in the future but now he was expected to entertain friends he didn’t even know? Maybe for them it wasn’t weird but for him it was like time traveling and then being expected to take over his future self’s life with no knowledge of what had happened in the years he skipped.
Mary and Sam give Dean identical looks of disappointment. As if he was the one that upset Cas. Dean turns to his dad who’s been suspiciously quiet the whole time. John shrugs and leaves the room. He’s never been good with feelings so he usually just lets Mary handle the emotional stuff. Dean looks back at his mom and brother.
When he’s out of the shower and getting dressed Cas comes in the room and flops down on their bed dejectedly.
While he examines the fabric he has a mental image of Castiel grabbing hold of it and pulling it’s wearer in close for a messy, desperate kiss. He can imagine what it would be like to have the handsome man hold him hostage with the fabric looped around his neck. Again, it seems more real than just a fantasy, as Dean winds and unwinds the tie around his hands. He gets lost in the fantasy of what he and Cas could do with that tie and he feels himself growing hard at the mental images being conjured.
“Go rinse this off and dry it” he instructs the kid. If he’s gonna be in the kitchen Dean will put him to work. Jack doesn’t complain like Sam would he just does what he’s told.
“Dean, I want this. I need this right now. I love you and I really just need you to shut up and give me the comfort of being close to the one I love. Maybe later I’ll be ready to talk about things and maybe I won’t but right now what I really need is You. In. Me. Ok?” Cas levels Dean with a stare that brooks no argument. “I want to not think about everything that’s going on right now. Just for a little while. I don’t want to think about anything but you and me. That’s all I want, please.” He reaches down to pull Dean’s shirt off and Dean lets him.
“Dean!” He calls and his brother saunters over. He says something to their parents but Sam can’t hear it and when he hovers over their window he can see they’re muted. His mother is saying something to the computer and then she looks back at Dean who shrugs.
It was just a light peck on the lips. He didn’t even think about it. It just happened. Just like that, and it felt so natural. He turns back to Cas with an apology already forming on his lips. Cas is staring at him with a shocked expression but his pupils are blown wide and a pretty blush is painted across his cheeks. Dean’s seen that look before. He knows he has, he can’t quite say where he’s seen it but he knows what it means. He’d be willing to bet money that the same look is on his face as well. He takes a step closer and pulls Cas into another kiss.
“Dean’s a pretty simple man, he likes classic cars, old music, and cowboy boots.” Castiel nods, his mind already running through possible gift ideas.
“Oh please have you seen the way he and Cas look at each other? I didn’t realize it until just recently but it makes total sense. And what you did tonight in front of your parents was uncalled for. He’ll come out when he’s ready and you really shouldn’t have interrogated him like that.”
“I thought I heard someone out here. Come in, come in” she ushers them inside. “Dean why don’t you put that stuff in your room? You must be Cas. Dean talks about you all the time.” She grabs his arm and starts leading him toward the living room without even a backwards glance at her first born. Dean stares after them, dumbfounded.
“I hope they didn’t have to put in too much effort.” He bites his bottom lip and Dean has to fight the sudden urge to reach up and run his thumb across it.
“No, I'd love to meet your family.” Cas quickly reassures him. “You’re right, food sounds pretty good right now. If you don’t think they’d mind.”
“No, it’s fine. I graduated with a Masters in business and a minor in Architecture with an emphasis on real estate and development. My uncle offered me a job at his company after I graduated. They own some apartment complexes in the area and they’re looking to expand.”
“I wish you’d taken an earlier flight. Then you’d be here having a home cooked meal and your family and you wouldn’t be stuck in that awful snow storm all alone.”
“Good idea.” Dean says and then hangs up. Jack starts to laugh with excitement and Sam shushes him. They wait for the tell-tale sound of the door creaking open and then when Dean calls out for Sam they both jump up and start hurling snowballs at the two unsuspecting men.
“Yeah, it’s all planned out in mother’s will. She was always very efficient and she liked to have things in order. So it’s no surprise she had a plan for after she died but it does make it feel a little rushed.” Cas explains.
“Told you” Cas teases him and Dean stares back and forth between him and Charlie’s retreating figure.
Clair watched as a man dressed in a red suit and hat came into view and walked right up to her dad. She quickly stifled her squeal with her hand and hoped the grownups hadn’t heard the slight squeak that escaped. She did not want to be put on the naughty list for being out of bed after bedtime or for spying on Santa. They didn’t look in her direction so she figured she was in the clear.
“Sugar cookies, for Christmas.” Dean hands him a rolling pin and the opened bag of flour. Then digs around in a shopping bag for the cookie cutters he’d bought earlier.
“Yeah sure.” Cas says and tips his popcorn tword Dean. Because he knows Dean wanted popcorn but couldn’t justify the cost and Cas always buys one because: how can you not buy popcorn at the movie theater?
“I think we’ve done enough research for now. What do you say we go out for a little bit?” Cas asked.
“Hey kid, didn’t expect to see you here.” Dean takes his coffee and sits across from Jack. “Thought you were busy being God and all.” he waves his hand vaguely in Jack’s direction.
Dean stretches out across the couch and plops his feet in Cas’ lap and the angel absentmindedly massages them while they watch the kid get his tongue stuck to a pole. Sam notices but doesn’t comment.
Dean just grunts and pours himself a large cup of coffee after a few sips a strip of bacon he answers.
“Was this playing when you came downstairs or did he have music playing on a different device?” he points to the record player.
“Oh that poor boy.” Mary gasps and then tears start to build in her eyes. “Why didn’t Dean tell me? I could have… I … We just prattled on about stupid things and the whole time he was dealing with that. He probably thinks we’re all insensitive and rude.”
“You don’t have to apologize Cas.” Dean ribbs his back and then they hear a tentative knock at the door.
“Where the hell are you?” The small voice bellows. Cas grabs Jack's phone and hits the speaker icon.
“Are we gonna put an angel on the top?” Cas and Jack have twin looks of confusion at Dean’s question.
“Hi, I’m Dean Winchester. I’ve heard a lot of great things about your work and I can’t wait to work with you.”
“Rules are rules babe.” Charlie’s girlfriend Dorothy says with a smug little smirk. Dorothy knew about the mistletoe and she’d been against the whole thing. So it was safe to say she was a little pleased with it all blowing up in Charlie’s face, even if it meant her girlfriend would have to kiss a large cajun man.
“Um no, we’re new to the area and our neighbor told me about it. I thought it might be fun to check out.” Cas chats with the woman easily and Jack’s phone starts ringing. He gets a big smile on his face when his screen lights up with Dean’s name and he answers excitedly.
“Oh, just a package that I had to sign for.” He holds up the package in question and then deposits it on the counter.
“But what if he drops them? Clair can be quite a handful and if Jack is in one of his moods he’ll do that thing where he suddenly goes boneless. I’ve almost dropped him a few times when he’s done that because I wasn’t expecting it.”
“I promise I won’t read too much into it if that’s what you’re worried about. I know you don’t like me like that.” Dean scuffs the toe of his shoe against the floor and looks anywhere but at Cas. He feels very vulnerable talking about this and he could really use that black hole right about now.
“Dean Winchester, stealing Santa’s cookies?” Santa tsked, “I might just have to put your name on the naughty list. And you were so close this year” Santa shook his head mournfully.
“I don’t think I can do that.” Cas sighs and Dean tries not to let the hurt show on his face. He knows Cas doesn’t see him like that but it’s different hearing it straight from Cas himself. He immediately goes on the defensive.
“Ok, so we know where she ran into the first to vics but what about that last guy? What was the connection there?” Sam asks the next morning while they’re packing up their stuff. Dean just shrugs.
“Yeah, I’m here and no we’re not…” Dean starts to deny it but then he looks down and sees that Cas is awake. He’s propped his chin up on Dean’s chest and he’s looking at him curiously with bright blue eyes that are still a little red and puffy from crying. Fuck it Dean thinks. He’s tired of hiding. “Yes we’re back together.” Dean gently strokes his thumb across Cas’ cheek. Cas looks even more confused.
He’d actually fallen asleep and he jumped when Cas said his name, dropping the book on the floor with a thud.
Cas rushes out of the movie theater as soon as Dean is out of sight. He’d almost kissed the other man several times throughout the movie. He’d lean over to comment on something or steal a kiss, like they used to do before, and then remember everything and reluctantly pull himself back. Having Dean that close was the best and worst thing that could have happened that night. He really needed to talk to someone about it.
“Yeah!” Sam cheers “I’m starving” he rubs his little belly. Bobby chuckles at that and ushers the children into the kitchen to start breakfast. He finds himself hoping John will take his time, while he fries up some eggs. Sam is running around his kitchen with his rocket ship, making his own sound effects, and Dean stuffs two Reese's peanut butter cups in his mouth at once.
“Maybe” he said with a grin. Clair wanted to face palm. Her dad was gonna be in so much trouble with Santa.
“Yeah, well I saw the way you played with Anna’s new dog the other day and you were so happy. I wanted you to be happy like that all the time.” Dean mumbles and looks away embarrassed. Cas sets the puppy on the floor and climbs into Dean’s lap, pulling his face around for a deep kiss.
“Wait, how many people are coming to this thing?” Dean calls after him but Sam is out the door before he finishes his sentence.
“That sounds great. Race you to the exit.” She laughs and then shoots across the ice away from him. He wobbles a little but takes off after her; almost crashing into another couple.
“Uh . . .” He looked at the expectant faces of Dean’s friends and family, at a loss for words. A loud buzzing sound broke the silence and Cas barely managed to stop the massive sigh of relief when he realized it was his phone vibrating.
“I’m not.” Dean argues and then he sees Charlie. “Hey Char, am I intimidating?” He asks her and she gives it a montents thought.
“I heard about Dean. Is he alright?” Cas’ ears perked up at the name and he pretended not to listen to Garth and Sam’s conversation.
“I’m bored” Sam whines as soon as John leaves the room. They’re in some little podunk town in Montana and John left Dean in charge of his little brother while he went out to track down a lead. Dean grumbled at being left to watch Sam but John just gave him a stern look and told him to keep the doors and windows locked and to not let Sam out of his sight.
“Kid you just made my day.” The guy wipes his eyes and pats Jack on the shoulder. “I can’t wait to tell my wife about this.” Jack is confused but he smiles at the man anyway. Sam just shakes his head.
“Wait, you were talking about Cas?” Charlie gives him a ‘duh’ look. “I’m sorry I doubted you Charlie. If I’d just agreed back then I could have met him a lot sooner.”
“Why does this friend care about this girl? Does she like you too?” Mary is still trying to get information out of him.
“Look who’s under the mistletoe.” He giggles and Charlie wants to murder him. Benny looks up and then quickly back down at the little redhead next to him. His face flushes in embarrassment.
Cas stands rooted on the spot, staring at Santa. He’s finally matched the voice with a face. He’s not sure if he should be creeped out with the whole situation or if he should wait until he’s spoken to the man before he decides how he feels about it.
“Why wouldn’t I stay with him? I’m not gonna let him celebrate Christmas alone Sam.” Dean immediately goes on the defensive.
Three hours pass and they’re each allowed to go in and visit with Eileen while they wait. Dean was hesitant when Sam asked him if he wanted to see her. He was expecting blood and gore and lots of screaming but what he saw was a clean room and some machines beeping away while Eileen chewed on some ice chips. He chatted with her for a good half hour, stopping periodically when a contraction hit and she’d have to take slow steady breaths through clenched teeth. Nurses busseled in and out to check on her. When Sam asked what was taking so long the nurse just gave him an indulgent smile and asked if it was their first. At his nod she proceeded to tell him that the first one usually took the longest and it could be a while.
“I’m sorry Dean. Earlier they asked me all these questions about how we met and if we had any special plans for while we were here and then Sam asked how long we’d been dating and that was when you came in the room and I didn’t get a chance to warn you. I’m so sorry.” Cas babbles.
Sam walks into the kitchen to see what’s taking them so long and then slowly backs out when he sees them.
“My parents are gone too.” Sam blurts out. “I mean, just uh… I know how hard it is on the holidays.” He’s babbling and he can’t stop. He used to be good at this but ever since Jess he’s lost the ability to not be awkward around beautiful women.
“Hey Dean I can’t get the entrance to the garage open. I think it might be frozen shut. Will you come out and help?”
The therapist turns out to be legit and it feels like they’re back at square one. They head to the hospital in hopes of getting more information from the third victim but when they get there they find the guy dead in the middle of the parking garage. He looks like he’s been trampled by something with hooves.
Once he’s got everything in the bowl Dean comes over and plugs in the hand mixer, showing Jack how to turn it on and mix the butter and cream cheese together.
“Ow, fuck! Cas, hold it still!” Sam looks up with amusement at the large fir tree that appears to be swearing at the angel. Castiel huffs and lifts the tree effortlessly revealing Dean crouched behind it sucking on a finger that got pinched between the tree trunk and the base.
They spend the rest of the evening sipping hot cocoa and introducing Jack and Cas to classic christmas movies.
“I mean, your table only has four chairs. Maybe he just wants us to set a stack of plates and silverware on the table and we’ll eat in the living room like we did last time people were here.” Cas guesses.
“I don’t know, is the volume turned down?” Sam can hear his father pressing random keys on the keyboard.
Cas calls them to dinner a little while later and Jack whines about having to put away his toys until Eileen turns it into a game. Sam smiles at how easily she connects with his nephew. He knows he shouldn’t be surprised she works with children at Cas’ school so obviously she’s good with kids.
“That’s mother for you. Efficient even in death.” They both chuckle sadly and then Gabe wraps his arms around his younger brother in a bone crushing hug.
The rest of the week continues in the same fashion of long conversations with Cas at night and then suddenly it's Friday. Dean finds himself angrily buttoning up a blue dress shirt at 5:53 that night. He’d hoped he’d find a way out of this stupid thing but Madison kept bringing it up and she was so damn excited about it. He felt guilty even thinking of trying to get out of it. It’s not until the doorbell rings that Dean realises he never once asked who was invited.
“What can I do?” Cas sighs. “It’s over and as much as I'd like to get back together we’d still be in the same spot we were in before. The relationship wasn’t going anywhere and that still hasn’t changed.” Cas realizes he’s giving away way more than he originally intended to, but it’s been months of silence on the subject and he never realized how much he craved talking to someone about it.
“You can go find a place on the rug. Mommy and I will just be back here with uncle Dean and uncle Cas.” She runs over to an open space and plops down.
“Dean, are you afraid of Santa?” Cas tries to hide his smile. His big tough husband, afraid of Santa Claus.
Dean barely glances his way when he pokes his head into the ‘Dean Cave’ to say goodbye. Jack and Cas both wave him away distractedly. They're in the middle of a Lord of the Rings marathon and are too engrossed in the films to pay Sam any mind.
“Do you get to color and play trains there or do you have to read lots and lots of papers like daddy?” Jack asks him and Dean chuckles.
“She doesn’t always agree with Charlie's shenanigans. She won’t stop them but she also won’t lie about them. I’ve learned that if I ask her she’ll tell me the truth.” Dean says and then pats his stomach with satisfaction.
“It’s a Christmas tree.” Dean says as if the nephilim knows anything about Christmas. Jack just squints at him even more and Dean is struck, yet again, with how much the kid reminds him of Cas. “It’s a tradition, you put up the tree and Santa leaves presents under it on Christmas Eve.”
Cas sighed after hanging up on his brother and turned to face the people in the other room only to find Dean standing behind him with a perplexed look on his face.
When Dean looks back to Sam and Charlie they’re both gone and he frantically searches the room for them. He knows, he just knows they’re up to something and he will not get caught with his pants down. Not this time.
Later that night they go back to the first victim’s house and they do find a hex bag in the record player. They search the second victim's house but don’t find anything until Sam remembers that her boyfriend said the music was playing on her phone so they break into the evidence locker at the police station and find one in her purse. It takes them considerably longer to shovel enough snow out of the third victim’s room so they can get to the alarm clock. Sam pops the battery out and finds the hex bag stuffed inside the clock. After that they go through each victim's lives with a fine toothed comb to try and find any connection but they’re unable to find any leads.
“Still in the hospital, but he insisted I come tonight. Said he was sick of seeing my face.” Cas’ heart immediately sped up, why is Dean in the hospital?
Cas momentarily forgets everything that’s happened over the past few weeks and offers his drink to Dean as well. After months of dating the man he learned his habits pretty well. He didn’t buy snacks at the theater but he always wanted them. He could eat a whole thing of popcorn by himself if he had a drink to go along with it and he liked to put sour patch kids in the popcorn because, strangely enough, the sweet and sour candies mixed really well with the salty, buttery popcorn.
“But what if he doesn’t want to be with me?” Cas cringes at how ‘high school melodrama’ that sounded.
“Not really. I woke up and I could hear Christmas music downstairs and I went down to see if breakfast was ready.” The girl informs him. “Dad likes to play christmas music in the mornings while he cooks breakfast.” She said with a wistful smile.
“No, of course not. But Eileen and I are a couple.” Sam waves a dismissive hand and Cas shifts uncomfortably on the other side of the room.
“Morning Clair bear. You ready for waffles?” Her dad smiles as he slides a waffle on the plate in front of her. She glares at him and doesn’t answer. He looks at Cas for an answer to the sour mood but Cas just shrugs.
“Gabriel?” Cas says a little louder. He’s really starting to worry about his brother who, at the  moment, looks a little lost.
“Yeah, Uh, you’ll have to tell me more about that trip to New York. Sounds like we had quite the experience.” Oh you have no idea Cas thought. Remembering the night they had after that show. The unbearably long taxi ride back to the hotel and the frenzied rush to remove each other’s clothing once they were finally alone in their room. How he’d pinned Dean to the bed and took him slowly. Each thrust pulling broken moans from the man beneath him. He’d told Dean he loved him that night and to his surprise Dean had said it back without hesitation.
“He was frozen solid in a room with a fire burning in the fireplace and a heater that was working just fine. His kids found him in the morning when they woke up.”
Dean beams at him and even though he’s still pissed at Sam and Charlie for their meddling he also thinks he should thank them for it.
“Cas!” Dean yells at him “Get to work, this is war.” Cas quickly snaps into action and starts forming his own projectiles. Dean laughs with mirth and darts back and forth trying to dodge snowballs. He and Sam haven’t had a snowball fight in decades and he’s loving it. His fingers are frozen, there's melting snow sliding down the back of his shirt from a snowball he took the the back of his head, and, unlike Sam and the kid, he and Cas don’t have their own wall to hide behind so they’ve definitely taken more direct hits but it’s still one of the best days he’s had in awhile.
“Yeah I was trying to give you guys space it looked like a monster of a project and Dean was really stressed about it being worth fifty percent of your grades.”
“I know but it's locked. That's why I'm calling you. Where is the key?” Her response sounds tired and a little exasperated.
“If I tell you then you’ll be upset and we’ll have to live in two houses and we won’t have christmas together ever again and--and I hate Santa!” She sobs and buries her face in her arms. Her parents and little brother stare at her in shock.
“Jack, why don’t you go help daddy with breakfast and Clair and I will meet you downstairs in a minute.” Cas plucked the boy off the bed and set him on his feet in the doorway. He gave him a light swat on the bottom to get him moving then he turned to the sullen little girl hiding under her covers.
Kali: No, this isn’t normal Monday Cas. This is slamming doors and I could kill you with a glare Cas. And just because you haven’t spoken to him since Friday doesn’t mean it’s not your fault. I haven’t seen him this angry since that time you tried to bake a cake and destroyed his oven.
Dinner starts off a little awkward as the two men dish up their plates. Dean is mentally freaking out over what to say to Cas while he dishes up. He can’t help but reflect on how much this feels like an awkward first date. Or is it a second date? They did have that whole movie date/not date thing the other day. But does it really count as a date if the other party isn’t aware of it? Dean spends a stupid amount of time looking down at his plate trying to get up the courage to start a conversation. He glances up briefly through his lashes and sees Cas’ eyes shift off to the side as if he’s embarrassed at being caught staring. Dean clears his throat.
The swish of fabric alerts him to the person standing behind him and he takes a steadying breath. He’s fighting a battle inside his head. He wants to turn but he doesn’t either. It’s like the cat in the box thing, Cas is both there and not there. And then two little words break the silence and Dean’s world crashes around him for a second before sliding into its proper place.
“I’m sorry I’ve been such a dick to you.” Dean blurts out when the silence gets to be too much for him.
“I have no idea, I would take a tissue sample and run a toxicology report on it but he’s still frozen. I’ll have to wait till he thaws.” Sam pulls on a glove and gently prods at the dead guy's hand. He pulls his hand back, startled at how cold it feels.
“Hey guys, I gotta run and pick up Madison, her car’s been acting up. Why don’t you guys get the table set and well be back in a few.” He says as he grabs Dean’s car keys and rushes out of the kitchen.
“Dean…” Cas starts but stops. He understands how Dean is feeling but he doesn’t want Dean to leave things with his brother on a bad note. They’ve always been so close and Cas would hate to be the reason they stop talking.
By the time they get back to the bunker the kid is out cold in his booster seat. Cas carries him in and deposits him on his bed while Dean and Sam head into the library to finish some research they’d been doing on a case for Clair.
“Two years ago yeah. But you barely even flirt with women when we go out anymore.” Sam’s words don’t really come as a shock to Dean. He’d been getting tired of flirting with women all the time. They really just didn’t do it for him and he found the constant pretending exhausting. Maybe two years of that finally just wore him down.
“Cas” Dean turns and sees the man standing in the kitchen doorway and he has to catch his breath as his mind screams “he’s here” over and over again.
Eileen grins at him and then pulls him to his feet. “I do believe you promised me hot chocolate.” She says and starts pulling him toward the car. Sam just smiles and laces his fingers through hers.
“We missed you too kid, and you can visit any time you want. This is still your home and we’re still your family.” Dean tells him and he really means it. He was angry with Jack and it took him a long time to forgive him but Jack was still his kid. No matter what, that didn’t change.
“I’m good Gabe. I promise.” He pats his brother's shoulder and ushers him to the door. “Tell Kali not to worry about me.”
“At our age don’t you think we should be above office gossip?” Cas thanked the young woman handing him his food and then turned back to Gabe.
It’s just Sam and Eileen finishing the movie together and they barely notice when it’s been over twenty minutes since Dean and Cas had left to put Jack in his bed.
“Dad said he tried to call you but you didn’t answer. He figured you were probably still asleep and asked if I could come over here. We should probably call him back.” Just as he finishes speaking his phone rings.
“No wonder I keep you around.” Dean laughs. Cas grins at the joke but his heart breaks just a little too. Dean used to say that all the time. Every time Cas made him a pie Dean would say “I’m gonna have to keep you around” or “I might marry you if you keep bringing me pie”
“Talk to me about what?” Cas asks as he walks into the room. He bends down and presses a kiss to the top of each baby’s head and then walks over and gives Dean a peck.
“Charlie, I have a question to ask you.” He says before he’s even thought of a way to ask her about Dean without her knowing he’s asking about Dean.
“That was quite the comeback.” Sam yells after him. “Dinner will be at six on friday. Wear something nice.” He adds before he hears his brother’s door slam shut.
“I put in the effort. His secretary Anna said he only has four ties that he wears on rotation. I’m getting him a fifth so he has one for each day of the week” Dean defends himself. He knows it’s a lame gift but he really hadn’t gotten much out of Anna and nobody else in the office really talked to him. Or rather, he didn’t really talk to anyone else in the office.
After Cas hears Dean putter around the kitchen for a few minutes, just long enough to start a pot of coffee, he decides he might as well get up. It’s earlier than he’d like but it’s also Christmas morning and they’re going over to visit Dean’s parents in a couple hours.
She slowly leans in and presses a gentle kiss to the tip of his nose and then to the corner of his mouth. “I’m sorry you fell.” She presses one more kiss to his lips and looks up at him with puppy eyes.
“I don’t know if now’s the best time to say this, seein’s how we just got done fucking, but I love you more than I ever thought I could love another person.” Dean says shyly after breaking away from the kiss. Cas’ answering smile is blinding and then they’re kissing again. Hands grasping at exposed, damp, flesh while tongues explore and legs entwine. Things are starting to heat up and Dean’s sure he’ll be ready for another round soon.
“Dean the Santa has probably dealt with lots of boneless children. It’s actually a pretty common malady in young children” Cas quips and Dean gives him an unamused look.
“Do you wanna tell me about it?” He asks after she’s climbed into his lap and snuggled against his chest. She deliberates for a moment and then shakes her head.
“How are you feeling?” Dean asks. Cas grunts in response and sits up enough to prop his chin on Dean’s chest.
“Hey buddy.” Sam loves his nephew but he kinda wishes he would go bother his dads and give him some time to get acquainted with the beautiful woman in front of him.
“Because we’ll remember and hopefully we’ll get some cute pictures out of it. It is our first Christmas with them. Don’t you want to have the whole christmas experience?”
Ten minutes later found Cas sitting at a table alone with a plate of food while his brother and Kali went to track down some alcohol. He could see Garth and his fiancé a few feet away and if he paid attention he could hear snatches of the conversations they had with their guests. He stared at his plate of food as his good mood from earlier started to fade. He thought this would be a nice way to take his mind off of things and catch up with an old friend but it really just served to add salt to the wound. All the happy couples chatting and celebrating made him insanely jealous and bitter. Why did all of these people get to be with the ones the loved but he couldn’t? What had he ever done to deserve this?
After that they talked. Neither of them had come out yet. Dean was worried how his father would take it. He was one of those macho types who served in the marines and made no secret of his feelings toward gay men. Dean said his father was never outright rude or anything but he definitely didn’t “agree with the lifestyle.” Dean’s mother never said anything one way or the other so he didn’t know how she would react, and he really wasn’t looking forward to finding out any time soon, same went for his younger brother Sam.
“Give me that.” Dean snatches the paper out of his hand and scans it quickly. Sam resists the urge to tell Dean to keep his eyes on the road.
“Oh, he uh, asked if I could help him find a mommy because his daddy really missed his mommy and it made him sad sometimes when he talked about her.” Tears well up in Cas’ eyes.
Michael leaves immediately followed by Lucifer and then Cas offers to drive Gabe’s car home and assures his father that he’ll make sure Gabe is safe in his apartment with Kali before he leaves him. Chuck tries to apologize to Dean and Cas for Micheal’s behaviour and they wave away his apologies. It’s not his fault his son is an asshole. He does invite them to do dinner again, just the three of them so they can get to know each other better and Cas reluctantly agrees. He’s not sure how to feel about his father’s acceptance. He’d always known his mother would not approve and probably disown him but he’d never been sure about how his father would react. So his acceptance confuses Cas.
Later that night after Sammy is tucked in and fast asleep Dean gets rid of the candy wrappers and their sled before John gets back. He knows he disobeyed a direct order from his father but he’d do it again in a heartbeat if Sammy asked him to.
“No, honey.” Cas says at the same time Dean says “Never.” She pauses a beat while she considers everything she’s heard and then she shrugs.
Dean doesn’t pick up and while Charlie is having a meltdown over his uncooperative brother Sam finds himself suddenly taking over the cash register, again, because Jessica has disappeared in the back to get more straws. Just in time for the other source of Charlie’s annoyance to place his order. Sam’s ready to key in the man’s usual order when he hears his least favorite word come out of the guy’s mouth.
“I’m sorry Benny. It’s not you, it’s just the thought of kissing any man that makes me feel icky.” She apologises when she realises how her reaction might make him feel uncomfortable. But he’s a good natured guy so he just shrugs it off and gives her a smile.
“Look, you can watch cartoons.” He tells Sam and then goes back to sharpening his pocket knife. Sam folds his arms across his chest and pouts, refusing to even look at the tv.
“Might as well give these deviants what they want. It don’t have to be anything special, just a quick peck between friends.” He reassures her. She screws her eyes shut and pushes up on her tiptoes to plant a quick kiss to his lips. The kiss lasts less than half a second but they both pull away with red faces and look anywhere but at each other. The party guests all cheer and then someone asks if they can cut into the pie yet and that’s when they learn that the pie has disappeared. In the middle of all the excitement Dean had snuck in behind Benny and Charlie and grabbed the pie but his attempt to make a clean break with it was thwarted by Castiel. Dean offered him half the pie for his silence and after a very short, like, almost nonexistent, deliberation he agreed and the two of them snuck out the back door with the pie and two forks.
His hand reaches forward without being told to and swipes the white foam off Dean’s face before Cas remembers that he’s not allowed to do things like that anymore. He freezes with his hand still in the air between them when he realises just what he’d done. Dean looks almost as stunned as him and then a bright red blush spreads across his face and he steps back and swipes at the same spot Cas had just touched.
“So, someone or something is using Christmas songs to kill people?” Dean asks around a mouth full of food a while later.
“Not much, he doesn’t have much of a social media presence and the articles I could find online were pretty sparse. From what I’ve gathered, he’s a fifty year old widow with two kids and a dog. He worked at a dealership for twenty years and he liked to golf.” Sam scrolls through the guys social media accounts and then scrolls through his kids.
“You almost caught us in the kitchen when I gave her some food and water. Sam kept her at his place for a couple days and he dropped her off this morning while you were still asleep.” Dean explains but Cas isn’t really listening.
“Well now I feel like a jerk for thinking all those horrible thoughts about the woman.” Gabe gives him a sheepish look. “So is everything cleared up now? Are you two back on track? Maybe you’re gonna let your big brother finally meet this mystery girlfriend?” He nudges Cas and raises his eyebrows suggestively. Cas stifules the urge to chuckle.
“Do you think they even noticed us leaving?” She asks him through clenched teeth and before he can answer the other three men burst through the garage door.
“Yeah I’ll be ok. I’ve got some cereal and poptarts and the dining hall will be open in the morning for breakfast. I’ll have to hike through the snow to get there but it’s not that far.”
“Elvis?” Sam nods “Blue Christmas, blue dead guy, could be a coincidence but we should check out that record player later tonight.”
“This is a weird one.” The coroner says as he pulls back the sheet. The body is still in a seated position, laying on its side.
“Nah, I got it.” Dean rebuffs him. “Close the trunk for me, would ya?” Cas rolls his eyes but doesn’t try to argue. He just slams the trunk and stalks toward the house, doing his best not to limp. Dean follows behind like the faithful pack mule he is, a shit eating grin on his face.
“Hi mom.” Dean smiles and gives his mom a quick side hug. “This is Cas.” He gestures to the man behind him.
“If I knew you felt that way I wouldn’t have come. Come on Cas let’s go.” Dean stalks toward the stairs and Cas hesitates looking back and forth between the brothers.
“I got the race track too so we can play car races.” Jack announces and then hands out tiny toy cars to Sam and Eileen. He pulls his new car out of his pocket to show them and they ooh and aah. The little boy beams at the praise and then tells them how to make a race track so they can race their cars.
“Ok Jack, just pack the snow into balls like this. Try to make as many as you can. I'm gonna build us a barricade.” Sam demonstrates how to make a snowball while Jack watches with rapt attention. He follows Sam’s example and in the time it takes Sam to make a wall of snow Jack has made a couple hundred snowballs. Sam gives him an impressed nod of approval and then crouches down behind the snow barricade and pulls out his phone.
“Sam, I think we’re in the wrong house.” Dean looks up from the present’s he’s examining and makes eye contact with a wide eyed little girl standing in the doorway behind Sam. “Shit”
“Fair point, but Dean, it’s their first christmas. They have to meet Santa.” They walk into the living room and settle the babies on the floor with some toys then Dean pulls out a laundry basket and starts folding.
“I’ve got nothing” he looks over at his brother hoping he might have found something but Dean just groans and echoes his words.
“Ok, um, there was a knock at my door and when I opened it I saw Nancy just… standing there holding something in her hand. It was red and dripping blood and it kept moving. I didn’t realise what it was until it was in my hand. And I could have swore it was still beating.” He shudders a little. “I mean, how is that even possible? How was she even standing there with that gaping hole in her chest?” The man asks, clearly in shock.
“Patience has a project due tomorrow, Clair is on a date, I even tried Gabriel but he was out at some bar and he already sounded pretty drunk.” Cas grumbles into the comforter. Dean looks at the time with a sigh.
Bobby wandered up and down the isles of the superstore trying to find something Sam and Dean would like. He didn’t know anything about children or what they liked to play with. Granted John’s children were more like mini adults, especially Dean. They’d probably be excited to get ammo or a new pocket knife. The thought set off a lightbulb in his head. Dean was nine years old and in this one regard he was like any other nine year old who would really be excited about a new knife.
“Oh sorry cher, didn’t mean to sneak up on ya. Is that that famous raspberry pie Dean waxes poetic about?” Benny asks. Before Charlie can answer or even feel a pang of disappointment at her plan being ruined by Benny of all people, she hears Ash steal what was supposed to be her line.
“Santa!” She shrieks and points at a man in a Santa costume sitting in a large comfortable looking chair, surrounded by children. He waves the children closer and motions for them all to sit down. The winchester’s make their way over to the crowd to see what’s happening. When they get closer they see a large plush rug in front of Santa’s chair. Mary drags Sam closer and they can hear Santa telling all the children they can sit on the rug while he reads them a story. Then he tells the parents that they’re welcome to sit or stand in the back but the close spots are just for children. Mary looks at her father with pleading eyes.
“Sam?” Jack holds up the record and inspects it again “This won’t fit in our DVD player.” The man behind them really loses it then. He’s laughing so hard tears are leaking out of the corners of his eyes.
“Not that kind!” Dean hurrys to assure him. “Well, not all of them are… ok, nope, not gonna finish that sentence.”
Inside the box Dean finds a handful of ticket stubs, a pen, a red and white striped tie that he recognizes as his own, scraps of paper with messy handwritten notes, and a leather bracelet with a metal charm that says “always with you.”
“You made it?” Dean beams at him. It’s the same look he gave Cas the first time he made him a pie over a year ago.
Dean follows Cas to Gabe’s apartment and after they make sure he’s safely passed out on his couch they go back to Cas’ place.
“A dinner party? What, are we some middle aged white ladies? You wanna throw a dinner party?” Dean stares at his brother like he’s lost his mind.
“What time do you think you’ll be here?” Mary’s voice chimes from the phone on Dean’s bed. After almost an hour of listening to her prattle on about their holiday plans, who was supposed to be there and what time they were going to be there, what they were having for dinner, when dinner would start, etc. Dean had rolled his eyes and turned on the speakerphone, then he threw it on his bed while he packed his duffle. He loved his mother but he really didn’t care about anything she was talking about so he’d been tuning her out for a good twenty minutes and hadn’t realized she’d asked him a question.
“Ok, I see your point. Do you have any suggestions for what I should get him?” He tries to look as repented as possible and maybe a little pathetic so she’ll take pity on him.
The dinner guest arrived shortly after six thirty and Dean was pleasantly surprised to see a few familiar faces mixed in with the strangers. His buddy Garth was there with a pretty blond that Dean did not know but he found out that they’d only met one other time a few months back so even if he had his memories he might not remember her. She handed him a plate full of brownies and smiled sweetly at him. His best friend Benny came barging in with home made chili and his uncle Bobby and aunt Ellen were also there with their daughter Jo and her boyfriend Bryan. Dean didn’t know him but he seemed pretty nice. Their parents couldn’t make it, they were on a cruise somewhere in the Caribbean but they’d skyped a few times and offered to fly straight home after hearing of the accident. Dean assured them he would be fine and they shouldn’t cut their vacation sort. Dean was surprised, however, to see the gorgeous guy from his econ class on the other side of his door holding a pie.
