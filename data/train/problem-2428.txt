“Morning,” rasps John. “What time is it?”
Tiltman looks as if he has slept at his desk. His suit is creased and his face tired, and he’s wearing the same shirt as the day before. John exchanges an amused glance with Sherlock when he spots the Peter Rabbit wallpaper of the codebreaker’s office. Tiltman appears to be in a hurry. He is standing at his desk when they enter, his suit jacket already buttoned, but he smiles when he hands Sherlock an envelope.
“Yes, although it seems to have acquired much of its notoriety in fairly recent times. Anyway, I’m rather convinced our three grave-robbers here knew where to look, and what to look for. They’re not doing this for the first time, judging from their equipment and the way they’ve been going about the venture, particularly their attempts at keeping it secret.”
“Yes.” In a low voice, Sherlock gives her a brief account of the events at Knockholt the previous day, and earlier at Ilchester Place, and what they have learned since. John adds bits and pieces when he arrives with Molly’s drink. She looks shocked but also angry when they are done.
John shrugs. “Perhaps. Hopefully not, though. Hope it’s going to carry on like this.”
Tiltman nods thoughtfully. “I’ll see what I can do, Holmes. Alastair must realise that this could be very important because it’s potentially damaging to everything we’ve built up here over the past years and even before, when we were still based in London. If it’s a matter of espionage, and it bloody well sounds like it is … well, we can’t just let it rest, can we? Especially with the Prime Minister about to pay us a visit. We need those messages, and we need to know who took them from the archive. Unlike you chaps working on Enigma and doing rather well there from what one hears, we’re still a long way behind on Tunny, and Winston won’t be happy to hear that we can’t seem to break into the Lorenz messages and eavesdrop on German High Command.”
“John, could we perhaps discuss this some other time. I can assure you, whatever Billy provided was only marginally illegal, and not dangerous if treated with care.”
out between them as long as their lead remains relatively small, knowing that they’ll catch most of them again on the descent.
“Lord Moran,” Moran interrupts him haughtily.
“Oh, come on, you don’t have to pretend around John and me. Your ‘pal’ Jim here knows all about your history of doping. One doesn’t even need a test, or, indeed, my skill at deduction to see the signs.”
Lang nods thoughtfully. “Was he the owner of the car?”
Sherlock sits up in alarm, breathing quickly. John is right. They’ve clearly not proceeded to the actual sex yet. Swallowing hard, Sherlock reaches out to touch John’s chest. John takes his hand, squeezes it.
“Thanks, Greg, we’ll do our best.”
“Don’t forget your gun,” said Sherlock while rifling through the stack of papers on the desk, most likely to search for the charger of his mobile, looking up briefly and giving John a wide grin, his eyes shining with the thrill of a new case.
“Tell me about it,” sighs Hopkins. “Heard you helped our yellow boy back into the peloton, though.”
John rakes a hand through his hair and shrugs. “Yeah, kind of. It wasn’t the main issue. It was fairly easy to hide what was going on. Between us, you know. We were sharing a room anyway and there weren’t any public displays of affection. James wasn’t like that, as I mentioned. At first, I thought it was fine. But eventually ... I began to loathe it. I began to hate the secrecy, hated that I couldn’t just touch him when I felt like it to show him how much I cared about him. I didn’t want the whole world to know, but I wouldn’t have minded had the rest of the team known. They wouldn’t have judged us. On the contrary, many would have been delighted. But James was totally opposed to even dropping hints. I told him they’d find out eventually. People like Irene ... she has a sixth sense for relationship stuff. I’m sure she knew. And ... it would have been kinda nice, I thought, to ... you know ... have somebody show, really show, they’re committed to you. That it’s not just a physical thing – although there wasn’t a lot of that, either. Sex, I mean. Intimacy even less. And I think ... in a way, that’s what rankled with me most of all. James never said so outright – as maybe he should have – it was always clear to me that I would be playing second fiddle to his cycling career, that winning the Tour was ultimately more important to him than me or anybody else. And I didn’t want that, not with him. I wanted more. I wanted that committed relationship. Because it wasn’t just about sex with him. Sex didn’t even play such a big part. Cycling did, our shared interests. The team did. Our friendship. I thought we had so much in common. I liked him as a person, too, when he wasn’t totally obsessed with cycling. Turned out I was mistaken. His priorities were different from mine, but neither of us was able to really communicate our needs and expectations to the other. We didn’t even try. I’d never been able to talk with him the way I do with you. Honestly. Deeply. I don’t want to lay all the blame at his door. I mean, I should have been upfront with my expectations, what I wanted. Problem was ... for a long time I didn’t really know what I wanted. My association with James only made clear what I didn’t want. So ... yeah. We had a falling out the night before the accident. A bad one. Neither of us slept well that night. I spent most of it out on the balcony while James ... to be honest, I don’t even know where he went. He sneaked in late that night when I was already asleep. We were both mulling over what had been said. And he oversteered and crashed, and even though he just texted me he doesn’t blame me, I can’t help feeling culpable. You know, perhaps you’re right about relationships. Perhaps they really are to be avoided. They certainly don’t mix well with cycling, at least not in my experience.”
When both partners are in dangerous lines of work...
“Always need you,” he mumbled. Good God, his voice sounded weak. “Hurts….” It did. His ribs hurt. His head hurt. It hurt that he had worried John. Again.
Mycroft, hearing the basic plan, was admittedly helpful except for the turkey argument. He arranged (or had Anthea arrange, which was more likely) for the traditional main courses to be delivered to Molly and Greg from Fortnum’s since they would miss the turkey at Baker Street. He arranged for a pumpkin pie and a black forest gateau to be delivered for Mrs. Hudson and Gladys from the same establishment since they would miss desert. Anthea thoughtfully acquired several ounces of prime Indica for Mycroft to take down to the ladies as an after-dinner soother.
It was now close to midnight, and he sat in his study with a snifter of brandy and papers and photographs spread around him. Julie’s note at the top of the stack had just said, “Twenty to start. Let me know if you want to look at more. J.”
“Why would she write her daughter’s name? She wrote her daughter’s name in the floor with her fingernails when she was about to die, John. Why? Lestrade you need to bring her in. I need to question her.”
“She’s the victim’s daughter. Jennifer Wilson’s only daughter.”
that?” Lestrade loped up. “Damn, Mycroft, it looked like something from that movie.”
He straightened, rolled his shoulders to try to work out the kinks from sleeping in the hard hospital chair. Why were they always so fucking uncomfortable?
“Who said something as stupid as that?” That was as close as Sherlock was ever going to get to saying she was right. She tried not to smile, and she kept her eyes on the road. She didn’t want to embarrass him more than she had already.
Something must have shown in his face. “I’m coming,” said John.
Everything went very quiet for a moment. Except that Molly was sobbing. But that was Molly.
, Harry.”
The vicar made tea. Perhaps, Sherlock thought, he wasn’t alone. Perhaps John would understand if he had to wait a bit longer. He looked at the pack of cigarettes. Two left. He squeezed Molly’s hand, then dropped it. He reached for the pack, took one out. He held the pack toward the vicar.
“Just don’t assume this person can’t like you, that you can’t like them. You never know. Just don’t get your back up and offend them from the get-go. You have to take it easy on us lesser mortals.”
“It’s because Sherlock is far more emotional, even sentimental than he lets on,” said Mrs. Hudson wisely. “He is so very sensitive, that boy. I wish I could say he was sensible also. Maybe that’ll come with age. But back when I first met him in Florida, he struck me as someone who hadn’t found his place in the world yet. He was so thin and pale. Delicate, that’s the right word. But very smart and quick and tougher than he looked. More ruthless, too. I often thought of that strange young man after my husband had been convicted and I moved back to England. And then one day he showed up at my door. It’s good that he has you now to remind him to eat and sleep. And for you he’s been good, too, hasn’t he? Look at you dashing about now, looking all fit and healthy. That’s a far cry – if I may say so – from the pale and broken man that limped up the stairs when you first came to look at the flat.”
“Just a bloody minute…,” Anderson said.
“Can’t it wait? I’m knackered.”
The furrow smoothed out. “Right, then. Don’t answer your phone unless it’s from your sister. Mycroft programmed her number in. If all goes well, I’ll bring you back a late dinner from Angelo’s. I looked at the tray they brought the man across the hall. Absolutely disgusting. If things don’t go well, Mycroft or Molly will be here later.”
“Me, too. We’ll be monsters together. You and me against the world. But no burning the world to cinders.”
“Was it bad news?” The Colonel motioned him into the chair across his desk.
“I see Mycroft left you his super-secret number. He must have liked you. Did he offer you money to spy on me?”
“I don’t have to,” John replied. Sherlock blinked, then his eyes flicked to John’s shoulder. Something unreadable crossed his face for the briefest of moments, then he bounced up from the chair and starting addressing the room at large.
“Gwen and me. It’s the object of the sentence, therefore it’s incorrect to use nominative case.”
Anderson smiles wryly. “True. Rest day in Tignes, though, in two and a half days’ time.”
Sherlock watches him, a slow smile growing on his face. “Yes, it has been rather enjoyable, hasn’t it? You even endured riding an E-bike. Who’d have thought?”
Sherlock glances at his watch. “Our appointment is for eleven, so if you really want to swim, there’s plenty of time.”
“Strange you didn’t delete that,” mused John.
“Then shut up. Or, if you really need to know, why don’t you deduce it?”
Sherlock can be infuriating in his bluntness, lack of politeness and blatant and often deliberate disregard of social rules. Yet his straightforwardness and candidness are refreshing. He digs and digs until he gets to the crux of the matter, unlike James who’d always stall and avoid serious conversations while trying to keep up appearances. Sherlock is honest, often brutally so. He’s ... genuine. At least with John, when they are away from the prying eyes of the public and Sherlock sheds his armour of impeccable superiority and lowers his emotional defences. Over the course of one week, Sherlock has opened up, has allowed himself to be seen at his most human – at least by John. He’s flawed, but aware of his limitations. He’s kind when he allows himself to be. He’s incredibly generous, even selfless on occasion. He’s brilliant and clever and weird and wonderful.
Things were surprisingly easy with Janine. But with John ... it’s not like it used to be, their tight friendship and easy rapport. John is so different now, as if a part of him has stayed behind in the house in Croydon he shared with Mary. And Sherlock, try as he might, can’t seem to find and revive the old John. He’s even attempted to provoke arguments, to shake John out of the grey stupor he seems to be caught in. A month ago, Sherlock laid waste to the kitchen with an experiment. He then proceeded to destroy John’s phone by placing it precariously on the mantelpiece from which it promptly fell onto the floor, shattering the screen. But the result was not the passionate reaction he had hoped for, but merely a sad, defeated shrug and a sigh from John. In the end, Sherlock cleaned up the mess in the kitchen himself and bought a new phone to try and make amends. John didn’t really react to this, either. Often, it feels like only half of him is sharing Sherlock’s quarters now. A shell, or a shadow, the sad ghost of the man he once was. Sherlock hates it, and hates his own inability to change it even more.
“Which method? The ‘I look at the ketchup stain on your cuff and deduce your life story’ or the ‘I creep into your room and secretly go through all your personal stuff and thus deduce your life story’ method?"
Opening the envelope, Sherlock reaches inside. He first withdraws a small stack of photographs and the postcard Molly mentioned. The card is indeed from Cologne, the postal stamp as she described. And the writing is Sütterlin, the hand, thankfully, orderly enough for Sherlock to read. The card was written with a fountain pen. In places, the ink is slightly smudged as if water or some other liquid dropped on it. Sherlock lifts it to its nose. It smells faintly of cigarette smoke and paper. He thinks, however, that he detects a whiff of beer, too. He deduces that it may have been written in a
Lestrade smirked. “Well, actually, the forensics lot …”
“I hope Molly really is going to argue for some recognition to be given to her posthumously?”
today, too. Don’t let it distract you.”
He knows that these dreams are going to persist for a while now, as they tend to after a reset. The abandoned timeline is going to haunt his nights until it fades to a memory. As he draws himself a glass of water from the tap in the small kitchenette – his tea-making utensils are already at Baker Street – he thinks about what he’s lost. He misses Rosie. He misses the recently regained domesticity with John. He misses his old life despite the hardship he suffered in the name of an unrequited, possibly hopeless love. Is he doomed to live through all of it again? Or will he end up sharing quarters and his life with John without the heartbreak and pain and torture of the first attempt? He wishes he knew.
Unconsciously, Sherlock runs a hand through the dark mop on his head. “What about my hair says public school?” he asks with genuine interest. His housemaster at Harrow often penalised him for not keeping his wayward curls neatly parted and pomaded down.
“Yes,” he rasps.
Lestrade looked her up and down and sighed, withdrawing a notepad and pencil from the inner pocket of his coat. “Mrs. Northam, where were you between Friday evening and Saturday morning?” he enquired gravely.
Sherlock’s head jerked up at this, his expression thoughtful and tense. “The hackers were waiting for someone higher up to decide whether to further interrogate or kill me. That person was supposed to arrive the day I escaped. I must have missed him or her by sheer luck.”
“I didn’t forget. I calculated that my calorific intake would suffice. It did, barely.”
Sherlock smiles, warmth spreading through his body at the sight of the familiar number and the thought of exchanging texts with John. Strangely, he never enquired about how Sherlock got his number before.
From the corner of his eye, he catches Sherlock’s expression as the man moves next to him to study what’s on offer for breakfast. It’s the usual: cereal, fruit, several kinds of bread and pastries, smoothies, Nutella and other high-calorie spreads, and the ubiquitous pasta John knows he’s going to loathe by the end of the Tour without really seeing what’s in front of him. But Sherlock doesn’t really take it in. His eyes flick over the buffet without focus. Sherlock looks strangely ... hurt. It’s undeniably there in the way his lips are pressed together, how he holds himself. However, as soon as he become aware of John watching him, his usual mask of indifference and haughty disdain is down again.
Sherlock extricated himself from the embrace and gazed at John with a grave, even stern expression. “No, John, I’m a realist, and I’m trying to learn from past mistakes. I thought I had to give you up once before in order to protect you and it didn’t work. Well, the protection did, obviously, but not the giving up. And I hurt you in the process, perhaps even more than a sniper’s bullet would have done. I’m not doing that again. Moreover you are the first and likely only person who not only never threatened not to leave, but who actually seems to be enjoying my company and even my attempts at ... well, yes, all right, romantic entanglement. So I’d be a complete fool to let you go again, wouldn’t I?”
Oh, this is brilliant, brilliant. Of course. They’re
Sherlock doesn’t stick around after the team meeting. Immediately after, he vanishes. John suspects he absconds to the mechanics for some bike-whispering.
John understands Greg’s interest, as well as the reactions of the rest of their friends and acquaintances. In fact, their obvious concern about the two of them touches him. They been awkward yet supportive when news made the round that Mary and their baby had died. Both aren’t really dead, although they might as well be. Still, nobody seemed surprised when after a relatively short period of mourning, John returned to Baker Street. The news that he and Sherlock were an item now were met with general approval, even downright joy. The conversation with Greg with tongues loosened by just the right amount of alcohol confirmed it: all of them had watched Sherlock and he dance around each other for ages while rooting for them to finally get together. It’s taken them years, that’s true. Years of taking wrong turns and wrong steps. Sherlock’s major misstep was off Barts roof. John’s was to marry a former assassin and carrying her over the threshold of a small semi in Croydon. Sherlock stepping towards Magnussen and shooting him. John stepping aside when his daughter was swept from his arms and ‘disappeared’.
“Are you sorry you kissed me?” asks John quietly.
“What? You mean Baskerville?”
––––––––––
Sherlock feels John twitch angrily at his side, and he gives a minute shake of head to calm him. This is his business. He can handle Daniel now. He thinks.
“I would reckon nitrate to be a problem as well,” mused Sherlock.
Sherlock frowned, genuinely confused. “Why would you buy me chocolates?”
“Yes, John.”
John laughs brightly at this. “Yeah, I can imagine. Especially when one owns as much weird stuff as you do. How many printers are there in 221B?”
he reasons. The dog is still barking. The wind howls and screams in eery voices. Just when Sherlock steps closer to the window for a better view, there’s a loud crack. The fairy-lights go out, plunging the garden outside and the room into near darkness. Something heavy hits the window with a dull thump, making Sherlock jump back in shock. The dog falls silent.
Against his will, Sherlock has to smile. “Yes, well, the tea was rather obvious, I suppose. Got any milk, too?”
Somehow, John makes it into the shower. Before he closes the frosted divider, he catches a glimpse of his face in the mirror above the sink. It’s not a pleasant sight. He looks at least ten years older, resembling his father ever more closely – at least the way he remembers him. They haven’t really spoken for a long time, not after John decided to side with his sister and cut his homophobic begetter out of his life. The leg cramps again, more violently now. Cursing, John lowers himself to the floor of the cubicle. It’s large enough for him to stretch out his legs. Cursing again because he forgot to turn on the water and can’t quite reach now, he tries to massage his leg and pull his toes towards him to relieve the muscle. It doesn’t much help. The cramp moves from his calf into his foot. He cries out in pain. He realises he can’t really get up, not without potentially pulling down half the shower. He should call for help. But no, this would be the ultimate humiliation. John Watson, too weak to get onto his feet again in the shower. Eventually, somebody must come. Mike will look for him. Or Sherlock ...
Sherlock points ahead. The alley they’re in is a cul-de-sac, ending in a courtyard lined on three sides by tall buildings belonging to the hotel Team CAM is staying at. There are rubbish- and recycling bins to one side. A delivery vehicle is parked in front of an open door with people unloading crates of what looks like food. Light is spilling out of an open door which possibly leads to the kitchen. In a nearby doorway, a dark-clothed, hooded person is sitting smoking a cigarette, a couple of large bags at their feet. John can’t see whether it’s a man or a woman. The figure looks like one of the homeless. Another person is approaching it, also smoking. It’s a young black man dressed in a security guard’s uniform carrying a paper bag, which he hands to the other. They talk briefly before the guard snicks away his cigarette stub and heads back towards the open door. He halts when Sherlock whistles softly and looks in their direction.
John sighs, looking at her gravely. “I’ve had a hard time understanding and accepting this as well, particularly because I know what it’s like out there. I don’t condone how things are being done, but I understand the reasons now, I think.”
“Possibly,” answers Sherlock thoughtfully. An attempt at blackmail is very likely. If Moran’s valet was the potential buyer, did he act on his master’s orders, or was he working for his own gain? Does he have another master or mistress, perhaps? Sherlock wishes he knew more about the man and his motives. There are several possible reasons for wanting to possess potentially incriminating material of Moran’s lover. Did Moran intend to keep her at his side by threatening to release clips of her naked performance to the press? Did Irene attempt to gain their possession or have them destroyed to prevent that? Is somebody else interested in the footage? If yes, who and why? Sherlock feels he needs to talk to her again, confront her about the film. Something about the whole matter doesn’t sit right with him. The way she talked about her affairs ... she didn’t strike him as someone ashamed of her actions. She freely admitted to a lesbian relationship, one that involved true love, apparently. No, he decides, Irene Adler, who uses her wit and charm, her looks and her guile to get whatever she wants in this world; Irene Adler who doesn’t consider her dalliances with rich men shameful in any way, who disregards society’s conventions or plays with them, whatever is more convenient ... Irene Adler wouldn’t be ashamed of a film she made in the hopes of furthering her career, even if that meant she was dancing naked in it.
“Am I dead, Mycroft?” asks Sherlock in a small voice. He has begun to tremble slightly. He loathes not having the answer himself. But Mycroft is smart. He knows so many things Sherlock doesn’t.
“I never asked for that kind of protection or sacrifice, you know that,” said John tersely, not relishing the reminder of their time apart.
“Oh, you mean with unpaved roads and riders having to carry their own spare tubes and tyres slung round their bodies, with stages of 400 kilometres and more, and riders fearing to be attacked and eaten by wild bears in the Pyrenees?”
“Victor,” he replies evenly. “You are to be congratulated, it would appear.”
muses John,
“Well, there’s ... this.” The last word was accompanied by a swift pinch at Sherlock’s side that elicited a gasp, some squirming, and a grin.
The Captain’s sensible suggestion that they consider a long-term arrangement as flat-mates appealed to him. Mrs. Hudson had given him an unusually low rent for central London, but his practice was just getting off the ground. Having someone share the rent would make things easier financially. Also, having a doctor around at times might be useful for the work. He could answer questions about rigor and blood loss and so on.
“These words exactly: ‘What happened at Lauriston Gardens? I must have blacked out.’”
He stood up, put his hand on the gravestone again. “It made me realize that what I really wanted was you, John. That’s when I knew. And I thought I would never have you. Not in that way. There’s more to the story, but please remember that I never loved her. We were too much alike, Irene and I.” He stuck both hand into his coat pockets and looked at the grey sky.
Sherlock turned away, an obscure pain in his chest. Ridiculous, he thought. It was just a painting. It’s your wedding day. Be happy.
Chapter 1
“Read out the address when I get to the site.” His fingers flew over the Ipad screen. “Now.”
me. How could a random stranger possibly….” Sherlock couldn’t finish the humiliating sentence. No-one could stand him. Well, Mrs. Hudson seemed to like him, but then she seemed to like everybody. Everyone at Eton and Cambridge had hated him. He hadn’t made a single friend. Well, maybe Lestrade was a sort of friend in a way, but only on cases. Besides, the DI was already partnered. Unhappily, but there it was.  Being partnered with a stranger would be horrible. “I just want my work and to be left
Well, damn again, she thought. She sniffed.
“Sod it… hang on a minute…. OK.”
“That’s a name no-one says. I’m not gonna say it either. It’d be as much as my life’s worth. It’s not worth much, I’ll admit, but I’d rather go natural-like. I will tell you this much. My sponsor has a taste for unnatural death, that’s for sure. But enough chat. Time to choose.”
John took the last sip of whisky. Well, he couldn't say that he hadn't drawn an interesting partner. Married to his work? That didn’t actually clear up the question about his sexuality, but it did seem to make it clear that he didn’t think it was worth discussing. That implied John was free to forget about it and have whatever relationships he wished, so it was ideal from his point of view. Maybe the Lucky Dip had been lucky after all. At some point, it sounded like they would actually end up living together. If they could figure out a way for John to remain on active duty during during part of the year, he liked the idea of living in London for the other part. He found the idea of being Sherlock’s in-house, casual consultant on forensics intriguing. He read over the bluey again. Experiments? What kind of experiments exactly?
~~~~~
Sherlock held the IPad  out to Sally, showing the map location. Baker Street. The tiny red dot pulsed accusingly. It looked to be almost exactly at 221.
“Welcome to the family, Dr. Watson,” he said. “And good luck.” He turned off the desk lamp and made his way to bed.
“I’m sure you can deduce it, Sherlock. Off you go. Didn’t know you smoked. Can I have one?”
~~~~~
Sherlock put the mugs down on the table none too gently and shoved the sugar toward John. He sat down and fixed John with a steady gaze.
“I know that much. Laura and I used to follow John’s blog. Exciting stuff.”
“Well, that IPad says it was,” Lestrade said.
“Up to? You mean drugs? You just said he was clean.”
“We were sitting on the back veranda of the guest house, looking out over the water. She must have ordered the whiskey and Dunhills while I was showering. We both almost died at the camp. Adrenaline. Sex and death. Always connected. I don’t know why both Irene and my brother assumed I was a virgin. Mycroft’s surveillance wasn’t as thorough back in the days when I was fucking and using. Anyway.”
John did.
“You have got to be shitting me. I thought you liked them because they were real, because they were honest.”
“Sit,” he said.
“That surprises you, John? I never really told you the truth about Mycroft, that I once loved him. It hurt too much. He pushed me away first, but he was a teenager. A very strange young man trying to fit into an even stranger world. By the time I understood, there was too much water under that particular bridge. What? Yes, you’re right, not water. Too many drugs, too many insults, too much pride, too much hurt.”
“That’s why you made me watch the movie.”
“Had to check on your landlady first. That put us behind. Then once we got to the park, we thought we had the cab for a bit. Turned out to be someone going to the indoor tennis courts. When we found the right cab, we picked the wrong building. But we got there.”
He let his coat drop in an untidy heap on the sofa and set the takeaway on the kitchen table where his computer sat open. He sat down, opened the waxed paper container holding his dinner and speared a shrimp with the plastic fork. He opened his email. And there it was. He suddenly wasn’t hungry any more. He put the shrimp back in the container. How bad would this be?
Not simple at all. Mrs. Hudson was safe. The cabbie had turned away from him, staring straight ahead. When he was small, Mycroft often told him that curiosity killed the cat. He itched with curiosity. It wasn’t enough to stop the killer. He had to know how. He had to know why. He felt the crystalline flow of his brain, the blessed surge of adrenaline. He felt light and focused, above everything. He loved serial killers, even more than he loved cocaine. The neuro-chemical effects were quite similar, although this might be even more dangerous.
Greg had dug out candles. Molly was sitting close to Sherlock with her hand in his. It was, he admitted, somewhat comforting. With his unencumbered hand he poked at a piece of baozi. Steamed bun. His favorite.
“Stay inside, damn you. You’re not as young as you used to be. Don’t let Mrs. Hudson come up here, even if she has biscuits. Not even the lemon ones. You could have been exposed while you were flitting about London on that last case. It hasn’t been fourteen days yet. There is plenty of food in the fridge. Which you should eat some of, by the way. There are Jaffa cakes in the cabinet. Plenty of tea, which you should drink. Stay hydrated.”
John made toast and drank his coffee while Sherlock peeled and cored and chopped Anjou pears. Then an onion. Then celery. He stalled for as long as he could, but fair was fair.
“Anyone who can stand Sherlock is a friend of ours,” Greg said. “You sit. I’ll dish up.”
Mycroft beamed. Which was a somewhat frightening sight.
Will began to cry. Loudly.
She had also seeing more drug deaths on her tables in the last few days. She thought of Sherlock alone in his flat. Too many drug deaths from lonely people who were looking for ways to cope. She would check on Sherlock after one more autopsy. She tried to FaceTime with him once a day, ostensibly to check up on his research but mostly just to check up on him generally.
Whoever painted that, he thought… Whoever painted that might understand what his mind was like. Might understand the hunger, the thing clawing him from the inside, the thing that sometimes felt monstrous and sometimes felt like an angel struggling to spread its wings. It was his own face, his true face, the face of his despair, his addiction, his energy, his refusal to settle for anything life had yet shown him. Slowly, he slid down the wall, still looking at the face.
Sherlock looked down at his hands. One was massaging his knee. Touch of arthritis there. The other held the half-smoked cigarette.  He couldn’t look at John’s grave. He wished with all his heart that John had been the first.
A moment later  he heard her door open.
“Don’t you see? A few hours after his last victim, he receives a text that can only be from her.” The phone stopped ringing. “We’ve panicked him. Now he’ll make a mistake.”
Sir Julian stood, turned to an elegant Georgian sideboard behind his desk, and poured whiskey into two heavy cut-crystal tumblers. He handed one across the desk to Mycroft, sat down, and took a sip.
“You’re wrong,” Hope said. “You’re wrong 'cause I give everyone a fair chance to outsmart me.  And I take the same chance as they do. There’s a good bottle and a bad bottle. You take the pill from the good bottle, you live; take the pill from the bad bottle, you die. I play fair. It’s your choice. You pick whichever you like. I’ll take the other one. Come on. I want your best game.”
Suddenly John felt a sob rising in his throat. No. No, he wouldn’t give in. He covered his mouth with a shaking hand.
“Sorry. M’sorry.”
“Who is Rachel?” John asked.
“Jennifer Wilson is cleverer than all of you,” Sherlock said, “and she’s dead. Do you see? She didn’t
Each cigarette was a little burnt offering, a memory, a bit of his past. Smoke rising toward the heavens. Cense the altar of my soul with acrid fumes, and I shall be clean.
Suddenly he checked one box.
Then there was more babbling. Introductions. More tea. The boy hadn’t eaten on the road, so the vicar warmed up more food. Sherlock felt strangely distanced and lightheaded through all this. How?
~~~~~
“Ah,” said Mycroft, “You’re not hurt?”
“I love you, John.”
“You know every street in London, you do. The cabbies talk about it, say you’ve got the Knowledge. You know
“So it’s ... me?” asks Molly, meeting his eyes steadily.
“No. Why lie to her? But I said that he was going where he can chase after and destroy things to his heart’s content, and she seemed to approve of it.”
Sherlock is so deep in thought about the impending journey that he almost cycles past the venue of tonight’s ‘Jazz & Dance Extravaganza’, despite the school being almost impossible to miss with the herd of bicycles parked in front of the functional looking brick building. There are some cars as well, and motorcycles. Sherlock surveys the cars when he parks his bicycle next to John’s, but the mysterious Bentley is not among them.
Sherlock smiles. “Yes. I’ll have to fetch my spreadsheet first, though.”
Sherlock shrugs, ducking his head. “Clearly superior to Fred from the chippy. And most others.”
“Just an exchange of favours. Do we need any tools?”
“Has anything like this ever occurred before?” enquires Sherlock. “Threats, sabotage?”
For a while, neither spoke. John wondered whether he was supposed to continue reading, but Sherlock made no indication. At length, however, he stirred slightly. “They never made up,” he said quietly.
“It’s apple-juice,” explains John, noticing his expression. “Because of your concussion I won’t have you drink any alcohol tonight.”
“Oh God, Sherlock, I’m sorry.” There is so much blood – or perhaps it just seems like that to John.
“Careful, there,” he cautions.
“Yes. In the past, I failed to protect this woman, though. I – we– only managed to apprehend her killer. Sort of. I intend to do better this time.”
Despite the heat – strong enough to partly melt or at least severely soften the asphalt in places – John feels somewhat recovered. His various injuries are healing. His legs don’t feel like lead anymore, he can breathe more freely, and his stomach has settled. Therefore, he is eager to return his teammates’ kindness of the previous stage and work for them. He helps prepare Stephen Bainbridge’s intermediate sprint. He briefly considers joining the breakaway as it forms but decides against it, preferring to stay with Sherlock and look after him by fetching water and shielding him from the wind. Because Team Speedy’s has three riders in the breakaway, they refrain from upping the pace in the peloton, content to roll along. John makes it across the first climb in the main part of the peloton. During the ascent to the Côte de Corlier, the escapees managed to increase their lead to over fifteen minutes, making the best-placed of them, Kit, the wearer of the virtual yellow jersey.
a favour by providing them with food Sherlock will eat even when he’s completely distracted by a case and oblivious to the world and his body’s needs. But anything catering to his sweet tooth can be placed where he is likely to find it, along with a cup of tea, and it’s going to be eaten eventually.
Lestrade smiled warmly. “What, sociopathic geniuses with an interest in murder not your type?” he teased.
“Okay. I’ll text you about the bruises.”
“Of course not. The only time I was desperate enough to even consider exchanging sexual favours in exchange for anything – in this case information – was during my time abroad. And I told you how well that went.”
Sherlock laughs softly at John’s boldness. “All right. To be honest, I haven’t really thought about it.”
“But whoever is behind it would have to be extremely ruthless and even better organised to do so much damage without getting caught,” muses John.
Sherlock vanishing without a word doesn’t help, though. It feels like stepping backwards, chipping at the trust between them that has rebuilt slowly in recent months. John knows he’s being petty and unfair, but Sherlock’s silence feels like a betrayal. John has barely slept, despite temperatures being comfortable again after yesterday’s thunderstorm that finally broke a nasty spell of muggy heat. Now, John is lying in Sherlock’s bed staring at the still somewhat unfamiliar ceiling in the growing light. It’s after five, and still no word from the twat. The last message John received was during the early afternoon while he was still at work. Sherlock informed him he was off to the London Transport Museum to talk to people concerning the disappearance of one of their guides, a case they had been working on for the past forty hours.
Sherlock scoffed. “Not well, as my time abroad showed. But the longer we stay together and the closer we get, the more difficult being without you is going to become. The more I let you in, the worse I’ll be off once it’s over. And it
Sherlock regards him kindly, smiling. “Which shows again that you’re an idiot.”
“Those two really are inseparable, aren’t they?” muses Dimmock.
At Sherlock’s side, John bristles with indignation.
He did the one wise thing and let the topic drop.
“He’s still arrogant and socially awkward,” mused John. “If he could hear us he’d sneer and give us a good piece of his mind. He hates all this ‘sentimental blab’.”
, thinks Sherlock, suppressing an eye-roll.
“‘In a while’ is another way of putting it. I’ve last ridden a horse some twenty-five years ago,” said John. “How long has it been for you, Sherlock?”
John stares after him, feeling as though his heart has been ripped out of his chest.
“No. He was strangled with a thin cord that also broke his neck. And he was stabbed, too.”
“Well, you’re to blame I’m all sticky now.”
The guilt doesn’t abate when Sherlock swirls around the crime scene, making deductions, astonishing John and Lestrade and annoying the rest of the team before dashing off to look for the pink case and then taking a cab back to Baker Street to await John’s return from his chat with Mycroft. Sherlock is so lost in his head, playing through various possible futures resulting from him saving Jennifer Wilson like games of chess, that he almost forgets to text John to come to their flat.
“You’re one of the men from London who came to the Farm today, aren’t you? Lizzy Williams from the archive told me all about you two. She seemed quite taken with your companion, the doctor.”
“And Moriarty?”
“Are you close, you and your brother?”
“She didn’t see her face,” muses Sherlock absently, his mind whirring.
Mr. Holmes sighed again, looking suddenly years older. “Tests are still being run to determine how dangerous and potentially life threatening it is, and to gauge the risks and benefits of surgery, but a recent MRI scan revealed an aneurysm in my brain that could burst any time. You are a doctor, right? You know what that means.”
“Yes. And I don’t regret it. Thanks for telling me all this, Sherlock.”
John gazes up the stairs in mild alarm. While Sherlock has mastered cooking with astonishing ease, Sherlock and baking is a whole different matter. The last time he tried to bake bread because they’d run out and neither wanted to risk going to the shops had resulted in a kitchen so full of smoke, they had to air it out for two days and a lump of coal – all because Sherlock had forgotten to set a timer for the oven and been distracted by an online case, causing the bread to burn.
“Oh yes, there are hunts. Particularly in the autumn you have to be careful where you tread in the forest and on the heathlands so as not to get your backside riddled with bullets. Next weekend there’s one, down at Hollesley. Not a real fox-hunt, mind. I’m glad they got rid of those, although some of the locals were protesting, even running a petition. Right, here we are. This lane straight ahead leads to my cottage. It’s just a couple of yards, behind those trees. But I reckon you’ll want to see the farm right away.”
“They chased you and knocked you out a little up the street, and then carried you back in. Why not hide you behind some of the crates or boxes on the ground floor? Or in one, even? There were plenty of spaces, I’m sure. Or if not there, there was also the basement level. I didn’t see a lot of it, but there seemed to be a couple of rooms. At least that’s how it was built originally, according to the plan you found. Anyway, like this, they had to carry you down the entire staircase. What a troupe of idiots.”
It’s only a short ride back to their hotel. Molly and two other mechanics are outside in a side street cleaning the bikes from today’s ride. John and Sherlock drop off theirs and quickly make their way to their room, hands brushing as they stand next to each other in the lift and rush down the corridor. The door of their room shuts with a bang behind them. John rounds on Sherlock, quickly checks whether he shows any objections to a bit of snogging. But Sherlock has already thrown away helmet and sunglasses and is reaching for him, and so John promptly slides a hand into his curls, pulls his head down and proceeds with kissing him soundly. At first, Sherlock seems a little stunned by the intensity. John tries to control his ardour and slow down, but in no time, Sherlock has caught on and is returning the kiss as passionately as John began.
“Well, perhaps that’s something to occupy yourself with should boredom strike again, seeing that your essay on tobacco ash has been such a smashing success.”
For a brief moment, Sherlock feels transported back thirty years ago and sees the doors of the wardrobe close in on him. The F-word. He is surprised how much it still smarts coming from Daniel’s mouth. He’s heard it many times, from a great number of people. He’s developed a thick skin over the years, so that now when people like Sally Donovan use it occasionally, he knows that she means it with a measure of humour, even respect. He
He might even meet a wild dog to defend him and keep him warm at night, and he could easily nick the occasional 99 or fish and chips from unsuspecting vendors or tourists. Yes, this sounds like a good plan.
Jan nods, but then makes a motion that encompasses the three of them. “You mean we could look after the sheep together, all three of us? Oh ... oh, that would be brilliant. Mind, I don’t know a lot about them. You’ll have to teach me, and perhaps I can find some books about them and read up a little. How long will you be here? All summer?”
Pleased that he has found it after all these years, Sherlock follows the path, walking briskly, with John following at a slight distance. The air is still warm, so that soon, Sherlock sheds his jacket and carries it over his arm. Glancing over his shoulder, he sees John’s dark form. He has rolled up his shirt-sleeves and opened the two topmost buttons of his shirt. What Sherlock can see of his face looks thoughtful, almost pensive. There will be more questions soon, Sherlock reckons.
Sherlock recalls that this is one of the ruses the general populace has been told, or indeed been encouraged to believe without being told explicitly, to veil the true purpose of Bletchley Park. Station X, the radio factory. Well, as long as people buy it.
“Are you alright?” The voice was a deep, velvet thing. The accent was Italian. “I’m…”
Sherlock frowned. “No. I thought I was close, but I must have miscalculated. I was sure he’d be in that cab, but it turned out to be a tourist newly-arrived from California. I still think he has her phone…”
The driver’s window slid down. “Taxi for Sherlock 'olmes.” Cockney accent. Ordinary face in profile. Tufts of grey hair showing under a flat cap.
“Yes, barely.  I measured. Coffee’s made,” Sherlock said, tilting his head toward the counter. “We are doing the turkey for two reasons. First, Mycroft lost the coin toss.”
I can’t help it. It comes out. The question.
“I had some of the stew Liz brought over yesterday. It was the lamb that you liked. I hope you’re happy that I’m eating.” Liz was the vicar’s wife. She mostly left him alone, for which he was grateful. She tried to treat him normally since John died, but her big, brown eyes were always too full of both intelligence and compassion. She saw too much. She was, however, an excellent cook. He hadn’t gone so far as to bring John out any of the stew.
“I think I’ll take a walk down to the cliffs. The afternoon’s getting on, John. Have you thought about my method? Any advice? Think on it, and I’ll be back.”
He didn’t immediately contradict her. Then the voice, low and soft. “I… considered it.”
“Smoking was the difficult one. Giving up sex again was easy. I could sublimate that to the work without much difficulty. Drugs were always tempting, but with you and the work I could get by without them, without sex. But I still needed nicotine. I tried to quit for a long time. I knew you didn’t like it, but I never quit for long. I used the patches in 221, but I smoked outdoors when I could. I smoked in the park while you were working. I smoked on the roof while you were out on dates with Sara or Jennifer or Mandy or Sandy or whomever.”
“There was a child.”
“Who is Angelo? You hared off before you could tell me. I assume from the fact that you’re here things went well.”
John smiled for Sherlock alone. He shrugged and kept his voice light. “Bit not good, yeah,” he said.
“Boring.” Sherlock didn’t look up from the microscope where he was doing God knows what.
He took another drag on the cigarette. This wasn’t going to get any easier.
“Doesn’t mean you don’t need one,” he said.
His dealer was, indeed, still operating out of the Black Hand off the Marylebone Road. Heroin was more expensive than it had been the year before. As he made his purchase and went back onto the cold street, he tried to shop the shivering that had started in anticipation of the drug, the danger. The promises betrayed.
“So, you know that you were an absolute, unmitigated tosser to go with him like that?” She carefully looked straight ahead at the traffic.
“Bit strained at the moment,” John replied, finally coming into the room. He approached Sherlock’s chair and loomed over it. “Well, how was the exclusive, private facility for the well-connected addicts on suicide watch then?”
“You asked what kind of story we were in. Do you want to know what I think?
Suddenly, John thought, the conversation had gone off the rails. “You’re already paying my rent. I’m grateful, by the way, but I can’t continue to accept it. And I won’t spy on Sherlock for you. Why would you even ask me that?”
“That’s not the point,” she said.
“Yeah, he did. Turned it down.” John fumbled for the controls and raised the head of the bed. “Oi! You’re getting crumbs in the bed.”
Sherlock looked up.
“John was more of a gentleman than I ever was. But I think he underestimated Emma. She’s an old countrywoman. Made of sterner stuff. He thought I’d use his gun, did he?”
. John came back early from the surgery before Wilkinson got to the third stanza or Sherlock certainly would have bled out. John grabbed a kitchen knife and slashed Wilkinson’s jugular in the melee that followed. He cut Sherlock and Mrs. H free with the same knife.
“He just turned onto the Outer Circle,” Sally said.
“I didn’t kill him,” Sherlock said.
“That’s the spirit,” he said. “Shall we? Are you clever enough to bet your life, or are you just as much of an idiot as the others?”
The scones were glorious. Liz had folded in tiny slivers of apple and candied ginger. They tasted like autumn and sympathy, with a hint of regret. Sherlock knew he was being fanciful.  Liz was a brilliant baker, though. If anyone could suggest sympathy via flour and regret with a hint of nutmeg, she could. He would miss her. He would miss Simon. Not enough to change his mind, however. He missed John so much more.
voice, but a voice. “Don’t try to move, Dr. Watson. I will call the nurses. You are in hospital in London. Your surgeries were successful.”
Sherlock looked up then. “No and no.”
“It is too soon to know the exact extent, but it could be extensive.” Bad then. John gritted his teeth and nodded.
“Where did you even get this?” Mycroft held the ovoid monstrosity in front of him as if the pigskin personally offended him. Perhaps it did. In Mycroft’s opinion, the only game for a gentleman was cricket, but if forced by circumstances to play footie, the ball should be round.
Sherlock unfolded himself from the back seat. “I’m going in. If he’s here, that means it’s me he wants.”
“Ta.” Sherlock put the tin between them on the bed. John reached for a biscuit and bit into it. Heaven.
clever… Jennifer Wilson was running a string of lovers. She was clever… She’s trying to tell us something. But what? Anderson, turn around, I have to think. I can’t think with you staring; you lower the whole IQ of the room.”
“He’s here,” Sherlock repeated. “It’s the only explanation. Mrs. Hudson could be in danger. Call for backup.”
Sherlock caught the ball neatly and eeled around John as if greased. He barreled toward the lamp-post standing in for the goal. Mycroft had a decision to make. Suit or honor. He chose honor and used a kick to bring Sherlock down.
“It’s John. I wanted to tell you myself. I owe him that. He’s been wounded.”
very angsty, may be triggering for some. has to do with a (possible) infant death. I swear there's light at the end of this tunnel, just so you know.
“Good one,” yelled John, his ‘team-mate,” clapping him on the back. John hared off toward the opposing ‘team’ (Sherlock and Lestrade). Mycroft jogged after him, thinking about his shoes. And his suit.
When he woke the next morning on the floor, he looked at the fresh needle track in his arm. He felt the craving rise in him. No. No. No. The work. It was more important. This was just a one-time thing.
“Quite good,” John said. Light came into his eyes for the first time that night.
Mycroft motioned him back into his luxurious leather chair and sank into the one across the desk.
“Because the Americans make pies on Thanksgiving. Because it will please Mrs. Hudson. Because one year ago today you shagged me senseless and told me you loved me. In that order. I’ll always be thankful for that.”
“Not hungry,” said Sherlock.
“Why do we need backup? There are four of us.”
“John. I need John. He's a doctor,” Sherlock muttered.
They had agreed. As soon as they finished with Moriarty, Sherlock would tell Mycroft. He would arrange new identity and safe haven for Irene. They had no interest in living together, and he would never try take the child away from her. Sherlock would visit his son discreetly until they were sure it was safe to be more open. His son. They had found out weeks later that it was a boy. When he was older, he could decide where to live. His son. Sherlock sighed.
Something very complicated happened in Sherlock’s chest at that. He would analyze it later.
Sod Mycroft. Sod everything. He wondered if his old dealer was doing business in the same bar.
“Please, God, let me live.” That was still fresh in John’s mind. The dull thud of mortars. The screams of the wounded. The smell of fuel and blood. The gurgling from the torn throat of the woman on the ground in front of him. Civilian casualties were the worst. He knew he was losing her, and she was clutching one of his arms. She knew it too. Then it felt as if someone had hit him with a cricket bat. No pain, just impact. Then the blood spurted up from the artery in his shoulder. Bit not good, indeed. Please God, even if I don’t really believe in you, maybe you’re there. Let me live.
Gio smiled. “Very much so. She’s one of the most alive people I’ve ever met. She said the same thing about you, you know.”
~~~~~
“I was being honest, John.” He looked up. “Kafka wrote a much more interesting story than the one about the bug. It’s called
“Don’t you think I should get some lunch, John? God knows, you were always rabbiting on and on about how I needed to eat. Hold that thought. I’ll be back.”
Hope slid the bottle closest to himself across the table until it sat in front of Sherlock.
He stiffened his spine and his resolve. He would go with his instinct. Sherlock was not straight. He set aside the ten women and turned to the men.
Sherlock makes one bad decision and a couple of good ones. Sally makes a discovery.
He looked at the picture of one particularly comely auburn-haired woman. Pianist, painter. A lovely, vulnerable mouth. He touched the picture’s mouth. No. Too vulnerable for Sherlock. It would be a waste. Why in heaven’s name hadn’t she specified sexual orientation in her pick? Or anything. Why take such a chance? There was a story there. He supposed there was a story in every photo and piece of paper on his desk.
“Yeah,” she said. He snatched it.
“Your loss would break my heart,” he said to the empty room.
“I did not waste my trust fund on drugs. You had it frozen.”
“Molls, sweetheart, are you sure you want to do this now?”
“Sorry, what?” Kelly was speaking, but he had lost the thread.
The young man got down on his knees.
She heard a disdainful sniff from Sherlock’s side of the car, but he didn’t contradict her.
“I brought you tea. PG Tips, just like you like it. You complained often enough that I never made the tea.”
“I have a younger brother, too, Mycroft. I suppose you took that into account in your calculations. Oh, don’t bother to look offended. You always thought three steps ahead of the best of us. So you want us to bollocks up the randomness of the partnering just a bit? A slight weighting to fortune's wheel? You know, chance seems to work just as well for most people.”
John gets up from his chair and comes to kneel in front of mine.
I often underestimate John.
Things seldom went according to plan for John Watson. That was the downside of being addicted to danger. Whenever things went to hell, as they often did in Afghanistan, he carefully reminded himself of that. He had chosen this, continued to choose it. He volunteered to head the trauma team airlifted to the crash site of an American Chinook helicopter. His Battalion was closest to the site, so they were able to get there before the Yank medics. He thought of nothing but triage and battlefield surgery for thirty bloody hours.
“As if it were yesterday,” Mycroft said, a rare smile lighting up his face. “My brother, Julie, is difficult. Brilliant, perhaps on the autism spectrum though never diagnosed, difficulties with relationships. Drug use.”
“In my defense, I didn’t quite realize I loved you then.” He drew back his hand. He drained the rest of the beer and put the empty bottle on top of the headstone beside the one that remained full.
Sherlock drained most of his tea in a quick gulp and dropped the smoldering end of the cigarette into the dregs. It hissed briefly. The cup was a lovely green and gold Staffordshire piece, one of an antique set Molly had given them as a wedding present. He lit another cigarette. Number six, he noted.
“Yep,” Kelly said. “I know it’s hard when it’s someone you love. You’re afraid to hope. But this was front to back. You know that’s better.”
“There wasn’t,” Lestrade said. John nodded decisively. Sherlock had stopped pacing and was looking at John. There was the barest ghost of smile on his face. John smiled back. “But we did find the case,” the DI continued. “Sherlock, you can’t withhold evidence.”
Looking at John with blood on his hands and a deep weariness in his eyes convinced Sherlock that he had overestimated the romance of death by serial killer. Riding with him in the ambulance later, John simply said, “I can’t do this anymore, we’re both getting too old for this.”  John wasn’t looking at him, but his hand clenched, warm and tight, around Sherlock’s. His mouth was a thin line. Sherlock decided that it was best not to point out that he wasn’t even quite sixty yet.
“It was the son. The signs of a break-in were faked after the murder. Obvious from the blood spatter on the window sill. He’s too old to be living with his mother. Financial difficulties. There were two betting slips pushed down behind a sofa cushion in the lounge. Ladbrokes, horses. High stakes and long odds. The man is a gambler and he’s getting desperate.”
“John,” Lestrade said, “these are Sergeants Donovan and Anderson. My team. Sorry, again, but we needed to talk to Sherlock. We’re letting him in on the case, but he can’t just go off on his own, and he can’t withhold evidence. Sherlock, we have more evidence. Shall we let Dr. Watson finish his dinner? We can talk outside.”
“Get … bed with me, John.”
“Come
John didn’t finish the sentence. Silence fell. Sherlock didn’t look up from the microscope. They still didn’t talk about Mary almost killing Sherlock. They didn’t talk about Mary. They didn’t talk about much.
After an actual serial killer had trapped both Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson in Baker Street, Sherlock had been persuaded to imagine another ending for himself. Harvey Wilkinson had tied them to the sturdy kitchen chairs in the flat and proceeded to carve verses from Dante’s
“You did
“Serial killer,” said Sally. “Far more likely.”
underneath his right collar bone were still particularly clear.
“At my time of life, I need my sleep, young man. This has to stop. You need to talk to someone about whatever is bothering you.”
“You can sit down if you like,” John said. “Private room in a military hospital. I assume that’s your doing. I’m grateful, but you don’t have to stay. I don’t need a nurse-maid. They’ll take good care of me, and I’m sure you've got better things to do.” John’s voice gave out on the last phrase. Mycroft stood and helped him drink. John nodded his thanks.
~~~~~
John cleared his throat. “Me, too. Army surgeon. Used to be.” He paused. He had to say it, couldn’t keep it inside any longer. “Less than a 5% survival rate for gunshot trauma with cranial involvement."
move. There’s shaving foam behind your left ear. Nobody’s pointed it out to you. You live on your own. There was a photograph of children in your cab, but the mother was cut out. So not dead, just… deserted? Photo’s old, but the frame is new. You love your children, but you don’t get to see them. Estranged father. And it hurts.” The cabbie looked down. So he was right. But there was more. He felt the song of adrenaline in his veins, that heavenly feeling of connections sparking in his mind. There was so much more.
Sherlock didn’t. That was surprising in itself. “Can you stay until we know… something?”
“See, no-one thinks about the cabbie. Invisible, just the back of an 'ead.” He smiled. “Proper advantage for a serial killer.”
“I… I…,” her voice was faint. “I was….” Then nothing again.
“My son. You’re my son.”
“Look, Sherlock. It’s best to clear the air about this now. I know you’re not interested. You said in one of your emails that you were married to your work. That’s perfectly fine. Does that mean you’re not interested in sex at all? I mean, I’m clear that you’re not interested in me in that way. But if you want to have sex outside the partnership or other relationships, it would be fine, as long as we’re clear about…” John let his voice trail off. He noticed a delicate flush staining the white skin of the man sitting by his bedside. He also noted that the brilliant eyes were looking at some point at the foot of the bed, not at him. Interesting. One thing about his new partner, he was nothing if not interesting.
Baudelaire said that cigarettes interrupt time, but could they turn it back? Maybe for a little while. Eighteen cigarettes left.
“Do you want me to go now?” Mycroft sounded diffident.
“Me, too. Get on your phone and find somewhere near the hospital. We’ll get takeaway.”
“We got back to Karachi, found a little guest house on the bay. We got two rooms. Two rooms, John. Just want to be clear about that. I never intended for anything to happen.”
Sally made it to the car just then. High heels weren’t the best for police work, but Sherlock realized that the heels were part of Sally’s plan to rise high in the Met. She wanted to look both professional and sexy. Classy and dominant. She did have admirable legs. Why she was bothering with Anderson was still a mystery to him. Likely childhood issues.
“I’m making tea. Stay if you like.” He turned, went into the kitchen, and filled the kettle. He heard John shuffling in behind him. He didn’t turn.
Jerry was the Colonel’s aide and Battalion mascot. He was a cheery kid from Glasgow who was even shorter than John. He had a shock of red hair, a nose sprinkled with freckles, and good taste in porn and whiskey. John liked him, but not at the moment. He had caught John on his way to his tent after nine straight hours in surgery.
“Bloody hell,” said Lestrade. “He must have seen something, thought of something… We can’t take a chance with Mrs. Hudson. I’ll talk to the team. Sally, see if you can get a fix on the phone. See if it’s still in the flat.”
“I want him here,” said Sherlock. “Can you…?”
He wasn’t sure what to say to that. Hadn’t she offered tea? Earlier? He must have misread something. He often did. Then her voice came again, softer, but quite discernable.
been interesting.
Sherlock got to the car first. He hurled himself into the back seat and jerked the pink case onto the seat beside him.
“I think he is referring to ‘Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,’” said Sherlock, feeling his leg for damage. Mycroft had been careful to pull the blow, but it still hurt like the devil. “Chinese tradition, but similar approach to the
Sherlock thrust his hand out, still brandishing the knife with the other hand. “Why not apple? Mince? Bloody Americans.”
,” he hissed. He didn’t know who was more surprised at that statement, Hope or himself.  “Now I want the name of your sponsor.”
John loved having a glass of whiskey here as dusk fell during the summer. It was his chosen spot, even at the end when Sherlock carried him out into the garden and tucked him up into one of the chairs, a blanket wrapped around his legs.
She cuffed them both around their heads.
“You don’t mind?”
“Mycroft found me, saved me, blah, blah, blah. Sent me to rehab in Yorkshire, where they wouldn’t let us smoke. No drugs, no cigarettes. I gave up sex, too. Too many associations. It worked after a fashion. For a while. I went back to London, got a dreadful flat in Montague Street. I became interested in crime, found I had a talent for solving it. Met Lestrade. You know most of this already, John. Tedious. Got bored, got high again. Started smoking again. Didn’t take up sex again for quite a while. I thought if I could keep it to two out of three, I might not be driven to overdose. Got clean, got high. Got clean, got high. What? Yes, John, good imitation of my voice. Tedious.”
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson, but I’ll go up. Long day.” He wanted to check his email. Had Captain Watson even gotten the email he sent? He had no idea how long communications to Army bases in Afghanistan took. His research had revealed that internet access was problematic and expensive in combat areas. Most soldiers seemed to have access only to shared computers, and those were usually in high demand.
The chase is on, and Sherlock demonstrates that he has more than one addiction.
phone. Wonderful.” Just then the phone began to ring.
The cab stopped. Two identical buildings.
They smoked. At some point Lestrade put an arm around his shoulders. He didn’t shake it off.
Sherlock looked at the bottles. Well, he had to hand it to the man, it was a different angle on serial killing. Strangely sporting. He was sorry to disappoint him.
Sherlock thought that this wasn’t the setting he would have chosen for his death. But then he wasn’t going to die.
“Oi!” John said. “He’s not a murderer, and he’s not a psychopath. He’s bloody brilliant, and if you can’t keep a civil tongue in your head, you can get the hell out of my room. All of you. Now.” John regretted that they weren’t allowing him to put weight on his left leg, since it was still healing from the vein harvesting. He regretted it, but that twat Anderson should be bloody grateful for it or he would have been flat on his back on the cool linoleum floor just about now. Asshole.
She looked back over the expanse of the morgue. Seven. Nothing in her in-box, not so much as a sheet of paper, much less the files required for two additional autopsies. She went through everything in her outbox and found only the files from yesterday. Those bodies had been released and removed yesterday. She looked in every drawer in her desk. Nothing. Now she was angry. She knew people were worn down and rushed off their feet, but there was a procedure. There had to be paperwork, otherwise you risked confusion and delay.
Sherlock groans again. The sound is bordering on indecent. “Same. Pain comes with movement.”
“Back home, trying to get the insurance people to come and look at the damages we’ve suffered.”
He licks his lips, once more running his hand through his hair. “What I’m trying to say is that I worry that she may get teased by others because of how she is. It may seem innocent, but it isn’t, is it? Teasing, bullying. It leaves scars. Anyway ... I’m sorry. For how we treated you back then. You never tried to fit in, and I think we didn’t know how to deal with that. But we shouldn’t have been such arseholes about it, whatever we felt towards you. So ... yeah. I’m sorry. And thank you again for agreeing to help us with Tiffany. You really didn’t have to do that. I’d have understood had you declined.”
“I fear he’s still interested in his ex.”
“Yes, I know. But he’s got better at that. Keeping me in the loop, I mean. He would have replied by now, if he were able to. Case or no case.”
“Where are we, Mr. Hope?”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” said Mycroft. “I never forget anything.”
John interrupted. “Nope. You’re doing fine, too. I don’t really want to talk about it at the moment. I liked having something to think about. Hi, by the way. Nice to finally meet you.”
“Would you like an update on your condition now, Dr. Watson, or would you prefer to rest?”
He dropped down onto his bunk and bent to unlace his boots. Half-hidden under the cot was a bluey. Must have gotten knocked off in all the comings and goings of his mates. Oh, god. He remembered Sherlock Holmes. He had meant to try to communicate with the man. He finished taking off his boots, picked up the sealed, tri-folded, light blue page, and opened it.
“God, Gladys, I’m so sorry I’m late,” he said. He went over to the hospital bed and kissed Mrs. Hudson’s cheek. “Sorry, Mrs. H. I had to… um… walk Gladstone. Then Sherlock was fussing about the….”
“Well, budge over.” He did. The pink case was between them.
“Already done. If it’s possible for him to travel, he’ll be sent to Queen Alexandra.”
“Regent’s Park. Or it could be the training college in the park. You know, the one near the business school. Deserted at night. Or there are all sorts of places in the park he could drag him. Hurry.”
Just then, there were footsteps and raised voices in the hallway. “Police business,” John heard. Then the room was suddenly quite crowded. Sherlock bounded out of the chair.
Mycroft shifted uncomfortably at the word “manage.”
John texted as fast as he could. His left shoulder radiated pain. He didn’t care. His hand seemed to be working. That was good. “Done.”
He tenderly dried off Sherlock’s hand. Not deep enough for stitches. He affixed a butterfly bandage and applied tape over all.
“You’re not going to stand me up at the altar, are you? Not getting cold feet? Jesus, Sherlock…”
“Love you, Harry.” He said, trying not to think of how many times she had promised exactly that.
“What? Oh, number two. Drug overdose. Advantages: I’d have to go into London to get the drugs. It would be nice to see London one last time. I was thinking a speedball. The ecstatic high, then the mellow descent in the dark. Mycroft kept Baker Street empty, so I’d do it there. Full circle. Can’t really think of any disadvantages, except that you’d be disappointed in me. But you’re gone, John. Oh. I said that already, didn’t I? The third? Slow but sure. Keep smoking, quit eating, discreet drug use. A slower method, but I don’t think it would take long. Advantages? I’m quite liking the smoking part. Perhaps more elegant. Not showy. I would go gentle into the night, good or otherwise. Disadvantages? It would involve Tess. I know, she’ll be involved anyway. She’s our daughter, after all. But she and Michael are in America right now. The symphony is touring. Methods one and two, while difficult for her, have the advantage that it happens while she’s away. She doesn’t have to go through another slow decline. Doesn’t have to identify the body. By the time she gets back, that will all be sorted. I’ll even leave a letter for the vicar with everything planned.”
