“Just don’t be too loud coming back in. I'm going to sleep, and once I’m out, I don’t want to wake up again until it’s...time.”
“I require...a purifier. A vessel to live through, a weapon to unleash when the battle is underway and sheath when the war is won. I must have a living, breathing person beside me who will stop at nothing to see the light I have promised their people come to fruition.”
Castiel slid his gaze over Dean's face, admiring him openly. Castiel had never seen someone who wore their expressions so open and unguarded in front of strangers. But Castiel also took value in Dean's trust of him.
I squirm, my cheeks feeling slightly heated at him blatantly checking me out. "That's not going to change that I'm not attracted to women who fucking kidnap people. She'll never get what she wants from me because I won't respond to her raping me."
"I hope you have a good journey into Winchester. I'll try to catch some fish in the stream when I check upon the bees. Hopefully we can feast on that tonight." Castiel stood up, rubbing his hands together to shake off loose crumbs.
The man speaks, his normal indifference dissipating at the woman's presence. "Hello, boss. I gave him the antidote, and I've left the explanation for you to do, since you were the one that wanted him here. I'm leaving now."
The shout was incoherent to him, too far away to hear anything, but it alarmed Castiel nonetheless. He had neither seen nor heard anyone in the parts of the forest he was usually in, not that seeing or hearing anybody was a regular occurrence to him. Castiel's intrigue peaked when he heard the noises of hooves clomping, getting louder and louder and louder until finally—
"Yes, we live over there," Castiel gestured vaguely in the direction of their cottage. "I have been with them for as long as I can remember."
Like how his piercing eyes show thousands of ocean waves crashing together in a beautiful chaotic symphony.  How his tie is always crooked.  How he always has messy sex hair, even though he’s only had sex once.  Like how he loves to hear Cas say “Hello Dean” in his weirdly deep voice.
“What is your problem, Dean?  It’s my life, my choice, and I decided that the potion was more important at the time being.”  Castiel growls.
Castiel.  What an interesting name.  Suits him and his interesting eyes.  I look around in the dark.  Right here, right now.  The pistol I keep in the trunk is calling to me.  Just as I’m about to pull off onto a side road-
“I am so sorry!”  He says, walking over to my booth.  “Usually the Kelsi’s are my last customers for the night.  Can I interest you in another cup of coffee to go with the pie?”  I laugh, wiping my mouth on a napkin.
“That’s all I needed to hear.”  Just as their lips make contact, Castiel is pulled backward with a surprising amount of force.  Dean’s eyes snap open at the unfamiliar voice.
“Meg?!”  Standing next to Castiel is Meg Masters, Cas’s ex...well... ex-demon that he kissed.  She laughs and places a hand on Cas’s shoulder.
The sun is just barely poking out of the horizon when my stomach growls.  I check the clock and sigh.  I have a long night of research ahead of me.  When I get assigned a target, I learn everything about them.  This gives me information about when and where the perfect time to take them out is.  I can also know the whereabouts of the people they associate with, which helps avoid suspicion.  Rolling down the main road, most shops are closed by now.  My apartment is still about twenty minutes away, and I really don’t want to wait.  Seeing lights, I pull up next to a small coffee shop just barely hidden away from the cacophony of the main strip.  I put Baby in park and step out.
“Son of a bitch,”  I mutter.  I’m about to be late for my work.  I throw ten dollars on the table again, even though I know my meal didn’t cost ten dollars.  Standing up, I grab my phone, my plan in motion.  Pushing open the door, I step outside.  The sky is somewhere between light and dark grey, filled with clouds both angry and calm.  Such a different atmosphere than inside where all the colors were bright.
“I’m gonna take him home and care for him until I find his family,”  He says.  I bite my lip to keep from smiling.  That is so wholesome.  Makes me curious.
“Alright, I’ll walk you out,”  He says, walking my way.  Castiel leads me out of the apartment and shuts the door behind us.  Then he turns to me.  “Thank you for the ride,”  He says.  Looking up at me, he blushes and hands me the jacket.
““Welcome to the Sunrise Café, thank you for letting us brighten your day, what can I do for you?”” I look up and quickly flip my phone over.  Standing in front of me is not the target. Not Cas. This time, it’s a girl, short and petite. It’s the redhead from the other night at the bar.  Her name tag says “Charlie”. She wears a wrinkled white polo shirt and a bright blue half apron. She’s leaning against the side of the booth. From her body language and hairstyle and everything about her, she’s not straight. Nothing about her says she’s straight, from her bright red hair to her black converse high tops.  What a shame, she’s adorable.  However, she’s close to the target, which means that she could be useful.  “Uhh hellooooo what can I get for you?” I jerk out of my daze and lock eyes with her. I clear my voice, my cheeks reddening.
“That nothing is more important than your life!”  A bird crows somewhere in the distance.  There is silence, bar the sounds of nature.  After a few seconds, Dean dares to look over at Cas.  He’s looking up.  His messy, dark brown hair flutters in the slight morning breeze.  His pale blue eyes are striking in contrast to the vibrant yellows and oranges that paint the sky as the sun peeks out over the horizon line and the dark green trees that frame the desolate road.  Cas can feel Dean watching him and snaps his attention back to lock their eyes in a tension-filled stare.  Dean swallows.  He notices that they are standing less than a foot away from each other.
“CAS!  CAS!” Dean continues to yell.  He yells until his voice is practically gone.  “Cas.”  He croaks out, sinking to his knees in the gravel.  He doesn’t care that he looks pathetic.  He doesn’t care about the tears streaming freely down his face.  He doesn’t care that his voice is gone.
“I should too.  I’ll walk you out, and actually remember to lock the door this time,”  He says.  I chuckle and watch as his face lights up.  I smile and lead the way.  I walk back out into the commotion, the small canopy above protecting us from the rain.  Cas locks the door behind us and sticks the key in his pocket.  The café is dark now.  He looks at me and smiles.  “Well, have a good night.”  He says.  Then I watch as he walks straight into the downpour.  Before I can stop myself, I yell.
“Hi, uh, I’ll take a black coffee with sugar and two slices of apple pie,”  I say, my voice tight.  He smiles again and looks down at his notepad.  He quickly writes my order in cursive.  He raises his head and locks eyes with me.
“It was a matter of priority, Dean,”  Cas says, now yelling as well.  “That potion was going to save Jack, and that is far more important than my life.”  Dean suddenly swerves the car off the road and into a shallow clearing.  It overlooks a small, rocky cliff.  He switches off the engine.
Morning at the cafe is much much different than late at night.  The place is packed; old couples line the exterior, drinking mugs of coffee and nibbling on toast, while the more extroverted teenagers to middle agers fill the small tables and brighter booths, laughing and scrolling on their phones.  A group of small children gobble down messy chocolate chip pancakes while their parents try to hide their shame.  When we were younger, Dad would never bring us out in public.  Of course, Dad never brought us anywhere, so it didn’t really matter to me. I slip into the same booth as last night, unnoticed.  It’s very warm in here. I pull my leather jacket off and place it on the booth next to me.  I very slowly scan the room.  The target is not in sight.  I sigh and pull out my phone. I need to find the best solution to this. Clicking onto the notes app, I quickly type in “No morning shifts?”
“It’s on your nametag, Cas.”  I say, pulling out into the street.  His head whips down to his nametag and he goes bright red.  The plan is going much better than expected.  I guess the rain was good luck.  The original plan was to purposely leave my jacket at the cafe and follow him home.  But now I get to take him home.  Less suspicion.  Less chance of getting caught.
Finally, there’s a break in traffic and I speed along through the flash flood until I pull up next to the Sunrise Café.  The lights are still on inside.  Dimmed, but still on.  However, the sign is flipped to close.  I see a figure in the darkness.  Seemingly six feet tall.  The target.  I brace myself as I step out of the car and into the storm.  A clap of thunder resounds behind me.  My boots instantly get soaked.  However, they protect my socks.  Which helps immensely.  I walk up to the front doors and knock on the glass.  He doesn’t turn around.  He can’t hear me through the rain.
I walk to the car with the pie in my hand.  Taking the driver's seat as always, I watch as Cas re-locks the door and shuts off the light.  Somehow his eyes still shine in the dark.  I couldn’t do anything tonight with that senior couple.  I still have two weeks.  Next time.  Turning the engine, I pull out into the street and start my drive home.
Dean,”  Cas cuts him off.  He steps forward so that he’s right in front of Dean.  Dean’s heart rate spikes to a quick 120 march tempo, as if someone was playing High School Cadets against his sternum.  The next words that come out of his mouth shake Dean to his core.  “I know.”
“Twelve, and there’s no way I trust the people of the Bronx with my baby brother.  Even though he knows how to shoot a revolver with pinpoint accuracy.” I say.  Hot oil drips onto my forehead as I loosen a bolt.  I cringe.  “Harv, can you pass me the pliers?”  No reply.  “Harv?”  I roll out from under the Jeep again and wipe my eyes.  “Harv?”  But he’s gone.  I see him with a customer across the shop.  “Whatever,” I grumble, and get back to work.
“My name.  It’s Castiel.  Cas is just a nickname,”  I don’t understand why he feels the need to tell me this, but it just adds to the file of information I have on him.
Cas is standing a couple of feet in front of him.  Dean stares in shock as a sort of black goo materializes next to Cas and forms the shape of a person.  Dean immediately reaches for the gun in the waistband of his jeans, but he never raises it.
“No Gabriel.  He drove me home from work today.  He actually lives right down the hall.”  Cas says.  I wish he hadn’t said that.  I wasn’t supposed to tell him that, and now this Gabriel person knows too.
What the fuck.  He unbuckles his seatbelt.  Then, he looks back at me.  “Why don’t you come inside?  I can give you your jacket back when I put Puddles in something warm,”
“Gabriel,”  Cas says, staring daggers into his soul.  Gabriel laughs, staring back.  Awkward silence fills the room as they stare at each other.  Gabriel wiggles his eyebrows.  Suddenly the silence is broken by the sound of a tea kettle screaming.  Cas flinches and turns around, turning off the stove.  He slowly pours the boiling water into two mugs with cocoa powder in them.
“What the HELL Cas?!” I yell, my heartbeat loud in my ears.  Cas flings open the passenger door and runs around the front of the car into the rain.  I stare at him, confused, and also climb out of the car.  I find him kneeling in front of the hood.  There’s something stuck in the water slowly flooding the street.  “Is that?”
“Well, come on, let’s get him out of the rain,”  I say.  He nods and walks back to the car.  I shake my head and get back in.  I look over at Cas, who can’t stop smiling at the duckling in his hands.  It’s shivering.  “Here,”  I say, and slip off my jacket.  “Put him in this, warm him up a little bit,”  Castiel looks at me, seemingly surprised.  He takes the coat and places the duckling on the inside.  The duck nuzzles into one of the sleeves, trying to get warm.
Dean pushes himself up until he’s standing again.  He slides one arm around Cas’s waist.  Cas moves one hand to Dean’s chest, placing the other on his upper arm.  Dean grabs hold of Castiel’s signature blue tie and pulls him closer until their chests are touching.
“Alright.  You can go have a seat at one of the booths and I’ll bring it to you when it’s ready,”  He says.  I break our eye contact and look away.  I nod my head and turn away, my face burning.  I pick the booth furthest away from the senior couple in the corner, which puts me in the dark blue section.  I slide into it and shift my eyes back over to the counter.  I pull out my phone and open the notes app.  In a blank note, I copy and paste the photo of the target provided for me.  And then underneath, I write his name.  Cas.  I watch him pour hot coffee into a pastel yellow mug.  His hands are so steady, practiced.  Just like mine.  Different, yet the same.  I look back at my phone.
As his heart rate slows, Dean leans back just a few inches and opens his eyes.  Cas’s are now open too.  Dean smiles, knowing he will now be able to tell the angel all of the other things he adores about him.
“Well, our handsome little Castiel here wanted to save his little Nephilim friend, you know?  Jack, his name is, looks exactly like him.  Kind of like a son to Castiel, which is actually kind of creepy since he’s the Devil’s kid, but no matter.  Anyway, so instead of the little brat dying, “Cas” offered himself up instead.”  She says Cas’s name as though it leaves a bad taste in her mouth.  Dean whips to face Cas at break-neck speed.  Cas looks at the ground, refusing to meet Dean’s eyes.  “However, I told him that I would take him when he finally allowed himself to be truly happy again.  All I had to do was wait for the magic words.”
“We’re all going to the bar after close.  Wanna come?”  He asks.  He holds a can of beer in one hand and a wrench in the other.  Normally, I would say yes.  But I only have two weeks to rid the streets of New York of the blue-eyed beauty.  I shake my head.
“Just here,”  Cas says, snapping me out of my thoughts.  I roll the car to a stop in front of a large apartment building, identical to every other apartment on the street.  But that’s just New York City.  Also, very identical to mine.  I look up at the building, and almost choke.  It’s the same building I live in.
It would be so easy to kill him here.  No one is around.  The door is locked.  Could be an unfortunate kitchen accident.  Easy.  Quick and done.  However, the elderly couple saw me.  That causes complications.  I clear my throat to signal him and he practically jumps a mile, his eyes snapping open in shock.
“Dammit, Cas!”  He yells.  Dean throws open his door and steps out, slamming it behind him.  The early morning air chills his face.  It’s just before sunrise.  He walks around the front of the car and leans heavily on the hood.  A few moments later he feels the car move as Cas steps out and joins him, leaning lightly on the car next to him.
“I’ve loved you ever since Jack brought you back from the Empty.  I’ve loved you ever since you were human.  Ever since you escaped Purgatory.  Ever since you saved Sam from Hell.  Ever since you wanted to become a hunter.  Ever since you copied the Pizza Man.  Ever since you got us kicked out of that sex bar.  Ever since you held that FBI badge upside down.”  Dean looks up at Cas.  His face is unreadable.  “Ever since you carved Enochian into my ribs.  Ever since you fell.  Ever since I stabbed you in the chest with the Demon Knife.”  Dean lets out a small laugh and a smile spreads across his face.  “I’ve loved you ever since you pulled me out of Hell.”  Dean turns around and leans on the Impala again, facing Cas.
“Jack is alive.  Sam is safe.  We saved Kaia, and now Death is helping us,”  he places his hand on Dean’s shoulder, the same shoulder he branded all those years ago.  Cas flashes Dean one of his rare, beautiful smiles.  “The world is ending.  Yet, in this moment, I have never been happier.”  It’s all the motivation Dean needs to lean in again.
“Get in, Cas.”  I yell over the rain.  He looks shocked for a second before sitting in the passenger seat.  His uniform is soaked.  His hair drips rain onto his seat.  I can always dry it.
Sunrise Café.  Dark hair.  Six foot.  Blue eyes.  Cas.  “Here you go, one hot black with sugar and two slices of apple pie.”  I quickly stuff my phone in my pocket and look up.  He stands next to the table with a tray containing the mug and two saucers.  He sets down the mug in front of me.  The yellow glows against the dark oak.  Next comes the pie.  The scent of heated cinnamon surrounds me in a whirlwind of warm aromas.  Out of pure habit I smile.  “I take it you like pie?”  I jerk my head up and see Cas smiling, holding the tray to his body and smiling slightly.  My cheeks flame as I nod slowly.  “Well, I hope it tastes great!  Enjoy!”  He places a fork and a knife down on the table in front of me and then turns away.  I should say thank you.  But I don’t.
“Nothing,”  Dean repeats.  “is more important than your life.  Not some stupid potion, not some fight with God, and not the freakin apocalypse, do you hear me?!”
Execution takes time and planning, and can’t be stopped by something as simple as precipitation.  I glance at the radio again and see the time, 8:05, illuminated on the dashboard.  Yesterday, the Kelsi’s were out of the cafe by 8 pm sharp.  I could be too late.
“Where are you taking him?”  Dean dares to ask.  He already knows he’s not going to like the answer.
Memories flood back into my head, hitting me like a truck.  All the times Dad came home with his hands covered in blood, demanding that I grab Sammy and put him in the car.  We were constantly moving.  I growl and throw my beer onto the table next to my bed.  I don’t need this.  I don’t need him.  All I need is Sam.  Tears sting my eyes.  I practically punch the delete button on his contact and watch as my only connection left to Dad goes away forever.
“Thank you.” I say. Charlie nods and walks away from the booth. Interesting. She takes big strides for such a small girl.  I look around the restaurant again.  Nothing seems out of the ordinary.  How different it would’ve looked this morning if I had done my job last night.  Police tape and blood and grieving customers.  How satisfying that would have been.  THe clinking of forks and spoons against glass plates is excruciating.  I usually never spend time around too many people.  Too much commotion.  Too many witnesses.  But something about this cafe is oddly comforting.  I can’t explain it.  Soft music plays from the speakers, calming.  A timer resounds from behind the counter.
At this, Castiel’s head snaps up and his eyes lock with Dean’s.  Dean watches as tears roll down Cas’s cheeks, leaving glistening tracks as they fall.  Dean takes a step forward, but Meg takes one back, pulling the angel with her.  Dean can barely process what’s happening.
His blue eyes pierce through the darkness of the nightclub, shining brighter than the sequins on the hookers’ dresses.  He sips slowly on his glass of ice water while the girl in front of him drinks her beer and laughs. He smiles into his cup. A very, very cute smile. His dark hair is tousled and sweaty. His crisp white polo and sky blue sweater vest make him stick out like a daisy in a garden of roses. He is nervous.  Bored.  Out of his element.  His eyes shift and glance my way, skimming over me. For a brief second, I panic thinking he saw me. But he just turns back to the redhead and drinks more water.  He is gorgeous.  He is mine.  As I peek at my phone to confirm my suspicions, only one thought is going through my head.
A volt of electricity strikes through Cas as he stumbles forward, and Dean’s lips are on his.  His lips are warm and taste of apple pie and whiskey.  It happens so fast, Cas can barely close his eyes.  Dean lets go of his coat and pushes Cas away.  Cas stumbles back a couple of feet just by the sheer force of Dean’s push, but also in shock.  He can feel that his face is beet red, and it is mirrored in Dean’s face as well.
“Come inside.  I have cocoa,”  He states, as if that would be enough.  But, since it’s cold and wet outside, it kind of is.  Plus, I live here too.  I pull the key out of ignition and follow him to the front door.  Not only do I now know where he lives, but now he’s inviting me inside.  Alone, in his house.  This is perfect.  Holding Puddles in one hand, he opens the door and walks inside.  I shut the door behind us and follow him up the stairs to the top floor.  He opens a door to an apartment on the left side.  One apartment away from mine. Ours share the same walls.
“No-can-do, Harv.  Gotta pick Sammy up from school.”  Which isn’t technically a lie.  Sam, my little brother, goes to the public middle school.  But he’s home before I get out of work.  Not that Harv knows that.  No one really knows about my personal life.  I hold out my hand for the wrench.  “Maybe next time.”  He shrugs and hands me the wrench.
“What deal, Cas?”  Dean asks, his voice shaky.  He is certain that he doesn’t want to hear the answer.  This time, Cas’s face is riddled with guilt.
“I’ll keep those muffins warm for you Mr. and Mrs. Kelsi,”  he says.  Both of them smile.  The man, Mr. Kelsi, leaves a five dollar bill on the counter.  Cas leans his mop against the wall and walks over to the door, holding it open for them to exit.  Mrs. Kelsi hugs Cas tightly and then takes her husband’s hand as they leave.  Cas waves to them as they walk out into the dark parking lot.  I didn’t realize how much the sun had already gone down.  I watch as Cas flips the sign from “open” to “close” and lock the door.  I raise my eyebrows as he turns around and leans on the doorframe, his eyes shut.  He breathes in deeply...once...twice...three times.
“No, sorry, café policy.  First time customers get their order free,”  He says, picking up my now empty plates.  I hand him the coffee mug.  Our fingers brush gently in the transaction, and I can feel the heat radiating off his smooth skin.  My heart skips a beat and my breath hitches.
“A baby duck,”  He says quietly.  The bright yellow shines through the dark rain, but it’s soaked.  It’s wing is crumpled and bloody.  Cas looks around.  “I don’t see any others around,”  He says.  Cas stands up, the duckling now in his hands.  It barely fits.  A small quack comes from the duck and Castiel smiles.
Dean feels the rumble of the Impala’s engine through the steering wheel as he grips it tight.  His knuckles begin to turn white.  Anger still flows through his veins like boiling water.
An idea pops into my head, but it seems too cruel for me.  To toy with someone’s feelings, only to end up killing them in the end is just evil.  Yes, I could get closer to the target by going by this route, but I couldn’t do that to him.  That would be cruel to anybody.  I step into my apartment.  The lights are all off.  I shove the paper in my jeans pocket and walk over to Sam’s door.  It’s closed.  I knock lightly.  “Sammy?”  No response.  I push open the door and see Sam curled up under his covers, knocked out.  His brown hair covers his eyes.  He refuses to let me  cut it.  He also refuses to tell me why.  I assume it has something to do with Mom, so I just leave him be, even if I have to stop myself from just swiping at it with my pocket knife.
“Here, let me make you some cocoa,” Cas walks over to the kitchen and sets a kettle on the stove.  He leans against the counter and smiles at me.  “Thank you for the ride home.  I’m sorry for being such an inconvenience.  Do you live far from here?”  He asks.  Again, I find myself unwillingly opening up to him.
“This was in the pocket, I didn’t want it to get ruined while I was washing it,” Cas says.  In his hand is an old photograph of me, Sammy, and our mom.  We were very young.  Mom looked about to be my age now.  Sammy is barely three.  Our smiles are all so big, so genuine.  I barely even remember the last good time we had with her, before she left.  But that was years ago.  I reach out for the photograph, our hands touching in the exchange.  Again, a jolt of electricity goes through my veins.  I look up at him and find him staring at me again.  If only there weren’t cameras, this would be so easy.
“Thank you,”  I say.  This is also different than last night.  I thanked him.  Hm.  He smiles back.  Then he turns and walks back to the counter and grabs another plate of pie.  I look away from him and focus on my pie.  Just like last night, it’s delicious.
“Really?  What a coincidence!”  He says, his face going red.  He blushes a lot.  Goes with his eyes.  I wonder why he’s always so nervous.  I spot a knife on the counter behind him.  I step closer to him.
“DEAN!”  Cas yells.  He pushes down really hard on my leg, causing me to slam on the breaks.  We both fling forward as the car comes to an abrupt stop.  My chest slams against the steering wheel, and his the dashboard.  Our heavy breathing fills the car, the rain like surround sound speakers.
“The sidewalks are literally flooded.”  Then I say something I never expected I would ever say.  “Let me drive you home,”  His face goes from nervous to endearing.
As the only bar in town to illegally (and secretly) serve minors, the room is filled with those ages eighteen to fourthly two. You could get away with an I.D. written in crayon so long as you pay for your drinks, remain fully clothed whilst inside, and keep your mouth shut if the cops show up.  Weapons are not allowed inside the bar, however living in the rough part of town means almost everyone here is armed with some kind of concealed knife or pepper spray.  I blend right in.
“I don’t feel that good tonight, Dean.” He says, holding his stomach.  I put the pie down on the coffee table and crouch next to him.  I place my hand on his forehead.  No fever.  I rub his shoulder.
“Cassieeeee does this jacket go with these shoes and oh, am I interrupting something?”  I snap around and see a short man standing in the doorway.  His golden hair is wavy and dry, contrast to Castiel’s dark, wet hair.  I step back from Cas, from the knife.  I didn’t know someone else was here.  Damn.  “Ooh, a new boyfriend, have we here?”  He asks.  My cheeks flame.  Now I understand his connection to Charlie and why they’re not dating.  He’s gay.  Well this looks much worse for me now.
“What’s up, Harv?” I grunt.  Harv, my coworker, stands above me, his eyes dark.  His face is naturally covered in soot from the years of hanging out under cars.  He stands tall, yet not his full height.  His back hunches over a bit due to lack of good posture.
“Coming!” A gruff voice comes from the back.  I look down at the glass, trying to decide what to eat.  I should also bring something home for Sammy.  “Welcome to the Sunrise Café, thank you for letting us brighten your day, what can I do for you?”  I look up, and my stomach drops.  His eyes match the crystal blue behind him.  His hair is moderately contained, yet still the same messy brown from last night.  His white polo is covered by a pastel pink apron, which makes his eyes pop and shine even more than they would by themselves.  He’s even more beautiful up close.  Instead of needing to do mountains of research, I find myself face to face with my target.  And I’m about to order pie from him.
“Come on in,”  he says.  Even though his apartment is the same size as ours, it looks bigger.  The floor of the living room is bare, bar the small rug under a white mesh wood coffee table.  The small loveseat is a deep blue velvet and looks like the most comfortable couch ever.  Another dark blue chair is next to it.  Behind the couch is a long bookcase filled with DVDs and movies.  “Wait here for one second,”  Cas says.  He walks down the short hallway and disappears into a door on the right.  I look around.  After a couple of seconds, he comes back out, Puddles swaddled in a light blue blanket.  My jacket is slung over his arm, which he then places on the counter.  He walks over to the chair and places the duckling down.  Puddles nuzzles into the blanket and immediately falls asleep.
“What the hell are you doing?  Where’s your car?”  I ask.  This is weird, and I know it is.  But I don’t let go.  He looks at me with dead confusion.
Hey guys! Thanks for reading this far!  Now that SATS and NGSA testing is over, hopefully we can go more steady. I hope you guys are enjoying it, and even if you’re not, then I am still gonna have fun on this journey!
“Since I gripped you tight and raised you from Perdition?”  Cas asks, his voice breaking slightly, shaky.  Dean blanches hearing those words again but also smiles.
“What are you doing here?  You scared me half to death!  I thought I locked the door!”  He yelps.  His voice is higher pitched than the first time I met him, probably out of fear.  My neck goes hot and I rub it.
“No problem, any time,”  I say, smiling.  Cas smiles back and awkwardly steps back into his apartment.  This has been the most confusing target I’ve ever had.  Walking down the hall, I reach into the pocket of my jacket to grab my house keys when I feel something weird.  I pull out a small sheet of paper and open it.  There's a phone number written on it in small script.  The even smaller name written next to it says “Castiel,”.  This job is turning out a lot easier than I expected for gathering information.  But something doesn’t seem right to me.  Why did he put his phone number in my jacket pocket?  Am I supposed to use it?  It seems... suggestive.
“Wait, your jacket,”  Cas says.  Before he can grab it, Gabriel snatches it up off the counter.  He turns it over in his hands and rubs his fingers over the leather.
“Sorry, I’ll take a hot black with two sugars please, and a slice of apple pie please.” I watch as she scribbles really quickly on a small notepad. She then sticks her pen behind her ear and crosses her legs.
“Oh hell no!”  He yells and fires his pistol.  A loud crack echoes through the deserted road, scaring away all wildlife in a three-mile radius.  However, the bullet never finds its target as The Empty’s body turns to black goo and the bullet passes right through.
“I’m going as fast as I can, Charlie.”  I look over at the counter and see Cas holding a huge tray carrying the holy grail.  Three apple pies.  I can practically smell them from here.  He sets them down on a counter behind Charlie and sighs.  I flip my phone back over and reopen the notes app.  This time, I delete the “No morning shifts?” and replace it with “Morning shifts.”  I look back over at Cas.  His dark hair is matted to his forehead with sweat.  I guess he’s the baker.  He grabs a large knife and slices into one of the pies.  That knife could be so useful.  My mouth is practically watering.  Switching to my camera, I put my phone casually under the table and snap a couple of pictures of the target.
Thanks for getting this far! With sats this week, it’s a bit of a work in progress, but hopefully it turns out okay! Until next time...
“Oh!  You mean you didn’t tell your boyfriend about our little deal?”  She laughs out.  “That is hysterical!  Way to go, Cassie!”
I could grab him and stab him with the knife in front of me.  It would be messy, but clothes can be washed.  My fingers itch as I hesitate.  “Thank you for dining here tonight, and I hope you’ll come again so we can make your sunrises better!”  He says quickly and with a smile. I nod and leave a ten dollar bill on the table.  I should thank him.  But I don’t.  Cas leads me over to the door and unlocks it for me.  “Thank you!”  He says again as I step out into the cool night air.
“Thank you,” I say again, but genuinely this time.  This is the only picture I have with my brother and Mom, and I keep it with me at all times.  Cas nods and shuffles awkwardly.  “Well, I should get going,”  I say.  Cas nods again.  He grabs a tan trench coat from a coat rack by the door and slips it on.
“Isn’t he like fourteen?  Can’t he walk himself home?”  Harv grunts.  I laugh and wheel myself back under the Jeep.  The smell of oil and heat instantly surrounds me.
“Cas,”  Dean laughs.  “We’re in the middle of the freakin apocalypse.  God himself is trying to completely screw us over and destroy our world, the sick son of a bitch, and we could literally die at any moment.”
“Mhm,”  Gabriel says.  He walks up to me and sticks his hand out for me to shake.  Something about him feels familiar.  “Hi.  I’m Gabriel.  Cas is my younger brother.  You fuck with him, you fuck with me.  Unless it’s in the kinky way,”  He says, dropping a wink.  Castiel goes even more red, which I didn’t think was possible at this point.  I shake his hand.  He’s very straightforward.  He seems tough.  I like him.  After I let go, Gabriel spins around to face Cas.  “You didn’t make me any cocoa?”  Cas scoffs and looks up at me.  He hands me a tall white mug filled with hot chocolate.  There are mini marshmallows floating around on top.  I smile.  It’s been so long since I’ve had hot chocolate.
“Dean,”  He nods, as if testing my name on his tongue.  Damn.  He hesitates for a minute before looking back out into the rain.  “Okay… Thank you, Dean.”  He says with a shy smile.  I can’t stop myself from smiling as I walk over to my car.  Climbing into the driver's seat, I watch as he stops outside the door, still unsure of whether or not to get in.  I reach across the center console and open the door for him.
“You could’ve gotten yourself killed, that’s why!”  Dean tells, his eyes going back to the road in front of them.
Hey! Thanks! Chapters are gonna start being longer like this one hopefully. I’m at a good creative flow right now so yeah.  Feel free to let me know what you think so far!
“Sammy! I’m home!” I say, slamming the apartment door behind me.  I throw my keys on the counter.  I don’t hear the TV on in the living room like normal.  “Sammy?”  Holding the pie, I walk into the living room.  The TV is off.  Sam is lying on the couch staring at the ceiling in his pajamas.  His brown hair is matted on his forehead.  He refuses to let me give him a haircut.  “Heya Sam!  I brought some apple pie.  I had some, and trust me, this pie is bitchin’.” I say.  He grumbles and sits up.
“Hey, Cas,” Charlie whispers.  I’ve trained my ears to pick up even the slightest of details and noises.  I look over and watch as Charlie nudges Cas with her elbow.  She holds a bottle of maple syrup, which is irrelevant.  I turn my head slightly so it doesn’t look like I'm watching.  But I can still see them in my peripheral vision.  Charlie flicks her chin in my direction.  She doesn’t say anything else, but I watch as Cas’s face slightly reddens.  He recognizes me.  Probably because I didn’t kill him.  “Pie,”  Charlie states bluntly.  Cas’s face goes redder and he nods kurtly.  He scoops a slice of pie onto a plate and looks back at Charlie.  She nods quickly.  I shove my phone in my jeans pocket as Cas starts to walk over to my booth.
“You’ll feel better after you get some sleep.  How about I put the pie in the fridge and you can have it for breakfast before school tomorrow okay?” I say, taking hold of his arm.  He nods and lets me help him up.  I hug him in my arms and walk him to his bedroom.  Periodic tables and pictures of animals line his walls.  He’s so smart for his age.  He groans as he climbs into bed.  “It’s just a stomachache, you’ll be okay, I promise.”  I say, turning off the light.  “Goodnight Sammy.”
“Oof!”  He grunts, and stumbles, falling against my chest.  His pulse is racing.  He quickly stands up straight, still holding my arms.  Despite being in the rain for less than five seconds, his coat is soaked.
I look up from the table I sit alone at and skit my eyes across the room. The “keep your clothes on” rule doesn’t always seem to stick with some people.  Men and women alike wear threads, claiming them to be clothes.  I feel my eyes start to glaze over; until I see him.
I sigh and pick up my coffee mug.  It’s so flavorless compared to the pie.  I cringe at the heat and glance over at the Cas again, keeping my head down.  He is mopping near the women’s bathroom door.  The elderly couple must realize how late it is because they stand up.  “Have a great night, Cas.  We’ll see you again tomorrow!”  The woman says shakily.  Cas looks up and waves at them, smiling widely.
I pull the keys to Baby out of my jeans pocket and climb in.  Smiling mischievously, I wait to pull into the busy main street away from the cafe.  Glancing back inside, I see Charlie and the target talking, hunched over.  Cas’s cheeks are red again.  I wonder if he’s sick.  That would make things easier.  He wouldn’t be able to fight back as hard.  When it’s finally my turn to go, I break my gaze away.  However as I pull into the street, I swear I see his blue eyes look my way before he disappears in the distance
Instead I pick up the fork and hungrily slice into the pie.  My mouth waters even as I bring the fork towards me.  All of my stress and pain goes away as soon as I take a bite; flaky and light crust, gooey and sweet filling, yet somehow tart at the same time, the warm brown sugar compliments the cinnamon topping the bitter apples in such a balanced way.  This one slice of pie gives the perfect definition of “bittersweet” that makes my chest warm as I eat it.  Within one minute, the whole slice is gone.  I scoop up the last morsels from the saucer and savor the sweet syrup on my tongue.  This is the best damn slice of pie I’ve ever eaten.  I eye the other slice of pie next to me and debate whether or not I should eat it.  But I promised that I would bring something home for Sammy.
“No, I have enough to worry about at home.  Plus I work all day.  I can’t have another mouth to feed.”
I glance back over at Charlie and see that she’s smiling at Cas.  It would make sense if they were dating, but Charlie is evidently a lesbian.  I wonder what their connection is.  I slowly sip my coffee.
“No thank you.  The pie’s not for me actually.  Could I have a to-go box?”  I ask.  He nods, his cheeks bright red.  He stares at the floor as he walks behind the counter to grab a styrofoam box.  When he gets back, I stand up and pull my wallet from my jacket pocket.  He shakes his head, his face growing brighter as he hands me the box.
“Winchester!  Get out here for a sec!”  I wheel myself out from under the Jeep Wrangler I’m working on and rub my neck.  Sweat drips down my forehead, streaking a line through the grease and oil already painting my skin.
"Bye, Cas." Dean waved and climbed atop Baby. And then he was off, leaving Castiel behind breathless and shaky.
I look at the stuff Cas bought. There's a couple of plain t-shirts, a package of laundry detergent, two toothbrushes, a tube of toothpaste, some boxers, a cutting knife and cutting board set, some plastic plates and silverware, a pair of scissors, some hair and body wash, and...
"She's your sister? No wonder you couldn't leave. If she's as goddamn insistent with you as she is with me, I'm surprised you aren't at her side all the fucking time," I remark.
"Thank you, Dean. Your help means the world to me." Castiel was sincere. With only his aunts usually around him, they never let Castiel do much work besides that of which was of his own ideas.
"Can you tell me more about why I'm here?" I push again, my head thankfully starting to feel a little bit better.
"Well, uh." Dean leaned in to Castiel and grabbed hold of his hand. "I hope this is alright." Dean brushed a brief kiss to Castiel's cheek, eyes fluttering closed. He withdrew, smiling bashfully.
"Sounds good, boys." The man walks us to the kitchen, where we all sit at the wooden table. He pushes some papers across the table and Cas takes out a checkbook. He signs the documents and writes the check for $165,000. I wish I could write checks for that much wow.
Cas hums in response and I hear him stand up. The rest of the noise he makes is drowned out by the rush of water and the scrubbing of teeth. I spit out the toothpaste and go back to the bedroom.
Finally, I manage to push her off of me and onto the floor. I rush towards the bathroom, and lean over the toilet, heaving breaths into the bowl. I'm shaking and sweating and freezing all at the same time. I gag into the toilet, then feel my stomach upend itself.
"This is an old cabin my parents owned for when we wanted to escape the city for a while. We never used it though. I doubt Rachel even knows where it is, but just to be safe, we'll only stay here for a little bit. Just enough time to get you cleaned off."
"Yes, since he and I are settling here, we thought it would be good for us to find work," I explain.
"Hi," I awkwardly push out. "I hope you don't mind, but I changed my clothes." I mentally slap myself. Why the fuck am I apologizing to him?
Castiel nodded, and then looked to the sky above them. "It is getting quite late Dean. Would you like me to show you to my home, then you can head off towards Winchester?"
"Did you tell that man you were buying them for your spouse or something? 'Cause I don't think he was expecting me to be your husband."
Cas is sitting on the couch, snacking on a Twinkie from a pile on the table. He pats the spot next to him, and I stumble over and plop myself down there. He hands me a Twinkie.
Concern flashes in those beautiful eyes of his, then he turns away from me, releases the drapes and leaves the room, the door closing with a soft 'snick' sound.
We strap the mattress onto the top of the car and begin the journey back home, Cas reluctantly letting me choose the music and groaning quietly when I finally find the classic rock station.
It takes little thought to decide that, yes, I do want Cas to fuck my mouth. I lick his slit, saliva sliding down him, then take some of him into my mouth. My gag reflex unfortunately isn’t nonexistent, but I use my hands to make up for what I can’t take into my mouth. The taste of Cas is slightly musty and salty, but not all that bad, and I quickly find myself adoring the taste. I experimentally suck on him, and Cas let’s put a shout and then the sheets are off of me and I am staring at Cas’ eyes.
"Yes." I swoon. "Its Enochian, but I haven't spoken it in a long time. It's an old language, and I've never heard of anyone but people in my, admittedly large, family speaking it. They took it upon themselves to teach everyone who came into the business. I forgot those books were even in here." He chuckles fondly.
Cas rushes out of the room, and I clutch meekly at my chest. The pain seems to be building as time crawls slowly by.
Charlie returns to our table with a pudgy man, who I assume is her boss. I stand up, wiping my fingers free of salt before shaking his hand, and introduce myself.
"If you're a good boy and will come with me and do all the talking as we look at the house on that little post-it note there."
I'm a little shocked. From someone who hadn't graduated high school, going to college just to get something "normal" seemed bizarre, and I realize I still have so much I need to learn about Cas.
"How could I pay you? You took me out of my job so now I have no income, I don't have access to any of my accounts, and I'm guessing that you don't need my crappy apartment to live. What could you want from me?"
"Payment?" Castiel asked, eyebrows furrowing. "I do not have anything currently with me that I can give in thanks to you."
Jo speaks up after listening to Cas, "Oh, yeah boys. I know of a couple places. Do you know what you're looking for?"
"I know of this place called Ball Ground. I had a friend from school that lived there before moving up here. It's about two hours from Atlanta, and an hour from the nearest suburb, so it sounded perfect to me."
"I married my second wife this last week and I'm moving in with her because she has the bigger house. I'll be leaving most of the furniture here. I'm only going to be taking the couch in the living room and the mattress out of the bedroom. Feel free to get rid of the rest of the furniture, or keep it if y'all like it."
"And yet it would make me feel better if I did give something to you. You are taking time out of your schedule to converse and fish with me, despite your father's wishes. I could only hope to thank you for the company you bring."
Eventually I sit up in bed and try to stand, but sudden pain sits me back down. Cas shoots up in bed.
Castiel went through the doorway, into the cottage. He climbed up the stairway to his bedroom, and sat on the bedspread. He exhaled a breath, trying to slow the beat of his pumping heart.
Then, she moans, and I start feeling physically ill. My stomach is in knots and my eyes are wide and I can feel tears starting to fall. I squirm against her, trying my hardest to wiggle myself out of her tight hold.
Castiel looked away. "Are you ready to begin? Of course, you really do not have to help me, Dean. It was enough of a pleasure to talk to someone outside of my family for once."
When we're dones, I grab the plates and shove them into the sink, then basically jump into Castiel. He grabs right ahold of me and our lips lock. The slide of his tongue against my lips has me gasp a breath out, and he immediately takes dominance in my mouth.
Castiel watched the movement curiously. He had never bothered to pay attention to anybody he had seen before as intensely as he was watching this man. Maybe it was because of the place, he thought. Or because it was the first person he had seen since early spring, except his dear aunts.
The man rested his hands on his hips, bracing them there as he stretched his back. "What are you doing out here? You live near here?"
A slightly worried look passed over Cas' face. "You will probably be fine, maybe just your last name. I'll probably need to change mine."
"Then you know how inconvenient this is for me, man. If you tried to leave too, and couldn't, you know what I was trying to escape, don't you? And you know that if our places were switched, you would want out just as much as I do."
"I'm sorry." He looks down at his hands, nervously fidgeting with them as he talks. "But we'll need to administer another poison, so you can seem sick enough that you need to go to the hospital. And I'll offer to take you, but we won't go. I'll only give you a little bit of the poison, enough to make the symptoms arise, but not to kill you. And if the standard treatment of fresh air to treat the poison doesn't work, I'll have the antidote with me, one of the perks of being in an organized crime group." He smiles but it doesn't reach his eyes.
"I'll need to go grab the poison first. I'll give it to you in some coffee, we'll wait a bit, about 20 minutes, until you start feeling something, and then I'll go tell Rachel that you aren't feeling well. It should be smooth sailing on the plan from then on," Cas patiently explains.
The motel, thankfully, does have mini fridges in every room. It's actually a really nice motel for being in such a small town. They offer free breakfast and wifi, have semi-large rooms with functioning bathrooms, and it's all for $100 a night.
"Oh, well there's a small motel a little down the street. They should be able to get y'all settled until you find a place. I think there're couple of properties around the edge of town, though, where y'all can live. I'd go ask Jo about it though. She owns the bakery next door and knows all the town's latest happenings." Her southern drawl is pronounced in her diction, and I find it charming. Maybe Ball Ground won't be so bad? "Would you boys like to like anything to eat?"
The morning after, I manage to wake up before Cas for the first time in, well as long as I’ve known him. He’s resting peacefully, his dark hair brushed across his forehead, the rest sticking every which way like he had just been fucked. Which was true, this time.
"How about in a week? My...husband and I want to get settled into our new place as quickly as we can." I motion towards Cas.
"No, you told me enough. And if it's only a half day's walk, then Baby here can make it in way under that." He rubbed the side of the horse affectionately. "How about you show me around? I haven't been in this area of the woods in ages."
I say yes, then watch him go. I let my fingers touch my lips lightly; they're pleasantly swollen. I smile and follow after Cas.
After a couple paces into the trees, he paused and inhaled deeply. The smell of nature was something holy to him; he reveled in it every time he was in its inviting presence. Turning his face to the tops of the great trees, the sun shone brightly on him. After a moment, Castiel began to run towards the stream, eager to relax in his favorite place. The journey really wasn't as long as his aunts thought, especially at the pace he was going. Castiel did stop every so often, though, to pick flowers for his basket and to grab sweet berries to snack on.
I nod and open the Twinkie, eating it slowly so as not to aggravate my recovering body. I finish the cake, then ask, "Where are we going to go now?"
"I thought we could just wait here," Castiel offered. "I had been fishing for a dinner for Rachel, Anna, Mirabel, and me. I had been close to catching my first one, when I heard your shout."
The length of flower-rope Castiel held had considerably lengthened, and he showed his progress off to Dean.
The next day, around 10am, we arrive in Ball Ground, Georgia. The town is a small cluster of shops, advertising the best hotdogs in the area. It's slightly kitschy, but not as bad as Dollywood, Tennessee. If passed through there a couple times, and was disappointed every time.
A little bit underwhelming to me, but I can't say I'm disappointed in my groom. Even with a day on the road under his belt, he still looks real fucking hot.
Soon enough, Castiel had finished his crown. He placed it onto his head, the flowers settling just above his temple and easing into his dark hair. The light weight of the circlet pressed down on him, and given the rapid coming of noontime, Castiel had begun to get tired.
"Well apparently when she was nine, sparks flew between her and my thirteen year old brother, and now because he's dead, she's settling for me."
Castiel walked back to the clearing slowly, careful not to drop any of the flowers. Dean smiled at Castiel when he sat down next to him, skirt pillowing around Castiel and the flowers scattering in his lap.
"'Satisfactory?'" Dean shoved into Castiel lightly, teasingly. Castiel grinned. "I thought you liked me a little more than that, Cas. Guess I need to up my game."
Charlie nods. "I'll tell boss about you, he'll probably come talk to you after y'all finish eating. Enjoy your meal!"
"I'm gay, lady." Not exactly true, more bi, but I can't exactly just let myself get assaulted by some random chick.
As the man stepped closer, Castiel watched his face become more visible. He was beautiful and had very handsome features, a strong nose, full lips, and alluring eyes that shone green in the light.
Jo nods and busies herself with preparing our cake package. I tap Cas lightly on the arm. "What are we celebrating?"
I decide I enjoy working at the diner very much. Benny is a comforting presence, one who makes anybody's bd everybody feel like they belong in the diner, and Charlie's spirit keeps the whole place lively. My first day breezes by, and soon enough, it's seven and Benny is telling me to go home, that he can handle the really late dinner crowd.
I step out of the bathroom and take in the rest of the cabin. The rustic décor looks weathered despite its told lack of use, and the house only has the bare minimum of furnishings in it.
On what I assume is the next morning, I am woken up by Castiel entering my room. I sit up in bed, blinking away sleep, and release my legs from under the blanket. Castiel puts a plate with some toast and eggs on my lap, the warmth from the plate heating my stuff legs up.
At 12:30, Rachel returns, and I inwardly cringe as soon as she steps through the threshold, holding a bowl of steaming soup. She sets the bowl on the dresser before sitting on the bed, her favorite place to plop herself in.
Castiel felt so alive only being in Dean's presence. To be loved by him, Castiel assumed it would be like a new life had been breathed into him, earth-shattering in nature.
We continue walking hand-in-hand until we reach the convenience store. Walking in, I head straight towards the freezers in the back of the store, shopping basket in hand, while Cas looks for essentials. I grab boxes of frozen dinosaur chicken nuggets, Texas toasts, pasta, and fried rice and sesame chicken. In the refrigerated section, I grab a quart of milk and some carrots and cucumber. Lastly, I get some bread, peanut butter, jelly, chips, and some other snacks.
Castiel was faintly distraught in the ease he encountered around Dean. The excitement of a possible friendship with some besides his dear aunts was part of the delight he sensed around him, Castiel assumed. Lack of interaction with others close in age to him could also be accounted for as a reason.
"It's alright," he says, and his voice is so desperate that I meet his eyes. "I just wanted to say that I am so, so sorry. I have never hated her more."
"Hello, sir. My name is Dean...Smith. I'm new in town, just got here today. I was told you were hiring waitstaff?"
"Oh. I think I am beginning to like you more, though." Castiel looked down at his lap, the wreath of red stark against the beige of his skirt. He began braiding the last of the flowers together while Dean went back to fishing. "Would you tell me more about your family? Not your father, though. I cannot think of him in a high regard knowing how relentlessly he expects you to hold up to his imagined destiny for you."
We leave the restaurant, leaving a generous tip for Charlie, and go to the bakery next door, ready to talk to Jo. Cas holds the door open for me then walks right up to the counter of the shop.
What is surprising is the sensation I feel when he rubs his finger over it. At my surprised gasp and sudden sitting up, concern flashes in Cas' eyes.
"Ah, fuck," I say, right as I am shoved facedown into the hard concrete by a sudden push against my back.
I look down at my food and pick up the hotdog. Biting into it, I almost gasp at the flavor. Coming from New York to Georgia, hotdogs were not the thing on my mind that I thought would improve, but I stand corrected. Well, sit corrected.
I feel my eye twitch as I listen to her recount our initial meeting. "I don't remember that. Are you sure it was me you were talking to? And not my brother? We didn't really look alike when we were teenagers, but people still got us confused."
I lock eyes with Cas and say, "I have obtained a career, and what have you been doing all this time? That's right, sitting in awe at my awesomeness."
