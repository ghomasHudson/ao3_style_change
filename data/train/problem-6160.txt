“Uh, this is Peter, my intern. I invited him along for educational reasons, you see,” he says loud enough for other people to hear. Peter sags a bit in relief after that, shaking Otto’s hand with a smile that accentuates he’s less uncomfortable now.
“So, Peter got bitten by something?” May asks. “How is that possible? Shouldn’t he be immune to things like these by now?”
“Jesus, have they been feeding you at all?” Peter asks, a bit shocked at the skinny appearance of the person that was once his best friend. Harry’s permanent grin goes back up, bringing wrinkles in his scarred cheeks. He looks truly crazy, with that distant look in his eyes.
“A lady gave me money again. I always bring it here whenever that happens,” he admits. “They can use it a lot more than I can.”
“No he isn’t, I’m sorry,” Pepper says. Tony squeezes his eyes shut to hold back a few tears. He keeps on forgetting that Steve isn’t in New York. Why can’t he just remember?
If Peter would just introduce himself as Tony’s son from another universe, this Tony would look him up. Peter would be giving him hope that he’s not alone, make him happy that he has an heir – which Peter knows was an issue for Tony before he knew about Peter being his son. And when this Tony will then find out that his son is dead, that he died before he even got to meet him… Peter can not do that to this Tony.
Exactly then, somebody puts his hand on Peter’s shoulder. That causes a reaction inside the boy, who ducks down while grabbing the person by the wrist, turning it around in a hold that must be painful. When he turns around to look the person in his face, he quickly comes to see that it’s one of the other interns with a pained look in his face.
“Of course I’m here, Dad. Where-else would I go?” he asks. Then he turns back at Dr. Palmer, who is looking at him with wide eyes. “I’m sorry for interrupting you.”
Maybe Mr. Stark should just let him fall; let him know the fate that befell Gwen. He would deserve it, after all. He made
Oh, shit, right, the man still didn’t know Tony was Peter’s father. “Uh, just because, his internship, you know…” she tried saving herself. Luckily Steve was tired enough to just go with her flow.
Her phone buzzed. A text from Peter. Yaël tried to read the text, but it took her a little while as the letters started dancing around.
“I have to go help them out.” He said to Yaël, already turning around. Yaël nodded, of course he had to… he was
to be there as well. But no matter how many funerals he’s been to, it seems like nobody ever really gets used to it.
After the commotion around Steve has died down, the door opens up again. This time, Peter recognizes the Winter Soldier, who pretty much looks like crap. His hair is pulled together messily, his arm grabbed by Wanda, who talks to him in a hushed voice. The man tries to ignore the fact that everybody’s looking at him. Peter feels sorry for him. When he feels Tony tense up next to him, he puts a hand on his shoulder to calm him down. Tony quickly clears his throat.
The way it was obvious for Tony that the kid didn’t want to fight Steve. Because Peter wouldn’t want to do it, yet he still did it because Tony asked…
Peter has his eyes closed – when did he close them? He’s lying on some sort of mattress with a too-heavy duvet lying on top of him. His head is giving him a lot of grief, and even pressing the palm of his hands against his brow doesn’t help him.
“Yeah, I- uh… how did you know?” he returns. He’s pretty sure they couldn’t have told him already, right? But T’Challa just takes out his phone and hands it to Steve, who gets to see an article published online.
“We don’t need to bring that up. Bygones and all,” the engineer mutters back. Peter frowns, taken aback by the answer. Of course, he knows Tony Stark well enough now to know that the man avoids conversations like these like it’s an infectious disease.
“Well how do you want to do this, then? Wanna get on my back? Or should I hold you in an embrace like Iron Man does with Cap?” he jokes along, and Hawkeye, too, starts laughing. It’s a stupid comment, though, because Iron Man doesn’t hold Cap any differently than he would with anybody else. It’s just because he’s just seen it happen a few minutes ago that he brings it up.
“It’s Been a Long, Long Time, if you have that one,” Steve said. It still felt weird speaking to the air and having some British AI that always seemed ever so slightly judgmental respond, but he was getting used to it.
“Looks like,” Steve responded noncommittally.  He took a deep breath, as if bracing himself, then looked over at Tony again, or, rather, at the apparently fascinating refrigerator ice dispenser just behind Tony’s shoulder.  “I know there were…things…I should have told you.  I’m not proud of how I handled everything.  But, you didn’t have to,” he stopped, blinking and looking down and away again, and it nearly broke Tony to see that.  “You didn’t have to pretend, Tony.  You didn’t have to---I didn’t need to be coddled.  I was fine.  I was fine, and this…this thing with you…I can’t do this.  I told you that.  But then you---why couldn’t you just let it go?” Steve demanded, voice rising with each word until he was nearly shouting, but under it all, under the anger and the pain, Tony could hear the plea in his words.
A stargazer lily sat cradled in the palm of the left gauntlet, its dark pink petals spread wide over the repulsor as it stretched upwards, towards the sky.
Steve remembered his mom, how she always tried to have everything just perfect, so Joseph wouldn’t get mad.  Dinner on the table at exactly six.  The plates turned so the flowers were all facing the right direction.  Salt and pepper shakers by Joseph’s water.  Tap water, room temperature.  Everything just so.  Except it was never enough, of course, and eventually, something would set him off, some perceived slight or failing, and… and Steve didn’t really want to think any more about that.
Guilt knifed through Steve.  Of course.  Of course.  He should have thought--he had all this time here at the room, and he could have changed into his own clothes, but it hadn’t occurred to him how it would make Brock feel.  He’d been wallowing in whatever was going on in his own head and not even thinking about how this was affecting his boyfriend.
“Fuck if I know,” Tony breathed out, running a hand up and down his face as he twisted back and forth on his heels, suddenly too full of some kind of energy that wanted out.
A firm pressure on the small of his back cut through the cacophony in Steve’s mind.  Everything went cold for a moment.  Like the way the water feels when you first break the surface, so cold, you forget how to move, Steve thought, then drew in a shuddering breath that burned his throat and lungs and followed the pressure forward, leaning down until his chest met the bed.
Conference Room Steve was sitting next to Tony, rubbing his hand up and down the inside of Tony’s thigh, where he held Tony’s knee captured on his lap.  The position kept Tony’s legs spread wide.  Steve was fairly sure that was the whole point.  His skinny counterpart pulled his mouth off Tony’s cock, let go of Tony’s balls and trailed a finger down the crease of his ass, catching some of the come leaking out of him and circling the puffy, red rim of his hole until it glistened.  Steve watched the motion as if enthralled.  He couldn’t seem to pull his gaze away.  He kept telling himself he should, but he just watched the slow, hypnotic turn of the small finger around Tony’s hole until it suddenly disappeared inside to the knuckle, making Tony’s hips judder and his body quake with a low, shuddering moan.
The water prickled against his skin, stinging slightly with the force and heat of it.  He leaned in, letting his forehead rest against the cool tiles, bracing his good hand against the wall beside him, letting the water wrap its warmth around him.  He still felt cold inside, couldn’t quite shake it off, despite the heat.  He adjusted the water temperature slightly, making it even hotter.  His mind was filled with smoke and explosions, a sudden, shooting pain and then soft eyes, a warm, determined grip, the slam of a door.  It all rolled around in his head, one after the other, a muddled jumble of pain and comfort and some vague idea that slipped through his fingers every time he tried to grab onto it.  He’d wanted Tony’s presence tonight, no sense in denying that.  Tony was his friend, and certainly, if he’d asked…if he’d said…well, Tony would have stayed, of course.  That’s what friends did.  And Tony would understand not wanting to be alone.  Wanting someone to be near, just to reach out and touch something real and solid and warm
“Always so warm,” Tony repeated, and then Steve felt a streak of cold down the center of his chest.  He sucked in a sharp breath. Oh. “So warm everywhere.” The line of cold dipped lower, over his stomach, to his belly button where it pooled for a moment.
Tony’s birthday, and he wanted him to have a good time, or maybe because Steve was too stubborn for his own good, who knew?  Didn’t really matter.  Steve was trying to control the switch, and that was something.
“Please.  James, please.  I’m asking.  For me, yeah, but for him, too.  If you think I’m wrong about how he feels, then walk out.  But, if you think we have a chance—I’m asking,” Tony pleaded.
“Sometimes I recite the Pledge of Allegiance for dirty talk,” Tony said.  Steve rolled his eyes and buried his face into the curve of Tony’s neck.   “He salutes, but probably not how you thi—“
“I have no idea,” Tony shrugged, one eyebrow raising as if he thought Steve might furnish some answer.
“I didn’t mean it like—I just—I would’ve—I would’ve helped, okay?  ‘S all I’m saying. I would’ve helped.  I think.  Probably.  If you could’ve gotten past Pepper’s gatekeeping, gold digger radar.  I mean, she’d take one look at you and imagine picking up your dry cleaning, which, to be fair, isn’t without some precedent, so,” Tony acknowledged, dancing his head back and forth and rolling his eyes.  “I’m just—I’m saying, I helped them.  The others.  Their—the families.  I helped them.”
,” Anthony whispered across Steve’s skin as he spread his hand over Steve’s chest, the words echoing in Steve’s head with drumbeat.  “
Happy hurried to shoo the tourists away and held the door open for Steve and Tony.  Steve held out his hand, and Tony took it as he crawled out, then didn’t let go because that was what couples did. He felt Steve give his hand a squeeze, and he looked up and caught Steve’s eye.  Steve leaned his head down and sort of nudged at Tony’s cheek.  Not quite a kiss, but somehow even more intimate than any kiss Tony had ever experienced.
“Now, bend over until your chest touches the bed.  Head to the side, there you go,” Tony said as Steve lowered his chest down.
“You should put that in the brochure,” Tony muttered, swiping a hand over his face and ending up leaving his hair haphazard curls, sticking up at all angles.
“You’re really going to make me say all this to the water, huh?” Steve called out, jerking his chin up as he looked out over the waves.  “You know, as often as Bucky said I liked the sound of my own voice, I gotta say, I’m getting kind of tired of talking to myself here, Shellhead.”
“Let’s see…” Tony began, adjusting the scope.  “That’s…Virgo.  A bit there, see?” Tony said, shifting over so Steve could lean forward and look though the eyepiece.  “Supposed to look like a woman lying down.  I don’t know. I think the Greeks were drunk or something.  There are over three thousand galaxies just east of her left arm, though.  Here, let me just—“ Tony said, readjusting the scope just a bit so the spiral galaxy near the top of the Virgo Cluster came into view.  “So, kinda cool, I guess.”
Coulson escorted them through the lobby, giving Tony a bit of history on SHIELD as they went.  He pointed to a large framed portrait of a beautiful brunette in a deep olive green military uniform that stood at one end of the main lobby next to a gold plaque.
“I was drinking plenty of fluids.  Ask Rhodey. Wait. Nevermind. Don’t ask Rhodey about that,” Tony amended.  “I’m sorry you had to cut your mission short.  Any chance it was one of those completely boring, everyday kind of routine missions that you go on just for kicks and free booze?”
A sheet of thick plastic draped over the various pieces of hardware.  The fluorescent lights made the scene look almost eerie, some kind of modern-day equivalent of covering the mirrors lest the dead become trapped.  He walked over and lifted up the sheet the veiled his workstation, slinging the edge off to one side.  Dead and trapped in a mirror, he thought.  Watching your loved ones go through their lives, missing you, mourning you, but you couldn’t reach them.  He had the sudden urge to fling the plastic back down, but didn’t.  Instead, his eyes caught on a glint of bright, silver metal, still shiny after all these years.  Tony picked up the tin can that hung from a string by the workstation and held the open end to his mouth like a microphone.
“Don’t talk about him like that,” Steve snapped. He frowned, then forced his hand to release the seat.  Rumlow wasn’t, of course, talking about anyone in particular.  Just making conversation.  Locker room talk. That was what they called it these days, apparently, as if the location made it acceptable.  Like it could be said here, between Alphas, and left here, never making its way outside.
Getting your ass kicked at KISS mini-golf was quite the humbling experience, Tony decided as he waited for Steve to collect his trophy slushie for scoring a hole-in-one down Gene Simmons’ tongue.  Words that Tony wanted to never, ever think again.
“I’m not toasting that,” Rhodes said, shaking his head and pulling a disgusted look. “BARF, Tony?  Seriously?”
“I’m literally standing right here.  You know I can hear you, right?” Rhodes cut in, stepping forward as Tony grinned.
“No, Tony. No. They’re not. Remember?,” Steve huffed, pulling Tony closer so he could tug the amulet out from under Tony’s tunic. “Tony is my people. Tony is my home,” Steve told him. “Right here, Tony. This is where I belong. Do you understand?”
…Steve’s body bucked wildly as he came into his hand, quickly trying to catch what he could before he made a mess on his bed that meant he’d have to wash the sheets himself instead of leaving it to the cleaning crew.  Grabbing Kleenex to clean up the mess as best he could, Steve stepped to the bathroom to clean up and then sat on the edge of the bed, hands braced against the mattress.
He pushed a third slick finger in, heard Tony’s groan that sounded almost petulantly disappointed, then pulled his hand away and grabbed the jar, adding more of the jellied oil to his hands, then spreading it again over himself. Just that touch was enough to send another spurt of liquid from the tip into his hand as he rubbed.  He stared at it a moment, then used that, too, looking up to see Tony’s wide eyes staring at him with a heated gaze that burned through Steve’s body, making a sweat break out over his flushed skin.
“Breathe,” Tony ordered gently, and Steve realized by the cold tightness in his chest that he had forgotten to do that.  He drew in a breath, took in too much air with it, but swallowed it down with a shudder.
Surgical suite.  Surgical.  Surgery.  That had been on the sign on the wall opposite the elevator, just below Laboratory and above Radiology, with an arrow helpfully pointing to the right.  Small, color coded arrow-shaped signs pointed him forward like breadcrumbs.  People in white coats or SHIELD uniforms turned to look at him as he took off down the hall.  Someone shouted.  He almost crashed into a nurse pushing a cart.  Crash cart, his mind supplied, and that was enough to send him into a sprint.  A hand grabbed for his arm, but he was used to dodging, and they got a fingertip on the sleeve of his shirt for their efforts.
"Which would all be well and good, maybe of interest to the IRS, but not exactly under our purview," Fury continued, "except AIM has been funneling tech and money to a terrorist organization known as Hydra. Hydra has been funding and supplying wars and things we don’t call war all over the world since sometime just after the First World War.  We sent Agent Romanov in to infiltrate the club, see what she could find out about our players. Agent Barton volunteered.”
“Well, anyway.  Just thought you should know.  Might take a bit longer than you were hoping, if he gets a lawyer involved,” Pepper said, munching steadily on the bag of fries.  “Here,” she said, tossing him a cheeseburger wrapped in greased-stained wax paper.  “Eat something.”
“Would you at least concede that if the situation were reversed, if it was me down at the bottom of the pit, that you wouldn’t be the first to jump in?” Tony pressed.
“Yeah, I’ll bet he’s just crying into his billions,” Brock shot back. Steve could hear the sneer in his voice, but chose to ignore it.
“Nah.  I can handle Ross,” Tony assured him.  He blinked at his phone, then lowered it and looked over at Steve.  “Whatever happens, we’ll figure it out, okay?  Wanna know how?” Tony asked, a small smile playing over his lips.
“It’s like you don’t even know me,” Steve said with a lopsided attempt at a smile that fell flat.  Sam huffed out a short, caustic laugh, then scrubbed a hand over his face.  He nodded at Steve again, firmer this time, and turned back to the door.
“I do, Sir,” JARVIS replied, the AI’s simulated voice going quiet and soft in Tony’s ear.  “It looks very good.”
“Sorry.  I know, I’ve been gone—the mission, it…well, missions really.  Took a while,” Steve replied with a air of uneasiness, shifting a bit where he stood clutching the bag of food.
It dawned on him with a sort of slow-moving humiliation burning through him that the man wasn’t going to signal him.  That even though the man clearly was in need and Anto was the only Omega available, he still didn’t want Anto. He would rather deny himself than take Anto.  Even a Clan Alpha, if his need was great enough and there wasn’t anyone else, would use Anto if he had to, but the man must find him so repulsive that he would prefer to suffer through his need than give his signal.  Big, ugly, stupid, Anto’s head chanted to him. Even a man of the Others didn’t want him, even when he was the only Omega available. The man would rather ignore his need than take Anto. There was clearly something wrong with him.  He had known it his whole life, but to have it made so plain for him…he must be truly revolting, not just to Clan, but to anyone.
“You borrowed five thousand dollars from Howard. Five thousand. And you...you bought...” Tony broke off, trying to see the scene again, without the emotional meltdown overlay. “You bought a TV. DVD player. X-Box. Microwave. And...towels? Were there towels?”
The alien hummed again, then moved down to the end of the table again and crawled up inside, laying next to Tony.  Tony turned his head to look at him, caught again by the vivid blue eyes that watched him so carefully. “You’re dgoing to do the whole mind meldy thing again, aren’t y--oh, there we go,” Tony sighed as the alien leaned his head forward until their foreheads touched.
“I—” Steve started, then broke off.  He had no idea what to say.  He opened his mouth again, only to close it, shaking his head, a feeling of dismay settling heavily in his stomach.  He could feel his legs tremble where he knelt.  The pain was there again, pressing at the edges of his mind in dull, throbbing pulses. “Please,” he begged again, beseechingly this time.  He needed something. He had no idea what.  But, he trusted that Tony would know, and this was part of it, he knew, giving that over to Tony. “Please,” he said yet again, shaking his head, then tipping his chin to look up at Tony.  “Please.”  His voice was steady.
“You might have to throw a car or something to prove it to him,” Tony added, glancing back up at Steve and pursing his lips like he was considering the idea.  “I’m just saying.”
“Vibration-absorbing-star-metal, huh?” Tony repeated. “Yeah, that name’s going to need some work.  You really think this will work?” he asked, arching an eyebrow up at the alien, who nodded. “Wish I had JARVIS around to confirm.  Got any more of it around here?”
The creature gave him a solemn nod, keeping its strangely warm gaze locked on Steve while he talked.  He didn’t know why he was talking so much. It was like the words had all been stored up inside or something.  It didn’t make sense. But, he hadn’t been lying. Shellhead was easy to talk to. Or maybe Steve just needed to talk.  He wasn’t sure. It probably didn’t really make much difference.
A car door slammed, and Tony jumped, then laughed, low and breathy, warmth flooding his belly.    Steve was here.  Steve would take care of him.  He might laugh, true.  But, it would be one of those what-have-you-done-now kind of laughs, filled with fondness and a gentle sort of adoration that Tony didn’t always understand.  Tony would tell him about how hard it was getting the garters on and how he thought his left shoulder might be a few centimeters shorter than his left or else this damn strap—ugh, he mentally ground out, pulling it back into place—was creating its own gravity, and they would curl up on the sofa and laugh about it, with Tony’s head buried in Steve’s chest so he didn’t have to look at him while he talked. Maybe they would watch one of those old movies. The ones with Hepburn and Tracy where they fell in love in the middle of arguing with each other.  They had shown half a reel of Keeper of the Flame on the side of a tent somewhere in northern Italy, Steve once told him.   They could watch that one, maybe, or something lighter, one of the screwball comedies.
Steve nodded once, jerkily, but that seemed to satisfy Cam as far as a response went.  Luckily, the boy was largely content with his own conversation.
“How come little old ladies and hot billionaires never try to pick me up, huh?” Brock asked around a laugh as Steve followed him out of the casino, having related Millie’s attempt at matchmaking.  “Must be the whole All-American thing you got going. Apple pie. Baseball. Fireworks.  All that white-picket-fence shit. Not exactly what I would’ve thought would be Stark’s type, gotta admit.”
“Steve…” Tony began, then broke off and looked down at their hands.  He could see the glint of dark gray metal around his finger.  The heartline, he thought.
“Well,” Steve said after Tony finished some point related to dredging that Steve had stopped following.  “I admit, building your own beach is pretty amazing.  I, however, am going to construct the most badass sandcastle, excuse me,” Steve amended.  “Sand fortification, that you have ever seen.  Prepare to be impressed.”
“He stays,” Steve said in a puff of air that whited the oxygen mask.  “Don’ touch ‘im.” Tony swallowed and looked around the room with what he hoped was a ‘So there’ look while the heartrate monitor beeped its own warning.
“All of you. Leave us,” Tony ordered.  It wasn’t a suggestion.  Steve recognized the tone of command, couldn’t help but respond to it, especially with the feel of movement, speed, muscle, bone, blood, all of that still pumping hard through his veins. “I wish to speak with our visitor.”
“My hands are meant for a sword and shield,” Steve muttered, sitting back against the cushion and looked out at the soldiers and riders in their armor, with their weapons and banners and horses built to charge and kick.
“So,” Tony began, clapping his hands together and snapping his fingers, then tapping at the center of his chest in his own version of a nervous tell.
The only way to fix any of it was to undo it with the combined power of the stones.  That was one thing Bruce and Shuri agreed on. For Thanos to do what he did in a single snap of his fingers, he needed all of the stones.
“Well…” she stretched out the word, “I’ve been concerned for awhile now about the power dynamics here,” she answered.
“Three times. Okay,” Steve nodded, sucking in a sharp breath. He was really doing this. Somehow, the whole…
Tony reached up with his other hand and rubbed lightly over Steve’s nipple, the one that wasn’t currently being pulled into a line of throbbing, red flesh, and played with the neglected peak. “They are all out there, wondering what I’m doing with you, I’d wager.” Steve blinked and tried to swallow, a wave of humiliation turning his insides molten. “Yes, yes,” Tony continued, his voice low and teasing. “They know you must be punished, of course. Such a slight cannot be ignored. The Ul is certainly thinking about it. He suggested I bring you out and have you beaten before them all. I think he would have liked that very much. And Ross, too, the rotten bastard,” he growled, pushing his fingers deep.
Steve could do whatever he wanted, and Tony probably wouldn’t even know.  If he could just touch himself, just once, just a little, maybe it would relieve the excruciating throbbing in his cock.  Even if Tony finally paid enough attention to him to notice, it might be worth it. Steve didn’t mind Tony’s punishments. Maybe Tony would let him kneel beneath the desk and take Tony’s cock in his mouth while Tony worked.  Steve’s own mouth watered at the thought. He brought one hand up and dipped two fingers between his lips. It wasn’t the same as Tony’s cock on his tongue, but he liked the weight of it. The sense of his mouth being almost too full, that lack of air was just a shift in movement away.
After shutting down his computer, Tony locked up the garage and headed back into the cabin and to his room.  He could hear light movements from Steve’s room, where Steve was probably getting dressed, which Tony wasn’t going to think about.
Not that he could blame Steve for responding when an Omega practically jumps him.  Who wouldn’t at least kiss back, right?  For a minute, anyway.  Before Steve stopped.  Right.  Because Steve had stopped.  That was the part Tony’s mind hadn’t wanted to remember, in the hazy midst of replaying over and over again the way Steve’s mouth felt, the touch of his hands, the way his eyes had roamed over Tony like a caress.  At least, that was how it had felt to Tony.  How much of that had he projected onto Steve?
“At least drink some more water,” Steve said.  Tony hummed agreeably, while Steve went to fill a glass from the kitchen tap.  He brought it back and held it to Tony’s lips while he drank, until Tony smacked his lips in satisfaction and pushed Steve’s hands away.
“Put your hands on the mirror,” Tony ordered, voice sounding like the scrape of nails on a blackboard, bringing Steve’s gaze to the sound of it.   Steve stared stupidly at him for a moment, trying to make the words make sense.  “Steve,” Tony said softly, running a hand through Steve’s hair and down his cheek, mimicking the motion he’d used earlier, gentler, but just as insistent.  “Put your hands on the mirror.  I’m going to fuck you against it, and then I’m going to take you to bed and—and—if you stay,” Tony stopped, looking down and away from where Steve knelt on shaking limbs.  Don’t say it, Steve thought, but the words to stop him wouldn’t come out. What could he say?  There was nothing to say. He’d already fallen, and he couldn’t stop until he hit bottom.  “If you stay, I’ll pay double,” Tony offered, dragging his gaze back to Steve’s. There was such desperate hope battling with the expectation of disappointment, something Steve knew all too well lately, that Steve didn’t need a mirror to see himself.
“My mom said I should be brave.  When I left.  That’s what she said,” Cam told him, still staring down at the crumb of bread between his fingers.  “But, I’m not.  Soldiers, people like you, they’re brave.  I’m just—I’m what I am.”
No one would answer his questions, of course, either because they didn’t know or had been told not to tell him, since Howard seemed to want to play at fucking Wadsworth and cloak the whole thing in mystery.  Tony wasn’t sure if Howard was just being a RuPaul-sized drama queen about it or if Rogers wanted Tony kept in the dark.  Maybe there was some reason they didn’t want to tell Tony anything.  Like…Rogers’ last Omega had been found dumped in a shallow ditch with his head shaved and fingernails pulled out.
“No.” Peter doesn’t hesitate. Nobody needs to know anything about that aspect of his personal life. He would rather have people not finding out about MJ. “There’s nobody.”
Peter has been silent the entire time, mostly enjoying the addition in the house for a moment. Even Vision is at the table, having finished his plate in record time. Apparently, the guy loves food, despite never having eaten before!
“Dad, I’ll do the drinks, okay?” Peter suggests, taking the bottle from the table. Tony nods. With a little brush, they clean up the shards. Harry, in the meantime, decides to go talking with Wanda and Vision for a while. If they mistrusted Harry at first, at least now they’re not showing it anymore. Though Harry might be getting a few moments where he’s just staring ahead, deep in thought, he’s done nothing more than prove that he’s back to his old self.
“He’s… eccentric to say the least,” he answers, honestly. No-one can ever really predict what Mr. Stark’s next move is, always surprising everybody. “I mean, when I had my interview for the internship he just told me to fix his gauntlet.”
“Don’t be an ass, okay?” she asks him. There’s a smirk on Tony’s lips, adding to the mask he’s put up the moment he put on his sunglasses. Peter looks down at his own sunglasses and wonders if that’s what they’re expecting of him, too. MJ didn’t get glasses, did she?
Seeing Cap, completely filthy from dirt where his mask hasn’t been, Tony finds his breath catching. He doesn’t know why his impulses brought him here. Hadn’t he just told himself days earlier that he wouldn’t think too much into whatever is happening between him and Steve? How is it that, now he’s right here again, those ideas have flown out the window without a single warning?
“You’re welcome!” Happy returns. Peter smiles. Thinking back of how much Happy never really used to speak to him a few weeks back, it now seems like they’ve really grown on each other. It’s good, he’s glad.
“Sakaar,” she said. “You dweebs accidentally took me with you during my holiday in Norway.” Thor chuckled with a grin and patted her shoulder roughly, though this time softer than before.
A large bandage is put on. It’s a bit bloodied, but it seems dry for now. When he touches it, he doesn’t feel pain but mostly just uneasiness.
“That’s true,” the man says. Then he starts looking for things on the computer, the keyboard not making any sounds at all. Peter leans forward a little bit and sees that the keyboard itself is holographic. Damn, that Stark never ceases to amaze him. “Well, if you want, he has a free slot on next Sunday about four. What exactly is the appointment for?”
“You never indicated which floor we need to go to,” he reveals. Johnny bites on his lip while he tries to hold in a laugh.
“How are you holding up, Tony?” Steve asks quietly, respecting the distance between them. Tony just shrugs.
“That’s not the point,” Clint says. Tony feels a bit confused here, why does Clint care so much all of the sudden? He thought the guy could barely stand him! “The fact remains that you’ve injected yourself with something that might as well have been lethal to the human body. The fact that you’re still alive is actually a miracle.”
“What’s the problem? She needed help with the test, she was even a little sad that you didn’t invite her, though of course she would never admit that,” Harry counters. Of course, he doesn’t see the problem, he’s completely head over heels for this girl!
spent a lot of time with the kid in the past few weeks. Even he knows that the intelligence Peter is showing is much more than what his mother had. But Tony never dared to hope, because he knows he’s always been careful about these sorts of things.
“Dude, you plannin’ on getting drunk?” Johnny asks all of the sudden. Peter turns to him, pulled out of his focus on the phone. It’s a good phone, too, with a nice screen. Probably a bit too expensive than what he would normally go for. It’s also rather large, and a miracle that it even fits in his pants.
“A dress?” she said dryly, before remembering that she shouldn’t be her usual dry self here. “Don’t you like it?” she threw him a sweet smile while blinking ‘flirtatious’. The man cocked his eyebrow, but Yaël saw twinkles of joy in his brown eyes. Was it working?
Tony drops the cube down on the table after finishing it twice. It’s not even noon yet, so he’s kind of proud of himself that he managed to be here. In fact, he’s missed only a few meetings since Steve. The board should be thanking
It takes him a few minutes to reach it. The firemen are already on the scene, desperately trying to put down the flames. There’s a large crowd of people surrounded around the perimeter that had been build up. Police agents are trying to hold people back as they scream for their loved ones that are still stuck in the building.
“So how is it going to go? Are you going to join us?” he asks. Steve startles at Peter’s sudden question, eyes open wide.
Everybody takes a moment to think about that. Bruce has his floor under the penthouse. The top three floors are actually smaller than the ones underneath, which is why Tony, Bruce and Nat (and Bucky) each get their own. From then on out, it’s two per floor. And Peter would just imagine Wanda would rather share with Yaël (she’s obviously too young to be rooming with Vision).
“I, uh- I don’t really like horrors,” he admits in embarrassment. He could just drop dead after this. Instead of warning her that he’s in this sort-of-thing with MJ he just uses the ‘I’m scared of horror-‘ card? That’s lame, to say the least.
He catches a glimpse of Adrian Toomes somewhere on his left. He frowns the moment he sees him sitting there. There’s nobody else, which is good. As long as nobody thinks about sitting with him, he can do this as discreetly as possible.
“No problem,” he said while scrolling “I know somebody who can.” Wade almost dropped his phone when it suddenly started ringing. “Well, what a 'coincidence',” he mumbled when he saw the name on the screen. “Yo, mister X, I just wanted to call you, you’re on speaker!”
After what must be minutes, Peter starts to pull back, quickly rubbing away a tear and trying not to show too much that he’s been crying. It’s a lost cause, of course, but that doesn’t mean that he won’t try it. Mr. Stark takes a step back as well, giving Peter a long look before turning his head away.
“Hmmmmnoooo, ten more minutes,” he grumbles. He hears somebody chuckle behind him. Then there’s a hand on his side and a pair of lips against his neck. “Steeeeeeeve.”
“Dr. Strange, are you alright?” Peter asks. The guy groans, looking bloody and beaten. Peter quickly runs up to him to check if he’s not too hurt. If so, he should probably carry him to a hospital or so.
But the seconds kept on ticking, and eventually, Gwen’s web was cut in two, causing for her to fall. Peter once more shot out for her, but he was too late. Even though his web caught her, she was too low. Her head still smacked against the ground, giving a loud cracking-noise that Peter could hear from even above.
“I would be insulted from your lack of knowledge, but it’s been my mission to stay in the shadows for a while now,” the girl says, scraping one gloved hand over the stone wall next to her. Her metal nails make a horrible sound in the process, causing for Peter to put his hands against his ears as he flinches.
Once the rain starts pouring, they decide it’s time to wrap it up again. Saying their goodbyes to everybody, Peter and MJ leave the shelter and head back into the streets of New York. With their arms linked together and the drops of rain pouring down on them, they look into the windows of all the closed stores on the street. Halloween hasn’t passed yet, so at least there aren’t Christmas-stuff already hanging out.
“Mr. Stark would never do that,” Vision counters, a bit insulted at the idea. Wanda assures him that she didn’t mean it by putting a hand on his arm. Paul and Betty ask for a quick update on who exactly that was. Peter gives them the short version of the story.
With each bird that Peter sees flying in the air, his mind immediately warns him that the Goblin has returned. As it turns out, having a cold means that his senses are all messed up, feeling danger whenever there isn’t any. Another cold chill passes him by, but nothing happens.
The shock stopped right in time for her to dodge the thing, only making a cut in her arm instead of stabbing her heart.
By the time he’s grabbed her hands to stop her, her lips are already pressed against his. She kisses him with heat, some sort of desire he can’t really understand. They barely know each other, and Peter’s never been one to just hook up with strangers unlike some of his peers (Johnny). Still, there’s a thrill going through him. His heart speeds up, feeling as if it’s about to jump out of his chest. Nothing inside of him tells him to pull away.
“It wasn’t even yours to begin with, now come, astronaut.” The woman turned around and walked out the door with straight back, taking big steps. Yaël quickly jumped off her chair and almost tripped in the hurry, ignoring the fact that she had already went through some kind of breakdown after pushing her body too far with too much training and way too little food to fuel herself not that long ago.
Here we have an example of how one shouldn't mess with Steve Rogers' unofficial son. At first I thought it would be a bit out of character, but then I thought; just imagine how Steve would react if anybody hurt his kid, and I thought of this exact situation, so I decided to keep it like this! It's a short one, but I wanted to bring it out there as well!
“Yeah, I’m probably going to regret this one day. FRIDAY, you’re free from my irresistible charm now.”
Tony stiffens a bit. He did say that, but he didn’t really mean it. Yeah, sure, he had been angry! Nobody can hold it against him, right?
“I thought I saw Pepper?” he asks in confusion. Peter points behind him, to the door that leads to the hallway.
Tony huffs out a breath. Yeah, that’s just putting it mildly. There’s so much he wants to tell her right now.
“So do I, but we have no choice. Surtur destroys Asgard, he destroys Hela, so that our people may live” Yaël just listened, not being able to be a part of their conversation. She was thankful that Thor wasn’t treating her like she was going to die or something, otherwise she’d think more about the pain than that she was doing right then. She didn’t want to get treated weirdly, say her goodbyes.
Bionic Punch: Tony meets a certain agent who got involved with the trouble in Midland Circle, and he decides to help her out.
“No, he isn’t,” Yaël replied while looking at the trunk of the nearby trees “Raido is not even his real name, but I call him that because of his obsession with horses. Since he was a little boy, he seemed to have a connection with them. He has a lot of respect and patience with horses so he joined the cavalry as soon as he grew up. Raido is not only a rune, it also stands for horseback riding, or just riding. It stands for a journey, well, at least it does here at Helvegen,” Yaël smiled when she finally found the right trees: two trees standing perfectly next to each other. A horse was carved into both of their trunks. “His real name is Rozenrød.”
Eventually, there’s Johnny, who is flaming again. He has his back facing the others, still holding his hands up as if he’s holding back the fire. Peter stares at him for a few seconds before he finally relaxes.
“Just leave him be for now. We should get you home, son,” Steve tells him. Peter’s heart aches a bit at hearing that, suddenly feeling like he doesn’t deserve to be called ‘son’ by Steve. Without thinking about it, he wraps his arms around Steve’s torso, pulling him into a strong, needy hug. Tears appear in his eyes again, rolling down his cheeks while the sobs leave his mouth. Steve, meanwhile, stays quiet, silently rubbing Peter’s shoulders. Though the gesture is supposed to be comforting, Peter still feels pretty much like crap.
“Hi, Yaël? Fancy a game of chess?” X gave her such a heart attack by suddenly rolling into the kitchen, she dropped Scott’s coffee. The cup shattered, and the coffee spilled everywhere.
“I’m mostly curious to see how you’ll drink it,” she jokes. Peter rolls his eyes, though she can’t exactly see that.
As soon as Steve let go again, he pulled the door behind him shut and looked at her confusedly. “How did you even survive?”
“We know that, Nat,” Sam defends himself. Right after that, the door opens, revealing Steve to walk inside. He looks sweaty, like he’s just been in the gym for the past two hours or so. He heads to the fridge and takes out a bottle of water. After that, he turns to look at the three on the couch.
Tony snorts, already imagining this girl sitting at her desk, playing with her hair as she chews her gum and talks on for hours in that annoyingly nasally voice.
“That’s so cool,” Peter interrupts. When Strange gives him an annoyed look, he apologizes and puts his hands in his lap.
“Oh, hi Mr. Stark! I just- I’m not-“ Peter starts, but he can’t find his words. He jumps back to his feet and starts walking away from the edge. “I was just getting some air, is all.”
“Instead of talking about me, I would like to know more about you,” she says with a knowing look on her face.
Maybe not, he figures. If anything, Peter is afraid that he’ll make it worse, instead. Better to keep it quiet.
It’s Sharon Carter, the grand-niece, who comes to them first. Not really knowing anything about Peter, she gives him a short nod before grabbing Tony and pulling him into a strong hug. Tony, who has been composed for the entire ceremony, ends up letting out a few tears against her shoulder as the emotions suddenly get the better of him.
The two kids nod, Andrew still with the top of his hand rubbing over his face. Peter passes a hand through his hair to comfort him a bit. After that, he gets to work. He guides Toby at the window, helps him over it. Then with the web stuck to the kid’s arms, Peter slowly but surely lowers him down until he’s on the ground. In the background, he can see a woman shout in relief. She, while carrying another baby in her arms, starts making her way to the boy.
Charles had noticed as soon as she came in, that Yaël wasn’t good at doing nothing. So he made sure she had something to do. Like cleaning or washing, which was kind of funny, because whenever she was stressing out she used to do those things too in her apartment. Charles had asked her if she didn’t feel like he was denigrating her with those tasks, but she felt comfortable doing it, it made her relax.
The call has lasted two hours before they finally say goodbye and hang up. Peter feels great, after that long conversation. It feels like he needed it, though he’s pretty sure he still had a whole lot more to tell the guy before he hung up the phone.
“You recognize her, don’t you? She’s been in SHIELD’s custody for a while before. How she got on the ship is unclear since last we knew she was still on Earth.”
“How did you-?” he starts to ask, but he can’t seem to finish. That’s alright, Steve knows the question.
Steve is holding on to Tony’s hand. It feels like it’s the only thing grounding the man from whatever seems to trouble his mind. For a moment, he wishes he could go back to only an hour ago, when they were still in their room, cuddled up against each other with Tony drawing patterns on his bare chest.
“Peter kind of urged me on to get here,” he admits. Steve chuckles. They don’t get close, keeping a good distance between themselves. Holy shit, it’s just like before they ever got together, always dancing around each other but never acting on it. “Want a drink? It’s without alcohol, don’t worry about my record.”
“Yes, ma’am,” he says. May laughs again before hanging up the phone. Tony closes his eyes, trying to see where everybody currently is in the tower. He keeps his mind open for incoming aircrafts as well, while at the same time trying to brainstorm for ideas to free his son from this parasitic suit he’s gotten himself with.
“Hah, gotcha!” Yaël grinned widely. Jason looked confusedly at his feet, but he didn’t seem panicked at all. She put her hands behind her back as she stepped in front of him confidently. She won. That was when she noticed everybody else who had been walking in the park, was quietly staring at her with big eyes.
“I mean, you looked like a drunk man, calling out for your hammer.” Jane points at Mjölnir, hanging on Thor’s belt. “But you took the time to teach me things that people thought me crazy for. You opened up my world, gave me explanations for things I couldn’t explain. And with each word that you used to feed my brain, my heart slowly fell harder and harder.
Giving Pepper the Rescue Suit was probably the best thing he could have done. Sure, the woman never really wanted
Peter sees the Goblin’s mouth move, but the voice doesn’t match the person. It sounds deeper, more sane. More…
The elevator ride to his office floor was too short, though that was probably good. One could only work up so much anxiety between three floors unless you were in The Raid. He could see Steve's tall shadow behind the frosted glass doors as he approached, standing and sort of shifting around in the twisting, awkward way Steve did when he wasn't sure what to do with a body that sometimes still wanted to think it was three sizes too big.
The creature disappeared under the water, though Steve could see its shadow gliding along the bottom.  Its eyes popped up just to the right of Steve’s shoulder, and he felt the light brush of one of its tentacles under his neck and another just at his elbow.  He would have thought they would be unpleasant and slimy by the look of the shine to them, and they
“I—I intended to thank you,” Steve said, then realized he had slurred the words into a nice jumble of sounds.  “I wanted to thank you. For the tunic.”
Steve bent at the knee and lifted Tony enough to withdraw almost completely, then braced his hand by Tony’s head again, eyes shifting quickly to Tony’s face.  Tony nodded, face already slackening, and Steve pushed up, seating himself fully again.  Tony’s body juddered as Steve’s thrust found its mark, his cock bobbing between them spurting fluid.
“I—ah.  Okay.  That…doesn’t actually explain anything,” Steve replied as he looked around the room, like the answer to why he had been in Tony’s lap, bundled in noting but a towel would suddenly appear from the ether.
“No,” Ms. Potts said while Rhodes covered his laugh with his hand.  “You two,” she continued, “have to get dressed. The gala starts at seven, and it is—almost six, which means if you are fashionably late, as usual, you still only have a couple of hours.  Tony, your tux is in your closet. Steve, your suit is in your room.”
Nat and Barnes probably traded letters during his deployment.  Sent emails.  Skyped.  They visited each other.  She was there when Barnes was injured, at his bedside in the hospital.  Took care of him afterwards.
“I...I hope so,” Steve replied.  “I’d like to help. With...with whatever you need.  The Harem, Stane, all of it, if you’ll let me.”
, Steve thought with a smile.  When the phone buzzed at lunch, he picked it up immediately, expecting to hear Tony mocking him, but it was Ms. Romanov.  He didn’t even bother to wonder how she’d gotten this number so fast.
It felt familiar and brand new, Tony’s mouth on his, like the memory of a dream.  Steve moaned into the wet heat of Tony’s mouth, and Tony’s tongue slipped past the seam of Steve’s lips, delving deep, searching, sliding along Steve’s own.  It felt like an invasion.  A taking. A
Yet, here they were, on the side of a freaking mountain next to a stream because someone watched Dr. Phil while staying at a Holiday Inn Express last night and suddenly decided immersion therapy was the way to go. None of it made any sense.  The puzzle pieces were all spread out on the table, but it was as if there were no pieces with straight lines or corners to get him started.    Tony grabbed the dishsoap to clean the grease from his hands, watching the tiny bubbles that sprouted out of the top of the bottle float for a moment before popping, one after the other, like all the crazy theories that popped into his head.
“I believe I warned you once that you should not lie to me, did I not?” Tony asked.  His voice was still light, almost nonchalant, but there was something darker that moved underneath the words, something that set Steve’s cock to pulsing and straining, and made air suddenly difficult to come by.
He watched Tony’s throat work with the effort of swallowing. His thrusts slowed, until he finally stilled, waiting.
Long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs has nothing on me, Tony thought grimly, but none of the Alphas so much as looked at him.  He had his Steve-shaped invisibility cloak, he supposed.   The absence of scrutiny still took some getting used to, but, dear God, it was nice to not have to plaster on a second skin, to not have to worry, even just for these few moments.  He hadn’t realized how much energy it took to be constantly aware of himself and his surroundings until he didn’t have to be.
Steve’s stomach clenched and swooped, and a pool of heat bloomed low in his belly at the King’s words.  His cock jumped and hardened.  His hands were trembling as he undid the wrap and let it fall away.  He looked up at the King, who was watching him and sipping his wine, then sat back on the bed, scooted up to the pillows and, remembering the night before, lay down, spread his legs wide and pulled his knees up toward his chest, leaving himself bare to Tony’s view.  He breathed out a long hiss of air through his nose and looked up at the canopy overhead.
He clapped Steve on the shoulder, shook his head and sighed, which seemed to signal that whatever it was, it was Steve’s problem, not his, which Steve supposed it was. The Omega was unhappy about something, which did not make very much sense, given that his enemies were no more, he had a night of pleasure (and a morning), and a full belly. The Omega, though, was singularly confounding, Steve had realized sometime that morning when he presented the head of the Omega’s enemy to him, cleaved from his body by Steve’s own sword. This feat had not seemed to particularly impress the Omega, though he did not seem displeased either, and his pleasure was loud and sure in the time afterwards.
“I do, and I’m sitting here, and all that is true, but, honestly, you had me at nutso.  Oh, and you’re fired, by the way,” Tony said, standing up and leaning his hands on the conference table.  “To answer your question, Steve is the ‘nutso,’” Tony grated out, putting the word in air quotes.  He could feel a thread of anger course through his voice, and his chest tighten with tension.  “Great term, by the way. Classy.  Steve is a highly decorated Army officer, one of the finest men I’ve ever known, someone I probably owe my life to, and Steve was the guy who offered to do anything and everything, including scrub your God-damned toilets, if you would help his friend, which, of course, you didn’t. Because of a lot of reasons, probably.  Possibly even some good ones, I don’t know.  Maybe once upon a time, maybe I was like you, and wouldn’t have cared.  Had a bit of a laugh over the gall of it, you know?  But, trust me, how we do this, it matters.  When you take away all of this,” Tony said, gesturing around the room, “it’s the only thing that matters.  Look, there’s plenty of money to be made.  You can make it on the backs of the people you’re supposed to be helping or you can make it by lifting them up with you.”
Dammit.  Now, the idea was becoming entrenched in Steve’s head, and fuck it all, the man could be intractably stubborn. Somehow, this was all going to be Tony’s fault when it blew up in his face one of these days.  A box of ballots would spill out onto the roadway right in front of SHIELD where they are found by a passing van of reporters with handheld scanners, who stop at a gas station to call it in, whereupon a seagull lands next to their van with the corresponding voter list key in his beak.  Or something.  It could happen.
Tony stared at the scene for a long beat, then looked up at Steve, finding Steve’s eyes on him.  Steve reached out and cupped Tony’s cheek, the back of thumb tracing across Tony’s cheekbone and down to the corner of his mouth before he dropped his hand, pivoted on his heel and walked out of the room.  Tony opened his mouth to call out, but couldn’t get any sound to come.
“I—yeah.  Yeah, it will be good, I guess,” Tony admitted.  “It’s just…it’s hard to leave you.  This…it’s so new.  I don’t…I mean, what if…”
so much more for you. I should have.  I see that now.  When it is too late, of course.  I let my debt to your father overshadow his failings for far too long.  No, no, don’t,” Jarvis said, holding his palm out when Tony opened his mouth, a protest dying on his lips.  “You know it is true. That is something I must live with, but I can do what I can now to rectify things as best as possible.  Starting with why you are not at all fine, no matter your fancy car and your permit with a name.”
Steve could feel something inside him shatter at Tony’s words, and for a flash of a moment, he didn’t care about any prophecy, his friends back home, or the Free States and what they stood for. There was only Tony. Tony, beautiful and bright, and a deep well of giving that Steve knew he was going to poison one day.
“Good,” Tony said, giving Steve a small smile.  Warmth burst into Steve’s chest at the praise, seeping across his skin, the way the sun did when you turned over while lying on the grass naming the shapes of the clouds, happening both slowly and all at once.
“That’s…unfortunate. I’m going to gather some people to fix that problem,” and with that, Thor left their company. Yaël was glad he took the problem seriously, instead of laughing it away. Thor had grown more mature, that was for sure.
Yaël jumped up again and before those dehydrated guards even had the chance to faint and crash down, she had already made a long whip from the water she had gained. The flabbergasted guards got wacked around, like they were toys. Some of them still tried to shoot at her, others tried to run away, but she smoothly dodged the bullets, whacked the whip around the guards, one by one, and smashed them against the walls.
Well, that must be Peter’s cue to leave, right? He holds the bag on his shoulder a bit tighter before clearing his throat.
Yaël grumbled something about wearing seatbelts as she saw Miek and others flying through the ship, bumping into each other and smashing against stuff.
“Dude, I spoke to her a moment ago, she’s my girl too!” another drunk guy ‘joined’ the ‘conversation’, like he didn’t even hear Wade’s weird exclamation. Other guys came buzzing around them too, talking about how Yaël somehow seemed to be their property.
the woman – Linda says. Peter nods even though the guy can’t see it. He clears away another lump in his throat.
“If he’s so against it, why does he go along with it, then? I am many things, you know, but I’m not planning on being a dirty little secret just because he doesn’t want to be seen with a man.”
Tony turns around, his bottle dropping on the floor before he even gets to open it. In his confusion, Dum-E rolls up his way and picks it back up, poking Tony in the side with it.
“Whatever dude,” he mutters out. Flash storms passed them, picking up his ball and then getting to the building Peter was headed to. Peter clears his throat, trying to get his shirt straight again. Had this been before he got his powers, he would have been shaking on the spot. As it is, he’s not feeling anything.
“It’s not for now; I still need to make sure you understand the gravity of you using your overrides like that. But, maybe in a while, you’ll convince me.”
With there being no empty seats, he stands in the hallway with his headphones on, eyes resting on the keyboard he’s currently using to send his texts. All in the while, his music keeps on playing.
Yaël hadn’t slept for a few days and she felt completely drained. Every night was a struggle; on one side, she wanted to sleep because she felt exhausted, but on the other hand she panicked about falling asleep, because what if she’d never wake up? What if she’d see other gruesome things?
Pushing himself off the ground, Tony passes Barnes’ by on the ground. He’s unmoving, but one look at him indicates that he’s still conscious. Whatever, Tony doesn’t really care anymore. He reaches to his sides searching for his manual handle to take off the suit. In one swift motion, it opens up, and out of it falls Tony.
Peter nodded. “Because he’s an alien too, right?” There was instant regret on Peter’s face as soon as he said that. His hand covered his mouth and with big eyes he stared at her. “I suppose so,” she shrugged. This was actually the first time someone randomly confronted her with it and she totally didn’t know how to react to it. Should she be ashamed of it? There had to be another alien somewhere on this planet, right? She couldn’t be the only one. Maybe if she stopped taking her sleeping pills, she’d discover how she ended up on Earth. Or maybe she’d get another attack of the conversion disorder.
“I don’t blame her,” Tony responds. It’s crappy, what happened. He can perfectly imagine she’s not feeling all that well for causing so much destruction. But on the other hand, he’s grateful that she rescued Steve when he was about to be blown up. And if that makes him the biggest hypocrite of them all, he doesn’t care.
they say simultaneously. After that, the call ends. Peter closes his eyes, lying back down with a loud sigh.
Everybody raises their eyebrows at him, simultaneously crossing their arms. It’s Tony who speaks up.
With his hands stuck in his hoodie, Peter turns to his left. His eyes are stuck to the floor, but he knows the way. Opening the door to the workshop, he passes Dum-E who pokes him in the side. He chuckles a bit, letting out his hand from his pocket to pet him on the ‘head’. Then he nods towards Tony, who hasn’t noticed his arrival, too busy with whatever he’s working on this time.
“I landed in New York about an hour ago or so. Traffic is still murder, despite the best chauffeurs coming to pick you up,” Harry explains.  “So, what’s going on? MJ said you’ve broken up? And apparently something about a guy planning to kick your ass for embarrassing him at a party while also having stolen his girlfriend?”
“Yes, the lawyers finished up the paperwork only yesterday. I’m now officially Tony Stark’s son,” he answers.
“Ah come on!” Peter mutters out, getting himself back up and barely avoiding another blow on the head. Instead he shoots webs at the guy’s face, and pulls his phone back to him, finding it still ringing. Quickly he presses the green button, rests the phone between his ear and his shoulder, and finishes his work with the goon in front of him.
“Cool,” Tony says, putting the note away without responding to whatever the message says aside of the fact that he’s already picking his phone back up and starting to type down another number. “Just, be careful. If not, I might take Karen away from you so you’re less distracted.”
Peter looks up, seeing Francis standing there. He looks worried, as if he wants to carry Peter outside, himself. Peter just swallows and takes another deep breath. His hands are balled into fists – they have been ever since he dug into his bag in search of his medication, only to find that he doesn’t have the box with him.
,” Steve begs of him. Or at least, Tony thinks he does. He hears the words, but doesn’t really see Steve’s face move. Is he going mad?
bad, really. Instead he leans back in his seat, his hand holding the now-empty mug that had contained a cappuccino Natasha bought for him (Peter forgot his wallet in the tower…)
“So what, your way of apologizing is by asking me if I can arrange you a date with my friend?” Peter mutters out.
The sky is dark, which makes the thing all the more obvious. It looks like a comet, probably? A small one, surely. The only problem is that it’s headed straight for them.
“Steve?! How- wha- where are you?!” Peter calls out, almost unable to contain his excitement. It’s the first time he’s speaking to the man since… well, a few days at least. He’d almost forgotten how it feels to talk to him. “Steve, what’s going on there?”
For the following few days, Peter finds himself reading about four journals a day. There’s nothing productive he really does during the day, and Aunt May even scolds him a few times for it, but she never really manages to stay angry at him for too long. That’s one of the reasons he loves her so much.
It takes a few minutes for them to get out of the gardens. Natasha clearly prepared her whole path before coming here. Steve has to admire the way she’s prepared for it.
“I could explain it to you, if you want?” Peter tries. Steve just shakes his head. When they pass Wanda, the two nod at her before continuing their walk.
“Oh God,” Peter groans, feeling like he’s about to puke. He’s not feeling wonderful at all. He remembers slightly how ecstatic he’d been feeling the entire evening, but right now it must be about the exact opposite. His shoulders feel heavy, his heart feels like it’s been ripped out right again.
“Isn’t it?” Peter asks in a whisper, probably not wanting Tony to hear it. But the man does, and he looks up to him with wide eyes and a mouth fallen open.
“Can you blame me?” he asks. Looking up again, he gives Tony a hopeful look. Thankfully, amount of people in the park is thinning out, so there aren’t too many people listening along to this.
“I’m making money,” she says proudly, picking up a box from somewhere on her left and pushing it in front of the safe. Then she carefully puts whatever’s inside into the box and seals it.
And much like Thor suspected, the preparation of the great hall had been finished. There are white drapes all around, flowers, candles, and even a few golden ornaments. The many chairs don’t look that expensive, but the thrones on the other side of the room does.
Because that’s now actually a thing. Apparently, the date went well. Harry’s been in seventh heaven the entire school day, talking about how amazing it is to kiss her, or how soft her skin feels underneath his fingers. Peter and Ned just smirk at each other while rolling their eyes each time he brings it up.
Sometimes he came to visit her in her room afterwards. Those were the moments he had been caring for her, cleaning her wounds. After a while, Yaël refused to talk to him anymore. He was the reason why she ended up on that ship. But Loki never stopped talking to her, even though he knew she wouldn’t reply, he told her it was almost over, that she shouldn’t be afraid. But the joke was that on one point, she couldn’t feel afraid as she wasn’t able to feel a thing anymore. Just the way Thanos wanted her to be.
Steve lets out a loud breath. “It’s always serious business, honey. When else are we ever going to get a good night’s sleep with all this?”
FEAST is located in an old school. A couple of the old classrooms have been used as sleeping-quarters, but most of them serve for specific sessions. They could be something creative, or something informative. FEAST’s purpose isn’t just to give the homeless shelter, but to also help them back on their way.
It goes on, Tony joining in on the dancing much like they practiced until he grabs the shield back and strikes his final pose. He’s a bit out of breath, waiting for the lights to die down. He’s sweating like crazy, realizing that this suit is not really optimal for fighting at all. The fact that people believed Steve went into battle with this was to be honest the most disbelieving part of this all.
But it’s obvious who it’s going to be. Because why would Sam and Clint and Natasha be let out earlier, and he wouldn’t? Why would they keep him in longer when he’s been locked up before them? It wouldn’t be fair, after all.
Tony frowns. He never knew about that. How is that even possible? Did Peter’s parents know about him getting bitten, then? How could they possibly know about that?
“Bodyguards, am I right?” Peter jokes. Shuri laughs again. They leave the dancefloor when the DJ announces he’s about to play the last song. They take place at the table again, Peter takes out his wallet and heads up to get some of those waffles for everybody. He jumps in surprise when he turns around and somebody stands behind him all of the sudden.
“Aren’t you a bit too young to-“ the man starts, but then he sighs and shakes his head. Eventually he pats the backseat and waits for Peter to sit himself down, which he does. After that, they start driving again, this time with Peter making ‘whooosh’ noises in the back.
“Steve, my man, Barnes and I have been in a discussion about this for the past half hour or so. You can help us out,” Sam says with a wink towards Steve, who in return nods and leans against the couch while he waits for it.
“Hi, Yaël, didn’t really expect to see you here!” Peter said with a wide smile. “Who’s your friend?”
“What, you think I’m gonna smash this screwdriver in my chest, is that it?” Mr. Stark asks, sounding completely different at that point. “Think I might pop few pills too many? Electrocute myself?”
But now he can’t, because Steve is holding his wrist, and Tony’s skin is burning, and there’s this uneasy feeling in his stomach and chest. As if whatever’s inside wants to break back out. And Steve is still looking at him with those blue eyes. Blue, with little dots of green in them, expressing nothing but admiration and friendliness. And now worry as well.
Ned throws him a ball and Miles catches it – with his face. Sputtering out a muffled curse, Miles rubs his slightly painful cheek and throws Ned a small glare, only to get a wide grin in return.
“I live with my Aunt May. My Uncle used to live with us, but he passed away a few years ago,” Peter says, stumbling a little bit over his words. Tony takes another deep breath, wondering how many family-members one kid can lose at such a young age.
And yes, Peter thinks back of that week where he asked around to every person who had ever had a redheaded girlfriend how exactly he was supposed to ask MJ out. Those persons were Tony (who was with Pepper once), Bucky (who is currently with Nat), Bruce (who was with Nat once), Happy (who is currently with Pepper) and Harry (who was with MJ before they broke up).
“Korg, you and Miek keep going, I’ll keep these guys at work!” Korg nodded and took another passage while Yaël kept running forward.
“Peter, I understand that the subject concerning Mrs. Stacey is a sensitive one for you, but that doesn’t give you the right to start throwing punches,” Mr. Morita then starts. Mr. Stark stays awfully quiet next to Peter. “We always have somebody who would be willing to talk with you about these past happenings.”
At a certain point, someone had the genius idea to do certain activities to keep Wanda and Yaël occupied and distract them a bit, like doing a Tolkien-marathon, swimming and… playing a game of laser tag in the compound. Peter came to the compound more often now after he heard Wanda was kind of grounded. Yaël didn’t even tell Peter she was grounded too, she was still grumpy about it. That and Nilla was still taking over her mind, so Yaël forgot to talk about quite a lot.
“Yeah, thanks! I’m Peter,” he says as an introduction. The girl gives the hand an amused look before taking it.
Speaking to Wilson took less effort than he’d expected. The two of them respect each other, and they know where they stand. If Tony admits that he’s wrong, he knows that Sam will not take that lightly. Because Tony
Peter smiles back at him, glad that they have Dr. Strange in their lives. Sure, his personality pretty much clashes with Tony’s on very occasions and he’s not exactly the guy they would invite for the holidays, but he’s still a valuable friend to have.
Tony shakes his head, and puts the tablet down at last. With serious eyes, he faces his son, lips put in a tight line.
“I love you as well,” he says. They kiss shortly before pulling back again. Tony is then quickly ushered away by the wardrobe-team who seem intent on getting him into some decent-looking clothes. Peter, too, is dragged along. And as the two are put together, getting clothes thrown into their arms, Tony decides to ask at last.
FRIDAY suddenly says. Peter startles from the sudden noise and starts whimpering in the crib. Tony groans, rolling his eyes as he gets back to his boy and picks him back up.
The woman cleaned out her wounds, most of them had started infecting, which had been unavoidable as she had been laying in thrash for hours. While Dr. Cho was doing that, Yaël did her best not to jump off the stretcher, nor set the building on fire.
“AREN’T THEY ADORABLE??!!” she shouts, and once again the crowd starts cheering. Steve, next to him, clears his throat. Peter just takes a shaky breath.
Peter pulls a bit at the web, testing out its strength and resistance. When it appears to be sticking to the building in front of him, he lets go of the wall, letting himself fall down freely, swinging around. Instinctively, he shoots web after web, leaving the previous one hanging there until it should dissolve on itself. With a smooth movement, one he barely even understands, himself, he’s on the roof of a driving cab. A few people look up in surprise, pointing at him. He just waves, only wanting to be out of here as quickly as possible.
And they sit like that for a while, jumping together whenever there’s a scary part. When Wade suddenly hands them a glass of coke, they share it without any comment about it. It’s good, it’s pleasant, and for a moment Peter wishes they were alone, just the two of them.
“You found the place easily?” Peter asks. MJ clears her throat then, pointing towards the car that has by now disappeared.
Yaël noticed the warmth coming from her apartment as she opened the door. She stood there for a second, being pulled from her thoughts. There were no more powers needed to warm her water or her rooms, all thanks to mister X.
“You don’t know?” Eddie asks, sounding furious. There’s another punch in Peter’s face. MJ shouts somewhere in the distance. “Let me see; you steal my girlfriend, you get her killed – literally. Then you steal my best friend, and you humiliate me at a party where
, one wouldn’t say we’ve been dating for the past three and a half months by the look you’re giving me here,” Tony jokes, though it doesn’t help with the clenching inside of his heart. Has it only been three and a half? Tony would like to think they’re together for longer than that… Then he holds up the box. “Do you want to see something cool? I pulled it from dad’s archives a little while back.”
“Damn it!” Barnes curses. “Don’t stand together, you’re an easier target, idiots!” He runs away from the little group that has collected. Tony agrees, forcing himself to run off. He has since long lost the ability to fly. His link with FRIDAY is lost, too. But above him, he can see Rhodey and Pepper hover in the air.
They don’t even get a day before Tony is called away again. Only barely caught up on sleep, he comes with the news that he’s called away to Berlin. When Peter asks what’s up, all Tony does it put up the TV where a news channel is showing a live feed of something happening in Vienna.
As for the kid's deal; it's all part of Yaël's story and will be explained there. Just know that at one point there's a baby and it gets a reaction out of Tony and Steve.
Yaël had seen Scott talking fights out with the kids too, he had a lot of patience for them. She, on the other hand, was very bad at comforting people. It was like the students could feel that, because they never went to Yaël with their problems. Maybe that was for the best. Yaël could imagine herself panicky patting someone on his or her shoulder to comfort that person and then trying to get away from the conflict because she wouldn’t know how to handle.
“Uh, I don’t suppose it has anything to do with my science project?” Peter tries, only to receive a scowl from both Mr. Morita and Mr. Stark. Peter gulps, knowing this is not the right time to be funny. “Or maybe because I punched a bully in the face?”
But Steve doesn’t buy it. “You keep telling yourself that,” he says, and he drops the pen back down, giving Tony another glare. “Hate to break up the set.”
There’s a hand touching his arm in comfort, and that’s when Peter breaks. Tears stream down his face, sobs escape his mouth. Peter keeps on shaking, even as Yaël is trying her best to comfort him.
“That idiot made his brain into an actual super-computer in a way,” she explains. “I could explain it to you, but it’s way above my knowledge. I’m pretty savvy with computers but even I don’t know how he managed to do this shit.”
Peter starts walking around in the room, trying to take a good view of everything there is. He can see some sort of prototype for one of Widow’s weapons – Peter doesn’t know how it’s called. A bit further there are a pair of Falcon’s wings, but these obviously took a beat, damaged in combat. Peter wonders if it’s a result from fighting the Goblin.
“Tony, go to sleep,” he mutters sleepily. So he must have been awake all along then, probably just trying as well. Tony rolls his eyes, putting the tablet back down and turning back onto his side to look at Steve. The super-soldier doesn’t open his eyes.
“We can’t keep on using that Infinity Stone,” Peter returns. He scrapes his throat, sniffs through his nose one last time, and stands up straight. “I need to go, now.”
“Did you hear anything from Peter?” Wade asked her casually as he jumped off his horse. That name stung, that was how for this situation had become.
It’s an easy mistake, he thinks; he’s often fighting crime on the streets (which he still hasn’t been doing three weeks after getting wounded), building a super-suit with his father (which he’s also sure would have been finished already had Tony not waited for Peter every time), and going to actual
"I'm sure you've checked the news already?" Rhodey starts somewhere in the middle of their dinner. "Crowned favorite couple of the year, can't say it's really that much of a surprise, right?" Rhodey smirks at the couple seated next to Peter.
Peter shrugs. “Nauseated, my head also aches and my muscles don’t really seem to like me right now. Oh, and is it normal that I have trouble breathing?”
“Now, I see that’s a shock to you,” he states. Steve wasn’t surprised or impressed by her powers. He was used to it as she already had a few emotional burst outs around him. Or, like now, the powers sometimes unknowingly crept up, like they were an extra limb or anything, Steve had seen it all.
that’s still any of your business?” He should walk away now. Because, unknowingly, he’s getting closer again. Closer to that strong, muscular body. Closer to those perfect lips. Closer to Steve. “You aren’t my
Miles knows that ‘Mary-Jane’ is just MJ’s nickname. In her attempt to remain anonymous, she goes out as the journalist ‘Mary Jane Watson’ while in real life she stays Michelle Jones. Miles only knows this because he once heard her talk about it to Peter when the two of them thought they were alone.
“What do want me to learn those kids? Math? I can only do basic counting, the stuff you need to pay the bills and go to the store. Languages? My English sounds like I’m from gods-knows-where and I don’t think there are many kids here who want to learn Norwegian or Sil. I’m not a professor or scientist, Charles. Hell, I even never went to school.”
“I think that’s for the best,” he then says after a long pause. Tony nods, understanding where he’s coming from. Using the Iron Man armor surely isn’t the best idea at all right now. He’s too powerful over FRIDAY, and if he would be in actual danger, she wouldn’t be able to help him.
Peter remembers one of the codes FRIDAY gave him. Next to the override-one, there’s also a request for immediate help. It contains a certain combination of numbers that needs to be typed in on the phone, which would alert FRIDAY immediately. Peter can’t care too much right now that FRIDAY keeps watch on his phone in the first place.
“Yeah, that’s a piece of Steve you got in there, isn’t that cool?” Peter asks, clearly too enthusiastic about it. Next to Tony, Steve just shrugs.
Because if you run one internship at Stark Industries, you know everything about the man. Peter just shakes his head all the time, claiming that he isn’t working there anymore and that he doesn’t know. Some people seem to accept it, others… aren’t.
“I can go home,” he mutters out. He didn’t even have to build that machine. Hell, he’s been hacking through SHIELD’s files and he didn’t even need to. Quickly, he turns towards Steve, taking his hands into his own. “I need to go, Steve.”
Yaël looked around. The cage was sealed with another glass plate that also looked like it was unbreakable due to its thickness.
until now, has just been bought back by Stark Industries. At least that doesn’t mean they’ll have to move so soon after Peter just got here.
“Can Peter even have the MRI? Doesn’t he have that device in his head for his hearing?” Steve asks calmly. Bruce frowns slightly, turning to Tony who shrugs.
Then, suddenly, there’s a hand behind his head, stroking through his hair. It’s not coming from Aunt May’s side, so Peter figures it must be Mr. Stark. He shudders a bit before the first tear rolls over his cheek. With a small groan, he turns towards his Aunt with a questioning look. The woman nods.
As it turns out, even Mr. Stark has gotten curious as to what the ruckus has been outside of his tower. Still neatly in the suit (not the Iron Man suit, though), the billionaire starts walking towards the exits until he sees Peter standing there, looking the way he does with cuts and bruises all over his face.
Tony rolls his eyes. “Of course I can,” he objects. “Listen, this is nothing we can’t fix at home. I have a first-aid-kit back in the worksh-“
“C’mon, don’t hold back for me,” Tony tells him. Peter clears his throat again and then nods. At the same time, the two move forward. When Peter’s once again wrapped safely in Steve’s strong arms, he lets out a content sigh.
Maybe it would’ve been better to go outside, but Yaël really didn’t feel like it, so she quickly grabbed the vodka ant went back to her living room and sat down. This wasn’t right, she thought as she put her forehead onto the cap of the bottle. When she opened her eyes, she saw the number of Peter’s therapist laying on her small table. This was her last option, she had to make the phone call.
“Hovslagtrommataktenslær. Farasvint med flyg-førhov. Hjartetfylgjer, tveimblirein. Ber du meg, eglovar deg. Ri ut, Raido!” she sang on the rhythm of the ticking. Yaël could swear she sneakily heard the guy behind her humming it along. It was the song she and Raido used to call for each other. The others of the cavalry knew that when they heard it, they had to ignore it and ride to somewhere else. That was the only favor they wanted to do for Yaël, since she was the banished one, but they granted her talking to Raido, nothing more. And that was already behind the back of the king and the queen.
“Ladies and gentlemen, we’re going to start the ceremony,” Loki then suddenly says, facing the audience and slightly bowing at them. People start shutting up, the ones who were standing are now starting to sit down.
“You have no idea,” Peter snorts. MJ looks impressed. Immediately after that, the King emerges from the craft, wearing a black suit. Peter remembers the few times he’s ever spoken to the man. It’s weird how he has no problem talking to Thor (a God!!) but can’t even manage a sentence with the King of Wakanda.
He’s starting to form a headache again. His thoughts are going much faster than before, and he finds that he can’t quite catch up to it after a while. With input coming from everywhere, he can understand what Peter meant when he said that the lenses on his suit help him focus more. It almost feels like Tony needs one of those of his own. Oh, shit, what has become of him…?
A photograph of Tony and Pepper together, the Eiffel-tower standing behind them. Pepper was kissing Tony on the cheek, and Tony looked… happy.
me, but it’s not like I’ll run in to him, right? Besides, if he’s so butthurt about it, he can just kiss my-“
His eyes fly open nonetheless. The shock stronger than whatever is keeping his eyelids down. He blinks a few times; the lights have been dimmed, which is good. Tony tries to lift up his head, to see where everybody is. The first person he catches is Peter, smiling at him. He looks pale, as if he hasn’t been sleeping at all. Tony pulls his hand out of his to put it against his cheek. Peter closes his eyes and leans into the touch.
Tony sighs. That’s exactly what he told himself not to do. But at the same time he doesn’t want to make Peter feel like he’s unwanted. Shit, he just can’t do anything right either way. In defeat, he nods against Steve’s chest. The man pulls back after that, putting a hand on Steve’s cheek and looking him into his eyes.
It’s empty. There’s no furniture in there. In his surprise, Peter takes a few steps back, shaking his head in disbelief.
“Why do you hate me so much? I can’t remember hurting you! We’re sisters!” Suddenly Nilla’s face came dangerously close to hers again.
“You sound like a dad, Steve,” Yaël grinned at him. Well, she surely hoped Steve was open-minded about kids. If he’d be with that Stark-guy, he’d have to accept Peter too. Not that Tony knew that Peter was his son… yet.
Without thinking further of it, Tony opens up the journal and starts going through it. He realizes quickly that, once again, this one is dated way too early. He puts it aside and reaches for the next one. By the time Steve returns, Tony already discarded five journals. It seems like Mary really had a lot to write down. When he has time, he’d love to read through them if Peter’s okay with that, but now he just doesn’t have that time.
“I’m sure we don’t,” she responds. She grabs for her bottle of water and takes a large gulp. Then she throws Harry a very unimpressed glare. “Listel pal, if you’re looking any longer I feel like I might combust into flames. Just say something or look somewhere else.”
“We were just saying, Mr. Stark, that we don’t think you’re taking the company’s best interest at heart,” Klaus says. Or, Tony thinks it’s Klaus. To be fair, he hasn’t been to these types of meetings in years. He’s still not really sure what he’s doing here right now.
“Everybody’s got some blood samples stacked here for occasions like these,” he explains. Peter frowns shortly but eventually he nods.
Trusting his spider-sense, Peter jumps forward in a roll, barely managing to escape another blow coming from the Goblin, who seems to have pried himself away from the battle just long enough to attempt and take Peter again.
Mr. Stark says before hanging up again. Peter’s mouth falls open as the phone still hangs next to his ear.
Tony smiles back at him before closing the space between them by pressing their mouths together. It’s been a few days since they’ve last been able to do that, and every time they’re separated, it seems like their need to be closer gets stronger.
It doesn’t take too long for Tony to find Peter. He never left the port. Tony can see the ship, where everybody is by now evacuated. The ship will be carried off, thrown away. There’s no possible way for them to permanently fix it. Tony’ll have to fund the making of a new ship, too.
He understands venom a little bit now. Eddie’s always been strong, he’s a jock after all. But he’s not agile, not fast. Venom heightens the person’s powers, meaning that Eddie’s not as fast as Peter. The best thing he can do is keep on moving, then.
Without knowing it, she must’ve fallen asleep, because suddenly she was standing in the woods again.
,” she said. Peter didn’t stop her when she grabbed his phone. Yaël walked out the bedroom, giving the teen some privacy to put on some clothes. It wasn’t so that Yaël cared about the sex-stuff. She wasn’t ashamed of that. It was the total package that made her feel horrible. This was her friend, and she used him, because somehow when she gets drunk, she can’t stay away from men.
Here comes the first official appearance of our original character, Yaël. She's a character created for the story we were originally writing. But as we were writing, inspiration came for a tie-in story about Peter. The two stories will be connected, but you don't particularly have to read one to understand the other (would be difficult, since we're still busy with writing the other story and it hasn't been posted anywhere yet).
Peter thinks for a moment, looking down at the arc reactor but then thinking better of it. He wants it to be a surprise, after all.
“Ah, Stark, always fun talking with ya,” Wolverine says, though his tone doesn’t sound like he finds it ‘fun’ indeed. Then, without a warning, he jumps out of the window to get back to Deadpool, but when Peter casts one third look, it seems like the guy has disappeared. How did he do that?
“Hello?” Peter asks. The door closes behind him. Whoever has been sitting there, startles up and jumps on his feet. His sandy blonde hair is cut short. He’s wearing a faded Superman shirt and sweatpants. His feet are covered by some warm-looking slippers.
Steve laughed, shaking his head again at the boy’s excited ramble of thoughts.  “I am fine for the evening, Cam.  Go on, now. Say goodbye to your mother.  She will miss you terribly, you know.”
“Good.  See?  What?   You need to talk about this shit, Steve, and if you won't with me, maybe you will with him.  Now, climb down off your pyre there, Joan, and thank your husband, would you?” Barnes demanded with a somewhat fond, if pointed, look at Steve. “He’s doing us a solid, and that’s more than most would do. Pretty sure it isn’t because he just loves my witty repartee.”
Steve wasn’t sure why he was agreeing or what, exactly, he was agreeing to, but he didn’t want to leave. If he was honest with himself, he wasn’t ready for this night to end.  Maybe Tony wasn’t either, whatever his reasons were.
to keep you safe.  I can’t lose you,” Tony ground out, standing up so quickly, the stool’s wheels spun it back into the legs of the worktable with a metallic clang.  “I need to be ready,” he muttered, nodding his head for emphasis. “For the next time.  For what’s coming.  And it is coming, Steve.  I’ve seen it.  This wasn’t a one and done, dammit, you know that!”
“It’s good you’re here, Tony,” Natalie—Natasha--told him, giving him a measured look.  Enigmatic. That was the word Tony’s brain kept trying to find when it could get past the blinking light that said Medical at the front of his mind.  “Steve needs you.”
Steve was looking at some point on the far wall over Tony’s shoulder.  His shoulders were pulled back and stiff with tension.   Someone was a Grumpy Gus, Tony thought, physically restraining himself from rolling his eyes.
“You and I are really going to need to have a conversation about boundaries,” Steve said mildly. The armor, which apparently took after its creator, completely ignored him. He sighed and turned towards the coffee pot and pulled out the special blend from Italy that Tony liked. Steve got the coffee brewing, then prepared a plate of the foods he’d requested Jarvis order for the island, along with the coffee.
They strolled through the lobby at a leisurely pace this time, since the gauntlet of reporters had thankfully disappeared or gotten far better at blending in.  Two young girls came up to ask Tony for an autograph, and he seemed happy enough to oblige, making quick work of the signing and small talk before agreeing to take a selfie with his admirers.
“Don’t you go getting ideas,” Maria scolded, carrying a laugh inside the words.  A high-pitched squeal followed by a watery, gurgling giggle followed.  “Oh dear, where did you find him this time? He’s supposed to be with Jarvis.  You’re supposed to be with Jarvis, you silly boy!  Obie, would you put him down?  He just ate!”
A burst of saliva watered Steve’s mouth, and he tried to swallow, but couldn’t quite manage around Tony’s cock, making him cough, throat working to try to accommodate air and too much wetness and Tony’s cock filling him, not caring about either.  Long, deep strokes that made Steve’s eyes water and shook the leaflike fringe of the veil until it clinked lightly together.  The pendant swung wildly where it hung from his chest, tugging and pulling at the clamps, sending pings of stinging pain down his chest and groin as Tony used his mouth.  Tears streamed from his eyes, and Steve blinked them back, lashes sticking together.  Tony brush a silvery trail off Steve’s cheek with his thumb and brought it to his mouth, sucking Steve’s tears off his finger as if they were an elixir, even as his hips snapped hard, pounding his cock into Steve’s mouth while bright, white stars blurred against Steve’s eyes.
“I wish I had a harmonica,” Tony said, thumping his head against the back wall of the holding cell just above the fold-down metal cot where he was sitting.  “I feel like I should have a harmonica.”
“I’ve stopped mentioning things out loud,” Steve cut in. “No, thanks, 26, I’m really okay,” Steve said quickly as the armor held a pillow out to him. Rather too hopefully, Tony thought in annoyance, rolling his eyes. He’d wanted to tear the damn thing apart for scraps, but now Steve was all sentimental about it.
Tony stood up in one quick motion and walked swiftly away from the table.  He stopped when he reached the living room.  Steve got up, too, not knowing what else to do, and started clearing the dishes.
“I don’t—that’s not--I wanted to…talk to you.  About—” Steve broke off.  About us? That sounded naïve and presumptuous, even in Steve’s mind. He let out a huff of air and drew in a deep breath.  “About what I said.  Before,” Steve added.  “What I was trying to say, anyway.”
married.  They were just…whatever it was they were doing.  Liking each other.  That hardly meant for as long as they both shall live.  That kind of thinking was crazy, clearly, and he
He opened his eyes to brightness.  No.  Not brightness. A light.  A sliver of blue light, cutting a bright line through the darkness.  He blinked again.  Not a line of light.  Light escaping under a door, he realized.  He was in the Tower.  As soon as he thought it, it seemed crystal clear, and he wondered why he hadn’t noticed it before.  He was in a hallway in the Tower.  The hallway outside Tony’s room.  There was an Iron Man painting hanging next to his shoulder done by six-year-old Callie, who won a contest at her library in Scranton with it and gotten a fifty-dollar savings bond and a certificate.  Iron Man was handing out glowing flowers to a group of people, two cats, and an iguana with a collar that said his name was Earl.  Tony had asked for a copy and given her a full scholarship to the college of her choice one day.  Steve remembered thinking how casual Tony could sometimes be with his generosity, throwing money around like it meant nothing.  Maybe it didn’t mean anything to him.  It was hard to tell with Tony, sometimes. It
“He didn’t move in.  We had dinner.  We were talking and then…my back, and Tony…he helped,” Steve explained.  “Am I fired?”
Something was up, that much was clear, though damned if Tony knew what had changed between floral doodles and the hotel lobby. In the car ride over, Steve had been looking anywhere but at Tony, and all of Tony’s attempts at conversation fell flat. Tony couldn’t help but feel as if he’d done something to screw it up, though he couldn’t quite work out exactly what.  One minute, they’d been bantering about the flower exchange, Steve being crazy-adorable and Tony probably acting like a besotted fool, and the next, they’d spilled out of the elevator into reality and…Steve had clammed up.
“Blood pressure is a bit elevated, and your pulse-ox is low,” the other medic said.  “We’d like to take you in and run some tests, Mr. Stark. Just as a precaution.”
Tony slid into one of the barstools and picked up the coffee.  Ah, heaven, he thought, inhaling the aroma and following it up with the first, glorious sip.  It was just the way he liked it, strong, with just a bit of cream.  He was oddly pleased that Steve remembered.
Steve's eyes, still blown wide, snapped to Tony's in what Tony would have called shock for lack of a better word, though that wasn't quite right, because there was pain in them, pain and regret and something else that slashed through Tony, bright and searing. Fear. There was fear there, too, lurking in the background, which made no sense, not really, but what in this did?
“I speak many languages,” the man said.  “I am called Yinsen, by the way.  His translator. And I do not think I will tell him what you have to say, for both our sakes.”
“--in town for the Department of Defense’s annual Defense Innovation Show, Stark was spotted enjoying the craps table at Wynn’s casino, alongside the Vegas mogul himself.  Kelsey, I’m told Stark won a Picasso off Wynn in a side-bet,” the woman on TV announced with a smile in her voice before it went silent.
“Sounds good, Tony,” Steve replied, the tension visibly leeching out of his shoulders when he realized Tony really was going to let it go.
“I’m not here about your marriage, or whatever this is,” Everhart responded dismissively.  “I’m here about this,” she said, holding up one of the pictures. “Recognize it? Should be familiar enough to both of you.  It’s a town called Gulmira. Ever heard of it? The Ten Rings was holed up there with hundreds of human shields until you and your team showed up, Captain, and
But why, if Steve had feelings for him, why didn’t he say something?  Why let it just be about sex, if he wanted something more?  And then break it off without so much as even the fake kind of ‘It’s not you, it’s me’ speech?  He would blame Barnes, if only because that seemed to be the party most responsible for Steve’s actions lately, but if it was Barnes’ potential return that led Steve to break things off, why agree to a set-up with dear Anne from R&D, who held two Master’s degrees from Caltech, liked hiking, riding her Harley and volunteered with animal rescue.  Which Tony totally did not know about.  Shame she accepted that offer of promotion at the facility in Shanghai.
“That’s—yeah, right, we didn’t have no clue, man, swear to fucking God,” Dominic pleaded.  “You have to believe us.  Tell him, tell Cap, we didn’t know.  Besides, nothing—nothing happened, really.  I mean, I got a little, you know, tazed or whatever. Which is cool. Totally fine. Had that coming, I see that now.  And then he just, he kinda like fell or something, and hit his head, and see…we didn’t want to just leave him there for, you know, like anyone to come along and find him or something, so…”
“They used to show these news reels about the war in front of the picture shows,” Steve said, seemingly apropos of nothing.  “One time, this guy was yelling at the screen, trying to get the projectionist to skip over the reels, get to the entertainment, you know?  There was this woman there, watching it, and I could see her crying when they showed the soldiers.  The more the guy shouted, the more upset she got.  So, I told him to pipe down. Ended up in the alley behind the theater getting the stuffing knocked out of me until Bucky showed up.”
“Bucky said you came to Germany,” Steve said after a pause.  He’d stopped, one hand on the door handle.  His bad hand, Tony noticed, tightening, then releasing, like Steve couldn’t decide whether to hang on or let go.  His eyes were fixed forward, locked on the doors, a muscle twitching in his cheek.  Here there be dragons, Tony thought to himself.
“This is him,” Steve said, holding the phone out to Stark, who hesitated a moment, then plucked it from Steve’s hand before quickly handing it back.
Giving up on any of his plans for the evening actually coming to fruition, Steve headed to his own apartment. The temptation to check on Tony was strong, but do not disturb meant what it meant.  If Tony wanted privacy, for whatever reason, then Steve wasn’t going to intrude.  He was absolutely not going to think about the relief he’d felt when Deirdre had been at her desk in Marketing, instead of upstairs in Tony’s penthouse.  Definitely not.
***************************************************************************************************************************
“Mad?” Tony repeated, sounding bewildered. “No. No, I’m not mad, Steve. I’m honestly relieved it wasn’t something worse. I could tell you have been twisting yourself into knots lately. I knew a storm was brewing in that head of yours, and if the night’s outburst was all it was, then I consider myself fortunate.”
“But?” Tony cajoled with a sigh.  “I know there’s a but coming.  That was entirely too vaguely complimentary for you.  You do that when you’re about to tell me everything that’s wrong.”
“Probably play video games,” Kirk said, then huffed out a laugh.  “You should see your face.  No, I’m not going to play video games with my life.   I will probably get supremely bored one day and hack Ubisoft so all their characters become butch lesbians.  But, that’s more of a hobby than a career.  I’m going to run a global weapons conglomerate and slowly transition it to clean energy, telecommunications, assistive technology—mostly for medical stuff--adaptive hardware and artificial intelligence.”
“I know that, Stark,” Fury said, rubbing his forehead with his hand. “I thought he was okay now?” Fury asked, directing the question at Steve and ignoring Tony’s disgruntled look.
“Everyone’s for sale,” Stark replied with a slight sigh that sounded almost sad, stepping towards him so that he stood just outside the pool of light from the balcony’s single bulb. He spread out his hands, an open gesture that seemed almost like a surrender.  “It’s just about how much it will cost.”
“Tony—you—you do know that you can’t buy the Metropolitan Museum of Art so Steve will like you, right?” Pepper asked carefully, eyes narrowing.
“That you think yourself common makes you all the more remarkable. I assure you, there is nothing common about you.  There is a force in you, this strength and certainty you have, and yes, righteousness, even in a world that refuses to bend to it.  You are far from perfect, my soldier,” Tony breathed out, mouth quirking up at the corners, “but, you are a good man, and that is, perhaps, the hardest thing to be in a world that rewards those who can set that aside when it suits them.  Not you, though.  Never you.  That much, I know.  You have endured more than any one man should in such a meager span of years, my dearest one,” Tony said, glancing up at Steve, this time with heavy, liquid eyes that grew soft, almost pleading, as he looked at Steve.   His hands found Steve’s hips, resting there, just beneath where the water lapped at Steve’s waist. “I would…consider it a great accomplishment if you did not have to endure anymore,” he said at long last.
“Again, my apologies,” Tabbert added, then sucked in a quick breath, nodded at some point between Tony and Steve, grabbed his tweed coat to hold in front of him and all but ran off towards the men’s room.
“Is Tony excited for MIT?” Peggy asked, drawing Steve’s wandering mind back to the screen.  “I didn’t get a chance to talk to him at the party last night.”
That was crazy. Pepper was an idiot. A complete and utter idiot, and she was putting thoughts into Steve’s head.  Bad thoughts, untrue thoughts and why would she do that? This was pure and true and right, and Steve shouldn’t be concerned about anything remotely like that.  Now Steve was concerned and it was all Pepper’s fault.  And Pepper needed to tell Steve, tell him right now, that she hadn’t meant it, that such a thing wasn’t possible, and that this was pure and true and right, and she really needed to use those words and then stop speaking, except maybe to tell Steve that this was pure and true and right, just in case he wasn’t sure.  Maybe she could send some kind of expert over?  Were there bonding doctors?  Sure there were.  There had to be.  They could tell Steve that this was pure and true and right and Pepper didn’t know what she was talking about and--
This was good, Tony thought, somewhat dreamily, this thing where they became one for a time.  It always felt a bit like a feather floating down, swaying back and forth on a gentle breeze as it settled on the ground.  Hormones, sure, he knew that, but it felt like more.  He reached a hand behind him and traced it lightly over Steve’s hip, cupping the curve of his ass.  No one else could give Steve this, not like this.  Not the way Tony could.  He wasn’t sure how he knew that, but he was as sure of it as he was of any of his equations.
—what kind of shit went down over there.  And these people want to make you feel dirty just for shaking your junk around?  Come on, that’s bullshit,” Bucky protested.
“Ms. Potts,” Mitch said warmly in greeting. “Good to see you, as always. Colonel Rhodes, so nice to have you back in town.”
“And then I wouldn’t have met Tony, so—so don’t ask me to regret it, okay, Buck?  Because I don’t,” Steve added, turning towards Tony. “I don’t.”
“I think we just need to let the lawyers handle it from here, Tony,” Steve answered, letting his head dip down to his chest where he leaned against the counter.
“Did you and Dave ever have kids?” Tony asked, turning to Charles, when the rest of the group seemed preoccupied with the choice of venue for someone named Tegan’s Bonding celebration.
“JARVIS, bath, please,” Tony called out.  “And get us some food delivered.  That Thai place.  Say, four times my usual order.  Do not let Clint bring it to us,” Tony commanded.  He helped Steve to his feet, or at least held onto him while Steve managed just fine, whatever.  His own legs were wobbly and weak from kneeling, so it was possible it was Steve who actually propelled them to the tub.
“You, ah,” Steve began, then stopped to clear his throat, looking down and away before finding Tony’s eyes again.  A small, crooked smile ghosted over his expression before he seemed to catch himself and shutter it into something Tony recognized now as Steve’s stage-face.  “You ready to go?”  Steve asked, then looked down pointedly.  Tony realized he had one hand clutched tightly on the sleeve of Steve’s jacket and the other wound into Steve’s hair, still trying to tug Steve’s mouth back down to his like his hand hadn’t quite gotten the message that they were done just yet.
“Stark just left you there, huh?” Brock asked, his eyes narrowing slightly.  It looked almost like concern, but it didn’t feel like concern.  There was an undercurrent of… implication in Brock’s words that made Steve’s jaw tighten and his back stiffen.
So why did it hurt to think about?  Okay, the night itself didn’t hurt to think about.  The night was… a lot to think about, but none of it bad.  If he were honest with himself, what stung was not seeing Tony this morning.  Even Brock could pick up on that, apparently, though it would have been nice if Brock had let that slide.  Was it so obvious?  Or did Brock just know him that well?
“You.  Small hands.  Here,” Tony said, pointing with the leather-gloved hand to his side.  “Ah…chess losers have to wait,” Tony told him, eyes twinkling.  Steve sucked in a breath and tried to hold his face still, though Tony’s smile only grew all the more satisfied as he watched Steve’s efforts.  “There,” Tony said, pointing at Steve.  “You see that?  That’s the face.  Where are my guards?  They’ll tell you.  They were silently pondering it all day.  Does he do that with you?  He does, doesn’t he?  Poor attitude, that.  Why do you think that is, when I have it on good authority that he is being
supplies.  His hunger and thirst sated and almost dry from the breeze clipping across the island and rustling the few, sparse trees, Steve lumbered back down to the beach and donned his tattered clothes.
The alien made some kind of noise, high-pitched, chittering, and sonorous at the same time, like if you combined a whale song, a bird, and a dolphin and maybe threw in some electro-dance beat.  Tony winced at it, frowning, and it hummed at him, soft and low and...soothing? Yeah, soothing, Tony decided. Tony found himself missing the contact of the alien’s hands, though the feeling of being at ease lingered, warming him, making him feel languid and weightless, the way he did when he was flying.  He had a distant thought that it was odd, this feeling, but it was so good, so easy to just fall into, he couldn’t seem to latch on to the question.
“So,” Steve said, totally unsure now what he had done and trying to regroup before Tony fled from his presence for whatever reason, “I just thought that the poster, I mean, well, it should be you, right?  Because you are Iron Man.  You, I mean, not the suit,” and now he was just rambling, but he couldn’t seem to stop himself.  “And I just thought it would be better, you know, if people understood that…that someone who doesn’t have powers or serum or whatever can be a hero with just smarts and guts can be so brave, and…” and oh God, he was just making it worse, wasn’t he?  By the look on Tony’s face, that was a definite yes.  Unable to help himself and trying desperately to explain, Steve went on, “And, I don’t know, it just seemed wrong to only show the suit, but then I figured I should really talk to you and not just Deirdre because maybe you wanted it that way---“ and for Pete’s sake just stop Rogers.  He clamped his jaw shut on whatever other words his brain wanted to supply.
