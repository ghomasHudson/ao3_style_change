“So, he hasn’t contacted you at all since then?” Sherlock frowned across the desk at Lestrade as he slouched further in his seat. His feet pushed against the front edge of Lestrade’s mahogany desk and his right knee brushed a stack of books piled up from the floor.
The detective barely glanced at John from his sprawled out position in the sitting room, yet John could feel the man deducing him silently; figuring out how the other man had slept without the small talk, the inane chatter of more common folk. The daily silent assessment was nearly unbearable, draining whatever energy the nightmares had spared the night before. It brought into clear focus the awkward silence in 221B that hadn’t been there before. John placed the kettle on the stove and fell heavily into one of the dining room chairs. As the water boiled, John’s eyes unfocused and brought him back into his dreams.
“William Sherlock Scott Holmes, your mother is always dying. She is at that hospital at least once every month. I simply
“She is out of town that week.” Sherlock replied flippantly, looking to the side to watch as two freshmen began to yell at one another. “Besides, I don’t want her to clean my house; she will mess up one of my experiments.” Sherlock’s nose scrunched up in distaste and the potential fight ended in a ruckus of laughter.
“I don’t mind you know… The staring I mean.” Sherlock’s eyes widened but he kept them glued to the screen. Every muscle in his body was taught to the point of aching.
Sherlock slid gracefully from his seat, forcing the man to shift out of his way and crane his neck to meet Sherlock’s eye. “Doctor Sherlock Holmes. I teach Biochemical Engineering and Criminal Pathology at John’s University.” The man’s hand twitched as if anticipating a handshake but Sherlock coldly ignored him to turn back to John. To the eyes that were flickering between Sherlock and his father, between appreciation and fear. The man’s brow furrowed in confusion.
“I’m certain I know someone who can take care of that last part and as for a job, I can help you apply.” Sherlock’s eyes widened suddenly. “Actually, Lestrade has been bugging me for a while about hiring a teacher’s aide. You could grade papers for me and handle my emails and the University will be the one signing your checks so you won’t have to worry about being indebted to me or any of that nonsense.”
“You’ve never met my family.” Sherlock replied sullenly. There was a short pause and then Sherlock said, “Goodnight John.”
“Promises are arbitrary, John.” A wrinkle appeared between dark eyebrows and John felt something between a laugh and a sob well up in his throat. As he went to stand up, to figuratively run from this beautifully frustrating apparition, that smooth velvet reached out once more to rub against jagged rock. “But, I will do everything in my power, try every other way, so as not to leave your side ever again. Just,” Sherlock made another distressed sound, his eyes pleading and his grip on John tightening, “don’t leave, please.”
The way your eyes gravitated towards not-quite polite parts of her anatomy indicates you haven’t been intimate as much as usual either; it must be hard finding the time for a proper shag what with conflicting schedules and exhaustingly long hours at work and it must be frustrating that your wife no longer wants to give it up either. The only reason your wife would withhold sex is that she knows, she has to have smelled the perfume on your clothes and with the amount of make up your lover wears she is sure to have left some smudged on your clothing at some point.”
“Thank you for letting me barge into your flat again.” Sherlock watched as Marlowe shifted and began to kneed his paws against John’s leg, purring growing louder at the sound of his voice. Sherlock hummed in acknowledgement and then paused for a moment before reaching out with a foot to nudge at the cat laying across John’s feet.
Sherlock’s face performed several acrobatic feats before he shoved a hand into his trench coat and pulled out his phone.
Of all the things Sherlock expected to deduce about the graduate student when they finally came face to face he hadn’t expected to come across the man passed out on the sofa protecting Sherlock’s cats like his life depended on it. The student’s blonde hair was plastered to his forehead and his mouth hung slightly open. Something akin to gratitude spread across his heart and Sherlock leaned down to place a hand cautiously on the man’s shoulder.
“Listen, I’m… Thanks for letting me crash on your sofa. I didn’t mean to fall asleep.” Sherlock leaned back against the wall behind him, his head hitting with a soft thunk. Allan sat down and began rubbing his head against John’s ankle, purring. Sherlock watched the black cat for a moment and then frowned.
The experiment beneath the floorboards in the corner is, unexpectedly, thriving in the dark conditions despite Sherlock’s nonexistent attention. It had been a possibility, but a highly unlikely one.
Things were beginning to get out of hand. Sherlock shut his eyes. It was never a good sign when his thoughts began to talk over one another. Was he trembling or was the bed shaking?
Marlowe was ecstatic to see John again, the tabby had refused to leave his side since he arrived. The med student assured Sherlock that he had not brought catnip that first visit and would not bring it this time either. Apparently, it wasn’t good for cats to have. Sherlock wondered if this was something John had known before meeting Sherlock or if he had searched the information out afterward. Either way it was best not to read too much into things.
“It’s not like I don’t have a reputation for being a cold asshole.” Sherlock huffed. “Surely, any attempt at being friendly on my end should be an immediate red flag that I’m probably propositioning you.” Lestrade laughed and hit his desk.
John’s tanned skin and thick eyelashes were enough to win anyone over. The fact that he had eyes the color of the ocean’s tide, ever changing according to the weather and current, and toned muscle, that betrayed his high school rugby years, was frankly unfair. And now this gorgeous man was leaning over Sherlock’s frozen body, hands landing on either side of the sofa’s backrest just brushing his shoulders. John’s lips were chapped and pink and closer than Sherlock had dared hope for. Sherlock’s lungs were screaming for air, air that his brain reasoned, was utterly nonexistent save behind those lips. He closed his eyes reluctantly and just as John’s face came close enough for Sherlock to feel each breath two different ringtones echoed off the walls of the flat.
Within two hours Sherlock had John’s confirmation and a bag of necessities packed away for the drive to his parent’s house in the countryside. The words “
When he turned around Marlowe was crouched in front of the door, rear-end wriggling in the air and muscles tensing. The professor gently placed his violin back on its stand and took three quick strides to the door, hurriedly picking Marlowe up just before he tried to leap for the handle once more.
John jerked back, cheeks flaming, and Sherlock felt everything in him on a spiritual level break into pieces and shatter onto the floor. He just barely managed the energy to open his eyes and catch John striding over to the dining room table where he had left his phone.
. Sherlock winced inwardly. Marlowe perked up from the space between them, tail flicking. John hummed. The silence was slowly turning into something awkwardly uncomfortable. Sherlock found himself wishing the commercials would end quickly, John’s eyes burned into his skin, everything felt too close.
be there every time she feels as though she might faint. She always comes back right as rain. Now if you don’t mind I have work to do; unlike some in this family, I do not have the luxury to call in a sick day.” Sherlock bristled but his father turned back to his papers and waved a flippant hand in his direction as he picked up the discarded pen.
“Oh, I do?” Sherlock drawled, rolling his eyes. “What are you going to do if I don’t? Sit on me?” Now it was Sherlock’s turn to flush. As soon as the words left his lips an image of John pushing Sherlock’s chair back and straddling his hips flooded his inner mind and he nearly choked. Sherlock quickly took a sip from his tea, using the cup to hide his expression.
Mycroft’s glares kept the nurses at bay until well past visiting hours as the men watched over their mother. Sherlock held her hand the entire time while his brother shifted between gently moving the hair from her eyes and standing guard at the window and door in turn. Mrs. Holmes did not stir, her only contribution the quiet beeping of machinery; a cold and calculated reassurance that she had not passed.
“I was beginning to wonder if you were mute.” Sherlock replied without looking down. The boy frowned and turned away. “I’m sure your grandfather will be pleased. Not only do you know someone on the plane but you are also sitting right next to them. If something happens you’ll be fine.”
“It’s different; you don’t know my family.” John’s gaze softened but it didn’t leave his phone and the lack of eye contact was grating against Sherlock’s nerves. He reached out and gripped John’s chin with one slender hand, turning it to face him and holding it there firmly until John’s eyes connected with his.
that John actually liked him. Sherlock was a hard to please, hard to befriend, arse of a person and John was like bottled sunlight with just enough grit at the bottom to enhance its shine. He turned away with a grimace as John hung up the phone.
“Sir, with all due respect, I have a medical degree and years of experience working in a hospital.” Sherlock nearly rolled his eyes. The precise calluses worn into the man’s pale hands gave as much away. The doctor looked from Sherlock’s pinched brow and down turned lips to Mycroft’s sullen stare. “I can assure you that we are doing our best to help your mum. She is in the hands of our most skilled physicians.” Sherlock sighed and threw up his hands.
After a second of hesitation Sherlock tentatively clicked the notification. A short paragraph appeared on the screen, neatly formatted like a proper letter, letting him know that John Watson had arrived at his flat and had found the key beneath the mat. Blinking at the message Sherlock tried to decide if it was odd that John had sent him an email simply to tell him he had arrived at Sherlock’s house.
(So sorry about the update being late! I was out of state all last week, visiting my grandparents and I didn't bring my laptop with me. Whoops! Anyways here you go, sorry it isn't longer!)
Sherlock thought as his eyes drifted from the cats to the thighs of the man in front of him. A strange, desperate urge to bite John brought back the flushing urgency to be as close to this man as possible. It was a desire that had begun to settle under Sherlock’s skin back on the couch. His heart was racing, his skin burning, Sherlock pulled back from John and then gently gripped the student’s face pressing their lips together before he changed his mind.
“You’re back a bit late, but I’m only just now making lunch. Do you want a sandwich or something?” John nodded to the stove at his side where a kettle was set to boil. “Tea’s on as well.”
“I wanted to, but Moriarty’s network would have known.” Sherlock’s grip on John tightened just enough to be felt. “Mycroft and I had to make it believable so that Moriarty would let you live. I did it for you, John. I’m not going to apologize for protecting you.” Distress coated the man’s words and John realized with some inactive part of his brain that Sherlock was shaking slightly. He took a deep breath as if steeling himself and then whispered. “I am sorry for the way in which I had to do it. I’m sorry that it took so long to come back to you. But I would do it again if it meant keeping you safe.” Each syllable was like silk, tentatively attempting to smooth over the rough, jagged edges that made up John’s battered heart.
“For a time, I wasn’t sure I could live a life without you.” The previous silence of the room seemed to take on an extra weight. It was as if someone had deposited the two men in a sound proofed room, so deadly silent Sherlock could hear his heart racing, every breath reflected off the window John took. Every syllable of every word came amplified against the backdrop of these sounds. “It wasn’t just the fact that I… That I missed you. It was the way that everything reminded me of you, of our life together. I went to the hospital and I carried on throughout my shift doing the mundane things I do every day, and when I left I couldn’t go home. I knew that the flat would be empty. I knew that I would be ordering Chinese for one, making one cup of tea, sitting alone in this living room where a madman used to sit and sulk and solve impossible murders.”
“It’s normal to sleep at odd times during the day when you’ve spent the entire night studying.” Sherlock shrugged dismissively.
“Oh, let me get that for you.” He said, taking the three strides to her and bending over to grab the few envelopes.
Thankfully the cafe was just tapering off from the lunch rush when John and Sherlock walked in. It was just busy enough not to be uncomfortably quiet and not so busy that the tables went unwashed between customers.
“Studying for an exam.” Sherlock opened his eyes, let his gaze settle somewhere near the floor. Every muscle in his body was tight, he felt the need to escape but he wasn’t sure from what or to where. He tried to picture John, sitting on the sofa back at his flat with Marlowe, highlighting passages in a thick textbook, writing down small thoughts in the margins.
hospitals.” Sherlock spat as Mycroft made himself comfortable in one of the chairs lined against the wall. His brother leaned back and watched as Sherlock began to pace the length of the room agitatedly. An hour passed before Mycroft snapped.
Sherlock lay on his back staring up at the ceiling above him. In one nearly limp hand a cigarette, unlit and unmarred, dangled dangerously between two long fingers. The professor brought up his heavy hand to present the circular object before his eyes. He twirled it between the pads of his fingers in the air before him and he felt his body sink deeper into the bed beneath him. Each twirl of the cigarette, each second he suspended his arm up and in the air, weighed heavier and heavier until the muscles began to tremble and Sherlock at last let his arm fall back beside him. The cigarette fell as well, tumbling onto the carpeted floor uselessly.
“I put an old shirt and a pair of sweatpants on the bathroom counter for you to change into; just leave your clothes in the tub for now.” John opened his mouth as if to argue but the weight in his shoulders seemed to discourage him enough not to argue. With a satisfied nod, Sherlock walked into the kitchen and began searching for his tea pot.
“Well, I’m not going to just send you back home without letting you eat something. There’s a cafe around the corner?” At that John looked up and blinked at the professor. The mold was of little importance outside of Sherlock’s experiments and therefore needed no more explaining. It didn’t hit Sherlock that John’s odd look might be due to his offer to take John to a cafe for lunch until a few moments later. Sherlock shut his laptop a bit more forcefully than he intended and stood up, quickly moving to the front door. “Alright then, come on.” He said, avoiding John’s questioning gaze.
Another hour passed before the flight attendants’ shoulders collectedly relaxed and it was announced that boarding would finally begin for the flight to Ireland. As Sherlock queued for his seat on the plane Eliot glanced at his own ticket and then up at Sherlock.
No one is real. Sherlock read through the very paragraphs of his reply, edited a few typos, and hit send. When it comes down to it the connections we see between ourselves and the people around us is only further proof that it has all come from us. Ten minutes passed and the screen lit up.
“She’s a friend, a year below me in the program. She’s focusing more on autopsies and things, though. I’m more interested in living patients.” John chuckled. Sherlock grinned thinking about the eyeballs at the back of his freezer.
” glared from the midst of John’s email as if highlighted. Sherlock wondered at the answer to that question as a text from his brother previewed at the top of the screen.
It was as if John had been transported to another timeline. He felt as if he were watching from the sidelines, frozen, as his body stood sharply, knocking over the chair, spinning around to grasp at Sherlock’s biceps. His fingers gripped the man’s arms with bruising force as his eyes met the detective’s. Sherlock’s eyes had widened in surprise, his mouth slack. Then John’s arms were tightening around Sherlock’s body, his face pressing firmly against the man’s chest until he found it hard to breathe. Sherlock was wrapping his own arms tightly around the doctor’s body. He had taken up the repetition of John’s name once more, the plea turning into more of a prayer. In this alternate universe John felt tears burning behind his eyes. John could count on one hand the number of times he had let those tears form. This time, he put up no resistance, letting them form in the corners of his eyes and track across what skin they could reach before being absorbed into Sherlock’s shirt.
“Anderson? The secretary?” Sherlock scowled, this time genuinely, his hands fisting a bit unconsciously.
Sherlock was not one to hold anyone’s hand. When the student began to run through his list of excuses Sherlock tuned him out directly and walked the rest of the way to his car planning a very extensive research assignment to spring on the class last minute as punishment. If Sherlock had to listen to this load of shite the man would pay for it with the wrath of his classmates as well.
The nightmares that had woken him that morning. and every morning since Sherlock had strode into the door and crashed onto the couch, falling asleep instantly, flashed behind his eyes as Sherlock continued to stroke through his hair. Pale hands slipping from his own, black hair disappearing into a crowd, a note left on the door telling John not to look for him, all of Sherlock’s things evaporated into thin air, Sherlock lying dead on the pavement, Sherlock riddled with wounds, blood everywhere.
“Are you leaving already?” Mycroft asked, his own gaze holding nothing but judgement and a near-complete lack of interest.
(Hello! I apologize for the short chapter! I've been super busy this week with graduation for my kids at one job and then working a ton of extra hours at my other job. But now school is over! Which means more time to write! I'm so happy people are actually reading this story and to everyone who has left comments and kudos and who has subscribed: THANK YOU! You encourage me to continue posting and it's for y'all that I stayed up till 2am last night to make sure this chapter got finished and could be posted today before I rush off to work!)
The professor hesitated, considering. It wasn’t often his mother spoke, let alone argued for something. If he ignored her now it would just serve to further encourage her lasting silence. Ignoring his mother’s request would certainly not help any with her increasingly frequent suicide attempts. Mycroft opened his mouth to speak just as Sherlock pulled a chair from the table and reluctantly sat down, allowing the duffel to slide to the floor beside his chair. Across the table, Mycroft nodded approvingly and Mrs. Holmes beamed.
“I’m often convinced you are the devil himself in disguise. The only evidence against this conclusion is your utter incompetence and stupidity.” Sherlock turned on his heel and stomped back to the lift without another word.
Instead of leaving Sherlock parks himself on a chair and fiddles with his phone. John is too tired to argue so he flops down next to him and folds his arms on the table as a makeshift pillow but he’s unable to fall asleep. At the sound of a text alert he looks up to see a grin spreading across Sherlock’s face.
Sherlock shakes his head. “You can’t possibly know that. Maybe one day something will happen in my mind palace and everything about you will be gone.”
Only then did I realized that Holmes had not yet released my wrist and I felt my skin tingle beneath his fingertips. I was sure my friend could feel my pulse racing and a blush rose to my cheeks as I remembered what had transpired between us the night before.
John pushes the door open and gasps. Sherlock is nowhere to be seen but the room is full of flickering candles that illuminate a trail of rose petals. John follows them down the hall to Sherlock’s bedroom. The door opens as he reaches it and Sherlock emerges wearing a tight purple shirt and dark slacks that hug his body in all the right places. John lets his eyes slide up and down Sherlock’s lean form barely noticing the single red rosebud in his hand.
He stopped. It had been ages since he’d read to Rosie from his blog. After all, most of Sherlock’s cases weren’t exactly appropriate for a bedtime story. He went through a quick mental check of any Christmas stories on there that didn’t involve murder. There were none.
John walked over and opened the freezer door. Sure enough, Sherlock had somehow managed to make several large icicles grow from the ceiling. One had fused itself to the top of an ice cream container.
As he counted the possible escape routes a murderer could have taken Sherlock felt the wind whip up around him. For a second the body in front of him disappeared and he felt a rush of fear unrelated to his surroundings. The wind twisted itself around his shoulder, bringing with it a dull phantom pain. Then he understood. Something had happened. Somewhere, his
Mycroft returned home to find his front door unlocked and the knocker tilted 45 degrees to the right. He straightened it and entered to find Sherlock lounging at his kitchen table, feet propped up on a chair and eating a cookie from the open tin beside him.
John searched his memory, trying to ignore the thought of his last few Christmases at home. He thought back to ice skating with Harry and secrets shared under the Christmas tree.
There, barely visible behind several bins he sees Sherlock’s slim outline and a mess of dark curls. John breathes a sigh of relief and moves to join him. Then out of the corner of his eye sees a shadow move around the corner. He presses himself against the building and peers out. It’s Winter. And he has a gun.
The name of today’s mystery rose: “Red Soldier” or “Fusilier”. I’m sure you can all figure out who it reminded Sherlock of and why.
After a moment Sherlock hung up and placed a hand on his shoulder. John raised his head and saw that Sherlock's expression was torn between excitement and...something else he couldn't quite decipher.
“Are you going to check that?” Alice asked somewhere around the tenth text alert, “It might be important.”
“For god’s sake I wasn’t lying to her!” John said, “It was just a rose. Where are you even getting this stuff?”
I glanced around at the myriad of lighted symbols. The one closest seemed to be a bright red hand. As I stared, it changed to a white silhouette of a man. Trios of circular lights alternated between green, yellow and red. Other illuminated signs flashed words and phrases in various colours.
Lestrade shrugs. “I wasn’t sure, but Sherlock wanted to come along so I assume he thinks something will happen.”
Once she was asleep John laid back on his bed, staring at the ceiling, watching the flickering shadows from the nightlight.
John lay awake long after Sherlock fell asleep, wondering how many more times he would have to bail Sherlock out, and knowing full well that he would do it for the rest of their lives if he had to.
Chapter 4: "Winter Sports", In which Sherlock goes ice skating for the first time and discovers it’s not as easy as it looks. Lucky for him he has an excellent teacher.
As this continues, John tries to set aside his long-ignored feelings for Sherlock. He reminds himself that this is only temporary and tries to convince himself that even if this is the most that ever happens between them, it will be enough. It’s not, of course. It will never be enough but part of him feels that even this is more than he deserves after all the times he’s pushed Sherlock away. But each night when Sherlock curls up next to him, he finds it harder and harder to keep from imagining the two of them staying like this forever.
They chat about the usual things - potential cases from Lestrade that Sherlock thinks are too boring, an article John read about undetectable poisons which Sherlock now wants to import so he can examine them, and how many of their fellow diners are having affairs.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “How is that supposed to help? It’s not as though eating takes up any brainpower.”
John rushes out the door and Sherlock counts his retreating footsteps. 17 stairs, two extra steps to the front door, the click as it closes, then the silence that seeps into the flat every time John leaves. Sherlock turns to the fridge and catches sight of the calendar John mentioned. Sure enough, he sees a familiar messy scrawl on 29th January that reads, “9am - clinic”. He scowls at the offending paper then tears the page off and throws it in the bin. It’s not as if John will be needing it - January’s almost over anyway.
The card inside had two photos surrounding a simple holiday greeting. The top image showed Rosie twirling in the center of the living room, the new maroon dress Sherlock had bought for the occasion flaring out around her.
“Same alarm system as all the other houses on the street except the one on our left, so same level of difficulty as the other targets. Christmas lights draped over every inch of the roof, add that to the level of upkeep the yard requires - clearly they have enough money that utility costs are not an issue. Probably plenty of valuable trinkets hidden away in there. Light on in the kitchen and second story bedroom at this hour, but no one at the window trying to see what’s going on. Whoever lives there is away for the holidays. Their lights are on a timer. Obvious. Easy and rewarding target.”
John’s mind is only half on the case. Even though they know now that it’s not a love suicide, he can’t help but wonder what could drive people to their death once they’d found someone to live for. Maybe if one of them was facing unavoidable death they might decide to face it together. After all, he’d been prepared to die with Sherlock many times over. Not that they’re...lovers. He glances at Sherlock, expecting to see his eyes closed, long, thin fingers tented below his chin, but instead Sherlock is gazing unseeing at the streets of London blurring past the window, apparently lost in his own thoughts.
Sherlock’s eyes darted between the candle and John. When they’d started bringing Rosie, Angelo had removed the flame for safety, but apparently he’d never stopped thinking of their visits as dates. Now that Sherlock thought about it, he realized John had not protested when being mistaken for a couple for quite some time, but still. There was no need to hear the words and reopen old wounds.
It’s early evening by the time John is discharged. Despite his insistence that he’ll be fine with crutches, Sherlock insists that he stay in the hospital wheelchair all the way to the black car waiting at the curb. Once inside Sherlock sits closer than he normally would and John allows himself to slump sideways in his seat, resting his head gently against Sherlock’s shoulder.
No update tomorrow since I'll be spending time with family, but I'll be back the following day with the next chapter.
“It’s just my ankle,” he says as Sherlock returns to sit by his side, still glaring at Winter. “I don’t think it’s broken, probably just a bad sprain.” He winces as he removes his shoe. Already his ankle is beginning to swell and even in the dim light he can see an ugly bruise forming. “Might not be a bad idea to get it checked out though,” he admits.
When there was no answer, John pushed open the door and smiled when he saw Rosie fast asleep, surrounded by a dozen or so stuffed animals. Then his heart fluttered as he turned toward his own bed and saw Sherlock’s long, slim form stretched out on top of the covers, his head turned to the side, cheek nestled into the pillow. He watched the slow rise and fall of Sherlock’s breath in the dim glow of Rosie’s nightlight and felt the urge to crawl into bed with him, to hold him and never let go.
Greg wouldn’t have worried, but it was Sherlock, and mad, unpredictable things always seemed to happen when he was involved. He half-listened to Rosie talking about the different shapes and colours of the leaves and let out a sigh of relief when Sherlock’s tall form came back into view.
“If you are not averse to a bit of adventure so late in the evening I should enjoy your company, Watson.”
John lay in the middle of the grassy field, listening to the strains of music drifting past on the gentle breeze while he waited for practice to start. The sound was slightly muffled by the headphones covering his ears but he’d learned that it was easier to explain the far away look on his face to his teammates if he pretended he was listening to the latest hits rather than admitting he was listening to music on the wind that only he could hear. He only hoped that no one asked to borrow his walkman because in truth there was nothing in there.
paper money. It was starting to look like the Garridebs case was connected to another case DI xxxxxxxx was working on. You know those reports in the paper about the counterfeit bills popping up across London? Yup, turns out that her client, Jonathan Evans (not his real name obviously) was involved with this somehow.
“Roses are so lovely,” she says, carefully snipping the stems at precise 45 degree angles, “They really brighten the place up.”
“If I remember correctly, you and your sister were forced to wear horrible matching outfits in yours.”
Without warning, he lunges toward Winter, who is sitting up scowling at the handcuffs on his wrists.
Evans gave a small shake of his head before speaking into the phone once more. “It’ll be fine. Just bring him out.”
“I thought it would be obvious.” Sherlock says as he reaches out to take one of John’s hands in his own.
“Have your least idiotic officers search the area. And make sure Molly does the autopsy. You know where to find me.”
, John. The roses. You prefer this one don’t you.” Sherlock nods at the yellow rose. John glances between it and the orange one from yesterday which is still sitting on the far corner of the table. He’s uncomfortably aware of Sherlock hovering behind him, glaring.
“Back where?” John mumbles and tries to burrow into the couch cushions where he hopes he’ll be able to fall back asleep.
“Cynthia,” was all he had time to say before a slim blonde woman in a short, red dress greeted John with a hug and started chattering away about how adorable Rosie looked in her costume and how her own daughter was so excited to be onstage and oh, there’s a couple of seats over there and John should come sit with her.
For several minutes, they lay there, just breathing. They’re so close, but with an infinite gap between them.
He’s brought abruptly back to the present when his phone buzzes with an incoming text. It’s Lestrade asking if John’s doing okay and if Sherlock is there. When John replies in the affirmative to both questions, Lestrade asks if he can please send Sherlock over to the Yard to give his statement.
The way John’s hand lingered on his shoulder when rousing him from some experiment or other, the way he didn’t pull back when Sherlock grabbed his hand to lead him through the dark London streets on yet another midnight chase.
They’d both had money problems and had no close friends or family but nothing really jumped out at us. That is, until we learned that the last property Miss Saunders sold was purchased with cash - not just paid in full with a check or bank transfer, but
“He sent you, didn’t he? Queensberry?” Ross said, glancing around as though expecting the man to materialize beside us. “You’re known to be a fair man, Mr. Holmes. If you know what that man has done surely you will not take his side.”
“It’s extraordinary!” he exclaimed as we passed a young man who was talking into what we had concluded was a sort of portable telephone, “We must have jumped forward at least a century!”
So, apparently Christmas came early for Sherlock this year in the form of Michael Davies. Or rather, his corpse.
Sherlock fell silent and stared down at his hands. It was a fair point - murder wasn’t generally an acceptable topic of conversation outside of select circles, but John’s words had hit home.
“What?” Sherlock asks, then he drops his gaze to the carpet, “Oh. I thought this is what you wanted. All the signs of sexual arousal were there no matter how hard you tried to hide them.”
John froze, suddenly aware of how close Sherlock was standing. They were almost shoulder to shoulder, John still facing the mirror. If he turned, their arms would surely brush. As it was he could feel Sherlock’s breath ruffling his hair. He wondered if his friend could hear his heart pounding against his ribcage or see the rapid flutter of his pulse.
Sherlock raised his gaze to John’s face. The sound of his heart beating in his chest and the whisper of their skates cutting into the ice seemed to drown out the chatter of the crowd around them as he concentrated on the deep blue-green of John’s eyes.
Undoubtedly, Prescott knew what he was building but he’d been paid well to keep his silence. In the end though, he started asking questions so Winter decided to make absolutely sure he wouldn’t talk and to take care of Elizabeth Saunders at the same time before she discovered her role the creation of the counterfeit money she deposited as payment. He figured it would be easy enough to make it look like a suicide and gave them false identities to throw the police off the trail for long enough to get out of town.
John chuckles, thinking of how Sherlock seems like a walking GPS in the streets of London but hands him a map and demands that he navigate every turn when they drive out for a case in the unfamiliar countryside.
Sherlock refuses to leave John’s side or answer any questions about the case. When the ambulance arrives he insists that he be allowed to accompany John to the hospital.
“Seriously, Sherlock you can’t keep doing this,” John said, gesturing vaguely in the direction of the station as Sherlock strode down the sidewalk, fingers still flying as he tapped out another text.
“Take care, John.” Lestrade says, resting a hand briefly on his shoulder, “I’ll look in on you tomorrow.”
He trailed off and for a moment they both stood there, frozen. John took a steadying breath then continued, “When I want it more than anything.”
“You need to get out there, girl,” Meena had told her, “You know, Tinder is a thing right? There’s thousands of men in the sea.”
But the feelings that drifted back to him on the last quivering notes of his most recent composition were far too human. He knew then that this was the person his mother spoke of when she told him his music would save a life and he prayed that one day fate, or circumstance, or whatever forces of the universe existed, would bring them together.
There’s the way Sherlock constantly deduces irrelevant things about John’s day - like which street he walked down on his way to the shops. That in itself wouldn’t be unusual if not for the frequency he does it and the way he looks to John for confirmation before looking away, as if he’s afraid he got it wrong. There’s the constant questions about John’s past - what it was like growing up with Harry, what caused them to grow apart, and if he wishes things were different. There’s the way he stares at Rosie when she plays with her favourite soft toy in the shape of a basset hound. There’s his recitation of how he proved Mrs. Hudson’s late husband was guilty and the way he bites his lip when he asks her if that’s the way she remembers it.
An uncomfortable silence fell across the room, in which I imagined the man in front of me facing a jury as the accused rather than accuser, for he was surely a more immoral person than the man whose reputation he had destroyed. To my great relief Holmes emerged from his thoughts before Queensberry attempted again to engage me in conversation.
Molly opened the door to her flat with a sigh and shook the snow from her coat. It had been a long day, followed by a tedious evening out with a group of her old school mates. It wasn’t that she didn’t enjoy spending time with them - she just didn’t need the constant reminder that she was almost 40 and still single. Jenny’s boyfriend had proposed the week before (What was it about people getting engaged during the holidays?) and the entire night, the conversation had alternated between talk about the upcoming wedding and speculating about when “Little Miss Perfect” would finally find a man.
The bottom one was a photo of all three of them. Rosie was in John’s arms, laughing as Sherlock pointed to something out of view. Sherlock seemed to be explaining something to her, but John’s gaze was on Sherlock, his eyes alight, a smile spreading across his face.
Before Sherlock could figure out how that sentence was supposed to end, the audience lights dimmed and the group of children by the door scurried to their places.
Chapter 3: "All dressed up", In which John and Sherlock attend Rosie's Christmas play and Sherlock realizes that being a parent isn't limited by blood.
This is unchartered territory. They’ve spent the night together in the same room many times, of course. Multiple cases in the English countryside, tiny inns and certain
Lestrade takes the papers back and nods. “There is a connection though. You know that counterfeit case I’ve been working on?”
With a shake of his head, Sherlock brings himself back to the case. “So they chose this place,” he says, “Then what? How did they do it?”
Then John laces their fingers together and whispers all the things he wants Sherlock to remember when waking. As he does, his mind replays everything in their past, good and bad, that has brought them to this point. As he reaches the end of his list he finds the courage to finally add one more thing - something he should have said weeks, months, maybe years ago.
“Why?” Sherlock asked, but didn’t wait for an answer before settling at John’s side and following his gaze upward.
“John, have you got any cash?” Sherlock asks as they turn away from the warehouse. He had refused to get in the police car with Lestrade and now they’ve got at least a ten minute walk to a road that will likely have a cab.
Holmes fell silent, fingers steepled beneath his chin, hesitating for the briefest of moments. Then he placed both hands on my face and brought his lips to mine.
John sighs. “Come on,” he tugs on his arm and to his relief, Sherlock allows himself to be lead down the hall to his bedroom.
Sherlock thought he was being rather inconspicuous about it as well until John huffed a laugh and turned to him at a commercial break about halfway through.
“Thank you, love. You should put some ice on that bruise, dear.” She frowned and tutted as her eye caught the bruise on his arm. Mrs. Hudson opened her mouth to say something but then shook her head and gave a short sigh. “Well, I’m glad to see you and Sherlock spending time together. You’ll be good for each other.” She all but giggled the last part, reaching out to give John’s cheek a cheerful, if carefully delicate, pat. Before either man could process the implication behind her statement she disappeared back into her flat, leaving behind the smell of brewing tea and biscuits.
“Ah, Sherlock, welcome back. Where is your mother and Mycroft?” Unlike his son, Mr. Holmes had no problems with letting the grey in his hair remain visible. He wore the wear and tear of his age like a badge of honor. It was another sign of proof that he was wiser, more capable, and more knowledgeable about anything of consequence than those around him. The desk he sat at was immaculately clean, nothing but a stray pen and a thick stack of papers marring the surface. Everything else was placed neatly off to the side in an organizer or holder. The monitor at one corner was thin and sleek, taking up as little space as possible. Sherlock was not surprised in the least to see his father in a dress shirt and suit pants though he would not have left the house all day.
“Sherlock,” He corrected. “The first day I met you, you were asleep on my sofa and when I woke you up you immediately reached under your pillow for a weapon. The speed of your reaction means it is still a reflex you rely on currently. The size of that imprint on your arm and the circumference of your black eye indicate a male opponent. Since you were wearing nothing but a t-shirt and an old pair of jeans, and the fact that it has been raining since 10am this morning, you had to have left from your house. So, unless I was wrong that day and you have a considerably older brother, you still live at home with your father who regularly verbally abuses you judging from your reluctance to let me do things for you, and occasionally physically abuses you.” Sherlock gestured with one hand to indicate John’s physical state. “The way you barely wince when you drank that tea, even with a split lip, means you have to deal with the sting often. You barely paused or shifted at all to find a comfortable position despite your favoring of your right leg, almost as if you are used to sitting in a way that minimizes discomfort from bruises.”
Rain lashed against the windows of Sherlock’s flat, adding a constant static sound to the keening of his violin. Marlowe had hidden himself somewhere in the flat as soon as the storm clouds had started smudging the London sky and Allan had perched himself on a hard won, miraculously empty, space on the half wall between the living room and kitchen. The black kitten’s tail flicked left to right as his green eyes studied the professor’s profile.
“Yeah, no…” John stammered, wishing he knew how to exit this conversation, “I mean, I already have...someone.”
When I returned to Baker Street at nightfall Holmes was nowhere to be found but a tray of food was laid upon the table along with a hastily scrawled note.
Sherlock nodded and drew the bow across the strings again. It wasn’t exactly a holiday song but it was something a little more melodic to fill the silence while they waited for their guests to arrive. As John added another log to the fireplace, Sherlock drifted into one of his own compositions.
Sherlock wasn’t sure the thumb he watched slide across the screen was his, the hand that brought that phone up to his ear definitely did not seem to be his even if logic dictated that it was.
“Yes, he did mention that.” The professor said slowly. The man’s face flushed, his teeth grinding together.
“If we’re agreed then, that this stays between us I mean, I’d like to drop it now.” Sherlock frowned but nodded his head. He nearly winced as the cliché
“That isn’t right, there are plenty of decent fathers out there. We just ended up on the wrong side of the fence; our grass is a bit browner than the other patch.” A few more moments of silence passed between the pair, before it was broken by a soft laugh.
When the last note had died, Sherlock stood frozen, bow still poised above the strings, face still set in lines. John is the one who made the first move this time. He takes the few short strides to Sherlock, his hands rising to take that brilliant, arrogant face in his hands, to rub his fingertips over those unearthly cheekbones and cupid’s bow lips. The kiss that follows that tentative touch is awkward at first and then unbearably intimate. Not in the fire or passion or urgency behind it but the pressure and simplicity of John’s lips finally pressing against Sherlock’s. Sherlock could not have contained the small whimper that sounded deep in his throat at the contact if he had tried.
As a sidenote, Molly deserves to be happy too. Not that she needs a man for that, but she needed more than the
He turned and climbed the stairs to his and Rosie’s bedroom. Sherlock had taken her up to bed after she’d fallen asleep on the couch and hadn’t yet returned. John suspected that he’d decided to use it as an opportunity to remove himself from the festivities. He paused to listen at the door. No sounds of a bedtime story or the conspiratorial whispers that Rosie and Sherlock often shared when it was his turn to tuck her in.
I was having a bit of technical difficulties uploading this chapter so sorry if you got more than one notification if you've subscribed.
“Apparently you set this thing up somewhere in your house and it’s supposed to watch your kid to make sure they’re being good.”
Sarah was a lovely girl - kind, funny, attractive and wonderfully intelligent. Since they were both pre-med, she and John shared many of their classes and became fast friends. So when she expressed her interest, John hesitated only for the briefest moment before asking her out to dinner.
John smiles. “Come on, Sherlock. It’s your experiment. The data is all in front of you. Figure it out.”
Everyone in Sherlock’s village made magic with their music. Some of the most powerful musicians were known to slice through rough seas with a song, calm a tornado with the sound of a flute, or literally make the earth move, raising boulders with a drum beat.
Meaning of Green Roses: renewal of life and energy; new beginnings. They are also perfect for someone who is embarking on a new venture, or recovering from a stint of illness.
The words tumbled from Sherlock’s mouth before he could stop them, before he could even think. It was the wine and Molly’s stupid words of encouragement and the way the fire and Christmas lights illuminated John’s face, making him feel like anything was possible. And now he’d gone and ruined everything. He heard John’s sharp, surprised breath and pushed himself up, showering them both in pine needles. He was halfway across the room before he heard John scramble to his feet.
One more quick update before the end of the year. Not sure if anyone will still be interested in reading a Christmas fic in January but I do plan on finishing this.
Mycroft turned it over. The wrapping paper had dancing reindeer on it. No doubt John had let Rosie pick the design, but the neat folds in the paper told him that Sherlock had been the one to do the wrapping. He opened it to find a thick knitted scarf with alternating red and green stripes and found a smile creeping across his face in spite of himself.
They both knew John’s words were an empty threat, that no matter how many ridiculous things Sherlock did, John would always be there to bail him out of whatever mess he got himself into. Not because followed with blind devotion, but because he was addicted to the excitement that came when he allowed himself to be swept up in Sherlock’s insane life.
Sherlock is kneeling, a flashlight gripped between his lips as he runs his hands across the floor. John crouches down and joins him, using the light from his phone to aid their search. The dust is much thinner here and John realizes that they’re looking for a hidden compartment or trap door. He wouldn’t have expected to find one in a warehouse, but he supposes this falls under Sherlock’s theory of “when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”
you arse!” John only shook his head and laughed harder. Sherlock grabbed his plate from the floor, picked up his laptop, and strode over to the sofa.
“What? No, not really.” John’s eyes shifted from Sherlock’s at that last part and the professor’s brow furrowed.
Lost in the forced recap of last night’s dreams, he failed to hear Sherlock approach him. In his mind’s eye those feet were gliding away from him. Those fierce blue eyes staring at John as the man he loved, that he had killed for, that he would gladly die for, walked off the building’s edge. The feel of a million arms tearing his fingers away from Sherlock’s wrist, wrestling him away from the man sprawled across the pavement, burned his skin. The sharp metallic tang of blood filled his nostrils until he felt he was breathing it into his body. John jumped, eyes wide, as a slender hand fell onto his shoulder.
“Were you going to leave without saying goodbye?” Sherlock glanced at Mr. Holmes, standing in the doorway to the dining room in his suit. He had tucked his hands into his front pockets, thumbs out a display of dominance, and was slightly puffing out his chest as if unconsciously trying to make himself appear larger. The man had also positioned himself square in the middle of the doorway, blocking both exit and entrance.
“Not in particular…” John took a deep breath, held it for a moment, and then slowly let it out. “I’m not sure why I called, if I’m being honest. Just can’t sleep for some reason.” Sherlock smirked and huffed out a short laugh.
“You’ve got to eat that first though.” He said with a grin. Sherlock raised an eyebrow at the med student.
“It seems to me that we are all making a fuss over something of little to no consequence. I’ll be the first to admit I am not the most self-aware person to have graced England, however, that is no reason to bring in a psychiatrist. I can personally assure you that I will be just as safe at home with my husband and my maid than anywhere else you may think to put me. Did they not find me where I had fallen and bring me to the hospital in record time? Both of my sons have driven all the way here to be at my side for this minor visit; if I was having issues with my mental state I have no doubts that they would be at my side at a moment’s notice.” The doctor shifted uncomfortably and looked over both Mycroft and Sherlock in turn.
“Sure.” Sherlock said after a second. John gestured to the, still untouched sandwich in front of him.
“I have nothing to talk about.” Sherlock sighed at last, tearing his eyes from his mother to the ones looking back at him through the mirror. “I’m not going to fill the silence with inane small talk just to make you comfortable. Just put on the radio.” Mycroft held his gaze for a moment or two before returning to the abandoned road. The car fell back into silence.
“I couldn’t look Greg in the face for a few solid weeks after they drug me away from your side. It was too much to know that if I looked in his face I would see nothing but pity. We wouldn’t go to the bar to talk about how brilliantly you had solved this case or that or to laugh over something odd you had done without realizing it. No, we would sit down and drink beer and he would want to reminisce about how you
“Hey! Bugger off.” Sherlock scolded Allan quietly, snatching his sandwich and taking a large bite. The cat meowed pitifully and rolled over onto his back in feigned innocence. Sherlock merely rolled his eyes and opened his laptop again, scrolling back to the place he had left off. When John returned, in the now dry clothes he had arrived in, he merely plopped down on the sofa beside Sherlock and leaned back, closing his eyes.
A good hour had passed in silence as John sipped at Sherlock’s tea and cuddled his cats, Sherlock trying to deduce what had happened without staring too obviously, before John spoke. Without looking away from the empty space on the wall he had been staring at, John took a deep breath and then slowly let it out.
It was hard not to stare at the man he had spent so little time with walking about his flat like he lived there. John quickly ran the towel through his hair and then walked into Sherlock’s bedroom like he had been changing in there for years. When he came back out, tussled, still bruised and tired looking from an obvious fight, he walked directly to the sofa and curled into a ball at one end. Marlowe and Allan seemed to have accepted him just as thoroughly as they had Sherlock, one curling at his feet while the other bullied their way into his lap. Sherlock made sure to use matching, unchipped, and unstained cups when he poured the tea.
The frayed edge of the corner of the old man’s jacket and the boy’s converse shoes marked the pair as middle class. The older man was clearly the younger man’s grandfather due to his tone and vague protective stance. He could have been the boy’s father save for the relaxed set of the boy’s shoulders and the older man’s lack of hyper vigilance and willingness to talk to and even sit with a stranger. The boy was holding a boarding pass while the old man held a simple slip of paper meaning he was only accompanying the younger boy to the gate.
“I can sleep on the couch; I rarely ever make it to the bed anyways.” John blinked at him and then laughed. His cheeks flushed and he looked away, mouth working a bit before he finally spoke.
“You sent me a rather distasteful email this morning. I think you may have confused me with a different professor.” Anderson looked up at Sherlock as innocently as they could manage and after a short silence Sherlock huffed angrily and leaned towards the desk. “You can’t mean to tell me that in less than a month I am supposed to be boarding a plane to some conference in Ireland to give a lecture that I have absolutely no time to prepare for.”
“Please, what?” Sherlock’s voice was nearly a growl, almost unrecognizable to himself. John moaned and within moments the pair were stumbling their way out of their clothing and into Sherlock’s bed. They filled the room with the whisper of skin against skin and fumbling hands, the gasping of breath and the whispered names of two men discovering one another and growing closer than either thought possible. They twisted together as the moon crossed the sky and slept in each other’s arms as the sun regained its territory. When they had both awoken John stood in the kitchen with his phone, watching the screen light up with several missed calls. Sherlock crossed the linoleum to wrap his arms around the blonde man’s waist.
“Sir? Is anyone sitting there?” Sherlock startled and looked up to see an old man gesturing at the seats across from his, blocked off by Sherlock’s long legs stretched into the aisle. A young boy, maybe twelve or thirteen, stood just behind him looking anywhere but at Sherlock or the old man.
As the ending credits of the show scrolled past the screen John cleared his throat. “Well, I think it’s time for me to go.” Sherlock looked up as John stood from the sofa. Marlowe jumped from the back of the sofa and landed on the floor, walking to John and rubbing against his legs. “I’m going to miss these cats.” He said smiling fondly at the tabby.
“I’ll see you on campus.” John offered lamely after a too long pause. He took the payment, gathered his book bag and the small duffel bag with his clothes and other items, and then let himself out the door. As the latch clicked behind him Sherlock sank into the sofa and let out a long sigh.
Sherlock heard Allan before he saw him. As soon as the professor had put his key in the lock he had heard a loud meow from within the flat. Small claws had just set to an attempt to ruin the bottom of the front door when Sherlock pulled it out of the cat’s reach. The small black kitten fell back to all fours and then meowed happily as he latched himself onto Sherlock’s pant leg instead.
He had pulled it out when the flight attendant at their gate had announced their plane was delayed, to check for further information, however, the email just below the one he was looking for caught and held his attention first. The sender was an artificially generated University email and since it was a strand of numbers and not a nightmare inducing mix of abbreviations and shortenings of names it was a student email. But how did a student get his personal email?
Everyone came to University these days expecting to be spoon fed information and given reminders every few hours with instructions on what to do and how to do it. No one wanted to think for themselves or create their own schedule. Without parents to wake them up when they slept through their alarms, students expected their professors to make special exceptions for tardiness due to hang overs and laziness. They wanted to party all weekend and then be given extra time to catch up on the homework they should have done instead.
“How many times do I have to tell you, I’m not as nice as you seem to assume I am? I wouldn’t give my left hand to save Anderson’s life, I’d be more willing to give up my sight than do a favour for anyone, and I give my students research essays as a punishment for annoying me.” Sherlock leaned back to glare into John’s eyes. “I’m asking you because I
It wasn’t that Sherlock lacked enthusiasm to share his deductions and the reasoning behind his knowledge; Sherlock desperately wanted to jump into the list of things he had noticed as soon as he had opened his door to see John standing in the hall. But, it had been a little over a week since Sherlock had last seen John and when he imagined that indescribably handsome face twisting into scorn or those lips forming the all too familiar word “freak” his stomach flipped and twisted up to crowd against his ribs.
There would barely be a pause before his thumb clicked on the email as it popped up. A short paragraph or two would fill the screen, sometimes only a few sentences. At first Sherlock found a picture of one or both of his cats at the end of the emails but, occasionally, after the third day the man he had hired would pop up in the photos as well. It started off with a lap or an arm, maybe a hand, but the day before Sherlock left to come home the man had sent an actual selfie with Allan perched on his shoulder. There was no describing the eyes that crinkled into the lens of the camera or the way John’s smile, tight and controlled yet genuine, tightened the muscles of Sherlock’s heart and lungs. He had quickly closed the picture and abandoned his phone on the nightstand for the rest of the evening.
The two men ended up turning to the television once again. A new episode of the show they had watched that first night was airing. As the men fought demons both within and without them on screen Sherlock found himself spacing out. His mind’s eye wandered until it found itself picturing John, in army green with all of the equipment, shooting shadowy figures in the darker alleyways of London. Or, given his major, perhaps the student would be running through bursts of gunfire and debris to reach the wounded of either side; patching up wounds and performing amputations regardless of the color on the men’s sleeves.
“Next you’ll be telling me Doctor Lestrade is the most competent and intellectual professor on staff.” Sherlock scoffed as he sat down on the sofa in a huff. John sat opposite him, in what was quickly becoming
There was decidedly too much of his brain dedicated to hypothesizing the feel and taste of them, the sound they would make sliding against skin, sliding against his skin, how they would look if John bit him. Sherlock stood up abruptly at that mental image, startling Marlowe, who had settled on the back of the sofa between them, and shook his head. He quickly walked to his briefcase, thrown somewhere by the door, and began pulling out his laptop. Sherlock allowed himself exactly three seconds to think about setting up next to John, with that errant foot pressed against his leg, before he hastily booted up the laptop and poured himself into reading every word of the essays he had just gotten in from his students the other day.
John turned to the side and walked to the window. His hands gripped the sill as he leaned forward to press his forehead against the chilled glass. Sherlock watched as John’s eyes closed, as his breath fogged the window. Rain steadily knocked against the opposite side of the window, as if attempting to draw John’s attention from the man behind him. The man who had finally gathered courage he wasn’t aware he lacked to bring up the assumptions he had made about the pills, the scotch, and the gun.
“Enough,” Sherlock sat straighter in his chair as Mrs. Holmes began to speak for the first time since waking. It was rare for him to hear her voice so clearly and, as horrible as it made him feel afterwards, he rather looked forwards to the few times when someone provoked her over the scars and bandages she did so little to hide. It was always when someone came to her supposed rescue that Sherlock and Mycroft’s mum seemed most in control of herself and steadfast. Her shoulders set back in a pose to challenge Achilles, her chin held high in defiance, her slim hands rested one atop the other as if it were not a hospital bed but a throne that she sat upon.
“Doct-Sherlock… I don’t know what kind of research you’ve done on me but I’m impressed.” Sherlock frowned, his brow furrowing deeply. He opened his mouth but John shook his head, looking down at the cat laid in his lap instead of the man at the other end of the sofa. “I guess I shouldn’t be surprised you would look me up. I mean we didn’t get a chance to meet at all or even talk that much before you let me basically live in your flat for a week.” John’s mouth twisted down and he winced. “But, you can’t tell anyone what you just said. Whatever else you found out about me; you can’t tell anyone.”
They had nearly made it back to their parent’s house when Mycroft’s eyes flicked to the back seat through the rearview mirror. “Your silence is becoming a bit unnerving; if you have something to say just say it.” In the passenger seat Mrs. Holmes watched the trees and brush pass by with a vacant expression. Sherlock wondered vaguely if she even saw the scenery.
“I guess it’s actually time for me to go home now.” The man sighed as Sherlock paused from his grading to look up.
“I have work to do.” It wasn’t exactly a lie. Though, the work Sherlock had to do to prepare for lectures Monday could wait until later that night and all his grading for the last assignment was done and submitted. The professor spent most of the Summer outlining and planning his lectures and assignments in-between the few Summer courses he taught and so the only prep left was a few tweaks or additions. Mrs. Holmes frowned.
Allan stood up from his spot at John’s feet and hopped off the sofa, stalking towards the kitchen as Marlowe watched from John’s lap. John’s fingers repeatedly threaded through Marlowe’s thick fur as Sherlock’s eyes followed the movement, sorting through what John had said.
“Hello,” Sherlock said after a too long pause, finally shutting the door behind him as an excuse to look away from the man. John turned back to the counter where he had a few sandwich ingredients neatly spread over the counter. He had been making a sandwich with just his right-hand instead of putting Marlowe down and using both like any normal person. Sherlock was definitely
The room feel deadly quiet. Dr. Grundy simply stared at the professor in shock, Mycroft offered no noticeable reaction, Mrs. Holmes looked from her son to the doctor and then back to Sherlock.
Sherlock, of course, acted as if nothing had happened; save for the few brief moments in which he seemed to acknowledge that something was still not okay between John and himself. Even these brief acknowledgements were in their own way flippant.
John thought he would die when it finally, fully hit him that Sherlock was dead. He hadn’t eaten or slept for days. John had avoided contact with other people for the first full week, locking himself in Sherlock’s room and burying his head into the prat’s pillows and blankets. When John finally realized just how desperately and easily and naturally he had loved Sherlock Holmes it was like losing him all over again. It was all John could do to hold himself together as he had sobbed longer than he thought humanly possible. At times, it had felt as if every piece of him would just implode, choosing self-destruction as opposed to life without the crazed detective.
“I assure you, she will be well looked after. My father has an office at home and they have a maid that lives with them.” The doctor’s frown deepened and Mycroft’s forced smile tightened.
“Are you going to have a drink with us before bed?” His mother asked quietly as Sherlock continued to push around the food on his plate.
Sherlock scoffed and tossed his phone onto the sofa as he continued pacing across the floor of his living room. He hadn’t stopped thinking over his and George’s conversation earlier that day, running it over and over in his head, tearing each sentence apart and reconstructing it. Sherlock looked over at the side of the sofa he had not sat in since that first night John had curled so perfectly into the corner to watch television with him.
“Doctor Sherlock Holmes.” Eliot seemed to perk up at Sherlock’s title, suddenly not as interested in the convenience store down the aisle though not yet looking near the two older men.
Sherlock opened his mouth, another argument on his tongue and a point about how John’s current state was only more proof that his father was abusing him rested just behind it but when he saw John’s shoulders tense and tremble almost imperceptibly his jaw clicked shut.
When Sherlock returned to his hotel, the cheapest and most appalling one nearest to the hospital chosen simply so that his brother would not follow, he sat at the edge of his bed and stared at the door for a long moment. Closing his eyes, he cleared his thoughts of all the cobwebs that had collected throughout the day. Sherlock pushed and shoved and deleted until nothing but empty, malleable space remained, and then he started with the smell of biscuits.
The game is not as fun when one has found something that cannot be taken as fun while playing it. Two children playing hide and seek cease to play the game at the local park when one of them nearly falls into a pit. A man stops playing beer pong when he nearly dies from alcohol poisoning while playing it. Sherlock has decided to stop playing “find the differences” around the flat when he finds the next thing that changes his assumptions of John’s life during his death. Really, Sherlock realizes he should have quit playing when he deduced the thing with the gun. But, some people must learn things the hard way.
“I’ve pulled her records and Prescott’s,” Lestrade says, waving a hand at the stacks of files on the table. “Maybe we’ll find something.”
“Oh!” Mrs. Thompson looked both satisfied and disappointed at the same time. “Well of course you do, dear. I keep telling my Millie that she needs to hurry up and settle down before all the good men are gone.”
Greg stepped into the coffee shop and shook the rain from his coat. It has been a miserable week, what with the usual increase in thefts around the holidays and a still-unsolved missing person case.
“Relax, John, we were in Lestrade’s conference room the whole time. Actually, I think it helped having Rosie there. She seemed more willing to talk than at the previous meeting.”
He doesn’t write about how Sherlock’s eyes dance beneath closed eyelids, searching for an old memory or a place to store a new one. He doesn’t write about the way his lips part slightly, mouthing the names of suspects or poisons. He doesn’t write about the flex of Sherlock’s fingers as he flicks through an almost forgotten file, or the way his left hand twitches as if to shoo away a fly when he’s deleting a bit of information.
John’s blush deepened a shade or two and the wetness in his eyes came back. “I appreciate it, really, Sherlock. I wish I could but he would
Sherlock's hand froze on the handle as he stared silently into the drawer deducing these minuscule details and forming assumptions. The click of the front door opening snapped Sherlock back into the present. He quickly shut the drawer and turned on his heel, striding over to the couch and throwing himself down on it. As footsteps sounded up the stairs Sherlock threw an arm over his face and let his body go limp, praying John would assume he had been like that for a while.
Sherlock, please.” The whisper was enough to bring Sherlock’s attention from bruising the man’s shoulder with bites and kisses.
“You’re loony.” The professor accused. John merely laughed and even slightly distorted through the line between them Sherlock thought it was a lovely laugh.
“I’m not that hungry.” John nodded and turned away glancing around the room that he had spent the last week staring at.
“I don’t live here any longer. You don’t own me or my mother and you’ve never had a hope of owning Mycroft.” Sherlock growled. Mr. Holmes’ eyes narrowed.
Sherlock groaned even louder and threw an arm over his face. He supposed Lestrade couldn’t have known Sherlock had been on the verge of sleep, nevertheless, he was still tempted to suspect Gerard of some sort of evil treachery.
sit down; you’re going to make me throw up.” Sherlock rolled his eyes and nearly earned himself a slap from Mycroft’s umbrella when the brothers were interrupted by the return of one of mummy’s doctors. Both men snapped to attention as the doctor looked down at his chart and then back up at the two men.
“Sherlock?” John’s voice rang through the silence of the apartment as the door to their flat opened. Sherlock tracked John’s movement through the sound of his bag hitting the floor and shoes being kicked off just inside the entry way. The waver in John’s voice, the uncertainty there, was not new. It had been there in the slight hesitation of John’s tone since the first time he had uttered it upon Sherlock’s return. Yet the detective had missed it just the same. A wave of guilt crashed against the shore of Sherlock’s consciousness; the brilliant detective that couldn’t recognize the lingering grief in his flat mate’s heart.
“I guess, she and I have something in common then.” He murmured. John turned a confused smile on Sherlock.
“Surely you can stay a bit longer. At least until breakfast is over.” Sherlock blinked at his mother.
Two weeks later Sherlock found himself sulking in a leather upholstered chair in the corner of Lestrade’s office. Lestrade had barely looked up from his laptop and the various documents spread across his desk when Sherlock dragged himself into the professor’s office. After a few silent moments of sulking he had sighed loudly to get the doctor’s attention and then recounted everything that had happened between him and John, from the night he had gotten home from the lecture to what had happened in the cafe. Sherlock told Lestrade about the strange daily updates and the pictures attached, about the fact that John had fought with his father before appearing at Sherlock’s flat, and how he was later dragged from the cafe by the man but he skipped past the bruises and the black eye.
“Really now, must you pick a fight with every person you meet?” Sherlock yanked his arm from his brother’s grasp and gave his best pout. The electric overhead lights seemed brighter than the sun shining through the wide windows; amplified by the polished steel and tile covering the entirety of the private waiting room. There was not a hint of color, as if even a glimpse of blue or green would breed disease and mayhem like a cracked petri dish. The magazines on the side tables boasted trendy new diets and tips on how to gain muscle quickly through simple workouts. A single plant, some muted dark green color, seemed to wilt in the corner beside the door.
Despite the loudly fleeing cat and the ball of black fur trying to stealthily reach the sandwich Sherlock had placed on the coffee table Sherlock’s attention was captured entirely by the man sitting opposite him. It was strange, this feeling he had around John. No one else had ever held Sherlock’s interest for more than a moment or two. The only reason he and Lestrade were as close as they were, was due to the other professor’s complete lack of shame. Lestrade had spent a solid year hounding Sherlock with questions about lectures, test and quizzes, emails from the school, and invites to lunch and drinks when he was first brought on as a professor. But, this man, who had not even completed his Doctorate, had only to appear at Sherlock’s door and the professor was hooked.
A minute passed and then five and Sherlock strode over to his room and knocked on the door. When there was no answer he opened the door to find John crumpled on the floor, face buried in Allan’s fur. Marlowe had jumped from the couch to follow Sherlock and seemed to almost glare at Allan before nuzzling his way between the student’s face and Allan’s stomach. The laugh that broke out of John’s throat was cracked and hollow and Sherlock gently fell to his knees next to the ball of fur.
“Your fridge is a wasteland; don’t you ever eat?” Sherlock jumped at John’s voice and blinked up at him. The med student’s hair was tussled, a few crusts of sleep in the corners of his eyes. John’s bruises were a shade darker though Sherlock was not quite sure if it was the lighting or if they were slowly revealing the strength behind the marks. Sherlock’s eyes quickly skipped over the low waist band of John’s borrowed sweats to see Allan following closely behind the student.
“Do either of you have anything else to say on the matter?” The question was met with silence and Dr. Grundy turned to Sherlock in frustration. “Surely, you have something to say. With the show you put on upon arriving, I’m surprised it was your brother, and not you, who argued with me when I suggested extending your mum’s stay.”
Three days later Sherlock had a pet sitter that seemed desperate enough not to ask questions if he found mold cultures under the bed or a human eyeball in the freezer. Two days after that Sherlock realized there was absolutely no hope of getting their schedules to line up enough to set up a formal meeting of any kind. Although he would have preferred to meet the man in person and show him where everything was in the flat Sherlock settled for a mini essay disguised as an email. The fact that the man didn’t send back a complaint or call him a controlling asshole was promising.
Which of course did not mean that Sherlock stopped being the insufferable child he always was. It did mean that John could start coming back to the long-suffering, reliable, and loyal doctor Sherlock had always admired. It meant taking cases from Scotland Yard once more, nearly killing Donovan when Sherlock laced his fingers with John’s easily at a particularly challenging crime scene. Sherlock had claimed it was to help him focus but John suspected it was mainly for Donovan’s reaction. Lestrade had merely rolled his eyes and huffed as if to say
“Why did you come here?” Sherlock asked quietly. John’s cheeks reddened and he looked away. Sherlock’s brow furrowed and he frowned further. “I mean you barely know me. I’m sure you have people you know better and would feel more comfortable with.” John gave a short laugh and shook his head.
Sherlock had expected his room to remain exactly the way it was when he left it. He had expected to find three years’ worth of dust on the counters, an expired experiment beneath one of the loose floorboards in the corner, and a full hamper bin. However, Sherlock only finds one of these things to be true when he sets to taking apart his room inch by inch.
Sherlock looked down at the man curled up on his sofa contemplatively. A black ball of fur, that would have to be Allan, was curled against the man’s chest beneath a protective arm. Another, larger ball of tabby fur, Marlowe, had nestled itself between the back of the sofa and the back of the man. All three were deeply asleep. The faint sound of Allan purring had been audible even at the front door.
Now, Sherlock didn’t consider himself the strongest man on the planet. But, he was fairly confident he could push John’s leg off the chair with minimal injury to either of them, depending on how hard John fought him, and it didn’t take a genius to find a remote in such a small flat. Sherlock reasoned he had a clear advantage and yet he set his cup down and began to eat the sandwich anyways. It was worth it to earn the grin John sent his way.
The temperature around the departure gates had dropped a significant amount since Sherlock arrived an hour before boarding was scheduled to begin. The seats were uncomfortable from the beginning and the crappy knock off coffee shop Sherlock had stopped at had over roasted the beans. Refusing to let on that the cold was beginning to bother him Sherlock slouched further in his seat, chilling coffee balanced on the seat beside him, and stared at the screen of his phone.
“Still, they were quite lovely,” she says, “‘Whenever you see a rose remember that I love you’ he always used to say.”
They sat there unspeaking, the silence only broken by pizzicato notes as Sherlock’s fingers worked their way up and down the violin. He knew Mycroft was deducing the likelihood of his returning to the crack house the moment he was left alone.
He could hardly dare to believe that John meant what he hoped he did. He reached for John’s hand tentatively. If he was right, maybe this was the encouragement John needed; if he was wrong, well…
“There is simply no other logical explanation,” he said, “We have already determined that we are not asleep. Nor, judging by that woman’s attire, is the entire world participating in an elaborate charade put on solely for our benefit.”
“Do you even know how much I’ve done for this family?” Mr. Holmes asked levelly. “I’m the only reason you have this house and I think I deserve a bit more respect than this.” Sherlock bristled a bit, glaring at the man in front of him.
Sherlock hesitated when he reached John, standing so close behind him he could feel the heat of his body. John hadn’t moved though he must have heard Sherlock coming towards him. Panic began to lick at the edges of Sherlock’s mind. Was this going too far? What exactly did John mean by telling him this? Was there something beneath these admissions that revealed one more, very important, thing Sherlock had failed to notice in his self-centered hurricane of being or was he drawing conclusions that weren’t there to be drawn?
me.” He said attempting to struggle out of Sherlock’s embrace yet again. This time Sherlock tightened his arms, hooking his chin over John’s shoulder, and squeezing his eyes shut.
“Move in with me.” Sherlock whispered. His eyes popped open as soon as the words left his mouth and he heard John’s breath hitch. The med student began to pull away but Sherlock’s arms wrapped around him firmly.
“You know what, I don’t bloody care anymore who this sod is or why you are here. You are coming home. Now.” The man grabbed John’s arm and yanked him up from his seat as Sherlock grimaced and glared at John’s father. He could feel the skin between his shoulder blades bristle as he scrambled for a reason to keep John just a moment longer.
John watched, enraptured, as Sherlock’s face contorted in concentration, his body swaying with the rhythm and intensity of the piece he was playing. Every sleek line of his body orchestrated to further enhance the music pouring from those small strings strung tight against wood. The sight of Sherlock playing, the sound of music filling the flat for the first time since his death, was enough in and of itself to have John’s eyes tearing up. But, what brought those tears tracking down his cheeks like water burst from a dam was the pure, unadulterated emotion conveyed in every sound and expression.
“Professor, what can I do for you?” The muscles between Sherlock’s shoulder blades tensed and he lifted his chin a bit at the purposeful insult.
He opened his eyes to the nearly perpetually annoyed ones of Donovan. “Lunch is ready downstairs.” Sherlock gave a short nod of acknowledgement which the maid answered with the roll of her eyes and a huff of displeasure. Sherlock wondered at the barely concealed bruise just at the bend of her neck. Had she been having visitors again? It couldn’t be the old gardener; he never left bruises. Sherlock resolved to break into the detached house later and try to deduce the new man in Donovan’s life. That is if he had time before he left the next morning.
The kitchen and dining area lay to the left of the door, separated from the living room by a single half way that ran only through the middle of the space, leaving a short entryway on either side. Along the top of the wall were various plants and small petri dishes. A large microscope sat on the small dining room table pushed into one corner and John had spent the better part of thirty minutes cleaning the pile of dishes during an episode of frustrated procrastination.
.” Sherlock ignored the man, focusing instead on John’s face as he was pulled from the cafe and out onto the street. He watched the blonde until he was out of sight and then Sherlock slumped back into his chair and sighed.
With all the drama, occasional self-centeredness, and melancholy surrounding his mother Sherlock still loved her more than any other human being. Of course, the companionable atmosphere held between Mrs. Holmes and her sons as they ate was never going to last when the storm that had ripped into their lives when Sherlock turned six stalked the halls.
“Where do you usually go when this happens?” John’s eyes widened and snapped to the professor as Sherlock brought the cup up to his lips and took his second or third sip. He had definitely over brewed the tea.
John pressed his face even harder into Sherlock’s shoulder and choked on something that could have been a sob or a curse. His white-knuckled grip on Sherlock’s shirt was painful and after a few more moments, when all the tears had exhausted themselves into the detective’s shirt, John pulled reluctantly away from his shoulder. That intensely blue gaze was locked onto John’s and all he could do was sit there and let the other man cradle him as he felt his heart shattering once more.
“Molly… She gave me your scarf. I was almost jealous that it was a decision she had the ability to make.” John gave a self-deprecating laugh and lifted his head barely an inch to bang it against the window. “You never truly realize what a ridiculous idiot you are until you feel possessive over a damn scarf.”
“I wouldn’t if I could.” Anderson grinned toothily. “It is simply too late to find another professor, besides I'm only the messenger.”
.” Sherlock winced and looked away. “I realize that sounds a bit terrible saying something like that to you.”
“No, I even fed him multiple times. I don’t know what else to do, George. Why did you have to send me such an attractive and interesting student?”
Two pairs of eyes turned to regard Sherlock when he entered the dining room and something like anger would have flared beneath Sherlock’s skin if it weren’t for the heavy exhaustion pressing it down. There was no reason to expect his father to have come down for breakfast; it was obvious his place at the table had not been set for quite some time. His mother’s eyes flickered to his duffel and back to his face carrying a touch of hurt and confusion.
John stared up into those familiar eyes silently. In the time it took to breathe shakily in and out his lips were crashing into Sherlock’s. One hand came up to grasp at the man’s shoulder while the other hand tangled in Sherlock’s dark curls. The detective gave a strangled, desperate noise and began to kiss back fervently. A hand twisted once more into the doctor’s hair while the other clutched at his back pressing him close and holding him in place. Sherlock leaned back until John was practically in his lap, leaning over him, the kiss unforgiving and messy. Their teeth catching at lips, clicking against each other, tongues laving against the other’s. Nails dug into skin. Stubble, yet to be shaved from the previous night, burned faintly as it rubbed against skin. The rough mess of a kiss was so full of emotion that it drew out sobs as well as moans and ended in the form of truce.
The right hand, top drawer of John's desk has been opened hundreds of times in Sherlock's absence. He can tell because, when he pulls it out, the grooves, where the wheels that allow it to slide in and out of the frame rest, have deepened considerably. There is a scratch at the lip of the drawer that wasn't there before. The amount of dust is not consistent with three years of disuse. There was no doubt that John had been opening this drawer repeatedly in the wake of Sherlock's death. A drawer empty save for the solid weight of a singular, metallic object; John's gun.
“Looks like we will be sitting together.” The boy said quietly. His voice was deeper than the professor had expected and held that note of uncertainty that grew naturally from adolescent awkwardness.
That first email at the airport hadn’t been the last. During Sherlock’s absence, he had received an unexpected daily update. At first it had seemed a bit annoying and frivolous. Surely, the man did not think Sherlock was crazy enough to require a daily picture of his cats. But after the third or fourth day he would find himself laying in the uncomfortable guest dorm bed, staring at the email inbox on his phone, waiting.
That night John woke with a broken sob to find himself immediately wrapped in long pale arms. His cheek was pressed against a bare chest and the calm, even beats of Sherlock’s heart lulled him back to sleep. Just before he slipped back into unconsciousness he felt the warm press of lips against his forehead.
“It felt weird enough going through your pantry, trying to find something that wasn’t expired or labeled for future experimentation. By the way, you never did explain why there are petri dishes of various molds on your counter.”
“Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes?” The two brothers nodded in impatient unity. “Right then, Mrs. Holmes is in stable condition for now. If you would like to see her I can let you in now but you must refrain from waking or disturbing her in any way. She needs all the rest she can get.”
“That’s not necessarily the truth, is it?” Wide eyes looked back at Sherlock’s and the flush across John’s cheeks deepened.
“You know, maybe that’s it. Maybe he thinks you’re just jerking him off. It sounds like he has enough to deal with at home, you can’t blame him for not playing games.” The only answer was a grunt of annoyance. The two professors sat in silence for a moment thinking over the issue before a knock sounded on the door. Anderson strode into the room with a handful of papers and their nose in the air.
“It’ll never happen.” John scoffed. “Are you going to finish that?” John’s brow furrowed in concern as he gestured at Sherlock’s food with his fork. The professor looked down at his carton and scoffed, setting it on the table. He had ordered enough food for two more out of a need to make the student feel more at ease than out of any real sense of hunger.
“I’m not taking your bed from you.” Sherlock’s head cocked to one side as he looked back at John. “There isn’t room for a second bed in your flat and I’m not going to make you sleep on the couch.” A faint blush had begun to spread across John’s cheeks.
“I was thinking more of a subtle approach.” John mused, swinging his leg up to rest his heel on the edge of Sherlock’s chair. He then bent his foot forward to hook it through the back, locking Sherlock in on one side. “I’ve also hidden the remote and I’m not going to help you find it until you finish the sandwich.” John challenged, crossing his arms smugly.
That faint smell of John’s cologne was stronger than it had any reason to be near his bed. The pillows were flatter than he had left them. The bed had not been made with that military preciseness. And since when did Sherlock sleep with a bottle of scotch and a half empty bottle of Ambien in the bottom drawer of his night stand. Sherlock decided to stop looking for hidden differences in the flat when he noticed the prescription date did not line up with the number of pills missing and the bottle of opened scotch had quite a bit missing from it for having been opened so recently.
“I don’t need help, I just need a moment to rest.” The short silence that followed nearly held a tangible disbelief. “What are you doing right now?”
.” Sherlock scoffed, looking up at John. The student burst into laughter at the utter offense that showed in the professor’s expression. “I’m being
Mycroft took care of the paperwork as the Holmes’ were quickly, yet not unkindly, discharged from the hospital. After Dr. Grundy had nearly ran from the room, face redder than it had any right to be, a different doctor had returned with the necessary forms and instructions. Sherlock didn’t say a word as things were signed and promises were made. He was silent in the hallway with Mycroft as they waited for Mrs. Holmes to change out of the hospital gown and into her regular clothing.
The muscles in his fingers twitched as he glanced down at John’s hand but he stubbornly kept them at his side.
As the server grabbed John’s plate as well as the bill the front door chimed and John immediately stiffened, eyes fixed on a point behind Sherlock. The professor noticed the change in John’s demeanor immediately from the rapid melt of John’s soft smile into a worried frown to the flex in his arms as he clenched his hands into fists beneath the table.
For a short moment, Sherlock had the very clear image of himself striding across the space between them, gripping the letter opener from its designated place, and stabbing his father in the eye. He could almost feel the hot blood wetting the spaces between his fingers, staining his fingertips, pooling in his palms. The door shut behind him with a loud
. Sherlock thought drily. At the end of the email was a single picture of Marlowe curled in John’s arm with a look of pure bliss on his face. On the floor, Sherlock could see Allan eating out of the cat bowls in the kitchen.
The bandages coiled around her wrists were very pointedly ignored in sight and conversation. Mummy wasn’t feeling well, but she would be fine, there was nothing to discuss. If Sherlock opened his mouth his mother would wake, simply to talk above him. If Mycroft glanced at the linen bracelets covering a good part of her forearms she would tsk and carry on about the dangers of cooking or rock climbing. She would ask about their jobs, the weather, the political climate in Asia. Their mother was alright and neither son should be worried.
Sherlock’s flat was becoming uncomfortable stuffy as he pictured a stern John Watson glaring at a group of soldiers demanding he let them deal with one of his rebel patients.
“Come down when you feel like it then, or starve, see if I care.” Donovan huffed. Sherlock glared at the door but eventually slid off the bed and begun dressing himself. The thought of food had begun to turn his stomach and the more Sherlock replayed the conversation with John over the phone the more he found himself wanting to leave immediately. Maybe, if he left now, Sherlock could get back to the flat in time to take John to lunch. The idea had him stuffing what little items he had unpacked into his duffel bag faster and marching downstairs.
John’s eyes flew wide open, every muscle tensing as his hand flexed into a fist beneath his head and a breath rushed into his lungs. The tabby at his back jumped up and looked around bewildered before jumping down to the floor. The black ball of fur at the man’s chest looked up sleepily, bristling a bit before settling back contentedly at the sight of Sherlock. Sherlock took his hand back, head cocking to the side quizzically.
Allan had burrowed beneath Sherlock’s pillows and refused to come out despite John’s varied attempts at bribing the kitten. John suspected it was because the cat could sense that something was wrong. The question from before stood unanswered from John’s first reply and repeated almost hesitantly in the second. Sherlock paused, he didn’t let himself recognize the disappointment over the lack of photo attachments to the email, but he let himself read over the text multiple times before reluctantly hitting reply.
“You didn’t come to the hospital.” Sherlock’s father barely blinked. He simply sighed and leaned back in his chair, arms crossed over his chest.
“Father, Doctor Holmes is the man that hired me to watch his flat and his cats while he was out of town.” John interrupted before Sherlock could reply. The student’s tone was ridged, controlled, far from the tone he took when he had been speaking with Sherlock. And that posture more fit into Sherlock’s brief military doctor fantasy than a student slogging through med school.
time to prepare. The conference isn’t for a few weeks from now.” Anderson smirked up at the fuming professor and folded their hands on the counter in front of them, locking their fingers together over their phone, face down. “Besides, the University wanted Doctor Lestrade to do it. They only came to you after he turned them down. You should be talking to him.”
“John? And Sherlock, dear!” The two men both turned at the sound of their names to see an older woman with short red hair coming out of one of the other flats. “I didn’t think I’d be seeing both of you today, what a pleasure.” She smiled at them each politely, eyes widening only slightly at the sight of John’s black eye, and John smiled back as Sherlock gave a short nod.
Sherlock cleared his throat and watched curiously as John shot straight up, blushing terribly. Allan meowed and pawed at John’s face in protest. For a moment, Sherlock contemplated making a joke about giving John some privacy with his cats but decided against it, instead holding the towel out to him.
“Thank you, my name is Henry.” Henry smiled and held out a hand to the still slouched, nearly out of his seat, professor. Sherlock considered snubbing the gesture but Lestrade’s constant displeased comments on his lack of basic social skills found him sitting up straighter, pulling his legs in, and letting the larger man’s hand engulf his own. The callouses sang manual labor and dedication. “This is my grandson Eliot.” Sherlock smirked and nodded to the boy.
“No, no, I don’t want to get in your way. You are probably itching to unpack and take a break.” Sherlock snorted and walked into the kitchen taking out his phone. An hour later John and Sherlock were sat on the sofa, surrounded by Allan, Marlowe, and a dozen or so boxes of Asian takeaway, watching a TV show about two brothers fighting monsters.
“Let me buy you dinner first, at least.” John looked up, eyes wide. “Consider it part of your payment for watching my cats, a thank you for the daily updates.” Sherlock raised an eyebrow at the man beneath him and John flushed a bit, rubbing the back of his neck.
“Sherlock, it’s John.” Sherlock blinked into the dark room. He pulled the phone from his ear and checked the time.
Eliot gaped up at Sherlock and then looked back to where his grandfather stood by the seats. Sherlock let the kid have the window seat and spent the entire flight answering questions about his last-minute lecture and the University he taught at back home. By the time they landed Eliot didn’t even seem to be remotely related to the kid Sherlock was introduced to at the beginning. Getting him to stop talking long enough to answer the questions was nearly impossible.
file had gone down considerably when a plate landed beside Sherlock’s thigh. Marlowe stretched along Sherlock’s opposite thigh, tail thumping Sherlock’s hip as the cat looked lazily up at the man above them.
“As soon as possible.” Mycroft raised an eyebrow at the short reply and his mother watched as he nearly leapt from his chair and rushed from the room. Upstairs his bedroom was exactly how he had left it the last time he had stayed at the estate. Sherlock’s phone informed him he had two text messages from Lestrade and an email from John. With a quick glance at the message preview Sherlock swiped the text message notification out of the way and opened the email from John.
“Hullo?” Sherlock watched as John’s shoulders straightened and his posture corrected unconsciously. The tightening of John’s hands gave the caller away almost immediately. “Yes, sir… I’m sorry… Yes…” John’s jaw flexed as he ground his teeth together and Sherlock made the Herculean effort to get off the sofa and walk over to stand next to John.
Sunlight had begun to weakly filter in through the curtains of Sherlock’s room by the time he began drifting off to sleep. Just as his mind began to shut off the bed vibrated once more and Sherlock groaned, eyes startling open to blink blearily at the ceiling.
The trill of his phone brought his attention back to the discarded device. With a slight huff of annoyance Sherlock picked up the phone and answered without checking the caller id. His face fell as the voice of his brother drifted through the phone. As soon as they hung up he was crafting an email to John as well as a separate one from his university email announcing lectures would be cancelled tomorrow.
Sherlock asked the mirage of one John Watson. The man had the audacity to smile knowingly and give him a look that carried all the certainty Sherlock’s mind held. John was safe. He was as safe as the sofa beneath him, the blanket around his shoulders, the tabby cat curled in his lap, and the black one laid on the mantle. He had no right to be the warmth of a good cup of tea or the comforting smell of fresh biscuits. John Watson had barely crossed the threshold of Sherlock’s life and yet the professor found himself yearning to be the tea cup held so firmly in his hands. Blue china, a match to the one before him on the coffee table.
Sherlock was certain that the hospital conspired to make their chairs as uncomfortable as possible to encourage some sort of empathy for the patients laying in the beds. Or perhaps they did it simply to discourage anyone else from cluttering and dirtying their rooms. No matter how Sherlock fidgeted or shifted his legs there was no escape from the cold bite of metal or the uncomfortable pain in his side from contorting himself away from the offending silver. The professor resolved to stare a hole into the side of the doctor’s head in an attempt to revolt against their collective aim to make any visit to the hospital a terrible experience.
He wondered as his eyes began to lose focus once more. William Sherlock Scott Holmes, holder of two Doctorates, a renter in London, a man with two cats who teaches at a local University.
“I could tell you all were getting pretty attached while I was gone.” A red color tinted John’s cheeks as he rubbed the back of his neck again. “The place your renting now doesn’t allow pets, does it? And you didn’t have any growing up?”
Sherlock turned his head to the other side, his arm moved bumping his hand against the outline of his phone. He remembered throwing it aside after staring at John’s picture. It had landed facedown and as he turned it he noticed that the screen was lit.
“He has taken a liking to you.” The professor agreed, leaning back against the counter but not really moving out of John’s space. John hummed, the fingers of his left-hand curling to pet Marlowe a bit awkwardly while he finished the first sandwich with his other and started on a second.
visitor by now!” Mycroft echoed Sherlock’s sigh, though his was more apologetic and long suffering. He gripped Sherlock’s arm tightly, leading him with difficulty towards the chairs, and gave a polite yet dismissive nod to the doctor.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and shoved his phone back into its pocket just as the metal doors of the lift began to peel open. The front lobby of the staff office building was as empty and silent as it ever was. Really, it was more of a glorified hallway than a proper lobby. Off to the left of the lift was a secretarial desk where Anderson stood scrolling through their phone; on the right were two doors leading to the bathrooms and a few sofas. Shoved in the corner between the front doors and the first of the sofas was a small stand with cheap coffee set out.
Sherlock’s flat was set up in an interesting fashion. The front door opened to the living room, the wall opposite the door filled with bookshelves where random knick-knacks were set in amongst the disorganized hoard of textbooks and nonfiction novels. To the right of the front door was a short, narrow hallway leading back to the bedroom and the flat’s only bathroom. Along that wall was the entertainment center.
“You were serious?” Sherlock’s brow furrowed and he opened his eyes again and sat up a bit. The creak of the bed seemed to echo through the room and Sherlock winced.
Of the two things Sherlock expected to see on the other side of his door so late in the evening John, soaking wet without a jacket or umbrella, was neither. The med student looked exhausted; dark purple bruises beneath his vibrant eyes and a slackness to the muscles around his mouth. As Sherlock’s eyes adjusted to the bright lights of the hallway streaming into his unlit room he noticed that one of those purple bruises was considerably darker and larger than the other. A red line split John’s bottom lip straight down the middle and, as Sherlock’s eyes scanned over the rest of his body, he noticed the outline of a hand on one of John’s arms and that the student was favoring his right leg.
Sherlock’s smirk lasted the entire lift ride. It vanished when a tall, lanky man, with something that was attempting to pass as a beard on his face, leapt to his feet and started talking as soon as the professor had stepped past the threshold of the lift. The student followed a breath behind the professor as Sherlock strolled towards the front doors.
“Sherlock?” John’s voice called through the receiver. Sherlock’s lips parted but no sound came forward. “Can you hear me?” Sherlock’s jaw worked, his lips moved, his lungs filled and then emptied. Nothing. The professor closed his eyes, one hand fisted in the material of his jeans as the other clutched tighter around the phone.
“I dreamt you would come to my room, sit on the edge of my bed, and watch me sleep.” John paused and the continued reflectively, “I realize it’s a bit creepy to admit out loud but it’s out now.” Sherlock’s arms only tightened around John. They stayed that way, silent, both thinking, for what felt like hours before Sherlock let out a deep sigh. His brow furrowed as he tried to think of something, anything to say, but his mind was at a loss. How can one convey the entirety of the strength and depth of their emotions in something as ordinary and inexpressive as words? With a frustrated huff Sherlock withdrew reluctantly from John who turned around, mouth opening as if to speak but then shutting once more as he watched Sherlock. Sherlock’s violin was resting in its case by the mantel, untouched these past three years, but kept dusted and clean.
