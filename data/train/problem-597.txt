“Where’s John?”, but the servant shook their head quickly, dropping their eyes back to the ground. Molly let out a quiet, but frustrated sigh.
So as mentioned in the notes of chapter one, I'll be aiming to post a new chapter once or twice a week :-) I've just started working on chapter twelve so there's plenty more to come!
“J-just go”, she stammered, placing a hand over her face. Humiliation flooded her very being and it showed, clear as day. She was very easily intimidated, unlike John. He gave her another concerned look before glancing down at the clean razor in his hand. He desperately wanted to comfort his friend, but was wary of the consequences of prioritising other servants over their superiors. Still, he faltered.
John was sipping on a cup of tea, flicking through an old newspaper as he hummed happily in his armchair. Sherlock was pottering about in the kitchen when Lestrade almost burst into the living room.
“Oh do come along, brother. We have much catching up to do and you are rather taking your tim-“, Mycroft stopped when he caught sight of John staring at him. He was about to scold the servant for it when Sherlock intervened.
He didn’t remember arriving at the House, let alone making his way to his bed. John furrowed his brow in confusion, reaching his hands up to his chest to feel at the material of his clothes. He could feel that was no longer wearing his silk
When John awoke, he was in his bed. He blinked rapidly in confusion as he attempted to recognise his room through the darkness. A patchwork of memories came pouring back to him as he recalled saying goodbye to Sholto, then to Irene, climbing into the
That morning was the busiest the House had ever been. Every one of Mother’s servants was running around manically, dusting and scrubbing and tidying. The entire House was under strict orders to have the place in top condition for the impending visit from their guest. John had been sweeping for the past four hours without so much as a minute to stop and breath. His hands ached, the wood of the broom creating blisters on his fingers. Stealing a quick glance around him, he briefly stopped so as to quickly flex his hands. Just as he did so, he felt something hard hit the back of his head. He let out a small yelp, spinning round to throw a glare at whoever had just assaulted him with a scrubbing brush. Molly was knelt on the floor a couple of metres away from him, next to a bucket of soapy water. She’d been scrubbing the floors for as long as he’d been sweeping, but stopped to scold him. With her hands on her hips, she pouted, “Mother will catch you standing around like that, if you’re not careful. You’ll be beaten senseless!”
“Asexual people don’t have any sexual feelings or desires. That means they’re not attracted to anyone. But sometimes they have an exception to the rule. Lestrade is apparently my brothers exception.”
They kissed languidly for a while before it became more heated. Sherlock pushed his body upwards to press against John, wanting more friction. John is apparently very intuitive when it’s comes to sex because he grinds down on Sherlock and they both let out a low moan.
He seems genuinely happy to see John and John feels the same, not having seen anyone from his previous tour in Afghanistan other than Major Sholto at his wedding and Mike Stanford but that’s very rare these days.
“Bet you want to though. I went to college with Myc, we had a class together. I admired his focus and determination to be the best. Followed him round a bit to try to get him in the sack, as all us rebellious college girls did, but after awhile he got annoyed and told me he was asexual and then we became friends. Well, Mycroft’s version of friends where we send each other a Christmas card each year and when we see each other every two to five years at galas or benefits for the Veterans or something we stand next to each other and make small talk to avoid unwanted guests bugging us”
Sherlock has apparently taken too long to reply or even move and John has taken this as a bad sign. John lets go of Sherlock’s hands and steps away. John just nods and moves to turn back to the window.
The car doesn’t even fully stop before Sherlock jumps out towards the door and leaves John to throw some money at the cab driver and apologise to him as well. Sherlock has the door opened and as soon as John closes the door behind him the begin to yell at each other.
“Really Sherlock? Don’t insult you? You basically insult me on a daily basis and I’m not to insult you. The worlds only consulting detective. I thought you were too smart to be insulted.”
What did change was nothing of significance. Just small things. They sat closer to each other with Sherlock resting against Johns side, John rested his hand on Sherlock’s leg in cab’s, Sherlock leaned over John into his space more when he was sitting in his chair and John brushed his hand against the back of Sherlock’s neck whenever he passed by.
He’s Captain John Watson once again and mutters “Into battle” to himself as he walks towards the offices.
John stops and looks at him. Hope in his eyes. Sherlock launches himself at John. Wrapping his arms around him and holding on tight. John sighs and they melt into the hug. Sherlock is finally in John’s arms. And he never wants to leave. He wants to be John’s forever and John his. He clings onto John tighter and feels John laugh softly.
Sherlock retreats to the bathroom and John escorts Mrs hudson back downstairs and comforts her for a while.
Sherlock just hums a quiet agreement. He doesn’t want to think about John going away again. They have so little time before John has to leave again. Five days until Sherlock’s birthday and then John leaves the next day.
“John, would you hurry up with whatever it is you need to tell me I would like to get back to my tobacco ash”
Sherlock grins, “Yes John it is. Usually I don’t have a problem focusing on my work but lately I have become quite distracted actually.”
John sighed. “Of course I’ll be careful Sherlock. If an opportunity to come home early arrises I’ll take it. I promise to come home to you safe. I love you Sherlock.”
“Don’t abandon you?! That’s a bit rich don’t you think. I’m sorry Sherlock I think you’ve forgotten the bit where you were dead for two years. I know you’ve got that eidetic memory so you can’t have forgotten that and I’m the one abandoning you?”
“Speaking of Sherlock,” John can hear the grin in Greg’s voice. “You two got your shit together yet?”
That was a cheap shot on Sherlocks part, John might not want to talk about last night but Sherlock is going to make him think about.
Mycroft, being the British government, will be fighting to get him back. The Mystrade fic will be focusing on Mycroft dealing with the aftermath of this fic and just when it feels like things settles down, the people who have John get in contact. Add in Greg Lestrade and it’s going to interesting.
He squeezed some lube on his hands and warmed it before he leaned back down on top of Sherlock and wrapped his hand around Sherlock’s erection.
John wraps his lips back around Sherlock’s penis and continues to work his finger in. He adds more lube and a second when he thinks Sherlock is ready. A third soon after. He scissors his fingers and opens Sherlock further. He thinks he’s ready.
When Sherlock has finished and the talking has commenced again, John offers to make some more tea and insists Mrs Hudson remains seated. He’s cleaning up the plates from earlier when the kettle goes off.
“Well, the invitation did say formal dress. And I know you don’t have anything suitable to wear to a formal occasion that will make you look as distinguished as you are.”
Mrs Hudson brings the tea over for them and fusses over John. She soon retreats to her own flat and leaves them alone. It feels like hours before someone says something but it’s probably merely minutes.
Greg really wishes he could just nap again on his desk but he has a feeling Sherlock is close to solving it so he gulps down the remainder of his coffee and follows them through the yard to the conference room.
His injured leg is also trapped beneath a pile of rumble. The roof has seemingly been unstable. He looks around the room and spots Smith. She lying face down and there’s blood trickling slowly from her shoulder. Fuck. Jesus Christ what the hell is going on.
He removes his fingers and looks up at Sherlock, he asks if he’s positive about doing this without protection. Sherlock nods quickly.
Greg blushes slightly but nods and accepts Mycroft’s offer. They say goodbye to John and leave together, getting into the car Mycroft has waiting.
Finally he gives up and texts Mycroft. Obviously he is surprised to hear from Sherlock as he hadn’t responded to any calls yesterday but he does have a case for Sherlock.
Playing his violin loud enough to wake up Mrs Hudson who stumbled up the stairs with her dressing gown on and hair in disarray.
“Last night, at the Met Christmas party. Clearly he’s infatuated with Lestrade but won’t do anything about it. With Lestrade not being interested, him being ‘not gay’ and everything”
They are halfway through unloading the trucks when Johns’ ears hone in on a sound. A small rock has been dislodged from the ridge on his left.
Lestrade calmed a bit. “Yeh well, lunch is just about my promotion, Mycroft called and invited me so he could tell me if there was any progress.”
Sally is left a bit unnerved by this side of John she’s never seen, but suddenly realises that Johns just as mad as Sherlock and just shrugs, going back to her work.
“Oh John I’m so glad to see you again. I’ve been worried sick about you over there. Sherlock has been absolutely miserable these past few months without you.”
The area is clear but they haven’t checked the mountain ridges. The hair on the back of Johns’ neck prickles. Something or someone is watching him. Watching them. Knight signals for the “bodyguards” to do a sweep of the ridges with another two from the other squad while the rest begin to unpack the trucks.
“I’m sure you’re aware of your presence in the papers due to your association with Sherlock Holmes. If it was up to me we wouldn’t have two men specificity protecting you since I know you can take care of yourself but these orders come from an office of a very important government official whose name has been redacted for obvious reasons. We have received compensation in the form of upgraded supplies for our trouble”
John’s got that look in his eye. The one that always end up with Sherlock’s heart broken. The look he had before he says somethings stupid like “I’m spending the rest of my life with someone who’s not you.” or “I’m going back overseas to get myself killed.” Sherlock is paraphrasing of course.
She comes back a few minutes later with tea for them both. Sherlock has picked up his violin and begun to play.
Sherlock suddenly feels the need to loosen his collar, despite the fact the temperature hasn’t changed at all, and feels the ‘butterflies’ again, this time lower.
“Can’t have tea right now John, I’m thinking and you’re being very distracting, please wait in the corridor until I’m done”
God Sherlock looked gorgeous at the party, like always, and was distracted by him all night. That’s probably why he didn’t notice anything going on with Mycroft and Lestrade. He’d have to have a chat to Greg about that, see how he feels about it. Mycroft’s helped him out a lot over the last couple of years with all the Mary stuff and when he went back to active duty, this would be the least he could do.
“Mother please stop. You’re so embarrassing. Why are you even here? Can’t you just send a card like you do every year.” His mother tuts again,
John has been told that he is on the patrol at 1200 hours so he gets some rest but has also been told he’s to meet the Lieutenant Colonel Ford and his old Colonel Peterson at 0900 hours so he’ll get nearly six hours if he gets to sleep now.
When they opened their own flat they managed to control themselves long enough to shed their coats and discard their shoes.
When Sherlock emerges from his room he looks gorgeous in a dark charcoal suit that John has never seen before.
“Oh Sherlock.” She tuts, “you’re getting far too skinny. I was just about to tell Mrs Hudson here to make sure you eat everyday but if John has moved back in full time then he can do it. Mikey did mention something about a war but you eating is more important, isn’t it John dear.”
Sherlock spends a lot of the time spouting off random facts about the paintings and artists to John, who is genuinely interested, while Sherlock’s parents follow behind.
John can’t see what’s in the containers but he hears a low whistle of appreciation and a following comment of “Those are some fresh riffles.”
“What were you thinking?” Johns asks as Sherlock places his hands on Johns shoulders and swings his right leg across John’s lap so he’s straddling him.
The case takes them longer than expected. Days. It’s more complicated than they thought at first. But eventually Sherlock figures it out and Lestrade arrests the guy.
“Sorry John. I forgot about your height disadvantage. Just follow me closely and if you get far behind I will come back for you.”
Sherlock must have looked surprised because John huffed out a laugh and grinned.  Sherlock could only nod and turn towards the stairs. He practically ran up the stairs with John hot on his heels.
The giggles subsided and their breathing evened out a bit before either of them moved away. John pulled back and looked up at Sherlock.
Sherlock turns beet red and John can’t hold in his laughter this time and try’s his best to control himself, excusing himself into the kitchen to get the tea.
They both look at John like he wouldn’t dare. So he pulls his phone out and scrolls down to her number.
John finally turns to Mrs Hudson who has finished clearing up the tea cups she had made for everyone.
“Sherlock, I’m leaving now. I’m not sure when I’ll be back. I don’t want to leave while you’re still angry at me”.
She suggests they move to the seating area near the kitchen and they take a seat opposite each other.
Sherlock tightens his hold on John. John’s eyes piercing into his soul. It’s yours now John, Sherlock thinks. My whole being is yours, forever.
They both find another drink and some food to eat.The champagne they are handing around is actually very nice.
Sherlock reaches over to Johns chair to take it from him but John moves it out his way. He looks at Sherlock intensely.
Despite them not even facing each other, the room suddenly feels too hot for John, who breaks the eye contact in the mirror and clears his throat.
“Sherlock put that down please I need to speak to you. Properly, without interruptions, it’s very important”
Sherlock immediately becomes very excited, almost tripping over on his way to the bedroom. John follows.
They are debriefed and shown around the base, directed to their quarters and told when to report in the morning.
I am very sorry if the last couple of chapters of this story caused anyone distress. This is my first fic so I wasn’t sure what to do about the MCD because it would be a spoiler. I have updated the tags so people know there is a MCD in this story and I will be using this space to tell you what will happen. Please let me know in the comments if you think I can add more tags or warnings to help people decide to read this fic or not if the subject is too upsetting.
Greg coughs awkwardly, still in the room, not that either of them notice but they both turn to look at him and at the same time Johns phone rings.
“You asked Lestrade and I answered. Don’t ask questions you don’t want to know. Just like I don’t ask questions about you and my brother.”
When they arrive at the crime scene Lestrade declares that they must call him Detective Chief Inspector. Sherlock declares he’ll still just call him Lestrade and bounces off to find the bodies, Donovan trailing after him yelling about protocol. John hangs back to congratulate Greg.
“Why? Where are yo...” Sherlock’s a genius and he figures it out before John even has to say something.
They chat about the case from yesterday and Sherlock’s suddenly more animated as he explains to John his deductions, Johns already heard them but he loves the way Sherlock gets when he’s deducing.
“Sherlock, would you mind moving aside? I’m getting a bit cold standing here without any clothes on”
He sighs and grabs a blanket to cover Sherlock with, turns the light off and closes the door. He better get started on that list, theres a lot to sort out before he leaves.
He ducks quickly into the kitchen and grabs a couple beers and settles into the bathtub with them. Long soaks in the bath are one of John’s guilty pleasures, he hasn’t had one in ages.
“No, I know Sherlock I’m just a bit distracted to concentrate on your thought process at the moment”
He slides in towards the middle of the seat and goes no further, leaving enough room for John on his right side. Sherlock is quite enjoying having John by his side again and has missed his warmth. John doesn’t even have to tell the driver the address or anything and they begin the drive through the street’s towards home.
Sherlock has decided to take Mycroft’s advice. John’s finally back, but not for long and Sherlock can’t bare the though of going any length of time without him again. Sherlock makes up his mind to try to gage John’s feelings towards him that may be non-platonic. He slowly rests his head on John’s shoulder. With some difficulty due to John being a bit smaller than him but finally finds a comfortable spot. John doesn’t move or ask him to move so Sherlock takes that as a positive sign.
“Thank you very much Mycroft.” He smiles broadly and allows her to hug him. He ushers her inside and turns to his brother and John.
This is a work of fiction. All rights to Sherlock and characters belong to BBC and Arthur Conan Doyle.
“You’ve not received the call yet? I’ve got the results right here, they came about 20 minutes ago so I assumed that they would have called you. Well, they should’ve called you already, I really must look into them, anyway the results came back all clear. You’re leaving at 0600 hours tomorrow morning. That’s in 18 hours John, you need to tell him soon. I’ll have your uniform sent over to you this morning. Good day.”
“Mycroft you know how I detest your job and you, mostly. I hate to ask, really detest this, but could you look into John’s leave application. It’s been denied and he’s not coming home for Christmas.”
John is working on George when suddenly he is jolted backward and hits his head on the floor. There’s ringing in his ears. Fuck. Fuck, they have a RPG. The buildings foundations shake. He can faintly hear gunfire and Smith is waving her hands in front of him, yelling at him. The blast must have impaired his hearing. Shit.
“It’s Lestrade” he says simply and John knows it must be a hard case as they’re calling Sherlock in at night.
Mycroft and Mrs Hudson emerge through the double doors to announce lunch is ready. John hands Molly her phone back and swallows the rest of his beer, taking the next from Greg when he hands it to him.
John wakes at 0800 hours to people talking outside his tent and quickly changes into his patrol gear and heads out to find where to report.
The tube ride was tense. John having been shocked at Sherlock actually wanting to go out on New Year’s Eve for once. Also the alarming amount of people on the tube as well. Sherlock was equally, if not more nervous about tonight. He still hadn’t figured out what he was going to say.
Sherlock is too distracted to notice Johns face has gone bright red because of the way Sherlock is staring at him, but manages to move aside, very unsteady on his feet, so John can leave the bathroom.
Then chasing said suspect only to have him be innocent and then back to St Bart’s and then down to Scotland Yard to speak again to Lestrade.
“Of course it’s not a bomb Sherlock. I know you and your brother don’t get on but he’s unlikely to blow up the flat.”
He walked into the kitchen and noticed Mrs Hudson had brought some fresh scones up and he popped the kettle on. A cuppa and some scones sounded good.
Mycroft has texted and has arranged a car to take John to the base as he wouldn’t be able to get a cab this early. He walks down the hallways to Sherlock’s room and knocks lightly, both wanting to wake Sherlock up and not wanting to.
It's his old superior from Afghanistan Colonel Peterson and he asks John how he's doing. They make small talk about how John's recovered and John inquires as to where he's stationed at the moment.
The clock on the wall said it was almost ten thirty. He didn’t know they’d sleep for that long but he supposed they were late coming home and after their activities last night they didn’t get to bed till late.
”Right, so you need the evidence again, I’ll have to call Daniels, he was in charge of the bagging and tagging last night, just hang on a tick and you can see your evidence.”
“Sherlock! Sherlock you have to stop doing that or I’ll come now and we won’t be able to move to the main event.”
“Don’t worry John, we know he doesn’t mean it really. He’s just upset he’s losing you. We will take care of him for you.” John thanks her and she leaves.
John just looked up at him and smiled. He slowly stood back up and cupped Sherlock’s face in his hands, kissing him softy.
They are greeted in Aleppo by the rest of the convoy and some of the local forces that are fighting with them and handed weapons and packs.
Sherlock is just about to ask John if he’s spending Christmas Day with his family, when Lestrade walks in.
John takes cover by the side of the truck and takes aim. He shoots. The gunfire is loud and disorientating. Someone is pushed up next to him on his other side, shooting towards the ridges. It’s Smith, she leans over toward him and has to yell for John to hear her over the gunfire, “We should try to make it into the building, it’ll provide more cover than being out here in the open.”
When Sherlock finishes John just barely whispers “Amazing” and Sherlock beams, their eyes lock and John smiles back.
The case isn’t as fun without John and Sherlock solves it very perfunctory and without flare. That was usually for Johns benefit. He liked the attention John gave him and when he called Sherlock brilliant or amazing, it made him feel like John really loved being there with him and didn’t regret any decisions he made in the past.
John was carefully rubbing his hands up and down Sherlock’s thighs soothingly and looked up into his eyes.
“That new bloke at the yard then? The one Sally mentioned?” His tone of voice sounds a bit jealous. Sherlock’s not sure if he like it or not.
John hears feet to the side of his face and barely registers someone checking his pulse. A man. John thinks faintly as he begins to drift.
“Whatever did happen to Mary and their child? Mycroft won’t tell us, he says it’s for you or John to tell us what’s happened. It can’t have been good if John’s living back here with you again. Even though they had their problems, no marriage is ever perfect, they both seemed excited to be having a baby.”
Sherlock retreats to the bathroom and is quick about his shower and shave. He emerges not long after and heads back into the sitting room where he can hear Mrs Hudson and two other voices.
Letting the Colonel know his decision he says his goodbyes and hangs up. John gets his shoes and jacket on. Walking back to the kitchen he stands and watches Sherlock for a bit.
As soon as the flat door closes though, Johns’ phone rings on the coffee table. John grabs it and sees an unknown number but answers it anyway, could be Harry.
He feels safe but unnerved and tense like he’s waiting for something. After a few hours they leave the safe zone into known enemy territory. John doesn’t like this. Doesn’t like it at all.
He just stands there staring off into the space where Sherlock has just left, he thinks that that might have been the last glimpse of Sherlock Holmes he ever sees.
Sherlock doesn’t want to think about it really, but John leaves again in the morning. Back to Syria. Back to fighting. Sherlock tried not to think about John over there. He’s realised it scares him. He wants to be with John, be Johns’ completely before he loses him again. It’s a shorter amount of time but it’ll still feel the same when John walks out the door. Sherlock clings a bit more to Johns jumper.
“Sherlock it’s not your decision, it’s mine. And I’ve already been cleared for active duty. I deploy in the morning”
“Brother mine, please behave in front of guests, John is merely serving his country as you did while you were away. At least he’s not lying to his loved ones about being dead”
“I’m not sure what you’re talking about Doctor Watson. There was merely a government surplus in the military sector that were used for new supplies. The fact they were sent to your base John, is simply coincidence.”
“Also, I think you and John should’ve gotten your act together ages ago. You really do fit together perfectly. I’m happy the two of you are finally working things out.”
“I’m handling things fine Gavin, without John around I can do what I like, when I like and stay up all night without anyone pestering me to sleep or eat.”
Sherlock just blinks. He doesn’t know what to say. He just stands there frozen to the spot. He didn’t expect that. He’s pretty sure John has just confessed his undying love for him. It’s unbelievable. Truely, Sherlock doesn’t believe him. But when he looks in John’s eyes he has never seen him look so sincere and Sherlock almost cries with relief. John wants him too. Wants to be with him forever.
“Definitely famous around here mate, everyone’s heard about the Veteran running around London doing more dangerous things then when he was actually in the army. A couple of us follow your blog, my fiancé included, you’ll meet him later, he’s around here somewhere, but he’s a doctor like you so you’ll run into him eventually, it’s not a very large base but it’s enough for a couple battalions”
Just as suddenly as she changed to this person in front of him another Captain approach’s and she changed back to the LC she was before. The other captain informs her that they need to start gearing up for patrol. She dismisses him and gets John to follow her to the pack and weapons building.
“Now that’s over and done with, I need another beer. Or three. Whatever will get me through this day.”
John must have noticed the way Sherlock was looking at him and suggested they make their way to the bedroom, sheding the rest of their clothes.
“Speaking of food, Mrs Hudson has left some lunch in the fridge for later on as well as what I’ve brought”
“Yes. Oh god yes.” Sherlock managed to whisper, sounding breathless. This was consent enough for John, who swiftly pulled Sherlock’s pants and trousers down to his feet in one go. Sliding his hands back up Sherlock’s legs John began to mouth at the base of Sherlock’s cock, which was standing erect against his bare stomach. Splaying one hand on Sherlock’s hip, he used the other to hold the base of Sherlock’s cock, licking a stripe along the underside from root to tip.
Sherlock looks over at John and he’s watching him. He smiles at John and it is returned. “Now, open yours.”
“It’s Christmas Day for fucks sake. Can you two please play nice for a few hours? Or do I have to call your mother?”
John’s gorgeous and Sherlock feels his heart beat faster and has that weird feeling in his stomach again from earlier.
So John went and saw Harry and her new girlfriend for a quick breakfast and spent most of the day at the pub with Lestrade. Both of them wallowing in the misery or their failed marriages and subsequent divorces.
“Less about the hard work and dedication, more about budget cuts I reckon. And maybe some upstairs political influence to be honest.”
His brother taught him that caring is not an advantage and that’s how he will handle this because he doesn’t want to actually think about what this means.
Fuck it hurts to even move it. Somehow this pain hurts more than the shot he took to the shoulder years ago. He has to evaluate it now. He doesn’t feel like it’s hit an artery or any important nerves but he has to check.
They walk out doors to the balcony and everyone is gathered around the bar chatting, but Molly spots them and come rushing over.
It was only Myrcroft so he didn’t bother answering. He checked his email for interesting cases but had only two boring ones so he solved them and decided to finish his experiment in the kitchen.
John agrees and looks over towards the other trucks. There are two bodies lying in the dirt, riddled with bullets. They hadn’t been fast enough and John feels his gut retch at the sight.
They says their goodbyes and John turns to go back into the conference room but is stopped my Lestrade standing by the door, obviously having heard Johns call.
I’m soooo sorry this took so long to put up. It’s still not great writing but thanks for reading. :)
“Well you are a genius Sherlock. I thought even you could deduce why the signal stopped cutting out after the second week and the screen quality improved. I did also mentioned the new gear and the update in the rec room, pool table included. But I suppose that’s all too pedestrian for you to notice Sherlock.”
That dampens Johns mood for the rest of his visit to the base. He is directed to the field medic area to familiarise or re-familiarise himself with all procedures and equipment. That takes longer than he would have liked but still he’s done and off the base just after 5. He arrives home nearly an hour later.
It was very difficult to do so when neither of them wanted to take their lips off the other. They settled on holding hands and grinning at each other like mad until they got out of the cab. The driver looked at them from the rear view mirror and shook his head.
Knight has apparently noticed too and informs everyone to stay armed and ready, radioing the other squad in the Jeep who came out on patrol with them, to do the same. Smith is manning the gun while John, the twins and John’s “bodyguards”, who no one even notices because they don’t speak, do an area sweep before they sweep the building.
Tears spill down his cheeks before he even knows he’s crying. It’s too real. Sherlock can’t imaging his life without John. Even when he himself was away or even when John was married he knew he would see him again. Now though.
Leaning closer John whispered, “Sherlock, get your sexy arse upstairs so I can have my way with you.”
“Nah Mycroft’s not arrogant, bit pretentious or posh but he’s actually all right, despite what Sherlock says.”
Settling into his chair John begins to make a list of things he needs to do before he leaves. He faintly hears the door adjacent to Sherlocks room close and after Sherlock doesn’t appear ten minutes later goes searching for his flatmate.
Sherlock knows why they’re here. His legs almost give out underneath him as he acknowledges the officers significance. He has to grasp the rail to keep himself upright.
As Greg predicted, Sherlock is sat next to him, Greg himself sitting on John’s other side opposite Mrs Hudson. Molly is opposite Sherlock so they can exchange more photos of corpses over lunch and Simon between her and Mrs Hudson. Mycroft, naturally, is at the head of the table on Greg’s left.
The medical area is actually quite a large cement building as well as the sheds and bunkers that he assumes hold weapons and ammunition.
They’ve not really had time to spend together as a couple but they take time when theres a break in the case to have a quick cuddle and a bit of a snog. Apparently it helps Sherlock think.
“John, it’s a lovely locked room double murder, Lestrade wants us to meet him at the scene” he says, sounding simply delighted.
“Hello John, I’ve just had your results come in. You’re all clear to be deployed, the main office has asked me to tell you that you’re to be at the main barracks for a flight out at 0600 hours tomorrow mrow morning” John just sighs,
They kiss for a bit but after a particularly skilled move with his tongue from Sherlock Johns cock twitches. Sherlock insists John stay in him until he’s hard and they can go again but John says they need to clean Sherlock up and he needs more time before they can go again.
It takes about an hour as they a run full test but have to to wait for his blood work to get back but they won’t arrive until tomorrow so he sits in the waiting room for his 2:00 psych evaluation.
Finally, Lestrade coughs and Mrs Hudson takes that as her sign to walk over and try to calm down a seething Sherlock.
He doesn’t notice the strange looks some people are giving him and barely notices someone has sat in front of him.
Lestrade does a quick scan of the room and nods towards them but heads over to his superintendent. Eventually he excuses himself and makes his way over, grabbing himself a drink on the way.
It takes them a long time to arrive at the Hamra base and when they arrive John has nearly been away from Sherlock for twenty hours, he wonders what Sherlock would be doing right now while John is unloading from the truck.
He couldn’t just blurt out ‘I love you John, would you be interested in a romantic relationship with me’. How pedestrian was that. He and John weren’t pedestrian. Never have been.
John greets the military psychologist and they speak about his post traumatic stress disorder, his work with Sherlock, civilian life and they have apparently already been in contact with Johns personal psychiatrist.
They both move forward and their lips meet. Warm against each other as they finally take the step past no return. This is it now, Sherlock thinks. And there’s no going back.
“Okay, let’s start from the beginning. Obviously something happen on Christmas Eve with mistletoe and John. Lunch didn’t help the situation. You’re in love with John and don’t know if he feels the same, which is why you’ve come to me about relationship advice because you can’t talk to John or Mrs Hudson ‘cause she hasn’t dated since the ‘80’s. And Mycroft’s a prick.”
She grins and releases them from a hug and drags them to the bar. Mrs Hudson has already made herself comfortable and was chatting away to Greg, who’s sat with a beer in his hand.
“John really?” He grumbled. “Why must you wear so many layers?” He asked before grabbing the edge of the shirt and pulling it up and off.
He doesn’t answer even after three rings so John tries Skype and when he gets no answer from that he types a short email telling him how he is and asking him to answer a phone call next time.
He takes a deep breath and calms his breathing. John’s still just gazing at him with a smile. Now, Sherlock thinks, now or never.
John tries to blinks back the stinging in his eyes. He can’t move, can barely see. He’s in such searing pain and his stomach won’t stop bleeding no matter how much pressure he puts on it.
He resumes his work on Sherlock’s cock and Sherlock moans loudly. He’s just on the edge when Sherlock’s phone rings.
“George are you even listening to me? I need to see the crime scene evidence again because your clueless staff have already cleaned up the crime scene without me solving the case. Honestly they were less useless when Anderson was here and he was an idiot”
Sherlock has already hailed a cab and is about to shut the door but John manages to grab it before he closes it and climbs in after Sherlock.
He’s crushed by the attack hug from his mother before he even had chance to lay eyes on her. She begins fussing immediately.
After about fifty photos, Mrs Hudson still hasn’t figured it out, they get ushered out and down the stairs. They grab their coats on the way out and hop into the car that Mycroft has sent. Sherlock will speak to his brother later. He’s had enough of his meddling.
Sherlock made sure they had another round of very enthusiastic and vocal sex earlier. He didn’t want him to leave and kept thinking the car would stop and John would run back down the street and back to Baker Street. Back to him. The car kept moving until it was out of Sherlock’s sight.
“I’m officer Holt from Her Majesty the Queen’s Armed Forces. We have come to inform you that Captain John Watson, formerly of the Northumberland Fusiliers and currently of the fifth Royal Regiment of Fusilers, has due to unforeseen circumstances been involved in a patrol  mission that has been unsuccessful. Captain Watson is and hereforth know to the British Militray Service as missing in action, presumed dead .........”
John collapsed on top of him, exhausted from holding himself up. They kissed slowly and just revealed in their pleasure. John finally rolled off of him and went to the bathroom, bring a cloth to clean Sherlock off.
The far side of the room is just a massive window with double doors to the balcony. Theres a small bed in a corner, because Sherlock never uses those for their primary function. A couch in another. There is a wardrobe and door to an ensuite to facilitate someone actually living in the room. There is a book case with so many different books on science and law and John’s certain he’s never heard of any of these books, some are in foreign languages.
“Alright John? Thank god you and Sherlock are here, I’ve had the press hounding me for the last hour and haven’t even had a chance to step away for a piss” Greg’s directness, as always is refreshing, and John chuckles,
“Sherlock. Sherlock, you’ve zoned out again. If this is too much for you we can keep doing what we’ve been doing.”
Sherlock didn’t know what to expect. He wanted to kiss John some more. He wanted to hold him. He wanted to touch every inch of the body he had er0been denied for years. But maybe John didn’t want that yet. He didn’t know John’s experience with men. Only his own, which was very limited.
When they made it to Baker Street Sherlock was a bundle of nerves but John was strangely calm when he unlocked the door.
She stamps out her smoke with her heel. She herself is dressed in her police service uniform and looks nice.
John sighs, “It’ll be my service dress uniform. Trust Mycroft to deliver it in time for the party. I was hoping to avoid wearing one again.”
Sherlock’s bored again. So he decides to go see Mycroft for cases. And if he happens to ask him to do something about John’s leave then that’s purely coincidental.
They’re lost in the feel of their lips against each other. Sherlock’s hold tightening on John’s hips. John’s hand moves into Sherlock’s hair, the other around his neck drawing him impossibly closer. Sherlock wants to stay like this forever. He feels his heart expand until it feels like it’s going to burst. So this is what happiness feels like.
Sherlock hears nothing after that. He can see their mouth move but there’s only a ringing in his ears and suddenly he’s feeling dizzy. Luckily Mrs Hudson is still clutched to his side keeping him upright.
“Christ Sherlock, Sulfur, really? I leave the house with strict instructions to not blow anything up and your idea of that is to burn it down with Sulfur instead”
The case doesn’t take long and they’re back the next morning. After a long sleep they’re finally having some late lunch when Sherlock’s phone rings again.
John looks over at Sherlock who is animatedly demonstrating to Molly what it would look like as the killers knife enters her scared boyfriends chest. He smiles while looking at Sherlock, he truely did miss him.
“Oh you know, the job he has doesn’t leave a lot of time for relationships. He really needs a bloke that understands that.”
John manages to get Sherlock to do a round and at least make small talk with all the guests before Mrs Hudson brings out some nibbles to eat. It’s only late afternoon and really just a small gathering for a quick celebration. Everyone knows Sherlock doesn’t want a big birthday even though it’s his 40th. He would rather forget it.
John had begun to unwrap but had stopped to watch Sherlock. He slowly unwraps the tiny parcel. Sherlock thinks John had expected another jumper for Christmas again. Sherlock decided to go with something different, more meaningful.
He watches John walk down the hallway and around the corner before he finally come back to his senses and enters the bathroom, still very much distracted by John.
Sherlock moaned. He had never experienced the sensations that were spreading throughout his body towards his groin. John was deftly undoing his top shirt buttons to mouth further down his neck.
Really bored. With no John to constantly annoy him to actually do things there is no point to actually doing any of the things that annoy John. He built most of his day around annoying John.
But he needed advice first. Someone who had experience with relationships who wasn’t John or seventy years old. So he begrudgingly went to the only other person who knew about these things.
John is surprisingly the first one awake. Getting out of bed he heads to the bathroom to shower and brush his teeth. Wrapping his dressing gown around him he goes upstairs to grab a clean pair of pants.
Mycroft’s expression, composed as ever, barely twitches when John mentions Greg’s name but John is tuned to the Holmes’ expressions, or lack thereof, and notices it. Sherlock, beside him, apparently sees it as well.
In response to Sherlock, John tilts his head, changing the angle to deepen the kiss. His hand on Sherlock shoulder slides up and into his hair. Sherlock’s own hands moving further south, towards the base of John’s spine.
He was off talking about the injuries he’d treated when Sherlock noticed his dog tags. They were new. That meant John might have left his old ones behind.
John has to jog over to get in the cab so Sherlock doesn’t leave without him, the adrenaline already beginning to course through his veins.
Mycrofts voice is soothing, almost apologetic. Mycroft has never sounded like that before and is making it seem more real. Sherlock doesn’t know how to react so he just puts his phone on the kitchen table and walks upstairs to Johns room.
“Seriously Sherlock. I know how we feel about each other but I am still technically on active duty and have to leave after your birthday. But until I come back are we going to tell people? I would rather us enjoy this time we have left together without interference.”
“John” he starts. The sound of Mrs Hudson hauling something up the stairs makes them both turn their heads. John’s hand is out of his hair and he clear’s his throat.
“I’ve fingered myself a couple times. I tried to recreate the feeling that I got when I first had penetrative sex. But it was horrible and I was high at the time so this is much better.” Sherlock give John a reassuring smile. “Continue John, please.”
, Anthea had abruptly ushered him out of the room, instructing him to go get some rest. As soon as she had slid the
The look on John's face is priceless. He's stood frozen in the doorway of the living room, wearing one of his typical ugly jumpers and clutching onto two freshly made cups of tea.
He clutches John’s pillow to his chest. The ache is getting worse. His heart feels like it’s about to explode. John isn’t coming back. John promised he would come home and he’s broken that promise.
Sherlock loosens his hold on John and moves back to look at him. John appears expectant. Like he’s waiting for Sherlock to say something.
“Sherlock I’m aware you don’t watch the news for whatever reason but at the moment there is a very bad political militia and extremist groups in Syria that have now moved to start killing and bombing civilians and civilian buildings and there was a hospital bombed just yesterday”
The next hour is basically just Sherlock spreading all the evidence and photos of the crime scene all over the conference room and pacing the room.
Sherlock grins, bounces over to the couch and lounges over it. John grabs the remote, lifts Sherlock’s legs up to sit down and set’s them back down on his lap. He flicks on a crap detective drama just to wind Sherlock up.
“Morning” they say in unison and John says a greeting in return and the Staff Sergeant introduces herself to both of them and it takes the topic off him for now.
John just sighs and walks out the door, just leaning on the wall next to it leaving the door open, needing to hear Sherlock’s mumbling.
0Now you’re just being condescending John it’s an unattractive quality on you and does nothing to help your point that this is a good idea”
He slowly pushes his penis past the first ring of muscle. He lets Sherlock adjust to his girth and after he himself gets used to it he pushes further in. His balls brush against Sherlock arse and he knows he’s bottomed out.
Sherlock is absolutely ecstatic and starts to pace while he deduces and John just stands there and watches Sherlock put the pieces together.
Out on the footpath Sherlock just walks faster to loose John and disappears around a corner. John stops walking, knows he won’t catch Sherlock.
Mycroft has a small ting of red on his cheeks from Sherlock’s last comment but his words don’t deter Sherlock from his speech.
John’s eyes are wide as if he can’t believe what they’ve just done but their breathlessness is evidence. John blinks once, twice, three times before he looks away from Sherlock. A blush rising on his cheeks and he clears his throat managing to regain composure.
After a very short nap the doorbell rings. Sherlock lets Mrs Hudson get it. Probably salesmen again. God Sherlock detests them.
“That is absolutely fine John, I know it’s a big ask, I’ll call back at 1100 hours. If you’re good to go we can have you out to the barracks this afternoon for your physical and psych evaluations. We’d need you to be out here ASAP, so that means with the reinforcements coming over Monday morning. I’ll let you think it over John, thank you for at least thinking about it, I know you have people that rely on you now but we really would appreciate the help Captain.”
“It’s only a two day trip Sherlock. Then it’ll be less than two weeks until I come home. You just have to wait that much longer and when I’m home I promise never to leave you again.”
John is thrusting deep, fast and when a particular thrust has Sherlock calling out his name as it appears John has finally hit his prostate. He wraps his hand around Sherlock’s cock which is leaking precome and strokes it in time with his thrusts.
“That’s great news mate, congratulations.” John shakes Lestrade’s hand. “We’ll have to go out for drinks before I leave again to catch up on everything.” Greg nods in agreement smiling.
Sherlock has already deduced the present John has got him from his glance at the tree earlier but by is pleasantly surprised at the quality.
“I really hate to drag you from civilian life John but there's not nearly any doctors over here that has your experience so it would be great if you come back over and help”.
Hey, so I know that some of this military stuff will be incorrect but I’ve tried my best to research it all but feel free to correct me please. Also I hope you’re still reading. :)
Sherlock can’t believe it. John’s lips are actually on his. Warm and smooth against his own. Just as he feels John about to pull away he adds more pressure. Moving his hands to the small of John’s back he pull him closer. Their bodies almost flush against each other now.
John makes his way over to Sherlock and gives him a hug. Drawing back slowly he lifts his hand to Sherlock’s face and kisses him slowly and tenderly.
“Yeh I know mate. He’s Sherlock bloody Holmes, he wouldn’t be him if he wasn’t a prick occasionally” John laughs lightly.
“Thai” Sherlock answers simply stretching again after he’s finished putting his microscope away in his cupboard.
The ride to Baker Street is quiet and layered with tension, neither wants to speak now but when they get home they will both have a lot to say.
He shuffled over to John and leans his head on John’s shoulder while he stirred the sugar in. John turns his head and kisses Sherlock’s forehead.
They crash into bed a little after midnight with John murmuring a tired “Happy Birthday” to Sherlock before they both pass out.
Breaking into Lestrade house was easy, always had been. For a police detective he was surprisingly lacking in personal security. He didn’t even have a deadbolt or anything for his door, just the lock. Which, for Sherlock, made it incredibly easy to get into.
Not coming up with a reasonable guess as to who it is, he assumes he’s just on the phone. Probably their mother or someone else just as boring.
“I shall give you a tour later John. Or Sherlock can if he wants. He’s spent quite a bit of time here after his first round of rehab.”
“Sherlock I’m not going to lie to them. And it also takes two weeks to get leave accepted so it’s not going to happen this time. I’m sorry.”
“Oh for gods sake. If that’s Geoffrey, tell him we’re not doing it. Tell him unless it’s a double murder or something equally good he can do it himself. How the Metropolitan police service survived in the years before me I have no idea.”
He didn’t want to say goodbye to John because he felt that if he said it then it would be goodbye forever.
Before he can respond Mycroft, who is leaning against the fire place very effortlessly put together like always speaks up.
“Haven’t know him well enough to know if that’s the truth. But at least I’ll still be able to come out to crime scenes, if they’re big enough. Officially I start the Job next Monday and I’m dreading spending my days at a desk if I’m honest. I do still have ten to fifteen years of work until I retire if I’ve saved enough and I don’t particularly want to do that chained to a desk.”
There’s another doctor working along side him and they pass things back and forth and finally after they get the first people stitched up another is placed in front of them.
John has his rifle in his hands. His handgun is in its holder by his waist. And yet he doesn’t feel safe. The quiet is unnerving.
The only response he gets is silence. “Sherlock please. I have to leave now. I just want to say goodbye.”
“Look Sherlock.” He reaches out and takes Sherlock’s other hand. John straightens up and a look of determination is written on his face. John takes another breath, then begins.
Is all he can say because since he left the flat he’s been purposely trying to forget Sherlock, but he knows it wouldn’t last long. He just hoped he would have landed in Syria before he decided to turn back around and go home.
“Molly is the only person who is here for me and even as we speak she’s texting her new boyfriend. She’s clearly here out of obligation to an old friendship and would rather be somewhere else.”
“No not mine Sherlock, it’s dried, was about to finally have a shower but decided to call you, didn’t think you’d answer. We had a busy night last night with some casualties and ‘bout an hour ago finished checking on patients and grabbed some breakfast.”
Last Christmas was not great. John had only been home barely six months and he refused to come with Sherlock to his parents. He claimed his bad mood and the previous years events would prevent him from being a hospitable guest.
"Oh am I not coming with you?" The question sounded a lot sillier out loud than it did in his head, causing John to squirm uncomfortably when Sherlock's eyes flew back from the tea to focus on him.
Sherlock let out a low chuckle, ignoring John’s defensive stance. He crossed to the side of the room to stop in front of a large straw basket, undoing his
Despite finding some comfort in the closeness of the other man, John glanced over at his bed in the room beside his teacher's. Sherlock answered his question before he had time to voice it. "I've requested that your room be cleaned." He slid the connecting
The taller man followed the blonde’s line of sight, gazing over the rooftops of the city. “I see, John.” The smaller of the two turned to give him a look. He continued, “Rather I observe. I know things about people they don’t know about themselves or will possibly ever know.” His voice was distant, almost reflective. He turned to meet John’s eyes. For a moment, they held each other's gaze.
Anthea stood in the entrance of the House, keeping a watchful eye in anticipation of their guest. She flicked her
John was upright in his bed, his heart thrumming in his chest. He panted as his panic slowly began to subside. Then he noticed a shadow framed in moonlight and the familiar smell of tobacco. He turned his head to meet the figure stood in the doorway of the open
“It would be our pleasure.” The dark haired man bowed as the other man hesitantly mimicked his teacher soon after. Irene smiled deviously.
for the two brothers and quickly shut it once they had stepped inside. A few moments of intense silence passed before Lestrade stepped forward.
John wanted to retort with a snide remark of some sort, but his head span in an uneasy grogginess. Letting out a pained moan, he rubbed his forehead with the palm of his hand. Then another smell hit him, which was when he realised he was in Sherlock’s bed. Again.
The sun was scorching and John hated it. They had been sparring for hours that morning and he was exhausted. He had removed the top half of his robe so that his chest was exposed in an attempt to keep his body cool, but there was no breeze and the sweat on his skin glistened in the sunlight. With one hand on his knee and the other clutching onto his
"How many times must I say it?" The dark haired man huffed. "I need to examine you to know what I'm working with." He flitted his eyes back down to John's crotch. "Perhaps a different type of drug next time." He was still talking to himself. John felt like he wasn't even in the room. Then Sherlock's attention was suddenly back on him, a genuinely friendly smile spread across his face. "Ginger?"
The blonde turned to throw the other man an indignant look. “Pervert!” His cheeks were burning with embarrassment still, but his face descended into that of confusion when he realised Sherlock looked genuinely surprised. John decided to throw him a small
A thick silence enveloped the room as the blonde struggled to recall his surroundings. He still couldn’t see into the crowd, his sight impaired by the impossibly bright lights that held him captive in the spotlight. But despite the lack of vision and the panicked haze in his brain, one thing was for certain:
pipe. John was about to tuck in when he realised only one skewer sat between the two of them. He was about to mention it when his stomach grumbled loudly. Several other patrons turned to look at him.
“Insolence!” Sherlock barked, causing John to almost jump upon realising his teacher was right by his side. The dark haired man then shot forwards to land a harsh backhand slap across the mystery woman’s face, leaving an angry, but silent scowl on her face. John gawped; he’d never seen Sherlock hit someone before. “Dispose of her.” He commanded the now terrified looking
John looked up, somewhat dazed. He scrunched his eyebrows in confusion when he noticed Sherlock wasn't looking at his face, but at the lower half of his body. He followed his line of sight and, to his horror, realised he had wet himself. The adrenaline rush from their scuffle and the gut punch must've forced it out of him without him realising. The smaller man could feel his face burn in embarrassment - he felt utterly mortified.
"Wider", Sherlock murmured. John followed orders obediently as the other man languidly inserted his cock into his mouth, taking pleasure in the way the shorter man's damp tongue ran along the underside of his shaft. He didn't hesitate to push further still, his tip touching the back of John's throat, causing him to choke. "Relax", purred Sherlock, pushing the back of John's head into him so his lips were at the base of his dick. John was about to wriggle away when his hands met the leather of his flatmate's trousers. Suddenly the need to breathe was of far less importance as he revelled in the softness of the lambs skin under his fingertips. It was then that the smell of leather hit John's nostrils, alongside that of Sherlock's scent and the combination of the two drove him wild. Wanting to take more of the detective in, his hands reached his backside and pushed into him. Sherlock hissed and regretfully began to withdraw himself. The doctor gasped and then coughed as the entrance to his windpipe was unblocked, thin trails of saliva mixed with pre-cum dripping from his mouth. As he began to inhale, the detective pushed his head forward again to repeat the same action as before. John moaned gratefully around his flatmate's cock as it made its way into him. He gripped onto Sherlock's leather-clad arse cheeks in anticipation as the taller man thrust into his mouth four or five more times before ejaculating down his throat. John winced as Sherlock came, his pained expression growing as the detective pulled him by his hair, angling his head so as to make eye contact with one another again. "Swallow", he panted, hunched over John. But he had already begun to do so, his eyelids fluttering nervously. Sherlock let out a long sigh and relaxed his grip, slowly moving away from the smaller man who now felt somewhat abandoned by the sudden distance between them. Quirking an eyebrow, he pointed downwards, "Now kiss my boots."
“Christ”, he puffed, rolling a shoulder back with a click. Unbeknown to him, his opponent had been staring at him the whole time. An unreadable expression sat on his face, his eyes burning with more intensity than usual. When the blonde glanced back down to face the taller man, Sherlock quickly turned to head back inside.
John’s body responded before he realised what he was doing. Clambering towards the door on his hands and knees, he was vaguely aware of the drugs that continued to course through his veins. He wobbled as his vision blurred, feebly reaching out towards the
“I’ve never been more certain of anything in my life.” Sherlock announced, his gaze still fixed on John. “Besides,” he took a brief moment to glance at his brother from the corner of his eyes, “When have I ever been wrong?”
Sherlock only just ducked away from the second punch when the smaller man's roared, "Where is she?!" He continued to aim his dazed fury at other man, who in turn dodged every hit aimed at him, occasionally deflecting the onslaught of fists, elbows and knees that came his way.
Heads up, folks: I've added dark!Sherlock as an additional tag to this fic as things are going to start to become tad sinister. Expect more non-con, drugging, unhealthy relationships and possibly even darker themes to come
“I can’t do this!” John whined without hesitation, frustration tinging his features. It was early in the morning and the blonde felt groggy. Sherlock however looked perfectly at ease, lounging on his side on the floor opposite. He took a sip of the tea John had brewed moments before as he held up his head with his other hand. The smaller of the two blinked at him, expecting a response, but sighed when he realised his protests were being ignored. He glanced back down at the large
The other man flashed him a toothy grin. “Splendid!” Then he leapt up with a jovial bounce in his step, “Lunch?”
A serious look descended upon the other man's face at that moment. The blonde thought he could spot a hint of worry and possibly doubt. "We've yet to figure that part out." He mumbled weakly.
John frowned. He opened his mouth to clarify, but was interrupted by Sherlock, “Fetch me a razor, will you? I fear this stubble will only serve to give my brother all the more reason to nag me.” John quickly shut his mouth, swallowing his confusion and noting the other man’s request. He gave him a quick sharp nod and turned to leave the room. “Oh and John?”
. Although his initial grogginess would cloud his mind, his lips would slowly curve upwards into a soft smile. He enjoyed his routine of rolling out of his bed to brew them a pot to enjoy on the porch together. He reckoned the other man rather appreciated their peaceful companionship also.
made their way to the middle of the garden, quietly chatting and occasionally giggling amongst themselves. John admired their colourful
The moment however did not last long. "On your knees." The command felt misplaced and John crooked his head upwards, as if to check whether he had heard him right. Sherlock furrowed his brow at the look, "Do I have to ask you again?"
“Everyone, outside, now!” Lestrade was running around the House, ushering everyone outside into the front yard. They all quickly aligned themselves into two lines on either side of the path, ready for inspection. Just as the last servant ran out of the House and joined the end of a line, eliciting a quick smack round the back of the head from Lestrade, the
Sherlock answered after the first ring and he assured him he had arrived safely and would call as much as possible. He would write some more as well. John had to hang up a short time later.
They both ducks their heads, breaking eye contact and huff a laugh. How ridiculous is this. They’re acting like nervous school girls.
Sherlock sighs and pulls his phone out of his dressing gown and texts Lestrade despite the fact he just left. Then he checks his email and then his blog and nothing.
Sherlock is too distracted watching John’s lips move in anticipation to really understand what he says.
After they finish shopping they make their way back to Baker Street and Sherlock has already deduced by the light and sound emanating from upstairs what awaits him for the rest of his birthday. They all head upstairs and as Sherlock predicted everyone is there and shouts ‘Happy Birthday’ when they enter.
But then again, Sherlock left without saying goodbye and making everyone think he was dead. John sighs, he’d forgiven Sherlock for that ages ago but it’s still always there.
Please go and read chapter 21 if MCD does trigger you and you do want to read the story but it does contain spoilers but I’ve been told that it makes people feel a lot better about the MCD.
John reached up and grabbed one of his hands and placed on the back of his head. Sherlock got the hint and thread his fingers into Johns hair. John hollowed out his cheeks and began to move his mouth faster up and down Sherlocks cock. Sherlock’s hand began to push Johns head in time to the even rhythm. The feeling in the pit of his stomach became stronger and he suddenly pulled johns head off him and let go.
“God Sherlock, you’re making me depressed listening to this boring life you have planned for John. I’m sure if you told him that, he would tell you he’d rather have his life of excitement with you over anything else in the world.”
John honestly has no words, she’s obviously telling the truth because really that’s Mycroft exactly and also he can’t take in all the new information he’s just received.
Suddenly John steps infinitely closer and Sherlock’s breathe catches as he feels the heat radiating from John. God he just wants to step forward into John arms and embrace him. Hold him forever and never let go.
Sherlock is interrupted from his thoughts of John when his phone starts ringing. He picks it up. Then puts it back down.
Sherlock barely acknowledges John has spoken, only replying “Hmmmm, yes John, later.” His eyes never leaving his work.
“It’s tradition John. Even if Mrs Hudson doesn’t know, we certainly will. We don’t won’t a curse or anything from an old wives tale hanging over our heads, pardon the pun.”
who’s comments have always been so welcome and I want to thank you for your support. I hope you and others will join me in the next adventure.
John. It’s John. Sherlock can’t believe it. He freezes for a second. He could be hearing things. Johns in Syria. Sherlock half stands half turns around and does some sort of weird spin and nearly unbalances himself. But strong arms are there to steady him and he looks at the person in front of him. It’s John.
“I know love.” John tightens his grip, places a small kiss on Sherlock’s neck and let’s go, returning to the sitting room.
The car takes John to the base and upon arrival John puts his beret on, grabs his duffle and exits the car.
The others retired to Mycroft’s study and have a couple more drinks. Greg asks about the piano in Mycroft’s study and so he demonstrates. Greg was entrapped.
“Mother, John or I will inform you of what has happened when we think it’s appropriate. Now let’s sit and have some breakfast so you can embarrass me some more shall we.”
“I was thinking John. That very soon you will be a very brave and courageous man and go back to fight for your country and that we don’t have a lot of time left. And I was thinking that maybe,” Sherlock leans closer to press his lips against John’s ear.
Mrs Hudson’s call comes from the landing and John has enough time to tuck the dog tags back into Sherlock’s shirt and pat them before stepping away and around towards the door.
He’s had just about enough of her ridicule and attitude towards Sherlock, who has not only helped her solved murders, earning her a promotion, he did not actually say anything to Anderson’s wife at the Christmas party years previous.
John follows walking past Donovan, but hearing her mumble something under her breath about how Sherlock is psychotic and that he should have stayed dead makes him stop in his tracks.
“John, I’m so glad you’re back. I nearly ran out of cadavers for Sherlock to experiment on. And you can finally meet Simon. I’ve told him all about you. He can’t believe someone can put up with Sherlock everyday and not get sick of him.”
“Sherlock, I’ll need your assistance. You being half a head taller than me, I need to you lean down.”
A/N: Hi, now that I’ve finished this fic I’ve been told that I should pre-warn that their will be a major character death. If you feel like this would discourages you from reading I understand but I am letting you know this is only fic one in a three fic collection.
By the time John has reached the bedroom Sherlock has already stripped of all his clothes and is sitting on the edge of the bed completly void of clothing. John will never get used to the sight of Sherlock stark naked. God he’s beautiful. Gorgeous, incredible, sexy. More words run through his head as he shucks his own
Sherlock arrives at Mycroft’s office and his secretary Andrea?, irrelevant, tells him to wait as Mycroft’s busy. Apparently it’s not a business meeting or she would have said. It can’t be a friend because Mycroft doesn’t have any. And Sherlock doesn’t want to think about Mycroft and any romantic interests so he trys to narrow it down.
Molly comes and gives his a big birthday hug and greets Sherlock’s parents. Sherlock retreats into his room under the guise of putting his shopping away. Sherlock’s parents greet everyone and Mycroft introduces Greg to the Holmes’. After Sherlock doesn’t emerge five minutes later John goes to fetch him.
When his eyes trailed to his hairline there was a dark red patch and Sherlock immediately knew it was blood and almost began to panic, then he remember John was a doctor and it probably wasn’t his.
Sherlock’s voice has raised significantly and the other few patrons that are finishing their meal start to look over. Sherlock calms down suddenly.
The third fic will start when John is returned safely home and will be going from John and Sherlock’s POV so feel free to skip book 2 if you don’t like Mystrade and I will add a summary chapter at the beginning on book 3 so noone misses out on the important things.
No response. John is beginning to look worried. Sherlock just looks above them, hoping John gets his hint. John does look. And he freezes also.
This one looks bad. Really bad. George is bleeding from his abdomen and from his left arm. The bullet has hit the coroted
Sherlock’s bored again and as it’s Christmas Eve morning now he decides to just sleep until the yard’s Christmas party tonight. He’s decided to go out of pure boredom.
“Sherlock” he begins, not knowing how to explain that he’ll be leaving for a unknown amount of time and what he will be doing.
He extends his hand to Lestrade, who shakes it and says, “No worries Mycroft I’ll see you at the yard’s Christmas party then”
Last time was hard enough but this time he had a sick feeling in pit of his stomach. He hoped. He hoped with all his heart he would see John again. Two months wasn’t a lot of time. And then John would be home. Soon. He kept chanting the word in his head. The pit of his stomach was filled with dread.
It didn’t take long before John was moaning his name and warning Sherlock of his oncoming orgasm. Sherlock just swallowed it down and kissed his way back up to John’s face.
John makes himself so tea and some breakfast and reads the paper at the kitchen table. Sherlock needs to think of something interesting because his mind is wandering to last night.
John certainly didn’t miss the small blush on Mycroft’s cheeks when Greg ‘accidentally’ brushed his hand reaching for the gravy. Neither did Sherlock.
Only to find him passed out face first onto his bed, luckily making it into some pyjamas before doing so, not that John would have minded.
“John. John I want that. Want you forever. The two of us against the world. I can’t believe you want me too. Can’t believe this is real. This is real isn’t it?”
Sherlock’s mother and Mrs Hudson insist he play something on his violin. So the flat turns silent except Sherlock’s playing.
His back arches and he stills. He coming into Sherlock right now so he can’t think. His brain is just white with pleasure.
“I love that idea Sherlock but you’ll have cases again soon. ‘Murderers only have Christmas off to spend time with their families before their inevitable incarceration.’ Isn’t that what you say?”
“Mate seriously. When you’re not looking at him, he’s looking at you. Always has. Like now. He’s talking to Molly but he’s watching you, soon he’ll make up an excuse to come over and talk to you. At lunch he’ll sit next to you or across from you. If Sherlock doesn’t have feelings for you then I’ll hand my badge in. I’m meant be a detective, and I detect, that Sherlock Holmes is in love with you.”
Anyway 10 minutes later Sherlock emerges from the bathroom in his pyjamas, another set thank god, not the ones he spent all day in and takes his tea, muttering a thanks and goes near the fireplace to sit in his chair and flick through his phone.

John thinks Sherlock is just a bit jealous.

And again, their swords broke off only to lock again. "You are more than all of this and you know it."
Their shared gaze was only broken when Sherlock closed the door behind him as he stepped into the room. John took this as an opportunity to look at himself in the mirror. Despite the pull he felt towards his teacher, he felt equally as determined not to let it show.
“My my, we weren’t expecting you to arrive so soo-“, the smile quickly dropped. “Goodness gracious, look at the state of you!”
“No.” Lestrade and Sherlock both threw him a confused look. “I’ve seen that man before.” The blonde indicated behind him. “I’m sure I recognise that fac-”, but as he turned to refer to the man in question, both him and Lestrade’s backup had disappeared. John frowned in confusion, his eyes darting to every corner of the street. He took a few steps forward to peek around the corners of the buildings that split the path in two, but still the men were nowhere to be seen.
