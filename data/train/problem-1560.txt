“No,” Mr. Musgrave says. “It was eerie. It was like they all just walked out of their houses and decided to leave. Which is probably what happened, you know. I think they all just emigrated to America.”
Irene is working steadily, slicing apples. Moriarty is painting leaves cut out of pastry with red and green food colouring, and Sherlock rolls his eyes. Many of the bakers are making their filling now, pastry resting in the fridge. Some are nervous, some seem confident, and some are having fun, exchanging small smiles and a word or two. John is crushing walnuts, using a dish towel and a rolling pin instead of the KitchenAid right next to his elbow, which would give him a more even consistency. He’s humming contentedly under his breath, and his station smells heavily of cinnamon. His workstation is also a mess, and he is covered in flour, in short he looks exactly like the kind of amateur Sherlock thought he would meet here. Sherlock turns away, already bored.
Sherlock’s mood sours somewhat when he notices John isn’t waiting for him in front of 221, and his mood goes completely to shit when he notices the knocker on 221 is as straight as an arrow. That can only mean one thing. So he fortifies himself with a deep breath and goes upstairs to meet his brother.
John gets up and prepares a bottle with as little conscious thought as he gave the tea. He goes after Mary into Rosie’s room and catches Mary unbuttoning her shirt, as if she’s were ready to breast-feed Rosie. “Don’t,” he says before he can think better of it. “I just got her used to the bottle, I’ve got no intention of going through that again the next time you…” he stops himself just in time, but he can see that Mary understood him perfectly.
“Oh, I wish somebody had told you before, you poor boys. I thought Mr Lestrade might have mentioned it,” she frets, clearly upset. She looks at each of them in turn, sadness cutting deep lines into her soft, kind face. “The Gate has been closed for many years.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Whatever.” He gets up and whirls into his coat. “Molly, I’m leaving,” he yells at the front of the room. “See you later, John. Try the medicine I gave you and record the results.”
“Yes, quite, your ability to cook dead animals together with root vegetables is nothing if not legendary.. ow!”
John takes a bite and cocks his head. “It’s good. Did you use my gran’s Fladen recipe as an inspiration?”
Sherlock looks up at the ceiling and considers. Eight months will be tough, and he’ll miss John. On the other hand, he has always wanted to play Mack the Knife, he’s got some interesting ideas what to do with the character…
Molly’s cake is lovely, her hidden design is a butterfly, and her cake is decorated beautifully. The judges praise her design and the taste.
Sherlock looks up from the rabbit, and his oddly pale eyes pin John in place as effectively as if he were a bug in a display case. “Nightmare. You’re alone, in a new place, you were recently bombed.” He adds, a little more quietly, “And my condolences for your father’s death.”
Sherlock looks up when John enters, and his expression resembles that of a small child caught with his hand in the biscuit jar. It’s adorable, not that John would ever admit that out loud.
“We need to find out who she is, Sherlock,” John says, hoping his voice sounds steadier than he feels. He puts the lamp down and straightens, looking down at this woman, who has dental work in her mouth that doesn’t exist on Dera, that has never existed on Dera, where dentistry is primarily done by Fey’a, who use completely different techniques and materials. “When did she get here? Where did she come from?”
Good sex, which he has been thinking about more than he would like to admit. He’s also been thinking about John in the parking lot, cutting him down to size, and Sherlock genuinely can’t remember the last time that happened, and he can’t believe how little he minds.
John calls the half hour, and a hush settles over the backstage area. Seb’s already done and in costume, and sitting in the green room having a cup of tea.
He takes the gun and with one smooth movement brings it to his temple. His hands aren’t shaking at all.
Mrs Hudson hesitates for a moment, then says, “Look, I don’t know how much Mr Lestrade has told you, but maybe stay out of the Forest for now, all right?”
John cracks his neck from side to side and yawns. He’s almost asleep on his feet. It’s Thursday, and it’s been a rough few days. He came down to the basement for some of Molly’s grain coffee, and saw Sherlock sitting bent over his microscope. So he sat down in the only other chair in the room, the one near the door, the one John always sits in when he waits for Sherlock to be done so they can go home. He leans his head back against the wall and enjoys the quiet for a few moments.
It has the desired effect, because his mother and his aunt Ruth both excuse themselves with matching mischievous grins to go watch the show.
Sherlock looks at the vials, then back at the killer. “Jim pays you for this?” he asks, incredulous.
John sighs and rubs a hand over his face. “I’d just hoped you'd learned to trust me enough to take me with you.”
Their eyes lock, and the ludicrousness of arguing exactly how to term the parallel Otherworld they’ve stumbled into seems to hit Sherlock at the same time as John, because they both start laughing. Their hilarity has a hysterical edge to it, but John still feels loads better when they finally calm down.
The next bit is actually controversial, because a lot of Austrians eat their Powidltascherln with breadcrumbs, and even in my own family some people prefer them with breadcrumbs, but trust me:
Sherlock smiles. “If you think I’d let anyone else make our wedding cake, you’re certifiably insane.”
“Don’t do this to me, all right?” John says quietly, holding Sherlock’s gaze. “Don’t check out and leave me alone in this mess, all right? Hell, Sherlock, I’m going to have a daughter, and I need you around to help me put the fear of God into her future boyfriends, all right? Whatever you tried to do with that stupid drug trip, it’s not worth it. Moriarty isn’t worth it, he wasn’t worth it the first time, he isn’t worth it now. I can’t…” John’s voice breaks a little, and he continues in a near whisper, “I can’t do this alone. Any of this.”
John rubs at his neck and looks at Sherlock fondly. “You make a surprisingly comfortable pillow, given how little you eat.”
John keeps silent, hoping that Sherlock will talk some more about it. His fingers on Sherlock’s scalp keep rubbing gently in little circles, and he feels some of the tension go out of Sherlock’s body.
he almost says, and bites down on it. Not necessarily because he thinks Mycroft doesn’t already know this, but because saying it hurts too much.
“My granny used to make this extremely heavy coconut cake for all our birthdays, and last year I made it for my cousin’s wedding and she bloody cried.” Neela takes a sip of her pint and grins. “It was embarrassing.”
Sherlock doesn’t answer for so long that John almost thinks he won’t. Then he wordlessly reaches into his trouser pocket and withdraws a much-folded letter. He hands it to John almost absently.
“Seriously?” John asks, but when Sherlock just gives him a look, he grabs a pair of waxed gloves and a pair of tweezers from the workspace. Slowly, gently, he pries her lips apart. Sherlock hands him a small lamp, and John holds it close to her mouth.
He gets dressed and steps out of the examination room, looking around. A part of him is deeply relieved that Sherlock is nowhere to be seen, and a part of him is equally deeply disappointed.
She only notices him when he slides into the seat across from her. The eighteen months since he last saw her haven’t been kind to her. Her hands are shaking in a way that has nothing to do with cold, and her eyes have a furtive, desperate edge that wasn’t quite as apparent the last time they met.
"Waiting for you to pick the workstation with the optimal climate, obviously, so I can pick the one with the second-best climate," John says, calmly unfazed by Sherlock's rudeness.
Sherlock breaks his scone in half and inhales the warm, homey smell. He breaks off a piece and spreads a bit of butter on it, which starts to melt into the scone. He puts it into his mouth, and closes his eyes for a moment.
Sherlock bodily turns John so he’s got his back turned to the other boys, who’ve started staring and whispering. He grips John by the shoulders and forces him to look at Sherlock and nowhere else. “Listen to me. John. Listen to me. Breathe, and listen. I found something.”
John feels warm all over, maybe from the cider (he doesn’t usually drink) or the company, or the way she’s touching him. “Yes, let’s talk a bit more about that amputation, that was much more fun.”
“Your YouTube channel is all science, no stories, you’re a bit of the other extreme. No wonder you hated each other on sight,” John says with a grin, then he adds, “Well, that, and he’s clearly a wanker.”
It’s not an emotion he’s proud of, it’s not something he’ll ever say out loud, but he can’t help the little possessive, special thrill that goes through him whenever Sherlock introduces John as his friend.
John relaxes visibly. “I’ve had friendlier exchanges with the Taliban,” he mutters, and Sherlock snorts in amusement before he can help himself.
It’s so bad tonight that he contemplates taking her to a hospital. She’s barely coherent, her eyes don’t focus on him properly anymore, she’s lost any coordination, and the insults she’s hurling at him and the world in general lack their usual razor bite.
Suddenly, the entire circle seems to be spinning. John loses his footing and falls to his knees, disoriented and nauseous, the pressure in his ears almost unbearable. He screams, “Sherlock!” as he presses his hands over his ears.
Sherlock dismisses any thought of Lestrade with an annoyed little wave. He was spooked before, but now he’s glowing with excitement, his eyes sharp. Sherlock’s clearly enjoying this, and if John is entirely honest with himself, he is too.
"I did tell you all of this," Sherlock answers, not even trying to keep the annoyance out of his voice.
Sherlock’s about to follow when his way is barred by his brother. Mycroft is wearing his usual three-piece suit and is carrying a stick instead of an umbrella, and there’s a serious expression on his face. “Progress?” he asks without any preliminary pleasantries.
“Which means what, exactly?” Sherlock says, staring at Mrs Hudson like he’s trying to read her mind to figure out whether she’s lying or not.
“Five weeks ago,” Mrs Hudson answers breezily, ignoring his rudeness. She’s always taken his directness in stride, and he appreciates her for that, among other things.
There’s a knock at his door, and a voice in the darkness. “John! Get up! Come on, everybody’s already downstairs.”
But John knows. John knows why they’re here. They’re here because of Sherlock bloody Holmes and his stubborn, unthinking curiosity that radiates from his entire body in his every waking minute.
“This is a serious business proposition,” Sherlock points out, gesturing at the printed out Excel sheets and floor plans.
Sherlock is silent for a second. “Blonde woman, divorced, recently, mark from the ring hadn’t faded yet, hair dyed, too much make-up, husband cheated on her with a younger woman. Two children, primary school…”
“We need to get up,” Sherlock gets out between kisses, but he knows he isn’t being very consistent, because he’s wrapping his legs around John to drag him closer.
“Sherlock,” the doctor says, turning his head so he’s looking at her out of bleary eyes. “Do you know where you are?”
“Did you use it?” Irene asks, cigarette poised between her lips. Sherlock absently wonders how her make-up is always so perfect.
John wipes the dust off his stage manager’s desk with a gentle and loving hand. He straightens the roll of gaffer tape and adjusts the headphones on their hook. Then he steps out onto the stage.The seats are covered in dust sheets. The headlights are in storage, and the sickly glow of the working lights does nothing to penetrate the deep gloom of the auditorium.
“Would you like to have a celebratory dinner with me there afterwards?” Sherlock says, as quickly as he can, before he can think himself out of this, his heart fully in charge for once.
“Men don’t… do… that… with other men,” John stutters. “How… I mean, how would that even work? And…. just… it’s wrong.”
She walks up to him, struggling into her coat. He steps towards her and helps her automatically, and she pats him on the arm affectionately. “Thank you, dear.” She smiles at him. “I’m afraid I’m not as young as I once was. It’s a bit late for me, and I’m about to head home.”
“Ah, they’re not that bad. Probably helped that they met Tom Hiddleston last year when you did that play together and your mum didn’t like him. She even asked me what you want for Christmas this year.”
Sherlock has nothing to say to that. He hasn't laughed as much as he has since he met John in years. There was nobody around to care whether he did.  He swallows, and John pulls him in for a kiss that’s as demanding as it is gentle, and Sherlock opens up to it, lets John kiss him and kiss him and kiss him until he forgets everything outside of them.
They always knew the leg was psychosomatic. It doesn’t need a genius to deduce that a shoulder wound won’t lead to a weak leg. But at first they thought the tremor in his hand was nerve damage. But after about a hundred tests, they connected it to his PTSD, told him to get some therapy, and to have a nice life.
“But it was my choice, Sherlock. Mine,” John says, and he’s not yelling, but the anger in his voice is very loud nonetheless. “You took away my choices, and you lied to me. For weeks, you lied to me.”
before putting the phone away. What he really wants is to phone John and celebrate, but he knows there’s zero chance that they won’t end up in bed together, and that’s the last thing they both need right now.
John sighs, predictable annoyance about the walls. He clears his throat, but hesitates forming words, which tells Sherlock that John doesn’t want to fight, but can’t help asking, “What’s all this, then? New Case?” His voice is rough and Sherlock can hear the bone-deep weariness in the scrape of his throat and the heaviness of his vowels.
John huffs a bit in surprised amusement. “Well, good for us, I suppose. Come on, I’ve got your book here.”
The room smells of vanilla, cinnamon, honey and nuts. Many bakers are doing baklava-style pastries. Some, like Janine and Mary, are making savoury pies. Irene made a spanakopita that looks stunningly perfect. Moriarty is doing his deconstructed thing again, he’s made small filo pastry rolls and is currently soaking them in syrup.
It’s already turning dark by the time John walks out of the surgery. Sherlock has been waiting in front of the door for two solid hours by then, and he’s lost all feeling in his fingers and toes.
John walks over to Sherlock and wraps his arms around him from behind, wrapping them both in the sheet. Sherlock’s skin is cold under the thin robe, and John wonders how long he’s been up and whether he slept at all.
“I almost made special brownies for my sister’s hen party, then thought better of it. Her friends are stupid enough without getting them high,” Janine says, reaching for the teapot.
John sighs. Sherlock catches his eyes and gives him a humourless half-smile of acknowledgement, and John knows they’re thinking the same thing. There goes any help they’ll get from the Irregulars.
Sherlock rubs his fingers around the knotted scar tissue and says, keeping his voice low, “I started baking in rehab.”
Of course Sherlock chooses this exact moment to emerge from the dressing room. He starts a bit when he sees John and Mary. “Oh, you’re awake!”
Finally, after what seems like an eternity, John says, “I can’t get up.” His voice sounds hoarse with exhaustion and disuse. At Sherlock’s questioning frown, he gestures at his legs. “My leg. It hurts.”
“Come off it,” John snaps. “Don’t play the victim here. You shot my best friend through the chest. What did you expect, a thank you note? Flowers?”
“What would be lovely?” John asks as he enters the room. He takes the vacant place next to Sherlock and helps himself to tea and a scone.
“Holmes told us to be on the lookout for a bloke, over six foot, odd boots, left-handed, sounds a bit like you two, like he’s not from here.”
“Oh, shut up,” Sherlock answers, and everybody laughs, then John asks Mike a question about his job and Sherlock tunes out the rest of the conversation to answer this incredibly stupid YouTube comment. But he’s entirely aware that John is standing a bit too close to him, and that their arms brush whenever either of them shifts. He doesn’t move away. John doesn’t, either.
“You should say that to Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock points out mildly. “You can’t go on doing two jobs and getting paid for one forever.”
“All right.” Sherlock steps back and lets John go into the bedroom to collect the rest of his clothing. When he comes out he’s fully dressed, and Sherlock thinks of soldiers putting on battle fatigues, because John looks like a different person, dressed and in control again.
John sighs. “Give me the address. And then you’ll be an honest citizen for once and go get the Watch. I’ll tell you what to say to Lestrade.”
“John.” Stronger this time, and John looks up, directly into Sherlock’s eyes. He looks more alert than the last few times he’s been conscious, and John gets up immediately to give him some water.
John’s heart starts pounding wildly at the implication, and the look in Sherlock’s eyes. “Yes,” he says, his voice sounding as strangled as Sherlock’s.
“No, you won’t,” Lestrade interrupts whatever Donovan was about to say. “You’ll both stay out of it. This is Watch business. We won’t press charges for the break-in because you gave us valuable information, but next time we won’t be so lenient. Understood?”
The relief in the room is palpable, and the actors each go. Irene shrugs into her coat and leans down to Sherlock. “How about a coffee? Help you pass the time until your fitting? Maybe I could tag along to the fitting, even, give you my expert opinion?”
“More like for you, me and blowjobs,” Sherlock mutters and smiles when John almost stumbles out of the car with laughter.
John looks at him searchingly, but finally he nods and accepts Sherlock’s words at face value, then goes back to reading his paper.
Billy’s squatting in a run-down house by the river with a few of his friends, a band of street kids from ten to eighteen who call themselves the Irregulars. Most of them are orphans, others ran away from homes that made them wish they were orphans.
Nothing else has been quick. The wallpaper Anderson picked out was a nightmare, so they had to replace it, the sofa was missing two of its four legs when it was delivered, and actually hanging and focusing lights went on straight through the weekend, because Mike’s useless. He disappears every day before lunch, and even before that, his hands are shaking too much to be of any use whatsoever. So John has been doing two jobs, and the strain is showing. The crew has been pressuring him to talk to Mrs Hudson, but he just doesn’t have the time. And they all know what she’s going to say anyway. Mike is family. She won’t fire him, no matter how late he is or how much he fucks up. It’s her one Achilles’ heel as a theatre owner. She loves her crew, and she’s loyal to them, and most of the time, that’s a huge asset, but sometimes that loyalty is misplaced, or abused, and it takes a long time for her to see this sometimes.
“The one interesting thing about Kitty and Violet’s murders was how he got them to drink the poison, and he just forced them to at gunpoint. Dull,” Sherlock says dismissively.
Sherlock skips the mediterranean buffet they were promised for dinner in favour of a few sandwiches he filched from the catering tent. He eats in his room, then writes up a few notes for a blog entry on how heat changes the molecular structure of the batter, and how to calculate optimal baking times.
It’s the following Tuesday. It’s three in the afternoon. There’s nothing on the telly, and Sherlock hasn’t even had coffee today. There are no nicotine patches on his arms, and nothing exciting has happened to them in over 24 hours.
“Well, we’ve both made a Sachertorte, and when we wrap here today, we’re going to have a taste-off.”
John curses himself for the biggest idiot on the planet. He’s done this so often during the last few days that he’s lost count. He wonders how he could have misread the situation so badly as to honestly think there’s anything left to rekindle there. Obviously, Sherlock is no longer interested. Obviously, he’s moved on and now everything is awkward and stilted because Sherlock is aware that John is still in love with him. They’ve barely exchanged ten words that weren’t related to the production since that dinner, and John isn’t sure he blames Sherlock.
Sherlock runs a hand through his hair. “You know what I am? Deep down?” he asks, and he can hear the anger in his voice, only it’s not necessarily directed at John. “I’m a junkie, John, always looking for the next hit. So the fact that I
Mycroft looks up at John and gives him a slight, pitying smile. “Sentiment, Dr Watson. You exposed my brother to quite a lot of it.”
John huffs a laugh into the darkness, and Sherlock wishes he could see his face, see what smile he’s wearing now. “Good to know you’re not a maudlin drunk. A chatty one, though.”
“Poison. He was found dead when Sergeant Donovan went into his cell to question him. Apparently he had a vial of poison sewn into the hem of his shirt. Clever of him, somewhat surprisingly, since otherwise he was so very dull,” Sherlock muses, his tone academically dry.
Sherlock grins at him, pleased as always by the compliment, and almost gleeful at the new puzzle. “Let’s open it.”
“What if nothing happens?” John asks s as they walk out of the city and follow the now familiar route to the forest.
Sherlock smiles and sets his phone down. He walks back to his pastry and tests whether it’s cooled yet. Still hot.
And all the while Sherlock is dumbstruck, lost for words, lost for thought, as John takes him apart and takes something from Sherlock he obviously needs, and Sherlock lets him, lets him have it all. Whatever John wants, he can take it and welcome to it, and Sherlock tries to say this without words by meeting John’s rolling hips with his own, by kissing him back like the world is ending, by biting his neck and panting into his ear and running reverent, greedy hands over John’s body.
Emma makes a face. “People don’t want to hear that, even if it’s the truth. Try ‘it sounded like fun’?”
"Yes. Are you taking a cab tomorrow or going by tube? Because if you're taking a cab we could share."
Irene’s strawberry sponge cake looks fantastic, and the judges love it. She beams and returns to her station confidently.
Sherlock draws back and looks at John critically, at the many data points that make up John Watson. “First, you’re obviously bored, you even admitted it on your blog. Second, you’ve been back from Afghanistan for about a year now, and your limp only improved when you were on Bake Off, so something about Bake Off made you better. I’m guessing you respond well to adrenaline and pressure, and given that you were limping badly when Bake Off started, your daily life provides little of both. Locum work?”
There’s one thing Sherlock knows about himself: He can’t do this. Not as long as he’s not entirely sure that he can be trusted with John’s heart.
“Is it a hallucination if you know it’s not real?” John asks, and the amused warmth in his voice soothes over Sherlock’s raw nerves like a balm.
“When did you finally decide to get your eyesight checked?” Sherlock rushes out to prevent John from saying whatever it is he was going to say. Sherlock’s one hundred percent sure that it wasn’t
His father nods his agreement. “Good work, son. Admittedly we’re not sure why you took this job, but it will give your reputation within the theatre community a boost, saving a production like this.”
“Welcome to Musgrave Manor, boys,” the gentleman says to them, shaking each of their hands in turn. “I’m Charles Musgrave.”
is definitely out - so he just nods and meets John’s eyes.There’s something in John’s gaze, something warm, something
He approaches the table hesitantly. Everyone else is already there, including a petite blonde woman Sherlock doesn’t know but who’s so obviously related to John that it can only really be Harry. She looks very little like her childhood self he remembers from the picture in John’s recipe book, but the resemblance between her and John is still strong enough to mark them as siblings.
“Let’s not get over-excited, I don’t know what they’ll offer yet,” Sherlock cautions, going back to packing up his equipment, mostly to hide how much his hands are shaking.
“I don’t know,” Sherlock says, and he hates that he’s sure that Mrs Hudson can hear how much the words pain him.
John’s lips are on his before the door is even fully closed behind them. He’s peeling Sherlock’s coat off and kissing him with a single-minded intensity that makes Sherlock’s knees weak. John’s lips are cold and his hands are cold, but Sherlock minds neither as he struggles to get John out of as many clothes as quickly as he can.
Mycroft doesn’t react, which annoys Sherlock even more. “Mummy and Father are also somewhat perplexed as to why you would take such an obvious step back on your career path. But then again, they don’t know about John Watson.”
The cold air hits him like a welcome slap in the face. It’s good to be moving, good to be outside, where no empty spaces mock Sherlock with a well-defined absence.
John snorts a humorless laugh. “Yep. Definitely. I’m sure I would have found it incredibly sweet if you hadn’t broken up with me 12 hours earlier.” He looks at Sherlock, and there’s something in his eyes, something sharp and discerning. “Begs the question, though, why you baked it in the first place.”
John takes another step closer and looks over Holmes’ shoulder. “Why are you dissecting this rabbit?”
And yet, the easy confidence with which he stretched out his filo and the quality of his custard tell a completely different story.
He closes his eyes and tries to identify the feeling of tight longing behind his breastbone. Finally, he can put words to it. “You go where you want. I’m going home.”
Sherlock has nothing whatsoever to say to that, but he’s grateful for John’s honesty, and his unthinking generosity of sharing this with Sherlock, who, in the grand scheme of things, has done nothing to deserve it.
John rubs a tired hand over his face and looks at Sherlock, still so very calm. “What do you want from me, Sherlock? It’s been five years.”
“All right,” he says, “let’s go back to the city and get to work. There has to be a way to get that Gate to open.”
He mentions Sherlock by name twice, but he only implies that the baker he thinks is inferior is John.
But John clings to 221B. And he clings to Sherlock. And Sherlock has often asked himself whether John has just replaced his cane with Sherlock as something to cling to, or if the reason John stays is an entirely different one. Maybe John needs Sherlock. But maybe he wants him, too. Maybe he is the bereft widower who uses 221B as a safe haven before he goes out on his own again. And maybe he’s here because he genuinely wants to be here and nowhere else. The fact that Sherlock still can’t answer that question with any certainty after nine years is disturbing, especially for the world’s only consulting detective.
He nods at his brother in greeting and makes himself comfortable as the car enters early evening traffic.
When John gets to the rehearsal room, Sherlock is already there. He’s an early riser, or rather, John remembers, a non-sleeper, and he loves being the first in the room.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything, he’s not even looking at Donovan and Lestrade, he’s staring at John with cool, calculating scrutiny. “Did he break your ribs?” he asks, and there’s a cold wrath in his tone that sends a not unpleasant shiver down John’s spine.
A complete and utter overreaction, of course. Granted, Sherlock did omit to pay the rent a few months in a row, but if catching dangerous criminals isn’t a good reason for losing track of something as mundane as rent, then Sherlock doesn’t know what is. Granted, there was also a chemical incident, and granted his insurance didn’t cover fire damage, but it was an once in a lifetime occurrence because Sherlock will never, ever leave the Bunsen burner on when he leaves the house again.
They got out, of course. Sherlock shot at the bomb, and John pushed them into the pool like Sherlock knew he would, and then John dragged him out and saved his life (again) and got him to the hospital.
“Why do you care?” Sherlock asks. “It’s my head, it’s my shoulder, it’s my blood and my shirt. Caring, John, isn't an advantage!”
Sherlock sways a little and John supports him so he’s leaning against John. He’s obviously still dizzy and John wouldn’t be surprised if Sherlock had no idea what John just said.
“I’m not here to argue with you about the validity of my choice of occupation,” Sherlock says and pulls out the ticket for the Bake Off final. “I’m here to offer you a front row seat.”
It’s a lovely night. The moon is out, and the stars are an awe-inspiring spectacle, especially for Londoners who aren’t used to seeing the Milky Way stretch over the sky.
John sighs and rubs a hand over his face, looking down at his water glass as if it held any answers. The truth is, he’s never liked the house very much. It’s far away - which he realises now was sort of the point of it, Mary wanted to wean him from 221B by making it thoroughly inconvenient to reach - it’s too big for two people, too expensive, too much for a single dad to clean and keep up.
Sherlock cuts and posts the video, together with an announcement video that he’s going to be on The Great British Bake Off, which starts airing on Monday evening.
The thing is, John has always been more curious than is entirely good for him, so instead of just backing away and going back to bed, he takes a step forward, and asks, “What are you doing?”
Sherlock curses himself for being an unobservant idiot, because he didn’t notice John didn’t have his cane last night, and he didn’t notice it now. He puts down his tea. “I’ll help.”
“That’s the worst part of the story. The fucking sheep had to have a dressing room to itself, and we had to share.”
Sherlock waves a dismissive hand. “That was a mistake. Apologies,” he says coolly, his entire body one rigid line of tension that wasn’t there a moment ago.
There’s an agonised sound from Neela, and Mrs Hudson and Mrs Turner go over to her. Apparently, her dough is too runny, and she made the mistake of adding more flour, which just made it lumpy.
Sherlock has looked up from his book and is watching John with a carefully neutral expression. “Why do you think you have to tell me this?” Sherlock asks, tone also carefully neutral, like he’s academically interested and no more.
Sherlock shrugs off the praise, but John knows him well enough by now to realise that he’s actually pleased. “It wasn’t that difficult, Mrs Hudson.”
“You were being a pain,” John shoots back, but he seems to have trouble to keep from smiling as well. “Anyway,” he says, clearly shaking himself out of the memory, “fortunately, my phone has a chess app.”
The driver turns around and says something to them, in what Sherlock is reasonably sure is Pashto, and Sherlock asks himself for the millionth time why he didn’t bring John along for this. Reasonably, logically, pragmatically, he should have. But if he’s entirely honest with himself, he wasn’t sure he was going to pull this off and he wasn’t about to risk John’s life for somebody John doesn’t especially care for. And if he’s even more honest with himself, he didn’t because he hates the way John looked at Irene, the resigned sadness of it.
“Thank you,” John says, a pleased sparkle in his eyes and a light flush on his cheeks. Sherlock tries not to find him adorable, and fails.
So far, the Bake Off social media accounts have also ignored Moriarty and his trolls, and Sherlock doesn’t think that will change any time soon. But the controversy has driven up social media engagement for all involved, and so Sherlock thinks the BBC probably loves the drama. Sherlock can only imagine how absolutely livid Moriarty must be at being ignored, and it fills him with satisfaction, in the brief moments he can bring himself to care.
“You’re going back to London. Tonight,” Sherlock says as he presses the gauze against the wound and fixes it there with two plasters.
John looks at him sideways and smiles. “Good luck with your bake, Sherlock,” he says gently and moves back to his workstation.
Truth be told, John is sitting here because he has no idea what else to do. He can’t go home. He can’t possibly face Mary. He has no idea what will happen if he puts one foot in front of the other and walks out of this hospital. So what’s keeping him here is mostly inertia, with a side of despair.
“Terminal case of arsehole career suicide,” Mrs Hudson answers. “Jim Moriarty dropped out of my production yesterday evening. Press night is next Saturday.”
He steps out into the cool night air, letting the brisk November night slap him awake after the drowsy warmth of the hospital.
“I shocked your brain out of a panic attack,” Sherlock says, quietly, still very close. He’s looking at John, wary, cautious, nervous. Waiting for John to react.
Sherlock’s eyes slip closed, and when he speaks again, John can barely hear him. “The pool. Moriarty. Only this time I shot at the bomb and we ran, and ran, and ran.”
Mr Chatterjee is locking the door behind him, then turns and looks around with a nostalgic sadness on his face that Sherlock can empathise with.
“Legal. Forgive me, but you wouldn't be my first choice for baking advice.” Sherlock pauses. “No offence.”
“Mummy was hurt. A bad person hurt her, and she died,” Sherlock explains, or tries to, as gently as possible. Normally he hates talking down to Rosie or giving her anything but the unvarnished truth, but ‘Your mother was an assassin and got murdered by the woman who double crossed her’ isn’t something he can say to a three-year-old.
They wait in silence, and there’s an uncomfortable edge to it that Sherlock can’t help but be aware of. It’s something he isn’t used to, because he and John were always able to talk together or be quiet together without any discomfort whatsoever. But as he refuses to engage in small talk just for the sake of something to say, he keeps his mouth shut.
Ironically, the thought that he needs to be there for Sherlock now is somewhat comforting. It’s something he knows he can do. Making sure Sherlock Holmes lives is John’s default setting, after all.
The man who “invited” John here steps out of the shadows. Jim gestures between them. “You’ve met Moran, right?”
Lestrade claps his hands. “So, people. We’ve got ten rehearsal days. At least four of these days we’ll spend in tech. So let’s get started.”
Sherlock wakes up, face down on the kitchen table where he fell asleep over his latest experiment, meaningless but a way to keep himself busy during the endlessly empty days in his empty flat and his empty life.
Nothing further to add this week, I’m afraid. Next week will get more interesting again with the baking, I promise, with the recipe for John’s winning Topfenstrudel, among other things.
He breaks into John’s tiny house to wait for him to come home from the surgery. He makes tea and searches the house top to bottom for any clue what John is doing here.
“We’ll have to agree to disagree about that one,” John muses and sits down to eat another mini-quiche.
Sherlock drinks. His hands aren’t entirely steady. His eyes are pinched, like he’s in pain, which he probably is, given he’s got a bloody god-damned concussion.
“First challenge: Eight-strand plaited loaves are difficult to do, and our bakers will need all their concentration for this one.”
John appears by his side and hands him coffee and a scone. He hands over his key to the receptionist and nods at Sherlock. “Ready?”
When John Watson is twelve years old, he stumbles into another world. He also meets Sherlock Holmes.
He smiles back. “I know. Dr. Sholto, Molly, Mrs Hudson, they’ve all been more than kind to us. They've done everything to make us feel at home.”
After, after the fire and the bomb and the danger, after John saved his life the second time and Sherlock discovered that he couldn’t quite look away from John’s eyes during that interminable ambulance ride when John sat next to him and held his hand like Sherlock would vanish if he let go, after that moment of perfect clarity when he looked at John and felt the connection between them almost physically, when he could see through John entirely and John could see inside his head as clearly… after all that, he feels the shift as clearly as if the earth had moved under their feet.
It’s surprising, that last thought. It shows him how much his self-perception has shifted over the last year. He was always proud of being a brain with a transport attached. It occurred to him only recently that being seen as a whole person with heart and a soul as well as a mind is occasionally not entirely unpleasant.
Moriarty smiles at Sherlock, smarmy, insinuating, knowing, so knowing, knowing exactly where to hit to do the most damage, and Sherlock has never hated anyone the way he hates Jim right now. “He won’t run,” Jim says, voice dripping disdain. “He’ll never run. It’s his weakness. He
John darts forward and Sherlock tumbles right into him. John grabs his arms and holds him steady, and for a moment, they stay like this, John holding on to Sherlock’s arms, Sherlock clutching the plate with his scones and the jam in a death grip. John’s hands are strong and steady. He smells good, of sugar and sweat and a hint of his aftershave. There must be a word, he thinks, for the exact shade of blue of John Watson’s eyes. He’s got surprisingly fine lashes. There’s flour on his nose, and a bit of Sherlock’s strawberry jam has gotten on his shirt.
Sherlock arrived late for breakfast and is in a rotten mood, so John leaves him alone to get himself out of it.
Sherlock ignores her and takes his dough off the heat. He slowly and methodically adds the eggs, stirs them in with practiced ease. He turns off the stove and lets the dough sit to cool.
“He’s here, isn’t he?” Mycroft says softly, and Sherlock shrugs, trying for nonchalant, unwilling to admit that his brother’s tacit encouragement does make him feel better. If only a little.
Half an hour into the evening he's so tired he can barely follow the conversation, and is actually about to leave when somebody taps him on the shoulder.
Sherlock pulls him down again and resumes carding his hands through John’s hair. “There are no addicts in my family,” he muses quietly, glad that John isn’t looking at him anymore.
, John,” Sherlock bites out. “I’ve got two months to come up with a hundred thousand pounds, otherwise this place will be
There’s an odd buzzing sound, and John wonders what Sherlock’s up to now. He was oddly restless all evening after John came home from work, pacing the length of the sitting room like a caged animal. Then he got a text and disappeared, and didn’t come home until John was in bed.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock finally gets out around the lump in his throat, and it’s the truest thing he’s said all night.
For a moment, John is back on the pavement at Barts’, looking up to the roof, watching Sherlock do something unforgivable out of fear and desperation.
“That’s sort of his job, he is your agent after all,” John says, leaning over to read the email. His entire body goes still, and Sherlock tenses up for the inevitable explosion.
Here and now Sherlock is hot and uncomfortable but John's lips are against his skin and Sherlock is content.
John examines this thought from all sides and decides it makes sense. And then he decides that the answer actually doesn’t matter so much, because Sherlock is his best friend and nothing will ever change that.
Sherlock flinches and turns to see John standing next to him, leaning against the bar, looking from him to the glass of whisky with an expression that’s caught somewhere between amused and worried.
For a moment, he hesitates. He feels oddly like he’s walking in on Sherlock doing something that he has no right to see, that is none of John’s business.
“What exactly are you looking for, here?” Janine finally asks, frowning at the pie. “I can’t taste anything wrong with it at all.”
“See, this is where I can tell you’re just a stupid, arrogant little posh boy. I’m still alive because I know how to keep my mouth shut.” He grins again, a highly unpleasant sight. “Doesn’t mean we can’t have a little fun, though.”
John laughs quietly, and some of the sadness leaves him. “No, I’ll just tell a soppy story about my gran. People love soppy gran stories.”
“You need to really slather them with melted butter before they bake,” John says, turning back to Sherlock, biting down on a huge yawn.
And the thing is, he knows he should just get into his car and drive, but he can’t just let John sit there, waiting for a bus that might run twice a week.
“Oh, high praise from the master,” John teases, but Sherlock can hear the warmth of his smile in his voice.
Mary smiles sadly. “Maybe that’s true. Maybe you’re just so used to lying to yourself that you can’t even see the truth anymore.” She pauses and takes a sip of her tea, then grimaces again and pushes it away. “I wonder, did you ever really see me, as I really am, or just the way you wanted me to be in your loneliness and grief? And the second I stopped playing into your fantasy of who I was, you lost all interest in me. ”
The killer takes two steps away from John, and John quickly gets to his feet, wincing when he straightens, holding a hand to his ribs. That’s a nasty bruise at least, if he’s lucky.
“Yes, yes, definitely,” John says, forcing a smile through the awkward mess of his emotions. He steps aside to let Sherlock pass.
“What do you mean by more?” Mary asks, leaning in. Sherlock figures that John must have an excellent view of her cleavage from where he’s sitting. To his credit, he ignores it and answers her question.
They drive to Kiev from Rome. It takes them two days. They spend the night in a trailer park in Hungary. It’s practically deserted - it’s a rainy Wednesday in April - and the trailer creaks with every move they make.
Sherlock remains, alone, quietly elated. It shouldn’t fill him with a secret joy that John is bothered by Irene’s blatant flirting, but it does, because it means that maybe, just maybe, John has not, in fact, moved on as successfully as he claims. And if that is in fact the case, maybe, just maybe, he can actually get John back. He’s very good at getting John Watson into bed, after all, at least he used to be.
"We threaten to sue him. You're a grown man, and you've been sober for six years. Your brother's financial control over your life is ridiculous."
Apparently, Janine picks up on his uncertainty, because her tone shifts from briskly businesslike to warmer. “Look. Whatever is going on between you, I know one thing for sure. You’re by far his favourite person in that tent.”
Slowly but surely the buzzing in his ears fades and his heartbeat calms down and he’s able to focus on the conversation around the table, which, to put it mildly, is inane to the point of meaninglessness. Irene and Molly are regaling the table with anecdotes about their cats, which everyone at the table seems to find hilarious, for reasons completely beyond him.
John’s sitting on the sofa, reading a novel. Sherlock has been staring at him for about fifteen minutes.
“That’s because you’re an idiot,” Sherlock answers and moves in for another kiss. Then he draws back and takes John’s hand. “Now come help me pick out Christmas presents for my horrid parents.”
“I don’t think they wanted you two dead, but they were certainly prepared to take that risk,” Lestrade answers thoughtfully.
The ticking of the wall clock is surprisingly loud in the stony silence. He looks at Mary sitting there, blonde hair in a messy bun, and thinks that she looks tired, and sad, and defeated, and like a complete stranger. It’s oddly dissociative, like becoming aware of one’s own heartbeat, or feeling oneself fall asleep, the way one realises that it’s impossible to ever really know anyone, that of the thousands of thoughts passing through a person’s head, one will ever only really know a very small increment.
Mrs Turner grins into the camera. “Oh, I like that. I need to be careful not to get drunk on power.”
“Why would I?” the man says, moving to the work station next to Sherlock’s. “You took the trouble to get here first, you did reconnaissance and took advantage of the fact that the rest of us are lazy sods who slept in and had a cuppa before showing up here. So if anything, I commend your work ethic.”
And Sherlock finds this oddly satisfying. So far John has been perfectly professional, wearing his undemanding, quietly authoritative DSM persona. It’s indescribably odd, because Sherlock used to be able to coax a reaction out of John by just looking at him out of the corner of his eye. It’s odd remembering how he used to be able to catch John’s undivided attention by biting his lips, or giving him a fleeting smile, or taking a suggestion John would make privately into the rehearsal room.
Also, he can’t remember the last time anyone’s touched him for more than a few seconds at the time, and all this contact, this warm body-skin-hair-breath so close to his own, all so freely given, so unconsciously generous, well, it sends a quiet shiver of pleasure down Sherlock’s spine.
Sherlock is looking at him oddly, but John doesn’t have time to parse this right now. “Listen, I need to get to the theatre and fix that bloody light. I’ll call Janine, and then we can go.”
“Apricot jam, sugar and lemon juice,” John answers with a pleased smile. “Bit of a trick I picked up from my gran.”
He’s also currently leaning heavily against John, who is trying, rather ineptly in Sherlock’s humble opinion, to get him up the stairs to their front door.
Sherlock shrugs and tries valiantly not to blush. “Nothing. Irene likes to think she’s very clever.”
It’s not a feeling he’s especially used to. His normal restless energy seems to have expended itself last night, leaving an odd sort of stillness in its wake.
Sherlock concedes all of the above with a slight grimace. “I’ve been clean for some time now, brother mine. And it’s not like I started this yesterday. I’ve been rather successful so far.”
John moves even closer, and ever so carefully entwines their fingers. Sherlock’s heartbeat picks up, and his breath catches. “I’m glad you’re back,” John says, carefully not looking at Sherlock. “I’ve missed you.”
He stops at a page with a poppy seed cake that’s titled John’s Birthday Cake. There’s a drawing on the page. A birthday cake with six candles. Yellow crayon, very rough. Next to the drawing, a faded thumbprint. Child-sized.
The crew is still setting up in the main tent, rigging lights and cameras and lugging around various equipment. The makeup/wardrobe/catering/green room tent is sitting a few metres away. Sherlock passes it by, ignoring the scents of bad coffee and cigarette smoke.
John’s silent for a moment, and the amusement between them fades a bit. “And then what?” John asks quietly, because he knows what he wants, but he realises that he can’t assume that Sherlock is fine with him moving back in with a two-year-old because they’ve been crashing here uninvited.
Then he goes back into his workshop and makes another batch of filo pastry. The challenge this week is called “Roll Me Up”. The technical challenge is a classic strawberry whipped cream roulade, and Sherlock has already done a video about how not to roll roulades, which he’s going to post after the episode airs.
He looks back at John, peacefully asleep and so temptingly warm. He turns in his sleep, and Sherlock can see the bumps of his spine as he curls up on his side, and he wants to trace them with lazy fingers, then press his entire body against John’s and fall asleep like this.
“Well, we couldn’t really keep it, so we argued back and forth whether to just give it to this one actor who had snakes.”
Finally, Sherlock lifts his gaze, clearly exhausted, half-starved, nauseated and irritated beyond belief. “I didn’t answer you before because it should be bloody buggering obvious where I was, to use some of your more colourful vernacular.”
Sherlock grins at John gleefully. “She was murdered, John. An honest to god murder! And we don't know how yet!”
The actors all clear out, and Sherlock lingers, watching John and Molly who clear the stage with practiced ease, joined by Mike, and Dave from lights. Tomorrow morning, they’ll start dismantling the set, and tomorrow afternoon nothing will remain except the raw bones of the theatre.
He’s done this a million times. This isn’t even his fiftieth air raid. He knows the likelihood of them being hit is low, the planes are probably heading for Exeter, but right now, all he can see is fire, and all he can hear are the screams of people dying.
“Traffic accident. Six months ago. He was…” Mycroft hesitates, and Sherlock has never seen his brother look this affected, this uncomfortable, and that alone tells him that all his hollowness must show on his face. “He was hit by a lorry and killed instantly. There was no foul play, it was just an accident.”
Sherlock adds a few sage leaves to the pan, enjoying the way the sage aromatises the entire kitchen. “Yes.” He hesitates. He never told anyone about this, except Mycroft. “I was actually thinking of opening a bakery.”
Emma laughs. “No. Worth a try, though. So, two last questions, then we should have enough material. First, who’s going to win, and who’s going to be in the final three?”
“Definitely.” John pauses, but he feels the need to make sure Sarah understands. “Seriously, though, it was so hard when we first came here. We only had each other. Still do, really.”
He reaches into his coat pocket and fishes out a tiny sprig of mistletoe. Then he holds it over John’s head.
“I’ve got two more,” John says and rolls on top of Sherlock to kiss him. “First, I love you. Second, you’ll be absolutely bloody fantastic.”
John thinks but doesn’t ask, too afraid of the answer. Is he threat, reward, or collateral? Is he on the list of things Sherlock wants?
The Black Forest Gateau is first, and it’s a catastrophe. If Sherlock were so inclined, he would have material for ten videos about what went wrong in this bake, which was everything.
He dismisses the question with a wave of his hand and scans the recipe, drawing a few obvious conclusions.
When Sherlock picked John up this morning around six, he didn’t look like he’d slept at all. He fell asleep in the car and slept all the way through to Bath.
“Be that as it may,” Lestrade says, “It doesn’t really matter how you got here, what matters is what we’ll do with you. But I think I have an idea. Follow me.”
John's stomach twists at the thought of what Sherlock is walking into. He hopes against hope that Moriarty is wrong and Sherlock just won't show up, but he knows Moriarty is right. He provided the two things Sherlock can't resist, a puzzle and a way home. Now it only remains to be seen what his role in this farce is. Whatever it is, he doesn't look forward to finding out.
John licks his lips. Sherlock’s eyes follow the movement, then snap back to John’s. “”You know,” John mutters, leaning closer to Sherlock. “We’ve got thirty-five minutes more of this.”
The car stops at a red light, and Sherlock gets out and walks away, because he is one hundred percent certain he doesn’t want to hear whatever Mycroft has to say, and he isn’t sure he’d be able to hear it through the ringing in his ears and the crunching sound of his heart breaking.
It’s only when he rounds the corner and sees Speedy’s Sandwich Bar that he realises his feet have carried him towards Baker Street Theatre without his conscious direction. He was thinking about John, and apparently his subconscious has directed him to the place he most closely associates with him.
There’s a polaroid tucked into the last written on page, with all the bakers grinning into the camera, holding up their cakes.
He opens the door to Speedy’s, and the familiar dinging of the bell over the door echoes through the empty room.
The thing is, Sherlock is pretty sure he could get John into bed with him tonight. John has always been bad at resisting Sherlock, and he’s giving out a lot of unconscious ‘seduce me’ signals that somebody who doesn’t know him as well as Sherlock does wouldn’t pick up on. So he knows if he plays this right, he could just take John home and ravish him, and a big part of him wants to do just that and fuck the consequences. But the longer they sit here, the more he realises he doesn’t want John like this. He wants John entirely, or not at all. He doesn’t want a frantic tumble and a shy goodbye, he wants a wild, passionate night and a slow, lazy morning, where John stays for breakfast, and lunch, and dinner, and doesn’t check his watch and mutters excuses and slinks out, and he doesn’t want the drama of being the person John cheated with, the other, the one who gets left.
In an instant, Billy is out of his chair. “You lying sod! I never took nothing off nobody, and I dare you to prove it!”
John gazes at Sherlock’s hand and his own, slowly letting this new idea sink in. “All right,” he finally says. “I think I understand. But how does this help us?”
The killer curses and drops the gun, then rounds on John and attacks. John dodges and tries to get another hit in with the fire iron, but the killer ducks and punches John straight in the face, then follows it up with a knee to the stomach, and John drops the fire iron and goes down like a sack of bricks. He’s got enough sense left to roll into a protective ball and get his arms up to protect his head before the first kick hits him in the stomach. He takes the second and third in the ribs.
Sherlock snorts. “Billy will stay loyal to whomever pays him more. But at least Billy might give us a chance to outbid Jim.”
“Yes. It was…you are….” Sherlock trails off because he has no idea how to finish that sentence. John Watson is a whole lot of things he doesn’t even want to begin to articulate, funny, for one, handsome, good company, a competent baker, a brilliant shag. However. “Look. I don’t believe in tiptoeing around things, so here’s the blunt truth. We had sex. It was good. But I don’t usually have sex with strangers and I don’t intend to make a habit of it.”
“You want coffee instead?” Sherlock asks quietly. He’s sitting next to John, looking deeply uncomfortable. But he’s here. And John appreciates it enormously.
Sherlock picks his workstation with the usual care, and then he hesitates. John isn’t here yet. He could just let the other contestants pick their workstations and let chance decide whether the workstation next to him will be free for John.
Sherlock leans over and whispers in John’s ear, “And once this is over, I’ll take you home and reward you creatively. So start thinking about what you want.”
, has cracked. And somehow John has spilled out, and he’s been keeping Sherlock company in the dark.
After that, the crew film him baking scones, and manage to linger until they’re done, and Sherlock sends them off with a scone each and a sigh of relief.
Occasionally, he’ll check the monitors or the charts, but it’s perfunctory; he knows what’s wrong with Sherlock, after all. What’s wrong with Sherlock is that John’s wife shot him through the chest.
John looks tired and sad. “I know we said that this was just a bit of fun. But we get on like a house on fire. I’ve been having the best time with you, and not just the sex. Just waking up with you, or arguing with you over YouTube, or baking next to you while neither of us talks for three hours. Being woken up at two in the morning from you playing the violin. All of it, it’s been so much fun, and I haven’t felt alive like this in such a long time. And I don’t want it to end. No matter if I’m going home tomorrow, I want to see you on Monday, and as many Mondays as you’ll let me have.”
John steps back for a moment, and Sherlock has no time to wonder what John is doing because he drops to his knees right there on the grass, hands working quickly to free Sherlock’s straining cock from his trousers. The cold air hits him and he shivers for a moment, but then John swallows his cock down to the root with no warning, and Sherlock makes a noise like he’s dying, because he thinks he might be, and oh what a lovely way to go.
Sherlock watches the foam slowly collapse as Janine stirs it into the coffee. His own coffee sits there, untouched, and both he and Janine waved away any offer of baked goods. They're sitting at a Costa's in central London, surrounded by tourists and university students. The air is filled with a dozen languages and a few arguments about whose turn it is to do the assignment this week.
“Well, let’s see,” Sherlock says, looking up from his book. “As far as I know, some of that lot over there,” he gestures at Mike and his table, “spend their days either running after a ball, hitting a ball with a stick or throwing a ball while slamming into each other. Then there’s the library, which is extensive but understocked on scientific works. Fortunately, my brother always sends me the latest.” He holds up the book he’s been reading, which seems to be a collection of sorts about something called quantum mechanics. “I plan to spend my morning reading it.”
“Sally. She’s had to do it before, when Mary had pneumonia last year. It’ll be fine,” Molly says, reassuring him automatically.
He’s scribbling out complex formulae on the walls with thick permanent marker. He writes over the papers tacked to the walls, the cold cases, crime scene pictures, newspaper articles, pages of chemistry textbooks, all firing his synapses with tiny sparks of input, setting off a reaction of deductions and inferences and information. It’s glorious.
Sherlock nods and tries not to notice that John smells good. He apparently showered not long ago, his hair is still a bit damp and slightly mussed, and he’s changed into a soft, beige jumper that’s too baggy on him and frankly an abomination altogether.
The worst part is of course that everything Sherlock just said is completely true. That doesn't mean it doesn't hurt to hear, especially from the one person who's always, always been on John's side before.
John shakes his head fondly at Sherlock's barely contained excitement. “Just try not to grin too obviously when the Watch comes in, all right? When's the autopsy?”
Sherlock returns the key to his hotel room before he heads to the tent, wondering if anyone will notice that he didn’t set one foot in his room. He spent the night in John’s bed, again. He slept well and late, again. There was ridiculously good morning sex in the shower, and Sherlock feels a bit unsettled by all of it. He enjoyed all of it. The sex, the eating cold antipasti with their fingers while reading stupid internet comments, the sleeping in John’s bed, the showering together.
“Then take this the way it’s meant. You’re really bad at asking for what you want. You’ve wanted to be stage manager for two years now, and Mike’s promised you every year he’d retire, and he never has, and you never push him. You don’t go to Mrs Hudson and tell her to make you stage manager, because you assume she’ll pick Mike over you. You always assume people won’t be on your side, won’t pick you, won’t want to be with you.”
At least he’s done with his chores for today. He’s fed the chickens, brought in firewood and swept the classrooms, all is ready for tomorrow’s school day. It helps Mrs Hudson and earns them a few coppers pocket money. He had his tea in the kitchen with Mrs Hudson like every evening, and he’s tried to get Sherlock to eat something, unsuccessfully.
John shakes his head and grabs his arm. “Christ, Sherlock, you’re shaking. You’ll catch your death. Go home. I’ll talk to you later, all right? Just go home and get warm.”
Sherlock’s sitting at a small table, palms pressed to the surface of the wooden tabletop. The killer’s sitting on the other side. He’s tall and almost too lean, hard muscles standing out against his reed-thin form, attesting to a wiry strength. He’s wearing very modern British looking work boots and, incongruously, Fey’a-style leggings and long tunics. He’s also got a nasty smile and a gun trained at Sherlock.
“If you mean that in a ‘Will reality collapse into a black hole of nothingness if I don’t do this now’ way, no. If you mean it in a ‘Is this something that needs to get done as soon as possible’ way, then yes.”
The first time John verbally eviscerated Sherlock for the contents of their fridge - “Toes, Sherlock, seriously! Toes! Just lying there, between the carrots! I nearly bit into one, for fuck’s sake!” - Sherlock was hard pressed not to cry with the sheer, utter, beautiful happiness of a piece of his life he thought he’d lost forever snapping back into place.
The housekeeper puts a mug of tea in front of him and ruffles a hand over his hair. “Poor dear, must be difficult, being away from home for the first time. Go get dressed now, then you can have breakfast.”
Sherlock bites at John’s hand, and John’s eyes go dark. Sherlock smirks against his palm. Good to know.
They’re kissing like the world is ending and greedy hands pull on clothing to get to skin. Sherlock shivers when John’s cold hands ruck up his shirt to dip under it, and it’s only partly from the cold.
There was a series of realisations, after that, one worse than the other. That horrible homecoming, when he recognised just how badly he’d broken their ... - whatever it was they’d had. John’s wedding, making John’s absence from Baker Street final. Getting shot, any chance of a new equilibrium, gone. John suddenly there again, changing his bandages, helping him shower and dress and sometimes just being the one thing in the world he could hold on to when he was shaking himself apart from morphine withdrawal, knowing all the while that John would leave again.
Sherlock swallows, and he can’t look at Victor, can’t say it without his throat closing up. “I left you there,” he finally gets out.
John nods, abashed, and Mary pulls him in for a hug. “Now go find a corner to sleep in, you enormous idiot, or I’ll knock you unconscious with a moving light.”
Sherlock all but flees then, and goes back to Baker Street, and it’s so quiet, so empty, how did he never notice how empty he is, how is he supposed to take this, how is he supposed to live like this, alone, alone, alone...
“No, I’m fine,” Sherlock says, and it’s difficult not to reach out and touch John, rest a reassuring hand on his arm or his shoulder, and he realises how used he is to touching John by now.
He finds nothing. If he didn’t know for certain John Watson lives here, he could never tell from the contents of the house. Yes, his teas are sorted in a certain way, and he always used to put the milk carton into the fridge at a certain angle, but other than that, the house is a blank. No pictures, no knick-knacks, no mementos. No gun. No dog-tags. He doesn’t recognise a single piece of clothing.
Sherlock flags down a taxi and they get in. Mrs Hudson gives the cabbie their address, and Sherlock settles into the seat, looking out at the drowsing city - London never really sleeps - with a feeling of relief that one only gets from surviving something awful and coming out on the other side surprised that life continues.
“I’ll do nothing of the sort, thanks a bunch,” the killer says, still grinning. “You’re not going to shoot me, and even if you did, I doubt you could hit a cow if it stood still right in front of you, never mind a moving target in the dark.”
“You realise that asking me whether you can ask me something is somewhat redundant, right?” He tries for condescending. He’s not sure he succeeds.
They rush down the stairs, Sherlock pulling John along, down into the wine cellar, where the boys, staff and Mr. Musgrave are already sitting on long benches. The cook is handing out blankets and biscuits.
Sherlock puts down the phone and wonders why John isn’t sleeping, whether he’s had a nightmare, whether he’s antsy and lonely like Sherlock, whether he’s also baking.
He can feel Sherlock shrug against him. “My little sister died when she was five. It almost broke my parents. Especially my mother. Since then my father always told us not to care about anyone but family. You can't help caring for family. But anyone else...” Sherlock swallows audibly. “Caring makes you weak. Caring
John looks at him like he’s lost his mind. “I need to get dressed. I need to be at the theatre in two hours, I’m calling the show tonight.”
Once he’s out of the warehouse, he sags against the outer wall of the building, loss of adrenaline making his legs tremble.
“Is he in costume?” Adriana whispers back, confused by Sherlock’s sharp dress pants and crisp shirt, a marked contrast to the jeans and ratty t-shirts the rest of the cast are wearing for rehearsals. John bites back a smile. For Sherlock, no suit jacket and the rolled-up sleeves of his designer shirt are casual wear.
The hair starts rising on the back of John’s neck and his arms, and the almost-humming gets more intense, to the point where it almost hurts his ears.
John looks away from Greg’s compassionate gaze. “It was a long time ago,” he says, but he knows his voice lacks conviction. Truth be told, he doesn’t even really know whether he’s dreading seeing Sherlock again or whether he’s wildly curious, it’s all a jumbled mess of disquiet in his stomach. But then again, that’s just the way Sherlock used to make him feel back in the day, arse over ears and butterflies.
Silence falls, and John hates how loud his breathing is in his own ears. His throat is tight, and his eyes are stinging.
“What are the measurements for a large tin, and how much flour is more flour?” Sherlock asks. “Be precise, John. For once in your life, be precise.”
“Turn left” and “Straight on” are the only words spoken between them, but Sherlock feels that they’ve reached a point where words just don’t matter anymore, and they’ve said everything they wanted to say to each other.
Before John moved in, Sherlock also figured out that the advantages of living with a doctor would outweigh the disadvantages. In the equation of excellent emergency care versus a possibly annoying habit of inquiring somewhat too closely into his substance use, the former won simply because Sherlock has discovered that people can never tell whether he’s high or just unusually stimulated by a problem.
Molly sticks a candle into the cake, and they all sing the obligatory birthday song, most of them falsely. John blows out the candle, everybody claps. Then John cuts into the cake and goes quiet.
John tells the guardsman their story, how they’re billeted at Musgrave Manor and came upon the stone circle, then got lost and were guided towards the city by two fairy creatures.
“The poppy seed-sugar-butter mix is spectacular, and I love the fruitiness of the rhubarb-strawberry,” Donovan adds, taking another bite.
John huffs and turns to the wall, wrapping his blankets about himself angrily. Bloody Sherlock Holmes and his bloody god-damned logic…
“But you did,” John says, quietly, and Sherlock starts a bit, because he’d almost forgotten that John is still there, still sitting nearly in his lap, still holding his hand. “You walked away even though you cared. And you don’t need me to tell you that it was the right thing to do because you already know that.”
Sherlock finds John’s hand with his, laces their fingers together. “I’ll take you out for one when we get home.”
He endures three interviews, then excuses himself because he needs to get ready for the performance. Feeling oddly unsure whether or not he imagined the events of this afternoon, he makes his way backstage. He literally bumps into John, who’s on his way to the foyer. He doesn’t stop, but says, “Can’t talk, fire inspector.” But he gives Sherlock a brilliant smile, and Sherlock feels better immediately.
The judging is so boring that Sherlock has a hard time stopping himself from fidgeting, and in the end it’s a three-way tie between Sherlock, Irene and Jim, with John and Molly close behind.
Mrs Hudson and Mrs Turner are wandering between the contestants with the steadycam in tow and are watching the contestants struggling - or not - with their dough. They’re at John’s workstation right now, watching him as he stretches his dough out with his competent surgeon's hands, which Sherlock is very much not imagining all over his body again, thank you very much.
John huffs a laugh and shakes his head. "No idea what that bloody means," he mutters and grabs his duffle bag. "So, axe murderer I've just met, where's your white van stocked with candy?"
For a moment, they’re all frozen, a perfect tableaux, John and Sarah, still holding hands, and Sherlock, staring at their entwined fingers with an unreadable expression. It’s a look that makes John deeply uncomfortable, and he resists the urge to pull his hand out of Sarah’s. After all, he’s not doing anything he shouldn’t. Sarah is the closest thing he has to a girlfriend, and Sherlock is his best friend.
John takes the phone and looks at it for a long moment. Then he lets out a long sigh and lowers it slightly to look at Sherlock. “I’ve never missed a show before.”
“It was worth it,” Sherlock says with utter conviction, and once again swallows what he wants to say, which is
Sherlock listens to Rosie’s breaths even out, and when he’s sure she’s asleep, he goes into the bathroom for paracetamol, a glass of water, and the thermometer.
Sherlock wants to hit him. Right in the middle of his stupid, smug face. He’s never experienced quite such an urge to punch someone before. He imagines it in glorious detail, fist connecting with Moriarty’s nose in a satisfying crunch, blood spraying. He catches John’s eyes again, and this time it’s John who’s shaking his head. A muscle in John’s jaw twitches and the grip on his teacup tightens. But he resolutely says nothing and looks down at his tea.
The cab pulls up at the A+E entrance of St. Bart’s, and Sherlock and John get out of the car. John starts to go in, but turns around when he realises Sherlock’s not following.
If he’s entirely honest, John has no idea why Sherlock likes having him around. That he does is obvious, he doesn’t just pull John with him on cases because he moves so fast that John is drawn along, caught in some kind of gravitational pull. Even though sometimes it seems that way.
They’re looking at each other for a moment, and then they both burst out laughing, and Sherlock feels something inside of him unspool as John reaches for him and kisses the laugh from his lips, and Sherlock wonders whether this is what being in love feels like, before John wipes all thought from him again.
“As delicious as this is, Sherlock, it will not magically open my checkbook. The difference between lending and giving depends entirely on my confidence that you will be able to return this money to me, and I’m afraid, given your history, I have none,” Mycroft says, delicately wiping the edges of his mouth with the silk napkin.
. The thought of not talking to him every day, not hearing his breathing at night from the other side of the room, not ever having the chance of finding out whether he wants Sherlock to kiss him again, it's nearly unbearable. And he's not sure that there's anything he can do to change that outcome. When Sherlock comes back, he'll probably apologise, and John will forgive him, but the certainty that Sherlock won't just discard him like a well-read book is gone, and John isn't sure he can easily regain it.
Sherlock dismisses the apology, entirely at ease again now that John is here. “Doesn’t matter. Let’s just get started.”
“I was too late to get into the underground station,” John says, suddenly, urgently needing to explain his panic, defend and justify himself. “You get used to it, down there, you know. Seems unreal. Sirens, bit of a rush, darkness. The adults trying to distract you. I even fell asleep more than once. But that time, we were too late, and my mum took me to a neighbours’ house who had a bomb shelter built in their backyard. It’s different, this far up. Everything was louder, and nearer.” He swallows. “Two bombs hit the street. We could feel the ground shake. There was screaming, and fires, and when we finally dared to crawl out of that shelter, everything we had in the world except the clothes on our back was gone.”
John visibly hesitates and lets out a long breath. “God, I don’t even know.” He pauses and Sherlock glances over at John, who’s frowning, and obviously deep in thought. “I guess… I don’t know, maybe, for her to acknowledge that she has a problem? And that it affects people other than her? I mean… the amount of shit she put her ex-wife through, it’s even worse than what she’s put me through. But it would be nice to hear that she’s aware that she fucked up, and that she’s aware that some of the shit she did was really not on at all.” John shrugs. “I don’t know if it would make a difference, in the long run. But it’d go a long way to make me feel that she’s serious about getting her shit together. Maybe she would fail again, but at least I’d believe that she’s honestly trying, and I guess I could forgive her a lot of the other stuff if I thought she was actually, really trying.”
John is self-aware enough to know exactly what’s wrong with him. And it isn’t that he misses the war. Mycroft Holmes, for all his brilliance, is full of shit on this one. Nobody misses wars. He doesn’t miss the killing, and the good people dying around him, he doesn’t miss giving screaming, dying men morphine to make them pass more easily. He’s not that fucked in the head.
John wakes up when Mary walks into the green room where he slept - again, he needs to stop doing that - and drops her wedding binder onto the coffee table with unnecessary force. “Fucking wedding and fucking flowers and fucking dresses and fucking place settings. I don’t fucking care where my fucking Aunt Louise sits, and I doubly don’t fucking care where Janine’s posh work friends sit, the fucking gits.”
Adriana’s leaning next to him, slightly green in the face. “Fucking hell, I have to do this every night for the next six weeks.”
“That’s one word for it.” He turns around and watches John as he gets up and takes out the containers of Chinese food he brought.
“Right,” Donovan agrees. “Violet Jones probably stumbled out of the Gate a few years ago, stole the files from the Watch because it interested her, and committed suicide because she felt guilty.”
“Did you know she didn’t live in that building? Nobody who lives there even knows her. Why would she break into the cellar of a building she didn’t live in to commit suicide?”
Music is so many things now. Music is Rosie singing the Peppa Pig theme song loudly and falsely as she traipses down the stairs at six in the morning.
“Sherlock, do you have a minute?” Emma the contestant wrangler asks as he’s finished clearing his workstation.
“Guys, time for the judging,” Emma the contestant wrangler calls from the tent entrance, and the three of them hastily put out their cigarettes and go back in.
Sherlock comes out of the dressing room, holding his phone charger, and they look at each other in silence.
Sherlock glances at the chess board on the phone. “You’ll be checkmate in three, you know that, right?”
John’s smile broadens, and it does something to Sherlock, makes his stomach flutter and his heart beat faster. “No, you’re not boring. Not even a little bit.”
Wordlessly, John falls into step with Sherlock and they walk into the cavernous warehouse. They sneak past the Watchman who’s supposed to be guarding the door and quietly make their way into the very back, where Lestrade and Donovan are bent over a still form on the floor, red hair fanned out like a halo around her head.
Sherlock is staring at him, silent and serious. Then he takes the two steps towards John and grips his shoulders. “Listen to me,” he says, low and intent. “Come back with me, and I’ll make sure you become a doctor. If I have to work nights, if I have to blackmail an entire Oxbridge examination panel, if I have to steal, beg, murder, I will get this for you. If you come back with me.”
The room is relatively quiet as the bakers are working. With a glance, Sherlock sees many mistakes. Mike’s overworking his scones, they won’t rise. Anderson is putting too much baking powder into his savoury muffins. Janine’s ganache won’t set, and she’s frustratedly trying to fix it, but Sherlock already knows that she’s going to have to do something else. Mary is making savoury scones, and she’s grating the cheese on top, which will just make the scones greasy and the cheese will brown before the scones are done. She should have just put it in the batter.
Afterwards, Sherlock crawls back up and they just lie there, limbs entwined, half-dressed, messed up and breathing hard. Sherlock shifts them so John’s head rests on his shoulder and he can card his fingers through his hair. The silence in his mind is blissfully absolute for once, and Sherlock can just breathe, and rest.
Mycroft takes the ticket, and Sherlock hides a smirk because he thinks this is the first time in his life that he actually managed to surprise Mycroft.
“Never saw the point of that, myself,” Sherlock muses and takes a sip of his tea. It’s perfect, just the way he likes it, and the comfort of it settles into Sherlock’s stomach and warms him from the inside in the cold kitchen. He leans against the counter and watches as John, dressed in Sherlock’s clothes from head to toe, boxers, t-shirt, dressing gown, wraps his hands around the mug and breathes in the steam of his tea as if he needs the visceral comfort of a hot beverage. “I never had anything much to say to therapists.”
John just looks at him, infinitely sad. He doesn’t say anything for a long time. Finally, he sighs and looks down, and says, quietly, “Do you know how long it took for me to get over you? When you… left, I fell apart completely. It took me years of therapy to realise that what I felt was only partly grief. A lot of it was withdrawal. I’m an adrenaline addict, and you basically are adrenaline. I let myself get dependent on you. And that will never, ever, happen to me again.” He looks up now, and there, finally, is the sliver of anger Sherlock has been waiting for. But it’s old anger, quiet and dealt with and scabbed over. “You, Sherlock Holmes, cannot be trusted. I thought once you were the North Star, but you’re a mirage. The closer I got to you the more elusive you were, and I loved it, basked in it while I allowed you to hollow me out until all there was left of me was you. And you loved that, didn’t you, making me dependent on you and strung out and desperate for your attention. You gobbled it up, you gobbled me up, and I let you. I let you. I let you define me, and when you were gone I had no idea who I was anymore.”
Mrs Hudson kisses his cheek and John has to leave the kitchen after that, because he’s blinking back tears and embarrassed and flight is the only option.
“Dates soaked in tea,” Sherlock answers, then grins at Mrs Hudson. “Come back later when I flame the toffee sauce for a really spectacular shot.”
They get bad takeout and solve murders. They watch quiz shows at three in the morning that John is always better at. Sherlock discovers that John is a fantastic poker player and they play for hours, but Sherlock isn’t sure that they’re not both just using it as an excuse to stare at each other.
“I think it’s the getting shelled part that sets John apart from us mere mortals,” Sherlock quips, and both Molly and John laugh, Molly’s shoulders relaxing a bit.
John sighs deeply, tired and looking sad and a bit lost. “This is my last night here. I promised Mary I’d move back in tomorrow.”
He wants something fruity to offset the dark chocolate, so he dips some raspberries in chocolate for decoration.
It’s quiet backstage. Sherlock half listens to the dialogue coming over the tinny speaker above the stage door. He has fifteen minutes until he needs to be on stage.
The killer puts two vials in front of Sherlock with a malicious grin. “One of those’ll kill you quick, like falling asleep. Other’s nasty stuff, will have you writhing on the floor like a drunk caterpillar.” He makes an inviting gesture. “Choose.”
It should be awkward. He should be too old for this. What it is, though, is warm and good and comforting. He likes the way Sherlock smells, like carbolic soap and boy sweat.
“What’s your birthday cake like?” Irene asks Sherlock, who’s been listening to his fellow bakers with a mixture of disgust and an odd nostalgic longing he can’t exactly parse.
Sherlock feels himself go cold, then hot, then cold again. “Thank you,” he says, trying to keep his voice steady and succeeding so well that he knows he’s almost completely hiding how nervous he actually is.
“Fine.” He gets up and pauses in the doorway, looking back at her, sitting in their kitchen, woolen cardigan wrapped around her against the cool night air. “Mary.”
John turns around and looks at Sherlock, and there’s something in his body language, something contained and cautious, that tells Sherlock this is more than not being able to sleep.
Sherlock is too busy to pay much attention to the rest of the room, but he can see a variety of scones, raisin, chocolate chip, plain, savoury.
After an indeterminable time, John draws back a little. “This counts,” he says a little breathlessly, against Sherlock’s lips, “this definitely counts.”
“I’m not saying you took it,” Sherlock adds, matching his tone to John’s, serious and quiet. “Maybe you found it lying on the ground at the marketplace. No harm in picking up something from the ground, right?”
Of course 221B is still there, and almost nothing has changed. The book he was reading when he left was still on the bedside table. The skull, the chairs, the sofa, his books, his violin, are all still in their place, barely touched by time.
They follow the group of Fey’a through the woods, and for a while they’re walking in silence. Sherlock is looking around curiously, but seems to have as little idea of where this is going as John.
Sherlock’s on his side, facing John, who’s lying on his back, staring at the ceiling. Sherlock puts his hand on John’s shoulder, palm flat against the joint. “Please,” he says, one last effort. “I can’t watch you die. Please.”
“That offer he made us. Do you think it’s genuine?” John asks the question that’s been going around in his mind since the killer mentioned it.
“Well.” Moran cocks his head to his side. “That’s about the best goddamned thing I’ve ever eaten in my life.”
“You two seem to have hit it off splendidly,” she says, apparently hoping for a bit of gossip for the cameras.
It occurs to him that it’s dark, the smoke makes it almost impossible to see, and he’ll never be able to transport his unconscious friend anywhere.
When they’re all seated around the kitchen table, Sherlock gets out the pies. “Before we get down to business, I’ve got something for you to taste.”
Sherlock looks up from where he’s been watching the patterned swirl of Victor’s latte. “I rather think it should be the other way around.”
“This is ridiculous, the judges are clearly letting Sherlock win because they think people like him more because he’s shagging Watson. They’re just doing it for the attention, can’t you see this? And you’re playing right into their hands. This is a baking show, and you leave in all their ridiculous flirting, and cut away from people actually bloody baking.”
She turns to Sherlock, and her smile noticeably dims. “Dr. Sholto asks if you’ve got some more of the stronger Feverweed.”
He should have won. Why didn’t he win? His bake was objectively perfect. There was nothing he could have done better.
He wonders what that says about him, as he contemplates Sherlock’s sleeping face. It’s more than obvious to him that he
He discovered that Molly was wrong. John wasn’t ‘not doing well’. He was… Sherlock has no words for what John was.
“How can you ever make decisions, then?” Sherlock asks, and there’s an edge of desperation in his voice.
Before, he was inclined to regard John’s presence in his life as a temporary luxury, something he would soon tire of or discard or watch as it walked away, a transient comet passing through his life, unique, beautiful, but not meant to stay.
The problem is, of course, that he thought six years would have cleared the odd fixation with having John Watson’s undivided attention out of his system, but apparently, that’s not true, because here he is, two hours in, and he’s already having a hard time concentrating on anything else. But he needs to put this behind him. John can do it, he can look at Sherlock and be completely calm, be the perfect DSM who never gets nervous, never gets flustered, never says he’s tired or hungry or needs a break, and if he can be in the same room with Sherlock and not feel anything, then Sherlock can do it too.
He’s teaching at Uni, moved to Manchester and lives with a bloke. Sherlock gets punched in the face. John breaks up with the bloke but stays in Manchester. Sherlock moves to Manchester. He hates it. John throws him out after his third cocaine bender. Sherlock goes back to London alone. John stays in Manchester.
“Neither are you,” Sherlock mutters, voice barely more than a whisper, because it’s difficult to speak around the emotion clogging up his throat.
Because the photos, aside from revealing that John has shitty baking equipment, also demonstrate that his kitchen is not only old and ugly, but tiny.
Silence falls. Sherlock glares over at the house they’re supposed to be watching, hoping their suspect will show up soon. He’s sick of this car.
The judging is excessively dreary. Irene, Moriarty, Sherlock, John and Molly all delivered perfect roulades that are virtually indistinguishable from each other. Mary’s roulade is good, but it’s cracked in several places, and so are Janine’s and Neela’s. Anderson’s roulade is crumbly, tough and dry, he overbaked the sponge and there’s no saving it. Nobody is looking at Anderson during the judging, and it’s glaringly obvious that his showstopper bake tomorrow needs to be spectacular, or he will go home.
Sherlock grins, glad Mrs Hudson can’t see his face. Two weeks to press night. Good. He likes a challenge, and he likes Mrs Hudson. “What’s the part?”
“Combining two classic desserts into one like this is genius,” Moran says, licking his spoon. “I love the caramel crunch in the souffle.”
Sherlock sets down his box and goes to work. He tests the ovens, the draft, the distance to the next exit, the temperature of fridge and freezer units. Then he quickly weighs oven quality and temperature fluctuations and finally picks the workstation furthest from the tent entrance.
“Ah,” Sherlock says, very much noncommittal, and turns his attention back to the microscope. Or it would seem so to anyone who doesn’t know him as well as John does, because John knows that Sherlock might
Molly comes in, carrying her ingredients and implements in a red cardboard box decorated with flowers. She gives him a nervous smile, which he returns, then goes to set up, as ever a contrast between fluttery nerves and easy competence.
Sherlock gestures to the clinic upstairs. “As soon as Molly is done assisting Dr. Sholto. Apparently living patients are a priority.”
What happened, he later deduces, was this: When he came home from helping Lestrade put away a completely boring criminal on an entirely unremarkable Thursday, three thugs working for an international drug-smuggling ring he and John busted up a few weeks ago held him down, shot him up with a very interesting drug cocktail, planning to watch him writhe before he died. At which point John came home, severely injured two of the thugs, while the third fled the scene. Sherlock was taken to the hospital, admitted, treated, and stabilized.
It’s seven in the evening on December 24th, and the streets are nearly deserted. It’s shockingly easy to find a taxi, and traffic is almost non-existent. Apparently, everybody has already gone wherever they wanted to go. It smells heavily of snow and the clouds are thick and dark, hanging low and threatening over a silent London glittering with fairy lights and candles.
And to you all, who made sharing this story with you such a joy. Thank you so much for caring about these two idiot bakers as much as I do. I will never forget the feeling of having all of you yell variations of 'Sherlock, you IDIOT' in the comments.
“It was getting cold so I drank it myself,” Sherlock lies, but he feels his lips tug up into a smile. “That’s what you get for being late.”
Sherlock looks at the samples in John’s hands, and then at Mary, who’s still leaning against John, John’s arm draped casually around her.
Sherlock looks up to meet Mycroft’s eyes and discovers that his brother is smiling, just a hint of it around his mouth, but still genuinely smiling. “If you want me to stop treating you like a junkie, it’s time to stop acting like one. You were right to be wary of emotional entanglements after you came out of rehab, but as you just pointed out, you are no longer that person. You need to stop punishing yourself for a decision you needed to make to stay alive.”
John huffs a humorless laugh. “First, I’m a doctor. Second, nobody who doesn’t have a sleep problem tattoos a dead pig at three in the morning, and third, personal experience.”
Sherlock shrugs. “Go ahead and take it, I’d forgotten about it and I got myself a new one,” he says with just the right amount of indifferent nonchalance, gesturing at his mug.
Mycroft darts a glance at John, and John, well-bred as he is, immediately starts getting up. “If you two have something private to discuss….”
John’s eyes slip closed as he strokes himself. “Look at me,” Sherlock says, barely recognising his own voice. “John, look at me.”
This has been an excruciatingly long run. Six weeks of overcrowded dressing rooms, dirty dishes overflowing the tiny kitchen sink, beautiful polyester costumes reeking of sweat.
Sherlock nods briefly, but doesn’t answer, which is relatively usual for him. He’s glaring at Sarah’s hand on John’s arm, and for once John isn’t sure he wants to hear Sherlock’s deductions.
“You think that was easy for me? Leaving Rosie behind?” Mary looks at him, and there’s genuine hurt in her voice.
Mycroft maneuvers him into a car, and Sherlock loses track of everything until he’s sitting in front of a monitor and watches John Watson die. Even in the washed-out CCTV footage John looks pale and tired. He’s limping. He doesn’t pay attention to traffic. The lorry runs a red light. John doesn’t even look up.
Moriarty has made a Croquembouche, and it looks impressive, tiny pastry balls held together with spun caramel sugar. Moran raves about the technical difficulty, but neither Donovan nor Lestrade like it much.
“You’re not going to be any help at all about this, are you?” John asks, but it’s a rhetorical question and Sherlock doesn’t bother answering.
Sherlock thinks about commenting for a second, but decides against it. This feels personal, somehow, in the way his YouTube videos definitely aren’t, and he doesn’t want John to know that he’s been here. Also, the last thing he needs is to spend more time than absolutely necessary thinking of John Watson.
The others start trickling in. Sherlock pretends to ignore them while subtly watching them whether one of them will take the workstation. They all pass it by, greeting him with varying degrees of friendliness.
The back door opens, and suddenly John is there, standing in the kitchen and staring at Sherlock, who’s sitting at the table with a cup of tea in the dark.
John makes a beeline for the punch and Sherlock trails after him, uncertain what to do with himself. Then a draft hits him and he thinks,
Mycroft gives him a long look, which Sherlock returns without blinking. Then Mycroft sighs his long-suffering elder brother sigh and gets up. “Call Mummy.”
Carefully, Sherlock moves closer until he is in John’s personal space, and even more carefully, John backs away until he hits the wall and Sherlock looms over him, arms against the wall on either side of John’s head. They’re staring at each other like rabbit and snake, and it’s thrilling that Sherlock doesn’t know who is who in this scenario. He has no idea what he’s doing here, he only knows that it feels dangerous, like chemically unstable explosives, and that John looks calm and still like the ocean, but his eyes are wide and flashing and uncertain, and it’s wonderful because Sherlock loves upsetting John’s carefully kept balance almost as much as he loves crime scenes.
John isn’t afraid of Sherlock, not even a little bit, even though sometimes he looks like he thinks he should be. He knows Sherlock knows everything anyway, so he enjoys Sherlock’s attention instead of being scared of it like everybody else is.
John runs a hand over his face. It’s the middle of the night and he has no idea what Sherlock is talking about. “What?”
“You never asked,” Sherlock points out, gently, quietly, looking up at John, and there’s so much emotion in his eyes it takes John’s breath away. It reminds him painfully of how Sherlock used to look at him back in the day, and the moment stretches, and they just sit there, gazing at each other, neither wanting to look away. John’s heartbeat picks up noticeably, and he thinks of just leaning over and kissing Sherlock…
