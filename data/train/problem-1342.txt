John nodded, more than willing to uncover the milky expanse of Sherlock’s perfectly tuned transport.
, and was essentially left adrift in an ocean of confusion. He was in no way prepared to be a father, but Harry and Clara had been extremely eager to become parents and had quite literally begged on their knees to adopt Rosie.
“So, you’re exclusive then?” John looked upset and it made Sherlock feel better and worse, both at the same time.
being made available.”
John’s face darkened, “No. You
, do I make myself clear, Doctor Watson? Sherlock has only ever asked for you, do not fail him.”
They fucked late into the night and part of the early morning. Sherlock had never done that with anyone, not ever. He’d never felt the insatiable need to have someone’s cock inside him, and he was now addicted to the feel of hot come dripping out of it. His hole felt swollen and almost raw, deliciously oversensitive. The soldier knew his time was coming to an end, so he brutally shoved his prick deep into Sherlock’s backside until the boy was nearly yelping with pain and urges to continue. When he knew his body couldn’t take any more, Sherlock came as the soldier let out a mighty grunt and filled Sherlock’s arse one last time. They slept for a short time; Sherlock curled up in the smaller man’s arms until shortly before dawn. “I hate to do it, but I have to go.”
“Indeed, Holmes, it is indeed.” With a kiss to seal the deal, the pair of them made their way back to 221 B Baker Street the moment their case was solved and began to demonstrate their ardour for one another. Downstairs, Mrs Hudson discreetly turned up her radio to muffle the regular thumping sounds coming from upstairs. Smiling, she began to bake a batch of fruit-filled muffins. Her boys would need energy, and a sweet treat would be a good way to preface a request that they purchase a sturdier and much more silent bed-frame. Humming under her breath, Mrs Hudson turned her radio up even more as the new lovers began to enthusiastically increase their efforts. It was lovely, and she had never been so happy for them.
He didn’t.
She was weak and compliant now, so John took the opportunity to indulge himself while she recovered. He fucked her deep and hard, imagining another arse, another body, another gender. He’d almost bought a boy this time but couldn’t bring himself to do it. He could fuck a woman, but choosing a man felt a little too much like cheating, even if he wasn’t exactly in a relationship. “You’re going to wear it out.”
Sherlock and John had been arguing for days. A complex case involving human trafficking of minors had everyone existing at maximum levels of stress with the minimum amount of food and sleep. Nerves were beyond frayed, and time was slipping away from them. In the very last hour before the next largest shipment of innocent souls was to be sent on, Sherlock managed to ignore every detail of the trauma he unearthed and followed the clues like a possessed bloodhound. When he successfully led their team to the holding facility, he
Mycroft wasn’t subtle in his reply, “I am incredibly disappointed in you, Doctor Watson, but never fear. I will see to it that my brother receives the best possible care.”
Mary did not accept his apology. She went so far as to bite her lower lip and slump her shoulders. It was artful, but John suddenly recognised the well-practised pose. She wanted him to feel bad about hurting her feelings and ignore the fact that she had deliberately trampled on his. It wasn’t the first time. In fact, Mary had used that exact same expression to get herself out of other situations one time too many and he now recognised it for the manipulation it was. Mary knew that a beta was no competition against an omega, and he couldn’t help that his body had recognised something very specific; a ripe unclaimed omega he knew was available. His basic biology wasn’t giving him a choice about that, so he had to fight back with his logical mind, and behaviour like hers wasn’t helping - quite the opposite. Mary’s choice to mock his old life severely decreased his desire to retain the life they’d envisioned together. This whole evening had been a game changer.
John looked angry and then upset but Lisa just laughed as if Sherlock had said the funniest thing she’d ever heard, “Oh, you! You’re everything I expected, and more.”
John rather liked them. He knew that Sherlock was completely capable of dressing like a lady when he needed to for a case but the presence of this style of bespoke shoes was making John think that perhaps Sherlock liked prettier clothing for wearing when he
The case wasn’t terribly huge, but it was filled with dozens of small dark bottles with tightly screwed caps on them, “None of these are poisonous, are they?”
“I do not.” Tersely, Sherlock nodded once, then quickly walked away. John stood where he was for a minute until Sherlock was safely on the lift and heading down to the banquet room on his own. It took a few more minutes before another lift was available, and by the time John got to his table, the room was nearly full. Sherlock was seated two tables away with a group of young men and women who were all sitting in silent awe of the legend in their presence. John introduced himself to the collection of officers and lawyers who were at his table and tried to pay attention to the speakers.
your only best friend
Glad to meet you at last!” A second heavy punch took him in his stomach, and Sherlock bent in two, struggling not to vomit, his throat filling as he swallowed convulsively, “Arsehole!” she shouted. A savage open-hand slap made him lose the bag he was carrying, and his glassware shattered on the sidewalk.
. Sherlock was already trying to come up with some kind of excuse to explain why he'd not only stolen money from his master, but that he’d also run away, even if he had come right back, when the front door swung open. John glared blackly at Sherlock before reaching out and removing the butt of his smoke from his hand and throwing it onto the pavements. “Knees. Crawl back inside.”
“Mummy? Your mum? Why is your mum sending you actual mail?” John felt nervous.
Two of the larger newcomers trained handguns on him, compelling him to get to his knees. The front of his cell receded into the wall to the left, and John could only hold himself still while he was examined, rudely biopsied, and notated. His neighbour was receiving similar treatment. Just when he thought they might be done, John found his arm being seized by two of the strangers who held firmly, while a third injected a painfully large bored syringe worth of clear fluid into the muscle mass of his upper arm. It hurt, burning almost immediately. John grew dizzy and flushed and felt adrenalin punch through him as he began to panic.
Sherlock scowled mutinously. “No. I have no further wish to communicate with John Watson. He’s a liar and a cheat. He’s a brute and a villain. Look at me! He did
“I think I gave them to myself because I feel like it’s already Christmas. We’re going to go out all the time if it means I get to see you like this more often.” John meant it.
“The mail key, too, John. Now, if you please.” Sherlock tried to harden his heart as he witnessed John’s struggle to part with his last link to 221 B Baker Street, but it was a painful necessity.
Sherlock was sitting at the table, his long fingers nervously tugging at the corner of the tablecloth. The concierge left John there and the doctor couldn’t make himself move. He was too busy drinking in the sight of Sherlock sitting there wearing all the things that John had purchased for him, the pashmina, the blouse, the skirt, and
John’s gaze dropped to his knees and his voice grew quieter, “I’ve been the worst friend in the world to you and I am ashamed of myself. I swear to you Sherlock, you won’t see that man again, I’m getting help, I’m working on all my problems, and I will never…” John had to take a breath. This was the sincerest proclamation he could make, and he wanted Sherlock to understand him clearly, “I will
“I don’t know, remember, I don’t do
John didn’t know. He couldn’t organise his thoughts and feelings fast enough to process all the revelations today had brought. Mary closed her tablet, shut off her night-light and pulled the covers up tight. John just went to bed, not attempting to soothe her in any way at all. The atmosphere in their bedroom had turned from companionable to bitter, and John wondered if he’d made a mistake when he’d first considered purchasing the ring that was on her finger, then became angry with himself for thinking the thought at all.
“Two more dates before you’re willing to…”
“Looks like you hate just everything, Aggie, and everything hates you.” David was cold. He kept stepping back, increasing the distance between him and the fight. “You loath omegas for being fecund, and you hate alphas for wanting to mate and bond, and you even hate other betas because you’re just a fountain of unhappiness, aren’t you, Aggie. So mad all the time, so furious that you don’t get your way every single moment. You want to control the world but you can’t even control yourself.” Mary gaped at her partner in shock when David stepped back, raising his weapon in an unthreatening manner and looking right at John, “You know what? I’m done. Gentlemen, sorry for the bother, but I am not fulfilling this contract. Good luck getting paid, Aggie, remember, the deal was for
The last of her would be gone soon enough, and then she would be nothing but a tarnished memory. John’s wardrobe was two-thirds empty now, all of Mary’s blouses and dresses packed tight into the boxes that Harry had gotten from the nearby market. John swallowed hard as he began to go through Mary’s jewellery. He had no idea what to do with any of it. Finally, John sorted out the costume pieces from the genuine ones, keeping the more valuable portion inside Mary’s large display case for when Rosie was older, and boxing the rest up to be donated to a charity.
“So, me trusting you makes this okay? Were you ever going to tell me?” Mary looked mulish and David looked like he wished he could evaporate on the spot, completely incapable of moving, just staying there covered in come, sweat, and embarrassment.
“Sherlock! Stop, stop struggling! You’re hurting yourself. Mycroft! Mycroft! Get in here and help me! Call a nurse! Get the doctor back! Sherlock’s having some kind of seizure!”
Daringly, he peeked inside and saw that the laundry had been put away and that the bed had been slept in, the dents on both pillows weirdly soothing. From what he could see, they’d come back just to sleep for a short while and then had left again. John realized that they were off working on their case. He then felt a bit proud that his sandwiches had been eaten because Sherlock often refused food on a case. He immediately became disheartened because obviously Danny had gotten Sherlock to eat, so it had nothing to do with John’s efforts.
The few who knew him smiled at his habits, rolled their eyes, or shrugged their shoulders, dismissing his collections as just another oddity. John, faithful blogger that he was, rooted it all out and bound it together in an album for Sherlock to flip through, happily reminiscing over past meals and rail trips. John supported Sherlock in whatever way required. The soldier had been awakened by his friendship with Sherlock and both men knew that all the years before they’d met had been gloomy as well as lonely, and it was good to have proof in hand that better times had been enjoyed. Those simple pleasures had been enough for Sherlock, now he needed to figure out how to reciprocate in a way that allowed John to feel the depth of his best friend’s regard.
“I know you do, my love, but we’ll work on that, alright?” The endearment alone demonstrated how Sherlock was so different now than before. He was assured, confident, and determined to do this. He had spoken his desire clearly using words instead of trying to get John to guess by leaving what he thought were obvious clues. “We’re both different men than we used to be, so let’s begin there. Forget how we were, we’ll never be that again, but instead, focus on who we could be. That’s what I want, John, our new
“He was a disgusting little troll who insulted
After a long while, Sherlock stirred a tiny bit, “Thanks for the gifts, John.”
John again, and he didn’t care how weird it was that he loved his friend’s aroma, it was a simple fact. Danny was entirely lovely, but he just didn’t suit Sherlock the way John did, and while he wasn’t distasteful to scent, he just wasn’t John. Sherlock was already feeling calmer, just knowing that John was coming home.
“Because…the sex?”
Mycroft rolled his eyes, “We can’t just stroll in.”
John tortured himself with what followed. While Sherlock recovered, John cared for him but without kindness, especially after the truth about Mary had been made painfully clear. John was professional but distant, ensuring that Sherlock received the best of care for his body, but giving nothing at all when it came to the detective’s emotions. He was too twisted up inside about his wife, how she had hidden everything true about herself but still expected John to love her as he had once done. He did love Mary Morstan, but the woman who looked like her was a very pregnant imposter.
Mycroft looked at John with pity, “Are you, Doctor Watson? I had hopes that you had risen above this. I have grave doubts that you are capable of exerting your free will, and I know my little brother well enough to know that he can’t resist how you are right now. You’d do absolutely anything for him.”
“Marry me?” Sherlock was stupefied. He was so unsettled by the dramatic change in their situation that his brain was behaving in a sub-optimal way. It kept focusing on the set of John’s lips, the way the second to the top button of John’s coat was only half-done, to how the odour in the air was reminiscent of expensive scotch and rare cigars.
John’s mouth opened but nothing came out.
Pavlovian saliva filled Sherlock’s mouth as he imagined how John was touching himself. Sherlock’s erection rose stiff and eager only moments later and without hesitation, Sherlock pushed his hands down his pants and gripped himself. To his complete surprise, he got some whispered dialogue along with his sneaking. “Yeah, gorgeous, open your mouth, Sherlock.”
metaphorically. How
As the months passed, their bond grew stronger. It was no longer a simple tie that melded their hearts. It had grown into a complicated mesh that kept them sane, stable, and incredibly happy. They did the Work together, solving cases as a solid unit, their strengths working seamlessly in unison to overcome their weaknesses and blind-spots until they were nearly unstoppable. Their reputation grew once again, but this time when people asked if they were a couple, both men would smile, nod, and proudly agree that they were. Sherlock never popped his collar or even buttoned his shirts up all the way. He loved to show off his bite-mark, preening as other omega eyed it enviously because John Watson was just that good.
“You always were a bit of a voyeur, John.” Sherlock's eyes were gentle now, and filled with something that John knew had been hidden away inside his friend, love. “I believe you are right, John. We have been hiding from one another, and it has indeed been far too long a time to keep such pointless secrets. I accept. I am very willing to marry you, John, but when it comes to the Work, I’m going to ask for a threesome. I can’t do it without you.”
“I love you so much, Sherlock, I always have. I can’t trust myself not to hurt you again, but I swear on my life that I will do my best to deserve you, I swear it.” Sherlock’s eyes were kind and full of love as John stared desperately up at him, hoping that Sherlock believed him, “You are my entire universe.”
“I will drag your lazy arse off this bed and drop you to the floor.” John’s threat only made Sherlock smile dreamily. John took his arm and hauled him to the edge of the mattress. He pulled Sherlock’s legs over and forced the detective to sit up. John leaned over and threw Sherlock’s unresisting arm over one strong shoulder and pulled up, yanking him to his feet, “Enough?”
Sherlock hissed, “Mycroft didn’t tell me about
If Sherlock had been a flower right then, it would be a tiny wilted one. He looked angry and ashamed of himself. “Listen to Mycroft, John. He’s…” Sherlock swallowed hard and couldn’t look at anyone, “He’s right,” he choked out. “I don’t actually need you to wait on me hand and foot twenty-four hours a day…I just like having you close, and…” Sherlock scowled at his brother before looking away, his cheeks pink with embarrassment before he almost whispered the last of it, “I like it when you fuss over me.”
John grappled with the bizarre intensity of it all, vertigo making the street go topsy-turvy and gravity to fluctuate
The soldier sat there and felt his worthlessness down to his very bones.
“I’m not talking about whoever that woman was, John, I’m talking about Sherlock Holmes,
, Sherlock realized. John just brought Rosie over whenever he needed to and assumed that Sherlock would just take her in. He had.
The women he met in clubs weren’t always entirely single, but he wasn’t judging them.
Danny looked at Mycroft when they were all finally gathered together, and there was the beginnings of loathing in his eyes, “Your own brother, Mycroft. Tell me, what makes you better than the people we’re hunting?”
Those two words broke the tension that had been building, and at the very idea of John surrendering himself willingly Sherlock felt himself pulsing shamelessly all over his best friend’s arse, holding his cock against John’s hole and spurting thick white blobs of come all around it. Sherlock dropped to his knees, struggling to breathe. With shaking hands he used a kitchen towel to wipe his mess away. Then Sherlock urged John to turn around, and without pausing to think about what he was doing, Sherlock sucked John off.
John both felt and heard Sherlock’s elongated groan of delight. He could feel the throbbing spurts inside him as his lover came. Sherlock’s body jerked harshly, slamming into John’s as he orgasmed. The taller man barely paused. He carefully extracted himself before slithering to his knees, engulfing John’s small prick, and enthusiastically using his lips and tongue until John could hold back no longer. When Sherlock pushed two long fingers into John’s well-fucked behind, he could not keep himself from coming a moment longer.
“You misunderstand, Sherlock. I have no problem at all with the idea of you being completely forever in love with me,
Mycroft left. Sherlock lay there listening to his heart monitor, and to the subdued sounds of the emergency ward. All the curtains were drawn, and he couldn’t see who the other patients were, but he could hear breathing, and occasionally, weeping. Loved ones. He didn’t have any right now, not until Mycroft came back. Sherlock didn’t even want to see Mrs Hudson because in his mind, she had sided with John, and that decision had led to this.
. Sherlock had perfected his anarchistic skills whilst hunting down Moriarty’s empire keepers, one small country would be no problem at all.
loved John intensely, but after today, he doubted that John returned that regard anymore, if he ever had. He very certainly had never said the words, it had all been implied, or so Sherlock had naively assumed. He’d almost said them, hundreds of times, but found his tongue too clumsy, or that he’d waited too long and the moments passed him by over and over again. He should have tried, at least once. Maybe, then, this wouldn’t have happened. For the first time in his life, Sherlock felt true doubt, and it was horrible.
“Then I want to examine everything
It began after a case. John was living back at 221 B Baker Street once again, revelling in the ongoing danger, confusion, and general unpredictableness of it all. He still felt guilty about his daughter, but Harry and Clara were such great parents, it was hard to feel like he’d made the wrong choice by allowing his sister and her wife to raise his little girl. After Rosie’s mother passed, John had broken down completely. He didn’t know how to explain things to people to let them know his wife was gone, how she had died, he couldn’t bring
“Take your pouty omega pheromones out of my club, if you please. Half the membership is in their golden years, their hearts can’t take the prolonged scent of a young omega,” Mycroft eyed his brother before going back to reading his work, “Well, young-ish.”
Sherlock found it a bit cumbersome, but he
John frowned again but this time Sherlock knew the doctor’s ire wasn’t directed at him, “Bastards! What did they do?” John looked ready to leave the flat to go find them.
John didn’t hesitate this time either. He didn’t care if Sherlock’s bonding gland had been destroyed all those years ago. Satisfying a primal need in both of them, John gripped Sherlock’s hips firmly and used the leverage to force his knot inside before bending down to swiftly bite his way through the thick scar on Sherlock’s neck, piercing him deeply top and bottom. They groaned together, and John lost himself in that moment, his mouth filled with a thick sweetness he’d never tasted before, his knot being milked by the convulsive throbbing of Sherlock’s inner passage as the omega orgasmed a second time. Pulse after pulse of come filled Sherlock as John came so hard that he nearly lost consciousness. He could taste the metallic tang of blood as he released his bite, collapsing on top of Sherlock to gasp for breath as his omega trembled beneath him.
“Bend over, I’m going to open you some more, and then I am going to penetrate you. Don’t struggle, you’ll only hurt yourself. If you don’t fight it, it may even feel pleasurable, but no matter what, I will be coming inside your arse!”
? “Don’t bother apologising. I’m not worth it. I’m not worth anything. I’ll leave. You deserve better.”
John perused the selections briefly before setting the menu down. When their server arrived with their wine and John’s cheesy garlic toast, he gave their order before handing Sherlock half-a-piece, “Come on, join me.”
what I said. I also know that you were in a bad place and that I’d help put you there. I know that what you did was because of how hard and cruelly you’d been pushed. I can’t undo what happened between us but...John...” Sherlock reached a shaking hand across the table, “John, living without you has been bleak and pointless. Coming across you this weekend...it feels like a chance I can’t pass up.”
Sherlock took note of how serious Danny’s face was, how deeply the man was looking at him. Danny seemed wound tight suddenly, almost dangerous, and Sherlock felt something inside him stir, “I’m no stranger to long term intrigue, especially at levels like this. I can help you, Danny, and if I cannot, I know someone who can.”
“Not sexing because of the drunkness.”
“I don’t care what size your pot is, John. Money or no money, I love you and only you. I want to live here with you. Finances have never mattered to me, not ever, and the only reason I even pressed for my inheritance was to get Mycroft off my back. He fusses still, but he can’t control me monetarily any longer. For all our previous problems, arguing over finances was never an issue.”
“Thank you, John.”
Sherlock’s heart melted even more. It was awfully dangerous to remain with John. Sherlock could feel the bonds beginning to form already, not that he was trying to stop them. His older brother had already made the attempt, but John had rebuffed his offers despite Mycroft’s powers. “Just name calling, John, nothing important.”
John’s eyes closed for a second, “I…I…may have left it at Sarah’s.” This was more convincing, “I’d forgotten. She doesn’t have one and she needed…”
“Sherlock?” John’s voice was thick with sleep. Sherlock kept his eyes closed, realizing that he’d woken John up by moving his arm. They were spooned up tight, as per usual, and John’s forearm was right beneath it. He could probably tell what Sherlock had just unconsciously done. His soldier peered over and looked down, biting Sherlock’s bicep playfully, “Oh, I see.” Sherlock picked up John’s hand and placed it low on his waist, but no closer to his erection than that. He felt John’s hand rubbing against his hip, instinctively keeping his caresses local and not exploratory, “I can easily go and just give you a bit of time alone, or…” John’s hand wandered over to Sherlock’s hip, “How would you feel about me helping you with that?”
. “What about her?”
Sherlock loved the endorphin rush from it all, and tonight, he was determined to get a taste of someone hard and sweaty.
the moral model you want to cling to? No, John! You didn’t appreciate his interference, did you, and he won’t appreciate yours. In fact, you can bet that Sherlock would practically handcuff himself to Danny if he thought someone was trying to make them break up, just for stubborn spite. Am I right?” John reluctantly nodded. Sherlock could be the ultimate brat. Perhaps Harry was right, copying his behaviour probably wasn’t the healthy choice. “Good, glad we’re on the same page. Okay then, that means you’re going to have to make like an adult and get on with the bloke. Don’t be the cause of stress between him and Sherlock. Don’t give into your adolescent urge to show up him, embarrass him, threaten him, or intimidate him.”
Sherlock did as he was bid, penetrating his master with his finger until he was fucking John slowly with it. John sighed happily and lay there smiling with his eyes closed, “Lovely, just lovely. Two now, slow.” Sherlock spit on his fingers and carefully worked them in. John was hot and tight. Every once in a while, he clenched down deliberately, almost grinding Sherlock’s knuckles together, “That’s really good. Three now, pet, let’s see if you can get three in there.”
. Sherlock had to get high right afterwards. Sherlock blocked any contacts who might reach him on John’s behalf, before going the extra distance and getting himself a new mobile, with an entirely new number. Now only Mrs Hudson and Mycroft could reach him. It was just easier.
“You’ve lost a lot too, I can see it.” Danny stood up, “That’s what I do, I
“We do miss him, of course,” blathered Mrs Hudson, “But then, if John were here, we wouldn’t have room for you, Danny, isn’t that right? There are only the two bedrooms, and Sherlock has been ever so lonely since John left.” She leaned in to register his response, clasping her hands together hopefully.
John seemed to be stunned into silence. “Relationship?” John was the one blinking now, “Wait, you love me?”
Shake shake shake. “Book.”
7:35 am – I may have shopped excessively.
Sherlock fucked John with powerful strokes, each thrust hard enough to make John’s arse shake upon impact and it drove Sherlock wild. He wanted to be inside John forever or have John inside of him, he didn’t care. He needed this connexion, needed this feeling. He wanted to come urgently but at the same time, he never wanted this session to end so he drew it out, teasing them both by slowing his pace or quickening it, by drawing himself out carefully before plunging back in again. Sherlock writhed above John, twisting his hips and sinking in deeply, sometimes making hasty little stabs inward before switching to long gliding thrusts that made them both tremble.
Sherlock flushed hot and cold at John’s words. No spouse or romantic partner would accept those conditions for long. A slave was his master’s easiest choice. “Yes, John.” John didn’t wait, leading Sherlock through well-appointed rooms until he got to what was clearly his bedroom. John touched Sherlock softly, running his fingertips over the planes of Sherlock’s muscles, rubbing and teasing the more sensitive areas. “Right now?”
The iron in their tools made him feel twitchy, and that reaction made him frown. John always gave him side-eyes when he came home twitchy, accusing glances that demanded to know if Sherlock had lapsed back into drugs. Sherlock sighed.
Anderson assisted, for once being silent as well as helpful. He provided evidence bags, logged them, and didn’t ask where John was. Donovan showed up after a few days, now available since the case she’d been working had been successfully concluded. She, too, was silent about John and, once more, Sherlock was grateful. He continued to live at Mycroft’s homes, moving from one to another as the whim took him, and after the first two weeks, had spread his possessions evenly among them. Mycroft never complained and seemed content knowing that his little brother was making a mess safely underfoot instead of self-destructing somewhere in private.
“Whimsy, at first. Uncle Rudy always had a flair for outrageous clothing. I liked lovely things too, but it seemed too much like copying his style to follow my inclinations. I did love Uncle Rudy, but he was one-of-a-kind, I didn’t want to be a substitute for him in my family’s eyes. Then, after several years of thinking it over, I realized I just liked them. I liked the idea of how I would look in clothing like this, how it would feel, how it would make other’s look at me. Overall, it was positive but I never really went further than thinking about it. Uncle Rudy was very fond of this sort of thing. I saw them in a store and just…I just did it.”
Sherlock began slowly. He shifted and rocked until he found a rhythm that felt delicious. Moaning softly he allowed his body to grind and press, teasing himself internally. It was utterly delightful but he didn’t like that he couldn’t see John’s face. Carefully, Sherlock pulled himself off, regretting the empty feeling he experienced when John’s penis left his body, but still turning himself around with relative grace until he was once again straddling his sandy-haired lover.
Sherlock felt like the entire room was spinning around in a gloriously chaotic swirl. The only thing that kept him from submitting to vertigo was John’s steadying presence. For a man so much shorter than he was, John was still powerful, and in his own very special way, much
John was certain that the current situation could be weathered.
“He certainly didn’t look like he was having the time of his life.”
did that.
marriage. Still, she was wearing the ring he hadn’t officially given her because Sherlock had interrupted before he could pop the question. It was a moot point, anyway. John had deliberately arranged the evening in order to ask her to be his wife, they both knew it, and she very obviously accepted without him needing to do the deed. Sherlock being alive had nothing to do with that.
, the one who am I
Mycroft found him on the bathroom floor hours later. Sherlock had managed to dress himself but once all his products and tools had been tucked away, he’d fallen to his knees and wept as he’d never done even as a child. He felt adrift because everything he’d believed about himself and John was so obviously wrong.
Mary and David weren’t expecting him to leap out at them from a pile of restaurant trash. At least it was relatively clean recycling, but John was pretty sure that the state of the cooking oil can that was smacked hard into the back of his head wasn’t the detail that David was worried about. A tiny spray of blood painted the side of Mary’s face as the sharp corner pierced David’s scalp. David grunted and staggered upon impact and Mary hesitated for a micro-second before pulling a handgun from her coat and beginning to swing it John’s way. An open-handed slap from a very large hand spun her around. Mary hissed as Sherlock plucked her weapon away, flinging it over his shoulder to disappear inside a large bin filled with organic waste.
“Blue or orange undertones?”
don’t know him? I’m thinking that I do, and sight better than you do, mate, for all that he’s supposed to be your best friend. As for what he’s been through? Love, I know things he’s
With that gone, all the rest fell apart. There was nothing to be done now. With the foundation gone, all the rest was as insubstantial as smoke. He couldn’t remain in a friendship with John. He couldn’t stay in the same residence as John, not when he knew what John thought of him, what he’d let everyone know as well. Sherlock could barely think. His gasps seemed to be coming from high in his chest as if he was no longer capable of taking a deep breath. He walked faster to calm himself. Hours after dark Sherlock sent a text to Mycroft with the only course of action he could tolerate, “
“You like that?” John sounded surprised!
The rest of the walk went right over his head as his brain whited out momentarily with lust. It took all of his self-discipline to not just disappear into his mind palace to work out the logistics. He managed to pay attention to John’s words but Sherlock didn’t take in the snowy landscape, the other happy Londoners who were bundled up and walking about in cheerful groups, or any of the other winter scenes that played out around him. All he could see was John; lovely, laughing, happy, smiling,
Without hesitation, the man took the only bid to come his way. “
Sherlock sighed again before performing the required ablutions. When he was done, he went to fetch the lube so he could see to the rather large plug that John had set on the bedside table.
“What do I do?”
John nodded with understanding, “I get it, I do. You’re one-of-a-kind too Sherlock. You are so much more than other people. This is just one of your many parts, and I love you for all of them.”
He felt his mind recalibrating itself, taking in all the new information, adjusting for the time that had passed. He was still working on leaving behind the vividness of the nightmare, though. Logically he knew that his mind had created a construct to deal with the physical pain he had subconsciously experienced despite the heavy sedatives and had made him live in that construct until he was finally allowed to awaken. John was not to blame for any mental damage that had occurred, but regardless, it was there. Sherlock had been afraid of John,
“No, you’re not.”
but now you’ve got two, no need to thank me, but he should know, right? Why didn’t you tell me he was so pretty in real life? None of those press shots does him justice at all. Does he still have the hat? If he does, we can get him to wear it. I know some single alphas looking for someone, he’d do well by them. He’s far too old to be gadding about single and vulnerable. If they won’t do, I know some nice strong alpha ladies who could settle him down. He needs a firm hand, obviously.”
John spread his legs a bit and placed his feet flat on the mattress, bucking his hips upward sharp and firm, causing Sherlock to cry out as a shockwave of pleasure shot through him. John took control then, fucking himself up into Sherlock’s body, holding him at exactly the right angle to stimulate him the most. It was enough to cause Sherlock to white out for several seconds, too overwhelmed with growing pleasure to have any rational thoughts in his head. He’d never imagined being able to feel such things. His orgasms had always been nice, but not earthshaking, and now, John was fucking him so well that Sherlock was a bit afraid of coming in case he fainted from the intensity.
His legs were spread, the strange alpha’s thigh keeping them apart, and John could see that Sherlock’s flies had already been undone and that his zipper was down. The room was drenched in defensive pheromones as Sherlock chemically called for help. He looked pasty and ill instead of flush with arousal.
Sherlock silently berated himself. He couldn’t allow himself to waste his time and energy with recrimination. He needed to conserve every joule of energy toward finding his dearest friend. Sherlock crawled beneath his duvet in the dark and felt Danny climb under on his side of the bed. He was here to sleep, so sleep he would. Sherlock closed his eyes and willed himself unconscious.
Four days went by in a lustful haze. John barely remembered himself enough to ensure that Sherlock kept drinking the thick pre-packaged energy shakes between bouts, and to make himself gulp down water and a bite or two of fruit before the urge to mate overwhelmed them again. John did his best to control his alpha instincts to remember the condoms, but it was difficult, especially since they’d gone without during that first amazing round. The oral contraceptives should be enough, but it was the mess he was trying to prevent. Sherlock wasn’t likely to get pregnant but that didn’t mean that John had to expose him to any risk whatsoever or to sleep in a puddle of cooling spunk. Sherlock needed help and not more hindrances.
The doctor sat on the edge of the bed, a large and happy smile on his face. After he managed to drink a recuperative sip, Sherlock noticed that John was wearing Sherlock’s favourite blue robe. It suited him, even if the arms were a touch too long. “I think some food will help our stomachs.”
after I’m done,” John promised darkly. Eventually he began to pull back further and to slide in faster. Bit at a time, John began to truly fuck Sherlock, bucking his hips and finding a pace that caused their bodies to slap together loudly. He seemed to enjoy that too, pounding his big cock into Sherlock’s swollen hole with abandon. Sherlock could barely stop his sobs, even shouting out whenever the sharp jabs became too much to keep silent about. It hurt, certainly, but worst of all, he felt entirely dehumanised to be used so impersonally. John was laying on top of him now, his hips moving steadily as he pleasured himself without care for Sherlock’s potential needs. “Yeah, that feels good right there, oh fuck you’ve got a tight arse, so pretty, so wet, just gorgeous.” John was now braced on his fists, his hips slamming hard into Sherlock’s arse, forcing his cock to go as deeply as possible, “Fuck, I needed this.” John’s voice was deep and raspy, “I’ve had such a week. All I want is someone to fuck to take the edge off, you’re so fucking perfect, listen to how you cry!”
Sherlock smiled reassuringly up at him, “Calm down, John. Everything is as well as can be.” John was a bit surprised when Sherlock gingerly reached out and took his hands in his, his head bowed for a moment before he looked up, “John, I have a proposal for you.”
That just wasn’t on. “
“Oh, Sherlock,” John’s heart melted. He didn’t want to be angry with his omega, so he wasn’t, but he was relieved. “You know I’m going to fuss over you forever, there’s no need to behave like I won’t. Bond or not, I’m not going anywhere. I’m yours.” Looking after Sherlock was a privilege. John didn’t resent it a bit.
“You can’t. You don’t want me. You just said so.”
committed to surprising you with a finished result that I drove you away rather than just fucking admit that I was writing a book about you. Lisa is my publisher. We’ve been meeting so her photographer could take shots of all the places that were special to the two of us. We’ve been all over London as a group. She was tracking our daily activities,
“You have a fever, John.” Sherlock stopped talking again when John mouthed wet sloppy kisses along his throat while he fisted his friend’s cock. After a shocked moan of delight, Sherlock choked out a few more words, “John, I fear that you are mostly asleep and having a rather erotic dream featuring me. I, however, am
with a caption beneath saying,
They stood. John sat there simply holding his now empty cup as Donovan leaned in, “John if you can understand me, blink once if Sherlock is drugging you.” John scowled at her and did not blink though his glare was intense. “Fine. Blink twice if he’s compelling you to stay here in this cesspool.” John upped the intensity of his glare and continued to not blink, “John Watson, are you here of your own free will?”
,” John watched as the omega crumpled as if he’d become a puppet whose strings had been cut. Sherlock’s arms went up, demanding to be held, his posture child-like and distraught. Mycroft walked over quickly, catching the Omega before he collapsed. Sherlock was sobbing into Mycroft’s shoulder, clutching him desperately, shaking with fear. “Help me, brother, I’m not right. It’s all wrong now. My head is all messed up inside, I can’t…everything is
“You’re a doctor. You know you’re clean. I am too, look, the fridge. I got my latest back, clean as the driven snow.”
I can get you meds, and everything you’ll need, and you wouldn’t need to worry about any sort of authority finding out. I’ll take care of everything, I’ll make it as easy for you as I can, just please, let me help you get better. I’ll leave right after. You won’t have to ask. Just, get healthy, and …”
“Sherlock, it’s not like that.” Perhaps, but the mixture of guilt and stubbornness on John’s face was loud and clear, “It’s nothing. There’s nothing like that happening.”
. Listening to John was addictive, and he was a junkie. After a while, simply listening wasn’t enough. Cupping his hand over his swelling manhood, Sherlock attempted to calm himself. That worked for a few days, but soon he was slipping his hand down his pants and rubbing himself, just a bit. He enjoyed the gentle plumping of his penis but didn’t try to take it further than that. He hadn’t
As soon as he got home, Sherlock dosed himself heavily, not pausing to clean himself off, nor change into something more comfortable than a day-old suit stained with blood, snot, and sick. His nose had clotted, and he had brilliant bruises blooming all over the place. Thanks to the drugs, it didn’t trouble him a jot. The cuts on his hand bled freely, it was of no note. Sherlock didn’t care that the aged area carpet was ruined with a growing puddle of it. He was so out of it that he didn’t hear the street-door being knocked upon or hear John’s anxious voice shouting up at him. He didn’t hear Mrs Hudson’s words float angrily through the air, and he didn’t hear the police sirens wailing as she called in an intruder, nor did he notice the ambulance that came soon after to carry him away to a hospital, a short man limping by his side, calling out his blood-type and allergies.
“Well, let me know if John’s nose needs breaking all the way, you know I’m up for it.” Greg looked stern, that is until the music began to play and then he was all business, “Come on, that’s us.”
Sherlock was curiously pliant and unresisting. He didn’t struggle or complain that John was too heavy. Instead, the omega appeared to be humming softly, a small smile on his lips, his eyes closed as he shivered along with the waves of pleasure that still wracked him. John blinked blearily and saw that Sherlock’s neck was dripping blood. Instinctively, he lapped and licked at it, keeping it up until the wound sealed over, leaving behind a perfect impression of John’s teeth. It filled John with a sense of satisfaction and completion that he’d never experienced, and it was the last lucid thought he had for days.
John smiled back. “Well, kick off those incredible shoes and let me try to kiss you.” Sherlock laughed but also bent over, carefully removing his beautiful footwear, “Why did you buy them?”
me. You left me bleeding on the curb and went with
Without thinking, John just texted Sherlock.
John felt the fool the entire way back to Baker Street. He had thought he’d loved Mary and that she’d loved him in return. Now he knew that this wasn’t the case at all. Feeling sick, he went to the clinic and had his blood drawn, hoping against hope that he hadn’t gotten anything from his ex-fiancée and that if he had, that he hadn’t given it to Sherlock. It felt like an eternity had passed before he made it back to 221 B Baker Street, dragging his meagre possessions behind him.
John wiped his mouth with a second cloth after he mopped his eyes with the first one, but he had to lean against the cold brick wall to catch his breath, and to control the tears that threatened to fall. John’s chest felt tight and there was a burning sensation radiating from it. His left arm felt numb and for a few minutes, John considered that he might be having a heart attack, but the symptoms passed once he began to weep. He was mortified to be out in public where anyone could witness his downfall but it hurt so horribly that he could not stop, not even if every woman he’d ever slept with had been standing there and watching in judgement.
Sherlock lay in John’s arms and felt at peace with the world. “I love you, John. I want to give you everything.”
, Harry! Sherlock all but told me to do so, he’s the one who organised everything. He thought he was helping Mary, for me.” Harry was almost glaring at him, obviously struggling to contain her comments. “I know, okay, I know. I’m an absolute
He wasn’t even sure who he was angry at anymore, but John was filled with undirected rage. He fought to control it half-heartedly, but John’s anger won out often. Sherlock just let it, accepting it, sometimes even encouraging it. The detective made no move to defend himself, not any longer. The temptation to hurt Sherlock, to keep hurting him, was powerful and John knew it was wrong. He knew very well that sleeping around with random people was making Sherlock feel terrible, but it didn’t seem to be enough to stop John, even when it made him feel ill after a tryst. The confusing nervous energy had to be released somehow, and sex was the least physically destructive way, though the emotional costs were climbing daily. He didn’t know what to do. John needed to purge himself of the sickness in his soul. He needed to make amends, reparations,
He was flirting with Sherlock. John closed his eyes and groaned.
John had never loved his sister more
John knew he had to change, right now, or his sister’s concerns would become an ongoing reality. He had no right to be bent out of shape when all Sherlock had done was sit beside his partner
Sherlock was miserable again despite the fact that his body felt amazing
“You already do, love, you make life liveable. I wouldn’t want to live it with anyone else.” John’s arms tightened around Sherlock’s body, holding him closer still, “Rest now, Sherlock. I’ll order in food from that place you like, and we’ll celebrate the holiday our way.”
Mycroft rolled his eyes so hard the neighbours could probably feel his disbelief, “Oh, please, Doctor Watson. Those are very pretty words but then, you were always good with pretty words. What you aren’t good at is
you want me back. If you don’t, then that will be completely fine. I’ll be your best friend, regardless.”
happy, and when he was this upset, there was only one person to shout at. Calmly, Sherlock took out his mobile, and hit speed-dial #2, “Mycroft? Can you explain to me why we have
. She smiled brightly at the doctor, and Sherlock noticed that she discreetly tried to catch John’s eye, smiling extra hard whenever John even glanced her way. The doctor was either blind to her clear flirtations or incapable of multitasking because he was beginning a chart for Sherlock’s details and appeared to be completely focussed on filling out the paperwork as fully as possible on his own. Dismissing his nurse, John himself weighed, measured, and evaluated Sherlock’s health. He noted down everything, including Sherlock’s birthday, commenting, “I’ll remember to get you the dessert of your choice.”
John didn’t know how to react, frozen like a deer in the headlights of an unexpected vehicle. Sherlock had walked away from him once today already and clearly wanted nothing to do with him, but now they’d have to spend the next three days in closer proximity than he would ever have anticipated, even if was an entire hallway and separate rooms. He smiled awkwardly to hide his discomfort and uncertainty, “What are the odds, right?” John knew his lame joke fell flat.
“Please what, pretty boy? Let you come? Stop? Come inside you?”
Mrs Hudson and Sherlock both looked at John who swallowed hard, “If you could forgive me, Mrs Hudson. I was quite the idiot the last time we spoke. I can never apologise enough. All I can do is to try and be a better person than I was.”
Sherlock complained to one of the very few people he spoke with regularly, and an hour later, Mike Stamford brought a limping man into the morgue to meet him.
John forced himself to get up, groaning a little as he peeled a sheet off his calf and nearly fell as his weak legs attempted to get him to the loo. Sherlock’s snores were uninterrupted as John wobbled his way to the bathroom. Once there, he gingerly relieved himself, wincing as his very chafed penis silently complained about overuse. John brushed his disgusting teeth, and then managed to get into the shower. The first blast of ice-cold water shocked him the rest of the way awake. He washed himself carefully, his strained muscles and empty belly making him feel queasy.
The line abruptly went dead, so Sherlock tossed his mobile onto the chair by his bed and stripped himself down. He felt dirty, inside and out, as if he’d been dipped in a pollutant. He needed to cleanse it off him, out of him.
2539 dipped his chin, considering his options. “Our best chance is at the beginning of a bout. There are two entrances to the bowl. The panel stays open 17 seconds, I’ve been timing it. It takes fifteen seconds to run all the way across the space, leaving us a potential two seconds to get through the door and on the other side before it closes entirely. If we stand in the very centre instead of at the back, we can cut that down to an eight-second run.”
self, not this arse you’ve become lately. Sherlock sacrificed himself because he wanted you to live, so live. Don’t let your negatives cancel out your positives. Bad shit happens, try not to let it suck away to good bits completely when it does. I know you can do this, and didn’t you say he adored Rosie? She’s a valuable ally. Don’t be down.”
. “Well, I’m here whenever you want me to taste test anything.”
“So that’s it then? We’re together.”
Sherlock found him later at his flat, eyes red from weeping, stomach emptied more than once from nervous nausea. “I’m sorry,” John wept again, “I didn’t mean to run. I’m sorry.”
John went up to say hello, but just as he arrived a notification chirped at him. He couldn’t help but grin, immediately and completed distracted from his real life. It was one of the bolder women from the night previous with a follow-up text. Smiling, John turned away as he set down Rosie’s bag, tuning out Molly’s conversation with Sherlock. Absently waving goodbye, John left the flat, composing a flirtatious reply, forgetting to kiss his daughter farewell as he left. He took the Tube the rest of the way, exchanging ever heated texts with a particularly lush looking redhead who wasn’t above a bit of public transport sexting. John made a lunch date with her. He knew just the place, a small little restaurant with well sound-proofed restrooms. He’d have her in one of them after they ate.
Sherlock’s thoughts were dark and violent as he strode away from 221 B Baker Street. He wasn’t expecting someone to come running up behind him and bloody well tackle him to the paving stones, banging his chin and scraping his cheek. Sherlock fought back with all the grace and fury of a startled cat, scratching, biting, punching, and kicking. “Stop it, you arse!”
Doctor Hooper was someone Sherlock was comfortable with, so much so that he barely chastised her at all for continuously trying to chat him up. Sherlock always gave a mental sigh and internally reviewed his operating protocols for when he was in the company of an unattached single party such as herself, realizing that he’d yet again wandered across the border between pleasant and flirtatious. He was trying to be engaging but not to the degree where he’d invite propositions for coffee which was code for a date which leads to either coitus on a one-off basis or an extended relationship. Sherlock wasn’t interested in anyone for anything but what information their minds might contain that would help him solve crimes. Molly, as she insisted on being called, was a brilliant pathologist yet she seemed to measure her success based on the status of her personal life, rather than her paid skills. Sherlock found that to be incomprehensible. He was the Work, he loved it, was devoted to it, it encompassed his life. How could anything or anyone possibly compete with the Work? She needed to stop trying.
. John Watson should be in jail.
Mycroft’s eyes were troubled, “Perhaps it’s because we never gave him a chance.”
, John, don’t tell me you’re dumping me over something so insignificant? People cheat. They work it out. They move on. It’s a minor glitch.”
. This had been his last chance to find an owner before he was sent to the brothels to be of common service until he died of disease or old age. Sherlock was appalled to be a slave but being a slave to a single individual was far better than being forced to accept the physical attentions of anyone who wanted a government-sponsored hole to fuck.
“Just like that.” John kissed Sherlock, “Why mess about? We’ve felt so much for so long, and hid it from one another. Why waste time waiting, and for what? I want everyone in the world to know that I’m yours.”
John was becoming enraged. He looked around wildly for a minute before he spotted a fine clothing store. Without even thinking about what he was doing, he marched right in and demanded service. “What can we help you find today, sir?”
“You don’t have to
“Good.”
“Good boy.” John got off the bed and stripped. The doctor’s cock was already hard, and he paused to add more slick to himself, “I really love your arse, it’s the prettiest one I’ve ever seen.” Without another word, John positioned himself behind Sherlock and pushed right on in, “Oh fuck, you’re so loose and wet.” John sat back on his heels and pulled Sherlock back so that his slave was sitting on his cock, “Bounce, Sherlock. Work your big beautiful arse over my cock, fuck me nice and hard.”
Sherlock raced off to John’s room, thundering up the stairs, nearly ripping the drawer out to ransack it until the clear bottle of personal lubricant was in his hand. Sherlock ran back downstairs, his hard cock bouncing ignominiously in front of him as he made his way back to John.
Morose, Sherlock went to the sofa and curled up into a ball of misery. Mary was gone and he wasn’t sorry, but that lack made him feel guilty. His best friend had lost the love of his life, Sherlock should feel some kind of supportive something about that but he wasn’t able to. He knew that his pointless pining would never be resolved and it was infuriating to be the pitiful half of an unrequited love affair. There was no point in trying anything anymore. Sherlock planned to spend the next few days right there on the sofa, only leaving it’s embrace when he absolutely had to. “You look like one of those swooning princesses in a fairy tale.”
situation. Danny sat on the sofa, one leg on the cushions, and pulled Sherlock down with him, arranging them so that Sherlock was resting against Danny’s narrow chest, their fingers tangled together. “Tell me yours and I’ll tell you mine.”
His duffle was heavy enough to dig into his shoulder, but John didn’t complain. He had no right to.
when it came to Rosie, but he apparently had taken Sherlock’s ongoing penitence as read each time he left his daughter in the detective’s care.
either. Congratulations, you’re a cuckold.”
Sherlock’s
Sit down, mind your manners, and thank John for going through all the effort. He didn’t have to, but he did, and it…just shut up, I want to eat.” Danny smiled at John, “If that’s all right, John. It does smell amazing and I fucking swear Sherlock lives on tea fumes and sullenness because he certainly does not live on food. I am famished! We haven’t had anything since the bite you left us last night. Inhospitable, that’s what he is.”
“Every night,” confessed John, gripping Sherlock’s hips, shifting their bodies so that he was laying on Sherlock’s back, “You’re so gorgeous, so beautiful, so amazing.” John pulled back, applied a bit more spit, and thrust slowly inward, “I’ve never felt someone so tight, it’s perfect.”
The fresh disbelief on Sherlock’s face dissolved into anger, “I see. Your internalised homophobia is still in charge.”
Sherlock was looking at John intently, “What do you recall?”
man is faithful to those he cares about.” Danny managed to make John wince again as he subtly told the soldier off for his doubts about Sherlock’s character while simultaneously questioning John’s. Sherlock was amazed all over again.
“I’m going to always call you that, Biscuit. You’re my sweet decadent treat, and I love you.” Both men laughed as they nibbled their way through Mrs Hudson’s tray until John was drowsing once more. Sherlock left the bed only long enough to set the mostly empty tray on the floor before climbing under the covers with John. Closing his eyes, John drifted off, happy knowing that the person he loved most in the world was safe by his side, watching over him, and waiting for the next step on their shared journey.
“Oh yes, pretty boy, I’m going to fuck you so well.” The soldier was incredible. He was stronger than he seemed, holding Sherlock’s legs up easily, fucking with hard steady strokes. He wasn’t in a hurry, bringing himself to the edge over and over again, teasing Sherlock’s prostate in between riding him so hard that Sherlock’s bed actually moved several inches. They had to add lube twice as the original was rubbed off or became too tacky. Sherlock’s arse was on fire from the friction and he knew he had to fuck this man again. His stamina was remarkable.
“My beautiful John, I love you too. Sleep, my heart, sleep.” They tangled themselves together beneath the duvet, thoughts of cleaning up and chores for tomorrow far from their quickly slumbering minds. Today had been filled with the best kind of magic, and Sherlock was happy.
There was censure in Mycroft’s voice, but John couldn’t blame him. He felt sick inside knowing that Sherlock had suffered for so long and on his behalf.
Sherlock wandered for a long time again, his brain buzzing with thoughts and feelings he couldn’t sort out. He knew Mycroft had someone watching him via CCTV, and he didn’t bother hiding. At least it was proof he wasn’t trying to purchase narcotics, he was just walking and thinking. Sherlock didn’t know how to feel about John, or how to react to John’s perceptions. Instead of another hit, easily obtainable, Sherlock found a grotty and ill-lit pub that served horrid coffee and nursed a cup of it while he struggled to process the day.
. Distantly, Sherlock could see the appeal. Both men represented different styles of power, and both men wielded that power with competence. Neither was afraid of a challenge, and both lived very complicated lives. They were well-matched, so despite his personal heartache, Sherlock silently wished his brother well. “I’m tired.”
“The space community.”
He walked. Sherlock didn’t think about anything at first. He was blank inside for a long time.
what I wasn’t telling you...not...
“Why didn’t you intervene earlier? Why not tell
“Consider it done.”
“It’s how I like it, I like hearing my bedmates moan.” John was particularly good at sex, and just because the woman was renting him her body didn’t mean that John wasn’t going to deliver his lifetime guarantee of at least one screaming orgasm per. He had a reputation to uphold, and even when he was the shittiest boyfriend alive, he was at least a good shag. He hadn’t actually dated in months, and he loved sex too much to give it up entirely. Once a month, John treated himself to some paid fun, hiring someone to ride his cock all night without guilt or obligation being involved. It was very relieving, especially when he lived with temptation 24/7.
Sherlock felt relaxed and expectant. For a moment he thought he’d be overwhelmed with reluctance to share his first times with someone who was a stranger to him.  There was no hesitation, he was eager. Sherlock had always been curious about so many facets of sex but had explored none of his interests. Sherlock perceived that he’d been
Nothing could be further from the truth, fiancée or not, John was now aware that he’d had a hole inside his heart the entire time he’d thought Sherlock was dead. That he was alive and in front of him right now was a gift, and John couldn’t stop himself from responding. The heat in his chest intensified but it didn’t hurt no matter how hot it burned, “I’m here, Sherlock, I’m here for you.” John cradled the needy omega in his arms, covering his face with tender kisses. Sherlock moaned, clinging to John in a way they’d never shared before, but it felt right. John’s inner alpha revelled in the knowledge that his omega wanted him enough to call out his name and a possessive growled rumbled from his lips, “My amazing omega. You’re the most precious thing in the world to me, my darling.” Endearments tumbled out and each one made the omega croon happily as he was gently stroked and petted.
John pleaded, “Please, Sherlock. I have something for you. You see, Lisa and I...”
“You’re the only one I’d ever permit,” Sherlock confessed back, his body arching and stretching. “Please, John, make me come. I want you to come in me. I want you to be mine. I want…”
, John. As I recall, when we first met you told me that this sort of thing was
Sherlock felt amazing, for once. He felt high, completed, and utterly content. Danny’s narrow hips arced back and forth with determination, shifting Sherlock’s body often as they both began to work toward their orgasms. He teased Sherlock’s prostate, never directly pressing against it, but instead flirted with the entire region until Sherlock grabbed him by the hips and yanked him sharply forward.
Sherlock gave a great wrenching cry. He sounded like he was enduring great pain except for the semen that pulsed from the head of his cock. Sherlock was just stroking the end of his shaft now, milking out the last of his own come, but his hole was still clenching and squeezing long after he was done. “Yes, oh yes, yes, yesyesyesyesyes.” John felt his orgasm surge out of him and for a moment, he regretted the need for a condom because having his come inside of his lover would have been brilliant.
closeness endured. Sherlock was a logical man. He wasn’t giving up just because the first series of attempts had failed. He knew he was close to a resolution, all the pieces were there, he just needed to figure out how it all went together and that took time.
He said so out loud.
“John.” There was marvel in Sherlock’s voice, “Are you certain?”
Shake shake shake. “Why in the world would I require
John was stunned to see several tears run down Sherlock’s perfect cheeks, “I suffered so much while I was away, my John, and I did it all for you just like you’re doing
he’d lied to the vendor, saying he’d been sent to fetch everything for his master. It hadn’t been worth the cost he was paying. John didn’t even ask. They returned to Baker Street where John made Sherlock kneel in front of his chair, acting as a table while John had his tea and read for a while. The cup was hot on Sherlock’s back, and once, it tipped over, the tea still hot enough to sting but not burn. It was hours before John’s temper stabilized and he was cruel to Sherlock the entire time.
. You know the path you are starting down so now you have some decisions to make. Are you going to keep letting anger win? Are you going to keep hurting the people you love to satisfy your pride? Are you going to be just like
“You aren’t. I don’t mind.” John didn’t.
“That’s what Mycroft figured, but they only just caught this case before giving it to you. It’s all yours.” Lestrade looked proud and determined.
“It’s okay, I know, you’re probably filled with questions and have no idea where to begin or what to say?”
Sherlock felt moisture prick in his eyes. “You are a remarkable creature, John Watson. You’re right. We’re already friends, already partners. I might have been stuck here with anyone at all, some stranger who annoyed or disgusted me. Instead, I’m standing here and waiting for a handsome brave soldier to save me one more, a man I trust with my life, the only person I find endlessly tolerable. It’s alright, John. Kiss me. Release me. Bind me. Keep me with you for the rest of our days.”
Sherlock was going to be entirely by himself. Mummy and Papa had asked him to come to Christmas at theirs again but after all the upheaval of last year, Sherlock was uncomfortable with the idea of having to go wallow in the memories of
Later, at the flat, John couldn’t recall the words they had exchanged, could barely piece together the timeline of the evening. He vaguely recalled calling Sherlock a thick-headed omega twat, and he cringed with shame for doing so. His late father had called his mother that several times during their many fights and John hated that he’d slipped into that abusive mindset so effortlessly. Mary was smiling, and she looked smug, condescending as she read through John’s old blog. It was then that John recalled her happy comment in the cab, “I like him.” Mary seemed satisfied, “Good breeding hips. I bet his family is just champing at the bit to find a bond-mate for him, I know I would. You can’t let omegas get too old, why, who knows what would happen to the ova if a
Sherlock learned that his own orgasms had indeed been weak and powerless. He cried out without restraint once more as explosive shocks of absolute delight radiated everywhere, his cock jerking on its own as he throbbed out his essence into John’s palm. His thighs shook. His hands reflexively clenched into fists. He seemed to be moaning loudly as well but blood was rushing so hard through his veins that he was deaf from it. Sherlock felt John shuddering beneath him before the doctor pulled out slowly, his breathing ragged and deep. Sherlock was still gasping for air when John pulled him forward and kissed him passionately, “Sherlock.”
“It’s not done yet, John.” Sherlock chivvied John to the sitting room where he lit the pre-laid fire. Flames crackled up right away, and John enjoyed the resinous smell of burning pinewood. Sherlock disappeared into the kitchen but came back a while later bearing a tray, “I’ve just washed up the dishes, but here is the last drink to try tonight, a hot toddy.”
Sherlock looked down at the blond man, enjoying the bite of his fingers as the doctor tried to remove Sherlock’s hand from his waist, “I haven’t been a boy for a very long time but if you allow it, I’ll be your boy tonight? Wouldn’t you like that, doctor? I’m rather fond of a certain type of man, and tonight, I’m in the mood to be someone’s
he was about to participate in.
“Oh. My. God.” John was so embarrassed. “I am sorry. I am so sorry, Sherlock. That was so uncalled for. I am so sorry! I don’t know how you’re ever going to forgive me.”
“It’s not relevant to the Work.” It seemed perfectly logical to Sherlock but hysterically funny to John who couldn’t seem to stop laughing. “I focus on forensics, John. The facts I keep in my head relate only to human social constructs, constructs within which crime is committed. It’s endlessly fascinating, why would I care about anything not relating to crime?”
people,
. Sherlock opened his mouth to tell John how base he was. He made sure to enunciate carefully so that his friend would hear him properly, “Oh my god, John, that’s it, use me, take me any way you’d like.”
.” Danny nudged Sherlock, teasing him.
“We were always together, John, we just know it now.”
Truculently, Sherlock obeyed. Lisa was grinning as if the world was her oyster, and of course it was.
“I mean, no one will be judging you or exacting vengeance or whatever it is that you are concerned about. Most of my family have no idea that we were involved. In fact, I can assure you, my family has no clue that you and I even lived together. Some might be passingly aware that you had a blog and that you wrote about my cases, something they’d all find horrifically boring and mundane. Most of them likely think I’ve been passed out in a drug den somewhere for the last twenty years. Me showing up sober with a boyfriend will be all they’ll be able to talk about. Trust me, my love, it will be well.”
you?”
Pressing his lips together to silence himself, John followed Sherlock out of the ballroom and into the empty foyer, “Yes?”
He’d never thought to stay in any of them again, not after returning to the city after his long hiatus away, and especially after he and John became...nothing, apparently. Sherlock wasn’t someone John loved. Sherlock was just someone John had shagged. The detective knew that
John had no clue how to respond. It was meant to be worn untucked which would work well with the tight fitting and high waisted skirt that John had already purchased, so good enough. The top cost a fair amount, but John didn’t even flinch. He even paid extra to have it wrapped in the nicest box they had available, gently folded into acid-free tissue-paper and bagged to go. It took a day before the flat was clear, but John smuggled it in with all the rest while Sherlock was at the morgue to be shouted at by Molly for making off with her samples again.
. If Sherlock gave the word, Mycroft would dig and dig and dig until every single fact about Lisa had been uncovered. He would use all his connections to subtly destroy her life and the life of John Watson. Sherlock had no feelings about that. He couldn’t ask, not right now. His emotions seemed to be used up, just then, he was empty of everything.
but definitely not projecting any warmth his way.
He’d bungled it, in his view. Not only had it been humiliating to make his request in front of a stranger, but Danny had made it worse by being supportive and helpful. John hadn’t really considered the physical effort it had taken to contain his reactions towards the man. He felt the almost visceral need to remove Danny’s hands from Sherlock’s body, to stand up and make a claim that no one could refute, but he didn’t dare do anything of the sort.
John thought Sherlock was going to faint. He’d never seen the consulting detective affected by emotions before but right that moment, Sherlock reminded John of the fainting heroines in his mother’s old romance books. He was pale, stunned, and very obviously completely surprised.
John didn’t care about the cost. He drizzled even more lube onto his still hard cock and pressed the head against her smaller opening the moment she nodded her assent. It took a hard push but he finally entered her. Closing his eyes, John smiled. This was the sensation he wanted, the feeling he’d been chasing. The tight rings of her sphincters were doing it for him, and soon enough, John found a deep steady rhythm. He had ages and he planned to enjoy every second. He pulled on the pair of nytril gloves that she’d provided and began to finger her vagina, thumbing her clit as he fucked her arse harder. “You don’t get a discount for getting me off,” she gasped, her body beginning to writhe and twist at long last.
things. That day, that afternoon when all of you saw us through the window...Lisa had just negotiated a huge contract regarding distribution and had just given me first commission cheque. She kissed my cheek to congratulate me. I couldn’t believe that you came by the one time she ever kissed me!”
part of what might be. I want all of it, forever. I’ve never been tired or reluctant to be with you, you are my
“Yes, but
“I didn’t get you anything other than the decorations.”
For one lingering moment Sherlock wanted to chase after John, to tell him it was all a lie, to beg him to return but instead, he hardened his heart.
“Yeah, yes, fuck yes. No going slow. I want to be in you. Let me open you up.” Danny wasn’t shy, not a bit. He flipped Sherlock onto his belly, hauled his hips up, and began to use his mouth on Sherlock, shamelessly rooting and burrowing, stabbing Sherlock’s anus with his tongue, kissing desperately until he had pried Sherlock open enough to accept a finger. It felt intrusive and stingy yet the discomfort enhanced the thrill of it all. It was all so new, and normally he would want to catalogue it all. He was tired of thinking so instead, he let himself simply
“It could be everything. Take me there. I want to look around the grounds.”
love with him.” Sherlock felt his throat close with anxiety.
“I love you right back, Sherlock Holmes.” John’s red-rimmed eyes were bright and shining with joy.
“May I enter?” John blinked up at the last person in the world he’d ever expected to see again. “John?”
“You drugged him, Holmes?” Donovan’s voice was filled with accusation. She still hadn’t apologised for her part in Sherlock’s fall, and John made a note to take her to task about that. Someday. Eventually. He sipped, savouring the heat as well as the flavour. “This some kind of sick experiment?”
“It’s so hot. You’re so hot.”
“Red, black, and white.” John was a bit uncomfortable.
“Bloody hell, Sherlock, stop making me wait! I need…fuck, I need you inside me right now.” John’s voice was breathy and urgent, his body rocking backwards to encourage Sherlock to push inside, “Just…please, the head at least, something! I need it.”
Danny explained merely by putting his hand on Sherlock’s knee. John looked as if he were trying to eat his own tongue preventing himself from saying anything about it. His left hand gripped the arm of his chair so hard that Sherlock could hear the fabric almost squeak under the pressure. Perversely, he suddenly felt better about sharing his flat with his lover and the man he loved. There was also no downside to having Rosie around, she was pure joy in a onesie.
“Oh, sit back down, drama queen. He didn’t say there
There was no privacy curtain, merely a fixture coming out from the wall, and a well-screened drain set into the floor. There were generic bottles of shampoo and body-wash on a trolley, as well as a small stack of towels so Sherlock did as he was told. The pressure was intense, and the stinging needles of the water made his skin rosy and mottled pink. Sherlock was disturbed when Mary came in to ogle him, but he had no right to ask her to leave or to not look. She wasn’t discrete about it, leering at him from the door until John came back. She nearly leapt out of the room as he glared at her, shame painting her flushed cheeks an unattractive pink. “Nurse Morstan,” John’s voice was clipped with fury, “There is no medical reason you need to be anywhere in the vicinity of
“I’m significantly less drunk than I was a few minutes ago.” Sherlock felt his head clearing up as the sadness took over. “Fine. I’ll sleep.”
,” screeched Harry. Sherlock gagged one more time as the much-hated name was hurled at him, his entire body tensing into a tight curl.
John gaped at the man kneeling in front of him. Sherlock’s cheeks were pinkening, and John could not mistake the growing tent in the man’s trousers.
. John wasn’t keeping track of Sherlock’s career
“No. Get out. No alphas. Not you, John, especially not you.” Sherlock’s eyes were almost crazed now, “You smell wrong and you’re a liar, just like she is. Who is she, John, do you even know? She stinks of untruth. You don’t care. Would you let yourself know? You don’t care that she isn’t who she says she is, not so long as she has a cunt and breasts, that’s how insecure you are, like being with a male somehow makes you weak. Your beta is a liar, John, but I guess that’s perfect for you, you never listen to the truth anyway. Leave. I said leave. I will
, and even took care of his emails. He solved a few cases for the police, a kind of mental dessert that he treated himself with because solving crime was really better when he was ambulatory and had John by his side. They had loads of free time while Sherlock slowly healed, so John purchased a dual audio jack and with a pair of headphones, introduced Sherlock to online streaming movies. They chuckled their way through several, holding hands, and just being together. Sherlock had never experienced such unfettered happiness.
Sherlock had even cleaned off the table by way of piling everything on the floor instead. The table top gleamed though, so John restricted himself to one fond chuckle, promising himself to set Sherlock’s table lab back up after the dishes were done. They’d barely managed to clear their plates of their portions of their succulent roast meal when an urgent tapping came from the door downstairs, “Boys, it’s that nice Detective Inspector!”
roll weekly.”
Sherlock regarded it for a moment, “Sherlock.” They shook. Danny’s grip was firm, assured, but also warm, his fingers thinner than Sherlock’s but then, Danny seemed to be a narrow wisp, even compared to the ethereally willowy detective. He smelled nice. He smelled…comfortable, safe, musky and appealing. Sherlock found himself admiring the long clean lines of his companion, and a voice whispered in the back of his mind that
times before giving in to his own urges, but this wasn’t a date. It was a random hook-up and they both knew it. By the time he made it through her flat door, he was already laced into his shoes and buttoning up his coat.
. Danny broke down completely, and Sherlock wanted nothing more than to hold him for as long as necessary while he wept his grief out.
Angelo appeared, producing a well-lit candle which he flamboyantly placed in the centre of the table. “Christmas Special tonight, gentlemen, I bring you a special platter, no arguing.” Angelo bustled happily away, taking away John’s already empty plate and bringing a large basket of cheesy garlic toast for them to share while their meal was being prepared.
and “It’s
to say is, you be inside me.”
“Sherlock, Lisa is a publisher, a rather good one.”
“How did it go?” She spoke gently, “John?”
Sherlock wasn’t the only one with tears on his face. “John,” began Sherlock. Hope began to bloom once again, and it was exhilarating.
and I loved you still. That’s all that there is of me, now, my love for you.”
John bent himself lower. Omega did this sometimes. It was instinctual for them, a way of letting their alpha know that they had been claimed, of letting others know who had claimed them utterly. “You
Mary looked furious, “We are
Sherlock swallowed hard but said nothing. He burned inside to verbally castigate the little man by his side, but it was imprudent to antagonise his master before he had a better idea of what he was dealing with. Isolated from others in the pen didn’t prevent him from hearing the horror stories, only a few of which could be dismissed as urban legend. His new master could be any kind of person, it was too early to tell with certainty, and Sherlock didn’t dare risk missing a vital clue. So far, he didn’t seem so bad, but he could be part of a group of people, or better at hiding his true nature in public, or
,” mocked Sherlock, “Stop trying to paint yourself as a master villain instead of a bureaucrat and take me to John!”
John Watson’s
Sherlock gasped for air, “John.”
Doctor Watson was
John was perfectly within his rights to name Sherlock anything he wanted, or number him, or to never treat him as anything more than a device to be used, but instead, John reached down and shook Sherlock’s hand, “Pleased to meet you, Sherlock.”
John felt lower than dirt as he crept out of the flat, his chest filled with cold emptiness. He told himself that he was doing the right thing but saying so didn’t make him feel better. The city looked grey and flat, all the colour faded. Anthea was there, and she looked so blank that John couldn’t have felt more judged if she’d spat on him. She handed back his mobile, making sure not to touch him, as if he were contaminated or filthy. John felt like the embodiment of dishonour, but he walked away all the same.
Mary delivered their child and almost immediately ran away. John chased after her with Sherlock, abandoning his new-born with Molly Hooper who knew nothing about children but who also was incapable of saying no to either of them. Things got messier and messier. Villains seemed to grow on trees and all of them had a vendetta against Sherlock, throwing John into the mix just because they could. The worst of it was Sherlock, his descent back into drugs, the sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of Magnusson, the way he nearly died via Culverton, the way John himself beat Sherlock nearly unconscious. Sherlock had almost lost an eye, and John had certainly lost the respect of everyone they knew. He had been out of control.
A deep concerned voice was calmly speaking in his ear and a large hand was rubbing his back soothingly. John found himself calming down enough to catch his breath properly, and when he was sure he wasn’t going to cough into his date’s face, he looked up, “Just water, Sherlock, went down wrong.”
“Where is John? I don’t give a fuck about your assurances and promises to others. All I want is John, and if I find that you knew how to get him back for me yet failed to do so, then I will do everything I can think of to make you
“My dearest Sherlock, we have so much catching up to do. Whilst your soldier goes to refresh himself, lets you and I enjoy some
“I’m not interested back. I have very particular tastes, and while Mary is a perfectly agreeable person in all respects, as well as a highly competent nurse, she does not meet the requirements I have in mind. You do.” John’s reply was short, clipped, and distracted as he continued his comprehensive exam.
John cleared his throat and managed to not look at Danny, who had his arm around Sherlock’s shoulder. “Rosie and I need a place to stay for a few weeks. I’m going to use the money from the house to get a smaller place somewhere else, but I need to look around. I didn’t expect this place to go so quickly, but apparently, this area is in demand. I only have to decide on a bid, but after, I need someplace to call home in the interim while I view properties suitable to raise Rosie in.”
“I want to be yours, John, properly.” John looked serious now, gazing at Sherlock’s face, obviously searching for answers regarding his request.
“I know Mrs Hudson, you’re a landlady, not a housekeeper.” Danny effortlessly charmed her, kissing her head as if he’d known her for years, “Don’t worry, I like to cook, and if I’m going to be with this one, I think we’re going to need all the energy we can get.” Mrs Hudson looked even prouder, especially when Sherlock blushed all over again. Danny looked triumphant.
Sherlock looked pleased, “Well, if you can manage another meal, perhaps we can find something in this ridiculous largess that appeals to you.”
put me through, do you? No. I was traumatised when he faked his death in front of me, my wife is dead because of him, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg, so don’t even try to make me feel like a heel for having to find someone else for what I can’t get at home anymore. Who are you to talk to me like this? You’re just some street-rat junkie drawn to another junkie. Tell me, Danny, if that’s your real name, why Sherlock?” Sherlock’s heart broke all over again when John called them
“No need, Mrs Hudson. I am leaving for a time. John will remain, and he may have a female companion joining him. Please, do me a favour and don’t let me know what is happening. I don’t want those images in my head. I’ll have Mycroft’s PA contact you regarding my expenses and possessions.”
A different person began to speak into a recording device, “Both subjects have been cleared for the next phase of testing. Initiate 5646 stimulus.” The lights dimmed as everyone left the area just as a screen of imagery was projected onto the far wall by an inset device in the ceiling. John managed to get to his knees, his eyes glued to the recognisable scene unfolding in front of him.
“You are the true drama queen of our family!
, he still needed to prove that being in the hospital was no longer necessary. In short, Sherlock had to be able to use the loo for sitting down reasons without serious discomfort. He was confident he could do it. His arse was still very sore, but a good kind of sore, an “it’s mostly healed but still very tender” kind of sore. Anything beyond that would keep him where he was.
Sherlock looked at her, his gaze hard and unforgiving.
“No, why? No, not at all. You did what you have every right to do, well, maybe not the drugs, but you are your own person Sherlock. If that’s how you coped, then I have no grounds to try and lob morals at you after the fact. I will never be in a place to do that, not after everything I did.” John knew he would never ask Sherlock to be exclusive with him, he didn’t have the right to ask that, not after cheating on the most perfect human being on the planet for no good reason. “Can we spoon?”
“Thank you.” Sherlock accepted the cup of steaming hot tea as well as the comforting shoulder squeeze that John provided. Sherlock sipped his tea and wondered what would happen if he told John his secret.
or did you do
won’t have to beat him to a pulp to get him to understand.”
They went shopping, and Sherlock made note that John filled their cart with food items that Sherlock liked the best but bypassed the many items that John normally preferred. Sherlock backtracked through the store and put them in. John didn’t protest, it wasn’t his choice. They checked out together, and for once, John had no trouble with the chip and pin machine, smoothly concluding his transaction.
With great reluctance, John had agreed. It worked out beautifully, even though it made him feel adrift as well as sad sometimes. He was able to see his child as often as he wanted or leave for days, or even weeks, if it was necessary. It often was. His PTSD was worse than ever. He was back to seeing Ella Thompson on a regular basis for therapy. His job at the clinic had ended but an on-call position at Bart’s had opened up. His life was unstable but in time it would get better but it wasn’t fair to put any of that darkness on his daughter, not when there was a better alternative. With Clara and Harry, she was healthy, happy, full of smiles, and so incredibly loved that John was able to let her go with only a minimum of misgivings.
John had not felt this low in a while. When his tea was done, John reluctantly left the café and began limping his way back to the flat, taking a circuitous route to use up as much time as possible. When he finally arrived, Sherlock wasn’t home. Dejected, John went to his room and sat on his bed. It was fate, he decided. The laws of the country wouldn’t allow him to marry Sherlock, they couldn’t bond, they couldn’t have a CP, and Sherlock had left him behind yet again. John’s chest was itching, like something inside was trying to claw its way out. He felt out of focus and unbalanced. He lay back and curled up tight into a ball of misery.
John was beginning to feel overwhelmed again. The last few hours had been a kind of bliss, but he wasn’t certain he could take any more. He still felt conflicted and worried that Sherlock would ask for more than he was prepared to give. He didn’t need to worry. Sherlock did kiss him but on the forehead. John’s eyes closed as he felt the warmth of it, and he shivered. Sherlock wrapped his long arms around John’s shoulders and squeezed him for a moment, “I’ll call tomorrow if that’s okay with you?”
, no matter how tempted he was to do more.
“No,” he lied. Sherlock’s heart was in his throat and he was seconds away from crying.
John’s face was a picture of shock and confusion. Sherlock instantly regretted bringing Mary into the conversation right at the worst possible moment but he needed John to know that he didn’t mind being a stand-in for her. If that’s what he could get of John, then that was better than he could have wished for. It really hurt when John said with certainty, “That’s never going to happen,” in a voice that was completely unwavering. The twang from Sherlock’s heart was painful enough to make him twitch but instead of letting him loose to explain how his love for his late wife was eternal John said, “Mary was my replacement for
“It’s nothing to concern yourself over,” John tried to stand taller, feeling far too exposed. He wasn’t going to admit that Sherlock was right. He wasn’t going to say out loud what he’d been refusing to admit this entire time. John
Sherlock’s voice seemed very far away and was a bit more concerned than John could make sense of. The doctor opened his eyes. The world was out of focus, but a good scrub with the heels of his hands cleared most of the sleep away. John now saw that Sherlock was sitting cross-legged on the bed, his brows knitted with worry, “What’s wrong?”
He had no idea how to make things right between them, but there was no limit to what he’d try, he knew it. John finally understood that what he needed had been right in front of him this entire time. He needed Sherlock Holmes, and Sherlock needed him. He couldn’t allow himself to mull this over further, John headed right over to 221 B Baker Street.
“Your laptop then, an email will do, and my laptop is going through its maintenance cycle.” Sherlock kept watching John, but the doctor’s face remained the same, “John?”
John looked shocked, “Wait now, that’s not what I’m saying.”
. He wasn’t sure how he felt about that, “The basement flat is mouldy, not fit for habitation, especially by a toddler, you know this.”
“Yes,
David turned, and he had a knife out, “Payday for us, Aggie. Who d’ya want to do first?” He was grinning and ignoring Sherlock entirely, his smirk aimed directly at John.
John wondered now about Sherlock’s sanity.
John was frozen where he sat, shock, disbelief, incredulity, relief, fury, dismay, and grief tying itself in a free-for-all of emotions that paralyzed him. Something in his chest flooded with painful heat and it was like something fused itself to his heart and it was paralysing. When he finally did move, it was to lunge toward the man he’d thought dead and gone years ago, his fist flying out as he knocked him to his back against the highly polished tiles of
John looked even more surprised because Danny
Without intending, John found himself inside a janitorial closet ten minutes later, giving her a good seeing to even as his brain reminded him that he wasn’t doing this kind of thing any longer. John couldn’t seem to resist his impulse to fuck anyone who was interested and temporarily available, but the moment he came, he loathed himself. She was happy and left him standing there with his pants around his knees and regret bubbling up in a bilious wave. Yanking them up, John made up his mind and practically ran back to Baker Street and Sherlock. He had never regretted an impulse as much after seeing what he saw when he got there.
for a penis so large. She was the one with the size kink, or so she had said. John had never been more miserable to be outside minimum standards.
John had never had a sexual experience like this in his entire life. No one had ever taken him to bed and been lost to desire the way Sherlock was. The man was wild with lust, pounding into John’s body with intensity. John worked his own hips a bit, just enough to rub his little cock against Sherlock’s belly and it was enough to set the man off.
you insinuate that I am taking advantage of my alpha.” Sherlock sounded aggrieved and hard done by.
to the Captain, excellent choice sir, we're pleased to finally be of service to you.” The auctioneer brusquely gestured to someone to deal with the transaction on the spot. The stranger paid cash, and without further ado, Sherlock was dragged off the stage, stripped of his sheet, and leg-cuffed. The small blond man scowled at the guard until he had draped the sheet back around Sherlock's shoulders instead of leaving him naked as he clearly planned. Sherlock was justifiably distressed, but not so much so that he didn't notice that the guard seemed wary and almost afraid of the Captain.
“What? Since when?”
evidence relating to Baskerville aside from the H.O.U.N.D.S case?” There was a pointed and lengthy silence. Sherlock’s lips pressed together in a thin line before he spoke again, “Mycroft, would you care to explain to Danny and I both why you are concealing relevant information from us?” More silence. “Mycroft, you have exactly fifteen seconds before I end this call, use the CCTV access you gave me to spy on your superiors before
Sherlock had thought a great deal on the many ways he’d gone so wrong, devoting his entire mentality upon the task.
John had no idea how the universe had managed to spin itself in such a way that he was getting Sherlock back without a fight. It was overwhelming. He wasn’t certain that he was processing everything correctly, that Sherlock wasn’t taking him to dinner as a prelude to the restart of their previously tumultuous lives together. Sherlock took him by the hand once again and gently escorted him down the street.
When it was nearly seven in the evening, John was just taking out the scones he had baked for Rosie when they showed up. “That’s it, I’m breaking up with you and going out with
“We’re having sex too,” he interjected.
Lestrade handed Sherlock his mobile and let the sleuth examine all the photos that Anderson had forwarded. The forensics technicians’ skills had vastly improved in the last few years, and while there was still plenty of room for further improvement, there were still many good details in each shot. Sherlock silently approved, and rewarded Anderson by not complaining about the few mistakes he had noted. “Can we see the site?”
John felt so stupid. He never should have hesitated in choosing Sherlock over Mary. “I should have come home the day you showed up. I should have told you then what everyone around me already knew, even Mary, fuck,
John was pressing carefully, stopping when Sherlock gasped sharply, “Prostate.”
She pronounced it elegantly.
. Instead, he distracted himself with work, copying his research onto his portable hard-drive. He then paused, then copied all of John’s stories as well before he gave the laptop back, “Everything is taken care of,” was all he said. John’s face was a mess of emotions. He looked grateful, humiliated, and downcast, all at the same time. “I’ve spent years assembling that data, it’s worth everything.” Sherlock saw his assurance only made John feel worse, but he didn’t know what else to say. All he could do was hope John didn’t feel compelled to sell it again.
was indeed gay and that an attractive man was less than two inches away from his body. It wasn’t unpleasant, not in the least.
John made it back to Sherlock’s room four hours after he’d departed, on the dot. Sherlock looked relieved to see him, and without pause, John went over and kissed his omega hello. Being away for a few hours had refreshed them both. When their kiss deepened, Mycroft made a gagging noise and rose to his feet, “Well, this has been charming, Sherlock. Please consider what we’ve discussed.”
“Well, you’ve always been a man out of time. Perhaps it’s a trend we can start.”
Later that evening, after cleaning himself up in the showers at the hospital, John arrived at the address with only a few minutes to spare. The suit fit him better than anything he’d ever worn, and silently, to himself, John admitted that he looked rather dapper. He was glad of it because the restaurant was intimidating. It was incredibly posh, so he approached the concierge uncertainly, “Doctor John Watson.”
“Thanks a lot, Harry.” John felt worse with every moment of clarity he endured. He was such a prick, such a self-destructive, hateful, abusive, selfish, selfish, selfish prick.
He fell further still. John started sleeping around with anyone he could find whenever Sherlock was away, and the night that he brought a strange man back to the flat, Sherlock had been unexpectedly home and had angrily thrown them both into the street.
John himself made no protest because he didn’t think to. It was a problem distant from him and therefore nothing to concern himself about. The alpha was once again caught in between the bizarre submissive headspace he’d put himself in and his normal persona. Sherlock was shamelessly exploiting it to get his own way all day long, but John didn’t protest even once. He fetched and carried, changed the channel on the telly on command, hand fed and sponge-washed Sherlock whenever he wanted it, spending his every moment doing nothing but catering to Sherlock’s slightest wish.
He’d made Sherlock breakfast the next morning, held his hand when they watched movies, cuddled with him. They continued to do the Work, better than ever, in fact. John had a two-day-a-week job at a new clinic, going in on Mondays and Tuesdays, and spending all his other days with Sherlock.
“A printed collection of your cases; an expanded rewrite of all of John’s blog posts. He’s had his notes transcribed and has turned the blog into a volume of your successes.” Sherlock didn’t know what to say. Stricken, he slowly opened the book and turned the pages. John had included photographs. He recognized many of them, they’d been posted online. Their cases were there, all carefully arranged in chronological order. Sherlock’s eyes grew blurry and they stung in a new kind of way, “He’s been working on this for some time, apparently.”
“You’re too charming for your own good, neither Alex or myself have any way of saying no,” Sherlock teased gently before he grew serious. “I had always thought it might be with John, you know, first times and all that rubbish. I hadn’t thought about it frequently but when I did, I could only ever imagine it was with him, is that pathetic?”
“Good.”
store food on the bottom rack of the refrigerator.”
Danny stopped smoking and stared at Sherlock, “What makes you think I need a place to stay?” He remained in the same position, not standing up, or in any way becoming aggressive or threatening.
enough?” John broke down and cried because she was right. He hadn’t actually slept around on Mary, but he would have, he knew it. He should have respected his wife and himself by staying faithful. Harry shook her head, her voice filled with frustration, “You got married and you knew he loved you. Why, John? You weren’t even
“Sherlock,” Danny overrode the elder brother, “Don’t lose your head over this. Stay calm. If it’s not John, then we could be getting ourselves stuck inside a slow-moving problem. Take a deep breath.”
. In his mind, it was inextricably linked with pain and humiliation. Logically, Sherlock knew that
John looked at the scar on his friend’s neck. Sherlock’s bonding gland had been ruthlessly savaged, of course, there would be no second bond for the omega. For some reason, that thought made something howl with grief inside of the soldier. John realized after that he hadn’t even thought of Mary before he made his rapid decision, “Of course.” Now that he had agreed to share Sherlock’s heat with him, he guiltily recalled that he had a fiancée at home. “Er, I have to call…”
kisses. I can break a simple magic bond with one person’s kiss for a single berry, but six, six will bind me to you forever.”
Sherlock had to remain in his odd bed for two more weeks before he would finally be able to test his ability to walk about. He’d spent the first week flinching hard whenever John moved even slightly, mentally chastising himself for making the doctor feel bad over his own imagination-based fears and working hard every hour he was awake to overcome the unanticipated conditioning from his protracted nightmare. Sherlock couldn’t wait to be home and shed of this phase of his recovery. He understood deeply why he’d been kept in a medical coma for most of his initial recuperation. There was no way he’d have the patience to just lay there for months, especially when John wasn’t able to relax around him. The decision his medical team had made saved them all extra weeks of further rehabilitation because Sherlock was positive he would have tried to escape more than once and likely hurt himself even more in the process. This way, he was well on his way to recovery with only mild chances of setting himself back via imprudent choices.
, in remembrance of the afternoon John had used all his remaining surgical skill to resuscitate one of Sherlock’s favourite novelty socks. They’d been a gag gift from Lestrade, just silly socks that glowed in the dark but were worn at the heel. John had sat at the kitchen table sewing tiny perfect stitches in matching threads until it was whole again. Sherlock also hung onto memorabilia like a raven, hiding glittery little proofs of his life amongst the detritus of their front room.
“Then why was he so scared to see me?” John sounded tearful, “You saw it yourself. He went from being nearly asleep to almost hyperventilating in mere seconds. He just had a heart attack! He died on the table earlier today! He can’t take a shock, I can’t be here if I’m hurting him.”
“How old are you?” Doc, or whatever his name was didn’t seem willing to move until his question was answered.
He’d thought so but exactly what that entitled him to seemed to add up to precisely nothing except still being John’s friend, at the very least.
They rarely did it this way but John eagerly rolled to his belly and lifted his hips invitingly. Sherlock took him up on it, ravenous for more. Somewhere they’d graduated from tender healing and slipped into feral need. Sherlock groaned at the feast laid out beneath him and mouthed his way down John’s spine until he reached those sweet pert handfuls of arse that tempted him so ardently. With reverence that he showed nowhere else, Sherlock used his long fingers to push them apart enough to reveal John’s most intimate entrance. Exposed, Sherlock couldn’t stop himself from leaning over and using his tongue to wring moan after moan from his lover.
Sherlock proceeded to spend the rest of the drive tearing the man apart without mercy. By the time they arrived at their destination, the man was almost in tears. Sherlock threatened to inform the man’s spouse about his infidelities and in exchange for his silence, the alpha waived their cab fare. “Wow, you completely took him apart.” John was filled with amazement.
John had clearly been planning to end the visit now that his request had been made and accepted but now, he hesitated, “Sure, but I can do it, it’s not a bother.” Waving him off, Danny strode off to the kitchen and clattered around, clearly not planning on coming right back. Sherlock sat there in uncomfortable silence until John spoke once more, “He seems good for you. You look…good.”
“I’ve already had a firm begin the paperwork, I don’t want to live here anymore. I need a fresh start.”
. He’d lost track right after they ran out of eggnog early on in the game. Their conversation had become intense, daring, revealing. He couldn’t recall clearly what they’d been talking about but it had seemed important at the time. They’d forgotten about playing during that conversation, especially after John’s hands began to wander, and Sherlock failed to make the slightest effort to stop them.
emotional
to see to my more intimate needs. Excuse me, John, I have to go back to making Danny feel at home.” Sherlock left a very silent John at Mrs Hudson’s door, forcing himself to keep his eyes forward as he walked away from the love of his life.
Sherlock sent back. Telling his brother was nearly as mortifying as having it happen. There was no point in trying to hide it. Mycroft would find out anyway if he didn’t know already, and Mycroft would be one of the few to understand the scope of this single act, “
It was the worst possible luck that manifested one sunny afternoon. Sherlock was walking with Lestrade, Donovan, and Anderson, all of them rapidly going over the facts of their latest matter when they passed a partially full restaurant. Everyone had divided up the job of verifying Sherlock’s theories, and they were discussing where to go from there. There in the window seat sat John, and across the table from him was Lisa. She was smiling broadly and clutching John’s hand, her painted nails vivid as she gripped his fingers in hers. She patted it affectionately before withdrawing it and standing up to give John a very lingering kiss on his cheek. Just as she sat down, John looked up, his mouth dropping open as everyone he used to work with glared at him before closing up as a group and herding Sherlock away. Anderson sent John a two-fingered farewell that Donovan matched, all of them closing ranks about the silent and pale detective in front of them. The unstable shifting-ground feeling had returned in force, and all Sherlock could say was, “I’m...just...good-day.”
John fumbled before finding Sherlock’s cock and fisting it, “John!” It was too much. The tight feeling he was experiencing was now body wide and the stimulation John was providing was almost more than Sherlock could deal with. “Yes.” John was thrusting fast and steady now, not trying to stimulate Sherlock more, but then, he didn’t need to. Sherlock felt his entire body tighten, squeezing John tighter than ever. Sherlock heard John groan and felt his penis begin to contract. The first bloom of warmth inside him was all he needed to complete his own journey.
“Well, from the bits of last night I recall, you told me that you’ve been in love with me for years now, right before I told you I felt the same way.” Sherlock blinked down at John.
Well, quite a few people actually. DI Lestrade exuded a kind of weary fatherliness, providing interesting cases and access to crime scenes. He’d helped Sherlock sort his life out, gave him goals to achieve and boundaries to perform within. In short, the ever miss-named DI acted as a one-man cheer squad and life-coach combined, never running out of patience or forgiveness for Sherlock’s many slips and errors. Greg taught Sherlock how to work with others, not well, but as best as he could manage considering the various barriers between Sherlock and the rest of the world. Lestrade had never made Sherlock feel guilty for being so brilliant, nor awkward for being so strange. Instead, the DI had enabled Sherlock to explore his macabre interests in a beneficial manner. In return, Sherlock worked with Lestrade almost exclusively, attending to crimes with other DI’s
The ice in his chest grew larger as his mind spun around and around, his depressive thoughts flourishing in the chaos that was his instability.
about Mary, why did you propose? You kept it a big fucking secret, too. You know, mum is still sore at you for not even inviting us? What was going through your head? For fucks’ sakes,
Sherlock had never experienced such unabashed coddling, not since he’d been a new-born infant, and even then, not for long. Mummy wasn’t one for extended physical contact, handing Sherlock and Mycroft off to their
“I’ve already admitted that it was my own doing, John. I want to change that, right now.” Sherlock stood up, “John Watson, I would very much like to have sex with you, as soon as possible.” Sherlock eyed him up and down, “If you can manage, that is, I know you’re not a young man anymore.”
“Yes, John,
“John, no, no there’s no rush but the longer we wait…” Sherlock cut him off as he tried to explain his fears, “The longer we wait, the more time those bad memories have to settle in. I don’t want them to become permanent. I want them to do what dreams often do, just dissipate.”
“Comforting? You’ve been cheating on me with your ex the entire time we’ve been together. Has our relationship been so awful that you needed to be fucked by someone else on a regular basis? It makes me sick because I’ve been having David’s sloppy seconds for months now!”
Danny’s jaw dropped, and Sherlock found himself looking at that round ‘O’ with interest. Danny’s lips were full, like his own, and for a moment, Sherlock felt the call of urges he’d thought he’d long suppressed. “Do you know me, Sherlock Holmes? Do you know what’s happened?”
“Thanks for letting me take them off of you.” They giggled weakly before drifting off, too tired and boneless to bother trying to clean up or even cover up. Those were concerns for a later time. Both men fell asleep side-by-side, covered in come, and happier for it. As far as either was concerned, this was already the best holiday they’d ever had.
He recalled how Mary had urged him to consider moving in with her, of getting serious.
we really
“Certainly, sir, I’m positive we can find something appropriate. Do you know their size?” John did all the laundry at 221 B Baker street and had many times examined the tags inside Sherlock’s clothes to determine if they needed to be sent out or if he could just wash them in their communal laundry room. His measurements were on the labels and John had long since memorized them. He told her. She made a quick note before asking him a nearly impossible to answer question, “What shade of red?”
Now Sherlock recalled everything and his smile grew bigger. John loved him and he loved John, even if John didn’t know that yet. Sherlock decided how he wanted to let him find out. He moved carefully, tugging down his pyjama bottoms, exposing his flesh. John was still deeply asleep so Sherlock momentarily considered the ethics of his next step before mentally shrugging and deciding that John would likely explain to him later if what he’d done was good or
Sherlock stared at his lover, “You are deliberately antagonizing him.”
, so he didn’t see how she had room to poke fun about the person she knew full well he’d mourned endlessly. John’s already frayed patience snapped. “You can ask Doctor Sarah Sawyer about that one. That happened on our first date, and fine, I’ll go see him tomorrow.”
Challenging your flatmate to eggnog shots followed by matching shots of straight rum probably hadn’t been a good idea, especially since they’d spent the entire evening celebrating Christmas with all their friends. Spirits had been liberally offered, and now that everyone was gone, only John and Sherlock remained to continue with the party. They’d been playing some kind of card game. Sherlock didn’t recall all the rules.
Harry was kind enough not to point it out, simply asking, “What case?”
. The nightmare was very real to me for a very long time, and it’s just…” he didn’t know how to explain himself. He
“I’ll hurt you too, and make you angry, and probably a thousand other negative things. It doesn’t matter, John.  We can begin with a clean slate, just...a brand-new beginning, and nothing from our toxic horrible past. I need this. I need
They made their way home, taking the cab that Sherlock had arranged for their special night out. John was regretting every bite of food he had eaten because it was making his stomach churn. Sherlock tried to lay his hand on John’s thigh but instead managed to startle the lost-in-thought soldier so much that John nearly catapulted himself off the bench seat.
John looked utterly surprised that Danny was defending him. “We can help you move, if you require assistance, John.” Danny was completely sincere, leaning into his offer with an open and friendly expression, “Call us day or night, we’re here for you.”
The good doctor seemed entranced by the way his fingers looked pushing in and out of Sherlock’s bottom. He kept doing it, drizzling on a drop or two more of lubricant that he’d gotten from who knows where repeatedly until Sherlock was sopping wet. “I need your cock, John. I want to know what it feels like to have you inside me.”
Sherlock bit back a cry when John pushed something with a blunt point against his very slick hole, “John!”
There should have been no question to whom John belonged. Sherlock was deeply flawed, certainly, but so was John. They made each other better, they needed one another to be better. Mary, or whatever her name was, wasn’t going to make less of what they had become by winning this fight, not if John had anything to do with it.
“Exercising for your health?” Sherlock didn’t know why he was engaging in conversation. He certainly wasn’t interested in talking to the dad on his other side, nor the woman who sat on the far end of their bench. He wasn’t really touching them either but didn’t mind the warm press of this man’s body against his, “Or business?”
John’s clever finger found Sherlock’s prostate and stroked it.
Cooking was unnecessary because Mrs Hudson came up the second the bedroom door opened. She bore a large over-filled tray of fresh scones, hot cereal, fresh fruits, and clotted cream, “Yoo hoo, boys!” Even Danny blushed when she smiled at them proudly, “You two both need feeding up. I won’t always be doing this, you know.”
He felt adrift, even after he looked at the date on the laptop. It meant nothing to him since he had no idea when he’d had his arse handed to him by Harry.
John went home with Rosie for the first time in a week.
Sherlock was a bit worried, a bit, but not about food. He was worried that he’d make a complete mess of
a freak, but that only means you can’t be judged on the same scale as anyone else, you’re so much more than we can be.”
. Sherlock was reckless, but he wasn't entirely a fool, he was in a different sort of danger now than what he'd been in while at the facility, he needed to bide his time and make observations before he could make any kind of plans.
He listened intently and heard the wet slap of John’s fist on his cock, “How am I going to get through tonight without fucking that pretty mouth? God, I’ve wanted your lips on my cock for years.” John was trying to stay quiet beneath the spray and obviously didn’t realise that his nosey flatmate could hear him clearly. Sherlock wondered if John could hear how hard he was stroking himself, and it made a surge of exhilaration rush through him. John wanted him...
Sherlock had been truculent at first but as Danny spoke, his dismissive arrogance dissipated, “Yes, Danny, for John.” Sherlock was determined. He’d been close to unravelling something with Danny’s case, he knew it, and he was very nearly certain that John’s abduction had been triggered by their trip. Guilt ate at him.
Sherlock glanced at Danny for a long moment before returning his gaze to where Rosie was playing, “Your clothes are of high quality, rugged enough to endure several nights of sleeping in alleys and abandoned buildings, even during this cold season, but the hem of your trousers show at least three different mud-stains, and your shoes have been brushed off but have been worn almost constantly for at least three days. You don’t have anywhere safe to take them off, so you keep them on. Your messenger bag holds books, some personal essentials, and a spare vest as well as pants, you’ve been on the run or in hiding for some time. You seem healthy enough, but there are plenty of church groups and homeless shelters that will let you wash up before they feed you, and you don’t eat much anyway, do you?”
at puzzles.” Sherlock and Danny were standing nearly nose to nose now. Something was crackling in the air between them, and Sherlock felt his transport responding to the stranger’s scent, unwashed, unshaved, unfamiliar, and oh so appealing, “Let me help you.”
“Pull off the duvet for a minute.” Sherlock found his coverlet thrown back and was very startled to feel a very warm damp cloth being applied to his backside. After he was clean of lubricant, John even patted his bum dry with another towel. The doctor left again but came back only a minute later with two tall glasses of water, “Come on, we’ll each have one.”
, he always has been. He wants to protect you. You know how seriously he takes that job, right Billy? He is
“What about my arse?” John giggled tearily and Sherlock adored every second of it. His entire body ached, and he was so happy because of John’s ridiculous laughter and how that John was so relieved to be joking around with him that he was almost crying. “Is it still beautiful?”
“Yeah? So can Mrs Hudson. One pinch of poison in her scones and I’d be a goner. I’m not afraid.” Danny smirked, “Look, you beautiful, ridiculous man,
John was kneeling beside him on the kitchen floor as Sherlock gasped for air as his body relaxed the moment John had him in his arms.
Now Mycroft spoke, “You can’t.
instead of a genetic imperative.  Alphas and omegas were literally designed to cleave together, to create a perfect union with one another, their physical beings adjusting naturally until they were in harmony. Betas could wed and devote their lives to one another, but it wasn’t the same as a bond. John was willing to have a beta-marriage with her. Their life together was pleasant though Mary was far more social than he was, going out two or three nights a week with her mates and leaving John at home. He preferred it that way. Since he’d come back from the war, and especially since he’d thought he’d lost Sherlock forever, John had always preferred to keep his social life as uneventful as possible.
. One horrified glance around was all it took to confirm the truth of it. Even Lestrade was trying not to grin, his shoulders shaking with repressed mirth. John’s anger was visibly fading, and a chagrined expression was spreading but it was far too late.
Sherlock stood still, shocked.
“Baby?” John stared at Mary, shocked even more. How out of it had he been all these months? Of course, the perfume. She wore it to mask not only her affair but her state of being. “You’re pregnant? Who’s is it?”
“Tea would be lovely.” John lay there feeling crusty and out-of-sorts. His head ached a bit and he desperately wanted a shower but felt too weak to get up without building up toward it. “I don’t think I can manage food quite yet.”
Rosie deserved so much better for a father than an emotionally crippled John Watson, maybe, if she’d had a mother too, it wouldn’t be so horrid. John was further torn with the memories of his late wife. Again, on one side was the laughing smiling face of the woman he loved, Mary Morstan, and on the other, the cold precise visage of the assassin she truly was, her mysterious life encapsulated in an electronic device and four letters. Mary had told John that she loved him, and maybe she believed it, but he couldn’t. She lied to him so much that everything she said to him just created more questions, and she never answered any of them satisfactorily. John had doubts and had
Now, there was Mary to consider as well. He’d been with her for nearly a year, probably not long enough to be
“Does this mean actually forever or do you still have to go back to wherever in a year?”
“Asleep, all right.” Sherlock tried to stand up, but John pushed his face back down and rubbed two fingers along the crease of his arse, “Naughty, John! You are dreaming. Wake up, Watson.”
More silence though his annoyance grew. Instead of giving her an earful, John poured out cups of hot fragrant liquid until everyone had one. “Join us,” said Sherlock softly, “Answer her, John.”
, John Hamish Watson, are what makes me happiest. You are the person that I miss the most when I’m away, and the one person I am always eager to see one more time, and who makes me safe.” Sherlock kissed John’s mouth tenderly, “I know this is a terrible risk to take, but after all this time, and after everything we’ve lived through…John. I need you to know how loved you are, how cherished you are, and how grateful I am that you share my life with me. I can take care of you the way a normal omega would, if you actually want that, but I want you. I want so much, John, but I only want what I want if you want it too, and just you.”
“Why do you need to go out and…”
Still.
, and my most recent information states that he is still incarcerated, though he has been given medical treatment.”
John just gave her his mobile. He was too drunk to operate it. With a frustrated sigh, Harry managed to find the number and called them, “Her dad’s ill. I’m her aunt, Harriet Miller, we met during orientation? John and I are coming by cab to pick her up.” John was grateful that he’d had the foresight to register Harry’s information with the centre, especially since she’d kept her ex-wife’s surname. The people at Rosie’s school took their jobs very seriously and didn’t just hand children over to any old person claiming to be a relation. Mycroft had vetted the place, and it made John feel useless all over again because he couldn’t even do
John understood what Sherlock had felt like when he had seen Mary for the first time. The detective hadn’t known about her. It was obvious Sherlock hadn’t a clue that John moved on from his old life and was at the cusp of beginning a brand-new life, one that made no room for the late Sherlock Holmes to be in it. John spirits plunged downward. He was drowning in a thousand recollections of Sherlock’s retrospectively obvious personal pain
John laughed, and it was a bit wet since the good doctor seemed to be a bit overwhelmed with sentiment at the moment. Sherlock decided he liked how John looked right then, damp and wobbly, but so very pleased. “Me either, Sherlock. I just…I want you.”
Sherlock yawned hugely before twisting around and nestling himself tightly against John’s body, “It’s fantastic, perfectly formed, and it’s delicious. I’m going to suck you off every day if you’ll let me.”
“Certainly, Mr Holmes, I am at your disposal.” John internally winced at his own words.
Sherlock watched expectantly so John took the mug and carefully sipped. It was warm, bordering on too hot, but not uncomfortably so. John could practically feel the heat warming him all over. “Perfect.” Sherlock looked pleased once again.
Sherlock felt John’s body fit against his and marvelled that he’d survived for so many days in a row without it. How? John was so perfect, so compact and strong, so warm and inviting. Sherlock snuggled close, inhaling deeply to saturate himself in the scent of the man he’d missed so deeply, “I love you.”
Sherlock listened to John moving around behind him and nearly leapt upright when the doctor suddenly smeared more lubricant against his anus, “This will make things easier later.” Sherlock felt John begin to firmly massage small circles around his entrance, causing the muscles to relax enough to permit John to insert his thumb, “Such a good boy, well done Sherlock, well done. Bear down, this will feel a bit odd at first.”
Sherlock dragged the doctor’s not-very-reluctant hand onto his arse and let the man feel how firm and generous it was. That seemed to overcome the last of the doctor’s resistance, “I hope I don’t regret this.”
“You are.” John closed his eyes, his mouth still turned down.
, to hide from peers who have similar…interests.”
“It’s called a Parrot.” John absolutely loved the look on Sherlock’s face right then, “It’s a non-lethal self-defence weapon. Learn to use it correctly and you can break someone’s hand, do some serious damage to their eyes, throats, and really anywhere that has soft tissue, and best of all, it’s not a listed item so you can keep it in your pocket no matter where you are, even go through airport security with you.” John paused, “I know you wanted to be a pirate when you were little. You’d probably end up killing a real parrot so I thought
That was an acid-related accident. I’ve had those pyjamas since my first round at uni, they’re practically part of my family!” John smiled all the way through Sherlock’s protests. Sherlock regained control of his temper, realizing that John was sincere and that he really did like how Sherlock looked, no matter what he was wearing.
Sherlock wasn’t certain how to proceed. He decided to begin by familiarizing himself with the kinds of touches that aroused his master, after all, John wanted him for sex. It stood to reason that if Sherlock was good at sex, John would be good to him, he’d offered as much. If Sherlock was a good boy, he’d get treats and rewards, if he was bad, John could do anything he liked, and that was terrifying.
Mrs Hudson tittered, “Oh, look at that. You’ve made Sherlock blush. I’m going to mark this in my journal, who knows when I’ll see something like this again.” She seemed very pleased and that only made the heat grow worse.
The rest of the day was quiet. John read some more before calling in for dinner. He and Sherlock ate together in the dining room, and that’s when Sherlock met the housekeeper, Mrs Hudson. She didn’t seem shocked that her employer had purchased a slave-boy, nor that as a master, he was sharing his meal directly with his property. She made tea and brought dessert before taking their filthy dishes away. After their meal, John got Sherlock to sit on the floor in front of him while he watched movies, petting Sherlock’s curls, or bending down to kiss him deeply for a minute or so. When he was tired of that, John checked Sherlock’s arse to see if he needed another suppository, which he did. Sherlock was still quite sore and to his great relief, John wanted Sherlock to fellate him to sleep. They climbed into bed where John fucked Sherlock’s face a bit more gently than he’d done previously, but still very clearly using Sherlock only to get himself off before he dozed off. Sherlock was impressed with how many orgasms John seemed to require on a daily basis and understood in a new way how John would never have found the same relief with a regular partner or spouse. No one married to become a sex-toy, and that was exactly what John Watson wanted at his disposal.
Sherlock noted that he was sweating from the heat of their bodies and the friction. Every inch of his skin had bloomed with it, he could smell their combined arousal, and it was spectacular. “Sherlock! You’re so beautiful, so gorgeous.” Danny began to roll his hips, grazing his cockhead around Sherlock’s prostate once again in an intense tease, “I want you to come for me. I want to be the one who makes you come like this. I want to feel this pretty arse clench tight on my prick. Let go, Sherlock, let it all go.”
Sherlock’s fingers curled into fists so tight he was barely able to yank the door shut behind him and ignored the yelp of pain coming from John. Apparently, his fingers had been in the jamb, but Sherlock wasn’t concerned. John’s fingers and the rest of his body weren’t his to care for. John had someone else calling him
Dinner was enjoyed amidst a constant stream of compliments. John smiled the whole time and Sherlock felt warm inside. When they were done, Sherlock piled the dirty dishes in the sink for later, and nudged John toward the front room, “Brilliant!” John’s face was open and filled with a brightness Sherlock seldom got to see. John was always so serious, even grim sometimes. He had a fantastic if dark sense of humour, but his life had erased many of his reasons for laughing and tainted most of his happy moments with sad reminisces. This holiday was often the worst for that, despite his cheerful efforts, and that was part of why Sherlock had done this, “I haven’t done a tree up since…”
“I thought you’d bought that little house…he came back, I saw the news. I thought you two…” Sarah looked confused, “Where is Sherlock now?”
The man chuckled, carelessly throwing his arm over the back of the bench. Sherlock noted that he had no impulse to move away despite the unexpected informality of their near-embrace. “Definitely not for my health, and yeah, I should probably get a job. One day, maybe.”
Bitterly, Sherlock lay there and listened, “Don’t tell me you’re going to try and have him sectioned?”
Sherlock felt the conflict in his mind swell up for a moment but once again, reality won over.
. He had to go, “I should pack,” was all he said before stumbling out of 221 B Baker Street, almost running in his haste to get away before he vomited his self-loathing all over the freshly waxed floors.
Four hours later, John had his cock buried up to the hilt, pumping furiously away as the woman moaned and fingered herself. They’d bypassed lunch and went right for dessert. She’d brought condoms, and John was happily using one as he did his best to get her off so that he could come. She liked it hard and rough, so that’s what he gave her, working his hips until she was so wet that she dripped. Her orgasm was surprisingly quiet and John himself hissed a bit as he filled his condom with spunk, coming deep inside her warm soft body with relief. It wasn’t until she kissed him goodbye that he noticed the ring on her finger.
Lestrade came by several times but Sherlock refused to see him. Mrs Hudson sternly sent the DI away, telling him to come back with legitimate warrants if he needed to search the place, but to otherwise never show his face at her door again. Mrs Hudson was fiercely protective and wasn’t about to tolerate the presence of anyone who had hurt her boy so grievously. Sherlock shut down public access to his website,
7:00 am – There’s an open-air market. Do you like cheese still?” SH
Shake shake shake. “Medical equipment?” He seemed puzzled but also a bit excited.
other people if he wanted to, those were his exact words. We had never discussed exclusivity between us, I foolishly assumed it. I cannot say for certain how intimate their dalliance has been, but if you examine his blog, you can see that she has quite jubilantly taken my place without hesitation.”
“I know, Sherlock, and that’s okay. Eat your appetiser.” Food was magically arriving, and Sherlock realised that John must have pre-chosen their dinner options if all of it was ready so soon. How much planning had gone into this? “I love crab soup!”
Sherlock sat in his chair and sighed. It was Christmas Eve and his least favourite time of the year. Sherlock disliked the commercialism of the season, the falseness of the marketing, the endless repetition of the music, and the colour scheme. It was just another date on the calendar to him, he wasn’t into the rest of it. He didn’t exactly hate the holidays, but he really did loathe the one part of the season that he was compelled to experience far too many times, and he didn’t like it.
He’d said…
They smoked on the fire escape, laughing like boys as they put their butts out in the same ashtray that Sherlock had stolen from Buckingham Palace so long ago, and ashtray that John used to keep his pocket change in at the end of the day. Sometimes one or the other would become blue, missing their other halves, and so they would just stop what they were doing and hold one another until it passed. They went for a walk to clear their heads when things got to be too much and shared stories with one another as they strolled.
done. He felt humiliated and betrayed. He was
“Thank me by tearing apart the people who killed my Alex. What they did to him…it was horrible, inhumane, just…needlessly cruel. They demanded so much from him and he gave it. They didn’t need to do what they did, I would have done anything to make sure he was safe, even if it meant never looking for him again. Now, he’s gone forever, I’ll never get him back, and they still won’t leave me alone!”
John knew that his omega was still sad about something, but he couldn’t figure out what. He was doing everything within his power to make his beloved Sherlock happy but all he was doing was making him cry. He wished he could show Sherlock how he felt about him, but they hadn’t laid a finger on one another that could be deemed anything but chaste. They shared space intimately but had never once crossed the border into sensuality. Sherlock would not initiate anything, and John was unable to, putting his hand out just now had taken everything in him. This was the most he’d managed since he’d submitted himself to Sherlock. They were still sharing the same tender glance when the entire world went sideways as a vehicle rammed them from behind, forcing them off the road and partially into an alley.
“Rest yourself, love, just close your eyes and rest.” Sherlock’s heart thrilled at the endearment. “I’ll be right here. I won’t leave. I’m watching over you. You don’t have to worry about a thing.” Sherlock felt completely at ease for once. Reality was far better than dreams. He trusted John with his life, with his secrets, with his weaknesses. He’d tell John everything, but after he slept. He’d never felt so tired in his entire life. John held Sherlock’s hand gently once again, “Sleep, Sherlock. Everything is all right. You’re safe. I’m here, and I won’t let anything bad happen to you.”
“Technically assault, too, since I in no way established consent beforehand.” Sherlock felt ashamed of himself, but distantly. His body was still hazy with contentment.
Mycroft kept working on his report, sounding bored, as he typed, “The laws have been available for your perusal for years, Sherlock. I know you know how to find things online.”
Sherlock found it weirdly difficult to walk to the loo and had to smack Danny on the bottom to stop him from grinning so smugly, “Stop it.”
Sherlock kept glancing at Rosie, his vigilance unceasing, and his new acquaintance followed his gaze. “Your girl is adorable. Doesn’t look very much like you, though, adopted?” Danny pulled out a pack of cigarettes and lit one, offering Sherlock the pack and the lighter. Sherlock mentally shrugged and took one. He was nowhere near the children, the breeze was blowing away from the people he was sitting next to, and John wasn’t here to glare at him. “Ta,” said Danny after Sherlock had lit both their cigarettes and returned the pack and lighter.
Her betrayal hurt nearly as much as John’s did.
John glanced over himself, “I am fine. You are unhurt?”
Sherlock’s face did a strange little dance where he tried to keep his blank mask on but feelings kept breaking through his control barriers. “John, I hope you’re not still feverish again.” Feelings were winning out. Sherlock looked a bit wild around the eyes, his sharp cheeks pale as his multicoloured eyes tried to collect every visual clue he could detect.
Sarah looked entirely muddled, “Yes, you can, you were emotionally pair-bonded to Sherlock, everyone could see it. I mean, yeah, he was a beta but it was so obvious that you two had been as good as bonded for ages, I just assumed it happened right after you and I called it quits. John…do you not know that you could do that? It doesn’t even require a bite, oh my god, you didn’t know!”
He was always so considerate of Sherlock’s feelings. He had an uncanny knack for understanding where Sherlock was sometimes, unthinkingly telling Sherlock exactly what he needed to hear when he needed to hear it.
When John awoke, it was to a polite but persistent knock at the door. Blinking awake, John noticed that his mobile alert was flashing for the first time in many months. He had no idea who would need to contact him, but he glanced them over as he struggled into his robe, calling out, “Give me a minute,” at whoever was still knocking.
If anything, Sherlock walked faster, leaving John further and further behind. When he was half a-block in the lead, John finally gave up, throwing his hands in the air and slowing himself down. His hip was aching. Grousing to himself, John pushed away the feeling of humiliation as his omega left him far in the rear. His chest was hurting again, the burn turning into something icy and hard. Sherlock had shut him out and he could feel it. John was upset at being abandoned and when he could no longer see Sherlock, he stopped entirely and found a small café to have tea in.
live here, mate, but from now on, I think a little common courtesy is in order, yeah?” Danny looked down at Sherlock with concern, “Are you all right? This is a bit of an awkward moment.”
“No, I like to feel the burn.” The ache was what made the orgasms last. Sherlock wanted to wake up tomorrow and still feel this man’s cock, wanted every step to remind him of what was going to happen next, “I want you to fuck me in the way that makes you feel best. I want you to use my arse any way you like. Don’t worry about me, I’ll come the moment you do, swear.”
At 4 PM, his mobile rang with Mycroft’s signature ringtone of Queen’s

“You will.” Sherlock felt exhaustion pulling at him. His body wasn’t tired but his heart and mind were. He could sleep for days. “I need to rest some more.”
. Why’d you let me date her if you were still having it off with one another?”
John seemed to be waiting patiently, stepping closer by a pace but in a comforting and not threatening manner. Sherlock took a deep breath and just let the words tumble out, “I’m not human. I’m what you might term
about, the one that I
Mary was still a bit cool with him the next morning, announcing that she had a day planned with David as she dotted Claire du Lune on her throat, the back of her neck, inside her cleavage, as well as her wrists. John even watched as she put some on the backs of her knees, and on her ankles. John shrugged and responded by saying that he wasn’t certain how long he would be at Baker Street. John noticed that whenever she was upset with him, she always turned to David. It should have made him feel jealous right then because previously, it had, but not today. Today John was going to see the omega that used to be his best friend and try to get some answers about what had happened. If Mary wanted to go run around with her friends, then that was one less thing John had to think about right then and he was glad. There was too much as it was, he already felt torn in two.
, and it made John feel like he was being torn in two even more than previously. He knew he couldn’t do it. He couldn’t stay here and look after Sherlock, not without compromising himself even more than he already had. He couldn’t have both Mary and Sherlock, and he’d already entered a union with one. Holding back tears, John dragged out the new mobile and sent his apologies to Mycroft, “I am so, so sorry but I can’t stay with him. It’s too much. He’s much better now but he will need monitoring.”
Tears filled Sherlock’s eyes and he was struggling to breathe around sobs that he could not contain, “Yes?”
“Says who?”
John picked up his first surprise, “Huh, looks like your name actually is on this.” He smiled as Sherlock actually wiggled with excitement before tearing into the present.
Sherlock seemed to be in good spirits, his eyes bright and his face filled with subdued pleasure. His mouth lost its smile eventually, and his fingers squeezed John’s a tiny bit harder, “I know you are reluctant, John. I
John made a small lunch for himself, mostly just to keep his daughter company as she ate. He put together a large pot of stew and popped it into the oven to slow bake, entertaining Rosie by cutting the carrots into flower shapes and letting her gnaw on chunks of uncooked root vegetables, much to her great enjoyment. John smiled, enjoying his time with his little girl. When the evening meal was tucked safely away, John read the paper while Rosie played with her building blocks. Mindfully, John kept a large basket available. If Sherlock and Danny showed up, he could quickly gather up all her toys and be out of their way in no time. He wasn’t there to be underfoot.
They didn’t seem very satisfied but there was nothing more to say. Lestrade too one more lingering look at John before addressing Sherlock, “You messed him up pretty bad, Sherlock, I should be punching you right in the heart for the way you did him. You know he almost topped himself after? Remember that. The man sitting there wanted to die because of what you made him watch. I hope whatever mess you were involved in was worth what we saw him go through.”
Sherlock gasped out once more in a high-pitched voice as John rubbed two dry fingers over his sensitive hole, “Shower,” he cried out desperately, “We should shower first. Okay, John? Shower first, then sex. Come on, lover, let’s go take a nice
Sherlock observed her reaction. Dr Hooper was very surprised, but not negative. “We’re living together.” He could see the question in her face, “John knows.” Molly dragged Sherlock into her office, leaving a bemused but tolerant Danny to wait by the exit.
Donovan blinked and had the good grace to look properly chastened. She, like Lestrade, had watched Sherlock climb out of his addiction for the sake of the work, and knew very well why he’d turned his back on all of it. “You’ve every right to be mad at us, Sherlock, and I’m sorry for my part, I really am, but this separation isn’t good for either of you. John’s drinking every single day. You look like crap. He lost his job. You’re not taking cases any longer. I know you’ve got money to live on but I’m pretty sure John’s sold all his possessions. I think he’s living at his sister’s
Sherlock swallowed hard and John couldn’t stop himself from squeezing Sherlock’s hands a bit tighter, just to remind the man that he was there to help, no matter what. “Yes, in a way something has gone wrong but the wrongness happened a while ago and it has taken me all this time to understand that the path to healing has been right in front of me, and I have not properly realized that until recently.”
Sherlock blinked when all the details finally coalesced inside his brain and he understood that John was far from rejecting him, he was providing a very satisfactory alternative. “Are you certain?”
Sherlock couldn’t stop himself from closing his eyes, even though he was anxious that he might slip back into the nightmare, but he didn’t. His dreams were disjointed and hazy, normal dreams, and they faded away after he woke hours later. John was sleeping on the chair again, only this time he was sagging everywhere, his mouth gaping open as he snored raucously. Sherlock felt his mouth twitch into a smile as John rasped at the ceiling, a small string of drool escaping the corner of his mouth to pool on his shirt. It was disgusting and beautiful at the same time. He swallowed a bit to clear his throat and then tried something out, “Darling?”
world, Donovan.”
In the cab, John made Sherlock keep his hands on his head, his fingers knitted through his curls. The bite of cold air on his damaged skin felt bitterly refreshing. It felt awful to be so completely exposed but John obviously did not care if Sherlock was embarrassed or in pain. The taxi dropped them off in front of a body-alteration shop, “Right ear, top.” John oversaw the procedure and Sherlock openly wept as a hole was punched into the cartilage of his ear and a small ownership tag was installed. “I tried to treat you right, slave. I told you to obey or to expect punishment. Disobey me again and I will have them punch another hole in you, and believe me, it will be somewhere you will not like. Are we understood?”
John felt each and every grey hair on his head and every wrinkle on his face.
“I’m selling the house.”
Sherlock stood there watching as John limped away and felt like he needed to cry.
David was incensed to the degree that he completely focussed on Sherlock and stabbed forward with his knife. Sherlock managed to bat the man’s hand away, but not in time to prevent Mary from using the interruption to produce her own blade which she plunged into John’s thigh. Her eye was already swelling but her face was twisted with a dark kind of joy that John had never imagined witnessing on her face. “Surprised, love? It’s been a long aggravating year for me playing nurse for a bunch of tedious Londoners and having to put up with your moaning day after day.
John was genuinely amazing that Sherlock had no idea how to do a perfectly ordinary picture puzzle. “I start with the corners.”
“Watson, I can’t just…” Once again Donovan was cut off.
“How did you guess the specific book? The present isn’t even under the tree yet, it’s still in my room.”
The thing about addiction was that your skills at it never seemed to lessen.
It made John very content. He still made the tea and looked after the flat. Sherlock still blew things up and left horrible things in the fridge, but that was their life, the natural order of their world. When on cases, John was as deadly and dangerous as Sherlock was brilliant and clever. When they were at home, they were satisfied with everything they shared. John worked once more, but only a day or two a week because the Work came first. When they came back from their honeymoon, they were exhausted by the travel and the fact that Sherlock’s heat had come unusually early, “John?”
“I do.” John’s eyes were damp too, “So much. So very much.”
“You are mine to do so but that doesn’t mean I’m going to let anyone else get away with it.” John’s jaw dropped.
Sherlock was yawning hugely, “I could use a nap.”
“Lend me your phone.” He demanded, his voice hoarse with disuse. He kept his eyes directly on John’s face, but the doctor did not look at him. The smaller man had jumped at the unexpected conversation, and a hint of colour splashed John’s cheek, but the rest of his face paled, “I need to send a text and mine is occupied.”
Forgotten were strained muscles and still vibrant bruises. Forgotten were hurt feelings and the sense of emptiness. There was no doubt, no fear. There was just the two of them and the glorious orgasm that was overtaking them both. Sherlock lay on John’s back and drove himself quick and deep, knowing what John loved about being fucked, biting at the back of his neck and pinning his wrists above his head so that John knew he was being taken. Sherlock could feel John grow tense but when he throbbed inside, Sherlock had no idea that the sensation that it would trigger in him would be so powerful. Without meaning to, Sherlock began to come inside of John just as John shouted his release into the mattress, his body quivering as his arse milked the seed right out of Sherlock cock with every pulse. Sherlock hadn’t had an orgasm in so long that he was convinced this one would destroy him with its power. The world went static as he fell into bliss.
Sherlock was aghast when John flushed a second time, his entire body tensing in a head to toe cringe that he tried to pretend wasn’t happening, “Nothing wrong with any of those things. Friends do that stuff all the time.” He sounded as if he didn’t even believe himself.
They dozed for a long time before finally coming round. John had to peel himself off of Sherlock, the dried effluvia between them creating a fantastic natural glue, “Erg.” John sounded disgusted, “We really need to wash.”
It made him throw up a second time. He felt sick right down to his toes. Ruthlessly, he turned up the hot water as far as it would go and washed fiercely everywhere until his skin was red and almost raw looking. He turned the shower off for a minute and dug around the cabinet beneath the sink until he located the enema kit that Mycroft had prudently placed there a short while after John and Sherlock got together, and used it to clean himself out, trying desperately to sanitize the awful feelings away. It didn’t work. Sherlock felt dirty, contaminated by the hands of a third party he had not consented to.
“Nothing except
Apparently not. His price sank one failed bid at a time. Most of the people in the audience had lost interest, and the only person still looking at him was a rather down-on-the-cuff appearing yet obviously ex-military man who couldn’t seem to keep his eyes off Sherlock. It took a second glance for Sherlock to note that the soldier was anything but unsuccessful.
He wore his hair much shorter now, that’s what had thrown John at first, but on second glance, John knew who he was currently making direct eye contact with. It had been five years but there was no mistaking those eyes for anyone else’s, “Sherlock.”
John found himself seated at his tiny table, knees bumping into Sherlock’s as the younger man pretended they were on a food talk show, feeding John samples of each food one after the other. He used funny voices as he narrated their movements and made faces as they judged eat a bite in turn. John hadn’t laughed that hard in years. The coffee was earthy and bracing, and the tiny quail eggs that Sherlock happened upon had been poached to perfection after a brief internet search on how to cook them. They tried cheeses that ranged from piquant to bland, had tastes from tiny jam jars filled with artisan creations, and heated up crunchy rolls of fresh bread in John’s small toaster over. By the time they were down to a selection of fruits, both men were full and drowsy, and three hours had passed by.
“Oh, I’m staying.” John sat himself down, his eyes still fixed on Sherlock. “I wouldn’t leave for anything in the world.”
John went through the motions of being functional for the rest of the day. When Harry texted that she was coming by with dinner, he didn’t respond. He took care of his daughter with almost exaggerated cautiousness, blank inside as he attempted to focus, to pay attention, making sure she was as happy and comfortable as he could make her. John was afraid he’d made a terrible error by inviting Sherlock and Danny there today.
John decides to go see Sherlock and finds more than he suspected he would.
Sherlock knew he could never say no to Mrs Hudson, not really. She had saved him so many times, more times than anyone but the two of them knew. More than one scar on his body had her stitches in them. More than one over-dose had been prevented from being fatal, because of her. His many brushes with self-induced starvation had been stymied, because of her. His relationship with Mycroft had been repaired, all because of her. “Must I?”
Sherlock didn't let himself dare hope, but it flared up anyway.
Everything proceeded as planned. Sherlock grew drowsy soon enough and trundled off to bed. When John heard him finally snoring softly, he crept off to enact his plans. Pressing the laundry hamper into service, John loaded up all the fake presents and brought them down to the storage unit. He'd arranged for a cab to take him to the clinic and back again, even if the driver was grumpy for needing to be out on this of all nights. Once the switch was made, John returned to the basement flat and dug out the new microwave where he’d hidden it beneath empty boxes that normally contained Christmas decorations. He installed it quickly, and after he gave it a quick wipe-down, John attached a small card featuring a picture of John and Sherlock standing side by side at the Yard, wishing her the happiest of days.
and I don’t know how to make it right again. You did not deserve what I did to you. I don’t have any excuses, I don’t deserve your forgiveness so I’m not even going to ask. I’m absolute trash. All I want is a chance to help you get better. I
John was led into a cramped but homey space inside the family home. It was packed full of people who were physical variations of Mycroft and Sherlock. One cousin could have been Sherlock’s twin, if not for the height or hair. Martin was short and coppery, but also barely paying attention. His focus was on the large smiling man at his side, a gentle giant who seemed to hover protectively over the small Holmes. John wondered what their story was. He’d learn in time, he supposed.
John took it. Opening the heavy flap he looked inside. It seemed a bit of a bird’s nest at first but John dug through it. There were shoelaces and bits of wire, an old hand transistor radio, a roll of goofer tape, a smaller bag containing a selection of cosmetics, and an odd assortment of hand-cobbled tools meant for only Sherlock-knew what purpose. “This was yours?”
“No.”
“I know, Johnny, we both are.” Harry got him to the street, needed to almost carry him. Harry noticed that John was limping heavily and that he couldn’t seem to close his left hand on anything. It worried her. Opportunistic taxi drivers were waiting along the curb and Harry poured John into the closest one. “Address?”
John’s cock was perfect. The girth and weight of it felt amazing as well as arousing and not frightening. The doctor was very hard, seeping a bit from his tip, but it wasn’t intimidating or overwhelming. Sherlock was barely able to get the entire head in his mouth and so he used his hand to stroke and press. It was delicious too, bitter and salty, with a hint of musk.
He didn’t get further. John swatted the phone out of his hands, and it shattered on impact with the curb. John looked shocked at his own actions so Sherlock took advantage of his stillness to punch John as hard as he could in the jaw. The soldier was staggered, stumbling backwards, and Sherlock took off running, not looking where he was going, just desperate to get away from everything that hurt. There was a moment of white-hot searing agony, and then, Sherlock stopped feeling anything at all.
Their conversation was easy and comfortable, and John realized that he’d desperately missed connecting with someone so deeply. Everything was wonderful, and time seemed to fly by as he ate one bite after another without issue, his attention completely taken up by the incredible man in front of him. Sherlock had brought with him a wellspring of happiness and it was dizzying to feel good again.
He was startled when the front door crashed open. John stalked in, “Sherlock! Come here, now!” Sherlock scrambled, nearly running to meet John. His master forced him to his knees, pried his jaw open before tugging down his trousers. John reinserted his cock just as he had that morning but now he was in a rage. He got hard, fast, and ruthlessly fucked Sherlock’s mouth, going deeper and deeper until Sherlock was gagging and almost heaving. John just gripped Sherlock’s hair tighter and thrust as deeply as he could. Sherlock felt his gorge rise. He was going to vomit, he couldn’t stop it. Yanking his head back, he made a mess on the floor, helplessly coughing up sick all over himself. John didn’t let him have even a minute to recuperate, just turning him around, jerking down his bottoms so he could pull the plug from Sherlock’s anus without care. John took his spit slicked cock and shoved hard. Sherlock screeched as John impaled him. “Shut up. You’re cleaning that filth up. Be quiet!”
“What about Sherlock?” Mary sounded sly, “I bet he’d go for it. He’d take anything he can get from you, shameless they are, you know it. He might even like to give David a go, and I know David wouldn’t mind that either. Maybe we could just, you know, be together as a group.”
John listened to Sherlock but could barely retain eye-contact. “Tonight was everything I knew it could be. You’re always amazing, Sherlock. Everything about you is just…amazing.” John knew he was repeating himself but he was beginning to suffer a bit in the pants region. Sherlock smelled lovely, and now that they were someplace familiar, John was hoping that Sherlock’s words meant what he thought they’d meant. “I have to confess that I don’t want to count this as our first date because that would mean…”
Once he was home, John tried to brew a cup of tea but ended up sobbing over the sink, self-hatred filling him once more as he recalled the coppery tang of blood on the air as he beat Sherlock with his bare fists. He wished for whiskey but knew he couldn’t start drinking again. He’d nearly done himself in the last time he’d binged and binge he would if even a drop passed his lips. He couldn’t forget how Sherlock had pissed blood for a week because of how hard John had kicked his kidneys, of the mess of scars on Sherlock’s once pristine body that he’d gotten while he disappeared for two years to save John’s pathetic life. Even that horrific image could not top the pain of betrayal that Sherlock’s face expressed when he’d caught John with that man.
Sherlock slowly lifted his mobile up and made a show of muting it, fishing John’s mobile out of his coat pocket and doing the same. The screen lit up just as he did so, and John quickly returned his attention to the location of their enemies, making sure they hadn’t somehow noticed the dim light. Sherlock held it up and let John read the text from Mycroft. Help wouldn’t get to them for twenty minutes. John hoped that Mary and David simply searched themselves away from their current location. They weren’t paying a lot of attention to what they were doing, in fact, they were still arguing softly.
. The news didn’t disturb the chemical calm that the world’s only consulting detective was floating in. It was a concoction of his own making, one that he regretfully didn’t have much of but it was enough to last until he was ready for the next step. Mycroft would have sent in a whole team to extract every single thing that belonged to John, boxed it up neatly, and delivered all of it, doctor included, to some alternate address far from their old flat. Sighing with regret, but too cold inside to do more than that, Sherlock waited an appropriate length of time, and then went home. A grey-faced and red-eyed Mrs Hudson silently handed him a brand-new key. She pressed her wrinkled hands over his for a moment, and then let him wordlessly climb the seventeen steps alone. Whatever objections or protestations John had made while he was being tossed to the curb, Sherlock didn’t want to hear about, and his landlady understood.
