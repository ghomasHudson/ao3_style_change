"They want you now," Rumlow insists. Steve, Clint, Natasha and I all stop and look at him for a moment.
“Clint’s just landing us,” I explain, pushing my goggles up higher on my forehead to act as a sort of impromptu headband. Strands of hair are bursting out of my braid, getting in my face unless I constantly push them back. “Uh. Leave anything that explodes in the jet. Get ready to go, I guess.”
“You have fifteen seconds to get the hell out of there,” Maria says. I hesitate, perched on top of the railing that lines the catwalk.
Lila hurries over to Nat while I make my way into the room cautiously. Steve is leaned up against one wall, facing Nat, while Bruce lingers in the corner behind the redhead.
"Three minutes, max." I use the speeder as a kickboard, launching myself after another few speeders. "Payload will wipe out Midtown."
"We had decoys," Rhodey repeats shakily, with red-rimmed eyes. "Someone leaked the security details. They knew exactly which Humvee to attack."
"We always have choices," she takes his hand in her free one, the calluses on her trigger finger brushing against those on Tony's hand, young but forged in hard work and heavy lifting. "Compromise where you can," Peggy closes her eyes. "And when you can't, don't."
“See! He has muscle problems.” Tony says perhaps too defensively, but if Rogers has something to say about Tony, he should very well say it to Tony’s face.
“The whole point of this was to make you think of good things,” Steve taps at Tony's chest. “And you're a very good thing in my books. The best.”
“Then it’s settled,” Tony has the gall to say, only the slightest bit breathless. “Next time, I’m staying the night – hopefully not in the guest room.”
Tony presses his hand on the glass, humming quietly to not disturb the other babies. “Heart rate strong,” he checks off her clipboard. “Oxygen levels high. Bit of a fever, but you're a fighter, aren't you?”
"I'm fine," Steve fights the hot pain to rasp out, his hand blindly searching for the crook of Tony's armor where the arc reactor sits, resting his head heavily on the armor's hard shoulder. He has to get up, to keep fighting, but -
Tony marches towards him. "Ten years!" he snaps, shoving violently at Steve's chest. "Ten years and you waltz in here, on an invitation from Howard - and you
Steve reacts without thinking: he hooks his shield on his back and in one move, pulls Tony's hand, spinning them both around so that it's
"Of course." Like all Hammer products, the inside of the explosive is a mess of inefficient wires, but for once Tony can't find it in himself to complain. Priorities: deactivate timer, then the pressure tigger, and get Carrie out of the room, preferably with Steve too. They're still surrounded by a skeleton staff of SHIELD agents who can protect him without being a star spangled ass.
The amusement falls off Tony's face. Rubbing his palm over his eyes, he does his best to stick to his smile, now hollow and tired. "What does it say about me that two of my longest friends have fought in a war?" he scoffs at himself. "And worse, that I build their weapons for them?"
“The 107th,” Steve tells him as he fills out his contact number and signs his name on the form with a flourish.
“Is this a drill?” Tony asks one of the nurses. His pager beeps, and – a loud blaring. The fire alarms. Drills were supposed to be every Wednesday, every three months.
He wouldn't throw a drink in Tony's face or spark a shouting match in public. He wouldn't laugh if Tony tripped - well, he
“Sometime soon, I hope,” Steve whispers into the small space between them, a secret confession. “We can have fondue next time, cheese and Italian.”
Steve glances forlornly down at the brown staining his own suit, and the ruined white shirt under it. "Hi."
There's fiery pain crawling up Steve's back, and he's pretty sure that voice in his ear is Tony screaming at him, Tony's hand thumping against Steve's chest to get Steve to let go, but Steve can still hear the bot advancing, and -
“Oh really?" Tony says. "I thought you forgot about that.” His voice is scratchier and deeper than Steve remembered.
Purposefully, he loudens his footsteps, putting more weight in them than he was trained to do, hoping that his approach would be noticed.
As it was, however, Steve looked away from him, turning back to his lonely plate. Seven more months, and he’d get to go back home for the summer holidays.
Each word comes as a blow, a finality feeding the gnawing pit of Tony’s fears, turning them to anger. “When did you know?” he demands.
“Just a scratch, Doctor Stark,” Steve answers sheepishly. Next to him, Quill glowers, but before it can go any further, Tony raises his hand.
“I didn't rescue you just to have you die on me again, Scrubs,” Carol cuts in. “You better come out breathing.”
Scoffing, Tony shakes his head. “There’re going to be bullies in any school you go to. Are you going to get yourself kicked out of
Suddenly, he feels something warm press against his cheek, the scratch of a beard, then as quickly as it came, Tony darts away. When Steve takes a sideways peek, there's a bit of pink dusting Tony's ears.
“Ma’s doing well,” he says, nodding towards another frame on the wall: his Ma's first day out of the hospital, Steve finally more than a foot taller than her in the photo. "Bucky's getting better."
"How many of these do you have to go to each year?" Steve adjusts his tie, snagging a tall glass of champagne from a passing waiter.
"We'll send someone else over," Peggy offers him a way out. "I have the crash site blocked out for the next four hours. No one else can know before Tony."
. He's not fifteen anymore, however, and he needs to ask one last thing before Tony inevitably grows too antsy to stay.
The glint of victory in Tony's eyes is too bright for Steve too look at, and he pushes the subject away, casting for anything that might hold onto Tony's rapid attention. "I met Captain Rhodes."
But Howard wasn't currently Steve's priority. It was Tony who mattered, Tony whose letters had stopped coming years ago, abruptly cutting any hope of reaching him.
"Tony," he tries. He knows better than to touch him during this, or to try and wake him up. All Steve can do is offer something else for Tony's subconscious to latch onto, and even asleep, Tony knows his voice. "Whatever it is, you're safe," Tony's head tips slightly in Steve's direction, but his eyes are still shut tight. "Sweetheart? I'm here," he tries again, "you're alright. We're alright."
The paramedics rush to help open the door, and he takes in a deep breath to center himself. Any distraction could cost a patient's life.
It’s fascinating as much as it’s infuriating, because it throws off the entirety of Tony’s findings on the other boy.
Unaware of Tony's plight, Steve doesn't bother hiding his amusement. "That I dance better than you."
stop, frozen in something that seems too close to fear. Which is also not right, because Steve shouldn't have to be afraid.
Guarding the door, Steve nearly winces at the hard edge to Peggy's reply, sharp enough to cut. "Someone put the heir to Stark Industries at risk."
If he focuses enough on Bucky, he might not have to grapple with the fact that Tony Stark is standing in front of their small apartment, trying to break in just as he had broken into Steve's dorm room as a child.
- robot's ass. Tony is right: when hacking doesn't work, some old-fashioned punches might do better.
It goes like this: Tony is sprawled on Steve’s bed, his blueprints scattered across the sheets, and Steve sits at his table, not reading his book.
Steve looks supremely unimpressed. “Yes, you’re Tony Stark. And just because you’re younger, smarter, richer than everyone, it doesn’t excuse you from acting callously to the staff or from
Steve's lips twitch up. Special is an understatement. "You love him," Steve says. There's no jealousy, only a kindred feeling.
“But apparently you think I’m heartless.” Tony thinks back on how Steve liked to dislike all the students of the school, thinks of Steve calling them dull and vain, thinks of how Steve must have talked about Tony like that too. “If you want me out of your life, there’s no need to lie to me. I’ll go.”
to you?" the words slip out, helpless and adrift. Tony's jaw tightens, back straightening, and it's so - Tony used to do that when he disagreed with anyone, stubbornness charging up with a single-minded focus of fighting back. Steve rushes to cover up. "I meant, are you alright? You're not sleeping enough."
"I have to go," he tells Steve, who came back home only two nights ago. "If you don't want to go, I've got three other SHIELD agents happy to tail me."
Bucky is waiting for Steve to come back to their hideout, and Steve lengthens his strides, uncomfortable with leaving Bucky for too long alone. He's more worried than usual with this being Bucky's first mission in three years, the first since Bucky had gone off radar for a year, captured by HYDRA until an anonymous tip had led Agent Carter straight to the newly named Winter Soldier.
Fury's team was helping Thor handle the fire much faster, and any second now, it'd be safe enough for Steve to go in. Strapping his helmet back on, Steve nods to Carol.
finds sneaking to be the best way to get a hug from Steve. It hasn’t gotten any less endearing. While he wishes Tony would feel comfortable enough to simply ask whenever he needed anything from Steve, but he’s learning that there are some things that don’t need to be asked for.
SHIELD was the one to rescue Bucky from the brink of death, and they were independent. No government agendas, no politics. Just the good fight.
He’s faced explosions in the deserts. He’s survived through the heat and the cold and the blood. Talking to a kind-hearted vet should be easy.
“I don’t disapprove,” Steve gives up trying to pack as long as Tony is in the room. He sits beside Tony at the edge of the bed, at the edge of a cliff Steve doesn't know if he can afford to fall from. “I just – you go too fast.”
Besides, staying unattached wasn’t particularly hard to do. Nobody was interested in Steve’s non-existent networks or wealth, nor was Steve interested in wasting his money and time attempting to gain their favors. Steve prefers his life. An honest one, simple and warm, without any of the lies that seeped deep in the walls of this school.
"For safekeeping," he insists. "If you ever need help, if Steve ever - " that thought didn't bear thinking, "plug it into the nearest computer and it'll do the rest."
The stiffness in Tony’s shoulders, the way he gripped his fork tight enough to turn his knuckles white – they screamed at Steve to
Peggy shakes her head. "We don't know who to trust to do justice with the evidence, and we need our own arsenal of tech to keep HYDRA at bay."
They lay on the bed for a few more minutes, not kissing but just enjoying each other’s company. And when Steve grabs his sketchbook from the nightstand Tony looks at the pages.
Good old pops put both hands on his shoulders, looked at him in the eyes and gave him the only real advice he ever gave to him.
He means it as a joke, even though he actually has another motorcycle he is planning on giving him “in case of emergency”, only Happy knows about it.
That's why he's looking at the bottom of an empty bottle trying to remind himself that he's iron, he's indestructible, he's... Just like Howard. Howard who had been dead for more than twenty years now and still came back to haunt him every year. It was only during his birthday that Howard seemed to remember Tony was his son, and it was only on Howard's birthday that Tony was reminded he was his father. And that hadn't change.
Tony then kisses his cheek and Steve smiles, he kisses him in the lips and Tony kisses him back. They kiss for what seemed hours, rolling on the bed until he’s on top of Steve but not completely.
“I… I wanted to draw you like that” Steve says shyly, his eyes lingering on Tony’s body before looking back at the page.
Tony decides to take the rest of the day off, he had advance enough on his last armour to give himself much deserve rest. He takes Steve to a cafe downtown, where they serve, according to Pepper, the best cronuts. They know very well that they can call the attention, so when they get out of the car the try to walk quietly inside the store. Steve holds his hand when they start walking and Tony smiles to himself and intertwines their fingers.
Highschool came and with that a lot of his friends left him, after his parents died he became bitter, closed off. He barely left his room, submerging himself in his inventions, barely talking to Jarvis or anyone else for that matter. He became just like his father had been all of his life. Jarvis stopped insisting on him going out, letting him mourn alone the lost of his parents. To him, his parents had left him long before that, so he didn’t let himself cry.
Tony groans, “Why do you always say things like that?” he throws himself in the bed and covers his face with his hands.
Tony thinks about it, “One time, though… Jarvis took me to feed the birds on the other side of the lake” he smiles sadly, “Ana, his wife had died and he said he wanted to spend time with me, that it made him happy being with me” he says, “Feeding birds”
Tony fists his shirt, needing to know he was there, that he was with him. The blond broke the kiss and smiled. Oh, god, he wanted Steve to be there with him.
There is no one else awake in the tower, it was way past midnight anyways. He went to a bar after he visited the graves with Pepper - Like he did ever year on Howard's birthday - she always insisted in going with him even if he was there for not more than ten minutes. The faint light from the city filters through the big windows, illuminating the whole living room and the kitchen, where he was leaning against the counter, his vision blurry and his hands shaky, as he took another swing of the very expensive whisky that was opened once a year for the special occasion.
"Natasha, what's your status?" Steve whispers, bringing his arm up in order to speak into the comm on his wrist. No answer. "Clint, status?"
Looking back ahead, I slip my hand into one of the inside pockets, withdrawing the chip and looking over my shoulder warily. No sounds of a fight yet, but that’s not necessarily a good thing.
“You two can still walk away from this,” Steve cuts in, looking at the twins. His shield is held at his side, not yet pulled up in defense.
"C'mon, Cap, I'm not an invalid," I growl. Steve's frown deepens, and he holds my whip away from me.
I swear viciously, but draw my elbow back and slam it into the other’s face hard enough to knock them out.
"But you don’t,” Clint shoots back shrewdly. Behind his dumb blonde act, he’s actually pretty smart. Nick told me that he figured out how the Tesseract worked before the world’s best astrophysicist. “You’re a spy, not a soldier. Now you want to wade into a war. Why? What did Loki do to you?” Natasha freezes, then pushes off the bed, crossing her arms and walking a little ways across the room.
The speedster disappears in a blur of silver-blue, and before anyone can blink, sparks fly from disconnected equipment. Pietro’s From comes into focus on the other side of the room, long connecting cable in hand.
“I should probably look into that once my decryption program finishes breaking into all of SHIELD’s secure files,” Stark says idly, moving out from behind the table. My gaze snaps to the billionaire, and I silently thank my paranoia. The rest of the team can
Kate is amazing. She is sane, she is calm in most situations and she kicks ass. Also she keeps me sane and brings both Clint and me coffee.
"The good-looking guy in the sunglasses, your 10 o'clock," Sam replies. The SHIELD agent turns in the opposite direction, and I sigh out loud. "Your other 10 o'clock," Sam corrects. Down in the plaza, I see Sam move and tip his drink towards Sitwell. "There you go."
"Too busy!" he calls over his shoulder. Then I push him off the edge of the ramp, leaping down after him. It's been a while since I've been on an op like this. Sure, lately I've been training with Nat (not as recently, since the last time I'd seen her before today was when she was about to leave for a month-long op in Florida), and when she's not available I train with Clint. But SHIELD doesn't really call me in for anything anymore (which I'm kinda grateful for, but at the same time I'm not), and something that's Avengers-scale disaster isn't that common.
“Says the man getting ready to jump into a blending machine,” I groan, readjusting my hands and pushing harder.
“That man is playing Galaga,” the playboy suddenly says, pointing to one of the techs. “Thought we wouldn’t notice, but we did.” A pause in which Stark covers one eye and surveys the screens. “How does Fury even see these?” I roll my eyes.
, because I know that he doesn’t want to do this, he doesn’t want to fight against a man who was once his brother.
"Telling you would take away the fun, wouldn't it?" the computer says in a falsely jovial tone. Steve's face is blank and expressionless, but his blue eyes are cold and flinty glaciers.
“Ultron’s got an enemy, that’s not the same thing,” he corrects. The look in Nat’s eyes is snuffed out, replaced by a cold, analytical gaze. Clint and I make eye contact from across the room, and the archer shrugs one shoulder subtly. “Still, I’d pay folding money to know who it is,” Nick adds.
“He’ll be more powerful than any of us except maybe wonder girl, but she’d have to get close enough to touch him,” Tony confirms. “Maybe all of us, if that’s the case.” He shakes his head. “An android designed by a robot.”
“Going left,” I hear Tony mutter in reply. I narrow my eyes behind the clear plastic of my goggles, tucking my arms in tight, careful to hold the blades away from my legs, and accelerating. And then I’m right in the thick of it, ducking under some sort of alien motorcycle that
A loud beep has Tony turning back to his computer, and Steve takes his moment of vulnerability as opportunity to throw his shield. Tony turns in a heartbeat, gauntlet appearing seemingly out of thin air to blast the vibranium disc away. A jet from his repulsor sends Steve crashing back. Another one is sent my way but I twist away, kicking off and flying at Tony.
"This is a dead end," the redhead declares, tucking her StarkPhone into her pocket. "Zero heat signatures, zero waves, not even radio. Whoever wrote the file must have used a router to throw people off."
A month after the Battle of New York, and I'm still not quite moved in to Clint's. And so here I am, on the phone with Tony as I dig through yet another cardboard box in search of the coffee maker Tony had sent me.
And his freezing cold eyes are staring into mine and all I can think of are flashes, bits and pieces of broken memories that I don’t remember having, of times that I’ve stared into these very same eyes. Something flickers behind them in the present day. Something that I never remembered seeing.
Something nudges my foot, and I jump, settling into a fighting stance on instinct. Looking down, I see a small, circular robot, almost like a roomba, trundling up to my foot again. I stand stock still as the little thing makes a loop around my Converse, before running into my foot again. If it had eyes, I’d swear that it would be giving me an expectant look.
"Office building, south," I mutter to my self, scooping up the arrows. "Yeah, I can do that." Then I kick off, rocketing down the street with a cluster of arrows held tightly in one hand. I loop around the office building, tumbling through an already-broken window, and Clint manages to steady me. "Thanks," I say, slightly breathless. "Here's the arrows." More speeders
“They’re in Africa dealing with a rogue magician, so Doom decided to pick on us today,” Natasha replies dryly.
I sprint forwards, taking a running leap off of the open cargo bay doors, snapping my goggles over my eyes to protect them from the nasty shit that might get in them. I surge forwards as the sound of the whirring of machinery reaches my ears, even with the wind rushing past them. I risk a glance over my shoulder and spot Iron Man a few meters behind, gold and red armor glinting in the sunlight, scratched and dented as it is.
"We gotta get back up there," the Cap says, jogging forwards. I glance at Clint. He shrugs. I follow him through the dusty air of NYC, weaving around cars until we're standing outside of... I dunno, it might be a bank but it's too dusty to make out the sign at the very top of the massive white marble building.
The door leads us to a set of stairs, which Steve leads the way down. Natasha is right behind him, Clint behind her and me behind him. As we step off the stairs, I can just see the vague form of Steve switching the lights on. I blink once for my eyes to adjust to the new lighting, and the first thing I see when they do is a familiar logo emblazoned on the far wall. Clint sucks in a shocked breath from in front of me as the four of us advance forwards slowly.
"I bet you knew Fury hired the pirates, didn't you?" Steve snaps accusatorily. I blink. Raise my hand.
"You're the Black Lynx?" he asks, half-incredulous, half-amazed. "That's impossible. You'd have to be at least thirty."
“Zola,” Steve mutters, still lost in thought. “Bucky’s whole unit was captured in ‘43. Zola experimented on him. Whatever he did helped Bucky survive the fall.” He’s looking up now, at Sam. My head is pounding, and I blink away the spots in my vision. “They must have found him and…”
“It would be my genuine pleasure,” I reply breezily. “What’ve we got so far on Rudolph?” It's almost like I'd flipped a switch. Banner resumes pacing, and so does Thor. Rogers leans forward.
“As shitty as we are, I still think that roll call is in order,” I suggest, setting my drink down. I count them off on my fingers as I go. “There’s your brother, the surfer dude with muscles more than my waist. A super soldier with a shield that I’m 95% sure is made out of patriotism. A guy with breathtaking anger issues. An assassin who’s killed more people than there’s buildings in this city. Another assassin who once won a Jenga contest with two arrows and a stick of gum. And a guy who I’m pretty sure can build several cars while blackout drunk with a pretty damn resistant suit made outta metal.”
“It’s the Mind Stone,” the demigod quickly explains. “It’s one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.”
“I was throwing up,” Sitwell says. “I get seasick.” The backs of his ankle hits the edge and he windmills his arms around as he tips backwards. Steve’s hands shoot out, grabbing the lapels of his jacket and yanking him back up. Natasha smirks, leaving to go stand just behind Steve.
“I’m sorry,” the creature says, voice light and gentle and British and… JARVIS. “That was… odd.” It (he?) pauses, nodding to Thor. “Thank you.” A cape flows down over a set of broad shoulders, appearing out of thin air, a mimicry of Thor’s but not.
“Hey, Nat,” I mutter, looking at my feet. The sounds of footsteps and a shadow falling over me are the only warnings I get before I’m pulled into a bone-crushing hug by one of the world’s deadliest assassins. I stiffen for a moment, before slowly relaxing and wrapping my arms around Natasha Romanoff’s middle, tablet clattering to the floor.
Steve is silent, and for a moment I think that’s it because I broke the thing that Should Not Be Broken.
"Ready?" Natasha mutters. I flash her a thumbs up, stowing my whip away and slamming my armguards against my thighs, activating my wrist reapers. "Shall we?" the ex-Russian superspy asks.
A ripple in the air seems to cause a concussive force, and all of a sudden Steve is flying through the air. I swear quietly, tucking my arms in and angling myself down, shooting through empty space like a rocket. Drawing closer, I turn my body so that Steve and I will pass by each other, reaching out to snag the back of his suit as I do.
“Let’s start with that stick of his,” Rogers orders. “It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a Hydra weapon.”
“I’m going in!” the genius warns. His words are quickly followed by the sound of whirring metal, which I take as my cue to shove off from the underside of the helicarrier, zipping to the side as fast as I can. However, a flash of blue catches my eye and something slams into my side, sending me cartwheeling a few meters to the side and three feet down before I regain my bearings. Screaming grows louder and then fainter as flashes of black shoot by me.
“I just thought that maybe if I kept looking, then he’d know that I want to find him, even if he’s still the Soldier,” Steve continues, interrupting my runaway train of thought. “That he’d know I wouldn’t care.”
“Not alone,” the creature—a he, I suppose, judging by the voice—says, beginning to advance. The closer he gets the dizzier that energy makes me, and I’m forced to take a step back and to the side.
“Don’t aim for me next time,” I reply grumpily, collapsing to what remains of the the metal catwalk on the side of the massive flying base in the sky.
I breathe in deeply, standing up and pulling my shirt over my head. My civvies are replaced with my gear in no time, and I quickly slot all my weapons in place. The whip goes on my belt, coiled neatly on a belt of knives. Fours guns go in their holsters lined up on the sides of my calves, and I stash spare ammo anywhere I can put it.           I clench my hands into fists, leather of my gloves creaking. It’s terrifying. Knowning that I’m going out with a group of people like me to fight an army of aliens from outer space. Just a day ago, my biggest worry was whether or not I’d turned in the term paper. I set my jaw, picking up the mask and clipping it to my belt beside the whip. I shake my muscles out quickly before bounding out of the room.
“JARVIS was the first line of defense,” Steve reasons. “He would’ve shut Ultron down, it makes sense.”
"You must be a mighty warrior indeed, Lady Hinojosa, for SHIELD to have called you back." Intense, electric blue eyes lock onto mine. "Pray tell: what are you capable of?" I smirk, crossing my legs as I tug on the swirling mass of power in my gut and turn invisible. Rogers' eyes widen, Banner stops in his pacing, stupified, and Thor nods approvingly. I grin, carefully climbing out of my seat and onto the table without a sound.
“That’s not perverted at all,” I mutter, crossing my arms with a shudder. “I’d say nice to meetcha, but you kinda turned one of my only friends into a flying monkey from the Wizard of Oz.” Loki rolls his eyes.
*." The blonde squeezes his eyes shut. "Sex. Sec. Gimme a sec." Then he flings the door open, narrowly avoiding hitting himself in the nose. "Heya, Rogers, you might want to step inside. We've got a surprise waiting for you in here." Clint doesn't even wait for the other blonde to reply before I see him lean through the doorway and drag the supersoldier inside, closing the door behind him.
The turn comes up. I don’t change directions. I can see my reflection in the glass windows of the building. And then I swerve violently, tucking my knees up and feeling my feet meet the glass.
The lid of the Cradle flies off in a shower of debris, throwing Thor to the ground as another figure rises from within. It balances on the edge of the Cradle for one eerie moment, shrouded in smoke and motionless, stationary, strangely so.
I resist the urge to bang my head against something in an attempt to get that dry, deadpan tone out of my head, because I shouldn’t still be hearing him after two years and it
"What's that?" Steve pointed to a flash of red and gold. Though it was only moments since Iron Man had vanished into a bank of cloud, he was now, impossibly, standing on the drive below the house. The figure beside him wore battleship grey armour, festooned with weapons. "We just saw Tony – Iron Man – leave. And that isn't the Rescue armour, surely?"
But why should anyone, including SHIELD, rely on such an indiscriminate and dangerous weapon as gas?
"You think Rhodes wouldn't play ball so the Air Force took the suit away from him. Was it the original War Machine?"
"Don't let him. He'll only wake him. I'll do it in a moment. Meanwhile, I think we'll hold on the pizza. Tony needs sleep more than food. I've never seen him look so tired."
Tony shivered at Steve's unexpected touch, losing the thread of what he had been saying. If Steve moved his hand down few inches he was going to be... totally incoherent, probably. Damn it, he'd never expected Steve to come on to him like this... and it was playing hell with his resolve to keep this... this relationship... platonic long enough to let Steve realise his mistake and, hopefully, be satisfied with their closer friendship—
"Of course not. I told you yesterday: I'm finished with Fury, with SHIELD, but ..." The anger died away as suddenly as it had come, or perhaps he had gotten himself under control. Now he just looked weary. "But SHIELD found me, thawed me out, staked me, gave me a mission..." He shook his head. "It's difficult to let that go. Dang it, they own the apartment where I've been living, even the clothes I stand up in. Maybe they do have a right to think they own me."
Except that the structure felt more futuristic in the way the armour-encased man and the giant flying aircraft carrier he had escaped had not. Around the walls stood other metal figures – other armours? – from a sleek black number that almost vanished in the dark of its alcove to a giant menacing construction that could destroy...
There was no arguing with that sentiment and Steve knew that the easiest way for him to lose Tony's trust was to question his ability to cope. "Be safe," he said, "and come back to me soon."
that it sent a throb of desire into his groin; half need, half memory. "It's on the schedule – I have a meeting in Washington," she said, with an air of exasperation.
"Ah. So the wind is in that quarter. Let me know when they marry and I will send a suitable wedding present. Perhaps a replacement jet, if SHIELD destroys this one."
"Was that good?" Tony asked, dropping the tissues he had been using to clean them both to one side and wrapping both arms around Steve's chest.
The case containing the stone had gone and without his shield he was weaponless - no, Mjolnir would come when called. Cautiously, he flexed his fingers – and they brushed the hammer's distinctive handle.
Iron Man was flying high – high enough, Tony hoped, to avoid attention from the ground, though he had, on this particular occasion, filed the appropriate flight plans. Of course, he hadn't mentioned that Iron Man was, in this case, the centre of a swarm. The transporter pods clustered about him, protected by his new stealth technology. Most of them contained equipment eventually destined for Stark Special Projects in Seattle where, no doubt, the staff were still frantically working on preparations for their arrival.
Pepper looked dubious. "Just how long have you been working on this?" she asked, poking at the printouts with a perfectly manicured finger tipped with polish that exactly matched her shoes.
Apparently satisfied, Tony replaced the artefact in the bag and the bag in the closet. "Let's go eat," he suggested, with a grin. "Or at least, cook. I'll be interested what you think you're going to do with all those veggies."
Julia opened the door to the East Sitting Hall and announced, loudly, "Mom, you have a visitor." She was making an obvious attempt to maintain a disinterested and dignified air while also being full of glee at her own importance.
"Yes, she was," Steve said, before Carter could reply. "She answered the phone call in an imitation of Peggy's voice."
"Worse, among them they have Asgardians, with powerful tech." Tony winced. "I guess that if magic is science we don't understand, what they have is magic. There could even be other alien involvement. If so, we are definitely not ready. And we're vulnerable here. The tower's an obvious target. We need to move."
"Got it." Stark disappeared through a door into what was, presumably, a bathroom (and when did every bedroom get its own bathroom?) and came back a minute or so later, with a tumbler full of water in one hand and a packet of some pills, probably painkillers, in the other.
"I tried not to. Sometimes... Can I tell Director Fury that I've spoken with you? He knows you went to Africa with Tony, but you didn't come back with him, and he tells me that, while he met with Tony there, he saw no sign of you."
Tony's frown did not vanish. "She did? I thought your team was up to their necks in negotiations on the Stark Energy foreign subsidiaries and you needed to ride herd on them."
Only Betty let go of her handhold, not of suit-and-sunglasses. She disappeared out of the hatch still hanging on to the unconscious man.
By now Tony was well aware how Steve's tactical mind worked. "So we don't. Well, not until I've had my hands on their computers."
Engraved glass doors led into a cool atrium, tiled with intricate patterns of cool blues, greens and browns. Steve had never been in North Africa, but he had seen similar tiles in Spain, and was impressed by the craftsmanship and design. However, he didn't have long to study them, as a woman in chef's white came bustling in. Small, slim and neat, she oozed professionalism.
Steve thought about the Widow's interrogation technique, and grinned to himself. "Which one is the leader?" he asked Storm, who had been listening intently to Danvers, with an occasional nod of approval.
Two men were standing on the black marble platform that comprised the reception area. One of them was pointing his M4 towards the staff, all of whom, including the security officers –  who should have stopped these lunatics before they got in here, damn it, and there was sure as hell going to be an inquest about
Fandral gave him a very sharp look indeed. "Odin does not know all, just as Heimdall does not see all that passes on the Nine Worlds. Some things are hidden. Loki did not conjure the army that attacked Midgard, and equipping him with Infinity Stones was the act of a madman, madwoman, mad god, mad alien overlord, mad magician, whatever. Odin, I think, has his suspicions, but Huginn and Muninn do not talk to me."
With what was apparently an effort, the blond head lifted to look up into the glowing sensors of the Iron Man faceplate. "No. Be all right." It was little more than a whisper. "Heal fast. Fine in... couple hours. SHIELD..." His eyes closed and he made an attempt to shake his head. Tony could now see where the back of his leather jacket had been sliced across, edges stained crimson. Beneath it, he could see blood welling up from a cut that went deep into flesh.
Landing neatly on the roof of a nearby building, they leaned on the parapet, watching military and civilian workmen swarm around the silvery bulk of the downed Chitauri troop carrier.
Maybe he'd better just lie low for a while, let the serum heal his injuries, and learn all he could before deciding what to do.
Danvers exchanged glances with Steve. "This situation wouldn't involve a certain Lieutenant Storm, would it? Over."
"Mr Stark has no respect for motor vehicles – or, at least, for other people's motor vehicles," Happy replied, without even a flicker of a smile. Steve was beginning to suspect the nickname was ironic. "Ms Potts now, she appreciates good cars and good driving."
"You're rolling your eyes, aren't you?" Tony said. Then, "Let's go and find if our celebrity as superheroes, or at least yours as the symbol of American rectitude, will get us access to the footage. Otherwise I may have to get Jarvis to hack it."
He thought he'd known what was right. "A good man," Erskine had said and he'd clung to the words, seen himself as the hero. That belief had been swept away by Tony's tirade.
Steve took over the cooking, at first groping his way through the small selection of recipe books available but then showing increasing skill. That must have been something he had learned before the ice, like his ability to swim like a fish or to drive the SUV down the disused forest tracks at speed. He certainly could not have learned to play the video games to which Tony had introduced him, but his extraordinary reflexes and obviously high intelligence gave him advantages that Tony had to stretch his own long-term skills to their limits to counter.
With Jan's fists still locked in his shirt, Steve was forced to drop his shield and reach for a hold in order to save them both as the main hatch opened.
"I can tell when Nat's laughing at me. And Bruce says he can't risk staying here, and once he has the results from the experiment he's running, maybe he won't even be the Hulk any more. You're back with SHIELD too..."
There was movement in the mists, but what was causing it was never clear. Angry and frustrated, Steve let go of Xavier's hand, and tumbled down into the mists, seeking whatever was hidden there...
"Yes, sir." Though Jarvis hadn't any eyebrows to raise, Steve rather thought that if he had, he would have done so too.
Disappointed, Tony said, "Maybe this is a trap. I'll go up and take a look. Which is your apartment, Steve?"
Suit-and-sunglasses looked as if he was going to step in her path, glanced at Steve and decided against it. Instead he had to jog to keep up. "Yes, but it's not rele—"
"It's hard to be in love with a friend who is in love with someone else," Steve said. Ignoring her glare, he added, wryly, "I should know."
"I'll reimburse her then," Tony said, with a wink at Jan. "So I take it that that was why you locked yourself away in the lab while we were all out Avengering. I suspect you were more productive. Go on."
"Steve," Tony said, in warning, suddenly afraid of learning what that strange gun could do. He looked levelly at the Wakandan. "Who are you, masked man? Is this even Wakanda? My previous contacts were far more polite, even when hacking my computers or questioning me in dubious circumstances."
"You don't have to be here," Tony continued. Then, when Steve didn't answer: "Steve, I know you said you needed company, but I won't be offended if you go back to your own suite."
"Dr Henry Pym arrived back this afternoon. He and Jan have retired to their quarters and hung a metaphorical 'Do Not Disturb Unless the World is Ending' notice on the door. A pity Potts is no longer here. Watching her talk to him would be ideal."
Tony groaned. He must have fallen asleep in the lab again. He forced his eyes open to see a sleep-fuzzed face, topped by blond hair, looming over him.
So, when Jarvis announced that Clint Barton was calling from the Stark Tower, Tony felt nothing but relief.
The hands withdrew, and Tony whimpered in frustration, but there was the sound of a zip, a mutter of impatience from behind him, then a finger rimmed and penetrated, cool with lube...
"General Ross? Who just missed out being your father-in-law? We've met. I had the pleasure of throwing him out of a bar I'd just bought."
Tony took a deep breath, and made a decision he hoped he wouldn't regret. "Jarvis, make them aware that we know of their presence. Let them see the purchasing documents they were looking for and point them at those that show the amount of Palladium we've ordered. Also the initial specs – not the detail, just the outline – of the scaled up prismatic accelerators for the manufacture of – well, I guess we'd better stop calling it starkium or unobtainium or what-the-hellium so – vibranium. Let them see all our orders pertaining to it and our initial costings."
"Partly. It was a bit unfortunate that my hack set off the alarms and I had to fly out of the window carrying a Stark Industries minidrive. I thought for a while I was going to have to shout for help from Avengers' tower to rescue Betty – but she was talking with her father when the hack took place, so finally they let her go."
"Precisely because it would have taken a year, if you had agreed to see us at all. The guns got your attention. Also," Hennis grinned nastily, and Tony decided he preferred the blank look, "it sorta equalises the situation, you having one of the world's most advanced weapons at your disposal."
The man in black did not take his eyes from Steve, but, "My profound apologies, Mr Stark," he said. "If I hadn't given you reason to trust me, you would not have been tricked into coming here."
"Yeah, I guess." Steve was trying to sound positive; one or both of them had succeeded but that didn't mean that either was still alive.
Both of them, however, felt vulnerable as they stood before the noses of what Danvers had told him were C5 Galaxies – which now looked even larger close up.
"I'm aware you are, Tony. So how come the genius billionaire superhero just has a couple of robots and an AI butler in his workshop?"
"That's the one sure way to make sure it's pirated all over the world, and a future tactic for when we've made our money and improved it so much the competition will be forever playing catch-up. Also
Steve suspected a hammer would have done the job just as efficiently, but Tony did like blowing things up and it seemed a pity to spoil his fun.
Even as the pilot exited the aircraft and waved at Iron Man, now hovering above the sea, Tony was demanding "Is he armed, Jarvis?"
This time, when he unlocked and pressed the red button, the portal flared outwards, in Tesseract-blue. "That," he said, "is why leaving the enemy alive can help. Now, run!" He hauled his prisoner to his feet, grabbed a handful of uniform, and hurled him through the portal.
"You're a sonofabitch, Stark. And you know damn well I warned you about that nuke in the first place."
. Jarvis, put me on loudspeakers, volume up full." He took a deep breath, trying to hold panic at bay. "Attention! All residents, stay in your apartments. A ... powerful gas has been released on the fourth floor. Close your outer doors and use clothes or blankets to seal the cracks. Stay in your apartments, close to the windows, until help arrives."
"And it passed every test. No other arc reactor has shown any sign of instability. Still looks like sabotage to me, Fury, which is your expertise."
Scrubbing at his face, with his hands, Tony said, "O-kay, Jarvis, get Marilyn for me, send a message to Ms Potts that we're fine, and then I'll need to talk to the PR department. Special Projects in Seattle. And the wire services."
"I don't think so," Steve said, but there was a touch of uncertainty in his voice. "When was he born?"
"You saw how fast he's healing and how quickly his hair is growing back," he pointed out. "You missed out a SHIELD agent with a shaved head, by the way."
"Like Steve?" Damn it, had someone actually duplicated the serum? If they had samples of Steve's blood...
"Well, yes. Rushman asked to be put through on the secure line, because it was urgent that she speak to you, and if anyone knew how to contact you, it would be Potts. I said that if Potts knew, she wasn't talking to me. Rushman said Potts might talk to her. . I put her through , but, apparently, Potts didn't know how to contact you either."
"So," T'Challa said, after a moment of thought, "Mr Stark needs to contact his New York headquarters, via the internet. And if he is right and our enemies use a double-ended teleportation portal, perhaps a wormhole of some sort, to transport themselves and their equipment, we need to destroy all those situated here in Wakanda. Plainly there is one at the Research Centre, which suits me well as they will not expect me there. So we will breach that enemy stronghold and give Stark the access to the computers he needs at the same time."
"I'm fine," Steve snapped, in a voice muffled by the faceplate. "Except I can't breathe or think with all these flashing lights. How do you get the damn thing off?" He clasped the helmet in both hands.
"Jarvis!" Tony yelled, as rain hissed down in waves across the natural amphitheatre, bouncing from stone and skin. "Watch out!"
"Steve, they've been trying to steal my armour for years. I'm used to this. A different era and they'd be trying to nationalise Stark Industries too – not that that would do them much good. Most of the key subsidiaries are now registered overseas, and most of the StarkEnergy factories will be too, if the deals I'm working on come through. This is where I miss Dad," he added ruefully, "and even Obie, damn his black soul."
Through the evening Jarvis continued to work dealing with the malware downloaded onto Jan's minidrive, which he had pronounced to be the most sophisticated he had ever encountered. Tony retreated to the workshop where he was now working on upgrades to the armour. Steve suspected these were necessitated by this morning's underwater explosion, a speculation that made him anxious and touchy. Though Tony would welcome his company, even with the questions he wanted to ask, a nagging conscience (no doubt instigated by his mother's often voiced opinion) made it clear that it would be impolite to leave the Jan and Betty alone – and there was still the possibility that Betty was a security risk. So he accompanied them on their tour of the house and its many toys, but they were also edgy and found it impossible to settle, particularly when Jarvis interrupted to consult Betty on possible passwords.
The figure made its way to the window, where it hesitated, then pulled one of the drapes a few inches to one side and peered out.
Well, if he didn't give details within the next half hour, Steve resolved that he wouldn't allow him to leave the building.
"Express elevator's going up currently," Jan announced, staring at the indicators in exasperation. "In fact, all the elevators are going up. Jarvis?"
This wasn't, in itself, a worry for Steve, who was carrying nothing except his (not entirely legal) passport, cash, and a handkerchief. But if they were searching Tony...
"So what happened to the other one – the Soul Stone – the one I fought Clint over, the one on that hell planet—?"
Pepper was silent for a moment, then she said, "Only partially. SHIELD asked me to help them protect Tony – right from the start that was what Phil did. I just gave them enough help to keep him alive, or to try to keep him alive. I let them know where he was, what his plans were. But I didn't betray him, Steve. I just tried to... to keep him safe. And the government off his back. He... His ego won't let him see it that way."
"Perhaps. But right now— Wakanda— is— " The Panther took a deep breath to steady himself. " A group of mercenaries appeared right in the heart of Wakanda, and the Hatut Zeraze allied with them."
"Past our security. We didn't even realise the first one was gone until we reviewed the news footage of the battle but the last two just went missing overnight. The CCTV cameras show them there at midnight and gone at five minutes past."
Damn it, where had he pulled that one from? He was getting too fucking good at reading Tony's thoughts!
"I take it that's your mysterious billionaire – the guy you lease the dining room from," Steve said, once the call had safely ended.
On instinct, he spun, and hurled himself towards the roof edge. The heat beat at his back, right through the fire resistant armour Tony had built for him. His right foot hit the parapet and propelled him out and down.
"And gamma rays weren't vita rays," Tony said. "If they were, you wouldn't turn large and green. Besides, Dad and Erskine would have called them gamma rays because, you know, they were scientists and knew these things."
"I am sure she does, sir. On the day you defeated Loki and the Chitauri, the night she stayed here, Agent Romanoff loaded a data set onto my servers."
"Ha!" Relief overwhelmed Tony. Until now he hadn't realised how much he was depending on Steve joining the team. "You repaid any money SHIELD spent on you during the invasion. Cheapskates! We'll get the truck and go collect your stuff—"
Wait. He'd forgotten the World Security Council. If they knew what SHIELD knew then the information could be all over the world by now...
"Too bad. Thanks for the warning. I'll see you back in Manhattan." He killed the line with the flick of an eyelid.
As soon as the metal arm released its grip, he leaped away, swinging to face the man in the strange armour, ready to do battle, but with a bone¬ deep assurance that it wouldn't be necessary.
"You have my consent," Steve said, decidedly not crossing his fingers out of habit, because he wasn't certain if Xavier was telling the truth or if he was already probing. Time to check. "But if you can read my mind you must know that."
The cell where Tony and Steve had been held turned out merely to be the most palatial of many. Below the main building was what could only be described as a high tech dungeon, packed to overflowing with those loyal to T'Challa.
"Of course I can. I'm good. Shower sounds great." Though it cost him effort, he pulled himself free of a dubious-looking Stark's grip. With a shrug, the other man led the way out of the circular room and into what was plainly a well-equipped workshop.
The other intruder, a huge individual whose head was topped by a buzz cut so short it looked as if someone had sprayed his scalp black, still had his Heckler and Koch shouldered.
, who is more than human, opted for human oversight. And he is worthy to lift Thor's hammer, unlike either of us."
Tony put a hand on Steve's shoulder, squeezed it briefly, and then retreated to a bench in the sunlight, watching surreptitiously.
There was good wine, though Steve noticed – because he worried a little about the amount Tony drank – that his companion was sampling both it and the food in moderation, almost abstinence for him.
Who wasn't going to answer that one. But it was obvious that Jan wasn't going to keep that information to herself, and Steve was looking distinctly uncomfortable.
"Can we trust this T'Challa?" Natasha asked now, her eyebrows up in her own special brand of scepticism.
"You think it might be into space? Another dimension?" Betty asked, her voice shaking just a little, though she was trying to be casual.
"Let's hope it doesn't come to that. But I'm not concerned about Captain Rogers." There was the slightest stress on the 'I'.
"Oh, one of Hank's cronies." Tony hoped he had managed the right dismissive note. "That can wait. I need to shower, change and get the Bots working on new armour. Nat, Barton, I suggest you do the same. Well, not the working on the armour, obviously. Thor, I'll show you to your apartment. Unless gods don't need to bathe or sleep."
He found Tony sprawled face down on the decaying leather couch shoved against a wall in the darkest corner of the workshop. It was the only piece of furniture that wasn't both new and pristine that Steve had seen anywhere in the Tower. DUM-E was standing – crouching – parked – whatever – beside it, waving an equally threadbare comforter in its mechanical hand.
"Well, that's a new one. I've never been charged with kidnapping before." Maybe he could head this off at the pass. Tony turned and looked back at the reception desk, to the security guards who were plainly very, very uneasy and snapped his fingers. "You, check whether a Steven Rogers has entered this building in, oh, say the last month. How is that spelled, by the way? V or PH? Rogers with or without the D? Never mind, there aren't that many iterations. Check them all, including all name combinations, with or without the initial, just so we don't miss a trick."
"New York," Steve said. "Philadelphia. Washington. Boston. Airports closed. Planes grounded. Power out. Water and sewerage out. All emergency services struggling to cope. National Guard called in. Military mobilisation."
"And Zemo knew his trigger word. But isn't that something that you should have anticipated? Or at least considered before you took on the world? After all, you knew – better than anyone – that even if he wasn't completely the Winter Soldier any more, he wasn't wholly James Barnes either."
Thor shook his head. "Me. Though it appears to be common to the sons of Odin." He folded his huge hands around Tony's on the beer glass. "The love between warriors – shield brothers and sisters – is a thing I have experienced more than once. But the first... He was less than fifty years older than I, a great warrior, the bravest of us all, and the best of Asgard. He was dearer to me than any other. Then one day he was gone, and no one knew how or where. We – the Warriors Three and Loki and I searched for him – but that was many years ago. My regret, which I hold to this day, is that I never shared his bed, never dared to act or ask. I do not think he would have refused me, but I chose for him. You understand what I am saying?"
They were flung to the ground, Steve protecting the pilot with his body, and their heads with his shield. The Wasp was clinging to its straps as the shock wave rolled over them. Steve hoped it wasn't going to break any of the windows in the house, because it had been his decision to let the aircraft through and he had a feeling that any one of those windows cost more than everything he had ever owned. Tony would be furious...
"That is the arrangement. I drive you to the border, and Hunter here accompanies me there and back here, no doubt with that gun at my head." He bowed with deep irony to Steve, with a wide gesture towards the vehicle in which he had, presumably, arrived. "Lead the way, brother."
Pepper wouldn't be there, even if she hadn't already left; she wasn't really comfortable in his workshop, and found Dum-E and U disconcerting companions. Steve, on the other hand had accepted the bots as something only to be expected in the twenty-first century.
When he'd seen him in that block of ice he'd felt pity – and the reminder that a reputedly 4F guy had been subjected to a super-soldier process, cured of all his ills and transformed into human perfection had given him the idea that he might be able to cure himself using Extremis.
Tony's knife continued its precise clatter against the board. "According to Dr Henry Pym you have Captain America's DNA, and, according to Dad, you have his powers and skill set."
Tony reached for the car phone and speed dialled '2' ('1' was Pepper and always had been.) "Hi, Jarvis."
Though every breath hurt, that pain wasn't centred on the arc reactor, not even when he put a hand to it and pressed against it.
Even as he was speaking, there was mechanical hiss and light flooded the room. A red-and-gold vaguely humanoid collection of metal bulleted through the gap that had appeared in the wall.
"So, what are we celebrating?" he asked, because that was most certainly the exact opposite of what Tony was doing, and the answer might be illuminating.
Jarvis's voice changed, becoming deeper, but distorted: "Mr Stark: Our sincere apologies. Your expertise is admirable. We are hopeful we will be able to say the same about your motives. Until then, remember we'll be watching."
Which way? He didn't think the wizards would have been so stupid as not to set some kind of magical alarm system or even a ... what did they call it? Fence? Ward? There was little hope of getting away at street level without being spotted. But out of one of the top floor windows, or the roof? Time to do a little exploring.
"Oooh. Touchy. Well, I got into the computer in General Ross's office and downloaded the hard drive and whatever was stored in the Cloud. I must say your personal toys are even better than those you put on the market, Mr Billionaire Genius. The data is encrypted and probably crammed with viruses – virii? – so I figured I'd better consult you before accessing it."
Tony thought. But it wasn't worth the effort speech would cost. Something else was. "Steve," Tony said, or rather, whispered, because it seemed his voice wasn't working properly. "Tell him... before he... does something stupid."
Tony's pulse was thundering in his ears. "He isn't." His voice seemed to come from someone else. "He's never coming back. He... he's dead. I led us straight into a trap, and these damn fools followed and now Bruce is missing too. I was in too much of a fucking hurry, but Earth's vulnerable, we're all vulnerable, and it takes too long to synthesise vibranium and we just don't have the time—"
Once the introductions were complete, Tony called the meeting to order. "T'Challa," he said, "you plainly didn't come here to sample our hospitality, so—"
Ahead of them, the sky was now black with clouds, but not the great anvils of thunderclouds or an opaque iron-grey ceiling heavy with rain. Instead, low-level billows were being whipped into ragged streamers by the wind, flowing to the north-west.
Assuming she was speaking of Loki, of whom she still appeared fond, Steve held back any further questions.
"That's odd," Tony said. "I would have thought this 'anti-herb-poison’ trait would be spread fairly widely through the population of the Panther tribe and probably quite a few others by now."
As the helicopter moved in for a closer view, the sound of its engine faltered. It swayed dramatically from side to side, losing height all the time. The blades of the rotor were suddenly visible as the machine began to spin around the rotor mast.
He'd never stayed anywhere so expensive before, though he'd visited Howard's suite in Claridges (and perhaps Stark Industries still kept that, though God only knew how much it cost nowadays) and had become used to the luxury of Stark (or the Avengers) Tower.
Tony settled himself against Steve's shoulder. "Thass com'rtable," he said, suddenly sounding far less sober. "Dad ... was ... right 'bout you. Really."
"Loads of it on tap up there. Remember that this is Tony's plane and he has been known to fly it himself. But coffee isn't going to help you sleep."
"Jarvis, shields on full power." Even as he spoke Tony was throwing up his hands, palms outward, repulsors flaring, spinning in mid-air as he tried to counter all of the incoming saws? cutters? dissectors?
He could still see tall buildings lit up in the distance, and strings of lights that marked a bridge. The buildings on the horizon on his right formed a skyline that held a vague familiarity, but that might just be that he had seen pictures of something like it.
He nodded, and said to the visitors, "Make yourselves at home, why don't you? Pepper keeps her booze in the filing cabinet – which is, of course, the only reason to have a filing cabinet—" He was cut off by the closing door as Pepper herded him out of the room.
Maybe a third of the HUD was back now, though there was still no contact with Jarvis. Tony thought that the AI must have been wiped from the armour's memory, though he had built in enough safeguards that it would have taken something very powerful to delete him.
"I'm fine, Cap, really. Just covered in gunk." And his stomach was hurting as it sometimes did when fear clenched his muscles.
This left Steve free to head for the workshop. Tony, it appeared, had finished working on the armour, though his manufacturing bots had not, but he made no protest when Steve herded him upstairs to the master bedroom.
He needed to do that, because the floor was pooled with blood, in which lay bodies and limbs and, Christ, a severed head—
The said Miss Potts – and he was sure now it must be Miss Potts – gave a small exasperated sigh. "You mean he's deliberately pissing him off. You're well out of that, Captain, though being a spectator can be fun and seeing Tony lose occasionally is always worthwhile." She offered her hand. "I'm Pepper Potts."
"My behaviour is always questionable," Tony said lightly. "Now, hand over that will and go find me a couple of witnesses while I read it, and we'll get it signed."
"My God," he said. "It's a secret base. Just like in the comics. Howard had a secret base. What did he do here, Tony?"
Bruce and Tony looked at each other. Though Tony saw little more than a pale blur where Bruce's face should be, he didn't need to read his expression. He grabbed for the passenger door of the SUV as Bruce circled to the driver's side.
"Hush." Jan drew the blanket over him. "Humour me. Rest. You don't have to sleep if you don't want to..."
"You promised me that you'd help me get the Avengers back together," Tony interrupted. Then, at Steve's surprised eyebrow, "I wasn't
"Or in," Tony corrected him. "There's someone out there with a device that can create teleportation portals. Something more like the Stargate than a Star Trek transporter."
"Is that all of it? Why we're here? Really? I'm not stupid, Tony. Aren't you going to tell me the rest of it?"
But below them the ground was dark for several hundred yards, apart from the lights of SHIELD vehicles, blurred by falling dust.
Because he knew that no one could hear him, not even the ever-present Jarvis, he screamed in rage and terror.
He was damn sure that when T'Challa had left them alone and headed off into the mountain to 'meditate' he had been spying on their enemies... or looking for a way to do so.
He was interrupted by his cell phone's standard ring. Which was odd because Jarvis was monitoring the number and only letting through calls from a select list, all of which had identifying ring tones.
"Hank's experiments started because he's obsessed with trying to communicate with ants," Janet van Dyne had said, those months ago, over dinner in an exclusive Manhattan restaurant that was now rubble.
Now she was lifting her head, and no one could mistake the metal that encased her arms for anything but weaponry...
Illyana suddenly lifted her head. "Someone comes," she said, in a voice that held more than a trace of a Russian accent.
"It was your idea to use me as a distraction," Steve pointed out. "And you've patched up worse injuries to my back."
"She— Okay, I guess I understand why she did that, but then it's her job to be concerned with the SI Board and the stock market and to make money. I have a wider concern: I want clean energy available to everyone in the world. God knows, there's enough profit involved from the Electronics division and Repulsor Technology division for her."
"What Peggy was doing here in the first place?" Steve asked, putting his hovering doubts into words. "The woman I knew wouldn't have wanted to live in a place like this, even if she could afford it."
There was less than five seconds pause, then Jarvis said, "They appear to have lost them, but are still searching, sir."
Beyond the door, a man in golden armour stood waiting on a raised dais at the centre of the Observatory, his eyes the same colour as his armour, his skin as dark as the abyss below the Bifrost. Thor strode towards him, with Steve drawn along in his wake.
He should have been excited about her being here, had been excited about the private movie party to come, but his father's announcement had left him feeling flat and empty.
"I didn't, until you just confirmed it. But we'd discussed the possibility. We just didn't want to believe they'd risk Steve's life with that gas—"
"One hundred and twenty-two minutes ago I became aware that the number of SHIELD agents watching the tower had been increased from the standard two to twenty-three and that they had been supplemented by what appears to be an unidentified army unit," Jarvis stated. "So far they have not attempted to enter or to interfere with visitors or staff. When it was plain you were not ready to handle the matter, I alerted Ms Van Dyne, or rather, the Wasp. She is reconnoitering."
"Won't that be harder, now he's dead?" Clint asked, leaning his chair on its back legs and putting his feet on the table.
He had meant to say it aloud, but that didn't seem possible. Nor was it a name, but a broadcast of recognition.
Tony groaned and shook his head. "I asked for that, didn't I? Come on, stir your bones, old man." Somehow or other, he unfastened the sword-belt and, leaving the sword propped against the wall, hauled Steve to his feet and half-carried him to the master bedroom.
Tony spun about, just in time to see the steps withdrawing into the rock. With a yell, he leaped upwards, aiming to boost himself off a half-withdrawn step. The strip of light from above vanished. He hit the wall, scrabbled for a hold, caught an edge with a toe, and then was falling back down into the dark.
That having been taken care of, he felt able to take notice of his surroundings. The bathroom was bigger than the main room of the apartment he and his mother had lived in before the war... before she'd died... before everything changed. It was white and black, with touches of scarlet, which appealed to his sense of form and colour, and looked almost more futuristic than the Helicarrier control room. The shower stall, for instance – well, he presumed it was a shower stall and he really, really wanted a shower right now – was bare of any sort of controls, and he couldn't even see the shower heads, unless they were the tiny metal objects buried in the tiles.
"Okay, Jarvis," he said. "Let's take a final look at those specs before I transmit them to Seattle. And I'll need a base on the West Coast for a while. Have the Malibu house prepped."
Beyond lay more forest. At the head of the valley were cliffs riven both vertically and horizontally –
Later that night, while Steve slept, Tony, wearing the Iron Man gauntlets, wrapped the artefact tightly in plastic and threw it in the lake.
He could hardly deny it. "Been kinda lightheaded..." he admitted. "Serum was supposed to take care of all those things. Maybe it's wearing off."
"My loyalties are divided? What about yours? Where am I on your list?" Pepper shot back angrily. "This... this obsession was bad enough when it was just Iron Man – I could live with that – but this Avengers thing – and Steve—"
And Tony resented that both on behalf of his creations and the calls on Steve's time; he missed him when he wasn't around, even as he made clucking noises whenever he appeared.
"You both will regret it. For however long you live; one day or a thousand years. I know you are a man to take risks but this is not one. From what I have seen, Steven is as committed to you as I am to Jane."
He hadn't thought it was possible for T'Challa to look shifty, but that was the case right now. "I have spoken to Hunter," he said evasively. "He shared information important to us both. He was... misguided."
As Tony's voice cut out abruptly, Steve reached the first landing, slammed his shield against the emergency door and burst through into the lobby of Tony's suite where Iron Man was down and struggling to get to his feet as a man wearing yellow, who seemed to be phasing in and out of sight, leaned down to press something metallic and vaguely gun-shaped against his helmet.
There was an envelope propped up against the water bottles. Tony goggled at it, particularly as it had his name on it in a clear hand that almost certainly did not belong to one of the scientists. No one wrote to him on anything longer than a Post It, unless it was something that needed his signature.
When Steve woke again he was feeling much better; well enough to get out of bed without falling over and make his way into the bathroom before his bladder decided that, super-soldier serum or not, it was going to have to release or burst.
Tony burst out laughing. "You couldn't be more wrong," he said, with a bitterness he wasn't ready to explain to Steve.
He had checked Jarvis's security again, this time hoping that he would find that elusive back door in the AI's programming (and, damn it, SHIELD had been able to override Jarvis's protocols before) but without much hope. Jarvis already knew many things that SHIELD and the government would love to steal, including the atomic structure of vibranium and the identities he had created for the Black Widow and Hawkeye. Those, as far as he could tell, remained secure.
The stones – well, five of them – were present in his mind, but the menace was gone, and the Soul Stone... well, wherever that was, it didn't matter any longer.
Tony put his hand on the wall, and the hidden number pad glowed. His fingers flew swiftly across the virtual keys before the gunmen had time to take in what he was doing and the elevator doors opened even as the glow of the pad faded away.
"—so I got Illyana to teleport me, Scott and Hank to your house," Jean was saying in her ordinary voice. "I knew immediately you weren't there, but Tony's – hi, Tony – father was." She grinned happily at him. "He had taken refuge in your armoury because of two people trying to get in. One of them was Doctor Doom—
"I've been in worse places," Steve said, with a shrug. "Conditions below won't restrict me the way they will the armour. And I've seen you take on Thor. Go."
Then Jan burst out of the dust cloud, running from whatever lay within it. She jinked to avoid Steve, then swerved around Tony before disappearing through the door to Hank's lab.
That Steve, who had grown up in abject poverty, had been reduced to it again was almost more than he could bear. Even if they could not come to terms today – and he was going to use every weapon he had to make that happen and it looked as if Steve might be vulnerable to sex, if nothing else – he was going to haul him out of that pit.
But suddenly it wasn't Steve standing there, arms folded on his chest; it was Captain America, with a half smile on his lips, and determination on his face. "Give Director Fury my compliments on his ingenuity, and on your loyalty," he said.
"No one has been able to own a human being in this country for over a hundred and fifty years," Roberta stated, dark eyes blazing with repressed anger, though her voice remained calm. "No one gets to have slaves anymore and as for Captain Rogers – well, if he still lives, his stint with the army ended a long time ago. And you are not the US Army. You have been high handed with other people and other people's property before now, General. I suggest you take care before riding rough-shod over human rights in the future."
"Captain Rogers is still missing," White Wolf interrupted. "I understand he is far more dangerous than Stark, at least when the latter is stranded without the Iron Man armour. I suggest your men find him and let me deal with Stark."
He said; "For fuck's sake, Rogers, this is one way you won't hurt me. Now, for Christ's sake, get on with fucking me." He wriggled his ass for emphasis.
Steve watched his expression, suspecting Tony was waiting for condemnation. "I guess you had a good reason."
"Loki is imprisoned in Asgard," Thor said, his voice calm and level. "Nor would whoever lent him that army try the same tactics after such a defeat, even if they had access to the Tesseract. Which they do not. And it is as well they do not. We have enemies enough on Midgard."
Dr Elizabeth Ross was quite possibly the most beautiful woman Tony had ever met, so beautiful that he actually caught his breath at his first sight of her, and hurriedly lifted the faceplate, as Jan flew down from his shoulder to resume her normal size.
He felt useless without access to either the Iron Man, Jarvis or, indeed, any computer. His fingers itched for a keyboard, for his holographic displays. He'd give anything right now for a crap tablet or even, God help him, an iPhone, though if anyone at Apple ever heard about it they'd never let him live it down...
Even with such gloomy thoughts to accompany him, running was preferable  to being in Tony's house without Tony.
Inside the armour, Steve was shaking with terror. When this was over he was going to give Tony the tongue-lashing of his life, but right now he wanted to grab him and fly him hundreds of miles from danger. Except that he no longer had control of the Iron Man armour. Not that he had had much control of it before.
"You think I won't give it back?" Though he was considering the idea right now. "I'm hurt by your lack of trust. Not that you're encouraging me to trust you—"
Steve was seated on a stool in the middle of the display, the hologram lights playing over his skin and hair, making him look a little exotic, a little otherworldly. Tony paused, allowing himself a not-exactly-innocent moment of appreciation, then moved forward into the circle.
"Nope. Gold/titanium alloy but I'm negotiating vibranium. Thor's hammer is, apparently." Thor hadn't mentioned this titbit to the Avengers, but he had told Selvig, who had told SHIELD and Jarvis had dug it out of their databases. "I guess you're also an Asgardian?"
Once Tony had settled in, Steve reached for the yellowing sketch pad and pencils he had found tucked away at the bottom of a chest of drawers. He had discovered, much to his surprise, that he could draw.
"You don't scream like that for a tumble. I could hear you in the house. Nor does every computer in the place scream with you. Not your heart?"
"That was a couple of hours ago. One of the things Storm texted was the reference of the flight he'd been loaded onto. He thought it was heading for Vandenberg, which would make a lot of sense."
He flew North over a city plunged into darkness, grey clouds swirling above, car headlights the only sign of electricity below. Over on Manhattan Island, Tony could see the faint glow of Stark Tower, but even that seemed dimmed.
Okoye's grimaced. "That was also my thought. But I when went to question them, each one lay dead in his cell."
Which wasn't what he wanted at all. He gritted his teeth and squirmed even harder against his bonds, glaring at where T'Challa was standing. Something about his eyes told Tony he was aware... but of what? Of the fact that he was helpless? That he was aiding his enemies? That Steve—
He smiled his best public persona smile. "Stop by at Stark Tower some time and I'll repay you for this lifesaver with even better booze and a long conversation. Right now, though, I have to rescue my CEO from Fury's clutches." He downed the rest of the Bourbon and handed the cup back to the sergeant. "Ciao."
"I wish I had that much faith in my probity," Tony said wryly. "But... but... if you believe that..."
Panic gripped him. As his feet hit mud, he kicked out frantically, arms and legs flailing in desperate attempt to reach the surface.
Steve, on the other hand, was leaning against the wall beside the door, just as Thor had done the day before. Even the clothes and the posture were similar. Thor had been slightly more intimidating, though, if only because of the hammer.
Tony raised an eyebrow at Natasha, who said, "I may have some ideas, but put it in words of one syllable, if you're capable of it."
"I would not say no to meat and ale," Thor admitted. "Your hospitality would be most welcome, but I have to find Jane."
"You said it was urgent, Jarvis," Steve replied, deciding to picture the AI as a balding, slightly rotund man in a butler's formal suit, as it made it easier for him to talk to the... thing.
He dived down into it, twisting onto his side so the orientation was less disturbing. The blueprints, scanned from his Dad's construction files, laid out his path.
Iron Man reached out with a gauntlet clad hand, plucked one of the guns pointed vaguely in his direction from the hands of a SHIELD agent and casually bent the barrel with a twist of his fingers. "I don't take chances with 'fragile'."
"They were brought here on false pretences, in my name. Effectively," he added, as Tony started to protest. "They have already provided much needed information about how our enemies reached Wakanda."
"Not exactly. Betty located her father, and we went in – and then Avengers' Tower didn't seem like a good place to run, which left Malibu and Tony. And we damn near didn't make it, except you were there and so plainly in love with Tony that I could have cheered."
The whole compound looked to be in chaos, with warriors running and dogs barking as the alarms sounded. But that, Steve saw immediately, was deceptive; the warriors were moving with purpose to pre-arranged stations. This wasn't panic, but a planned response.
"And if she was here I'd say the same things to her," Tony told him. "Meanwhile, are you hungry? Thirsty?"
And he and Steve should be helping with the rescue but, fuck it, Iron Man and Captain America would be no more use... less use... than the first responders and SHIELD agents. "We can't let them have Natasha and Clint."
"Their credentials appear to be legitimate. I have accessed the UN, diplomatic press and FBI computers and they confirm the identities."
Tony whirled to face him. "You're very free with my name when you haven't told us yours," he said coldly. "Who the hell are you, mystery man?"
"Yes, I did," Tony said. "And I'll still be very angry unless you promise me you won't do that ever again."
The warrior winced again, rubbing his face with his hands. His eyes avoided Tony's. "I know you are. As for myself, I do not know. I don't remember, but I knew, the moment I saw him on the television during the attack on New York, that I must protect him, just as I knew to be afraid of the one you all fought."
Tony rather hoped they might be distracted by the sight of a shirtless Captain America – he certainly was – but he didn't expect shock.
Tony nodded. "He's driving the truck and it's his phone I have a lock on. And Thor knows him. Jarvis, put him through."
Two men came barrelling out of the pavilion and passed her on either side. One was carrying a gun that was all too familiar from encounters in Wakanda, the other – and he was tall and powerful, taller and more powerful than Steve, perhaps even as tall as Thor – was pulling a long bright sword from its scabbard.
Maybe someone not as familiar with Jarvis as Steve would not have noticed that overly careful phrasing.
"This isn't a fighter," Tony retorted as he spun the wheel. "And I don't have a rear gunner... gun, gun..." It was so long since he'd driven this car he'd forgotten the extra that had come with this particular vehicle when he'd bought it from a Mafia boss who was heading for jail. "There's a handgun in a secret compartment under the dash though, damn it, I've forgotten the code I need to release—"
He bears Natasha’s prodding for a little longer before he pours food for Liberty and heads to the showers to wash off his ache for the night. It’s not quite disappointment that the date didn’t work out – more of an exhaustion. How much longer does he have to try to find someone who thinks he’s worth it? Someone who won’t run when he mentions why he needs Liberty?
“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have shouted," Steve says in a more level tone, "but the man I fell in love with would never have signed that contract.”
“Still awake,” Tony says, taking care not to breathe in too deep. His stomach won’t appreciate having the cracked armor pierce even deeper.
There’s a shaft of light breaking through the dark that lets Tony glimpse Steve’s closed eyes, and the trace of blood dripping onto his brow. Steve had fallen on his front, having shoved Tony away from the falling pillar – they had been the last two people in the building after rescuing the hostages from MODOK – and Tony finds some irony that Steve’s act of trying to save him might be what saves Steve.
Despite everything - the sharp pain of being left behind, the bitter acid that after all the years of hiding his friendship, Howard preferred Steve's new body over Tony, and the sting that Steve might have been in a league with Howard all these years - despite everything, there had been a sense of
" Maria's voice is small, sad, and Steve would be too if his family was this fractured. "We'll be flying out for Christmas."
"The last time I said I was fine," Tony put his hands on his hip, equally adamant, "you forced me to get patched up too."
“If you – if you lift the slab off Steve, it’s going to drive the rebar through me,” he closes his eyes. He can do this. A trade, an equation, a balance. “And if you try to move the rebar, it’s going to change the slab’s center of gravity.”
Alright, then. If his bots are being rebellious, he can make his own coffee on his own damn machine. He braces himself on a table as he stands, wincing as his back flares in protest at the movement. Rolling his shoulders doesn’t help much. It only makes the base of his neck ache as much as his head.
Steve looks down, unable to meet those knowing eyes. “Thank you,” he says. Whether it’s for the door or for taking care of Tony all these years, Steve can’t decide.
use the private kitchen on his floor of the Tower, but the communal kitchen is the one all the Avengers congregate to each morning and Colonel Rhodes’ visit hasn’t changed that.
Peggy spins her chair towards the door. "Now, Steve," she clasps her purse. "I know more than you think and less than you fear."
“But he's got a point,” Tony raises his voice over the music of the bar, louder now that Clint has taken over the old music box. “Hard to have fun when you've got 12-hour shifts.”
“Okay,” Tony nods. “Did I do something wrong? I remembered our anniversary, didn’t I? I distinctly remember getting you a – ”
“Oh?” The hope curling in Tony's stomach sparks into a warmer wish, scalding hot as he tries to stamp it down.
Settling into his usual chair at the corner of the kitchen island, Steve waits for Colonel Rhodes to finish using the stove. Sure, Steve
Rhodey rubs his temples wearily, the video feed blurring for a second. "If the Ten Rings think we're not searching for him, that might make them less cautious."
“But this man you’ve become?” Steve finishes with none of his earlier bitterness. Only an aching tiredness that echoes itself in the hollows of Tony’s heart. “I don’t know who you are or who you’re pretending to be. I just know that the Tony Stark I loved would never have let this happen. And I know that
Steve itches to call Agent Morse for a confirmation that Tony is doing alright under her watch, delivering yet another speech at some obscure science conference. It's hard to let Tony out of sight when tensions run high like this, and even harder to hide the high tensions from Tony, who would only want to do his best to help. But having Tony's help would mean putting an even greater target on Tony's back.
Jarvis is as immaculately dressed as ever, red tie bright against his polished black suit. It sends Steve reeling to hear his name said in that calming British tone, but this time colder, more calculated.
Then he gets to work: flip off the sprinklers to keep the room from flooding before the fire reaches them. Use the water on the floor to soak up the spare baby blankets in the cabinet and clog the gap beneath the door.
“Thank me by not ruining my good work, Captain. No fighting fires for you tomorrow. Doctor's orders.”
The serum could have saved so many others. It saved Steve instead - another burden that he has to carry, all the hearts and dreams of everyone who could've been him.
. His mind drifts to Ty and Sunset, who was in his room, their heads bent over the latest magazines.
. "If you wanted to piss Howard off for me, there's about a million one other things I can suggest you do."
“There's no harm in admitting pain,” Tony holds onto Steve's wrist. Even there, Tony can feel the hard muscle from what must be years of training.
It’s a trend, a repeated experiment to confirm the consistency of the truth. Tony is, first and foremost, a scientist. He prods at things to figure out how they work. Sometimes, things blow up.
I always notice when you’re trying to hide something,” Steve can’t help the fondness that slips into his words. He slips an arm around Tony’s shoulder, pulling him close. “What aren’t you telling me?”
Only then does the realisation finally, visibly sink into Tony. The insides of his cheeks are bitten: nervousness warring with excitement. "We’re really doing this," Tony slowly says, as if testing the words. "You’re not joking."
From his pocket, Tony takes out – that’s Steve’s compass. The one Tony had given him a year ago. He had been looking for it yesterday, and he takes it gratefully, fingers catching on the engraving in its back.
“No. Whenever I take a date – a friend home,” Steve feels his cheeks warm, and he hides it by going to scratch the back of Liberty’s ears. “She barks at them. Really aggressively. I don’t know if it’s my PTSD getting to her or not.”
The sea continues to crash below them, persistent and unyielding. There's a metaphor somewhere, but right now it's just him at Steve at the precipice of everything. "Hundred percent."
There's a time for fighting each other, and there's... the small downward twist to Tony's lips, the slight bounce to his leg that betrays his unhappiness, nervousness, uncertainty.
Steve files that away for later. The most important things first. He knows Rhodey has been using JARVIS' satellite help to scan the deserts, but Steve can't only sit here not doing something concrete to actually find Tony. "JARVIS, can you do a scan of smoke in the area around Tony's last location? Especially at night time, any particles associated with smoke."
Tony flails, pushing himself off Steve's chest to stare at him, eyes blown impossibly wide. “Are you — you're seriously — this isn't — ”
He fishes his phone out again, searching for the Marvin Gaye soundtrack Sam had recommended. There's news about the next Yankees game. His eye snags on the article beneath it, and he clicks on the headline, grateful for the distraction. The latest development in the Stark inheritance case. Stane was contesting large sum of money Maria Stark left for her son Tony, who –
“Keep up, Captain,” Bruce says, a smirk curling his lips up into a rare smile. “Stark's the second-smartest man of the century.”
Steve crosses his arms. Tony should have a hundred better things to do than attempting to drive Steve into madness. “Why aren’t you outside?”
That somehow hurts more than the rebar in his stomach, or the sharp edges of the suit piercing his flesh there.
"This is too much, Mrs. Rogers," Tony swallows back his memories of Maria serving tea to her guests. Or at least, Jarvis serving tea for her, and her sneaking some onto Tony's plate.
The part of Steve that can still ache hurts for Tony, and more pieces fall into place. Those questions he hadn’t been brave enough to ask were answered by the foreboding black door before him.
“You deserve it,” Sam gives Liberty a fond pat, eyeing the rest of the dogwalkers in the park. He nods his chin to a particularly burly man with a chihuahua. “What about him?”
Tony swirls his tea, adding two more sugars to it. If he can't have coffee, some sweetness will have to do.
Steve tries his damnedest to wrap his head around the schematics in Tony's private servers, shifting through something that resembles a new repulsor-tech vehicle called a 'Helicarrier', a flying medevac bay for disaster relief.
"Alright." There's a time for pushing, and a time for prioritising. "Do you need me to sing some more?"
To the public, Steve was merely one more of Tony Stark's faceless rotation of bodyguards. Without the cowl and with some hairgel, Steve became far less recognisable as a Medal of Honor hero.
Natasha slides him his cup of black coffee with more shots in it than Tony administered in a day. It isn't the best thing for his heart condition, but Natasha knows his limits, and she offers him the smallest smile. “Afternoon, Tony.”
"I can come by the mansion again," Steve offers, "or grab that coffee you promised me to discuss what we've found with the flashdrive from Pepper."
Steve takes a deep breath. The holotable in front of him flashes with two images. He taps on the left one, with an extensive network of old caves.
His heart aches. He hates this part of the job, hates seeing Tony hurt when he's supposed to be resting. "JARVIS, give me a piano melody." Steve doesn't have to tell him which one. The first quiet notes start, and Steve hums.
“I eat pineapples on pizza just for you,” Tony grumbles. He curls up around Steve’s side, ending up with his head in Steve’s lap and glaring at Steve with the slightest pout.
If Tony were to be entirely honest, he enjoyed goading Steve into a fight because it felt nice to know that there was still someone who
Investors simply didn't trust the young Tony Stark to be the CEO, especially not when Tony was cultivating a reputation for drunkenness.
"Maria," the Secretary lifts her hand to his lips. "The queen of New York herself. I rest easy knowing your son leads us all to greatness."
"Is this entire building clear?" A plan starts to form, snippets of old conversations coming to light through desperation. Mentions of vibranium, Howard's hunt to synthesize it, Captain America's skill with it.
Blowing up weapons wouldn't erase the groups who bought the weapons, but it was a way to keep the weapons out of the wrong hands, to at least break a link in the chain of death he was causing.
“Marry me,” Tony’s words are muffled by the food in his mouth, but Steve’s sharp ears pick them up anyway, and he freezes as he hears Rhodes huff.
"My boy," Obie holds both arms wide in greeting. "What're you doing down here? I thought Whitney was in town?"
By the time he gets back to the hospital half an hour later, there’s another doctor and another ambulance. The doctor’s badge reads
“Do you lure unsuspecting patients to do your paperwork for you?” he asks blandly as he fills out the details of the accident, peeking from over the top of the clipboard to gauge the doctor’s reaction.
“You don’t get to threaten Steve because you want my weapons,” Tony goes straight to the heart of this game, tired of beating around the bush.
Sarah slots her hand over Tony's, the reinforced casing of the flashdrive pressing into their palms. "I'm taking it only to give you peace of mind. And if
wish that his mother wasn't getting sick more often, wasn't coughing every five minutes or so, her lungs giving her trouble.
Steve starts to reply, but another knock on the window stops him. Sam is pointing down, his words urgent. "I see someone!"
“Stop making the gardener’s life harder,” Steve crosses his arms when he finds Tiberius, Sunset, and Tony pulling out flowers in the garden. This isn’t the first time he’s stood toe to toe against them.
does he have one knee on the floor, right there kneeling beside Tony’s hospital bed and holding up a goddamned pudding cup?
His hand hovers over Tony's arm: Tony is curled up on his side, facing away from Steve. There's sweat collecting on his temples, jerky movements and whispered pleas that are too soft for even Steve to hear.
"Ms. Potts and I both agree you need more rest - you wouldn't even stay in the hospital for more than a week."
More question than statement, Steve doesn’t let it sting as much as it used to. Better to be Tony’s dirty secret than something that could destroy him.
Natasha tosses Tony a packet of blueberries during movie night, and Tony smacks a kiss on her cheeks. “Marry me, Nat.”
crying, but he makes sure he isn’t heard, makes sure his words are steady so he doesn’t add to their pain. “I love you too,” Tony says the words slowly to keep his voice from breaking. “Tell that to Steve for me?”
“The flowers were, uh, Ty and Sunset don’t know, but I was weeding out the bad stalks,” he confesses. “They thought I was ruining the garden so they wanted to help.”
He can build a bomb in his sleep a hundred times better than Hammer, disarming one just needs - he reaches into his pocket, throws out an empty gum wrapper, and finds his handy pocket knife.
Tony is in the process of making miniaturised pacemakers that can last more than two decades. Little Maria was the first baby to receive it. A thin filament that's keeping her heart beating. She's a fragile thing, but when she hears Tony greet her, her brown eyes open, small fingers reaching out for Tony beyond the glass.
here," Rhodey tries, motioning with his free hand for Steve to come even closer. "Do you mind if he helps me get you in the chopper?"
Steve is much less concerned when the ambulance rolls to a stop in front of SHIELD Memorial’s curb. He’s not looking forward to it, per se, not when it means someone's been injured. Only that if he has to drop by the hospital, it’s nice to have a friendly face he knows.
Except, the bedroom's lights shine brighter and knuckles rap on the open door. "Tony. Steve," Obie greets them both, already dressed sharply in a matching suit.
That’s more like Tony. Grand gestures that Steve has learned to see through, spotting the small careful details Tony puts into each of them. “But you couldn’t wait?” Steve teases.
"I know I'm crazy," Tony forces the door open, "but I'm pretty sure you're going to get us arrested."
The lady stands up to extend a hand, her fingernails painted as red as her hair, her flowery dress an even more distant contrast to Tony's crumpled shirt.
She stands up, taking her bag with her. "You deserve a break today. Get out of your own head. I'm calling Rhodey and Happy."
"Is none of your business," Tony marches forward and rips the paper out of Steve's hand, tearing it to shreds and letting it fall on the bedroom floor. He's just had a very tiresome meeting at the LA Regional Headquarters about production quotas going wrong, he's not going to let this sales contract he precisely curated go wrong too.
Steve's frown fades. "Perfect." The word flips Tony's stomach - he's never been nervous for one of these, confident he can get the press to eat out of his hand - but the way Steve's smiling at him is a universe of reasons to feel his heart churn. But Steve's smile slants into a smirk, "like I could perfectly strangle you. And I'll do that if you make us run behind schedule."
Ty throws another insult at Steve, and Steve throws one right back. Sunset manages to stop them before any punches fly.
He hands the paper back to Steve and takes a long, sobering gulp of his coffee. “I'm glad the boy's doing better.”
Despite his horrible morning, he's found that there isn't as much of Howard here as he'd suspected. The donut shop didn't recognise Tony as Tony Stark, either too used to celebrities or truly blissfully unaware of the horrors that came with the name. Anonymity was nice: a chance to slip off his masks.
Hindsight was a wonderful thing to have, and as a futurist, hindsight is as useful as it is useless.
Steve makes a frustrated noise, ripping away the cloth covering his shield. The bright white star gleams in the sunlight. "Fine. But Tony, I - "
“What if,” Steve clears his throat, leg bouncing beneath the table to let off some anxiousness, “stop me if I’m wrong, but what if the promise didn’t involve a bed? What if it’s just a dinner?”
Always, Tony had a way of unbalancing him, of chipping away at his defenses, and Steve refuses to fall apart this time.
Not wanting to intrude, Steve decides his private kitchen will do for as long as the Colonel’s visit extends. He can always make pancakes for himself, and the other Avengers will certainly be able to find their own morning food.
“That's because you're barely ever here anymore,” Clint comes over, handing them both Steve's customary lime soda.
Tony glares at the paramedic – no, the firefighter. What was a firefighter doing here? – and he gives a short nod to Sam. There was another ambulance coming for him to greet. “Wilson, disinfect wounds, bind ribs – ”
"I'll leave you two," Sarah eventually squeezes his shoulder one last time, "Captain Rhodes must want a drink."
"And Tony's heard less from you as he grew up," Stane tips his head to one side, "you understand why I'm cautious."
He'd done his best to try drive Rhodey away in a panic, partying excessively and throwing up all over the man's shoes.
“Had to make sure the kids were safe,” Tony coughs again. It takes some time for it to stop. “The room's a fire compartment, just had to make sure – you guys aren't worrying about me.”
“Where’s our very own Miss Marvel?” Tony does a cursory sweep of the almost empty bar as he wraps his hand gratefully around the warm cup. “Has her summer break ended?”
Tony's bare shoulders are covered in sprays of blood, a jacket wrapped around his head - it lodges something in Steve's throat, the unsaid words, the regret, the ring, the... the sheer, selfish relief.
"No more fun-vee for you," Rhodey comes around to settle on the chopper's floor beside Steve. "You're in for one hell of a debrief."
, Tony tries to repeat to himself, hollow and false. On the other end of the line, Steve is talking again, asking questions about what new flowers Tony planted in the garden.
Always thinking of others first. Steve shakes his head: that isn't important. "Can I touch you?" he asks Tony.
One search on the internet and Steve is certain he would be able to solve the mystery that is Doctor Stark. Slipping into the banter with Tony yesterday had felt frighteningly comfortable. He can't believe he said what he said.
“I still don’t make those kinds of promises,” Tony says, fingers drumming on the table’s wood. “It would be entirely unprofessional and Pepper would have my head.” At Steve’s questioning look, Tony adds, “Miss Potts. You’ve met her. Her heels are very sharp and scary.”
Kate eyes the pack strapped on Liberty’s back, with the VA logo declaring her a service dog. “Oh,” Kate mumbles, “Liberty seems… sweet.”
"Did you mean it, too?" he throws the words harshly at Steve, standing up from the bed and pacing the short length of the room, hand rubbing roughly over his eyes.
Shaking his head, Steve taps into the comms, newly designed by Tony. "Agent May? Stane diverged from protocol. Windows are exposed, I need an extra man."
had noticed, and if someone as young as her could see right through Steve, is this Tony toying with Steve?
"All those times Howard kept going on and on about how he made America's golden boy - and Aunt Pegs didn't even
When Christmas rolls around, Tony smiles at all the right times for Howard and the business partners. He meets Ty and Sunset at the party and pointedly shows everyone how close they've become since starting school together. His mother presses a kiss on his cheek. He dances with her, relishing the small smile she gives him at the end of it when he bows. All the while, he holds his breath, counting how many glasses have passed through Howard's hands, only sighing in relief when the night ends without incident.
"Thank you for being there for him, Colonel," Steve hopes the truth of his words are clear through the call.
Fixing his grip around her hand, he keeps his smile firmly up. "You're pressing on the trigger now. Letting go of where you're pressing on that blue wire there is going to set it off. But there's a three-second window because the wires are... long."
“We're bound to fight,” Steve cups the back of Tony's head, letting his hand smooth out the tangles of hair there. “Let's just not fight when we're both tired from a battle, yeah?”
But… Tony thinks of those hazy last moments. He vaguely recalls giving Rhodey a list of rambling instructions to take care of Steve.
When Tony takes a peek around at Steve's confused face, the plaid shirt is thankfully buttoned up properly, even if he feels a twinge of disappointment at the loss of those toned muscles. “I thought Obie would be more excited," he picks up a pebble from the ground, tossing it out over the cliff, into the sea. "We could revolutionize the prosthetics industry.”
Adjusting his suit, Stane gives Steve a smile, then a pat on the shoulder. "We appreciate your hard work, Captain. I'll be in touch."
Obie would want him to answer that this is a move towards having not just a bigger stick but a better one too. Howard would say that Starks are made of iron, and their weapons even stronger. As crass as Tony can be, even
Tony goes back to the bed, sitting on it heavily, taking the time to let out a long breath. "Rhodey didn't murder you after all, huh?"
At least, that was what he had tried to tell himself as he'd traced the neat curls of ink where the letters were signed
"Evacuate the building," Steve's orders are clipped. "Get a bomb squad here, an ambulance, a firetruck, and forensic."
Tony, contrary as ever, pushing Steve to the brink, moves to perch on the side of Steve's bed. He takes out a pair of Steve's black underwear, holding it up to the light thoughtfully. “You sure? You’ve been pretty cozy with Nat lately, is that why?
“Captain Danvers!” Kamala pokes her head out of storage again, cutting whatever Carol was about to imply. “You’re late.”
“I know who to call if I get mugged,” Tony nods in Carol's direction, making Steve huff yet another laugh.
Sam is in the kitchen, most likely cobbling a dinner together. Despite Bucky's medical bills, they'd managed to collect enough for a flat in Brooklyn, allowing their mothers free reign over their childhood homes, and nighttime peace from the often violent effects of their nightmares.
The war, Bucky, Peggy, the Valkyrie, waking up seventy years into a world he never asked for – he just wants one good thing to hold onto.
He doesn't want to have to admit it outright. It feels childish and petty, now that he considers simply telling Tony the whole of it, but it also feels too close to the real truth simmering just beneath the surface.
, Rogers?" Was this a ploy to distract Tony from the hell that was his entire body, or did Steve really mean his offer? "I don't put out till the third date," Tony adds for good measure.
Tony, kneeling on the ground and trapped in a group hug with the children, laughs freely. "My favorite rascals, this is Mister Steve, and no. He didn't eat Mister Rhodey, but Mister Steve is strong so be careful."
"And impossible is a boring way to live." He pulls out his phone, tapping quickly at it until it dials on speakerphone. One ring is all it takes for it to connect, and he grins straight into Steve's eyes. "Pep? You know Malibu Point?"
Steve sighs, turning his back to the door and gripping the edge of the suitcase tight. Even this, he realises, is Tony. Any other suitcase would've been crushed under his grip, but this one that Tony had built – somehow Tony had found the perfect balance to Steve's strength.
He stares into his cold bedroom and throws on one of his thicker shirts to stave off the cold weather. When he walks toward the small studio he set up, Liberty’s already there waiting by the stool in front of his easel, tail thumping softly on the floor.
Over the Secretary's shoulder, Tony squints at Steve's hand very respectfully placed above Maria's waist, their mouths moving in a conversation Tony wishes he could record. Maybe that'll be his next project: surveillance tech.
Two, from his first glance, he knows it's a C-450, a Hammer design without an emergency kill switch.
. There was, of course, the real risk that their relationship might jeopardize the investigation, but there was also the fact that the messy politics of Captain America dating Tony Stark weren't anything they felt prepared to face.
“Steve, be a dear and get yourself a sandwich. I don’t know what your mother taught you about respect or feeding yourself.”
“Your face has healing properties,” Steve repeats, which makes Tony snort, the careful blankness swept away. “You're a good man, Tony,” he explains more truthfully, feeling bad for hiding behind witty quips. “And a good heart counts for more than a handsome face.”
Steve finds his eyes drawn back to Tony's hands, never not moving, all that energy and dreams of possibility desperate to be let out.
good," he grumbles, shifting slightly. His head feels woozy, and for a few selfish seconds, he's glad Steve didn't leave.
Steve's shoulder bumps against him as they stand side by side at the edge of the continent. Before them, the Pacific Ocean spreads wide across the horizon, almost wider than the night sky they used to gaze at as children.
Steve wonders how much he should say. "I lost a friend to a fire," he settles on telling Stark the bare truth. "Didn't feel like going to the bar for some time."
“J is not a murderbot, thank you very much," Tony reminds him, "and Jarvis is starting to adjust to the
His efforts are rewarded with a small chuckle that rumbles against Tony's ear. "Asking for a date, Tony?"
"The letters. You worried about me, collected articles and - nevermind, all of this was stupid. You left me for a reason."
He knows that Obie means well, in the same way that everyone older than him means well for him. That is, they'd like it if he were chained - metaphorically, of course - more malleable to their wishes.
“With all due respect,” Steve shakes with the effort of controlling himself, “your son doesn’t need the serum to be great. And if you’ll excuse me, I’d very much like to find my friend.”
Tony doesn’t necessarily enjoy his loneliness, but his empty penthouse means no one will be hurt by him, and he can’t be hurt by anyone else.
"You have nothing to be sorry for." He had to be quick about it. No time for grief or the bitter aftertaste of regret, because Steve doesn't know he's here.
“I thought Libby only didn’t like the men I brought home. Turns out she has something about the ladies too.”
Steve bounces his leg, glancing around the red walls of the waiting room from his corner, every so often shushing Liberty, holding onto her to keep her from barking too loudly at the other customers.
“No arguing,” Tony says. Knowing Steve, their next argument might just be about whose fault it was, each of them shouldering too much blame on themselves. Frankly, Tony doesn’t think his back is up to any shouldering right now. And if they aren’t arguing, then, well. He lets his head tip sideways, ignoring the ache in his back, until his head rests on the crook of Steve’s neck.
The workshop's chaos is achingly familiar. An unfinished coffee cup by the holotable. Several cars in various states of dismantling. And of course - DUM-E, rolling happily to Steve. Another bot that Steve doesn't recognise rolls over, on its arm a massive letter
“Nothing much. We don’t have any of this,” Steve waves at his bedroom. “But there’s my Ma and Bucky. We used to sneak to Coney Island together, hitch a ride on one of the rollercoasters. He’d scream and we’d try to win something to bring home for his sisters.”
He pauses as he sees the folders in Tony's gallery. This was - this felt wrong. No doubt Rhodey has gone through everything, there isn't anything for Steve to double check here. This is just his inability to wait quietly as JARVIS finishes compiling Stane's logs. Steve has no right to barge even further into Tony's life, especially when he hadn't been brave enough to come back here before Tony had gone missing.
Steve has been through this enough times to understand the too-gentle tone of her voice. He nods. “Let me get you a cab.”
Steve wishes he had a coat to wrap around himself. Singapore's humid weather means he's wearing a light jacket, but he longs for the sense of safety that comes with warm coats in a cold winter.
That earns a wan smile from Steve. Something fiercely bitter claws at him that he clamps down. Better to put his anger and resentment into finding Tony.
Good. It'll give them another reason to fight, and with each fight, it'll give Steve another reason to leave Tony.
But after an argument that had spiralled from taking unnecessary risks to Steve's penchant of waking up early to the Avengers messing up Tony's schedule, Steve had thought some space might be good.
Tony had the future to carry, and Steve was doing his best to hide Captain America, carrying a legacy he didn't know how to hold together, searching for a purpose other than war.
Rolling his eyes fondly, Rhodes tips the pan to the side so more waffles slide on Tony’s plate. “America betrayed me. All my years of service, and I get my breakfast colonised.”
Tony wonders if his life will always be a choice between disappointing Steve and disappointing his family.
Stark, however, is undeterred. “Big man like you, gotta burn a lot of calories saving damsels,” Stark holds up a potato wedge in front of Steve's face, brooking no argument. “Eat.”
Sarah tuts at him. "I know both of you, and I know how bullheaded you two get. Tony isn't one for giving up."
Most of it is simple: all of Tony's shares and assets in the company goes to Pepper. All of his patents and machinery to Rhodey. His properties go to Peggy to be turned into assets for charity, and -
Pepper's in the antechamber to the news room on the seventeenth floor when they get there, speech cards and some powder ready in her hands. "Mr. Stark, for you to ignore," she hands him the cards first.
' that flashes brighter than bright, a deep-seated certainty that makes itself known for a second before the waves of fear and doubt buries it away.
Another doctor comes over, drawing the curtains around Mrs. Carter’s bed closed. “I can take over, Sam.” This must be Doctor Lang. “Tony’s waiting for you in the OR.”
"Well, you have your friend here to help ward off the beasts, don't you?" Maria smiles wider at Steve, extending a hand.
but cannot think of better. A young man enters the mansion, calling himself Fury, and Aunt Peggy makes a rare appearance.
“After a battle, and he likes it when you feed him the pudding from the med wing,” Rhodey finishes, and
Glass windows stretch from floor to ceiling. The grand piano sits in the corner, a thin sheet of dust covering it. The sofa is the same one that Steve had fallen asleep on a decade ago as he waited for Tony to come out of the workshop, wondering,
They're almost delicious enough to distract him from the situation, but Steve edges closer to him and he catches a whiff of lemon shampoo that he can't ignore. Doubt, ugly and dark, rears its head.
responsibility, no one else's. "Sorry, Steve," he swallows, his free hand twirling the wirecutter. Contrary to popular belief, he
Something catches in the back of Tony’s throat, raw and rough and real. “I think I would have loved her too.”
Regardless, it’s enough to make Jarvis relent. He steps aside from the door, letting Steve into the house.
"Great, run that in the background."  Tony turns back to the computer screen, and the blueprint sketches of the arm, "now let's get this baby up and running."
The thing starts off without a hitch. With his back to the tall arching windows, he has to trust that the view really is worth all the hassle. From the corner of his eye, he spots Steve standing just the slightest bit behind him, his lips twitching up when Tony makes a crass joke. Cameras flash every so often, the reporters managing to stay in their rows of assigned chairs even after a protype of his reinforced material is rolled out and rolled back away. He spots a lady - or three - and some men with whom he spent several
Whoever wrongs Tony also wrongs Edwin Jarvis. Steve isn’t any exception, especially when he had cut deeper than most.
The pounding of Tony's heart is starting to slow. That's good. "Because you're worth fighting for," Steve corrects.
When Tony manages to open his eyes again, the light is much more bearable, and Steve’s book is on the coffee table, its paper cover curving up. Vaguely, he remembers buying it for Steve on their... sixth date? They’d ducked into a bookshop to avoid the rain, and Steve’s hand had been warm in his.
"Please tell me nobody kissed me," he mutters, squinting at the few bits of sunlight trickling over the piles of bricks and crushed steel.
“My friend’s in the Air Force. Has his own service puppy,” Stark goes around the exam table, smiling at Liberty who tensely sits on her haunches. “Gotta admit, Butterfingers doesn’t bark as much as this girl.”
Steve treads lightly over the marble stone of the Malibu Mansion, wincing at the loud echoes of his own footsteps.
“She's a brilliant young lady,” Stark crosses his arms. Not a sign of annoyance, Steve observes, more of a way for Stark to close himself off, to put some distance.
She had been a junior officer when Howard's car crash was called in, and she had visited Tony often during his recovery. Her gruff frankness kept him sane when everyone else was walking on eggshells around him.
They would much rather keep it a Steve and Tony affair, and in that regard, the bodyguard duties made it far easier to sneak some time together with Tony, who had taken to spending alternate weeks in New York and Malibu as the groundwork started on the cliffs to build a new mansion there.
"Shitty meeting," Tony waves tiredly in the general direction of the horrid conference room down the hall, "shitty family."
“I don't usually advise patient-doctor relationships, but you're not a doctor, and she finds you charming.”
11 a.m. is just about the opening time for Natasha's bar, and he heads the few blocks down to it, pondering
Wood has its own fuel: organic methane. Heat it up hot enough, and it would decompose its own self in the heat, burning bridges to smoke and ash.
But Tony never wanted the world. Tony wanted the stars above. Wanted to know what it felt like to ride a roller coaster, to fly, to
Sarah Rogers swats the back of Steve's head, pulls Tony into a tight hug, and shakes Rhodey's hand and hugs him too.
At some point, Steve feels brave enough to talk about the explosion that took out Bucky’s arm, that still rings in Steve’s ears some nights. He searches for any sign of pity. Tony offers none, asking only whether Steve would like to go on with the story or to be distracted by trivia about camel evolution. The unflinching acceptance is a soothing balm that rolls the ball further. He promises to show Tony a painting, and Tony prods until Steve agrees to paint one of him.
Tony latches onto the distraction. “So, Miss Khan, you come out of hiding for Carol but not for dear old me?”
“I don’t want to make weapons," Tony tilts his chin up, trying to figure out how Steve summoned his reckless courage. "That isn’t – we can do more. End the war for fuel. Make it cheap for anyone to make anything.”
,” Tony squawks, “I even did the paperwork for this. SHIELD’s PR people are going to have a field day.”
"I wish I could give you my serum," Steve leads her to sit down on the couch. No matter how hard Steve had tried to give her a bigger, more comfortable home, she insisted on staying in their tiny Brooklyn flat. He can't quite blame her: he got his stubbornness from her, after all. But he
Soon, Tony will have to tell them the truth. He’ll wait a few more minutes, no sense in them worrying over something they can’t change.
“The IV is portable,” Tony repeats, “you can move her wherever as long as you don’t jostle the needle too much.”
Tony, however, had always been good at cutting wires, and before he starts the car, he types in an extra line of code into JARVIS through his phone.
“If I wasn't scared of you rileing Bruce up, I'd have tried to poach you a long time ago,” Steve stubbornly refuses to be distracted. “You're someone I'd want on my team, Doctor.”
“Have a scarily competitive streak?” Tony finishes for him. The coffee mug is warm in his hands, and he ducks his head down when Rogers' smile turns wider. His cheeks feel warm too, now.
Maria was out of town with Howard, though, so today he's chosen to spend his Saturday evening working on a prototype for Bucky's arm, a form of neural interface he hopes he can take further to develop into an actual product line of prosthetics.
“How about you rest first before we talk?” Steve suggests. “I shouldn’t have brought up the training exercise issue when you were clearly stressed with work, it could have waited and it can wait now.”
"Do you remember Steve Rogers?" he pretends to be blasé instead. He realises Howard's obsession with Steve might just be the push he needs to get one of his projects past the board and Obie.
For all the world, he looks confident, undisturbed. To Steve, who has spent countless nights beside him, the nervousness is clear.
"If you wanted me to go away, you could've told me," Steve grits out. "If you were unhappy with me, you could've told me why."
In the safety of the Malibu Mansion that Steve now calls his safehouse, JARVIS collates everything, sounding as surprised by the data as Steve - stored in a remote private server that even JARVIS had no access to. It speaks of paranoia. Steve wonders if he's opened a pandora's box by letting all this out, but he knows there's no going back - not if he wants to find Tony.
, the will had dictated, forcing another legacy for Steve to carry on. He had stood on these cliffsides before Tony had built a home here, and something in him fears that he might stand on this cliffside long after everything Tony built has crumbled to dust.
But the painting haunts him as Jarvis takes him through a winding maze of high-arching corridors, past countless carven doors and decorative tables with vases of wilting flowers – carnations on one table, wisterias in the other, Steve can hear an echo of Tony’s voice teaching him about the colors – and the occasional photograph accompanying those flowers.
Pepper had called him last night to warn him about Tony’s sour mood, but it had been too late. By then, Tony had already stormed away and Steve had been stewing in his annoyance until he realised what he’d done. Loving Tony doesn’t get any easier, not even after nearly three years of dating. He’s still learning how to balance what he needs to get across and what can wait until Tony isn’t carrying too much.
, having a working relationship with medical staff is necessary, and SHIELD Memorial’s proximity to the fire station means they consult the hospital’s ER often. If Stark is now Head of the ER, Steve has to figure out how to make it work with the Doctor.
“Didn’t I tell you? My dad was a weapons contractor,” Tony shrugs glibly, coming back to Liberty with a new packet of dog treats. “Becoming a vet pissed him off.”
They're standing beneath Van Gogh's iconic self-portrait. The ocre strokes of the straw hat and the eternity of the man's gaze puts a startling perspective on the magnitude of Steve's fears.
“You're not working, are you?” Tony doesn't bother saying hello, pushing past Steve and whistling at the fireman's pole at the center of the garage. The plastic bag he's carrying bumps into Steve's thigh, cold and hard.
She puts down her cup soundlessly. "Not at first." Her eyes meet Tony's, all too knowing. "But when he learned that a Stark was developing the serum, he asked me about you, and how you were doing."
Most likely, somewhere in the middle of the Sahara, where Tony's latest missiles have gone astray from their natural shipping route.
"You know that arm I promised you for Bucky?" Tony flips the subject to the furthest possible thing he can manage.
“I don’t need rest,” Tony mutters, sitting up straighter. His lower back pulses with new pain, and this time, he can’t quite hide the wince.
"Then let me at least give you something to be happy for, hmm?" Sarah points to the old couch for Tony to sit on, which he gratefully does as she putters in the kitchen to get a plate of cookies.
He assesses the paleness of the patient's skin, the blueness of her fingernails and the sweat dripping down her hairline.
' Kamala had asked with far too much cheer for someone whose apartment just narrowly avoided a fire. Steve had agreed with her assessment of Stark's abilities, but that only served to make her even more excited. '
“Isn't saving lives enough to be a reason?” Tony glibly dismisses, shifting his hand slightly to get more of Steve's hair out of the way. “What made
His mother was more than sharp enough to spot if he was hiding anything, although she most often chose to remain tact about it. Tonight, however, her curiosity and mischief seemed to exceed her tact, and, "ah, the darling Captain everyone's been whispering about. Since my son hasn't offered me one, would you like a dance?" her grip on Steve's hand tightens, "as a thank you for everything you've done for my Tony."
But Tony’s gaze turns back to Steve, slight concern creasing his brows. “You haven’t had breakfast.”
It hurts because Steve knows Tony so well. Because Steve is desperately seeing through the lie and succeeding.
The lights overhead turn on. Their brightness is exactly how Steve preferred them a decade ago - too dim for him, now. "Good afternoon, Captain Rogers. It's 3.49 PM. The weather in Malibu is 72 degrees with scattered clouds - "
One of the pillars had survived the explosion, and it’s their saving grace, because the pillar was supporting another pillar that had fallen over Steve when AIM set off the bombs. The two of them are separated by twenty feet of concrete debris that shakes every time the crane outside lifts more of the building above them.
Stark to you, Muscle Man,” Tony hands the clipboard back to the paramedic. “The kitchen fire guy is in my hands, so he’ll be more than okay.”
The whirring of the helicarrier is a distant hum, barely noticeable beneath their tension. Tony takes out his packet of blueberries and offers it to Bruce first. It was vengefully childish, but if Steve apparently wanted to strike low blows, Tony wasn’t going to restrain himself.
He gives Bucky a cookie that his Ma had packed for him, and then checks up on Natasha in the cockpit.
"Obie's been siding with Howard more these days," Tony sighs. And Steve knows how much it pains Tony to keep their relationship a secret from someone he once considered close family. The only people in the mansion who knew the truth about their soirees are the Jarvises. Not even Maria Stark was privy to the truth.
