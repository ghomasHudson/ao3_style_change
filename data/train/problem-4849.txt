Crossing the short steps to the door, Tony spares him a glance over his shoulder and Steve gives him a little half-smile, just the edge of his mouth curling upward. The door closes behind him with a click, and when Tony steps into one of the suites down the hall and into the shower, he stays there for a long time.
The elevator takes him down in silence and as he steps out, his eyes prickle again at the sound of AC/DC radiating from the workshop, so loud it could rattle the spotless glass. Tony is there with his back turned to the windows, a soldering tip in one hand and an Iron Man gauntlet balanced precariously in the other.
So, this year Steve was back in full force, organizing a party for their favourite robot. Steve had invited everyone and all save Bruce and Rhodey, being available with Wanda and Vision returning from their Paris trip earlier, just to make it to the festivities.
“Don’t fucking say it! Don’t you fucking say it, Steve.” Blood roared in his ears, and adrenaline raced through his body like he was mainlining amphetamines, every nerve ending alive with panic and fear. Steve would tell him to let him go. Tony would
Natasha turns around and saw Rumlow did a turn at the hallway they're in. His eyes were wide and quickly walked towards her. "Well well, the traitor is back."
"Sharon, there's not going to be any trouble right if this cute little Omega only serves for me in the private room?"
"Please, I've been planning and preparing this for you." He said softly, looking pleadingly at his Alpha.
"Hun, there's nothing to be sad about. Just be proud of who you are. Just make the best out life as you possibly can."
"Tony leave him alone and plus, we also have a huge meet up with an important investor from France-"
Natasha blushed a little. "Look, that is considered a bonus if it really does happen. But I'm really serious about her artist friend though, when she introduced me to him. Steve Rogers. He's mad talented. His paintings are one of a kind. He gives you this different perspective of art and beauty."
Thor shrugged. "Well, I don't know if I could put it like that..I guess it's more like we're just on good terms. So, he really harassed Steve?" Thor looked at both Wanda and Sam seriously.
"Plus, want big tips, you gotta treat them well. Most of those who come here usually have big wallets and they just need company. You just need to play nice." She winked but then turned serious. "Unless, they cross the line of course. Just scream for me."
Pepper nodded. "I see. Well Stark's men are securing the perimeters in Manhattan looking into all the neighbourhood. I'll wait here just in case he comes back."
Bucky went to his desk and smashed all the glasses that were on his table to the ground. “Damn, that Stark!”
"How could you kidnap a child?!" Steve exclaimed as he runs towards Peter in which the latter did the same.
He walked towards his desk when he realize it was full of paintings and sketches. Beautiful paintings and sketches. It took his breath away. The colours, brush strokes, the sketches of old buildings are wonderful. It just draws him like a magnet. He is not exactly an artist, only an inventor and businessman, but he does know how to value a talented artist. And these are down right phenomenal. He was drown in the paintings until he saw a small note at one of the paintings.
"Oh she had an urgent errand. Don't worry she passed the duty to me. Come on, i need to show you the office." Happy ushered him to quickly follow behind.
Steve whined as his head was all over the place in ecstacy. He had to grab Bucky's hair to balance himself. "Slow down please.." He begged.
During lunch, Peter brought Steve to a food truck at a park not far from the Stark Tower. "This taco truck is the bomb! You should try the shrimp oh wait the beef is good too but surprisingly the vegan ones are great too." Peter kept on rambling about the food.
"Which apparently I have failed due to your annoying persistence. And just to be clear, I am not a terrible mercenary! Also, for the last time it was an accident!"
They both looked at each other suspiciously. “An Omega?” They both said at the same time and eyes widened.
Steve blinked and blushed again. “T-Tony, that’s not exactly true. I only draw during my free time and not professionally.”
"That's it Stevie...Come on, doll." Bucky whispers hoarsely in Steve's ear as he grinds on Steve's clothed ass, caging him as he was on all fours. Steve's pants was already off, leaving only his shirt that was already rolled up to his chest, boxers and socks on.
"You guys may not like this idea but I think it will be faster and easier, if we ask for Mr. Stark for help-"
Steve laughed a little as he wiped his tears which made Peggy happy. It was a genuine smile and laugh after a long time. "It's not like I can send you both away anyway. You won't leave even if I forced you both."
Steve shook his head, body shivering and his eyes were already filled with tears, ready to fall.  "N-No.."
"Yeah, maybe." Steve smiles as he pulls out the necklace underneath his shirt and rubs against the engraving, gazing it lovingly yet sad.
Bucky loves the view he is seeing. His Omega panting, and begging, skin blushes in reddish pink through the heat and arousal, eyes glistening as it was pooled with tears, lips red and trembling. The collar around his neck is everything he dreamed of; his Steve, his Omega chained to him for life. His thought is making him go wild.
Tony was definitely boiling by then that even Happy could feel it radiating around. “Let. Him. Go.” He growled. He let out a very heavy pheromone of a furious Alpha wanting to fight.
Steve shivered under the intense feeling. "Y-You love me?" He closed his eyes as his mind was in a daze at the strong scent of warm wood and cigar.
“Stark you’re being ridiculous. We did everything you asked okay? It’s perfect and it will be fine.” Happy huffed in annoyance.
"Pietro, you still haven't told me about how you and Natasha met." Wanda asked as she stirred her coffee.
James looked around the gigantic place filled with vintage and old but luxury furnishing. He may have everything but it will always feel cold and lonely without his sweet Omega. He made it. Taken his father's place, proving how a worthy Alpha he is. He remembered his father's proud face.
Tony sighed. “Oh shit, not now.” Steve heard Tony muttered and used this chance to dash away from him to the elevator, where Natasha came from.
They walked in the dark building and looking suspiciously at the setting. Happy immediately turned his flashlight on.
Steve sighs since he knew this will never end.  He caressed his head to soothe him. "Peter..I need you to not tell anyone about this."
He may be paranoid, but he felt eyes on him. And usually his instinct never fails. He looked around but no sign of anyone. So, he continued forward. Then he heard tyres screeching. He immediately turns around to see a car stopped. Two people got out of the car and walked towards Steve. Alphas. He knew just by the aura.
“Peter Parker. His colleague at Stark Industries.” They shook hands quickly as they walk towards the hospital in a fast pace.
Luckily, a cab was coming in their direction and Natasha hailed the cab. The cab stopped and Natasha quickly pulled Steve but he was hesitant as he looked at her. Natasha gently cups his cheeks. "Steve, I know that you don't trust me right now. But please, just listen okay? We need to get away from them first . We can't go to your apartment cause obviously they'll go there. I have a secret home."
Steve gave Sharon a pleading look to which Sharon gave a worried look. "Oh, is there a reason why Mr.Barnes?"
“He is suffocated by your strong pheromones. Omegas could not handle those type of heat sometimes. It can be a shock to them especially when it’s sudden.” Happy was walking away with agents helping him to carry Steve.
"Honestly traitors in my book should be punished but with you I'll make an exception. But if she does something else..I won't tolerate it sweetheart."
"Get the car ready." Tony could only see red as he violently grabbed his coat and furiously storms out of his office.
Tony laughed a little as he shook his head. “None taken. I only collect technology stuff though. Since, they’re something relatable to me.”
"God, what is the Omega Protection Programme doing?! All these Omegas are still being treated terribly." Clint exclaimed.
"You're welcome. But no one makes better hot chocolate than you though." Both shared an awkward laugh which turned into an awkward silence.
Steve felt something warm inside of him. It felt oddly good and there was this lingering smell of a rich dark chocolate that felt almost comfortable. Seconds later there was someone standing in front of him. The scent before became stronger and he realized it was coming from this man. He looked up at the man with dark features, who stared at him like a predator.
"That's not true!" Steve was now beet red through the embarrassment...although he is feeling really hot and bothered by the comment.
He wished he was an Alpha. Maybe if he was one, he could have claim him and be with him, protect him and support him. Of course, he was only a mere Beta. It was only a matter of time till Steve found himself an Alpha that will always be with him. Also, knowing Steve, he hates people being protective of him 24/7. Taking advantage of the time he has, he will stay with Steve until he found his mate.
Steve sighed. “A-Alright.” Smiled a little at the kind Beta who sighed in relief. “Just not today. Maybe tomorrow?”
"Y-Yeah, it's amazing. I want to set an appointment with him. Make sure you upgrade a stage solely for him."
“The doctor said he’s fine but! He needs rest.” He looked at both Alphas and sighed. “So please. Don’t bother him. He’s stressed out as it is. Let him sleep for now. No Alphas for now. There are guards at the door if you dare to even try to sneak in.” He glared at both.
Steve bit his bottom lip as tears starts to pool in his eyes. He was shivering in fear. He doesn't know what to do in this situation especially with Bucky being like this. It was foreign to him, the touches, the kisses...it was new and he does not know what to do. His instincts want him to submit, succumb to his Alpha, to let the Alpha control him. While his rational mind wants him to take his own stand.
"Exactly, I'll give you 2 options. Either you quit or you continue but only serve me in this very room. You're forbidden to go around doing other jobs at the club except for serving me."
Steve bit his lips and looked at them cautiously. “He kinda asked me to marry me him..I mean of course it was not serious. Kinda like the slip of the tongue mistake.”
"Explain what?!" Steve turned around. Tears were already pooled in his eyes. His body emitting distress.
"No! That's not the whole thing! Please, just let me explain-" Natasha turned her head as she heard sounds of crashes.
"Baby you don't need them when you have me." Bucky kissed Steve's forehead and continued eating his chicken.
Peggy sighed. "Okay then." She sat beside Steve who was looking outside the window in a daze. His side profile is so beautiful yet sad at the same time. He was not exactly the same sweet and shy anymore.
Tony sat down and rubbed his temple as he stared into space. “I am so sure he is the one Happy. I’ve never felt like this. Ever. I don’t know what I’m doing.”
He snapped out of his trance when he felt hands moving around under his shirt against his skin. "B-Bucky stop!" He tried to unlatch the roaming hands but the Alpha was back hugging him so tightly it was almost impossible.
Sam shook his head and turned to Pepper again with all seriousness. "And wait Steve was at a club?" Sam looked at Pepper seriously.
“You are an exquisite gem and because of that I put together a solo-” Another cough from Natasha was heard and the Alpha whipped an annoyed look at the Beta assistant, sighs.
“I’m just gonna take a guess here. Pretty sure you tried to claim him, force yourself on him and it backfired.” He smirked as he saw the Russian’s jaw tightened.
Well guess we have another new character! Plz do give me your feedback on this fic. Would love to hear your ideas as well!
Steve was just speechless. He noticed at the corner of his eyes Peggy looked shocked and would squeal in excitement if not for Sam containing her, who looks so happy for Steve.
"You do know that you're not allowed to break in his apartment right? You don't even know him." Wanda gave her a look.
Pietro looked at the blonde who just got off her phone. "Wait, who is she again?" Pietro whispered to Sam and Wanda but Pepper heard and beat him to it.
Happy and Pepper looked at each other and just nodded. They knew better than to make the Alpha angry.
“That’s very kind of you Mr. Stark, I mean Tony. You have no idea how grateful I am of you to appreciate my work and to even let me be part of this amazing event to showcase it. It really means a lot to me.”
Steve just bit his lip. He knew what Natasha meant. He hates the idea of being with an alpha but he knew Natasha was just saying this with good intention. "I know you mean well Nat but I just can't grasp at the idea of having an alpha. I-I don't like to be tied down. I wanna be free. The freedom to do anything I want."
"I-I want to satisfy you..please let me." Steve placed his hands on the bed which Bucky reluctantly complied to it again. He then places his hands on Bucky's shoulder and starts moving his hips.
"How is this guy not get caught?! I mean if he runs the underground business, he's like a Mafia." Wanda crossed her arms and looked at Pietro.
"Hey blue eyes, coffee with 2 spoons of sugar please." A beautiful red head winked at the gorgeous yet adorable blonde behind the counter.
"Guess, we have to find out won't we..." The Alpha said darkly as he places trails of kisses on his back which made the Omega let out a resisting moan.
“Oh, right! So this Barnes guy live in this mansion but the thing is I’m not sure where it is. Both him and I were taken in a black tinted car.”
“You really don’t want to challenge me especially when we’re in a hospital right now. Bloodshed will not look good for patients. He growled.
Happy laughs a little. "Tell me about it. You just want to score some points with Peggy aren't you, by helping out a dear friend of hers?" He gives her a look.
“Actually, I did plan on coming here to surprise both of you until I got your text. Good thing I booked an early ticket.”
"Wow, you really have not heard me all this time. I told you I met him. I know him through a friend who is very close to him. I looked at all his paintings right there and then. It's all incredible."
It has only been 2 days of chaos in Steve’s life and he has a feeling it would not stop there. Especially the dozens of roses on his doorstep. He blinked in confusion as to whom would send him these. He searched for a note to find out who would send him these. He found one and quickly opened it.
“Come on Tony, spill it.” Natasha smirks. “I know this dinner is not the only thing you’re serious about.”
Steve looks away due to discomfort but was shocked when hands pulled him abruptly in a tight hold. "Let go of me!" Steve tried to push Bucky.
"Hey! And I did!" He pointed at Peter and Steve looking at them back and forth. "Okay, at least I thought I did. Apparently I got the wrong person." He muttered the last sentence quiet.
“Look you seem like a decent but how do we know that boss of yours won’t do something to Steve.” Sam said.
With that, Tony and Happy were shocked. Tony’s protective instinct became even heightened knowing that his Omega was vulnerable and alone all this while. If only he could’ve met him sooner, Steve could have everything now and be safe with him.
"Oh, he is gorgeous alright." She sighs dreamily as she twirls the pen between her fingers. Happy seems to notice this as a habit of her when talking about beautiful people.
"I work with Stark. The team is looking for your dear friends. But it will be very helpful if you have any idea where they could be."
Sam observed him thoroughly. He did look familiar with that fancy suit of him. He raised an eyebrow when it him. “Wait, you’re that famous billionaire Stark guy.” Everyone rolled their eyes at that.
Tony blushes in embarrassment. “Oh, that’s uhm… a solar bulldozer that is supposed to lift sand.  Something I built when I was a kid cause loved going to the beach back then to build sandcastles and figured I wanted something to help me build it efficiently. Don’t mind it, I-I was 7 so it’s not that good.”
"Yeah, they want you cause they appreciate your art! And one of the smartest to notice your gift." Sam squeezed his shoulder. Steve giggles.
Steve was shocked but quick to realized what the man was trying to do. He was trying to leave his scent and mark him. He pushed the man hard and gave him a hard slap across the face.
Even Bucky never told him anything about his father that much since he himself did not understand what he does for a living. All he told him was that he meets a lot of people. And also saying that he was a douchebag at Bucky for giving him a hard time. He had to take care of his family when Mr. Barnes was not around and Bucky never fails express his full hatred towards the man, seeking comfort from Steve to which he reciprocates with his delicious apple pie to make Bucky happy.
“Ты так прекрасен. Я просто хочу запереть тебя в этой комнате. Я хочу, чтобы ты был постоянно заполнен моим семенем и оплодотворен нашим ребенком. Я хочу, чтобы твой животик был большим и круглым от наших детей.”
"W-Wait on one condition..." When Bucky was close, Steve puts his hands on Bucky's chest to atleast calm the Alpha down.
"Ya better come back home alive Barnes. Cause Carter will hunt your soul and put it back in your body to make sure Steve would not be alone.....and also so that she could see your wedding and be Steve's bridesmaid. Plus she is going to drag me into it." Sam rolled his eyes.
"Look, yes! I know! I never thought he would be like that with Steve. What he did is very wrong, I will never deny that. But...I've seen this Alpha when I was at the mansion. I don't like his vibe one bit. As much as I don't exactly like Mr. Stark now...I do still see a little good in him. But that Alpha..." Peter was quiet.
"Peter that is not okay." He said sternly. "You should never let them do that to you. Did you tell your teachers?"
“Mr. Stark, this is highly unprofessional.” Steve placed his hands on the Alpha’s chest and pushed him a little.
"What do you mean? I brought the Omega you wanted me to keep an eye on." The man looked confused as he pointed at Peter who looked like he was about to cry.
Sam and Wanda looked at him wide eyed, understanding what he meant. “O-Oh yeah..it’s private. I didn’t really notice it at first cause I was just worried bout you.” Sam said as he looked around the luxurious interior design of the hospital that he never noticed before.
“You know, ever since this happened, you seem to be commanding me like I’m some dog.” Tony turned to Happy fuming. Anyone can tell whenever Mr. Stark is furious. His eyes were full of anger. “I was being very patient…even lenient…to say the least. Letting you raise your voice at me. Command me around.“ He gritted his teeth.
." Tony's inner Alpha felt challenged by the sweet Omega and automatically used his Alpha voice to command.
"Our room of course sweetheart." He whispered and kisses his ear, making him jolt in surprise. When they reached the door, Barnes finally opens using his thumbprint.
Tony ignored both of them and focuses on Steve. “Steve, please. I’m sorry; it just slipped my stupid mouth.”
“I just love to collect things I really like or find interesting. I don’t know if it’s a second hobby or a passion of mine besides inventing new stuff, but it’s fun seeing cool stuff that has a history behind it.” He shyly smiles. Tony does not know why he felt so shy. He wanted to display the manly, suave Alpha he is, but God the Omega is too beautiful that he’s becoming a blabbering mess in the inside. He really needs to impress him.
Natasha sighed. "Truthfully, I don't know. No one knows what he is capable of. That's why we need to save Steve as fast as we can."
Peter broke his trance and immediately nodded. He gently lead Steve out of the room, soothing his arm.
Steve blushes as his whole body felt hot at his Alpha's warmth. "I got the feeling I know what it is."
Tony looks up from his hand to see the shocked but blushing face of the Omega Steve Rogers. "How is it possible that you're even more beautiful in real life?" He said lowly.
“Look, Steve. I don’t think this thing is going to stop anytime soon.” Sam looks at Steve seriously.
"That means that they're not in Manhattan?" He muttered quietly for him to hear but Happy heard it too.
Natasha sighed in relief. At least would he still listen to her. She wished she could rewind back the incident.
Well, Natasha had a point. He never lets anyone go near the floor of his collection, not even his trusted people like Happy, Natasha and Pepper. The room means a lot to Tony. A lot of the collection was admired by his late father. He may not have the best childhood but he does want to keep some parts of what his dad love.
Steve bit his lip, angrily. He hates that Sam was right. Of course, he knows that he means well but he just hates the fact that people keep thinking him as this fragile flower. He wants to do a lot of stuff, there are so much yet to explore but he knew there are only so much an Omega can do. “Look, it’s not like I force myself to prove to the society. I just want to do stuff that I want to do without people telling me that I can’t.”
“He hasn’t seen you in a long time, of course he doesn’t trust you easily. Especially, who knows what you did to him that made him like this.”
“That’s the more reason why I-I can’t let you do this.” Steve’s voice trembled, lip quivering and eyes watering. “I can’t let you get hurt…please..”
"Bucky, you know that's not true. Peggy is just messing around." Steve soothes his Alpha's chest to which Bucky calmed down and purred at his Omega's touch.
Not only that, even the room was perfectly decorated with wonderful vanilla scented candles and rose petals on the bed. His heart warmed greatly at the effort of his Omega put in for him.
“Look, Steve. Do you still want to go to that job with a boss that harassed you?” Sam looked at him worriedly.
The Alpha might felt too overwhelmed of unfamiliar emotions. “I uhmm….making someone’s dream come true? I need a scotch.”
Steve shivered at the touch as he nodded. Refusing him may not be good so he just lets him. "Bucky can I ask you a question?"
"I'm gonna keep calling Natasha." Sam whispered. Wanda nodded and looks at how Sam eagerly calls Nat.
Peter blushed. “I-It’s almost at the end of my senior year and since I scored well, they let me do an internship on certain times during school.”
Bucky uses his other hand to lift up Steve's shirt, revealing his smooth chest. Bucky licked his lips before he dived onto Steve's pickish nipple.
Sam and Wanda nodded and Pepper smiles then turning to Peter seriously. “Okay, Peter you need to tell me the whole situation. Where were you taken?” Pepper quickly moved to the computer, Sam and Wanda following suit.
“I just want to show my huge appreciation for his talent and to kind of officiate his solo showcase with a pre-celebration.” The Betas are trying hard to not laugh at their boss’ attempt to deny.
"Yeah that poor Omega!" Happy was furious. "I'm not gonna lie Tony, but I thought you were better than this. Well, you're definitely an asshole but I know you won't do this kind of thing."
Tony blinked in bewilderment at the change of demeanor. It confusing but so cute that he could not restrain himself from hugging the adorable creature. “S-Steve I thought-“
Steve shook his head. He refused to hear people telling him that his mate is dead. He believes that Bucky is out there somewhere. "He's alive...I-I know he is. He'll come back-"
“Peter as much as I want to send you home, I need you to tell me where Steve is. Tony and Happy are still not back from their search. Thanks to someone’s brother I heard.” Pepper glared at Wanda to which the latter looked at her confused.
Steve nodded. "I-I know...but I just...can't help but feel like he's still out there you know. When I first heard the news, I just didn't believe it Peggy, like I know he is still alive. Well, until they gave me his necklace. I just didn't know what to feel anymore." Steve took out the tag from his pocket and stares at it.
“Mr. Stark please, I-I don’t think this is a good idea.” Steve continues to walk away from Tony to which the latter quickly stood in front of him.
"It's cause I'm worried about him too that I don't want to add my sister to the list! Please just trust me on this."
“Steve!” Tony was right on his heels and grabbed Steve by his waist before the Omega managed to get in the elevator.
"Oh, just making sure that my Omega is protected and of course to have a drink while I'm at it." Bucky smirked.
After 45 minutes, Nat and Pietro reached a back door of the mansion with Pietro coughing behind her, hands on his knees to take a breath. "Nat you did not tell me how far it was to reach here."
Bucky was drown into the kiss where Steve tastes so sweet like apple and nectar that he couldn't get enough. He was kissing him so passionately that Steve was too tired to fight back and just let him.
Steve ran out the tower and had to take a deep breath. God, his body just moved on its own without even thinking. A part of him scolded himself for not being mature about the situation. He felt a little stupid for running away like that. Shook his head and walked towards the street. There weren’t many people around as it was almost dark, so he sped up his pace down the street.
Bucky smelled the distress coming from the Omega, he looked up to face him and he could see Steve's eyes closed, tears streaming down with trembling lips. The scene was doing something to the Alpha's mind, triggering his inner desires of his Omega succumbing to him while his heart feels heart broken as well. He never wants his Omega to be upset.
"Room? Why do you need a room for Steve..." Natasha being an intelligent spy she is quickly looked at him in horror. "Are you planning on kidnapping that poor Omega?!"
"Yeah, I don't think I can do this." It is 9:50 a.m. and the three of them are in front of the Stark Industries building. And Steve was nervous. Very nervous. Something about the building intimidates him.
"Steve have you ever look at yourself in the mirror? You are the epitome of perfection that every Alpha desires in an Omega. You are sweet like that warm cinnamon roll yet sexy like a vixen."
Bucky ignored his complain and took long and quick stride to their room. He was going to kick the door until Steve squirmed around. "Wait! Put me down first."
Steve just stood there awkwardly. He was bewildered in the current situation he’s in. Everyone looked weirdly at Tony. The Alpha snapped out of his stare and waved his hand in the air. “Look, let’s talk about the exhibition. Come on, have a sit Steve.” He guided Steve to his couch and sat next to him.
“Baby doll that’s not nice.” Bucky tried to control himself. It was arousing yet challenging his inner Alpha.
"Steve's favourite place has always been Brooklyn since he was born and raised there. If Nat was the one taking him then I don't know where she could be. I mean we barely know her apparently." Sam scoffed at the last sentence.
“Uhm, yeah thanks, I am in a hurry to the hospital but of course me being my clumsy self.” He laughed awkwardly.
“Which you know you can’t handle it if it gets too hard. Steve, this is serious. You can’t overwork yourself. You keep trying to do everything but you and I both know that it will take a toll on your body. You think you can do all but you-“
"It was in the way." He then proceeds to enter two fingers in Steve, scissoring his way in to loosen him up.
“Stevie…” Bucky eyed him up and down. He knows he’s probably wearing nothing underneath and his mind is already taking him to wild places.
Bucky gave him a look. "Really? Cause if I remember clearly, there's this really beautiful blue eyed Omega who got surrounded by Alphas in an alley but was being unnecessarily stubborn and actually tried to give a speech on equality instead of yelling for help." Bucky clamps on Steve's ass which made him yelp in surprise.
Steve manages to pull away and hold the Bucky by his shoulder. “Bucky! Please, you’re not thinking straight! Stop! Please!” He panted and one of his trembling hand cups Bucky’s cheek to soothe him. “Please…” Steve tries his best to resist but whatever Bucky put in his water earlier must be very strong as he couldn’t think straight anymore.
Happy sighed. “I guess still a little stunned especially knowing that you covered his medical bills. But yeah, overall fine.”
Bucky growled, eyes going dark when he saw the cab going further and further from his sight. "They're in that cab."
“H-Happy?!” His eyes widen at the gun each of the agents hold, pointing towards Bucky and the other 2 Alphas.
"Damn it, I'm sorry baby but I don't think I can." He hugged his body and flipped them around so that Steve was under him. "Now this is a very familiar sight."
Sam facepalmed and shook his head. An Omega plus club is never a good equation. He groaned. "Sometimes I wonder what goes on in his head..and now he is freaking missing with Nat apparently."
"Look! You are vulnerable as much as you hate to admit it. You don't see it but you're walking around all confident thinking you don't need anyone to protect you but in reality you're just letting those hungry Alphas eye you like a piece of meat just waiting for the right time. The fact that you are one of those rare male omegas is making alphas crave you even more. So, sorry if i'm too protective of a friend that doesn't want to see her friend being mounted savagely by some random shit ass alpha."
“Honestly, I’m not." Sam shrugged as he smiles. He leans against the wall in such a smug way that irks Steve.
"You just don't get in the way of an Alpha with his Omega alright? I'm serious Nat." With that, he walked away.
Steve gave Happy a look of disapproval but Happy gave him the ‘I-know-that-you-hate-that-but-I’m-trying-to-protect-you-from-the-Alpha’ look. Steve then nodded a little.
"But the good news...what we do know is that they have to be in Manhattan. They didn't go far considering they did not leave many trails behind cause most of the surveillance here would have caught the sight of 'em. And Romanoff is smart enough to know that. The cab just drop them off not far from the club area. She must have a hiding spot somewhere here."
“Sam did have a point. You always turndown every Alpha with the exception of Bucky of course even before you guys dated. I’m just curious why you accepted Tony Stark.” Peggy smiles cheekily.
Steve smiles as he looks around the terminal. It looks the same as it did when he came with his mother once, when he was a child. His mother rarely brought him anywhere since he was a sickly kid.
“Peter!” Pepper ran straight to Peter, concerned. “Are you alright?!” She hugged him so tight that he was out of breath. “I can’t believe you’ve been kidnapped!”
Peggy rubs his shoulder, resting her chin on his shoulder. "It'll be okay. He is gonna be so proud of you Stevie."
Steve sighed and stabbed his lettuce with his fork, grumpily eating it while Bucky chuckled at the scene.
"Pshh...with me, we will be best buds for life!" Happy sighed but still smiling at the energetic being in front of him.
"Okay, too much!" Happy closed his eyes and opens them again. "Peggy would be jealous. She seems to have a thing for you too." Happy gives her a playful look.
Bucky clicked his tongue and fished out his phone from his pocket. He calls Natasha even if he knows it will go to voicemail. "You listen well Romanoff. You will bring Steve to me or I will immediately chop your head off when I do find you both. Bring him to me now and I'll spare you. Consider this a warning." He growled and hung up.
“You’re not being you Tony. Did something happen when we met at the hall a while ago? I’m pretty sure something did.” Happy said.
"Well, Steve said he was his best friend ever since they were kids and all. Didn't really tell what he does...he calls him Bucky. Don't know his full name though."
Steve's jaw dropped when he scanned the size of the whole living room. But that wasn't the one that is shocking.
“Don’t worry, I’ll inform this to Stark and Happy so they can send men to check all these addresses. There’s no way else to do but search for these places.”
Tony smiles. “Well, not exactly a who but a what. He’s an artificial intelligence system I created. Very smart and I made sure he can be very humanly friendly. I call him JARVIS. Just A Rather Very Intelligent System. Hence, the name JARVIS.”
Mrs. Barnes caressed the back of his hair to soothe him. "Sweetheart, I know you are hurting. I am too but-"
“Hey Angel.” He spoke almost so softly as he run his eyes up and down Steve’s beautiful and sinful body. “Missed you doll face.”
“What Sam meant is that..” She said as she glared at Sam for his poor choice of words.  “You need someone to protect you. It’s good that you’re independent but just take a look back on your life. Being brave didn’t help did it?”
Tony was holding the same cheek that was slapped a while ago. A prominent red mark was displayed at the same area.
Natasha smiled a little and frowns as she looked down at her lap, thinking about the guilt she had been hiding for so long. How she practically deceived everyone especially Steve, at least in the beginning. She was initially assigned by Bucky to watch over Steve and thought it would be like any other spy mission she received. As she gets to know him, Steve is different from others she met in real life or even during her work at spying. He is a sweet, hard-working, strong and independent Omega. He just charms everyone with that blue eyes and kind heart of his. She considers him as a brother that needs to be protected at all costs. All the while she had never let her emotions out and vulnerable with someone. Being a spy for a long time, made her feel even more cold and distant. Surrounding oneself with violence, killing and death will do that to you.
Then, it struck Sam. He knew where Steve is getting at. There were issues where Betas would court Omegas by battling with the Alpha but always end up getting killed. “Steve, I’m not going to get hurt.”
Nat sighs and turns around with a smile. "Well, looks like Mr. Stark himself could not wait to meet you Steve."
Sam was just utterly confused. Does Steve even know them? How did he even find these people? God, he really should pay extra attention to Steve’s surroundings. Who knows what that Omega will encounter.
Bucky rubbed his head in stress. “Romanoff I’m having zero patience this week. Don’t bring it to a negative.” He growled.
“Well I think it’s better if you tell him yourself Barnes.” Steve and Bucky looked confused until seconds later another car safely parked behind the car Happy came out of.
"Is Barnes going to hurt him? I mean...you told me that he loves him right? I'm sure he's not going to do anything."
"And lastly, here is the management department. Basically your office. These 2 weeks are busy for us so many will be out stationed. You're only left with our intern for now. Still in high school but mark my words he's a great kid. Well, minus his..uhm..overly energetic self."
“Wow, look at that posturing.” Steve teased, gripping his jaw and pressing a kiss to his stiff mouth despite the rumbling in Bucky’s chest. “No need to be jealous, Buck. This is just something Tony used to do. He’d get all worked up over something and dart off for a couple days until he figured it out and was ready to talk.”
“I’m going to assume that everyone has already reviewed the briefing documents.” Rhodey initiates the meeting, his voice a firm projection that envelopes the whole room. “So, let’s run through this as quick and as painless as possible.”
After she’s gone, Tony picks up the letters and lets them run through his fingers, a river of paper that slides across the bed. They’re all out of order and he has no idea where to start. For a second, he remembers the first one, how much hope had interwoven into the initial dread, only to have it sliced away when the letter hadn’t revealed anything new. Well, maybe that wasn’t fair. Steve had tried with the first letter. And even a one percent change was still a change, right?
That’s how they end up back at the Tower, creeping in one of the service entrances like bandits in the night because Tony will be damned if he runs into Pepper or Happy, or Odin-forbid, Rhodey on a last-minute visit into the city. JARVIS directs them through the Tower without being detected, which seems to startle Steve before he relaxes and whispers that he’s missed him into the quiet of the elevator. JARVIS doesn’t reply.
“When we’re done here, I’m taking you home and we’re not leaving for two days,” Steve grunts under his breath as an alien catches him right in the belly. The air is knocked from his lungs for a brief moment, before Steve beheads the alien with a sharp, cutting arc of his shield and is back in motion again. “I don’t even know if I can wait that long sweetheart, I might just have to bend you over in front of the whole goddamn team.”
“It wasn’t fair. I know it wasn’t, gorgeous, I know. And I know you’re not perfect. God, Steve, you’re perfect at sucking my cock though, aren’t you? Fuck. I don’t need you to be perfect and I’m going to work on that. I promise.” Tony thrusts forward, forcing Steve to take him deeper and Steve takes it all like it’s his life’s calling.
Steve’s hands are all over him, slipping under his shirt to span wide across his hips. They trip over themselves, skating up his back until his shirt is under his arms and he has to strip it off. Whatever Tony needs to do to keep Steve’s hands on him.
Bucky eyes the retro-framing glasses again, glaring at them like a poisonous snake and not the last precious link Steve has to Tony. When he snaps them, the plastic shatters and glass rains down over the tiled floor.
In the memory that Steve’s created, Tony wraps his arms around his shoulders and holds him. He doesn’t forgive him, doesn’t say anything at all. Just holds him through it until the scene dissolves into black.
It’s almost too easy to agree with him, because Rhodey has this reasonable, level way about him that Tony has always envied. He sees the world in vivid shades of greys, where Tony oscillates between stark white and pitch black. Polarized.
How was Steve supposed to take any steps when Tony was gone, literal dust in the wind as Pepper and Morgan had travelled across the country, scattering his ashes in his favourite places. At first, Steve had thought maybe he only needed to find a way to feel closer to Tony. Mourn. Grieve. Figure out a way to let go—as if it were even a possibility.
“Don’t fucking say that.” Steve thrusts hard into him, making Tony cry out and dig his fingers into the curve of Steve’s back. He twists and bites his mouth in retribution and Steve does it again. “Don’t ever fucking say that to me again.”
It’s not a pretty sight, never was, and he feels as sick as he looks. But Steve will hold the shame at bay if it kills him.
The words are like velvet, stroking along Tony’s skin and making him want to melt. All those carefully constructed walls, just shattered pieces around his feet now.
Maybe this Tony doesn't know the heartache they’ve wagered against each other. The thought is unsettling; Steve hardly remembers who he was back then and this isn’t who he wants to be tonight.
Nothing can take it away. Tony tries to tell Steve that with his body, fuck the loss back inside of Steve where he can keep it for his own.
“Gross. You two are made for each other.” But even as he says it, Tony’s smiling, draping his arms around Steve’s neck to tug him in. When they’re finally alone, Tony works up to kissing Steve breathless, then leans back and asks, “You’re not really jealous, are you? You don’t have anything to worry about.”
It was a rare sight, seeing him in full regalia, sharpened by the crisp lines and muted chrome finish of the braces. His presence is a quiet command at any given moment.
He dove back in and Tony’s eyes fluttered up to meet Steve’s, who rewarded him with an equally dark look and kissed him hard, all tongue, before he spread him wider, stretching him further than Tony thought he’d go.
He resists the urge to close his eyes, prepares himself to soldier through whatever else Tony has to offer. Steve waits for the bite of Tony’s malice, to find out that Tony’s been lying all along. Maybe he’d never meant to help him after all.
“Tony?” Rhodey put a hand on his arm, stilling him because he was babbling. Of course he was babbling. Bucky made him nervous as hell, and as twitchy as downing eight cups of DUM-E’s misguided take on coffee.
“If you tell me how sorry you are one more time, I swear to Tesla I’ll—” Tony slaps a palm down on the worktable, head falling forward. He takes a shuddering breath, and Steve watches his fingers twitch. They’re wrapped so tightly around the edge of the worktable, the blood bleeds from his knuckles.
A sharp curl of dread tightens in his stomach. Tony had never told him that, not that he can remember. He can’t remember ever discussing what Tony had seen that day, and with the backdrop of everything else they’d been dealing with, Steve hadn’t paid it a second thought.
Steve felt himself flush deeper, because yeah. Yeah, he absolutely did. “Why don’t you kiss me again and find out?”
“Everyone wants to see the arm, no one wants to get to know the guy attached to it,” Bucky grumbles, but there’s a softness in his tone that puts Tony at ease. He must have come along way, he thinks, because he trusts Bucky with the kid.
“That’s pretty much the gist of it all. Buck’s never been shy about telling me what he really feels. He said I’d never been selfish, back before everything and that’s what did it. I thought you were the selfish one. You never listened and you expected a lot from me–”
Steve doesn’t seem to have an answer to that, and for a long moment he’s lost in his own thoughts. Tony watches him mull everything over, swimming through a sea of inner conflict Tony doesn’t, can’t, understand.
“Avengers,” Tony says loudly, not that he needs to draw their attention. “Meet the kid. Peter Parker aka Underoos aka Spider-Boy. Spider-Kid, meet the team.”
Ross is a bright, furious tomato red, a shade darker than he was after the break-in at the Raft. A shade Tony hadn’t thought possible.
That had been a massive mistake, because now he has to sit in the chilled knowledge that Steve is working through memories with someone. It would make sense, if that’s what’s been taking up so much of his time.
Tony thinks he’s a man without secrets, and he couldn’t be more wrong. He deserves the truth, he always had. It’s not Tony’s fault he’s fallen for a man too afraid to lose him—too afraid to lose either of them—to be honest with him.
Before Tony can even think to stop him, Steve’s fingertips brush against the thick line of scar tissue and his fingers skitter away. Steve startles backward, breaking the kiss and holding Tony back with a hand on his shoulder.
“It’s not about you. It’s about us. It’s about presenting a united front, and we need to be on the same page. So, let’s figure out what that is and get the team on board. If we’re in this together, you know they will be too.”
“It’s okay. Tony, it’s okay. I love you. I’ve loved you since the beginning, you know that. It’s okay. I promise.”
Tony saunters over to him, looping two fingers into his belt buckle. “Why’s that, honey? You’re not jealous, are you?”
Steve had walked away from their marriage and he was all but forcing Barnes out of his life, only months later.
Spit trickles out of the side of his mouth but Steve doesn’t seem to notice, making little noises of contentment and losing himself in a rhythm that drives Tony wild.
The thrill of what it might mean to let himself be weak explodes in a shower of sparkling colours behind his eyes and challenge rises in the back of Steve’s throat. “I can take whatever you’ve got, Stark.”
He took Bucky apart with firm, slow hands, calming him with soft strokes down his chest, trailing lower and harder until Bucky’s brain shut off and gave over to pleasure.
The arm plates are popped back in, and the dinner plates are distributed across the table. Everyone settles in and starts to eat, but Steve is still absent. Tony’s noticed that he’s been absent a lot the past few days, since their run in in the hallway.
Steve gives him a dubious look but holds out his hand anyway. If they’re going to try and save the world again, there’s little more he can do with the nerves, and he never slept well the night before a mission anyway. He knows Morgan will always be safe, Pepper and Rhodey are more than enough protection. Tony has outfitted them with armour that rivals his own.
Before he can tug on the handle, the door flies open and he’s attacked by a thick wall of muscle topped off with crystal blue eyes and a bristled jaw.
Bucky had understood him. Bucky hadn’t pushed or demanded. He’d waited and let his true colours shine through and look at where they were now. The most bizarre friendship Tony has had to date, with the least likely person.
A beautiful creature, with a fascinating mind that kept him on his toes. One hell of a temper, all biting words and cold regard when she was angry. Tony had enjoyed the passion of it all, having a partner who could finally match him again.
“My fault. Could have been worse. Take a deep breath, you’re okay. You didn’t hurt me. I’m okay too.”
“You want to hear a secret, Cap?” Tony bears him down into the cushions, bending him at an angle that forces his ass into the air, spine arching to accommodate the intrusion as a second finger joins the first. Tony licks a hot stripe up Steve’s neck and bites down hard on his earlobe. “I don’t think you recognize yourself anymore and that terrifies you.”
“If you don’t get us up, we’ll both drown, JARVIS, you think I give a fuck about decompression sickness? Just get us to the surface and send out another SOS. Tell them where we are. I can get him there. I can do this, damn it.” Tony gritted his teeth, almost biting through the side of his cheek.
And okay, that’s true, Tony hasn’t told the kid everything. The bare minimum really. Need to know basis only, Ross had said after all. Plus, the kid had been so fired up just hearing that the other Avengers were coming back, Tony hadn’t had the heart to tell him much more.
It’s quite the opposite, really, when he catches himself wondering if Bucky fits in a bit too well. It’s another one of those moments he knows he’s being irrational, but as he watched Bucky and Tony banter back and forth, bent close together over one of Tony’s cars, there isn’t a damn thing he can do about it.
Tony leans his head back against the raggedy futon in the corner of his workshop. The lumpy old thing has been slipping down for days now, half spilling onto the ground. Every time he goes to readjust it, he finds himself collapsed on top of it, half on the floor, half on the unforgiving mattress. If Pepper were still coming by regularly, she would have forced him to clean it up by now. That, and the littered takeout containers DUM-E has been piling up in the corner.
“Plus, you’ve said you’re mine twice now, and if that’s actually the case, I think there’s a much bigger conversation we need to have.” Tony ran his fingers through Bucky’s hair, trapping a handful at the back of his neck and forcing his head backwards, pushing, seeing just how far he’d let the submission take him.
well it's 2020 and i'm a with a new chap. hope u guys had a fun 2020 and don't be shy to share your favourite moments in the comment below. You know what I think it'll be fun if you guys share your favourite moments in each chapter of this fic hahhaha. And it would be great if you guys want to throw in some ideas too!
The shy act made the Alpha purred in satisfaction to know that he made the Omega like that. On instinct, he took the Omega's hand which made the latter gasped and kissed it so tenderly, taking in all his scent and masking it with his own. He could not control it, the moment he saw him, the Alpha in him overpowers. His Alpha was marking his territory.
Steve, Sam and Wanda got out from the room and were walking towards the nurse counter until they saw unwanted familiar figures.
"Natasha, I just wanna say thank you for actually putting my work in this huge event. The fact that you even give-"
“Don’t worry about it. Let’s be honest he is part of the blame. I think it’s right for him to pay. Especially for what he did.”
"Of course, we have to take care of Stevie here." Peggy somehow got herself in the house with Sam behind her.
Steve looked up at Sam in horror. “No! That is the one thing that I wanted you to be on my side!.” Steve looked at Sam as if he betrayed him.
“Exactly. I think doing this could actually work to protect you. I know you hate it-“ Wanda could not even finish the sentence when Steve cut her.
There was something at the back of his throat that makes him feel weird when he heard that name. And suddenly he remembered.
"Oh come on! Let's be honest you barely let people go near Steve even if they were simply friends or trying to say hi." Sam exclaimed.
Peter was walking home but he could feel someone was following him. He gulped and walked away quickly.
“Guys, I don’t have anything to wear. I came here thinking to see if I have a potential to be an artist and just enjoy the city. Not having dinner with the richest Alpha on Earth. He’s probably gonna think that I’m making him look like a fool with my cheap clothes. I don’t even know why he even asked me to dinner.” Steve sighed as he looked at his opened luggage full of plain shirts.
“You know you seem like a nice guy, but I don’t feel safe letting Steve work with you people. Especially that Stark guy.” Sam looked at Happy to which he nodded.
“Tony, I don’t know what you’re thinking but I sure as hell know that it is going to bad and I will not allow you to do whatever it is that you’ve planned.”
Peggy and Sam gave each other a knowing look. They feel relieved that Steve is finally doing something that makes him happy.
Before anyone could react Happy bolted his way to the Omega and grabbed Steve tightly. The Alphas were furious but before they could say anything he held up his hand.
"Well, you guys are doing the same thing. Plus, wouldn't it be easier to have more people finding your friend?" Pepper shoots her the same look.
"Okay Steve, I'm gonna stop you right there. I don't know why you would think that but you're not okay? Heck, even Natasha said that your work is one of a kind. And trust me, I know her. She has a good eye. Plus, he works close to the Stark guy himself. I'm sure that says something. Means that he trusts her enough to take in great artists. If she loves it, then the whole Stark Industries love it! Don't think about it too much. Just live in the moment. You got it cause you deserve it!"
Steve looked at him confused. He then saw the back door of car opened. Who he saw was probably the least person he would like to see in his life right. That tall and muscular body of a dark-haired man with blue eyes that he adores…or used to.
Steve looked back at his living room to see Sam and Wanda sprawled out on each of the couch. He chuckled at their sleeping positions and head out of his apartment. He sighed as he remembered the events yesterday. He felt all sorts of emotions in a day that his feelings are confused. He sighed as he continues to walk to work.
Bucky thought hard. Maybe this could play to his advantage. He looked at Wilson. "Maybe you didn't fuck up entirely." To which Rumlow and Wade looked weirdly at each other.
“C-Can I? We just met.” Steve blinks. Not only that, he is basically talking to an Alpha. A national, if not, world renowned influential Alpha.
Pietro felt the heavy air and tried to lighten up the mood. "So, how was the meet up with your friends just now. Seems like you were pretty enthusiastic to go. What did you guys do?"
Steve relaxes in her arms. “I was just really scared and shock. I didn’t know how to react since he was my best friend. Didn’t see him after that.”
"Knowing him, he'll probably nag and elaborate about Omega rights which let's be honest, he is so cute when he does that." Peggy giggled.
In a blink of an eye Bucky fished out a knife from his pocket and went for Tony. It was too quick but Tony managed to cover his face with his arm to which it was slashed.
Peggy, Steve and Sam were just surprised that the top 5 of the richest Alpha in America is in front of them.
“Look, trust me when I say this. Stark is not a bad guy but that does not mean we share the same values or vision. I don’t agree with some of his way of thinking. What he is doing with Steve is very wrong and I apologize on his behalf because I know he won’t.”
"I have a friend, Natasha who works at Stark Industries. They're hosting an art exhibition for their new art gallery in Manhattan in a few weeks. They want to showcase as many local artists from New York. And me being me I bragged about your talent to her and she's very interested to see your work. She always trusts my judgement so she is eager to see you."
“Well, as annoying and frustrating as this was, I do find it interesting that you actually care of what he thinks of you.”
“I’m glad you’re alright doll face.” Bucky’s sultry voice turned Steve’s leg into jelly that doesn’t know if he could stand up straight any longer.
“He’s mine.” All James really wanted to do is rip that billionaire Alpha in half and burn him alive. He is trying to keep himself calm but it was really hard when this Alpha clearly wants to have Steve and he simply would not allow that. “We go way back, right baby doll?” Bucky licked behind Steve’s earlobe that made the Omega shiver.
Steve's eyes were wide open at the statement and thrashed his head. "No! Bucky you're not thinking straight..ahh!" Steve gasped as he felt a hand slides through the back of his jeans. The fingers smooth over his globes, massaging it. With his free hand Steve was trying to pry Bucky's hand away.
"You're trying to confine him here!" Natasha looked at him, furious. She may be ordered by Bucky to keep an eye on Steve initially, but as she learn more about him, she grew fond of him like a brother, realizing how sweet and kind the Omega is and enjoys spending her time with the ambitious Omega. Steve does not deserve to be treated this way and would protect him. "You are not laying a hand on him, Barnes." She glared at him.
Bucky grabbed his wrist but Steve yanked it hard and makes a dash towards the door. Before he could reach the door Bucky hugged him from the back and pulled Steve towards a sofa with Steve on top of Bucky's lap, trapped in his hold again.
“Yeah, it’s kind of a confusing thing to understand when there’s so many things happening that confuse the rest of us. One minute you basically dragged the poor Omega and the next thing you now he is running away from you scared and the next minute he seems happy and then dinner?” Natasha leaned against the wall.
“I just got off my mission and I heard that Steve was admitted in the hospital! And you were basically the main cause of it!”
Natasha looked at him and sighed. "I know Stevie...it's hard but you need to be protected. An alpha will protect you."
"According to the surveillance camera, Mr. Rogers went out at 7.30 p.m. today and he still has not come back until now."
"Can't let that happen." But then a knife was at his throat, just a skin a way from ending his life.
“Tony, where the hell are you going?” Natasha quickened her pace to keep up with her boss, feeling slightly angry and embarrassed that her boss is acting like a child.
James growled inwardly. "You don't get to tell me what to do Romanoff." With that, he slammed the door to his office.
Bucky trapped him against the wall and caressed his cheek lovingly. "Because I want you Steve. I love you." He rests his forehead against Steve's as he lets out a comforting scent. "I love you baby."
Tony ignored her and sighed. “Look, I just want everything to be perfect. I don’t want to look like a fool as a rich idiot that flaunts his wealth like the media keeps portraying me to be.”
She swallowed the last bite and laughed a little. "Steve relax. This the sixth time you were worried about the chicken."
Steve glared. "I have a name, you hormonal Alpha." He spatted rudely, shocking both Peter and Happy.
They both heard a knock and went to the door. When they opened, they saw the familiar kid that they met at the hospital.
Pietro sighed and closed his phone. Literally after 20 seconds, a car stopped in front of the bush he was hiding. He saw the window rolled down to see a familiar red head.
"Please! We need extreme help from Mr. Stark. He has all the advanced technology and everything that will help search Steve faster. We need his expertise." Peter was desperate at this point and continued. "Steve could get really hurt. Please...he's the only friend that understands me despite the fact we just met."
“Well, she helped too, in putting you a solo showcase as the main center of attraction for my new Art gallery.” Tony smiled dashingly as he stared deep into Steve’s eyes, almost not even blinking.
Peggy tilts Steve’s head to check for any bruises. She then whipped her head at Tony. “What did you do?”
The sound of a glass shattering filled the room. "Где вы сказали, что он работал?!" A very intimidating man wearing a fine leather suit with hair slicked back, eyes piercing through one's soul making him look like the deadliest alpha you never want to encounter.
“Ever since we were in diapers I guess. Childhood friends till high school.” Bucky smiled a little to himself as he looked at his lap.
Steve was trying to keep himself calm of what's to come. The room was dim-litted as well but he could still make out the fancy victorian decor and furnishing. But something about the room made him feel goosebumps.
"You know what I mean Stevie." Bucky gives small licks at Steve's neck before he readjust Steve on his lap, looking deep into his eyes. "We both know that even with that mark, Alphas will still try to get to you. If you're pregnant with our child I know they'll back off." He said as he rubbed Steve's stomach.
“I need to make sure he accepts me.” Tony walked towards his desk and sat on the table, crossing his arm.
Natasha sighed and pats his thigh. "Look, it's okay. Don't think about it to much alright? Get some rest."
"I will..go to you willingly. As long as you won't hurt Natasha. You will bring no harm to her and leave her out of this."
"Yeah Peter Parker! I worked with Steve at Stark Industries and we met at the hospital. So I hacked into the company's database, I know it's wrong but this is an emergency since Steve is missing and so I found his address-"
They were walking along the hall as Steve felt nervous. How can he not be? Tony Stark is one of the wealthiest Alphas in the country. He is a genius inventor, successful businessman, philanthropist and very outspoken. But Steve? He’s just a boy from Brooklyn. He still wonders how he got here.
The Beta glared. "Wow, Tony. Last time I remembered you said we were friends. And as a friend, I need to make sure you do nothing stupid. You shouldn't be swayed by your emotions. I know it's hard for an Alpha-"
"I know sweetheart. But you can't be depressed like this. It pains me to see you like this. I know for a fact that Bucky would hate it. He knows you would want the same for him too. He wants you live life to your fullest. Always be happy."
"Seriously, you gotta tell me names. I'm gonna hunt these two assholes down." Peggy crossed her arms.
"Well, that's Steve for you. He can be a stubborn fiery fighter and an oblivious shy guy at the same time." Sam rolled his eyes as he smiled.
Bucky smiled and kissed Steve's cheek. He looked at Rumlow. "What are you waiting for? Start the car."
"He..." Steve trailed off as he thought hard. Now that he thinks about it, he never knew what Mr. Barnes does. All he knows that he is a successful businessman and the most his late mother told him is that he helped a lot of young entrepreneurs in New York.
"I don't think so after what happen tonight. I think he pretty much got the idea of my resignation." Natasha smiled. "I've always been thinking of quitting this for a long time anyway. Figured now is the right time, cause of you."
Bucky was very hesitant but still complied to it. He puts Steve down and the Omega turns around against the door facing Bucky. "Can you give me a minute?"
"Sometimes there will. But since Barnes has Steve and most of them here are Alphas, he never wants them near Steve obviously. Most of them would guard the outer area anyway. Pietro, look at that big door. I think it's the only hallway to that room. I have never entered but it has the most different design. It has to be it."
Bucky let out the same pheromone that the air became so overwhelming especially for the Omega. He felt too much heat. Omegas are delicate creatures, so they could not withstand intense and extreme situation especially when there are predominantly Alphas.
Steve nodded as he blushed. "Well, you are going to protect our country. You deserve a good meal before you fight for our nation."
Pepper sighs. “I understand why you won’t trust us but I am telling the truth. Preferably I want to find Steve first before Stark to set the record straight. Stark has been out of bounds and way over his head which needs a huge slap on the face.” Pepper looked seriously at them, hoping to convince and understand her part of the story.
“Well, like any private hospitals. Only this is better with more advanced medical technologies I sponsored.” Tony shrugged.
Happy gave Steve the see-what-i-mean look. Steve just smiled and turned towards the boy, Peter. At one glance, he knew this boy is an omega. It made him felt at ease. Omegas when around each other always gave out a comforting feeling as they were all gentle and caring in nature. "Hi Peter. Hope we could get along."
"I only agree to come with you but not-mmph!" Steve could not finish his sentence when Bucky smacked his lips against his. Tongues clashing and fighting which of course ended up with Bucky the victor, licking every inch of his Omega's mouth.
Now that he thought about it. It brought the question on why he let the Omega know a very deep part of him so easily. He had not realized it until now. He just felt the need to. Heck, he is ecstatic that he shared that part of him.
I MISS YOU GUYS AND I AM SO SORRY FOR THE HIATUS! Assignments are stacked and I have to set that as my priority (though fanfic will always be my life priority hehe). God I miss writing Mine all Along. I had to re-read it to know the flow again. For this chapter, can I just say @ floklo…I LOVE YOU AND THANK YOU SO MUCH MY LOVE!
“Well, I don’t know about you but this past few days you’ve been acting weirdly since you’ve known about a particular Omega in the name of Steve Rogers.”
The atmosphere in the waiting room was very tense that even the hospital staff felt pressured and nervous as they try to avoid the area as far away as possible.
Steve’s eyes bolted open and panted. He looked around scared until he heard a hushing sound from a familiar voice which have always made him feel safe. He looked at the man holding his hand and wanted to cry in happiness. “S-Sam!” He pulled and hugged him tight.
He growled menacingly as Steve whimpered.  "I don't take no very well lately dollface. Especially when it comes to you."
Suddenly a man burst through the door and went straight to the nurse counter. “I got a call that my friend Steve Rogers was admitted?!”
An hour passed and it seems like Steve adjusted well with the drink mixing and the environment as well as serving the customers. Most of them are curious and talked to Steve since he was a fresh face there. He kept on serving the customers at full speed like a professional. Steve felt proud of himself for adjusting to the job well especially when he managed to get quite the amount in an hour. His nose was suddenly hit with a strong familiar scent of wine, cigar and wood that made him feel warm. His could sense someone sitting at the end of the bar.
Tony had always been perfect like this. Asleep, when he was peaceful and vulnerable, and Steve had cherished every moment of their time together. Seeing him so close now left Steve aching, the tips of his fingers tingling with the urge to reach out and stroke a hand over all that soft, scarred skin.
Pepper returns later, how much later Tony couldn’t say, and hovers in the doorway. He smiles at her, peering up at her over the top of Steve’s head where it’s pillowed on his chest and gives a slight lift of his eyebrows, a silent
He wants it to be enough, to just be some regular, average, run of the mill guy with a home and a partner and a
Rhodey’s posturing brings a fresh wave of guilt because assumptions will be made about Rhodey’s loyalties and ability to remain impartial. That’ll eventually be blamed on Tony too, but it’s more than that. It’s unfair to Steve and even though Tony’s shouldered his fair share of resentment for the good Captain, Tony doesn’t want to see the guy emotionally destroyed
“I’m not sulking, Tony. I’m grieving. I’m happy that this is so easy for you, but I’m not like you.” Steve shakes his head and slaps the envelope against his knees. “This—maybe this meant—maybe we just meant more to me.”
“We’ve got all the time in the world. We’ve got a daughter to raise, and you promised me forever, husband of mine.” The last word is pointed, and Steve could cry, laughing around the thick knot in his throat.
“I can’t do this,” Steve whispers into the quiet. Tony keeps a firm hold over his hands in his lap. He will not touch him. He absolutely will not reach out and comfort Steve this time.
“You fucked up. You fucked up again, Steve, and admitting it is the first step to fixing the problem. Just. Admit. It.”
It’s so rarely sweet between them and Steve gives himself a silent warning not to get used to it. Better to prepare for the inevitable than get lost in the fantasy.
Sam would be the next Captain America. Bucky had Sam. Morgan and Peter would have each other, surrounded by Pepper and Happy and Rhodey. Clint had his family and Bruce was finally moving on with his life, figuring out how to live for the first time. It was more than Tony ever got before his time came.
“If I call him. If I let him come in here. What are the chances anything will be different this time?” The question feels pitiable to his own ears. He tries to remind himself what Pepper had said about being pathetic but finds no peace there.
Bucky was a dirty tease, stroking two metal fingers through the mess between his cheeks, spreading it, and him, until Tony was squirming. All the while, Steve’s hands were exploring them both, pinching at Tony’s nipples, stroking too light and too briefly over his cock. Diving deep into Bucky’s hair to push him down, down, down until he was between Tony’s spread legs.
B.A.R.F. makes up the largest room on the floor, empty and pristine with an oversized armchair for maximum physical comfort in such an emotionally devastating environment. There are small off-shoots; a kitchenette and a bathroom, and two more intentional rooms.
In one memory, Steve tells him that he’s scared of what Tony might say, and then powers through anyways.
“We’re going to need to figure this out at some point, Tony.” Steve says from behind him. “You can’t just think this is going to get any better if we don’t talk about it. You could at least try.”
Peter ducks in from his left, and before he can warn Peter off, his hand is inside the gauntlet, molding to his fingers. Beams of light travel up his arm, and Peter shrieks, eyes wide with horror and bright, sharp pain.
Especially when Steve surprised him late into the afternoon to fuck him into the futon in the corner, greasy towels thrown over the bots to protect their innocence. He’s never going to have that again. Not tapping his fingers against the troublesome smirk that once lit up Tony’s face from across the room and tasted like pure joy. Not kiss him and kiss him a hundred times over until Steve is warm from the inside out, boiling over so they’re both tearing at each other’s clothes.
“A two-hour cat nap where he keeps us both up muttering in his sleep doesn’t count as coming to bed, Steve.”
That was before, back when Tony never had to put up a fight. Never had to question that Steve holding him down meant anything more than overwhelming pleasure.
Tony was slick between his thighs, fluid already leaving shimmering trails down the backs of his legs, glistening with anticipation. Steve and Bucky exchanged a look that sent a fizzle of arousal straight to his cock, making it twitch against his belly.
“Why don’t you just bite him and put me out of my misery, Rogers? It’s the quickest way to end this and you know it.”
It’s not hard to pick a self. They were always at their best like this, their history waiting to be mapped out. Long before the cracks and fissures formed as the years went on.
Eventually, when the food gets cold and the chatter starts to die off, Tony pushes away the nagging thought that Steve might return after all.
“Steve has been using the retro-framing program for almost sixty consecutive hours, Bucky.” F.R.I.D.A.Y. says. She sounds sad. Steve didn’t know a computer could sound like that.
When Steve finally speaks, it’s soft and almost inviting. “I took the stones back. No issues. We don’t ever have to worry about them again.”
Steve knew too. Ever since that very first day. A mountain of Ross’ paperwork couldn’t keep him away.
“Nightmares, Steve,” Tony’d said by way of excuse, shoving at Steve’s hip to get him moving. “Not pretty. Nobody wants to see that.”
Tony sucks in a breath that must taste like deceit because his face contorts and he looks like he might spit in Steve’s face. “Before the surgery, then. You let me go under—you let them put me out, not knowing if I’d make it through and you never said—”
“Yes,” Steve gasped, forcing himself to switch hands and wrapping the Iron Man puppet around his screaming erection. It was the furthest thing from Tony’s mouth but when he did it like this, when he pumped his hips up into the fabric, it was almost like he was fucking into Tony’s warmth, driving inside him over and over again. “Tony, fuck, please. Please, Tony.”
“Yeah, I love you too.” Tony snaps, meeting his eye before he steps past him to the left and grips the door handle. “Now, get out of the way. I have a divorce certificate to pick up.” He crosses the threshold without looking back.
Bare naked, Steve whines and quickly tries to close his leg but Bucky holds both of his knees to spread it open.
"You're my family too Nat.." He hugged her tightly which Natasha reciprocated. Steve lets out a comforting scent to ease Natasha. She sighed as a tear rolled down her cheek. At least the first step was done.
“I’m very concerned about that too. What did you do to Mr. Rogers that made the Omega panic like that?”
Pietro rolled his eyes and quickly went in the car. Natasha stepped on the gas and drove off. "Seriously, Nat? Why that bush?"
Sam scoffed. “Trust me. Even I still couldn’t digest the situation. Long story short, these creepy Alphas are after Steve and hell no I’m letting that happen.”
Tony was stunned. “What the….Steve!” He bolted out of the elevator to see no sign of the cute blonde. “Damn he’s fast. God he’s something.” He sighed. “JARVIS, please monitor Steve Rogers going down the stairs and report to me immediately about his safety. Immediately.” He said sternly. Every fibre in his being is screaming to chase down the beautiful Omega but he knew if he did, it would make him uncomfortable and the matter worse. But he could not afford to let him go home alone especially it’s going to be night soon. Why was he alone at this hour? Why would anyone let him be alone? He at least thought that he would be with that Parker kid.
Steve gasped and whimpered. “N-No! Ah!” It was a foreign feeling but yet there was a spark that made his body tingle in pleasure. “Hnggh..”
Tony looked like a child got caught for eating cookies but shrugged it off. “It’s an essential room.”
When Bucky entered, he did not expect to see someone he thought he fired with an unfamiliar youngster.
"Look, you know what forget it. JARVIS tell me about Steve's whereabouts." Happy sighed and went back to the files he's been working on.
"Yeah but they won't put you in a high position straight away and pay a new worker that much in the beginning."
Steve smiled at that. It was true. If Bucky was here, he would that. He wants to get out of the dark place in his head and try to find hope in life. He figured that this could help him to get on track with his life. To move on and reach his dream for Bucky. He would do this for Bucky.
Both of the Omegas were currently in Stark Tower's cafeteria. Peter was looking nervously at Steve who was just staring blankly while eating.
“You’re vulnerable but you don’t want to see it. Alphas are always eyeing you that I really worry for your safety. I don’t know about you guys, but I think you need an Alpha or at least one will scent you to scare other Alphas away.”
Steve yelped and whined. "Hngh! Bucky no! Wait!" He whined even more when Bucky latches his mouth on his nipple, flicking, licking the beautiful pink bud.
Bucky chuckled and kissed his nose. He then nuzzled his face in Steve's neck, purring in satisfaction.
Pietro laughs a little and makes a teasing sound. "Aww my little twin misses me so much, huh?" He teased as he pinched both of her cheeks and stretched it hard.
"Well, I figured we should let Thor and Steve meet up and explain our plan. I mean, you all know what he's going through right now right?"
Natasha winked and smiled. "What can I say, he knew I've always had a thing for brunettes." Peggy blushed.
"Have you, ever experienced something like that?" Steve asked carefully while looking at Peter in concerned.
Bucky continued as he gives playful bite along his jaw to his neck. Steve was not sure what he was saying but he might catch a few words like Alpha or Omega.
Bucky however, wondered who was in Steve’s emergency contact. As far as he knew from his spy, Natasha, she herself is probably the only one who was really close with Steve. Though he had heard of a girl called Peggy and a guy named Clint but they were not as close to Steve like Natasha and Steve. Could the nurse be calling Natasha? It that was the case it’ll be bad. Bucky can’t let Steve know that he was using Natasha to spy on Steve.
Steve slowly opened his eyes, fling at the blinding lights entering his eyes. “Ugh..” He groaned. His head felt a little dizzy but he still tried to sit up. “What happened?” he mumbled.
Bucky growled and stood up until the other Beta spoke. “For Goodness sake, does no one realize we are in a hospital?! You’re going to make it worse for Steve!”
Steve cuts her off with a sad smile. "That's exactly it. You don't know how it feels. The feeling of losing the other half of you. Your soulmate. That star in your life that you depend on to guide you."
"I kinda know Barnes, eventhough I deal a lot with Natasha. But still we've delt with some business. I think I might know how to save Steve. It'll be even better if Natasha teams up with me too."
“Oh God!” Bucky jerked from his sleeping position at his chair over the dream. "Stevie..." He closed his eyes and growled inwardly.
She widened her eyes when she remembered about Steve's part time job. She was too preoccupied with other stuff that she forgot all about it. It also dawned on her about what Rumlow said a few days ago.
The Beta rolled his eyes. “Obviously he was still petrified of what you did. He needs time to clear his head.”
"I'm sorry dollface, but he works with Stark. I don't trust letting him go since I know he is going to rat me out to Stark."
“Well yeah he did call me, but the thing is I did plan on coming to surprise both of you this very night. Like I booked the ticket way early.”
Mrs. Barnes looked at him with a sad smile and cupped his cheek. "I know that dear, but that doesn't mean..my son is still alive. I....prayed every second that this is just a nightmare."
"Look, continue your lovey dovey moment tonight. Let's have one last dinner together before Bucky goes. Steve's idea actually."
"No! No! It's nothing! Really! I mean I know how it feels when you always feel, you know...overpowered." He looked down then looked back up to Steve to give an assuring smile.
"Well maybe you don't know him that well. There is a saying that you can't judge a book by it's a cover."
Steve nodded and quickly went into the room, closing the door. Bucky sighed. He looked down at his jean to see a large and hard tent formed. He palmed it to keep it calm. He even took off his shirt to quicken the process so he could violate his beautiful Omega.
Without any warning Bucky buried his face in the warm flesh between Steve’s legs, tongue darting out to lick the pink puckered hole.
, place of opportunities especially known for its arts and history. People can be whatever they want. Steve has always dream of being a famous artist in New York City. Bucky have been so supportive and planned to bring Steve there. A walk in the Central Park, dancing in the streets of Times Square (he loves theater ever since he was a kid) and a sweet kiss with Bucky on the Empire State Building...
“Tony, are you kidding? You were 7 when you built this. You built a mini bulldozer on your own that needs to be powered by solar energy. And the fact that you were smart enough at the time to know that the beach is always Sunny and would give you the solar power to charge it, so that it would move under the Sun for you to build your sandcastle easier is super cool.” Steve looked at him. “Wow, they really weren’t kidding about how genius you are.” He looks at him in awe.
“You’re not the alone buddy.” Natasha smirks as she stares at Tony. “I’m wondering myself why you’re so serious about this one dinner. You never care what goes into stuff, just leaving everything to Happy or me. As long as you show them your wealth and you’re done.”
“Sir, Steve Rogers has only been here for a day and he barely made it home due to James Barnes appearance so, as far of now, there is no way we could know what Steve Rogers take from here.”
"Yes, sir." Seconds later, a picture and information popped up on the screen. Tony's eyes widened in shock and accidentally spitted out his Scotch.
Bucky moves down and his tongue laps along Steve’s chest, leaving trails of saliva on his pink nipples. As the pink buds reacts to the Alpha’s touch, Barnes decides to tease. Licking and sucking the buds making the Omega rolled his eyes in pleasure. “Любимый, позволь мне показать удовольствие, которое я всегда собирался доставить тебе.”
"Wow." Was all the Alpha said as he was awestruck by the beauty the Omega holds. If only the Omega knows how good he smells to the Alpha right now and how he is making him crazy. Tony took off his sunglasses and still stares at him. He could not believe how the Omega is even more beautiful in real life. The eyes are bluer and gosh... his lips are pinkier.
“Yeah! Don’t worry, I was just overreacting!” He then realized his hand was still on Tony and quickly retracts it. “God, this is embarrassing. Mr. Stark, you were showing me your inventions. I would love to see more.” He laughs awkwardly.
"I just can't!" Bucky felt his blood boiling again at the thought of Steve being claimed by other than him. He unconsciously gripped his hips a little too rough.
Sam and Wanda nodded until a knock was on the door. Steve quickly got up to get it, trying to run away from the situation. He opened the door to find Natasha holding Panda Express plastic in her hand.
"Gosh.. New York City's skyline at night is just amazing..." Steve looks out the balcony in awe. Th city lights up beautifully.
Steve’s legs felt wobbly. He just couldn’t help that his inner Omega felt great satisfaction and achievement as he managed to make the Alpha feel good. He let out an accidental small whimper. “Ahh..”
“Oh, you must be Sam Wilson. Right this way.” The nurse leads the way and the man was right on her heels.
“Don’t act like you’re innocent Tony. You forced and scented him out of the blue.” Happy said as he made his way to both of them.
Bucky smirked and nuzzled his face in his neck. "You're mine. Have always been and will always be..."
“Of course, just shows how much you appreciate someone’s work. I see no wrong in that.” The Omega giggles and Tony just melts yet again.
"Of course I trust you. It's them I don't trust baby. They will take advantage of you when I'm not around." He growled.
"I-It's not that simple." Natasha tried to calm Steve down by reaching out her arm to soothe him but he took a step back.
Sam cleared his throat. “Oh yeah, better send you and Wanda home. You’re crashing at your brother’s, right?” Sam turned to Wanda.
"Hey, she may work for the bad guy but she's a good girl. She always talk about Steve with me even when I didn't know it was him. She would always say how sweet and strong he is and how he did not deserve the treatment the world gave him as an Omega."
Sam sighed. "But real talk. How do you know his address? I don't think you were even that close with this dude."
Bucky narrowed his eyes a little. He never heard of him. Natasha never mentioned him before. He was pissed that it was a man but the only reason he is not furious right now is that the man was a Beta as he took a whiff.
"Look, I don't know. I was guarding the front gate for hours and I just came inside with a few guys for our shift...you guys might be too late."
The Alpha ignored the Beta, too focused on the beautiful in front of him. He took a step forward towards the Omega. "You submitted to me Steve..." He smirked, arms extending to reach him.
"Shh, it's okay.You don't need to explain for your action. I'm the one that has to." She took a deep breath and notice that Steve was staring at her. She cleared her throat and gently caressed her fingers against Steve's hand.
“Peggy, please be rational. I don’t think it’s a good idea to just approach Steve with questions like that.”
Bucky leans in and leaves small kisses in Steve’s soft inner thighs, predatorily making its way to the entrance. Nose inhales the sweet scent of his beloved. He could see precum starting to ooze out.
“I-I mean I should’ve known what I got myself into. It’s my problem. I will handle it. Its’ stupid…but it is between me and him. I’m not letting anyone take the heat.”
"Well..yeah what kind of business. I mean I still don't know what exactly do you do honestly." Wanda shrugged.
"Okay let's keep this going. Peter, you know the drill. Show him all our works and tasks and guide him well. If you guys are done and got some time show Mr Rogers-"
Nat nodded. "Yes. We both have something big for you which is why we need to discuss today. Come on." She turned around to lead the way until she saw Happy trying to stop a particular billionaire who was striding towards them confidently. Even when he was wearing a pair of sunglasses, Natasha knew he had a predatory gaze on a particular blue eyed sweetheart. She groaned, annoyed that the Alpha is trying to ooze out dominance just to impress the Omega.
"I don't trust them." Bucky said as if it was nothing while he was still munching on his chicken. Peggy looked at the way he eats in disgust.
"Well you can say that cause you are a Beta. You don't experience what i experienced. You're so lucky."
“Ah, it’s nothing!” Steve looked at them, embarrassed as his face was red. It confuses the others with the 180 degrees switch of mood.
"Okay fine! I'll be honest I may or may not have been a little tipsy while you were explaining to me." Wade looked at Rumlow and Barnes guiltily.
Peggy smiled. "You know, I saw you started to sketch and paint again a few months ago. You considering to show it?"
Now how could Bucky say no to that look. "20 seconds and I'm going to knock this door down." He said eagerly.
Bucky turned around to see Stark still sitting at the waiting area with Hogan. “Oh, you’re still here?”
Steve still did not fully trust him but he slowly steps out of the elevator and walks into the hall with the Alpha following behind.
Tony seemed offended as if she thinks he would hurt him. "Excuse me, I am the most controlled Alpha out there. I am Tony Stark."
Why hello! This is my first time doing Marvel Cinematic Universe fanfic. I love Tony x Steve and Bucky and Steve pairing.  Love innocent Bottom Steve. Hope you would enjoy and patiently wait for other chapters to come.
“Pietro has a night shift this week anyway. Told him that I’m gonna have a sleepover with you and he’ll pick me up tomorrow. Now, spill.”
He could already see a few people in black at the said park which he knows it is Bucky's men and of course the familiar scent quickly hits his nose.
A dark-haired man in an expensive suit walked out of the driver’s seat of the luxurious car and everyone knew it was Stark. Tony walked passed Happy and the other agents and stopped in front of Bucky and Steve.
"Bucky! Please! No! Argh!" Steve struggled underneath Bucky as each of his wrist were pinned by the Alpha above him.
Steve didn't know where this was going but hr did noy like it. "He is a smart man, I'm sure he earned a lot."
Steve followed the instruction and felt slightly better, especially with the young Omega soothing his back. "S-Sorry, you shouldn't have seen that. I reacted very unprofessional."  He sighed.
“Well, why don’t you continue what you’re going to say over dinner tonight? My treat.” Tony gently took Steve’s hand and kissed it so tenderly.
"Tony, I am completely sure he rejected your offer. But knowing you with Steve, I doubt that you actually offered him. Did you force him?" He glared.
Peter looked at her confused, wanting to ask more but they reached the hospital. They walked through the lobby and pushed the door towards Steve’s ward area. Peter paused on his move when he saw 2 familiar faces.
Natasha could pick up his worry and tries to calm Steve down. "Steve please, don't think too much about it-"
Steve possibly just blushed three times harder and he knows he is red all over by the comment. He blinks innocently, very much confused. "I-I'm sorry?"
Natasha snaps out of it and smiled. “Well, I got to give credit to your friend Peggy too for reaching out to me.” She motioned towards Peggy and winked. Peggy looked away, blushing.
"Yeah, but she hung up on me and hold on why are you here?!" He looked angrily at Tony, wondering why he is in Steve's apartment.
They both could hear some ruckus in the club and knew the Alphas are going to come out to go after Steve. Steve whimpered and was ready to run away.
Sam and Peggy were also right behind them, not liking what the Alpha is doing to their Omega friend.
"Trust me, everyone here notice that." She rolled her eyes. "Well I'm off, Bruce and I have a date."
Steve sighed as he remembered the event with Tony a few days ago. He shook his head as he heads out of the apartment, not forgetting to lock it. 'Just forget bout what happen and focus on doing a good job at bartending. You need a huge tip, Steve.' He thought. He hopes tonight will make him forget about all the problems he has been facing lately with Bucky and Tony while focusing on the new job. But of course fate always have something in store for him.
Natasha sighed. "Look, there's no time. I feel bad enough for hiding this from you guys and I'm really sorry. But I'm not gonna risk anyone of you guys since you guys matter to Steve the most."
The Alpha starts to suck and eat out the sensitive hole that sends electricity to the Omega in the most pleasurable way possible. The Omega could not hold himself back at the new sensation and arched his back. “Bucky…” He whimpered helplessly.
The Alpha chuckled. “Wow, you’re really something. He wasn’t kidding about your stubbornness. No wonder he’s heads over heels with you.”
The Alphas were right on his heels until Happy stopped to look back at them. “I will be taking him to the hospital.” Before the angry alphas could say anything Happy spoke again. “It’s for the best. Having both of you near him now is not helping him. He’s just gonna suffocate more. Go to the hospital in separate cars.” With that, he quickly got into the car after the one of the agents safely put Steve in and drove off to the nearest hospital
"Well Steve was not entirely on board with this. But, they kinda want Steve to have this like Alpha-guardian-but-not-a-real-mate-thing going on with Steve."
Tony groaned, banged his head on the car window and looked at Pietro next to him. "Reach that friend of yours yet?"
"Well, actually his right hand man Rumlow came to my organization to hire anyone who is willing to work with James Barnes for a lot of money since he was lacking of people. I took it. I just wanted to be free from my organization. The environment was not how I want my life to be. Not saying that the working condition is better with Barnes but I guess the good thing working with Barnes is that we only sort to killing when needed instead of simply killing someone without apparent reason. But of course not trying to make it sound better. We just deal with a lot of illegal trades and stuff." Of course there were more to it than what she said but she figured Steve should know a little bit for now.
“Wait, seriously how do you know Steve?” Sam crossed his arms. He is pretty sure Steve has no Alpha friends since he kind of despise them. Knowing Steve, he prefers a small circle of friends that he trusts. And he met most of them. He was pretty sure these 4 were not in the circle.
Wanda shrugged. "I just want to know. I mean, we haven't seen each other in a while. I just want to know what my twin is up to."
“I knew I’ve always been in love with Steve ever since we were young. He was just perfect. Something happened and he wasn’t fond of it.”
Steve nervously stood outside of the Stark Industry tower. He took a deep breath and walked inside confidently. Looking around the modern futuristic ambiance, there were almost no one around the lobby except for the receptionist who was busy talking calls. Feeling bad to disturb her, he just stood there awkwardly until someone tapped him on the shoulder.
"He applied for a job there and got it. On his first day he got harassed by that CEO." Natasha said.
Steve slowly nodded and took the mug. He brought it to his mouth to take a sip, taking in the delicious warmth. "Thank you. It's really good."
Peter looked at him for awhile and hugged him. Both letting out senses of satisfaction and comfort, Omegas trait.
"Y-Yeah.." Steve quickly hung up and puts the phone on the table, shakily. "What did I just do.." He whispered.
Pietro was running for his life, making unknown turns here and there through blocks. He was so grateful that his years of experience in spy training paid off. He knows the Alpha is furious by now and will haunt him down and kill him off.
"Yeah! In one of those hundreds rooms I suppose! Nat, we're gonna get killed after looking at room number 5! Now who's gonna save Steve if both of us are dead."
"Bucky I was already considered weird in high school since I was always sick. It would be nice to have more friends that actually likes me if you stop scaring them away."
“Exactly. You told JARVIS to not let anyone go even near that room or floor. So, what changed?” Natasha crossed her arm. Tony gulped.
Natasha nodded. "We'll save Steve. Come on, I know a way." She quickly jogged into the trees with Pietro trailing behind her.
Natasha rolled her eyes. "Plus, please confess to him like ASAP. The team complained how you're always on a freaking rut just thinking about Steve. Your rut ruins their mood."
This just proves to Natasha of how a pure soul Steve is. She immediately holds his free hand. "Steve, no! In fact, you have all the right to be mad at me. I hid this from you. Don't you ever think that you need to apologize for something like this."
Bucky clicked his tongue as he grabbed Steve's chin. "You shouldn't be like that to your Alpha, doll face."
His body suddenly shivered at the thought as if he was there. He was not surprised since she worked for him but it still makes him uncomfortable. And somehow he knew that the voice message has got to do with him. He didn't know why but his thumb just moved on its own and pressed it.
"Honestly, I don't know. And I don't want to know. Cause I swear it sounded bad when I heard about it." She looked at him worried. If Natasha is worried then it is bad.
“I needed a job with better pay so I could pay off my student loans quickly. Stumbled upon the ad of the company, I knew I had to take it.” Steve shrugged a little. “Long story short, the CEO tried to claim me on the first day.”
Someone cleared her throat loudly to which everyone turned to Natasha who gave Tony a look. Tony rolled his eyes. “Well, Miss Romanoff found your work. If it weren’t for her, I wouldn’t have known but still I immediately want you in.”
Bucky went to opens it and his eyes sparkled in interest. He pulled a long chain where there were cuffs at the end.
Steve got out of their hold. "NO! H-He's out there!" He sobbed hard that he started to cough. His head started to feel light and dizzy. The world around him seems to be spinning that his head almost hit the ground if not for Sam who caught him in time.
Wanda smiled at his sincerity. "If it'll make you feel better, we'll talk to Steve again and make sure he's okay with it."
Steve blushed so hard which makes Tony smiles even wider. “U-uhm well. Mr. Stark. I need to talk to you.”
"Not gonna lie it kinda happen so fast. But he's definitely, a brunette with dark brown eyes, I guess he kinda has a goatee. Oh and he was wearing an expensive suit! I guess he's like one of those big shots. He was also buff and...."
Steve and Tony walked back in the gallery as Steve quickly lets go of Tony, much to the latter’s disappointment.
Tony was just as stunned, mouth agape. It took quite a while as they were in trance until the door to the elevator was about to close. Tony immediately stopped it with his foot.
Steve placed his hand on his Alpha's cheek. "Don't you trust me?" The sad puppy dog eyes will never fail to ignite the protective instinct of his Alpha.
With a huffed, Pietro took a deep breath and looked at Wanda seriously. "Wanda. Listen to me right now. Make sure Steve stays the hell away from Barnes."
"Lets be honest, we're Omegas...of course we go through shit but I'm grateful I haven't gone through those really worse experience like some Omegas unfortunately went through. I just usually get cornered and catcalled...a lot." Peter just stared at his food.
"I uhmm...let's just say I came from quite a weird military-like assassin of a family. My whole family is pretty good with guns. I can't remember how but I went to this....well, more like forced to go, to a boarding school where it specializes in becoming an assassin." Natasha paused a little as she saw Steve's stunned face.
“Fine, you wanna know curious boy? This guy beside me is his childhood friend and Stark over here is Steve’s new boss who both apparently are obsessed with your friend and are fighting to claim him.”
Wanda hugged him and soothes his arm. “Ssshhh, it’s okay. You’re safe with us.” Wanda’s gaze fell on his neck and gasped a little. “Steve, I think you should look in the mirror.”
“You asked the trouble yourself by interfering with my Omega and I.” He growled and pulled Steve closed by his waist securely to his waist.
I AM SO SORRY I HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATING FOR A LONG TIME. I am super busy with online classes, families and pretty much everything.
Upon Bucky's eyes stood Steve in nothing but a black stocking and black lace panties that accentuate his perfectly curvy hips. How is it possible to be this beautiful and sexy at the same time? He has the heart and face of an Angel but a body of a vixen. It should be a sin to be this perfect.
Bucky gave a nervous laugh as he leans down and leaves trails of wet kisses around Steve’s neck that was not covered by the collar.
As if on cue Brock Rumlow came into the mansion and stared at the scene especially towards Peter in confusion. He cursed under his breath and glared at Wade Wilson.
"Wait...Steve, is Mr. Stark the Alpha you were talking about this whole time?" Peter looked at Steve.
That put Steve out of his daze and pushed Bucky away. "Stop!" He breathed heavily. "You did that on purpose..." He whispered.
"Look, I think it will be gentleman of me to give him flowers as to offer my protection so that he feels calm and safe."
"Wow there is a hundred of agents out here and none of 'em seem to find Steve.Fantastic!" At this point Tony was out of his mind. Not only he is desperate to find his Omega but the fact that his arm is also hurting are not helping the situation.
Sam smirked. He was not one of those people who would just obey any Alpha’s command. It was kind of an unspoken thing where Betas and Omegas are obliged to listen Alphas as they are considered superior. He had always thought that it was bullshit. “Honestly, I would like to see you try.”
"How about you treat that damn wound first so you can continue to search for him quickly." Happy glared.
Sharon worriedly nodded. Steve got out of the bar to which Bucky quickly slides his hand around his waist and walked towards the VIP room. Steve wanted to push that hand so badly but he didn't want to make a scene especially on his first day. They entered the room and Steve pushed Bucky away.
"Look, yes. But I didn't know that she was assigned by Barnes to look after Steve. I mean I didn't know the Omega he was obsessed with all this time was Steve until Wanda mentioned the name Bucky."
Steve collapsed before he finished, in the arms of Sam and Peggy who immediately caught him in time.
Steve's eyes widened and gasped when he remembered the hickey Tony gave him. "A-Alpha..." He whimpered in fear.
"Oh yeah! The new guy for the management department. I'm Happy by the way." He extended his hand where Steve immediately shook it.
He wondered how he knew his address but then realized he must’ve seen his resume. He sighed. Now he is thinking twice about working there. Pepper gave him a call last night that he could just officially start next week unless if he chose not to since she understands the circumstances he was in. He was not sure what the right decision would be. Working in a multi-billionaire company like the Stark Industries is considered a blessing and not everyone many has that opportunity especially Omegas in the corporate world. He knows the pay would help him so much in settling his student loans quicker. But the risk was just as strong that he kept contemplating it.
"Well while I was getting my wallet he said that some random Alpha kinda harassed him, scenting him and all. It was near that famous Taco truck. I figure i should tell you since it can be dangerous having someone like that lurking around."
Tony realized what he did and completely replaced it by producing a soothing one which actually helped a little now that the Omega seems less tensed.
Steve looked up to her with an unreadable expression. It was until Steve's eyes were glossy. Tears fell rapidly as it streams down his cheeks.
“Wanda Maximoff. Steve and I are besties ever since Stanford. I just landed here last night from Russia wanting to surprise him and then I got a text from a good friend of ours saying he was in a hospital.” She looked at him worried.
“Yes, we are Steve. I will not let any Alpha’s dirty paw do you like that! I will fight till my last breath if I have-“ Sam was silenced with a hand softly caressing his cheek.
Steve turns towards them to take a deep breath before he started to tear up. "I just wanna I'm sorry..."
“H-Happy?” His mind suddenly was flooded with memories of the latest event. “O-Oh God.. did it happen? L-Last night..”
Natasha rolled her eyes. "If he can make a Beta like me to want to eat him. I'm sure you would mount him the moment you see him. And Tony I've met him. He's not like other Omegas. He's a gentle soul."
Sam looked at him and Tony. “Wait! You work for this dude?” He pointed at Tony which Tony gave him a look.
"That was my idea! Plus, I already did. He is supposed to meet us the day after tomorrow. I immediately put him in the list when I met him."
Rumlow gave him a look. "You think? There were literally 2 Omegas on the list and Steve Rogers is Barnes's Omega while the other is Peter Parker who works with him at Stark."
“You want to sure more right?” Steve looked at him pleadingly, giving him a look that he does not want them to know. God those sky blue eyes are going to be the death of him.
Bucky clawed the sides of Steve's hips, making him whimper with blue eyes begging the Alpha to stop.
"F-Fuck! Steve baby.." Bucky moaned at the wonderful friction on his member, gripping the sheets in frustration.
Sam sighed as he looked at them slumbering Steve. He looked calm and in peace which melts his heart. Steve deserved to get a good sleep to recharge himself. He looked at him and smiled sadly. He wished that he could be the one to comfort him. He wished he could protect him.
"Sure, hun." Natasha caressed his cheek. "I'm gonna go wash up. If you need anything just knock on my door right next to your room. Unless you want some company for tonight.." She smirked.
Nat raised her brow in amusement and turned to Tony. "Well, well, well, seems like someone has crush on the shy Stevie..." She whistled.
Tony cleared his throat. “Steve, when I laid my eyes on your work, I was blown away. It was impeccable. Thank God I found your work.”
"Look, I don't exactly know what happen between you two..but I'm sure Steve would understand if you just explain to him. He is a sweetheart. Sure he'll understand."
Steve looked away, humiliated for what he's doing. He kept on pushing Bucky even when he knows it would be no use. Bucky hummed in satisfaction as he sucks and pulls Steve's nipple. Steve jerks in surprise, body tingling from the new sensation. He bit his lips to stop himself from moaning out loud, not letting Bucky have the satisfaction which made Bucky furious inwardly.
Steve blushed at her comment which Natasha chuckled. "He said that you are his Omega and he wants you to be protected at all times. Not going to lie most of us would never even thought that he had a heart."
"You Alphas think you can just rule the world huh?" Steve looked at him hurt. The Alpha felt the urge to provide his comfort for his Omega.
Now, that put Tony off guard, even Happy is focused on JARVIS. "What? Where did he go? It's late night."
I just want to shouout to floklo for helping me translate the English words to Russian!! Goodness I don’t know what I’ll do without her. Thank you! Thank you! Give your love to floklo! A million thanks for helping me!
Steve was just speechless at that point. Bucky may be tough and rough but he is still a nice guy at heart. Never in his right mind he would think that Bucky would be involved in this sort of activities.
The woman smirked and ready to walk out until she turned around. "Oh, forgot to tell you. Just found out that your sweet little omega of yours has another part time job on weekends."
Natasha laughs a little."He is a real polite sweetheart. Kind and there is a bit of sass in him. The most adorable thing I've ever seen."
Steve pulled it away quickly. “Mr.Stark, I came here to show my gratitude for yesterday, but I still have not forgotten the events before.” Steve’s cheeks were flushed of embarrassment.
Sam shook his head and stood up. Suddenly feel thirsty. He walked out of the room towards the waiting area.
Thor laughed. "Well, no Omegas should ever be treated like that. All of us should be well respected."
Few days passed and it was now the weekend. Steve sighed as he was getting ready for his part time job. He was ready to head out when his eyes stumbled upon the roses in his vase in the living room.
“I put something in your water remember? That pill is supposed to trigger your heat.” He said darkly. “Perfect time to breed you with our pups.”
Tony pulled his hair in frustrations. He knew he screwed up but he can't help it. There was something about that beautiful Omega that just draws him in and couldn't even think rationally.
Nat rolled her eyes and glared at Tony who is in front of them. She then glared at Happy. "You were suppose wait with him at the office. I told you that I'll bring them to you." She whispers, angrily.
Natasha wondered who his friends were. So far she knew about Clint and Peggy. “Oh, Clint and Peggy I assume?”
"Yeah...he is really beautiful." He looked at Steve's photo on his tablet again. Gosh those blue eyes really draws him to him.
"Hey, your paintings will be awed by everyone. And I'm sure Bucky would want you to do this. I know for a fact that he would be the one to drive you there so that you could showcase your art to everyone."
Bucky whispered in his ear, his warm breath tickling Steve’s nerves. Steve knew it was Russian, he heard Bucky talks with his father sometimes in their mother tongue. Most of the times, it was just arguments. The Omega was taken aback why he is suddenly speaking in Russian.
Steve found himself shaking nervously under the Alpha's dark heavy gaze. His stand hold so much power and authority that his heart just beats rapidly. He may be wearing a pair of sunglasses but because it was brown and translucent, he can tell that he is looking straight into his soul. He gulps and felt intimidated. If only he knows that the Alpha felt the same way.
"Fuck. Those old geezers only knows how to push people. Try making an Eco-friendly robot your fucking self!" He slammed his office door and tossed his blazer on the couch.
Tony growled and went to follow Steve until Happy grabbed his elbow. The Alpha glared and grabbed Happy’s collar, eyes furious. “Why are you always in the way?!”
"Look, I'd love to but these stupid meetings can't seem to wait." He said annoyed, as he type vigorously on his smartphone while muttering some cursed words. "Plus, since I have entrusted you with this art exhibition, if you think it's great then put him in."
Pepper nodded as she search places with the given information on the modern hologram screen. Wanda and Sam were just awed at the technology in front of them. “Alright, so I am searching for any property that Barnes or his father might have purchased temporarily or permanently in the whole New York.”
"Yea that's the one." Pietro said as he got out the car. Tony and Happy followed right behind with Happy getting reading with a gun.
"How did I do wrong? I gave him flowers, I asked him nicely..and I offered him the world, anything he wants!"
Peggy nodded in understanding. "You're right. Maybe I don't know what you are exactly feeling as of now. But I do know one thing for sure." She grabbed Steve's hand and gave it a squeeze. "Is that Bucky would never want you to be like this."
Sam felt heartbroken at the sight. He completely detest everything that came out of his mouth just now but after calming down and digest Wanda’s suggestion, he thinks that it could work to protect Steve from those 2 Alphas.
"I mean do you have a theme or venue you've been thinking of? Colours? Flowers? You must've thought about them!" Peggy asked eagerly. She is going to be his maid of honour.
He literally counts the seconds and when it was on the 19th he storms in the room only to stop in his track, mouth dropped.
Peggy smirked. "Calm down blondie.." She then turned to Sam. "Look Sam, you really got to work on your jealousy-"
James raised his brow, face turned dark. “Belongs to Stark?” He scoffed. “I think you got that one entirely wrong Hogan. Steve has always been mine.” He growled.
“Steve, I’m so sorry. I just don’t know what was wrong with me. It just slipped! I don’t know what came over me!” The Alpha desperately pleaded.
She sighed as she walked down the street. She felt contradicted. She doesn't know the right choice. On one hand, she has to fulfill her duty as consequences is inevitable. And on the other, she is dying to tell the truth to Steve even if it might cost her head by Barnes. Plus, she even thought about quitting her profession and be a normal person. The times she had spent with Steve makes her feel the beauty of just having a simple life. Maybe if she got out of it, she can actually protect Steve especially from Barnes herself. She sighed again, she wonders what Steve is doing right now on a weekend night.
Bucky melted at his adorable Omega and pulled him in to kiss him passionately. He lets go when Steve was out of breath. "Of course sweetheart. And I expect you to wait for me like a good little Omega. You're going to welcome me home and give me a special  present in the bedroom, right Omega?" He smirked.
"Yes, I know! But I can't help my instinct. I've been patient for trying to take it slow but..I was scared that others will take you away from me. I have always knew that you were the one for me even before we represented. I have always been in love with you." Bucky looked at Steve deeply in his eyes.
"I don't think it would be any use considering those two Alphas are powerful and influential. Can you believe that one of them is Tony Stark, the cocky billionaire?"
"Uhm yeah she is...Wait what do you mean she took him? And they're both gone? Where did they go?" Sam was impatient at that point and his mind was just full of questions.
“Damn, Steve. I’m sorry. Should never forced you tell when you’re still uncomfortable. I just needed to know so that I could help.”
He smiled as he remembered himself developing a crush on the sparkling blue eyes during their studies.
“You in a healthy condition is enough for me.” Tony smiled as he took the bag and put it on his desk. His heart fluttered and purred in satisfaction at the Omega’s gratitude. “Plus, this gift from you is worth even more than the expenses.”
“Tony, these are amazing. I would have never really taken you as a history collector. N-No offense! I just-”
He was silenced with Steve's index finger on his lips as he was slowly being lead towards the bed and sat down.
Tony just finds all his behaviours so cute that his chest felt so warm. "Yeah, well I kinda mean it that you can't live here anymore."
"I can give you so much to offer. I can provide you with anything that you want. I will give you the whole world. I will always love you unconditionally. I am the Alpha for you." He pleaded.
“No! Please, just let me try. I can handle this.” Steve pleads as he looks into Sam’s eyes. “Please.”
"Oh, I've seen him once. He has a slightly long hair, blue eyes. And definitely has looks that could kill." Well, that fit the description of James Barnes.
Peter was diligently working on some codes as he vigorously type the keyboards. He made such adorable frustrated expressions that made the Alpha in the room smiled.
Tony and Bucky growled at him. “You stay away from him.” Bucky got closer to Sam. “You will not interfere my relationship with Steve. I suggest you walk away while I’m being nice.”
"Now that I think about it, I don't really know. I mean he is just very reserved that he does thing without saying much. He's always busy meeting people. Heard from my late mom that he helped flourish the young entrepreneurs in New York with their businesses."
Steve takes a deep breath as he walked towards his destination. Every nerve inside of him is tingling. He doesn't know if he made the right decision but he knows he has to. He doesn't know what Bucky is capable of.
Tony rests his head on Steve’s shoulder as he tightly hugged him. “I want to be your Alpha.” He whispered as he kissed his ear, giving it a little tug.
Thor nodded. "I do. And that's why it made me want to protect and help him more now. I uhm..honestly wish I could've done more. I have seen Alphas after him but I was kind of at my last semester so I couldn't do much. But I did teach those idiots a lesson though."
“What? That is some accusation there Romanoff.” The Alpha didn’t even lift his eyes from the glass that he is currently swirling around.
"The hell is wrong with you?" She looked at him weirdly but Tony ignores her and continues staring at this fine, beautiful Steve Rogers.
Steve gulped and Wanda sensed his discomfort. She walked over to him and soothes his arm. “Relax, Steve. We’re not mad. We just need to know this because you seem to fear them and we want to protect you.”
Nat puts her hand on his shoulder. "Steve please. You have such a raw and different outlook of art that is really spectacular, it shows in your work. It deserves to be known."
"His friends Sam and Wanda." Well, that was obviously a lie. With Bucky placing her to spy on Steve and Rumlow's mouth, she practically knows everything that is going on which makes her guilty.
Alpha Tony Stark is recognizing and even valuing your talent so much that he puts together a solo platform for you is a once in a lifetime chance.
"Don't worry I'm going to get Steve back okay." Nat hung up. There's going to be a lot of explaining to do.
“Oh dear God, 5 then!” Tony shook his head. “Sorry Steve-.“ He turned to look at Steve who seems to be a little confused, looking above.
"Dear God, why can't nobody do their work right?" Tony sighed as he hung up. 'Damn it, there's a long line at the truck..I'll just go inside..'
"What." Tony gritted his teeth. Dark aura surrounded him, displaying an intimidating Alpha that he is which made the whole people in the room shiver in fear.
Wanda ran past them to go in the room, before she reached the door knob to take a look at them. “You go near Steve, you feel my wrath.” And then she went in.
Happy seemed please to see his friend/boss melting because of Omega Steve. “Well, you have to sort out that tomorrow yourself, alright?”
“He should have known better not to interfere with my Omega and I.” He said as he wiped a bit of blood at the corner of his lips.
“Exactly, there’s a possibility that most of this is unused. Peter do you remember anything that we could narrow it down?”
The Alpha growled and pulls out, strings of saliva trails around. “Why are you suppressing your moans?”
“S-Stop it!” He kept on pushing Bucky but it seems like his Omega side is slowly purring into the Alpha’s sensual touch.
“Of course, Tony. Asking someone to marry right after you just met them a few minutes is a very normal slip of the tongue kind of thing.” Happy is torn between laughing out loud or smacking some sense in Tony’s head.
Tony was in a daze ever since he reached his office. All he did was just stare at his desk, thinking about Steve, his Omega. Yesterday was just a mess. He never knew his nemesis knew the lovely Omega. His nose suddenly smelled a familiar vanilla scent. He looked at the door to where the faint smell came from. He felt like he was going crazy as he knew that scent so well. A knock made him a little surprise.
"I don't think she told all but I think I know enough. At least the basic." Steve shrugged a little.
“For goodness sake Tony! How could you hit Happy?!” Pepper said as she wiped the blood coming down from Happy’s nose.
"Peggy, you do know we're only in Brooklyn. We can just take the subway. We don't have to actually sleep there."
"I know when after Bucky was gone...sometimes I shut myself from everyone. I'm sorry that you sacrifice both of your time just to take care of me. I-I wanna say thank you so much...for always being there for me..when I needed the most...especially when Bucky's not here anymore." He sobbed when the name came up. "F-For encouraging me to do this, for coming here with me. Being with me..For everything." He said as he wiped his tears.
"I'll let him go but of course, there is a condition. You." He points at Peter. "Will be watched by him." He said as he points at Wade Wilson. "He'll follow you every step of the way to make sure you do not tell Stark. If you do, I'll let him end you or do whatever he wants."
Peter looked at her nervously. He never knew a sweet girl like her would have a dangerous streak. He unconsciously went to Happy’s side for support.
"Oh my God Steve! This is your big moment. This will be one of our best adventures!" Peggy interlinks her hand with Steve's.
"In my defense, there were too much people around Steve Rogers you asked me to look out on. Got confused. There was the best friend Sam who had the same last name as mine, that red head Wanda girl..and there's that people from Stark like Hogan-" Wade was rambling on until Rumlow groaned.
Steve does not know why he’s blushing hard at that comment but he’s mostly just surprised. Wanda and Sam just gave him a look when they saw how red Steve’s cheeks were. “I-I’m sure that’s not true. Y-You know I better go.” He looked at Sam
Pietro looked at her shocked. "This mansion is not big enough that he had to-" With that Natasha hits head.
"Instagram. Plus, we sometimes work together at events in Stanford." Wanda knocked on the door and waited.
"I'll let him off but only because of you doll face." Bucky smirks at Steve but the latter looks away.
Tony thought for awhile and shrugged. "Guess we could use him but put him in the front lines. At least if anything happens he'll be dead first." Said as if it was nothing.
"Well i definitely heard of him on TV but only saw him like a few times. Not that familiar actually."
"Look, I just need to know. You're pretty secretive about your job and it seems look you're doing well considering you keep sending me money."
Steve looked blankly at his pile of clothes. Why did he accept it? Suddenly, Bucky’s face emerges in his mind. Sadness was plastered on his face and Peggy and Sam knew they shouldn’t bring that up. Both Betas comforts the Omega with their soothing scent as Steve lets out scent of distressed.
“Steve! Where were you?!” Peggy got up from the couch and rushed towards Steve who just entered the office with Tony.
“That’s not how you treat your Alpha.” He pushed the door wide open that Steve took a step back. He went inside and closed the door, locking it in the process.
"That has to be the most mushy-" He couldn't finish his sentence as Peggy threw a pillow at him and gave him the 'don't-interrupt-their-precious-moment' look.
'He's cute-shut the hell up Wade he is a kid damn it!' He sighs. 'God, what's wrong with me?' He cleared his throat as he starts to speak softly. "Where'd you learn all this kid?"
"I got it from a friend who is very close to this artist. He's very talented, I can tell." She said confidently.
"Well, get to work then. Find any abandon building or apartment but I highly doubt they would be in one. So, go through all apartment buildings that might have cameras at the entrance. "
"Well, more towards supervising the operation here. Gotta make sure my club doesn't have a lousy service."
Steve gulps. He did not like where this is going but pushed the feeling away. "Yeah, that would be me. W-Where is-"
“You don’t talk to her like that Stark.” Natasha growled and stood next to her. Peggy may or may not have blushed at that.
Tony gave a breathy laugh. “Then, can you explain why do you still have the roses I gave you this morning.” He motioned his head towards the flowers at his living room behind him.
"Hey!-" Tony hung up and picked up one of the paintings. He took the glass with refilled Scotch and sat down on the couch, admiring it.
“Well, you are Tony Stark.” Steve smiled as he looked at all decades of prototypes. “At least these stuff are in good hands. They do need someone like you to keep it safe.”
Peter gently broke the hug as he hold her hand. "But I don't really know the exact place since I was kidnapped in a super dark tinted car. Even he doesn't know it since it was one of that Mafia guy's people who drove us. I'm so sorry that I don't know the exact location. But I do know it's in this big ass mansion, an hour and a half drive from here."
“Well, I just want this fantastic artist right here to get comfortable with me.” Tony smiled at Steve who the latter blushed, looking down at his shoes.
He stopped when he found some bushes with berries at an apartment block and sat down to fish out his phone.
With that, the Alphas forgot about the war they plan to execute and focus immediately on the Omega who now seems to be sleeping in Bucky’s arm.
“And that’s good! But again, there’s only so much you can do. You need to take care of your health too Steve.”
Pietro sighed and shook his head. "She probably switched her phone off. Didn't reply any of my text."
That topic seems to do the trick as it quickly shifts Steve from his sadness. “O-Oh, that…nothing. It was nothing.” He shook his head.
"Not exactly, in fact we barely talked. I mean we've worked together for an event back then but even then we didn't talk much."
Bucky turned to Steve. "Thank you so much for the dinner tonight baby. It was a really nice gift of us hanging out together." Bucky places wet kisses on Steve's neck, tracing up to his lips.
"Yes, sir." It took 3 seconds before JARVIS is back with another respond. "Sir, I have found the location of Mr. Rogers. He went into a club called Midnight."
“It’s not nothing if you’re sent to a hospital! The nurse on the phone told me that you fainted due to stress. Damn it, I knew you were working too hard again.”
Tony laughs a little. “Yeah, they’re always like that.” Tony just smiles as he stares at him which made Steve a little uncomfortable. He realized the Alpha’s arm is still around him and gently nudges to which the Alpha reluctantly lets go.
"Yeah, very cooperative. Liked my idea of protecting you. That Beta is pretty worried about you living alone you know?"
"Indeed. Though I won't deny that sometimes he seems to be able to protect himself. He is a very determined thing isn't he? I'm always impressed at how capable he is in handling those situations. When I want to step in it seems like he settles it."
“T-That’s very nice of you. Miss Romanoff and Mr. Stark.” He smiled shyly. Peggy and Sam just stared at Steve’s shy demeanor. They have never seen him so timid with another Alpha. He usually acts normally.
"I don't know yet but lately I feel like he's not in his right mind especially after both your encounter together. It didn't feel good, I want to take you far away from him. And that's what brought us now."
With a deep breath Steve took a deep breath. "Y-you can't tell me what to do...Ah! No! Stop!" Steve struggled against Bucky's thigh which was rubbing against Steve's crotch.
Tony swiftly wrapped his arm around his waist tightly and nuzzled his face in the crook of his neck, scenting him. His mouth opened, teeth almost scraping the skin.
Rumlow sighed. "Look Nat, don't try to fight him on this alright? It's not gonna end well if you do."
Sam sighed. “Don’t mind him Wanda. You know how stubborn he is.” Steve glared at Sam as he shrugged. “I’m not wrong am I?”
Bucky just stared at him in amusement especially intrigued towards the watery blue eyes. “Righteous as always.”
“I-I’m surprised that you came to work today. Happy told me that you took a day off.” Tony walked around his table to stand in front of Steve.
Tony hold his cheek in shock, couldn't digest the fact that the omega hit him. He looked at the Omega who glared at him.
"For the millionth time I did! Didn't you hear me all those time?" She looked at him a little pissed. "Don't worry, you will meet him tomorrow in fact."
Steve was surprised with the sudden intrusion but he quickly keeps his composure with hands behind his back."Do you like it Alpha?"
Tony stared down at him. "Do it." Happy gulped as he inwardly curse. He typed something on his phone to alert JARVIS.
"Mrs. Barnes, they said that they could not find his body! So he has to be out there somewhere, probably hurting." Steve whimpered at the thought of his hurt and probably wounded Alpha.
Tony just blinked. No one ever gave him such a huge compliment on something he built so simple as a kid aside from his late mother. Not even his late father ever complimented him that much. But this Omega just made him feel so warm and fuzzy inside. His Alpha is purring in satisfaction that he might be going insane.
“Steve, you know that’s not it.” Wanda looked at him, concerned. “You always push yourself too hard that it is affecting your health.”
“The nurse called his emergency contact. So probably his guardian or relative is coming over. So, do me or at least Steve a favour and behave.” With that, Happy walked to a vending machine to get some coffee.
Tony sighs and just stares at his desk, imagining Steve was sitting there. “He…is just so different in such a good way. Kind, beautiful, talented artist. He makes me feel..warm and fuzzy.” He did not realize that he has been smiling the whole time.
Did Bucky really mean that? Would he really do that to Natasha? He is not a cruel person. But then again he does not know this Bucky. If his friends were here to see what he is doing now, they would freak out. He pressed number without thinking. After a few rings it stopped. Steve gulps.
"You know Steve. As much as I do not want to be separated from you, don't you want to consider to live with Mrs. Barnes? She really insists you to take up her offer and follow her with Mr. Barnes. She wants to take care of you. She practically begged me everytime she called."
"No, it' fine. It's about Steve anyway." She stood up and bid the other goodbyes as she walked out of the cafe.
Sam cleared his throat. "Don't wanna be rude but why do you want to help Steve? No Alpha just wants to help to protect Steve. I mean you remember what happen back in Stanford right?"
Peter suddenly felt bad and looked at him guiltily. This guy did ends up helping him out with Steve anyway. He couldn’t be that bad.
“But you gotta make sure to take care of yourself after this.” The nurse said as she was writing on a file. “I’m gonna go and settle your bills.”
Bucky groaned and massaged his temple. "Fucking hell, Rumlow just get rid of Wilson since you and the others apparently could not even find a good mercenary."
"I mean it is a grand thing right? I mean we're talking about Stark Industries. A billion dollar company. They probably have better artists...I mean I'm even surprise that your friend Natasha wanted me to even be in the gallery showcase. It just feels so surreal..now tomorrow we're gonna meet again to talk about the event. I-I..what if I embarrass myself..what-"
As much as he hates to admit it, the kiss felt so good that it melts Steve away into Bucky's familiar relaxing scent, just like old times. Unconsciously, he moaned which gave Bucky deeper access into the kiss and smirked, purring in satisfaction.
"I know this does not seem ideal to you but..." Tony walked around his desk so that he could go close to the Omega. "You're lying if you say that you didn't feel attracted towards me. There was a spark. I know it." He said sternly.
Tony then remembered that Barnes told him that they were childhood friends. He growled and clicked his tongue.
Bucky brought out his phone to call. "Rumlow, find out whether Romanoff has another address aside from the one she supposedly have. Make it quick before I put a bullet in your head too aside from Romanoff."
Sam scoffed. “Oh, you’re not playing innocent tonight. You know what we’re talking about.” He said sternly.
"Will you just take a sec to look at these paintings! I can assure you they're amazing. Keep in mind that this is coming from me."
“N-No! Stop!” Steve thrashed his head on the bed, sweating. “A-Ah no! Please..” His tears start streaming down.
There was something dark in Tony’s eyes that screams authority. His aura changed that screams dominating. Steve gulped and let out a distress pheromone that heightened the Alpha’s protective and possessive instinct.
Most of the time not everyone appreciates what Tony does but with Steve…it felt very genuine as if he understands what he does. He felt like he could be himself around him.
"As you wish, Mr. Stark." Just seconds later, a small part of the wall opens to display a glass of scotch. Tony snatched and gulp it down. He sighed.
Thor looked at Sam and Wanda. "Remember all the events that I lead? I was in charge of the funds so I had to find a lot of sponsors. And somehow I got contacts from friends who knows that Stark guy and from there, he sponsors most of our programs."
Sam and Wanda looked doubtful but calm enough to listen to her as Peter just shifted uncomfortably due to the tension in the room.
“Of course, Bucky would kill them if you said yes and those bodies of Alphas would never be found. What we’re surprised is that you accepted this one.” Peggy said as she plopped down besides Steve helping him to find an outfit.
