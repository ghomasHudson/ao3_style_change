He sighed, closing his eyes and leaning back in his chair. He didn't know how he was going to cope with this interview and he didn't want to discuss it with any of his superiors.
Greg was about to ask what was taking so long, but he spotted John holding Finn and knew instantly. He was stood beside Mycroft, his girls beside him.
Sherlock studied him carefully and the doctor was more than aware what he wanted. He pulled away and turned his back on his sub to fill the sink with warm water.
At that, Finn looked at Sherlock and smiled. He liked being called trouble if that meant he was like him.
"Be still, Holmes!" John barked, his tone sharp. There was nothing for it, the doctor let the crop fly several times in a row until Sherlock was making heavy breathing sounds around his gag. "Have you had enough, boy?" John asked, panting.
John spun around to the floor in front of his sub, tucking his leg in under himself so he could kneel.
Sometime later, not even John knew how long, he leant forward and tapped him on the shoulder, trying not to make him jump. He had watched him throughout that indefinite time period and his sub had not moved once. In fact, if it wasn’t for his chest rising and falling, first erratically, then more steadily, he would have said he wasn’t breathing at all. “You ready for a bit of a cuddle now?”
“How’s your wrist feeling?” the Dom asked, deciding to change the subject for the both of them. Now that he knew his pet wanted to stay and it wasn’t just Panic talking last night, he felt more comfortable in manoeuvring him about. He lifted his wrist up to examine it and slowly unwrapped the bandage that he had secured around it last night. It wasn’t as swollen as it could have been and John kissed it softly, checking the trails of different colour bruising. He reached for the drawer and pulled out a fresh bandage and gently began wrapping it up again. Sherlock winced and the doctor immediately froze.
“Luck,” Sherlock countered. He eyed the rest of the room, he didn't need to find a way out, he could see the door.
He sat beside the sub’s head and brushed his fingers across his cheek. “I wish you would just tell me what the problem was, rather than making me go through all of this with you.” He sighed heavily and caught a few of his curls in his fist. “Rather embarrassing in front of big brother, don’t you think?”
Within mere minutes, Sherlock was buckled, hand, feet, neck and hips down to the bench in comfortable padded cuffs.
Sherlock fumed as the two Doms giggled. For his part, Mycroft started thrashing madly. "Gregory! That's not fair!"
Sally ignored him, she had been in early to prepare for an early interview with Sherlock. She had been informed the night before by a friend in uniform that the boy had ditched his solicitor when the guy hadn't done anything about the shoes that had been found. It was the perfect opportunity to get to the bottom of this mess and more importantly have Sherlock remanded in custody without bail. Where he should be.
But it seemed to be the wrong thing to do, as Finn’s eyes widened in horror and he took off towards the toilets leaving the bowl on the side.
“Correct. I did. I punished you that way to make a point. The fact you were uncomfortable was not the issue, but helped to reinforce my point. Now, stand up.”
“Basically a cab that slowed down,” John asked, still trying to catch up with what was going on. Why had they chased it in the first place?
"Why?" Greg asked. "You got pissed off with him for acting out for so long. There's nothing wrong with that. I can't even say you overreacted by wanting to leave. I would have done. This is his way of making sure."
"If I might interject," Mycroft couldn't hold his tongue any longer. "Yes, you hate him being perfect, but you hate him being the way he has been these last few days even more. There's a middle ground you've found over the years. You've just lost it."
Eventually, John reached out and ran a hand down his boy's arm, enjoying the feel of the well sculpted muscles, it seemed Sherlock was determined to stay still forever.
The doctor ran the cloth over every inch of Sherlock's back, then he turned his pet around and started on his front. When he got to Sherlock's caged cock and bollocks, he washed them clinically, with as little stimulation as possible.
At that moment, the sound of Sherlock kicking up a fuss came from one of the screens. Both John and Greg turned to look at it.
The detective kept incredibly still as John played with him. All the way up until there was a knock on the door and the British Government was holding a tray.
“I don’t know why you need the little rebellion amongst everything we do. It’s constant. You must exhaust yourself.”
Sherlock sighed, but began to obey. He knelt up straight and moved his hands behind him to rest in the small of his back.
Sherlock looked to him in surprise at that, he was in really bad trouble, why was the Dom taking him to the den, that was where they went when he had been good.
"I'll have to have a talk with Gregory," Mycroft said. "I can't imagine why he didn't tell me." The government official picked at some imaginary lint on his trousers.
As quickly as he could, Mycroft crawled through to their bedroom and retrieved the cuffs. He hoped he'd already received his punishment and that they were going to be used for play.
“I. Don’t. Care!” He hissed, gripping his pet by the curls. “This relationship, this contract comes before any case. Kneel.”
"If you don't cooperate, Sherlock, I'll make Mycroft do what I have in mind. I'll count to 5. Make your decision before I finish."
Greg crawled across the room, his cock hard and aching between his legs. In the kitchen, he fetched a beer from the fridge, then crawled back to John.
Sherlock’s phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen. On it was a message from his brother. Mycroft and Greg were waiting out in the car.
John settled on the sofa and then pulled his sub down so he was laid out across it, his head in his lap.
"Oh, don't be that way," the doctor said gently. "We may have been laughing at you, but we didn't mean anything by it. You know that. I love you, you git."
"Why am I like this?" Sherlock asked his friend. "Why do I always push too far? I always have." He looked incredibly dejected and so very young.
John took his hand. “Don’t you dare go into Panic, pet, there is no need.” Mycroft moved out the way, so the Dom slipped from the sofa and crouched in front of Sherlock, taking his other hand as well.
Sherlock began walking to the end of the street, he could maybe get a cab and hold it until John was done. But then he realised that John had asked him for the plan. Which meant he had no idea. Even though it appeared he was taking the lead, which he was glad about. It was great the way the Dom didn’t immediately take over something he wasn’t fluent in. John had said that as he was him, out of his own choice, that they would need to stay together, rely on each other, and that he needed to be polite and then they could act like friends. He knew the Dom would step in when he was out of line though, like he had in the house.
Sherlock breathed deep, smelling John, calming down. John wasn’t hurting him. John was comforting him. He was doing that aftercare thing again, for the fourth time was it? And he’d been with him less than 24 hours. Why wasn’t he getting impatient and angry? Things were getting more confusing than ever.
The doctor set it down by Greg and grabbed out a couple of ice cubes for himself. He went over and ran them over Sherlock's nipples, enojoying the jolt of surprise and watching him squirm as he tried to get away from them.
Sherlock howled, though it was muffled by the gag. Actual tears came to his eyes and he would have kicked his feet if they hadn't been tied in place, but just for the pure principle of it, the detective continued to struggle.
Sherlock had been good the past few days and their second week together was nearly over. Physically, Sherlock was a lot better. His wrist had healed of the slight sprain and the bruises were practically gone. His brat had spent the majority of the day persuading John to play with him. He’d finally caved in and Sherlock was now knelt by the door to the playroom. One of John’s little rituals, the kneeling outside part, he said it helped him to get into the right headspace. Sherlock disagreed. It was just boring.
Sherlock kept his head bowed as John dealt with the bowl and the soap. He didn’t realise the Dom was done until his curls were grabbed once again and he was dragged to his feet, forced over the sink.
Sherlock ignored the older man as he stared at him and held in his snort when John sighed. The blond used a finger in Sherlock’s collar to drag him from the seat and force him to his knees. As he moved to chain the cuffs to the floor he spotted Sherlock’s phone in his hand before he had a chance.
Mr. Holmes hugged the little boy to him, tucking Finn's head beneath his chin. "I love hearing that, sprout."
The government official was completely caught off guard, however, when Greg bent and started kissing the red marks left by his hand.
Sherlock caught sight of the window where he'd escaped from all those weeks ago. John now had it bolted and completely Sherlock proof. It made the detective huff. The doctor hadn't touched it after Sherlock's escape, he'd understood why he'd gotten out and accepted that he hadn't actually run off and had no need to further block that escape, it seemed now he did.
Over the speakers came a distinctive sound, one that was identical to a ringtone on Sherlock's phone: Irene Adler's ringtone.
The doctor flicked a switch and let the machine begin its job. Slowly at first, to check there was enough lube and no chafing, but he soon let it speed up.
They could both sense the shift in the doctor's mood and kept silent, waiting for him to say something first.
Irene sat down gracefully and crossed her legs. "I would have given up Kate for you, Sherlock, but it was all a game. Dear old Jim got it wrong. You're the Iceman, turning away my affections. Your brother, was just doing a job." The dominatrix turned a sneer on Mycroft. "Weren't you?"
“Hmm.” Sherlock had never felt so good, there was the usual bubble around him but it was calm and empty, there was nothing to concern him or anything for him to worry about, it was like seeing everything from the outside in.
The detective rolled his eyes as a man in an all-in-one strolled from the house. With a quick glance at John he tugged his hand free and slotted both into his pockets before turning to the angry looking man, glaring daggers at him.
Head low and cock throbbing, the government official crawled to where he was told and stopped beside the door.
Mycroft stopped licking his ice cream which he knew was driving the DI mad when he noticed Sherlock watching him. “Gregory, why is my brother staring at you?”
"God, now he's being petty." John reached for the gag again. "Well I know what I can do about that."
John had to test a theory. He began to pull his cock from Sherlock's mouth and the detective whined at the loss. "I'm sorry, sir," he whispered when he realised John must have been watching him.
He fell to the shower floor without a moments hesitation. He loved the feel of John's hands in his hair but he would much rather the roles were reversed.
Sherlock laughed, revenge was sweet. After all these months, he knew his sister would not kill him nor Mycroft. Irene on the other hand...
Greg screwed his eyes tightly shut. It was a unique yet familiar feeling. He quickly found his wrists cuffed behind him and he was pulled upright by the scruff of the neck. His arse clenched as the plug jerked into life.
He disliked her touch immensely, even more than the pain. There was nothing more he wanted than to pull away from her.
I was extremely close to letting Sherlock safeword here and ending the fic. So if you want him to safe word, STOP READING, because I don’t want to hear about it.
“John, there’s something I’ve been meaning to mention to you,” the DI stated before John could run off and join Sherlock.
“Well, she said she would keep a few things b,ack and when you were good you would be able to have them to experiment on.”
John smiled softly. "I thought Sherlock could decide what we have for dinner. It's take away night pet," John snapped his fingers and some menus were brought in by one of the maids. He dropped the menus on Sherlock's lap. "What do you think?"
John watched him for a moment. He had a bead of sweat running down his back and his curls were soaked. His arms were trembling and his legs looked like they were about to give out. He really had left it to the last minute.
The detective rested them loosely behind his head with a sigh as John began undoing the device around his cock.
“Stand up, pet,” John ordered softly, but made sure to add a hint of sternness in there to ensure compliance, not like he expected him to disobey, but that was one thing he had already learnt with Sherlock Holmes; expect the unexpected.
Sherlock liked being called his dad. That meant maybe the boy could forget about his ‘real’ parents and everything they had done to him.
“I suppose you thought, half an hour ago you were about to have the luckiest and most enjoyable evening your pathetic excuse for lives had seen since university. Must have been one hell of a fluke for Sherlock to pass by where you two psychos were. But then John turned up, an ex-army captain who still has a licence to kill. Oh, didn’t he tell you that? That would be because he protects the British Government’s little brother. And then I turn up, a bit shell shocked really but I’ll go along with anything me…”
This time, when the doctor held Sherlock before the fire, he rocked him gently. "I hadn't planned to play so soon, but maybe we can do something light tomorrow. I think we both need it."
In the kitchen, John had cooked breakfast with the help of his sub. Together, they had made enough for the four of them and were setting it out on the table.
"Yes, sir," Sherlock stared at his Dom's feet, feeling very disappointed in himself for letting his jealousy dictate his actions.
John thought that was the end of it, but Sherlock seemed to want to get the last worst in. He sniffed, “I also know you didn’t make it home last night.”
John smiled. “Good boy.” He really wanted to just lean over and kiss him, but the boy was looking so awkward and out of place as it was. John didn’t want to confuse the lad further.
Mycroft's eyes had gone wide. He knew they would both concentrate on him exclusively now. He was tempted to go ahead and beg for mercy.
The Dom ran his hand through Sherlock's sweaty curls as the younger man sobbed on his lap. He looked down his back and saw how red his arse was, he just couldn't allow himself to put soothing cream on it. Sherlock needed to remember this.
Sherlock turned his head into John’s side, whimpering quietly. He gave him a moment to settle and then moved to put the paddle away.  “As your brother has come out all this way to see you, I will cuddle with you in the front room and you will give him your upmost attention as dazed as that will be.”
The first blow came quick and hard across the widest part of his arse. Mycroft managed not to move, but only just. He didn't manage to keep back his yelp of surprise.
The idea of splitting it into 4 chunks crossed his mind, but he realised it wasn’t his fault it had gone up to mid-70’s. It was Sherlock’s own doing. He had been given chance after chance. If anything it should probably be higher given the amount of attitude the Dom had been on the receiving end of.
This time, John's sigh was heaved a lot heavier. “Probably. Greg?” He asked as he answered. “He's done what?!”
Johns head tilted on one side as he regarded his sub. That was not the answer he had been expecting. It was better. That must have shown some underlying trust beginning to build.
“There is every need if there is even a chance that one thing that has happened to you in the past can happen again in the future than I need to be able to avoid it. I want to- need to know about it.”
John's feet could barely touch the floor, only his toes found purchase from where his ankles were cuffed to the chair legs.
“So,” Mycroft paused a moment to sip his coffee, he nodded at the taste, but absolutely refused to compliment his little brother while he was in trouble, his ego didn’t need a boost. “What’s your schedule like for your next house plan then?”
John barked a laugh at that, much louder than he intended, and the sleeping detective woke with a start.
“Sherlock,” the older sub tried a different approach. “You moved in with me because I couldn’t trust you.”
Sighing, the doctor scooped his sub up off the floor with minimal protest and carried him from the entrance hall all the way to the den. He settled him on the plush sofa and then turned to ring the bell that was on the wall.
Slowly, Sherlock’s head began to lower and the Dom was mildly surprised. His sub was beginning to trust him and beginning to obey immediately rather than argue about it for half an hour and then obey.
The government official glanced at his Dom. Greg nodded at him and Mycroft took a deep breath. “My brother is still trying to be the perfect sub, foolish as that is.”
He got to his feet and opened the windows wide. It was pissing down with rain and he stood there watching, ignoring the rain that managed to reach him through the now open window. He looked out at the world of London below and sighed. All those people, walking around like they had a purpose. What were they doing? Going for lunch between some 9-5 boring job. What was the point? Besides getting wet.
A younger man that John knew as Mycroft’s Dom, Greg, appeared behind him with a placating hand on his shoulder. The tears or concern and anger coming from John were enough for Greg to persuade Mycroft to deal with the bloodied body in the corner rather than take it out on him. It wasn’t his fault.
His eyes met with the younger man’s and he saw the pain there. “You know as well as I do that you deserved that, but it’s over, okay? You’ve been punished and now it’s time for a cuddle.”
Blinking back away from the light, Sherlock steadied his eyes to the brightness around him, 2 large white lights pointing down at him. When he could finally focus, he could see the camera aimed at his kneeling figure.
"I am, as you quite often put it 'the British Government'. I know things you will never know. That no one will ever know."
Greg grasped his sub by the jaw and tilted his head up so he could look him in the eyes. "You're just as naughty as your brother in your own way."
With clear reluctance, Sherlock forced himself up and over the Dom's lap, with some difficulty given how he was cuffed.
Sherlock laughed. He couldn't stop laughing in fact. He glanced at his brother and smiled. For the first time ever, this weekend could be fun.
The DI looked around and then backed through the corridor, beckoning the doctor follow him into a more private area.
Greg cleared his throat. “Breakfast was excellent. Thank you both for cooking.” He searched for something to say to defuse the situation, but came up blank. He caught Mycroft’s eye, hoping he would come up with something.
He could see her now, in his mind’s eye, back straight, gun in her hand. Was she aiming? Or was she waiting for him to make the next move?
Sherlock nodded and John moved his head to claim his lips in a bruising kiss. ‘I love you,’ he whispered whenever they part to catch their breaths and Sherlock could feel the words reverberate in the movements of John’s hands on his skin. ‘I love you so fucking much, Sherlock… Christ, I don’t deserve you.’
‘You are friends. People invite their friends over for the dinner, don’t they? And I don’t mind. He is… intriguing.’
‘Him,’ James retorted with a grin. ‘On your wedding. The entire speech. It was… painful to watch to be completely honest. You really didn’t…’
‘I don’t mind.’ The words were rushed but he meant them. He had told John he would leave if they wanted him to and that hadn’t changed.
And Sherlock knew John. He knew John would have stayed if Sholto had let him closer. He was like that, unwilling to give up. Ready to fight. Always the soldier.
Sherlock blinked his eyes open, hands already moving to his shirt to undo the buttons. James merely smiled and raised an eyebrow. ‘You dealing out the orders now, Watson?’
Sherlock could taste the wine on John’s lips and it drew him in. Their chests were pressed together now, their kiss deepened and a shudder through John’s body, made Sherlock pull back.
John stayed still for a moment, phone still clutched in his hand. He couldn’t believe how fast things had gotten out of hand. What started as a visit from Greg in the morning – only this morning! No more than ten hours ago dammit – had turned in one of the worst days John could recall to memory. They had realised too late how bad things could get, hadn’t realised it was all a distraction, hadn’t realised who the real target was. They had fitted the clues together too late. They had been distracted, still riding their high from Sherlock’s miraculous solving of the ‘Alley Murders’ – Jesus, they were joking about the name for the blog entry when the call came. Too bloody late!
During those years there was no time to think of birthdays. Or Christmases. Or any other day to be honest. Sherlock was often reminded of the days he spent in search of cocaine - the days and months and years all blended together until he found his head being lifted by his brother, announcing to him he could go home.
Neither man questioned if John was sure. They didn’t have to; John’s tone made it very clear that he would take matters into his own hands if they didn’t give him what he wanted. John was stubborn like that and they both knew it.
John starts laughing again and Sherlock now really starts to get concerned. ‘Come out, Sherlock. As in, they haven’t come out for their sexual preference. And I don’t mean straight.’
Sherlock’s hands found John’s belt and it is enough to pull James attention away from the marred skin.
Sherlock pressed down, hard, and suddenly he felt John shift underneath him. ‘Stay still, John, please…you can’t die. I won’t let you, you hear it? I won’t let you!’
When Sherlock closed the door of the bedroom behind them, nobody moved for a moment. John and James were staring at each other, neither of them sure. Sherlock remembered what it had felt like, that first time he and John had slept together. For years he had dreamt of that moment and when it had arrived, he hadn’t known what to do.
Oh buggering fuck! ‘Right…yeah…goddammit.’ John rubbed his face. Damn this day to hell and back. ‘Look, I’ll head to the den I found him during the Magnussen business. Maybe I’ll get lucky.’ Yeah right.
‘No, don’t you dare,’ Sherlock gritted out and finally – finally – he looked up to meet John’s eyes.
Sherlock and James looked at each other over John’s head, both of them smiling fondly. Yes, for John Watson, they would try.
Sherlock tried to step back a little, but John’s hand immediately reached back and grabbed Sherlock’s hips, grinding them together again and James had stopped.
John pulled his arms tighter around Sherlock, swallowing away his own tears. ‘It’s okay, Sherlock,’ he whispered. ‘Please, it’s okay. It wasn’t you, believe me, please. It wasn’t you.’ He didn’t know if Sherlock could hear him, but he kept repeating the words anyway. It hadn’t been his fault. There had been only one man who held the gun and he would be locked away for the rest of his life. And John would do everything in his might to make Sherlock believe him. But for now, he held and rocked him, as the younger man grieved for the death of his brother.
John was leaning into the touch but he made no move to return the gesture. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to – Sherlock could see it; John did want to – but he was waiting. But why?
By the time John comes back out of the bathroom, wet flannel in hand to clean them up, Sherlock’s eyes are closed and already feels himself drifting off to sleep. Not quite yet though.
Sherlock didn’t respond and John stayed still for a moment. The need to get closer to the man on his bed was itching in his bones. He needed to see for himself what Sherlock had done, he had to try and help. But before he could ask, Sherlock moved again. Slowly, like his body weighed a ton, he scooted over to the other side of the bed and turned on the bedside lamp.
John’s sudden command startled Sherlock, but before he could ask, John explained. ‘She doesn’t… She is not a part of this. Not anymore. Please, Sherlock. Just… just the two of us, okay?’
They moved; James led them, placing his hand on John’s upper arm, while John quietly told him which door to take to the downstairs bedroom. Sherlock followed them, his hand wrapped around John’s. John squeezed his fingers but whether it was to reassure himself or Sherlock, he couldn’t tell.
Sherlock allowed himself to take a deep breath, ignoring the sharp pain in his own chest. He was healing still – his own heart had threatened to give out once he was loaded up in the ambulance and the surgery to repair the damage he had done to himself had been taxing. But he didn’t care. Not now.
Sherlock moved a little closer to John, gently letting his fingers slide over John’s balls to his perineum. John groaned, but he muffled the noise against James’ shoulder. ‘Don’t John,’ James whispered and Sherlock started to press the tip of his finger against John’s hole. ‘We want to hear you. Don’t we, Sherlock?’
‘I called it off, got shot two days later and I didn’t see him again. I tried to contact him when I was back in London and again when I heard about what had happened to him but, he never responded. I sent him another email when you had left and we met up once after that but it wasn’t… He wasn’t the same.’
Still nothing. Although… Sherlock can hear it now, the ragged quality of John’s breath, deep, controlled. Sherlock finds himself trying to match it before nodding.
‘Nothing. Was kinda hoping you would tell us some better news.’ John could hear murmuring on the background and Greg shutting them up with an angry growl. ‘Sorry ‘bout that. Thing are crazy here. But what do you mean ‘tore the place up?’’
Oh. That was not - Sherlock blinks, his vision still dark, but he can see John’s face so clearly. He can imagine the tentative smile, the warmth and uncertainty in those blue eyes. For even a moment, Sherlock can picture John’s hands and fingers perfectly. To have them, against his skin…
“I’ll manage, John.” He does, eventually, after nearly crashing to the floor because he sat down too close to the edge. John doesn’t comment on it.
‘So that’s where you’ve run off to.’ Maggie’s face was weary as she leaned on James. ‘Come on, we need to find our seats.’ Both their pinched frowns slid into chubby smiles, like little cherubs. It was amazing how quickly they changed moods, if not a little terrifying. John wondered if Sherlock ever thought they reminded him of Eurus, but never asked. It would perhaps not have been the most tactful of questions, especially seeing as they’d long ago refused to let her see any of their offspring, for fear of what she would do.
'Never say those words to me again please.' Laughing, John held out his hand to her, and helped her from the stool,
Her arm firmly clasped in Rosie’s, she seemed to float across the floor. In her black hair was the other half of the crown, John supposed it was cute that they shared one. Having reached the front, she caught his eye, and the smile she gave him was so full of joy, warmth brimming in her dark eyes that he felt rather uncomfortable at having outwardly spoken so much against the wedding. Luckily, her gaze fell to her future wife, and the moment was over. Holding hands, the two women turned to face the Minister, and a hush descended over the room.
‘Surely you think this is ridiculous too. I mean, she’s barely graduated for goodness’ sake.’ With eyes that were so like Mary’s, Rosie gave him a look. ‘I let my daughter make her own decisions. Just like my fathers let me do by the way.’ Grunting in frustration he said,
'Mhm, mhm, mhmmm. Goodbye.'  Swiftly hanging up, Mycroft turned to the bleary eyed Rosie, who'd shot up at the sound of the phone.
'I just...that's-' He didn't have time for this. Yanking open the door, John braced himself against the cold air, and set about finding Karleen.
'I think everything about you is charming, but unfortunately not everyone is attracted to assholes like me.' Grinning, Sherlock responded,
'You'll see soon enough.' Groaning, John pushed himself to his feet, feeling his joints cracking as he stood up.
‘Are you still concerned about this?’ John narrowed his eyes at the altar, ‘Can you do a final check up? Make sure she’s sincere.’ Giving his husband the amused look that meant he was being irrational, Sherlock said, ‘Already did, while you were talking to Rosie and James. She’s absolutely sincere, or as sincere as a girl of eighteen can be before she’s going to get married.’
'John, John where are you? I need you.' Hastily closing the photo album, John Watson ducked around the corner of the door to find his husband searching around the room, a frown dragging the corners of his mouth down. 'I'm here.' His head snapped up instantly, and taking him in, Sherlock released a rare smile. Then it slipped away as he held out his tie, huffing like he didn't care about his inability to handle the thing,
‘Big push for the shoulders hon,’ Karleen’s grip started to slacken. Alarmed, John tightened his but she shook her head, panting.
‘SEE.’ Rosie turned to James, who went to hug Sherlock, and then slipped away in search of his wife. Sighing at his retreating figure, Rosie turned to them, ‘I suppose I had better go and help Miranda. It’s almost time. Poor girl must be terrified.’ She smiled at them one last time, before walking away, ‘Nice tie by the way.’
'Excellent choice. I can see my tutelage is improving your tastes greatly. Let me just get my work so that I can finish doing it here. It will provide you the best view for drawing.' Rosie nodded as he got up, and carefully selected her first colour. It was bright green. Perhaps they still had work to do in terms of taste. Mycroft sat down again, and beginning with a huge circle, Rosie asked, 'Important?', carefully pronouncing the 'por' like she'd learned last week. His fountain pen stilled over the report, asking whether or not they should increase the amount of troops they were sending abroad. Rosie was used to being passed from friend to friend when her fathers had 'work', and were off chasing criminals around the country. Ever since she was one, the very word had been sacred, not to be disturbed, always respected. Not that he was sentimental in any sense, but according to the parenting books he'd read, a child needed to know it was the priority of its caretaker. Now, John and Sherlock never neglected her, but Rosie was sharp, and sometimes Mycroft saw her piercing gaze pick up the excitement they had in their work, and the joy they put into it. He'd seen her deflate a little whenever someone new called, as it meant she needed to be babysat for safety. The parental books had said that even a child of three can feel left out, and as an Uncle, it was his duty to stick to the knowledge of experts, they knew what they were doing after all. Placing down the pen, he put the hand on her head instead, mussing up her hair. 'Not as important as you Rosamund.' The smile that split apart her face warmed his insides. Not because he was getting emotional, of course not. It simply meant that the books were right, and he did so love putting theory into practice. Clearing his throat, lest she get the idea that he was almost as emotional as a- he couldn't even think it...normal person- the very word sent a shudder through his spine- he cleared his throat, and started to write again. 'Make it your best work, we never do anything by halves.'
‘Crowning, you’re doing so well.’ Sherlock met John’s eyes, hope and anticipation tied their gazes together, shimmering brightly above them as the promise of new life drew nearer.
Watching them go, Sherlock turned his head to John’s, ‘Thank goodness ours aren’t that young anymore. I quite like sleeping through the night.’ Shaking his head, John said,
'I found it.' It was a USB shaped like a gun. He really needed to stop buying Sherlock murder related gifts for his birthdays, it was getting out of hand.
'Um,' he began tentatively, his fingers threading around his cup of tea, 'I think she just went out for a walk,'
Sherlock was sitting on a chair. His fingers threaded together as he stared blankly at the water ebbing gently to and fro. So lost in thought was he, that he didn’t stir when John sat down next to him, only opened his mouth, ‘I probably should have known you would find me.’ John glanced at the ripples in the pool, ‘It’s where it all began, isn’t it?’ Sherlock let out a huff of air,
'You think it's charming.' John had to hide a smirk as he leaned forward, conveniently dumping the tie behind Sherlock as he did so, out of sight.
‘Having you guys as parents is the actual worst. You know all my other friends were able to sneak people in and drink all the time?’
‘He said it was important for my development to rebel against my parents. He was worried that I would never become a well-rounded person without it.’ John had to hide his smile a bit at Sherlock’s enraged expression. Mycroft had, if possible, read even more parenting books than Sherlock had. It irritated his husband to no end, how much Mycroft was involved in her upbringing. ‘Don’t worry, I’ll talk to him.’ Rosie stuck her hand on her hip,
‘Sherlock?’ He blinked, and seemed to come back down to earth. ‘What’s the problem?’ he asked softly, moving his thumb over his knee, showing him that he was here. When Sherlock spoke, it was so softly that John almost missed it.
'That is a very childish way of securing a promise, the particulars of the finger does not change the likelihood of someone following through on the promise.'
‘For someone so intelligent and keen on works of literature, your lexical choices are very questionable.’ She repeated his words back to him in a pinched tone, to which he turned red and retorted something, and she shot back. Their voices started to rise as John massaged his temples, ‘Can you both shut up. Wedding and all that.’ Both of his children fell silent, gazing about them with a hint of embarrassment. ‘And Rosie, to be honest i don’t really want to know what you managed to get up to, despite Sherlock, and Mycroft for that matter.’ Inspecting her nails cooly, Rosie said nonchalantly, ‘No, Mycroft knew.’
'Giving birth is a very complex natural procedure. These things take a lot of time. It's best not to worry too much about it. Now, I think it's time for bed.' Rosie shook her head, her body wriggling so furiously she almost fell off the couch, Mycroft lunged forward to catch her, but there was no need. She'd recovered. Suppressing the hint of pride at how developed her motoring skills were, he adopted his strict voice, 'Yes Rosamund. It is vital that you get enough sleep, how else will your brain develop to its full potential?' She gazed up at him reproachfully, but a large yawn interrupted the cutting effect, 'See, you're tired. We must listen to our bodies.' He scooped her up in one movement, but still she shook her head. Grabbing his face between her two chubby hands, she implored him, 'Please? I want to be there for new baby.' Mycroft tried to stay strong, only a fool would succumb to the pleading of a child, but alas, she was simply too good at getting her way. When she was older she would be a force to be reckoned with, perfect at the job he was doing right now. No enemy would stand a chance. 'When news comes of the baby, I will wake you up and drive you there myself, ok? But only if you go to sleep now.'
'Oh, you found me.' Leroy thrust the packet of biscuits at her, and she had to bite her lip to stop a smile from escaping. John took the barstool next to her, goodness knows how she'd managed to wedge herself onto one in her condition, and asked gently,
Slipping into the hallway, John’s eyes scanned the tangerine signs that directed the way towards the different wards. There were at least a dozen, how was he supposed to find him in under half an hour? But then one in particular caught his eye, and smiling to himself, he stuck his hands in his pockets and followed it.
'Thank goodness we're never having kids. Can you imagine him as a father?' They both looked at him again, and seeing them watching he stopped his dancing to the song he'd been humming, and waved at them nervously. John surpassed a grin.
‘You are being way too calm about this.’ A smirk bloomed on John’s smug face, and he leaned in teasingly, ‘Well, for once I’m being the rational one, I’m quite enjoying it Sherl,’
'Unbelievable.' John threw his arms into the air, eyes darting towards the clock, where was Sherlock when you needed him.
The smile that had been drawn onto his face by Sherlock stayed there, and when they were pronounced wife and wife, and Amy drew Miranda close as they kissed; John clapped his hands with the rest of the room, and started to cry.
Karleen’s veins were prominent. Incredibly, incredibly prominent on her forehead. So prominent that Sherlock had taken the time to ask if this was normal, to which both the doctor and Karleen had responded with a steely glare, and John had hastily stepped in to pull him out of harm’s way.
The summoned taxi appeared almost instantly, and the three of them piled in as it sped towards the hospital.
‘Alright then.’ They shared a grin for a brief second, before the music began, and they turned to look at the doors.
‘What’s this about? Nerves? Because that’s completely normal, I was absolutely terrified when Rosie was born, I was sure I was going to cock everything up-still am to be honest-’
'Come on, let's go put on the kettle. We can watch movies until you're dilated enough.' Karleen blinked at him,
Turning over the envelope of the invitation in his hand, John absentmindedly tapped his fingers on the table as Sherlock ran around the room-as much as a man pushing eighty-six could run around the room- trying to find their wedding gift. He'd insisted on buying it and John, who was tired enough these days as it was, didn't have the strength to argue with him. Miranda loved him anyway, she wouldn't really mind whatever he gave her. The envelope was embossed with golden roses, twining themselves around the corner of the paper, looking strangely akin to nooses if he was being honest, 'Don't you think they're rushing into this?' Sherlock's head snapped up from where he was rooting among the couch,
'Where is Karleen?' Karleen's unfortunate boyfriend shrugged his shoulders nervously at John's outburst.
'I suppose,' she sighed, her head in her hands. '...I suppose.' Placing his hand on hers, John shook it supportively,
‘But I’ve got something amazing to ask him about. I’ve been reading this really interesting theory about-’ she quieted as her eyes tracked something in the crowd. John followed her line of vision, but couldn’t see anything. He blinked in annoyance, his eyesight was going, just last week when Sherlock had passed him another one of his self-made crosswords (the ones in the newspaper were ‘laughably easy’ apparently), he’d needed to hold it an arm’s length away, and even then he was squinting. Sherlock had wanted to take him to get glasses immediately, but for some reason John had shrugged it off. He didn’t want glasses, he didn’t need people looking at him like he was elderly, someone that could barely get out of his seat. And now his granddaughter was getting married...his oldest grandchild at that, but still.
Threading a hand through his curly hair, John kissed him. Sherlock’s eyes fell shut as he leaned in closer, pressing their foreheads together. ‘I love you.’ His eyes creased with a smile,
'Nothing.' Tracking her eye movement, John understood. Turning to Leroy, he cleared his throat and took out his wallet,
'It's not my emotions. It's common, logical sense. She is only a child, how can she know what she wants?'
‘I mean, what if the baby turns out like Eurus?’ Wait. What? His eyes flying open, John’s hand dropped from his knee in shock. Sherlock’s jaw was working furiously in order to counteract the tears that were starting to form in his eyes. Sherlock...crying? That was something that barely happened, John had seen him cry maybe three times in his life. Meeting his eyes, Sherlock swallowed, his fingers shaking. Shit, in his shock he’d forgotten to speak. What an idiot. Finding his voice, John said,
‘It is what it is.’ John nudged him at the reference, and Sherlock’s face creased in memory, fondness overflowing his features until John almost felt the need to look away, it was too much. Too much love, too much happiness. He didn’t deserve it. But Sherlock did. Sherlock deserved every inch of happiness that he could scrounge for him. And so help him, he would spend the rest of his life scrounging for those inches until they could be fit together to create the happiest life he could ever live.
‘What if the baby turns out like Eurus?’ Relief melted all the tension from the previous moments away, like honey it seeped through his veins, loosening everything, warming his petrified heart. With a jerk, it remembered to start beating again, and thudded heavily against his chest, happiness growing brighter with every thump.
‘Understandable.’ John laughed delightedly, threading his hand through Sherlock’s arm, tugging him along as if they were two teens who had just fallen in love, and not two married men with two years of a marriage under their belts.
'Exactly, I'm about to be a father for the second time, I need to focus all my energy on that.' Opening his mouth, Leroy searched for a retort, but could find none. Exhaling harshly, he snapped his mouth shut and moodily swiped the wallet. 'Alright, alright.' Muttering something, Leroy trudged his way to the winding line, hands in his pockets. Karleen watched him go, not without amusement. Swivelling in his chair, John moved to face her again,
'Promise,' she insisted, it still waving in the air. With a sigh, Mycroft threaded his around hers, and shook it once. Honestly, the levels to which he stooped in order to make sure the girl had a proper upbringing...
‘Breathe near me again Leroy, and I’m breaking up with you.’ It was safe to say that Karleen was not feeling particularly charitable towards her significant other at the moment. They were all jammed into the back of the cab, Leroy trying to stifle his breathing as Karleen spread her legs wide and gripped onto John’s arms so tightly he could feel the bruises flowering. ‘Are we near the hospital?’ he anxiously called to the cab driver, desperately wanting to get out of the car before she reached bone. The cab driver responded by turning the corner, and the dingy facade of the hospital came into view. John had never been so relieved to see it before.
‘But it really is. You always tried so hard to let Rosie and James pave their own way in life, and now you’re being hypocritical.’
'Let us try again with a more sophisticated subject. You can draw anything in this room.' Rosie's grey eyes passed over the room carefully, scrutinising every object, before her head snapped up excitedly. 'Draw you!' Mycroft sat up a little straighter,
‘John you don’t understand, Moriarty was not as clever as Eurus and he still lived a miserable life.’ Sobering, John drew his other hand into his as well,
‘Good girl, getting closer.’ Clenching her jaw, John’s hand starting to turn purple under hers, she pushed again.
‘How’s Maggie?’ James’s face turned softer, in the smile John had only ever seen associated with her name. ‘She’s coming, the twins are being annoying.’ Rosie shouldered him, to which rolling his eyes, he ducked away from, ‘How are the little buggers? Have you thought of a name for the new one yet?’
'Rosie's not the one getting married,' Sherlock was quiet for a moment. Then he lifted his head of curls,
'Don't worry John, I doubt anyone there is even remotely interested in seeing you naked.' John stopped dead in his tracks,
'I think you're looking at this the wrong way.' Dipping a stub of chip into the ketchup that was blotting the newspaper, she asked,
'Absolutely not. Listen to me Rosamund, you are above this. You are not the barbaric, murder obsessed idiot your father is.' Firmly turning the page in her colouring book, he then said,
'Yes.' They were silent for a moment, remembering. John's eyes darkened as he thought of how he himself had doubted him, and he dark years that followed his 'death'. If he had to go through something like that again, a shudder passed through him. They were old now, getting older every day. One of them would soon be gone, and have to deal with it all over again. A strange sense of resolution washed through him however: if Sherlock went first, he wouldn't be far behind. He'd lived long enough, and he didn't want to spend the last years of his life in a world that had had the light taken out of it. What was the point. Besides, he had to make sure Sherlock wouldn't meet some random hottie in whatever came next and decide to ditch him. 'But they come back,' John was shaken out of his reverie by Sherlock's earnest gaze. A rueful smile dotted his face, 'Yes, the good ones do.' Sherlock's eyes darted to the floor, unable to deal with everything he saw in John's eyes, but he was there. They both were. Sighing, John looked again at the envelope, the roses seemed significantly more rose-like now. 'I guess if they're happy...'
'Ah, it's your emotions again.' Gesturing so wildly that the mug of tea spilled onto the desk, John cried, a little louder than intended,
‘Then her heart is shattered. And I’ll be there, picking up the pieces. I can’t delegate her life Dad.’ Muttering, he took a sip from his glass,
'It's impossible.' Rolling his eyes, John stepped forward and took up the offered piece of clothing. His eyes widened,
'Well I won't argue with you there.' Sherlock quietened, reaching to brush an errant stray hair from John's forehead. His hand rested for a moment, where it lay against his temple and closing his eyes, John leaned into the touch. It had been thirty-eight years since they'd said their vows, and John still felt himself stealing touches like a teenager, wanting to sink into every moment Sherlock was near him. He'd never thought he could have loved like this, not after Mary, whom he barely cared about compared to this. How wrong he'd been, how blind he had been. But that was all in the past, Sherlock and him had had a lifetime together, and if they were lucky could have a lifetime more.
'I never really minded before. But now, with the whole pregnancy thing...he's been so useless John. And it made me think, what if something big like this happens again? he won't be able to handle it at all. I don't want to constantly be doing everything by myself.' Pressing his lips together, John contemplated the situation. It really wasn't any of his business. Was Karleen too good for Leroy? Definitely. No question there. It was obvious from the first moment they walked through the door and Leroy had said, 'Not that I have any problem with it, it's alright with me. But...does this mean you'll need to have sex with the curly haired one?'. But then again, he was always very nice to her, and to be honest he didn't want to influence any of her decisions, especially not when she was in labour. 'Well...there's always an idiot in the relationship, no? I'm Sherlock's idiot. He's quite ok with that, at least I think he is.' Grinning, Karleen offered him a chip, John accepted. 'Yeah, but you're like mediocre idiot. Still smart enough to be of use, you know?'
‘This was a mistake.’ Cold, blind fear shocked through John, filling all his limbs until they were stiff, he was sitting there in his seat, frozen. Sherlock was having second thoughts. Sherlock didn’t want to be with him anymore. Sherlock was feeling trapped. Sherlock didn’t love him. Sherlock wanted a divorce. Sherlock wanted to be rid of all of this. Sherlock...No. Steeling himself, he asked as calmly as he could-although the voice crack betrayed him-,
‘It’s a boy.’ The doctor moved to hand him to Karleen, but she shook her head avidly, holding Leroy’s arm that was around her shoulders.
She’d been wheeled into the room, and the doctor had told them it was a matter of half an hour before she would be dilated enough for the birth. For the time being, she was being poured a glass of water from the bottles that had stood waiting for her, with Leroy dabbing at her forehead with a cloth as she tried to swat him away. The doctor had left for the time being, before John could ask her where Sherlock was. It was strange, he’d left early to ‘check that everything was right in the room’. He definitely should have been here, and from the amount of birthing videos and books he’d consumed, John was certain that this was not a moment Sherlock wanted to miss. Casting a quick glance at the happy couple, whose members were either tucking sheets around their partner and kicking them off again as soon as they were in place. Taking an executive decision, John decided they could be left alone for now. The doctor had said half an hour, so that was how long he had to find Sherlock.
‘Was it in the army that they taught you how to read people? It’s very impressive John.’ He scowled at the sarcasm in his tone, ‘Maybe I’ll ask Mycroft, he is the smarter brother after all.’
Sherlock sighed heavily, clenching his jaw, ‘Why did we choose for me to be the biological parent?’ Closing his eyes tightly, John tried to breathe calmly, in through his nose, out through his mouth, in through his nose, out through his mouth, in through his nose, out through his-
Shaking his head, he made a mental note to ask Sherlock to display it on the fridge, and when a new one must take its place, to give it to him. It was important, if she wanted the option of being an artist, that he preserve all of her work. Luckily, he’d ordered a filing cabinet for that specific purpose. He supposed he’d better order one for the new child as well, seeing as with his DNA, it would most definitely be as much of a genius as Rosamund. With these important thoughts swirling around in his mind, Mycroft brushed the lint off his trousers, and readied himself to meet the new baby. If it were half as brilliant as Rosamund had turned out to be, he would have himself two very worthy successors.
‘So that we always remember our promise. We never let him become as lonely as they were.’ Reaching into his pocket, Sherlock drew out a stuffed, furry red dog. Redbeard.
‘Try and exist as little as possible’, rushed forward, taking both of their places. Stretching out his mangled hand, John couldn’t say that he was particularly sorry for the switch in positions.
'Shut up,' John growled, but it only fuelled his husband's glee. Sherlock's head dropped as he went back to searching,
Satisfied, Rosie plopped her head down on his shoulder, and allowed him to carry her to the cot he'd had installed in his office, in case of emergency babysitting events like these. Curling up under her blankets, she fell asleep almost immediately. The immediacy of it caused a hint of a smile to grace Mycroft's face, before someone knocked on his door and it vanished.
‘He’s their child.’ She pointed to Sherlock and John. John eagerly reached out his arms to receive him, but Sherlock hesitated for a moment. As the bundle was passed to him, John allowed himself a few moments to greet his son, take in the wispy hair, the pinched face and when he opened them: the most luminous, beautiful eyes. He was here. After all of those months of waiting, he was here. Tears blurred his vision unexpectedly, as he struggled against the emotion in his chest. He was here. He couldn’t stop thinking it. He was here. The baby was actually here. Turning to Sherlock in delight, he saw the apprehension, and remembered what he had been about to do, before the baby had overtaken all reason and rationale. Sniffing once, he held the baby close to Sherlock. ‘James.’ Sherlock met his eyes,
'You have a trial period right now, Leroy's not becoming a father. Which means that you have time for him to grow and learn how to be useful in big situations.' She shook her head,
‘Strange isn’t it, how something so mundane can be changed forever, simply by the memories we attach to it.’
Sherlock didn’t reply- which was a little strange, as usually he immediately texted back, but now was not the moment to start worrying about petty things like whether or not his husband was having second thoughts about their entire marriage. Shaking the stupid, neurotic idea from his mind, John held out a hand to Karleen, who, ignoring it, pulled herself up by the door, and managed to totter out into the street, groaning all the while.
The man spoke of love through the ages, and undying loyalty, in sickness and in health. Both women repeated the vows, each with a little smile to the other. But inside John there was still turmoil. Of course they were in love, of course they thought they would be together forever, but breaking up a marriage hurt so much more than breaking up a relationship. They were so young...what if they found someone else along the way? What if things just simply couldn’t work out between them and they’d already bought a house together? What if they should have kids, and then have to divorce at only 25 because they fell out of love again? Poor Miranda would be heartbroken, and it would all be stupid Amy’s fault. He sat there and pitied, worried, seethed, she should not be getting married. Someone needed to stop this, she’d barely become an adult, she still had uni to go to and they were going to different ones. It was ridiculous, an impossible notion, and this was it. If no one else would step up to the plate, he would. Let them try out long distance first, see how it worked before such a commitment was taken, it was only wise. And if he were the only person in the world that would do this for her sake then he would, he would be her grandfather and do his job. The words were bubbling on his lips, just ready to spring out when Miranda said 'I do.' and Sherlock took his hand. Everything that had been building up inside of him dissipated, scattered like a house of cards as Sherlock’s head touched his shoulder. Blinking back tears, John squeezed his hand tightly, remembering how thirty-eight years ago it had been them standing at the altar, how long ago it seemed, how young they were. Weddings meant love, and he supposed all they were was a celebration of the love that bound them, just as it bound Miranda and Amy. Leaning his head against his grey hair, John closed his eyes for a moment, revelling in how lucky he was, and had been, that all those years ago he’d been in need of a flatmate, and that Stamford had had the good sense to direct him to Sherlock. His friend, his ally, his husband.
The hand lifted, and Sherlock turned around again, hands on his hips as his eyes scanned the rest of the room, 'How about the one with the gravestones?'
The text message lit up his phone, and Mycroft smiled. Rosie, having woken up from the turn of taking an exit, noticed the change in his demeanour and asked,
‘You don’t do that anyway darling, you spend half the nights roaming around, trying to solve old cases.’ With a wry smile Sherlock leaned back,
‘Mycroft knew what?’ A hand rested on John’s shoulder, and the discomfort of the search flew out of his body. His spirits immediately lifted, John turned to him, ‘Apparently Rosie was engaging in regular criminal activity without us knowing, with Mycroft’s approval.’ Frowning, Sherlock said, ‘Why would Mycroft let you do that?’ Rosie smirked,
Leroy withstood her iron-grip without flinching, brushed the frizz from her forehead back. Meeting his eyes, she nodded firmly, and Leroy leaned down to whisper something. It was by completely chance that John even heard it at all,
‘That’s what I said. But she wouldn’t listen,’ Angus complained, his eyes accusing. Shrinking into Sherlock, Helena whispered, ‘Angus is being mean again.’
'I didn't want to disturb her, she's been quite angry lately.' John cut him a look, and he fell silent.
'Right.' He threw on his coat, and turned back to the man cowering in the chair at their table. 'Well then I guess we had better find her, hadn't we?' Leroy nodded furiously, scrambling to his feet. 'Of course...I think she went to the chip shop. She likes chips,' he finished lamely,  John raised an eyebrow at him, thankful that the baby would have none of his DNA. I mean, who lets their girlfriend who's IN LABOUR go on a walk by herself? What if something happened? Then stupid Leroy would be nowhere to be found. Stupid Leroy. A smirk tugged the corners of his mouth as he wrenched open the door and ran down the stairs, bashing Leroy was good fun, he had to admit. It really helped take the edge off of stressful situations. Leroy trailed behind him, then stopped dead in his tracks. 'WAIT.' Sighing heavily, John acquiesced, watching him bolt up the stairs, and come down again with a packet of biscuits. He had to take a deep breath for this one, in order to not throttle the boy where he stood. 'You stopped for FUCKING BISCUITS?' Leroy held out the sleeve,
‘Afterwards, think about all the steak we’re going to eat.’ Her lips formed a weary smile, and sitting up straighter, she braced herself.
‘I’m trying,’ the poor boy protested, fumbling desperately with the keys, his hands shaking so much as to render them completely useless. ‘Oh, for the love of-’ Karleen was sitting in the backseat, both hands on her heaving stomach, breathing puffs of air in and out as she gritted her teeth against another contraction. John was half paying attention to her and half trying to figure out what Leroy’s problem seemed to be in getting the car to start. ‘Leroy, do we need to call a cab or not?’ he asked, taking a decidedly calmer tone than Karleen had a few moments ago. ‘I don’t know!’ Leroy threw his hands in the air, clinking the keys in his palms,
'Would you have married me at eighteen?' Sniffing, John turned to clean up the tea that was seeping through their hardwood table, Sherlock didn't seem to care. 'John, answer the question. When you avoid you make it obvious that I've won the argument.'
‘Begging your pardon sir, but we are around five minutes away.’ Mycroft nodded, and folded the drawing with the utmost care. She really was a very talented artist, usually he couldn’t stand the scribbles of children, but hers had a most interesting quality. He supposed she was naturally gifted in that area, as she was in most others in his opinion. He had failed to see how it was possible to gaze upon her work with the lack of enthusiasm his coworkers had shown. I mean really, as if he were Jennifer, who showed them new pictures of her brats every week, and no one had the decency to tell her her children were ugly and that pictures of them should probably not be allowed.
'I don't know, it's just,' he looked at the envelope again, the roses somehow brighter than before, 'She's only eighteen. That's not a marriageable age.' Sherlock rolled his eyes,
‘I’m not!’ Shrieked the little boy, ‘You’re just scared of everything.’ Her bottom lip wobbling, Helena stuck her tongue out at him. ‘I’m going to be very happy with the new baby. This one will be nice, and won’t smell.’ Angus wriggled so violently on John’s lap that he had to grab on to him to stop him from sliding off. ‘I don’t smell. Right Grandpa? I don’t smell.’
‘Oh, stop being so bloody righteous,’ John grumbled, crossing his arms and ignoring the shake of his husband’s laughter next to him. ‘Grandpa!’ Helena scrambled onto John’s lap, throwing her arms around his neck, Angus tottering not far behind her. His face melted a little as he squeezed her arms, ‘Hello poppet.’ Turning her pointed face to Sherlock, she informed him, ‘Mummy’s getting ready to pop. She said if the baby doesn’t come out soon she’ll explode.’ Angus had reached them by now and was clamouring to be held as well. Sherlock held out his arms for Helena, who was still talking to him, so that Angus could take her seat. ‘That’s impossible right? She won’t explode?’ Sherlock shook his head ardently,
'Don't sugarcoat it. He is.' A startled laugh escaped him and laughing as well, she looked a little embarrassed,
Throwing her head back, Rosie laughed and ran to meet the man that was speeding towards them. The man threw his arms around her and hugged her tightly, his fingers splayed out across her back, and recognition rushed through John. A smile creased his weathered face as he held out his own arms. James turned from Rosie to him, holding him just as tightly, if not more, causing both of their bones to crack. ‘Ow, do you mind? Respect your elders.’ Rolling his eyes, James adjusted his tie. The simple gesture touched John, melting his heart. James lived very far away, he didn’t visit nearly as often as he should. He was too busy with his children and erudite wife, helping her with her research. They’d had three, something John would never have expected from the shy boy that had quaked in his boots everytime Rosie brought her friends over, and pushed everyone who could possibly get close to him away. Ironically, Rosie, who was as extroverted as they come, pulling everyone into her orbit, urging everyone to be her friend, was not married, and had only one child with a one-night stand.
When Sherlock grew heavy in his arm and his broken sobs subsided, John lifted him up and helped him into the bed.
It wasn’t fair. That he had to die to see the love in those pale eyes. It was too late and they had been so stupid and God it hurt so much! ‘You’re not saying goodbye.’ Sherlock’s eyes were begging him to keep fighting, to hold on, but John could feel the cold settle into his bones.
Sherlock paused outside the door when he heard John and Lestrade talking on the other side. They had been ready to go home after some gruelling paperwork when John had disappeared from his sight. Sherlock frowned, wondering what it was the two men were talking about. What on Earth was John not ready for?
‘If you want. If he wants. Whatever you need.’ Sherlock had to press down the heat spreading to his cock at the thought of John and James together like that. Not now, this was not for him, Sherlock though firmly to himself. This was for John.
Sherlock followed the movement diligently. James was a handsome man, scars and all. He had thought so upon first meeting him. Strong, sturdy, a presence to be reckoned with despite his discomfort with crowds – he reminded him of John in many ways.
Luckily, James already seemed to wake up on his own. His face scrunched and he stretched his legs before opening his eyes.
Sherlock shuffled closer to James, still on his knees, and when James firmly grabbed his cock, he gasped in surprise. John was moving on his own now, his muscles flexing and trembling with the strain. James was moving in hand in time with John’s movements and – oh God! Sherlock could already feel his orgasm building in the base of his spine.
‘Touch yourself, Sherlock,’ James removed his hand. Sherlock nearly buckled with the sudden lack of friction, but when he felt James’s fingers against his still lube coated hand, he did what he was told. Soon, cold slicked fingers were reaching behind him, probing his hole and Sherlock moved his hand over himself.
They fell together easily after that. Sherlock read James’ reactions to John’s movements like a book and quickly copied them, caressing him, stroking him while he and John kissed. John showed James how and where to touch Sherlock. They moaned and gasped in each other’s mouth and when James rolled on his back, Sherlock helped John to settle on his lap, before he settled back on his knees next to them.
Sherlock stirred behind John but James didn’t pull away from him. Perhaps he hadn’t noticed. Perhaps he didn’t care. But John could feel Sherlock turning to his side, pressing himself up against John’s back. Sherlock’s long fingers caressed their joint hands for a moment before he opened his mouth. ‘You’ve started without me.’
Sherlock didn’t know how long they stayed like that. They probably should call someone, alert the doctor that this time John was fully awake instead of his drifting in and out of consciousness of the last few days. But he didn’t want this to end. Not yet.
The two men were cleaning up the dishes, occasionally sipping their wine, their shoulders brushing as they worked. And they were talking.
John says nothing for a moment, nodding quietly to himself, before moving his hand to his trouser pocket. The box is simple, black, a square and horribly cliché and yet it makes Sherlock’s heart skip a beat when John opens it to reveal a white gold band.
They had fun and Sherlock found himself smiling in response. It was good to see James relax like this. To be able to see a glimpse of the man he had been before things had gone horribly wrong.
James knew what was going on; Sherlock could see it the moment he entered the flat. Sherlock wondered how much John had told him. He had greeting John in their usual manner – straight backs and raised chins, both of them every inch of the soldier they once were – and greeting him his a firm handshake that had seemed to linger.
It was a good thing he was already sitting down because he could feel the strength leave his body. Like a puppet whose strings were cut. His vision blacked out for a moment and a pained groan escaped him on the exhale.
John had rolled off of James and had settled on his side against James. His head rested on his shoulder. The condom had been removed, knotted closed and discarded in the little bin by the bed. James had his good arm wrapped around John’s shoulders, holding him close, and stroking his upper arm lazily. John had his eyes closed already, completely relaxed, but James regarded Sherlock with heavy eyes.
‘’You stupid idiot. You absolute cock. Never again, you hear me. You can never allow me to hurt you again. Sherlock… you deserve better.’’
Nobody moved for a second after Sherlock’s outburst. John and Sherlock kept staring at each other. Greg kept looking at them both, unable to supress his grin. This had to be the weirdest marriage proposal he had ever heard of and it was goddamned perfect. Leave it to them to completely mess it up and get it right at the same time.
He snorts and Sherlock can practically feel John’s angry gaze settle on him now. ‘You just had to go on ahead didn’t you?’ he hisses. Sherlock doesn’t even bother to try and hide his eye rolling now. ‘No, Sherlock, stop that! Greg was only a couple of minutes behind us. We could have had him by now!’
Sherlock had not expected, but hadn’t been completely surprised by the flush of arousal coiling in his gut at the touch.
James was gripping Sherlock’s leg hard now, but Sherlock didn’t care. He placed his free hand on top of it and as if on instinct, their fingers tangled together.
John was the first one the wake up. He felt sore but not unpleasantly so, and warm. Very warm. He blinked a couple of times and a smile crept up on his lips when he remember last night. James. And Sherlock. And him.
John wanted to tell him to be careful but his words were slurring and he still couldn’t breathe and it felt like he was drowning –
The pain felt as Mary shot him in the chest was nothing compared to the pain he had felt when John had said ‘I do’ to another. Sherlock severely doubted he would live to see his next birthday at all.
‘Please John, I’m sorry.’ Sherlock could hear his own voice breaking, eyes fixed on John’s chest. But Mary is calling, he can hear her talking, help is on the way. Mycroft will be here soon. ‘Please, John, they’ll be here. Hold on, please, I’m begging you, don’t die…’
There was something in John’s gaze whenever Sholto came up in conversation or when his phone chimed, bearing a new message for his old commander and friend. And strangely, Sherlock didn’t feel jealous. How could he? Sholto made John smile, made him think of happier days in a dark past. And due to his role in their relationship, Sherlock could feel nothing but gratitude and admiration for the man. He knew what it was like to give John up to someone else. The pain of it.
He pressed his fingers there where John wanted them the most, massaging the gland hidden inside of him and John’s back arched of the bed. The muscles flexed and relaxed around Sherlock’s  fingers as he came, a shout escaping him.
Sherlock inhaled deeply before forcing the air out again. The room snapped back into focus in his mind – the beeping of the machines registering John’s heartbeat, the soft green colour on the walls that was meant to calm, John’s heart beating steady, the sound of the nurses’ station opposite of John’s room and John’s stable, beating heart! – and he moved his gaze up to John’s face.
The feeling of James’ hand sliding over his own, made Sherlock look down over John’s shoulder again. James had diverted his attention away from them, focussing on the movements of Sherlock’s fingers on the belt. They opened it together and with a little help from Sherlock, James pulled down John’s trousers and pants. And oh, how Sherlock knew that look well.
John buried his face in the crook of Sherlock’s neck, hiding himself from view again. Sherlock could feel the tightness in his shoulders and his trembling breath. God, how long had he been hiding this? From the world? From himself? How heavy had the weight of his guilt become in the months he and John had been together.
John’s fingers are trembling as he undoes the buttons of Sherlock’s shirt and Sherlock clenches his own hands on his lap. He tries to steel himself for John’s anger. He tries to prepare for the questions, the accusations, the guilt. John moves to stand behind Sherlock. He feels his shirt slide off his shoulders and he tenses.
Oh that voice. Sherlock swallowed, his eyes meeting John’s briefly. He looked gorgeous like this. Cheeks flushed, pupils blown wide and his shortly cropped hair an absolute mess. And that smile! John was happy and Sherlock’s heart did something wild in response.
And suddenly Sherlock realised that he wanted to explore James like that as well. Map out every inch of his skin. Find out what made him shiver. What made him moan and writhe. To feel the weight of him in his hands.
‘Relax John. Deep breaths. He’ll love it. And trust me, he’ll say yes. He loves you more than anything.’
With all the strength he had left, he lifted his own hand to clasp Sherlock’s bony wrist. He could feel Sherlock’s pulse fluttering against his fingers –
John angrily put his phone away and zipped up his coat when he heard a thump from upstairs. He froze, disbelieving, before running up the stairs and throwing his door open.
I've been thinking about some one-shot prequels (the conversation between James and Sherlock without John & John and James in Afghanistan to name two). Please, let me know what you thought of it and you'd be interested and reading those.
Later, he would blame the pain for his lack of foresight. He would blame whatever was left of the morphine in his system. He would blame himself for weeks, months to come.
‘It is my fault!’ Sherlock suddenly shouted and John recoiled. The detective eyes were wild and red-rimmed and his cheeks were tracked with tears, but John doubted if Sherlock even realised he was crying as he continued shouting. ‘I didn’t see in time. I ignored him because I wanted to annoy him. To get back to him for putting back the bloody camera’s.’ Sherlock was climbing of the bed now and started pacing wildly across the room, his hand gestures changing between flinging wildly in the air to pulling his hair. John stepped back, giving him the room he needed, while clenching his hands because he wanted to hold him still. ‘I was too late,’ Sherlock continued frantic, ‘and he trusted me to help him and I was too focussed on Lestrade’s case and now he’s dead! My brother is dead because I didn’t see. Mycroft…’
And with a shout against Sherlock’s lips, John came. James didn’t slow down for him though and John quivered, struggling to stay upright as wave after wave of pleasure wrecked him. Sherlock followed not long after. The sounds being forced from John’s throat and James insistent finger pulled him over the edge and that was when James allowed himself to let go.
Sherlock would never forget the sound of John’s breath leaving him. He would never forget the way John’s body sagged in the wheelchair, how heavy he felt in his arms. And the blood, John’s blood on his hands as he tried to remove John’s clothing out the way with trembling fingers.
‘’You hid this from me… all that time,’’ John doesn’t pull away from Sherlock’s hands and Sherlock let himself trace the lines of John’s face. He feels a sharp pain in his chest when another tear catches on his finger. John isn’t supposed to cry. Never again. He made that promise to himself.
‘John!’ Sherlock’s voice suddenly rang loud and clear in his ears and John wanted to do nothing more than to reach out to reassure him. But he can’t move and he can’t breathe and oh dear God, this is it! This was wrong…this was all so wrong…
Lestrade laughed at John’s response and Sherlock could hear John slapping the DI’s arm. ‘Come off it. What if he doesn’t like it? Or what if he says no? You heard him when he gave his speech. Oh God, what am I thinking…’
Eleven months now and at times like this Sherlock still couldn’t believe his luck. John loved him. Sherlock nuzzled his face against John’s neck, peering over his shoulder to look at the screen as John resumed his typing.
Sherlock crashes their lips together and whatever John was about to say next, gets lost between their lips. Whenever their lips part for breath, Sherlock manages to breathe out the words that keep swirling through his head.
Without the heat of his jealousy tainting his view, like it had on the wedding, Sherlock was mesmerised by the two men in the kitchen of Baker Street.
The kiss is slow. Soft. A perfect mirror for all the years it took for them to get here. Sherlock isn’t aware that he is holding on to John’s jumper until the older man wraps him arms around him to pull him closer, deepening the kiss at the same time. But it is still slow, as if they have all the time in the world and perhaps, Sherlock thinks as they pull away gasping, they do now. Finally.
But John turned his face to Sherlock and he could feel his control spiralling out of control at the sight of him. John’s hand was trembling when he reached and grabbed Sherlock’s neck, pulling their mouths together again. It wasn’t a kiss; they both lacked the focus for that. But their lips and teeth grazed as James continued to push up into John.
Sherlock frowned for a moment, eyes darting around the room, as if he’d forgotten where he was and what was being asked. Then, when John bend down to pick the syringe from the ground, he snapped back into focus. ‘Heroine.’ The harshness of his voice pulled John back up and he took a step closer to the bed. Sherlock was shivering, hiding away as far in his coat as he could manage. ‘I just need…just want it to stop, John. Please…’ Sherlock pressed his eyes shut and grimaced. ‘Stupid…stupid…’ John could hear him whispering and he felt his insides grow cold as Sherlock continued his babbling. ‘Disappointing. He used to call me that when we were children. Did you know that John? Such a disappointment. I always tried to prove him wrong. Tried to prove I was as clever as him but he wasn’t wrong, was he John? I was too late, I didn’t see…too late.’ He hid his face from John but not before he had seen the trembling of his lips.
He let go of John’s hips and moved his hands to his front. Sherlock’s fingers brushed James’ chest in the process, earning him a shiver from the other man, but he moved on. Later, Sherlock told himself. If he could, he would do that later.
Sherlock was laying on his stomach, his scarred back bare and his face turned away from them but John knew he was still asleep; he’d never be this still when awake. James was pressed up against the other side of John, his arm wrapped around his waist, heavy and warm, pinning him into place. He still snored, John realised. Just a little. Not loud enough to be bothersome, but enough to know that it would turn louder in a minute or so.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. Oh, how wrong John was. ‘I’m not jealous,’ he declared and John raised his eyebrow in disbelief. ‘I am not! But you get that look in your eyes when you email him and I…’
James’ face softened a little and John turned around, moving away from his hand. But they weren’t out of reach from each other for even a second. They moved in sync, closer, ever closer and Sherlock straightened himself in his chair. Had they been like this back then? God, the mere thought of it made him ache.
John’s heart was big enough for the both of them and as Sherlock crawled on the bed to clean them, he wondered if his own might be bigger than expected.
Sherlock found he couldn’t look at John’s face – he can fool himself like this. He can pretend he isn’t wrong – so he kept his eyes focused on his chest. John’s chest, where the bullet from Mary’s gun tore a hole through him because of Sherlock. Because he thought he was being clever, because he thought he knew her and it caused John’s heart to stop!
He wants to scream, demand John to say something, anything, just to break the silence. But John keeps shaving him, silently.
‘Oh no, you don’t,’ James’ voice suddenly interrupted him and Sherlock froze. His hand had been moving to his own erection to relieve some of the pressure. ‘Come here, Sherlock. John…’
John was staring at him, eyes a bit glazed from the painkillers but alert. Awake. Fully, finally, after days of living in limbo, he was awake!
His shirt. His back. Stupid! Idiotic! He should have thought this through. John can’t see… it never was his intention for John to know. He can’t –
He must have made a noise because suddenly both men turned their attention to him. James beckoned him over with a nod and a smile and John reached out his hand. ‘Come here, love. Please.’
Sherlock’s heart skipped a bit. Love. An endearment so easily given, often with a smile so warm it made Sherlock want to kiss it. And now, he could.
But he is not moving and he can hear Mary let out a cry of horror. No. No, not like this. John will not die on the cold hard ground. He will die when he is grey and wrinkled and his fingers can no longer type and not a moment sooner!
John sagged against James, not caring about the mess he made on James’ chest and James carefully pulled his finger out. He stroked Sherlock’s ass for a second and Sherlock shivered at the sensation. They stayed like that for a moment, catching their breaths with their eyes closed – well, James and John had theirs closed. Sherlock couldn’t stop looking at them.
A flood of worry overwhelmed him as John picked it up and put it back where it belonged. ‘Damn it,’ he muttered. He took a quick glance in Sherlock’s bedroom, finding the same amount of devastation as in the living room, and he knew his own room would look similar.
They were both silent, allowing themselves to feel the other man’s breath on their skin. So close. They came so close to losing this before it ever truly began. Sherlock despises himself for ever telling John that breathing was boring. Because it wasn’t. Because right now, Sherlock would give everything to ensure John would never stop breathing again.
James chuckled deeply, but he undid his trousers anyway. He stepped out of them and his pants followed his trousers to the floor shortly after and John moved away from Sherlock to crawl on the bed along with James.
John took a deep breath and tried to remember Sherlock’s boltholes. But frankly, he had no idea. No idea how to reach out to his friend, no idea how to find him, help him and convince him to come home. Before…oh Jesus bloody Christ. ‘I…Mycroft has a list of all his hiding places in his office, I don’t…maybe Anthea, his assistant, knows some…’
That next year he was so deeply involved in solving a gruesome triple murder that he didn’t even notice he was another year older until January had passed in its entirety. And so he drifted on. Constantly alternating between boredom, craving the high only cocaine could give him - but never giving in - and chasing the high the cases would provide him for as long as possible.
His mind kept repeating those words over and over again so he nearly fell backwards when the door suddenly opened and John and Lestrade came out of Lestrade’s office, still talking. John nearly crashed into Sherlock.
But he did. Despite being shot, despite having killed, despite accepting his death sentence - because, honestly, what was the point of even trying to stay and fight? - despite Moriarty’s and Mary’s attempts, he found himself alive on the 6th of January 2015.
John didn’t say anything for a moment. But Sherlock could see that he wasn’t going to argue; he was right and John knew it. ‘Jesus, Sherlock… what are you saying?’
That next birthday was forgotten - again - by both John and Sherlock. John was too busy with the preparations for his wedding and Sherlock was too busy trying to ignore the way his stomach clenched at the mere thought of John standing in front of an altar. Without him.
‘John?’ Sherlock reached out to him with a heavy arm when John had removed the big heavy coat and moved to pull off Sherlock’s shoes. John placed a hair on his curls and petted him affectionately.
I have never been in a polyamorous relationship or situation. This is in no way, shape or form meant to insult, belittle or ridicule those of you who are.

Lestrade had chastised him once, after one to many close call with the wrong end of a knife, that Sherlock might well be in the danger of having celebrated his last birthday already and to be honest, Sherlock hadn’t been able to care less.  His last birthday had been the 6th of this month, 2010. His parents had sent a card, Mycroft had stayed silent. Lestrade didn’t even know. Sherlock decided it was alright.
James and Sherlock untangled their hands and Sherlock carefully removed his fingers. James reached out for the condoms, handing one of the wrappers to John, who made quick work of it. He settled his hands on John’s hip, ready to guide him.
With the heat and tightness of John’s body clamping down on his, even though it was just on his finger, Sherlock’s senses suffered an overload. There was nothing, no one, but the feeling of John and James underneath and around his hands.
"It was the only way I found out to calm you." He reasoned with a chuckle, then noticed how Sherlock looked down slightly. "What's wrong?" He asked softly.
"No John I'm not going to bed when there is a killer out there!" Sherlock yelled once again. John just shrugged.
The ex-army doctor was left quite shocked, soon erupting with laughter as he realised what happened.
"Not as much as I love you though." John slipped, then realised what he'd said a clapped a hand over his mouth, watching as Sherlock tensed, then instantly thought of how he'd get up and leave, or tell John to leave. But the genius just stayed how he was... not moving... as if he was thinking. But then he slowly relaxed and moved his head up to meet John's hand again.
"I... uh... I'm just gonna go..." He said awkwardly, John gave him a single nod and kept stroking Sherlock's hair. He then looked at the detective in question, who instead just made a small hum sound.
As soon as Greg left, John slowly stopped running his hand through Sherlock's hair, and watched as the man looked up at him and frowned.
"Ca- .....Can you do it again?" Sherlock asked softly, almost shy. And John felt his heart swell a little, so he just nodded and sat more comfortably on the sofa, and let Sherlock curl up in between his legs, resting his head on John's chest, then felt his arms wrap around him as he began to run his hand through Sherlock's curls once again.
"You really do end up surprising me everyday... Just when I thought I understood you, you go and let me find out something else." He chuckled softly. He felt Sherlock chuckle too.
"Sherlock you are still recovering from one!" Then John noticed the look of realisation spread across his best friend's face and caught on. "No..  Sherlock we said no more smoking!" He confirmed, his stern Captain voice taking over but Sherlock just stared at him before making a dash for the bedroom, John however was ready and wrapped his arms around Sherlock's waist, and dropped to the floor, taking the detective with him. Then rolled them over and pinned him down.
