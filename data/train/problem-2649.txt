It does. His suggestions for printed slogans get increasingly more ludicrous as dinner continues, but Eileen doesn’t care. They’re both laughing too hard.
Everyone comes out and hugs them goodbye. Donna and Jody send Dean off to a concert with the same somber farewell with which they might have sent him off to die.
The worst thing is that Dean has no one to blame but himself. He’s the one who couldn’t keep it together. He’s the one who showed Cas how pathetic he is: somehow both a child whining about monsters in the closet and the monster itself. Nothing redeemable in the middle, just crap that no one needs, a gun in his hand.
A few minutes later, Dean smirks into his coffee cup as Cas’s hands brush one of his coat pockets and discover something inside that wasn’t there before.
“All the Knights of Hell are dead.” Castiel says, with a slight frown. Dean stops himself from adding ‘except me’ at the end of that sentence, but only because he’s distracted by a fluttering of wings down the line.
Because what could that possibly mean other than goodbye? Because what version of that confession ended with them together?
He’s not going to say that though. It’s bad enough to know it, he doesn’t need everyone else to know that, too.
He turns back to Eileen, about to sign “Smoothies?” when Eileen beats him to the punch with “I’m thirsty, too.”
Dean had just figured he was a little broken. A bit greedy. Dad had always said he was a little too needy.
Cas though — Cas kept being around. Came back. Kept throwing himself into danger for the Winchesters. For Dean. Had the audacity to apologise for everything, including Jack, like that had been anything other than Dean’s own fucking fault. He had looked at Dean and said, “I left, but you didn’t stop me,” like Dean had ever been the kind of person who was strong enough to ask Cas to stay.
So, Dean doesn’t say that. He lets his left hand drift behind him on the desk and clench the walkman, letting everything he can’t say well in his chest and spill out through his eyes. He gets as close to the truth as his matchlock heart will let him.
Finally, it’s just a matter of figuring out what kind of creature eats organs and reflects people upside down. After a two second conversation revealing the inverted reflection, Dean groans. Eileen nods her agreement. Hunting Aswangs sucks.
Eileen flips back to her records from the first days after she arrived. Sure enough, notes in a smattering of places point to one Isabelle Clark: beautiful pillar of the community, rich in family money, and single-handedly responsible for funding 3 of the homeless shelters in Tulsa. She also helps fund a few clinics and hosts the annual policeman’s ball.
He's stalking his way to the kitchen before he passes a slumped figure in the library and skids to a halt. For one terrifying second, he thinks
Alone in the kitchen, with Blackpink indecipherable in his ears, Dean reflects on the peculiar beauty of that.
“But you don’t know me.” Jeez, kid’s really stuck on that, isn’t he? Cas is watching Dean with a bit of mischief in his eyes, so Dean knows he’s going to be absolutely no help. I have time, Dean had said, like a fucking moron.
Dean remembers that kiss. Remembers the realization that Cassie had learned what every person eventually does — that Dean, Dean’s life, what Dean
He thinks of the Mark singing out to the First Blade, his body singing out to Amara. Dorothy continues with
The sound of the tape rewinding jolts Dean out of his thinking. Reminds him of the start of this problem: Cas and his mixtapes and his attention and his love.
Sam looks contrite. “Sorry. Yeah. I’m just thinking.” With Sam, that’s a given, but he’s still looking at Dean like he’s not positive if Dean is really there or some elaborate illusion. It’d be more worrying if that wasn’t an actual possibility with the lives they lead. Dean lowballs him an explanation.
Without it, there’s barely enough English to pull apart. On his relisten, Dean gets “I’m foxy” in one verse and “test me” in another.
Dean knows he’s a mess, okay? He just can’t let Eileen know he’s a mess. He can’t let anyone know he’s a mess. Well, okay, he can’t let anyone else know he’s a mess. Everyone is so happy with their happy endings, and Dean has ruined enough.
. Dean’s mind is a swath of white noise. Just him, the landscape hurtling past, and the voice pouring out of his speakers saying
Sam gives him a funny look. Cas feels himself frown in response. He doesn’t know what that look means, he doesn’t know what Dean was afraid of, he doesn’t know why Dean would send him away just to sleep and suffer. Dean has nightmares every night. Cas would give anything to be allowed to push them away. To spend the night in Dean's bed, to allow him rest.
“Cas,” he hedges, willing his brain to come up with a reason for him to have called. He tries to imagine Cas where he is, but he can’t remember if Cas is in Heaven or at the bunker. He still hasn’t screwed his head on all the way because he blurts out, “Where are you?”
A/N: Non told me to add content warnings to this if necessary but I am stupid so TW: Dean has feelings about stuff, Cas also has feelings about stuff. I don't think anything is too wild but my bar is pretty high.
Cas, it turns out, is wearing shoes. Dean knows because he’s staring at them. This conversation has been a complete trainwreck.
He hadn’t been laughing when he reached across the space between them to put his hand on Cas’s knee, caught Cas in his magnetic gaze, and asserted, “You know, you have to win, right?”
No one really talks while they rip apart breakfast. Even Jody and Donna are too busy devouring their meal. Kaia smacks Claire's hand away from her plate, so Dean hands her the pan, and Claire mops up the leftover sauce like the feral creature she is.
drifts from Baby’s speakers. Dean's hands tighten on the steering wheel, and his heart keeps a carefully steady rhythm as the lyrics
“He looks up to you, as well.” Dean can’t respond to that in any real way, can’t respond to the assault of Cas standing so close to him, continuing to believe in a better version of Dean, even after Dean has proven that version of him died long ago.
He can almost hear Cas's careful correction to Dean's take, too. “Dean,” he'd say, frown tugging at his lips, and nothing but bald honesty in his eyes. “I performed miracles, but I didn't believe in them until I met you.” Like that's a sentence that makes any kind of sense.
In a desperate bid to move past his own failings, Dean turns Baby on and hits play on the tape deck.
Perhaps some of the garrison will assist him. Zadkiel will certainly be interested in any endeavor that benefits Dean, and it might be educational for them all. So few of the angels were there for the formation of the mountains. It will be fun. “Maybe sooner.”
He sneaks half a glance at Eileen to make sure she hasn’t noticed anything. She’s leaning comfortably against Baby’s door, tracing her hands carefully around Baby’s interior, unconsciously mirroring something Sam has done a hundred times.
Eileen’s never been someone's first priority. Hell, she doubts she’s ever been someone's second priority. She’s used to it. Still, sometimes, watching Sam and Dean, she thinks that it might be nice. Sam and Dean would both move Heaven and Earth for their little makeshift family. Eileen’s not sure she’s ever merited that much effort from anyone.
Dean is fine. He’s listening to Cas’s mixtape, hunched over alone in his room, and he’s just perfectly fine.
“I don't know yet.” Dean's voice is a sharp bite. He tries to soften it with, “I'm looking into it.” It doesn't work.
He fiddles with the walkman and hits play, letting Love Starvation drown out the creaking of the bunker. He smiles to himself. He's had all day to not think about it, so by the time he gets to the end of the song, he's comfortably able to tell himself that Cas just put it one the tape because it reminded him of a fun day that they all spent together. No other reason.
Dean grabs a second gallon bag of googly eyes and accepts the one thing he can take away from this song: Cas thinks the light of humanity is love, and Dean should find the courage to actually say it back.
love with him, that was a surprise. What a pesky preposition. Love versus In Love. Cas loved Sam, but he was in love with Dean. Similar in so many ways, but with a slight change, a tiny, insignificant word, so utterly different.
Nothing at all is wrong. Dean is relaxed. It’s easy enough to pretend nothing bothers him when he’s behind Baby’s wheel. He’s got years of practice. The song fades out, Dorothy starts singing, and still Dean is casual, comfortable as he hurtles down the open road.
Cas has the decency to look more surprised than hurt, so Dean piles on. That's the Dean Winchester way, after all. You find a hole and you start fucking digging. “You can’t
This time, instead of withdrawing his hand, Cas’s hand wanders down to his neck, where he lands gently against Dean’s headphones. The headphones have become a semi-permanent installation on his neck. Sam has given them a few weird looks, but he mercifully hasn’t asked any questions.
“Give me your heart,” Cas says, and it’s so easy here, in the haze of want and lust and need, to reply to him honestly. It’s like the words are already there when Dean opens his mouth.
“What about Everest? Like, what if I said I needed you to move Everest an inch to the left?” Cas spares a second to mentally orient and determine which direction Sam means by ‘left.’ Presumably west. He’s unsure if there would be political ramifications of moving it farther into Nepal, then realises he could probably just move it back if need be.
And Dean pulled a smile onto his face, because honestly, Jack is kinda cute sometimes. “I remember, kiddo.”
It feels too personal. Too much like having his own ragged ticker pressed into polyester. He can’t bring himself to look at what Cas might have to say about it.
There are stars as far as he can see. Here, alone in the middle of nowhere, Dean appreciates the vastness of the sky, the steadiness of the stars. He thinks about how, if Sam was here, he’d be pointing out his favorite constellations. That Cas would tell him the history of each speck of light. That he and Jack could make up their own, connecting the stars in new ways.
“Hmm...okay. He’s definitely smart, because we both know you like that.”  Dean realises suddenly that he does have a type, and that type turned out to be ‘secretly an asshole.’ “He’s probably a fighter, too. You need someone who will stand up for you.”
A/N: EILEEN MY BELOVED. Hopefully the central presence of THEE hunter queen makes up for a late evening post - Non<3
“You know he’s going to retaliate.” Cas says, twisting in his seat to look at Dean like it's not at all strange that Dean walked into the room and froze like Captain America in his downed plane.
Cas feels his own anger walk in with him. For some reason, Dean falters for a half step when his eyes fall on Cas. Cas keeps his eyes trained on the book in front of him.
Grabbing the walkman, he slams his headphones on as he sits at the desk. He's clearly gone insane already. What could possibly make it worse?
When Cas slides his fingers through Dean’s sternum, the response is immediate, orgasmic. Dean whites out somewhere between pleasure and pain. He might be screaming, but it doesn’t matter because Cas is happy. Cas is so happy.
“Cas,” Dean says, and it's reproachful. “Did you follow Zad following fish to the bottom of the ocean?”
If Cas thinks that's going to make Dean run off with his tail between his legs, he’s got another thing coming.
Dean salted and burned bones with his father before he could shoot, watched spirits flame out of existence. Fire was almost comforting — igniting bones, holy oil. A barrier against evil. Fire meant a body to burn. Closure, sometimes. Endings, always. Fire clears. Fire purifies. It might destroy, but at least it’s simple.
Okay. That's a sick guitar riff. Honestly, the whole song is cool. It’s angry without being mean in a way Dean always wanted but could never manage.
No one in the world is quite as easy to talk to as Sam, but Cas is wonderful. Eileen is endlessly fascinated by his mind. He’s genuinely interested in her opinions on everything and anything, and he’s overflowing with hilarious little insights and anecdotes. Plus, he’s fluent in sign language, so she’s never guessing at what he might have said, scrambling to put context clues together. She doesn’t have to guess if she’s talking too loud, moving her mouth right to make sounds she can’t hear. She can just be.
In his defense, Dean’s focus is split. His Uno strategy may be suffering, but at least he finally figured out how Claire and Eileen are cheating. They’re palming cards to each other, while also sneaking extras into other people’s decks when they’re not looking.
Ella Fitzgerald's unmistakeable vocals promptly croon into the silence. Dean actually has to scramble, because he'd turned up the volume to hear every word of Taylor's song, and I'm Beginning To See The Light is simply louder. He's going to have to teach Cas about how to normalize volumes on mixtapes for next time.
Dean takes off the headphones, puts his phone to charge, and doesn’t bother to set an alarm. He lays himself down for a night of uneasy sleep.
This shouldn’t be a surprising thought, but it is. Dean turns it over in his head. Dean could ask Cas out to dinner, and Cas would say yes. Dean could suggest a camping trip with just the two of them, and Cas wouldn’t find that strange. He could invite Cas to stay up after Sam and Jack go to bed, to watch movies and be together, and Cas would say yes.
Cas stands there for a few more seconds, then moves and sits in the chair across from Sam, thinking hard. Maybe he could talk to Eileen. She’s also dating a Winchester. She might have insight regarding how to overcome their idiotic stubbornness.
She blinks down at the body that was never even close to coming in range, then smiles back at Dean. It’d been her plan, and it was the best one they’d had. He said he could make the shot, and he had.
“Fuck off.” He starts, because it’s a strong start. He slams the last two glasses back to the table. “You’ve literally eaten my cooking before.” He adds, because she has. “Hell, you basically single-handedly ate all the wings from last game night.”
“That day, I learned what family really meant, and it wasn’t a white fence and chimera children. It was the way that you loved your brother. You were willing to take action to lessen his pain, even with no certainty that those actions would reach him or mean anything. Your love for Sam, and his love for you, has saved the world more times than either of you will ever truly comprehend.”
When it finishes Cas’s arm, the heart is big enough to rear its disgusting head to devour Cas whole. A hundred jaws drool inky black. As it bites into Cas’s shoulder, it pops open a hundred inky white eyes, glassily intent on their prey. Cas keeps his smile fixed on his face, but Dean sees the corner of his mouth tightening with pain. He can’t ignore the tears leaking out of Cas’s eyes.
Fuck. Dean stops thinking. He just stops. Focuses on the rise and fall, the moody lilt of the song, the cyclical pull of his own breathing.
Cas regards Dean like he’s seeing him for the first time and pauses. “Do you truly believe your life is worth so little?” like there is any answer to that other than yes.
The Impala is something of a Mecca to the Winchesters. More than a car, halfway to a home. Would it be offensive to turn it down? Also, they’re going to the same place, so there’s no reason to take two cars. Eileen’s not attached to any of the weapons stashed in her car safe — just the knife already strapped to her calf.
It’s not that there aren't dangerous things out there. Dean went out to assist Claire with a werewolf case. Sam and Eileen took down a nest of rabid vamps. Hell, last month, Dean and Sam killed a Djinn. Dean fucking hates Djinn. Still, it’s mostly restless spirits.
Cas is too close. Close enough to read the ficker of shame that passes unbidden into Dean’s eyes, the tightening of his mouth, the way he desperately wants to explain why Jack shouldn’t. Dean doesn’t say it, but he knows that Cas sees it anyway. How could Cas not?
After a few minutes, Donna hoists herself onto the dock, laying at their feet while citing her need for both a tan and protection from Kaia’s vicious elbows. She brings lively chatter, and Dean loves her for it. He doesn’t say anything about it. No point in scaring her.
Jody reaches a hand out, and Dean takes the food without getting any closer. “Even these idiots can’t mess up a PB&J sandwich.” Dean contorts his face into an easy grin, then stuffs the sandwich in his face.
Oh. Well. Cas hadn’t realised it would be so simple. “What mountain do you need moved? I am happy to move it for you. It’s not difficult — merely time consuming.” Then, in the spirit of complete honesty, Cas adds, “It can be done more quickly, but I prefer to relocate all the animals by hand.” Cas mentally consults his schedule. “I could have it done by Friday.”
Eileen: tucked under Sam’s arm, laughing. Claire: safe and satisfied. Kaia: unhaunted. Patience: undivided. Alex: unafraid. Jody and Donna: at rest, unworried about things that lurk, and stalk, and threaten their family.
Kaia is inside staring blearily at the coffee maker like she could manifest coffee with sheer force of will. Dean, gently, displaces her and starts the pot. She shoots him a grateful look and settles at the island to wait.
Dean feels pressure build behind his eyes, finds himself blinking a bit more than he should. The song continues with
Dinner is a loud affair. Jack offers to help cook, and Dean's happy enough to teach the kid how to properly cut up carrots. Sam is thrilled by the salad, even though Dean's really only using it as a vehicle for steak. They clean up, and then Jack wants to try new spices atop their popcorn, so Dean grinds chili garlic and has to make a whole separate batch because Jack and Sam finish the first before Cas even settles on the couch.
Max’s coven is loose, rarely gathering. It’s more a network of good witches who keep each other informed and act as seconds when needed. Tasha set it up years ago. Max thinks it’ll be good for them to meet Sam in person, especially with the hunter network growing. If nothing else, it’d be handy to have a few good witches on call.
“Stop. Okay. I get it. Stop.” Dean just needs Cas to stop talking for a second. Needs to wrap his head around this. Needs five fucking seconds to deal with Cas’s excuse for refusing to see reason being that he loves Dean more selfishly then Dean loves Cas. Needs to find a way off of this desk and out of this room.
This sends a laughing Jody into the room, and then she’s pushing him away from the sink and out of the kitchen.
“It’s two creatures, Eileen. It’s two goddamn creatures. One drains the blood, other uses the organs. I don’t even think the scratches and bite marks are a monster. I think they’re hiding their kills by feeding the remains to wild animals.”
Then, suddenly, Jack was there. Standing in their foyer, waving and smiling before Sam's massive form crushed him into a bone deep hug.
Dean’s hand clenches around the walkman. He’s so stupid. Cas had been able to convince himself that he was in love, but he shouldn’t have been able to convince Dean.
Before the lyrics even start, he's laughing. He knows this one! “Love Starvation” by Nick Lowe. He remembers when Sam threw the album on and they'd taught Jack how to sock slide, because that's a very important hunter skill, thank you very much. He remembers explaining to Jack the meaning as he'd carefully asked, “Can you…starve from lack of love?” Dean had to explain that the person wasn't literally starving. He wasn't in any danger. “Sometimes you just want to touch someone so badly that every time you're not it feels like starving. It's a love song.” Jack had screwed up his face and said, “I'm not sure I understand this kind of love.” Sam had laughed and said, “You're only 3. You're really not supposed to.”
She does not manage to resist the urge to slam her head into the desk a few times. What the genuine fuck is going on in Tulsa?
, which Dean thinks is appropriate. Dean listens, and he feels the song settle like a gunvest on his chest: heavy, and not very useful in a fight with demons.
Like it was waiting for her, an image floats to her mind. It’s game night. Sam is passing her Scrabble tiles, and Claire is in a corner laughing at something Kaia said. Patience is frowning down at her letters while Alex rearranges something beside her. Dean is putting food on the table, and Jack is poking Cas’s side, asking him a question as Cas carefully smiles back. The table is practically humming with happiness.
So, Dean had picked himself off the floor and dragged Sammy with him, until half the time he was faking a smile, he even actually meant it.
Dean hadn’t been able to handle the idea of Cas being dragged off to whatever Hell Eve had for him with the belief that Dean was angry with him.
Michael darted out of nowhere when they crossed the threshold into Heaven, crashing into Cas with a hearty laugh, insisting that next year would see him in the finals. Laughter and chatter echoed across angel radio. Cas beamed at the joy mirrored across the faces of his brothers and his son.
“She’s really nice,” is what Kaia leads with, but Claire snorts and says what he knows they’re both thinking.
Dean had tried. Dean had tried to tell his brother he loved him. It felt important. Like it’d be all he had to say to get his point across. But the words had turned to ash in his mouth. He hadn’t been able to do it.
“He knows you’re not angry, and he wanted me to tell you he’s sorry.” Dean blinks and it takes him too long to open his eyes back up. Someone is going to have to talk to that kid about not apologizing for things that aren’t his fault. Dean’s breath is noisy when he pushes it out through his nose.
Briefly, he hates Cas. Cas is always doing shit like this — shoring up arguments that he knows Dean can’t fight. Cas is saying: I know you. I see you. I love you anyway.
Dean sold Cas a lie of free will that got him killed. Then, because it worked so well the first time, he kept doing it again and again and again.
It's a complete tonal shift, so Dean leaves the walkman paused as he clips it to his belt and walks around the kitchen in silence to start washing the dishes that Sam left last night. He waits till the rattling silence turns into Cas saying,
Cas makes a humming noise after a brief interlude of noise. Zadkiel is too far away to be picked up on the phone, but he’s clearly saying something. After some more chatter, Dean hears what may be Castiel’s quiet laughter.
The embarrassed groan Dean absolutely identifies. Definitely the right angel. Cas has a couple of stories about Zadkiel, actually. He must be one of Cas’s favorites. Dean knows that Cas loves his angel siblings very much, but there are a few he seems more worried about. Zadkiel, Mariel, Indra. Names that Dean can pick out. Saraphiel, Hafra, Hanael. Dean realizes he can actually list off a couple dozen angel’s names, along with random information about them.
His bellow could probably be heard 3 towns over. It didn’t need to be so loud, because when he spins around and stalks into the hallway, Dean and Eileen are standing just down the way laughing their asses off.
He doesn’t know what Dean will think. Dean’s never been shy about his hatred of witches. Mia says that Sam shouldn’t try to read Dean’s mind, but Dean’s never been shy on this topic.
A strange yearning overcomes Castiel for Sam to be his brother by origin, not just by choice, such that Cas might speak to him the way he’d speak to the closest of his angel siblings: in the abstraction of thought and emotion, fully and without reservation. It’s not a bond that one initiates with every angel, but Cas feels confident that were Sam capable of it, he would happily join Cas in that link. It’s not one that Cas has shared with anyone for thousands of years. Not since Anna, long before she first abandoned the garrison.
It’s not the stupidest hill Dean has ever chosen to die on, but it’s probably at least in the top 10 (okay, top 50).
Is James a bad father? He’s trying, at least. He wants to be a part of Patience’s life in some way. Isn’t that better than not wanting to be in it at all? Doesn’t it matter that he’s making an effort?
Dean feels as if a lock on a small corner of his heart has been hit with a shotgun, obliterating the keyhole and half the door in someone’s rush to get in. Words spill out.
And Cas was there, too. Cas simply appeared at Jack's shoulder, gently frowning. Sam stuttered back out of the hug, instinctually attempting to jerk Jack behind him at the movement, but it's hard to move a nephilim (God?) if he doesn't want to be moved. Jack had looked chastised, which set off alarm bells in Dean's mind that he could barely register over his mind screaming at his body to move, to go over there, but he couldn't. He couldn't move — because the three of them were perfect, and Cas's frown was flipping into a smile, and Dean could swear — he could SWEAR — he saw black goo creeping into the edge of the room.
He still has 3 hours, and it’s not like anyone is going to catch him. Plus, Cas would have expected him to be finished with this tape days ago.
The girls stay late into the night, but not as late as they could. Dean shadows them, tripping and giggling to their motel room. Sparing a second to check that the warding is still up, he sees Claire put out protective hexbags, but he then books it to his own room on the other side of the building because
is paired with the knowledge that Castiel rebuilt his body after he'd flayed himself apart in Hell, or if he's just nearly 40 and having an actual heart attack.
gun coming near my face?” Okay, that does make it sound kind of funny. In Dean’s defense, he’d been plenty panicked when Sam was being tortured by God. Still, Dean does have a reputation to uphold.
“Sam.” Dean interrupts, voice dripping in sincerity. It’s impossible not to listen. “It freaks me out that people — humans — could get a bunch of power and use it to kill, and steal, and become monsters. So, yeah. I don’t like evil witches. But you and Max aren’t that.”
Dean lets the song peter out. Lets the next song waft in. In classic Castiel fashion, the tone is suddenly soft and wistful, and Dean almost cries in relief when he realizes he's not having a stroke —  the lyrics are fully in a different language.
Dean, who has stopped being Dean Winchester so many times in his life, tries to find the part of that sentence that makes any kind of sense. So far, the only bit that tracks is “that’d be reductive.”
He jams play on Baby’s tape deck, and thankfully House of the Holy starts playing. Impossibly, Dean can still faintly hear
Dean pulls back onto the road as his laughter settles under control, and he can't even be upset, because of course Cas is a possessive bastard. Also, of course Cas is an ABBA fan. God, his angel is a weirdo.
Somewhat horrifyingly, the conversation turns to some podcast that Cassie is helping produce, and then she’s saying, “You have a really fascinating perspective, Kaia,” and Claire and Dean are watching with numb terror as the two of them trade numbers. Then, Cassie is asking them about their shirts, and Claire is talking about Stand Atlantic, which somehow turns into Claire and Kaia promising to look up Cassie next time they’re near DC.
He’s also no fool. He’s not 24 in a bar chasing away the loneliness of abandoning Sam and being abandoned by John. His knees pop when he stands sometimes. His body is littered with scars big and small, like the raised reminders of mistakes. He doesn’t usually have the energy or will to turn up the same amount of charm. He looks at his palms and sees thin lines where he’s drawn blood hundreds of times. His scarred knuckles alone show what kind of man he is.
Dean’s not going to admit to googling TV shows for kids because he expected this line of ribbing from Claire, so he settles instead for putting his hands on Claire’s shoulders and mustering as much seriousness as he can spare to say, “Claire, I want to be supportive of your interests.”
For a brief, insane moment, Dean entertains the idea of telling her the truth — explaining Cas’s confession, the mixtapes, the misery of loving someone and knowing that it’s not enough. He imagines Jody’s quiet sympathy, her nodding along as Dean explains that Cas is too good for him anyway, and he imagines her taking him into the backyard and putting him out of his misery like a beloved pet that had developed rabies.
He really had no one to blame when Castiel appeared in the kitchen 5 seconds later with 6 apples and a whole wheel of cheese from France (apparently). But it was so normal, so Cas, that Dean actually couldn't stop the way laughter bubbled out of him.
“Yeah,” Sam’s phone beeps, and he scowls at it. Apparently the frown is going to be a permanent fixture this morning. “Dammit. She says she’s got it, and I told Max I would be at the lunar ceremony but…” Sam trails off, dissatisfied.
He pulls back onto the road and lets the song play again. Its beautiful and loving and everything that loving Dean isn't, but
He can't undo those things. Hell, he wouldn't even know where to begin. But, he can do something John never did.
Still, not much has changed. Dean Winchester is fine. Hell, Dean Winchester is good. Dean rubs his hand against his mouth, rewinds the song, and feels strangely 10 years younger.
Still, Dean’s sort of a dude’s dude. A hunter’s hunter. Gruff, sometimes violent, but effective. Liliana probably would have loved him. He’s got a quick command of lore (not to Sam’s level, but still miles above most hunters), and he’s efficient.
Sam wants to go. It’s just — he sneaks another look at Dean, sitting across from him at the library table, fiddling with some car part that Sam can’t be bothered to identify, walkman headphones around his neck.
She hadn’t been super thrilled when Dean suggested “gods” as a top possibility. Eileen would like to fight fewer gods, generally. Call her simple, but monsters and demons are enough for her.
Dean tries to flatten his hand on Baby’s hood like it will dislodge the hook in his shoulder, like it will remove Alistair's hands from around his neck, like it will take the knife out of his hand. His hand remains a fist.
Sam hadn’t let him. Sam had watched him quietly self-destruct in a world where they no longer mattered, but every time he hit bottom, Sam had a case they had to do, or someone who needed their help. When it got too bad, Sam cracked open his own grief and Dean had understood that he couldn’t leave his brother alone to deal with the wreckage Dean himself had made.
“Evil witches, dude. I hate evil witches.” Sam frowns at him. “What, you think I’ve been secretly plotting Max’s murder or something?”
Cassie hums thoughtfully, and then turns her sharp eyes to Claire. Looks her up and down once, and says, “This man, he raised you?”
It's like he can't stop himself. He needs Jack to understand gun safety, and he needs Jack to understand it right now. Sam's giving him this weird look that could mean anything from, “I get guns waved in my face constantly, you need to calm down” to “It isn't even loaded, you need to calm down” or even maybe, “Jack is literally (maybe?) God and could probably resurrect me by blinking, you need to calm down” or perhaps, horribly, “You've pointed a loaded gun at me with full intention of pulling the trigger,
Eileen’s not a coward, and she’s not going to back down. She texts Dean a brief “I’ll ride with you, 3 minutes.” before gathering her stuff. If Dean’s not going to make room for her in The Life of Winchester, Eileen will carve it out herself.
Patience claims the book feels hopeless in a lot of places, frowning around how the characters get what they want in the end, but not what they need. Dean argues that the irrelevance of everything, from religion to truth to desire, isn’t supposed to be hopeless. It’s freeing. They toss quotes back and forth, arguing analyses, and Sam’s pretty sure that Dean means something different than what he’s actually saying when Dean points out the book’s argument that the truth is just as much a tool as a lie. Patience doesn’t seem to read too far into it, and Sam doesn’t know enough about the book to be sure.
His breathing is loud now, and he knows, he knows he has to keep quiet because he doesn't want to wake up Sam or Cas — so he slams the headphones on and hits play.
Dean surveys his handiwork. It’s definitely coming together. It’s sturdy, which is the most important part in Dean’s opinion, but it’s even beginning to look nice. Choosing to build a crib dock instead of a post dock or a simple floating dock had made Dean question his sanity multiple times, but with the anchors laid in and the scaffolding done, Dean can see how it was the right choice. Plus, he’d never forgive himself if it collapsed.
It’s a sentiment he understands. It’s Sam telling him not to get in the box. It’s Sam hunting for a cure to the Mark even after Dean told him to stop. It’s Sam saying, “It’s the only thing in the whole word I could always count on. It’s the only thing I’ve ever known that was true.”
He seems like a great guy, although it’s hard to tell how much of that is just Sam seeing his brother through little sibling glasses. Eileen wouldn’t know. She never had a sibling.
Claire adds, “So you knew her before Cas then?” which reminds Dean of Claire’s insanity, but he’s tired, and he doesn’t even know how to begin questioning the stroke she appeared to have at the diner, so he shrugs and answers.
“Yes.” Castiel says, frowning further. Castiel has no concept of shame, no difficulty saying things about how he feels because he sees no reason why he shouldn’t feel things. In the months after Castiel had confessed, died, and come back, he seemed to have given up lying about his feelings entirely.
But where does that leave Dean? Dean’s not so selfish that he’d let that stop Sam, but it makes the blessing hesitant to leave his mouth.
You make loving fun. In what universe, Cas? In what fucking universe has Dean made it fun to love him? In what fucking universe has Dean made it
Dean starts with what he knows. Despite what people always assume, he knows how to fucking problem solve. He mentally rifles through the lore on Cas and flowers, skipping right over a field with a windmill, and lands on Cas stooping at someone else's door to pick a rose. There’s Cas grabbing the Leviathan blossom. There’s Cas’s garden now, and his garden before Purgatory the first time. There’s Cas and Dean arguing about the book that Dean had found in the bunker called “The Meaning of Flowers.” Dean had been excited because he thought it was going to be a great way of sending coded messages, but all the flowers meant things like fidelity, eternal love — bullshit like that. Yellow carnations evidently meant “disdain,” which Dean found hilarious. Nothing says ‘I hate you’ like a bouquet apparently.
He stills for a second, allowing the song to wash over him, eyes closed and hands wringing Baby's steering wheel, and he just thinks
He enjoys the quiet with the sun rising over the horizon, filtering through the trees, making Jody’s cabin feel idyllic and safe. He takes a second to enjoy the light through the window before he hauls himself out of bed. Checking the warding at all the doors, he carefully copies a new rune meant to hide the presence of any life inside the cabin to supernatural creatures. By the time he’s checking the stock of the kitchen, Kaia has quietly wandered in. She sends him a shy smile, and picks at the wire of her own headphones in solidarity. With his own music off, Dean can just make out the quiet thrum of Kaia’s music, and it’s the only sound until Claire clatters down the stairs. She huffs a laugh at Dean’s old school walkman and calls him a hipster, but she also immediately tucks herself into Kaia’s space and proceeds to fall back asleep, so Dean’s not really sure if the greeting was conscious on her part or not.
Eileen had seen some of it, when Cas and Jack were gone. How Dean had shattered at losing the love of his life and his son, but had still carefully attended to Sam’s grief, still pushed Sam out of the dark place that Eileen hadn’t known how to traverse. Nothing in the world matters as much to Dean as Sam does.
Jack counted down, and Castiel was off like a bullet from a gun. Precise, powerful, perfect — Cas took to the skies with a speed he hadn’t needed in years. His focus was absolute, his objective clear. Indra was a half pace behind him, gaining fast, so Cas pulled out every trick he knew: flaring a wing in Indra’s face when he attempted to pass, diving and rolling to gain speed, cutting close on corners until Indra had no choice but to pull back or collide.
The Next Right Thing slides under his armor the tiniest bit: What now? What does he do now? Cas and him are too broken to ever work. Dean broke them. He can’t ‘little goals’ himself into being the right person for Cas. Dean can’t even pretend like —
“I apologize.” Cas says, and his face is serious, but Dean sees that twinkle in his eye and knows he’s being a little shit. Cas likes scaring the crap out of Dean just to see him jump. Cas brings his hand up to rest on Dean’s cheek, because that's a thing that they do now, even though it makes Dean have to close his eyes. Every time he tells himself he won’t lean into Cas’s palm, and every time he does. Dean reaches out and lets his left hand squeeze Cas’s bicep.
“You can just text him, Claire,” he snaps, but manages to bring his tone away from sharp at the last second. He remembers several nights of Cas’s quiet worry that he’s overstepping in his relationship with Claire. His insistence that she should always be the one to approach him.  “He gets service in Heaven, and he’d be happy to come over whenever.”
Once he finishes the dishes, Dean wanders listlessly through the empty bunker. With Sam and Eileen on a hunt while Jack and Cas do important Heavenly work (Dean knows this is code for something absurd, but he hasn’t figured out what yet), Dean’s alone in the bunker. He powers through a couple of chores, hoping to waste the few hours until Cas and Jack come back, but is disappointed when it only takes him about 20 minutes to complete his list of to-dos.
Eileen skids onto the mark, spinning, knife out, ready to face Isabelle. She knows it’s useless.  She knows her next move is the stupidest decision she could possibly make.
Cas, exceedingly helpful at all things, says, “Well, I did die for you. I believe that’s rather romantic. I have read several romance novels and, also, Becky told me that it was — I believe ‘Peak Romance,’ is how she referred to it?” Oh, this is something we joke about now? Awesome. Dean is so fucked forever.
Safely ensconced in the kitchen, Dean starts putting his thoughts in order. It had been easier, Dean thinks, when it just wasn’t allowed. But Dean and Cas are dating. You’re allowed to think your partner is attractive, beautiful. You’re allowed to want to have sex with them.
Castiel steps forward. They are way too close, but Dean’s not backing down. His weight shifts slightly, and the backs of his calves brush against his bed. His bed. Woahkay — not thinking about his bed right now.
He parks Baby, strips her of his bags and belongings by rote, and slides the mixtape out of the tape deck into the walkman in his pocket. He stands for a few seconds because what the hell is he supposed to do?
That one is interesting. Sam, it made sense. He was sweet, and also a naturally curious person. He’s always interested in his own betterment, wanting to know more. Plus, sex is a hell of a motivator. Dean hadn’t struck her as someone who’d go out of his way, but he admitted that he’d spent time (and by his skill, a LOT of time) learning ASL just for Eileen.
The other thing he can do, apparently, is make breakfast, which he lets distract him until the girls, Jody, and Donna do so themselves. Then, he’s telling Jody that the dock is good to go, which immediately turns into demands that they test it out. After a brief detour of Alex and Patience arguing about whether or not Dean has summer colours (Alex says yes, Patience says colour matching in fashion magazines is a holdover from colorism and has inherently racist roots, but also that Dean should wear more purple to make his eyes pop), Dean (who didn’t bring a swimsuit, let alone a purple one) and Jody sit on the porch chairs they’ve dragged to the dock while Donna and Claire engage in complicated water warfare. Alex and Patience have reconciled by virtue of a common enemy in Kaia, who had mistakenly unveiled her lack of date night plans for her and Claire’s anniversary later this month, and is thus enduring increasingly more ludicrous suggestions while steadily trying to swim farther away.
Dean crying in his arms. Dean saying he didn’t need Cas. Dean kneeling in front of Cas. Dean saying he needed Cas.
Cas is taking phone calls from the bottom of the ocean. Jesus. Dean doesn’t stand a snowball’s chance in Hell.
That's the thing, isn’t it? Dean really can’t. Cas knows him. Cas has seen him at his worst. Beyond that, Cas has seen him at his
Dean slides into the car, pops the tape back into the deck, and lets Cas’s affection flow over him with Frank Sinatra’s voice. Maybe he can’t give Cas what he deserves, but Dean could give him this.
The night is loud, and long, and bright, and the crowd is screaming about skinny dipping in jeans. Dean thinks about Cas’s weird and wild mixtape, with songs from every genre and no fear about what that might say about him.
It’s abandoning Sam’s body in a vampire-infested tunnel. It’s leaving Sam’s body to drag civilians out of the forest.
They walk into the fence gate and Dean tenses, minutely shifting himself in front of Eileen with a movement that sets off every alarm bell in Eileen’s body. Her hand settles on her gun, and she pivots to face the threat.
People filter in — Cas and Eileen, then Jack and Patience. Dean treats Patience gently, and Patience favors him with soft smiles, which seem to put Dean at ease.
“Would you like it if a partner made you a mixtape?” And Dean was going to the cupboard to get the bleach for that stain on the counter and not looking at Castiel's eyes, not feeling Castiel's eyes on him, nope — he was busy cleaning their home. And Dean is a champion of ignoring and repressing and generally treating things like they’re not a big deal. So, he just shrugged it off.
Finally able to check out, she slides her sunglasses on and sits in the driver's seat of her car, ready to get on the road.
Dean takes these wants and tucks them carefully in the outer breast pocket of his flannel, visible and close to his heart all at once.
He thinks about what Sam had said about retiring, and he still doesn’t know exactly what that would be. Maybe a few more weekends like this. Just a couple. It couldn’t hurt.
She sets down the whispers that follow Dean like a bad omen. She doesn’t need anyone else's opinion of him — demons in awe, hunters afraid. She knows the opinions of the people she respects, and it’s not difficult to see what Dean is really about after spending a few minutes in his presence.
But they’re allowed now. He’s allowed to look at the muscles in Cas’s wrists, and the hollow of his throat, and the curl of his hair.
And he's going to do it. Just as soon as he figures a way to put the squirming warm feeling in his chest away every time he thinks about the fact that Cas made him a fucking mix tape.
“I’m not one hundred percent sure,” Dean says, and regrets not having served himself lasagna first, since he can’t even eat to stall. “Cas said that some of them have been reading the gospel?”
“I’m sure.” Dean thinks about sliding over to his desk, but Cas is very close, and he’s smiling, and Dean’s feet can’t really do that. It’s sort of absurdly hilarious. Cas, the rebel angel, and Dean. Dean could kiss him. He could do that.
Still, the point is that Dean adores Eileen, even though they don’t spend much time together. Eileen and Sam sometimes drag Cas and Dean out of the bunker whenever Jack has gone to spend time with Kelly in Heaven, or Rowena in Hell, or really anyone at a place that's not the bunker. One night, Eileen and Dean had invented shots with Donnie while Cas and Sam’s game of pool somehow ended up with the table on fire.
No. Cas doesn't think of it like that. Cas chose free will. He didn't choose Dean. He didn't fall for Dean. Hell, he didn't even fall. He's in his room doing God knows what because he's one hundred percent angeled up and probably doesn't need sleep. Maybe he chooses to sleep. He explained that he can choose to eat like humans now. Taste the food. He complimented the tomato soup Dean made when he figured out Cas's problem with tomatoes had been the texture.
Dean stares at Cas, forgetting not to make eye contact. Cas responds, because he always responds to Dean.
Because he knows it will drive Claire nuts, he then rolls down the window after he’s gotten Baby started up.
Then his hand tightened, and he couldn't stop himself from pulling Castiel a little closer, and Cas just went along so that Dean could put his other hand on Cas's cheek — and his hands weren't shaking, but God, something was trembling. Dean thought extremely stupidly that he could kiss Castiel right then, and Cas wouldn't stop him. Hell, Cas might even want him to — because Cas is in love with him, and sure, he doesn't want anything more, but a kiss is a kiss, right? But before he could lean forward, he saw Cas's tear-stained eyes enveloped in black goo and suddenly, he had something so much more important to say.
“Hey, anything to escape the Uno firing squad,” Dean says. “It’s hardly the worst thing this shirt has seen.” It’s a pretty old flannel, and he’s pretty sure it’s got a small stain from a gross incident with a skinwalker. The shirt’s been through way worse.
“I don’t know if I ever said it. But you, Sam — you gave me this. You saved our lives. You...hell, I don’t know if we’ll even know half of what you’ve done for us. But, you saved the world, Dean. And now me and my girls get to live in it.”
“He’s —” Cas finds his presence reaching out to Dean on instinct, rushing to the field. Dean is asleep in his car, having a nightmare. “— out.”
Within ten minutes, Dean swings by his room for a go-bag, pops into Jack’s room to say goodbye, and settles into Baby. He’s ten miles away when he takes his first free breath in days.
“Jack. You're okay.” He sucks in a breath to clear the pebbles in his throat. “You're safe, and I'm not going anywhere unless you want me to. You're home and you're safe and you're good.” Yeah, okay, Dean knows he's babbling, but you try holding a lap full of crying cosmic entity and think of something smart to say.
A/N: Non wanted to leave you guys at the cliffhanger of Sam getting the emergency text last week - you're welcome for not letting her do that -Yar
Eileen’s turning useless circles at the dump site when her phone buzzes. Sam’s heading out for the lunar ceremony, telling her to stay safe and thanking her for letting Dean come along on the hunt. Eileen’s not sure what to do with that thank you. It’s not like she was going to say no, not when Dean had explicitly asked to come along. She ignores that part of the text and tells Sam to have fun (but not too much fun) at the ceremony. Then, she figures some honesty might be good and shoots him an “I miss you.” before she can psych herself out of it.
Five seconds ago, they were talking. Dean could swear it was important. It must have been for Cas to come to his room so late at night.
He’s not unhappy, is the thing. He’s pretty thrilled that the hunt went so well. He’s extremely glad that Eileen didn’t get hurt.
In my defense, heightening the suspense only increases the ultimate hilarity :P Also, apologies for the delay in posting! We are officially shifting to Saturday posts for the rest of Mix 3, as weekends are very helpful for revising. Enjoy! - Non
Kaia’s face hardens, and Claire bristles, pulling on her spikiest voice. “He, actually.” Like she’s expecting Cassie to suddenly manifest a Bible and faint. Cassie, who’d once yelled at the grocery store clerk who’d implied that the two of them shouldn’t date because it wasn’t natural. Cassie, who is the only person Dean ever told about what Lee really meant to him. Cassie, whose only problem with Dean was that he’d lie and he’d leave, and not any of the other million horrible ugly things that Dean carried in his chest.
It’s not like anyone would know, but he finds himself pocketing his phone anyway. He hums the song to himself to coax more lyrics out of his mind.
Jack’s powers as a nephilim had been vast and uncharted. His powers now blew those out of the water. Cas wonders how he didn’t anticipate that Jack would be able to see human souls. Most angels can. It’s a matter of tuning to the right frequencies — not a thing one needs to do frequently, although Cas confesses he often watches the ebb and rise of Dean’s spirit. Sam’s soul is beautiful, but inhabited in his body the way a soul is meant to. Dean’s soul flows out of him freely, constantly spilling out on the ground around him, overfull and pulsing with care. It often reaches out to people who pass too close. It flares and brightens when he looks at Sam, or his car, or strangers, or coffee, or birds, or leaves, or anything that Dean determines is important and worthy of love, which seems to be everything in the world but himself.
Dean would have loved Jess if she ever got a chance to meet him, but that’s a distant pain now. Sam thinks about Dean’s quiet support, his approval, how freely he gives Sam his love. He thinks about Eileen’s sharp wit, and her instinct, and her kindness. It’ll be nice for Eileen and Dean to get closer. It’s nice that Dean is trying to get closer to her.
This has the benefit of stopping the music immediately, and provides a satisfying crunching noise as the headphones shatter into the wall in the hallway.
She can’t really shake that feeling of distrust regardless. Sam and Cas, despite how lovely they are, aren’t women, aren’t Deaf, aren’t Eileen. It’s not that she doesn’t trust their judgment. It’s that they might not have the ability to see what Eileen does. She’s been burned by people she thought would be safe before. Sam wouldn’t stand for it, but that’s only if he understands that it’s happening.
Liliana had been a terrible parent in some ways, but she’d been very accepting of who Eileen was. She didn’t care much one way or the other, so long as it didn’t interfere with hunting.
He wonders sometimes, if he’d put the bullet in Chuck’s head, if his next shot wouldn’t have been his own gray matter.
Softly, because they’re close enough that Dean can hear the gentle movement of his breath, Cas says, “You’re a good man, Dean.” And Dean falls back on the only defense he has. He shuts his eyes.
“Sam,” he chokes out, but it’s weak, barely scraping past his desperate bid for oxygen. “Sammy.” He tries again. Dean feels the hook claw through his shoulder, pulling him up and open and onto the rack. He feels his knees buckle, hitting the garage floor with shocking pain. It rattles.
The tiniest haze of vulnerability hovers over Dean throughout the conversation. It wouldn’t be noticeable at all, but for the slightest hesitation in his hands — the extra care he takes in forming the words, the insanely casual posture completely at odds with his fingers’s careful consideration.
Dean knows he’ll never deserve the way that Cas so clearly feels about him, but maybe, if he’s really good and really clever, he can stop Cas from realising that, too.
“Uh, yeah.” The table doesn’t respond, so after a few seconds Dean continues just to kill the silence. “How did you think they got there? It’s not like we have a delivery address for our
Dean loves her for it, fiercely. It’s not just Sam, either. Cas and Eileen have a lot of fun together, and Dean likes to watch the speed of their conversations, even though he doesn’t have a chance in Hell of knowing what they’re talking about. Jack adores her, especially after she offered to teach him how to throw knives.
Her pleased, “I win,” prompts screams for a rematch. Dean, whose loyalty has come under fire, is banned from participating, which suits him just fine. Ferrying plates to the kitchen, he grabs drinks for the adults, a juicebox for Jack — who asked for one — and a juicebox for Claire — who retaliates with a scowl.
Cassie doesn’t bring up any of that, complaining instead about being jet lagged after flying in from DC for an article. Dean angles his body so that he can better drink Cassie in. Across the table, Claire narrows her eyes. The hangover is clearly hitting Claire harder than she expected.
Dean can’t really imagine it, but he could understand it. If Cas wanted his body. If it was Cas’s rough hands holding him down, if Cas was just chasing some kind of release, and Dean was a convenient body.
Eileen closes her eyes. She anchors herself to the ground, letting her limbs sink with the heavy knowledge that a hit is coming.
And then Jack is saying “Chocolate chips!” and everyone says “No!” because Jack really, truly shouldn't have that much sugar early in the morning, and the morning eases into business as usual. Dean makes a batch of chocolate chip pancakes anyway, since Sam sets them out. They're equally weak in the face of Jack's pout.
“I just wanted to see if Jack was with you,” Alex rebutts. Alex and Jack have built a peculiar friendship. Dean couldn’t even pretend to guess what it involves. He tries not to think about it too closely, since he’s less likely to be held culpable that way.
Eileen taps his arm every now and then until Sam hands her a caramel, but mostly they drive in comfortable silence.
His hands feel wrong, and the panic is crushing his chest, and when he looks down, he figures out why. It's not his gun. It’s the fucking walkman. It sits heavy in his grip as his hands curl around it like he's going to fire notes off into his pillow.
The thing is, she knows all this stuff about Dean — Sam never shuts up about the guy — but she doesn’t really know
Dean thinks about Cas dying on the floor of a farm saying, “I love you. I love all of you.” Cas constantly growing and changing. Cas using his love as a shield. Cas using his love as a weapon. Cas summoning the Empty.
Dean, who normally, desperately, needs to see something to believe it, finds that it doesn’t bother him as much as it should. He doesn’t need to know all of Cas. He doesn’t need to possess Cas’s every secret, know his every thought. He knows enough.
Dean resists the urge to check the thermostat, because he knows what’s causing the prickly heat behind his ears, and it’s sitting on his fucking bed talking about making him happy. Dean’s only saving grace is that Cas seems very interested in his headphones (Does Cas have a walkman? Should Dean get Cas a walkman?) and not looking at Dean.
Claire and Kaia sometimes drive in if they’re in the area for a hunt, but Alex and Patience usually come by way of Angel Express. Long distance friendships are probably easier when one of you has the ability to teleport anywhere at will.
Exactly an hour after sitting down, he excuses himself on the basis of a long drive and a longer night, ignoring the way Sam’s eyebrows furrow with a look asking, “You okay?” Dean offers a shrug and gives Sammy a smile that should communicate, “Fine, just tired.” He ruffles Jack’s hair and leaves with a muttered ‘goodnight’ like it’s not five in the fucking afternoon.
“I’m here.” Cas says, sliding around like he could draw Dean’s eyes towards him. Dean doesn’t want Cas to see, doesn’t want to see his own reflection in Cas’s crystal clear blues. When Cas shifts, with his right hand still curled around Dean’s left shoulder, Dean collapses, half into Cas, half into Baby. He lets Cas guide them down, buries himself in Cas’s chest.
Dean's almost distracted when the next song starts. He thinks it's another instrumental at first. It starts with an overture, but Dean's ready when the lyrics start, because now he gets what Cas is doing, just — pulling out moments from their lives and putting music to them.
Sam makes a face. Dean, drunk, had once catalogued Sam’s expressions in surprising depth, numbering the “bitchfaces,” as he called them. Cas isn’t sure what this one is. Sam’s expression has scrunched in on itself. It’s not unlike a kitten tasting a lemon for the first time.
He pushes the lasagna forward towards the girls. “You know you’re warded, right? Like, the angels don’t know where you are, unless you tell them.” Cas had warded Claire when she was 6 and he had discovered that the angels were not always the good guys. Jack had warded the others as part of a game of Sardines, which is another game that had been banned from the bunker.
Eileen isn’t always at the bunker, but her effect is instantaneous when she is. It’s like she de-ages Sam by 10 years. He’s lighter, quicker to smile, and he follows her around like a puppy who just discovered what treats are. It’s embarrassing.

Maybe she should talk to Cas about that — what it is like to be in love with someone, and know you’ll never be their first priority?
“It’s just — I get why you didn’t want me hunting. I even get why dad wanted me to try to shut down my powers at the beginning. Hunting is…nuts. It’s crazy, and it’s so dangerous, and it’s not really the life I would have chosen for myself, I don’t think.”
Cas is different from him. Insanely different from him. Incomprehensibly different from him. Sometimes, it’s like they come to the same conclusions from totally different sets of data. Other times, they have the same data and come to totally different conclusions.
Fuck it. ‘Hey, I’m close to Tulsa and looking for something less boring than cataloging subbasement library E.’ Conveniently true. ‘Want a hunting buddy? -D.W.’
Cas actually stumbles in response, like his legs forgot how to stay standing, and Dean’s a very simple man, okay? That shit goes straight to his ego.
He had. He would again. Dean examines Eileen again in his head, holds her up in the rotation of their peculiar family, and realises she’s someone his violence has only ever saved.
before he identifies the bend of Jack's back and realizes the kid is slumped over, cheek first, onto the library table.
“Cas —” He can’t even be embarrassed by the want jammed into that single syllable. Cas takes advantage of Dean’s failure to string together sentences to rub his thumb over Dean’s mouth. His eyes are absurdly affectionate.
If someone so much as looks at Claire or Kaia wrong, he’s going to rip them apart with his bare hands.
drags a ragged “fuck” out of him, sending him and the Impala careening for the relative safety of the pull-off lane.
Not Eileen, obviously. But — Cas. Cas, who said that Dean and he shared “a more profound bond.” Cas, who sat at their library table and talked casually about moving mountains if that would help Dean be happy. Cas, who saved Dean at the outset of their story, then again at its end, like two bookends of a love so huge it altered the very nature of the narrative.
Dean has watched Cas face off against Gods, Demons, Leviathans, and the like without a stumble or a stutter. Here, looking at Dean, Cas is flustered.
He wonders if Cas gets distracted by himself in the mirror, getting dressed. No, wait. Don’t think about Cas getting undressed. Uh, dressed.
Dean responds with the sign “Brother.” Of course. Of course that was Dean’s first concern. Because Eileen is stupid enough to cheat on her partner in front of his brother. In front of his
He thinks about Patience and what Patience couldn’t make herself say. If he wasn’t bad, then why couldn’t his father accept him? Why didn’t his father love him?
Dean is cursing the singer for the audacity to sing so plainly, so clearly, and to make Dean listen with his own ears.
Dean toys with the idea of googling the lyrics on his phone as he hunts for googly eyes, but that feels like cheating.
“Wait. When did you talk to Becky?” Hold on, no, that wasn’t the important thing. How did this conversation become about Becky?
A black mutt bounds forward, wagging its tail and charging straight into Dean. Eileen expels delighted nonsense before moving past Dean to get her hands on soft fur. The dog is extremely friendly, and clearly beyond thrilled to be pet, flipping over on its back to receive both scratches and the full force of Eileen’s attention. She feels Dean relax over her shoulder and shoots him a laughing look. Clearly, this was the big scary threat Dean sensed.
Maybe, if Dean gives Cas this — if he can make Cas happy, and if he can figure out how Cas started to think that Dean was worth all of this in the first place — maybe he can keep this one thing.
He isn’t interested in being the target of Dean’s anger when he doesn’t deserve it, but that doesn’t mean he wants to cordon off Dean’s ability to be angry around him. Dean’s anger is a beautiful, incendiary thing. Dean’s anger pushes him from dark corners into the light. Dean’s anger is the part of him that stands up to defy injustice and pain. Dean’s anger may be the only part of Dean who thinks he deserves better.
Eileen doesn’t even know how to begin her response. Affront at the accusation that she would cheat? Explain what being in an open relationship actually means? Point out the hypocrisy of Dean flirting with the waitress when he’s also in a relationship, but apparently she can't engage in the same?
Then Dean had yelled at him, berated him for coming, acted like Cas could possibly leave him in such distress.
Cas bit back the instinctive desire to fly into Dean’s room and haul him out of it. He knew it wouldn’t help, so he focused on what would. Cas remembered Dean’s grief as Jack was dying, the way he couldn’t — after everything — pull the trigger on the gun, despite Chuck’s insistence. A lot of baggage was settled there, but a lot of love rested beside it. However, Jack had specifically asked how Cas could know, if Dean wasn’t saying it. That, at least, Cas could answer.
This brings Dean back to his first issue: why did Cas leave Dean a mixtape on his bedside table? When did Cas do it? Weren’t the angel race finals last night? Why didn’t he wake Dean? What the hell is up with the flowers? He could have woken Dean up. Dean would have — nope, actually back up. Dean moves back one thought.
Cas. Cas smiling down at Dean, leaning over to push their soft lips together, smiling at Dean and saying ‘I love you,’ not because he has to, not because he’s out of time, but because he wants to. Filling Dean with the searing light of his grace until there isn’t anything dark left in him.
The song comes to an end, and Dean rewinds it. Why the fuck not? It’s fun. The bass line is enjoyable, and Dean isn’t particularly worried about the lyrics. Even if he wanted to rip them apart, he doesn’t speak Korean.
But that was long ago, buried beneath another hundred years of mistakes. That’s sort of the point. He liked boys before Hell, and he liked men after. He likes sex, touch, comfort. That’s nothing new.
Over the next few days, Cas flew the length of the earth with his brethren, watching them twist and soar. Jack lost, good-naturedly, in the third round. Michael outpaced most of the angels easily, but Indra put up a surprising fight, surpassing Michael at the last second in the quarterfinals. He left Adam howling with laughter, telling Michael that he’d be in better shape if he stopped teleporting everywhere.
Dean thinks about Cas’s easy patience, his love and his low low expectations of Dean. It’s a beautiful song — a little girly for Dean’s taste — but it's sweet. The bit about holding hands is —
Unseen to Sam, Cas unfurls all of his wings. They rest in a completely different plane of existence, but something about this thought experiment is making them feel cooped up.
“No, Jack. You don't have to apologize.” And then, before he can lose his nerve, he bundles the kid into a hug. Maybe it's a bit too violent and a bit too quick, but it's functional. “I'm the one that's sorry.”
In the morning, his shoulder wakes him with a heavy twinge to let him know that it objects to the motel bed mattress, but he consoles himself with the knowledge that Claire is going to be having a much much worse morning.
Sam signs “Shower” and “Together,” throwing in a few suggestive eyebrows that have Eileen shoving his shoulder with laughter. She taught him that exact phrase this morning.
Dean’s been carefully encouraging Sam’s growing interest in magic. It’s hard for Sam not to be curious after it’s saved their skins so many times, particularly after everything Rowena taught him. Still, there’s a big difference between wanting to know practical reversal or dispersal spells, strengthening wards, anti-scrying charms — Sam can argue the obvious utility of those — and wanting to socialize with other practitioners.
Dean and Eileen stumble back to their motel rooms a few hours later. He high fives her sloppily as they part. Somewhere between punchdrunk, actually drunk, and tired, they laugh as they attempt improved hand-eye coordination a second and a third time. Eileen had gone on a mini-rant at the diner about Dean ruining food for her, so he’s feeling light.
8 listens in, it’s just Dean and Baby and the chorus that Dean is trying to pull apart. 10 listens in,
He wants to build a sconce — one of those sturdy, wrought iron ones you see on the walls of fortified castles. Better yet, he wants to invent electricity. He wants a version of himself where light isn’t a fight to maintain. Dean’s not sure he deserves it, and it seems impossible to achieve, but here — in a motel room that could be any motel room anywhere in the country — Dean allows himself to want it. Just for a moment.
Dean’s in the grocery aisle buying tomatoes before he even lets himself think about that. He’s pulling the lyrics apart in his mind, but he’s not getting any closer to an answer.
Dean’s hands shoot to Cas’s belt because he’s not stupid, but Cas brings a tender hand to Dean’s cheek. Dean is closing his eyes and leaning into Cas’s palm before he consciously decides to do so. The kiss Cas guides Dean into is soft and holy, and Dean feels a surprising heat behind his eyelids.
No, Jack had simply...appeared in the bunker as Sammy and Dean were coming back from some shitty hunt that Dean can't even remember right now because the coffee is
The next day at breakfast, Cas had observed Dean and Jack together with a sharp eye. Bustling around the kitchen, Dean had leaned in to ruffle Jack’s hair, and Jack had smiled wide. It might take some time, but Cas knew that they’d be okay.
me to save you. I thought you were dying.” Cas draws himself to his full height, giving the impression of looming over Dean somehow, despite being shorter. “Perhaps next time I’ll just ignore you.”
“Dean.” Cas says, and his voice is pure frustration. “I am relating my own experience with humanity whenever I believe it might help. You are the person through whom I came to love humanity. You are still, in my opinion, one of the best men I have ever known.” Castiel says this in an aggrieved tone, like that could diminish the impact of the sentences’ content somehow.
Dean slams his fist in again. The divider cracks. The ragged plastic rips skin from his knuckles as his hand pushes through at the unexpected give.
There’s something almost manic in it, Sam decides. Dean’s not excited about the meal. He’s not showing off. He’s just cooking. There’s a desperate edge to his movement, like he wants the act to make him happy, and if it doesn’t, he’ll compel it to.
Dean knows this is an objectively insane thing to say, because things happen, and Dean remembers holding his gun up to Jack's face with cinematic clarity.
So, Eileen. Think about Eileen. Not the music. Not the hellhound. Just, Eileen — how happy she makes Sam. The way she looks at Sam and really sees him. How she retained her sense of humour despite everything. The way she treats Dean like a friend, not an interloper. Her impeccable taste in diner food.
so Dean faces the whiplash that comes from confronting both “Castiel is in love with me” and “Castiel wants to bend me over the kitchen counter and RAIL ME,” not only between songs, but also between verses. The song slides into a loving croon for the chorus, and Dean is again perusing mental images of what it might be like to have Castiel's fingers in his mouth. Dean grips his beer bottle so tightly that the paper label slides off.
Cas takes a moment to answer, moving as he is to stand. “Dean?” he questions, reaching out with a gentle hand. Dean wants to lean into it so badly, to collapse, to be nothing again. He feels himself slap it away.
“I could go.” Dean starts, and then realizes there’s no way that Kaia could want that. Whatever else Claire and Kaia deal with, Dean knows he’s one of the scarier monsters.
“Where else would I be?” Cas finds himself snipping back. It’s not as though he doesn’t tell Dean his plans for the days: when he’s going to be in Heaven, when he’s taking Jack. It’s a thing he’s not obligated to do, but Dean gets testy when he doesn’t know where Cas or Sam or Jack are going to be.
Kaia shoots him a look that reminds Dean that, despite everything else, she is basically a teenage girl, and Dean is an ancient husk of a man.
Dean’s brain/mouth filter is a little fucked right now. Cas is fiddling with his shirt sleeve, exposing acres of pale flesh. Dean’s never wanted to kiss the inside of someone’s elbow before. He’s not dealing well.
Frank Sinatra’s The Way You Look Tonight is cheesy as all hell, but at least Dean gets it. Dean’s not a lot of things, sure — but he is Pretty. Being pretty isn’t normally thrown to him as a compliment, but Dean knows Cas would mean it as one.
Dean blinks at the spot where Zadkiel was for several moments. His eyes snap up to Castiel, because what the Hell has Cas been saying to these angels?
Dean slides the tape into the deck, lets his fingers linger on the buttons, and smiles to himself. At least this time he knows what to expect.
of who I am. I shouldn’t have to…I shouldn’t have to pretend it’s not, just to have my father in my life.”
Dean doesn’t rewind the song even once. Dean hears Famine's voice jeering, "That’s one deep, dark nothing you got there," and feels every stretch of the emptiness between his ribs.
“No. That would be reductive. I love you —” How does he say that so easily? “— because I am me, and you are you. I could no sooner stop loving you than you could stop being Dean Winchester.”
Dean is just a man, so he has no idea how to respond to Cas looking at him and saying anything, let alone Castiel casting him as Sailor Venus, Love Warrior. Dean knows he’s taken some extreme measures for his brother, but it’s only because he knew about them.
“Didn’t know I was sneaking anywhere,” she rebutts, but it's without malice. She’s smiling casually, like Dean putting the gun in his belt makes him somehow less deadly. “The girls and I made some lunch — figured I’d bring you some before they destroy it.”
“I’m not certain I believed, entirely, in love or in free will until that moment. You loved your brother so much, so completely, that you were able to reach him when he should have been completely gone. It wasn’t a grand gesture, it wasn’t a weapon or rage. You simply loved him enough that you would not abandon him. That love saved the world.”
Dean blinks. “Is there some reason I shouldn’t be?” When Sam doesn’t say anything, Dean continues glibly. “You gonna ritually murder someone? Make a demon deal? Forget to wear a condom to the orgy?”
Okay, so sometimes Dean hears the echo of Sam’s voice spitting, “You’re certainly willing to do the sacrificing, as long as you’re not the one being hurt.” Sam claiming Dean was too weak. Sam begging Dean to be a better man, to help him with Jack. Sam in pain, Sam possessed, Sam suffering.
Dean’s not sure how he didn’t realize he was bisexual, because boy does he seem to want it both ways. He wants not to hunt, and he wants to hunt. He wants Cas to forgive him, and he doesn’t want Cas to forgive him. He wants to be at peace, and he wants to keep fighting.
Not that there is anything to blame Sam for. Because nothing is wrong. Dean is fine. Cas is fine. And he's here. Which is amazing. Jack is here, too, which Dean never would have thought possible.
It’s not far, but Aswangs are fast. She needs whatever lead she can get. Conveniently, Isabelle’s absurd McMansion backs up to a small forest, so Eileen tears out of the house and sprints. She can’t hear if the Aswang is behind her. She doesn’t know if she has a few feet or a few meters. She can’t afford to look, so she runs.
“Uh no, not exactly. He’s, uhm.” Ha. See, not so fucking easy, is it, Claire? “He’s my bio-dad, but he didn’t come into my life until I was about 16. I’d met him, like, once or twice as a kid, but he didn’t realise I was his, uh...that I was his responsibility, I guess. After my mom died, he, like, suddenly showed up and wanted to ‘do right by me’ or whatever. It was…” Claire looks upset.
Cas is still looking at him, but he doesn’t look like he’s waiting for Dean to speak. He’s just sort of looking. Dean leans against the desk and explains.
, but he can’t work up more confusion, since the song continues on with more professions that the singer is not. Dean looks down at the papers in his fist as the singer says
He fast forwards to the end of the song. It ends with a long instrumental that swells and crashes, and Dean drags in a ragged breath, officially putting “The First Day of Spring” by Noah and The Whale into the box of things that he doesn't think about.
“We had lost,” Cas continues firmly. “The plan had completely failed. And I told you that Sam was going to die. Do you remember what you said?”
What would it be like, knowing they’re still out there, knowing that she has no way to hear them coming? Dean imagines knowing that it could happen again, knowing you’d be just as defenseless.
Dean rewinds the tape. Dean keeps rewinding the tape. In the blink of an eye, it's 10:04 PM and Dean knows every word to Cowboy Like Me. It's seared into his ribcage, scrawled right underneath the Enochian sigils Cas had burned himself.
He realises that having your ex look you up every few years, especially after big events, is probably something similar to stalking. Still, he’d loved Cassie. He wanted her to be happy. With the way his life is, he can’t not check that she’s okay. Sometimes, when he was feeling particularly dark, the fact that she was out there alive and happy, that Lisa and Ben were out there alive and happy, reminded him that there were things in this life worth fighting for. People who get to enjoy the world that they were fighting for.
Dean ferreted a few things away, so Sam will probably keep finding items with eyes on them for weeks.
Before Cas and Jack came back, they lived on take out and shelf stable goods. Dean cooked before Cas and Jack left, but not every day. Dean enjoys sleeping in every now and then. He isn’t always in the mood to cook, and he likes to try take out and eat greasy. Since Cas and Jack returned though, if Dean’s in the bunker, he’s in the kitchen. He’s up every morning, sometimes even before Sam.
“He likes bees.” The words barely make it past his lips, but Dean throws them out anyway, because that seems safe, and also is definitely not a trait that any of his exes had. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he hears
Cas pulled up short in surprise as he traversed the finish line, startled at his own wild joy. When Indra barrelled over behind him, they collided into each other, Cas tugging Indra higher, laughing all the while. Soon, Indra was laughing along as they played a strange game of tag in their flight towards Heaven. Cas complimented his brother’s flying, Indra flush and happy with the compliment.
Dad had done his best in an impossible circumstance, Dean amends. Sam turned out amazing. It was fine. This isn’t about Dean.
Things had been a little better after that. Dean was still quietly miserable, but he wasn’t taking stupid risks. Plus, he hid it less. He still refused to talk about Jack or Cas, but at least for a while, they’d been miserable together.
Dean’s sure Sam is way better at it than him, but he figures he knows enough to make things a little easier on Eileen.
So, Dean wants to join her hunt. That’s fine. Dean has a reputation of being an excellent hunter. She’s been on hunts with Dean before.
“I told you that the only thing you would see is Michael killing your brother, and you told me that you would not let him die alone.” That seems right. Still rings true. He’s still not sure if his plan that day was to try and save Sam or just to die with him, but he’d known that no matter what, if he could be there, he would.
The goon on the other side of the phone seems to accept Dean’s aggrieved and distracted insistence that his agents have jurisdiction. Dean doesn’t even know who he’s repping for until Mackey shoots him a thankful text 10 minutes later.
“Don’t leave me.” Dean still had a reason to live, and it was right in front of him. Sam didn’t want to do this without him.
The last three verses are the clearest. Well, clearest in that Dean’s able to pick up the lyrics, at least, but he has no idea what they mean.
Dean’s fist smashes into the fridge door, a bat out of Hell. He draws in air, raggedly. He punches it again, relishing his ability to move his hand.
Little goals: be able to withstand Cas’s tender touches with the same stoicism he’s able to weather punches.
“Uhm. Thank you?” Sam says, his tone questioning. Cas plods on anyway. Sam has been the object of Dean’s love for as long as he has existed. A different love, yes, but still, Sam is perhaps the one person who can help Cas find a way to respond.
About 12 feet in front of her lies the crumpled heap of Isabelle’s corpse. Farther back, Dean jogs towards her.
The dock, unfortunately, doesn’t provide many hours of work. Dean nails in the final boards, and then stains and treats the wood. He can’t do a second coat today anyway, so he finishes after 4 hours. It’s 7:30 PM, and Dean is standing in the encroaching darkness looking for something to do.
Eileen notices the wink, giving Dean curious eyebrows. He gestures over to Cas, putting down his mug to sign “Angel,” “Race,” “Champion.” Then, because Cas isn’t looking at him but Eileen is, he finger spells “Badass.”
Whenever Sam found them a case, Dean dragged on new skin. For a few days, Sam would have a piece of a  brother again, just not all of one. Sam watched Dean like a hawk — he wasn’t dumb. Dean was just waiting to die, hoping the monster of the week would save him the guilt of doing it himself. Dean’s own life stopped factoring into the equation of his decisions.
The waiter slides him his plate, and he picks at his fries listlessly. People usually miss that he has killer hands. Plus, it’s not like he starts these engagements with his shirt off, so it’s easy to hide the effects the life has had on him until people are too distracted to ask any questions. The anti-possession tattoo, the spear’s leftover kiss, and less and less often Cas’s fading hand print garner some attention — but they’re easy to distract from. He knows he actually has Cas to thank for the fact that there is any unmarred skin on his body at all, so why shouldn’t Cas get to appreciate it?
Dean gets into a rhythm of work. Of course, since he’s into a rhythm, he’s inevitably too distracted to restart the music. The next song is slow and instrumental and the lyrics take a few seconds to start.
“It’s a bit chilly out there,” his mouth supplies. He commits and continues, “I know you’re a big witch now, but you sure you’re ready for such a
They’d talked a little about the idea. Max and Sam. It’s not like an induction or anything. Apparently, unattached practitioners come all the time. Non-witches, too. Alicia goes every year. It’s basically a weekend retreat for people who either do magic or are cool with it. A chance to unwind, to be yourself, unafraid someone’s gonna panic about rabbit bones or lamb's blood.
“Only the best for you, boss,” he replies, smirking despite awkwardly balancing a Barrett on his shoulder.
Dean wrings out the sponge, getting back to work on Baby. It’s a pretty song. A nice lie. Dean’s never caught Castiel. Not once. Not when he crashed to earth, powerless and alone. Not when he was possessed. Not when the Michael lance almost took him. Not when he was desperate for purpose. Not when Lucifer killed him. Not when the Empty swallowed him whole.
Dean honestly has a bit of a spring in his step as he puts the haul in the back of his car, which is how he should have known it wouldn't last.
even though Dean himself only ever got to see parts of it. Cas'll like it. He rewinds to Hymnals and lets the two songs carry him to town, laughter at the edge of his mouth like a smile.
X Ambassador starts up again. This time, the feeling bubbles into a boil. Dean feels his hand clench around the walkman, blinking against the water in his eyes.
“What are you doing here?” His voice is sandpaper — tire tracks in a field of wildflowers, black ooze in a proclamation of love. Something horrible where something beautiful should be.
Castiel made him a mixtape. Castiel made him a mixtape and smiled at him happily and said, “This is for you,” and tossed it to him like he didn't just drop a live grenade into Dean's lap.
The second is also from Dean, and says the same. So does the third text that arrives as she’s staring down at the screen in confusion.
Dean grips the walkman tightly, like it weighs tons rather than pounds in his grip. He still has a use.
Cas had sat with Dean a few nights ago, before the final race. They were ostensibly watching an episode of some cowboy show, but were more accurately talking about nothing and everything while the TV glowed softly in the background. Dean found the angelic shenanigans beyond hilarious. They had started arguing 5 minutes into the cowboy program about whether or not Annie Oakley was a better shot than Dean (Dean insisted yes, because she was a badass, but Cas couldn’t see how that was possible given Dean’s accuracy and speed). This had spiraled into a discussion regarding potatoes, of all things. Somewhere along the way, Cas had recounted Michael’s loss in the tournament, and Dean had laughed so hard he slid out of his chair.
The girls are eager to get started on their hike, dragging Jody back to the cabin to wrangle Donna so that they have a chance of leaving before the sun goes down. Dean stuffs the last half of the sandwich in his mouth, giving them a toothy and open-mouthed goodbye grin — successfully pulling an audible laugh from Claire and another eye roll from Alex — before he retreats back to work on the dock.
Grabbing his walkman, Dean snaps the headphones on and hits play. When that doesn’t immediately quiet his mind, he turns up the volume and heads to the garage.
Dean is an unknown quantity to her. Eileen doesn’t need to have all the answers; she just wants the answers she has to
It's just a cool lyric, and the image of Cas exploding into particles is a memory he's tread on so many times it isn't even painful anymore. Even
. Plus, half the shit Sam says has to be either made up or heavily exaggerated. Like, no way in hell did John have Dean shooting with any kind of accuracy in elementary school, and John definitely wasn’t taking him on hunts. Lilianna had been adamant about training Eileen as a hunter, to carry on her legacy, but even Lilianna had waited until Eileen was 14 before bringing her even remotely close to the real thing. Sam probably misremembers the timing a bit. Or maybe Eileen had misread it. Sam’s not usually prone to inaccuracies, but Eileen figures things are probably different when it’s your older brother.
It’s not perfect. Dean still wakes up to nightmares more nights than not. Sometimes, Cas will smile in a particular way and Dean will see black goo. Sometimes, Dean’s anger punches out of him like a bullet from a gun. But it’s good. There is a comfortable routine to their chaos at the bunker.
The venue is packed. Dean’s superior height and Claire’s reflective blonde hair are the only reason he hasn’t lost them completely. People press in on all sides, and in one spectacularly stupid moment that Dean thought he saw someone’s eyes flash yellow, he almost pulled out his gun.
Dean feels his frown deepen. Patience lets out a sigh. “I like my life, Dean. I don’t feel trapped in it. I actually feel freed by it.”
Sam has his eyes lowered, his shoulders hunkered in like anything could make him not look like the 6’4” behemoth that he is. It works better than it should. Dean readies himself for a lecture. He slides the headphones off his ears and onto the desk. Distantly, he can hear a tiny voice saying
It’s hard sometimes, to reconcile the Dean she heard whispers about with the Dean that Sam and Cas talk about with the Dean that’s right in front of her, flirting innocently with a waitress half his age. There are many different Dean’s, and Eileen respects that. She’s just not sure she likes all of them.
Cas’s hand settles at his side as he stares Dean down, like he could will himself to see through to the horizon beyond. Dean, stupid broken Dean, tries again to take it back. Tries again to be better.
The song is sweet — a cute sentiment. Except for how Dean knows it's not sentiment. Castiel is being 100 percent literal. Dean is gonna die someday, and Cas is just going to follow him wherever he goes.
It’d been quiet for the last few days. Dean had enjoyed the two mixtapes and a quick salt and burn with Sam. Cas and Jack had been excited about the races happening in Heaven, as if that wasn’t a trip and a half to consider, so they’d been flitting in and out of the bunker, same as usual.
They lasted a half dozen months. Longer than Dean would have expected. No surprise that he’s too much, too broken, too angry, too jagged. Even for someone like Cas.
The tape ticks on. Leave it all Behind does nothing for the feeling behind his ribs, the shoelaces and plastic bags that now make up his insides. Gun in My Hand though — that reminds him of the Barrett’s weight, of watching the Aswang barrel towards Eileen as she held herself still and silent and trusting. Eileen put her faith in Dean’s bullet, in Dean’s gun, in the belief that he would deliver a kill for her.
It’s strange. Dean doesn’t seem to like fingerspelling much, preferring to talk around words he doesn’t know. He uses Brother for Sam and Angel Champion for Cas.
Dean wipes his hands and moves to the back of the Impala. He rewinds the song — he deserves the reminder — and draws the papers from where he has them holstered in his pocket.
Then, the strangest thing happened when Cas passed the finish line a full 3 seconds in front of Indra. Unprompted, he found himself laughing.
She can be herself with Sam because he understands her. She can be herself with Cas because he speaks her language. They somehow became her closest friends in the universe.
it’s “I left, but you didn’t stop me.” It’s Dean, knowing Cas is in the Empty, sending out useless prayers, promising to find a way to bring him back even when he couldn’t, when he didn’t.
Sam opens his mouth to say something to Cas, but they’re all interrupted by a flurry of wings. Jack explodes into the library, already talking a mile a minute.
“Look,” Sam begins, and this expression Cas knows well — it’s earnest implorement. Sam wears it when he really needs someone to believe what he’s saying. Jack wears it when he really wants something that Cas has already denied him. “Dean is complicated. He…I don’t think there is anything he wouldn’t suffer through to protect us. Don’t…” Sam actually looks somewhat pained. Cas runs through the whole conversation rapidly five times and realises that Sam has somehow taken Cas’s comment as an insult. He is trying to defend Dean.
Dean is nearly 40, with a job he's getting too old for, a kid brother he's too dumb for, and a body that's too broken for anything but cutting off heads.
Making chili occupies his hands and his mind for about 20 minutes, and then it just needs to wait and not boil over.
“Look. The mixtapes are great. I mean, they’re kinda weird as hell, and I have no idea what you’re saying half the time, and man, you really have to let me teach you how to equalise volume before you make me another — uh, not that you should make me another. I just—” Dean could swear he had a point when he opened his stupid mouth. “They’re nice.”
There’s something so tragic there that Eileen doesn’t look at it head on. Instead, she launches into an abridged explanation of different sexualities, teaching Dean the sign for each as her fries go cold.
However, with the last two mixtapes, Cas had actually given them to Dean. Like, Cas had physically put them in his hands. Dean had been prepared for them, in so much as one could be prepared for some of the shit that Cas says. He’d at least been wearing clothes. He’d at least had coffee.
No one is around, so Dean just gives up the ghost and puts his face in his hands. Jesus, he used to be better at this.

Normally, inactivity sits poorly on Dean. For once though, he’s so completely shocked by the lack of anything looming over him that he can’t even be upset about being useless. For once, he’s not useless. There’s just actually nothing to do.
Dean knows he's useless at talking, but my god, not saying anything at all is better than all the stuff he does say half the time.
It’s more than enough. Alex, newly aware that Dean is doing the work, lavishes him with compliments, which is nearly enough to ease the sting of how disastrously he’s doing in Uno.
Dean rewinds the tape, feeling weirdly guilty for having been too distracted to listen to Cas’s tape. It starts with
Dean carefully didn't think about how he'll never be able to say it. He won't get that happiness either because that feels too big and too cruel. Let Castiel have his happiness. What's one more thing that Dean can't say? He can't even imagine the words in his mind without seeing black goo sliding down Castiel's face.
As soon as Dean connects the two thoughts, he simply gives up, lays back on his pillow, and entertains the thought of smothering himself to death. He knows he resolved to be a bit better, accomplish little goals, but he didn’t mean to turn himself into a fucking girl.
Plus, Cas loves him. He does. So, he got tired of dating Dean. But he does love Dean. So, Dean can listen to the tape. It was a gift. You get to keep those.
Dean feels the weight of his first shotgun, trained at the door when strangers walked by and he didn’t know if they were monsters coming to steal Sammy away. He sees Jack kneeling in front of him, the colt sparking into Azazel.
He looks out the window at the forests blurring by. Lets himself think about Jess baking, and Jess laughing, and Jess burning on the ceiling. Lets himself remember how the grief of that loss would have eaten him alive, but Dean hadn’t let it.
His hands skate over Cas’s forearm as he pulls away. Cas’s breath catches. Dean’s brain lights on fire.
It's still there, faded and faint as it is. In the soft light of Jack's room, it seems to glow softly. Jack really is the smartest of them all because he understands what it is immediately and whispers, “That's Castiel's.” Simple as that.
Cas is on the edge of the bed, Dean kneeling between his legs, and Dean’s mind is filled with nothing but static noise and harsh breathing and the insane noises that Cas releases at every touch. He pauses, struggling to get himself under control, otherwise this will be over too soon — way too soon — and Dean wants this to go one forever.
“My dad called,” Patience admits, staring down at her phone like it might detonate. Dean’s not certain about the circumstances that lead to Patience living with Jody, but it’s not the sort of thing you ask in casual conversation. Dean’s read on James Turner was that he was a nice enough man. He was at least willing to do what was needed to find his daughter. Dean knows Patience and her dad have something rocky though. You don’t abruptly leave to live with someone else if your relationship with your father is thriving.
At a yell from the other room, Patience twists to look through the door. “We should probably get back,” she says, though she doesn’t seem excited about it.
‘Please,’ he thinks wildly, pleading to no one. Maybe to the God that doesn’t exist anymore, maybe to the universe. He’s not even sure what he’s asking for. He just doesn’t want to be alone. ‘Please save me.’ He knows no one will come. No one is going to come. Dean doesn’t deserve to be saved. Not anymore.
Eileen has lots of friends in the hunter community, a couple who knew ASL for their own reasons. Not a single person had started to learn it just for her. Not till the Winchesters. Actually, Eileen’s not sure if Liliana knew it before, but that was so long ago.
Dean had known such sadness, such grief, such pain. Cas had always admired the strength of his feeling, the totality of Dean’s being. His love was a physical force in the universe. Here, with Dean bundled against him, Cas was reminded of Dean’s youth, how much he had suffered, how little peace he’d ever enjoyed. Dean’s pain sunk hooks in him young, leaving him strung up for the remainder of his days. Dean’s heart bled for every little thing, not just because he loved, but because the world slid scalpels into his chest, cut him open, and gave him only two options: bleed out on everything, or never bleed again.
Even now, in the face of Cas’s merciful affection, Dean’s traitorous heart wants to take more. Cas had given him everything, and didn’t ask for a single thing in response. Dean — horrible, twisted, idiotic Dean — wants more.
“Should it become necessary, you cannot ask me not to do everything in my power to save you, Dean,” Cas says, standing and stepping closer. “It’s my life, and I wouldn’t choose an existence without you in it.” Dean feels something in him snap.
Dean feels a flush of shame sink cold through his chest amidst the welling panic that Cas might not be lying. Dean thinks about Cas, who raised him from Hell and could easily put him back there. Cas saying he was moving on. He thinks about how little he has to offer that could convince Cas to stay.
Cas tilts his head suddenly, probably picking something up on angel radio, and Dean runs through the whole conversation. He tries to deduce what went so horribly wrong, figures it was probably right around when Cas had said, “I’m the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition” and Dean had proceeded to stab him. However, every moment that followed was a strong contender.
Dean listens all the way through, then rewinds. Distracted by the quality of the singing, the music, the everything, he keeps missing the lyrics. On the second listen, he picks out
Sam shrugs, but his mouth twists. His hands drift back to the book, a clear sign that he doesn’t want to talk further. A weight settles on Sam’s shoulders. Cas puzzles over how to lift it, but it’s Sam who breaks the silence between them.
He forces his feet to move, casual and comfortable, and he’s placing the walkman in his hand on the desk, and that's why he breaks eye contact. He has to look to see where he’s putting it.
The hunt makes more sense after Dean’s revelation, in that it starts to make sense at all. There are too many combinations of supernatural creatures that could end up with “Blood Drained, Organs Eaten,” so it still moves slowly, but Eileen’s mostly glad that it’s not a god of some kind.
Dean enjoys cooking, Sam knows. Or maybe Dean just enjoys food and feeding people, but it’s close enough.

Sure enough, by the time Dean is pushing eggs around to get them just right, Jack wanders in from upstairs while the tell tale sound of fluttering wings alerts him to Cas's presence.
Dean steals another look at Eileen, who has fished out her phone and is excitedly texting someone. Based on the smile stretching across her face, Dean assumes it’s Sam.
The stars, the drive. Standing with Cas at the threshold of his bedroom, searching for a way to invite Cas in. It’s weird to not be able to tell Cas something, but he couldn’t work his jaw to entreat Cas inside. He couldn’t think of a different way to get the words past his mouth. He’d laid on the bed that night, unable to sleep amidst a completely nonsensical longing.
“Thank you, Sam.” Cas smiles at the man in front of him, trying hard to offer comfort even though Cas hadn’t been able to explain that he was having a problem. “You’re a good man. I love you, too.”
And Dean had started to pray. It was formless — a longing that never quite surfaced into words. Because that's what he did these days. Because he didn't know what else to do. Because he didn't know if Cas could hear him in the Empty. Hell, he didn't know if Cas would care to listen — but Cas deserved to know that Jack was here and he was okay and —
That night, Dean had wondered aloud what had gotten Jack “so obsessed with the stuff.” Cas hadn’t explained that it was him. That Jack wanted to understand Dean. Instead, he’d smiled and said, “The nuances of human communication are confusing for any 3 year old. It’s unsurprising that he seeks guidance.”
It might not even be a monster. Maybe this is just a very weird serial killer. Eileen has no idea what's going on, but she and Dean are the only people looking into it, so she’s going to find out. It would serve Sam right, though, if it was a serial killer. Dean and Eileen would brag forever.
- Apologies for late posting tonight! I started grad school this week (woo!), and while my classes are bomb, they require a great deal of brain power.
can bring some!” He says, leveraging himself forward to stick a finger into Claire’s space. She meets him there. He’s about to add something, but he catches Kaia flinch back in the corner of his vision, and suddenly he’s snatching his finger back like it’s been burned. He gathers the cups up quickly, like holding glass might somehow make him delicate. He misses Claire’s return shot.
When he finally settles, he can still feel the pressure of Cas’s lips beneath his own, the softness of Cas’s hair in his hands, the warmth of Cas’s chest pushed up against him.
Now, the bad news: because Yar is preparing for a MASSIVE TEST next Friday, we will be taking a one week hiatus from posting. We will, however, accept any and all comments as confidence fodder to carry her through the ordeal.
Cas died for him, came back for him, and made him a mixtape. Cas runs half of Heaven. Cas raised the new God and did it so well that the kid saved the world, then fixed Heaven for funsies. Cas dragged Dean out of Hell, and every dark place after that. Cas tried so hard at everything, even when he failed over and over again. Cas came when Dean called, even if it took some time, even if he was dead. Cas looked him in the face and said
Still, it’s fast and easy, so in a short 10 minutes, Dean is toasting bread, and Jody is telling the girls to set the table. In 3 minutes, his work is devoured by a pack of wolves that spend the rest of the day pretending to be nice little girls.
Dean rolls his eyes. A lull settles. Dean flips the walkman in his right hand just to have something to do, and Sam’s grin gives way to a thoughtful expression.
Dean stares at his hands, choking on thoughts he can’t make himself think, even alone in his mind. He fiddles with the coffee maker, fingers trembling.
Claire squirms uncomfortably. Under the table Dean sees Kaia grab Claire's hand. Dean feels no sympathy.
It takes a couple of tries given the shocking number of blue flowers in the world, but Dean finally gets a lead on what kind of flower Cas had strewn on his bedside. Nemophilia. Baby Blue Eyes.
But Dean can’t. He can’t make this about himself. He can’t show Cas the jagged, imperfect thing that is his longing, his want, his love. But he also can’t have Cas thinking it’s okay. He has a chance right now to stop this happening again, and he has to take it. He has to find a way to take it. He seizes on the one thing that he knows Cas puts first — above everything, above Dean.
His point. He thinks, gasping, rewinding the song just in case the next song was something else insane, like Cas's voice on the tape saying, “I cared about the whole world because of you.” His point is that Cas isn't human anymore. Maybe he doesn't even think about sex anymore.
Castiel smiled, which made Dean's heart skip a beat somewhere between terror and absolute shit pantsing terror. Since Dean is dumb, but he's no fool, he left for the kitchen, saying some idiotic shit to Cas about how he'd be making grilled cheeses, and if Cas wanted his dumb fancy cheese, he could go get it himself.
and he shoves that thought as far away as he can. Locks it in a bar freezer in a corner of his mind.
Jody had caught him staring at the water one too many times last visit, and Dean hadn’t wanted to say why he found it hard to look at, so he’d instead said, “Just wonderin’ if it has any fish.” Somehow, that conversation had turned into Dean building Jody a dock.
Sam looks down at his phone. He hasn’t responded to Max’s invitation, but he stares at the carefully unopened message on his screen.
as he puts the lightbulbs in the cupboard, and he doesn't think anything at all as he chucks the Pillow Pet at Sammy's head while he's trying to sign something to Eileen over Facetime, and he ducks and weaves as Sammy tries to grab him while spluttering.
Sam examines the situation. Dean definitely loves Cas, but the question remains: will he actually let himself?
The song starts, and Dean thinks vaguely he may have heard it before. Then, the lyrics hit, and he's letting out an ugly snort because — really Cas?
With the stimulus available, Dean can either think about Eileen in his passenger seat or Cas pumping out of his speakers. Thinking about Eileen makes his heart hurt, but thinking about Cas makes him want to drive off the road, and he’s not going to take risks with her life like that.
But he had to say something, right? Castiel was staring at his hand, but his eyes were slowly lifting, and soon he was going to make eye contact. Words were going to come out, so it would be good if Dean picked them. But what do you say to the person who dragged you out of Hell —  who fought and died beside you — who loves you so wholly and completely that even you, angry and broken as you are, couldn't deny it? What do you say to the person who died for you, got a second chance, and immediately chose to die for you
“If you’re going to be ungrateful, I’m definitely not doing the dishes!” Shakshuka is great because it basically uses one pan, so there aren’t a ton of dishes anyway, and Dean, despite what he said, is reaching towards the sink to have something to do with his hands.
The walkman. It sits innocently on his pillow, where he'd tossed it after making the bed this morning. Dean stops and stares.
Cas gives Dean a look that Dean wishes he could interpret as anything other than ‘Who do you think I learned it from?’ Dean, for a split second, wishes that he was an angel. His feathers are thoroughly ruffled, and it would make significantly more sense as a feeling if he had actual fucking feathers.
He remembers standing over Chuck’s husk of a body and hearing, “You think hate and anger, that’s what drives you. That’s who you are. It’s not.” He remembers choosing to listen. Choosing to put down the gun, choosing not to be a bullet for one second of his life. Cas had believed he was better than that, and Cas was dead, so he had no choice but to be better than that. He wasn’t going to turn Cas into a liar.
. He abandons the room, figuring he might as well start cooking now. He can make chili. It won’t be ready for hours.
Luckily, their shock doesn’t stop them from doing their jobs. Claire and Kaia are closing the door to Baby and moving to lean on the Volvo, so Dean just says a long, drawn-out “yup” as he slides into the driver’s seat.
There are maybe five of them scattered around the surface of the table. Little blue flowers with white insides. They’re very pretty. Soft, Dean finds, as soon as he works up the courage to touch one with the tip of his finger. They’re whimsically tossed on the table, like an afterthought, like one might stick a post-it note on a door after just missing someone.
The autopsy reports stated that the bodies had been ripped apart by animals, multiple organs devoured, and the remains left for dead. Obviously, they originally leaned towards werewolf or blackdog, but when Dean managed to get into the coroner’s office, he noticed the blood loss didn’t match the carnage. The bodies were drained then ripped to shreds, which points them to...something. Eileen has no idea.
Dean walks into the library and stalls out, because Cas is sitting right there. He revises his earlier thought: sex would be awesome.
The top thing she absolutely knows is true about Dean is that he loves Sam, Cas, and Jack. He’s deadly with a blade and insane with a gun — probably one of the best marksmen she’s ever seen. He’s saved the world a few times. He’s apparently held Michael in his brain just by force of will. He’s a good cook.
Sam looks up, seeming to sense Cas’s turmoil, or perhaps simply curious about the long silence. In a show of unbelievable camaraderie, Sam closes his book and turns his attention fully to Cas.
Cassie smiles, since she doesn’t have enough of a baseline to realise that Claire has clearly gone insane. Dean opens his mouth to correct Claire but realizes that “actually I’m maybe dating the body of her biological father possessed by an angel of the lord” is just way too weird, so he ends up leaving his mouth kinda open.
Instead, he says, “I do lots of things you don't know about, like doing dishes, apparently,” and throws Sammy an aggrieved look.
Sam knows this isn’t something he can push. He knows that. Still, it’s infuriating to see that Dean could have something he wants, if he’d just allow himself to want it. If he’d just let himself have it.
Sam and Eileen talk about nothing until they slide into the car, when Eileen has to look at the road. She flicks on the radio for Sam though, like she somehow knows there’s too much in his brain for silence right now.
Content Warnings: nightmare sequence with some body horror. If you want to skip the section as a whole, proceed to after the "--" cut and begin with "Castiel sits across from Sam".
Except caterpillars. Caterpillars are terrifying and evil. No, I will not be accepting questions at this time. (For clarity, no caterpillars are featured in this story. Gross. I feel bad for even mentioning them)
Sam feels that twist in his gut, but not in a bad way. The love in that sentence is physical, attached so clearly to the soundwaves that it rattles between Sam’s ears. Sam feels the last thread of tension unspool and says with a level of sincerity that he knows Dean will find uncomfortable, “That means a lot to me.”
Dean, wisely, doesn't argue. Cas leaves the same way he came in: purposefully and with what Dean can only assume is an ulterior motive to drive Dean insane. Dean returns to cataloging and doesn't think about the grin on his face.
She shoots him a grateful look. “Will you make shakshuka again?” Dean mentally scans the pantry, then remembers that he can grab stuff before she wakes up if they need it.
He suggests a cook out later in the month instead. Argues with D-train about the requirements for a perfect burger. Lets her make him laugh, makes her laugh in return.
Dean lets the song tick over and laughs as a vaguely techno beat pitches above the rhythm of symphony strings. He can't stop himself from smiling. Cas is so human in some ways, and so delightfully un-human in others. He probably doesn't even get the concept of genre. Castiel probably just said, “I like this song,” and moved on — no shame, no concern about whether that was cool, or if people would judge him. He just likes “Untouched” by the Veronicas, and it made him think of Dean, so why not put it on the tape? Dean likes the surprise of it, and doesn't read ahead on the paper if he can help it.
Hell wasn’t fire. It had been pain, unrelenting. He’d never questioned how his torment had been unending. In retrospect, he realises it’s because they were on the clock. They were trying to break Dean before the angels arrived.
He's not sure where things went wrong. He glances over at the dishes Sam left in the sink last night and lets himself, briefly, comfortably, blame Sam.
“You literally just said you want to go.” Fuck. He did just say that. Dean reaches out, closing Sam’s computer from where it sits between them. “Okay. What’s this actually about?” Dean’s voice is heavy, all traces of teasing gone.
The thing is, Cas doesn’t sleep. He has a room of his own, but he rarely spends nights there. Dean knows Cas and Jack sometimes go on their own “we don’t sleep much” adventures late at night, and if not that, Cas has all sorts of beautiful things he likes to go see.
Sitting at a booth, Claire has already put away a full serving of eggs and is reaching over to Kaia’s when Dean feels someone approach. He moves his hand from his coffee cup to his belt.
Cas smiles, and Dean sees the sun glancing off the lake behind him. He thinks about the four of them fishing on that dock someday.
Cas: full of funny stories about how various angels were faring. Dean: hyper-aware of whenever Cas was near him.
Somehow, they were fighting. Dean dismissed him with that cold, blunt tone, said he didn’t need him. Cas knew it wasn’t true — knows that Dean loves him — but his own hackles had risen in response. It had felt impossibly cruel. Even knowing he didn’t mean it, even seeing how much Dean was still in pain, Cas’s confusion had given way to anger until he stormed out.
“Jeez, kid — how much sugar did you have?” Dean says, somehow both fond and aggrieved. Cas remembers the Pop Rocks Incident and reaches out his grace to carefully put the display sword in Dean’s room.
No. John loved Dean. He did. Dean remembers wrestling matches, Dad clapping him on the shoulder after Dean used only six bullets to hit as many cans. He remembers Dad, impossibly small in that hospital room, telling Dean he was proud of him.
Pulling out ingredients for nachos, he fiddles his headphones into place, and then he takes a breath. He hits play and lets Castiel’s love wash over him as he pulls lunch together. It's quick and easy, and he slides the nachos into the oven before the song ends, though he doesn't turn it on yet. Jack doesn't like cold food that's supposed to be hot.
It was a good hunt — one where no one but the monster got hurt. Dean is smiling when he teeters into his motel room and swings the door around behind him.
Donna sends Patience a fond smile. Then, in the whirlwind of preparing food, Dean and Alex are allowed to help, and everyone else is
He sees Cas smiling at Dean, the idiot who didn’t realize they were dating, when he closes his eyes.
“He doesn’t.” Dean’s too shocked by that to scramble for a response. “At least, he doesn’t in the way I need him to.”
Dean nods yes without hesitating. Kaia’s grin splits into a real smile as she vaults into Dean’s space to wrap him in a quick hug. “Thank you so much, Dean! You won’t regret it.”
Eileen’s hackles raise before she viciously pushes them back down. Dean’s not homophobic. He’s not bi-phobic. He’s literally bi. Maybe he’s one of those ‘different rules for girls and guys’ types.
The first says “7. Parachute (Acoustic) by Ingrid Michaelson.” Dean stalls, wondering why acoustic and not the original. He recognizes he’s stalling, sucks in a breath, and holds it so that reading Cas’s quiet anger might hurt less. He flips to the second paper for “7. You were worth falling for.”
He fiddles the headphones of his walkman onto his ears, and lets Gang of Youths distract him. He starts pulling out ingredients for nachos.
As always, his heart is shattering, and the universe doesn’t care. A gentle breeze ripples over the field, flowers swaying softly to music that Dean can’t hear.
“I didn’t ask for you to come,” Dean snarls, and when that doesn’t feel cruel enough, “I don’t need you.”
, before his mind catches up to him and reminds him that he and Cas are NOT TOGETHER. And the millions of other reasons he's never going to know what would happen if he were to lean in and slot their lips together.
Hell. I was actually condemned to it. I made…” and here he flounders for a way to say it, to verbally profess
“Cas. You can’t trade your life for mine,” Dean says, and whoops, that was way too plaintive and honest.
Cas could survive in a world without Dean. So could Sam. So could Jack. Dean is the weak one here, and he knows that.
Destination: town. Mission: buy as many googly eyes as he can find. Just because he’s happy that Sam has a girlfriend doesn’t mean he’s not going to absolutely punish Sam for it.
When Cas draws back, the jagged mess of Dean’s heart is in his hands, and Cas is smiling, idyllic, at the pumping mess he holds in his palm. He looks into Dean’s eyes and smiles. Dean, mesmerised by Cas’s joy, smiles back.
“Duly noted, Dean.” Cas says, rolling his eyes in every way except for actually rolling his eyes. Somehow that’s when Dean realizes that Cas didn’t actually say he wouldn’t trade his life for Dean’s  — just that he wouldn’t do it without cause.
And suddenly, Dean is angry. He pulls it over his shoulders like a well-worn leather jacket. What gives Castiel the right? He knows how Castiel found Taylor Swift — Dean fucking
Eileen returns the favor with a story about Sam tripping over the single step up to her bedroom, chuckling as Dean howls. Sam had somehow ended up with beer in his nose. It’d been hilarious. For a person who can be so graceful, Sam sometimes moves like a newly-born giraffe.
“You haven’t done anything wrong,” Dean asserts. She hasn’t, and she should know that. “This isn’t your fault.”
The next song is...techno? Some sort of electronic? Dean pulls out the paper. Whatever the hell Flume is. Dean spares a brief moment to question how Cas is finding all these songs and then hears
Dean didn’t pick up after the second call, so Cas had taken to the sky, slamming into places Dean might be. Donna’s and Jody’s cabins, their homes, the town. ‘Please save me’ had come through with crystalline clarity. Dean’s prayer was full of loathing and fear, and Cas had pushed his wings faster, half preparing himself to dive into Hell once again.
Dean feels the grace filter from Cas's gentle grip to his hand. He feels it in the seamless knitting together of the angry gashes on his knuckles, as if the cuts were never there. He feels it in his left bicep tensing like it's caught in a phantom grip. He feels it behind his eyes and in his throat. He just feels it.
Dean thinks through the few decent good relationships he’s had. Robin, Cassie, Lisa. Women who didn’t really need him, but could want him. Whose thighs he could bury himself in to make them forget that he didn’t have anything else to give. People who never saw the full picture of who he was until far far too late.
Sam’s never pushed Dean on this before, because Dean seemed content with what they had. Sam, too, had been afraid of ruining one of the few good things they still had.
His fists clench uselessly at his side. He pulls his shoulders around him. He can’t breathe. He can’t stop Cas from leaving, he can’t save Sam, he can’t — he can’t — he can’t —
Sam sticks his head through the door with a shouted, “Hey!” and a wave that grabs both of their attentions before he’s shepherding Eileen through the door and onto the road.
“Do I need to get my order with extra salt?” Cassie asks, and though it’s a joke, her eyes dart out to the side, so Dean knows she’s a little serious, too.
If James isn’t a good father, then Dean must not even register on the scale. He blinks, trying to remember little goals, trying to tell himself that it’s about the trying after all.
“I wouldn’t even know where to begin.” He really wouldn’t. Where does he start describing Cas, let alone his fake marriage?
Dean stares down at the walkman in his left hand, the tape already loaded so he doesn't have to stare any longer at Cas's surprisingly delicate handwriting proclaiming “For Dean,” and tries to figure out what's worse: listening to it or not listening to it.
The waitress comes back with their food, and okay, Eileen gets it. She’s smoking. She blushes prettily when she mistakenly touches Dean’s hand. Dean, wildly, doesn't even seem to notice, flirting more perfunctorily than because the waitress is gorgeous. And she is
Dean thinks of Eileen, in the bunker, on hunts with Sam, laughing. He thinks of Eileen, hunted by the hellhound, stalked by a silent and invisible predator. He sees her body strewn aside and ripped to ribbons like a discarded chew toy, her only crime being an attempt to do good in the world. Rage crashes over him like the screeching metal of a collision. She was dragged to hell for no sin, hunted for no deal. She spent time in Hell, as a ghost, and for what?
He does discover that purple flowers mean “dignity, tradition, and success” which seems close to right. Gladioluses apparently mean “strength and honor,” which also seems fitting.
Also, Eileen’s not exactly sure how one trains a pack of wild dogs to eat remains for you. It probably wasn't an easy task. She lets her mind skate off that thought process, instead poking Dean in the side to ask how he thinks the monster duo is funding the operation.
Sound echoes somewhere, but Dean can’t find it. There’s a way out, if he fights harder. If he’s just better, this will stop. He can stop. He has to be able to stop.
But this — this soft ministration, this gentle attention to Dean’s pain. This blind faith. Dean is buckling, breaking.
“Just say it,” Dean sputters. His right hand tightens imperceptibly around the walkman where his arm is laying, deceptively casual, on his desk. His legs sprawled out, his left arm thrown over the chair — he’s comfortable. He’s casual. He’s got his chest facing Sam to make it easier for him to take the shot.
He aims the impala towards South Carolina. He’ll let himself have this selfishness until he gets back from Jody’s. It’s not like he can talk to Cas about it right now anyway.
Dean definitely didn’t have time to trawl bars last night: when Sam had gone to bed, he had been teaching Jack how to do sleight of hand tricks while Cas smiled over at them.
Dean’s not sure how to tell the kid they broke up, since he doesn’t know if Jack even realised they were dating. He doesn’t know how to tell Sam he almost had everything he wanted, but he was too stupid and too broken to keep it.
Eileen and Dean hanging out. The thought fills Sam with a sort of hopeful warmth. Eileen is great, and she’s got the kind of biting humor that Dean enjoys. Sam knew that Dean liked him dating Eileen, but this — this means he just likes Eileen for who she is.
Dean’s not stupid. He knows that loving someone isn’t always enough. This though — this feels like something else entirely. James loves his daughter, but not all of her. Patience loves her father, but it’s eating her up inside. James gave her a beautiful house. He gave her food, and safety, but only as long as she ignored the psychic thing screaming out inside her. Patience tried to smother it, but when she couldn’t — because she couldn’t —
The timing has to be perfect. Two more feet, but there’s no reason to lie. “Honestly, not really. You kinda suck.”
Dean braces himself, hands on either side of the desk, a comfortable and open posture to hide how much he wants to curl in on himself so that Cas will stop looking at him and seeing someone better. He fixes his gaze downward, but mutters, “No?” so Cas will know he’s listening.
“Want hot chocolate?” he offers. He takes Patience’s weak smile as a yes. The gang is still in a contentious battle for second place, so Dean figures they have a few hours of undisturbed time if they want it.
, so Dean pulls his focus away from the second page and tucks both papers into his breast pocket as he peels out of the bunker.
“Yes. I’m, uh. I —” Castiel cuts off as his eyes drift from Dean’s eyes down to his lips. Dean, because he really is only human, smirks. This prompts Cas to say, “I have...this was informative.” For some reason.
15 listens in, and Dean sits staring at the thin white lines that litter his knuckles. He’s able to listen to the song and not think about the times his fists crashed into Castiel’s face. The ways his words slid between Castiel’s ribs.
Calmly walking out of the car, calmly walking out of the parking lot in the middle of nowhere, and calmly finding a place where no one would even think to look for him.
Honestly, if the bodies hadn’t coincidentally been found on the full moon, she’s not certain they would have even realised there was a hunt here.
Then again, this is Cas. Maybe he's…misinterpreting it. Lord knows he's misinterpreted Cas plenty over the years. Maybe this is a friendly mixtape.
Okay, so. The situation. Sam’s happy with how things have shaken out. It’s not the ending he saw coming, but it’s pretty great. Cas and Jack. Jody, Donna, and the girls. Eileen. He’s surrounded by people he loves — or, well. He spares a quick glance at Eileen, doing a shockingly absurd victory dance — uh, people he could love. Could be
Eileen, super casually, leaned forward and flicked on his tape deck. Dean gets that it was a kindness, but now Sleeping with Sirens is screaming at him because Cas’s mixtape is in his fucking tape deck, and Dean is panicking.
“Jack.” Cas had said, with his rumbling tenor. His undeniable voice. Sounding so real. Casually, like it wasn't ripping up the foundations of the very safe house Dean had built for himself. “I thought I told you to wait for me.”
Dean is a marvel to him, beauty made massive in its contradictions. Dean’s heart folds in on itself, wraps itself around bruised parts, exposing delicate flesh to protect tiny pieces of the others he holds within himself, clinging desperately to those that he loves.
Shame, though. The tongues of liars. Dean’s scarred and useless hands. These things remind Dean of what he really is.
Dean’s eyes are carefully trained on the shirt and Cas’s arm, but he can feel Cas’s gaze on him, weighted.
This seems to upset Kaia. Dean is looking at Kaia, who is looking at Donna, who is looking at Jody, who is looking at Claire, who is looking at Dean, so it looks like Dean’s going to have to be the one to talk.
Dean allows Sam his grumbling threats, calling Dean a child while Eileen doesn’t even attempt to smother laughter over Sam’s shoulder. Eventually, Sam returns to his room with threats of war, and Eileen trails after him, wanting to see the carnage herself. Dean pauses in the hall and waits a couple of minutes. He’s rewarded by Sam’s sharp yelp and the peel of Eileen’s laughter. Dean’s not even sure which of the googly-eyed things Sam found, but Sam definitely found something. His phone buzzes with a text from Eileen that just says LOL in all caps. It doesn’t explain anything, but it’s appreciated nonetheless.
They somehow manage to be dry and runny at the same time. Dean’s scrambled eggs are always fluffy perfection. Sam still thinks about that egg white omelette Dean made; despite his best efforts, Sam hasn’t found anything as good since.
Dean blinks. “Okay. So, what’s the problem?” It's a testament to Patience’s turbulent emotions that she doesn’t roll her eyes.
Castiel breaks routine after depositing his haul and doesn't immediately wander to the table. Instead, his hands flutter from where he handed Dean the cheese to land on the walkman clipped to Dean's waist.
“Is that…” Cas speaks every language known to man (and several not known to man), but he can’t seem to find the right words to say what he needs. Language is often limiting.
The other is a Vetala pair in Richmond, Virginia of all places. While it's tempting — really tempting — Krissy and her crew are in North Carolina, and Dean knows that they can absolutely handle that job, no question. Again, not something worth going out for, since it'll probably be dealt with before he even gets close.
It's fun. The movie is undoubtedly dumb, but Dean is a little helplessly charmed by it. Jack’s enthusiasm is catching, and Cas seems to like it, which was sort of the point. Dean decides it’s a good night. Sam and Jack beg off after the movie, but Dean confesses to Cas after that he'd also bought the sequel, so the two of them stay up and watch that. At some point in the middle of it, Cas's hand curls around Dean's wrist and just…stays there. After the movie, Dean is sleepy, a little punch drunk, and desperately wanting to curl around Cas to sleep on the couch forever — but that would be murder on his back, and Cas doesn't want that.
Cas saved Dean’s life, and Dean left him to rot, too useless to do anything but hunt down the monster that trapped Cas there.
Dean sits at the kitchen table regarding his whiskey. He struggles to string together even a couple of coherent thoughts. Castiel is happier. Castiel may think he’s dating Dean. Dean may be dating Castiel.
He goes back to looking for a hunt that actually makes sense for them to handle. He's cross-referencing a promising omen in Wichita when Cas wanders into the room with a “Hello, Dean.” Dean doesn't look up, offering a shrug and a noncommittal grunt.
“You're up early!” Sam says brightly from the doorway to the kitchen, and Dean doesn't scramble to shut off the walkman — he just also doesn't…not scramble to turn off the walkman.
Benny. Charlie. Rowena. Jo. Ellen. Pamela. Missouri. Kevin. Mom. Bobby. And, sitting right at his table, happy to see him, Jack. Cas. Sam.
of all things. Dean thought it was the gang’s “Book Club Book” at first, but evidently, that’s something else. Sam didn’t know the girls had a book club, but he finds himself entirely charmed by the idea. Apparently, Patience has to read
“Look, it’s not meant to throw you into a tailspin, kiddo. You’re Cas’s family, and you’re not actively trying to hurt me. I like you fine.” Zadkiel mouths the word kiddo to himself, and Dean curses his complete and total inability to control his mouth.
and got distracted.” Dean hears a muffled sound in the distance that is either a man saying ‘Don’t TELL him that,’ or someone saying ‘Don’t sell him that.’
gospel.” Dean says. He gives up, sits down, and figures he’ll start at the beginning. “Listen, when — the first apocalypse was scripted, or it was supposed to be scripted. And it was all being recorded by a prophet of — uh, well, actually, I guess, God himself. Chuck.”
He wakes up from his nap to Claire banging on his door and endures her jabs about him being an old man as they pack away the last of the cabin. He throws the last of the tools in Baby’s trunk. He sort of is an old man, is the thing, so it’s tough to argue.
“So,” Cassie begins, and Dean only plays with diving for the door for a second. “Tell me about him.”
It makes sense. I mean, Dean clearly likes Eileen, and he’s not the kind of person to expect the other person to do all the work. Plus, Dean is crazy smart. He’s not always great with languages, but sign language is a physical thing. Besides, Dean’s not as bad with language as he pretends to be. It’s mostly the reading and the writing that he struggles with, which wouldn’t be a problem here. Dean can pick up physical skills like no one Sam has ever known, and he’s good at adapting how he speaks to fit new vocabulary. Dean’s got a cleverness to him that he always undersells, but Sam knows. Sam’s not stupid. You can only watch a guy build an EMF-reader out of scrap junk so many times before you realise that even you were underestimating him.
Well, he seems happy. He seems excited. He even reaches over to tap Eileen on the shoulder to ask if they can make a detour on their way back from the hunt to swing by a bookshop that Cas mentioned. Eileen agrees. Apparently there’s a good cafe in that town and a civilian who Eileen wants to check in on, Eileen being the only person besides Dean who has the right priorities, clearly.
Still, he’s back and alone in the kitchen when he finally gets to the last song. As The Platters start crooning
He sends a text to each of them. Donna responds with the thumbs up emoji and 3 sparkles. Krissy responds with a purple devilish face. Dean, briefly, feels extremely extremely old.
Dean grabs a beer from the fridge as the song changes and settles into wait. Since Cas has never made one single thing easy for Dean, the next song is heavy and atmospheric again, a thrumming baseline at the forefront before Dean catches
. Dean knows distantly that he should be panicking. That Castiel took this song and dropped it on a tape labeled For You.
Cas keeps his eyes on Dean as he evidently transmits the message. If anyone at the other end finds Dean’s threats laughable, Cas doesn’t tell him.
“You’re saying that God wrote a book about you, and the angels read it and are...what — they’re fans?”
It’s a fun song. Embarrassingly, Dean finds himself dancing along. He’s alone in the kitchen though, so that’s fine.
Dean rewinds the song. Dean spends the next 4:15 minutes trying to find a way to interpret the song in any way that isn't “Castiel wants to have Sex With Me” and fails. He rewinds the song to try again. He fails. It morphs into “Castiel, Angel of the Lord, Commander of Heavenly Armies, wants to have SEX WITH ME,” which is not better.
All in all, a case well done. Monster(s) dead, people saved. Dean happily scarfs down his victory burger while Eileen picks listlessly at hers. She’s vaguely perturbed. Dean’s burgers are better, and she’s annoyed at him for ruining her enjoyment of a perfectly solid meal. Based on the fullness of Dean’s mouth, he is not having the same problem.
When he’s done, when he’s too exhausted to feel anything at all, he walks back to Baby, slides into her comforting embrace, and tries to pretend that he deserves it.
. If he can do that for long enough, Sam will let him hang around the bunker after he’s set up his new life, and Cas will stay, and Dean won’t ruin Jack the way he ruins everyone else he touches.
He jerks awake just shy of five hours later, at 4:30 in the morning, and pads carefully into the kitchen. He piles leftover glasses and plates into the sink but realises that washing them would make too much noise, so he quietly lets himself out the backdoor and heads to the lake.
Dean opens his eyes and tries really hard to figure out why a fact that he already knows makes him feel like someone took an ice cream scooper to his chest and carved out every dark thing in him until there was nothing left. He doesn't come up with an answer.
“You're calling Zadkiel, Zad?” Castiel says, because he always responds to the wrong part of Dean’s sentences when it matters. Really not the thing that needs clarification, Cas.
He slides the walkman and the card into his pocket but doesn't bother to bring his headphones with him.
Then, Eileen finds herself explaining the meanings of non-binary and transgender, their relationship to bisexual, pansexual, and queer. At least, she tries — it’s not like she has a masters in gender studies or anything. She’s just bisexual, and unlike Dean, aware that such a thing exists, apparently. The dude watches porn. You’d think he’d have picked up a more nuanced understanding of sexuality than “Gay or Not Gay”.
Another thing that helps: a new hunt. Apparently, Jesse thinks they might have a small vampire nest a few miles from the ranch. They’re retired (a fact that Caesar had been adamantly rehashing in the background of the call), so they need someone else to take care of it. Dean can do that.
“Oh. That’s good,” Dean says, because that’s good. “You should be happy and comfortable here,” he adds, because Cas should be happy and comfortable here.
“Cas. How?” And that was the million dollar question. How? How are you alive? How are you here? How could you do that? How could you say you love me and leave? How could you love me at all?
The poem ends, but gentle strumming endures as Dean pulls off the headphones, staring out at the field. He tries to wipe his face with dirty hands.
Dean blinks. So, Patience is at least becoming more comfortable with her gift. When they’d first met, she’d been petrified of it. Each month, she becomes more comfortable and more assured. Honestly, she reminds him more and more of Missouri — a take no shit attitude and slightly more knowledge than she
Dean pushes the breath out of his chest. Sam looks ready for Dean to take a swing, his shoulders bundled by his ears, eyes carefully down like not seeing it coming will make it hurt less.
Sam is lovely — thoughtful, caring, careful. On a hunt, he trusts Eileen’s judgment. He gets that she’s been doing this as long as him. He’s fun, too. When she met him, Eileen thought that she was going to get the typical, loner, dudebro hunter who thought she couldn’t do the job for any number of stupid reasons (Deaf, a woman, queer — take your pick). Sam wasn’t like that though. He seemed to genuinely like hanging out. She really likes him. He saved her, built her a body with magic and will, and he still doesn’t want her to be anything other than what she is.
“Okay. Come on. You and me are gonna go burn off some of this energy.” Jack, practically vibrating where he stands, grins excitedly and bounds over to Dean, who favors him with a soft smile. The two of them wander off, possibly to the gym or the garage. Cas is pretty sure he hears Dean mumble something about balloons.
Dean drags the coffee mug to his mouth, ignoring the fact that there’s hardly any coffee in it, and flips his walkman over in his other hand.
Dean pulls out the papers. “9. The Next Right Thing by Kristen Bell.”  For a second, Dean’s confused. He thought the song was from Frozen 2.
“Any particular reason?” Dean tacks on when it becomes clear that Cas has no intention of further explanation.
Seconds later, he grabs his phone to try again. Nothing. It’s not like Jack or Sam won’t be able to tell Cas where he is. He puts the phone in his pocket, fingers brushing the mixtape that’s hidden there.
Cas’s eyes might have been saying something too, but Dean wouldn’t know. He hadn’t been able to look Cas in the eyes.
“He’s, honestly, he’s kinda an asshole half the time. But he’s kind.” Dean clarifies, aware that he’s digging so deep he can see China, and yet, still fucking digging. “And like you said, he’s smart, but he’s not like...a dick about it. I mean, he’s seen the entirety of human history — him and Sam can nerd out like you wouldn’t believe — but he doesn’t care that I don’t know that stuff. He just —” God, Jesus, Dean sounds like a 12 year old girl with a crush. He’d started out pretty strong, but now he’s basically mumbling. He goes to pick up his coffee mug, realises it's empty with his hand halfway there, and sorta just fumbles it.
Dean hits rewind, letting the song loop. It’s a catchy song. It’s fun. Dean is absolutely not thinking about writing physical love letters though, and he is devotedly not thinking about Cas ever saying any of these lyrics. He is shuffling the papers to read the second one, which he thinks are Cas’s little notes about why he’s including the songs, since the first one had said “Light of humanity” and had been about Cas’s experience with being human.
He immediately, obviously, relaxes. Eileen smiles. Sam and Dean are different in a lot of ways, but they’re built of the same stuff.
The hunt was good. The hunt went almost perfectly. Eileen was easy to hunt with and fun to be around. The monster is dead and the town is safe. Now it’s done, and Dean is going to the next hunt.
Dean goes to poke him awake before he ends up with crippling back pain. Jack mutters something sleepily that may honestly be “but sir, the ice cream needs foxes.” Dean huffs a laugh. He remembers carrying an exhausted Sam to bed when the kid was 8 or 9, tucking him in at the motel or into the backseat of Baby.
Dean’s never deserved anything Cas did for him. He’s not sure why it’s hitting him so hard that there won’t be any more.
“Dude, what’s got your panties in a twist? You think your freaky ass lettuce came to life and finished what God himself couldn’t?” Dean says. It's close to right, so he commits to it and grabs the beers, straightening up.
If Dean had been dating someone for several months and had only gotten tight smiles and bicep squeezes, he may have also resorted to seducing them with mixtapes.
“Jack.” Cas said, like it was an answer. Which, in a way, it was. Of course Jack wouldn't leave his father to rot in the Empty. Jack started talking, conveniently tearing Dean's eyes off of Cas. Unfortunately, Dean was now looking at Jack. Happy, alive, and animated Jack — who reeled into Dean's space and didn't jerk back because he’s too dumb to realize that Dean's a poison and that Jack should stay far, far away.
Cas resolves himself, greets his anger, and lets it pass. He’s worried about Dean, who was so clearly upset. That’s no reason for him to be snappish. Cas will make peace with him, and things will return to being good.
Dean’s not sure how he’s ever supposed to get over that. How close he was to a happy ending, how badly he ruined it. How desperate he is to fix it, how little he knows how.
The song feels like staring at Sam’s body in that shitty house in Cold Oak. It feels like folding onto the store room floor for hours before trying to stand.
“There is no threat, Dean.” Despite himself, Dean relaxes. “Zadkiel is confused and wishes to talk to you.”
Wait, what? Dean, who was pretty new to accepting the fact that Castiel is in love with him, falters. He barely reigns in a flinch. “Oh. So, you...don’t, uhm.”
Every 6 months, like clockwork, a body vanishes, only to show up mangled from an “animal attack” later on. It's unclear how long after vanishing the victims are devoured. They end up on the side of the road, destroyed by the elements — sometimes for months — before they’re discovered.
“You tell Zad that I think purple magpies are delightful. When I die, he can put as many as he likes in my Heaven.”
Dean’s grief split open. Stepping out of it, he had pulled Sam into a fierce hug, as if Sam was still small enough to smush into Dean’s chest. “Okay,” Dean murmured. “It’s okay, Sammy. I won’t. I promise.”
Sometimes, it’s like Cas forgets it's over. He leans in, or he reaches out, and Dean has to flinch away because that’s not —  they can’t do that anymore. It takes every inch of will to stand tall in any room beside Cas, but Dean’s a card tower. If Cas lays a hand on him, he’ll crumble.
Cas had held Dean gently, comforted by the pressure of him against his chest. He listened to the beautiful sound of his breathing, attempted to comfort him in return, all the while, worried about what could possibly have caused this. Dean had faced gods, monsters, and monstrous men. Nothing had cut him this deeply.
It’s not that she doesn’t like him. He’s fun. He clearly loves Sam and their makeshift family. He’s saved the world, more than once. He’s a hell of a hunter. Plus, Sam basically thinks he walks on water. By Sam’s telling, Dean single-handedly raised him, kicked ass, took names, and invented the wheel. Still, Dean’s mostly just some guy to Eileen. Just Dean. Dean, who Sam loves more than anyone. Dean, whose approval means everything to Sam.
Patience smiles up at Dean as her fingers still. It’s soft, but it’s there. “No. I know that. That’s not it.”
He thinks about the way he’d hit Cas’s hand away. The rushing anger. The terrifying wrongness of having been seen. He recalls the volume of his misery, still overpowered by Cas’s quiet voice. An underserved calmness bears him to shore. Cas’s love settles around him, like sunlight clearing water from tired shoulders.
He figures, if he can't find it — well, Cas can always magic one up. At some point, they'd all executively decided that Jack shouldn't be throwing around his God powers on whims, and they're trying to stick to that, but he also knows Cas would move Heaven and Earth to give Jack something he wants.
Sam smiles, and see — that was worth it. Dean feels like he can feel claw marks on the inside of his chest, but Sam is smiling and no one died, so it’s probably a win.
Dean examines the cold in his bones. He remembers the last time he felt warm, reminding himself it’s okay not to have that. He doesn’t understand why he keeps missing things that never belonged to him.
