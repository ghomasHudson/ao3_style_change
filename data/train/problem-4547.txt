He knows he needs to call Cas back, to tell him that he doesn’t want to lose him, but he loves him like a brother and that’s all. And yet…What had Sam said? To talk to himself out loud? He can do that. He can practice what he is going to say to Cas.
And yet, what drew Cas’s attention the most were photos supposedly taken in front of the courthouse by passersby just yesterday.
“Perhaps you'll explain it to me again at some point,” Cas says, dragging his gaze over Dean obviously so that he unwillingly feels each inch of his body heat up in turn. By the time Cas reaches his eyes again, he feels like he’s wearing a lot less than three layers and he can’t help but swallow nervously.
Cas—but if we ever show up to some alien Bar Mitzvah uninvited, it’s not gonna be to give ‘em a present—so, yeah, I fully expect them to disintegrate us or smite us or whatever they feel they got to do. What ‘bout you?”
“Dean, that would be going very out of your way…. And Balthazar doesn’t strike me as being incredibly patient. But I'm grateful for the offer,” he added, a little more quietly.
He first noticed it a few mornings ago when he’d come back from a jog. The angel had been perched on a Pottery Barn stool Dean had bought for when people wanted to sit around the kitchen island.
“We are both in this room feeling…” Cas paces his words out carefully. “Like we’re going to be more honest with each other even when the truth spell is over.”
“Saved by the bell,” Dean stated with obvious relief, leaping up to answer it—his jeans fitted nicely to his bowlegs in a way that Cas was surprised to realize he appreciated even now.
“What? I’ve spent all morning working up an appetite, Man. We should definitely, uh, go grab something. Just let me change first before my pit stains end up all over People or some shit,” Dean declared, reaching for his own gym bag on the floor. “I’ll be out in five,” he promised, slipping back towards the door Meg had gone through without giving the author a chance to protest.
“Ignore that,” I tell him, going to the effort of picking a book from the pile and opening it, half-heartedly. “They’ll get over it eventually. They always do.”
He and Crowley had already discussed which chapters he was going to be reading as a teaser—so he pulled out his own post-it noted copy of
It was something that Castiel had considered doing himself over the years. And he was confident that if Charlie tried, she would succeed. One of the greatest mysteries of his life would be closed and a potential storm on the horizon could be swept away.
Even though he hasn’t looked at Cas this entire time, he turns even more from him, jaw shutting with an audible click. He suddenly has the strong urge to tell the angel to leave, get out of the kitchen, maybe find Sam because wanting him to stay and asking him to go always seem to go hand-in-hand for him. But he can’t—because he’s under a freakin’ truth spell—and that’s not what he really means.
"And a couple of years back, she got it into her head that we should all be prepared just in case the zombie apocalypse actually struck." - Endverse, possibly
Sam shakes his head, knowing better than to tell Dean how sweet it is—the way that his brother has been helping Cas adjust to being human this time around.
He’d debated for the rest of the afternoon before following up with, “Would you rather hibernate every winter or be nocturnal?”
“Of course, you’re different, Dean!” Sam’s voice resonates with the concrete in the walls and under their feet, producing a dull echo. “Repressing your emotions is one of your major personality traits normally. And it’s one thing to hide your feelings from us—because everyone has the right to privacy. But I guess I am sort of hoping that this whole thing at least helps you be more honest with yourself.”
He frowned at a box without a label—only for a helium balloon with Gabe’s face on it to rise out of it, revealing the dozen or so dildos it had been concealing. What was worse is that he had ten-foot-high ceilings and the balloon was stringless, meaning he was stuck with Gabriel’s smirk leering at him from above until he could obtain a ladder to get it down.
This wasn’t like the rhetorical question Ben had asked only a few minutes ago. It was obvious that Ben thought there was a right answer here.
“Of course, Dean,” Castiel responded, digging out his remote from where it was buried and adjusting himself so that he was laying on his side.
“Sammy?” the actor mumbled, stumbling over the syllables like someone trying to find their way around an unfamiliar room in the dark.
A silence stretches between us, but rather than becoming more tense, we relax into it. Dean comes to stand more firmly beside me with our backs to the bar’s brick wall. He smells like leather and the color teal and vaguely like the beeswax lotion I gave him that he only sometimes admits to using.
Opening the door into the hallway, Dean instantly feels cooler, like he can breathe a little easier. He does really need to go to the restroom, so he heads in that direction. His thoughts are still a little preoccupied though, which is why it takes him a moment to realize that he’s not alone. Sam is brushing his teeth over one of the sinks, spitting quickly when he sees him.
somewhere along the way—and it definitely wasn’t from him. “Whatever the kid needs, I’m sure he can deal for a little while. Go ahead and take shotgun…” Dean insists, sweeping his arm out so that Cas goes in front of him.
“He said…I was like a brother to him. Less than a week ago,” I protest, feeling irrationally angry with Sam for what he’s trying to convince me of. Dean winks at waitresses and makes innuendos at female gas station clerks and puts on his dark green button-up shirt to go to bars on nights he doesn’t want Sam or me to join him. And I don’t mind. I don’t mind being his family or his “buddy” or his “pal” because that means I’m a part of his life—maybe even an important part—and that’s enough for me. I would never ask for more. And here Sam is trying to convince me that….
“No,” she says, with a coquettish smile. “I was all by my lonesome. What about you? Were you sharing body heat with someone Monday night?”
“Going somewhere?” Cas wonders out-loud, suddenly appearing by his side. Dean definitely does not jump—but if he did, it’s only because he’s a hunter whose reflexes have stopped him from getting shot or stabbed an endless number of times.
“Some of it sticks though. Not by choice. It just…does. Like this time he was telling me about how infinity works in math.”
His feet automatically led them towards his bedroom so that he could at least change into something less sticky after Cas finished yelling at him. Of course, it didn’t take him long to realize his mistake, causing him to stop mid-step.
“Dean,” Cas says, with undisguised curiosity in his voice—which makes sense, considering Dean’s never showed up at his room before—just like Cas has never been to his.
That gets me a weird look—but I throw one right back. Because the idea that a past version of me would have even
I realized when I was writing this that I left some strings with Brady loose, but every time I tried to add them, it just seemed to jar with the vibe of what I wanted this chapter to be, so, for those curious, Brady is currently in jail, having been denied bail for being a danger to society.
“I’ve been… unwell… the last few days,” he explained, as icons started popping up like flowers on his desktop display.
of deal?” Sam questions, knowing he’s being ridiculous but also knowing that Winchesters and deals of any sort are bad news.
“I know I don’t have much experience with sexual intercourse, but isn’t it supposed to be neither of those things?”
For the next couple of minutes, Dean makes appropriate noises as the Falcon gets chased by enemy ships—and a T-rex. To be honest, he was getting kind of into it when Jack made the ship land on the carpet near Dean’s foot.
thing for his friend—and if it got the actor away from the hellhounds calling themselves reporters, then
As socially isolated as he had been most of his life, he still knew it was strange to have never experienced physical attraction before. He might find curves on a woman—or the play of muscle on a man—gratifying to look at—but in the same way that he thought a painting or a sunset beautiful. A rough hand to his morning erection was occasionally necessary—the resulting orgasm pleasant and relaxing, but not the all-consuming rush of sensations that society proclaimed it to be.
. “The kid’s 22,” he muttered, shrugging. “I knew he was gonna have to go his own way eventually. Hell, it’s not like I see him that much now—just summers and Christmas breaks. Maybe a weekend a month during the school year.”
Castiel fit the phone into the hollow of his neck so that he could better steer his cart around a corner. “That’s not how it works,” he told his boyfriend.
And yet, even with the nervous churning in his gut, he realized that didn’t make sense. Charlie would have told him if the picture went public before Gabriel could send a bright pink ape to his apartment. Right?
But as soon as Dean’s snark turned to pleading, Castiel was helpless to resist, and it was amazing how fast one turned into the other.
“Then, I want you to start thinking of the bunker as home, even when you’re not here. I want…I want to be able to think of it as your home, too. And that means you should have…things…you know, a
They drive so long that Castiel falls asleep—and Dean doesn’t try to stop him this time. He must think that if he
“And all that sucks. But,” he shrugs. “They feel like out there problems. Like Future Dean problems. Nothing’s really pressing on me at the moment.” In fact, right here, right now with Cas, knowing Sam’s safe down the hall probably mooning over his not-girlfriend, he feels about as happy as he’s ever been.
The hostess tilted her head almost imperceptibly to where Cas was sitting slightly behind her and to the left. Dean swallowed. He was 1000% sure it was too hot in here and his pulse was jumping like a bunch of Pop Rocks, but slowly, slowly—he turned to meet the author’s gaze.
“I’m serious,” Sam spoke up when Cas had been quiet for a while. “There’s no way he’s gonna cut you out.”
“If they did this regularly, I wouldn’t be friends with them. In fact, I’m reconsidering their position as it is.”
” Cas repeated. “You’ve been spending a lot of time with me lately. I wouldn’t want to take advantage of your—or Lisa’s—hospitality by—”
Dean can’t believe what he is hearing. “Dude, you’re my best friend…And you thought we only cared about you to be our cavalry in a fight?”
The next few days are just as disconcerting for Castiel. Dean won’t let them move toward the Bunker until he’s
“As metaphorical pie, yes. I may be pre-inclined to enjoy your company—and you, mine—but we also cultivated a good friendship. So even when you’re upset with me, remembering those good times helps alleviate negative emotions. Simply put, you’re not as angry as you feel you should be because, when you’re here, you remember that you
The two of them stared at each other, trying to understand a conversation where they were both apparently speaking different languages.
“You know, maybe we should all take a beer break…but like, not all in the kitchen. Or, you know what, I’m going to go for a drive, maybe….”
“It won’t happen this time. I swear.” If there’s one thing I’m sure Cas would want to change, it’s the Leviathans. And no Dick Roman means Bobby doesn’t get shot in the head.
The woman grimaces but stays mostly silent as her left leg collapses underneath her. Rather than turning to look at Bobby and the gun barrel that it still smoking, I lock eyes with my doppelganger—and as one, we throw all our body weight on her in a football tackle. She makes a move to knee me in the nuts and she manages another bruising blow against other Dean’s shoulder, but then Castiel comes over and presses two solemn fingers to her forehead and all the fight goes out of her.
“Well, that makes two of us,” Dean answered, throwing his hands up in the air, finally reaching the point of exasperation. Castiel’s forehead furrowed a bit.
“Lightly used. His harp is lightly used, OK? Doesn’t help that he couldn’t tell if someone was flirting with him if they wrote it in Enochian on their forehead.”
Dean flushed when he realized that Cas was trying to get away—snatching his hand back like it had been burned. “Sorry,” he mumbled.
“He’s been crashing here for a few weeks…” Dean admits. So... the entire time Cas has been human. “But it’s not—we’re not—” He cuts himself off. “There’s nothing going on, so get your mind out of the gutter.”
The next time Cas bumped Dean’s shoulder, it was on purpose, and hard enough that Dean stumbled slightly.
.” Sam raises his eyebrows—wondering how exactly Dean knows enough about rom-coms to come up with these examples. “And second--” he starts, only to get cut off by Cas.
“On the ground. Now,” I order the blonde, edging my way toward them. I grab them without looking and, still moving slowly and deliberately, hand them over to my other half, who gets to work on his handcuffs.
started pressing down on him from all sides. He isn’t sure if it is turning him inside-out or outside-in, but he finds himself thinking “please” over and over again.
The day she found a report that said he’d died, her heart had squeezed like clay. But then, two months later, she found him again—face reflected on a storefront window of a town that had seen three mysterious deaths of teenagers in the last week.
Castiel didn’t know much about parenthood—at all—but he recognized that Dean was a good dad, with Ben’s best interests at heart. He assumed Lisa did as well, which is how he was able to predict where this story was going about a half-second before Dean said it.
It’s night again. And raining outside. Big, fat drops that seem to rattle inside the window air conditioning unit that Castiel doesn’t think works anyway.
Two hours later, he and Dean stepped out onto the alley beside the studio, which was also attached to the private parking garage where the Impala was waiting for him.
the actor lowered his voice some. “I wasn’t sure if I said something that really pissed you off when you were eavesdropping on me earlier.”
“That’s what the bribe is for,” Dean tells his new partner, setting down a large coffee, shot of expresso, two sugars. They’d been working together for about a month. But even though Benny is obviously more reserved than Dean, several stakeouts together have opened him up enough to talk a bit about his military background and the restaurant his wife, Andrea, owns—so Dean figures it won’t be long before they’re friends.
He should go to Sam with the box of books and tell him that, as expected, they contained nothing new—and whatever his brother imagined he’d learn from these pages was completely off the mark. Instead, he shoves the books under his bed, decides he’s going to make sausage
Castiel tilted his chin up slightly until Dean seemed to get the message and leaned down to kiss him again. “Better?” the actor asked, smirking, when he pulled away, Cas’s hands still grasping both of Dean’s arms at the elbows.
It was Castiel’s turn to almost choke to death on something. “Is that… a possibility?” he wondered out loud.
the name getting faster and more forceful with every minute that passes—like an angry spirit is trying to talk to him from the other side. He needs to be doing
Castiel thought. “What he sorely lacks in creativity, he makes up for in general pain-in-the-assery. But that doesn’t mean that I’m not going to give better than I get.”
“Not everywhere, apparently,” he says, after taking a breath and attaching a tight smile to his face. “Because I’m pretty sure Jack hadn’t seen you for seven years when you showed up out of the blue. And when you
“Why do you always deny yourself good things out of the assumption that they’ll fall apart?” he says with genuine frustration. “You want to go. We should try. And if something comes up, we’ll deal with it, and
Slowly, Dean reaches out to shake the other man's hand—ignoring the way the rest of his body is already shaking—twisting his grip as soon as they are palm-to-palm so that Castiel's wrist is face up.
“We’re fine, Sammy,” Dean insisted, even though those words tasted a bit like iron on his tongue. “Or we’ll
a new toothbrush!” he yells louder after Dean’s retreating figure. “I’m guessing you haven’t switched yours out in the last three months.”
Castiel’s eyes snapped front again—even though Gabriel wasn’t present to examine. “Wh-what do you mean?” he stuttered. More like
“Cassie, you just basically said that you’re too scared to ask your boyfriend for more lovin’ because you assume he’s gonna turn you down. And on top of that, you’re assuming
“While you are ‘awesome’, you are also human. You need sleep—more than four hours. When I was human, I couldn’t stand less than six.”
The actor paused his ranting to consider that for a moment. He licked his lips, “So, what you’re saying is… a joke about
“Oh, come on, Dean, you know that if you went through something like that, you’d be trying to push everyone away too. He doesn’t
Maybe that’s why, instead of winding up in the kitchen, my steps take me to the library. The stupid crystal’s sitting on one of the side tables, pulsing purple almost like it’s got a heartbeat, as I try to remember how it works.
The actor dropped the fist he’d been using to knock, stuffing both hands in his pockets. “Cas,” he repeated, staring at a point over the author’s left shoulder rather than at his face. “We need to talk.”
Dean’s heart thumps slower and slower, like the tail of a dog who realizes they’re not getting the bone they were expecting. “Are you talking about Cas, Jack?”
Dean starts to feel sleepiness loosen his muscles, even make his mouth water a little bit, but he refuses to give into it. “Alternate--” yawn—"sharing something you consider”—yawn—"a positive characteristic of your partner. Share a total of five items.”
“Uh huh. I think we’re both in this room feeling like you’re a sarcastic little shit,” Dean says, gesturing for the angel to go in front of him.
dinner—but Lisa offered, and the evening was proving a bit more tiring than he expected. The mental sluggishness was something he usually associated with family dinners, though before tonight, he thought that was limited to dealing with his own. Apparently, even when everyone around the table was being friendly and non-judgmental, he just had a limit for how much of other people he could deal with—and he was currently reaching it.
“See you, Benny,” Dean called out after the other man, walking with him toward the front door—until finally, it closed with a satisfying thud. “Dude,” he said next, turning to Cas. “I’ve never seen you drink. I would have expected you to be
They hadn’t discussed what they were doing next, but Dean seemed to be driving in the direction of Castiel’s apartment. The author had a moment of melancholy at the thought, but he pushed it aside as Dean started recounting a story about how Sam had agreed to participate in a charity event where he got auctioned off as a date.

The man looked him up and down, recognition dawning. “You’ll understand if I don’t take your word for that.”

Not in the way I do now—where I know the words to your favorite Zeppelin songs and what you look like what you’re lying—but I did know you were…well, righteous.
The youngest Winchester was in the middle of talking about how he and his dormmates hid a dog in their room for two semesters when Sam’s phone buzzed.
He forces himself to picture what it would be like to step closer…to watch that blue he lo—likes—so much get edged out by dilating pupils. To hear a tiny hitch in Cas’s breath—a sign he is caught up in the moment since he doesn’t actually need to breathe.
“Yeah…” Sam’s smile turned sad, “It does.” He remembered watching Jessica throwing her head back in laughter, talking to a barista at the coffee house where they were supposed to meet for a lunch date. She was naturally bubbly, of course, but that didn’t stop him from slinging his arm around her shoulders as soon as he joined her in line.
to get put on the books?”—which somehow transitioned into Dean talking about his brother. Every once in a while, they’d realize how loud they’d suddenly become and settle down into whispers, only for the volume of their conversation to steadily rise all over again.
“How close and warm is your family? Do you feel your childhood was happier than most other people’s?” and a second question about the meaning of friendship similarly get brushed off in a sentence or less.
When Sam finds them thirty minutes later, Dean is in the middle of prodding Cas to summarize other movies they’ve watched together. Besides calling Ghostbusters “the one where the hunters wear strange backpacks and fight a marshmallow,” Tombstone is “the one with guns and tuberculosis”, and Star Wars is “the one in space where some uses of grace are either ‘light’ or ‘dark’ and the main villain needs a ventilator”. He then called Indiana Jones “the one with the monkey chasing scene” by which, Dean realized with horror, the angel meant Crystal Skull.
“I’m worried you will—if you don’t like what you see in my memories.” There’s no point in hiding it. I’ve kept so many secrets from him—some for my own benefit, some for his—but now he’s going to learn them all and if he’s going to reject me for them, I would rather he do it here, now—not tomorrow, or next week, or next month.
She bit her lip. And suddenly, Castiel was aware he’d made a social error, even if he wasn’t sure what kind of mistake it was.
As he talks—thinks—whatever, I can also see the images he’s describing. Amara in her favored black dress, reaching out to Cas’s chest with nail-polished covered fingers until her palm settles against his heart with a visible jolt of energy.
“Well, Sammy has always been better at this stuff than me,” Dean answers Cas quietly. It’s true. Ruby-related detours aside, his little brother found something real with Jessica, with Amelia—at least until Dean Winchester showed back up on his doorstep. Now, with Eileen, it seems like he’s on the verge of it again.
The silence wasn’t silent. It rattled along with the heating vents. - Legos in the Impala's heating vents, as mentioned in "Swan Song" (5x22)
“Not bad,” he admits, thinking about how long it’s been since he last pranked Sam. Cas would have to be on his side—just by default, right?
Crowley snatched the envelope out of the gorilla’s hand. “Absurd,” the agent muttered to himself under his breath.
“I’m saying the same thing I said before you decided to join us. Memory transfers are personal. And as much as we’d like to ignore the uncomfortable moments, there’s going to be more of them, so we should likely talk about what’s bothering you.”
“Consider it a small piece of payback for what you did on set,” the author murmured, stepping closer and running his fingers through the actor’s hair, which had been grown out a little for the movie. Dean leaned into the touch easily, almost like a cat, and made Castiel wish that they had the time for him to just sit here, playing with it, the way they had before shooting began and their lives became too loud to allow for many quiet moments.
in any room that she walked into. “There have been times I wished I didn’t like you either,” he admitted.
“Just leave me here then. Go—rescue the others. Hannah, she’s—in the medical ward. And Samandriel should be in his room, but he might be in the lab with Naomi….”
” And, OK, he can see how a chick might think Cas raising his eyebrow like that is hot. “Do you want to hear the story or not?”
I honestly don’t know who I’ll become when you’re gone and there’s nothing that can bring you back.”
“I'm not trying to be difficult, I promise,” Cas slid in a second quicker. “But, Dean, there’s been a lot that’s happened today—my cousin, the
“What the hell are people saying about me?” Meg demands and Castiel instantly regrets bringing it up.
“Dean, it looks like your stuff is burning,” Sam interrupts. “Cas, explain this to me a bit more? I’ll admit I wasn’t always paying attention to the right things that year.” As he talks, he reaches for his laptop on the counter—and I realize he’s thinking about taking
“Are those…?” Cas asked after a minute, walking over to where four blue-green stones gleamed under the low light of a lamp but stopping short of actually touching them, as if he wasn’t sure he had permission. They were even shinier than when they’d been originally given—a result of Sam noticing his brother’s weird collection and buying him a rock polisher for his birthday.
—as something inside Cas coiled tighter and tighter. He felt the way a black hole must feel—collapsing in on itself.
when the tabletop Christmas tree—which Dean had put up again this year—tipped over, scattering keychains across the floor.
After a dinner of leftovers, they settled in to watch a movie whose plot Castiel remembered much less than Dean’s lips against his hair, reciting the lines way too close to his ear.
“Well, that relationship is already doomed,” Dean muttered once they were out of earshot. “That kid eats half a burrito and he’s toxic.”
The obvious question would be to ask him what he did, but wouldn’t that be rude considering how Castiel had just evaded the same question? Mick apparently didn’t think so because he continued without prompting. “I work for a hotel chain in the EU that’s expanding its operations overseas. I’m scouting out potential locations, vendors, staff... It’s all terribly exciting stuff,” he said, with a light chuckle.
Castiel couldn’t be sure which came first: the weird choking noise Dean made from deep in his throat—or Sam clapping his brother on the back repeatedly like he was trying to get him to cough up a hotdog.
, you do, Dean. That’s what I’m trying to tell you. I know it probably feels like the three of us are—pushing you down a path you aren’t sure you want to go down—but we all know how important choice is. We’re trying to give you the information to make your own.”
would have that in the back of his mind. Of course someone who fought monsters for a living had to be constantly aware of his surroundings.
Today, Cas was visiting Dean at the studio, but he wasn’t exactly sure of the schedule, so he headed for the actor’s trailer first.
“What made you look at him?” Dean asks with false patience. Years of habit have his fingers itching to take notes, but he keeps them flat against his thighs.
Dean raised his bottle to his lips, drinking about half of the contents down while Sam just sat there, waiting. “Fine,” he muttered when that excuse had run out. “Lisa
He supposed that they couldn’t expect her to pull her punches when she’d already made several concessions on his and Dean’s behalf.
No one doubts that Dean Winchester is a stubborn son of a bitch. It’s something about himself that he is often proud of, sometimes gets mad at himself for, but has never really made any attempt to change.
Considering the alternative was stating out loud that he was sorry her boyfriend turned out to be the love of his life, he nodded hastily.
by Lucifer—and suddenly the happiness I had earlier knowing that my best friend was back in the driver’s seat of his own vessel is gone. “So, I get years of you keeping secrets and vanishing all the time without explanation—but you’re going to trust
Dean leaned slightly against the dresser beside him, crossing his arms over his chest. “Yeah, Cas?” he asked, his voice mostly normal, except for the part at the very end that rattled like a dish set down too quickly.
He was still riding high on his post-orgasmic good mood, which might explain why the sound of the exterior side door bursting open caught him so off-guard. He jerked his head up, hitting it against the top of the fridge.
“Besides that. I mean, don’t get me wrong. I appreciate how much you mourned me, Dean, and I’m really sorry that you had to go through that. But there were other things you were missing that--She and Ben were the apple pie life, for sure. But maybe you needed to look for a chocolate crème pie life instead. Maybe you still do.”
lessons. But Ben perked up immediately—like a gopher coming out of its hole. “Really?” he asked, his obvious excitement loosening some of the tenseness in Castiel’s back.
“That’s not it at all. I just wanted to say that I… I think this is gonna be great for you, Dean. And him. Truth is, I could probably learn a thing or two from your love life.”
“Fine, but--” Sam reaches out to grab Dean’s arm. “You think you could give us a couple of minutes, Cas?”
Sorry this is late! Writing's been a bit harder recently. That being said, I did finish one of my WIPs (called
“You want something? Turkey sandwich? Hot dog?” Dean asked, pointing at the menu board on the wall next to a giant, neon chicken.
Charlie stared at him. “Cas, I love you, and it’s been an eventful day, which is the only reason I’m not rolling my eyes here. Of
“So, he’s not particularly social or big on the dating scene?” Dean asks because he needs to, but that doesn’t mean he’s not also curious.
Dean said he tended to take things far too literally when he was upset. Which is probably why his first instinct was to say something about muscle and bone structure. “I’m fine,” he answered instead. “Can you explain the situation a little more to me? What does this man think to gain by… this?”
“Not much. I know one Dean is in his room claiming he’s not hungry—and the other went out to the strip club.” I wince—an uncommon enough gesture for me that Sam can’t help but notice.
Dean opts to wipe his hands over the back of his pants while Cas, after watching Dean do so, reaches for a towel instead.
She frowns like I just told her that her cat was ugly. “No problem,” she says, with a tight-lipped smile, before turning away from us to reveal the rose tattoo on her shoulder.
“Considering the disadvantage my mere British-ness is putting me at,” he says with forced carelessness, “I can only ask that you give us the opportunity to let our future actions speak louder than words. My number,” he states, pressing a business card into Castiel’s hands. “Feel free to call me if you need assistance on a case. We might ask the same. After all, with all the resources the Men of Letters has at our disposal, we haven’t had much opportunity to converse with a friendly angel. I’ll admit to being very curious.”
Dean shrugged. “You know me.” In fact, Sam was probably more familiar with his sleeping patterns than anyone but Lisa, considering they had shared a room—and sometimes a motel bed—for years. Idly, Dean wondered if Jessica knew about that yet. The more she learned about Sam’s history, the more she’d learn about Dean’s by extension, which he wasn’t exactly thrilled about.
“Gabriel!” Castiel snapped, squeezing the phone hard enough that it almost slipped through his fingers since it didn’t yet have a case. “Tell me what’s happened.”
Castiel can’t help but wonder. The government? Anyone with powers? Why put himself in this position then? Risking himself to free people that he disdains? Was it just for Sam?
“So, uh, Sam and I worked out our thing,” he mentioned, turning so his back was to the counter, arms crossed.
“Dean,” Cas grumbles with squared shoulders. “I’m under a truth spell. I can in no way lie about the nature of my interest in you…. But maybe you’re correct in saying that I’m not as besotted with your physical appearance as the people you are usually intimate with. It’s not like I’ve gotten a chance to ‘compare notes’ with them so to speak--”
If Cas wasn’t so exasperated, he probably likely wouldn’t have said what came next. “No, actually, he thinks I’m secretly dating
I can understand why Lisa would want to hang you out to dry. Kind of a huge decision to make without her. And then not loop her in on.”
Dean excused himself to go call Ben and Cas felt all of the nervous excitement that had been running through him in full force now that he didn’t have the actor’s presence to distract him.
Unfortunately, he can only borrow Dean’s quietude for a little while before the crick in his neck starts to become painful. The act of raising his head causes a soft groan to punch out of him without permission.
“I can’t speak for my father,” he said slowly, steadying himself against another bump by pressing his left hand to the back of Dean’s seat. He briefly met the actor’s eyes in the rearview mirror before Dean refixed his on the road—and he returned his gaze to Sam. “He left either shortly before or shortly after I was born. I don’t know much—well, anything, really—about him.
He came back to Earth to the feeling of Dean still thrusting against him, more incomprehensible sounds pouring from the actor’s lips.
“Dean,” Bobby interrupts, nudging the older version of myself in the shoulder. There’s smeared blood on the floor.
“I don’t know. Sam could probably help me find lists of activities on the internet. I’ve heard skydiving is something people do when they fear imminent demise…” Cas’s voice trails off like a piano at the end of a song. “Dean, are you…pouting?”
that Castiel should embrace this particular course of action. A half dozen arguments and questions rose and died on his lips. But in the end, he settled for stating, “I’ll take my chances.”
“Whether it’s been Metatron or Ishim or—well, anybody, everybody—you’ve picked me.” Dean pauses, “I mean, us. You’ve picked us,” Cas raises an appraising eyebrow, but he quickly steamrolls on. “So, as far as I’m concerned, that’s a pretty solid track record.”
Whatever else he was feeling, Dean settles on anger pretty quickly after that. “You’re telling me that
The impact sent all my thoughts flying in different directions, like balls in a game of pool, and now they’re still bouncing off the walls, smacking into each-other, careening off again in new directions.
A contestant named Victor is the one to choose the only remaining category, “I’ll take ‘Winchester for the Win’ for $1200, Alex.”
So, Cas ended up being the winner of the last vote! But for those who wanted 2008 Dean's POV, that's coming up next!
It’s a mistake. Because the motion draws Brady’s attention to his arms—to his wrists, which are approximately at his eye level—and to a very familiar soulmark. Dean can tell the instant he notices it, as his eyes narrow, then widen.
This blended back into talking about food again, and by the time they wound up discussing tricks advertisers use in food commercials (putting glue instead of milk in cereal bowls, using mashed potatoes in cones instead of ice cream—“so it won’t melt under the studio lights,”—and pouring motor oil over pancakes instead of using maple syrup) Cas realized he’d spent several minutes not thinking about Dean at all. Also, he was never going to trust any form of marketing again.
to change. We already work and live together. You know me better than those who I have spent millennia fighting beside and I think I am one of the few people who can claim to know the real you. The difference between that and a romantic relationship should be minimal.
“For you to be the Righteous Man, you couldn’t just die—you had to sell your soul. And the angels and demons, they knew you would. For Sam. Because you aren’t just his brother—you raised him. You…took the punishments John Winchester would have given Sam instead…. Sam is brave…in part because you gave him less to fear.”
“Wh-what are you doing here?” Cas asked Gabe, mind racing to fully process his cousin’s presence—especially since the man in question looked… different—wearing something resembling a waiter’s vest, his slicked-back hair a couple of shades darker than usual. “I thought you were in New York.”
A throat clears. “How can we even be sure Cas is going to get hit on tonight?” Other Dean speaks up for the first time this conversation.
Instead, he addresses Sam, and it’s weird to feel the vibrations of that deep growl in my chest when he says, “Hello.”
For a second that might have been a minute, Castiel and Dean locked eyes. Then, the water boiled out from under the lid of the pot, hitting the burner with a
Instead, she blinked rapidly, turning her head to the side to swipe roughly at her cheek. She didn’t even make a noise. And that was worse. So much worse.
“Really?” Dean sits up in surprise, his adrenaline pumping in a way it only usually does if he’s running from something big and scary. “The last time…wasn’t really a walk in the park for you.”
before long, we’ll have so much dirt on the guy that he’ll look like a vampire does after meeting Buffy.”
Dean cleared his throat, scratched the side of his neck. “Anyway… If you wanted, I’m sure she’d help you out too.”
By the time the two of them pulled up to what appeared to be an abandoned warehouse—with old cars and broken-down appliances lining the gravel driveway—he began to think he shouldn’t have agreed to her invitation/threat so readily….
“Hey, Cas!” Charlie spoke cheerfully from Cas’s laptop screen. “And… Gabriel, apparently. It’s awesome seeing you again!”
He adjusts his body towards a stock-still Mini Me, to say—something—and, for once, I’m kinda glad that my double has his attention because my cheeks and the tops of my ears feel like I just fell asleep on a beach somewhere.
be the right person, Lis,” he declared, pushing his chair away to pace back and forth between the window and the table. “You’re—you’re gorgeous—and strong—and you put up with so much crap you shouldn’t have to—and Ben—is basically the greatest kid in the world, and you—you did that. You—”
He and Hannah and Samandriel said “good night” to each other hours ago—and then, the two of them went to sleep. Which is why he wonders how he got into the
He begins pacing, winding up to something big, and I let him, sending off a quick prayer to Cas to not—I repeat,
Cas crossed his arms over his chest—whether offensively, defensively, or both, he wasn’t certain. “You said you weren’t going to do this. That you weren’t going to change your mind or—”
“That’s… your own fault. I’ve mentioned my masturbation habits several times. You’re just—very stuck—on this ‘pure’ version of me you see in your head,” Castiel pointed out. He was still stroking himself slowly—enjoying the fire slowly consuming Dean’s forest green eyes.
at a freakin’ male Angel of the Lord. Or how Cas’s stupidly blue eyes went soft every time he did. Meanwhile, Sam and me were right there—cast in the roles of chopped liver.
“Do you… still get angry that I didn’t tell you that we were soulmates?” the author asked quietly as Dean’s fingers ran up and down his back. It was something that he wondered about occasionally—even as a part of him realized that being a couple wasn’t about never being angry with each other; it was about loving each other through the mistakes.
“So, considering all that, are you OK with me sharing some things with the Other Dean or do you still want me to abstain?” I say, opening my eyes, hoping the sound of my voice will prompt him to let go of the prayer.
He figured part of it had to do with their circumstances. They both made a crap ton of money, so if she decided to spend hers on an $80 hand-stitched pillowcase for the living room, he might grumble about it in his head, but it wasn’t really any of his business. The same way she didn’t comment when he bought a remote-controlled drone and then accidentally flew it into a tree a few hours after he got it. It was a far cry from what his parents had to deal with—trying to raise two kids on one income.
kid call him Daddy. And maybe I checked out his place a little. It’s a parent’s prerogative. So, when I heard on the news that he got whisked off in the night, I didn’t exactly care.
And as they sit around the map table, Dean complaining every time Sam charges him rent because, ‘I raised you, Bitch,’ and Cas arguing with Dean whenever he thinks the hunter is taking the game too seriously, Sam can’t help but try to record this moment in his mind. Sure, Dean and Cas being a couple has made their little family fit together a bit differently than they did before—but at the end of the day, they’re still family—and he thinks he likes their new normal.
“You know I wouldn’t think that’s what you are doing,” Castiel murmured—although now that he thought about it, the idea of waking up tomorrow morning to an empty bed without having gotten to really speak with Dean at
“Can I help you?” the hot guy asks—voice low like the rumble of Dean’s Impala. Dean startles, realizing he’d been staring this whole time.
“We’re placing bets on when Dean is going to get over his internalized homophobia bullshit and go lay one on Cas,” Claire says, shading her forehead with her hand to look at her foster mom.
worried about—in a constant, background kind of way, same as he was always vaguely aware of the music being played over the loudspeakers when he went grocery shopping. However, he’d only been in the city for three weeks. He could reasonably tell Crowley he was still adjusting.
of it was the most important thing of all, informing a lot of their future decisions. He had a hard time imagining that Dean, someone who spent so much of his life getting into characters’ mindsets, wouldn’t ask himself that same question.
He almost leaned over to say as much to Cas—only the author was on the other side of the table for once. So, instead, he caught Cas’s gaze, nodded his head in the new couple’s direction, and then rolled his eyes, fondly.
In the minute it takes me to collect my thoughts, a dying star, churning with nuclear fuel, in a galaxy far away collapses in on itself. 120 people across the world die and another 250 are born. Someone in a small town in Italy recites the name “Cassiel” as she completes her religious history report on obscure angels—and I can comprehend all of that much easier than the words that were just said to me.
Dean blinks as the sunlight coming through the window reflects off the blonde hair of the teenager in front of him.
compared to seeing what he could do with a blade in his hands. Not only did he fly through a huge number of peppers and onions in the time it took Dean to get two cast iron pans on the range, buttered, and heated, but all of the pieces were so remarkably identical that Dean had the urge, for the first time in his life, to take a picture of food.
And then, in another in a long string of surprises this afternoon, he drives the car in front of me, pulls over onto the grassy strip beside the road, and parks.
…I told you once that, much of the time, I prefer to be here…with you…and I meant it. But I have also made some great mistakes since we first met and I—I can’t live with myself if I don’t try to correct them. And so, I leave you and I fight and I struggle—and when I have a chance—I come back here and I let myself be happy…for a little bit, even though I don’t deserve to be.”
” Dean responds, clenching his fist. “Cas and I don’t say squat and we hold you down until you let us out.”
lessened with the shift in his and Dean’s relationship—even if, so far, the eight-year-old still didn’t know that Dean and Cas were dating.
“Have a good day,” she wishes him, after transferring the package, and before leaving with a swish of her light-brown ponytail.
I’m guessing Sam watches me leave the same way that he watched the Deans—but I dismiss the thought as irrelevant.
“Guess the real test will be tomorrow. You know, when we actually leave the house,” Cas says, tilting his head up as Dean’s lips roam closer to his neck. An involuntary breath rushes out of him, causing his fingers to tighten around Dean’s bicep, leaving him blissfully unaware that, on the other side of the country, his brother is leaving his seventh voicemail.
“I talked to Mini Me,” Dean says, a few moments after the smokers have crushed their dead buds into the ground with their boots and departed. I nod to let him know that I’m listening. “It’s weird to be on this end of things. Like, I keep telling him ‘this is your future’ without realizing I sound like all those other douchebags who’ve told me to shut up and play my role.”
“No! Stay.” He clears his throat. “And we could even, you know, keep going with the questions…if you wanted. S’posed to be about the two of us anyway.”
Castiel blinked. He had somehow not considered that, once at Dean’s house, he had no way to get back to his apartment without another ride. “Yes,” he breathed. “I’d like that.”
Dean breathes through his teeth. “I’m not ready to talk to Sam right now. I’ll just get pissed again.”
“I’m sure you can make it up to him later,” Sam countered. And even though Cas was still stressed, their banter let a few beads of tension run off him—like water in a shower.
I think, using the distraction he’s provided to pull my collar away from my neck, where I’ve grown uncomfortably warm.
“And at least you’ve got a natural ally in Sam. Maybe you two should go as each other’s dates to the big red-carpet premiere—give those two a taste of their own medicine.”
“We don’t have a camera angle that allows us to see him getting out of or into a vehicle. But traffic cams from either end of the street show a few dozen cars and a couple of motorcycles on that road within ten minutes of the package drop-off. We’re compiling a list of people based on license plates, but unless someone sticks out, that will still be about 75 people to interview by the end of the day tomorrow.”
Dean glances at Castiel’s bare wrists again and his pulse stutters. Can he be wrong about this? God, his real soulmate is gonna kill him for perving on this random dude five minutes after—
“No, Dean,” Cas says, with almost-anger, causing the oldest Winchester to look up from his own hands.
“I am too. You know you were a little stiff in there, and it’s kind of obvious which questions you were tiptoeing around, but when she got you going on a topic you were passionate about, you spoke really well and did that little sideways smile of yours that probably makes traffic stop halfway across the world, so I’m pretty sure you won’t be in Billie’s bad book. Hell, you even navigated that Crowley question pretty well.”
a moment he can't get back for his brother and his angel no matter how quickly he pretends he wants an iced tea from the vending machine.
The second is from a plain Hanes T-shirt and it’s much more obvious that the stain on this one is blood—dried and cracking, but still deep red.
A few seconds pass before they resume moving together—and it’s not perfect. Dean gets his head stuck trying to get out of his clothes, Cas accidentally rams his elbow into the wall—and yet, it’s so, so much better than anything Dean’s ever imagined before—because this is reality.
It’s an idea I hadn’t considered either. “I…suppose by one interpretation, we are doing the work of God here. Making sure the Apocalypse stays on course—just our version of the Apocalypse, not the Bible’s.”
“What can I say?” Cas responds, dryly, looking back with one hand on the door frame. “You bring it out in me.”
Aaron nods, enthusiastically. “I’m going to talk to Dr. Cain to see if I can work in oncology that day.”
“You two are real pains in my ass,” Pamela declared as, behind her, workers scurried to get Dean a chair just out of frame. It was Castiel’s turn to get interviewed for
The same truth that everyone else had been telling him for days now—weeks—but which he’d fought not to see. Because, deep down, he knew how much it would blow up his life.
Whenever she poked too close to a sensitive topic and he lashed out at her, she’d call him out for being a jackass and then walk away to let him stew in silence. When the next day rolled around, she didn’t ask questions or demand an apology—she’d just pretend like it never happened.
me the first time. And considering that it’s a beautiful species with a population down to 7,000, you should give it more respect than laughing just because it has ‘booby’ in its name.” He hugged the bird to his chest a little too tight, and it gave out a tiny squeak.
In the background, Sam is trying to smooth things over—telling Cas that he has very limited control over his own visions, so there’s no reason to feel weird about not having his figured out. (“Yeah, but they also don’t rip your head apart,” Dean argues back). Meanwhile, Cas is spinning like leaves in a windstorm. Is there a way for him to turn off his powers? To make his head quiet and peaceful in a way it’s only ever been in total isolation? Why
“You have to understand, Sam. I’ve always felt…strongly for Dean since the very beginning. But…it wasn’t always
The kid shrugged, the turned-up collar of his plaid overshirt brushing the point at the base of his hair. “Let you come in anyway. This place has a
Dean sits on the closed toilet lid staring down at his wrist. He’s not hiding or anything. And even if he was, it’s not like going to the bathroom would do him any good considering the thing that’s currently freaking him out is standing out dark against his wrist.
“Uh,” Sam says, intelligently, once they’ve skidded to a halt. “I guess this means congratulations are in order.”
“Dean?” Lisa prompted, and it took him a minute to mentally rewind and figure out what she might be asking him.
She held up her hands in surrender. “Right, you’re right, I’m sorry….” Although, it was clear she added something under her breath.
Dean’s eyes narrowed—and Cas’s did too—as the actor pushed off the row of shelves he’d been leaning against.
Castiel will admit that he wasn’t prepared for the commentary he saw. Many individuals seemed to find the idea of him—or Dean—or the idea of him and Dean as a couple to be… stimulating.
“I believe what Dean means to say,” Cas interrupts, the smile he wears tight and hard in all the ways it was loose and soft just a minute ago, “Is that we’re not involved. We’re roommates.” He hands the kitten back over to the volunteer, while the man mumbles his embarrassed apologies and excuses himself to rejoin his wife.
It was more awkward than hugging Dean—Castiel wasn’t quite sure what to do with his arms—and Gabriel also seemed to be taken by surprise—but when Gabriel finally pulled away with an “Alright, alright. You’re squishing the merchandise,” there was something secretly pleased in his tone.
“Not yet,” Gabriel said the words lightly, but it was amazing how quickly his eyes darkened in the span of that single syllable. “Now, I’ve been watching you the last couple of days—and you’re not stupid.”
Without thinking, Cas swung his right leg over so that he was hovering over Dean’s lap—all without breaking the kiss. His knees nudged the tiled back of the hot tub a little uncomfortably, but that hardly registered—as both of Dean’s hands moved to either side of Cas’s hips, thumbs running hot circles into his skin.
As soon as they had gotten home, Ben had raced off to find Lisa, but once his footsteps faded away, it was like all the other sounds vanished with him.
“Go ahead and make jokes. It’s not like our jobs just got ten times harder or anything,” Dean snaps.
He thought about being in the car with Dean after a trip to the arcade—Dean’s almost-scared admittance that he was bisexual. About a dark alley where Dean came to find him in the wake of finding out Sam and Jess were soulmates.
Grumbling to himself, he knocked the bottle Dean had picked into the cart and followed—ignoring the way he could
Just a warning. I will be going on vacation soon, so the soonest I'm promising an update is two weekends from now (March 14). I might get something done on the plane and post earlier, but I'd rather not commit to something I can't deliver on.
wish that I could do about the circumstances you grew up in, you don’t have to speak on them if you don’t want to.”
“Except she totally does, so the next forty minutes of this will-they-won’t-they crap is just a waste of everybody’s time,” Dean grumbles, reaching for the popcorn at the very bottom of the bowl instead of taking some from the top like a regular person.
“I’ve heard it’s a very common dream to have. Where you—you think you’re late to a test, but when you show up, you realize that you’re—unprepared and—unclothed—”
The actor whipped his head around to see what was up—and then almost immediately regretted it. Over at the far end of the table, Gabe was teasing off his shirt, presumably to give everyone a look at his own soulmark.
Ben looked at him sideways. The warm, dark brown color of his eyes was all his mother’s—and he would believe the suspicious, fearless look in them was too. “You gonna nark on me?”
That seemed like a negligible distinction to Cas, but he figured that everyone was allowed their own self-denials.
“The purpose of this exercise is, ultimately, to discuss our issues. I believe that some of the similarities I mentioned have contributed to our…tensions…in the past.”
“I’ll take the Garlic Honey wings, a glass of milk, and a plate of lemon slices, if that’s possible,” he requested.
And then—even more bewildering to him—was the realization that the soft rumbling sound he could hear growing louder was Sam
“What? No! You’ve been, uh, doing great.” And isn’t that the most wince-worthy thing he’s ever said?
“You could have introduced me to your friend,” his mother pointed out as soon as the bubbly redhead had left.
“Do you though?” I spit out at Castiel, hands gripped into fists at my sides. “Because from what I just saw, you weren’t angry. Or sorry. You didn’t seem to care at all about my baby brother being slipped a demon blood roofie or my mother
For all that Castiel is used to feeling the earthquake-like shift of other people’s emotions, it still catches him off-guard quite often. And right now especially. Dean seems… relieved? about that. But… why? Wasn’t he
He tore off the foil. The stone was a little bigger than the others and surprisingly warm—the crackles in its surface faintly gold colored.
The world I get sucked into is—blurry, to say the least. It’s like someone painted a picture of a motel room and then left it outside in the rain until it turned muddy.
“But how many seconds?” I ask as my other self flips between different traffic cam views. It’s not something I know how to hack into and I wonder when I pick up that particular criminal life skill.
be taking comfort from that. Instead, Castiel felt the strong urge to argue with them about how they were clearly misleading their students. “How about you?” he asked to change the subject. “How are your classes going?”
“Now what?” she asks, when she has the cooler transferred over Samandriel’s head. Even miles away, Castiel can feel—or more likely, just knows—how scared the teenager must be in this situation, his cries muffled but still there.
“You’ve made it very clear to the public how you feel about finding your match,” Castiel argued over Dean’s scoff. “When you came in for the Michael auditions, I was shocked. I didn’t know
was to write. “Several authors have recently started having open discussions about issues they perceive with modern publishing. In your opinion, what are the most unethical practices in the industry?” The way she had her legs crossed, with the triangular-shaped point of her high-heeled shoe aimed directly at him, suddenly seemed much more dangerous.
be trying to kill him, regardless of what other Me said because he saw no grey when it came to the supernatural. And if something
Castiel pushed himself into a sitting position—refastening his jeans over his fading erection. Fading, but not yet gone. Apparently, 23 years of only sporadic arousal had met his match in Dean Winchester—even if, or maybe because, they hadn’t had the time to explore each other fully yet.
be considered a comforting figure for what Cas was going through, and yet, Castiel wanted comfort from him anyway.
FYI, for anyone who read the last chapter right after I posted it--I had my husband read it about a half-hour after it was up 'cause I'm insecure like that--and he informed me that I never actually answered the 'name one extra thing you like about your partner' question, so I quickly went back and added a few sentences. Nothing ground-breaking or plot changing, just thought I would mention it for those early readers.
, in that it delves into the past issues between the characters a lot. In that fic, Cas also sort of forces a moment like this, and Dean has a much more stereotypically Dean Winchester freakout that I am actually quite proud of.
He knew that he was being a bit of a hypocrite—not bringing any of this up to Dean—but what good could that possibly do? Dean would just feel guilty for putting Cas into this situation where he felt uncomfortable around his own home—and whether that guilt
“Nah. It’s basically a two-step process,” Dean insisted, pulling a pot from where a row of them was hanging above the kitchen island so he could start some water to boil.
“Oh my God!” Charlie exclaimed, opening it more fully and peeking inside. “It’s a whole other room, guys, with more puzzles!” Gathering anything they hadn’t been able to solve from the first room, they all scrambled into the new space.
“Me? I plan to score on you so many times I’m goin’ to kick your Angel of Thursday ass into next Sunday.”
“Then you’re going to be disappointed on two accounts this evening,” Cas grumbled, turning on his heel and trying to ignore the sound of a shutter click behind him.
And then, his gaze landed on the same place as Dean’s did. His nightstand. And the silence that settled over them seemed to say so much more.
Dean huffs, “Overdramatic.” A few short strides takes him over to Cas’s bed, where he sits with his back against the angel’s stretched-out legs as if to, once again, prove that there isn’t any trouble there.
“Uh,” Sam says, blushing under the effects of the truth spell. “I was actually reading about this yoga and meditative retreat that--”
“No problem,” he responds, easily. “Melody was just telling me that I reminded her of someone named Peter Densen.”
“Well, considering you need my vote or Sam’s to skip it, I still need to hear what the question is…Sam?” Cas prompts the youngest Winchester, ignoring Dean’s scowl—and, subsequently, making him scowl more.
I realize that I’ve walked us back to my room—probably just out of habit—but I pause outside the door. Cas and I don’t usually hang out here—saving that for the Dean Cave or one of the other common areas—but I also don’t want someone else inviting themselves into our conversation. I push the door open and gesture for the angel to go in ahead of me.
“If you must know, I was at a charity fundraiser for neuroblastoma research. The party started at 8 and concluded somewhere around 2 in the morning.”
Cas smiles, sadly. “Yes…I suppose it’s selfish of me when I’m the reason so many angels lost their wings—but I miss the feeling. It was also…reassuring…knowing I could be there at a moment’s notice if you needed me. You?”
“You said ‘rules’—implying that there would be multiple. And I agree knowing the expectations would be helpful. For example, is it just Sam that’s allowed to know about us—or will we also tell Mary? Claire? Our other friends? How much interaction are you comfortable with in front of them? Are you—do you intend this to be an exclusive arrangement or are you still interested in…playing the court?”
real and you, Bobby, and Sam are about to have them coming out of your ass. Don’t listen to most of them—they’re douchebags. But Cas is…or he will be…family, so, you know, don’t go easy on him when he has the Almighty stick up his ass, but also give him the benefit of the doubt.”
to believe that—more than he had possibly ever wanted anything—but it just seemed like it was too much to ask. Even if Dean kept talking to him afterward, he worried it wouldn’t be the
“And yet, you’re still letting the restaurant display your picture as advertisement,” Castiel pointed out as Dean clambered in and adjusted the rearview mirror.
“Come on, why don’t we just—start—and then if there ends up being something on there that is really uncomfortable, a 2/3 vote will let you skip it.”
That was the thing. He didn’t have a clue. He recognized that words like ‘I’m sorry’ and ‘I never wanted to hurt you’ belonged in there somewhere, but his throat was tight like he was wearing a boa constrictor for a necklace, his breath coming out in short stutters, and what he ended up saying was. “I
Cas flashed back to watching Dean on late-night interviews. The way he felt whenever Dean said something that wasn’t just laying on the charm. When he hinted at the person he was underneath the cocky smile and quick one-liners. He’d been mad when the interviewer didn’t ask the follow-up questions that he knew he wouldn’t get the chance to. “Once or twice,” he admitted.
a good agent—at least when it came to editing and remolding some of Cas’s weaker plotlines. Who knows what would happen to the half-finished novel he had on his desktop now?
“Charlie!” Dean interrupted, not knowing if it was better or worse that Cas looked as uncomfortable as he felt.
First, he threatens his roommate to find someplace else to spend the night. “Or else I’ll tell both your girlfriends where you
With him gone, Castiel realized how empty the room had become in the last ten minutes. A few scattered people lingered here and there, the sound of their voices, but not their words, echoing around the vaulted space.
He waits for the angel to answer with a blink and an all-too-honest, “No,” but instead, he rolls his eyes with practiced ease. “I imagine Dean’s involves finding an all-you-can-eat pie buffet inside a strip club.” Which, Dean has to admit, would be kinda awesome, but he’s spent enough last nights on earth drinking and hooking up to know there are more things worth putting on a bucket list.
“So far, this monster’s been going after men who were out by themselves. Plus, we’ll cover more ground splitting up.” He almost feels like patting himself on the back for that one.
—he pictures himself scooting the chair around in a circle on the floor so that he can get his hand over to it, dig it up with his fingernails—
about what happened in that memory. So, he was a bit…drawn to me or something. Noticed me noticing him. I was a
see how these questions are going to make a world of difference in Cas’ and my relationship.” Dean snarks, resting back against the door.
“I’ll take a list of 75 over what we have now,” Dean says, almost slumping with relief. They’re still making progress—and it’s the killer’s fault for needing to brag. He would have fun rubbing
“Yes, Dean.” The agent can almost hear his brother’s eye roll. “He’s actually been asking about you…Well, about updates on Cas. They must have been friendlier than I thought—he seems to be taking the whole situation kind of hard. Had to take the morning off and he still doesn’t seem like his usual--”
Still, he waits for a huddle of students to approach the entrance so he can go in, unnoticed, with the group.
He tipped his beer bottle at Castiel. “I’m guessing it’s no secret to you that I’ve got a sore spot for soulmates right now. ‘Specially soulmates that can look you in the eye for months and lie to you. So those little games you pulled with Dean—running him around like a fool… Let me just say, I’m not impressed.”
are isn’t going to be the one to find him. I’m calling Chuck—he can apply some pressure to get the Feds on this.”
“I don’t understand—how I could have circled—” Castiel responded, though he was mostly talking to himself.
Castiel had been eating pretty much by route—and was surprised, when he looked down, that he’d finished over half his dinner. “Can we talk about this later?” he finally decided, after some thought. “I appreciate that you’re trying to look out for me, but this seems like something that has to be dealt with on a situation-by-situation basis and I’d rather… not think about it right now.” Maybe, he’d never have to think about it.
They played for about another forty minutes before Charlie had to log off for the night. Castiel tidied his apartment, successfully finished reading his book, and got some writing done—but he kept getting distracted the later it got until he finally decided to just go to bed.
“Uh…” Dean started—his gaze caught on Castiel’s bare chest the way a sweater sleeve might get caught on a branch. “Yeah… that’s….”
Then again, angels have eidetic memories, so that could be said of any voice I’d ever heard. Only this one I had been married to for seven months.
Dean’s mouth opens to form the word ‘good’ automatically, but when he realizes he’s going to say something different instead, he quickly changes tactics. “I’m—Have you seen Cas?”
“Castiel said that ‘Darth Vader’ means ‘dark father’ in ‘nother language,” Jack explains, hugging his arms around himself.
“A peanut butter and jelly sandwich in my apartment,” he said, honestly. - Very vague reference to Cas's love of peanut butter and jelly as a human and the way he longingly looked at the sandwich while trying to get the Gadreel grace out of Sam in "First Born" (9x11)
“Where’s the faith?” Meg questioned as she slid out of the driver’s seat, tossing dark curls over her shoulder.
Castiel believed that, in spite of the man’s lauded reputation, he’d actually set scientific development back
Sam is still waiting, impatiently. “I got, uh…distracted by something earlier when I was cooking,” Dean explains to his brother and, at the sudden reminder he hasn’t eaten anything all day, his stomach gives a loud growl. “Guess I should do something about that, huh?”
So he missed Cas. That wasn’t a shocker, was it? And why did Sam believe something from this long ago had anything to do with his mental state now?
“Have any of you ever read a Nicholas Sparks book?” Professor Mosely starts in her slow song of a voice.
about how people act in these movies,” Dean replies, leaning forward to grab a beer off the coffee table. “Real life isn’t—stalking someone because you heard their voice on the radio or…or forcing someone to be your fake fiancé to get a green card. That’s
And OK, I should have expected Cas to be blunt about this once his secret was out—but that doesn’t mean I don’t slightly choke on my own tongue when he just blurts out shit.
The agent feels his body jolt back to awareness all at once, fingers automatically reaching for the gun he keeps under his pillow, only to find the space empty. The next second, however, he’s able to recognize that the red curtain in front of him isn’t actually a curtain—it’s hair that smells vaguely like strawberries and once he’s got that puzzle piece in place, the rest of Charlie resolves itself fairly easily.
a familiar voice presses against my consciousness, forcing my already-tentative hold on the memory to slip away….
, he hated that so much. “Don’t you think that you deserve better than ‘fine’?” his brother asked, gently.
Gabriel flashed him an almost-fond smile. “Boringly enough… yeah. He grew up with a con artist of a mother who married a bunch of rich men just to take their money. So, I’m guessing she wasn’t the type to cut the crusts off of his sandwiches. Point is, the pair of them probably thought the step-daddies had it coming because they were all too stupid to get a prenup. In response, wee little angry gremlin Crowley made sure he was
Cas hums thoughtfully. “I suppose when Amara had me captured, she used my heart to reach out to you in the bunker. Since these two were trying to summon me, it’s possible the two intentions coincided and that’s why they were pulled from that day.”
“We were…misinformed,” the angel offers instead, though there is a lightness in him that wasn’t there a moment before. “Less dumb, less ass.” He full-on smiles at Dean then and Dean nods and smiles back.
"Nothing worth geting excited about," Dean grumbles under his breath, before forcibly changing the subject to whether Robert Pattinson will make a good Batman. He says he’ll give him a chance but it’s obvious by the way he keeps using the term “kid” over and over that he resents that this will be the first time the actor playing Bruce Wayne will be younger than him.
“You have a vote too, you know…,” Dean says, casually. “You said that telling them about the future was up to me and Sammy to decide, but you’re one-third of Team Free Will and this shit affects you, too. Maybe more than either of us.”
“Among other reasons,” the agent smiled in a way that made the hairs on the back of Dean’s neck stand on end."
“You mentioned waiting for someone. Is Sam…?” she starts, before the realization he might be expecting a date comes over her. “Do you want me to…?”
me. But I’m pretty sure you were prouder that time I had a drunken hook-up in the backseat of Baby because I was upset about my break-up with Ruby.”
Charlie stood up and moved so she was right beside him—leaned her head against his shoulder, tucked in against his neck. Automatically, his arm came up to give her a reassuring squeeze.
“Obviously, Cas,” he said, setting the rest of the ingredients down beside the stove. “I mean, what are friends for?”
15 minutes later, Dean has had two more burgers and Sam is finally powering up his phone to resume asking questions. “Take four minutes and tell your partner your life story in as much detail as possible.”
And maybe that’s why he’s equally honest back—even though this is definitely not something he should admit. “You feel different,” he whispers. “To me.”
Thankfully, Dean guided him through an alcove-like opening. “Lis?!” he called in question as they entered a kitchen that looked more-recently lived in. A round, wooden table was set with four placemats and heavy, black-speckled plates—a tossed salad in the center. In the sink, there was evidence that a couple of bowls and a cutting board had been used.
And then, suddenly, the two of them were discussing salary and duties and vacation time (or Charlie was. Dean mostly just said “Sure, yeah,” several times in a row). “And I want to meet Gal Gadot!” Charlie added.
Castiel’s eyebrows raised automatically even knowing the actor couldn’t see him. “As opposed to you purposefully keeping us apart, thus feeding my already dangerous imagination and curtailing my already limited time with you…?”
as nonchalant as he probably intended. “I tried calling him the other night at his sleepover, and he basically told me to ‘Buzz off, Old Man,’ so I think he’ll be fine.”
Dean feels his stomach drop—because he can believe that all too well. And if Nick is telling the truth….
“And he won’t,” Castiel decided suddenly, heart rate coming down, as he came to the end of the write-up. “He’s never even going to find out I exist.”
Bobby must see something in my face because he quickly sighs. “I wasn’t saying that as a bad thing, son. From what I can tell, Castiel is exactly where he wants to be.”
She didn’t seem to feel the same though, judging by the simple way she greeted him, “Good morning, Castiel.” She tipped her head in the direction of his outfit. “That looks nice on you.”
“Alright, alright, get a room you two,” Dean had groused, navigating a hot pan between them on the way to the sink while Castiel didn’t
For a second, Castiel flashed back to the article he’d read, listing Dean’s former girlfriends. He’d wondered then—but no, this wasn’t the time for that.
Castiel barely knows Sam and he’s almost positive that he phrased matters more delicately than that. “I’m sure if
“So,” Sam coughs. “Just to recap. Dean, you’ve been upset with Cas for always leaving. And Cas, you thought that Dean and I didn’t want you to stay—at least when you’re not actively contributing something to a hunt. You realize you’re both dumbasses, right?”
Oh, right—he’d imagined he was a wolf, running through a castle, trying to get outside to see the full moon.
Charlie looked between the two of them in concern. “Well…” she began, “People know that Lisa isn’t Dean’s soulmate. And now that he’s come out and you two have been linked so closely, it’s really only a matter of time before… Dean?” she cut herself off. “Are you okay over there?”
“That didn’t even cross my mind,” Cas answered honestly. Dean looked relieved. “Because I know you’re friends with Charlie,” the author reasoned. “Of course, there are plenty of men who are more accepting of female-female relationships than male-male ones, so I suppose you could fall into that category—”
“Are you gonna fill me in or am I supposed to connect the dots…?” Dean asked after a moment Castiel hadn’t realized he let stretch on too long.
and was supposed to have calming properties. Considering the way his blood pressure was currently elevated, it wasn’t very effective. He set it down again. “If I’m going to be using the same kind of shampoo for a couple of months, I’d
“Yeah,” Dean agrees, clearing his throat. “Yeah, that would be good.” He kicks off the door for the first time since the questions started and returns to Cas’s bed. The angel finally stops reclining in favor of sitting side-by-side with the hunter. And while Dean had been telling the truth when he said he and Cas were fine before, he thinks that maybe they are doing a little bit better now—though he’d rather eat a salad than admit that to Sam.
“Beer!” I exclaim a little too loudly, causing the Other Dean to jump. “I mean…beer? Anyone want one…? Because I’m going to…uh…”
Dean turns the book over. A stylized version of Cas sits on a park bench, looking up at the sky as if asking for a sign. He flips it open to a random page. “
Now, as the last few seats were filled in, he played a familiar game with himself. He watched Balthazar and Mo continue to launch increasingly colorful insults at each other and wondered how a book would describe the smirk that was completely hidden by Mo’s beard? More importantly, how had he come by that smile? Was it one he had always had since he was a devious little kid? Or was it a face he grew into as he became more jaded with the world?
“Yeah, real waste,” I hear my own voice say through the open basement door—his pain audible even through the sarcasm.
“Heard of knocking?” Dean demands, even though he can think of plenty of times he barged into the angel’s room uninvited. Cas blinks up at the two men with blue-eyed confusion from where he sits on his bed, nursing a book, but doesn’t say anything.
“Kill the spell now. I’m not kidding.” My other self says with menace, holding the gun that I’d dropped.
“We got her number. Let's head back to the bunker, and we'll put a trace on it,” I say, getting into the car.
Both fabrics also contained ash residue—which made more sense in his mother’s case, since their house was set on fire. They could only conclude that Cas has been near a wood-burning fireplace recently, which excluded the electric one in his living room.
“So that’s two things taken care of,” Dean reminded Cas, who was surprised to realize his shoulders did feel a little lighter. “And writer’s block is kinda like kidney stones, right? You just got to wait for it to pass. So that leaves what? The stuff with your mom. Which, not gonna lie, I don’t get. At all.”
have a double chin!” Gabriel protested, jutting said chin out to emphasize his jaw. “And both of you have the patience of mealworms.”
Every day since that interview had been mild torture—even before the Cas photos came out. As predicted, there were some fans out there who shouted from the rooftops that they were never gonna see a Dean Winchester movie again—and who the fuck cared?
Dean darts a glance between the three of them, then looks back down at his table. “I guess you guys didn’t get much fast food where you’re from, huh?”
“That I can’t help but feel happy that you’re happy,” Cas concluded, ignoring all of Dean’s interruptions.
party he’d attended as a kid before his parents learned that he was allergic to strawberries. But could anyone really blame him?
The woman in front of him appeared to be in her mid-20s, with medium-length red hair and blue eyes that widened even more when she saw who she’d just run into. “You’re… Castiel Novak!” she exclaimed.
“You—” Dean’s expression looked stunned for the split-second Cas got to process it— before warm lips pressed against his forehead, sending something happy and dizzy through the author’s veins.
A piece of Lisa’s hair escaped her messy bun as she leaned forward over the kitchen island and her own dessert. “Obviously, I’m not talking about having
“Anyway,” he breathes, looking somewhat relieved at the change in my posture—not even complaining when I reach for the Jack again. “The point I was trying to make is, I sort of got divided into thirds during that time. There was me…who I was before it all. And then there was the me that was wandering around up here without a conscience. And then there was the me that was down in the Pit, being battered around like a cat toy. And after we got my soul back, I had to—to combine all of those people back together—and it was
“Wait,” Charlie commented, her eyes widening as they darted between his face and his hand. “Are you saying you can
Although… Hannah and Meg Masters, the stunt coordinator, mixed about as well as orange juice and toothpaste. Or a bathtub and a toaster. And they both tended to turn to Castiel with a “Come on, Clarence,” or a “You can’t possibly agree with her, Castiel,” to coax him into supporting their points. Eventually, though, they got too embroiled in an argument over the morality of doctor-assisted suicide and he was able to slip away.
“Dean…Dean, if you can stop whatever dangerous train your thoughts are on right now, I would tell you that hearing you say all that…” Cas shakes his head, smiling shyly. “Makes me indescribably happy.”
“Listen,” he insisted, scowl firmly in place. “I don’t think it’s any surprise to you that you and Cas aren’t exactly The Brady Bunch. But,” he paused. “I know you’ve shown up for him before. When it really mattered.
“Don’t be crude,” he muttered, grateful—not for the first time—that he didn’t tend to fidget when uncomfortable.
“Ever since I got my book deal, I’ve had moments where it truly hits me—how lucky I am to be able to pursue my dreams and support myself. It’s not something most people have the means to do. But it’s only occurring to me now that I haven’t done much to pay that forward. Once I know the long-term success of
“I’m serious. You told Ben ‘everything.’ What does that mean? What was his response? If he was upset, I doubt he truly got over it that quickly.”
The sound of boots on tile prompts me to turn around mid-chorus. “Got Bobby and Thing 2 all set up?” I ask Sam, as he emerges from the nearby hallway.
I am. That’s why I’m holding one of those ridiculous airport pillows and scoping out which of the flight attendants looks most willing to join the mile-high club.”
. I know we’re not exactly the kind of couple that compares diaries every night, but this isn’t something that slipped your mind.
I figure that might be closing arguments. I’m about to pretend to “wake up” and demand we get some grub when a slight tension warns me that the two men in the front are about to have a ‘moment’ that will probably make my tooth ache. And, hell, I’m not getting in the middle of that.
Castiel tended to think that he was in shape. But jogging or doing taekwondo for the sake of exercise was completely different than hauling dozens of boxes up three flights of stairs to dump them in an apartment where he had no place to sit. Each breath felt sharp in his chest and left the vague taste of blood in his mouth.
on Netflix. They were in the middle of an episode when they got done with dinner and somehow staying on the couch to finish it turned into watching two more.
“I mean, maybe?” Dean sounded genuinely unsure. “To be honest, I’ve been in LA so long, having any kind of conversation with someone new that revolves around me, Dean Winchester, not—you know—what I do for a living, is pretty fuckin’ strange. But I don’t
How he believed he had his feelings all under control until that day “you told the really bad joke about… mimes, I think it was?” Cas murmured, with a tilt of his head.
"And a coffee table that looked like it was made from part of a bar counter." - I picture Pamela in a bar because she showed up in Ash's Roadhouse Heaven in "Dark Side of the Moon" (5x16)
The young doctor had also confirmed the presence of drugs in Cas’s tea, which he said had only failed to render him unconscious immediately because the sedative used wasn’t meant to be heated. Trace evidence from the mud in the kitchen also revealed black bear scat. Considering the relative rarity of black bear sightings in Kansas, except for in wooded areas on the border with Missouri, it is likely that the Angel Killer lives or regularly hikes in the forests. Of course, that only limits things to a few million acres.
“Jack said he wanted to see something from every genre. Plus, I think it will be good for him—Cas too—to watch, you know, normal human interactions. Something that
He swallowed. “Uh, it’s not. I—” just have this friend who’s crazy about them. “—really love this bacon. Is it beef?”
“Most people grow accustomed to their own scent to the point they can’t smell it anymore, so that wouldn’t be my problem. However, fish heads have gills, not lungs, and since I would prefer to live on land, I’d have to agree that half-centaur is the better choice.”
Balthazar then pointed at the man directly in the center of the U. “That’s Mo, our director. Bit of a bastard and impossible to understand most of the time--”
“His eyes really are that green,” Wendy said in awe. Then, she quick-glanced over at the author and flushed further. “Please don’t tell him I said that.”
That’s when my less-good looking twin shows up, something of John Winchester’s judgments in his eyes. I take a half step backward. Cas clears his throat. He turns his body halfway between him and me, which helps soften Other Dean’s posture—but not mine. “Since there are more of us now, it will be harder for me to maintain the concentration necessary to project into both of your minds. Plus, I had to find a way for you--” Cas nods to me, “to contribute memories as well. I’ve modified the spell on the crystal to hold thoughts instead of souls, so we can then project them around us.”
It was well past midnight, Castiel could tell without even looking at the clock—and they were both too strung up to attempt penetrative sex right now, no matter how intensely he thought they’d both enjoy it.
Cas instantly seems skeptical. “This question is non-applicable to me. I am already several millennia over 90 and have had no problem utilizing vessels regardless of the age or gender--” He looks down at his white button-down shirt and black slacks, the oversized clothing hiding a body that, Dean has seen from glimpses, is surprisingly tan and muscular. “I suppose I have grown rather fond of this shape, however.”
Figuring that this was too much to worry about before coffee, he lumbered to his feet. And then, since he was already up, he decided to start on breakfast, using the way-too-expensive ingredients that Sam had made fun of him for.
“If you say so. I’ve been married to my girl forty-three years, and I’m still learning new ways I can mess up,” he confesses, nodding in the direction of a woman with once-blonde grey hair, watching a litter of kittens running around in circles inside a playpen.
he thinks but doesn’t say. He doesn’t know anything about these people—hasn’t even opened his eyes to look at them—but the one closest to him is
Dean tried tugging him back. “Wait, wait. I—” He let out an exasperated sigh. “Dude, you know that when it came between choosing him and choosing to stay in my nice, safe closet, I chose the closet, right? And that I
“We’re keeping our finger on the pulse of public opinion,” Charlie huffed. “It just so happens that that pulse is a little bit, uh—elevated—at the moment.” She and Gabriel exchanged not-so-secret smiles.
that Cas had taped to one wall. It was something he tended to work on during periods of writer’s block. “I think 18 across is ‘Purgatory’,” the taller man said, tapping a spot high enough up on the poster that Cas couldn’t even read it. Cas had enough faith in Sam to let him fill it in with pen.
“Well, seeing as I’ve answered, you may go now,” he told the intruder, attempting to swing the door closed again. The creature blocked him by sticking one of its neon-colored feet through the opening.
” Cas said in the exact same tone as the last time, except now he waited for the actor to look at him.
Soon enough, Dean was helping Castiel into his reflective vest and tightening the belt holding the hip holster for his laser gun in place, while Castiel remained resolutely still. “Feel OK?” Dean asked, two fingers under the strap around his shoulder.
And talking to John Winchester about anything besides how much whiskey was left and whether or not all the guns were clean was pretty much like swinging a punching bag and then letting it swing back and hit you in the face. Even
“Just because there are other extenuating circumstances doesn’t mean I don’t deserve the censure,” Castiel pointed out.
Jack once again looks at Dean’s arm around Cas’s shoulder. Dean, seemingly noticing it himself for the first time, jerks it away, causing Cas to noticeably frown. “We’re nothing like that,” Dean insists. Green eyes turn in his direction. “Back me up here, Sammy.”
Cas automatically looks down at himself, where his ring is still safely tucked away beneath his clothes. Then he realizes that she is talking about the ring on
Castiel wiped crumbs off the side of his mouth with his hand and shrugged. “I can’t tell him what I don’t know myself. The original novel was meant to be a standalone. I’m still… formulating what comes next.” He knew this was something that he should worry about—
If Dean looks now, he can still see it in his brother’s face—the longing for that other life, where he had a college degree and Jess to come home to…maybe even a few kids chasing after a dog in a suburban yard. And
Somehow, neither of them noticed Gabriel until he was right beside them. “Well helloooo Cassie.” He looked Dean up and down, “Cassie’s boy toy.”
Sam is feeling a bit like a creeper, hovering outside of the men’s dressing rooms just in case Cas needs help—and an old lady eyeing him suspiciously proves he’s not
Dean used to complain about how often that Cas did that, in fact—but it was a lot of why they’d grown so close so quickly. It was also part of what Castiel felt like he was special to Dean.
have some things to hold over Crowley, but nothing that could reverse time and stop the other man from having the soulmark picture in the first place. Meaning they couldn’t
Sometimes, when Dad would go off on hunts, leaving us in a motel room for days at a time, I would sneak out after Sammy had gone to sleep to play arcade games. Not the most responsible babysitting—and I’d feel guilty as hell afterward—but still… I just needed to breathe air that hadn’t been recycled through my own lungs a million times already—to look at something other than the color
A glance to the side showed some familiar-looking employees hiding behind a stack of soup cans and the other patrons around them trying too hard to act casual.
And apparently whatever is tying him to Cas is still active so, when he dreams, it is of a hospital bed with itchy sheets. Of too-bright fluorescent lights and the smell of antiseptic. He watches Cas put on a brave face for his doctor and nurses even though he feels more vulnerable than he has in years—decades. Every shadow seems suspicious, every sound has his neck prickling with a false sense of danger.
He was less prepared when Sam threw it back, causing it to glance off the actor’s ear and onto the floor. “If we get ants, I’m blaming you,” Dean muttered, stabbing the air in Sam’s direction with his fork.
I went back and added these after I realized they were popular partway through the story. There's a chance I missed some so feel free to shout out in the comments. (In general, I don't include references to people as Easter eggs since very few people in this story aren't in canon).
Cas wraps up by giving a general description of his abilities—healing, smiting, dream-walking, optional mind-reading.
“I could… introduce you?” Castiel offered, almost positive that was the right thing to say in this situation. However, Sam’s nervous look didn’t give him any reassurance.
"When I imagine who I want me and Jess to be someday, it’s... Bobby and Ellen.” - Bobby and Ellen were married in the alternative universe in "My Heart Will Go On" (6x17) and I thought they made a really sweet couple. Although Samantha Ferris sucks.
The author flinched at his cousin’s crudeness. “I want Dean in my life—whatever form that comes in.”
“Why?” I demand, crossing my arms over my chest. “You think that, once I get to know my Castiel, I’ll change my mind?”
“He’s that aware of his grace? I thought it was like blood or your soul—you don’t really notice it until it’s missing,” Sam interrupts, eagerly.
Dean’s slightly nervous expression rearranged itself into a smirk. “Just like that, huh? You didn’t even hear what I was gonna suggest…”
“To be honest, the one time Dean and Sam took me out, I was back in the Impala reading a book with a flashlight after the first 30 minutes. But they just stood there—for four or five hours, maybe. Never spoke a word to each other,” she told Castiel.
He smiled before turning on his heel and leaving. And Dean—Dean was halfway caught between calling him back to ask what the hell he meant and feeling relieved that whatever ‘moment’ they’d just had was over.
He glimpsed only the basics—a large bed, double nightstands, a flat-screen TV—before dropping his duffel bag next to Dean’s beside the closet. For good measure, he kicked off his shoes to match the actor and then sat down on Dean’s bed like it was something he’d done a thousand times before.
could have gone out. You know, someplace where there’s loud music and someone asking you if you want refills every five minutes. You know,
“I see I’m going to have to file a sexual harassment suit against you before this is all over,” Dean grumbled, but Castiel thought he seemed pleased by the news, which was better than the alternative.
—” He pressed another key and a second picture appeared slightly below the first. It was Castiel and the Winchesters the same day at a dim sum restaurant. Dean had forgone the use of chopsticks to eat his pork bun with his hands—and in this photo, his cheeks were stuffed full. Meanwhile, Cas looked on in amusement and Sam shook his head in reproach.
Castiel hasn’t been able to follow a lot of what’s going on—but he grasps that last part, at least, and instantly starts crab-walking back to a corner of the room. “No, no, no, no….”
“Here,” he says, taking a folded-up piece of notebook paper from his pocket and handing it over to Dean. “It’s my list—my answer to the question.”
He stepped up to Dean to brush his cheek again—and it felt like a taboo—like touching one of the great masterpieces at a museum.
“I didn’t mean… that,” Dean specified with an almost-cough and a blush. “Just, uh, you’ve always stood close before. Seems kinda weird for you to change your mind now.”
“Whatcha talking about?” one of the Deans speaks from the background. “Bobby loves us. We’re adorable.”
“I… think that’s something I should ask him about later. Once I’ve had more of a chance to prove myself.”
The woman who asked the question flashed an unwitting smile, so he guessed he’d accomplished his goal.
find Cas pretty quickly—leaning against a pillar-like thing in the geography section. The actor’s borrowed shirt stretched across his shoulders and Dean had to admit, he looked good in it. Better than when Cas wore his own slightly oversized clothes.
“Uh huh. And what happens when we get this guy’s medical records? If they contain his soulmark, standard procedure is to run that through the system for any matches.”
He rests his forehead down against the hardwood, trying to level out his breathing. The worst part is that his brain won’t shut up for five minutes. And it’s not even doing anything useful—like going over the case. Of all things, it’s bringing up this stupid dinner he had with Sam a few years ago.
finish that sentence,” Meg responded, sharply, and Castiel instantly shut his mouth. “No matter what you’re gonna say, I’ve heard it before and that shit’s about making you feel better. Not me.”
“Jack,” Sam says instead. “It looks like you’re almost out of popcorn. Why don’t you come with me to make some more?”
“Sam is very intelligent—and far from impulsive,” he said instead. “Admittedly, I don’t know Jessica very well, but I’m sure they will think long and hard before coming to any major relationship decisions. And at least, so far, they seem compatible.”
“We should find some other people to play against next time,” Sam said, fingers running through his slightly sweaty hair as they poured out the door. “I think the three of us would make a pretty good team.”
Baby rumbles approvingly once we’re out of town and on the open highway. The wind in my face from the open window does me some good too.
have one argument in his favor up his sleeve—literally—it wouldn’t be right to bring that up here with people who actually know and love Cas. So, instead, he blurts out, “The Angel Killer murdered my mom!”
Gabriel typed quickly, eyes roaming over the screen like he was reading something. “Looks like, at the moment, he’s picking up the squirt from school.”
Dean has made his heart stop enough times to be intimately familiar with the sudden, painful halt of all the blood in his body. But it’s OK, it doesn’t mean anything—he’s happy when Cas and Sam are happy, too—he just doesn’t say it like some impassioned monologue from Dr. Sexy.
cars. Although I do know how to hotwire one.” Dean’s steps faltered. Castiel’s stopped with him. “It occurs to me that I probably shouldn’t have admitted that to someone I just met.”
“I’m not--” he yells back, eyes squared in my direction. “I’m—I’m you. An older you. I think…you both time traveled.”
“I—yes—I’ve… heard that.” Possibly in a movie somewhere. It’s not like he had any real relationship experience outside of Dean to compare it to, and he’d always used to tune out when his friends or relatives started speaking on the topic. “I hope you end up… pleasantly surprised.”
hoped he wouldn’t be invited to sit down for fear that he would mess up the magazine spread before him.
“Why would we require contraceptives?” Cas asks, head leaning to the side like the Tower of Pisa and yes, Dean absolutely wants to go die in a hole now. “We’re both male—and even if I didn’t regularly heal you, this vessel cannot pick up sexually transmitted diseases.”
recognize us.” There was a slightly nervous quality in Dean’s voice—an acknowledgment that he wasn’t quite sure how the two of them were supposed to work now either.
“Good,” Dean declared. “You shouldn’t be proud of being a dumbass,” he finished in an echo of what Charlie had said earlier. Castiel couldn't decide if he was pleased by the reassurance or annoyed at his boyfriend's word choice. “Benny’s, you know, an important part of my past—and a good friend—but the days of us having hard-ons for each other is long past.”
“Michael was blonde as a child, but his hair darkened with age. Green eyes, strong jaw.” Castiel hesitated, “Freckles.”
” Dean answers with conviction. “But we’re also looking for this man,” he flashes Lucifer’s photo again. “Do you remember who this is?”
Not in the Impala’s lovingly cared-for way, but almost sterilized, like it just rolled off the car lot. Cas didn’t like it.
Dean shakes his head. “If they’re risking all that, there’s got to be an endgame. So, what if it’s all underground right now? It’s like—those bugs. You know? The loud, pissy ones that only show up every 17 years or whatever?
To be honest, I was surprised all four of them agreed to go on this little road trip. I'm even more surprised that everyone seems to be getting along—even if taking two cars probably helped.

It’s one of those theater-like classrooms, with rows of seats arranged in a half-circle around the professor’s podium—each row rising higher towards the ceiling. He takes the carpet-lined steps two at a time before plopping down into a chair in the farthest back corner, where he immediately hides his face behind one of his notebooks.
I think of the lie I prepared before closing the inches between us—that I was playing the role that he’d assigned me. There was no reason to take it that far, of course, but giving him a guileless look and an “I don’t understand you humans” would probably get me out of it without too many consequences.
Eventually, the angel huffs at my continued silence, and it’s almost enough to make me smile. Because, yeah, he wants me, but I obviously annoy the shit out of him, too—which is just safer ground for everyone.
Dean thinks, struggling to get his head up past the line of his shoulders to relieve some of the aching pressure sitting right at the base of the skull. He only manages to raise it about an inch.
He knew what Star Wars and Lord of the Rings were now, thanks to Charlie—had realized strip clubs were not the place for him thanks to Gabriel—and learned that he was resilient, all on his own. If he wasn’t, he wouldn’t have been able to take the 78 rejections that he got for his first novel—the one he had poured his heart and soul into—and start all over again with a new concept. So, yes, it was safe to say that despite spending four years on a pre-med degree he would likely never use, the time had been a learning experience.

Truthfully, he couldn’t blame her. They’d been at this for about half an hour already and it was clear her hostess’s smile was wearing thin. He wasn’t going to admit that though. “Yeah, I
Castiel had gone from drawing on his couch to actively picking at a loose strand near one of the buttons. Dean allowed him the moment of silence, even though Castiel could
His insides were coiling tighter. At the same time, Dean’s hardness was becoming just a little stiffer in his mouth. The hitches in both of their breaths and the stuttering movement of their hips all signaling one thing.
That didn’t mean the matter was dropped though. He was fully prepared to tell Dean that he was thoughtful and good every day until Dean believed him… and then continue telling him every day afterward.
“Then they have all of my photos,” he finished, the dread he’d been feeling going from a liquid to a solid in his stomach.
—the place he walks around in Batman boxer shorts and three-day-old stank because he can’t be bothered to take a shower. He once sang Taylor Swift karaoke on the map table—admittedly when no one was around. It’s one of the places he’s most comfortable in the world—and that shouldn’t change just because he “came out” to his brother. Not that that’s really what he did.
Both Deans and Cas had been continuing their little memory sessions on the road. Which means not only does younger Dean now know that Ruby was alive in 2008 and that my past self was working with her, but he’d finally caught up to the part about me drinking demon blood—as seen through Dean’s own hazy recollections of Jimmy Novak and how I exorcised his wife. He’d gotten pissed at both me and Cas that night.
“Keep in mind, you only get three clues,” Aaron explained, slipping out of the ‘story’ as he addressed the room at large. “We encourage you to pick things up, move them around—unless they’re nailed or glued down, which should be pretty obvious. Now, are there any questions or do you just want to get started?”
There is a sinking feeling in Castiel’s stomach from the moment he sees his fellow interns gathered around a different table than usual in the hospital cafeteria. It only gets worse when he hears their laughter. Even Meg, whose expressions of amusement stop at smirking, has that dangerous sparkle in her eyes that usually means that someone she dislikes has been fired publicly—or an ex-boyfriend has shown up in the ER with a fork buried in his thigh. He really should consider getting some better friends….
Dean’s nose almost—but not quite—slid down the side of Cas’s face. “‘Course, this mark stuff seems only slightly better than a mood ring—without the decoder sheet. Just because you were upset didn’t mean it had anything to do with me. Maybe you stubbed your toe.”
And yet, when he went to bed that night in a new apartment, in a new city—his mattress on the floor in the living room since he hadn’t yet bought a frame—he quietly admitted that it was comforting to see a familiar face.
“Seems he was questioned in the death of a fellow college student by the name of Jessica Moore. Just as a witness but--”
“Look,” I tell him. “I don’t want you to get the wrong impression. Dean and Cas are solid. Everyone from angels to demons has tried to use them against each other and they’ve never succeeded. In fact, outside pressure only tends to bring them closer.
“I can’t say for sure how I would have reacted if your mark had been missing. But the logical conclusion to draw would be that an angel—another angel—had healed it. And if you claimed not to know how it happened, I might have believed you were hiding information from me. Not feeling like I could trust you might have prevented me from trusting you as much in return.”
based on past trends for celebrities in a similar situation to yours, they’re likely to improve the more you and Cas are seen spending time together—so long as you and Lisa don’t go nuclear in the process,” she tacked on carefully.
“Don’t be an idiot, Cas,” I say, meeting his eyes in the rearview mirror so he knows I’m serious. “She probably just timed it to the start of the Apocalypse stuff is all.”
“We started digging around for the most absurd contract clauses that have ever been upheld in court. You know, for inspiration.” Gabriel pointed at the screen again, where the literary agent looked like he had steam coming out of his ears.
Anyway, this chapter did not go where I intended it to go--which was to get through the bench scene at least--but then I was watching the episode and the lip-licking could not go unmentioned, so...stuff happened.
The kid sits in the middle of the floor, zooming his Millennium Falcon replica through a minefield made of Legos.
“I—back when Naomi was brainwashing me,” Cas begins, shoulders hunched. “She had to have some way of making sure that I was—I guess ‘finished’ is the best word. That I was completely under her control, so she—” He looks up from his hands to watch Dean carefully. “She created these doppelgangers of you…and she had me practice killing them—over and over—'til I did it without questioning.”
“Gross, Dean,” he tells his brother, shoving him slightly, but he decides he’ll be glad for the company.
“I was going to give it to you, obviously. I just… hadn’t yet.” In fact, only two people had it; and he figured Dean could get it through Sam if necessary.
sounds kind of weird. “Wait for me,” Dean says instead, which is hardly better. Cas nods and turns, and Dean catches a glimpse of Jimmy Novak’s back muscles through the thin material of Cas’s dress shirt.
Suddenly, Dean looks up. His green eyes scan the room, flickering over where she and Alyssa sit, and she holds her breath, waiting.
He remained lost in thought until a mug was set down in front of him, steam wafting directly up his nose. For lack of anything else to do, he took a sip, though the drink was currently more a temperature than a flavor.
He climbs into the bed. There are too many blankets. The top one is scratchy, with a swirling pattern made of stitches that he traces with his finger. He’s only ever had a sheet. The pillows are so soft that they curve up to completely cover his ears when he rests his head on them.
Dean tries to find fault with his partner’s argument, but ever since they picked Brady up, it’s been hard to think anything except
She pauses, biting her lower lip. “Let me correct that. I actually know nothing—less than Jon Snow nothing. Including what his soulmark looks like or what your soulmark looks like. Or why the soulmark scans sent with his medical records came digitally corrupted. And considering I have so much other information to process for this case, I think it makes sense to focus on what will get us closer to the Angel Killer rather than spending time trying to recover this probably-inconsequential file that, again, I know nothing about.”
anything change that either. Because it occurs to me that a lot of what makes me different than the douchebag drinking all my whiskey in the kitchen—a lot of things that I like about myself and a few of the things I dislike, too—are because of the angel sitting across for me. He said that I had to learn to trust Sam during the Apocalypse. But I had to learn to trust him, too.
Dean risks brushing a kiss to the side of his neck, thrilled by the slight shudder that races through Cas’s body at the fairly innocent touch. “Good night,” he whispers, into what seems like almost-unbreakable quiet.
Cas’s returning smile would be considered small on a normal person, but, on him, it is practically beaming. And it’s over such a small thing. Seeing it simultaneously makes Dean happy and a little guilty, because it reminds him he could probably put that smile on his face more if he tried. “So…what’s the next question?” he asks to give his mind something else to think about.
and places it in Dean’s lap, back cover up so that Dean can read the description, “With his relationship to Crowley exposed to Sam, Dean, and Bobby, Castiel ponders the ongoing civil war with Raphael and the decisions that lead him to this point.”
“That just means I’m not ableist or whatever. Someone gets too close to Baby—I don’t care who you are—you’re getting some cuss words and the finger.”
“I do,” he insists, lifting his hand up almost as if he were going to smooth his fingers through my hair again. I exhale sharply and he abruptly stops. Curls his fingers in towards his palm. Drops his arm back down to his sides. “With some things, I do.”
“Thanks for being so understanding of what is, clearly, a sensitive topic for me. I think I’ll go to bed now,” Castiel huffed, breaking the seal of Dean’s arms by turning on his side and pulling the blankets up around him.
He’s got to admit though, that, based on looks alone, the dude is not what he would have expected. He seems… pretty normal for someone who named himself like an emo garage band. Admittedly, he’s a bit hungover, but his blonde hair is kept in short spikes that are obviously the work of product and his brown overcoat matches his professional-looking loafers.
Behind them, other cars are also starting to head out in various directions, while the helicopter circles over the area like an angry hawk. Naomi will have to figure out who to follow. Depending on how much fuel she has, maybe she’ll have to land soon and lose track of everyone.
“I mean, if you just felt like putting on a show, that’s cool. But at least let me turn on some music and grab a beer first,” the actor tacked on, jerking his thumb in the direction of the kitchen.
“That’s…unexpected. I’m really sorry to hear that,” Brady sympathizes with an appropriate-and-not-at-all-genuine voice of concern. “Shall we…go to my office?”
Sam can tell what Jack is going to say before he says it. It’s the first time he’s felt truly psychic in years. And yet, knowing doesn’t make the moment any less satisfying. “You and Castiel do,” the Nephilim responds with a tilt of his head, as Dean and Cas freeze, and Sam digs his nails into the arms of his chair. Even the bunker seems like it is listening hard.
I have on pause and the clawfoot bathtub I discovered on the second floor. “Just saying, there’s no need to do a half-assed job on my account.”
is really not gonna go down well. “She was almost-accidentally about to end the world…” OK, I am saying this in the worst way possible and now there’s really no way to stop. “And so, I got loaded up with a bunch of souls that were set to explode inside me and take us both out. But, uh, she and her brother ended up having a talk—and she realized that the destruction of all life on Earth was not really what she wanted, so everything is cool now. Also, I think she brought you two here as a parting gift for me.”
Dean pointed a finger at Sam. “You, don’t encourage him.” He swung the finger toward Gabriel. “You, stop hitting on my little brother.”
“You want me to ask my body’s biological daughter if I look naked when wearing a shirt and trousers,” Cas asks in disbelief, but he does, thankfully, slip his arm through his sleeves again.
“Excuse me,” Dean scoffed, offended. “Have you seen me eat?” He gave Cas a once-over. “Have you seen
Cas narrows his eyes, clearly processing Dean’s response, but then gives a slow nod. “I think he is—but I guess I’ll just have to wait and see what happens.”
secretly sleeping together, so… the staring deeply into each other’s eyes thing—is kinda not helpful.”
However, he’d only gotten a few steps away before he rolled the cart backward—"Thanks for these,” Dean told Wendy, grabbing one more cocktail weenie on a toothpick off of her plastic tray and winking. “Cas? I’ll meet you by the checkout in fifteen.”
