“Uhm, no. I’m here to watch someone dance,” John answered.
"Right. Time to suit up."
Trying not to feel rejected, John allowed the rest of the ride pass in silence, mulling over Sherlock’s queer mood. Sadly, he realised that Sherlock was possibly not used to allowing others to take care of him, especially when he was feeling vulnerable and nervous. John promised to himself to take it slow, to allow Sherlock to gradually get used to the idea that he was allowed to be cared for and was allowed to show his worry instead of holding it in.
to talk to about it? Because your dad would only smack you around a bit or laugh at you, your mother liked to pretend everything was okay, and your
John smiled at Sherlock in the mirror and turned off the faucet. “I just thought cause it’s your birthday, cake would be in order. But first I think a cup of tea first.”
“I know, I know. I never expected to do this and I hate myself for it. I brought it on myself! And now he’s found out I’m engaged and –“

“He doesn’t want to see you,” she said, resolute in her words. “You need to go
. I was
Sherlock was suddenly very aware that John was no longer paying attention to his excited blathering, but instead he was sitting looking exceptionally gormless as he stared up at Sherlock, admiring every detail on his face.
John used his thumb so trail across Sherlock’s lips, feeling the soft flesh that was so pliant under his fingertips. Sherlock’s blush increased as he allowed John’s fingers to graze over his mouth, pulling his plump lower lip down slightly.
“You told me you loved me,” John said, trying to make him see; to make him remember.
“How—how did you know where my work is?” John asked, almost at a whisper.
John didn’t need to be told twice. He moved into Sherlock’s space and tenderly placed a soft, urgent kiss on Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock responded in kind, screwing his eyes shut as he shakily pressed his lips into John’s. He tasted familiar and yet entirely new; he was like a book that had been sitting on the shelf for too long, untouched, finally opening its pages for him. John moved his hands into Sherlock’s hair, running his fingers through the silky curls, savouring the feeling. He wanted to exist in this moment, hovering in the state of bliss as his tongue delved into Sherlock’s mouth, tasting tea and honey. Tasting
“I don’t know what I’m doing wrong!” John groaned. He was frustrated as well, considering he was the one who had to repeat the moves over and over while Sherlock seemed to have criticism for everything he did. “Sherlock, I don’t know what I’m doing! This is pointless!”
his shoulders, allowing a small amount of tension to drop from them.
“Come here,” John breathed, his voice cracking with strain. Sherlock continued sucking. “Jesus …
?” Sherlock urged him, feeling slightly lightheaded.
He wasn’t sure why he had called his sister of all people – it wasn’t like they had the most perfect relationship where they could confide in each other when times were tough. The last time they had spoken was over a year ago when their father had suffered from his first stroke, ending up in hospital. Harriet had chosen not to visit and had caused a lot of tension between them, making it difficult for either of them to bridge that gap and contact each other again; it was only now that John had dialled her number and finally taken the first step towards them reconnecting again.
John shifted himself into a more comfortable position, his knees tucked up underneath his chin as he watched Sherlock take him through each step, explaining each movement with intricate detail, enjoying the way Sherlock’s pupils turned his once green eyes nearly black with excitement. John began to feel more and more comfortable with the thought of learning the dance as Sherlock spoke, not because he understood it more, but because he knew Sherlock wouldn’t let him be left behind in learning each step perfectly.
“I’m in Sussex until tomorrow. I’d really like to see you again before I go.” John’s hand delved into his pocket and he pulled out a stray business card that contained his new mobile number. “When you’re ready … if you’re ever ready to forgive me … just let me know. I’ll be waiting.”
“It’s for a wedding.”
John’s stomach lurched as the voice of Sherlock Holmes came from behind him. Turning automatically, John quickly positioned himself in front of the counter, shielding his current transaction. Sherlock was wrapped in his coat with the collar up, green eyes examining John with ease as he shook out his windswept hair which was in fluffy, soft curls. John could see the people in the line behind peering at the tall, statuesque man with something akin to curiosity – the same curiosity John had felt when he had laid eyes upon him for the first time. So it wasn’t just him that could be automatically swept up by this man, but it was John and only John who had managed to acquire his affections.
“Oh,” John let out a breath. “Yeah, no luck so far.”
John was glad to have his face in Sherlock’s neck so he couldn’t see the flush across John’s face at exposing his emotions to him so openly – be it the afterglow of his orgasm or not, John was allowing his heart to be bared for a moment, which he was not used to doing so easily.
Their foreheads came to rest together and suddenly John realised Sherlock had tears falling from his eyes, which was the last thing he wanted to happen.
The pair slowly washed each other; John massaging shampoo into Sherlock’s hair and using body wash to clean off his sweat and semen, moving his hands gently over his skin as if he were painting a picture with his hands. Sherlock closed his eyes, enjoying the feeling of being cared for, the feeling of John’s fingers massaging into his muscles tenderly. No one had touched Sherlock as lovingly and as warm as John was right at that moment.
“- and stay where you are.”
“Sorry?” John laughed.
Oscillation on the pavement and bare feet.
This couldn’t be happening. John breathed out Sherlock’s name, almost a protestation, and suddenly, John couldn’t help himself. He rushed up to Sherlock and placed his hands on the sides of his face, clutching onto him the way the shore held onto the ocean, with urgent fingertips, wanting all of him before he receded once again. Sherlock closed his eyes at John’s touch, tears finally spilling down his face.
He was talking to himself more than John, but John was happy to let him ramble, enjoying the way Sherlock’s eyes would rapidly dart around as if he were reading something in front of his eyes. He watched his lips form around the words, faster than he could think was possible, yet still precisely perfect in their diction.
As the weeks started merging into each other, John told himself every day that he would come clean to Mary, yet each day his cowardice forced the confession into the back of his throat and stuck it there, remaining a secret. He was slowly beginning to feel less like the man he wanted to be and as each day wore on, he became more gutless.
Sherlock placed a hand carefully on the back on John’s neck, using his other to stroke along his arm and back. John responded by gripping tightly onto the front of Sherlock’s dressing gown, pressing himself further into Sherlock’s chest, as if he were trying to disappear.
"You're not going to like it," Harriet said quietly, resuming her attention to his hair. When John remained silent, she continued. "I'm just ... I'm just worried you're making a mistake marrying Mary."
“My sister works just outside of London, so I never really see her,” John decided to omit his wife to be.
“Your movements are like … that of a scarecrow, John. They hold no
“Get used to what?”
betray your trust like that ever again.”
“What, love?” John breathed, entirely numb.
“I don’t want to lose her too.” John spat.
“You’re early,” John stated simply, feeling troubled.
“Mary,” John breathed. “Mary …”
“Oh …” John was taken aback. “Okay. Why?”
Making his way into the foyer, John was immediately overwhelmed by the huge crowd of people, all waiting to enter the theatre and take their seats. He managed to make his way through the crowd up to the front desk where he was greeted by an older woman with short brunette hair and a pair of glasses perched on her pointed nose.
“You’re mad that I told Mrs. Hudson to come up for tea, aren’t you?” John queried, knowing that was the absolute truth. “You wanted this place all to ourselves so we could continue doing this-“
John soon forgot about his embarrassment as Sherlock pulled him in close, their bodies sinking into each other, soon finding their rhythm within the music. And although John could hardly remember the dance Sherlock had taught him so long ago, neither of the men cared – it didn’t matter when Sherlock hands were moving from his waist around to the small of his back with a tender pressure that made John go weak inside. John thought about the fact that he was free to do this for the rest of his life if Sherlock would let him and he couldn’t stop the question springing from his lips.
"Don't you also love Sherlock?"
“Oh! John!”
He hopped into the shower, pondering at Sherlock’s peculiar mood. He had said it was fine last night for him to borrow clothing, so why did he suddenly change his mind? John wondered whether the nightmare Sherlock had woken from was still on his mind and made a mental note to ask whether he would like to talk about it or not. He allowed the water to fall on his back, letting it warm his body, attempting to quell the worry that was pervading him.
“You know, I did have this feeling that something was going on with you, but I didn’t realise it would be something like this …” she narrowed her eyes, a small smile twisting at her lips. “So tell me … who was that?”
They rode in the cab to Sherlock’s home on Baker Street in silence, the air electric with expectation. Without thinking, John placed his hand on Sherlock’s thigh, his fingers tracing out small shapes into the tender flesh that lay underneath the expensive fabric. There was a palpable intake of breath from Sherlock as he felt John’s fingers continue their advances, slowly moving to his inner thigh, inches from his groin. Sherlock wriggled in his seat as John changed from tracing shapes, to tracing out words: first, Sherlock’s name, and then his own. He increased in pressure, a smirk gracing his lips as he watched Sherlock from the corner of his eye becoming more restless. John saw the driver glance into the rear view mirror and avert his eyes immediately, feeling awkward at being privy to this private moment between the two men. They soon came to a stop and John removed his hand, eager to move inside.
“I wouldn’t be able to concentrate if you continued wearing these,” he explained, gently prying one shoe from his left foot. He then removed John’s sock, stuffing it inside of his lone shoe. “You’ll feel better for it, trust me.”
“There’s someone here to see you,” she declared. “Doesn’t have an appointment, but says you know him?”
“Sorry if I woke you,” John whispered.
A recurring nightmare that John had on a regular basis was of him standing on a rocky cliff, staring down at the crashing waves below, and suddenly the water would be sucked back into the ocean, revealing a shadow in the shape of himself standing on the empty shoreline.
“Oh, no I’m not going to stay – much too busy.” Mrs. Hudson tapped her wrist.
(See the end of the chapter for
After ten minutes of John sorting through a few emails on his laptop, Mary made her way into the living room and threw a tea towel at John’s face.
. John wiped away his tears once again, feeling embarrassed.
Sherlock was sitting at the piano, engrossed in a paper in his hands. He had a deep frown on his forehead, his nose creased in between his eyes and at the sight of Sherlock looking
"You're talking about Sherlock, aren't you?" John asked, turning back so Harriet could finish up with his hair.
“No, no, no, this is
“Yeah, I love you too, Mary. See you when I get back.”
,” the woman admonished Sherlock, stopping him on his way up the stairs. “Don’t be so rude! I’ll bring up some tea.”
.” She gushed.
A low spotlight suddenly illuminated Sherlock’s lone figure, standing in the middle of the stage – his head was hanging down so his curls were falling in front of his face, obscuring him from the crowd. John thought he looked naked, but on closer inspection he realised he was bare chested, his taut muscles moving with every breath he took, and on his lower half were a pair of skin tight, flesh coloured men’s ballet tights that were high waisted, just reaching his belly button. He wore a pair of flesh coloured ballet shoes on his feet which were scuffed from use over the years he had owned them. In his dancewear, John marvelled at just how sculpted his body was – each muscle toned and shaped from years of dance.
As the effects of his orgasm slowly melted away, John lowered himself to sit down in the shower. He looked at his hand where he had bitten down and saw the fleshy skin pooling with a little bit of blood. He was exhausted, still a little bit drunk, and …
the man he was very nearly having an
“Mm, could say that.”
“You haven’t seen anything yet,” John spoke. His tongue flicked out, licking the soft curve of Sherlock’s cupid’s bow. His voice was almost a growl. “Inside.
John slowly continued stroking him, watching his face as he did so which was contorting into an almost pained expression, the wrinkle in his nose that John loved so much making an appearance. “Where are your manners, Sherlock?” John admonished.
“Just a nightmare,” John sniffed, moving his hands up to cover Mary’s. He gave her hand a squeeze and moved his lips onto it, allowing her comforting touch to envelop him. John closed his eyes, feeling more tears silently fall onto his pillow, before he felt himself slipping into the in between state of sleep and eventually his tears abated.
.” Mary’s sharp voice cut through his reverie. “I’ve been talking to you for the past five minutes – have you heard
John glanced at Marlene, who had returned to her desk. She was watching the pair with great curiosity, wondering at who this attractive, peculiar man was. John quickly ushered Sherlock into his office, wanting to get out of earshot of Marlene, who had the biggest mouth John had ever encountered.  All you had to do was tell one thing to Marlene and somehow everyone within a ten mile radius would know about it within the hour.
,” Sherlock moaned, pushing himself down further onto John’s hand. He could hardly believe how good this felt, how much he wanted, how desperate he was to have all of John.
The first night John had slept in Sherlock’s bed, they had just finished a particularly gruelling case involving two missing children that were found dead in a zoo. The detective and his partner had eventually found the father to be the murderer, with the mother knowing all along it was him and covering for him. It had shaken John to his core and although Sherlock liked to act as though he wasn’t bothered, John could see the trouble etched across his face. He could see it in the way Sherlock sat a little closer to John in the cab ride home. And he could see it in the way Sherlock’s witticisms were running a little thin.
Sherlock pulled back and made a motion to move back into his chair, but John held his hand, stopping him.
,” Sherlock sighed, dropping the sheet. “I don’t know how to change my sheets. Mrs. Hudson usually does it for me. Happy now?”
.” Sherlock commanded, gesturing vaguely.
John didn’t know why, but he suddenly couldn’t stop the words from escaping his lips. He had been holding it in for so long, that he was almost revealing it to himself as well as Sherlock.
“Uh, yeah. Plans changed.” John didn’t know what excuse to give her, so he muttered: “Work.”
Sherlock turned around and roughly grabbed John by the hand, pulling him around to the seat of the piano and pushing him down so he was sitting. Sherlock stood over him and used one of his feet to push John’s legs open further so he could stand in between them and leaned in, resting his hands either side of John so they sat on the piano keys behind him, sending a noisy mess of chords echoing through the studio. The noise mixed with the music that was still playing creating a frenzy of sounds that seemed to match the passion John and Sherlock were currently displaying. Kissing John deeply, Sherlock’s tongue searched his mouth, wanting to taste every inch of him.
Sherlock’s bottom lip quivered and he closed his eyes, letting a few tears fall down his pale cheeks.
“Not at all - go right ahead.” Sherlock answered as he gestured towards the bathroom. John flashed a quick halfhearted smile at Sherlock before he turned and walked towards the bathroom, leaving Sherlock standing on his own, feeling . . .
He expected Harry to blow up, to slap him, to tell him what a complete idiot he was, but instead she did none of those things, she only blinked at him, her mouth left open. John took another sip of his drink before continuing, wanting to fill the silence that was stretching out before them.
?” she repeated.
“Sherlock … I’m getting married. And you’re moving to Sussex.” John pulled his arm from Sherlock’s grip and breathed in, steadying himself. “I have to go … I’m sorry.”
“Right,” she nodded and stood aside, gesturing in the direction of the door. “I guess you’ve got some preparing to do.”
As the music started building, small drops of different chords melding with the whispering piano, Sherlock kept his head bowed and slowly started lifting his right leg straight upwards to his side. He reached his arm out and grasped onto his foot, which was curled over into a perfect point, pulling it up higher, his muscles and tendons stretching lithely. And as the music changed to absolute quiet, Sherlock paused where he was, his muscles beginning to twitch faintly with the strain of holding his position.
“Yes!” Sherlock answered a bit too enthusiastically. “Yes, plenty of them!”
John was a mess and he hated the fact that at her soft touch, he found himself closing his eyes and moving into it, his lips brushing her palm. He needed to be told it was all going to be okay and, somehow, Mary’s touch provided that. For a moment, John had left everything behind and he only existed in this moment, allowing himself to not feel like his whole world was crashing around him.
John wanted to slam the door in her pudgy face, but instead he quickly signed the forms and thrust them back at her, pulling his lips into a tight smile.
. Come here, Sherlock.”

"No, she's running a late, so you've got time to relax a bit before we start." Charlotte's cheeks were flushed with excitement. "I can't believe the days finally here! She’s going to
Truthfully, John wanted to tell Sherlock about all the nasty things he had fantasized about doing to him, but he was wary of scaring him off too soon. So instead, he continued to stroke Sherlock’s cock, delighting in the soft moans coming from his throat.
As if she had heard his thoughts, the door opened and Mrs. Hudson stepped over the threshold, a bright blue rain jacket on, her hands laden with two rubbish bags.
,” he spoke, almost to himself more than anything. “And your
“Yes, I do.” John answered finally.
“Hungry?” John asked stupidly.
Sometimes John would simply reach out and take Sherlock’s hand in his, pulling it so he could hold it to his chest. Other times Sherlock would whisper out into the darkness, his voice tired: “Hold my hand, I am falling asleep.”
“I’ll be up shortly!” Mrs. Hudson called after the pair.
“I … I guess I should just tell you …” John felt the words on his tongue mixing with the bitter taste of liquor and he sucked his lips together, his trepidation stalling him. Finally, he let the words come. “I’ve been cheating on Mary.”
John wanted to believe it would be as simple as deep fried food and cake, but he knew from experience that life was never that black and white, and this situation with Sherlock wouldn’t simply just disappear. Frankly he didn’t want it to disappear, he wanted way more than what he got that afternoon.
The girl behind John cleared her throat impatiently.
Except that nasty little voice in his head was now screaming:
,” John scolded, feeling mortified. “See, this is why I wasn’t going to tell you in the first place! You—“
She retreated back to her desk, muttering under her breath as John closed the door to his office and threw himself back into his chair, pinching the bridge of his nose between his fingers.
“Sherlock Holmes,” Sherlock said kindly, extending his hand, his eyes staring intensely into John‘s.
felt that way too? He couldn’t remember.
“Yeah, I told Kent that, but he said there was no way of avoiding it. I can drop off the invitations to be posted tomorrow.” Somehow, with every step further into the lie John went, the more comfortable with it he became.
John nodded, glad for the excuse to go to bed and be with his own thoughts. Mary guided him kindly down the hall and when he fell into bed face first, she threw a blanket over him and said something about going to make dinner.
love you in the dark,
,” Sherlock spat out his name amongst desperate moans. “John, I’m going to …”
He reread the programme, his eyes moving over the title, the words repeating over and over again:
Marlene blushed a deep shade of beet red, turning back to her computer hurriedly.
Pulling away, John dropped Sherlock’s hand and took a step back, his hand coming up to touch his lips and feel the echo of Sherlock’s kiss, the taste of him still lingering on his mouth.
John regarded Sherlock before nodding his approval. At this, Sherlock leaned forward –
“Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.” John was lost in thought, thinking about the possibility of telling Mary the whole truth. The thought of losing her was terrifying and it made him itch to have another strong drink, just to settle his nerves.
Mary happily, her light eyes twinkling. “I know,” she answered, excited. “It’s you and me forever after this. Mr and Mrs Watson.”
“Well—“ John wheezed in between desperate giggles. “—I guess they’ll just have to do for now, won’t they?”
Mary nodded, closing her eyes for a brief second before opening them and focusing on John, the bright blue sharp and striking. “I need you to be sure, though. I deserve better than having you walk out on me. I deserve better than you having cold feet on our wedding day, okay?”
John closed his booklet when the lights dimmed entirely, shrouding the theatre in darkness. The din of voices subsided in expectation.
you did, John?” she asked, reeling around to face him. “You were so embarrassing in there! You should have just bloody stayed home if you were going to find planning our wedding so boring!”
“I’m here now, baby.” Mary crooned, placing a light kiss on his neck. “Go back to sleep. I’m here.”
There was a sigh from Sherlock before he blurted out a bunch of words, making it impossible for John to gather what he was saying. “I’mgongtwointervewaniwanyoutocome—“
“No,” Sherlock answered, his eyes briefly flicking to John’s face, then back out the window. Sherlock pulled his hand out from under John’s. “Sorry – a bit warm.”
*by rarely I mean, I've written it once before.
Harriet placed her spoon back into her bowl and threw a pointed look at John, pushing his plate back at him.
They arrived at the platform where the train was already waiting before it departed and John realised Sherlock was no longer beside him. Turning, he found him standing behind a slight way back; his face was dark, echoing his expression last night.
John stayed where he was, unable to move.
John wheeled around and began pacing up and down in front of Harriet, who was watching him in silence. “Is it wrong for me to want to be selfish? Is it so wrong for me to want to stay with the woman I love?”
“You’ve been in a mood all bloody day, so don’t act like I’m the one in the wrong. And if I want to yell, I’ll bloody YELL!” Mary challenged, standing up from the table, taking her half eaten plate of food with her.
“But … the wedding! It’s only four weeks away, John. We still need to confirm the caterers, send out the invitations,
“That was …”
“You okay?” she spoke, her voice muffled into his shoulder as she squeezed him tight. “Quick, come inside.”
He was alone.
the most beautiful person he had seen. He surpassed anything John had ever had the privilege of experiencing in real life..
“Uh … hi.” John said awkwardly, suddenly aware of how creepy it was that he had followed Sherlock to his home.
After they had finished their food, John cleared the leftovers, discarding them in Sherlock’s kitchen. By this time, the sun was beginning to set and the pair were both feeling tired. When John returned to the bedroom, Sherlock had stripped the entire bed, bundling up the sheets on the floor and was fumbling with a new sheet he had pulled from his closet. John watched in amusement as Sherlock, wrapped in a lilac dressing gown, attempted, and failed, at setting the sheet on the bed.
“I thought you would enjoy some strawberries,” Sherlock answered, looking slightly hurt at the less than warm welcome. “You text me earlier saying you felt like them, so here they are.”
John continued sucking, a pleasant hum vibrating his mouth, which produced more moans from Sherlock.
As ever, please let me know what you guys think - any and all feedback is appreciated!
“Sorry,” John offered as he watched Mrs. Hudson taking in the mess on the floor.
“Loosen up …?” John had to laugh. “And what’s that got to do with dancing at all?”
Sherlock let out a groan before stomping upstairs, dragging John with him.
John, feeling enraged, turned around to face Mary. “Why are you marrying me then, Mary? All you seem to have is malicious thoughts about me, so
“Right,” John blushed. “Yes, sorry.”
He glanced guiltily over at Harry who was frowning at him, looking disappointed.
– amazing.”
“Coming home?”
“Harry?” John choked out his sister’s name, clutching the phone to his ear. At the sound of her voice, it was as if a switch had flicked in his brain and he was suddenly feeling the reality of everything crashing down on him.
“Bisexual, gay …” Harriet shrugged. “They’re all the same to Dad, aren’t they?”
"Look lively," she quipped, patting his foot which was concealed underneath the blanket. "Today's the day!"
John, confused, got up and went out into the foyer to find Sherlock Holmes standing, slightly awkward, in the middle of the room, a carton of … was that
John suddenly felt as though his blood had run cold. Sherlock was holding in his hand a familiar piece of card – lace trim, bone white, inscribed with a very familiar cursive: Mary’s writing. Sherlock, whose face was entirely calm, extended his hand that was holding one of John’s wedding invitations to him, but John, feeling as though there were suddenly a million bees buzzing around in his head, couldn’t bring himself to take it from him.
Thank you for reading!
Yawning, John rubbed the sleep from his eyes and slipped from the warmth of his bed, moving to his closet to grab his warm dressing gown.
“You okay?” she looked up from what she was doing, noting the expression on his face.
“You can’t say that, Sherlock.” John said quietly. “Not right now.”
And John knew he had to leave, before he did something he regretted. So he turned on his heel and began slowly walking back to the carpark. He could feel Sherlock’s gaze piercing the back of his head.
“You still want to be with me, yet you
John mumbled something about a shower and he carefully pulled out of Sherlock, taking his hand. Leading him out of the bedroom and to the bathroom, they hopped inside the shower together, letting the hot water wash over them, cascading over their heads. John looked at Sherlock who was standing under the stream of water and he couldn’t help but laugh at the sight of him, hair completely sopping wet and now very straight under the stream of water, swathing his face in wet, tangled tendrils. He had never pictured Sherlock with straight hair, but now that he had seen it, he realised how comical he looked.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I miss you,” Sherlock breathed, his eyes steady on John.
source of light for so many years that it was hard to think of life without her illuminating the way.
“So are …” Sherlock placed his tea on the floor beside him, suddenly very preoccupied with a strand of fabric coming loose on the rug. “Are you and Mary still, uh, together?”
Sherlock was silent for a moment, his lips tasting the words before he allowed them to fall from his mouth. “I’m thinking about kissing you,” he answered purely.
“I brought you a snack,” Sherlock offered, smiling. He briefly added, his face growing slightly red: “You look very handsome in your work attire, John.”
When the music started, he felt as though his heart had stopped beating for a few moments, recognising the melody immediately. The thought of Sherlock listening to the first song they danced together to made John’s heart break again; he pictured Sherlock alone in his bedroom, smiling as he danced by himself with an imaginary John. He remembered the feeling of Sherlock’s skin underneath his fingers as they danced all those weeks ago. The smell of him when he brushed his body up against John. The intoxicating closeness they shared. Under the circumstances, the music now had more depth and sorrow knotted into the chords than he had felt on that first evening with Sherlock.
“I don’t know if Mrs. Hudson told you, but I guess I should tell you myself … I’m sorry, Sherlock. For everything.” As soon as the words left him, John heard how pathetic they sounded and he hated himself for it.
“I don’t remember the moves,” John protested as Sherlock placed his phone on the mantelpiece and pulled John into him, latching onto him firmly.
“How do you know Angelo? You two seem to get along pretty well,” John asked.
“I love you,” John said quietly.
John immediately thought – and pulled one of John’s feet into his lap, undoing his shoe laces.
John blinked slowly and met her gaze and suddenly his face crumpled into anguish, wet mazes of tears tracking down his cheeks.
“You can insert your card,” she answered plainly, ignoring him.
“Please don’t cry,” John breathed, his face inches from Sherlock’s. He extricated his hand from Sherlock’s hair and used his thumb to wipe away the tears from Sherlock’s face.
John tore his eyes away from Sherlock for a moment to look around him at the awed faces of the crowd, each watching Sherlock’s performance, inspired by his exquisite and poetic movements. And as John turned back to Sherlock, watching him stretch his body through each step, painting the darkness around him with his delicate fingertips and curled toes, John remembered Sherlock all those weeks ago telling John how he needed to
. “My sister’s.”  he quickly finished.
They pulled up outside the train station and Sherlock quickly thrust a handful of notes at the driver and silently exited the vehicle. They made their way to the platform walking side by side, Sherlock carrying his overnight bag. John still felt stupid that he didn’t have a change of clothes and almost annoyed at the fact, but he felt it shouldn’t ruin their weekend away, so he decided to leave it.
"What is it?" John automatically brought his hand up to his hair out of fear that she may have messed it up somehow.
However, he knew tomorrow was a new day and with that, he wasn’t sure how things were going to play out. He thought he had a plan, but now that seemed to have been thrown out the window. The wedding was looming closer and John knew he had to decide what to do before it was too late.
John watched Sherlock wipe at his face and smiled inwardly at the messy man. He felt so incredibly fond of this him and when he leaned over to help wipe the food from the corner of Sherlock’s mouth, and Sherlock’s ocean deep eyes peered up at him through his dark eyelashes, he couldn’t stop the words from tumbling from his mouth.
“Very likely, I think. I’m acquainted with the manager, so I have a feeling he will put in a good word for me.”
“What are you thinking?” John blurted out, attempting to decipher Sherlock’s expression, but failing. He was, as he always will be, an enigmatic masterpiece of actions and reactions that would only be allowed to come forth when Sherlock permitted it.
“But it’s so much fun.”
Sherlock broke eye contact with John, lowering his eyes so his dark eyelashes splayed out across his pale skin. His smile broke out across his features, reaching his eyes and nose so they crinkled, revealing a map of lines where Sherlock’s happiness could be traced out.
Sherlock was cut off by John abruptly looking up into his face, all tear tracks and bloodshot eyes. He was still holding onto Sherlock’s shirt with tight fists. “I have
“Here you go, boys. Much more romantic.” He spoke, lighting it and moving off before John could protest. Sherlock simply smiled, taking a sip of his water.
with ease. John thought the performance was beautiful, but he was fairly clueless as to what he was really looking at; taking in the faces of the people around him, he knew they must be doing a good job, because most of the people were smiling gaily at the sight.
“Sorry – sorry.” John mumbled to the old woman as he stood from the bench.
“John … are you drunk?” Mary frowned at him.
John opened his programme, scanning through the performances, his eyes immediately falling on Sherlock’s name, which was second down on the list, meaning he only had to wait through one performance before Sherlock took to the stage. His stomach twisted when he saw the title of Sherlock’s piece: ‘
“What-what are you doing? Why are you doing that?” Sherlock felt vulnerable – he had never seen someone look at him like that before.
Sherlock all but pouted at John, his eyebrows knitting together to form a crease on his nose. “Of course I’m not
that would never happen. Did you not see his hair? He’s an idiot.”
that was now
“Oh!” Mrs. Hudson seemed to jump on the spot at this, her hands coming up to cover her chest in indignation. “I do apologise, John. Perhaps we will need to get to know one another some other time.”
Now, somehow, it felt like a goodbye.
At the end of her soft, slightly off key rendition of the song, she turned him to face her. He knew the jig was up and he would have to give in to this wretched woman, but he kept his lips pursed and forehead in a frown of mock anger. Mary then placed a gentle kiss on the side of John’s cheek, which turned into more kisses until she was eventually planting wet, sloppy ones all over John’s face. He couldn’t help but let out a laugh as she continued her assault.
“No, no, it’s fine. You have any more of that?” John pointed to the practically empty bottle of whiskey that was sitting on the bench.
, sucking the air in between his teeth.
John moved so he was sitting up, his open legs kneeling underneath Sherlock’s so he could lift Sherlock’s legs and angle himself at his entrance. He pressed gently, nudging, and Sherlock sucked in a breath. John raised his eyebrows.
"John.
And god help him, he wasn’t going to give up this moment.
John pulled himself out of her grip and covered his eyes with one hand, exhaling loudly. He was beginning to feel more sober as time went on and he felt ashamed of himself for acting this way in front of Mrs. Hudson.
John hadn’t turned on the ventilation system, so the bathroom was now filling with steam, resulting in him feeling slightly dizzy when he stood up. He held onto the wall for support as he dried himself off with one hand, scrubbing hard at his skin with the towel. There was a light knock at the door and Mary’s voice softly filtered through the wood.
Mary was standing in the car park, her eyes watching John darkly, and he knew she had seen his entire interaction with Sherlock, including their kiss. John hurried up to her, excuses already spilling from his mouth, but she raised one hand to silence him. She was dressed in her bone white wedding dress, looking utterly beautiful, but the expression on her face made her terrifying at the same time. John had never seen her like this.
“Close your eyes –“
incorrect, I suggest you do that with your plants who will be a much better audience and leave us be!”
“I think …”
Sherlock turned to move back onto the couch but John grabbed him by the wrist, turning him back so they were face to face.
Sherlock handed John his tea and sat down smoothly, cross legged in front of John. John turned and sipped his tea, watching Sherlock pull off his shoes and toss them across the room so he was just wearing a pair of black socks. His jumper was rolled up at the sleeves and his hair was sitting in relaxed, long curls, and John marvelled at how soft Sherlock looked in the warm firelight.
“I don’t know if you’ve noticed, John,” Sherlock started, his eyes in a constant motion of gracing over John’s features as if he were memorising the lines on his face, before moving to look at the table, abashed. “I’m not one for letting my heart tell the truth. My world is very black and white. But now …”
“I don’t know, Harriet!” John exclaimed, his hands being thrown in the air with frustration. “All I know is that everything is a fucking great big mess and it’s
Sherlock blushed, his façade of arrogance faltering. He lowered his eyes, feeling abashed.
“No,” he said, his low voice rumbling out soothingly in his ear. “But you don’t need to.”
“John, I’m going to do something now that you must trust me with again.” Sherlock then said, looking at John seriously.
“I like that,” Sherlock whispered, allowing his tongue to move out and taste John’s lips.
Sure, John hadn’t cheated
do me a favour and let me know if you can think of any reason we should continue with this wedding.” he spat, before moving into the living room to sit down to his laptop. John knew he had cut deep because of the silence from Mary. Usually she was quick to retort, but instead all he could hear was her cleaning dishes in the kitchen; her silence was resounding.
,” Sherlock sighed, holding on with every fiber of his being to
“No, no, I was just … I like the valley one.” John quickly answered, pointing to one of the options.
John turned his attention back to Sherlock’s cock and opened his mouth wide, swallowing Sherlock’s length into his mouth. He began moving, gaining momentum, listening carefully to the sounds Sherlock was making so he was sure he was doing the right thing. When John moved back up to the head and began sucking tightly as if he were sucking on a lollipop, Sherlock shuddered underneath him.
Then Mary’s ex David came onto the scene and John being a naturally jealous person decided he was going to pick a fight with him any chance he got. Mary had explained what felt like millions of times that they were
“Yes, yes, alright you can stop laughing now,” Sherlock answered, flailing his hand as if to shoo away the matter. “We’ve got a lot to do today, so rather than you guffawing over your poor choice of footwear, we should get started. But I’m taking you shoe shopping as soon as possible.”
John let go of Sherlock’s hand, placing it back down on the couch and moved up onto his elbow. He watched Sherlock’s face -
“You’re not coming with me,” John said firmly yet kindly. “But maybe once I’ve got some practice I might let you.”
Sherlock cleared his throat, dabbing at his moist lips and flicking his hair to try and regain some composure. “Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock’s voice was hoarse. “I’d like you to meet –“
"Why are you here?" John's tone was more accusatory than he had intended it to be - he was overwhelmed at seeing Sherlock and it felt like he were suddenly drowning with the need to either hug him or run into the nearest bathroom and hide there until he left.
John groaned as she sat down on the end of his bed and yanked the blankets belligerently off his face. He eventually had to sit up, allowing the blankets to fall off him completely, his tired eyes meeting Harriet's.
Sherlock responded in kind, opening his mouth and desperately taking in John’s tongue, a small whine escaping his throat. John wrapped his fingers in Sherlock’s dark hair and with the music swelling in the room, John was feeling more frenzied in his need for Sherlock than ever. He bit down on Sherlock’s lower lip and suckled it, which elicited another whimper from Sherlock.
?” John asked, knowing exactly how she read the situation between John and Sherlock. He wouldn’t have been surprised if she had her ear up against the door while they were alone together.

(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh. Um. Yeah.” John swayed to the side and the room started spinning slightly. “I just, uhm, had a few before I caught the train.”
about our wedding, John.”
“Sherlock,” John murmured, his voice thick with sleep that was aching to take him.
It was a quaint church that Mary had picked and inside were long pews, each with delicate bouquets of Lily of the Valley flowers tied with brown twine at each end. At the head of the chapel was a simple wedding arch, laden with white tulle and twists of green vines and pale pink Baby's Breath.

“Thank you,” John said ardently after sipping his tea.
“It may not mean much, but I’m … sorry?” The words came out like a question – a gentle inquiry into whether or not Sherlock would be willing to accept it.
“Do you mind if I go use the loo?” John asked, rising from the table.
John opened his mouth to automatically deny the truth that Mary was saying, but he faltered, feeling too exhausted to continue his lie.
“I guess …” John said with a grimace. He moved forward, reaching out to touch Sherlock’s hand before thinking better of it and disguising the motion with an awkward sway of his arm. “Are … are you okay?”
“Oh don’t give me that bull,” John stood, taking his drink with him, and moved over to the window, staring out at the traffic below. “You could have picked up the phone and called.”
. John sucked in a breath, steeling himself. He knew he wasn’t going to be able to do this and when he stumbled once, he knew it would be all over. If the bloody room would stop moving, then he would be fine.
He wove his way through the crowd and managed to find his way into the auditorium where there was a respite from the loud hubbub. He found a place at the back of the theatre, perching on his seat nervously, glancing at his watch.
“I see you’re still wearing those
“Sherlock, are you thinking of Sussex?” John asked.
The pair sat down to a light breakfast, although John didn't have much of an appetite, so instead he sipped his tea and pushed his toast around on his plate.
John watched as Sherlock began to search through his pockets for his keys and suddenly decided to take his chance, thrusting money at the driver and dashing from the car, making his way over to Sherlock. His mouth was suddenly dry as he approached him.
For a moment, everything was okay again.
John sucked in a breath before steeling himself and finishing his text.
Sherlock’s moans were echoing through the studio, which was now void of music. John didn’t want to stop; he didn’t want to give in to his conscience. He was sick of listening to his conscience. And yet now, with his thoughts roaming to Mary, his vigour had suddenly left him and he was left feeling empty and guilty. He moved away from Sherlock, pushing past, and stood with his back to him, his face in his hands.
“Are you sure you don’t want to head back and watch the rest?” the blond man asked, curling his arm around Sherlock’s waist.
And when they finally broke apart, Sherlock couldn’t stop the tears from coming and when he opened his eyes, John had a smile on his face that was reminiscent of a piece of music so beautiful he could have lived in that particular moment for the rest of his days.
“Are you going to come in, or are you going to continue standing at the door looking confused?” Sherlock quipped, still sitting at the piano. He took off his glasses and placed them on top.
I’ve been saying?”
But friends don’t feel the kind of attraction John felt for Sherlock. Friends don’t watch their other friend’s lips, greedily taking in the sight, wishing they could bite them, pushing their tongue inside to taste. Friends don’t think about sucking on the white flesh of their friend’s neck, imagining the bruise that would form underneath his mouth. And friends certainly don’t think about burying themselves deep inside their friend’s ass, wondering whether the noises they would make would be soft and needy, or loud and raw and wanton. John was growing hotter as his thoughts grew wilder by the second and he had to bite down on his hand to stop himself from touching himself in bed next to his girlfriend who had fallen back asleep. Suddenly his phone lit up with a text. Opening it up, John let out a quiet groan as he saw Sherlock’s text.
“You and him need to sit down and
The pair walked slowly around to the side of the chapel where there was a small secluded bench overlooking the church garden. They sat side by side on the bench and Sherlock pulled off his coat, revealing a tailored black suit, with a charcoal black shirt tucked into his trousers underneath. His hair had grown longer in John’s absence and it lay in relaxed curls across his forehead, skimming his azure eyes.
Sherlock, entirely distracted, let out a babble of unintelligible words, his face flushed deep red.
Also: John is a bit not good. Sorry bout that.
“A brother whom I don’t see. My parents are retired in Dorset – I try to avoid seeing most of them at all times, however sometimes when the occasion calls for it, it can’t be helped.” Sherlock spoke, cold. “What about yourself? Any family here?”
“Okay, so I tell Mary,” John considered. “Then what? Would Sherlock just take me back?”
“Take off your jacket and let me have a look at you properly,” Sherlock commanded, moving up to John and nearly ripping his jacket off him in a flurry.
you’re beautiful.”
John watched from behind a pillar as the pair continued their conversation in the warmth of the car and after a moment, Lucas leaned over to Sherlock, one hand rising to cup his cheek, and he placed a lingering kiss on Sherlock’s lips. John couldn’t stop himself from becoming insanely jealous at the sight and he had to resist the urge to storm over to the car and punch the blond man’s smug face as he pulled away, smiling coyly.
“Yes … sometimes …” he answered, his voice quiet. When he looked up into her face, he saw Mary carefully processing his words. “Mary, I still want to be with you. I still want to marry you. I … I love you.”
“What did I tell you at our last lesson, Mr. Watson?” he asked, his eyes falling back on John’s face.
John’s mind filtered through every agonising detail of what he would tell her until he fell upon an idea: only a month and a half ago there was an outbreak of a new polio-type virus in England, which was fatal to children. D68 had been rampant among schools, resulting in a few hundred losses, before they got it under control, John having to deal with the aftermath in his area. There were still a few cases filtering around, but nowhere near as bad as before. He could claim there was an outbreak in Sussex and he had to travel there to help with the control of it, as he had done in London. He was sure this would work, considering Mary knew all about the previous outbreak and understood how serious it could be.
Oh god. This again. How could the sound of Sherlock pleading be so damn erotic?
“You look good,” John commented, unsure what else to say.
His anger slowly abated as he walked, washing away with the rain that was on his face and soon he realised he didn’t know where he was going. He looked around and recognized he was on route to Baker Street, so he followed the path there, turning onto the street and watching 221B move closer with every step he took.
“You’re just … the most beautiful person I’ve ever seen,” John offered. “I didn’t think it was possible for me to love someone as much as I love you.”
John threw himself to the ground next to Sherlock and ripped his jacket from his shoulders, pressing it to his wound as the Sherlock’s breathing increased rapidly, his eyes wide with terror and pain.
follow me.”
“Now … it’s almost as if … I’ve found another version of myself when I’m with you. Another world where … I can exist in colour. I don’t want to lose that.”
“I’m staying at the Amba hotel on Charing Cross. Do you think you can make it here in a cab?”
John finally arrived at the hotel, immediately spotting his sister standing out on the sidewalk, and no matter how terrible he was feeling about his situation with Sherlock, he still felt his stomach leap with happiness at seeing her in the flesh for the first time in over a year.
“Sherlock?”
“I said, how’s Mary? Your
Following him down the stairs, John was feeling even more confused; why was he acting so strange? He seemed to be harder to read, more flighty, and a little less Sherlock than usual.
“What’s wrong?” she said, stopping on her way over to him to give him a hug.
“So,” Sherlock began, attempting to add some lightness to his voice. “What’s this about cake?”
“Harry, I didn’t …” John felt himself crumbling again, withering under her gaze. His voice was small and he felt as though he were a child again, being reduced to tears by his father. “I’m sorry.”
. And with only a moment’s hesitation, he opened the door to the studio and entered.
Suddenly, John felt like he couldn’t stop the words bubbling from his throat. “Would you consider trying again, Sherlock? With me?”
“John, I want you to try something for me,” Sherlock spoke, kinder this time, his eyes softening as they watched John’s concerned face. “I’m not going to harm you or shake you about like I did earlier - I just need you to trust me.”
There was a whistle, indicating the train’s imminent departure, and Sherlock picked up his bags, his lips pursed into a tight line, tears threatening to fall from his eyes.
“Yeah, I will.” John lied.
“You have family in London?” John pried, attempting to seem nonchalant.
And thus started the routine they used on the bad nights to lull the pair into sleep.
John gripped onto Sherlock’s shoulders and shook him a little, urging him to stay awake. He could hear someone on the phone to the emergency services so he knew all he needed was for Sherlock to hold on for a moment longer so he could get some proper help.
"Time to get up, sleepy head."
As the music increased in tempo, from each side of the stage the girls began dancing onto the floor in unison, standing on
“It’s not supposed to be funny, John!” Sherlock bemoaned, gesturing theatrically at John’s feet.
Sherlock:
“I could do with a cup of tea, to be honest.” John said, realising that making Sherlock wait would be a fun game to play, and he didn’t want to offend Mrs. Hudson, of course.
“Twenty-one quid, love,” she answered with a thin smile. “You want a programme for an extra fiver?”
it to happen. He was sure going upstairs meant he was bound to start something he wasn’t sure how to finish.
“You don’t have a partner then?” Sherlock suddenly wasn’t looking at John; he seemed to be focusing intensely on his drink, watching the bubbles rise slowly to the top.
Sherlock pulled off his coat, throwing it carelessly on the floor and crouched down in front of the fireplace, fumbling with wood and matches. John allowed him to struggle for a bit before kneeling down next to him, taking the box of matches and telling him to go make some tea while he lit the fire. By the time Sherlock returned with two steaming mugs, the fire was blazing warmly, John warming his hands in front of it.
He was holding back his desperation for the time being, not giving in to that ache in his chest that told him to go and wrap his arms around Sherlock. He wanted to take him in his arms and reverse time so he could change things, so he could go back to how it was last night when the worst thing they had to worry about was Sherlock’s sheet changing skills.
He thought, inwardly kicking himself. “Uh, yes-yes I’m hungry. Starving, in fact.”
“Oh my,
John’s heart seemed to swell as he watched this beautiful man profess his truth to him. Sherlock blinked up at John as he grasped onto Sherlock’s hand, which was sitting on the countertop, balled into a fist, betraying his nerves.
John would sometimes wake in the early hours of the morning, desperate, quiet sobs rattling through his chest. This was something that had been happening on and off for the past two weeks – John being overcome with sudden bouts of deep, intrinsic sadness that he couldn’t seem to shake. And sleep wouldn’t quell the loneliness in his chest; it only produced nightmares in which he was drowning, his breath being stolen from his lungs, being replaced with burning fire and gushing water.
, allowing himself to become softer in his motions, he was suddenly envisioning Sherlock underneath him, crying out John’s name, hands clawing down his chest. John kept his eyes closed, savouring the vision, his breath becoming heavier. The woman’s crooning continued and very quickly, John felt himself growing hard, his body moving slowly, breath escaping his lungs in deep bursts. And when he opened his eyes, Sherlock was still watching him intensely, his eyes dark, biting his lip.
Now please, sit back and enjoy the show!”
John knew what Sherlock was asking, but he was still taken aback. “Oh, I’m actually a vegetarian,” he said without thinking.
. He managed to form a sentence and felt his throat constricting with despair as he said it: “I can’t do this with you … not anymore. I’m getting married today.”
John smiled weakly, pulling a glass and a bottle of whiskey from their liquor cabinet and pouring himself a rather large glass. Taking three deep swigs, he topped it up before moving over to Mary to examine the contents of her bowl.
John followed awkwardly, not knowing where to place his jacket, so he just kept it on him, feeling slightly warm, but suffering through it.
Sherlock’s eyes moved up onto John’s and he saw Sherlock’s vulnerability laid bare for him. “How can I be sure you’re telling the truth?” he said in a small voice.
“Well there you go, then.”
Let me know what you think!

“Yes, dear?” she was bustling in the kitchen, laying out a tray with tea and shortbread.
“Wife to be. Engaged.” John struggled with the words, almost as though he were coming to terms with them all over again.
He had never been a liar, but now it seemed he couldn’t stop. He couldn’t remember the last day that went by without a lie slipping from his lips.
As he moved into the living room, the flat was deathly silent, all but for John’s quiet breathing and the faint sound of rain on the rooftop. The dim light straining through the windows made the room dusky and morose, which ironically fitted in with exactly how John was feeling. He spotted Sherlock’s ruined sheets sitting in a heap on the floor where he had left them last night and on the countertop in the kitchen lay their mess of empty food containers. The flat contained snippets of their love, the echo ricocheting onto any tangible surface and John allowed the memories to slip into his mind, storing them in a reservoir labelled ‘Sherlock Holmes’.
As John shut himself in the bathroom, allowing the water to heat up, he leaned on the sink, looking at himself in the mirror.
John watched in silence, not wanting to disturb the man in front of him straight away. He stood by the door and allowed himself to take in the music, although somehow feeling as though he were missing what the strange man across from him was experiencing.
“Just tell me one thing … was any of this the truth? Or was it all lies?” His voice whispered out across his lips, almost too quiet for John to hear over the din of the train station.
when you’re acting all coy.”
So ... the final chapter. Let me just tell you: this is the first full length story I've ever completed (usually I end up getting distracted by other things and never finishing them), so this is kind of a big deal for me.
John quickly found a link on their website labelled ‘OUR STAFF’ and he clicked it, feeling apprehensive at the thought of finding Sherlock’s name. He scrolled through the many names on the page before reaching the last name on the list, in bold blue writing: ‘Sherlock Holmes’. John reread the name multiple times, his heart suddenly beating a little faster, before moving onto the piece underneath:
“You can feel this, I know you can.” John’s voice wavered, threatening to give out on him. He used his thumb to wipe a tear from Sherlock’s cheek. “Please … don’t tell me to leave.”
“Yeah. And … the way you looked in the light when I told you I loved you. The way your eyes seemed to see into my heart and know I was telling the truth.” John didn’t know what he was saying. He was drunk with sleep.
“What? How bad is it?” Mary urged, feeling shaken.
John sniffed, looking up at his sister who was standing with her arms folded across her chest – she looked remarkably like their father with that harsh expression on her face, her light blue eyes scowling at him.
Once he was done, he beckoned Sherlock back inside and they both wriggled under the clean sheets, their skin soft against the luxurious cotton. John held his arm out for Sherlock to snuggle into his chest and soon enough, Sherlock had entangled himself into John’s body, his legs twisting into John’s and his arms wrapped around his waist. He buried his face in John’s neck and pressed soft kisses into the delicate skin.
John stopped in his tracks, his back to Harriet, contemplating turning around to continue his argument with her. He wanted to scream at her that he wasn’t a fucking coward. That loving Sherlock was the only brave thing he had ever done in his life. Instead he steeled himself and marched on around the corner to the elevator door, punching his fist into the button. The alcohol had made him livid, but not with Harriet.
“John,” her voice was soft. “Are you okay?”
“Yeah,” John sighed, thankful to have Sherlock in his arms. “I think what I’ll remember the most is … the feeling of … coming home.”
“John,” his voice was sharp, hiding something.
“John,” her voice was quiet and her face grave. “You need to go home.”
my home.”
, he thought,
“Yes! In this case, it is! Mary isn’t some doll that you can just manipulate for your own agenda! She is a human being with feelings and emotions and she deserves to know that you’ve done this to her! This isn’t some fib you’re telling a child! This is your future
“Come on,” Sherlock stood and held his hand out for John, his face serious. “We’re going to start again.”
Sherlock smiled, an astonishingly pure and free expression, before standing up and moving into the chair next to John, leaning in close. John kept his gaze trained on Sherlock, wanting to relish this moment, and as Sherlock pressed his soft lips smoothly into his, he felt like he were suddenly lighter. John kissed back, allowing his hands to move into Sherlock’s curls, feeling the smile under Sherlock’s lips expand. John was smiling too, allowing himself to truly be in the moment, forgetting his worries about people scrutinising the pair.
“Not at all,” Sherlock answered.
“You’re going to come?” John asked, watching Sherlock closely. The veins in his neck were standing out and John could see the throb of his heartbeat coursing through his body.
“I’m going to shower,” John answered, turning the faucet on in the shower.
Jesus, what was Sherlock trying to do to him?
John latched onto that, already making his way to the door to show Sherlock out. “Uh, yeah, thanks for the strawberries, Sherlock.”
,” she sighed, closing her eyes. “I guess I’ll just have to suffer, then.”
John said his goodbyes and hung up the phone, feeling elated. He was excited to go on a trip with Sherlock, even if it did mean the possibility of him moving. It was only when he turned to go back inside, putting his phone in his pocket, that he realised the reality of the situation.
As John sat across from Sherlock, Angelo came back to their table with two menus, repeating what he had stated earlier – “Anything you’re after, Sherlock, on the house; for you and your date.” He gestured to John.
the sheets like some commoner – what was John thinking? They were
“Yeah,” John dropped his hand and his tired eyes met hers. “I’ll go. Tell him … I’m sorry.”
that he couldn’t help but falling for him at the sight.
“Oh for goodness sake,” Mary sighed, rolling her eyes. “You do realise it’s only 4pm, yeah? You’re wasted, John.”
“Yes, well, I can already see that – look at your
The stage was emptied of people and suddenly the lights on the Christmas tree went out, cloaking the stage in darkness. John strained his eyes, desperately inching forward in his seat to look for any sign of movement, his heart leaping into his throat. Over the speakers a single piano chord rang out through the auditorium, followed by more harmonies of chords, repeating themselves for a few moments.
“No … please …” John didn’t know what to do. He could only watch in horror as Sherlock’s eyes began to close. “Sherlock …”
“Hmmm,” John hummed low in his throat, allowing his lips to trace butterfly soft movement across his skin. “I’m sure –“ John placed a deliberate, tantalisingly slow kiss on his throat … “you –“ … moving down to his collarbone, teeth grazing skin ... “can wait.”
“Truthfully? No.” Sherlock lowered his eyes and cleared his throat. “But I will be. I got the Sussex job - I’m moving there next week.”
!” he snapped.
“Oh no, love, no …” John used his free hand to cup Sherlock’s cheek, brushing away the tears that were sitting on his skin. “I don’t want you to cry. Please don’t be sad.”
John spent the next forty minutes tirelessly going through the motions of the first half of their dance, feeling slightly frustrated at his inability to coordinate his feet with his hands. Sherlock would regularly come up rather close to John, using his hands to move certain body parts in the correct way to show John how it was meant to be done, all the while telling John how wonderfully he was doing. At one point, Sherlock boldly moved in so close to John their noses were almost touching, using his bare foot to push his legs open a bit more, Sherlock maintaining delicious eye contact as he did so, one eyebrow quirked almost as if to say “I dare you to make the next move”. John stumbled slightly so he had to grab onto the front of Sherlock’s shirt, pulling him in so their bodies were touching.
Sherlock sighed, his fingers finding the bridge of his nose in his typical expression of frustration that John was becoming all too familiar with.
Sherlock merely smiled kindly, allowing him to bustle them over to a prime table situated at the front window, overlooking Northumberland Street which was active with life.
"Nervous?" Charlotte asked, standing back to look at John.
John felt his body shaking with the cold and his nose was feeling numb. He stared into Mrs. Hudson’s face for a moment and she stared straight back, unyielding, and then John felt himself sagging underneath her touch, all energy leaving him.
truth, Sherlock.”
John ran his hands raggedly through his hair, trying to find some way at least to make Sherlock stay and listen, but Sherlock turned away and made his way to the train. John could see a slight shake in his squared shoulders and he knew he was finally allowing himself to cry. John watched him leave, helpless, feeling as though Sherlock had taken a part of him with him onto the train. He felt raw because of it. He was suddenly empty.
“Oh – oh my!” A woman’s voice broke through the pair’s lustful reverie.
“Sorry?” John’s heart dropped into his stomach, suddenly thinking he was referencing John’s text to his fiancée.
“Cab’s here, John. Let’s go!”
“Well, I guess now is a better time than ever,” Sherlock’s hand delved into his coat pocket. “I have something of yours you might need returned …”
. When I have you, I want all of you, not some desperate fuck in your dance hall. I can’t do this.”
He followed her through past the stairs that led up to Sherlock’s flat, into her small kitchen, where she pulled off her raincoat and hung it, dripping, on the hook on the back door. John perched himself on the edge of the seat by her dining table, pulling off his coat which was dripping water all over the floor.
“I have to go,” he whispered, his hand dropping from Sherlock’s face. “I … I have to go.”
John thought back to Sherlock’s breathy moans as they kissed. His pert ass as he leaned over the piano; John had wanted to rip off his pants and bury himself deep inside of him then and there. He thought about Sherlock’s needy begging as John had his hands down his pants, the feeling of Sherlock’s length in his hand. And suddenly John realised he was growing hard thinking about him.
“No,” John answered immediately. “I haven’t seen her in a long while. It’s well and truly over between us.”
John sucked in a quiet breath and withdrew his hand from Sherlock’s face. He couldn’t be hearing this from him, not now. He had been so sure of himself yesterday, almost excited at the fact he was getting married, and yet now …
“I don’t know what you’re smiling about. You’re the one who’s going to have to pick up the pieces if you want to fix this!”
He was determined not to give in and touch himself, even though he was aching to, but that still didn’t stop his thoughts from roaming to Sherlock again and pretty soon, he was leaning with his hands against the wall, the water cascading down his back, eyes screwed shut as his cock throbbed desperately.
John rolled his eyes at his sister and drank the rest of his tea in silence. He was feeling more relaxed after talking to Harriet and felt ready to start preparing himself to go to the chapel.
John ran his hands over his face and let out a hollow chuckle, rubbing his fingers over his eyes, which felt strained from crying.
So ... smut ... Please note: I rarely* write smut, so my apologies if it's terrible.
John’s hands found Sherlock’s belt buckle, shaking slightly as he quickly unfastened his pants. At this stage Sherlock and John were breathing heavily into each other’s mouths and when John reached inside of Sherlock’s trousers and his hand found his already rock hard member that was leaking with pre-come, Sherlock gasped into John’s mouth. The noise he made was almost enough to make John climax then and there.
“I told you I was applying for a job there.” Sherlock’s reply was blunt.
. He felt as if he were being melded into one with him, his consciousness being pulled from him so he could only exist in a world where he was with Sherlock and Sherlock only.
, did I do something wrong?”
“I …” John reached out and squeezed Mary’s hand reassuringly. “I promise I won’t do that to you.”
“What do you
,” Sherlock said, outraged.
Glancing quickly at Sherlock, whose inscrutable gaze was still on his face, John closed his eyes and began to sway from side to side, allowing himself to find the beat in the music, letting the woman’s soft tones guide him. Yet when he really started to
“Good morning,” John said quietly.
John pulled out his phone and without thinking, dialled the first number that came into his brain.
Sherlock moved in closer to John’s space so their breaths were mingling together. “Will you hold my hand while I’m falling asleep?”
? As the song ended, John quickly dropped Sherlock’s hand and took a step back, clearing his throat, arms swinging.
It wasn’t work that John was worried about – he was more worried about what he would tell Mary. Already his mind was running through a million different lies in his head.
“Oh no, I was just getting around to beating you black and blue for that one. What the hell were you thinking, John?!” Harry leaned over the counter and swatted at John’s head lightly. “I thought you loved Mary!”
“You still haven’t shown me your dance skills,” she stated happily, a slight slur in her voice. “You’ve been having your lessons for a few weeks. I think it’s time for you to show me what you’ve got, John.”
“Oh how lovely,” she said, clasping her hands together, her red lips pulled into a grin. “Who is it?”
“What? Tell me!” John was quite worried now, watching Sherlock become more frazzled as the seconds wore on.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m fine, John. It’s okay. I just had a nightmare, is all.” Sherlock moved over to John with his water and pulled him into his chest with one arm, placing a soft kiss on his head. “You go back to bed – I’ll be there in a moment.”
It only took one solid strokes before John was coming undone in the shower, seed spilling from him, only to disappear down the drain. John bit down on one hand to stop himself from crying out, feeling like he was going to cry out Sherlock’s name. Instead a muffled groan escaped his throat as his orgasm rattled through his body. In that moment all he could think about was Sherlock.
Sherlock paused, his fork halfway to his mouth, and returned it to his plate, contemplating.
“John, nothing’s set in stone just yet. It’s just an interview. Did you not hear me when I asked you to come? I … I want you to … I want you to come with me.” Sherlock suddenly sounded very small. “Please.”
Sherlock didn’t notice that John’s eyes had opened and he didn’t notice him watching Sherlock caress his hand with intense concentration. Sherlock did notice, however, when John held onto Sherlock’s hand and silently moved it up to his lips and began placing soft kisses all over his hand, focusing on his palm and wrist and each individual finger as if he never wanted to let him go. Sherlock sucked in a breath, heart hammering, and closed his eyes, allowing himself to take in the sensation of John’s lips on his hand. He kept his eyes closed, afraid that if he opened them again, he would wake up and it would have been a dream.
“No luck?” he asked quietly.
“Why the phone call? Not that I’m complaining of course.” John was walking back and forth from his front gate to the front door, a small smile on his lips. Christ, he was acting like a bloody smitten school girl.
“John,” Sherlock moaned, his head falling forward as he used his hands for leverage to push himself back into John urgently. “John …
His relationship with Mary had always been strained: it had started with his parents not liking her at all. “She’s too promiscuous for you, John.” His father’s words echoed through his mind, remembering the countless fights he had with him when his dad brought up Mary in that way. And of course those fights had sowed the seed of discomfort between Mary and himself, so for the first 6 months of their relationship nearly every few days they were having yelling matches with each other. And Mary, as strong as she was, held her own, throwing back whatever John aimed at her with a passion John hadn’t witnessed before.
,” she said, pouring another for him. “Are you going to tell me what’s got you in this state or are you just going to continue drinking my liquor all morning?”
"What kind of sister would I be if I didn't make my brother a cup of tea on his wedding day?"
It was as though both the men had a million words they wanted to say, perched on the tip of their tongues, but they were unable to say them.
“Sherlock.” John admitted, all fight leaving him. It was all over.
“And …” John slipped another finger inside, slowly allowing Sherlock to become accustomed to the sensation, “this?”
John would wake each time, gasping for air, spluttering into his pillow. His chest would be heaving as he tasted the echo of salt on his tongue. This was the type of pain that was built to last, soaking into his skin and settling itself in his bones like a disease.
“I forgive you,” Sherlock said softly. “I understand why you’re doing this and I forgive you.”
It was only when the crowd quietened and John saw the stage being swept hurriedly to clear away the snowflakes that John knew Sherlock would be waiting in the wings to come on stage and dance.
John didn’t understand why the lie fell from his lips so easily: possibly it was the wine he had drank too fast on an empty stomach, or maybe it was the fact that he couldn’t stop looking at the way Sherlock would lick his lips every so often in between words. He didn’t understand the reason, but later down the track he knew it would come back to haunt him somehow. For now though, he allowed it to roll from his lungs like a snake and settle itself around his throat. He swallowed more wine.
John left in a daze, initially intending to go home, but instead heading in the direction of his local pub.
I'm uploading this chapter early due to me being too busy over the weekend to upload it. It's basically double the word count of the last chapter (is that normal to have chapters differing so greatly in size? I'm still learning, so I guess that's normal for me? Maybe I'll start a trend ...)
John swayed slightly, feeling lightheaded, and steadied himself by placing a hand on Sherlock’s dresser. He closed his eyes and allowed himself to choke out a quiet sob as Sherlock’s words repeated in his head.
“I know,” Sherlock voice was a whisper across his lips, all strength lost.
Heading downstairs, John felt his phone vibrating in his pocket. Pulling it out, he saw Mary’s name flashing up, notifying him of a text she had sent just seconds earlier. And suddenly …
“That’s our Intrepid Persuasion design,” Joanne answered with a sigh, eyeing John suspiciously. She turned to Mary. “Perhaps we should leave this decision to you, Mary.”
He fell forward onto Sherlock and pushed himself in deeper, both the men crying out. John buried his face into Sherlock’s chest both of them lying still for a moment, breath raggedly escaping them. Enveloped in each other’s wet heat, John felt Sherlock placing kisses along his shoulder, his legs wrapping completely around him so they were flush with each other.
John decided the next morning to walk to work instead of catching the bus, taking the time to clear through his thoughts. He was afraid of letting Sherlock go because he had invested so much of himself into him. Somehow, without Sherlock around, he was suddenly emptier and allowing himself to move on meant he would forever be missing that part of himself that Sherlock was holding onto.
you have to offer me, I want to be there in it with you. I want to feel every moment with you. I want to dance every dance with you. I would follow you …
John smiled, looking down at his brown leather loafers. “Hey, I actually like these shoes!” he protested jokingly. “What’s wrong with them?”
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson. Enough of you now,” he snapped petulantly, slamming the door in her face as soon as she was over the threshold.
and John accepted that, on Mary’s part, but he couldn’t help but not trust the git – something about his face just screamed
“You … you told me, remember?” Sherlock was becoming more uncomfortable as time went on, understanding now that him showing up unannounced was slightly presumptuous on his part. “But I have to, uh, meet a friend anyway, so I can’t stay.” He lied.
I really hope you guys enjoyed this one!
“Hey, uh, would it still be okay for me to borrow some clothes today? We just won’t have time to stop in at mine,” John asked as he was entering the bathroom to shower himself.
I'd like to give a huge thanks to my friend Ana aka WeepingKettle, who, since starting to read my fic, has become a really good friend of mine. Her support throughout me writing this has helped me endlessly and I'm forever grateful for the help she constantly offers me. <3
and run away with Sherlock, leaving behind Mary and this wedding and his past. But then he also remembered the promise he made to Mary and he knew he had to keep it.
kind of heartbreak I’ve experienced when you weren’t even there to help me through it?!”
. The way Sherlock was begging John was too much: his voice needy and small, mingling with slight gasps. John had never experienced something so sexual in his life and they weren’t even undressed yet. The music had finished, leaving their heavy breathing the only melody to be heard.
touch me,” Sherlock warned. The quiver in his voice made John’s chest ache. “Well? Was anything true?”
“Sher … you can’t … you can’t just ignore me forever!” he cried, tears blurring his vision.
have second thoughts,” she said, repeating his words. “Well, here’s what I need from you: if you truthfully do still want to be with me, you need to be 100% in this, John. None of this second thoughts business - you’re either in this or you’re not. You need to be sure this is what you want. Before the wedding.”
“M’not coy-“ Sherlock started to protest, but John used his finger to shush him.
“Oh my god,” he groaned. “That is –
was gone? How were you to know
… no-no-no, they’ll have to go.”
John was, at the time, taking a sip of water that was on the table for them. He spluttered into it slightly before putting his glass down and choking out “M’not his date.”
Sherlock’s reply lit up his phone:
His house was dark when he got inside but as he moved upstairs, he could see a slit of light from underneath his bedroom door, indicating Mary was most likely still up reading. John went into the bathroom and relieved himself, before washing his face and examining his reflection.
John hesitated, before clicking reply and contemplating what he was supposed to tell her: “it’s going well, I’m extremely attracted and intrigued by him, and he’s taking me out to dinner”?
He pictured himself, years from now, with Mary by his side, a wedding band on his middle finger, possibly a child underfoot, and his stomach tightened even more. But he had promised to her that he wouldn't walk out. She had told him to be sure and now was the time he needed to keep that promise.
John and Mary left the store with a bag full of blank invitations, Mary’s face made of stone as she marched ahead towards their car. John rushed to keep up, knowing she was very obviously angry at him and feeling slightly guilty.
I fix this?” John said.
John took in a breath at the sight, drinking in Sherlock’s sculpted chest. He was, for lack of a better word, flawless. Dancing had proved to be a wonderful direction, creating a toned physique that made John
“You don’t want to listen because you know it’s the truth!” Harriet yelled after him as he marched down the hall in the direction of the elevator. “You’re a bloody coward, John!”
“Will you be able to organise work off for it?” Sherlock spoke eagerly.
John watched them pull out into the road and for a moment, he was thankful they were leaving, until he spotted his cab waiting for him and on a whim he dashed into the cab and demanded the driver follow their car.
“I thought you’d be more pissed off with me cheating on Mary, but instead you’re going on about the fact that our dad will be disappointed that he has two gay kids?” John and Harriet’s banter was always easy and it helped soothe John’s anxiety, allowing him to focus on something else.
“Tomorrow,” John answered, still feeling slightly embarrassed – he found himself staring into his cup of tea with much intensity to avoid looking at his fiancé. “I found someone online who seems a bit okay – he’s got plenty of positive reviews and quite reasonably priced.”
Harriet followed him to the door, holding it open for him. Her face was contorted into incredulous bitterness, watching him angrily shove on his jacket.
Minutes later, Angelo had returned with a large glass of red and a sparkling water. He placed them on the table and then gleefully pulled a candle from his pocket and placed it in the middle of the table.
John heard Sherlock’s footsteps across the wooden floor and there was a small
Sherlock’s eyes were on John, watching his face as he took in Sherlock’s clothed form, his tongue moving out to wet his lips. Understanding the trepidation in his eyes, Sherlock moved his hands up to his own shirt and began undoing the buttons, slowly peeling it off so he was bare chested in front of John for the first time.
processed within the day, sir.”
John nodded his assent.
John snatched the paper from her, forever marvelling at her ability to not only be incredibly perceptive, but also incredibly vulgar all at once.
He was already in the cab when John reached it and when he ducked his head and stepped inside, Sherlock continued staring out the window, his shoulders squared. The car lurched into traffic and John placed his hand over Sherlock’s, squeezing it.
Sherlock was rifling through his bag which was on the floor, pulling out scrunched up paper, some of which had scrawled writing and diagrams of certain dance moves across them, obviously penned from Sherlock’s hand. He then pulled out a flier and handed it to John.
John sent back a text saying goodnight and turned his phone off, setting it on to charge. His mind was reeling and he expected to not get much sleep that night. Instead, the most likely thing to happen would be thoughts of Sherlock and his scent and the feeling of his waist under his hands as they danced together.
Mary sat opposite, watching with annoyance at how childish he was being. Was he really still upset over their tiff yesterday? He had no right to be upset considering
John began to form a reply.
There was a smattering of applause as the curtain on the stage began to slowly rise, revealing a large stage, empty expect for a tall Christmas tree positioned in the back left corner, twinkling softly with white Christmas lights.
Sherlock allowed silence to stretch out between the pair as he mulled over the question. “Mostly,” he answered as he pulled his coat around him tighter to protect himself from the cold.
Sherlock was in front of John and he gently took John’s right hand, placing it on Sherlock’s small waist which felt surprisingly muscular underneath his clothes (
“Well …” John hesitated for a beat –
A short chapter today (honestly, this one was a struggle for me because I've been so busy with work) so please remember to let me know if you enjoyed it or if you think I could improve in anyway because a lot of this was written while I was severely sleep deprived. XD
Sherlock took John by the hand, leading to the front door and as soon as it was opened, John pushed Sherlock inside, sending him back into the wall beside the door. John’s hands were on Sherlock immediately, pushing him against the wall with a loud thud, knocking Sherlock’s head against it. The wood smacked hard against his head, but Sherlock couldn’t concentrate, nor did he care, because the feeling of John’s lips on his jaw as his hands roamed freely was insanely distracting and the best painkiller he could ask for. Sherlock was quivering at the feeling of him suckling at the pale skin on his neck, drawing a faint pink bruise; this was everything he had been dreaming about during the restless nights he had spent at home alone. John was hungry for him, he couldn’t get enough, his hands couldn’t grasp enough flesh and –
“She’s right, you know,” John said, standing.
“Because I …” John felt his eyes welling with tears as he attempted to form a reason, yet he couldn’t manage any. Deep down, he was elated that Sherlock was here and he was even more elated at the fact that he
