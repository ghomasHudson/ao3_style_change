Grabbing hold of the lamp at the far side of the room, Sherlock hurled it at the alpha and scarcely missed him.
“John!” Harry worriedly spoke, arms holding onto John tight as the omega’s knees gave way to such damning thoughts.
"Don't. I won't forgive this. You wanted me? You wanted me, but waited, married another, than
As Mycroft exited the hospital and made his way to his waiting vehicle, an agent opening the door for him, he heard Gregory call for him to stop as he rushed the remaining distance.
“Why? John, through talking you’ll be able to understand Sherlock’s intentions.”
“I don’t follow.” John tried to understand Sherlock’s words, but was truly at a loss.
“No.” John cut Sherlock’s words off before he could say them. He’d let Sherlock give so much in this aspect as well as many other parts of their relationship. John wanted to give back to Sherlock now.
All Sherlock wanted was sexy time with John. Was that too much to ask for? Apparently it was, since Sherlock couldn't even bake a bloody casserole without starting a fire. Blinking harshly, Sherlock focused on calming his breathing. He wasn't crying. It was the smoke that made his eyes water. And he certainly wasn't sulking, because he wasn't a sulker!
"What are you doing?"
"More." Sherlock husked, and without thought shoved the alpha onto his back and quickly moved to straddle those thick muscular thighs.
"I haven't... touched myself in the last week, been reading and preparing for tonight. I wanted to wait for you."
Sherlock moaned painfully, half hurt, half bliss, it felt like too much pleasure, and sometimes an overwhelming amount of pleasure could equally be painful, because things weren’t supposed to feel this good. John understood. It was how John felt every time Sherlock touched him. John’s nerves vanished the more needing and pleading Sherlock became. John sloppily sucked in more of Sherlock; unwinding one arm from Sherlock’s leg to stroke three quarters of Sherlock’s cock, John could not take in his mouth.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
"You know I'm an omega. I could have died!"
“Here, love. Put this wet towel on your forehead. I turned the air conditioner on so you’ll feel loads better.” Mrs. Hudson explained.
The omega’s trembling hands moved blindly behind him, one clenching to the left globe of the alpha’s ass, his other running through the alpha’s dark brunette hair, fisting a hold and whined for more. The bed shook with the alpha’s powerful thrusts and John’s breathing elevated. The alpha crowded over the omega, shoving him deep into the mattress, pressing his whole body weight against him and plowed through him.
Raising a dark brow in question, Sherlock analyzed the hesitation that flashed in John’s deep blue. One part was worry for Sherlock, but there was something else too, something that made John shift awkwardly where he sat near him, something that made Sherlock realize John had something important to say.
Wrapping his arms around John's shoulders and throwing a leg over a hip, Sherlock unashamedly humped John's hip with his small cock and dampened his thigh with his wet omega hole.
John tried to follow it all. Tried to listen to Sherlock and Mycroft as they explained Mary's involvement, but only half of it stuck. Mary had shot Sherlock to keep the secret. Sherlock believed Mary's feelings for John were sincere, but she'd been backed into a corner by Moriarty, then Magnussen. All that was almost too much to absorb, but there was more.
John flushed with the bluntness of Sherlock’s words. Carding fingers through dark tresses, John bit his bottom lip and nervously nodded in acceptance. God, John was acting like it was their first time, and in a way it was. Their first time in the way that heat and rut weren’t controlling their actions. This was voluntary, no raging hormones, no crazy need to fuck like rabbits—Just an alpha and omega, married, and strongly in-like.
"What would you have me tell John?" Mycroft knew that Sherlock would be unable to say his goodbye this time.
, you know better than that. If you kill me, you both die. If you let me go, I’ll let you live and you might still have the chance to save your pet.”
“And don’t be upset if I snap more often than not. I won’t mean any of it. It will just be the hormones talking.”
"And I you." Sherlock smiled broadly.
Victor... Yes, John was lying by omission, not divulging that he and Sherlock were married, but that was a lie that would soon be remedied when they married before Harry and went public. Still, Victor wanted to be friends and John didn't feel an overwhelming amount of guilt for keeping this one thing from the omega, because he held no sense of duty or obligation. Not like with Harry and Sherlock.
"Please." Sherlock vocalized what John could clearly see. "Please, John. I... Please?"
Sherlock was a man of science. He’d read countless books on human anatomy. He’d performed hundreds of dissections on cadavers, but this… Staring at the perspiring, flushed skin of his husband, completely bare and open to his view, stirred something within. Sherlock felt shame and embarrassment, two emotions foreign to him. Raising a hand to palm one side of his face, Sherlock hated how hot his skin felt from the blush claiming him.
“Is something the matter?” Mycroft’s voice rang through the momentary silence that was due to Mrs. Holmes sipping her tea.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Yes?” John breathed a sigh of relief, encouraged.
"Oh?" John asked, pulling away enough so he could meet silver.
A sudden hot gush of slick burst from out of his ass and soaked his pants. Lowering a hand, he palmed his stiff cock and whimpered throatily. He needed. He needed so badly. He was locked away in his heat room alone, so alone and he needed to be needed. He needed an alpha.
“Stop teasing me.” John grumbled.
John’s mobile chimed then and he hastily released Sherlock’s hand to read the new text.
"I know. Sherlock told me."
“I don’t.”
“Oh enjoying the thrill of the chase is fine. Craving the distraction of the game, I sympathize entirely. But
“They were in the microwave!”
, Sherlock, we are not his victims.
"I'm a fool." John whined miserably, wiping at his damp eyes.
One of Sherlock’s hands moved to scrape through his blond hair before fisting a handful of locks to yank John’s head back enough so that he could shove his tongue deep into his mouth and explore his omega completely. John followed him back and lay on Sherlock all the care and enthusiasm that he felt. Sherlock hungrily lapped at the inner core of John’s mouth, tasting with insistence. The untamed beast of an alpha within broke free as Sherlock growled heavily into their kiss, sending a vibration to tickle their joined tongues battling for possession. The kiss hastily altered, growing fiercer, longer, and stronger. John sighed happily, losing himself into the teasing battle of tongues while Sherlock plowed through him. Sherlock’s need for mating was clearly evident, his alpha needed to knot and now. John would do anything to appease the alpha’s instinctual desire for it was his own.
“John.”
Lestrade's eyes softened with remorse.
Glaring at the man, Sherlock fought back a growl, and quickly but quietly left the room. Sherlock didn't care to take in his surrounding of a home that was to be partiality his. No. He'd only taken enough of his surroundings to realize he was upstairs and needed to go downstairs and find his way out. He'd stumbled in his escape. Finding himself in a kitchen, before turning and going in the opposite direction. Then he slipped past a dining room, living room, and found the foyer leading to the front door.
… was at the flat…
"Well, I've been neglected by my alpha." Sherlock answered gravely.
Sherlock belted a monstrous outcry of rage. Four agents pinned him to the furthest wall of Mycroft’s office, allowing their superior space to collect himself. Sherlock tasted the bitter metallic flavor of blood, Mycroft’s—with feral fascination. Two agents on the ground held their bleeding arms and stared up in terror at the rampant alpha. Mycroft wasn’t doing any better, leaning back into his desk, winded, and hanging on to his bleeding shoulder; the gray of his suit turning dark with blood.
John's mind felt clouded, his heart full, and though he felt Sherlock go rigid against him, his alpha merely breathed out a contented rumble.
“Yes, sir.”
"Shhh." Sherlock hushed the alpha. He slipped his other hand up and touched John's free cheek and began stroking the skin there too with his other thumb.
“Were you…?” Sherlock tilted his head to the side and narrowed his eyes suspiciously.
“Well, what do you call this then?”
Sherlock knew it. This one was dangerous. A physically violent alpha that he should refrain from angering further, but Sherlock didn't heed the warnings of his omega. To hell with his omega. The omega he'd attempted to appease - his omega needed John, begged for the alpha's affections, and he'd nearly given to his instincts. He'd nearly allowed himself to foolishly give way to trust. He'd been so close to letting go of the past and trying to start a new life together.
John and Sherlock remained voiceless for several long moments. The gravity of what had happened and what was going to happen played in their minds, but both were unable to do anything to stop nature.
Sherlock didn’t move, didn’t speak, he just stared. The fierceness of his eyes doused out and was replaced by utter disbelief and…pain?
Sherlock remained silent, gazing deeply into John’s pleading eyes and rasped, “Mm, they care for each other.”
“John, you were so good. You did so well.”
"Please, John." Sherlock's voice was thin, weary, and John realized Sherlock had already made his decision.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sherlock paused, maybe he should have come right out and said it. Of course John would think it was about the pups and the omega quickly made to reassure his husband that their pups were safe.
The pale hand over his mouth, slid away and the alpha was suddenly fisting at his shirt near his chest, his breathing was erratic.
“Just accept that I can.” Sherlock breathed at John’s temple before placing a chaste kiss there.
John reminded himself sadly.
“Hello? Yes of course it is. What do you want?” Moriarty paused briefly to mouth an ‘I’m sorry’, before shouting enraged, “Say that again! Say that again and know that if you're lying to me, I will find you and I will skin you.”
” John was more than stunned.
“Is…” John spluttered, and just as he collected his thoughts into words Sherlock moved to stand beside him and he was forced to bury his questions.
It was a terrible insult to his status and rank. He was this alpha's true mate! True mates were monogamous, yet not in Sherlock's case. Because of his alpha's selfish choice, he'd become the second in a relationship that should never be this way. This other beta had stolen his place and now Sherlock lost all his rights. There shouldn't have been a first or second mate for them. It should have just been them, but no. This alpha had betrayed him.
John turned away, grabbed his discarded clothes from the ground and voicelessly exited the room, shutting the alpha’s door with a soft click and headed for his own room. The moment he shut the door of his room, John leaned heavily against it and exhaled a stuttering breath, blinking his eyes hurriedly, attempting to hold within all the pain tormenting his heart.
"You're terrible."
“Hmm?” Sherlock smiled amusedly, focusing the knob of his microscope while still trying to lean into John’s embrace.
"What are you--" Sherlock was cut off by Victor laughing harder, though the pain in his eyes could not be hidden.
Sherlock’s features softened, a fond, loving smile gracing his lips, that same sweet smile that John saw when the alpha stroked at the towel he’d thought he’d lost forever. John knew he was thinking about that beta now and John’s heart shriveled up to nothingness.
The alpha shifted behind him, moving closer to the middle of the bed and John tensed. His omega willing him to scoot closer, to allow his alpha to scent him as was usually done once an omega was bitten. He should be inviting his alpha to comfort his fears, to let their scents mingle with one another, to make this bed, this room…their own. John denied his omega’s requests. He rejected this alpha. This alpha wasn’t his mate — not by choice.
The man laughed jovially and stuck out his hand for Sherlock to take in welcome. Sherlock eyed the omega’s hand suspiciously, as if it were an offensive snake ready to strike. Raising his nose up with the arrogance only high-class men such as Sherlock could pull off, he refused the offered hand, a clear sign he wouldn’t be civil with this omega.
John tried to focus his sights on Sherlock, but barely managed to make out his blurred features. A cool hand took hold of his, so familiar, so comforting and John held onto it tightly when the EMT put an oxygen mask on him.
“Yes you did.”
“It’s fine mother. Let Sherlock go home and brood. Sherlock, there is a car waiting to take you back to the city.”
"Good shot." Sherlock stood before the alpha, surrounded by the hysteria of a crime scene, a crowd of police, curious civilians, and reporters.
Sherlock raised out a hand and gripped tightly to John's arm and inhaled a deep breath before pushing, crying out mid-push as he felt his omega hole stretch tightly.
John sobbed harder, took two steps inside the foyer before wrapping his arms around his sister and sobbing into her shoulder.
Mycroft had never applied for a replacement omega, because he hadn't been ready to, and he simply didn't want to. Not after Gigi. Gregory didn't know that, and that was the point.
"I... might not be a wonderful mother, but you,
“Oh, that’s good, then.” Mrs. Holmes chuckled and kindly wrapped John in her arms and held him gently, petting his hair much like a mother would when soothing their child. The tears that pelted Mrs. Holmeses shawl was brought on by the nurturing embrace that mothers were strangely versed in. It was a great comfort to John as he held her close and inhaled the scent of his alpha’s mother with fondness.
“Sherlock!” Mrs. Hudson admonished, but Sherlock wasn’t listening.
"I'll fuck you into submission if you don't stop with the damn dirty talking!" John snarled harshly against his cheek and thrust a bit more than the tip inside, before Sherlock even realized he'd said all of that aloud.
Sherlock said nothing, looking panicked and John suspected he knew the reason why, but it did nothing to soothe the pang in his chest.
John sat heavily in his chair, allowing the next few minutes to pass in heavy silence.
“Seven pups.” John laughed heartily.
“I… He… I want to tell him how I feel.” John admitted timidly.
“Not until you’ve agreed to take him as you’re bond mate.”
Releasing Sherlock of his hold John moved away and towards the doorway.
“Mm.” John nuzzled Sherlock with keenness, losing himself to the scent of his alpha.
In every way, John Watson had ruined him.
John felt heat rise to his face and Mycroft stifling back his snickers didn’t help the situation.
"Really? You really were trying to woo me?" John voice was full of disbelief and joy.
“When we first met you told me that disguise is always a self portrait—how true of you. The combination to your safe—your measurements. But this, this is far more intimate. This is your heart. And you should never let it rule your head. You could have chosen any random number and walked out of here today with everything you worked for. But you just couldn't resist it, could you? I've always assumed that love is a dangerous disadvantage. Thank you for the final proof.”
Maybe time would heal these wounds he'd created. Maybe it wouldn't. John didn't know. What he did know was that he was regretful and he wished he could do something to right all the wrongs he'd committed.
John sighed heavily and glanced over to Sherlock once more. Sherlock was glowering at the priest, seeming to want to throttle the man, wanting to ruin this wedding, drive John away in one final, desperate attempt to have John call off the wedding. John would not give. He would not call off the wedding, even if Sherlock continued to interrupt the priest. He had his own reasons why he needed this marriage to go off without a hitch.
"Stop!" Sherlock called out to the cab driver and the car immediately came to a halt.
"I want this." Sherlock needed to say it. He needed to reassure the alpha that he wasn't forcing himself on the omega. "I didn't want my heat, but...
“Probably my answer has crossed yours.” Sherlock replied plainly, aiming the gun at Moriarty before dragging his aim lower and down to the bomb-loaded jacket.
Sherlock made the only conceivable choice. John knew this now. Accepting it was something completely different. John didn’t think he could ever accept this. He was angry with fait, for being chosen for Sherlock, for loving Sherlock, for being the victim of a mad man’s vengeance. It was because he meant so much to Sherlock that Moriarty had attacked him. He destroyed both Sherlock’s and John’s heart by murdering their unborn children.
“You all right?” Sherlock anxiously asked of John, worry clearly written in his eyes.
John ducked his head in submission and said nothing more, only followed after Sherlock as Mindy led them further into the store and stopped by several baby bathtubs on a display shelf.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
“They won’t.”
“Don't be alarmed. It has to do with sex.” Mycroft teased.
"Come in!"
Sherlock frowned and looked away, staring at the wall. Obviously not appreciating John's reaction. He'd thought he'd be more--
The one open conversation they had at Angelo’s, where they’d stopped holding back and confessed what they’d felt changed something between Sherlock and John—A hesitation on Sherlock’s part and distrust on John’s. After that, everything seemed to fall into place and the tension between them faded.
"Wait here." Sherlock asked and stepped back further.
Sherlock huffed angrily as his answer.
" Sherlock whined. He didn't want to wait.
“Your pups.” John echoed warmly.
“Oh, don’t do that.” Lestrade admonished, sensing the man retreating from the very notion.
The two glared at one another.
" John hurriedly shoved two fingers inside the heat of Sherlock's omega hole and fucked him with hard, jerking thrusts.
“John.” Sherlock began and John fastened the lean man’s waist securely in his arms, painfully so. He could hear the sharp inhale of breath the alpha made, but didn’t lighten his punishing hold.
birthday wish.” Mycroft pinched, eyes narrowing.
John was hurting. Sherlock knew this. He hurt his husband in the pursuit of a case and he couldn’t understand the constant painful throbbing of his heart every time John looked at him in that way. In the way that seemed to plead with him to pull away from The Woman.
John wanted to carry Sherlock’s pups.
“Don’t ever leave me again.” John exhaled a shaky breath, staring down into the vulnerable eyes of his alpha, and hurriedly bent down to kiss Sherlock’s trembling bottom lip.
Clare took hold of Harry's hand and squeezed.
“John.” Sherlock greeted breathlessly, a timid smile tugged at the ends of his lips.
“You signed?”
"Sherlock." John spoke softly, one hand moving to palm his face and making the omega look at him again. "I'm here. Talk to me. Only me."
“I’m nothing to him. I’m his duty, an obligation forced onto him. I might as well have never been born.”
"Oh..." John whispered softly, bowing his head and looking at his shoes. The subconscious submissive gesture going unnoticed by the alpha, but not the always observant omega.
"I believe John will agree. He's rather adamant about making you happy. I do believe he experienced the true mate connection at first sight."
“I have a case.” Sherlock explained and John nodded his head with understanding.
Sherlock frowned.
Lestrade said nothing. Nodded his head slowly, accepting John’s beliefs, though a part of him wanted to deny such a thought. Lestrade saw the way Sherlock acted around John, it was so very clear he was in love, but now… Now, with the way Sherlock had been behaving as of late, Lestrade began to wonder if he was wrong.
John attempted a straight face, much like the ones Sherlock would pull from time to time.
what you want from me at anytime and I must endure it.”
Mycroft hated how his mind wandered to that of Gregory Lestrade when he contemplated the similarities to his brother's situation. Much like John, Mycroft was allowing his anger to dominate his feelings for Gregory. Mycroft couldn't overlook the heartache he'd received at the sight of Gregory and that woman. If Mycroft was being truly honest with himself he'd acknowledge that what really hurt him was that Gregory could so easily give to pleasures of the flesh.
John moved closer, until every part of him was hard-pressed against Sherlock's larger frame. Leaning on a bent elbow near Sherlock's back, so he was leaning upright, high enough to meet Sherlock's gaze without having his mate crane his neck too much to still see him.
Sherlock watched as the alpha's face contorted to one of grief and, feeling his face heat, shamed by the show of emotions he was letting out, he spun on his heel and rushed for the door, ignoring John's call.
Sherlock's thoughts were broken at the sight of John's return. Relief filled Sherlock because he knew John would always protect him from his overbearing mother.
Sherlock swallowed dryly. Biting his tongue, he was unable to move, unable to follow his alpha instincts that urged him to climb on the bed and join his mate, to fill him, break John’s fever.
“What does Sherlock do?” John found himself asking the table of Homles’ several minutes later, his curiosity eating at him.
"Sherlock." John whined, overwhelmed.
"Oh dear, Sherlock. Are you alright?" Clare asked with care.
give Sherlock what he couldn’t, a family. John could offer the possibility of one child and that child wasn’t a certainty. Irene, however, could give Sherlock a large family, one of the most important things an alpha instinctually wished for.
The omega was pressed up against the lower cabinets of the kitchen, long legs splayed open, unwilling to close them and create a sweltering friction. Only, by doing so, it enhanced the scent of Sherlock's sex.
“Alright.” John stilled, Sherlock’s desperation hindering him in his movements.
tried to dominate him and demonstrate his power. He was rather domestic and it was an alarming thought for an alpha to be such.
“Shit.”
” It hurt just a little to know he was the cause of Sherlock’s turmoil.
“Come on then, do it!” Sherlock commanded.
“Hello freak.”
"Goodbye love."
“Leave.” John rasped, without bite, unable to summon up the necessary anger, he’d felt plenty of earlier.
“Me? What? Oh. Yeah. Fine. Gas leak. Apparently.” Sherlock summarily answered, focus back on Mycroft.
"I don't understand how it meant nothing. I was always taught to wait for you - the one I'm to be with. Love and sex are the same things and that I should only share my body with the one I would spend the rest of my life with."
The stranger lying on top of Gregory was young, beautiful, and enthused. Setting his glass on the desk with more force than necessary, the scotch sloshed and dampened his hand. Mycroft didn’t pay it notice; his focus was on the screen. There was no sound, but a picture spoke a thousand words, so a video was double proof, proof that he’d been wrong about Gregory. Mycroft grimaced as the woman’s hands stroked Gregory’s body and boldly worked their way under his shirt.
When John was half way through the folder, he raised his head up and stared back at Mycroft. John hadn’t yet met this Sherlock, but through reading his profile he knew there wouldn’t be a dull moment between them.
, but, I’m afraid that must now end.”
"Sherlock." John exhaled with feeling.
“I’m… pregnant.” John’s voice wavered as new tears fogged his vision
"We're going to the hospital."
“Mummy’s idea?”
“Loved.” Sherlock confirmed and John felt his heart shredded to bits.
“Are you complaining?” John grumbled unhappily, put off by the idea that he took more enjoyment at their closeness than Sherlock.
“Why would I do that? Then I’d miss the look on your face when you finally decide to raise your head.”
Sherlock paused, and watched as John hurriedly made his way to him. Grinning brightly, John threw caution to the wind, wrapped his arms around the alpha and planted a firm kiss to his lips.
Sherlock shut his eyes, inhaled John's intoxicating scent and hummed. Thanking whatever higher being had blessed him with John. He knew that their life together would only get better. This was only the beginning of the many joys that would follow.
John knew he should have. He was a disgrace. Mycroft could clearly see the love he had for Sherlock, yet his own mate thought him so flippant as to love another. Love blinded people. Sherlock's skills at deduction were lacking when it came to reading the one person he loved most in this world. Though, really this wasn't Sherlock's fault. John should have never lied. He should have accepted Sherlock's apology and taken him back, because Sherlock had only ever done what he thought best for them. If John hadn't let his anger get the best of him, maybe he could have stopped all of this.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
John almost wanted to laugh. Shouldn’t that be his husband’s job? Turning to stare at his alpha, he found the man staring off at the guests mingling with one another, a bored expression on his face. No. His husband didn’t seem like he would be providing comfort.
"I don't understand." Sherlock snapped bitterly. "I
.” John murmured sweetly, leaning in, lips so close to Sherlock’s, but again Sherlock shoved John away and crossed the room, giving them more space than John liked.
"Wouldn't you love to have my slick wet that cock of yours?"
The first kiss was followed by another and then another, and after, John lost count. Sherlock showered kisses on John, warm lips pressed against his hair, ear, neck, jaw, cheek, and then Sherlock was framing John’s face in his large palms and staring at him with such gentleness.
The young agent opened the door and in stepped Gregory Lestrade. Mycroft nodded for the agent to leave, and the young man shut the door behind him, leaving Mycroft alone with Gregory.
“It's not the end of the world, it's Mrs. Hudson.”
John held him close, so close Sherlock could hear the frantic pounding of his alpha's heart. It was both soothing and surprising.
Sherlock never pulled away from John’s touches, but he did tense when in public and appeared uneasy when officers around them took notice. John wished Sherlock wasn’t so reserved or cautious about his touches when in public, but Sherlock wasn’t exactly the same as he’d once been.
“Mycroft with nothing to say? Wow, this is a pleasant surprise.” Lestrade chuckled happily.
. I need.”
Sherlock… He remembered Sherlock’s smell, how intoxicating it was and how he’d knelt before him and then he’d… he’d… pounced and been… Sherlock… Sherlock to him…
Sherlock snorted, as if that mattered.
” Sherlock squawked and John’s head whipped in the direction of the door, brows raised and furrowed at the same time.
“I don’t know. I just… He’s loved me this whole time… For so bloody long and I just… I feel like saying it wouldn’t amount to much. I’ve been so cruel to him and I don’t deserve him.”
“Your brother can be a real tosser.” John thought aloud, smiling shyly, unsure how Sherlock would take his dislike of Mycroft.
clothes, John! I bought them one size bigger than I needed, and now the blasted things won't fit.
If he were to forgive Gregory. If he were to open his heart to him and be hurt... Mycroft shut his eyes, distantly hearing John's trembling breaths. Much like John, Mycroft would be destroyed.
The jet lurched and began gliding down the paved pathway, and the distant figure of Mycroft became smaller and smaller. John shut his eyes as the jet lifted off the ground and tears dampened his shut lids.
Lestrade raised a brow, but then a smug smile sprouted.
“He’ll come soon. He will. He has to.” John told himself, his voice raw and edgy as he glared at the clock.
.” Sherlock simmered, slipping on his way out of the fountain and John rose to his feet, taking several steps back, preparing himself for his punishment that was sure to come.
"No." John bit his bottom lip, hating to reject the plea. It pained him to refuse a request he so wished he could fulfill for himself as well as for Sherlock. "No. I can't."
.” John sighed pleasantly, his hands stroking over Sherlock’s back. The fabric of his shirt added another layer of a caress to his skin, and Sherlock was surprised to feel a pulsing in his lower region. His body responded so readily to John’s touch.
“Does it unsettle you?” John pressed his nose to the nape of Sherlock’s neck and inhaled his pleasing scent.
John didn't understand why he'd come here. Standing before the black door that read 221B, John felt a great many things. Much like he had when visiting Mrs. Hudson after so long. Only now it was worse because he knew his husband was alive and probably within that flat. He missed Sherlock's scent and he hated to admit such. The moment they'd met and John dived after the alpha, the scent of his husband accosted him and John's omega all but whined for want of it. But John would be damned if he leaned in to nuzzle his alpha’s scent gland and inhale his alpha pheromones. No, instead John had opted for strangulation.
"I'm hungry." The nausea had vanished the moment he'd scented the sweetness of his alpha and now all Sherlock could think about was food.
"Here?" John asked for certainty and tapped against the bump he felt.
"We would need Sherlock to transform into his wolf form so that I can tend to his omega and care for him."
Sherlock pressed his left hand against John’s and watched as John grip tightened and he pulled enough so that Sherlock’s arm straightened out and was open to his view.
John dressed in his finest. Dressing up and treating himself to a night out was better than wallowing in his sorrows. He’d done enough of that to last him years and Sherlock didn’t care about him. Sherlock didn’t love him. Sherlock didn’t need him. These were the things John needed to remind himself of daily. Sooner or later, this love would lessen and he could move on with his life. He had to believe that it would happen. If he couldn’t… John couldn’t think about what life would be like if he could never let go of this love.
"Sherlock." John whispered, attempting to draw the omega's sights from the wall and to him, when he finally stood bare, in his most primal of states.
Sherlock bulked against him, a pure animal-like cry dispelling from bit-bruised lips as Sherlock's mind began shutting off. Hallways darkened, lights blowing out, sending rooms to fall to the darkness, leaving little room to house all the thoughts building, attempting to understand this rise of feelings that were taking over him.
Pouring a glass of scotch, Mycroft walked over to his desk and took a seat. Exhaling a heavy sigh, he logged onto his computer and found the CCTV live footage of Gregory’s flat.
“Sss—such a cru—cruel husband.” John spat through a broken moan, tears smearing messily across his beet-red face when he buried it in the pillow, shoulders trembling, shaking with the voiceless hiccupping sobs.
“You told her I’ve presented?”
“Hurry.” Harry encouraged, not wanting to risk their luck and the two took the steps two at a time.
“Sherlock.” Mrs. Holmes hissed when still Sherlock refused to acknowledge John.
"It's not nothing." John growled as he followed after Sherlock, one hand rising to gently touch his bruising left jaw.
.” Sherlock spoke ambiguously, regretfully, warm smooth lips brushing against the back of his neck.
The alpha rumbled in approval and silently followed the omega’s actions, removing his clothing with less care than the omega had. Once the alpha was bare, John lowered his gaze to the alpha’s cock. Everyone knew an alpha’s cock was bigger than a beta’s and omega’s, but he never realized it would be
John’s eyes welled with hot tears and he shook his head denying the truth. Then he felt the warm arms of his father wrapping him up in a tight embrace.
Inhaling a trembling breath, Sherlock blinked back the remaining wetness, and turned his head to stare out at the railing of the terrace.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
“He needs surgery immediately, because of the heavy internal impact he’s bleeding extensively. In order to protect your husband, I need to terminate the pregnancy.”
John shut his eyes, bit the inside of his cheek, and clamped his hands into tight fists when Sherlock’s mobile, ‘
John inhaled a trembling breath and moved to seat himself beside her. Tuning slightly so they were facing each other, Mrs. Holmes laid a hand on his knee and spoke.
“Sherlock… I’ve never asked you, but…” John’s words faded away as he gazed into those hypnotic eyes.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The officers at NSY had mixed feelings. Everyone knew Sherlock was an omega, but none had realized he'd presented and that they were an item. A few had made comments about Sherlock being pregnant, mostly Anderson and Sally, but Lestrade quickly put a stop to their snarky remarks. Lestrade was a good man, who was their friend and kept the other officers working professionally with them, and John was thankful for that.
"Yes. For me, it is."
For one moment Sherlock was compliantly still, but in the next he went wild under John. Claws dug against John's forearms, shoving, pushing and struggling to get away, because he couldn't do this. Not when faced with
“Thank you, Dr. Levy.” John rasped as Sherlock’s free hand threaded through his hair and massaged his scalp tenderly.
John slowly, carefully, with great regret, slid his gaze from the priest and to the two figures standing side by side. Both were pale and tall men. Each dressed to the nines, though the one to the left wore an identical tuxedo that matched John’s own, and he instantly knew this was his intended. Since age six, he’d been promised to this man, almost married him at eighteen. The same man who encouraged him to follow his dreams in the army and gave him more time to prepare himself.
“You’re the love of my life, my true love. There has never been anybody else, just you John. Always you.”
“John, I’m begging you. I had no other choice.”
“I… don’t know if this is love, but…” John shook his head defiantly. No. He couldn’t do this. It would make everything hurt more, because Sherlock didn’t want him, not like Sherlock wanted that past lover.
Soon though, the high of sex would dwindle, as so too would Sherlock’s knot and John would remind himself that it wasn’t so. Sherlock was an alpha and no matter how many betas an alpha bedded, they’d always settle down with an omega, because that was the way of the world, that was biology, and it was instinct to mate an omega. Betas were just the mistresses and secret lovers of an alpha, and John wasn’t Sherlock’s lover. John was just a friend with benefits.
tell her."
John brows rose in surprise, stared back down at the flesh before him and lowered his hand. Replacing it with his nose, John dragged his nose up the slope of Sherlock’s neck and inhaled a long breath, seeking out his scent gland, where his scent was the strongest.
want you. I'm sorry. I'm so very sorry."
John smiled forlornly.
“No. We wait for his call. There’s a van outside that he’ll use to test your DNA, it shouldn’t be that long.”
“You think so?” Sherlock was deluding himself. Mycroft was willing to bet John would be more likely to murder Sherlock during his surprise resurrection from the dead.
"But I'm getting the help I need and I'm working through a lot of my past."
~~~~~~~~~~~~
His career... being a consulting detective, that was a hard one to bare loosing, but... if he deleted it all. Deleted not just John, but the last ten years of his life, maybe than he could find another way to be happy.
Sherlock stopped in his tracks and met Lestrade’s calculating gaze.
John couldn't say anything. His eyes filled with the tears he faught so hard to hold in, hating how Mary knew him better than he knew himself. Though he knew she was right.
look again.
"Have you? I didn't realize I was neglecting you." John smirked playfully, rolled onto his side and reached out to palm one of Sherlock's sex-flushed cheeks.
John stood awkwardly in the middle of Sherlock’s—now their room, and glanced over to the dressers of the room.
John’s ears felt hot as Sherlock’s bangs brushed against his forehead and the heat of Sherlock’s breath caress his sensitive lips. John’s lips parted wishing to kiss Sherlock, yet unsure if he would be welcomed to do so even when Sherlock’s eyes slowly closed.
“You’re skilled with words as you are with lies.” John wept.
“Please… Please save my babies. I don’t care what happens to me, I don’t, just, please, save my babies. They have to live, please, don’t take them away. Don’t take my babies.” John moaned in anguish and unexpectedly Sherlock was at his other side, a large hand palming his damp forehead and a smooth voice was whispering in his ear.
When his mobile buzzed with life, Sherlock ignored it as he’d been tailing what he believed to be his suspect. It buzzed several more times, but Sherlock was so distracted he’d barely registered its moderate humming.
Sherlock doesn’t know why, but the memories of John hotly whispering words of love reiterate themselves within his mind and his alpha whimpers in need. Sherlock wanted to just go to John now, lay passionate kisses and ravish him. No. He couldn’t do that. No. John didn’t want Sherlock like that, not now that his heat had broken.
John shifted back in his seat and stared down at his hands lying limply on his lap.
“I’m home. John, where are you?”
John’s eyes widened with disbelief.
John felt affronted.
. That had to mean something. Didn’t it?
“Oh, I volunteered.” Anderson answered eagerly.
Mrs. Holmes managed to calm herself enough to invite John over for dinner the following night and informed him Mycroft would be sending a car to pick him up and take him to her home. John had promised he’d be there before they’d ended their call.
“Oh.” Sherlock knew John had a point; the first copulation of a heat was always a bit foggy. After the first release, things always did become a bit clearer.
The the alpha, though he spouted words of love, this touch could only send his alpha within to feel a certain degree of apprehension. Wary of what his sick omega could possibly attempt in his altered state of mind. Another form of stress on the alpha. Sherlock wanted that. Loved the idea of stressing his alpha. He only hoped he could be there to watch as the alpha crumbled and broke.
, you misunderstand.” Sherlock’s voice was soft, fragile.
John was ready. He wasn’t ready for the chaos of being registered and being in the eye of the media, but he was certainly ready to find the perfect omega. John was ready to fall in love and start a family.
” John demanded, having to know what about himself had made Sherlock so amused.
John gave another hum, the vibrations sending an electrical current straight to his bollocks. The stirring of impending climax rising, building, setting his body into a tense knot of anticipation and want.
John’s lip twitched in a faint smile, Sherlock ever so cunning and amusing with his comebacks. At least that had remained the same.
“Okay. Give me a minute.” Sherlock sighed heavily. Usually a case like this would excite Sherlock, but he appeared less than thrilled. This pleased John as it affirmed Sherlock must have wanted to continue what they were doing.
"What do you want from me? Do you want my permission to see your
"So this surprise is a bad thing?" Sherlock determined worriedly. He really didn't want to take the pups back.
Mycroft wasn’t sure how to feel in regards to Gregory’s interest. He truly didn’t. Accepting that sentiment was a weakness was the best way Mycroft could cope with Gigi’s death and had helped him endure the many years without her.
“You’re mental. I’m just mad.”
Sherlock didn't respond to his brother's words and merely waited for him to leave before addressing the alpha.
"Horror! You won't say it back." John mocked hurt.
“The same as ever, although…” Lestrade hesitated, eyeing John uncertainly.
Wiping at his eyes once more, John rested his hand down on the bed between their bodies and met Sherlock's gaze expectantly.
"Come along. Let's get you to bed."
“John, please don’t blame me.” Sherlock beseeched, reaching out with his hand to palm John’s damp cheek and brush away the silent tears that fell.
John moaned, body tensing and shuddering all at the same time.
“Fast, suck and stroke faster.” John moaned pitchy, Sherlock immediately answering John’s plea.
So long he'd suffered and yet, it would seem his suffering was not over. They'd removed him from the hospital and taken him here. In a room that smelled of the alpha, which could only mean he was within the alpha's home.
"Right. Two French toasts, eggs, sausage, with coffee and orange juice, isn't enough substance. It's been two hours since then, of course you need to replenish." John moved to stand by Sherlock's side and smiled at the wall instead of at the flustering omega.
Victor Trevor stood before the alpha, staring emotionlessly at the alpha.
Sherlock looked away from his brother and out the window.
"This is one time I wish I hadn't been." Sherlock frowned, one hand gliding up the alpha's back to dip his fingers in soft blond hair and caressed it.
“It’s a Cock’s Comb flower.” Sherlock admired with an amused smile spreading across his face.
“We should go inside. Dinner will be served soon.” Sherlock advised, removing his hand and rising to his feet.
Harry’s eyes softened and without saying another word, she brought him in close, held him tightly against her and shushed him, as the tears started once again.
“Sherlock.” John hissed zealously.
John vaguely remembered the tour Mycroft gave him as his thoughts had wandered off and he contemplated other stressing things, so this was more of a refresher tour. He started downstairs and realized just how many grand rooms there were; all decorated in different themes, for different types of events. John had a feeling Mrs. Holmes liked to throw parties and he could just imagine the long suffering pain he would need to endure attending them.
"Stop with the dirty talk." John whined.
Sherlock shook as he frantically rushed to John’s side and ripped off the jacket of explosives from his body.
When John told his parents he joined the army, his father had blown a fuse and nearly murdered him, but his mother held him back. They’d pleaded with John to reconsider, to withdraw the proceedings of enlisting, but it was too late. John’s parents were forced then to call his intended’s parents and inform them of his choice. The parents of his intended hadn’t been as upset as John hoped they would be. He’d secretly wished they’d cancel the wedding and break ties with them, but apparently John being so damn rare a find, they’d decided to postpone the wedding until after John finished his tour.
John did. Omegas had great senses, the strongest. John’s omega curled in on itself in grief.
Mycroft inhaled a deep breath, and exhaled slowly as he calmed himself.
“John, you’re... Oh.” Sherlock huffed, the tips of his fingers fiddling with the head of his cock and John couldn’t stop himself from mimicking the motion on himself. He threw his head back and moaned out a cry, the warm build of satisfaction growing in his lower region as he fondled the crown of his cock. Staring over the expanse of his glistening with sweat chest and into Sherlock’s smoldering eyes, John shuddered with the trills of sexual enjoyment, and brazenly lowering his gaze to watch Sherlock masturbate himself.
Over and over again. Sherlock's breathing quickening, following the rush of his heart, and parting his lips, he keened with gratification.
"Victor." John whimpered, because the scent of the omega's distress hurt his heart. God, John had been such a fool. He'd been so wrong.
What are you doing here?" Sherlock cried out and John struggled to open his eyes, never having realized he'd shut them.
Mycroft felt Gregory’s eyes burning a hole into his head by the intensity of his stare.
” John bit his bottom lip as his thrusting became obscene, far less soft rubbings and more powerful pounding against Sherlock’s stomach, his jeans dampening further.
Sherlock lay behind him, awake. John knew Sherlock heard him cry out as he woke from his dream. It had woken Sherlock up too, but Sherlock wasn’t asking him about his dream, knowing very well what it was.
His quick steps turned to a sprint as he felt a sudden fear grow within him. When his alpha woke to find him gone, Sherlock didn't want to be here
"Hello." Gregory smiled warmly, as if Mycroft hadn't just tried to run away. "I... missed you."
“Urgh!” John groaned mortified as he recalled feeling so relaxed, warm and cared for and how his eyes became heavy and then he’d shut them in the starting of sleep.
"Sentiment is beyond your capacity to understand. You are heartless... Is that it?"
“We’ve wanted to meet you for so long John. We know you will provide our family with plenty of offspring.” Mrs. Holmes admired and John paled.
“Last night… I was overly stressed by everything that had happened.”
Sherlock told himself this time and time again as a child, but then… then he’d read John’s file. He’d seen a strong boy who fought against the world everyday of his life. Someone who was an outcast, much like himself, someone who wasn’t quick to trust, and even more less quick to let another in and he’d… Sherlock became fascinated. His experimenting came to a standstill as he’d struggled to figure out the real John and when he found he couldn’t, John beguiled him and he’d become emotionally compromised. Though John appeared normal, he was extraordinarily unique, a hidden treasure.
“Yours.” John answered weakly, shutting his eyes then and nuzzling Sherlock’s nose with his own in an Eskimos’ kiss, foreheads pressed together still.
“Where the bloody hell did you throw it!” Sherlock was screaming now and John stepped back in surprise.
“Yes. I— I hate to ask this of you, but do you think you could stay with John? Keep watch over him, you’re a beta and his heat would have no affect on you.”
“You don’t have to go if…” Sherlock began. The press was already hounding them, knowing this was far more painful for them since Moriarty was the reason for John being as good as barren.
Sherlock was a frustrating man. This was a truth John had accepted long ago, but Mycroft was a complete ass, John would never accept. As they were in the middle of a case, Sherlock was taken by the gentlemen’s agents and John was left with no other choice but to get back to London and find his husband.
That was all Sherlock had to think before he was up out of his chair and rushing for the front door, absentmindedly grabbing at his coat, scarf, and keys before he was out the door.
“Please answer, John. Do you like me?” Sherlock sounded at his limits.
“Oh, Sherlock, I’ve found him!” Mrs. Holmes squealed gleefully.
“Morning.” came the rasped answer to John’s muffled curses in the pillow under him.
“My deodorant.” Anderson deadpanned.
Sherlock couldn’t stop himself, and spun to face Lestrade to say shortly, “Oh, what now? I’m in shock! Look, I’ve got a blanket!” He even waved the edge of the blanket a bit for good measure.
John had given in to Sherlock's demand because he'd been blindsided by it. It was either he submit to Sherlock on camera or Sherlock leave home and possibly lose his life. So John had ignored every instinct to deny Sherlock's demands and submitted for the public viewing of others, but not again.
“Our pups… What about our pups? Are they okay?”
John absentmindedly nodded, staring in amazement; the home truly was aesthetically pleasing to look at. The home was of a Grecian style and had marble floors, artifacts from various time eras and countries were placed on the edges of the walls, showcasing their beauty.
John was appeased by this letter. He'd been miserable this last week without having the option of speaking with Sherlock, but this... this was enough. It was enough for someone like him. He'd continue to read Sherlock's letters, because he wanted a part of Sherlock. Reading these letters somehow made the separation hurt less.
Bowing his head, John shook that particular thought away. That couldn’t be. Sherlock would never bother looking for him. He just barely registered in Sherlock’s life. Not bothering to look at the alpha, John went upstairs to his newly appointed room and readied himself to go out. Might as well go to the local café, it was jazz night, and it would be best to keep his distance from Sherlock.
“You’re the one who shot him. Don’t blame me.” Sherlock pouted, absolutely amused.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Regardless of the peculiarity of Sherlock’s outburst, John smiled, heartened by the attractive wrinkles crinkling around Sherlock’s eyes and mouth as he laughed wholeheartedly.
“No.” Sherlock deadpanned, face void of emotion.
When Sherlock entered the room, falling to his knees before him; an alpha overcome by their omega’s welcomingly enticing scent and began nosing his ear with care, kind hands dotingly laying affectionate touches on him, John wept. Tears dampened John’s momentarily dry face at hearing the heart-wrenching whine of his alpha.
“Okay, bit of advice then: stay away from that guy.”
“What?” Gregory blanched. “You… You didn’t watch?”
John could feel his cock beating the hurried rhythm of his heart against the zipper of  his jeans, weeping from the lack of touch. Teenagers got more action in their short lives then John had allowed himself to feel and that was a terribly sad thought to have.
Heat rose to Sherlock's face, his blood boiling with the thought of it, but something triggered within him at Mycroft's words.
When John went on dates with female alphas and brought them home, Sherlock understood. John wasn't waiting for the perfect moment to present his offering. John didn't want him and as much as it hurt, Sherlock had accepted it. He'd
“You don’t love me.” John said softly, feeling a sense of devastating sorrow beyond the need.
Mycroft leaned forward against the desk, clasping his hands together, attempting to read John's thoughts.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sherlock rocked into John, fully entered and then slowly drew back, then slid gently in again and it was more than wonderful. Sherlock languidly glided along the magnificent place within, sending zinging waves of ecstasy to augment. There was pleasure, a slow burning that grew, that strengthened and consumed. Their breathing intensified with the feelings coursing through them, the strengthening of their bond. John’s omega needed and he willingly gave, letting it out and the warmth in his chest pulsed and John knew then that Sherlock could feel his omega’s call through the bond. Sherlock growled; his alpha’s possessiveness came to the forefront as Sherlock nipped and his fangs pinched at his lips, but never did they cut him. Sherlock’s alpha was too caring to hurt John and his omega keened, his plea filled the room.
"I'm sure that's not the case." John announced and turned the knob of the door.
"You're in love with him?" Mycroft whispered in disbelief.
“Where are you going?” Sherlock asked, facing the window, back to John as the omega bounded down the stairs and headed for the front door.
A voice offered up and Sherlock took its advice in quick strides.
“Mycroft.” Lestrade greeted.
John wanted to… He really wanted to.
scent.
“Are you angry with me?” Sherlock asked, stunned when he’d spoken without thought to.
Sherlock's stride lurched to a stop and he met John's gaze with a blank stare.
"Oh! How did I miss this?"
They made it to the hospital and John tried to help Sherlock out, but Sherlock still refused to be touched by his alpha and ignored his outstretched hands. He got out of the cab and seated himself in a wheelchair as a nurse came to meet them.
, but it wasn’t… It was
"I've been reading your blogs. You two are becoming rather famous."
Sherlock looked around them, half expecting to find the beta still there, but she was not in sight. A glance out the window was clear evidence that it had all been a hallucination. There was no sun of before, not mid-morning, but late night- some time in twilight.
“I can’t stand it.”
“He'll be okay with this. Witness protection, never seeing her again? He'll be fine.”
Sherlock met John in the kitchen after readying himself for the day. He intended to meet Molly after breakfast. She’d texted him early in the morning to let him know she had two pairs of human lungs for him.
"Sherlock, stop the fucking dirty talk already!" John complained, collapsing heavily onto the bed beside Sherlock and wrapped his own arms around the omega's belly.
After his discussion with John’s physician, Mycroft made his way over to a still waiting Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade to let them know John's state. He also assured Mrs. Hudson that if she waited a little more, she could go and see John as she was a beta and the only one that could cause John little stress. Mycroft thought it best Mrs. Hudson be there for John as she was one of the only ones John wanted near him at his most lowest.
"I've met a few alpha submissives before... for matchmaking services." Victor's smile faltered then, noticeably drawing inward. John realized someone as high class as Victor would want the best bond mate, and yet even when he'd had his chance to meet the very few alpha submissives, none had chosen him.
Lestrade was a good man, yes, but Lestrade was an alpha, and omegas were appealing to alphas. True, John was taking suppressants and his scent was a sexual put off, but the longer Lestrade spent with John, he could grow a fondness for Sherlock’s husband. Lestrade was a man of sentiment and if John wasn’t careful he could receive the affections of Lestrade.
Mycroft waited several long minutes before the doctor came to see him within the physician’s office and there, the doctor explained what Mycroft feared. Another omega drop, worse than the first. John was currently being restrained to a bed, violent, and suffering from delusions. His heart was being put under great stress and the doctor thought it best that they sedate him for some time. The doctor assured Mycroft that he’d be the first to know how John took it.
Sucking in a sharp breath as John tugged his pants and slacks down and off. Leaving him only in black dressing socks. Sherlock braced himself for John's scrutiny.
"Don't tell me that. Do it!" Sherlock snapped impatiently, wrapping his arms around his belly while turning enough so that his upper half faced John.
, John awoke something within and made his heart swell.
"No. Turn around." Sherlock grumbled after a brief moment of their embracing.
“That’s what I want mummy. I’ll marry such an alpha.” Sherlock promised proudly, knowing his mother would never find that kind of alpha and therefore ensuring he’d never mate.
"Yes..." John rasped out, choked up on emotion. He cleared his throat and added, "Yes of course I'm all right."
"Please..." Sherlock found the words falling off his lips before they even registered, his omega was present, ready and needing. No more inhibition, everything was coming out, no thoughts to be stifled by logic. No desires to be hindered and forced away. Sherlock, the genius, was no more. What lay beneath John now was the omega Sherlock.
sorry.” Sherlock weakly rasped in the darkness of the room.
None of this was right, but Sherlock took charge, made it appear as if he desired to claim his mate then, and not during his omega’s heat cycle, which was traditionally done. Mycroft stared on knowingly as Sherlock spun and dragged the struggling omega out of the room.
Sleep came sooner than the night before, but not too quickly. He’d spent long moments feeling the tenderness of his alpha’s caress before finally slipping into the darkness of sleep, but even in the darkness of sleep he felt the phantom-like kiss the alpha placed on his bond-bite and exhaled an edgy sigh.
“Just so.”
Not only had he made Sherlock vegetarian lasagna, but he'd also baked a carrot cake, and had to make a midnight stop at a 24hour grocery store to stock up on some more bananas. Apparently, Sherlock couldn't get enough of them and wanted them with everything, even waking up craving them.
They’d been married for ten months now and their marriage was barely hanging on. Sherlock was ever repressed and John gave up trying. As if things weren’t bad enough, Mycroft, of all people, was worried about them. He convinced John it wasn’t appropriate to stay nights at Lestrade’s and John had to agree with him. His omega never liked it, but it was hard to be in the same living quarters with Sherlock. Still, John minimized his stays with Lestrade, and only went when the tension between Sherlock and himself proved unbearable. Mycroft met up with John almost weekly attempting to convince him that talking with Sherlock was the best thing for them. Even if Sherlock couldn’t remember what they shared, if John would just tell him, maybe they could work their way back to what they’d once shared. John refused Mycroft, not because he didn’t want to have that closeness with Sherlock back, but because he was frightened Sherlock had not a heart left to give him.
Grunting noisily, Sherlock thrust up again, yanking John down with the hold on his hips in the same moment he thrust up and John bounced by the force, delightfully groaning when Sherlock struck that place within.
"I will never let you claim me as an alpha should claim an omega. You will become my bitch and I will use your body in any way I see fit. If I use your hole and strip you of the right to orgasm, if I use you to achieve pleasure and never give you any in return, it will be my right and you will have to accept it. Until I see that I am healed and then choose to leave you."
"Sherlock... Are you okay?" John was beyond the door; the concern was clear in his voice.
John’s eyes slowly met Sherlock’s focused gaze, held it within the silence, seeing concern and love reflecting in sea green. John broke their eye contact and looked at the ground. Placing a hand over his eyes, John released a pained groan of misery. He heard shuffling from where Sherlock was seated before strong arms wrapped around him and the shushing of a resonating voice echoed in his ears.
He would never concede. He'd never be accepting of this.
Sherlock grumbled groggily, shifting further until the sheets dropped under the alpha’s shoulders and to his waist as he turned around to face John. Sherlock said nothing as he met John’s gaze through the dimness of the room. The only light afforded to them was that of the city, seeping through the bedroom window as the curtains were open.
“Move. Slowly.” John encouraged, lowering his hands to grip to the alpha’s shoulders, holding tightly, expecting the flare of pain that would undoubtedly come.
Sherlock locked eyes with John as he took a deep inhale of nicotine. Holding his breath as he drew the fag away and leisurely dabbed the ashes over a saucer filled with used up butts of cigarettes, and resting on the arm of his chair.
“I know.
The omega let out a piercing scream as he came hard and soon after the alpha was tensing over him, shoving one final rough thrust in; he slammed his swelling knot deep and passed the rim of the omega’s entrance.
important you wished to speak to me privately?" Mycroft simpered.
John wordlessly entered the kitchen and started preparing them a late breakfast, though he expected Sherlock to refuse the meal. After he’d finished making biscuits and gravy, wirh a side of fruit salad, he set up the table and let Sherlock know breakfast was ready.
“I… I would like that.” John admitted cautiously, putting great efforts in looking everywhere but at his husband.
John frowned; there was the Sherlock he was familiar with.
Sherlock just squeezed John tighter, until it hurt, but it still felt good to John. He felt safe.
“Sod off.”
Sherlock took great efforts not to roll his eyes and instead nodded in confirmation.
There was a long pause and Mycroft contemplated if Lestrade was even listening to him anymore, most likely thinking about that bimbo—Mycroft gritted his teeth, hating himself for being so…sentimental. He didn’t care. Lestrade was just a polygamous alpha who didn’t understand the workings of a real heart. He wouldn’t waste his time thinking about a disloyal man like Lestrade.
“That doesn’t mean I like him. Just because people can be attractive doesn’t mean everyone wants them.”
John sat himself onto the bed, crawling back to the middle and staring up at Sherlock standing near the foot of the bed watching him with keenness.
“Thanks love.” Harry laughed and patted John’s leg before taking another sip from her cup of tea.
John’s leg — He actually did in a sense, since he’d bought John, but still, that was not the point.
"Need to get the powder burns out of your fingers. I don't suppose you'd serve time for this, but let's avoid the court case." Sherlock contemplated, unable to fathom why he cared to protect the alpha after all the wrong he'd committed against him, but if it hadn't been for the alpha, Sherlock would have been dead right now. So it was the least he could do and that was the point, it was the
“Sherlock?” John asked worriedly when he realized Sherlock was trembling.
“…body’s betraying me. Interesting, yes? Emotions.” Sherlock then slammed the glass to the table. “The grit on the lens, the fly in the ointment.”
John couldn’t let Sherlock be pushed into doing something like this. The photographs, the press, poor Mrs. Holmes would have a heart attack, and John really wouldn’t like everyone eyeing what was only meant for his eyes.
John couldn’t say anything, his eyes stung the longer he stared into Sherlock’s ocean blue. Sherlock looked tired, seeming to lack the sleep John himself was. There were bags under the omega’s eyes, his skin was a shade paler than usual, and his bottom lip was a deep red from the many times he’d chewed at it worryingly.
"I..." Sherlock slurred, forcing his eyes to remain open for a little while longer.
Loving someone one couldn't be with. That was the biggest travesty.
"You're beautiful Sherlock. These marks are proof of how you carry my love for you." John's voice was husky and grated in a way that made a shiver run down Sherlock's spine.
Sherlock knew just what buttons to press and maybe John was still feeling upset—what with Sherlock deleting him from his memory as if he were nothing. Sherlock punching him with no regard to who he was… well, that was the last straw. And yes, John knew he had anger issues, but was he really to blame for losing his temper and attacking Sherlock without hesitation after being treated less than a husband?
“Henry’s right.”
"Option nine: Sexy Lingerie."
Sherlock snarled at the alpha, lips partings to reveal his canines in a demonstration of dominance. Let the alpha come. Let him beat the sense into him. Let him hurt him and cause him a physical pain so great it dulled out the emotional heartache. His omega was a fool to trust a slut alpha like his true mate.
John slammed the laptop shut and stared blankly at the wall. He didn’t know what the hell to do or how he should feel after watching the lessons. A part of him was intrigued, but another part of him felt just as equally unsettled. Shaking his head, John retrieved the DVD’s and broke them into pieces. He threw the broken pieces in the bathroom trashcan and covered the evidence with toilet paper. He didn’t want to risk his alpha finding out what he’d been watching. John placed the laptop on the coffee table of the bedroom sitting area and then prepared himself for another shower.
"Hello my darlings."
That was what confused Sherlock the most. John was just the omega his parents forced onto him, someone he’d be stuck with. But it didn’t quite feel like a burden, more like a gift the longer he spent with the omega. Sherlock appreciated John’s medical knowledge as they worked cases, how the omega kept their home tidy, how the omega always prepared his meals (though most times he refused to eat or ate little), how at night the omega would wrap his arms around him and hold him so close, and so much more. Sherlock liked all of these things.
I’m his husband. Please, save him.” Sherlock implored despairingly.
“You’re sure?” Sherlock had to ask, and John’s omega thrilled by the consideration that his mate gave.
“L— Listen!” John shouted, panicking himself, needing Harry to listen, not jump the gun and plan his husband’s death, being that at this very moment John would rather be sitting himself on Sherlock's alpha cock and fucking his heat away.
John’s lips pursed, but words were lodged in his throat; unable to speak, he stared blankly at the alpha.
"You are remarkably good at it. Don't do it again until after you give birth. I don't think I can take it and not ravish the hell out of you."
A loaded silence was his answer.
Sherlock let loose a sound of pure joy, stood from his seat and engulfed John in his arms. “My beautiful John.”
are you here?” Sherlock grumbled back.
“John.”
“Why?”
“John.” Sherlock rasped thickly, kissing the welt more firmly now, scenting the sadness his action had caused.
“Thank you, Sherlock.” John’s tired eyes stung as he whispered his gratitude.
.” John hummed lovingly. “My sweet repressed Sherlock.”
Sherlock smiled kindly down at John, a large hand layered itself over John’s caressing the alpha’s cheek.
Sherlock’s brows raised higher, his lips pursed and for a moment the two stared at one another. John trying hard to hide his smile, but then Sherlock snorted with hilarity and then the two were giggling, choking past their laughter, staring at one another with such warmth—the arctic could melt.
Trying to catch his breath, John felt helpless when his stomach knotted and a swarm of butterflies quivered within his stomach. Time seemed to pass by slowly and the longer John stared into Sherlock’s eyes the more he lost himself in them… They looked at him in a way that… Had Sherlock always looked at him like that…?
“With this ring, I thee wed. With my body, I thee worship. And with all my worldly goods, I thee endow.”
Sherlock laughed heartily.
"Come now, John, give me a check up." Victor encouraged, gesturing to the stool nearby.
“I’m here.” Sherlock whispered into John ear.
John turned away for a brief moment, inhaling passed the throbbing pain of his aching heart.
"You may now lay claim to your mate." The priest said and Sherlock became crazed with madness.
” A light went off in Sherlock’s mind, suddenly understanding everything and then a look of regret crossed his features and he began apologizing. “John, I’m sorry, I—”
“John…” Ella softly spoke; waiting until John’s hands lowered and deep blue stared up at her full of helplessness and grief.
“What?”
. I absolutely love how ravenous your appetite has become. It means our pups will be quite large and healthy." John subtly moved his face close enough to scent his husband, inhaling a long breath of Sherlock's scent.
“I…” Sherlock cut himself off, palmed his eyes and took in deep measured breaths.
“You should have called if you were planning on staying out so late.”
Mycroft frowned. He hadn’t come to talk about his personal tendencies.
“Sometimes?”
The anal hole was drizzling out a clear liquid, self lubrication. The rim of his hole was inflamed, and an angry red, but it was open, twitching, pulsing, and attempting to close itself around air. The alpha inserted one finger inside and the rim instantaneously contracted around it, the omega mewling pitifully, knowing it wasn’t enough.
Opening his eyes, he found his sister’s soft blue staring with panic down at him, her claws embedded deep into his arm. John blinked several more times, coming to realize that the car engine was off and Harry was seated awkwardly between the passenger seat and his own.
This was something Mycroft continuously told himself when meeting up with the DI in regards to Sherlock’s health. He couldn’t understand why he felt the need to remind himself of these things, but he had, and he assuredly did, each and every time. Then Sherlock recovered and found an anchor in his love for John that kept him from straying to the use of drugs. Mycroft’s visits with Gregory lessened until they’d completely stopped. But even after he stopped meeting with Gregory, he found himself thinking about the DI from time to time.
"Do what?"
Now, after meeting with Gregory once more, he found himself completely at a loss for how to feel. Gregory had unashamedly flirted with him and expressed an interest. It was all so strange and disconcerting.
“I’m here.” Sherlock croaked, at last finding his voice.
"You've upset your alpha quite a lot. You should have heard him this morning. I do believe he was on the verge of tears when he called me." Mycroft smirked and moved towards the car awaiting them.
"How would you know? How would I know? We've only just met him."
"No, you aren't." John approached Sherlock cautiously as the omega struggled to put on his maternity trousers. They no longer fit.
Each admission of love brought with it pained distressed moan, whine, and a whimper of ‘
"Mm." Sherlock answered noncommittally.
“John.” Sherlock whispered unsure of himself.
Having Sherlock practically begging him to sleep with him was startling and a bit sad. Sherlock was so bloody gorgeous, he shouldn't have to beg for what John would so willingly do, for himself just as much as for Sherlock. Therefore, it was saddening that Sherlock couldn't see it. John would prove it to Sherlock now. He'd show him, with his words and body, just how much he desired him.
"No. I never wanted to lie to you Sherlock. I'm not hiding anything else."
"A gift." John smiled. "For the both of us."
Still… Sherlock said nothing, but he stared so intently that John didn’t have to be an expert in deducing to know Sherlock really wanted to ask him something.
Throughout his punishment, John had remained relatively still, though the noises he made, hisses and deep groans, Sherlock imagined many would find pleasure in hearing, caused him his own sense of gratification. Those hisses and groans were not of enjoyment or pleading for more.
“Mm.” John’s eyes were warm pools of affection that sent heat rising to Sherlock’s pale features.
John said nothing.
Moving closer to the glass box, Sherlock raised out a hand and lowered it down a ways from the pups. Both followed his moments closely, and after a brief pause the two rose from the group of five that all at once started licking and hopping near the edge.
“Hello?” came the jovial greeting.
The alpha and his inner omega didn't want this, but to hell with his wolf. His wolf was battered down, broken and lost because of this alpha and he didn't deserve forgiveness for that. For what John had done to him with his carelessness. There was no letting that go.
John cried out, falling back to the ground, curling in on himself. Sherlock’s ears rang with the long ago piercing of a gunshot, and it sent his heart into painful constricting pulses. The screaming of John’s agonized cries only fanned the flames of rage within. Sherlock never thought once about killing another person, not as he thought now. Moriarty would pay with his life. He couldn’t let his emotions and fears overwhelm him, not in this moment. The only emotion that reached him was rage and he’d hold onto it until Moriarty lay dead at his feet.
A cake with layers set up like a fancy staircase, wrapped in blue frosting ribbons and purple flowers. At the very top layer of the cake was handmade figurines that resembled Sherlock and John’s likeness.
"Do it." Sherlock requested softly and John nervously nodded his head in affirmation of the knowledge that this was the moment. This was the moment that they would be finally consummating their marriage.
"To hell with your bloody traditions. I will annihilate anyone who tries!" Sherlock might just be a
He asked more than once for Sherlock to change the ring tone, but Sherlock ignored him. Even Mrs. Hudson tried, but Sherlock never changed it.
Mycroft didn’t date, this was true. He’d never been with anyone and he didn’t wish to be. There were times the loneliness kept him up at night and his grief would eat at him. His alpha within whining and grieving over his lost omega, but Mycroft never expressed those feelings outside of the privacy of his home.
Gregory almost laughed. Eight months wasn't too bloody soon, but then he knew that this was Mycroft. Sherlock warned him to be slow and gentle, because although Mycroft wouldn't admit it, he was innocent in every way a partner could be.
“Because you’re an asshole!”
John never spent his days off with him anymore, and Sherlock shouldn’t care — he didn’t.
“Yes, why?” Sherlock stressed.
John assumed the pommel was the front of the saddle as Sherlock patted it once before offering up the reins to him. John securely placed his foot in the stirrup, his left hand gripping Sherlock’s and the reins, while his other tightened around the pommel. While lifting himself over the saddle, John felt Sherlock’s hand palm the back of his leg and guide him so that he was now comfortably seated over the horse.
Shortly after John finished his second shower that morning, there was a knock on his bedroom door. He hesitantly opened it and found an elderly man standing across from it. The man had introduced himself as the Holmes’ chauffeur and that Mycroft Holmes had informed him that John would need a ride to London for an appointment.
“You regret the past, but that shouldn’t stop you from making a future with him. John, you are tremendously lucky, not many omegas end up with an alpha who will love them like the way your alpha seems to.”
John smiled sadly and shook his head. His eyes dampening, but John would not cry, damn it. Not again. Not again in front of Sherlock.
. So beautiful, so strong, so…
Later, after they had solved the case, John seated himself in his red chair and typed away on his blog.
"Let my fingers move, Sherlock." John insisted and Sherlock took measures to relax his nervous clenching.
” Sherlock screamed, trembling wracking his words.
"You copulated with someone else."
“No, mother.” Sherlock disagreed, leaning in close, far too close to be decent and brushed his nose against John’s, marking him further with his scent before pulling away and smiling lovingly at Mrs. Holmes.
“What? No. Lestrade, I can’t take your bed.”
“I’m not so old.” John answered with amusement.
.” Sherlock hurriedly breathed repentantly, diving back and claiming John’s lips in an apologetic kiss.
John's hands wasted no time when he took hold of Sherlock's belt. Only did those confident hands halt their progression when Sherlock's gripped his wrists. John pulled back enough so to meet Sherlock's stare and soon noticed the open shame that blossomed upon his omega's features.
“Sherlock… isn’t the easiest person to handle and he wouldn’t like the terms of which you were matched. In the end though, how you two met isn’t as important as to how you make this bond work. Lying about how you met is a small sacrifice you’ll be making to ensure your sister lives.” Mycroft contemplated.
His intended released him of his hold, yet raised his left hand expectantly. John hurriedly fished through his pocket for the ring his mother gave him and roughly and with less care than his intended used, shoved the ring over his pale left ring finger.
John might as well be honest. It wasn’t like he had anything truly invested in this arrangement. Why should he care?
“Do you ever see me as a man?”
"Sherlock?" John waited.
Sherlock never came…
Sherlock took that as a well-deserved complement, his eyes turning murky with want, John looked so helpless under him. John's hips shifted uncomfortably under him, shifting turning into needing upwards thrusts.
“She doesn't want anything. She got in touch; she informed us that the photographs existed. She indicated that she had no intention to use them to extort either money or favor.”
John glanced over to it, contemplating his options.
Then The Woman came and Sherlock failed. He kept hurting John and now John was pulling away. It shouldn’t have bothered Sherlock, but it did. Now, he sat up in an empty bed, knowing that the omega had left him, most likely to take the spare room and there was nothing he could do. Of course there was something he could do, but his pride wouldn’t let him. Sentiment was a weakness, and Sherlock could not afford to be weak. Still, his pride could do nothing to soothe the pain in his throbbing heart.
John didn’t touch their joint account; his new account was far more than enough for him. Though John didn’t think he’d ever really use the money on himself, he decided it was more than alright if he used it for their home and caring for Sherlock.
John took Sherlock’s hand in both of his and pressed kind kisses to his knuckles as Dr. Levy lubed up the wand in her hand.
Sherlock could vaguely hear his brother's call, but he didn't look away from the wall.
“Sherlock! Manners, dear.” Mrs. Holmes scolded.
Sherlock squirmed in his seat at the top of the stands, his breathing irregular, lips dry, fingers wringing at themselves.
Mrs. Holmes suddenly announced she would call Sherlock then and John watched as Mrs. Holmes surprise-attacked Sherlock about John’s presence. John couldn’t hear Sherlock’s response, but he wasn’t sure if his intended would be so eager to meet him. From what he’d heard, Sherlock wasn’t all that open to the idea of bonding.
"You really are... a wonderful man." Sherlock clasped his hands over his lap and scanned John's eyes for something, what that was only Sherlock knew. But he seemed to find whatever it was and smiled warmly.
Sherlock nodded in confirmation. Lestrade could be trusted, but the others—Omegas were sensitive creatures and their pregnancies were temperamental, too much stress could cause an omega to have a miscarriage. Sherlock couldn’t risk that. Sally and Anderson, especially, if not checked, could overwhelm John and God-forbid, that amount of stress could cause a miscarriage.
"Come here." John ordered, because if Sherlock didn't come to him now, he was going to go over to Sherlock and fuck him at the edge of the bed.
John swallowed audibly, lying back on the mattress, completely exposed to Sherlock’s viewing pleasure. The city lights casting an orange glow upon his body and revealing the swelling softness of his belly. Sherlock groaned low, contented.
John sat in silence, staring blankly at the door leading out of the bedroom. His alpha didn’t want to claim him now? He’d implied as much to their parents.
John said nothing, only stared at Mary, and contemplated if he had the courage to do what he knew he should.
John stared at Sherlock like he'd lost his mind and maybe he had. Laughing uproariously, Sherlock giggled along with the alpha.
“People die. It’s not interesting enough for me. Really, Lestrade, you should know by now my preferences.”
Mycroft pursed his lips all while Sherlock inhaled a deep breath, muscles tensing, fists clenching and unclenching over the armrests of his chair. He wished so intensely that his hands could wrap themselves around the government official's neck and he could watch the life drain from his face.
“Done.”
Sherlock's eyes snapped open, lips parted wide, breathlessly gasping as he watched the pleasure dance around John's face. John's eyes squinted in pained bliss, fangs protruding from his mouth bit into his own bottom lip and Sherlock groaned at the scent of John's bitter blood. So arousing. Unbelievably arousing.
"I'm sorry for that, but... I was lonely. You and I, we weren't... and you were never clear how you felt, but I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have done that. I was drunk, Mycroft. I did something foolish and I regret it. I regret because of my mistake... I've hurt you and made it hard for you to ever want anything. Given what happened to your omega, I can only imagine--"
.” Sherlock’s voice was filled with emotions, the most prominent being that of grief and love.
When alone, John’s touches became positively amorous. John planted numerous kisses on Sherlock, one for when greeting in the morning, another after meals, a firm one when one of them left the room and another one when meeting again, one when Sherlock said something that pleased John, kisses at the nape of his neck when Sherlock kindly made them tea, a kiss to the temple when Sherlock was focused on an experiment or working hard to solve a case.
The chiming of his mobile rang and John retrieved it to see he’d received a text from an unknown number, but not an unknown sender.
No. That voice didn't ring out like it would in his mind. This voice was real. Raising his eyes up from the ground in front of him, Sherlock found who the voice belonged to. Mycroft stood no more than two feet away from him, head tilted to the side, eyes narrowed in deliberation.
This guy, a junkie? Have you met him!” John defended.
"Myself." Sherlock sighed, this wasn't the first time John had given him warning about his social inadequacy.
"Okay? You won't leave?"
John brewed himself a pot of tea and just as he’d seated himself with a cup, Mycroft’s phone rang. The pale gentleman answered it on the third ring and received the news John already knew himself.
“You’re my husband. I’ll tell them. I promise.”
Forking at his eggs absentmindedly, John’s ears perked when he heard his name. Raising his eyes and meeting the icy stare of Mycroft, John realized he’d been asked a question, but for the life of him, he didn’t know what it had been.
“I’m an omega and… it is a strong possibility that we’ll have a full litter. The flat is large, but not large enough for us to share separate rooms.”
“Do you think that means I should forgive you so easily, when, because of you, I’ve lost our pups? We’ve lost everything. Do you think that your regret will make me forgive you? It doesn’t.”
real?” Sherlock contemplated aloud, the hotness of his tongue dragging the bridge of John’s chest to lay the same attention on his omega’s neglected nipple.
"No? Not dirty enough." Sherlock gathered from the alpha's response.
"What?" John was furious. This wasn't right. Sherlock was smarter than this. He always found a way out. "No, no, no, no, no, no. This is a trick."
John stared on in silence.
Snarling threateningly at the alpha, Sherlock once more shoved his touch away and rounded the kitchen table to prepare himself a cup of tea.
“You look…” Sherlock paused, scrounging his mind for the appropriate word.
They hadn’t even stepped one foot into the building when a lanky man exited, glaring hotly at them.
“I have a web site.”
“John?” Sherlock said slowly, trying to derive the change in him.
"I'm sorry if you're not ready for this, but I need to scent you. We've been without each other for too long."
He did. John knew this already, it was one of the many things he couldn’t help but worry over.
"Shhh. I'm okay. I will be." Sherlock amended the last part.
much. Too much pleasure. His body wanted more of it though, and all he could do was try not to strangle John with his clamping thighs, ill attempts at thrusting up, and cock seeding his mouth.
What has gotten into you?” Came the disapproving grumble of Mr. Holmes.
John smiled at his sister who looked so healthy after the surgery. No longer was she sickly pale, no longer was she so drained of energy she could barely keep awake, no longer did John have to worry that was going to be the last time he’d see her alive. Because of his sacrifice, Harry would live.
“Play with me.” Sherlock pouted sullenly.
John smiled weakly at Sherlock's kind words. This was why John loved him so much. Sherlock was always so kind and accepting of even the little crumbs John could offer.
“Hmm?” Sherlock raised an inquisitive brow, seemingly set at ease by the smoothness of John’s cadence.
After Sherlock had left him on the cold ground, covered in his release, feeling used and abused, John could have given in. He could have broken down there, given up, and fled, but that wasn't him. Most importantly, that was what Sherlock wanted. Sherlock wanted to hurt him and he had, but he wasn't going to fall. He had to be strong for those he loved, mainly Mary and Sherlock.
“Sherlock.” John whispered anxiously, his body pulsed with nerves, and yet there was also excitement within that started as a flame and steadily grew.
"The son didn't do it." Sherlock said, ignoring the looks he was receiving by everyone and instead choosing to circle the dead man on the ground.
“Didn't do you any good, did it?”
“Who are you? What do you do?”
What are you thinking Sherlock? You need to go have tests done. Why are you -?"
“Which is fine, by the way.” John stuttered, losing his nerve.
“Just…” John stressed, stilling his words, he bit his tongue and took deep breaths. “Forget it.”
“John… I
“Thanks, I think.” Harry answered tersely.
I am able. You will sleep in the spare. If we consummate our bond, then you can go back to your wife for all your sex. If you need to do things in bed she does not wish to, then find a rent boy, or a third. I don't care. I will only let you defile my body with your kinks once and only once, if I can stomach it."
Sherlock let out soft deep groans and John couldn’t control himself anymore as he came so hard, his back arched off the bed and Sherlock’s throat relaxed to take in the spurting load of John’s seed.
Moriarty exhaled a heavy breath, the look of disappointment marring his features as he stared at Sherlock. Silently contemplating his options.
"I'm sorry for being such an ass in the past."
Sherlock felt strong arms wrap around his waist and soft supple lips graze the back of his neck. He finally took notice that the sun had risen and John was awake.
Lestrade laughed softly, staring at the shut door and sighed heavily.
Rocking and grinding down against John's fat thumb, feeling the hardness of his alpha's cock. The bulbous head of John's cock drizzled pre-come, wetting his stout cock in it and then--
John sat heavily onto the floor and remained in a daze.
"It's time. It's
“That's what people
Sherlock knew John regretted lying. He knew he should forgive him and he wanted to. He really wanted to, but... he just couldn't forget the betrayal.
John knew what Mycroft was insinuating. “You think this is Moriarty?”
“Please.” John keened, raising to his feet, pausing in his movements briefly when another rush of unsatisfying desire washed over him, the wetness of his leaking cock further dampening his pants and slacks.
“I was foolish, thinking things I shouldn’t have, as I’ve stated before. It was nothing…”
Mycroft prepared to explain that the agent should do as the rest before him had, yet stopped himself before he could. Deciding that this routine of Gregory's needed to stop once and for all.
“And you are always smiling around me… It’s creepy.”
“You’re beautiful.” Sherlock admired, bright eyes softening with fondness and before John had time to respond or react, Sherlock was cupping his jaw, raising his head somewhat so that John met his piercing stare.
Sherlock tugged again, and followed with stroking his thumb over John’s slit, wiping away the pearly white pre-come to use it as further lubrication for jerking John off in firm strokes.
“Mmm. We've hardly stopped for breath since this thing started. Has it occurred to you—?”
“They care for each other?” John led, confessing, hopeful.
Sherlock’s raised his head to stare back up at John when he detected the gruffness of it.
“Turn around and walk back the way you came.”
Sherlock once read somewhere that an obsession took 2 to 3 years to break. He told himself that was what this was, but when year 4 came and went, and his feelings only grew, Sherlock knew he’d been done in. Obsession wasn’t what this was. Sherlock could scarcely admit to himself that he’d somehow, unbelieving as it was, he’d fallen in love and he couldn’t seem to break this affection welded deep within his heart.
“I’ll be heading off as soon as I finish breakfast… There are some things I need to do.”
“Thanks!” John griped, huffing out a breath of aggravation and decided to focus on calming his nerves.
Pulling away enough so to meet Sherlock's gaze, John palmed his mate's flushed cheek and smiled down at him.
"Isn't that what I just did? Really, unneeded, Sherlock."
Sherlock reminded himself daily that this townhouse was only temporary, and that soon they'd be back to their real home, and out of this suburban-like setting. For the meantime, this home would have to do. Sherlock could appreciate the quietness of the neighborhood, the fact they had a beautiful terrace, and the quietness would help with the whole romantic mood he was trying to set.
“I thought you hated apologizing?”
The silence grew heavy, loaded, so unlike how it’d been months before, but things were changing… Changing for John… Sherlock’s knot slowly receded until at last his cock slipped from out of him. John didn’t waste time as he rose from Sherlock’s bed—or was it their bed? He’d been sleeping in it since day one of moving in, but not as of the last two months, and that was what mattered.
“I’m looking.” John whispered brokenly, unable to stop the pain of his heart from reflecting out of his eyes.
"Sherlock!" John cried out with worry and rushed to his omega. Before he could lay a hand on Sherlock, the omega raised another hand up to bid John not touch him.
An agent hurried to open the door and Mycroft slid in. Sherlock glared at the older man as he turned to look at him expectantly. Inhaling a deep breath, Sherlock followed him inside and the door was shut after him.
Sherlock's cell chimed and the omega hurled himself at it, gripping tightly to it as he read the text message.
“You don’t think he is?” Lestrade smirked knowingly and took a swig of his beer.
John stared hard at the roses, yet he was still unable to take in people standing at the center end of the altar, and although everything in him was telling him not to look. Knowing that if he looked he’d finally have to face the truth, face his future, his tormenting sentence in an unwanted marriage. Knowing all of this could not stop him, and he lowered his gaze. A priest with graying hair, sunken sad eyes and large glasses stood on a podium holding to his chest a silver bible that glistened even from where John stood. The priest looked annoyed, impatient and John could understand why. The wedding was supposed to have started thirty minutes ago, but John had spent that time fighting his mother tooth and nail on wearing his tuxedo.
“What? John, please—”
Eighty eight… Eighty nine… Ninety…
“Sherlock!” John hissed.
“I’m tired.”
“I saw it too, John.”
“Hm?”
“What do you want from me Sherlock?”
"John..." Sherlock rasped through the darkness of John's clenched eyes.
“Is he eating?”
Sherlock hummed louder, growing all the more confident, smile tensed as he took in John to the hilt, nose burying deep in blond hair and driving John wild by the sight of it.
“That I chose it for him especially, right?” Sherlock added, and his eyebrows rose expectantly.
Sherlock’s felt his eyes crinkle by how hard he was smiling now.
“You made reservations?” John attempted to amend the tension between them.
"No. I'm not... I... You..." Sherlock's hands lay uselessly at his sides, clenching and unclenching around air.
“No.” John grumbled, lowering his gaze to glare at the oriental red carpet.
“I have some.”
Sherlock refused to talk to John. Refused to wait for him to enter the flat for fear that he’d scent the other alpha on John. He wasn’t sure what he’d have done if he scented Lestrade on John.
Sherlock's omega might want John, but not the logical part. The omega side was breaking free, but Sherlock's tenacious will hindered its progress. Sherlock wasn't powerful enough to hold it off for long, his sense of logic would fade out. Then the primal need within would force him to take actions he might not have allowed otherwise.
Mycroft was in a right tizzy after the events, trying to get Sherlock exonerate for the murder he'd committed in front of over a dozen agents. But to no avail. Sherlock would be sentenced to preform a mission for six months, and that mission would undoubtedly lead to his death. This, he and Sherlock kept from John.
Somehow his parents coaxed him into moving and led him to the reception hall. There were many tables elegantly decorated and his parents went to take their reserved seats. As they did this, Harry dragged John over to the open bar and ordered him the hardest liquor they had. There the two drank in grim silence, and John knew he should have stopped his sister from drinking so much, but he was too preoccupied imaging the hell of a life he was sentenced to live for the rest of his life.
a man.”
“You’re right, I deduced your past the very moment I saw you, Afghanistan was one of two possibilities I considered. You might wish to shower affection on me, but I must warn you that your efforts will be a waste of time. I have no desire to be a proper husband or mate, don’t expect more than civility from me, John Watson.” Sherlock snarled his name with viciousness and John flinched at the blatant rejection.
Sherlock thought to himself discontentedly.
“No! That’s not—” John paused to lower his voice, unwilling to be goaded by his husband. “Sherlock, this is ridiculous.”
“We’ll heal each other.” Sherlock answered wetly and John whimpered under him.
John powered off the alpha’s mobile and tossed it to the ground before pouncing, sucking possessively on Sherlock’s flushed neck and the alpha whimpered under him.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
"What do you mean nothing happened? Who did this to you?" the alpha demanded. Anger thickly laced in his voice, that anger being directed to the one that caused Sherlock's state.
Sherlock hummed in the pillow, shutting his eyes, and sought the feel of John's ministrations. Slow and gentle, his finger slid in and out, his entrance contracting around the intruding finger, enjoying the stroking. If felt foreign - though they'd done this during his heat, it was a change.
"I know you didn't want this, but I am prepared for you to hate me if it means you will live, so hate me all you want."
"You feel so wet. I didn't think you'd be this..."
“Sherlock…
“I’ve been so distant though.” John found Sherlock’s admission hard to believe.
“Excuse me?”
, some acknowledgement would be welcomed.
John’s brows furrowed, not sure how to take Sherlock’s last confession, but it still made him feel good.
"I... He threatened me. He'd gotten hurt that day and... if I hadn't done it, I don't know what he would have done to himself."
It was a painful truth that John was still trying to come to terms with, but the way this man said it clinically without feeling, tore at his heart.
His belly… John knew Sherlock wanted to see it. The pouch confirming John was full of Sherlock’s pups.
“Yes.”
John began to picture their life as a family, raising their children, happily. John and Sherlock would divide their time caring for their pups and Mrs. Hudson would babysit as they’d go out on cases. They’d be there to see their children say their first word, see them stand and take their first steps and John would forever feel the warmth of a family and the love of his alpha. John needed so much for this dream of a future to become a reality.
“First, you tell me I have a lovely laugh.”
Walking down the rows of dogs within a pet store, Sherlock was unable to choose a pet. It was a Holmes tradition. Before Mycroft and Sherlock were born, his mother had gone and gotten them a dog of their own. Mycroft was gifted a cream colored borzoi and Sherlock was gifted a red Irish setter.
alpha! I told you before, I don’t need another lover!”
“You’ll get lost.” A voice broke in and John jumped, startled,
He'd left Sherlock to be miserable alone, all so he could speak to Mycroft, and what he meant by speaking, he meant-
are two different things. Trying means you’ll open up to me and accept me. All you’ve been is civil rather than being the frigid omega you were our first night.” Sherlock’s voice lowered several octaves, turning spiteful.
“My pretty, pretty, Sherlock. Going to stuff you full.” John growled feral-like. As he took his mate, he took possession of Sherlock's claim mark, biting into it, though there was no need, but for the need of his alpha seeking to reaffirm Sherlock was truly his.
Sherlock remained voiceless for a long moment, staring searchingly into John’s eyes.
Biting into his bottom lip, Sherlock searched John's features. Attempting to find anything other than disbelief, something that would give him a hint whether he was asking for too much. If so, he could make up an excuse and bolt, but he found no such hint. So he continued.
“You stopped taking suppressants? Why?” Sherlock hadn’t realized this important change in John’s life, though he’d been busy working a case and that could have been the reason for missing this important change.
“You shouldn’t be out here in your condition.” Sherlock reprimanded, hurriedly breaking the distance between them, shrugged off his coat and without a word wrapped it around John.
” Sherlock laughed unsteadily, knowing he was going just a bit insane, completely enthralled and done in by
Afterward, they lay in each other’s arms, hands stroking at skin, soothing and caring, and John fell asleep once more. During heats omegas bred then slept before breeding once more. Sleeping helped an omega rejuvenate for another vigorous go. Alphas, unlike omegas, did not need as much sleep, so after Sherlock had his fill of rest he’d taken to cleaning them both with wet towels while John slept. But even in his sleep, John felt the alpha rub a damp towel over his body, and he’d momentarily felt refreshed before slipping into a deep slumber.
It wasn’t like Sherlock didn’t know how to be faithful. Sherlock hadn’t slept with anyone else since they’d started whatever it was they had between them. Or at least John didn’t think so. Sherlock spent all his nights with him for three whole years and most of their days were spent at the flat and working cases. There were the time gaps were John was at work or shopping and Sherlock was experimenting or exploring leads alone, but John never scented another on the alpha. There was also the fact that whenever someone flirted with Sherlock his face would contort to one of malicious intent or disgust. Why couldn’t Sherlock refuse an omega and remain exclusively John’s?
Sherlock stilled, frozen in place, not because he lacked the ability to fight the alpha off, but because he was stopped by the painful amazement that the alpha was still trying. Sherlock wanted to curse him, yell at him, hit him, but he really didn't think that it would change anything.
No. Sherlock wouldn’t bother deleting him. John didn’t matter enough for Sherlock to delete, unless it was to make space for other information the consultant deemed more useful and needed.
"You went through my things?" John snapped, all soft warm good feelings vanishing.
Although he rather loved that idea and knew he’d feel ultimate satisfaction from the arrogant ponce’s death, Sherlock couldn’t do it. No, he
“Well, because… It just wouldn’t.” John really didn’t know what he was saying.
John watched, mildly disturbed Sherlock could dismiss their conversation so quickly in place of a—albeit interesting case. The moment Sherlock let Lestrade in,  the D.I. began debriefing the consultant on the case and urging him to go with him to the crime scene. Sherlock didn’t even pause before agreeing, retrieving his coat, scarf, and gloves.
The room once cool now felt boiling hot, humid, heavily laced in his pheromones, Sherlock’s scent completely absence, drowned out by his own. Scorching clammy wetness soaked his pants and sweats. John could hardly do much in the fog of heat.
” John keened, legs buckling under him and he fell to his knees, his omega took over wholly and his stinging eyes met the kind blue of his alpha.
“Would you like a bouquet of cocks?” John found himself adding and laughed all the harder by the dazed look Sherlock sent him.
“Let me be your omega.”
That hurt… That really,
Mycroft turned to leave and entered a nearby elevator, contemplating whether or not he should tell Sherlock. Mycroft didn’t think that was the smartest of choices, being as Sherlock wouldn’t be able to focus on his work if he knew and might end up getting himself killed with thoughts of John being in the state he was in now.
"Come here." Sherlock encouraged, tapping over his chest and John, smiling, did.
Harry, if you don’t shut up about this right now, I’ll leave.”
"Shush."
Sherlock was delighted and John buried his face against the tall man’s chest, inhaling his alpha’s scent.
“Nothing. I don’t know. You could probably say thank you, actually.”
… you.”
“It’s a lovely cock isn’t it?” Sherlock teased and sent John into a frenzy of laughter.
“What could I need from you?” Sherlock seriously couldn’t understand Molly.
He enjoyed the gentle touch of his mate. This had been happening since their heat. The touching. John had been more... affectionate. Physically touching him more than ever before. Where they'd once only touched when assisting each other rise from seats, falls, and attending to wounds brought on through The Work, they now...
answer.
"I'm sorry, John." Mycroft spoke remorsefully. "I'm so very sorry."
Sherlock gave a full body shiver, nails lengthening and in the next moment the sound of sheets tearing was heard beyond the sucking and panting.
“John?” Sherlock persisted.
“Sherlock…” John softened, attempting to relax his features and groaned at how sappy this felt.
“You care, don’t you?” John whimpered, nuzzling the alpha’s nose with his own.
When John sat straddling his lap, knees butting against Sherlock's hips and squeezed in close by the arm rests of the chair, Sherlock allowed himself to look over the alpha's body as if he appreciated the sight. His hands palmed the man's hips and slowly stroked up and down his sides.
“He went out. A couple of hours ago.”
"Size." Sherlock's flushed cheeks grew deeper in their shade.
There came a strangled whine, followed by a sniffle that had Sherlock curiously glancing back at John. Finding the alpha stubbornly wiping his wet eyes, while looking at him as if... as if Sherlock were the most amazing thing on this earth, well that was... It just was... was.
John wore a thin gray t-shirt, thin enough that Sherlock could feel the warmth of the toned physique.
“Oh! Good.
“I should wash up.” John murmured faintly, shoving Sherlock away with more force that he’d expected and Sherlock remained kneeling on the ground watching, pained when John rose from the floor and stumbled away.
“H— Har— Harry.” John wheezed breathlessly.
, John wasn’t saying this right.
“Rise up and spread your legs for me.” Sherlock graveled.
Lessons on mating, really? John knew how sex worked. He was a doctor for Christ’s sake. But… He’d never…with anyone, so… There were things books didn’t necessarily teach and John honestly didn’t really know much about alpha and omega rut/heat cycles, apart from alpha’s mounted an omega and that omegas were to be knotted to ensure impregnation.
Several long moments came and went before Sherlock heard shuffling from John's end.
"Ah, to give me time to bond with
Sherlock struggled to get John Watson out of his mind, and spent many nights lying in bed, holding the now tattered, faded towel in his hand and thinking about his omega. The towel no longer smelled of his omega, but Sherlock had been sure to catalog John’s scent within his mind. What had once started as mere curiosity had developed over the years. Sherlock received files monthly after the first he’d requested from Mycroft. Each time, Sherlock was filled with excitement and fascination. John Watson beguiled him.
Gregory had always known he wasn’t completely straight. Although he’d never acted on his desires, he would notice a handsome man, and he’d wonder what it would feel like to embrace them. His cock would jolt with the sudden thought of touching and being touched by a man, and whenever he thought of that man being Mycroft…
"This isn't your fault." Sherlock's eyes lowered to the mess he'd created, and John knew it wasn't an easy thing for his omega to admit.
“Then you should be paying more attention. She’s been at the centre of two political scandals in the last year and recently ended the marriage of a prominent novelist, by having an affair with both participants separately.”
“Lestrade is not my friend. He’s a collaborator at best.” Sherlock scoffed.
"Better?"
"Oh John!" Sherlock shouted with joy, lifting up the omega and began swinging him around in an embrace full of care and love.
"Something sweet. Apple pie."
“Everything I said, it's not real. I was just playing the game.”
Sherlock knew he needed time to gather his thoughts. To think over everything he'd discovered, yet this one time Sherlock wasn't behaving rationally. Instead of sitting in his chair and slipping into his mind palace for further contemplation, Sherlock kicked over the red chair - reserved for John.
"You're ready." John knew -- though he'd never scented an in-heat omega before -- his instincts told him Sherlock was at full peak. The omega's body was ready to accept him.
Sherlock couldn’t let Moriarty go, not with the silent threat lingering; for John, Sherlock was prepared to kill.
Gregory stared at it for a moment, contemplating briefly if he could do this, before taking hold of the woman’s hand.
"No!" Sherlock whined and slammed the refrigerator door shut.
“What?”
John sat in the middle of his bed, back pressed against the wall, knees drawn up close to his chest. Resting his head onto his knees and hugging his legs, he stared blankly at the wall. His tired eyes stung each time he blinked them—three days without sleep and continuously crying would do that to a person.
“He can’t go to your school as you know, but I will see what can be done. Do you trust me?”
Sherlock’s alpha instincts to find and protect his omega abated after Mycroft sent a copy of John’s hospital records for him to see the proof that John was indeed fine. The agents left the estate and Sherlock was allowed to accompany Mycroft in a car and drive out in front of his intended’s family home. There, they sat in silence as Sherlock watched on edge as a much older, and worn out looking John Watson limped out of his home, supporting himself with a cane and entering his sister’s waiting car.
A crash had John’s head snapping up in surprise, finding Sherlock had thrown the coffee table across the room, breaking it, and the alpha was now glaring at John in a way that sent the beta’s heart pounding.
The base of his cock swelled, a knot forming, growing every second Sherlock neared total bliss.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
"I did -- I
“No.” Sherlock broken in.
“How did you know my size?” John asked of Mrs. Hudson.
you!" Sherlock swore.
" Sherlock mewled, the roughness of John's thumb stroking the outer layer of his entrance, much in the same way he'd done before.
“Your parents dropped off your suitcases earlier this morning and movers will be bringing the rest of your belongings tomorrow. The door next to the closet leads to the bathroom. Feel free to look around the house from upstairs. I highly doubt you want to be spotted downstairs. I’ll be going to my home office to work on a case. If you need me, it’s the last door of this wing, to the right. This is our room and although we hardly know each other, I hope that you can open yourself up to the idea of us being friends at the very least.” Sherlock sighed softly, carding a hand through curled tresses and flashing a faint smile at the dumbfounded omega.
Sherlock's arm firmly brought John as close to his side as possible. His smile softened as if the mere sight of John made his heart melt and his insides turn to fluff.
"Sherlock?"
John would never cheat on him. Of course he knew this. He wasn't an idiot. Biology proved that alpha submissives were monogamous to the extreme. That didn't mean feelings for another omega couldn't arise.
“I could take care of Sherlock for you.”
" Sherlock dropped a hefty science book on the ground and palmed his mouth, muffling the hysterical laughter bubbling out of him.
An idea clicked and Sherlock grinned wildly.
“Leave me alone!”
Sherlock graced John with a faint smile, his own face feeling warm and matching the shade of John's.
John didn't need Mycroft to explain what it was he was referring to.
John pursed his lips. Sherlock never behaved that way when they were together.
"Do what?" Sherlock feigned confusion.
… Yes, I believe I’m—I’m—I’m—
"I'm sure when he calms down--"
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sherlock and John watched as Mycroft greeted the other man, now known as Harry.
Sherlock moved to seat himself across from John and observed the alpha eat his meal. Sherlock felt that same unsettling pull in his chest when he realized John refused to meet his gaze. He didn’t like it. Was John angry with him?
"John that tickles." Sherlock giggled merrily as John kissed his exposed ear.
A knock at the door had John standing to his feet as the door swung open and Mycroft was there to greet him.
Sherlock dropped his scalpel to the table when he glanced once more at the clock and read 11:55PM. He prided himself in deductions and he’d deduced John’s clothing before he’d left—he’d been dressed to go out, and he went out with Lestrade. Each time John went out with Lestrade, no matter where they went, John always,
Mrs. Hudson couldn’t ignore his cries and entered the room, finding John balled up in the sheets, fisting at his hair and screaming
“No, I think you're damaged, delusional, and believe in a higher power. In your case, it's yourself.”
"I'm sorry." John apologized, causing Mary to raise her head and sent him a weak smile of acceptance. "I know this isn't easy for you."
"I did. I'm not proud of it, but I... I was hurt and angry." John explained, although he knew it no way mitigated his actions. "I regret hurting you. It was wrong of me."
One of Sherlock's hands moved to stroke at John's muscular thigh, his other went to take a hold of the alpha's soft cock that periodically twitched with interest. There Sherlock took great care in caressing John, working at his cock, praying he would harden quick enough so that he wouldn't have to bother with this process for much longer than it needed to be.
“I swear, I didn’t mean to hurt you.” Sherlock murmured against John’s mouth before claiming his lips in an ardent and gentle kiss.
John smiled and made a noise of agreement.
.” John would whisper, cradling Sherlock’s face in his hands and kissing him tenderly on his lips as they held each other, Sherlock spurting out load after load, knot sealing them together.
“Are you composed enough to talk now?”
“Happy anniversary.” John murmured, before pressing his lips upon the dazed Sherlock’s.
Throughout the night John was led by Mrs. Holmes, much like Sherlock was, to meet members of the Holmes family. All were stuck up prigs that John knew he would only have the misfortune of meeting under Mrs. Holmes’ direction.
John swallowed audibly, wanting to know, and yet, unsure how much more he could take. Regardless, he would take it. God, he would take this surprise. He wanted it.
"I might have eaten some apple pie." Sherlock confessed, feeling guilty whenever his sweet cravings flared.
Sherlock began sobbing, unbidden, tears smearing across his flushed face as the pungent scent cloyed the room. John bit his bottom lip and whined when he remembered what that scent was.
“Don’t say such things. Please, John. Please. Lay back down. Please.” Sherlock urged remorsefully.
“I’ll be at the flat.” Sherlock spoke slowly, eyes moving erratically scanning John’s face for something.
Sherlock shut his eyes, hiding the lingering pain of being wounded by this lie and focused on the fact that John loved him and that it was his love for him and their pups that would prove his fidelity.
John rose to his feet and walked slowly with an arm around Mrs. Hudson’s shoulder, allowing the woman to guide him passed the kitchen, long hallway, and to a spacious bedroom. John quickly noted this room was pristine, neat, everything in its rightful place, and so unlike the mess of the living area.
"Shhh." John soothed, running his hands through the omega's wet curls, untangling them with his fingers.
“John.” Sherlock keened audibly, hands raised, taking hold of John’s own and sat up, taking the omega’s momentary pause to speak.
“I missed you.” John rasped, vision blurring the longer he thought about how he’d been wrong to pull away.
“Dr. Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan. Old friend.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~
John said nothing, shutting his eyes he rubbed them with his fingers, ridding them of the dampness and took in several deep breaths.
Sherlock leaned back to meet John’s wet stare, a finger pressing along John’s temple, catching a single tear that escaped.
“May I just apologize for the state of my little brother?” Mycroft courteously said to the older man.
” Sherlock persisted.
With slow, unsteady steps did John take, and broke the distance between them. Sherlock watched with apt attention, partly stunned that the alpha had given in. A part of him had thought John would refuse. That the alpha cared too little to appease Sherlock of his hurts, but it would seem John could be made to debase himself when the possibility of Sherlock's suicide was put into play.
Mary eyes gave way to warmth, "I do, but I realize I will never have you. I want you to be happy. I need you to see that you are flawed, and hold grudges like no other, because you've been hurt in the past I know. But Sherlock is not one of those betas that harassed you. He has never been your bully and doesn't deserve to be treated like he is, because you hate yourself for being an omega."
“It’s okay to be angry. Let it out.” Ella encouraged sensing the animosity boiling in the man before her.
The alpha stared up at him in horror and shook his head, glancing over to Mycroft at the corner of the room, the gentleman silently watching with a solemn frown.
Mary Morstan was a kind woman, but John didn't want her. John could never want anyone but his Sherlock. When they'd met through work, John could scent her interest. Mary wanted to comfort him and help with his pain, to form a partial bond, but John firmly rejected Mary's advances.
“You have a sister?”
He knew he had two choices. He could stay. He already forgave Sherlock, but John wasn't ready to move back in with Sherlock, or reconcile their marriage... That, John wasn't sure he had it in him to do. After they'd finished explaining themselves to the authorities and Mycroft had come to speak with Sherlock, John made to leave the busy consultant.
"You promised me." Sherlock rasped, enraged by the look of defiance in his mate's gaze. The alpha within revolting against the commands. To the idea of what Sherlock wanted to do. Knowing this was not for them, but for the others who would view this. John's shame. It would degrade him so deeply if the world were to see him - an alpha of high status, a former army man, a honorary Captain - submit to an omega.
"I said shut up!" Sherlock screeched incensed, daring John to contradict his command, and watched as the alpha pursed his lips with frustration. John's eyes clearly spoke volumes, pleading, needing, but Sherlock didn't validate him.
John had just finished seeing his first patient at the clinic when his cell buzzed in his pocket. Quickly retrieving it, John glanced at the caller ID and found Lestrade’s name and a notification of a new text from the DI.
His money he earned through his work was a decent amount. Not enough for him to permanently run away. But he didn't want to run away forever, he just needed... He needed to be away from Sherlock. He didn't want to see him. To look into those cold, unfeeling eyes right now would break John's heart beyond repair. He already had to subject himself to a lifetime of being cruely rejected and ignored by his omega. Never to have Sherlock's heart, nor could he ever give himself to his omega.
"Sherlock, isn't it?"
“Sherlock, our children will grow rather quickly, I don’t think we will need so much.” John started to reason with the enthused alpha.
“Call me if John’s health changes.” Mycroft snarled, unable to contain his malice with those images filling his mind.
” John whimpered.
“No, Sherlock. Emotionally and physically I belong to you.” John soothed, palming the back of Sherlock’s neck and bringing him down to press their foreheads together once more and dotingly stroked at Sherlock’s scalp and neck.
” Sherlock excitedly chanted, body going taunt, stilling mid-thrust and suddenly John felt filled with warm release.
John wanted to roam the city without the watchful gaze of a bodyguard and Sherlock quickly consented. True, the bodyguard had been assigned to protect John before the bond was complete, but now that it was, there really was no need for it. They were completely tied, bound.
“SHERLOCK!” the familiar call of Lestrade’s voice rang out from a distance.
"Mycroft." Gregory began, taking insistent steps towards the government official seated at his desk.
"I meant what I said. I didn't want my heat, but I wanted what happened. You are right John, we couldn't have fought it, and you... treated me well. As far as... We will talk about it later. Right now, I need to see Mycroft and smother him to death with the cakes he's so fond of."
