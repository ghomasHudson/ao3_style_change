If John didn't stop this now, they be doing this right here in the kitchen with Mike Stamford and his obnoxious girlfriend just a room away.
---that Watson's shaggin' someone else, now." he whispers.
she said, squeezing again.
"I can't help but worry that Jim Moriarty may be planning some....
John was silent. He didn't know what he expected. A fleet? A car and driver? A helicopter? He was just happy to see Mycroft.  He didn't know how far this would get him, but it was something.
I am sure this will kill me.
As it happened, the boys had never been quite as alone as this. Sherlock had a nice big bedroom with a nice big bed.
"Like it has in the past,
She went pale and looked surprised. She took a step backwards.
Jim looked now, too.
"Get on with it, Mycroft, what do you really want?" Sherlock sat sideways in a sitting room chair, his back against he one arm and his legs draped over the other, gracefully eating with chopsticks.
her voice was soft, her wine glass empty.
“Shall I check your pockets, Sherlock?” Lestrade asked with a smile, crossing his arms in front of his chest.
Jack leans in, voice lowering,
John looked at the kid standing before him and sighed. He rubbed his face with his right hand and then rubbed at the back of his neck, trying to determine how to wake himself up. His migraine felt a bit better- the paracetamol did help. This was already way too weird.
"See you at the party, John." Again, James gives John a conspiratory wink, turns on his heel and walks away.
He handed me an unopened bottle. Good thing, I won't drink anything open.
But I went with John and....I have to laugh at myself.
John could not think of any remotely believable story to tell his parents.
Then came the phone call.
I was allowed to see him the day before discharge. He was going to a rehab right here in London and I was hoping to visit, but still wasn't sure I'd be welcome.
you can get in." I threw my hands in the air.  "I guess this is just how it's going to go then, right?"
“Yes.”
Sherlock wasn’t sure where this was going…the ramblings of a madman, no doubt. But it made him smile into the darkness.
John realized as he rushed out of Mary's he didn't know where he was going. He felt another ping in his pocket. He reached for his phone and read a text:
and the rest of what he said was inaudible due to laughter.
His trouser leg was gathered up around his thigh as he sat on my bed. I couldn't help noticing the long hard muscles of his legs, as I applied the cream to his wound. I noticed how defined they were as I wrapped gauze around his ankle. His leg was bent at the knee, foot resting on the bed.
He wasn't finding what he was looking for. Almost giving up, he slowed down and started to pace, hoping he could think more clearly. He knew he didn't have much time. Spotting a sign that read, 'Visitor Parking' he started to walk towards it and finally spotted what he was looking for.
"I'm surprised that you risked the very little freedom you had." Lestrade leaned forward in his chair.
bored, I was just looking for distraction both from the constant stream of people at my door and
He look at me surprised and silent. His voice was small and shaky, "That's what I'm trying to find out."
John held the door open with his left hand.  The flat was quiet.
"Be right back," he said.
"Lot of bloody help you were the night of the club riot." I snapped. Why was I angry? Angry at my situation. Not angry at him. OK, maybe, angry at him. A little.
John wasn’t sure if he could believe the boy sitting across the kitchen table from him, who in the early morning light of the kitchen looked so young. John's head was swimming with questions. "Well, it was my flat."  John mused.  “Sherlock, just how old are you?”
He stood there, the light of the fridge the only light on in the dark kitchen.  At times likes these, it stung how little John really knew about Sherlock. It was John that Sherlock spoke to the most and yet he was surprised by him every single day.
he said, looking down at his shoes. He picked up my bag and tossed it over his shoulder.
“This is my friend, John Watson.”
John sits up, seeing a flickering movement at the foot of the bed.  He can’t believe his eyes. This night can’t get any worse. Terrified at the apparition, his voice is hoarse as he tentatively asks,
Sherlock looked own his nose at Jim Moriarty. Jim was obviously having too much fun at his expense. Sherlock failed to see the joke.
“It’s OK John, no really--I just wanted to make sure he's.... happy.”
John was afraid that summer break maybe a sore subject to bring up to Sherlock, but in truth, it must be said.  John’s mum wanted him to get a job at Tesco’s this summer. That would put the idea of him spending the summer in London (like Sherlock had wanted) right out. After discussing Jim, John may just as well bring up summer plans. This way, he'd get it over with on one horrible batch. So, plans for a horrible summer would be all set.  John would be stuck in Chelmsford and unable to drive, he wondered if he would see Sherlock at all.
As suddenly as it started, the wind stops and all is quiet. He takes his arms down and is surprised at the blinding sun. Moving his shoes against the ground, he can feel the crunch of sand underneath his feet. He knows this place. He is back in Kandahar.
John  pulls away to speak, “Sherlock, um… Mike reminded me before he left--that there is a welcome back football party--yeah, I forgot. And I should go and of course you’re welcome to come too.” John hesitatingly said.
An exhausted Dr. John H Watson sloggs through  the wet streets of London. The sun has already set, making it much darker than it should be.  A few days before Christmas and a long shift at the A & E, John was just glad to be walking away from chaos for a few days. He left his briefcase in the office, not planing at all to catch up on any extra reading. The impending holiday had made his night at the A & E a busy one, with a case of child abuse and sick newborn, amongst the broken bones, sniffles and fevers.
Before John could speak, they all turned at a voice behind Stamford.
"Communication incoming from the metropolitan police." Reports the newest employee, on duty as the first line response.
And that's how I ended up as Sherlock's police-sanctioned, court-ordered babysitter.
"Can I buy you a drink?" asked Sherlock, as he handed John a beer.
I drained my bottle of beer. My cheeks felt pink and I was afraid I do something that would further complicate my life, so I stood up to leave. So did the rest of the group.  My panic passed and I regained my composure.
The combination of wine and the hash was a pretty good one. I know exactly how I'm going to spend my weekend. I'd rather not spend the time in this room like a caged tiger, clawing the walls.
But his phone was buzzing annoyingly in his pocket.
As bad as this was for John, it was actually much more of a disaster for me. As soon as the police showed up, my game was over.
I stood there in silence.
"Wait, let me look at you.
Didn't take long for Mycroft to phone me back with information. It never does.
I wanted to believe Sherlock,  I really did. But why did I feel such desperate, burning anger? I got up from the bed and threw my track pants on. I know my face was red, my throat constricted. I wasn't able to look at him and I wasn't in the mood for jokes. Jim Moriarty--who he met in the loo
"Alright, Shez?" the voice belonged to a hulking young man, covered in tattoos. He put his fingers together and cracked his knuckles menacingly. Stamford put a little distance between the young man and himself by moving closer to John.
"What? The department rules?""
John walked over the the kitchen and look at the table--covered in beakers, glassware, microscope. The bunsen burner was off. John peered at it, reading 'University of London' stamped on the side.
Sherlock kept his voyeurism brief. Although John may not think to look up at the windows, Mycroft would. When Mycroft did look up at the flat windows, Sherlock was not there.
Sherlock was right about the headache. John took the pills and sat down, laying his head against the cool surface of the table.
"...gay." John turns towards him and adds quietly, a whisper. John's jovial mood sours, his face serious.
“The bed is bigger in mine.” Sherlock answered.
"What in the name of God are you doing here? Where do you live?" John asked, mind spinning,  wondering now if his migraine caused a hallucination. Maybe he was having a stroke.
John would agree to anything right now.
The elderly proprietor placed another cup of hot tea in front of John.
"Maybe, but no."
Jim and Mary looked each other conspiratorially and laughed. "Well, one of the batches of cider has been spiked, I hear. Do you know which one you've had?"
There were no speakers that John could see or identify, hidden-he thought-somewhere in the walls or ceiling.
I've been going out a bit with Mary. I wouldn't call it
John reached up to bury his left hand in the soft dark curls behind Sherlock's head, straining a bit to get to his full height to deepen their kiss.
John looked forlornly up at the ruined building, shock blanket still covering his shoulders, the flashing lights reflecting off his face. The boys started to walk away from the scene, but they as yet, had no destination.
"The dead man's wrist were tied--but they were love cuffs."
John waited for Mycroft to continue as he held on tight to the doorknob.
“That’s an excellent idea.” said John.
He squeezed my bicep a little too hard. I looked down at his hand on my arm. "Please," he said. "Just one moment, hear me out,
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
"Sherlock?"
Bloody hell.
I had lost track of time. It was nearly dinner.
She looked up at me questioningly.
Sherlock snaps.
"No, Mary, I don't think that's it." I protested. "I just don't think he's interested in
Black, swollen eye and all.
“Right, what are you, then?” John took Sherlock’s hand and led him to the sofa where the boys both sat down.
"You don't seem too concerned."
“Oh, John! Mrs Watson fell onto John’s shoulder crying. When she caught her breath, he guided her to a chair to sit.
Laughing, Sherlock launched himself out of bed to go see what John was up to.
```````````````````
Christmas Hols, 1984
Mycroft promised to let me know if more information surfaced.
Sorry, not within my realm. I shake my head. I don't know what that is.
I made my way to the park. It was snowing harder. The benches were covered with snow. I lay down on a bench and look up at the falling snowflakes. The street lamps were as bright as the sun. Had to close my eyes. Started to dream of John. I could see him in my dream. He was talking to me and he wasn't at all angry this time. I kept repeating, "How did you get here? How did you get into my dream, John?"
Maybe he just should have never gone to the flat party with Mike last year, then he would not have met John. Damn Stamford and his ‘friends’. What’s the point? People always disappoint you, anyway. John was involved when he met him, why should he think John would walk away from his life just to be with Sherlock?
Mary was quiet.
He could just go back to whatever--else--he was doing before he was saddled with me.
"Sherlock,"  I whispered. There was a fine dusting of silver snow in his dark hair. He was breathing, his skin was whiter than usual, cold, pale, ethereal. His nose had been bleeding, I could see some dried blood there.  Terrified, I knew he'd die if I didn't get him someplace warm. "Sherlock, please."
John whispers. As the kiss deepens, John reaches over to flip Sherlock on his back.
John was plastered, all the footballers were. The pub was still really crowded, few uni students sitting outside on the kerb, getting sick. Molly and her friends picked their way carefully through the pub, trying to find a place to sit when she spied john.
Mycroft was quiet, looking at John with worry. John was pale
"And Scotland yard--can't." John wanted to make it clear that he understood.
"Yeah, at the pub...I guess he just broke up with...with..."
Struggling with his books, bag, crutches and the chair that may just topple over. Yet he was confronting me--
"Police?" John asks.
"The crime scene has been altered, staged to look like a suicide."
"I know when someone is unconscious, Sherlock. It's my... "
“It's allright.” Sherlock continued, “There's an extra bedroom upstairs with a bed already there.”
I opened my eyes, grey winter light illuminating the windows of my room.  I had a mild headache, left over from drinking. I hadn't drank that much, I thought. I sat up and listened for sounds in the flat--trying to put the night before back together. I can't say what I thought would happen-
"Sherlock! I can't be friendly?" he asked, taking an awkward sip from a glass of white wine.
He'd imagined that the elderly lady at the counter owned the place. She brought the hot cup of tea over to his table and smiled kindly. John placed his bookbag under the table near his feet.
A beloved uni professor found dead in his office on the eve of the start of the holiday. No witnesses, office door locked. His secretary had left the office early. Looked like an obvious suicide. Found by the cleaner, who then called 999.
Mary pouted.
"Are you sure, Mary?" I took a step closer to Jim. I wasn't afraid of him. A few drinks in, I wasn't afraid of anyone.
Sherlock unfolded his legs one at a time, placing them over John’s.  John’s legs were flat on the floor and Sherlock’s legs, being longer, were over John’s, but bent at the knees.
John sat up a  bit in his chair. "The Best. The bravest, kindest, wisest person I have ever had the good fortune to know."
Luckily, they have some leftover Thai that they reheated. No sense to leave food in the fridge when they will be away visiting Sherlock's family for the better part of a week. John was quiet all through dinner, his mind elsewhere. It was difficult to keep up with Sherlock's detailed explanation of his latest experiment-- the one that went wrong in the flat just moments ago.
I sighed and walked over to the sofa, my water forgotten. John stood up, "Sherlock," he whispered.
that's how I knew your name, of course." Sherlock said, sipping his tea, trying to sound adult and composed. Sherlock always seemed to find himself in situations where he did not belong.   Out of his league, out of his depth and way over his head. Like now, giving explanations to the older, angry, accusatory brother of a fellow addict.
"Sure," I said, confused. Having no idea what was going on, I followed him out the door, leaving three quarters of my pint on the table.
John rallied, and went at him again. He avoided John yet again.
John realizes now that Mary is in some kind of residential treatment facility, where she is being monitored and medicated. More of a half way house rather than a proper jail, he realizes.
I took a few swigs of the drink. It was fruity and didn't taste at all like alcohol, but I knew better.
"What?" he asks, sharp, birds eyes boring into me. "You didn't do it, did you?"
John, you need sleep. So much has happened in the last 24 hours--don't you think you should try to rest--in order to face tomorrow?" Mycroft's eyes were deadly serious.
Sherlock shrugged, "You took Mike's pulse after he collapsed, no body just does that."
I stood up suddenly, with my casted leg still on the chair. I almost fell over, 'Oi,"  I said, not wanting to yell in the library.
I was going to have to tell John everything. He didn't know all the details of Victor and me, nor the drugs. John knew some of that story but we had never had any full disclosure. I never had the chance to just tell him everything. I was afraid I'd make me look bad--no--worse in his eyes. And where was it going to get me?
he asked me with a sneer.
I felt a hot red flush creeping up my cheeks. I wasn't at all interested in why Molly was afraid of Mary. I was interested in who fancied me.  "How do you know they fancy me?"
The fridge door swung shut.
John guided Sherlock to the loo, Sherlock occasionally leaning on the wall. He sat on the edge of the bath and leaned his head on the sink, moaning again. John filled the sink with hot soapy water and Sherlock used the flannel to wash himself the best he could. After washing, Sherlock's chest was wet and glistening with the drying soapy water. Two stray drops of water formed into rivulets and John watched them race down Sherlock's hard muscled back.  John cleared his throat. "How about a new vest, or......something?" John suggested. "I could get it for you."
Picking up the shirt, he walked back to sit near John again on the edge of the bed.
Glad she had hold of me because the last one out of the door leaving with Sherlock was Jim Moriarty.
After searching each room, Sherlock found him the kitchen of the flat, talking and laughing with a group of people and he was totally arsed. Unsteady on his feet and boisterous, he greeted Sherlock loudly, like his long lost brother.  “And there he is! Sherlock, Mate!”
“I’m not sure who it is. A professor from uni? Says his name is Holmes.”
Harry did not look good. Flat on her back in hospital bed looking pale and haggard.  Three IV poles at least, he counted, being mauouvered by two nurses, who both paused and looked up when he stood in the doorway. He turned to see someone behind him. It was the doctor, looking grave.
Sherlock stares at the ceiling and explains fully what happened the night before, including how much he misjudged the situation and how Irene came to his aid.
He looked at Mycroft helplessly and sighed,"I guess you're right--I just need something to do."
Outside on the kerb, Mycroft parted from John and wished him good luck. John climbed into the back of the long dark car and the driver pulled away into the road. John did not give any thought that the driver knew exactly where he was going. Just another inexplicable fact of life with the Holmeses that John had uneasily accepted.  He wastes no brain power asking 'why' or 'how' right now.
The room was quiet. "Sherlock......" I took a step towards him. "Listen, I didn't mean..."
Snogging on the floor.
John sighed as his shoulders slumped. Too bloody late.
“That settles it, then. Flats don’t blow up every day. It’ll be my treat. let's go." Sherlock offered his hand and helped John up.
We could hear the sirens coming down the street in 10 minutes. They placed Sherlock on the stretcher and took him. I wasn't sure where exactly they were going but I wasn't allowed to go with him.
Transfixed, John stared into the distance. Mycroft immediately turned to see what John was staring at.
Sherlock was tired and annoyed.
“Thanks John. I thought the costume was used to good effect.”
I had promised Lestrade I wouldn't make any trouble, so I wasn't handcuffed. He trusts me, sort of.
"John?"
He stared out into the parking lot, watching the snow still falling. The town was quiet, no traffic on the street in front of the hospital. Occasionally, a car would drive by, not stopping. After a while, a small car pulled up in front of the hospital.   It sat there, wiper blades wiping the snow off the windshield in repetition.
"John," he was frowning.
A group of people sit at the breakfast table chatting, eating and having tea. He sees Mary, the real Mary this time, her hair no longer blonde, but light brown- her true color, he knows. She is not smiling, just sitting there quiet, drinking tea.
I had a steady girlfriend in VI Form, but I just got to uni, I want to keep my options open.
“Please, Sherlock, please go to bed--- “ John pleaded, voice weak,
The Head of the Department wanted to be kind. "I think it quite understandable to have a student look at the professor. In fact, we insist up on it."
"A kid at university?" John found this very difficult to believe.
John sat while Sherlock and Lestrade stood, facing each other and had a heated discussion of why Sherlock had kept the piece of shrapnel for an extra 12 hours. Lestrade backed off and quieted down when Sherlock gave compelling information of how a subtle bend in the metal indicated it was from a common kitchen appliance turned into a makeshift incendiary device strong enough to take a building down. Lestrade took the item from Sherlock and sent it along to the bomb squad.
"Right, brilliant," said John, breathless and smiling. He held the jersey in his hands. It was soft and the colors were so vivid. John smiled as he turned it over and saw WATSON on the back.
towards the back of the pub, with a large group of blokes.
“Of course, sir.” The driver walked away, silently getting into the car and pulling away.
"What do you want, Moriarty-- you make a bee line for me every time you see me out. What is it for?" Sherlock asked brusquely.
"Thank you, Mycroft." John said.
"Hey," John said, reaching out to tousle Sherlock’s unruly hair, “I’m about to go back to my flat, I never did unpack.” He said chuckling.
I walked up to them and looked over the railing. The entire place was a sea of foam, laser lights and writhing bodies.
“Broomfield. I have a car outside.” Mycroft turns and walks towards the door.
“Whoo hoo!”  Mrs. Hudson the landlady, poked her head 'round the door.
"No." I closed the file, and stood. It was time to go, I wasn't going to get anywhere today. I reached for my coat.
Because he didn't get a call from Harry, he got a call from Sherlock Holmes.
"No." says the supervisor slowly, scratching his head. He decides quickly that this one won't be recorded. He puts the clipboard down on the desk./p>
John turns toward him, “Hi.” John gestures to the phone on the wall. “….Mary—No answer. At her flat. I’ve called twice.”
John cleared his throat, “Sherlock you may not feel like you have any responsibility to your flatmates and I guess you have a point, but you are only 16 and I…”
heard 'round the world and everyone opened their doors, horrified at what they saw. Me, holding Sherlock, alternatively struggling to get him upright and guiding him to walk straight.
"No, you didn't." She had that amused expression on her face that she often has when she looks at me. Like I am her little brother and she is minding me while our parents are out.   "Goodnight, John."
Jim was at Sherlock's elbow in an instant and pulled out a wad of cash and insisted on paying for both of their drinks. Sherlock sighed and let him.
John sat next to me in an obviously uncomfortable new suit and tie and shot me concerned looks every so often. I couldn't look at him. I stared at my shoes, face red. He is much too nice to me.  He can't help it.
“Oh, that was Raz and Wiggins.”
Molly was quiet at the restaurant. I know she fancies him.
“…and I guess they’re just gone now?” John threw up his hands relieved, but still riled.
"Late night?" I could see the hint of a smile on his lips. He handed me a file of old cases he'd been promising me for an age.
John and Sherlock surprisingly had no confrontations with Jim Moriarty. It didn't matter that Sherlock was expecting it, round every corner, but it never came. As a matter of fact, they hadn’t seen him around the campus at all. With no words and no sightings, John was sure Jim had left uni.
“John, what’s wrong with you? You’re acting weird, well weird for you anyway…” Harry rolled her eyes and laughed.
"Um...read people. Like you do. Tell things." he was waiting for an answer.
“I’m sure you have a headache. There's  paracetamol here on the table. And the kettles’ on.” Sherlock said.
John and Sherlock stare at each other, knowing this is true. The flat is quiet.
As they both passed through the doorway into the raucous party, Sherlock tuned back to John with a smirk,
Sherlock stopped abruptly, interrupted by a thought. He glanced at John. "Since you're so keen--want to come with me?”
Claude Levi-Strauss, French Anthropologist
"The name of your residence hall, John." Sherlock had the GPS up on his phone and was going to give the address to the taxi driver.
Sherlock took the offered pills and hot tea and was very thankful.
"Well he sits in the front row..." The Professors voice was shaking.
what your asking, isn't it?
He looked down the stairwell, a good 8 flights below and heard the door to the outside world slam shut.
The door's locked and I'm alone.
"Listen, Sherlock, we don't have to do this if you...you." I shook my head and shrugged.
But there he was, sitting at a table with his casted foot up on a chair, a sea of books all around him. You could still see fading bruises on his face and neck. The papers did say the that there was only one serious injury requiring hospitalization. Was that him? The hospitalization? Or someone else?
He looks at me  and laughs, "Just like an orgasm, right?" and slides the mirror to me.
He turned his head to look at me, his eyes were clouded and confused, pupils wide.
And performance anxiety? Well, I have the Prosecco to thank for pushing that well into the back of my mind.
Is he breathing?"
Once at the station, Lestrade made us tea.  He cleared his throat. "Sherlock, I'm surprised."
I went from pub to pub. After long, I recognized the blokes Sherlock was with. Keeping my composure, I asked one of them if they had seen Sherlock or Jim, but they said they had long gone and didn't know where.
As if reading his thoughts, his small companion states, "But you can't change the past, John."
With something much worse than I can imagine.
I'm sure I had the stupidest, lopsided smile on my face, but I was terrified.
Almost there. I heard  some snickering behind me, but it could be worse.
"I'm starting to get a complex, John." she laughed. "What is it this time? Your sister, I'm sure."
No answer, but John thought he may have heard some footsteps.  The door opened and Sherlock stood there looking much improved from that morning. He had taken a shower and changed into clean clothes, covered by a dressing gown.
John stood there shakily and squinted to look at his wristwatch. "Techni--technically, it's tomorrow. It's 1 am." he slurred his words slightly, but his eyes twinkled and he looked pretty proud of his snappy comeback.
There was an uncomfortable silence in the room just then, but I wasn't sure if I said something to accidently offend him. So, I tried to offer an observation of my own.
“And you're telling me this because you know how I love football….” Sherlock's  arms remained stubbornly crossed in front of him
Sherlock walked past John enroute to answer the phone, "What?"
"John--- is Sherlock, are you...and he...?"
And right then, at that moment a very surprised Sherlock Holmes was the happiest he’d been in all his life.
"And you do?" Quipped John, smiling and raising his eyebrows.
I don't think I had ever been so angry in my life. I'm glad Sherlock stopped me. Took a while, though.
I wanted to say something to make her feel better, but I didn't know what to say.
I looked into his eyes, they were a dark grey.
John considered his options.
"Nice address John, who do you know?" Sherlock's voice was a low whisper in his ear as the door swing open and they were ushered in.
We were a mess. John's hands were scraped and bleeding. We both had blood down the front of our clothes. John's lip was split open, the bloke must've landed a punch at some point. The next day I would sport a black eye--John must've punched me, but I hadn't noticed it yet.
John responded, snickering a little.
The back window rolled down with a hushed, mechanical sound.
"What?"
I needed to help John understand why I was concerned. "Why would he just drop the charges against you?"
I gave her back the menu without looking up and got up to order at the bar. When I came back to sit, it was then that I noticed
John watches the scene that occurred just this very evening, as he follows himself up the steps to the flat. 'John' coming home to find the flat a mess, Sherlock in the kitchen, so happy and relieved to see him, just to get scolded. An abrupt dinner and then John off to bed.
"Loo," I whispered. "Don't go anywhere."
Three pints in, I convince him to play darts. He's very good at it.
The baby is chewing on Mrs. Holmes pearls, and she doesn't seem bothered by it in the least. .
Let me... I'll talk to him. Sit, please." he followed me down the hallway.
But John knew better.
So, the question is, who's slipping up? Mycroft or his minions?
I took two steps into the room as the door swing shut. I stopped there, shocked at how frail he looked. "Hi." I said, my cheeks hot.
And walks back to his flat slowly, to unpack in silence.
The meeting at the Yard was extraordinary also. Sherlock was on first name basis with many of the detectives, when he could remember their names.
"Of course. I wish I could have done more."
that he was attracted to , but I am the first male that he found his attraction to
I closed the door and out of absolutely nowhere, started to have a panic attack. My heart started to beat hard and the floor was uneven under my feet. I sat back down on the bed and put my head in my hands. I needed to eat, maybe my blood glucose was low after drinking so much last night.
"Hullo Sherlock," Jim said in his smooth, pouty voice.
"John!!" he stopped what he was doing and walked down to the end of the bed.
Towards the end of the term, John was in the library writing a paper. He had been there for hours, sitting quietly at a table. The library was bustling with students getting ready for exams.  About halfway through his paper, he felt his heart quicken suddenly. He started to feel cold and achy, as though he was coming down with something. Maybe he was getting a fever.
“Hi,” John said, smiling. She was very pretty-just the type of girl who he’d try to date if…
"Molly, this is..." I started, but I didn't know who this was.
have to tell me." he said quietly.
I can sleep as long as I want.
"Sometimes, yeah." John answered with a sigh, glancing at all the chaos of footballers drinking, laughing and singing.
“John!” She shouted running up to him. “Alright? You look like you didn’t sleep at all last night, mums gonna’ worry----you look like shite!” She laughed and slapped him on the shoulder.
"No, not really." Sherlock sighed.
“Sorry”? John had been lost in thought and missed the question.
"Mmm?" I think that was a question.
he says, and tips his head back, holding the right side of this nostril closed with the knuckle of his right hand. "Don't want to lose any of that!" his eyes are watering.
No one knows better than me. We made a great pair, standing in the loo like idiots, he was high and I was pretty close to being drunk off my arse.
John reached over with his left arm and touched Sherlock on the shoulder. Sherlock reached over and wrapped his arms around John’s waist as he lay there, burying his face into John’s side.
Putting his key in the lock and turning the knob,  he was met in the front hallway by a frantic looking older woman. Mrs. Hudson the landlady, looked relived to see him, "Oh John! Just the person! I'm so glad you're home!  But I-- I wanted to warn you..." she whispers hesitantly, looking over her shoulder towards the stairs to the floor above.
Done. Onto my reward.
"I don't know anything about him either,
John jumped to his feet, sweaty, eyes wild.
Sherlock thought about Irene Adler as they crossed another street. Irene--again another one. Pretty straight forward to Sherlock. Mercenary, that's all. Only out for herself. Survivalist. Liar.
John's demeanor had completely changed, gone was the angry young man who just wanted answers and and maybe a brawl. "I... I want to help. Can I? How can I help?" his eyes were pleading, searching as he looked up at Sherlock--a good head taller than him, looking down at him with a mixture of confusion and maybe a little pity.
John wasn't afraid to fight, not at all. He'd been in a fair share of fights at home. In his neighborhood in Chelmsford, he had a reputation as someone who would be keen to fight under the right circumstances. He'd given and received a number of black eyes in his day. When he left for Uni, his secondary school had a few good stories about him.
He thinks I'm getting back into drugs when I'm not. It was unfortunate that he wouldn't listen when I tried to explain that Jim actually
Walking to meet John, my thoughts turned back to Moriarty. Who was he? He wasn't a student and he didn't work at university. Why was he hanging around there?
“Sherlock, there are just things I need to do. Unpack. Say hi to my flat mates--" John voice got soft and quiet, "Which I didn’t because I rushed here to see you." he glanced down at Sherlock's face buried in his side, and reached his left hand to caress Sherlock's broad shoulders. John's hand moved down Sherlock's smooth firm back.
Yeah I do. Around here somewhere."
“Oh sorry-- what was it?” John found it difficult to turn his head away from the front of the pub and towards Mary.
Then Sherlock walking down the hallway to the bedroom, lingering in the doorway, watching John asleep in bed. And then Sherlock getting ready for bed, changing into track pants, brushing his teeth then coming back into the bedroom.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
“John it’s for you.” She nodded in his direction.
John was silent, watching Sherlock scan the wine list again—reading it front to back as if he really knew what he was doing.
“And?” The story was getting long.
The explosion.
When he got back he found Sherlock asleep on the sofa.
"What? " John frowns, eyes wide.
I'm still an adjudicated delinquent."
I was surprised it was so easy, but.....
And of course, it didn't matter how he got here, did it?
Not good.
“This is getting old. I know he had it. He showed it to me. I know he put it in your pocket. I was there, Sherlock, I have eyes.”
“And your perfect bum.” John said a little louder.
"I don't know--he feels remorse?"
He was smiling. "Tell me something, then, about me."
need the money, right? A client--you just can't
John's trip to London with Mycroft was uneventful. The flat was empty, Mike and Sherlock were still out. John showed Mycroft what he found in his sister's coat pocket. Mycroft called Lestrade, asking him to bypass usual channels to get the sample into the right hands.
Why indeed.
I held my head in my hands, temples throbbing.
"Yeah, finally. I feel like I'm back to myself."
At the bottom of the pocket he felt another piece of paper, another receipt. He pulled it out to get a better look.
“Want to play a game?” asked Sherlock.
John looked out into the hallway to see a disheveled  teen sitting in the hallway chairs, long legs stretched out in front of him, crossed at the ankles. He was slumped in his chair, head against the wall, eyes closed, relaxed, with his hands stuffed in the front pocket of his hoodie.
"Oh, don't give me that look," Sherlock said with a sneer, slightly irritated. "I can take care of myself. I actually do it all the time." And he walked past them, down the hall way to his bedroom, dragging his arm along the wall as he went. He slammed his bedroom door.
"I understand plenty. If it was me,
I heard someone shout my name from down the street and turned around. "Sherlock! Walking back to school?" It was Sebastian Moran, out of breath. I'd like to avoid him, but it looks like he's walking back to school too.
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
So, what's the reason?
Sherlock glanced at the window of my room. The moon outside must've been full and bright, the curtains parted just enough to let in a beam of moonlight shining on Sherlock. We had fallen asleep. Not sure what time it was--but middle of the night I guess. I couldn't take my eyes off him.  "I wish you'd tell me what is going on."
Coming down the steps at home, he over heard a conversation in the kitchen.
"Where are you going?"
The worst thing by far was Moriarty showing up that night, too.
The doctor stepped to the side, out of the doorway and gestured back over his shoulder with his thumb. "The lad who brought her here, I....." but the doctor did not get to finish his explanation.
"...I can slip out the back door. I have to be counted as there or..."
"Professor, do you understand why I’ve asked you to come to my office for this discussion?" The Head of Sciences Department sat behind a large wooden desk filled with photos of his family, who had traveled the world. Small children in snow suits and ski boots. Smiling family group from the Great Wall.
In the pitch black of the small kitchen, two hearts are beating furiously. John momentarily forgets where he is as Sherlock's tongue swirls around his. He's sure he's being deprived of oxygen as he giddily pulls Sherlock closer, rubbing both of his hands up and down his long smooth back. John briefly wonders for just one quick moment--how assured and adept Sherlock is at this. As young as he is, he is no doubt John's best lover, of all the girls he snogged and got into bed-- and now Sherlock, he beats everyone, hands down.
"My survival?" John looked up at me from the bed, frowning.
"He spends time with you." Mary insisted.
John clears this throat. "But it is what it is and..."
"Oh. Sherlock?" John asked, absentmindedly.
"Tell them it's an overdose." Mary whispered in my ear, looking worried.
Jon ducked his head under the water, trying to soothe his sore mind. He started to recall more from last night and remembered that sometime in the middle of the night he awoke from a terrible night mare….
John angled himself between my legs. I inadvertently moaned. "We can move to the bed." he suggested.
"Your father's." he looked at the crest on the side.
"I wanted to give you something to think about. Good night , John."
John walked up to the car, just as the driver rolled down the drivers side window. John bent over a bit to look at the driver.
A few more blocks and it will get louder.
"I'll call as soon as I can." John all but ran down the quiet, white, endless hospital hallway to the elevator bank.
There was a knock at his door. It was Mary.
John puts his hand over the phone."Scotland Yard is interviewing my sister." He tells Sherlock.
"When?" John asked him. But he had already gone into the other room.
John pointed at Sherlock, smiling, "and...that's why I like you because... "
"Not hungry." I turned to leave.
Molly, Mike and Mary were in my doorway, mouths gaping.
John, he thought, had a reputation to uphold. And there was Mary, of course, his current girlfriend. Sherlock was pretty certain that tonight’s behavior was a one off for John and would not be repeated. Blame it on alcohol,  blame it on the physical proximity—he would not hold John to anything.
"And this year? You think you're close this year?" Irene asked softly.
Oh, and Mary, who followed John’s eyes to the door.
“Well yeah.” John could not be bothered by Mike’s observations. His heart was hammering in his chest as he searched the crowd. With so many students’ milling about, all in a hurry, all busy unloading cars it would be impossible to find any one person, even if that person was as distinctive looking as Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock and I went to the pub. Not the pub where we were arrested, to avoid running into Jim again.
"Can you tell me a little bit about what is going on?" The Department Head leaned forward.
I make it to the end. Just--
Sherlock laughed, but John was not laughing.
Disapproving of my behavior,
The club was packed. Wall to wall uni students,
John smirks, his eyes twinkling.
“John--“  Mary began, slightly louder.
Down a dark alleyway they went. As they approached their destination, Sherlock realized that this was no ordinary pub. The dull silver front door looked like it was from a maximum security jail with rivets around the edges and a large metal door handle. The front door was closed, but loud pulsating music could be heard from inside. "My Dad's place,"  Jim said.
Jim raised his eyebrows.
John thought he could feel the beginning of a migraine headache starting in his upper shoulder. The very same spot  where he had gotten shot in the Army years ago. A dull nauseating ache, starting in his shoulder and going up his neck into the back of his head. John made straight for the bus, no stopping off at shops tonight. For the last few years, he had started to have severe headaches--nerve damage, he thinks. 2 paracetamol and a stiff drink is his plan. Oh yeah and maybe dinner.
It was a big thing, too. Maybe enormous. Not something that's easy to say. He might take it as an accusation. But I'm not wrong, I'm sure of it.
John could hear caution in Sherlock’s voice.
Once inside, I toss my books onto Victor's bed, still freshly made. After all, he won't be using it, he's not here this year and won't be coming back. Not after what happened.
"God! Sherlock I feel like...
"I'm going to need to file a report." he sat at the desk across from us.
Mycroft cleared his throat, “I’m afraid I am the bearer of some bad news. You sister Harriet is in hospital. An overdose, I’m afraid.”
I still did not look up, riveted as I was to the article. I turned the page. "Hullo."
and if you hang around with me often enough, others will think you are....." Sherlock barely contains the anger in his voice.
What would Harry say? He’d get a good ribbing from her—for sure for being such a sop.
Visibly relieved, John smiled and walked past her to the stairs.
This had gone spectacularly badly. I walked back to school, indeed wearing John's track pants, slightly short on me.
She whispered in my ear after she handed me mine. Her breath tickled my earlobe, her perfume a little too strong.
John put his head in his hands. Oh....Sherlock…
I shed my coat and scarf and lost myself in a large obscure textbook.   I wasn't aware of Molly's approach until she was at my elbow. Out of the corner of my eye I glimpsed her standing next to me, holding her pink coat. I looked up.
Sherlock was drinking beer out of a bottle, by far the quietest one of the group. He glanced over at me and his expression did not change.
His eyes were wide.
did Jim Moriarty give you this?" He wasn't looking at me. He was staring down at the small parcel in his hand.
"Well sir, I feel it is in my best interest to not have that young man in my class." The professor felt he needed to find his voice and be clear about the problem, even if it was one that he had never encountered in his 20+ years of teaching.
see about her. She was one big question mark.
“Right, ‘night, lads.” Mike went to his room and closed the door.
And then he tackled me to the ground with brute force, but I was still swinging wildly.
"I did,
"So, it was a gift?" Johns voice was quiet, sat up and reached for his track pants lying on the floor.
"Don't tell him that, ok? He hears it enough. "
Sherlock was surprised when John turned over and edged his way to Sherlock’s side. John wrapped his right arm over Sherlock’s stomach, and wriggled his way under Sherlock’s right arm, with his head resting on Sherlock’s right shoulder.
Otherwise, it's just annoying.
John shook his head, headache forming behind his eyes. "Why are you involved in this at all? And what makes you think I won't turn you into the police?"
Jack's eyes widen. "You don't say." He takes a long drink from his pint, chuckling.
Sherlock turned to John to answer the question, “A difficult person.”
Mrs. Watson was quiet as she sipped her coffee, thinking.
"I'm drunk, Sherlock."
Out of the corner of his eye, he glimpsed 3 of the council house kids from the quad walking quickly down the street.
And I sat there, staring at Molly, feeling like a fool, with absolutely nothing at all to say.
I should say yes now,
On a particularly cold night, John slipped away from Mary to ring the flat, if Sherlock answered, John could just hang up, but he never did. Mary got a glimpse of John coming in the front door of the pub, eyes watery and nose red from the cold.  "John were you outside? You’re freezing! Whatever were you doing?"
No one has seen you since the night of the riot. Did you talk to the police?" Molly spoke to him like they were friends, but I could see her blushing.
"We went to a club. Things got....bad." Sherlock looks away, staring at the wall.
His cheek's were pink and he was glad that Sherlock did not look up.
John tried to stay busy all the holiday, got a job at the local Tesco, but at any given time, his thoughts turned back to Sherlock. All day, every day.
Sighing, John realized he just wasn’t going to run into anyone else just yet. May as well head over to the house and ditch the suitcase. Maybe he could unpack a bit. He waved goodbye to Mike and grabbed the case.
I'm sure I blush when I look at him. I'm afraid I stand too close to him. I know I hang on his every word. How can I pretend I'm just his friend?
"Sherlock, I'm glad you're here." I handed him another glass of Prosecco and sat down next to him.
"At ease, solider," remarks James Sholto, saluting back and giving the younger man a conspiratory wink. "I wanted to check your progress on the 'Christmas Campaign'.
Half a block more and then he saw him.
I'm truly out for slowing down and not drinking as much. Maybe.
“What?
There second floor of the club had a balcony, where you could actually get away from a foam for a bit. This is where I found Mary with Jim. They were talking in a dark corner, near the railing.
He didn’t feel sorted, he didn’t feel calm and he didn’t feel happy. All he knew was he could not stop thinking about Sherlock Holmes.
“Well… they are. Maybe you…you are different.” Sherlock’s words were measured, quiet, slow.
"Hello John, nice to meet you. I must say that I was so relieved that Sherlock's name didn't make it into the papers this time, that I had to come over with food for you boys."
“It’s important.” John tried to make out Sherlock’s eyes in the dark, he thought he could see a cold glint looking up at him sideways from the pillow.
Three hours later Mike came back.
He needed to get back to London. He needed Sherlock.
John felt anger course wildly though his body for a reason he could not identify.  There was nothing for it. John was here to have fun and meet up with Mary. He wasn't going to spend another minute worrying about Sherlock Holmes, a kid he barely knew. He calmed down a bit when he reminded himself that even Sherlock told him he was not responsible. But, what about the drugs? What if Sherlock was here for drugs? No that's not it, he told John as much when he explained that he wasn't using. Wait--did he say he wasn't using? John couldn't remember. A headache was forming behind his eyes when--
Sherlock's eyes widened and he stepped back to avoid colliding with John.
All I could do was offer a little comfort.
Sherlock walked over to him. "Of course, I guess now we're even, then." he whispered, looking down at john, standing there, looking rather small.
"Oh that. Thanks, Mike." Sherlock breezed past John, avoiding eye contact.
They got out the Cluedo board and created a makeshift table out of a small pile of books, with the game board on top, they started to play.
"Yes."
Turns out, we're both off the hook.
"Pre-season pub crawl!!" they announced.
The owner put a candle on the table, my mind was spinning. I expected that there would be more to this, like we'd be banned from pubs or restaurants or
at a pub
It was at first a very slow, gentle kiss, meant to be reassuringly tender, but didn't take long for John's hands to start to wander. He placed his right hand along Sherlock's cheek, noticing how very soft his newly shaved face was. As their tentative kisses deepened, John could smell Sherlock's aftershave, but could not place the sweet scent.  John worried briefly that he had shaved and bathed  many hours before. After walking for many blocks and getting caught in the rain,  he wondered if Sherlock'd mind.
Before John could ask Mike what he meant, they were at the doors of the university. A long line of cars was queuing up in front of the gate.
John turned red, fearing his reputation for having a good time had done him in.
Oh, John wished he could hear what was being said! John wondered if Jim placed something in Sherlock’s pocket.
"I know why you're here,
We were now eye to eye. He stared at me and sighed. "Are you going to tell me what's going on?"
"What?"  He looked clueless, absolutely clueless--
Bugger.
"Damn!! I haven't unpacked. I haven't called my parents!!" John protested.
I've raised my voice so she can hear me. This has gone far enough. I got up and grabbed my coat.
He dragged me to student health. We made up a story about scraping my leg, to avoid the real story that it was from prolonged contact with an electronic monitoring tag. They put me on pills and cream for a skin infection
John knows that he is meant to participate in this exercise, but it’s getting mighty tedious.
Yeah, sounded like  Mary.
Sherlock.
The bartender walked over to the table, looking concerned. "Can I help you, Mr. Moriarty?"
Sherlock smiles.
“Oi there, lads! Just keep sitting where you are.” Detective Lestrade of Scotland Yard got out of a car and ran up to them.  “You boys need to be checked out by the medical team.”
No answer.
"I was John--this was in the back. In the back--placed in a file, in a separate room, on the back burner. In the back of my mind."
“There you are dear, I thought I heard you come in!” She glanced at Sherlock who was laying on his stomach on the sofa—he did not look up when she opened the door. He could not see the look of concern on her face.
Up on two feet, Sherlock quietly slips on track pants and walks toward the bedroom door. Opening it a crack, he looks out to see John on the phone. He has the receiver up to his ear, head down, in the kitchen.
Then Sherlock got quiet and bit his lip, thinking. He leaned in to whisper to John.
My court case is coming up. Between worrying about the trial and thinking about Sherlock, I'm not sleeping at all.
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
"More?"
And just then a huge explosion erupted from behind the building, glass and debris flying and knocking all three of the boys to the ground.
"Oh, I'm sorry." He said simply and looked at me.
Sherlock stood up and walked over to him. "What?" he asked, looking down at John who had yet to re pocket the phone.
I had to call him. I have to see him.
Ever since I first met you. This is about you, John."
Sherlock sighed and slowly removed the cloth. His shirt was ruined. John whistled at the sight of the laceration on his forehead. At the edge of his right eyebrow was just about a 10cm gaping cut, still oozing blood. "That's gonna leave a scar, mate."
and has a moment of doubt. It seems so long ago. A different world. Sherlock's 17 now and John's not much older than that.
Wednesday night. My last night studying at John's before the hearing. The hearing--scheduled for Friday.
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````                                                             ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
"Bye, Sherlock." the corners of her mouth turned downward as she turned and left.
And there it sat, no bigger than a postage stamp. A tiny origami envelope, likely folded out of a corner of a glossy fashion magazine.
“What? What’s going on?” asked John, making sure his feet were spread apart widely so as not to sway anymore.
"Hi John, I wanted to know if you wanted to go get curry." I can hear her voice, but I can't see her from where I sit.
John approached the hospital door. A heavy anchor of dread weighed down his heart. Once inside, he was guided to intensive care by helpful staff. The floor had a hushed quiet that seemed to insulate it from outside noise.
John hurried through the streets at more than a bit of a run. From uni to the flat was about 10 minutes at a leisurely stroll.  Now though, he felt some urgency to get home. Fast.
"No." Sherlock shakes his head.
Sherlock glances over. "Allright, John?" Sherlock asks gently.
"Party," John answered absentmindedly, staring at his phone until Sherlock snatched it out of his hand and walked away with it. "Hey!" John made a grab for the phone but Sherlock had already looked through John's texts. "I know that address. I'm coming with you."  he shoved John's phone in his own pocket and walked back to the bedroom. John followed.
“Sorry, I shouldn’t have brought it up, but I wanted you to know...” John started, touching Sherlock’s outer thigh with his sock clad big toe.
That's what I call it.
Flat B
He's this young kid, out here on his own, running about London--completely mad,
I pretended not to hear her because I'm a berk. I looked down at the menu, cheeks pink. "Oh I see," I said trying to recover gracelessly. "Not beer--white wine I guess."
The last thing that Sherlock would tolerate was being hemmed in between Irene Adler and Jim Moriarty. He didn't like where this was headed. He wasn't sure where his coat was. He scooped up his drink, muttered 'Excuse me," and slipped out of the booth on Irene's side, who moved out obligingly.
John was very quiet on his end of the phone. He had no justification for his actions. He had no words to explain himself.
The loo was a respite from John's intense scrutiny. It was cooler in there for a moment. When I came out, Mary was sitting with John, hugging his arm--looking up at him and batting her
"Shouldn't what, Mary? " I was frowning, my thoughts dark.
Most of the students just ignored me, not wanting my observations to ruin a perfectly great night of Fresher's Week.
"What's wrong with you?"
Jim said Sebastian spoke about me. Why? I just wasn't making the connection.
Of course, I know why. After Victor, I just wasn't interested in relationships or people, for that matter.
He rolled his eyes, "No one listens to me. They think I'm ridiculous. They'll just tell me to piss off."
"What?"
The party was crowded, these parties always are. The house was big, but it didn’t matter. Wall to wall people--all the footballers, loads of girls. No John, as far as Sherlock could tell, glancing around. He ran into Molly and Janine. Mary must be here, then. He didn’t want to ask, too obvious. He made a pretense of getting a beer. He held one of those American party cups stiffly, as if it was holding a noxious chemical.
John got out with his single suitcase. Mike headed back to the boot to unload his school trunk, large suitcase and a few boxes of books.
Sherlock was humming with agitation, but standing stock still. Waiting.
"Aren't you hungry?" Sherlock was smiling.
I looked at all the booze in my room. More coming at the clubs.
"Yeah, mostly." I sighed. "God Mary, I've never felt better. I mean, this term. I was feeling pretty hopeless."
I'm keeping my eyes and ears open. I look for him everywhere.
"It's mine, I brought it with me. Just in case."  He started to run the cold tap.
No matter, she wasn't talking.
John laughed when he saw me jump, "God Sherlock, are you going to tell me what's wrong? You're not still thinking about Jim Moriarty are you?" He walked over to me.
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
did you nick this?" he turned to Sherlock, smiling wide.
This is the final chapter but I will post an epilogue.
"Ah, there you are, John." Sherlock stood in the hallway enroute to his bedroom, small smile playing on his lips.  "For a brief moment, I was afraid we were on our way to the A&E. Don't want to be frequenters there. "
There was nothing for it, Sherlock was not going to get any look at John's pupils but now he didn't need to. Sherlock went through what little cabinetry there was in the guest WC, more convinced than ever that he'd be unable to get John out of the party in this condition.
John still held on to the fridge door and turned his head left to look at him out of the corner of his eye.
And after that John fell into a fitful sleep until morning.
Sherlock breathed a tiny moan into his ear.
I closed my eyes when I heard his voice. I...um...he agreed...
They all ceremoniously walked me back to school and John signed me back in.  I got quite a few looks when I arrived at school with my small
Previously enrolled at uni few years ago, reading mathematics, never finished. His father is a maths professor at Durham University."
--and trying to guess his motivations
They got up to the second floor to an appalling sight. One large room to the left, was full of people, but none of them appeared to be awake. They were slumped in chairs lounges and on the hard wooden floor.
When I turned, I was surprised to find Molly at my elbow. She had come to help me walk back to the residence hall. She does that sometimes.
“Oh, hello.” Sherlock said to John, over Mike's prone form.
Sherlock pushed the goggles up onto his forehead and spoke slowly. "No. Well, yes, but I was bored...I don't have a case and I had nothing on and I was waiting for you..." the last part of the sentence trailed off and then he was quiet.
My marks in school are hovering right above terrible.
"Right, you’ll have to explain yourself further, please." The Department Head hoped this did not take long, it was almost lunch.
"I could ask the same of you. You said you knew the address!" John said sharply, still angry as he followed behind Sherlock.
"How that?"
that there was more to his odd behavior, but not knowing exactly what. I never believed him when he said John fell from the balcony. I had always believed John. Too bad John didn't believe me.
“Of course, it’s fine.” Sherlock said distractedly, perusing the wine menu.
Aware now that he is lying on his back,  John opens his eyes. Back in his bed, he looks at the ceiling. He is laying in bed with no blanket on, wearing a dressing gown, t shirt and tracks pants. Sherlock is still asleep at John's side; the flat is quiet.
The change was startling and concerning. It coincided with running into Seb on the way home from the pub that night.
In a shocking twist, I'm the most popular bloke at school, it seems. I can't go a moment without someone knocking on my door. My phone rings constantly. Classmates are asking to study with me, go to the library or to get coffee. It's unnerving.
If Mary liked him, she liked him. If family tragedies and scandals scared her off, she was not the person for him.
But Sherlock knew that tonight Mycroft was right, sod him. This is something John needed to do alone. John and his family were having a crisis and there was no room for Sherlock there. Not tonight.
“Listen Sherlock, if you are going back to yours, to shower, I could come over after I unpack, ok?” John finally let go of Sherlock's arm.
"What?" Mary spun 'round to see.
Or, am I just getting better at avoiding them?
Finally, she got the courage to get up off the sofa and walk towards the kitchen. Just then Sherlock got up, having had quite enough of flirting girls in his flat.  Sherlock said, “Pardon me, Molly,” quietly under his breath as he walked past her towards the back of the flat. Molly gave a little weak smile and her shoulders slumped. Sherlock walked briskly back to his bedroom and closed the door.
"I don't know anything about him." John said in a quiet voice. "Mary knows him--sort of."
“It’s nice to hear your voice.” John ventured.
"Irene, you don't understand....."
For one blessed moment John stopped laughing and looked up at Sherlock. He could see that John's pupils were enormous and completely obliterated the color of his iris. Beads of sweat covered his forehead. "God, we've got to get you..." Sherlock stopped when he realized he actually had no idea what to do. He hadn't planned for this.
She looked back at John, who tried unsuccessfully to put on an air of indifference as she gazed accusingly at him.
I said nothing to Lestrade, but wondered if my
John wanted to shake himself for being such a ninny. Why did he feel this way?
They walked up to the second floor and went into the flat. Sherlock made a beeline for the fridge and opened a beer.
Sherlock turned on his heel and walked out the door.
I was happy to help, although I thought it wasn't possible, really. Scratch that. Possible maybe, but not
He seemed nervous, in a rush all of a sudden. "I have to go, really. Maybe I can meet you in the library. How about tomorrow?"
I took a long shower getting ready for...
He would never talk about himself. He was pretty cagey when I asked him what he was reading at uni or which university housing he lived in. He would change the subject, so I stopped asking.
John signed and sat quietly at the table thinking about football practice until he heard Sherlock’s door open. If Sherlock was awake and ok, maybe John could still make it to the pitch.
Sherlock stepped in even closer and reached his hand around John's waist, leaning in. "It's been a very long night." he whispered quietly in John's ear.
Sherlock came back, "It's your shout." I told him.
John was quiet and thoughtful.
I have to ask him what sport he played. Has he mentioned that? What sport he played?
"How would you know? Being friends with me has it's advantages, Sherlock, if you remember correctly." Jim smiled, a mean, crooked smile.
thinking about John.
“Do you two want to go and get a cuppa tea, then?---take a walk and get away from here for a few minutes? --and I’ll stay? Yeah--go an’ take a break. I’ll be here.”
“Oh.” Says Sherlock softly, walking into the kitchen and standing shyly in front of John, his hands in the pockets of his track pants.
First things first. There's an assignment tonight that I hadn't anticipated. Bugger. So I get right down to it. I'm supposed to be on my best behavior. The alternatives for not complying are dismal.
“Yes. Of course, I'm not right all the time, just most of the time. I plan to return it to them today, actually---."
After Mike went into his room and shut the door, John put the rules down. The Cluedo rules proved difficult to read, the print was very tiny, and John could barely make them out.
"Well..." Sherlock began.
It was difficult. John had the same amount of alcohol that I had, but he was much more irrational. The bloke was on his back with John sat on top of him, beating him bloody. I recognized him from the loo. I was shouting, everyone was shouting. John wasn't budging. Maybe this bloke deserved the pounding, but didn't want John to kill him.
She stood up, too. I took my coat off and hung it on the hook, silently.
"Both of us know that isn't true. What abut the marvelous Mr. Watson?"
“Thanks.”
and this flat and..." He stopped.
"Sherlock, maybe tomorrow, you'd explain, the rest, about why...or what you were looking for at the party. I could have helped maybe-- if you'd let me. Well, if I hadn't...or... didn't, well..." John shrugged. He thought Sherlock was looking at him funny. Staring. Quiet.
Sherlock opened the door to Speedy's and walked out onto the street as John looked hopelessly after him.
John anxiously stood at Mycroft's elbow for the length of the phone call with a cold, clawing feeling in his stomach. It was difficult to believe that there could be a possible connection between Jim Moriarty and what happened to his sister.
“You know, John Watson has quite the reputation here,
"Got to get me what?" John asked quietly as he gazed at the wet towel, not quite sure what to do with it.
John took one last look around, not seeing anyone he knew. Groups of students were gathered in clusters of two and threes, chatting. Mostly the courtyard looked the same, John did notice some kids that stood out, lingering on the edges of the quad.  Shabbily dressed, leaning against the side of a University building, they were likely from the council housing nearby. Still, they weren’t causing any trouble.
"Right," John said and stood up rubbing his eyes. "I just wanted to say,
Warning bells go off in my head. Is he propositioning me for sex? I get up to leave.
He barreled toward Jim. When he got there, he tapped Jim on the shoulder and when he turned towards him-- he belted him right in the jaw.
As Mycroft opened the door, in walked Mike and Liz, back from the pub. They both wore surprised expressions when they saw that the flat was not empty.
Everyone looked at me. "What's he mean?" Mary asked.
"Don't you recognize this place?" the young boy asked.
"One would think that his lover would know he was left handed," Sherlock stood up and glanced down at the body.
Sherlock looked down at John, serious, “I’ll leave tomorrow morning early. I was going to leave tonight but something told me not to. I’m glad I stayed, John. Very glad. And I don’t expect anything really, if… if you think this is not a good idea. It’s fine.”
John stood up to collect his books and jumped a mile when he felt someone touch him on the back of the shoulder. He spun around.
Momentarily, John could hear Sherlock's feet run down the stairs. He opened the door a few inches, to peer outside. He stood there in track pants but no shirt, not having time to grab his dressing gown. Surprisingly, Mrs. Hudson came out of her first floor flat and stood behind Sherlock, to see who rang the bell.
Sherlock knew this question would come up. He looked off into the distance. "I'm doing community service. It's not really a dos house, it's a safe house. No drugs at all. And your welcome to turn me into the police, but they already know."  He took a long drink of his tea, draining the cup. He couldn't remember why he thought this was a good idea.
Cool air hit him when he opened the last one. Coal cellar? Fine, he thought. I'll sit here and wait until my brain comes back online, or things get worse. What drug could have been in the cider? LSD? MDMA? John sat at the top of the stairway and wasn't sure if he was sad or angry. His heart thumped annoyingly in his chest, almost hurting. Embarrassed then, that was it. He slumped against the wall. He fished his phone out of his pocket. If he could find the door, he'd call a taxi. It would be a fine predicament if he called his sister for help. But then again, who  would understand more?
I was spending lots of time in the library, studying. I was staring at books for hours and getting nowhere.
A week later, John was still in a foul mood. Harry was improving and safely tucked into a rehab in Finchely.
John was reluctant to press Sherlock for information about his night out. He let the subject drop but kept his eyes and ears open. After all, it was his life, John reckoned. He did well otherwise, and didn’t seem to keep late hours, as a rule. Still, John was uneasy. When the weekends came, he would get nervous--Sherlock would just walk out of the flat, not a word said to anybody. Sherlock never came home as late as the first night, nor in such a state as before, but often his eyes were glazed over, pupils small and he would not talk at all, even when questioned. He went straight to bed.
Sometime around midnight John woke. He was laying on his stomach in just his pants. He wondered what time it was. With his eyes closed, he inhaled deeply, the 800-some thread count Egyptian cotton sheets with their distinctive smell. No, he thought, smell is really the wrong word. Fragrance is better. He knew that fragrance intimately.
"I'm listening now. I wished I listened to you that night. If I had, I wouldn't have to take chemistry over again next term."
The plan is I have to spend three evenings each week with Sherlock, studying. This can be done in my room or the university library. I'm to go over to his school and 'sign him out' monday, wednesday and friday each week. Sign him back in sometime between 9 and 10pm.   This may commute the sentence I receive after my court case in the next 2 weeks.
I came out of the stall to wash my hands and splash my face with cold water. I though maybe I could relax for a moment and clear my head but I wasn't alone in the loo.
John smelled like cold air. He had brought the cold air from the street with him. I finally looked up after he smacked the arms of his chair and jumped to his feet, asking: "Can I get you a drink?" He was still in his coat.
John just stands there, listening. He suspects it to be Lestrade, although Sherlock hasn't said. "We're making the
We spoke on the phone a few times. Mostly, it was me talking and dead silence on his side, interrupted by coughing. At the end of each phone conversation, he thanked me for calling. I wasn't entirely sure that he wanted to talk to me, but Mycroft kept encouraging me to call.
Firstly, my time management skills were a bit lacking.
It gave him time to jump up from the floor, but just. All the beer from a few hours ago did not help one bit.
“Mary!”
Irene suddenly felt brave. "Something or

at your behavior!
John knew exactly what it held.
"Right." He smiled up at me. I can't read his face.
Spiked cider, Jesus Christ, thought John. This is about as fucked up as it gets.
I was speechless. I looked over at John, who was grinning wildly. "Let's go to the pub."
"Jesus Christ, Harry!!"
I had to tell Seb,
John walked away from Irene feeling even more guilty than when he left Sherlock.
The group gave a big laugh, because everyone knew that wasn’t true. John was just as serious a socializer as he was a student.
"They know they can't."
And, I haven't hurt anyone, other than myself. That should be a factor, but it isn't.
My real supplier was Victor, who in turn got everything from his father.
"How do you know that?" John asked slowly.
No answer.
"Sherlock, what's in this envelope?"
John couldn’t shake the worry that Sherlock was somehow involved in something that he shouldn’t. But John had no proof. He chided himself for worrying. He tried to convince himself that Sherlock was an adult, but of course Sherlock wasn’t an adult at all.
John was confused about this entire night, and wondered what Mrs. Hudson's relation to Sherlock was. "Does he live here,--is he your son...or?" John asked.
Last was the coat. John took it out. A long gray woolen coat. The coat Harry wears when she dresses up a bit. He reached in the left pocket-one black leather glove. He reaches in the right pocket the other black leather glove, nothing here…wait.
The phone rang, John shuffled over to answer it, head thumping.
I grabbed his arm. He looked at me, surprised and glanced down at where my hand was around his bicep. I had never touched him before.
"That's not funny, Mary." Mike spoke up as I dialed the phone.
"Dinner?"
John's heart felt like there was no room in his chest for it to beat. He pointed to the door of the house. “I’m locked out. I guess I have to walk to the rental office. I don’t know how…’
He gets off the phone and sits at the table with his head in his hands. "Sherlock, I have something to tell you."
On this side of London, it was very quiet. Mostly residential, with buildings of flats, churches, few shops and our school.
Or get robbed.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Sherlock paused, suddenly quiet, holding his hand up to his temple. "I think I have a bit of a headache." he said and promptly fell forward onto the table, hitting his head with a bang.
"Where's Sherlock been? I haven't seen him." She looked at me with those big round eyes of hers. She knows he hadn't been around. It's been a fuckin' week and a half. She's just being nice. Or nosey.
Sherlock broke them apart. "Wait!" he whispered hoarsely, trying to sit up properly. Sherlock was thin but muscular, John had difficulty taking his eyes off him.
And so, it was Friday. For the first time this entire term, I felt close to being back to normal.
“It’s a disguise John. If I can fool you, I can fool anyone. It was an experiment.” Sherlock didn't sound too confident in his explanation.
"Sherlock, hi." they shook soapy hands.
I pull out a red wristband from my pocket and put it on. I have a gold queue jumper band, too.
“It’s nice to hear your voice, too.” He heard Sherlock say, quiet, soft.
and 3.) because of my prior record for drugs possession of class A, B
John stuck in Chelmsford and unable to drive, working long hours at the local Tesco. John was not too sure just what Sherlock was doing over the summer, he never said. Sherlock was in London-only 20 minutes away by train or car, but it may as well have been the other side of the world.
So, my first assignment with my 'charge' was eating--
“Shhhh, no, it’s fine, John, please.” Sherlock said breathless, reaching up for John again with his hand, caressing John’s cheek and lifting his head to reach John’s mouth with his own. Again. Tender, hungry.
I had to look away from those clear blue eyes.
Too many people about tax my concentration, it's annoying.
He placed his hands around my waist, hooking his fingers through my belt loops, he used these to pull to me close. I laughed--
It was Molly.
“He’s had girlfriends before, Harry. I’ve never seen him like this.” She sighed.
“Are at the hospital, overwhelmed and didn’t want to worry you during test week.” Mycroft answers.
He stood at his full height and took a deep breath.
Back in my room. Sat on the bed, I think about what I can offer him, I have no drinks or food in my room.
He kissed me back, opening his lips slightly, moving his warm hands up and down my back. I forgot what I was going to say. Thoughts and words that I once had in my brain are now gone.
I don't care who John takes a fancy to.
I took that as a go ahead and slipped both of my arms under John's vest and pulled him closer to me. I lifted the vest over his head, slipping it in between us, breaking a bit of momentum.
John did not get an answer as Sherlock put the keys in the lock and opened the door of John's new house.
“Well, you know...my brother….” Sherlock gestured with his arm over the expanse of the living room.
My hand was on the doorknob. I had to get out of there. I needed to think. "You pushed John off a balcony. He could have died."
Sherlock was right about being followed--it just wasn't the person he suspected. It wasn't Jim, it was Mary.   I remember Sherlock standing on my desk, feeling the wall, saying: "I feel like Jim Moriarty is following me--watching me."
Sherlock's hot breath on his neck and near his ear, gave John chills down his spine.
"At the very least," John said brusquely. Unasked, the older lady came to the table, set down a cup of tea in front of Sherlock and scurried away again.
"No." I grabbed them out of his hand and made my way to a back office that he had relegated me to.  I tossed my coat over a chair and sat at an old unused desk and prepared myself for a long afternoon of being unable to think.
She smiled, "I wanted to know if you wanted to come along too, with all of us."
Sherlock was looking at the menu, humming slightly under his breath.
Sherlock was pretending to listen to the story of how he and John walked Mike out of the flat before the bomb went off. A story of parties, footballers, bombs, ambulances and Scotland Yard, he guessed it sounded exciting to Liz. Sherlock nodded, not really listening to Liz gush about a story she knew nothing about and wasn't there for.
Sherlock asks raising his voice slightly, no longer leaning on the door. He stands in front of John at the edge of the sitting room and kitchen.
I lifted my trouser leg and he was promptly horrified. "Why did  you keep this quiet? Why didn't you tell anyone?"
"John, wait up!" It was Molly--she ran to catch up with me. "How are you?" she said out of breath, smiling.
“No…. pitch is unplayable after the recent rains—” John said distractedly, frowning and reading the fine print of the rules and not looking at all at Mike.
'Speedy's Sandwich Bar and Cafe'
I won't stay long. I can't stay.
She turned to face me. "Oh, John!!" she cried and threw herself around my neck in a big hug and continued to sob, rather loudly.
I doubt we can remain friends. After he serves his 'sentence' with me, I can be on my way, to trouble him no more. Better that way, really.
I opened the bottle and poured some into an RMC mug. I handed it to him.
I missed loads of things that night, the stampede, the riot, the police. The ambulance ride. I woke up at hospital, the next day, no friends in sight. My last memory was falling over the railing. Turns out I fell into the crowd and broke my ankle. I lost consciousness in the stampede, when I was trampled by 250 people. I have no memory of that.
He's much taller than me, but he felt light in my arms.
John walked over to my chair, standing in front of me. I took a sip of whiskey and looked up at him, not anticipating what he had in mind until he planted his left knee against my thigh in the chair, not quite sitting in my lap.
It was nice though.
Just as he got to the stoop, Mrs. Hudson opened the door.
John just looked at him. He was Stamford's flatmate, wasn't he?
“John!” she said, looking down at her shoes. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you!”
John looked up at the poker and stopped, mentally calculating how to get it from him. They were both out of breath now, staring at each other.
Sherlock walks over to answer the phone.
“Not really.” He responded, numb.
"Already upstairs?"
Little actual studying was done. Apart from the parade of people, through John's room,
I had been watching John all night. Of course I had-
The booth was along the back wall and Sherlock was sitting at an angle to me at the edge of the booth, I could see his long legs under the table. A server came to deliver our order. I just had chips and a pint. Mary ordered that biscuit thing that look a monstrosity and a glass of white wine.
Sherlock's not as hairy as some blokes I've seen. Plenty of them in changing rooms at school. He doesn't smell bad either. As I sat across from him I noticed that the muscles of his arms as just as defined as his legs.
It's Liz--Mike's girlfriend, standing at the edge of the kitchen with her hands on her hips, staring at them. She seems unsteady on her feet. Both boys freeze. Sherlock whips his head 'round to glare at her.
“Wow, you sorted all that since last night?” John sat back down, head swimming. He didn’t realize Sherlock did not sleep.
Relieved to hear Sherlock speak rather than be dead asleep, John says, “Honestly, Sherlock I got no sleep at all. I feel like I have been on a journey.”
Mike turned red, his cheeks blotchy with embarrassment. He gave Liz a glare and put his finger up to his lips.
"Not interested." he stood up, grabbed his satchel and made for the door.
“Not working out..”  Sherlock repeated, “I’m glad.”
"Any help appreciated." I ventured.
He caught John’s lower lip in his teeth, tugging gently, wanting more, sucking on John's bottom lip. Sherlock wanted to tease and encourage John.  He wanted to promise John more.
“Everything’s new to me--I’m 16.” Sherlock sat down on the sofa.
I walk up to the floor guard, who sits behind a desk at the end of the corridor.
Turning away from the sink, he touched Sherlock's shoulder. "Dinner?"
John turns to Mary-not-Mary perplexed. “I’m, I’m afraid I have more questions, for you—for someone” he begins, holding up his hands, looking helplessly around no find no one there.   Blinded by a bright light, they are moving again. Not sure where he is just yet, he is blinking.
Were…
As soon as he recognized it was me, he was screaming at me and threw a punch, but I caught his fist. I had him pinned to the floor, hands above his head. By that time the police arrived.
"No, I saw--just by looking-books--everyone of them carries medical books,
I kept it, granted. but it was because I wanted to play his game...
come any closer," he said carefully, not surprised to see them. He rose from the chair and gently placed his book on a side table that held a lone teacup.
Sidestepping people, he was surprised by Irene Adler in the middle of the pavement, holding a large box.
He went to the kitchen, where there were loads of people arguing about which batch of cider was dosed. He couldn't remember which one he took his drink from. The fog was less dense in the kitchen and the walls were white, making it a bit easier to see. Trying to find an exit, he opened a fair few doors.
When he invited me to stay the night, it was fortunate that I had been propping up the door just then,  I might have fallen over.
"John Watson will never let you have what you really want and I have it. You need me." Jim's eyes were wide and he tipped his head to the side, so self assured.
"What was that for?" John asked again.
I was afraid. Afraid of what I'd find when I reached him. Right past the dead, frozen fountain, I could see a figure laying on the park bench. It was Sherlock for sure. Reclining on the bench lengthwise, one foot up on the arm rest of the bench, the other leg out to the side, bent at the knee. If it was any other day, one would think maybe he was resting his eyes. But it wasn't day, it was a frozen cold night, early winter in London.
"Why is she afraid of Mary?"
“Great.” John said, smiling, “Great to see you looking so----
And Mycroft may be able to help me, but only so much. I have to be careful,
out with Jim--and Irene Adler,
We were all interviewed by the police for the investigation.  The newspapers and morning shows wanted to talk to us too, but we weren't allowed.  Everyone wanted to find the bloke who was with Molly and rescued all the students and helped people find the door, but no one knew who he was.
or something like that.
"Molly,
"Did you ask them?"
Eventually, John asked Mary out on a date. After a few successful dates to the pub and cinema, John and Mary started officially dating. Mary often popped over to the flat a few times each week and they often went out on Fridays.
Too much temptation.
John's shoulders slumped, he was still irritated.
“Should’ve called me, we could’ve shared.” Mike said after he introduced John to his mum.
“Hello? Hi Sherlock.” John swallowed hard, waiting. Silence, breathing on the other side.
Lost in thought, young John turned back around and when he saw that Sherlock had not followed him he doubled back, jogging a bit. John joined Sherlock at the edge of the water, looking thoughtfully down, carefully pushing his foot against the ice, watching the air bubbles underneath and pushing until the ice cracked.
Nothing for it.
John got a letter from Sherlock over break. He didn’t remember giving him his address though. The letter was brief. It didn’t say much just:
She looks from one boy to the other, pulling her dressing gown tighter around her. "Fine, then. Maybe a dressing gown next time, Sherlock dear."
Sherlock found himself laughing.
“…And,” she continued, looking again down at her shoes, cheeks pink, but voice very determined,   “I wouldn’t want you to hurt him, so if you don’t feel the same way, I’d let him know as soon as possible, before it gets out of hand.” Molly walked away, leaving John to just stare after her in amazement.
"Obviously, I'm at your mercy, Lestrade. I'm relying on you to tell me my options." voice calm and not shaking at all.
Sherlock smiled, “And a bloody good left hook too, Mr. Watson! And there goes Jim Moriarty down like a stone!” Sherlock now sat down on his coat, crossing his legs, as well as his arms.
What can he give John that Mary cannot? Is there something he can offer him?
In a daze, he asked Mary to wait outside his sister's room, and she did. She sat on one of the metal chairs in the hallway.
Lestrade gave me an odd look when I arrived, like he was surprised to see me. I frowned at him. "What?"
John immediately took offence where none was given. Although Mary couldn't see, he was blushing with anger and embarrassment. Did Mary think he should have known? Well, he didn't and there were no clues at all. A rave, she said. Can you have a rave indoors?  John remembers reading about them in the papers, but had never been. He always thought they were out in remote fields, or something. The room was stifling--he downed his cider in one gulp. Probably time to go.
I changed my mind. I wanted to go over there and ask to go home with him on the spot. I wanted to go over there and grab him by the atrocious beige jumper and kiss him in the middle of the pub, in front of everyone. I wanted to take his clothes off right then and there.  I was ready to beg him, on my knees if I had to, to beg for forgiveness--of anything. Of anything I did real or imagined that made him unhappy.
“Don’t
“Really Mary, I like to have fun just as much as anyone but I’m knackered. I need to get up and get the train for home early tomorrow.” John didn't want to sound like an old man, but he didn't want to miss his train, either.
I assured Molly that I did talk to the police, when in fact I didn't. To hide being uncomfortable, I picked up John's bag of books, so I could avert my eyes.
the bloke from the A & E, wearing the same clothes, feet up on an ottoman. He looked up languidly from the book he was reading to address John.
As John tugged at the sleeve, Sherlock unloosened his arms, bringing them down from the front of his chest.
Just then, he hears a crash from the floor above and another sound much like an explosion.
“Oh right, sorry, that’s Angelo--he’s always like that, he never takes my money.” Sherlock waved a hand in the air.  “Let’s get a bottle of wine, then! My brother prefers sangiovese, but I’d rather have a pinot noir, especially if you are getting tomato sauce.”
John is listening, waiting.
He ran out into the hallway and looked around. At this time, the hospital was pretty quiet, there was no one there.
In my room, Sherlock sat down on my bed, quiet and still brooding. He took his gloves off and shoved them into his pockets.
His restless mind-- thoughts always churning, nights spent awake, pacing the floor, not able to sleep. Last night was the first night he slept in? he can’t remember. The balm of John on his restless soul. Could he stay away from drugs? If he kept busy, had things to do and John,  that just may be enough to tame his wild thoughts.
"Well, I didn't
John walked over to Mary and he gently touched her on the shoulder. "Thanks Mary."
F. Scot Fitzgerald
It's very difficult for me to look at John without smiling, Over the years I have practiced looking down at his shoes or mine. I'm very talented at looking off into the horizon, too.
"Yes, well...
"Oh no! Removed, actually--just removed, But quite on accident, of course. Inadvertent. Unintentional and unfortunate." Sherlock was very, very serious.
He shook his head, took another sip and looked at me, quiet. "You don't have to. You shouldn't, really." his voice was soft, practically a whisper.
“…her clothes, shoes, and …” she trailed off.
Mike wanted to come to this party and told Sherlock in no uncertain terms that before he’d unlock the lab he was stopping by this flat. Sherlock had to relent.
Mary likes me. She stands a little too close to me and licks her lips. Whenever we're together, Mary circles me like a shark.
That’s funny, John was actually more afraid of the opposite.
“Mum what happened?”
He dumps more powder onto the mirror. I'm confused. This looks more tan colored, still mostly white, though. "Something to ease your pain. Ease you down. Slowly,
John came in at about 10 am on Saturday morning. He was wearing the same clothes that he had on the night before. John had been feeling so much better after his concussion and was hoping to start to practice again with the football team that morning. With a spring in his step, he walked into the flat and found Mike at the kitchen table drinking tea.
John turned to Mycroft, "Not if I get to him first."
they were happy to see him and smacked him on the back.
“Which is fine, of course.” John said in too much of a hurry, seriously, eyes wide.
He was smiling, "Sorry to keep you waiting, I'm Sherlock..." he offered his hand, but John didn't take it. "...Holmes." he said as he slowly lowered his hand.  "I know I owe you an explanation." he offered a little more soberly.
me to not go anywhere.
And it turns out, the infernal device had caused some kind of irritation on the outside of my leg. I won't give anyone the satisfaction of complaining about it, either, even though it stung like hell.
"I'd call that an exaggeration. I'm not in shock at all." Sherlock said, rolling his eyes at the detective.
It's still early. He doesn't have to go back yet. We have time.
John looks around as the guests are welcomed in. He can see Mrs. Holmes and Mycroft, laughing and smiling. Various aunt and uncles that John had recognized from years past. And a few young children running about. Who do these children belong to?
John was talking to a group of football mates and their girlfriends and turned to her.
The body was found with a gunshot wound to the right side of the head and the gun in the right hand. Lestrade dreaded calling Sherlock, due to having already asked him to help the week before. He knew Sherlock was likely still recovering from a fight with a suspected forger. John and Lestrade's team did intervene, but not in time for Sherlock to avoid a beating.
it was taken from me."
Sherlock sighs and looks at John apologetically. "So.....I
He looked up at her surprised. "I am, how'd you know my name?"
The women were in swimwear, little dresses or shorts. Blokes were in shorts or trunks, shirts optional. I am of course, overdressed for the occasion. I often make that miscalculation.
“None of your business, Harry.” John tried to match her sing song with even, measured words.
"Er," This is new.
"ID tags." Someone said in my ear. "Military."
She grabbed John's hand and pulled him through the crowded party to the kitchen.
“Wasn’t difficult.” Sherlock looked at John, still wearing his football jersey that he wore yesterday to the party. He slept in it. And all his belongings in the world-money, clothes school books, all gone in the explosion.
"So, 'Mr. Hero' of the freshers riot,
I caressed his cheek with my left hand, he didn't move. His eyes were open and earnest and I was panic-stricken. I quickly flash back to my relationship with Victor, which didn't prepare me at all for--
Sherlock looked up at him blankly.
So I pulled the phone off the wall. Mycroft will just have to pay for that. School fees, I reckon.
Halfway down, in mid air--the lights in the club went out.
John looked around. Ian was right, packed with freshers. He smiled and bought the first round.
"I have something else for you. I can tell you're uncomfortable. Help to come down. Just a little help." He stands and I watch him dig deep into this trouser pocket and bring out another small package and unwrap it.
Sherlock leaned forward and kissed John on the lips, gently, tentatively. John moved forward slightly and his hand started to wander from Sherlock’s thigh to his waist, where he pulled half of his shirt out of his trousers in an attempt to find the soft warm skin of his back.
If he couldn't reach Sherlock, he'd try the next best thing.
I thought I might drop
Sherlock could not shake the guilt. As he trudged along by Jim's side, scarf tightly around his neck, he could only think of John. John who was worrying by his afflicted sister's side, at hospital, where Sherlock should really be. By John's side. He didn't let on to Mike and the girls that John really went to see Harry. And yet, he felt better here somehow than at the pub, where the music was loud, and the atmosphere was jovial. He wasn't in a jovial mood. He was angry and he didn't know why.
He wasn't sleeping, when called on in class he wasn't able to answer questions.  His mind was clouded with Harry and now with Sherlock. Harry was getting out rehab any minute, and he was positive she was not going home to stay with their mom. Where would she go? Back out on the street? She didn't have a job. Did the NHS just turn people out onto the street?  What did Sherlock say? That it was a
Sherlock stopped dead in his tracks.
I climbed out of bed and padded around the flat wrapped in my sheet. Grabbing a glass of cold water I saw a note on the kitchen table. Written in red ink on the back of an envelope. "Gone to work--John."
John put a hand up and gave a sheepish look, face flushed. “This is a bit fast, I think.”
There was no playing with Mary, John was finding out. She had piercing blue eyes, the kind that looked right into you, stinging a little.
Johns voice came out in almost a whisper. “I didn’t get to say that I was happy to see you.”
The night got much worse after that.
Mike Stamford had been keeping his eye on Sherlock and Jim the entire time. He wasn't so far into his cups as to realize that Sherlock Holmes spending time willingly with Jim Moriarty, notorious drug dealer on campus, was not a good idea.
"We have to go back to my school, sign me in and ..."
Sherlock walks out of the bedroom in his track pants, no shirt. “Good morning.” He says, trying to get John’s attention.
"She talks about you, a lot--
Walking along with Sherlock to the Yard, John heard one unbelievable story after another from the young man walking next to him. Left secondary school early, now at uni, he was allowed to do what sounded like what ever he wanted, as long as he produced quality research. He did have an adviser he met with regularly, to keep tabs. He explained to John he would likely be taking another degree and stay longer at uni. Why not? John thought, What kind of job could he get at 16?
