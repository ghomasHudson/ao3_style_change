Jarvis paused before saying, “You know, you and Mr. Rogers have experienced a lot of the same things. A lot of… a lot of loss. I know you’re doing well here, but it might be good to have someone around who you can relate to in that way. And it will certainly help him.”
“I come here a lot,” Mark said. “I’ve, uh, seen who you go home with. Unless I have something wrong.”
“And tonight, I was thinking we could go out. Not with a big group or anything, just my friend Bruce. We could go to a bar,” Tony said as Steve found a hat in his duffel bags. “If you’re comfortable with that.”
“These awards things are just hard,” Tony replied. “My parents aren’t around to come, and Nick is busy. I just hate going to these things alone, especially when other people have family with them.”
Tony was frustrated and heartbroken. Did Steve really think he had to live his whole life alone? It wasn’t a secret to either of them how Tony felt, and now it wasn’t a secret how Steve felt either. But that just wasn’t good enough. “But what about how I feel? I don’t care who you are. I don’t care what your job is.”
“Yeah, but graduate students don’t normally take-“ Tony looked at the schedule Nick had given him- “
“I feel like maybe we should shield Steve from the public. The bouncer was incredibly star struck,” Natasha said, smiling at Steve and touching his arm. Tony coughed.
They spent most of the day idling. Steve got moved in while Tony finished some assignments and tried very hard not to stare at Steve too much. He wasn’t terribly successful on the latter front, but he definitely could have been worse. After the sun went down, Tony asked if Steve wanted pizza for dinner, which led to a small argument about whether good pizza existed outside of New York. They ended up ordering a pizza anyway.
Tony swallowed. Of course he knew, because Steve had been wearing them in that stupid video he’d watched like a teenage stalker. “I mean I just thought you’d probably have aviators.”
,” Tony lied. Jesus, he hated lying to Bruce. “Look, I’m tired of cleaning. Let’s get dinner somewhere.”
Okay, not the confirmation Tony had wanted. It was still pretty vague. But also, Jesus, how much did this guy have to go through?
Tony put on Mean Girls. They sat on Steve’s bed and watched it together, Tony explaining jokes that Steve didn’t get. Steve didn’t try anything else, and neither did Tony.
Tony climbed into Steve’s bed. Steve pulled a blanket over both of them, which was new. Tony started the movie, and a few minutes in, Steve took Tony’s hand under the blanket.
“Hey,” Steve said. He hooked his finger under Tony’s jaw and turned Tony’s face toward him. “This magazine is garbage. Your dad would never be embarrassed of you. You dad would be so, so proud of you Tony. I’m proud of you.”
When he came back into the room, wearing a tight navy button down and gray slacks, his hair slicked back perfectly, Tony had to remind himself to breathe. Steve seemed so lost most of the time, but there was no denying that he was a
“Tony Stark drinking alone?” a voice said next to him. He looked over and saw a skinny guy wearing tapered jeans and a slim-fit white button down. He was hipster-hot, with thick glasses and a very expensive-looking haircut.
Tony nodded. “Okay, that makes sense. But just so you know, everything I say for the rest of the night is off the record.” He knew not to mess with reporters.
After a while, Steve pulled away, but he didn’t move his hands from Tony’s face. “Jesus, Tony, we are in so much trouble.”
“You have to meet him. At least for, like, business purposes. I bet he’s gonna use Stark tech if he goes back to being a superhero. Do you have a meeting set up? Like a secret meeting?”
“Yeah. That’s how most people do it now. It’s cheaper to watch shows on your computer than paying for cable.”
Steve Rogers took up almost the entire doorway. He was tall and broad-shouldered. His jawline looked like it was chiseled from marble, but so did the rest of his body. Even under a bomber jacket and tee shirt, Tony could tell this man was
They laced their fingers together and walked home slowly. When they got to the dorm, they changed into pajamas without looking at each other. Tony was about to get into his bed when Steve said, “Let’s watch a movie.
Tony shrugged and went back to the bar. If Steve wanted to say something to him, he should have just done it.
The answer was not hard. There were only a few bars that accepted fakes, even fewer that accepted the fake of Tony Stark, the recognizable tech heir, and even fewer that were worth drinking at. And McCool’s Irish pub was closest, so that’s where they went. Natasha drove faster than anyone should ever drive. Tony hoped it made Steve nervous.
Steve laughed, and his smile was genuine this time. Tony felt his insides shift at the sound of Steve’s laugh, at the spark in Steve’s eye.
He learned that news channels were uncomfortably good at getting up-to-date pictures of him off the internet. He made a mental note to make all of his social media as private as possible, or maybe even delete the accounts.
Mark stared at Steve for a few seconds before turning to Tony and saying, “I guess I’ll see you around.”
“Oh, um.” Tony drew the blinds so no one could see inside. “Sorry about that. It really will get better.”
Tony’s eyes widened. His dad had spent years trying to find Captain America, his friend from the war. Tony couldn’t remember a time when his dad didn’t spend his free time looking for Steve Rogers’s body. And after his parents’ death, Nick took up the mantle. He’d finally done it. And somehow…
Neither of them brought up The Moment, as Tony had started referring to it, all weekend. They sat next to each other when they watched TV, but Steve kept his hands firmly in his lap, and Tony was too nervous to try anything. Tony figured it was just some fluke thing, probably brought about by too many emotions and too many beers. But he still couldn’t stop thinking about it and silently wishing it would happen again. He caught Steve staring at him more than once throughout the weekend and he wondered what it meant. He wondered if it meant anything. He hoped it did.
“Oh, no problem. Nick hasn’t announced that you’re here yet. I bet if you put on a baseball cap and maybe those aviator sunglasses you have, you’ll look pretty inconspicuous.”
“No. They’ve posted pictures before, but never any articles. They didn’t really care about me until you came along.”
Tony stumbled into the car. It was so cramped in the back. Steve put one arm on the arm rest and wrapped the other around Tony’s waist. Tony shuddered.
Tony didn’t respond. He watched Steve watch the video. It was so earnest, so pure, the way Steve was excited by and curious about things Tony just took for granted. He couldn’t imagine being in the world and not knowing who The Ronnettes were. The thought of being so behind scared him. But it didn’t seem to scare Steve. Steve was so… optimistic, so in awe. It made Tony love the world a little more to know Steve was in it.
His tinkering was interrupted by a knock at the door. He looked at the door, then at his watch. It was 2:30. He never got visitors, at least not in the middle of the day. Brow furrowed, he got up and opened his door.
“Oh my god,” Tony said. Suspended animation? How was that possible? Did it affect his physical enhancements? Did this mean there was going to be a superhero now? In the 21
“These are pretty well-attended. Aren’t you trying to keep a low profile? Isn’t that what Nick wants you to do? There are going to be pictures.”
He had not expected the insane amount of news coverage of Steve Rogers leaving the hotel in New York to go to a yet-undisclosed location, but in retrospect he probably should have. Nick hadn’t announced any plans, and Steve still hadn’t talked to the press at all, so the fact that Steve Rogers checked out of the hotel with no indication of where he was going next was probably a big deal. He watched the coverage on TV and chuckled to himself when the commentators suggested he was going upstate or to Los Angeles. No one suggested Boston. Why would they? There wasn’t really any reason for him to come here.
Tony was mostly fine with the situation. He knew Steve was going to be staying in his house during Christmas break, and then he’d come back to school alone. He was fine feeling tortured as long as it had an end date and it meant that he could be close to Steve for a little while.
“Hey, here’s your food. I’m gonna go back to the bar and learn about music from Mark. Have a good time.”
Steve’s face lit up. He smiled wider than Tony had ever seen him smile. He got up from his desk and took the letter from Tony’s hands. “Wow, really? What kind of award?”
Which wasn’t more obvious than when Steve walked into the room after showering, wearing jeans that hung low on his hips, socks, and no shirt. His chest and shoulders were still glistening with water. His skin was smooth and free of blemishes. He looked perfect. Tony wanted to touch Steve, run his fingers against that torso, grip those shoulders while -
Steve laughed. “Well the other alternative is telling you we can’t do this anymore, and I can’t seem to tell you no.”
Nat kissed Tony on the cheek and opened the door. They went back in, and Tony apologized to Steve. They sat together in the booth for the rest of the night, trying to keep a conversation going with Bruce and Nat, who were too into each other to put in a lot of effort.
“Thanks, I’m sure it will,” Steve said. He smiled, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes. “I’ll just get unpacked.”
“I guess that’s true,” Tony said, “But his education is going to be greatly hampered by the fact that 18 year olds are going to be staring daggers at him in undergraduate classes. How old is he supposed to be, anyway?”
“Yes, it’s a very unusual case. Mr. Fury is still investigating, but it looks like rather than dying in the crash, Mr. Rogers was fixed in a state of suspended animation. When he came out of the ice, he was alive, and he hadn’t aged.”
“Pretending you don’t know where to find a book in the library does not constitute ‘talking,’ unfortunately.”
Tony’s stomach flipped as he read the page-long write-up. He was too upset to retain most of it, but a few sentences stuck with him:
They flirted for the next fifteen minutes until the burgers came out of the kitchen. Tony excused himself and brought a burger to Steve.
“I have a lot going on,” Tony responded. “But I really don’t think you came here from New York to check up on my cleanliness.”
“But there’s also the problem of my job. In a few months, I’m gonna be in SHIELD. That’s a dangerous job.”
They walked through the entryway together and did a lap of the room. Three photographers came up to them and asked for a photo. Steve agreed to each one, and he put his hand on the small of Tony’s back for every picture.
Steve laughed. It made Tony melt, but it also made him feel proud. He’d been the one to raise Steve Rogers’s spirits. That seemed like a big deal.
The crowd all clapped, and then gave Steve a standing ovation. At first, Tony was nervous. He didn’t know how Steve would react to the attention. But he stood up, smiled, and waved at the crowd. Tony loved watching him be the center of attention. He was so humble and, God, so gorgeous. Tony would love to be on his arm for as long as possible.
? Steve still had that moony expression on his face. Did Steve have a history of dating men? Because that would be wildly inconvenient.
Steve nodded, but his expression told Tony that he didn’t believe him. “Well, not a bad plan. I’m starving, so it’s worth a shot.”
“Me? What’s up with you? You’re drunk and sulking and talking to random guys and trying to go home with them – “
Nat shrugged. “I know you haven’t gone home with anyone else all semester, which is a big deal for you.”
“After today, I could definitely use a drink.” Steve walked to the door. Tony had to use superhuman strength to avoid staring at his ass.
Jarvis smiled. “Thank you very much.” He sat down and motioned for Tony to sit in his own chair, which he did. Jarvis was quiet for a moment, and then said, “I obviously wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t important and a little secretive. I, ah, have some news.”
Tony leaned back against the bench. He felt like he was going through a breakup, but there was no relationship. “So now we just live together with the knowledge that we want to be together but we can’t?”
Still looking at Tony, Steve gripped Tony’s thigh. Tony gasped. He knew Steve heard it. He bit the inside of his cheek. He could lean over, right now, and something could happen. He knew it could.
Bruce blushed a deep shade of red as Natasha came back, carrying three beers and a coke for herself. “If you want food, you’ll have to order it yourself.”
“Okay, so hold on,” Steve said, sitting next to Tony on his bed. “How does the mechanical engineering come in? Explain it to me like I was encased in ice when the first computer was invented.”
When they got to the car, Tony let everyone get into the car. This time, Bruce sat in the front and Steve got in the back. Tony’s head was swimming. He could barely process where he was, much less where he was supposed to sit in the packed car.
“That was maybe a little harsh. But seriously, you’re Steve’s favorite person in the world. He would be so lost if you two stopped being friends.”
A few weeks after the awards ceremony, Tony started flirting with guys at the bar again. He wasn’t going to get what he wanted from Steve, so why not go back to what used to work? He figured a good hookup would clear his mind, and there was no shortage of guys who were interested. He knew it upset Steve to see him with other guys, but he didn’t care. It was Steve’s fault anyway. If he would chill out about his duty or whatever, they could be together. But Steve wouldn’t, so they couldn’t. And anyway, Tony never went home with anyone. He just couldn’t do it. He’d rather go home and watch movies with Steve than spend the night with anyone else. Tony guessed he had it pretty bad.
Not that he shuts up for too long, because Steve’s looking confused and Tony opens his mouth as soon as he realizes why. “Aunt Angie—uh, Angela Martinelli—she was Aunt Peggy’s wife.”
In between storming HYDRA strongholds, Steve bullies himself into voicing the obvious question. Stark is in the SSR lab, shirt rucking up under his suspenders, hair flying wild, and a manic glint in his eye that usually means Steve’s going to get some high-advanced, possibly explosive new gadget.
Steve has a couple of ideas as to what he’d like his soulmate to be like—not that he wouldn’t love them anyway, but if they’re meant to compliment him perfectly then he can’t really imagine they wouldn’t be something like he daydreams.
JARVIS is a no-good AI who’s far too fond of Pepper for Tony’s self-preservation. A better AI—a more
On it goes, week after week, until Steve is complaining about the ending of a recent Nancy Drew and Mr. Kohn is handing him a wrapped-up rectangle with a bemused smile.
So what if he spends a lot of time designing and testing Cap’s gear? He spends the time he needs to spend on everyone’s equipment—if he didn’t, he’d be sending them into battle with sub-standard gear. He couldn’t live with himself otherwise. Maybe he spends a little extra time of Cap’s equipment, but that’s just because it’s so detailed. He’d do the same for anybody else.
Two months later he’s living in a skyscraper with two superspies who act like middle schoolers, a very intelligent man with very stretchy pants, an alien god who’s a harder partier than Tony, and Janet Van Dyne. Who shrinks, flies, and keeps ragging on him about his design choices.
“Well…” Jarvis cleared his throat. “That’s where the bad news comes in. Steve Rogers is obviously going to be adjusting a lot to the modern world, and he needs to spend some time catching up. So he’s going to be going to school for a little while. He’ll be coming here.”
Tony made a detour to the student union, where he knew they sold Us Weekly. He bought one, a lump forming in his throat, and raced back to the dorm.
“Really a good news/bad news situation,” Jarvis continued. “The good news is that Nick Fury found Steve Rogers. And he’s alive.”
Steve held Tony’s jaw and brough Tony’s face back to his, kissing him again, but softer now. He carded his fingers through Tony’s hair. Tony whimpered into the kiss and wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist and drew him as close as he could. They kissed just as urgently, but something had shifted. It was like both of them had realized what they were doing, and they both realized how badly they wanted to do it. Tony never wanted to stop, never wanted to lose the feeling of Steve’s body against his, of their mouths moving together.
Tony rolled his eyes and went back to his code to avoid answering. The truth was, he hadn’t hooked up with anyone since he met Steve. Steve didn’t understand why Tony would want to have drunken flings when there were probably people who wanted to be with him for real. Tony would have fought with him about it if he wasn’t so hung up on him. It was hard to want to be with anyone else when all he could think about was Steve.
“Aren’t you cold?” a voice said next to him. He looked up to see Nat standing above him, her arms crossed.
Almost instinctively, Tony placed his hand over Steve’s. Steve’s skin was absurdly soft. Tony could feel his mouth watering again. He took a deep breath. “You’re welcome,” he whispered, so quietly that he wasn’t even sure if Steve had heard it.
Jarvis stood, and Tony followed. They shook hands and Tony opened the door for Jarvis. Just before he left, Tony asked a question that was weighing heavily on his mind.
in a way Tony just wasn’t yet. Seeing Steve looking so good made Tony feel young and scrawny, completely inadequate as Steve’s guide to the 21
Tony narrowed his eyes at Jarvis. What exactly was he implying? Nick couldn’t possibly know about Tony’s…
“Please. I’ve seen you watch more news in the last week than in the entirety of our freshman year. You’re crushing.”
“I know this is a strange situation,” Nick confessed, handing Tony a sheet of paper. “But SHIELD doesn’t have the time or resources to bring him up to speed on… well, on everything. College is a good place for traditional and cultural education. This is Steve’s schedule for the semester. Once Christmas break starts, he’ll come and work for us.”
“Well, if you ever have anything to say, you know you can talk to me. Or not, you know. I’m good at talking about things, but I’m also good at avoiding emotions. So whatever you want, I’m here for you.”
Tony looked up at Steve and realized that he had been crying, but he couldn’t remember when he started. “Uh…” he didn’t know what to say. He handed the magazine to Steve.
“Maybe I shouldn’t meet your friends tonight, Tony,” Steve said, collapsing in his bed. “I appreciate the gesture, but it’s just too much.”
“He went into the ice at 27. MIT has graduate programs, so it shouldn’t be too weird for him to be around campus.”
“And you liked that? That was fun? That’s not the Tony I know, the one who’s been hanging out with me this week.”
The gentle kiss intensifies as Tony tangles his fingers in Steve’s dripping hair, pulling him in to slot their mouths closer together, tilting his head for the perfect angle. He opens eagerly for Steve’s tongue sweeping along his bottom lip, sucking on it to hear Steve moan. He can feel Steve’s hand clenching around the curve of his hip and the thick heated length of Steve’s erection pressing against his thigh.
Tony wakes early the next morning, which is unlike him. He knows it’s early because the sun outside the large windows isn’t high enough to be noon yet and he frowns as he blearily blinks his eyes open. He immediately spots the problem, and the reason why he’s awake at such an ungodly hour.
“We can kiss on the cheek,” Tony amends, thinking it over. It would probably benefit them to show a little affection to really sell their fake relationship. He takes the tablet back to add to the document.
Sarah's praise and the thought of Steve saying anything nice about him to his mom brings his blush forward and Tony knows his cheeks are flaming red by now. He just barely resists the urge to cover his face.
Tony had always known he would love Steve forever, from the day he was old enough to know the legend of Captain America and later the even bigger story of Steve Rogers, to the moment he was lying frozen on a concrete floor in Siberia, freshly betrayed. He’d always known, had never stopped loving Steve even when that love was pure redfire agony.
Then Steve is arching up to press kisses to his collarbone and chest as his hands skim the bare skin of his thighs and Tony tries not to feel anything at all but the sensation of Steve's touch.
Tony groans. “Can't we just skip ahead to making out and living happily ever after? We're not writing a new contract, are we?”
“Ma!” Steve sounds mortified, blushing furiously red. He's still laying on top of Tony, hands pinning his arms up on the armrest and neither of them have gathered enough of their wits to scramble upright. “It's not what it looks like, I swear—”
Tony's orgasm blindsides him, and he gasps as he spills onto the towel beneath him. Before Steve he never would’ve thought he could come untouched after turning fifty. Steve holds him through the tremors, his cock still slowly moving in and out of Tony, dragging whimpers from his lips as his skin buzzes, drunk on oversensitivity. His hole clenches tight around Steve, knocking him off his rhythm and his thrusts become more frantic and more desperate as he chases his own release. Steve comes soon after with a loud cry, filling Tony wet and warm.
That year, on the last day of summer, Tony remembers the silk hatbox and writes his first letter, and he puts Janet out of his mind. They stay friends, but the thought of loving her never comes around again.
Nevertheless, it doesn't make it any less hilarious to watch him and Bucky struggle with their skis as they wobble on shaking knees and clumsy feet, trying their best to make it halfway down the bunny slope without tipping over into the snowbanks. Bucky seems to get the hang of it quickly enough with Sam’s help but Tony is laughing too hard to be of much assistance when he watches Steve speed down the hill only to flop into the snow at the bottom.
That shuts Steve up. He watches silently, no longer trying to explain whatever it was he was trying to explain as Tony reaches into his bag and pulls out the tablet they had signed their contract on. Tony tosses it at Steve, who fumbles the catch and they both watch silently as the tablet falls onto the slush covered concrete. The screen cracks, and isn't that a pretty analogy, Tony thinks.
Tony takes a deep breath. “First, I would like to apologize for accosting you in the hallway yesterday. I was in a state of panic and I didn't know what else to do and the last thing I want to do is hurt Pepper and Rhodey.” And Pepper and Rhodey say he needs to work on owning his mistakes. Character growth, happening right here.
Tony can hear the shower running by the time he finally rolls over and blinks the bleary sleep from his eyes. He finds the notepad by the nightstand with a page detached. The note is folded in half like Steve likes to do, Tony’s name printed in neat letters on the front.
Tony tries to have as normal of a day as possible despite everything but he still feels blindsided when the first note comes because he had somehow forgotten Steve's self-added stipulation.
Tony smiles, his mouth feeling tight as he tilting his head down to peck Steve on the lips before leaning over to kiss Pepper’s cheek. “Shouldn’t be too long,” he lies, walking out into the hall just as his phone is about to shrill its last ring.
“You can have this all to yourself if you’d like,” Tony replies teasingly, stroking his thumb along Steve’s wrist, grazing his pulse. The pads of his fingers brush over the Mark VII cuffs and up inside Steve’s sleeve.
Steve raises his head off Tony’s lap and sits up. Tony tries his best to school his features when Steve looks at him with alarm, large hands reaching over to pull him close. The stroke of Steve’s fingers against his jaw and the press of Steve’s forehead against his is grounding, but Tony still feels out of his depth as his phone shrills and shrills in his hand.
Steve is surprisingly compliant, even leaning into Tony and pressing him up against the locker and bracketing him with his huge arms. And the kiss, it's surprisingly
“Yeah, this is perfect,” he lies and closes the minuscule distance between them. He wants to pretend for a little longer.
“How dare you try to make me a better person,” Tony manages to quip after a lengthy silence. “Although I do have to say, public transit is a strange way to go about it. I hear that usually makes people
Tony looks around the room, following where Bruce’s gaze went. He stares at the new tech he’s never seen before, the gleam and glow of machines he doesn’t know the functions for. The window outside shows the grey sky, old and new all at once, the skyline in the distance that was once as familiar as the back of his hand now looks like a crumbling line of jagged broken teeth, a stranger he’s never met. His eyes land on the chart at the foot of the bed and the date marked at the top makes his blood freeze cold in his veins.
With Rhodey gone, he only has Pepper, Loki, and Natasha and he can't help but feel a little resentful because while the rest of his friends share a majority of the same classes, the only time he'll see them is during lunch. While everyone else is having an easy time with throwaway classes to round out their senior year, Tony's schedule is jam packed with fucking AP courses thanks to Howard.
Tony settles back on Steve’s chest with phone in hand as he flicks through his notifications. Tony feels slightly guilty when he sees the thirty missed texts from Pepper and Rhodey that go from annoyed to angry to exasperated to resigned, but it’s too far into the night to even make a very late entrance to the gala. Besides, it’s hard to feel too badly about missing the evening when his husband is laying in bed with him and his skin is tingling in all the places where Steve had pressed soft kisses. He’ll make it up to them another time. He tosses the phone aside and turns back to Steve.
“Point is you don't have to,” Tony says. “It's an archaic and silly dick measuring contest and I'm not some bride parceled up with a dowry about to go to my new husband's village—”
It’s also something Tony had felt the need to hide from him for a while, Steve can tell. He knows his husband well. Steve frowns, and thinks that won’t do at all.
Students are not usually allowed outside to get lunch and Steve, goody two shoes, never done a thing wrong, perfect football team captain
“I don't think anything you do can ever be boring, Tony,” Steve says when he turns back to him. “I might not completely understand whatever it is you're working on, but I want to know. If you want to tell me.”
Tony's heart cracks open, the familiar feeling of heartbreak washing over him at those words. He knows Steve is still half asleep and he probably didn't mean that. Or maybe he thinks they can be real friends once everything is over and done, but Tony doesn't know if he can be strong enough to be around Steve once Peggy is back in the picture. Not after having a minuscule taste of what being with Steve could be like.
Tony keeps his mouth shut as Howard begins to start his tirade on how worthless Tony is, how slow his progress, how little he’s doing for Stark Industries, what a failure he’s going to become, how poorly his prototypes are performing, he’s so disappointed, he really expected more of his heir. It’s the same spiel as always. It’s nothing new.
“Nope,” Tony replies, fluttering his lashes. “Only you.” He leans over to smack a big wet kiss on Pepper’s cheek, and Pepper gracefully takes it, quietly sighing in exasperation.
“Thank you, J,” he murmurs, stubbornly trying not to think of that inevitable future. He rubs absently at his chest as he leans against Jarvis, standing in a comfortable silence for a moment while they watch the snow fall outside the kitchen windows.
probably like fifty times now. One time, he tried to get us to go to a Middle Earth LARP. In the middle of a forest. In Pennsylvania.”
“Star Trek was always meant to be deep,” Steve says. “It’s all analogies for how we should treat other people and allegories for race and culture. You would've known that if you paid more attention to the original series.”
Tony turns back to their daughter. Morgan pats his cheek when she’s done, and gives him a bright smile. “There,” she says, nodding confidently. “You’re a twelve now.”
And there's the earlier mood, returning with a rush of relief that warms Tony down to his toes. It's so easy to talk to Steve, alarmingly easy, but he knows if Steve really peels back the layers, he won't like what he finds. No one does when they look closely enough, not even his parents (
,” Tony replies, his voice little more than a breathy sigh. He can't help but notice the way Steve's eyes dilate at the sound. “I'm going to fucking kill you if you stop—” his voice breaking apart into a stuttering gasp as Steve presses open mouthed kisses along the column of his neck and the side of his jaw. “Yeah, this is
“I want to,” Steve says simply, but he draws away. Tony misses his warmth and instinctively steps closer to Steve. He fits so perfectly in the slot of Steve's arms, it hurts and aches and burns and it's stupid, it's so, so,
“You’re still pretty spry for a hundred and eleven,” Tony says with a slow smirk. “You never did tell me your secret. It’s pilates, isn’t it?”
The smile Tony gives in return is glasspane brittle. “Thanks, J,” he murmurs as he leaves. “There's no need to worry.”
“Worst sleepover ever,” Tony mutters, flopping back onto his bed. “That's why Pepper is my favorite. That was until she left me with you wolves for yearbook. Why do you all hate me?”
“See,” Pepper says, “everything worked out. I can't say I wasn't worried about you when I got my letter, but I can understand, Tony. And I'm glad I got it, even though I know you don't think of me that way anymore.”
Tony sighs, taking a sip of his tea. It's too hot and it burns his tongue, but he welcomes the pain. He relishes the sting that distracts him from the bigger ache that claws at his chest.
Tony pays dearly for his laughter when Steve kicks off his skis and tackles him into one of the snowbanks. Before Tony can react and push him away, Steve is shoving a handful of snow down the collar of his jacket. Tony gasps as the ice cold snow melts against his warm skin, feels the unpleasant trickle of melted water running down his back and soaking through three layers of thermals and sweaters.
Tony steels himself, wrapping his heart in every layer of armor forged from Howard, from his mother, from everything he’s ever known. He pastes on his best press smile and straightens his spine. He’s going to make this easier for the both of them, a parting gift. He will not fall apart in front of Steve.
Steve and Peggy are on the verge of breaking up, and newer rumors start spreading that it's because Steve likes someone else, and maybe possibly very definitely because Sandy totally heard it from Karen who heard it from Emily who heard it from Brock that Steve cheated on Peggy.
Jarvis sits next to him and doesn't say anything for a long time. Tony is grateful for the silence. He thinks if he opens his mouth to say anything, he might start sobbing and never stop. He doesn't know if he's ever hurt so much before. The pain is excruciating and firebright in his chest and nothing will alleviate it.
That year, his parents send him to summer camp. His parents call it character development. Jarvis calls it enrichment. Tony calls it what it is: his parents don't want to see him for eight weeks.
Tony jolts. He almost wants to shy away, but his hips buck up of their own accord when Steve licks him again. Steve flattens his tongue to swipe a broad stripe against him before switching to smaller little licks that leave Tony a boneless heap melting into the chair.
“Maybe,” Tony admits, his other hand already stroking along the hard length of Steve's cock as he grinds down on his fingers. “But c’mon, honeybun, don't you want to play?”
The sun is setting by the time they make it back to their hotel. They watch the last of its descent from their balcony overlooking the Aegean Sea as the sun sinks behind the cliffs on the horizon, coloring the whitewashed stone walls and blue domed roofs around them pink and purple. The last rays shine bright across the foam capped waves crashing below them as the last light disappears and stars begin to dot the sky. High above them, constellations that inspired astronomers and wrote myths sparkle against a velvet black sky. Tony cannot think of any place he would rather be than here with Steve’s arms wrapped around him and his belly full of good food and sweet coffee.
“Oh, don't I know it,” Tony says, not quite realizing what he's said until Steve chokes on his water and Sarah laughs. He joins her in laughter despite his burning cheeks, and with a heavy ache in his chest, Tony knows he’s going to miss Sarah Rogers once the gig is up.
Something in Steve's expression cracks a little for a split second, and if Tony hasn't spent so much time looking at him (a secret he will take to his grave), he would never have noticed. As suddenly as the crack appears, it's gone and Steve is back to looking politely bland and unreadable.
“Is that so?” Tony can feel where Steve is pressed thick and hard against his thigh and the only thought that comes to mind is
His heart is trying its hardest to beat its way out of his chest so it may land in Tony's hands as Tony's tight heat welcomes him again and again. There’s nothing but their shared breaths and shared space and shared bodies, as close as they can possibly get without metamorphosing into one creature. What can possibly describe what they’re doing, if not making love?
“The clause is that we only touch when there are others who can see,” Tony explains. “What’s the point of being touchy feely in private?”
Tony is covered nearly head to toe in powdery white as Loki and Nat laugh at him, and Jarvis smiles indulgently. Tony doesn't understand why baking is so difficult. He’s good at chemistry, and they're basically the same thing but he's already messed up the cupcake batter twice, and he's running out of ingredients.
“We didn’t even start cleaning yet,” Natasha points out. “Don’t be so dramatic. You're asking to be buried alive in this pigsty,” she says as she gingerly picks her way through Tony's room, trying her best to evade the piles of dirty laundry and disassembled motherboards.
Tony sighs and smiles gratefully at Jarvis when he hands him a steaming mug of coffee. He pushes off and away from the counter, mentally preparing himself for another long night in his lab.
“Yeah honey, fill me up. I love how your big cock feels inside me. I’ve never been so full before. You always—
“Your cooking is incredible,” Tony tells him earnestly, his words muffled around the food in his mouth.
Tony’s Twitter notification dings just as he steps out onto the sidewalk and with a frustrated groan, he flicks the app closed before his eyes can linger too long on the photo someone already posted of him and Steve kissing in the hall.
Tony is in so deep, he knows this, and it terrifies him. Every time Steve takes him by the hand, it warms him to the core. It makes him ache bone deep when he sees Steve smile softly at him. Each innocent kiss pressed to his cheek and jaw makes heat creep up from his belly until he feels immolated, fever bright.
In the copilot’s chair next to him, Nebula sighs a soft gasp of relief. They’re alive. Somehow, impossibly, they’re alive.
Steve, they’ve been together all day, but the ache of being even an inch from his husband is too much to bear sometimes. Every kiss feels like coming home, warm and honey sweet, made new with every second they’re not pressed together as two halves of a whole. If Steve’s soft exhale is any indication, Tony knows he feels the same way too. It’s taken them over a decade to be here in this moment, and every second together is hard fought and earned in blood and war. But no time to be maudlin now.
Steve is really playing up the part of the dutiful boyfriend that night, running to fetch whatever Tony wants for the enormous fir they set up by the living room windows and providing him with a constant supply of hot cocoa. Tony finally manages to pin him down when they start putting ornaments on the tree, and they find a spot on the rug with their friends as Tony curls up snug in Steve's lap. He folds himself across Steve's crossed legs and tucks his head beneath Steve's chin as Steve's big arms wrap around his back and over his knees to hold him steady. Tony sips happily at his hot cocoa, occasionally offering some to Steve as he contentedly watches their friends from his throne.
Suddenly, he understands why she has never stood up to Howard, even when she knew what he’s doing. She’s seen the red marks on Tony’s hands, the bruises on his arm. She’s heard the way he speaks and yells and screams. She’s turned a blind eye to the way Tony’s expression goes flat as he hunches his shoulders when Howard walks into a room.
They barely manage to make it to the bed a handful of feet away before they're tearing each other's clothes off, mouths pressed together in heated kisses. They land on the covers with a soft
Steve had weighed all of ninety pounds soaking wet when he came running to Tony's defense years ago. Steve had taken on four bullies twice their size and gotten two black eyes to save him. And here is Steve saving Tony again.
“I'm glad,” Tony says honestly, his words working around the lump rising in his throat. His heart is aching for Steve. When he reaches up with his free hand to trace along the edge of Steve's jaw with his thumb, he can feel Steve's pulse beneath his fingers. “I'm glad your dad was amazing and I'm glad your mom is the strongest and most wonderful woman ever.”
“I love you too,” Tony replies, peering up to look back at Steve. Steve’s eyes are so blue in the midmorning sun.
Tony feels like a little boy all over again, remembering all the times he sat in his mother’s room and watched avidly as she applied her makeup and dressed up for galas and balls and events. He had always been entranced seeing her go from beautiful to breathtaking with the swipe of a red lipstick and a line of black kohl around her dark eyes. It was a privilege to be asked to help her with her necklace, to fetch her earrings, to help her pick a pair of shoes to go with her dress.
“I’ll hold you to it,” Pepper replies drily. “You're going to have to remember your own stuff this year. I have to juggle Student Council, Yearbook, Model UN. Tony—”
“Even when it seemed like there wouldn’t be anything and it was just all in my imagination, I thought what we were doing could be enough, and I thought I could deal with it but I've loved you for four years, Tony, and—”
It's the expression Steve captured in the eyes that stuns Tony the most, the exhaustion and intensity etched in black and white on the page, expressive and lovely. They're far too beautiful to really be his eyes, but he recognizes them finally. He realizes with a heart clenching pang they’re the same eyes Steve always draws in his notes. Those drawings are usually simple little things flowing in generous curving lines and rough hatches to indicate the barest hints of shadow. Steve draws a lot of hands, Tony remembers and he'd never really thought too hard about the scribbles until now.
Tony’s eyes are downcast in their reflection when he says with an overly bright voice, “Just peachy, sunshine. Let’s go to bed,” but Steve doesn’t budge.
. Maybe it’s the finery. Maybe it’s just Steve. But there’s a part of Tony that is one half burning obsession and one half breathless wonder he feels for his husband, a hunger and a love he feels is too big to contain on most days, and he aches with the need to be as close as possible. He thinks if he could, he would open the spines of his own rib cage to fit Steve in the hollow of his chest right next to his heart where his arc reactor had once nestled, where he’ll be kept safe and warm.
Steve's eyes are half lidded and dark in the dim light when he raises his head slightly. His voice is rumble deep when he says regretfully, “we didn't make it.”
Happy does his best to keep them from touching Tony, but even with the help of the school security guards, they can barely hold back the flock of vultures. It takes everything in Tony to hold onto his emotionless public face, gritting his teeth until his mouth feels numb. He will not show weakness to the horde, they will eat him alive.
“Good morning, beloved,” Steve says, his voice like a growl, deep bass rumble thrumming beneath the skin under Tony's tongue.
Tony laughs but he doesn't quite feel the humor behind it. “If anyone works too hard, it's you Pepper,” he retorts. “You have so much going on with the yearbook, and student council, and Model UN. Pepper, you're actually a superwoman.”
They wake up in the late afternoon when Pepper knocks on their door to ask them to join everyone at the pool. Tony blinks the sleep from his eyes and stretches languidly, the cool cotton sheets a balm to his sleepwarmed skin. He relishes in the secret ache he finds in the dip of his spine as he arches his back, feeling sore in all the right places. He stretches his arms above his head to work out the kinks in his muscles before he sighs with satisfaction and sinks back against the pillows. Steve is awake and watching him with darkened eyes when he looks over.
“Now,” Pepper says, with steel in her tone that brooks no room for disagreement, “you're going to go home and sleep. This project can wait.” She holds up a hand when Tony starts to protest. “It can wait. You're no good to anyone if you collapse on top of your laptop. Get a good night's sleep and I'm sure a solution will come to you. It always does,” she says fondly.
“Just Sarah will do, sweetheart,” she says kindly. “I've heard so many great things about you, Tony. Steve won't stop talking about how smart you are and all of the great things you accomplished. He showed me the paper you published last month, he was so proud of you!”
Steve chuckles quietly, his laughter shuddering through his chest and Tony can feel it against his belly. “I need to get home before mom does,” he says.
They don't talk about how they were almost friends years ago, and they don't talk about Tony's letter where he tells Steve he fell in love with him because of his courage and reckless selflessness, the defense of righteousness.
The look is always sad and forlorn and slightly accusatory all at once, as though there’s some vitriol on the tip of his tongue but Steve can’t get himself to vocalize the words, before it fades into a shuttered mask of practiced blankness. Tony doesn’t know what Steve's fucking problem is, but if he's not going to say whatever it is he wants to say to his face, Tony doesn't care. He
“Tomorrow,” she insists. “And tomorrow, you're also going to talk to Rhodey. He's been really worried about you, wondering why you haven't been answering either of our calls.”
It hurts Steve to see Tony's confidence wane like this. From the days when he had thought Tony's public persona was innate arrogance to these quieter more private days when Steve knows that’s all a facade to protect the soft innards of a very damaged man, there is a noticeable difference to the way his husband holds himself. Even the steely mask Tony likes to wear outside of their home is softening. The projected confidence is still there, but Tony is quieter.
He supposes it’s all good and convenient. This way, Steve will have more time to spend with Peggy without Tony hanging around him like a desperate puppy begging for scraps. He’s certain his presence is keeping Peggy at arms length, and he frowns, just wondering now why Steve hasn’t made more of an effort to win her back. Tony hasn’t pushed it because he’s been selfishly enjoying Steve’s attention, but what’s Steve’s excuse?
He barely realizes what he's said, but the sound of the pen stops for a brief moment before resuming. He drifts off again as he feels gentle fingers comb through his hair and there's a whispersoft kiss pressed tenderly to his forehead. He smiles and lets the susurration of pen and paper lull him back to sleep.
“I can just see the headlines tomorrow. ‘Captain America Gropes Husband at Stark Industries Fundraiser,’” Tony declares with a dramatic wave of his hand.
“You got it, boss,” Happy says quietly as he pulls away from the curb and Tony refuses to watch Steve shrink into the distance from his windows. He looks steadfastly forward and tries not to think about anything at all.
Tony moans and trembles, ruing the day he encouraged Steve to talk dirty, and his husband hasn’t stopped since, coming up with more creative and filthy things to whisper into the curve of his ear. Steve is going to be the death of him, he thinks, as his husband continues to murmur encouragement. Tony pushes back greedily as Steve feeds him his cock inch by slow inch, both of them sighing when he’s finally buried to the hilt.
They attend the same camp again the next year, Tony's last year of freedom before his life will belong to his father's company. Despite the year apart, their friendship is much the same and Janet is exactly as he remembers. The only difference is, Tony thinks he might be a little bit in love with her.
“I wanna suck you off,” Tony murmurs where he’s panting against Steve’s cheek. He can feel the shivering response before Steve tips his head back against the chair with a loud groan. “Let me, let me, let me,” Tony begs, his mouth feeling swollen ripe.
Natasha shrugs again. “That was a dick move, Stark,” she says, and Tony knows Pepper would agree if she was here. He can't help but feel a little ganged up on. “Knowing you wouldn't apologize anytime soon, I did it for you. Also, I promised Loki you are going to buy him his favorite dessert and pay for dinner tonight.”
“So,” Steve says, tightening his arms around Tony again, “I had this whole thing planned for Valentine’s Day where I was going to confess my love and everything, clear this whole thing up so you weren’t under the impression I was pretending. I was going to ask you to go steady and go to prom with me. It was going to be really romantic, Sam and Bucky were helping me plan all of it. There were flowers and balloons involved.”
“I guess,” Steve says quietly. “Peggy always said I was a really bad boyfriend. She says I didn't pay enough attention, and I never did any of the little small romantic things for her. I was too focused on the grand gestures. But—”
It feels a lot like heartbreak when Rhodey hugs him goodbye with overly bright eyes and trembling arms. Tony swallows back his own tears and puts on his brave face, even as he struggles to keep himself from begging his best friend to stay.
Steve Rogers’ normally handsome face is twisted dark with rage, his eyes narrowed into angry slits. He's leaning so far into the other guy’s face, Tony has a hysterical moment where he thinks the reporter might fall onto his ass to get away from Steve.
“Unnecessary,” Tony repeats under his breath. “When I take over the world, I'm going to overhaul that facsimile of a viable infrastructure and make it actually functional.”
Tony's heart clenches tight, can't bear to tell Jarvis he's not, not really. Because nothing is real and it'll all end soon. Steve is going to leave once Peggy takes him back and Tony will be left in this cold house to pick up the pieces of his own foolish heart.
“I wish you could see how perfect you look like this,” Steve rasps, his throat achingly tight, “how gorgeous you look spread out underneath me.” Steve wishes he has the words to tell Tony he would move worlds for him, but there are no words in any language in the universe that can be enough to illustrate how Steve feels. His clumsy tongue tries anyways. “I wish you could know how much I love you, how much I’ll always love you. Nothing will ever change that.”
“Says you who only had to wear a robot arm,” Sam retorts, reaching over to steal some of Clint’s chips.
It's not that Tony doesn't think the senior trip will be fun, but he thinks that a vacation with just him and Steve and their own private island would be much
to let them even order food to be delivered to the front lobby. Tony stares up at Steve incredulously and that smug little grin curves up even wider as his ridiculous baby blues shine with a mischievous glint.
“Oh darling boy,” Jarvis says thickly as he wipes the tears from Tony's face with his fingertips. “I'm not a fool, nor am I blind. I've seen the notes Steven wrote for you and I've seen the drawings he made of you. Yes, they are of you. And no one who is not in love with their muse will ever draw them so beautifully. There is affection in every stroke of his pencil, and it is plain as day for anyone who sees them.”
“You’ll feel better when you’re more organized because this is ridiculous,” Natasha murmurs as she tries to navigate around his piles of garbage. She says something else in Russian Tony doesn't catch as she flicks a dirty sock off of his chair. Her mouth a moue of distaste as she sits, surveying Tony's hoarders paradise from her throne. “How did you even let it get this messy? How do you find anything like this?”
Steve leans down to press a kiss against his jaw, rumbling the words into his skin, “guess we’ll just have to practice until it becomes so good, you can't even say anything afterwards.”
is you. That’s why I couldn’t ever show you my room. You would’ve run screaming for the hills when you saw how many drawings and paintings I had of you. You might still run screaming for the hills now that I’m telling you—”
“I guess met isn't the right word,” Sarah laughs. “We've never been properly introduced until now but I have seen you before. Steve's freshman year.”
“So how about round three?” Tony says when they part, his voice slightly breathless. He leans down to scrape his teeth along the column of Steve’s neck. His hand is already reaching down to press against Steve’s growing erection.
Steve hums noncommittally, his eyes intent and nearly black. “Something like that,” he replies, his hands gentle as he guides Tony to turn onto his front.
Homework falls by the wayside as the evening progresses. They give Dostoyevsky a real effort, they do, but an argument about the original series versus the new Star Trek reboot means
. The word hurts like a blow and Tony wants to shake his head, he’s not he’s not. It breaks him to hear Steve say these things and it kills him to wonder if he means them. He can barely stand the breathlessness he hears in Steve's voice as he fucks into him, heart aching with the way Steve says his name. He
Tony scrambles out of Steve’s lap as soon as he sees them and runs at Rhodey with a loud cry, launching himself into Rhodey’s arms with a loud, “Sugarbear!” Pepper smiles affectionately as she walks over to greet Steve and the rest of their friends, leaving Tony with Rhodey.
“It's also part of my job as your best friend and big brother,” Rhodey says, ignoring him, and Tony does
“Your shorts have been ridiculously tiny all trip,” Steve growls, his hand gripping tighter around the globe of Tony's ass. He rubs the side of his face against Tony's leg, and Tony knows his skin is going to be red and sensitive from the beard burn, a reminder of their morning for the rest of the day. “What if everyone saw the marks I leave on your thighs, hmm? All marked up by me? Everyone would see how you’re all mine.”
“Wow, you really didn’t know,” Tony mutters. “We’re both so fucking stupid.” Steve makes a noise like he's about to protest but Tony gathers his nerves, steps closer to Steve and shuts him up by kissing him.
Steve presses a quiet and intimate, “I love you so much,” to Tony’s lips for his ears alone, and Tony whispers the words back, his voice thick with tears as he smiles. They’re
By the time playoffs roll around, everyone is abuzz with excitement and the halls are decked in blue and red. The whole student body always attends the first finals game. It's just one of those things and even Tony isn't immune to such a stupid tradition, not when Loki is dragging him bodily along.
After the weekend, rumors start traveling through the school like wildfire, not that Tony has been paying attention in particular. He still hears about it because that's all anyone would talk about for all of Monday.
, he reminds himself. They must always be moving forward. There is little point in dwelling on the foregone past.
“Nope, and Happy has the night off. We might even have to take the subway,” Natasha replies cheerfully.
Steve immediately drops his hands as though burned, and he looks as if Tony just slapped him, his eyes wide and pained. But he still doesn't budge.
Rhodey coughs lightly, bringing their attention back to him and Tony watches as a knowing grin spreads across his best friend's face. “Do I even need to ask if you’ll take each other to be your lawfully wedded spouses?”
Pepper sighs against his neck and tightens the hold of her arms. “If it wasn't for Steve, I would be very very mad at you,” she says.
Tony knows intellectually this is all brought on by simple adrenaline, it's meaningless, but the desire burns firebright through his veins and he doesn't want to stop. His mouth opens against Steve's, and he can feel the warmth of Steve's tongue sliding against his own, hot and slick. The rest of the stadium fades away until it feels like it's just the two of them. He's floating, weightless in Steve's arms and all he knows is Steve Steve
“Heya Steve,” the man says and nods a greeting at Tony, politely not saying anything about the tabloids at the front of his store splashed with Tony's face and family business. “Long time no see.”
Years ago, they could have probably been more than what they are now: distant acquaintances at most, and perfect strangers on the best of days. But that time has long passed. Yet, Steve still sneaks Tony all of these strange looks when he doesn’t think Tony is looking that make the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.
“Yes, but he also doesn’t know that 9/11 happened, or that we have cell phones, or who Justin Bieber is. He
“But aren’t you worried about being overwhelmed? Or recognized? We all have fakes, we can’t get into discreet or nice places.” Tony could feel how weird it was for him to argue against going to a bar, but for some reason he did not want Steve hanging out with Natasha, even – especially – with him around.
Tony turned to go, but Steve grabbed his wrist. “You’re gonna come home tonight,” he said. “You don’t know what that guy wants with you.”
“Hey, are you listening to me?” Bruce said the Thursday before Steve Rogers was getting delivered to MIT.
“Jarvis, can you put those bags somewhere and see if Steve needs anything before we go? Tony, I’d like a word with you in the hall.”
Steve kissed Tony again, urgent and wanting, and wedged his knee between Tony’s legs. The contact made Tony gasp. He gripped Steve’s waist and rolled his hips against Steve’s. Steve grunted and pulled away to kiss a line from Tony’s jaw down his neck. Tony moaned – how could he not, with Captain America on top of him? – and bucked his hips against Steve’s again. He let go of Steve’s waist to run his hands under Steve’s shirt. He pressed his fingers into Steve’s sides, relishing this little bit of contact.
Tony wanted the real college experience, but he couldn’t imagine having to share a room with someone, especially a room as small as the dorm rooms at school. After spending over a year puttering around his family home mostly alone (Nick worked a lot), the idea of sharing space seemed so foreign. Having to account for the other person’s space and schedule and weird habits sounded incredibly unappealing. But MIT practically required that freshmen and sophomores have roommates, so when Nick suggested that he could get Tony out of having a roommate as a freshman, Tony sucked it up and abandoned his usual policy of avoiding family perks. Just this once.
The bouncer shook his hand silently and opened the door without checking anyone’s IDs. Tony smirked.
“No problem.” Tony walked over to Steve and tied his tie for him. He went slowly, just so he could be close to Steve for a little while. God, he annoyed himself. “Thanks again for coming to this.”
Tony tossed his phone onto his desk. It was so inconvenient having a friend as perceptive as Bruce. But then, it was also inconvenient having a roommate as hot as Steve.
“And who knows,” Steve said, a hint of humor in his voice that made Tony swoon, “maybe if we’re there long enough, you will get some of those embarrassing anecdotes.”
“Um. Never mind.” This was gonna be harder than Tony thought. “Do you like diners? We could go grab breakfast. I can show you around Boston a little bit. You can share some of those embarrassing anecdotes I asked about.”
“You know no one’s going to quiz you tonight,” Tony said as he pulled his suit jacket on on Friday night.
Tony rolled his eyes. He hated when Steve said they were friends. Friends didn’t spend every night in each other’s arms or walk on eggshells when it came to the status of their relationship. Friends didn’t admit that they liked each other and then decide to do nothing about it. He hated Steve for minimizing the complications that existed between them, the complications that Steve created.
Finally, around 10 am, Tony got a text that said “1 min.” Tony already knew they were approaching; he could hear the news helicopters that were idling above MIT, and he could see the confused groups of students hanging out outside of his building. He checked himself one more time in the mirror- okay, not bad- and took in a deep breath.
follows him through eleven years, five attempts at enlistment, and a week at Camp Leigh before the binding finally gives up the ghost.
knows Steve loved them, whoever they are, and that they should move on but he just—can’t. Can’t get the words out, not before they put Peggy on and then it takes everything he has not to start crying.
that Steve’s never heard of. He knows better than to make a face about it, but something must have given him away because Mr. Kohn is laughing and explaining. “It’s poetry. Call it a hunch, and if you don’t like it you can trade it for something else.”
“Steve, then.” Stark nods absentmindedly, and Steve sets his shoulders in a tight line. He takes a deep breath and tells himself to be brave. “Do you have any siblings?” he asks, because he needs to know.
for all of a month before he notices that the flinch it causes is less a Tony-is-annoying-and-I-wish-he’d-shut-up flinch and more a deep-seated-emotional-wound flinch.
Steve jolts to sit up, the movement sudden enough that all the blood goes rushing to his head and he is suddenly, wretchedly dizzy—like he hasn’t been since before the serum. The last he knew he was expecting to be dead, and yet here he was—and surely heaven wouldn’t
He watches as Captain America looks from his helmet to his gauntlets—no doubt the armor is baffling if you don’t remember any technology past the forties—to Tony’s face. Rogers squints, and then calls him by his father’s name.
He watches her leave until the elevator doors close. “I should get her one of those Uncle Sam posters, just Pep glaring and
“Thank you,” Pepper says, then turns to say goodbye to Steve and remind Tony about that paperwork he still hasn’t signed. He’ll do it in triplicate and send some Jimmy Choos to apologize.
“I’ll just file a request for one, won’t I,” Steve says, the grin spreading over his face taking all the sarcastic bite out of his response. Bucky shoves at his shoulder and Steve lets himself roll with the movement, like he would’ve when they were both in Brooklyn and a lot younger than they are now.
Steve stumbles through the first few seconds, but then it’s like he’s drawn himself together, pulled up the bull-headed bravery that’s so worrying when they’re fighting, and Tony understands that whatever he’s come to say hadn’t been easy.
He sets his shoulders. If Mr. Kohn thinks less of him for what he’s about to imply, well, he’ll find some other source of books. “Only I think it’s a bit of bull that all of a sudden Watson’s got some gal’s name on him.”
Tony absolutely does not nearly burn himself in surprise. “Why is it that every conversation we have is about something I don’t want to talk about?”
“Take her dancing for me, Peg.” He says, the words falling out in a rush. The icy blue stretch of water below him rises up in a surge of inevitability. “Tell her Steve Rogers says hello, and take her dancing.”
It takes him less than a minute to figure out he’s not the only one awake. But then, Rogers was kind enough to turn on a side-lamp in the living room for Tony’s night-vision to dilate around. He stares at the back of Roger’s head for a long moment, thinking. About turning around and going back to bed, about locking himself in the workshop and building a projectile that spits goo, about the shimmer of blonde hair in lamplight, the burn of sand and fire and ice, that telling little flinch.
“Anything feel unusual?” the doctor asks, after poking his joints and taking his pulse and measuring, of all things, his blood pressure. Steve shoots him an incredulous look. “Anything unexpected, at least,” the doctor amends.
He knows better. And he doesn’t like to think about what it might mean, that he was always going to end up here. It says things about choice and identity that he doesn’t want to believe.
They put him on a cot in medical and he sits there, for what could have been minutes or hours, furling and unfurling his fingers. His hands aren’t that much different than before—they’d always been a little over-large for his body, like great fins screwed on to too-small arms. They’re steadier now, and he’s got far better aim—though that might just be that he can finally really
