After that, it was chaos. Cas and Dean were running around the room, smacking each other with pillows as hard as they could, all while roaring with laughter and trying not to trip over the bed or slip on the sheets as they scurried around the room. The two grown men were acting like a couple of children at a sleepover party, and neither of them could remember the last time they had this much genuine fun.
As much as Dean didn’t want to form attachments in a place where life had no meaning, being around Benny gave him the smallest fragments of hope. It was the small things, like Benny’s constant declarations of “after the war…” that made Dean feel like there might be something after the camps. Maybe he would make it home; home to his family, home to Cas. Each morning, Dean woke up with these feelings of hope, and each day, they were totally crushed by the everyday life that was Buchenwald Concentration Camp.
If Alastair had had a good day, he would likely have Dean under the table during dinner, warming Alastair’s cock in his mouth as he ate. When Alastair had finished his meal, Dean would be expected to finish Alastair off with his mouth, blowing him as best he could. If Alastair had had a bad day, however, he was prone to bending Dean over the kitchen table as soon as he came home, fucking him roughly and without preamble until Alastair climaxed.
Despite his determination not to, Cas found himself incapable of keeping his mind off Dean all day. Wanting to return to the man as quickly as possible, Cas began closing up earlier than usual and was out the door as the clock struck seven.
Even once Cas had gotten back on his feet, he didn't contact Balthazar. The British man was too much of a reminder of what once was. Besides that, Cas knew Balthazar would have questions; questions that Cas didn't want to answer. Cas didn't really want to talk about Dean anymore.
Huffing a little in mock protest, Dean sassed, “I don’t begrudge it. But it seems like Jack’s getting more of your attention than me.”
“Please Cas,” begged Dean. He couldn’t believe what a needy mess he had become. Dean had never considered himself a passive participant in any sexual encounter. Even when being ridden by a woman, he supported and assisted, ensuring they reached their climax before he did. Consideration of his partner was paramount in his mind. But every rational thought disappeared as Cas touched his nipple again, kissed and then gently thrust against him.
“You’re right,” said Dean.  “Cas’s hands, they’re forming sign letters.  A and L.  He’s telling me who took him.”
“Good.  I like him too.”   Dean drove them back home in silence.   There were just too many thoughts going around in his mind.   So much crap had happened to Castiel, and now being physically attacked.   Dean knew their time Lawrence was limited to few remaining months remaining of the school year.  What would happen to Castiel when Dean wasn’t around to help him?   He could get beaten up again, or worse.   Dean wasn’t sure what he could do to help him, but he would certainly try.
“Well if we ignore stumbling across Gabe’s naked actor friends, I …. um, a few solo moments in the shower.”
After years of travel on the road with his father and brother, Dean had established quite early on methods of dealing with not being alone when he awoke. Depending on whether he was with his family, or woken unexpected by a monster, the responses varied between requesting 5 more minutes, or responding with violence. Later, as Dean spent nights away, picking up chicks in bars and going back to their place, he had developed new habits to deal with the embarrassing "morning after". The first and preferred option was easy - to not be there. This was not normally difficult – he was not the cuddling type, therefore it was easy to grab clothes and make a discrete exit whilst his partner was asleep. Years of one night stands had trained Dean to understand the deep REM sleep pattern and make his get away whilst his partner slept. The second option when sex had continued far into the night to make even a couple of hours sleep equal a 6am start, was to brazen it out, with a token, "give me your number, yes, I'll see you again", only to disappear over the horizon as soon as possible.
The red Converse high tops gave a pop of colour against black jeans.   Dean had paired a plain black T-shirt this time with the black jeans, and a plaid red/black overshirt.  An embossed belt with silver studs and buckle completed the outfit.
Strippers exposed far more flesh than Castiel was currently showing, and Dean hadn’t felt affected by them, as much as he was affected by this.  Dean felt his heart beat speed up, his mouth go dry and he was fairly sure several pints of blood had rushed southwards, causing an uncomfortable tightness in his jeans.
Gabriel opened the bag and tipped the contents onto the coffee table.   It was a collection of the various bracelets and a couple of leather necklaces.
Dean glanced at him.  He felt there was an undercurrent to Gabriel’s words.  “I understand.”    He hoped Gabriel picked up his intent.
Out of reflex Dean also looked at Cas, and blinked rapidly, "Wow there Cas. God was mighty generous with you. Trust me no one will ever call you deficient." He shook his head slightly, "I can't believe I am having this conversation with you."
The journey to the hospital didn’t take long, but Dean had a few more contractions along the way, during which he gripped the interior door handle of the car and gritted his teeth.
He was just adjusting the laces on a pair of Converse high tops when Noah knocked the door.   “I’ve brought you some bracelets and things that I thought you might like to try with the more casual outfits.”
Both boys were willing to share their schoolwork with Dean, which helped him quickly catch up on the syllabus.  Every school was different, and Dean had been frustrated that they were covering work that he had already done elsewhere, but he also found that he was missing huge chunks of other things.  Between them they managed to fill in a few gaps, and quickly became friends.
Apart from the occasional moan of pleasure about the quality of the burger, they ate in silence until Dean eventually sat back and wiped his mouth on a napkin.  “Look, about the money, it doesn’t make a difference to me.  You’re my friend.  You’re helping Sammy.  Guess I am surprised.  But also happy for you.”
Castiel took a deep breath and tried to calm himself.  “Everything I said about my parents was true.   I was an emancipated minor, at the age of 15.  I’ve been living with Gabriel since then.   But my grandparents died when I was five, and they left each grandchild a trust fund.  A large one.  But with the situation I was in, I was able to get certain access rights a bit earlier than normal.  Which annoyed my parents and most of my siblings even more.   There’s an independent lawyer that controls the fund. I cannot access any of the capital until I am 25.  I have a prior agreement for certain expenses, like medical, education, rent, food, and clothing which as long as I stick too, there are no issues.  I also get a small general spending allowance for day to day stuff.    If I need something out of the ordinary, I can apply to the lawyer for specific approval.  I can’t go and buy a Tesla, but as long as I can demonstrate that the cost is reasonable, and not for drink or drugs, he signs it off.”
“Nonsense,” said Gabriel.  “You aren’t imposing at all.  You guys stay here and distract Cassie for a bit.”
A tiny smirk appeared on Castiel’s face, and he sat down.   Benny and Lee looked confused at the exchange between the two but realised that some kind of unspoken conversation had just taken place.
“Shush child,” said Ma, not allowing him to complain. “It’s no bother. It’s Room 3, Castiel knows the way.”
Castiel knelt so he was eye level with Dean. “Dean. There was only one room available. I will take the blanket and, with your permission, I will sleep in your car.”
On his way through the halls of the bunker as he headed to the kitchen, out of habit he stopped by the door of Sam’s room and heard the rhythmic snoring of his brother, indicating deep sleep. He smiled fondly and moved on.
Dean was so close, he wasn’t sure how he hadn’t cum already.   “Gonna cum on my cock, Angel?  Let me see you cum.”
Dean twisted pulling Castiel with him so they both lay on their sides, facing each other, still touching, kissing and caressing.
“Yeah, well your boyfriend is stronger than he looks,” said Benny dryly, rubbing his shoulder.  “He refused to go until he knew you were OK.  Stubborn SOB.”
Dean tried to complain about that. He wanted to see Jack. But the Doctor was adamant. Dean’s surgery had gone well, but he didn’t want Dean moving too much and opening up the internal stitching. Doctor Taylor had reassured him that despite the complications during Jack’s birth, Dean would be able to have more pups if he wanted. Dean had looked at him with utter contempt and declared that “this was never happening again”. Doctor Taylor had just smiled and said a lot of people said that but went on to have further pregnancies. Sam had just smirked, and then looked horrified as the Doctor proceeded to tell Sam that Dean should refrain from sex for at least 4 weeks.
Dean turned in surprise to see Castiel standing there.   He was clearly wary of approaching them, and he kept his satchel clutched to his chest for protection.
When they arrived at Gabriel’s, both Sam and Gabe were sitting on the front step waiting for them.   Although Castiel’s phone call home had reassured Gabriel that all was well, until he saw Castiel with his own eyes, he wouldn’t believe it.  Sam was also anxious and looked worried when he saw the police car with them.
Rowena and Gabriel had added to their family too.  Their second child, Anna, was a month younger than their twins. This time in the hospital, to Gabriel and Castiel's relief. All the children got on well together and frequently had sleepovers at each other’s houses to give their tired parents a break.  The older ones, sleeping tangled together in a huge puppy pile, the babies nearby in a cot to benefit from their collective scents.
Dean kissed and nipped at Castiel’s neck, as he reached down sliding his fingers through the soft hair of Castiel’s groin, and took a grip of Castiel’s cock at the base.  He didn’t move initially, just gently holding it, until he felt it begin to swell in his hand.  “Do you like that?”
Missouri tapped out a few notes on her computer, updating Dean’s records, and making a note for her report to the court. She quickly prepared the injection as Dean took off his long sleeved shirt, and hiked up the sleeve of his T-shirt to give Missouri space. Sam pulled a face at him. It was evident that he didn’t like needles.
Feeling pleased with himself that his Omega was satisfied and blissed out and well looked after, Castiel pulled Dean closer, and nuzzled into his scent gland, enjoying Dean’s warm contented warm apple pie smell. “Love you too, Omega mine. Get some rest why you can. I’ll watch over you.”
“You exhausting yourself working isn’t going to help your pup,” said Missouri. “Do you have your hospital bag already packed?”
“Oh yeah,” said Lee.   “I think I saw the film with my sister a few years ago.  Charles Dance was in it.”
John grimaced.   “We’ve only been in town a week, but I’ve already heard stories from people.  Richer than Croesus, and more powerful than the Corleone’s.”
“Doctor gave him the all clear for light exercise yesterday evening,” said Gabriel, taking the corners a little faster than was perhaps wise, as he drove to the hospital.
I'm still very new to AO3, and not used to tagging.   If you think there is something that should be tagged, please don't hesitate to let me know.
His face turning to ashen grey, Castiel turned away from John and Sam.  He felt a cold shiver run over his body, and the pizza that he’d eaten earlier was threating to violently reappear.
“Well, hello there, brother mine,” said Gabriel happily. “I’d like to say you’re looking good. But you really aren’t.”
Soon they were both hard, and Dean could feel Castiel against him.  “May I take you again, Angel?” Dean asked as he stroked his hand across Castiel’s chest, deliberately brushing against Castiel’s nipples.
Eventually they had agreed to watch the second Indiana Jones movie, but Sam seemed unable to sit still for more than five minutes.  Castiel wasn’t sure what was worrying Sam, but the younger Winchester had checked his phone at least a dozen times in the last hour, and when Castiel had asked a question about the movie they were watching, Sam had to ask him to repeat the question.
“Exactly how do you survive doing your job, if the sight of what was a fairly chaste kiss has you uncomfortable,” teased Dean.
Castiel pulled out his phone. “Still no phone signal. “Do you know where we are? I want to put a pin on the map so I can find my bike again tomorrow. I don’t know this area.”
Sam took a seat in the chair on the other side of Dean, out of the way. “Anything I can do to help?”
“I don’t think I introduced you guys properly this morning,” said Dean.  “Do you know Benny and Lee?”
It turned out that student librarian Cas was beyond shy.  It had taken three coffee shop dates before Cas let Dean hold his hand.   A further two dates before they had kissed.  They talked a lot about books, and their studies, but often just ended up staring at each over across the table.   It had taken two months of them dating before Cas agreed to visit’s Dean’s flat for movie night where they had sat on the sofa, with Cas curled up against Dean’s chest, as they watched Star Wars, Dean’s hand carding through Cas’s hair for the entire evening.  That continued for another month, with gentle cuddles and chaste goodnight kisses.
Dean played with a loose thread on the blanket trying to think of how to put into words something he hadn’t fully analysed himself.  “I offered to be his friend because it looked like he needed one.   And he didn’t even want that.”  Dean hesitated, “You know Sam and I will be leaving soon.   Dad said we’d be here til school finishes, and then we’re gonna hit the road again.  I didn’t want to start something… I mean… I thought I could just be his friend you know, and it wouldn’t hurt so much when I left.”
Cas had never caved to the antisemitism of Nazi Germany. Perhaps it was his strong sense of justice, or simply his stubbornness, but Cas remained friends with Jews well into the war. He didn't ban Jews from his bakery despite most other establishments doing so. It was, of course, a risky move. And maybe he lost some customers because of it, but he hadn’t been arrested yet. Cas considered that a win.
When Castiel winced once too often for Dean’s liking, Dean made him sit down, and let him watch as Sam and Dean sparred with each other.   Dean was stronger, but Sam was lighter and very quick on his feet.
“And I’m Jess. Also single.” Jess stayed watching the outputs on the monitor, but trying to give Dean some privacy with his pup.
Falling into each other’s arms they hugged as though they needed each other to breathe.  Eventually they let go of each other, and instead pulled back to stare into each other’s eyes, before Dean kissed Castiel on his forehead and broke the connection.    Dean started the car, and Castiel let his hand rest on Dean’s leg, as they began their journey home.
Breaking apart, Dean signed to Cas the word ‘promise’, and Castiel signed it back.  It was Dean’s way of confirming to Castiel that he would come back to him, and Castiel acknowledging it.    Dean turned and saw his Dad watching them with a small smile on his face.   Dean blushed.
“I think I was given the gist of the story,” Gabriel looked at Dean and smiled.  “Cassie was a bit vague on some of the details.  Although I really liked the part about Dean-o asking Sam to babysitting him.”
They met Gabriel in the driveway at the house.   Gabriel was on his way out to a business meeting with a film distributor and was already running late.   Gabriel jumped into his little Prius, lollipop hanging from his lips, shouted a “be safe” at them, and sped off.  Dean was slightly pleased that Gabriel wouldn’t be around to laugh at Castiel as he was practising.  Learning a new skill took time, and often it didn’t always look that great in the beginning.  Dean hoped that Castiel would have at least a couple of moves to show off when Gabriel got back.
Slowly he reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out his folding knife holding it with two fingers, the rest of his hand making a fist.  Dean turned to throw that down to the ditch as well.  Unseen by Alistair, Dean also threw a handful bullets that he’d concealed in his fist over towards the blowtorch.   He was reasonably sure at least a couple had hit the pan.
“Jeeze, Cas, I’m sorry,” said Dean full of concern.  He started to withdraw, but Castiel grabbed his hands stopping Dean from moving.
“Oh honey. I know you’re worried. I can promise you, we’re all doing everything we can to keep you and your pup safe,” she said. “You’re doing so well.” Missouri saw Sam reach for a bottle of water for Dean. “Do me a favour, and just rinse your mouth and spit it out. Don’t drink it down.” She saw the look on Dean’s face. “Trust me.”
“Well, you are very welcome here. I’m Mrs Frampton, but everyone calls me Ma,” Ma said with authority. “Now, Castiel tells me you haven’t eaten this evening. So, you two go up and get yourselves sorted, and I will bring you up some hot chocolate and sandwiches.”
Dean stood behind him, easing the jacket over Castiel’s arms and shoulders.  Dean then turned him round and smoothed the jacket down, tugging it at the hem to get it to lie flat.  Dean reached up and before Castiel could stop him, ruffled Castiel’s hair, messing up the carefully combed and contained style.   “We should get your hair done properly later,” stated Dean, before standing behind him again and gently pulling Castiel’s shoulders back a little, making him stand taller, and broader.  Taking a final look, Dean nodded with satisfaction.   “I’ve seen you run.   You don’t run slouched, so don’t stand slouched.  Walk tall, like you own the place.  Fake it to you make it.”
“Oh that’s nice,” said Castiel picking up the wide leather bracelet with the pressed studs he had admired earlier.  “I liked that one.
Lifting the gown, she checked Dean quickly, and then moved to his abdomen, and gently pressed against it, checking the position of Jack.
Laid out on one the benches in the room, were 2 handguns.   Both 9mm Ruger handguns.  There was also a box of ammunition, and one spare magazine clip.  “I called in a favour from my neighbour, and borrowed his gun,” said Gabriel handing Dean back his phone.  Gabriel was pale.  “I don’t know how good it is.”
Dean turned to look at the boy that had spoken, “Might have known you’d be here Gordon.  What’s up Alistair, need backup?  Do you only feel brave when you have an audience?  Or is planting trip wires more your thing?”
“I will get an update for you, as soon as we are done here,” Doctor Taylor said. “You are my priority right now.”
Dean was at the library with Sam when his phone rang.   Apologising to the librarian, he quickly accepted the call, and dashed outside to take the call in the carpark.   “Cas,” he said quickly.
Dean suddenly grabbed Castiel by the hips and pushed him away, panting heavily.   “Woah.  Just give me a moment.”
“Hello there. I’m Alexis, one of the nurses on duty tonight. Is this your Alpha? Do you want him to stay with you?” Alexis asked, slightly intimidated by Sam’s tall stature.
Castiel wanted to pull Dean into his arms, but with his hands already full of Jack, he contented himself with just being in his presence. “I suppose we should talk about the future.”
Cas could see the confusion on Dean's face, Dean still wasn't getting it. "Dean, may I kiss you?" he asked, his voice if anything deeper than usual.
“But I also know, that I am going to be away for a week, where I won’t be around to keep a check on you,” continued John.
Dean tensed slightly, and then relaxed. "I think you have the right to ask me anything," he replied honestly.
“Dude, don’t call me that.  Makes me sound like a frigging girl,” huffed Dean, accepting Benny’s hand to be hauled to his feet.
“I am not, not a fan,” said Castiel carefully.   “It’s more about the song, rather than a band.   I frequently hear a song, but couldn’t tell you who performed it, or what else they did.”
Saying goodnight at the door was difficult for both Dean and Castiel. Especially with Sam waiting on the outside for Dean, and Gabriel standing smirking on the inside.  Everything stayed at the PG13 level, much to their frustration.
Castiel put his arm around Dean’s waist as they walked back to the hotel.  They walked quietly upstairs to their room, snatching quick glances at each other.
Benny made a noise of affirmation around his large mouthful of food. Benny ate like every meal might be his last, which, Cas supposed, made sense after the horrors that he had gone through. Benny, like all the others that Cas had seen in the camp throughout the day, was still sickly thin but seemed to be slowly returning to his normal weight. Benny swallowed and answered, “Yeah, they’re all back in the USSR, but I can’t get to them. They don’t know I’m alive and I don’t have the money to go back there.”
“I was actually also talking to Balthazar this week,” Dean began, “and he mentioned that there is a safe house a few miles away that I can go to if I choose—”
Feeling better, and now giggling a bit himself, Dean let Cas lead him into the living room. They sat on the couch, Cas’ head in Dean’s lap. Cas smiled up at Dean, seeing the other man upside down. His freckles were especially prominent at this angle. “Read to me?”
Cas waved him off, the very idea seeming ridiculous. His brother backed off of the topic for the rest of their visit, not mentioning it again. Cas was grateful. It had been years since Dean had left, and Cas was just beginning to heal. He didn’t need Gabriel ripping the scab off, reopening the wound that had pained him for so long.
Nothing had changed between them, and yet everything had changed. Cas knew there was no turning back from this. Dean was there to stay.
I stumble into the main room, my head still fuzzy from the night before. Cas is already there, standing in the kitchen area. “Good morning,” he greets me cheerfully with a chaste kiss, holding out a steaming mug of coffee. God bless boyfriends.
“Because I'm a burden and I'm not worth anyone's time or effort,” Dean recited, as if the words were a lesson he had memorized for school. Cas’ heart, already broken, was torn to pieces as he saw how Dean actually believed the words he was saying.
Dean bent down to kiss Cas again, making sure to rub his erection against Cas’ stomach as he did so. “I want this,” he whispered as he pulled away. “I really, really,
Cas wished there was more he could do to help the people the Nazis were persecuting. As a closeted homosexual man himself, he empathized with the struggles that German homosexuals were facing. It was a large part of the reason Cas had joined the resistance in the first place.
This wasn’t a sudden decision; Dean had been thinking about it for a while now. He didn’t want to leave Cas. Nothing and nobody had ever made him feel as comfortable and loved as Cas did. The thought of living without the man, even temporarily, devastated Dean. But that was why he needed to go.
Cas spoke next, clearing his throat awkwardly. “This is my baker, sir. She’s the one who made the delicious
Benny scoffed. “Nah, I don’t care about that. We’re in this together, you and me, till the very end.”
Cas picked up his hat and tan trenchcoat from the stand by the door and walked outside, locking the front door behind him before beginning his short trek to work.
“How could you?! I trusted you!” Cas screamed at his cousin, slapping him across the face. Lucifer recoiled, his hand finding his cheek as Cas continued to yell. “You dirty, disgusting joke of a man! I’m your family! You promised you would keep him safe!”
Dean was walking through the streets of Leipzig one warm night, following the directions he had been given to his next safe house. Dean made sure to travel only at night as to minimize the number of people with whom he interacted. He kept his head down and walked, when possible, through alleyways and on streets cloaked in darkness, trying to look as inconspicuous as he could.
Cas continued to suck Dean off, bringing him right to the edge of completion over and over. Each time Dean got close, Cas would pull off, loosely stroking Dean’s cock as he rose to place soft kisses all over his body.
“I believe it is the latter,” said Castiel.  “Fortunately Jack seems to temper Michael and Anna’s enthusiasm.”
Castiel took a look at himself in the mirror.  He almost didn’t recognise himself.   He looked so different from the Castiel he saw every day looking from his bathroom mirror.  This ‘new’ Castiel looked confident and bit of a badass.  The leather boots with small details of metal in the design added an extra inch or so to his already not inconsiderable height and complimented the black leather jacket.  The jacket was more vintage cool motorcycle/bomber jacket styling with a stand-up collar, rather than the Classic biker style with fold back lapels.  The Henley was smooth across his chest and clung enough to just give a hint of his strong abdominal muscles.   The plaid shirt and jacket hid most of the view, but Castiel knew he would look good without the jacket too.  But his hair – he had no idea that just changing his hair would make such a difference.  If he hadn’t known better himself, he would have thought that he’d just rolled out of bed.
“Probably learnt to run to get away from the bullies,” said Dean.   “I’ve been to a lot of schools, but I’ve never known a pack like those here.”  Dean watched as Castiel did some cool down stretches.
Alistair leaned nonchalantly against the door of the van and used the knife to clean his fingernails.   “Hello Dean.  You got my message then?”
“We keep it quiet, because Cassie was technically still a minor, when he first came to live with me,” said Gabriel.  “I’m less worried now he’s 18, but I don’t plan on advertising what I do with the neighbours.”
Internally Dean cringed at Castiel’s continued belief that people wouldn’t or shouldn’t be seen with him.   “What about if we drove out of town?  To say, Topeka?   It’s not so far to be unreasonable, but far enough that we’re unlikely to see anyone that knows you.  Stuff will be cheaper in the Mall too.”
“I am rusty.” Cas pulled on a pair of sweatpants, and a t-shirt. When he had previously been almost naked and exposed he seemed confident, now clothed, he looked embarrassed. “You are not seeing me at my best.”
Thanks so much to Breezeranger and Sailor_fujoshi (Who is the only reason Cas is wearing scrubs in this!   I had him shirtless!)
"Uh huh," said Cas trying and failing to stop Dean from gently moving in a very enticing way up and down his body. Realising Dean had slowed down of his own volition, "Anything," said Cas. "I agree to anything and everything you want."
Looking over at Dean, John released Sam, and pulled Dean into a back-slapping hug.  “How are you doing, son?”
Castiel gasped and rapidly removed the elasticated bracelet.  “Oh my god.  I am never leaving the house again.”
Castiel turned carefully and let Dean reach down and finger him again, and soon that pleasant feeling of fullness, of something he couldn’t quite express in words returned.    Adding yet another finger drew a loud groan from Castiel.
Dean had prewarned his Dad that on the final Friday of their exams, he would be out all Friday night.   John nodded thoughtfully but said nothing.   Dean wasn’t sure if no comment was better than being lectured.
To all intents and purposes, Benny and Lee were just shooting the breeze, and getting some fresh air.   They deliberately pitched their conversation at a fraction below their normal level, but still audible to anyone eavesdropping.  They heard scuffling, but didn’t actually see anyone, although the smell of cigarette smoke was overwhelming.
Wiping his hand over his face, he refused to give in to the rising tide of emptiness that he felt. Nothing about today had been good, this was yet another bad day in several long months of bad days. Dean tried to be grateful that it was only rain lashing the car, and not the freezing snow the weather forecasters had predicted for early December.
Dean had already moved over to Jack’s incubator, and was looking down at him, as though checking he was still there. “He’s so much stronger, but still looks tiny.”
“I understand a little sign language.  There was a deaf lady in our congregation when I was younger.  I tried to learn a bit for her,” said Castiel. “But I think you may have modified some of the gestures.
Nodding, Castiel pulled himself together and started to walk North towards a set of classrooms.   “Them and about 95% of the school.   I said you wouldn’t want to associate with me.”   He indicated the room in front of them, “This is the physics lab.”  He strode inside, effectively ending any further conversation, not giving Dean a chance to respond.
Back in the room he picked up Dean’s note again. Ma had said that Dean said he was sorry. The note didn’t make it sound like he was sorry for last night, so maybe he was sorry for leaving?
Thanks again to everyone who has taken the time to comment.  I promise I read and reply to everyone.
People were moving out of Castiel’s path, like the parting of the Red Sea.   When he reached Dean, he stopped directly in front of him.  “Hello Dean.”
“Me thinks he doth protest too much,” said Gabriel heading back to the kitchen.  “Come on let’s get our little Cassie to bed.”
Cas could hear Dean's ragged breathing and smiled happily to himself. He waited a few moments for Dean to gain enough strength to stand on his own again, before using the sponge to tenderly clean his groin and legs.
After an hour of cleaning, Dean felt that Jack’s room was as ready as it would ever be, and he wandered to his kitchen for a drink of water. Grabbing a bottle from the fridge, he grimaced as he saw that a ring of sticky something was marking the shelf on the door. Sighing, he made quick work of emptying the fridge and washing everything down with sterilising cleaner, before putting everything back neatly.
Hearing the tremor in Gabriel’s voice, Dean wanted to reassure him, but there was nothing good to say.   “It’s bad.”  Dean ended the call.  He turned to Benny, “They sent a time and place.  I got a little over 40 minutes to find a way to save Cas.”   Dean held up the phone, showing him the picture of Castiel.  “Ignore Cas for a second.  Tell me what you see.”
Glad he hadn’t kept the gun now, Dean removed his jacket and laid it on the trunk of the Impala.    He then untucked his shirt and T-shirt, lifted them to show his torso and completed a slow turn to reveal his back to show Alistair he didn’t have anything concealed.  “Like what you see?” Dean quipped before returning to face forward.
Sam thought it would be a great adventure to spend time at the house and spent a lot of time discussing film making (the non porn kind), film production and camera work with Gabriel.  The fledging lawyer in him was also fascinated by the detailed contracts that Gabriel used, and begged him to let him read a few blank templates.
For Dean everything seemed to be moving both too fast and too slow. He could feel every small movement that Cas made. Making every nerve ending in his body scream out for attention. He could feel his excitement building as each second past, each second feeling like a lifetime as Cas rubbed and stroked against him. He could feel the pressure building within him, he was so close to breaking. “Cas, please, so close.” Dean didn’t even realise he was gripping Cas’s hips.
Castiel cut him off decisively by handing over a credit card, surprising Noah who had been looking at Dean expectantly.   “No. I like the items, we’re getting them.”
“No way! I can’t believe it, the one time I’m out of town. Are you OK? Is he OK?” questioned Charlie anxiously.
“Finally!” yelled Sam, Lee and Benny together from where they were still standing with John and Sheriff Mills.
Dean wrapped the pack in the towel, he knew never to put an ice pack directly onto skin, and offered to Castiel.  Castiel took the pack and winced as he applied it to his eye and the side of his face.   The soft cool gel moulding to fit his eye socket and cheekbone.
“You sort that out when you get home,” said Missouri firmly. “And try not to worry, honey. I got a good feeling for you that things will work themselves out.”
Peering through the windscreen, trying to see the road ahead, Dean sighed, wishing he was already home. The weather was abysmal. The intense rain had reduced visibility to almost zero and made the road treacherous. This would have been a dangerous combination at 2pm in the afternoon, but it was 9.30pm on a Friday night. The darkness didn’t just make everything more difficult, it also made it a lot more hazardous.
“Really, ‘cos from where I’m standing, it kinda looks like you do.  I know you two attacked Cas the other week at the library.  Need a team to take on one guy?  You both ran off pretty quick when I arrived.”
Once Dean had managed to open Cas's shirt, he left it on but open, and sat up slightly, to look down on a very rumpled and thoroughly kissed Cas staring up at him. "Hell you're a beautiful sight," said Dean.
Dean was therefore surprised, and secretly thrilled, when after he entered his first class, English Literature, the teacher, an African American man named Mr Henriksen just pointed to a seat in the second row.
“I don’t know why you felt you couldn’t tell me.   I think you know me well enough to know I would have supported you, if you really wanted to do that.”   Dean paced then wiped his eyes, realising that at some point a tear had fallen.   Dean's anger started to dissipate as he ranted.   “I loved you with everything I had.  You knew I was waiting for you to tell me you were ready for more.”  He paused and stared at Cas.  “To see you like that.   So relaxed, so carefree, so confident.   Why did you feel you had to hide that?  Couldn’t you have shown me that side of you?   The last 5 months have been the best of my life.  Spending time with you.  But right now, I feel like I don’t know you at all.”
“No.  You know what it’s like at school.  I just can’t … I don’t want anyone hurt.”  Castiel swallowed hard and blinked back a tear.  “You know what happened to Kevin,” he whispered, “and he was just a friend.”
Another round of cheering and whistles suddenly made them realise that perhaps that type of kiss might be better saved for somewhere more private.
Dean had gasped initially, “you little fucker,” he said breathing a sigh of relief.   “For that I should make you wait.”
Dean was still reeling from the experience.  Looking back, the whole evening felt like he’d been edged several times already, so he wasn’t completely surprised that he’d cum so quickly.   Feeling a little ashamed and embarrassed, he turned to Castiel and burrowed his head in Castiel’s shoulder.  “Um, so, well I guess that happened.”
The feelings that Castiel was producing were beginning to overwhelm Dean.  Fumbling slightly, Dean reached down to touch Castiel’s head, and stroke his fingers through his hair.   “Too good,” he mumbled.  “Cas, please.”
“Way worse,” said Dean angrily.   “The - he could have broken his neck being shoved down the stairs - type stuff.”  Dean stopped walking.
The comments and whispers about Castiel’s new look at school, had tapered off significantly by the end of the week, especially after Benny had practically growled when someone had suggested that Castiel’s new clothes were from a Sugar Daddy.
“Will you need the car?” said Dean anxiously.  He really didn’t want to be without transport in town.
Castiel straighten up slightly, and glanced at Dean, holding himself warily, worried that Dean might react badly. “Yes,” he muttered, looking down at the floor.
Sam had agreed to join in as well.  It never hurt to refresh or practise the skills and working with Dean they should be able to demonstrate the moves a variety of ways for Castiel.
“A…L?   Alistair.”     They were on the front steps of the school now, and Benny grabbed Dean’s arm forcing him to stop.  “Dean!”
I know I keep saying this, but thank you so much to everyone for their lovely comments, predictions and kudos on this story.    Some of you are way to clever - or I am really obvious!
“I’ve never seen you without your clothes on, so I don’t know if you also have freckle next to your nipple,” said Dean cautiously.  He saw Cas blush.  “Oh, you do?”
Dean snorted, slipped the car into drive and pulled away from the kerb.   “He’s hidden for too long.  He shouldn’t have to hide.”
Dean lay back down next to Cas, facing him, their bodies pressing against each other in complete harmony, their cocks gently nestled together. "I trust you, and I hope you trust me. I read up a whole heap of information about this, and I need to know if you're ready to try, and what you want. I have condoms if you want them."
Dean looked down as Castiel looked up from where he was kneeling, and Dean thought he was probably the most wondrous thing he’d ever seen. Castiel’s blue eyes, his strong cheekbones, his plump lips and intimidating jaw line all came together to make Dean weak in Castiel’s presence.  Rational thought seemed beyond reach.   Their mutual eye contact reached epic proportions as Dean cupped Castiel’s cheek and jaw in his hand, drawing Castiel up and himself down until their lips touched.   Dean lost touch with reality as Castiel’s strong arms engulfed him, and he was pushed backwards, and lowered reverently on to his back on the bed.
Many thanks to everyone still reading this story.   I promise it is complete.  I can't believe I have 80 subscribers following this.   I am overwhelmed.
Cas sat down on the edge of the bed, almost as though he was preparing to run at a moment's notice, and nodded his agreement. Dean sighed, and turned to his chest of drawers. He rummaged for a moment before pulling out two sets of boxers and two t shirts. He handed a set wordlessly to Cas, and then pulled on the other set himself. He saw Cas's face fall slightly, but Cas silently obeyed the unspoken request. Dean then pulled a sock out his drawer and walked over to his bedroom door.
Looking up at Dean, Castiel got another full-frontal look at Dean’s body.   Dean’s wasn’t as big or as thick as Castiel, but he was beautifully proportioned, and was already half hard as he stepped, unashamed, out of the bath.  Once he was stable and there was no danger of him slipping, Dean grabbed the towel he dropped earlier and wrapped it around his waist.    He held up another towel for Castiel as he too climbed out of the bath, which Castiel wrapped around him.    Taking another smaller towel, Dean gently patted Castiel’s chest to dry him, before quickly wiping his own, and heading back into the bedroom.
Cas gently reached around Dean and turned the water back on, adjusting the temperature to a more moderate level than the burning level Dean had been using. Cas reached up to the shelf in the shower and brought down a sponge. Wetting it thoroughly he began to gently wash and sponge Dean's shoulders and chest, removing the residual soap from Dean's body. He stopped occasionally to touch and kiss little scars he found as he worked lower.
Tilting his head on one side confused and clearly unsure, he replied “No one’s called me that before.”   Castiel signalled to the door.   “I have to get to my next class.”
The first hint was in the afternoon on the following Monday, when Castiel was unexpected called out of class to go the Principals office.  Castiel gathered his books into his rucksack and after casting Dean an anxious glance left the lesson, following the ‘runner’ that had been sent to fetch him.
Dean waited until Jess went to check on something and he was left alone with Jack. He extracted his phone and took a quick picture of Jack, and then called Charlie, watching carefully in case Sam returned.
But Dean wanted to hide this.   Sitting on his bed, he looked at the magazine cover again.   He couldn’t quite bring himself to look inside the magazine again.   The wording on the cover was minimal.  Apart from the magazine title, “Newcummers”, which Dean thought was a bit on the nose, the only other wording was “Novak – Bares All – Exclusive Special Edition”.   Novak.  Castiel Novak.  Or Cas, as Dean called him.
Jesse spluttered in outrage as several people around him laughed.   Jesse tried to hit Benny, but Benny blocked the punch easily, and just pushed him backwards towards his seat.  “Sit the fuck down and shut up, before I put you down.”
When he returned to their room, Castiel was sitting on the edge of the bed, his own washbag in his hand.   “Um, teeth,” said Castiel, going into the bathroom and locking the door.
“Morning, Angel,” said Dean as he climbed back into bed, lying down next to Castiel.  “Sorry did I wake you?”
Sam confirmed how he’d received a text from Dean.   “Poughkeepsie.  To Gabe.” Poughkeepsie was their drop everything and run code.  Sam had done exactly that.  He’d left school and ran/jogged his way to Gabriel’s house, where Gabriel was waiting for him.
“Dad taught us some battlefield stuff,” Dean muttered.   “Our uncle got …. injured and he had similar issues.”    Dean didn’t want to explain that the injury had actually been caused during a search and rescue mission that had ended up being search, captured, tortured, escape and rescue mission.
Castiel moaned some more and shook his head, blood from a cut above his left eye dripped profusely.   "ooooo, Police.  No… am..lance".
Alistair thumped on the door hard, and the sounds in the cabin stopped immediately.  He took several steps back, standing about ten feet from the cabin, the sneer on his face hidden in the darkness.
Dean looked at his phone.   His home screen was a picture of Cas and Dean together at the Roadhouse, eating burgers.   Cas was looking at Dean like he’d just hung the moon.
Cas turned away, and moved slowly towards a large rock, where he’d left the motorcycle helmet and his clothes. Picking up a towel from the pile, he gently rubbed the sand from his shoulders and back from where he had rolled.
“I’d say that is very likely,” said Benny.  “That means who ever has him is mobile.  Harder to track.”  Zooming out, Benny looked at the photo overall, “Is it me or is Cas doing something odd with his hands?” Benny handed him back the phone.
Zar inclined his head.   “I am half French, half English.  The French accent was an accident one day during filming, and it kind of stuck.”
Thank you to everyone who has left a Kudos or a comment. Seriously, I love hearing what you like and what you think might happen.
“Oh yes. Absolutely,” Dean lied. He bit his lip. “Um, I remembered we left something in the car, I was just going to grab them… it.”
Grinning Dean carefully kept scissoring and stretching Castiel. “I may not have done the same level of research you did, but trust me you’re going to love this bit,” said Dean, and gently reached and stroked Castiel’s prostate before pressing it firmly.
They sat drinking their beers, in silence for the next 30 or so minutes, before John dropped a twenty on the bar and they walked back to the car.
After breakfast Gabriel waved them all away, saying he’d tidy the kitchen, to allow the boys time to pack.
When they arrived back, Dean left Sam to show Castiel some of the Latin books borrowed from their uncle, whilst Dean quickly turned on the oven, set the lasagne he’d prepared the previous day to cook, and set the table.
It took Dean a moment to realise that this was actually happening.  The fantasy he had entertained for years of having Castiel in his bed, of Castiel desiring him, of wanting to be with Dean in the most intimate way.  It felt both right and surreal at the same time.
If the sight of Castiel’s now slightly dishevelled sexy tax accountant appearance hadn’t done Dean in already, that coupled with the deep suggestive voice (that Dean always thought sounded like Castiel had spent a night screaming his name whilst having wild sex) did.   Any concept of rational thought from Dean at this point had disappeared and he continued to stare at Castiel’s untucked shirt.
“True,” said Gabriel.  “So I’ll ignore that, and I will say this.   He seems like a good guy Cassie.   He’s good for you.”
Dean watched carefully as Alistair got out the driver’s side, holding a large hunting knife.  There was no immediate sign of Castiel, but if they had analysed the picture correctly, he was probably tied up in the back.   Dean did a rough calculation of the distance, they were about 40 feet apart, too far to rush.   If there was anyone else in the back of the van, they could kill Castiel before he was even half-way there.
Part of Dean was grateful for the distraction, the other part just wanted to be left alone. Realising that surreptitiously he was being judged by the other parents he shook his head. He’d decided early on that ‘complicated’ didn’t even begin to cover his situation. “I’m widowed.”
Castiel elbowed Azzer in the stomach, causing the knife to graze his side, but Castiel twisted in Azzer’s grip and ran to the left, towards the front of the campervan.  Dean grabbed for a handful of gravel, but it wasn’t gravel he brought up, he had knelt at the exact point he’d hidden one of Gabriel’s kitchen knives.  He grabbed the knife and threw it with complete accuracy at Azzer, hitting him in the thigh.   Azzer, who had been thrown off balance by Castiel, was about to chase him when the knife embedded itself in his leg, causing him to fall screaming to the ground.   As soon as the knife had left his hand, without waiting for it to land, Dean rolled, ducking out of reach, as Alistair slashed at the air where Dean had been.    There was the sound of gun shots from behind the Impala.  The bullets Dean had thrown at the frying pan exploded, causing Alistair to pause momentarily, giving Dean time to get to his feet.   Castiel had run around the campervan, straight into Benny who stepped out from behind a tree, grabbed and dragged him down to the ground, crouching over him with his gun drawn.
"I think at that moment you owned me," said Dean contentedly. "Look, I don't do the whole chick flick thing – I don't know what happens next. I doubt it will be happily ever after, not with our line of work. But I will never stop you from walking out the door, if that is what you want. I will not dictate what happens next in this relationship. But I want to try to try to be happy, and to make you happy. Is that enough for now? Is it enough I 'need' you?"
“Come in Sammy,” said Dean, putting a towel around his waist.  The boys had shared a hotel room for years, and the concept of privacy was a distant memory, but neither went out of their way to make the other uncomfortable.
They exited the car, and Dean glanced around.   “Just to check, given the issues in Lawrence you’ve had.  They aren’t going to have a problem here with us are they?”
“You ass,” grumbled Dean, as he bent to pick up the football.    He gazed past Benny’s shoulder and watched as Castiel slowed his sprint to a gentle jog.
With a resigned sigh, Castiel allowed Gabriel and Dean to help him stand.  Once he was relatively stable, Dean took a firm grip on Castiel’s arm, making a show of closing his eyes in front of Castiel, before Gabriel quickly lowered Castiel’s jogging bottoms and boxers, lifting each foot carefully, and slipping on a pair of clean jersey PJ’s.
“No. I’m OK.” Dean quickly stripped his clothes and stepped into the gown provided. He fastened the cotton ties tightly, and stepped back into the main room.
Dean had figured the next step would be to try to disarm him, and he was prepared for that possibility.   Dean flexed his arm, and the thin blade dropped into his palm.
“Oh no honey,” Missouri reassured him quickly. “The injection would be in you but would benefit Jack. It would help his lungs mature a little more quickly. If your pup comes early, and I gotta be honest, I think he will, it will definitely help him.”
“I really hope that’s Russian for ‘pound me into the mattress Darling’,” Dean said as he rolled his hips against Castiel.
He looked at the handsome face staring back.   Eyes bright and just a hint of a smile on those soft lips.  Dean thumbed the magazine to a random page, opened it and groaned.  Another photo of Cas.  This time standing under a shower head, his muscular back facing the camera, water rivulets tracking their paths across the broad expanse of naked skin down across a bare ass and strong thick thighs.   Dean felt a surge of warmth and an uncomfortable tightness in his jeans.   Glancing around, he sighed in relief as he realised no one was watching.
Alistair took a step forward, but Dean just racked the shotgun and tightened his grip.  The sound was loud and threatening in the quiet woodland.  “Don’t!”   Dean heard the rustle of movement, and out the corner of his eye, saw Benny step forward also holding a shotgun to back Dean up.
Dean’s obstetrician, Dr Moseley, or Missouri, as she insisted on being called, was a lovely motherly figure that Dean felt comfortable with as soon as they had met. She was aware of the court case, and had even waived her charge for providing the fortnightly report for the court.
They sat through the rest of the meal in relative silence, only Sam asking Gabriel questions about his time in California keeping the conversation going.
“Yes Sir,” said Dean.  He’d automatically reached for Castiel’s hand after dealing with the weapons, and seemed surprised to find he still holding on to it.  “I’m good to drive though.”
I'll be posting this chapter and the next one together.  The next chapter is a smutty one, and can be skipped without affecting your understanding of the story.
Gabriel smacked Dean on the arm and started laughing.  “Oh I knew I liked you.  Yes, I directed all 13 films so far.  I’ve even won awards for a couple of them.”
The cabin was quite isolated, and Alistair admitted to himself that Dean had chosen the spot well for secrecy as well as privacy.   There were no other properties around, so no one to hear any of the sounds from the cabin, that now he was closer, were obvious and loud in the silence of the night.
Gabriel had no problem with the boys coming to his place to study and actively encouraged it. But as soon as they walked through the door, they were confined to the lounge, dining room and kitchen.  In true Gabriel style, he announced there would be no ‘hanky panky’ whilst the exams were on.  Dean had just looked embarrassed, while Sam howled with laughter.   Castiel knew Gabriel was doing it for his benefit, and Sam’s, but it didn’t make it any easier.
At his Doctors and Gabriel’s insistence, Castiel stayed home the following week on medical leave.   The situation at school was so hostile anyway, Castiel thought that home was probably safer, and he was able to keep up with work being sent to him on email or via Dean.
“You get some rest Angel,” said Gabriel softly, and patted his foot.   The only bit of Castiel he could reach without bruises, scrapes or bandages.
“Sam and I will be fine.  You’ve watched out for Sam long enough.  You’re a good man Dean, and you deserve a good man.  You need to be here to see if Castiel is that for you.  I’ve spoken to Gabe.  Made arrangements.  I’m only ever a phone call away,” John said with a melancholy smile.
“Will you come to me, Omega mine,” Castiel growled softly, holding out his hand not supporting Jack.
Gabriel hmmm’ed non-committedly as he took Castiel into the lounge area, and carefully lowered him to one of several two-seater sofas.  He inspected the bruising around Castiel's eyes, the split lip, and noticed him cradling his arm protectively across his stomach.    "I guess you're Dean," he said switching his gaze briefly to Dean.
Dean was hopeful that the worst of the situation was now behind them.   It seemed that many teachers were positive about the changes in Castiel, and even a few of the students would occasionally talk to him.
“Can I assume that you are under the impression that I am Castiel?” said the man that looked like Cas but didn't sound like him.
Dean shrugged.   “Honestly, not always.”  He reached down and took Castiel’s hand.   “But I’ll do my best to make sure it is for you.  I have so many things I’d like to show you.”
Dean watched for a moment, just to make sure Sammy reached the doors. Dean knew that Sam needed this. Sam was wicked smart, bordering on genius level, and this was Dean’s big chance to have Sam demonstrate that to his father and school system.    This year more than any other would make a difference.   If Sam did well in the end of year exams he could take those results, and it would boost him through High School.
Castiel gasped loudly, his hips jerked once more, before he came over Dean’s hand in long strands.   Castiel continued to shudder as Dean stroked his cock, milking him through the orgasm, before gently stopping.
Trying to keep track of everything happening in the room was too much effort for Dean. He thought he should at least know who some of these people were, but he was overwhelmed.
Castiel blushed slightly.   “Claire sent me an invitation to her college dance, with specific instructions that I must ‘dance’ with her. For the Father/Daughter dance.”
Unfortunately, the work set for Sam today was well beyond Dean's capability.   After taking a look at the worksheets assigned, Dean conceded, not for the first time, that Sam had definitely exceeded his brother’s knowledge of the subject material.  Dean glanced at the librarian.   Sometimes they would be able to help, especially about English Literature.  But today's homework was Advanced Maths, and Dean had given up trying to help with Sam with maths about two years previously.
The conversation was interrupted however, when a tall stern looking man walked into the cubical like he owned the place and stood imposingly at the end of the bed.
Castiel sat on the back step of the ambulance as they checked him over.   Fortunately, his new injuries were relatively minor, even the cut on the back of his head and the one on his ribs, and they were willing to let him go home.
Thank you for reading. I think there may be another chapter to this story. Gotta let Dean do his research and practice.
"I think he cares for you a lot more than that," said Sam reassuringly. "But are you aware that he has never had been with another man before?"
After paying, by contactless card, Castiel led Dean to a small booth at the back of the shop.   Dean noted that Castiel automatically took the side next to the wall, so he could view the doorway.   Dean had already clocked the large mirror behind, so didn’t mind sitting with his back to the door, he could still see everyone coming in or leaving the shop.
Handing them each a menu, Ryan quickly pointed out the special’s available on the board and asked about drinks.
Dean took a deep breath, the whisky loosening his tongue enough to speak, and looked up into Cas's amazing clear blue eyes and released everything in one go. "Cas, you are way too good for me. I know I will mess this up, like I have messed up everything else in my life. Everyone I have ever loved has either been hurt or killed, and I know I couldn't bear it if that happened to you; I've never been with any man before, and I don't want to screw it up, or not be good enough for you, or hurt you. I think you can do an awful lot better …"
Dean just nodded.  He hadn’t told his dad where he would be last night, and hadn’t said anything when he returned, about where he’d been.
Unfolding himself, Castiel looked up at Sam and Dean amazed faces.  He shrugged, “It’s just practice.  It helps stretch my hamstrings and prevents injuries when running.”
Dean nodded wordlessly, and then staggered slightly as Cas whisked them magically to Dean's bedroom.
Shout out to Sailor_fujoshi and Breezeranger for their Beta skills - thank you both.  Any mistakes that remain are all mine!
Finally, Gabriel could see that the pain meds were kicking in.  Castiel’s eyes began to droop slightly, and the tension in his shoulders relaxed.
Dean had been open about his sexuality with Sam since they had both left home for college.   When Dean had made his big announcement, Sam had just nodded, said “OK”, and told Dean he should keep the noise down.   Apparently, Sam had always suspected Dean was Bisexual, and was just glad that Dean could now be open rather than hide that aspect of his life.
Castiel raised himself above Dean, and slowly began to trail kisses down Dean’s body.   But as he reached Dean’s stomach, Castiel stopped, seemingly unsure.
"Fuck," the man switching from flirtatious to serious in the blink of an eye. He ran to the car and pulled the door open.  "Shit Cassie.  What happened?"
“You’re gonna need balls the size of Brazil to pull it off,” stated Lee.  “That is if Castiel even lets you.”
Regretfully they separated and Dean grabbed his bag and looked around the room.   “This is probably the weirdest place I’ve ever stayed, but it also felt the most like home.”
“Keep my head down.   Don’t start a fight, but if it happens be sure to finish it,” recited the boy wearily.
“Heard you had to borrow one.  Thought you might like your own.”   John walked over to where Dean was standing and rested his hand on the back of Dean’s neck, tipping his head slightly to look into his son’s eyes.    “You’re not a kid anymore.   I’m sorry it took me while to see it.   I am so proud of you, and the man you’ve become.” said John.   There was a tear in John’s eye.  Releasing Dean, John held his hand out to Castiel who shook it in surprise.  “Good luck Cas.  I’ll see you around.”
“Anytime you want some more, feel free,” called Dean, watching them go.  “I need the practice.”  He laughed and turned expecting to see Castiel behind him, but he wasn’t there.   Looking around he realised that Castiel had disappeared.   “Sonofabitch.”  Dean spent the rest of lunch trying to find Castiel, but it was like he was never there.
Zar held his hand out to shake Dean’s again.   “Balthazar Roche, known as Zar to only my closest friends.”
Dean was excited to see Castiel on Monday.  They’d texted on the previous evening to agree what outfit Castiel would wear.   Finally narrowing it down to two, Dean agreed to let Castiel decide on the Monday morning, so it would also be a surprise for Dean.  They had also agreed that Castiel would stop avoiding Dean in school.  Dean had pointed out that Benny and Lee already knew they were friends.   The whole stop hiding or ‘fake it till you make it’ mentality wouldn’t really work if Castiel was avoiding everyone.
“I know I don’t much, but I am fairly sure that sex is supposed to be ‘mutually’ satisfactory,” said Castiel using his fingers to make air quotes.
Dean stood up and hesitated slightly.   “Maybe you should have my number. You know in case you want anything.”   Dean unlocked and handed Cas his mobile phone.   “Put your number in, and I’ll text you so you get mine.”
“S’eep now.  Clean later.”  Castiel’s eyes were closed, and he felt absolutely boneless.  He couldn’t have moved, even if he wanted to.   “Thank you,” he murmured.
“I am,” said the man. “I take chemical blockers though. But I do understand most Omegas would not be comfortable being in a confined space with an unknown Alpha.”
“Hmmmm,” responded Dean, he was only half listening, his brain was taken up with the wonderful feeling of Castiel kneading his leg.
Cas frowned a little, "please don't." Dean hesitated. "You don't need it for courage, not now, not ever. You don't need it to forget, or for the pain, or for the loneliness, or any of the other reasons you use. You are stronger and better than you know."
Backing away quickly he returned to the library, and went to the stereo to turn it off.   He picked up Cas’s phone, and flicked through the playlist, shaking his head.
Dean gently dragged Castiel and positioned him in the centre of the room, where there was a little bit more open space.   “OK.  Keep it simple.   Claire isn’t going to expect a tango, or a formal waltz.”   Dean listened to the song currently playing, an old love song sung by Elvis Presley, and realised that it would end very shortly.   He wasn’t prepared to admit how he knew that – that was between him and Baby’s stereo.   He wasn’t sure what would be next, but took a gamble that it would be similar.   He gently placed Castiel’s right hand on his waist and positioned his left hand on Castiel’s shoulder.  With his right hand he gently gripped Castiel’s left hand.   “I am taking the role of Claire here,” Dean said firmly.  He was determined not to make this weird.   “You’re leading.”
Cas calmed after a moment, and gently released Dean's lips. "Thank you. That was…." He tried to think of a word that summed up the experience and failed.
It seemed like no matter what position Dean tried in bed, he couldn’t get comfortable. Sighing he gathered all the pillows and cushions to create a supportive structure for his aching back. He had just settled when his bladder decided to tell him he needed to pee for the 50th time that day. Returning to bed, he sat on the edge of the bed ready to swing his legs up under the covers when he actually heard a soft pop and his lower half was soaked through. It took all of ten seconds for Dean to process that his waters had broken.
“Not my boyfriend,” Dean hissed.    Standing up Dean called out loudly attracting a lot of attention, “Cas, over here.  When you’re done.”
“I think we’ll save rimming for another time,” said Castiel and lowered his head back to Dean’s cock, as he pushed his finger in again, this time slightly deeper.
“Didn’t want to assume anything,” said Dean.  “Not with the Gabe judging every single interaction we have.”
"I learned that everything and anything can be right if both parties agree to it." Dean continued to keep the pressure between them. "How does that sound to you?" He moved his hips experimentally trying to judge Cas's reaction.
“Perhaps we shouldn’t be influencing Cassie here with bad ideas,” said Kali.   “After all not long now, before you’re off to Berkeley.  What’s your major?”
Dean hollowed his cheeks as he sucked again, and then released it with a popping sound.    Tightening his hand around the foreskin, he lowered his head again, and this time licked and sucked in time with the motion of his hand.
“Oh yes,” said Gabriel with a grin.  “Fergus Crowley is exceptional at backroom deals.   I wouldn’t be surprised if he’d done a deal with the devil himself one moonlit night.”
When Dean didn’t respond, but continued to stand there staring at him, Castiel was concerned.   He tilted his head on one side, studying him.   “Are you alright?”  Castiel walked towards him, laying the sought after book on the table, and approached him cautiously, nothing but worry radiating from his features.
Dean pulled back and put a hand to Castiel’s face, staring into his eyes, so Castiel understood his sincerity.   “I swear to you, this is the single nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.”
Shifting his body slightly, Castiel leaned closer to Dean and pressed a kiss to his chest.  “I would like to suck you,” he whispered.
“I’m sorry.   I didn’t mean to startle you.”  Dean withdrew his hand and took a half step back as well.   Maybe he just needed a bit of space?
“OK. Well next time, would you please ask for help, or at least tell one of us where you are going?” she said. “What if you had passed out in there?”
Dean pulled back.   “Tell me you understand this Cas?   Tell me I wasn’t wrong.  That you feel the same way?”
“No, numb nuts.  I mean, what if we make him part of our group. Instead of covertly following him, let’s go all out.  Make him sit with us at lunch, during lessons, even drive him home,” said Lee enthusiastically.
Cas was well aware of Dean's strength, and his own, and knew well enough that if Dean wanted to, he could quickly release himself. But it appeared that Dean was happy to let have his way at the moment, submitting to Cas's actions. He thrust hard against Dean, their cocks sliding together between them. As he expected Dean started to curse, a long line of, "fuck", "hell", "yes", "please" and a few "need"'s soon had Cas hard again.
Reaching out very slowly and touching Dean on the shoulder to get his attention, Castiel said, “Dean, you are exhausted. You need to get some rest.”
“Some things, some people are worth fighting for,” said Dean.  “I’ll defend myself when I have to.  But a few words don’t bother me personally.”
Dean’s labour continued for another hour, before Missouri performed another check on Dean.  He was surprised when she said she wanted to move him to a surgical room, rather than have him deliver the baby in the delivery room. “We have better equipment in there,” she reassured him. “I’m going to take Sam to get him gowned up,” she said. “You’ll see him in there soon.”
Pulling back slightly, Cas turned and indicated his doppelgänger.  “Dean.   This is my brother Jimmy.  Jimmy Novak.  My twin.”
Surprised but grateful, Castiel smiled, “Thank you.  I appreciate your discretion.   Maybe you can fill Sam in on my past later after I’m gone.   I don’t think I want to go through it again.”
"Dean…" Cas moaned, and Dean felt a thrill of delight at being able to provide pleasure to Cas in that way. Dean smirked inwardly, he'd had plenty of practice of kissing, knowing it was a particular skill of his that previous partners had commented on. Dean reached up and whilst continuing to kiss Cas, removed Cas's tie and undid a couple of the buttons on Cas's shirt. Licking the exposed flesh, loving the taste of Cas as he did so. A moment later, Dean suddenly felt a draft as Cas lifted Dean's t-shirt from the waist and pulled it off over Dean's head. "Not using your mojo tonight," whispered Dean still undoing Cas's shirt buttons.
Choking and spluttering, Castiel tried to construct a sentence.   “I am not… I didn’t.”   He swallowed.   “Just don’t talk to me anymore and they’ll accept you.”
“You just always seem sure of yourself, and, well, you seem much more experienced.    And you know my past, or well perhaps lack of it,” said Castiel.
Dean caught a flash of something across his father’s face.   Pride, concern, anger, fear, or perhaps a combination of all of them.
Dean’s breathing sped up. He couldn’t believe that Cas was saying this. He felt his pulse race, and knew that whatever happened next would make or break their friendship.
“Not to worry, we’ll keep an eye on you here, and have the Doctor assess you,” said the nurse. “I’ll be back in a bit.” She left the room, closing the door.
Castiel continued walking until Dean grabbed him by the wrist, forcing him to stop.  “God dammit, talk to me.”
Resuming his seat, Castiel hesitated then dug several books from his bag.   One of them grabbed Sam's interest.
True to his word, Castiel kept himself, Dean, and also Sam focused on their exams.   Dean had been dreading them, fully expecting to struggle, but he’d been pleasantly surprised that whilst not exactly sailing through them, it didn’t feel like they were the unmitigated disaster he’d thought they might be.
Their kissing escalated rapidly, becoming desperate and sloppy.    Dean’s hands slid under Castiel’s shirt and Castiel ran his fingers through Dean’s hair, pulling him back for more.
Withdrawing the gun from his pocket, Dean passed it over his shoulder to Benny, along with the spare clip. “I’m gonna approach from the East.  There’s better tree cover.  I’ll drop you off along the road. Use the tree line or any other scrap of cover to get as close as you can.   I don’t know if it will be just Alistair, or more of them.   I think it unlikely he’ll be waiting there.   He’ll want to see me there first before coming in.   That should give me enough time to set up a couple of things,” said Dean.  “Don’t worry about me.  Your only job is to protect Cas and get him out of there.  However else this plays out – leave me.  Got it.”
Castiel withdrew his finger, and Dean whined at the sudden loss.   Hearing a soft click, Dean looked up to see Castiel had taken the bottle of lube, and was squeezing a large glob of the fluid onto his fingers.  Carefully recapping the bottle, Castiel started rubbing Dean’s hole again, this time with a lot better lubrication and his own saliva.
Picking up the first gun, Dean expertly assessed it.   Confirming the safety was on, he released the magazine and checked it, cleared the gun removing the bullet from the chamber, checked the slide was free and moved easily, and knowing it was empty, pointed it at the wall and pulled the trigger to get the feel for it.  He quickly reloaded the gun and pocketed the ammunition and extra clip, comfortably slipping the gun into his jeans at the small of his back.     He then repeated the process for the second gun, grunting in satisfaction.  He placed the second one in his jacket pocket.      The whole process had taken less than two minutes.
“As I said in the car,” said Castiel cautiously. “Courting, marriage if you wish, mating. I don’t know your current housing arrangements, but if you preferred to live there, I would be willing to move to be with you. My house has room for Jack and yourself if you would consider that. Sam said it was your decision, but I would understand if you needed to seek his counsel.”
Dean glanced at his reflection in the windows of the Impala, tugged his leather jacket up at the collar, and painted on his patented “I’m good looking and I know it” sexy smirk, and sauntered over to the main entrance.   Three months.   He could do this – for Sammy’s sake he would do this.
Castiel smiled and began to dance again with Dean in his arms.   The rhythm was slightly faster on this song, and suited the waltz movement he had been practising earlier.
Dean walked to the Impala and placed his duffle bag in the trunk. Castiel walked close behind him.   Dean opened the car door but before he could climb in, Castiel pulled Dean into a final hug.    “I know I said I wouldn’t make a scene. But I can’t help it.”
As Dean Winchester pulled his father’s ’67 Impala into the local school car park, he risked a glance at his younger brother, sitting to his right in the front passenger seat.   Sam was fiddling with a slightly longer than normal piece of hair by his ear. Dean knew what that meant – he only ever did the hair twisting when he was nervous.
Another nurse appeared and injected a clear liquid into the cannula in the back of his hand. It took a few seconds, but Dean immediately felt calmer. He could hear the nurses calling out stats from the monitor, and Missouri talking to him; he could feel Sam holding and squeezing his hand; he could feel something pressing on his stomach and the smell of blood. He was aware of everything, but couldn’t find the strength or the inclination to actually be worried about it.
Castiel released Dean’s hand, as he used his key card to enter NICU, and held the door open for him. Dean dropped his head, trying to hide his smile.
“Thank you Dean,” said Castiel sincerely.   “No selling a kidney, and no ‘shady’ actions necessary.”  He air quoted the word shady with a smile.
The rest of the evening passed quickly, with Kali, Gabriel and Zar continuing to regale the younger members with various stories of their misspent youth at University.
Dean invited Castiel around to their place for dinner and a movie on Thursday, which he accepted.   At Castiel’s insistence, they picked him up from the library car park, which was much quieter, and was away from the stares of the other students.
“Dean,” yelled Benny when he spotted him.   Lee was with him, and they looked worried.  They both ran over to meet Dean and Sam and pulled them a little ways away from the crowd.  “It’s Cas.”
“And you think you’re protecting them, by not being friends with them,” said Gabriel sadly.   “That’s not how it should work little bro.   And I honestly think Dean can probably look after himself.”
Dean grabbed at Castiel’s tie, and after using it to pull Castiel in for another deep kiss, he tugged the knot loose, and let it fall.   Castile reciprocated by divesting Dean of his overshirt.
Straining his neck to turn and kiss Castiel back, Dean gave him a small sad smile and indicated for him to take a seat.
Dean groaned and sighed as Castiel used a single finger to stretch Dean. Castiel worked him gently for some time, letting Dean get used to the feel.  “I’m going to add another now,” said Castiel giving Dean a chance to stop him.   Dean grunted acknowledgement.
Castiel blushed.   “Can’t say I have.  It’s all seems a bit weird when you actually know some of the actors.”
Sighing, Castiel started walking home.   It was better this way.  He could put some distance between them, for their benefit.
Henriksen looked to the rest of the class.   “But the story is told from the viewpoint of the second Mrs De Winter.  Can anyone here tell me the name of the new wife in the story?”
The drive was long, leading them past open fields and woodland, and paddocks with horses.  Eventually, they pulled up at what looked like an old converted Kansas Barn, complete with lean to and silo.   There was a beautiful covered patio and seating area, hung with a multitude of soft glowing lights off to one side.   Dean pulled into the gravel car park, stopped the engine and looked at Castiel with astonishment.   “You booked a hotel?”
Dean’s stomach dropped.   Standing up, disrupting the class, he grabbed his bag and started moving towards the door.
Carefully Dean unzipped it.   Inside was some paperwork, the spare key to the Impala and a beautiful stainless-steel Colt M1911A1 .45 handgun.   Dean looked at it slightly in awe.   “Dad?”
The quietness continued as Dean made breakfast.   He was in the kitchen cooking pancakes, whilst Gabriel made coffee.  Sam was sitting at the kitchen table reading one of Gabriel’s contracts and highlighting certain passages with an orange marker.  Castiel appeared tousled haired from the Playroom and snuck in behind Dean to give him a warm hug and a kiss on his neck as he cooked.
Taking a deep breath, and concentrating on just a single patch of skin on Castiel’s back, Dean sighed.   “Growing up, with Dad drinking, or taking off the way he did, there were times, and I ain’t proud of this, but there were times when I needed money to buy food or clothes for Sammy.   Well, let’s put it this way, I was considered pretty back then, and truckers travelling a long way from home often need company, and they pay well for it.  There are also a lot more male truckers than female ones.”
Dean couldn’t articulate what he wanted, he just knew he didn’t want this feeling to end.   “Please.”
Castiel scoffed.  “You know that’s not true.”  He sighed, “It’s been good having you around this week.   In a way it makes it harder to say goodbye.  I got a taste of what living with you would be like.”
Dean heard his morning alarm beeping, and without even opening his eyes, he tried to reach over to turn it off. He flailed his arm, but couldn’t find either the alarm or his bedside cabinet. Groaning, he tried to open his eyes, but he felt like someone had super glued them closed. He tried to roll onto his side, but he felt sluggish, and his legs wouldn’t cooperate.
Castiel looked a little confused at the comment, but made his way out the sofa area again, where Dean was waiting.  He took his place in front of the mirror as before, this time automatically adjusting his stance to be straight and tall.
Dean wasn’t actually that worried about leaving Sam alone.  Both boys had been raised to be pretty independent.  But, unwilling to be completely open with his friends about his Dad and his home life, Dean found it easier to keep them slightly at arm’s length.  Sam was a good excuse, and Dean knew it.
Confused Castiel held out his hand to Dean to take the tags, when Gabriel suddenly reached out and closed his hand around Castiel’s wrist snagging the black and red beaded bracelet that was now showing. Gabriel looked at it closely and then howled with laughter again.  He was laughing so hard, he couldn’t speak.
Dean gaped.  “That’s worse!   Jesus man, you don’t even have a job.   I made you spend nearly a grand, in one go, without blinking.   You aren’t going to have to do something dumb to pay that off, are you? Like sell a kidney?”
Cas was well aware of everything he was doing to Dean, he could feel every shudder and tremor as Cas worshipped him. His own pleasure felt secondary to him, compared to ensuring Dean felt good. But one look at Dean’s face, his cheeks tinged with pink, his lips swollen and plump from their earlier kisses, his green eyes staring into Cas’s blue ones begging without words, and Cas’s resolve shattered.
Gabriel stood back and tried to wipe his eyes surreptitiously.  “Well, I guess you’d both best be getting home.”
The conversation about Harry Potter, continued for the rest of the lunch break, during which there were several heated discussions about whether Dobby should have been included in the films (the consensus was, yes, he should have been), agreement that Ron and Hermione were not suited, that Snape and Dumbledore should have talked to Harry more, and Mrs Weasley was the best mother in the world.   Castiel joined in at some points but seemed happier to watch and listen to the banter between the friends.
Castiel pulled away and started walking again.  Dean ran in front of him and put his hands up against Castiel’s chest to stop him. Castiel just stood there, like he was exhausted, and couldn’t put up a fight anymore.  “Why did you put yourself in danger like that.  I told you what happened to people around me.  Didn’t you think about how I would feel?  How it would hurt me if something happened to you?” Castiel said, his voice cracking.
One of the men turned to face Dean, "Fuck off," he said in response, "This has nothing to do with you."
A nervous look flickered over Castiel’s face, and Dean kissed him quickly.  “Here, sit down,” Dean led Castiel to a bench made from an old tree trunk, and made him sit.  Dean knelt directly in front of him and took his hands.   “I love you,” said Dean trying to reassure him, “nothing is ever going to change that.”
“I mean, I guess sometimes I think you’re going to work out that you could do a lot better than some nomadic weirdo, that lives out a car, and ….”
Gabriel suddenly realised that Dean didn’t have transportation at the hospital, as he had come with him.  “Given they’re keeping you in overnight Cassie, how about I run home and grab a few bits for you.  Washbag and PJ’s?  I’ll take Dean-o to collect his car.  We left it at ours.”
Dean watched the monitors for a while, jumping a few times when the alarms went off.   The nurse was quick to check, and reassure them, that nothing was wrong.  Apparently because of Castiel’s levels of fitness overall, he had a low resting heartbeat, below 60 beats per minute.   After the third time, the nurse adjusted the settings down slightly, which stopped the false alarms.
Castiel lowered Dean’s legs back to the ground and let himself be led to the Playroom.  Once inside, Dean turned on the bedside lamp and closed the door.
Dean’s car was already at the end of the driveway. Castiel saw the brief flicker of brake lights as the car turned left and sped away. Away from him.
A shop assistant had spotted them early on when the entered the store.  Sensing a big sale like a shark smells blood, he approached the boys with a friendly but amused expression.   “Hi, I’m Noah.   Can I be of assistance?” he asked politely, immediately assessing that Dean was in charge of this situation.
John patted Dean on the back, and they broke apart.  “Maybe all he needs is a friend.  Someone in his corner,” said John.
Gabriel, on the other hand, had been great to Cas. As the older brother closest in age to Cas, Gabriel had always felt a strong sense of responsibility for his little brother. Gabe, like Cas, had never bought into the Nazi propaganda spouted by their parents and family members. Gabe, unlike Cas, was better at hiding it.
“Actually, you know what? I’d like to speak with him myself. I need a baker for an event I have coming up and I think he’d be perfect. Where’s the back room, through here?”
“Sorry, Cas, but I’m not gonna be around for dinner tonight. Gotta work the night shift at the cafe.”
The man grabbed a handful of Dean’s hair, pulling him forward with one arm as he used the other to guide his dick to Dean’s mouth. “Open wide, faggot.”
Not knowing quite what to do, Cas took another look around what had been Dean’s living area for those few, glorious years. It was all exactly how he remembered it, except . . . wait, what was that piece of paper?
His teeth gritted, Cas invited the person inside. She was small, blonde-haired, and looked much younger than Cas himself. She was, objectively, an attractive young woman. Years ago, Cas would have been wondering what she was doing outside his back door, looking dirty and malnourished. Now, he had a few guesses. Why did the universe keep doing this to him?
After a few awkward minutes of this, Cas tried to get Dean to eat by joking, “It’s not getting any warmer, Dean.”
And that was how Cas found himself, hours later, covered from head to toe in flour and grinning at the equally flour-covered man in front of him.
Cas opened the door to find a blond haired man standing on his doorstep in full military uniform, his arm raised as if to knock again. The man smiled toothily. “Castiel! Long time, no see, cousin!”
Finally, Dean stopped Cas mid-bob, tugging him back up to meet Dean’s face. He saw Cas’ face, his pupils blown wide with lust, and pulled him into a kiss. Dean could taste himself on Cas’ lips and he loved it.
Not two days after he put the sign up, Cas was interrupted from his thoughts by a soft knock on the back door of his bakery. The back door led straight into the workroom, where Cas prepared the food, and it was seldom used. Cas wasn’t even sure what was out that door.
Cas knew that there was no such thing as perfect, but he’d be damned if this wasn’t pretty darn close.
. You knew there was no other option; it was either submit or die. Alastair is evil, Dean, and you were the victim. Don’t blame yourself for what he did to you, because it doesn’t define you. I still love you, no matter what.”
Cas kept his gaze firmly above shoulder-level as he handed Dean the clothing. “Let me know if it fits,” Cas requested.
Predictably, Cas found it very difficult to focus on his tasks over the next couple of days. Every normal thought was instead replaced with
Cas tilted his head at Dean, his brow furrowing slightly. “Of course not,” he replied. “I’m your host, Dean. You look hungry, so I gave you food. It’s what anyone would do.”
“Yeah?” I moved in less than a year ago. Cas joined me a couple of weeks later and we started dating only a little while after that. What’s Crowley playing at?
As it's American Thanksgiving, I'd like to give thanks to all the people who helped me through the process of my first DCBB. First off, I'm crazily thankful for
Dean was sitting on the mattress looking utterly distraught. His eyes were red-rimmed, his nose puffy, and Cas’ first impression was that he looked like a kicked puppy. The fear reflected in his wide, green eyes was too much for Cas to handle as he took a seat next to Dean on the mattress. Even broken like this, Cas couldn’t help noticing that he still looked so beautiful. Still his Dean Winchester.
Dean didn’t look convinced, but he took the plate that Cas was offering him anyway. Cas bade Dean goodnight and retreated upstairs to eat his own supper.
An idea hit Cas one day as he was walking by the auto dealership to run some errands in town. Dean had a penchant for automobiles, Cas knew that, and he also knew that Dean had never gotten one of his own. What if Cas could change that?
Cas’ suspicions were confirmed one night while the two lay in bed together, the darkness of the room providing a cover for Dean’s embarrassment.
There was no answer. Starting to get worried, Cas slowly walked down the stairs. Each step sounded louder than usual in the silent house; the quiet was almost deafening. Peering around the stairs at the alcove underneath, he asked again. “Dean?”
craze died down and fewer and fewer Nazis frequented the bakery every day. However, the effect was in place. So many officers had eaten at Cas’ bakery that none of them were going to make any trouble with him. In their minds, he was a good guy, a fine gentleman. All it took to win over some Nazis, it seemed, were some freshly-made
Dean blushed. Cas particularly enjoyed it when Dean blushed; the color in his cheeks made his freckles even more prominent than usual.
Cas hummed appreciatively, wishing he had something more interesting to say. Sammy didn’t seem to do well with silence, so he kept talking to fill the quiet.
Cas blushed at the praise and changed the topic. “Of course, we’ll have to be extremely careful. I got some supplies, so today you are my mechanic, tuning up the new automobile that I purchased. Okay?”
“What if I want it to happen again?” Cas asked quietly, not quite sure of the answer himself. Did Cas think of Dean like that? Did he want their relationship to take that next step?
Dean didn’t think that Alastair bothered to learn his name throughout the whole year he  spent at his house. Alastair simply referred to his slave by a series of derogatory nicknames, the most prominent of which continued to be
Cas mentioned his correspondence with Balthazar, the rebel who had accidentally given Dean Cas’ address to begin with. Dean blanched slightly at the name, a reaction which Cas did not overlook. Cas inquired what was wrong and Dean answered hesitantly.
Dean knew Cas would be upset at first but he hoped he would come to understand. It was for Cas’ own good; Dean didn’t know if he himself would survive the war, but he sure as hell was going to make sure Cas would.
Benny nodded, too overcome with emotion to speak, and Cas waved one last time before heading out of the camp, leaving Benny standing with the handful of
Dean couldn’t answer, his throat was so raw and abused. The man seemed to take his silence as assent, though, because he dragged Dean inside the building he’d been resting against. It turned out to have been the man’s house.
Cas lived alone, miles away from the rest of his family. He had a large extended family, comprised mostly of Nazis and Nazi sympathizers. Cas’ cousin Lucifer was a high-ranking SS officer in close proximity to Himmler himself, and, despite being a few years older than Cas, the two had been practically inseparable growing up. Lucifer, despite some of his faults, had always been good to Cas, keeping him safe and consistently having his back. Once they had matured into adulthood, the cousins hadn't had the opportunity to hang out as frequently, but Lucifer did come over on occasion to catch up. Cas appreciated Lucifer, even if he disagreed with most everything his cousin stood for.
“Yes, of course you can. Feel free to stay here as long as you need until you find a more permanent place,” Cas heard himself say.
It wasn't a request, but the tone with which Dean demanded this of Cas was anything but authoritative. Nevertheless, Cas caught this slight display of confidence and smiled, remembering the shaking, broken man who had appeared on his doorstep two years earlier. Two years. It seemed like a lifetime had passed since that fateful night, but at the same time, the whole thing was like a brief flash in Cas’ memory.
Dean waited a short while before leaving the house, letting the other inhabitants of the area leave for work before he ventured out into the unknown. Dean knew it was risky to leave in broad daylight, but he’d weighed his options and had decided that it was better to risk that than to face Alastair again.
When they were safely inside, Dean crowded Cas against the door, peppering him with kisses. "Thank you, thank you, thank you," he breathed between kisses. "That was the nicest thing you possibly could've done for me."
When Cas closed the basement door behind Dean, the freckled man decided to eavesdrop on the conversation by sitting against the door, his ear pressed firmly against the wooden surface. Dean listened as Cas welcomed the visitor inside and they made their way to the kitchen table. Peering through the keyhole, Dean realized with a pang of fear that their dinner plates were still on the table. Neither Cas nor the other man seemed to have noticed. As the men took their seats, Dean got his first glimpse of the strange man. He had short, blond hair, was dressed in full Nazi uniform, and seemed perfectly at home reclining comfortably with his back towards Dean.
Cas furrowed his brow, puzzled. That only left the basement, but why would Dean be down there? He opened the door that led downstairs. “Dean?” he called questioningly.
Alastair made Dean clean up after him, doing all the chores to keep the house spotlessly clean. Dean washed the dishes, did Alastair’s laundry, scrubbed his boots, and pressed his uniform to keep it in perfect condition between uses.
Reveling in the feeling of Cas’ warm touch, Dean reached into Cas’ shorts and began to stroke in tandem with the hand on his own cock. He swiped his thumb across Cas’ slit, spreading the precome around and eliciting a moan from the man.
Dean knew he was going to be taken away. He had accepted it. That was his punishment for letting his guard down, for opening up to Cas. Dean cursed himself for ever thinking a Nazi like Cas could be good.
Cas ushered Sammy into the house, sitting the boy down at the kitchen table and offering him a drink. Sammy accepted a cup of tea, blowing on the mug to cool it before taking a small sip.
Dean finished cleaning himself and retreated back into his room, pondering this new option. If he escaped, he would be free, but he didn’t have anywhere to go. Dean wasn’t even sure where he was, exactly. It had been so long since he had contact with the outside world. Dean figured he could run and find a way to contact the resistance once he was away from Alastair. That was, if the resistance still existed. Dean wasn’t sure how much time had passed; though it had likely been mere months, it felt as though he had been in this hell for forty years. For all Dean knew, the resistance could have been long since wiped out and he would be out of luck.
“I know,” reassured Cas. “I love you, Dean, and I would never let anything happen to you. Please, let me help you.”
Not wanting to disturb Dean from his rest, Cas swallowed hard and continued his ministrations, wiping the dried come from Dean’s legs and balls. Finally, he ran the cloth gingerly over the letters, cleaning the mess that had transferred from the sheets. Placing a soft kiss to the tattoo, Cas got rid of the rag and moved Dean enough to cover the wet spot on the bed with a towel. They'd deal with that in the morning. For now, Cas wanted to cuddle with Dean and show him just how much he was loved.
The aforementioned “angel” cuffed Dean on the shoulder good naturedly. “Just eat your pie,” Cas laughed.
Winter in Buchenwald was, as one might imagine, unimaginable. The prisoners were expected to complete their tasks just as efficiently in the cold, despite the slippery layer of ice that seemed to coat every surface. It didn’t help that most of the prisoners were nothing but skin and bones at that point, with no fat to give them extra warmth.
Dean was happy to oblige, taking a pie cutter from the cutlery drawer and cutting himself a large slice. Cas chuckled. The man could never have enough pie. Cas took a considerably smaller piece for himself and they sat, enjoying the baked good in relative silence, punctuated only by Dean’s occasional pornographic moans. Dean really, really liked pie.
Dean looked taken aback at that response, obviously not having thought of it. “Uh,” he responded, ever the eloquent one.
Most of the pie-making process passed without incident, other than Dean's inability to leave the pie filling on the counter without eating it. He thought he was being sneaky, but Cas caught every spoonful.
Cas cautiously opened the door to find a man standing on the doorstep in dirty clothes, looking around furtively with wide, scared eyes. Wide, scared eyes that just happened to be the most striking shade of green that Cas had ever seen. Cas was certain he had never seen the man before, but he looked to be in trouble. It quickly dawned on Cas that the man might have been a Jew or someone else hiding from the Nazis. That didn’t, however, explain what he was doing on Cas’ doorstep in the middle of the night.
Once inside, the woman spoke up, tossing her hair over her shoulders. “I saw you put up a sign for an assistant. Still need one?”
On the fifth day after Lucifer’s visit, a Sunday, Cas decided that enough was enough. Nothing was going to get better unless he talked to Dean and they worked it out.
Draining his coffee, Dean washed and dried the mug, placing it back in the cupboard. No reason to leave a mess behind for Cas. He gathered his few belongings, securing them in a rag to carry with him. He didn’t need much; Dean would be back before he knew it.
Dean and Cas talked late into the night, long after they had finished eating. At some point, they had moved to sit on Dean’s mattress, as it was more comfortable than the hard boxes.
When the meal was complete, Dean and Cas washed up and took their regular seats at the kitchen table. Cas spooned large portions onto two plates, sliding one over to Dean, and they dug in.
Dean and Benny did not hesitate to get away from there, moving as fast as they could without dropping the heavy blocks. When they were a safe distance away, out of the guard’s earshot and line of sight, Benny put the block down and put a hand on Dean’s shoulder, stopping him from moving any further.
This whole situation is exhausting, but what choice do I have? Just a few more days and it’ll be back to normal. I’m doing this for us. Cas never has to know.
Sammy obliged, taking another bite of the piece of bread that Dean had given him. Benny ruffled the kid’s buzzed hair, chuckling. It was moments like this that it seemed like maybe, just maybe, they would all be okay.
“Hey, Cas,” I plaster a smile onto my face. Cas is an angel; he doesn’t need to get caught up in my troubles.
When they had finished their shower, Dean and Cas donned matching towels around their waists and stood in Cas’ (
Gathering up every last bit of strength I possess, I force myself up for one last shot. I have to do it. I haven’t worked this hard only to fall short by such a small amount.
As Cas entered the bakery, bells jingling as a way of a welcome, he made his way into the back room of the shop, swapping his hat and coat for an apron and hairnet. Cas checked his pocket watch; it was eight-thirty in the morning, which gave him half an hour to begin baking before the bakery officially opened at nine. He poured some flour on his workspace and rolled up his sleeves. Time to begin.
His visit effectively over, Cas walked Gabe to the door as he left. Gabriel promised to check in on Castiel more often, and Cas had a feeling Gabe would stick to that promise.
Contacting Gabriel, Cas arranged to go the next day to the nearest displaced persons camp to begin his search. This camp, a short train ride away from Cas’ neighbourhood, happened to be home to many survivors of Buchenwald Concentration Camp as well as various survivors from surrounding cities. Cas wondered idly what state he would find Dean in upon arriving at the displaced persons camp. No matter what, Cas knew he would recognize those sparkling green eyes from anywhere. He couldn’t wait to see them again.
Benny inclined his head in a way of a salute. “Of course, Cas. I’m glad I finally got to meet you; Dean spoke the world of you, you know. He really loved you.”
Cas made his way back into the kitchen and brought Dean’s plate to the table. He realized that he should probably offer his guest a drink, so Cas hurried down to the basement to grab two bottles of beer. To be fair, Cas also needed a beer after the evening’s surprises.
That statement worried Cas a bit. Was he building up a reputation? The last thing Cas wanted was a bunch of Nazis in his bakery, asking uncomfortable questions. Cas looked back at the woman standing before him, torn. Once again, Cas had to choose between his safety and his morality.
Cas supposed he could have stayed downstairs and eaten with Dean, but he didn’t want to intrude. Cas laughed to himself. How strange was that? It was his house, yet he didn’t want to intrude on the man who was living (temporarily) in his basement. This was coming from the man who, just over twenty-four hours ago, would never have allowed a refugee to take shelter in his home. What was it about Dean that changed things?
Cas froze, his eyes wide like a deer’s in the headlights. Shit. How could he have been so stupid and forgotten about their dinner? He tried to think of a way out, but Cas had never been a particularly good liar, especially when caught off guard.
Taking a deep breath, Cas put on a fake smile and addressed the woman. “Happy to help. From now on, you’re an employee here. What’s your name?”
Dean tripped over himself in his excitement, hurrying over to the window as if taking longer would cause his surprise to disappear. Cas moved so that Dean could look outside. From the kitchen window they had a perfect view of the automobile sitting in Cas’ driveway.
While Alastair was out, Dean was locked in his room, empty spare for a cot, bedpan, and water bowl. Although this was a miserable and rather lonely existence, Dean could have handled it. It was when Alastair was home that Dean wished he could take his own life to save himself the suffering.
When he finished, Cas looked over at Gabe, trying to gauge his reaction. Much to Cas’ surprise, Gabriel started to laugh. A small chuckle grew into a full blown laugh, Gabriel wheezing as he wiped tears from the corners of his eyes. Cas failed to see what was so funny, and he told his brother as much.
“Thank you again, Cas. It was great to finally meet Dean’s angel.” Sammy and Cas exchanged farewells and then Sammy was gone. Cas went back to his newspaper, but he couldn’t focus on the words. Sammy’s visit had stirred up feelings that had been lying dormant for years.
, for creating the incredible art for this fic! I definitely cried a little when I saw everything she made. Check out the
Dean had his eyes closed, trying to keep perfectly still, when he heard a loud thud and a stream of muttered curses. The mysterious army man had accidentally missed the dumpster, sending a pile of rubbish to the ground right in front of Dean. Eyes wide, Dean braced himself as the man rounded the corner of the bin.
No. What was he thinking? Castiel Novak didn't hide the hunted; it was his one rule! Cas opened his mouth to turn Dean down, to politely tell him that no, he couldn’t stay there, but it seemed that Cas’ mouth had a mind of its own.
After laying there for a few minutes, Dean forced himself to get up. He took a damp rag and went to the bathroom mirror, twisting around as best he could to clean himself up. The cloth stung as well but Dean hardly felt the pain. Once he had cleaned the majority of the dried semen, Dean was able to clearly see the word that Alastair had so carefully etched into his skin.
. Cocksucker. This wasn’t just a casual nickname, either. Dean may have been a slave in terms of the household chores he performed, but he was primarily a slave in regard to the acts he performed for Alastair’s pleasure. Dean was, essentially, Alastair’s sex slave.
Dean admitted that other than a few items of clothing, he didn’t have much for Jack. He didn’t have a cot or crib for Jack, or even a car seat. He’d been too afraid to buy or plan anything due to the court case. He couldn’t bear the thought of going home to his apartment without Jack, and seeing a crib there. Castiel had pulled Dean into a comforting embrace, and then opened his phone, selected his Amazon account and told Dean to fill the basket with everything and anything he wanted for Jack’s room. At first Dean refused, but when Castiel had pointed out that if Dean didn’t select the items, Castiel would and he might get the wrong thing, Dean had taken the phone and carefully selected only the essentials, including a cot that could be converted to a bed later. When Dean had finished, Castiel selected delivery for the following Saturday, confirmed the order and checked out.
About five minutes into the lecture from the teacher, Castiel realised Dean didn’t have any notebooks, or ruled paper.   Somewhat hesitantly he tore off a few sheets from his own pad and slid them over.  In all good conscience he couldn’t let Dean struggle.
Picking up on Gabriel’s coldness and the concern raised about Uriel from previous conversations, Dean replied coldly, “I’m a friend of Cas’s.”
When Dean entered the library, he saw Castiel reaching for one of the books on the rarely used upper shelves.     The book was just fractionally out of reach for him, and he huffed as he stretched the last few centimetres to allow him to grip the book firmly, standing on his tip toes on one foot, his other leg stretched out offering him balance.
They kept up a steady stream of inconsequential chatter, with Castiel giving the occasional directional prompt.  Soon Lawrence was in the rear view mirror, and Dean relaxed, Castiel’s hand resting against his leg comfortably.  After about 40 minutes, and sooner than Dean expected, Castiel indicated the next turning on the right.   Dean pulled in and saw a sign for the ‘Circle S Ranch and Country House’.
“Both over 18,” said the Sheriff with a smile.   “Now Alistair’s daddy has been phoning the Mayor and the Governor about his boy.   Throwing his weight around.  As you know, he has no power over me, and the offenses were carried out in my jurisdiction.  He’s already hired one of the top lawyers in Kansas.  Given the overwhelming evidence, I am hoping they will just plead guilty or plea bargain, but assuming they don’t and push for a trial, it’s likely you boys will be called to give evidence.  That could be anytime up to about 60 days from now.  So, I’ll need you to keep me informed of your whereabouts.”
“The Impala is yours.  You’ve always looked after her like she was your baby.  Now she is.  It’s time for you to do your thing now, Dean.  Not mine.  Your future lies elsewhere.”
Dean held him close and kissed him back.   “I can’t say it like you, but know I mean it.   I love you too.”
Dean had achieved his GED, and with Gabriel’s and Castiel’s help and encouragement had applied to the California Fire Service.  Sheriff Mills had volunteered a letter of reference, and Dean had been accepted to join their training program.   Not only would he receive training to become a Firefighter, but he was also paid a salary.   His supervisor was impressed with aptitude and natural leadership skills and had already recommended additional certifications to boost Dean’s career.
Dean checked his watch and smiled.  7.30am.  They still had a few hours before they had to leave.   He lay back with his hands behind his head and grinned.  For the first time in a long time, he felt good.
Careful not to fall onto Castiel, Dean reluctantly withdrew, and collapsed next to him his chest still heaving.
As Castiel stretched, his back and shoulder muscles flexed under his shirt, and it pulled up a fraction, causing the hem to slip free from its securely tucked in status, and allowing a sliver of taught flesh to be flashed to anyone who might be watching.   And Dean was watching.  Watching as the seams of the shirt were abused across Castiel’s shoulders, the already tight trousers across Castiel’s backside seemed to become a second skin, and the legs of his trousers tighten as his thighs tensed and worked to keep his balance.
Dean sniggered quietly. “Gabe doesn’t stand a chance. His two with our lot in public. He’s either very brave, or very stupid.”
As always, a huge thank you to everyone who has read this story, and leaves Kudos or Comments.   I appreciate each and every one.
Cas's other hand, the one not holding Dean up, gently reached out to touch Dean's cheek, cupping it slightly before moving into his still wet hair, and caressing the back of his head, giving Dean the opportunity to change his mind. Slowly Cas closed the gap between them, his whole body pressing against Dean, before closing the last few millimeters of space between their lips.
Turning, Castiel drew Dean in for a kiss.  “Just relax, I have it covered.”   They stood for a moment, just enjoying the closeness of each other.  After the passionate embrace they had shared in the car, this felt calm and right.  “That bed looks very comfortable,” said Castiel timidly.
Both Dean and Castiel huffed a small laugh and broke apart, smiling at each other, then Castiel hid his face in Dean’s neck embarrassed.  Dean just hugged him.   “I love you too,” murmured Castiel.  “So very much.”
“I’m just checking I heard you correctly,” said Patience. “I can see on your file that Doctor Moseley made some notes about possible early delivery, and given what you’ve told me, I think you should make your way to the Hospital. Do you have someone to drive you?”
“I think it would be a good idea to get you into a gown. Makes it a bit easier for you and the doctors,” she said, passing Dean a hospital maternity gown, and drawing a curtain across part of the room to give Dean some privacy. “Can you manage, or would you like some help?”
“If you need anything, or have any problems, just dial zero on the room phone, and you’ll come through to reception.”   Mildred glanced over to Dean, “Do you need help with the bags?”
“No, seriously.  That was hot. I’m sure you could give lesson’s to Gabe’s actor friends,” said Dean with a grin, dropping his napkin over his lap to hide his aroused state.
Feeling confident, Alistair started to walk forwards Dean, freeing up space to the left of Castiel, and Dean drew a breath, it was now or never.  “Cas.  Na-lay-va.  Now!”
Cas silenced him with slight squeeze on his shoulder, and stood to face him. "Dean Winchester, you are my friend, and always will be. But I confess I feel more for you than any one I have ever met. Your strength, your courage, your determination amazes me every day. More than any of my brothers and sisters, you make me want to be a better a person, for you."
“It’s nice to meet you, Sammy. Benny told me many good things. Didn’t you move to Israel after the war?” Cas was trying to find a way to politely ask Sammy what he was doing back in Germany, five years later, showing up on Cas’ doorstep though they had never met before. Cas wasn’t aware that Sammy knew who he was, and yet, here they were.
The host walked past Dean and entered his bedroom, heading straight for his wardrobe. Thankfully, it seemed like he and Dean were about the same height. Cas figured that Dean could wash and dry the outfit that he arrived in, but he would need a pair of sleeping clothes for that night. The host chose a simple, striped sleep shirt and matching pants for his guest, as well as a pair of boxer shorts and socks.
towering over him. “Is this food not good enough for you?” Dean stood quickly, opening his mouth to defend himself. The
If only I had one more night, one more chance to earn the last bit of cash. But even with the time, I’m not sure I could bring myself to do it. The last two weeks have left me feeling sore, dirty, and, ironically, emptier than ever before.
Dean spoke haltingly, his voice quavering. “He told me not to tell. He said he’d hurt me if I told.”
I’m such an idiot. Of course there had been a fine print and of course I’d ignored it in my haste to find a place to live. “What does it say?”
Cas did a double take, caught off guard. That was not what he was expecting from this young refugee. “Uh, yeah, sure. Do you have any qualifications?”
