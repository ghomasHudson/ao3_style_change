“I couldn’t say for certain, but based on the evidence available to me, yes, I think he must be. Or at least he thinks he must be. It’s so hard to tell.” Sherlock is looking at Ademar’s bookcase. It’s been dusted and the books are in a different order. He casually goes through the list of scenarios that might have led to the bookcases being cleaned and re-stacked. He deduces it must have tipped over in the throes of some especially energetic client service.
“You’re right, as usual, my love. Now I want to tell you about what some of the doctors have said, and I want to show you something.”
Sherlock smiles. “Oh, definitely. Except not at all, really. But they’re brave and very smart. And they make excellent doctors.”
Sherlock walked back alone to sit on the other side of his mother, where he watched the old boat take the flames, burn brightly for a few brief moments before it disintegrated, some parts sinking to the cold floor of the sea, and other pieces floating away forever.
Back home, John is slumped over the table, nursing a cup of tea and staring at twenty eight feathers lined up from shortest to longest. Just trying to work out why Sherlock needed twenty eight feathers fills him with love. Every senseless thing about Sherlock makes him feel this way.
Outside in the kitchen pots rattled and the house thumped. Rhonda crept back under the bed. A few days later he came home to find her asleep in his laundry hamper.
“We’d better,” John answers, happy that tomorrow is a nursery day.
He stood there next to me in the hospital foyer where he had just watched me being discharged. I had been hospitalized because John Watson’s wife shot me again, just before she was arrested.
smiles and nods. There are tiny crusts of blood at either side of his lips.
When Sherlock gets home in the morning, John has left for work.
Videlicet:
After forty minutes or so John tosses a little, rolls to his back and flings his arm above his
"Good evening, Sergeant Donovan. I was invited by Detective Inspector Lestrade."
“I can’t believe you’ve just worked that out now. And you’re right, these suits are great.”
Friends. Oh, for a friend. It's a lovely thing to hear and John sinks back down on the pillows Sherlock has wedged behind him.
“Who are they?”
John's entirely unsure but a couple of hours later, scrubbed and oiled and massaged from neck to toes, he understands how much he really did need a scrub.
"Why does anyone need a head?"
John watches his bare backside, not quite covered by his shirt, with a mix of quiet admiration and rough lust.
St Bart’s is only ten minutes walk from my flat so we got to test-drive the pram, which everyone we passed peered in, mostly because it was being pushed by a man and men with prams interest people.
Small warm ripples run over the bed; he feels Sherlock’s arms winding around his shoulders. Before Sherlock can say anything, John closes his eyes and speaks softly.
“I see you’ve started an anthology,” Sherlock says nonchalantly as he flicks through the morning papers.
“I guess. I don’t know.”
On the sofa are three plans of a building that was once, for a time, Wridge’s Wine Imports in Putney.
“Am I the Prince?”
“Strangely enough, no.”
Tremors ripple through John’s left hand. His leg starts to ache.
Detective Inspector Lestrade made a point of dropping by weekly, ostensibly to check on the cold cases but in reality to see me doing something related to parenting. He was a little like those people who stand at pet shop windows and watch mice run in wheels.
“What do you mean, ‘yours’? Did you steal him?” He glared at us both with growing distress. “Oh Sherlock, for the love of God – did you use that money to buy a baby?”
"What?"
Julia turns her face away, annoyed, and moves her mask to one side. “She disappeared. No one knows what happened to her. Leave me alone. Can’t you see I’m sick?”
They're both incredibly happy.
Sherlock expects that none of the police would have bothered speaking to John, and that the doctor would have just wandered off, returning to wherever he was going to shoot himself. Which is a shame. Unless of course he has the sense to follow me to the factory. Which he might. Which would be good. Except he mightn't, so I should just get the cabbie to turn around and we can swing by and pick him up.
I was in no mood to revisit the ugly incident so relied on John to tell the story.
The old man rubs the soft silky flannel of Sherlock's dressing gown and his eyes brighten like crystals that catch the sun.
Rosie doesn’t care. She points to her puzzle, and then gives Sherlock a wooden piece. “You can help,” she says.
It makes them both slightly dizzy. The worst things that were trapped between them are set free and float off on the cold air.
Sherlock springs to his feet. "Don't tell me they've found them."
“Mycroft. Thank you. Seriously. Thank you very much.”
The thought was interesting for a moment but after a few seconds it just made the pain worse. Pain management was needed.
“Well, don’t be obtuse, John. Tell me.”
Everything, thinks John, everything. It comes to him every so often when he least expects it. It's too many things to put into words and too many wonderful things for one person in one life time. Some times he feels like his heart is too full.
“Of course I do. The right one hasn’t come along. It’s just a matter of timing.”
The judge was wondering how Adrienne and I ever managed to make a baby. John Watson was wondering the same thing.
I seek it out in the dark when he sleeps.
Sherlock is part of the way through the day he will later call the naked day.
“Nope. Don’t like kids. Can I have a glass of water?”
“And you’re certain John is straight.”
“Why couldn’t you have just said, ‘Sherlock, you are sublime?’ “
“Can I have a cuddle with your son?”
“Is that a human skull?” Ms Powers asked, squinting over to the mantelpiece.
“No. Its pointless. I’ve got no claim on her. She’s back in Canada now, with her” – John Watson stammered a little here – “biological father, her grandparents, she’s even got a brother and sister. She should be with her family. Her real family.” He breathed very deeply and covered Albion with a corner of the rug. “It’s not her fault her parents were liars and did that to us. It’s in her best interest that she has no more disruption. She needs to have stability and a real family.”
“No,” I said. “After Albion was born, I paid Adrienne a sum of money to compensate her for the time she was out of the work force, and to assist her with living expenses after the birth. There was no third party.”
"You sure I can't tempt you?"
“John,” Sherlock says as he unlocks the door, “Before we go on, I need to know something.”
"Relax."
The midwife held up this odd, blood streaked bag of suet-looking thing that turned out to be the baby, and he looked around at her, and at the other nurses, and then at me, all with a look on his face that said “Who are you idiots”, and then he wailed, and I knew as firmly as I know my own name that he was mine.
“I’m John Watson, and this is Sherlock Holmes,” he says kindly as the woman takes her seat. “What brings you here?”
Because they can't access the phones.
3. John’s behaviour with Major Sholto confirmed that.
It is, thinks Sherlock, a perfect diagnosis of the current situation. John has no idea how much his rejuvenated dating life has wounded Sherlock; he has no idea how badly Sherlock longs to be his boyfriend. At the same time John, Sherlock knows, would never cause him deliberate hurt.
His smile is the colour of the sun that lights
Have I told you how much I love your poems? I love your poems.
I shook my head as I grabbed my coat. “John and I will take a cab.”
Uncle Rudy watches from the drawing room window. Behind him, Mycroft Holmes is curled on an old red velvet sofa with a plate of chocolate biscuits, engrossed in Churchill’s A History of the English Speaking Peoples (volume 2). Mr Holmes is in his favourite chair, reading the Telegraph, which he will follow the Lancet, and then Private Eye. Mrs Holmes is in Mummy’s Room upstairs, doing what the children affectionately call her Important Sums.
I don’t ever carry a bag so it was disconcerting to be starting at this late age.  I couldn’t see how I would end up using all of the equipment in the bag but figured it was probably better to lug the stuff all over London than to risk word getting back to the Mothers’ website. They frightened me enormously and I’m not frightened of anyone.
“Yes.”
Nothing.
“Who did that?” John asked quietly.
Sherlock watches carefully. John holds the poem in his left hand and as he reads, raises his right hand to his wounded shoulder to lightly rub the scar through his jumper.
Sherlock likes to visit people’s homes. They are a cornucopia of clues and information for him – the colours of the paint, the dust on a photo frame that hangs in the lounge room,  how recently the carpet was vacuumed, the tiny crack on the cup in which he might be handed tea. All these things speak to him in a specific language, which he can translate for the unobservant.
“Toby! He’s wonderful!”
I wasn’t convinced, but I wasn’t much interested either. I was reading the paint cans. John Watson had chosen two colours – sky and cloud.
Sherlock appears ready to implode. "Look, forget about the phones. Forget about the numbers. Focus on this: a major drug dealer is killing small time users who deal for him because they are ripping him off, or he suspects that they're ripping him off. I don't think they are, I think he has coke paranoia and is killing them in deluded rages. I don't know how many other young people have this tattoo and might be a target for these rages. I want to call him on this phone, pretend that I was the person who disturbed him while he killed her and see if I can meet him. Then you" - he points savagely at Lestrade - "can arrest him and probably get a generous increase to your division's budget."
John and I lay on our bed, fingers loosely entwined and shoulder to shoulder, staring anywhere except at each other.
“Yes. But the Prince was still an idiot and didn’t realise why. While he was away he thought about the Woodsman everyday and made plans for all the wonderful things they could do when he returned. But the Woodsman moved on. He met a pretty lady.  When the Prince came back he was too late, because the Woodsman was going to marry the pretty lady and the Woodsman was going to be her husband. The Prince realised that he – the Prince - was an even bigger idiot than he originally thought.”
"He's going to abduct me?"
I had little interest in that part of proceedings, so we were back at Baker Street in time to relieve Anya of her shift.
For he giggles.
“You had bartitsu training?”
He decides it sounds pretty much like heaven.
I never know how to respond when people ask me questions like that. I understand the social contract requires me to act calm and say yes, please, but in fact I want to smash furniture and grasp people by the shoulders and shake them until I’m certain they understand how badly I want the information.  Not that I would do that to Mrs Hudson. She already knew.
John, always the soldier, draws a breath and waits for his courage to come back. It takes a couple of seconds.
"John Watson!" says a soft, slightly rotund bespectacled man perched on a stool in front of a range of slides.
John doesn’t answer. It’s nice, wrapped in Sherlock’s arms like this. It’s never felt this nice, he realises. No lover has ever made me feel this way.
“Would you … do you want to do some experiments with me?
Their laughter rang out over the London night, and they talked for hours.
Albion chose that moment to gurgle at us both. Lestrade leaned in and gently tickled his little grape sized chin.
Sherlock weighs up his chances. "No."
I was the only sensible person in the room and took it upon myself to restore order.
“No, I’m sorry, she’s not.”
Sherlock has forwarded Julia’s name and age to Mycroft. Within two hours, details of  four possible Julias are returned, and in less than thirty minutes after that, another email arrives, this time with details of just one Julia, who was born in 1946, who grew up in Reading, and whose tax records show, most importantly, that she worked for Wridge’s Wine Imports between 1973 and 1977.
Mrs Hudson, who has lived a much more wild, and much more unpredictable life than even Sherlock can guess, is neither surprised or curious. She is happy there is another lodger in the house, and happy that Sherlock has company. That they make a bit of noise sometimes, or come and go noisily at all hours of the day and night, holds little interest for her.
The lay together quietly for a short time, twining their fingers together in the dark.
Anya was apparently rebuilding my kitchen if the clattering she caused was any indication. I deposited Albion with Mycroft, considered starting an argument with him about the nanny but deferred because it was actually brilliant to have some one to assist, and also I hadn’t had a shower for two days.
The first scene shows Mycroft, aged ten, and Sherlock, aged nearly three, waving excitedly from the door step of their grand ancient house.
A young man in a cheap shirt and a clip-on bow tie opens the door. “Good evening, Mr Holmes. Can I get anyone a drink or snacks?”
Across the road there's a tall man in a smart tracksuit with a head of grey hair streaked in shades of purple that’s been pulled back into a shaggy tail and secured with a length of sparkly elastic. The man is running across the road, oblivious to the traffic, his calls growing louder.
“Yes, I have indeed.”
“Morning, Rosie! What have you got there?”
The boat was a stroke of genius. Sherlock and Eurus become firm friends and she becomes a equal star in the game, boat or no boat. Still, Rudy is worried this happy spell might not be permanent, so he acts with caution. He makes a brief risk assessment, and decides to make some subtle changes in the house: sharp knives are moved from the drawer to the top shelf in the kitchen, and a local plumber is paid to permanently disengage the old well from the main plumbing.
That they cannot mimic the tender
“He used to. I think he replaced it with a small thermonuclear device.”
This one is definitely going to be brilliant.
“It does,” Sherlock agrees. “Strange and right.”
Molly
Sherlock lays on the couch and John kneels over him, cutting the treads carefully with new
“Well, he’s a lucky boy! You’re going to be a wonderful father, Sherlock. And just wait until Dr Watson comes back. That little boy will have the best care in the world. Now hold tight and I’ll put the kettle on.” She went over to the stove and chattered while she lit the hob. “What’s his name?”
For he can get blood off a wall.
In the second month, she took four days to learn the violin. In mere weeks she was playing Bach, and with no errors. Ludwig took copious notes as he watched Eurus teach the instrument to her brother Sherlock. She then suggested to Ludwig that she was ready to learn the cello (which she would later teach Mycroft).
Today he was all wide smiles and good intentions.
“Have you solved any yet?”
“Yes. But actually, no. It’s a story about you.”
“Apologies. Now, the Woodsman was a very honourable man. He gave his service to the Queen – that’s the stepmother – quite faithfully, and when she told him to murder the little girl, he just nodded and took the little girl to the forest.
“Flagged us?”
“Six months, three weeks and five days”.  I remember it like it was yesterday.
“Sherlock.”
“So does she prepare Albion’s bottles?”
He doesn’t answer. Honours? What honours?
Because she was brilliant and because descends from one of London's wealthiest families, Amarita was expected to make an most advantageous marriage. There was much speculation, as she continued to dazzle people with her phenomenal brain and remarkable beauty, who she would chose, or if she would even bother choosing anyone at all, given the queues of men who would have kept her company in shifts for the rest of her life.
“And I don’t want to look like the callous, lazy parent who’s rescinded all care of his child because there’s a willing participant to assist in his care.”
After fifteen minutes I thought something unwholesome had happened and went downstairs to retrieve my son and my doctor.
So John takes an idle stroll down Baker Street and, sure enough, is trailed by a black car. "Hello, Doctor Watson," says the lovely brunette in the back seat who's still thumbing her phone. "Please get in the car."
Refoveate
But John is full of surprises. When every trace of Constellation is gone, he takes Sherlock back to their bed and carefully rests a foot on his lap. He produces a blue nail file and he checks that each nail is straight and then rubs cream into each toe. Then he strokes the arch of each foot and smiles as Sherlock breathes deeply with half closed eyes.
He didn’t, mostly because he was hopelessly in love with (who he thought was) his little girl. Now that she has been swept away by a battery of social workers and seven family members (including her biological father) with bonafide legal and genetic claims on her, John Watson’s heart has been reduced to ash.
The handover is drawing to a close. Michelle is keen to visit Nana, John is keen to get the last excruciating detail of his life over and done with.
“His mother has dead straight hair. He might get hair like her.”
So while we laid there laughing at our uselessness, we started making love without any plans at all. John moved his hand under my shirt, I started kissing his throat, and with some careful moves got to the stage where we we pressing our bare chests against teach other.
Mycroft read the formula tin while rocking Albion gently. He hated that and yelled at Mycroft for being useless at rocking and at me for providing an idiot uncle.
They leave their maps on the floor and retire quickly to Sherlock’s bed.
Mrs Hudson said what we were all thinking. “Oh, he likes you, Dr Watson.”
“Ooo oo!” he said loudly, so John gave him another fingertip of plum.
Albion listened with a mixture of bewilderment and satisfaction. When I finished he sucked his fist, blinked twice and made that flat little wail he uses to let me know he’s going to start crying in earnest if one of us didn’t pick him up quickly.
One of our patients was a blacksmith - he made the name disc."
John laughs despite himself. "With a lawyer and a warlock who never stop copulating."
Everyone in the room made exactly the same face at the same time. Ms Powers looked at me with assured conviction that I should be sectioned.
Now, at 72, the hair's cut short and her dresses more modest but she still works prodigious hours, still travels the world to address conferences, is still the last word in grafting of arteries, the use of anti-coagulants in valve replacements, best practice in preventing rejection of transplants in the first 36 hours and still a member of the core team who are now developing the first artificial heart made from synthetic tissue that mimics human muscle.
"You can't wear pyjamas to dinner."
They’re actually like little flatmates. They have expectations and requirements, and they take up a lot of space. In fact, adult flatmates are actually much easier to live with, largely because they can tell you what they want or explain how you’re disappointing them. Babies require you to deduce.
“Yes. He is my partner and my colleague and my best friend.”
He has long legs too. I’ve calculated that if he grows at the normal rate, he should attain a full height of six foot one.
“The thing is, you can’t discount it.”
“Ah, Dr Watson, Sherlock. I’ve brought you a useful gift.”
“She knew I would hunt her down for Ollie, and that would have exposed her, him and the whole family. I think she planned to stick around for a few years and have the marriage break up naturally.”
They are still too new, too raw, to watch as they hold their hearts to one another.
And Bonnie – well, who knows? She’s already displaying signs of an extroverted personality, but there is no way to guess what kinds of things are waiting for her in the future playgrounds and classrooms. All we can do, I’ve learnt, is love her fiercely and accept, despite all I was taught, that caring is an advantage.
He looked at me doubtfully so I inched over just a little and  slipped my finger in one his hands.
"No, calm down, I’m not trying to set you up. Ademar's a tom. A really good one who looks just like an accountant. Actually, he was an accountant before the bank retrenched him. Turned out to be much better at tomming. He's not like your ordinary tom though, all blow dried and wearing tight pants. He's a special tom, does all kinds of therapy with you. Works miracles."
“Of course, “ says Sherlock. “Or we’ll call you if we discover anything sooner.”
"You're a warlock?"
He's standing at the entrance, wondering how on earth Sherlock - or indeed anyone - would know of this place. It smells of concrete and smoke and excrement and something dead. Like the other place, the walls are covered with graffiti and there are countless spray cans scattered all over the floor, their small silvery glints available to John as far as he can see. From the foyer area where he stands, John can see there are two - no, make that three - main floor spaces divided by plaster walls that have been gouged and kicked at for years.
And there's Sherlock, his face aching, staring down at the meaty blasted head and then at his shirt, amazed that not one drop, not a single, minute drop of blood, has stained him.
When he gets home to the empty house he turns on all the lights and walks straight to his room and starts packing.
“Does he have a sword in that thing?” John asked.
“Your qualifications are irrelevant. If I had given you an order, you would have been obliged to follow it. And I’m a medical doctor. I would have been on par with you, professionally.”
"Oh! You actually live here?"
My entire village agreed that assembling toys is the eighth circle of hell. Nothing fits and the manual is apparently written to make the whole process as difficult as possible.
Colin the warlock has facts at his fingertips. "Oh, and this is Rhonda. She's not ours, the first guy who lived here left her behind when he moved out and we haven't got around to getting rid of her. Are you cool with cats? Only the last chick was allergic and didn't get on with Rhonda AT ALL."
However, such projection was of no more concern to me. I was more interested in the paint.
Magazines like the Reader’s Digest occasionally run stories making pointless claims that babies and toddlers find drowning quite pleasant because they don’t struggle. I have tried frequently to go back in my mind palace to see if that is true but with no luck. All I can recover is the colour of the water as I stood on the edge of the pool, and that there were no frogs.
John's not sure what he's supposed to say. Sherlock continues.
These cards were, of course, a response to my miserable claims before he left all those months ago.
As they walked through the main entrance of the grand hospital, John shared some idle observations about squirrel tails – how they look so thick but in close view are actually composed of very fine, strategically coloured fur.
That’s when it bursts in his heart, the things he wants to say, the question he wants Sherlock to answer for both of them.
I've got it! Oh. Bugger. No, I haven't."
On Saturday morning, while Sherlock is pacing his flat in his pyjamas trying to work out why he hasn't caught the Broken Beer Bottle Killer, John is carefully preparing the cat cage.
John stands up, drains his tea quickly and leans over to kiss the side of Sherlock’s face. “Because you’re brilliant. And very sexy.”
John and Lestrade had taken an excursion to a hardware store together. I had been invited but turned down this opportunity so I could stay and admire Albion, who could now hold his head up by himself.
Soon the scars on Sherlock’s back will fade into pale pink weals; John no longer twitches at the mention of St Barts.
Sherlock hasn't flinched. This is brilliant, he thinks happily.
“You are needing to have blood food in the morning or you won’t awaken correctly,” Anya warned me. “Stews are good for the blood.”
"If I had any idea I wouldn't be here drinking this coffee-stained milk drink." He reaches over and tosses the cup into the large bin. "Good to see you again, Bob. Give my love to your family."
“Right.” John is slipping his jacket back on. “Well, I’ll be walking. I’ll see you later.”
From John’s answers, I was able to work out that Lestrade and another detective, Sally Donovan, were at the warehouse, inspecting containers connected to the case we assisted on earlier in the day.
And John exploded.
“Well, what can we do,” Mr Holmes says with mild boredom, not looking up. “The psychologists are still trying to devise a plan for her. No school wants her – she already knows more than any of the teachers.” He folds the paper, places it neatly on the side table, and reaches for the Lancet. “Best let her play in the meantime.”
“Albion John Watson Holmes. It sounds good, doesn’t it?”
He doesn't feel awkward, extraneous, unwelcome or anxious.
I know a fantastic restaurant down near the dock in Surat Thani in Thailand. I did the owner an enormous favour six years ago. I would love for John to try the seafood hot pot there. With me.
“Romance! You said I’m never romantic! Balloons are romantic. I saw it in Cosmopolitan. They go with chocolates.”
I have four, but one was a mva accident and is ruptured.
"Are you really a doctor?"
John thought for moment. He was licking salt from his thumb and it was unexpectedly attractive.
“Were they idiots?”
“Does the nanny live here?”
John, who as an intern, once delivered five babies in ninety minutes despite not having slept for sixteen hours, is trying, he really is. He has become a permanent fixture in his mind-numbing job and now, at the suggestion of his therapist, is moving out of the ugly cloud grey walls of his miserable subsidised flat to live amongst ordinary people.
“No. Shut up. The Prince lived with the Woodsman and they had the most wonderful times together. The Prince was still an idiot but the Woodsman was so patient, and he liked all the trouble the Prince got into and generally they had a marvelous time, until they met another Prince who was very evil and tried to kill them both.”
"I start that way, and then I look for the where the evidence might be that supports those clues."
Sherlock thinks about this while John watches his thought process. “Guilt?” John asks.
“No, he’s just naturally angry, like a highland terrier. He really loved the flat. He kept looking around and I wanted him to say yes so badly. I’m never like that with people. I didn’t even need a flatmate. I don’t know why I chose him. I just liked him when I saw him.”
“It’s my intention to make you as happy as I can.”
We took him home two days after he was born. Adrienne was still completely uninterested. She refused to hold him and refused to feed him, preferring to play some squeaking game on her phone instead.
(I was never invited to these outings because Three Pints Are Enough Watson believed I didn’t like the pub. Which is flagrantly untrue. I would take a seat next to John Watson in hell if it meant I had his full attention.)
“See, this is why I share your bed,” John tells him when he’s finished.
Molly is awkwardly wrestling her arms into a red coat. “He just won’t stay still! He’s been jumping all over the furniture, he’s messed up my bed three times, knocked over a vase and then the washing, and now he won’t get off the curtains. I don’t know what’s wrong with him.”
Conclusion: John Watson had endured a lot.
But it’s always been like that for us. Five years ago, he moved in with me after one brief meeting. We had known each other for twenty four hours when he killed a man he believed threatened my safety. We were fast friends almost from the moment we met.
I've got you a head! It has hair exactly like yours.
John feels for the boy. He has had boys not much older in his command. He has been one. He knows how hard it is. John speaks with a pleasant smile as Sherlock rolls his eyes.
"Oh, so you are a doctor," John says with a little smile.
Sherlock places his cup on the coffee table and swings forward, grabs his coat and pushes past John as he storms out the door.
Today I marry true
“No, no,” John lifts his hand and drops his gaze, “You’re being scary again.”
John moves imperceptibly to Sherlock’s side.  Sherlock lifts his chin and meets the father’s glare.
“But was she using before that?” the doctor asked.
Sherlock is curdling with embarrassment. Billy, a kindly soul when he's not hell bent on garroting someone, is considering Sherlock’s issues when he suddenly understands the real problem.
There is so much detail about John to absorb, indentify, label and file. Sherlock sniffs as he catalogues the different scents that emanate from John – denser, more potent scents at his armpits and groin, finer, more transparent scents at his throat and hands. The curiously milky fragrance of his hair. When he’s got them organised, he starts excavating a small area of confusion in his mind palace and begins to build a John Sex room.  He puts the helix spiral staircase from the Chateau de Chambord in the centre.
“Don’t torture me,” I said through barely open teeth. “Do you like the sex? Am I doing properly?”
He packs his deflated wallet, phone and laptop in the larger box.
The father is angry at his son, angry at Sherlock and angry at what he knows is the right moral position. He wisely chooses not to take it out on Sherlock and turns to John instead.
They wrapped my baby up like a brandy snap and very carefully put him in my arms.
"I'm alright," the stranger says, but he steadies himself against John and is a little wobbly on his feet for a second or two.
“Then the Woodsman took the heart home to the wicked stepmother, who was an even bigger idiot we initially thought, because obviously a little girl’s heart would have been smaller than a boar’s heart. Unless of course the Woodsman trimmed it somewhat.”
When he takes his face away Sherlock doesn’t even blink, but instead leans back in and kisses him again.
Mummy turns to Papa. “I could stay there for a few months. I’m pretty certain Iris has a place there.” (She refers to her sister Iris, who seems to have houses and apartments everywhere, yet steadfastly stays in London because she doesn’t like foreign food. She won’t even go to Manchester.)
“You’re taking this very seriously,” Sherlock observes.
The bird sits resolutely in corner of the box. He has an idea what's coming.
Renzo is all arms and dramatic gestures, adamant that he'll provide the beer too. You can't have pizza without beer, he insists.
John smiled as he extracted a grabby little hand from his hair. “It does.”
Sherlock is crouched on his haunches, staring quite intently at a deep puddle of coagulated arterial blood. Detective Inspector Lestrade is standing above him holding a large ready lamp that casts a wide yellow light over the most recent murder scene.
Sherlock is about to apologise, to remind John that he loves little Watson as much as John does, but there is no need. John knows and now, here on the floor after so many years of grief and trauma and fights and resolution,  there is no purpose in rehashing that. There is only one person who wants to keep Rosie safe with the same combative fierceness that John does, only one person who sees no inconvenience in bath time, cutting manageable little sandwiches, holding the grumpy toddler until she sleeps and balancing these tedious tasks with his own life.
"I'd really prefer it if you didn't...I'm not ..."
Sherlock presses his lips together tightly before he answers. "Yes, Doctor Watson was married over a year ago, but they’ve split up and now he’s back at Baker Street.  How did you know?"
He spreads both hands appreciatively across Sherlock’s back and feels him puff with the compliment.
"There was an explosion," Sherlock half grunts in to the warm dank blackness.
Sherlock waits for him to open his eyes but John won’t, so he takes his another deep breath.
He crouches before the stranger again and takes both his arms. "Can you stand up for me?"
It wasn't that she told him that brainy was the new sexy because he'd known that for years and in every case had cause to capitalise on that very fact to varying extents of appreciation.
John laughs and reaches for his hand. “You did not.”
Greg responds appropriately. “How do you do.”
“When?” I had no idea what she meant. Did she think we designed cities together?
John flops on his back, giggling behind his knuckles when Sherlock returns with a bottle of hair conditioner.
Lestrade and I talked mostly about crimes. There had been a couple of significant arrests in a very large fraud matter that started just before I went on my three week drug-fuelled hiatus, and currently the team was trying to get a break through in a series of armed robberies. Lestrade wouldn’t give me any details though.
Babies are so helpless. This is one of their big selling points, in my opinion. They give you no reason to have any expectation of them and just when you have grown to understand the extent of their helplessness, they start doing things.
I had Albion to myself for three blissful days. He was the smartest baby I have ever met. I made pages of notes.
“I’ve been told you’re going to get a visit.”
(Normal people probably are filled with love all the time but until recently I have had no capacity, and no interest, in filling with love. Albion changed all that, when he carved out chambers in my heart that I never knew I had, and made it possible for me to utilise properly the love I have for John Watson. I think it’s possible that I will keep filling up with love. I’m not used to it. It feels very nice and quite frightening at the same time.)
When Molly saws open the skull, they can see a blood mass there still, powdery and brown, but perfectly preserved against shrivelled brain matter.
"I'm going to make a suggestion."
John answered first. “I did not.” Albion was trying valiantly to grip his hair and was passed back to me.
“Did you have sex?”
“Sherlock! It’s been so long!” Angelo called to me as we walked into his restaurant. “And John! And oh my God, who’s this?”
I didn’t have a pram. It hadn’t occurred to me that I would need one.
I did.
The next day, John carries his poem in his breast pocket. He reads it once on the tube and twice at his desk in between patients. He’s not a man for gushing, romantic gestures any more than Sherlock, and he’d never had cause to wonder what it might be like to be the topic of a verse.
After speaking to a mostly unhelpful headmaster and a slightly more forth coming Geography master, Sherlock has learnt the name of the possible suspect – Jeremy Dyson - and his best friend Tom.
Greg has visited so many that they are mere tunnels to him now, a site through which he must walk in the hope that there is light at the end.
Every single postcard had my name and address on the right hand side.
“Yes.” Sherlock is crisp and formal. “I have to learn the politics of topping and bottoming.”
“Ah. Excellent. Thank you, Mrs Hudson.”
“I’d rather you set fire to my hair and stamped it out.”
Mummy is raging, but Ludwig has seen enough. “Graham, shut up. You have an unnatural preoccupation with apportioning blame to mothers. No one could have guessed that Eurus was born this intelligent, or with such understanding. Of course she has emotions and feelings on par with her vast intelligence  – we established that on her second day here. In any case,  this child has not been neglected. Thousands of children have secondary carers.” Ludwig turns to  address Mummy. “You’ve had contact with her since your book was published?”
"Hello, Greg!"
“I’m Dr John Watson. I’m Albion’s doctor. If you have any inquiries about his health you can deal with me.”
“I have no idea. I like some men, and I like some women, and occasionally find myself attracted to a small percentage of both.”
There’s a bronze called Tea and Toast, a bright navy blue called Blue Coat, a murky olive with streak of gold called Cease Fire and a deep black-blood red called Man of the Moment. The names are perfect echoes of the familiar and comforting things that John and he have collected between them over the years.
Sherlock looks up from his pretty toes and extends his hand to John. “Have we met? I’m Sherlock. You might remember visiting me in hospital after I was shot in the upper abdomen.”
John keeps writing, and looks up when she pauses. Jenny closes her eyes, then says quietly, “I had a dream.”
The doctor was surprised. “Haven’t you ever done it?”
“Were cat gymnasiums popular amongst the villagers?”
It’s not a great case – Sherlock tagged it a 6 - but it’s mildly interesting and alleviates (somewhat) the frustration of Lestrade’s continued refusal to share the mystery of the four armed robberies.
It was exhausting, renewing and perfect only because it was him.
“Can he hit a target yet with a semi automatic at close range yet?”
After my family left, I settled Albion down for the afternoon and made him a promise: that he would know, every day of his life, how much his father loved him, and not, some time in his thirties, have to guess that maybe he might.
He obviously had a lot he wanted to discuss with me.
“Yes, I do.”
“Seriously? Adrienne?”
“Is that why you like them? Because I say nice things?”
“You have two days to decide if you want to the court to issue a Parental Order.”
“Or wives in general.”
John and Sherlock’s venture into romance was seamless. They knew each other so well, and had secretly guarded one another’s hearts for so long, that adapting to physical intimacy seemed like the most sensible progression.
Sherlock pointedly would not reveal anything to Mycroft about his relationship with Dr Watson. John would only ever say that he really wasn't sure. Still, Mycroft wished them well and hoped for Sherlock's sake that the Doctor was as loyal and sensible as he appeared. He had no illusions that John entered into their financial agreements wholly sponsored by Sherlock; he kept the payments up for three months to help them establish a little nest egg and enjoy a few treats.
I was a little embarrassed. “Yes. I meant to tell you.  Actually thought I might amend it slightly.”
“Washington is very close to New York. I must have got confused.” Mycroft gave me his most oleaginous smile.
After being exposed as a woeful raspberry blower, breakfast was in order. “I’ll make the tea if you want to do the formula,” John suggested tentatively.
“Then why do you need to learn it?”
"Were your parents there?"
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
Sherlock chooses a night when the moon is waxing, only because it looks more interesting as it is growing larger.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft began, “I need to confirm that everything on this birth notice from the hospital is correct.”
I knew just the place.
"FRIGGING hurts? Frigging? Where's that from?"
Just as he starts to lose awareness of his surroundings, he can feel a careful hand unfastening his trousers. Sherlock keeps very still, curious as to what may happen and, if he’s honest with himself, not unwilling to enjoy a bit of fondling.
“Such a lovely day,” Mycroft said, staring at the low clouds over London. “I do believe I’ll walk back to my office.”
"Nocturne!" he declares, and then he shuffles off back to his study.
“It’s more fun to guess.”
John tilts his eyebrows. “Absorbing?”
"They pay my expenses. And yes, I have received payment, or payment in kind, for services rendered to private clients." Sherlock is carefully lifting the lingual vein from the tongue. John watches and can see that someone has taught him basic surgery techniques.
Then she told me that her boyfriend was going to kill me unless I gave him eighty thousand pounds to raise the baby. That sounded like a lot.
"Beakley!" a couple of the little kids cry.
“Captain,” John said softly, as he bent over to kiss Albion goodbye.
And Sherlock, when he looks down he sees John – John, who makes him tea, who talks with him every day, who is always concerned for his wellbeing, who slips a protective arm over him in his sleep, who follows him to crime scenes in case he has to shoot anyone – John, staring at him with eyes heavy with love.
Sherlock is growing warm and heavy. John strokes the curls until he falls asleep.
I filled my mouth with chips so I didn’t have to answer.
It had never been my intention to have a partner, much less a family, but I’d never counted on finding my heart.
“You’re right. The heart is in fact a muscle and made of very dense fibre. The Woodsman would need to have a steady hand. John Watson could trim a heart. He is a doctor and a soldier and my best friend. If there were boars in London, and John Watson has come home, you won’t ever have to worry about being attacked or indeed anything because he will fight to the death to protect you.
Sherlock pounds a sticky dough while John tells him about a swollen trachea, a perfectly split heel, two broken fingers that were an astonishing shade of teal and a new baby with an inflamed belly button.
Adrienne went to bed as soon as we got home, in the former Watson room. She was texting someone, and talking on the phone with someone, so I imagine the drug lord who was going to kill me would be coming around for his eighty grand soon.
Some of the cold cases were destined to never grow warm again.
John is rapt, leaning over the table on his folded arms, finger hooked through the cup handle, watching Sherlock deduce something unimportant with the same vigour he analyses crimes scenes.
“You’ll hear it on the day. It will be a surprise.” John’s smile is enigmatic.
It wasn't that she was smarter. It wasn't that she stabbed him with a syringe full of decidedly cheap opiate and furnished him senseless for five hours. She was smarter but it transpired he was smarter after all and he out smarted her eventually. It wasn't that.
He needs 75. Each thin golden thread is placed carefully in one of Sherlock's stolen petrie dishes.
"Are you going to tell me my fortune?"
Half-a-wife Watson is one of the most patient men I know. He has  forgiven his treacherous wife a wide range of transgressions, including lying about everything about her life pre-Watson, shooting me, two affairs and losing her wedding ring on a rifle range.  Lesser men would have walked away long ago.
“Oh, you’re sure to have a great time. Do give my regards to Angelo, if he’s on tonight.”
"I will."
Of course. Home later. And yes, a cup of tea would be lovely. Milk no sugar. SH
“I have no idea what you’re talking about but I think you should stop reading women’s magazines.”
Sadly it was just a gas leak, and not a fiendishly clever explosion cleverly designed to look like the kind of explosion a gas leak might cause but that would be apparent to a genius, or a very competent forensic pyrotechnic expert, to be an act of deliberate sabotage.
John is leaning over the papers, his finger on the 1969 plan, pointing, randomly, to the pagoda. “So you think that Julia travelled directly from the airport to the house in Enfield, stole the girl and then buried her somewhere at the wine office?”
“Well, the lab manager came back from lunch with a Woodsman, who was apparently an old friend of his.”
So, he says to himself, that's that sorted. Time to make plans. Bird first.
For he can heal their sores.
Sherlock’s curiousity trumps shyness and he reaches out to runs the pad of his thumb over John’s umbilical scar.
“Seriously? You honestly don’t know?” Sherlock looks at him blankly so John explains.  “They were English poets who lived for romance in all its form. Shelley? Keats? Ring a bell?”
John, who used to be able to insert canulas in low light relying primarily on his sense of touch, is enjoying a large cup of too-hot coffee on his second last day. His hand is relatively still and his leg doesn't feel too bad.
The doctor was unfazed by this distinctly unromantic setting and giggled when he should have been swooning. (He is the only man I have ever met who giggles. He can produce a perfectly ordinary masculine laugh when the situation requires it, but when he’s with me, and I’ve caused him amusement, he giggles. It is nothing short of delectable.)
John is a little nervous about the whole notion. Sherlock nips it in the bud.
"Yeah but - did you call some one? Who?"
And  I still love him.
“I hate surprises. Surprises are boring. I need to be prepared, John. Will you at least tell me where you hid it?”
So maybe things are looking up.
“Sherlock’s very well,” is all the doctor says. “It says here you have chest pains.”
"Well, I'm a doctor. An army doctor. I served in Afghanistan for six, nearly seven years."
Sherlock is spooning tea leaves into the pot. “No. You wanted a public declaration and I am determined to give you one. In any case, people who turn up at weddings make investments, John, and they expect a return.”
"It's going to take time to adjust."
realise was vital for my performance
“Did the Prince like him?”
“So the mirror started telling the wicked stepmother that Snow White was prettier. The wicked stepmother was an idiot, so she told her Woodsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her, and bring back her heart as proof of her death. Although in real life, the wicked stepmother would have done it herself. I’ve seen several murders by stepmothers, and they have all been very capable murderesses and not all that wicked on first meeting.”
“Did she shoot anyone else?” Ademar wonders.
On the eleventh night of these circuitous thoughts, John turns on his bedside lamp, swings his legs over the bed and fossicks through his medical kit. He has a small tub of sorbolene, which is not quite what he wants but it will do for the moment.
Eurus sits up. “But I love it!” she says.
“Do you want a lift?” Lestrade asked.
“You most certainly have a sock index. I can make you a real one if you like.” Sherlock’s eyes grow brighter still as one of his most treasured dreams comes tantalizingly close. “You know John, if you want to sleep in here, share this room with me, I could make us a COMBINED sock index.” He talks as if he’s offering the Hope diamond.
“Oh, and I just remembered that I didn’t tell you why they called her Snow White but you’re asleep now. Still. The Queen – the real one, not the fool who couldn’t stop staring at her self in the mirror – pricked her finger and dripped some blood on the snow, and told the air that she wanted a daughter just like that – white and red. Which is ridiculous.
“Absolutely. He was an enormous help. He always provides invaluable assistance on every case we do together. He’s a an experienced and very skilled doctor, and he acts like a conductor of light.”
"I'm alright," the injured man says rudely but it comes out as a whoosh and a soft bouquet of blood droplets that fall in a mist across John's jumper.
“What?” everyone else says.
Sometimes when he wrote, tears would burn for a moment, and he would take a breath to hold them in, just as Mycroft taught him.
"Good evening, Anderson." Sherlock pushes past him and John follows, looking down.
“Have you booked him into school yet?”
John is already halfway up the stairs.
Sherlock is still and silent so John tries another tact.
The sad corpse, when he is finally visible, is the only person of interest to Sherlock amongst this large group of chattering people. John offers the greetings and hears out Lestrade’s scant briefing.
“They had a house and had chores and went to the park and had messes but lived happily ever after,” he smiled. “Like us.”
She batted him again. Captain, I'm hungry. I have no thumbs. I think there 's a cooked chicken in the kitchen. Could you help?
"What happened to your face? Did someone finally punch you?"
“On the projector.” Mummy takes a deep breath.  “Now. The doctors have told me that you have been sad because when you were a tiny baby, I was busy writing a book and didn’t bond with you the way I should’ve. They’ve said that you have a very high intelligence, and a very sensitive heart, and this means you need as much love and attention as you do intellectual stimulation.”
But great cleverness doesn't guarantee you perfect performances in every area of life: Amarita is a lousy cook, an appalling accountant, an irresponsible driver, can't carry a tune, fails to keep up with daily news, can't remember people's names, phone numbers or where she put her keys, is uninterested in ironing, indifferent to housework generally and was frankly a pretty disinterested mother, at least until her boys had grown up, left home and started fending for themselves.
“Is it a manual?”
“He really likes that.”
Lestrade sniggers as he eats his sandwich (roast lamb and salad on thick white bread, no butter but lots of mustard) and continues.
Sherlock texted his best friend, only to get a response in which John claimed to be tired and have an early morning tomorrow and sorry, you’ll have to solve it by yourself.
He blinks and tilts his head as a headlight burns his eye for a second. It's a scooter, something plexiglass and light, and it clips a man who is rushing out of a doorway to cross the street and the man trips, falls face first and cries out or swears.
“She’d finished work for the day” –
It’s my belief that sex is subversive because you temporarily abandon all your allegiances for a few futile moments of unchallenged pleasure. It was John Watson though who taught me that the real act of rebellion is love making, touching and pleasuring someone only because you love them and to not do that is denying your lover something glorious that you can’t bear them to be denied.
I had, she screamed at me, ruined everything.
John and Sherlock are silent, each surveying the street from which Mariah was snatched, looking at the single clue that a random stranger seems to have sheared from her.
Eurus was, Ludwig wrote in a private diary, one of a kind and possibly even the first of her kind.
Mycroft made a sort of sympathetic face at me, which would have been effective had Albion not belched again quite loudly.
Sherlock is trying to multiply his family’s intelligence to grasp the enormity of this issue. Eurus, still holding Sherlock, looks up from the embrace to address Mycroft. “Intelligence is a concept, Myckie, and you can’t quantify it so you can’t measure it with a sum.”
It’s all over little too soon. The pleasure mounts and peaks with ridiculous speed. Sherlock wants to grab something to keep himself steady and in his mind reaches for John’s shoulders and this lets him see John’s fair head dipping in and out of his lap, the hot sensation flushing through his veins and settling on his skin like ashes from a fire as he comes quickly, mouth open and head turned to one side, silent and endlessly grateful.
(“It was the only time I’ve seen it,” Ademar said to Billy Kinkaid a few weeks later when he visiting him in prison. “It was bi boy pain!”
"Brilliantly. What are you going to do after this?"
“Good boy,” I said proudly. “He is especially good at digesting,” I assured the judge.
John has bent down with some discomfort to retrieve the paper. His heart sinks as he reads the position for a manager of sales team in a pharmaceutical company. "I can't do this," he says miserably but Beverly is already cooing over the phone at someone in the pharmaceutical company
John smiles and squeezes the long fingers. “I always says, ‘Sherlock, you are sublime” when I speak to you but it’s usually subtext.”
"You want a take out?"
I made Mycroft make the tea.
It was obvious that Mycroft was wondering when I might start working cases again.
In their early days Sherlock felt like a trespasser when he touched John so intimately but now, confident and adoring, he feels growing ownership of John’s body, and with that comes a greed specific to a close couple, the rigid unwillingness to share.
“Daddy! I’ve got a thwee bee!”
After feeding one another pizza and some slightly greasy nuzzling, Sherlock shows John all he knows about oral sex while simultaneously opening a file about John’s penis in his mind palace. John reciprocates by showing Sherlock exactly how potent the prostate gland can be. When they finish, they squabble over the etiquette of swallowing (“If you swallow, you should make a production of it so your partner can see, John”) and who should go and make the cups of tea.
It is too much for Jeremy who, on hearing his pitiful plight made clear, breaks down in tears.
We both laughed, me because Mycroft only swears about every eight years and when he does it always sounds hilarious, and John because he was delighted to hear himself described this succinctly by a man who is so difficult to impress.
“Why didn’t Lestrade call me?”
“Forgive my rudeness. Do come in.”
“Was there any reason why I didn’t get a post card?”
And he smiled at me.
“It’s beautiful,” John says, and Sherlock smiles.
“It’s been a big day for him,” I said. “He had his first solids today too. Tell Uncle Mycroft what stewed plums taste like.”
“Well, keep your eyes closed and imagine that I’m John doing this.”
“Can he lift his head yet?”
Gradually the words and the long easy strokes become intertwined.
“I’m collecting bricks,” he says with guileless sincerity.
"Oh you," says a tall beaky looking man with nasty little eyes who's standing at the main doorway. "Should have guessed you'd be here."
“She is,” Sherlock responds with a gentle voice. “She’ll warm up as she gets to know you. Can I ask you – is it – are you comfortable telling me about the day Mariah disappeared?”
Sherlock reaches back and awkwardly pulls John over to lay beside him. It's not comfortable, but sometimes, John figures, you have to make allowances and adjustments to be together.
that he stole from Charlotte's room and lined with newspaper and punched with tiny holes before filling it with the little African Love Bird.
Clothes maketh the woman not, however. Adrienne looked better but she was still the same woman.
But that wasn’t the best part.
Mycroft came to visit the next day. I was lying on my couch, reading about solid foods with Albion curled up like a hibernating dormouse and asleep on my chest, when he slunk in. He has a key but I never hear him use it.
Both culprits looked up at me - John with his smile, Albion with slight disappointment for interrupting what was apparently a very entertaining event for him.
He is the part I was missing but failed to
Diseased or clean?
I was denied access to the room while it was being painted, partly because John wanted it to be a surprise, but mostly so I wouldn’t interfere with the paint. I was actually more interested in interfering with John Watson, who kept appearing at odd times in very old jeans and a t-shirt that seemed to be held together by mere molecules of cotton, all daubed with swipes of sky-coloured paint that matched the shade of his eyes exactly.
John was not a man for letting the grass grow under his well-shod feet. He re-instated his furniture and possessions in less than twenty-four hours.
It grows dark and his time is near.
And then another door to a room in his head flies open and Sherlock rushes from the room where he thinks of John and storms in to the room where he's keeping the current case and stamps around in a frustrated fury, wondering how he might keep himself alive this time.
“Will he be vaccinated soon?”
More wounding was that evidence that John didn’t think his mate was romantic and scoffed at the notion he could be.
“No defensive wounds.”
“Sort of. It made it very easy to be a consulting detective. Anyway, one day Gilroy rang him up and told him about a murder where the body had specks of dried green paint on it. So the Prince went over to Bart’s to do some tests on paint and blood, and got talking to the Lab manager, and told him that he had a new flat and the lab manager asked if he was living alone and the Prince said, who’d want a flat mate like me? The lab manager just shrugged his shoulders and went out to lunch.”
“So when will you visit Harry?”
John holds his gaze for several long seconds. He wants to ask about the violin because it's such a wonderful thing to learn about a person this strange, but it's not what comes out.
“Congratulations. Do you mind if we do a blood test, just to be sure?”
And then he adds his mobile number.
He hates getting out of bed in the morning because he is exhausted from patchy sleep and he has to leave the house, and that means he has to walk past Charlotte and her warlock and it's likely they'll be at it like rabbits.
Sherlock is in full flight, hands flaying. “Oh! What a great idea. Discuss my ignorance about my homosexuality with three continents not gay Watson! Forgive my naivety but why would I do that?”
The files date back to the late 1940s.  John has spoken to the archivist, and she has emailed him 147 case numbers that she thinks might be of interest. All of them have been keyworded carefully with words related to specific evidence. In this instance, the common keyword is shoe.
John leans against the wall and breaths through his mouth. His eyes feel salty. Oh, is all he can say. Oh. He waits until the pools in his eyes have subsided before he goes into 221b.
"So you grew up in the country?"
It was very exciting. John and I were almost giddy when we came out of the Judge’s chambers.
“In an ideal society, the state should provide his toys,” Anya noted.
Wrong.
“Oh! Well, don’t you be leaving gravelly bits in my carpet. Hello, John love. Nothing for you, I’m afraid.”
“Well, not exactly, no.” I couldn’t believe that I didn’t have any toys for him.
Greg looks at Sherlock, who has given given any indication that he knows Greg is here. He addresses Greg without moving his eyes from the lens while simultaneously lifting his phone from his pocket.
Later that afternoon, when Albion was yelling at me for being an idiot for not being  able to settle him down, Mrs Hudson, apparently home from Albuquerque, knocked on my door.
“What did she sing?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah but how is he calling them?"
"You have sprig marks on your back. " And when John is none the wiser, "There are very small indentations on your back from where you have been trampled underneath people wearing sprig toed boots. The most likely positions for being caught in the bottom of a scrum are the front row, or the fly half after feeding a scrum. You're not a front rower. A winger doesn't get trampled as much. Am I right?"
“Is she working for you full time?”
“Apparently.”
John rushes over to him without thinking.
"They kicked you off the team for that?"
John had so looked forward to Sherlock’s snark when he came home but Sherlock, it seemed, didn’t care.
The tension in his body is fascinating. Sherlock strokes it, feels it clamping all John's muscles, weaving tight lines across the powerful muscles on his shoulder, forming a hard wall on his stomach, flickering through his hand as a tremor.
(my John)
"What did you do?"
"But it's wrong!"
Can use a firearm
“After we’d conducted some experiments,” I added.
John shudders, teeth clenched and when his body stills he realises he has ejaculated without actually penetrating Shona but it makes no difference because she seems to have passed out.
We walked down to the park in the late afternoon light. Albion was strapped to me in his recently acquired baby sling, and John and I bumped hands. We weren’t one of those gregarious couples who chomped away at one another’s faces on the tube, but found subtle displays of public affection – like bumping hands - to be very satisfying.
“I know you let her win,” I whispered in his ear and I could feel his body straighten and strengthen as the muscles in his back grew taut. “Damn straight I did,” he whispered back.
“Mycroft. It was a couple of days before I came home.”
“It’s an ulcerated sore,” she explains. The nurse comes to dress it, but I never know what time.”
John holds out one hand to placate his friend or maybe to just steady himself. “No, I didn’t – Sherlock, no. No. I’m not judging you. Not at all. I’m just curious to hear – well, you’ve never displayed any interest in relationships at all. Now you’ve got painted toenails and straight boy pain. And who is this Ademar exactly? What is he telling you?”
“You made food for us?”
“Sherlock!” he hears someone call from across the road. “Sherlock!”
The nurse looks up for the first time.
It was perfectly plausible. He sent the cash over in unmarked bills.
"Oh, hello, Rhonda. Should you be in here?"
John thinks for a second. "Yes." and then he remembers something that all partners do when their mate is in trouble. "Is he going to be alright?"
“So did he become a consulting detective?”
"No, but Sherlock's not the marrying kind. You know what he's like. Russia one week, Rutherford the next. He hasn't got time to get to get married."
John turns to approach this sensitive topic the way he might counsel a patient who has waited too long to seek treatment for a simple ailment. He’s about to offer sweet-non threatening encouragement but he’s a good doctor who learnt early to treat the patient and not the disease, so discards his pre-packaged salve takes a leap to lay it all, scrambled and straight from his heart, at Sherlock’s feet.
“Yes?” Ademar says politely when finds John at his doorstep.
The dark head shakes sadly. “No. I couldn’t do that to you now. I – no. I love you.”
Sherlock solved it in four hours and deliberately stamped around the flat when he got home so that John would still be tired tomorrow.
He pushed his way through the crowd without another word.
John has to think about it too. It takes a couple of seconds before he smiles.
“”Oh! Oh.” The Judge shuffled her papers. “So you  - actually, what did you do?”
Upstairs, the allegedly heterosexual and irrefutably sad John slowly disrobed and hung up his date clothes. He had waited all night for Sherlock to disrupt his date. He checked his phone thirty three times, and when he wasn’t doing that his eyes darted towards the door of the restaurant, hardly hearing what Fiona was saying.
John has pulled over a small stool, and sits in front of her. He works without instruction, pulling latex gloves over his hands and lifting the heavy leg to his knee, unpeeling the bandage carefully.
Matron leans over to pat Rhonda too. "Oh yes, those kinds of things are very popular projects.
“No. She got bored during the performance and just got up and left me there.”
Sherlock clasps the dish in his hand. He's about to steal it. "Interesting. Now where are my flaky corpses?"
John has no idea. “Are you coming?”
The mouse, it turns out, is fine, just utterly resigned to the futility of life. John picks it up carefully and, as far as his medical skills allow, can see no injury or even trauma. He wonders if the mouse didn't just throw itself in the path of Rhonda in a deliberate attempt at self harm.
“The moral of the story is don’t get a stepmother, which you don’t have to worry about because I’ll never bring home a stepmother. The other, more important moral is to trust the Woodsman with your life because he’ll keep you safe.
