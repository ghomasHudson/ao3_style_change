“Please eat up, but I am afraid you need to soon be going. Here take my purse. May it help you on your way.”
Voices. Many, many voices. In all the languages in the world. So he goes to the source. Humans. That he didn't expect. Humans don't belong in the Empty.
His kiss was hot and loving. His hands on Dean's face angling it as he wishes. Dean looks like he is drunk when Castiel stops enough to look at his beloved.
Castiel says goodbye to the angels returning to heaven. Knowing that he would likely never see them again. He would not be welcome among them. But he got the chance to beg for forgiveness of those who had lost their lives because or by his hand. He mostly got it. It is hard to be mad at the guy who gives them their life back.
Dean loved when Castiel took the lead. Castiel loved exploring Dean's body. Kissing his way over Dean's freckles. Telling Dean what he liked. Making Dean emitting sounds of absolute pleasure.
When they later than usual joined most of the crew at breakfast. They all went silent. Before Crowley yelled out.
"I forgive you, brother. I see how much pain my death has given you. I would gladly stay by your side if you will have me. Keeping humanity safe"
His older brothers Michael and Gabriel were fighting for the Confederate side. They had no other choice when they were young and strong men. So Castiel had prayed every day for his brothers safe return. But soon came the day when the war was no longer a thing happening far away. Castiel and Dr Alistair were drafted as field doctors. The sturdy walls of the hospital were exchanged by tents or invading someone's home. Putting down a door on someone's dining room table, to save the table from the blood and the bone saw. The days melted together. All days and nights were filled with blood, pus, fevers, moans, screams, crying and death. Castiel had hated walking around the new soldiers coming in from the battle. He felt like an angel of death. Going around and deciding whom they would try to save. Who could wait. And who of the soldiers was dead, even if they were breathing still. This was something he had been doing daily for months and months. But when he lay down his head down for some well earned sleep, doubt filled his heart. Had he made the right calls? Had someone that  could have survived, died because of him?
When they returned to the hospital Alistair started to show Castiel the Room and his subjects. The poor prisoners of war, runaway slaves and others. Those who won't be missed. All the ones Alistair had for experiments.
"You!" the hissing voice of himself makes him turn. It was quite rude of the Empty using his face when it speaks to him.
Dean nods slightly and takes a swig of his beer, emptying it. He reaches across the bed and sets in on the bedside table. There is a framed picture of Dean, Cas and Sam on his nightstand, Dean studies it for a moment, expression unreadable.
Dean stands in the middle of the library of the bunker. His home. Honestly, he doesn't know what this place is to him anymore. A prison, filled with memories of what he once was, a human. He doesn't feel human now. He's a monster in his own head. But this Dean would never admit to that. Maybe if he was different he would. He sees a pile of ruined books lay ahead of him. Scattered all around into a great high pyramid.
Cas hesitates for a moment, debating whether he should be honest with Dean and tell him all the struggles he's had to face with becoming human again for him and hasn't talked about yet. Debating whether he should admit to Dean that he is the reason he didn't want to be an angel anymore, that he wanted to know what it's like to truly feel human emotion and grow old with his two closest best friends. Debating whether he should mention how devestatingly beautiful Dean looks right now with his hair ruffled up all askew from a long day and his shirt unbuttoned with a trace of wrinkles to it and the faint crease in between his eyebrows when he's deep in thought.
There is a soft knock at his door, Cas is so engrossed in his thoughts he doesn't hear it at first, only catches the movement of the door opening and Dean poking his head in.
Dean tears his eyes from Cas, clearing his throat, he lays his laptop onto the table in front of him, “Hey Sammy, you actually got something?”
“Look, Cas, you are just overthinking it. It’s really not that difficult. You just gotta lay down and get comfortable. Maybe try some yoga? Take a hot bubble bath? You just gotta relax.” Dean says to Cas as they walk out of the CVS a few miles from the bunker. Cas carries a bag with different brands of sleeping pills, teas, and something called lavender lotion? Aromatherapy?
“Guys-“ He cuts himself off, struggling to find the right words he wants to say. “This is all we got so far. I don’t think we will get much information without going out there and checking it out ourselves. We’ve done all we can from here; let’s get off our asses and go figure this out.” Sam looks between the two before turning to Cas specifically. “Cas, these are teenagers. Imagine if Claire wasn’t a hunter and this happened to her. You would want to know what the hell it was.”
It's all so tedious and time sensitive. But being here, with Dean and Sam. It makes all this suffering and searching for his true purpose worth it. Dean is worth it. Dean is the reason he decided to carve out his grace and tie a balloon to it, his grace soaring thousands of feet in the air like he once would himself, never to be seen again.
"Oh, you are awake. Thought maybe you were already gone and dreaming on me." Dean laughs softly and shuts the door behind him.
“How’s Cas?” He asked looking up at Dean with sad worried eyes. “He seemed pretty spooked about this case last night. What’s up with that?”
"I'm the one that will have to watch you murder the world. So if there's even a small chance that we can save you, I won't let you walk out of this room." Cas, loyal as always. Always fighting side by side with Dean. Of course, he’s gonna fight to save Dean. But he could never physically fight Dean.
fighting experience and that he won’t be much help. Dean doesn’t mind though, the less action part Cas is a part of the less he has to worry that he may get hurt.
He realizes he might of been a bit harsh to Cas but he can’t help it. Every time he knows Cas is keeping something from him it only reminds him of all the times Castiel has betrayed him in the past and it pisses him off. They
Cas doesn’t usually want to back down from a hunt, but he doesn’t know how to describe the anxieties he feels with this particular case, and he helps they listen to him just this once.
Dean continues throwing punches at Cas. Wherever he can get too. His face, his shoulder, his chin, his mouth. Castiel bringing his arms up to dodge as much as he can but he's not hitting back. Cas was always a good fighter but not as good as Dean is. Dean being slightly bigger than Cas takes him down easily.
"I don't know Dean. There's a lot of -things in my head right now that I don't quite know how to express yet."
Dean sucks in a sharp breath and slaps his hands down on the table, wincing as he stands up, back sore from sitting for too long. And still sore from getting thrown into a brick wall by those asshat vampires.
Dean packs them multiple pairs of jeans, shirts, socks, boxers, nightclothes and adds in an extra jacket for Cas cause he gets cold easily. Ya know, human things. Dean is always in charge of the clothes and Cas is always in charge of their toiletries and bathroom essentials for the pair.
“Got it.” Dean replies shortly, removing his hand from Cas’ and grabbing the sack of burgers on his way out to find Sam, shutting the door a little too roughly on his way out.
man. Whatever you want to say." Dean locks eyes with Cas hard and Cas can tell that Dean means it. Whatever Cas wants to admit or throw out into the open, Dean is giving him the opportunity. Maybe this is what Cas needs, an opening.
"So thanks but I'm good." Dean turns away again but this time Castiel doesn't hold back. Of course not.
to pieces. The Bedford Sheriff said they barely were able to identify the bodies. The werewolves we hunt are usually linked up with missing hearts, not their whole body shredded beyond recognition. Does that sound like any normal werewolf to you?” Cas states.
"Dean," Cas begs. Dean brings his elbow down onto that arm then bringing his hand up to Castiel’s face. Knocking him off guard.
Dean and Cas fall asleep in each other’s arms that night, per usual, but now accompanied by Sams snoring four feet away from them. Dean smiles to himself as he drifts off and lets his body finally relax completely.
After Cas gave up his grace to be human and moved permanently into the bunker. They spent weeks shuffling around each other in the kitchen, in the hall, in the library, everywhere, before finally, Cas was the one to grow a pair and tell Dean his feelings for him. Of course, Dean already knew to some extent but was in some sort of shock hearing himself admit that he reciprocates those feelings. They spent nights together in bed, sometimes Dean’s room and sometimes Cas’s, before agreeing that it was silly for the pair to continue to shuffle between both bedrooms, and both decided that it would be best if Cas moved into Dean's room with him.
It's the worst torture. And he prays that Castiel will give up and just let him be. Dean’s locked in this trance for hours on end.  He wants Cas gone. He prays he will just let the Mark run its course. Every course has its end.
“I think that’s a conversation you should have with your brother. I don’t know,” Castiel said, “I don’t know what Dean,” he trailed off then said, “I’m sorry Sam, I think it is his decision who he shares the matters of his personal life with, I wouldn’t want to say something he doesn’t want people knowing about.” He had answered Sam’s question without really answering it, but Sam seemed satisfied and did not press further, instead he just resumed the game and they continued the level.
"You get a water bottle of vodka confiscated once and suddenly they're your worst enemy," Jo retorted, sipping her coffee.
Moments later Dean called out “Sammy!” earning a number of glares from people viewing the art. He trotted over to his brother and boyfriend, “How’s the art?” Sam shushed Dean for talking too loudly.
Gabriel saw this man put his hand on Castiel's leg, and suddenly decided it was time for another drink. The last thing he wanted to do was make his little brother uncomfortable, especially at a party where he was likely already feeling like a fish out of water. Gabriel decided to leave those two alone for now and try to locate Dean and hopefully prevent him from cock-blocking Jo and Benny.
Wow this has been a long journey and the next chapter will be the last one. Thank you so much for sticking with this story, I know it was rough in some parts but this was my first full-length Destiel story and I'm looking forward to continue improving my writing. I do have some plans for sequel one-shots, but nothing is complete yet (though I have a lot of ideas). Thank you so much for the support, kudos and comments!
“Thanks,” Castiel said, putting on his best sober face as they entered the building and had to face the security desk.
"What were you thinking? He made Luke an addict, he fucking killed his little sister!" Gabriel said.
She tapped her pencil against the table, “I’m not trying to get you to bail on Dean, I just want you to really think about this. Really think about it, Castiel. What happens if you two break up? Have you two even talked about this?”
“Good. And you’re going to keep hearing it until you understand,” Zachariah pointed a finger at him, then motioned like he was going to exit his room but paused and turned his head slightly towards Castiel. “What happened with Luke was tragic, but it was his choice and I’ll be damned if another one of my kids chooses that same path.”
Taking the bus allotted extra time for Dean and Catiel before the morning bell rang, so after making a quick stop at Cas’ locker, the two made their way to their usual morning hang out spot. Charlie was talking animatedly to Tessa when they approached. “Look who made it to school on time,” Charlie observed.
Before Castiel could answer, the door swung open, Gabriel was now ready for dinner. “Come on, ladies.”
“So much so you’d fall asleep outside his door waiting for him?” Castiel asked fondly, with a slight smile, nudging Dean with his elbow.
“He’s been pining after this girl for years, he’s crazy about her,” Dean said as they left the ancient Egypt room.
“I don’t know, we’re exclusive,” Jo shrugged and her thought trailed off. “Should’ve given you some warning.”
After Gabe left the room Dean and Castiel looked at each other, Dean gulped. “I dunno about you but that was awkward,” Dean said.
“Cas you the bes’,” Dean slurred, pressing his mouth to Cas’ ear, making Castiel grimace at the saliva now all over his ear lobe. “Man these are good,” he somehow still managed to have his plastic souvenir cup gripped tightly in his hand, and waved it in the air, droplets of sticky liquor flinging all over the ground, himself and Cas. Cas flinched and licked a drop off his mouth. “Are we almost there?”
Gabriel impatiently waited for Castiel to show up so they could get dinner, but when seven rolled around and their wasn't any sign of him Gabe gave in and just went to the dining hall without his brother. He was probably eating dinner at the library again and just forgot to tell him.
Hi guys! As you may have noticed I have changed the story's rating. I ended up writing a future chapter that was definitely explicit and not mature. I wasn't planning on going that route but things changed.
“Yeah, wait, I thought I recognized you! You’re the girl who threatened to kick Jeremy's ass during class!” Jen pointed at Jo with a grin.
“Wendigo- it’s a creature that takes people off the mountain and eats ‘em. Anyway, after the ski resort went bankrupt I thought our problems would be over- didn’t think there would be much of an issue but there’s the rogue hiker here and there that goes missing so I kept the cabin and come up when I hear about missing folks.”
“He’s dead to them as far as I’m concerned. Zach decided this summer. No calls, no post cards. Last time I saw Luke he was,” Gabriel paused, and Dean turned around to see him shutter.
"I can't believe you met with him! I told you to switch advisers!" Dean said angrily, his shoulders hunching slightly.
“’M fine,” Gabriel waved off his brother and continued in the direction of the freshman dorms. He told his brother short stories about his freshman year as they walked back to Castiel’s building. “Dean puked on the steps of Smith Hall,” Gabriel pointed to one of the larger academic buildings. “That’s the dorm I lived in,” he pointed to the tower building.
“How ‘bout you, Dean?” Michael was already pouring a cup for Dean, knowing the answer before he even asked the question.
As much as Cas didn’t want to ruin the relaxing evening in he and Dean were having, he knew they had to have a conversation about their upcoming living situation. He was seated on Dean’s bed, as close to the window as he could to blow smoke outside when Dean said, “Man, next year is going to be crazy, huh Cas?”
Dean turned around with a slight frown on his face, disappointed Castiel was leaving the party so early.
Castiel noticed the pile of shoes next to the front door and how Dean and Mary were both in socks, so he toed off his sneakers and abandoned them with the rest of the shoes. “Hello Dean.”
Sam shrugged and couldn't think of a rebuttal so he pushed his hand down on the button then hopefully turned to peer out the window. Ruby shook her head and continued looking around. "Maybe Dean can fix it," Sam said hopefully and Ruby didn't say anything, figuring that a ski lift was likely a hell of a lot different than changing the oil on his car, but not wanting to point that out when Sam was clearly becoming distressed. Instead she turned to face Sam and put a hand on his chest, leaning in for a kiss. He pecked her on the lips and tried to move away but Ruby had moved her arms around his neck, pulling him in closer, nuzzling into his neck, placing wet kisses up towards his chin.
“How many rooms does this place have?” Dean asked, looking around and marveling at the size of this condo- he couldn’t believe there was a second floor; it had to be bigger than his home in Lawrence.
“Mhm,” Dean hummed, his lips planting firmly below Castiel’s ear, sending shivers throughout Castiel’s entire body. “There’s no one else in here,” he said, pulling away, making Castiel crave his touch once again. Dean’s eyes darted to one of the stalls along the opposite wall then back to Castiel before raising his eyebrows suggestively.
“Nightmare,” he exhaled loudly, “I-I need a minute,” he flung the blankets off him and Dean, and climbed over Dean’s legs, stumbling when he hit the floor, desperately searching for pants or boxers.
Sam scowled like he smelled something awful, he had always been very adamantly opposed to going into business with his father, he honestly didn’t understand why Dean was following in his footsteps. “I mean a history class or something would be cool to go to."
Castiel shot his brother a glare that unfortunately did not set him on fire, while Dean sputtered over his meal before shooting Gabe a glare that matched his partner’s. “Okay that’s enough,” Dean interjected as his friends laughed hysterically.
While Castiel was discussing psychology with Adam, Dean took the opportunity to wander and see if he knew anyone else there. It seemed Gabriel and Hope were nowhere to be found, which didn't surprise Dean; knowing Gabe they were probably already in her bed. When he found Benny and Jo they were destroying two guys at the beer pong table.
He left the health center with an appointment card in hand for a week later with a doctor in downtown Lawrence. Liz also gave him a brochure about managing stress and a bright yellow smiley face stress ball. The ball was cheesy and he hated that he thought it was cute, so much so he decided throwing it in the trash can on his way out of the building, but decided it would probably be more useful to throw at Gabriel. He decided that would help his stress.
“This conversation’s over,” Dean cracked his can and then said with a nod of his head towards the door, “By the way, I can't believe you invited him.”
“No, no, no, no. Fuck, Cas! My dad’s going to kill me!” Dean stood up, running his hands through his hair.
“Does mom seem more tired than usual?” Dean asked quietly as he pulled a glass out of the cabinet to fill with tap water.
“I’m not sure, I haven’t really thought about it,” Castiel responded honestly then leaned closer to Dean so their legs touched and his head rested on Dean’s shoulder.
Rhonda?” Gabriel exclaimed, turning to Dean with an expression of bewilderment. Dean nodded, wiping his face with his sleeve. “You mean
“I think he’ll want to live on campus too, Bobby and Ellen are driving him nuts,” Dean sat down on the bed next to Cas and leaned back so he rested against the wall.
Their lips crashed together again as Dean bucked his hips into Castiel, needing more friction. Cas’s hand wrapped around Dean, lazily stroking him as they continued kissing, wet and desperate and messy.
“You said you knew the way,” Ruby said as she carefully stepped away from the cliff, her arms crossed so the light from her flashlight shone off into the woods.
"What about the ranger tower? It might be high enough to pick up a signal" Sam offered, remembering the year Bobby took the kids to the old park ranger tower in the middle of the night to see a meteor shower.
to, but like,” Dean nervously wiped at his mouth as he talked, “we don’t need to go on a date and play he-likes-me, he-likes-me-not.” Castiel stared at Dean, waiting for him to elaborate, then Dean sighed. “We’re already together, we don’t have to do the dating thing. I like hanging out with you the way we have been. Why does it need to change?”
Gabe and Cas took off almost the second their exams were over. Michael had his old clunker of a BMW and drove his younger siblings home Tuesday afternoon- Dean didn't even have the chance to say goodbye; Gabriel was long gone and left behind as a joke (at least Dean hoped it was) some porno mags spread open.
Dean shrugged, trying to pay attention to his notes. Today Gabriel asked Castiel to meet at his room before they went to dinner, then he said he had to go see Chuck as soon as Cas showed up. That was almost twenty minutes ago, and Castiel was very suspicious.
Castiel nodded in agreement, "I think we will stick to our original plan of studying at the library."
“Cas, I want you,” Dean groaned, tilting his head back to look at Castiel before passing him the lube and condom on the table.
“Un-fuckin-believable,” Dean said angrily to himself, shaking his head as he hurried back to his car. Dean gripped the steering wheel until his knuckles turned white, he could not believe Cas would take off all weekend, making them worry sick, and he was just down the street from campus the entire time. Dean cared about Castiel, he couldn’t believe the utter disregard Castiel had. Not even bothering to tell them he was going to be gone all weekend. It hit Dean like a brick wall, he
After Dean’s last class of the day he tossed his backpack onto his dorm floor with a thud, causing Gabe to look up from his desk. “Hi, honey, how was class?” Gabriel asked sarcastically.
“I’ve been waiting so long t’ do this,” Castiel said as he kneeled in between Dean’s legs and coated his pointer and middle fingers in lube.
"I never realized how much of a dick he was until we started hanging out," Dean motioned between him and Cas when he said 'we'.
Dean eyed him as he shut the door behind him. Cas had dark circles under his eyes, and his nose was red and raw.
“I’ve wanted this since I first saw you, you’re beautiful,” Castiel said in the brief moment their lips were apart.
“For the record,” Castiel said, drinking the rest of the liquor, “I would never cheat on you, Dean. I could never do that to someone.”
Dean laughed loudly, mocking his younger brother for having school the next day. Mary rolled her eyes and shut the door behind her, leaving them to their horrible television movies.
“I know, Dean. Unfortunately there are assholes everywhere.” Dean laughed sadly as Cas continued, “Come on, let’s go back to the water,” Castiel took Dean’s arm in his and pulled him close as they wandered back down to the beach.
“I think I just may take you up on that- shit I gotta go, later dude!” Ash hung up before Dean was able to say bye. Dean hung up the phone shaking his head.
Dean paused for a moment before shutting the door quietly. Castiel shrugged off his backpack, placing it on Dean’s desk, then he unzipped it and pulled out his notebook, waving it in the air.
“Very,” he said, his lips smacking at the slight sour of citrus, but overall enjoying the sweet, fruity taste.
After dinner Dean eagerly twirled the keys to the Impala around his index finger, ready to show Cas his baby. He opened the front door for Castiel who was adjusting a black winter hat on his head. Dean almost laughed at the sight of Castiel with his long trench coat and beanie; he looked like a total creep.
"He didn't tell you? They left a few hours ago," Dean said as Cas shimmied off the backpack and let it fall to the floor.
Benny strained his neck to look into the trees as best as he could, but saw nothing besides pine needles and tree trunks, “Negatory.”
Dean could barely groan before he was interrupted, “Don’t start that macho I don’t have feelings shit,” she said with a deep voice, impersonating her friend.
He shook his head and a clipboard was placed in front of him, she instructed him to fill it out as best as he can. He just nodded numbly and made his way to the empty waiting area to complete the paperwork.
"Perfect! Lets meet down here. And don't tell anyone about it!" Garth pointed a warning finger at his new friend.
Jo sat on Dean’s bed and began asking her brother about home, mostly what happened upon his arrival back to the midwest.
Jo and Charlie exchanged annoyed looks, glad that they simply chose to get a room together. They didn’t have to deal with anyone but each other, but the boys for some reason decided to get a suite for seven.
“What time is it?” He yawned, retrieving his left arm from around Cas’s torso and sitting up on his side.
“No pressure though,” Dean said, he wanted Cas to choose to live with them next year on his own terms, he definitely didn’t want to make him feel like he had to or pressure him into something he wasn't ready for.
Castiel left his meeting with Dr. Alastair and while the meeting went well, Castiel couldn't shake the unnerving feeling of being watched. As he exited the building he turned back to look behind him, of course no one was doing anything out of the ordinary (and no one was watching him), but he still hurried away to his required science class.
“There it is!” Dean whispered, pointing to a brand new shiny red convertible, courtesy of Mr. and Mrs. Roman.
The next few hours waiting for Michael and Gabriel to leave felt excruciating to Castiel. It wasn’t that he and Dean weren’t able to spend time together, they were actually spending a lot of time together, more so than usual. But Castiel wanted time with Dean where they didn’t need to worry that Michael may walk in on them at any second. It wasn’t even about sex, they were having plenty of sex, but Castiel wanted to be able to touch Dean for longer than a brush of the hand in passing, he wanted to act freely around him without worry. He had to even watch what he said, he didn’t want to accidentally call Dean a term of endearment in front of Michael, or say anything about their relationship.
“Well?” Dean asked Castiel when him, Jack, and Sam made it back to the cabin. Cas just shook his head and pulled Dean in for a tight hug, Dean wrapped his arms around the younger boy and gripped him in the back of the head, whispering comforting words. Castiel pulled away from Dean’s comforting embrace, knowing he had to give the same comfort to his cousin. Charlie was holding Jack as he blankly stared ahead, then Castiel came over and wrapped his arms around both of them.
Michael had to go to work the next morning, but before he left he scrawled a list of things for Castiel to do before the party that night. Castiel didn't see the list until much later- nearly lunchtime when him and Dean finally made their way downstairs in search of caffeine. Dean picked it up and began reading out loud, "Sweep, vacuum, clean the bathroom and kitchen, buy food- did Mike leave you a to do list?"
Cas sighed loudly, “Just pot I promise,” he looked out the window of Gabe’s car and stared at the iced over lake they were parked beside.
Castiel visibly exhaled and thanked Dean before placing a soft kiss to his cheek, admiring how red Dean was once he pulled away.
“Yeah,” he said, taking a sip, noting it was nearly empty and passed it back for Cas to finish off. “Live and you learn.”
“Fuck you, stop trying to turn this around on me. You pissed her off that night, not me! Fuck this,” he announced as he stood up from the circle. “I can’t be around this asshole right now.”
“Are you okay?” Dean asked, concerned for the younger boy. From what he had heard from Gabriel, their uncle was a real douche bag.
“And she doesn’t know?” Castiel asked as they walked closer together to get past a tour group, their hands brushing and he could have sworn he felt Dean’s hand gently squeeze his own.
Dean sat in front of the microwave, watching the meatloaf spin around as his mind reverted back to his conversation with Bobby. Bobby thought he was gay. Dean Winchester, the biggest stud in Lawrence High, gay, he nearly scoffed it was so ridiculous. He dug into the meatloaf without allowing it to cool down, his thoughts about his sexuality flew out of his mind when he took a big bite of the meatloaf and immediately burned his mouth. “Ah, ah, hot,” he said around the food in his mouth.
Dean looked up from his burger and nearly dropped it when he met eyes with Rhonda. “Uh, hey, Rhonda.”
“We’ve only been together a few months, and it’s typical that couples,” Dean cringed slightly, “discuss their future when they begin thinking about living together.” There is is.
“I know they can, but I think you need to cut yourself some slack, you’re a very smart young man and you’re going to do great things, Sam.”
Dean sighed, knowing he would have to go downstairs to the vending machine in the lobby and set his drink down to pull on a pair of pants.
On Halloween night the five friends made the very cold walk to the frat house, but they were certainly not alone in doing so. When they arrived the front porch was packed full of people drinking and freezing their asses off, and the inside was the same. There was barely any room to move around, this had to easily be one of the biggest parties the house had thrown.
“Yeah you’re right,” Dean said, stuffing his hands into his pockets and turning away from the model pharaoh. “Maybe he will finally make a move.”
With a gasp Castiel shot up, nearly knocking Dean out of the bed, “Cas?” He asked, Castiel’s chest heaving, sweat dripping down his face, he placed a shaking hand over his chest. “Cas, you okay?”
“I know you do,” Dean yawned before turning around to face Castiel. He placed a soft kiss on his lips before pulling him to bed, falling asleep to the sound of Michael and his friends laughing downstairs.
“Your girlfriend doesn’t want a ride home?” Dean asked, hesitating to look at the bike rack where the blonde was riding away before pulling away from the curb.
Campus Pizza’s delivery driver called out yet again, and Dean complained about it from the second he got off the phone at nine in the morning until he left for work at eleven. Castiel wished him a good day and Dean mumbled something about it being good if he doesn’t kill anyone. Sam laughed and shook his head before eagerly asking Cas, “So what should we do today?”
"Come on then," Garth waved Castiel to the left of the library entrance, in the opposite direction of the open desk. Garth led Castiel through what looked like an emergency exit but led to a stairway.
There was another door at the bottom of the stairs, revealing the rarely used library archives. There were four large tables and no one to be found. The two set down their fresh coffees and settled in at across from each other. Castiel pulled out his world history book and notebook, ready to begin studying for his upcoming exam.
Dean returned back to the main area of the cabin as Cas started looking around, taking in the room. Dean yanked a sheet off the small couch and flopped down, pinching the bridge of his nose between his fingers. Castiel went over to the sink to see if the cabin had running water. It didn't.
"She's probably pulling a prank like Dean said," Ruby offered for reassurance, Sam nodded but they both knew her words were empty.
Dean reached over and grabbed his hand, "The summer is going to fly by and soon enough we'll be back here, pushing our twin beds together."
“Are you sure you know the way?” Ruby asked as they came to a fork in the path, all footprints from the earlier excursion to the tower now coated in a thick layer of snow and invisible to the eye. The three had stopped while Dean thought about which direction they were supposed to go.
Sam looked across the kitchen with a disgusted expression, while Dean proceeded to burst out laughing. “It’s true,” he laughed in between breaths.
“Wild summer?” Dean asked, throwing himself onto his bed that was still unmade and squirmed around on the uncomfortable university-issued plastic covering.
“Yes baby bro, I brought your pot,” Gabriel pulled a baggie out of his jeans pocket and tossed it to his brother, pausing from filling the fridge with beers.
A couple years later, when the ski lodge’s finances and reputation tanked due to an unfortunate lawsuit, the Singer family continued to enjoy their yearly holiday at the home sans skiing. After all, the lodge had been in Bobby Singer’s family for generations; they weren’t going to abandon a free place to stay when they needed to get away from their busy lives in Sioux Falls. Their home quickly became the only one on the mountain that remained occupied, the rest of the owners were avid skiers, and moved to a more inhabited area, so the Singer family enjoyed their vacation of solitude.
“I really enjoyed your surprise,” Dean said, catching his breath as he laid next to Cas, one arm wrapped tightly around his shoulders.
Gabriel froze as he was on his way out of the kitchen, then turned to Dean and said, “That’s his business,” Before he walked away back into the crowded living space.
“Hello?” Dean called out, expecting one of his friends to jump out of the bushes to scare them. When no one appeared, Dean said, “Cas, let’s get to the house,” hitting him in the arm gently to boost him in the direction of the main house. With the footprints not going any further, Dean figured whoever was out here got spooked by an animal and ran back. The two hurried along, speed walking towards the house that had now come into view.
Dean just shrugged and sipped his beer, brushing past Michael to go out to the patio. He whipped his towel down onto a lounge chair and settled in.
“I made one wrong turn, it’s fine, I can get us there,” Dean defended, “now let’s hurry I’m freezing my ass off.”
“I just like to keep my options open,” Dean lied with a shrug, looking down to avert his eyes from his brother, knowing Sam was able to see right through him.
Dean heard Mary talking quietly into the phone, then she called from the top of the stairs, “Don't be too long, it's your friend Castiel.”
“I’m too hungover to acknowledge that,” Castiel groaned, rubbing his palm into his eye before pulling Dean’s legs off of his. “I seemed to have misplaced my keys.”
Castiel grinned as he set the phone back on the receiver and as Michael made his way to bed he stopped by the phone and said, “Jesus, you’re like a little school girl.”
Gabriel eyed Dean and Cas, who were seated upright on Dean's bed with their backs against the wall; Cas laughed loudly, clutching his stomach. Dean's eyes flitted from Castiel's dimples to his eyes, tearing up from laughing so hard. Dean's mouth pulled into a grin at the sight of his friends laughter. Castiel put a hand on Dean's shoulder and gripped it tight, holding himself upright so he wouldn't literally fall over laughing. Gabriel raised his eyebrows and his mouth pulled into somewhat of a grimace.
“Where’s Gabe?” Ash asked after a few minutes, finally noticing that the usual life of the party was nowhere to be found, hence the more laid back atmosphere of the evening.
Benny narrowed his eyes, “I grew up in the bayou, you have to rely on your instincts there to survive, and I’m tellin’ you, now is not the time.”
“It’s not bad,” Castiel said after chewing for a minute as if he was analyzing the pizza. He wiped a spot of sauce off the stubble on his chin and Dean froze, staring as he licked the sauce off his finger lazily. Castiel noticed Dean staring and took another bite, licking his lips.
“He’s always been a bit different, he knows that.” Gabriel paused, “He’s just trying to figure out who he is. He needs to do that away from Zach. Just be nice to him or I’ll kick your ass, Dean-o.”
“Dean, I’m sure it’s nothing,” Castiel rolled his eyes at Dean’s over protection of the car. Cas always thought his obsession with cars was kind of stupid, but it was endearing how much care Dean put into his fathers car. It wasn’t rare for Dean to get up at 7 on a Saturday morning to wash the car before he went to work.
“I just need right now,” Dean smirked before lifting his empty glass, “and a refill.” Dean stood up to head towards the bar, leaving behind his friend. He pretended like he didn’t see her sneak a look at her phone, smiling softly to herself. Dean was truly happy for Charlie and her girlfriend Dorothy. Charlie and Dean had been best friends for decades, and over the years he felt proud to have seen her grow and become the outgoing, hilarious, computer programmer that she was- a massive transformation from the shy girl who only spoke in class when directly spoken to, hiding from everyone behind her book of the week.
“Shit, sorry,” Castiel apologized as Dean jumped away at the sudden sensation and tried to brush the red wine off his swim trunks.
“Okay, we are not having this conversation,” Dean sternly put his hands out in front of him and walked away from the car.
Life has been unbelievably hectic the past few months, thanks to my readers for sticking it out!! This has become much longer than I anticipated and I am starting school soon, so I am working on wrapping this up because I know I just won't have much time to work on it for a while.
“I’m going to shower, come get me when you go to lunch,” she said before picking up her bra off the floor and shoving it into her backpack.
"Last I saw he was talking to someone, uh, Adam?" Dean said, thinking hard about what his name was again.
Cas let out a low moan at the sensation he hadn’t felt in months. “Yes, Dean,” he practically begged, moving his hips to get Dean’s finger further inside him. Dean bobbed his head up and down Castiel’s cock, crooking his finger into his prostate. Cas moaned loudly, one hand grabbing a fist full of Dean’s hair, the other one twisting the sheets beside his head. “More,” he asserted before Dean pushed another finger inside. “More,” he said.
As the spring semester came to an end the University of Kansas was unsurprisingly buzzing. Students and faculty alike eager for the end of finals, the dining halls and quad emptying steadily as all the students went back home for the summer. Gabriel's last exam ended a day before his youngest brothers, but when Dean casually offered to take Cas home, Gabriel immediately took off to the frat house to hitch a ride home with Michael, not caring to stick around campus any longer than necessary.
“I’m his big bro, it’s my job. Don’t take away the best part of being a brother! This is my only chance to corrupt the youth!” Gabriel paused, “I’ll corrupt Sammy when he comes to visit!”
Dean’s lips quickly reconnected to Castiel’s neck, beginning to nibble down to his collarbone, coaxing groans out of the younger boy. Cas’ hands raked up Dean’s sides outside the shirt, and then again inside the shirt, feeling his soft skin as he dragged his hands back up to pull the shirt off. Dean sat up so he could reach the buttons to Castiel’s pants, popping them open with the zipper shortly behind.
"Yeah, he," Dean sighed loudly and his hands balled up into fists, "he told me I had to fuck him for the grade or he would tell administration I propositioned him."
“Is that a promise?” Dean asked with a smirk before Castiel jumped from his chair, joining Dean in the pool. Dean shook water from his hair before wading over to Castiel and jumping on him. The two went under the water with a splash, when they surfaced Castiel sputtered and wiped water from his face.
“How ‘bout I make us a real breakfast?” Dean said after he noticed the bowl of heart-healthy cereal.
“I’m sick of watching you wait by the phone! What the hell, man?” Sam exclaimed, throwing his hands in the air.
Cas scoffed at his brother before they made their way to the elevator, and once inside it he turned to Dean and said, “You look very handsome,” he brought a hand up to feel the soft material of Deans’ gray sweater.
“Went down to the lake for a swim,” Dean responded as he poured himself a glass of water and drank it in one long gulp.
"Once I get out of this place I hope to drink to forget it," Dean chuckled as he counted Benny's change.
“We're going to have fun today if it kills you,” Dean said.“Now how much longer on the Looney Toons marathon?”
Castiel and his brother sat atop a small brick wall in the backyard. “So,” Gabriel said, drawing out the vowel, earning a raised eyebrow from his brother.
He wrapped an arm around Dean’s shoulders while they danced, pulling him closer ever so slightly, his eyes keeping watch over Michael. Dean grinned at the feeling of Cas’s arm around him and closed his eyes, letting his body take over. "You tell anyone I danced to Ricky Martin, I'll kill you," Dean warned, making Castiel laugh loudly and pull him closer.
“I know what’s going on with you and Cas,” she glanced towards the house, “and I want you to know that I love you very much. I’m happy for you, for both of you-”
“Dean, it wasn’t your fault. It would have found us no matter which path we were on,” Castiel said in an attempt to reassure Dean that he was not the guilty party, and placed a cold hand on his sleeve.
“Well I don’t want you to either,” Castiel sighed again, and Dean said, “It’s way worse when they’re disappointed, huh?”
Jo started the game, picked up her card, showing it to everyone, “Six. Chicks,” before taking a drink and stuffing it under the tab of the beer can in the middle of their circle. Anna followed Jo in taking a sip.
Gabriel yawned and stretched, “Give me five,” he kicked his legs over the edge of his bed as Chuck asked, “Dean, Cas?”
“I feel,” Dean hesitated and cocked his head, like he was thinking, but instead of responding he leaned over the center console and used his hands on the back of Cas’s head to pull him closer until their lips collided together. Castiel pulled back ever so slightly out of surprise, but immediately pushed himself closer, wanting to feel more of Dean’s lips on his own. Dean brought his hands to cup Castiel’s chin, and Cas’s hands went to the back of Dean’s head, gripping the short hairs tight. Dean pulled away suddenly and said with a smile on his face, “Let’s get outta here.”
“These ones?” Castiel’s attention snapped to his brother, who was jangling a set of keys, then tossed it to his very hungover brother, who didn’t question why he had them. He just gathered his things and left quietly.
Gabriel put the phone back on the receiver and announced that Kali was coming with all her friends. "Who?" Dean asked, playing Tetris in the freezer to make room for the pizzas.
This unfortunately did not give Castiel any answers, but he said he would try to talk to him again as they approached the fitness center. Gabriel stepped off the sidewalk, wanting to get away from his brother pining for information about Dean again, but also in the direction of an emergency exit that was his shortcut to his health class.
“I have a couple ideas, but first a drink?” Castiel said before getting off the couch and moving to the liquor cabinet.
Mary wasn’t stupid. She liked to think she knew her oldest son pretty well, and she certainly knew when he was acting out of the ordinary. Out of the ordinary wasn’t necessarily a bad thing- like the way Dean smiled more. Or the way he came home from school talking incessantly about a new friend. Or how Dean’s closeness to his friend Cas was different than the closeness he had with any of his other friends. Mary was starting to put the pieces together. Her son was clearly crazy for this Castiel boy. Not that she minded of course, Castiel was a sweet, polite young man who she noticed was constantly staring at her son. On a number of occasions when Mary walked into the same room as Dean and Castiel, it seemed like they would adjust themselves, as if moving away from each other.
"That's nice," Castiel said, nodding, uninterested in what she was saying. He was trying to turn his attention back to Andy, who was telling a story that had Adam in stitches.
“I brought Dean notes from class,” Castiel scrambled to find that notebook, which was face down on the floor. He picked it up and waved it in the air before placing it on Dean’s desk.
"He said he was going to do homework, maybe he went to the library," Dean said, shielding his eyes from the sun when he looked up to Gabriel standing before them.
“Alright then nerds, let’s get outta here,” Dean said, causing Sam to roll his eyes and exchanged a glance with Cas, who scoffed at Dean’s comment.
Gabriel made a hand gesture and a sound effect of a whip cracking as he kicked off his shoes before taking a swig directly from the bottle of rum.
“How ‘bout we have breakfast first, then if you aren't poisoned I'll make ya dinner,” he winked at Cas, causing him to turn a light shade of pink.
“To another year we won’t remember!” Gabe announced, and Dean nodded his head before the two cracked open the lid and chugged.
Castiel stepped forward, one hand pulling Dean's head into his, their lips colliding. Dean wrapped a hand around and gripped Cas' shoulder tightly, pushing their lips together even more.
"You didn't have to visit me, we've been friends since elementary school, we can go a couple months without seeing each other. Remember that summer I went to Bible camp."
Before Dean or Castiel got the chance to respond Charlie bounded up to the table with a curvy brunette in tow. “Hey, guys! This is Rhonda!”
Bobby and Ellen couldn't return to their vacation destination the year after, unable to take the pain of being at their beloved home, full of memories with their two children who wouldn’t be there. Charlie was hesitant about returning, but Dean was adamant that this was what Jo and Ash would have wanted. Their friends wouldn’t have wanted their group to fall apart without them, especially now that most were returning home from their first semester in college and hadn’t seen each other in months.
Gabriel nodded before turning around and exiting back to the main living space, afraid his brother was alone and bored. Luckily, Gabriel was wrong. He found Castiel out on the deck sitting on a plastic chair that looked like it was going to break at any moment. A brown haired guy passed Castiel a joint, who took it eagerly and inhaled deeply.
“Hello,” Castiel said, nodding his head to Dean and Jo before tentatively taking a bite of his pizza.
Upon returning home, Dean quietly shut the front door, wincing as it squeaked. Castiel toed off his boots while Dean added his jacket to the pile of others hanging onto the hook for dear life.
When Dean got back to his room Gabe and Cas had clearly been pre-gaming for the frat house, they were emerged in a very competitive game of Mario Kart on the old Nintendo Dean stole from the living room back home. The two had a small pile of empty beer cans between them, and apparently Cas was even better at it than Gabe, he had just passed Gabe and was now an entire lap ahead of him. Gabriel swore loudly at his brother as he approached the finish line, Castiel grinning from his victory.
Dean rolled his eyes and let down one of his fingers. Castiel also put one of his down, with his face slightly pink. When Gabriel saw his sister take a drink his mouth dropped open, but he didn’t comment on it.
Castiel shrugged, and Dean leaned in to place a small, chaste kiss on Castiel’s lips before he took a sip of wine.
"Hello, Clarence," Meg purred as Castiel closed his dorm door, he paused with his key still in the lock.
“She left ten minutes ago, if you weren’t such a diva maybe she would have driven us,” Cas teased, wiping his mouth with a napkin. Dean silently cursed him for not using the napkin to clean off his fingers,
Gabriel and Dean stood outside Jo’s door, pounding on it repeatedly. “Jo,” Dean called, drawing out the 'o’.
Sam lingered in the doorway for a minute while Dean got up, cringing when Dean ruffled his hair as he walked past him.
“Hello Dean,” Castiel greeted after Dean opened his door to let Castiel in. Castiel blushed when he noticed Dean was only wearing boxers and a T-shirt.
I think I will drop in some flashback chapters of Cas transitioning from angel to human and some more Destiel fluff and memories to fill in some more plot in this story. Thinking of doing it every other chapter or so but I am not positive yet. Let me know what you guys think :)
Cas steps forward and places his hand firmly on Dean's shoulder. "No." Castiel voices, coming around to meet Dean's eyes in front of him.
Dean turns back with a new darker look in his eyes. He can see the fear in Cas' face finally but that only fuels his violence more.
“Alright, well, I say we head out in the morning. Let’s all get a good night's sleep; we pack up and out of here by 10 tomorrow.” Sam directs to the pair across from him, standing up and shuffling down the hall, waving good night to the pair as he walks away.
That’s their permanent routine, never faltering, until now as Dean observes Cas in the mirror, Cas not even bothering as toothpaste drips down his chin and onto his hand on the counter. Cas eyes deep, lost in thought.
“Sure is sweetheart.” Dean smiles at him as Cas sits up against the headboard and takes the cup from his hands. He sighs a hum of contentment as he takes the first sip, the hot liquid sliding down his throat.
He's cloudy. Dazed almost as he stands there. He doesn't remember what happened. How he got there. Where’s Sam? Where’s Cas? He looks around for a moment, confused before laying his eyes on a familiar body in front of him. A silhouette. A shadow almost. He can’t see who it is but he senses he knows this shadow. He feels safe almost but not quite like something is missing. The silhouette standing over something on the ground, a body. A boy. Who is it?
or not. Each of them starting to get frustrated with the lack of information, evidence, and details around the incident. Each victim followed a totally different story. None of it was linking up.
“No problem,” Dean says and gets up to get their shared duffle bag out of the closet. He places it on the bed beside Cas and makes his way to the dresser pulling out sets of clothes for the pair. Cas watches him and continues to sip on his coffee.
“Alright, thank you again officer. Call me if you find anything.” Sam hangs up the phone behind Cas and makes his way to the table next to him. He pops open a beer as he sits down with a huff. Cas looks at him unenthusiastically, he’s really not interested in this hunt at all. “That was the police station. They said they will have to search through all their cold case files to see if they have any information on the case for us. Apparently they just stopped looking for the teenagers a few weeks ago. Kinda odd but whatever.”
"We can read the book now," Cas says desperately. Trying to find some inch of understanding with Dean.
"Ya know, can't really get to sleep sitting up." Dean laughs nervously after a few beats of silence, Cas still watching him.
“He’s okay I think. I don’t know he didn’t say much to me about it, he was very vague.” Dean admitted, popping a piece of bacon in his mouth.
"Well, maybe that's the problem? You need to talk about them, whether you know how to express them or not. You know I am always here to listen to you man. You honestly haven't said too much since you have been all 'non-mojoey'."
Dean is quiet for a long while, which only sets Cas's mind faltering even more than it was previously. There
Cas locks eyes with Dean for a few moments. He hopes Dean can read his expression. How uneasy he feels.
They sit in silence, listening to the cars drive past them on the busy street, watching the birds fly south for the winder, smell the fresh after rain smell.
"You killed him." The silhouette says, crouched down, its hands rest on the body. The silhouette is very still, breathing deeply. Dean can see the raise of its shoulders as the shadow inhales. It seems to be contemplating what to do next.
A pack of werewolves is the last thing Dean wanted to hunt after their tricky vampire hunt just three days ago. He absolutely despises werewolves.
“Damn Cas. You had be worried there for a minute, thought you were going into cardiac arrest right in front of me man.” Dean laughs with a shake in his voice. “You wanna tell me what the hell that was.” Dean says forcefully with little bite to his demand.
But it is like Cas to get in his head about things and not want in on the action just cause he doesn’t have his angelic “mojo” anymore.
"I took down a monster," Dean says smoothly shifting his gun his waistband at the base of his back. "Because that's what I do. And I will continue to do that, until-" Dean shrugs nonchalantly.
Truth be told, Castiel is confused with this case. Nothing seems to be adding up. Yes, they know it is a werewolf pack for sure now after speaking with the families of the victims. After much thought on the matter, Castiel finally realizes one single commonality with all the victims and its a far fetched one at that. The victims all went missing around the same geographical area. Just outside a nation state park and also close an abandoned cabin in the woods. That’s not creepy at all.
Cas thinks he can fix him. Pull him from his dark thoughts. Dean really hopes he can before he is lost forever.
Dean has been kind enough to help Cas with this ‘midlife’ crisis he seems to be having, but Cas knows he can only take so much before Dean starts to get frustrated with him in the process. And again, while living with the Winchesters, Cas feels like a burden.
"I must admit that becoming human, changing from the celestial being that I have been for so many eons has been incredibly-quiet and
He has his own nightstand on the side of the bed along with his clothes in his own respected drawers in the dresser and his nice FBI suit, and his old trench coat in the closet. He even a few pictures and decorations littering the walls and shelves of his boyfriend's room-their room. Dean made a point to have Cas as comfortable as possible in his own space.
Dean stomps towards Cas another jab of his knee to his stomach and throwing a punch into Castiel’s cheek. Castiel recovers quickly and manages to get ahold of Dean from behind, his arms wrapping around Dean's arms pinning him to his chest. Dean throws his head back as hard as he can hitting Cas square in the nose. Cas cries loudly in his ear. Dean grabs his shoulders and shoves him sending him across the room slamming into the desk in the corner. Dean following suit. Grabs onto Cas' trench coat and slamming his face into the dark wood, marking it with his angels blood.
Sam scoffed softly, “Because if I do then you’ll start expecting it every morning. Plus, you are the ‘meat man’ right?” Sam hooked his fingers in the air and had a smirk on his face.
He finds Sam at the front of the motel sitting on a bench. Dean slumps next to his brother silently offering him a burger from the ruffled up sack in his hand. Sam shakes his head lightly.
“Man Sammy, why don’t you make me breakfast more often?” Dean chuckled and sat down at the kitchen table facing Sammy from across the kitchen.
Dean rolls over onto his side, facing Cas slowly, barely able to make out his face in the shadows of their room.
But Cas is strangely content. He’s okay with dying this way. Even if it is Dean that’s killing him. He would have died fighting to save Dean from the Mark. Fighting for his righteous man. Fighting for his love. He would have died, his last memory looking into Dean's eyes. And he was accepting that.
" Cas pausing taking another breath to steady himself, which is another thing he wasn't used to having to control, ugh humans.
Dean throws a rough jab of the knee into Cas' stomach. Cas grunts and doubles over in pain as Dean throws his body towards the pile of books in the middle of the room, his body skidding across the wooden flooring.
It’s no doubt that Cas is still protective of Jimmy Novak's daughter after everything she’s been through. He blames himself mostly for everything he’s caused. But Sam bringing that up as bait just to get him on board with this case is a low blow.
Castiel doesn't move. Not even an inch. He doesn't even blink. He's clearly not frightened by this Dean. Guess we'll have to take this fun up a notch, Deans subconscious says to him quietly.
Dean sat eating his bacon and eggs thinking about everything he needed to do to get ready for the road. He needed to pack Cas and his things, they always share a bag now. He needed to make sure Baby was filled with gas and had the extra oil and essentials she needed for an extra-long road trip like this one. He needed to make sure he had any weapons they might need and then some just in case it actually isn’t a werewolf pack. You can never be too careful.
Dean will never forget the time Cas packed their clothes bag and forgot underwear. Underwear! The most important part! Dean made fun of him the whole trip so much that Cas pouted and didn’t talk to him for a few hours. That never lasts long though. Needless to say, they had to go out of their way to find a store and buy some and ever since then Cas has been in charge of the bathroom supplies and he hasn’t forgotten anything since.
“I should be fine Cas. Thank you.” Dean was grateful for his attentive boyfriend but he didn’t like it when other people dove. It was weird to him. I mean let’s be honest it’s no secret that Dean needs to work on his control issues but putting someone else behind the wheel of Baby and giving them the power to end his life in half a second is outrageous to him. It gives him the chills just thinking about it. At least if he crashes it’s his own damn fault and not someone else’s.
"You're not. Maybe you could fight the Mark for years. Maybe centuries like Cain did. But you cannot fight it forever." Cas pauses dryly. "But when you turn, and you will turn. Sam, and everyone you know, everyone you love they could be long dead. Everyone except me." Cas finishes. He breathes heavily. Eyes almost tearing up.
"You can leave now, Cas." Dean announces to him turning away. He desperately wants Cas to go. Wants him to be as far away from Dean as possible, afraid he may do something to Cas he will later regret forever when he's not under the Marks spell.
Castiel has been lying to Dean and Sam and as guilty as it makes him feel, he keeps this information to himself and he thinks it’s for the best. All the brothers need is another reason to worry and hover over Castiel more than usual.
It’s silent for a long while after that, and Dean is almost convinced Cas has fallen asleep until he speaks up finally, voice thick with sleep and anxiety. Dean’s heart tears a bit.
"I was so used to being so in tune with the earth and all of its elements and organisms. I used to know every part of every microscopic fiber. I could walk outside and hear every little detail there was and now-nothing. And it's extremely frustrating being a whole new me. A less powerful me as you will but that was a me that I knew to only be true until recently." Cas runs his hands threw his hair tugging at the roots. "And the most frustrating one?"
Cas gives up after looking through the sites and decides to take the Ambien sleeping pill, although he is very skeptical if it will work or not, seeming as all the other drugs he's tried only works for a bit and then decides to just...stop.
They had been following up on a possible case in a small town in Virginia, researching for days, still stumped on what they possibly could be hunting. Five teenagers were reportedly kidnapped during the day and found weeks later completely torn to shreds. They’ve never heard or seen anything like it.
“Cas.” Dean speaks softly, voice laced with worry. Dean places a hand to Castiel back and he panics. Castiel pushes back his chair with a shriek and wide eyes, hands balled in the fabric of his trench coat. Sam stands with a start as well.
Of course, when Cas is so far into his own thoughts he couldn’t be bothered even if one of the werewolves themselves attacked him at that very moment does Dean decide that is the perfect time for him to emerge from his shower. He waltzes out of the bathroom, steam rolling into the room behind him as he whistles a tune.
It was way too damn early when Dean woke up the next morning. His bedside clock says it was 7:03 in the morning if he had windows in his room the sun would just be rising. Sure he got more than the four hours that he usually needs but that only left him feeling more exhausted and groggy. He hadn’t even gotten out of bed yet and he dreaded it knowing today was already going to be a long-ass day. They had an 18-hour car ride ahead of them and his back already ached at the thought of driving for that long.
keep secrets from each other anymore and Cas got caught in a lie. He can sense it. Dean doesn’t know what he’s hiding from him but either way he doesn’t like it.
“How long is the drive?” Cas sets his coffee cup on the nightstand and moves to sit criss cross across from Dean with his hands in his lap.
“I appreciate that man,” Dean says walking out of the kitchen and back towards his room without another word.
"Would it- would it help if I sat in here with you for a bit? Just until you fall asleep so you aren't so alone?" Dean suggests.
“I-I don’t really know.” Castiel replies. “I just was in my head and got spooked. It-it’s nothing really.” Castiel plays with his hands in front of him, nervous.
Cas was right, of course, Cas is almost always right. And Dean has to admit he was getting used to Cas rubbing the sore muscles of his back every night after that last hunt, every night except for last night. So yes his back was bothering him a little more than usual today. What an old man.
Something clicks in Dean. A sudden realization. A memory almost. Dean has the Mark of Cain. A Mark that turned him into a killer. This isn't the real Dean. This is the Mark acting out. Making him a killer. Making him murder people. And the silhouette isn't a shadow at all. It's Cas. Castiel is standing in front of him. The one who saved him from his torturing in hell. His best friend. His lover. Trench coat and all. He blue striped tie laying loosely against his chest. It’s Cas.
“Alright, alright, alright,” Dean pipes up between the two, shooting daggers at his brother before turning to Cas. “Cas, I hear you. It is strange, but I think Sammy is right. We can’t do much just sitting here.”
Cas is agonizingly quiet, and he stares down at the table deep in thought, teeth chewing on the inside of his cheek nervously. Dean places a hand on his boyfriend's shoulder, shaking him out of his thoughts.
He's not even fighting back! HAHA. Some angel right? I thought you said he was a warrior of heaven? Dean's subconscious laughs at him and Dean thinks they might start throwing punches as well.
And it's back. Just after Dean thought he might have hit a weak spot, somehow gotten through and said what he really wanted to say. What he needed Cas to understand. His Mark stained subconscious comes in and ruins the progress. Tears down all the walls that Dean is desperately trying to put up between the two. His humanity thoughts and his subconscious evil thoughts. Dean can't seem to separate the two.
The word friend is kind of a loose way of putting their relationship. There has always been that silent connection between them. The unspoken chemistry between them that they don’t talk about. They’ve never mentioned it to the other even though they both feel this pull towards one another.
Dean frowns at the sight, upset because Cas is upset about something. Something he hasn’t yet voiced to him, but Dean’s not gonna push.
Dean takes in a sharp breath holding Cas's eyes and Cas internally panic for a moment. He messed up he shouldn't of gone that far, this is why he didn't want to start this conversation tonight, knowing his exhausted ass brain would cause some stupid shit like THAT to fly out of his face. Cas internally stabs himself.
