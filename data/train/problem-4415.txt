He’s not surprised to find himself in the basement, even if he doesn’t remember taking the long path down there.
Dean’s fingers curl around the pretty impressively awesome knife Cas got him, that he keeps latched to his belt. He doesn’t know where Cas got it from, probably some court in the fourteenth century or something just to show off, but it’s still so
He gets up the stairs. He’s not sure how. He only knows that, next thing he’s aware of, he’s in his room and collapsing onto his bed. He lets the memory foam take in his shape and wishes it’d swallow him up completely.
She takes a few steps further, but it’s only so she can touch her paw to his leg. Despite her height, she’s still intimidating as hell. Her head’s completely encased by the bone skull she wears; it doesn’t rattle around on her head like it does for the smaller Cubone, and there are gleaming ivory spikes in the back. But her eyes are enormously soft, now, tender even.
But Dean still finds himself saying “Yeah.” Jumping into shit head-on is the only way he knows how to go about things.
Mary looks up, meeting his eyes, which means now it’s time for Dean to avert his own. Real men, John had taught him, loved the job and bars choked with smoke and too much beer and
“You sure this is alright?” Dean asks. He’s wearing a sweater that covers all his tattoos, and nice jeans. Ones without any holes, even. His shoes match and everything. It feels like he’s itching out of his skin.
Most of the time, instead of feeling like a goddamn human being, Dean feels like a limp sweater made of stitches labeled
“I’m probably included as well. I don’t expect it would make you feel better if I told you that, when frightened, these monsters ran to Eve and the Leviathan to tell them too,” Cas adds.
No point in being all fucking existential when there’s shit to kill. He pumps the gun, and watches his own flesh sizzle away, etching into the skin going black at the edges like someone had thrown acid on Dean’s own face. The howl that comes out of the Leviathan’s mouth isn’t a noise he’d ever make, nor is the stance where he stands legs splayed wide and arms flung out, shaking as black ooze trickles down his cheeks, lining his chest.
Instead, he lets his body melt even further into Cas. He feels Vaporeon move with him, and he knows Staraptor’s moving whenever Cas does. They’re gonna leave a ridiculous indent in this sofa, and he doesn’t care.
He could swallow it down, though, and have his life trudge on like this. Him and Cas aren’t anything but friends, and even though it feels like they’re both walking across one hell of a tightrope all the time, Dean’s okay with that.
A happy little shudder wracks Dean’s body. “I’m not sure you’re supposed to use your powers that way.”
“You banished yourself to a Hell dimension for years, and you’re gonna call Castiel strange?” Dean can’t help but ask. His voice sounds raw, still.
“We’ll let you be for a while,” Tamara says, gently. There’s a wistful look in her eyes, and Dean remembers all she’s lost, too. She probably didn’t get a miracle reunion with her husband’s Pokemon.
Dean testifies on one of the last days, against Alastair and Azazel and Lilith. His breath goes wobbly on the stand, but he presses on. They’re all sentenced to life in maximum security. The bang of the judge’s gavel sounds like closure, and he exhales. At last.
“That’s — not breathing.” Cas’ eyes are wide, and Dean’s learned from far too long in this place that the look on his face means nothing good.
At every one of these mirror versions of himself, Dean feels a black and ragged curl of pain inside Cas rising higher and higher. He knows it too well. It’s the feeling that rammed right into his own gut when he looked at Castiel, all these months.
– they’re making him not pay so much attention to the street address, but he recognizes the name. It’s at the very edges of town, where the apartments start turning into actual townhouses of very varying quality. There are shiny pretty things carved from what must be marble; there are crappy wood hovels that seem pieced together with spit, some scattered Bellsprout vines, and a couple of prayers to Arceus.
No, on a hunt he only has bloodthirsty monsters to worry about. He shakes his head and sighs as Dean pulls up to a ramshackle cabin along the side of the road. Indistinct gray material crumbles around its foundation.
“And you wouldn’t believe what gigantic losers they are,” Claire returns. “Seriously, when you meet them –”
“I know you worried about it, corrupting me. You worried you ruined my life.” Dean’s preoccupation with this made little sense to Cas, considering his lack of respect for angels overall, but Cas had always been touched by how much he cared. And Dean’s many idiosyncrasies were so much of why he fell for him, sudden and slow at once and like nothing he had ever experienced. “You talked about it with the other version of me. But Dean, you are the best part of my life.”
He places his palms flat on the table, willing them to steady. He breathes. When he blinks, he swears it’s that same dull yellow behind his eyelids.
with it,” Cas snarls, in a voice he used to reserve for only horribly imminent danger. It’s getting awfully hard – heh – for Dean to hear that gravel voice on hunts these days.
But that’s when a blast of red light rips through the room, not the same searing light but enough to blast away the white. The hissing cuts off like someone took a goddamn axe to it. Everything is very real again, Dean’s head way too goddamn clear. His cheek is squished right against the carpet, and he’s pretty sure he’s drooling.
Perfect. Dean never thinks that word. When he thinks that word is when the world starts splitting itself apart. But right here, in this bed –
They still argue and fight, because there’s little nice about either of them, and even less pretty about the life they’ve lived. They’re still coming from two different worlds — and fuck, Cas was alive before the world they’re on even existed, and it’s never gonna stop being difficult having conversations with somebody like that. There are still things Dean says and immediately wishes he could bite back, and nights when Cas doesn’t join Dean in bed and Dean’s gotta punch the pillow over and over before he can actually sleep.
“I’m honored.” Dean bites back his laugh, because from Inais, it’s all genuine, but goddamn his huge eyes and slack lips are hilarious.
The mother of the girl dressed as a Squirtle is dressed up herself, wearing all green and sporting a big fake flower on her back. Dean saw a guy about his age earlier; his costume consisted of sagging cardboard wings and a tail with Christmas lights wrapped hastily around the end, but Dean gave him serious mental points for even attempting a Charizard costume. He’ll guess that’s the dad of this family. Here, though, the mom picks up the little girl in the Squirtle outfit and spins her around and around until they’re both laughing.
As an Eevee evolution, Vaporeon fits right in. Dean hates it. He wants to hitch up the sleeves on his sweater to show off his tattoos after all. It’d probably make some of the snobs here keel right over.
Dean didn’t even see the kid like Sam did. But even before the stranger’s green eyes go bright yellow, Dean knows who he is, and he’s scrambling to his feet and away from the entryway to the kitchen.
“People are in danger,” Dean snaps, harsher than he wanted. “You’ve seen it; I know you’ve seen it. You told me you admired Claire for her bravery before I had the balls to even agree with you. You know the shit that’s going on now, it’s all wrong –”
The most comforting actual human, though, is Charlie. Dean’s seriously amazed she hasn’t bolted from their friendship by now. They lost their jobs, and they’re not co-workers any more; there’s no reason for her to stick around. But she does anyway. She keeps calling him, programming that “Call Your Girlfriend” song into his phone as her ringtone. He’s told her how damn weird it is that a lesbian’s using that particular song for the phone of a dude who’s pining terribly after a dude, but she just hummed at him and dialed his number again so the tune would go off one more time.
“Gotta be kidding me,” Dean growls, in a voice that surprises even him. “Have you talked to her since…?”
. He’s hoping he can keep his breath shallow enough not to be noticed, because it’d suck out loud to get ambushed by Leviathan in bed —
Dean wakes up and yep, he’s gotta shake his arm as discretely as he possibly can to get the feeling back in it. Cas grunts in return, and shoves back against him. Only it’s the easy curve of his bare ass right against Dean’s thigh, so it more wakes Dean up than annoys him.
“Keep laughing it up! I’ll tell Ellen dress codes foster productivity!” she practically shrieked at him one day.
He’s halfway up the hill to the safe area, when he realizes there’s someone hot on his heels. He wheels around, clutching the Cubone to protect them, but that protection isn’t necessary. It’s Amy, who’s carrying the rest of the babies up the hill with him.
In an instant, she transforms herself into an enormous torrent of water, rushing right at the crowd. It’s a glorious goddamn minute, because the column sprays everywhere, even getting all over Dean who doesn’t give a damn right now, but mostly bashing every one of those chuckleheads. Getting them right in the gut, clipping them in the shoulder, even getting a solid hit in on the head. A couple of the Pokemon dive out of the way, but most of them get blasted too. Dean winces, and hopes they’re okay. It’s a nasty necessity, but they don’t deserve that.
Cas’ dick is huge while erect and so dark with blood it’s practically purple; it visibly twitches when Dean runs a finger down its length. “Been pretty hyped up for a while, haven’t you?”
Sam shrugs, and God Dean had forgotten about the stupidest things he did, like the exaggerated flex of his lips when he did that. Even though he’s been dumped right back into a total shithole, gratitude twists through him. “He’s a good kid, but his psychic abilities are kinda limited. Not like he can tell us who’s gonna win in the end or anything, or if we’re all ultimately, you know, doomed.”
When Dean feels pressure under his chin, he lets Cas tilt his head back up. Cas looks tired too, the deep lines under his eyes even more pronounced than usual, but his eyes burn with their usual intensity cranked up exponentially. “My family is difficult, as I’m sure you’ve seen –”
Cas knows Dean’s face so well that he should be used to it by now. And yet, every time he focuses his sight on Dean’s gilt visage, it steals the breath from his lungs. He feels his heart stutter. Such things should not affect an angel, Cas knows, but he’s also long past caring.
be worrying about is that damn blue light. There’s no such thing as miracles, he’s learned, and anything that looks like one usually gets repaid with a nasty path of destruction. What he
Truth be told, Dean loves giving head, always has. There’s something for him about being caught between someone’s legs, their hands gripping heavy at his neck and back as he licks up, doing that dumb trick with his tongue that still gets ‘em all every time. All that contact makes his head swim too pleasantly. Still, it’s been a long time since he’s been with a dude — honestly, with anyone, but guys especially — but he remembers enough, and starts with long, hard swipes with his tongue up the underside of Cas’ erection. It’s already all wet, precome striping it.
“Nailed it.” Dean lets his head fit in the space between Cas’ head and his shoulder, enough that Cas’ stubble rasps against his own. It’s not gentle, but it’s a comfort. Dean would laugh, because they’ve definitely reached super-sappy cliché status, but he’s tired, tired, tired. It’s so easy to let his body fit into Cas’ warm arms and meet his lips.
In the next few months, Dean and Cas have their shitty moments, sure. Dean’s learning the hard way, both of them are, that trauma takes
easy to get through with the cops guiding traffic – but the protests must be getting bad. Whenever he’s on campus, even in the nursery, Dean hears indistinguishable chanting.
Their feet hang out the open door. They kick together a little when they move. Stupidly, it thrills Dean.
?” Sam asks, like he doesn’t know every single definition of the word that appears on dictionary-dot-com. Nerd.
Vaporeon’s skin is wetter than he remembered. A lot of it’s probably due to his tears. He’s pretty sure no one’s gonna hold it against him.
, Dean hardly even thought about her since Cas got captured, and Vaporeon – but here she is, shuffling toward him on her big clumsy bird feet.
“You wore teeth of the people you killed as a necklace,” Dean shoots back. There’s an ugly silence between the two of them for a couple of minutes; Dean doesn’t think he can leave the room on that note, but he doesn’t wanna keep talking either. He tugs words from himself anyway. “Why do you look like that, then? If you don’t know Jimmy.”
Naomi is there, too, stark as ever. There’s a large space around her, like she built an actual physical barrier there.
Chuck is obviously biting back a massive grin when they turn back to him. “These are for you,” he tells them, holding out two stone tablets. They’re smaller than Kevin’s Word of God, but in the same script.
“I tortured in Hell,” Dean says, his way of answering. “Cas found me, and I was carvin’ someone up. Oh, sure, the guy was a sleazy subprime lender, probably ruined more people’s lives than any vamp ever could. But his guts were in my teeth. I was
Dean comes on his cock, and it’s another jolt to the base of his spine. Castiel even uselessly rolls his hips a few times, trying to find more friction somewhere.
“Uh,” Dean says, intelligently, because he’s not sure he knows any more than Cas does what Lucifer was singing about.
Castiel’s wings are whole and full now. He extends them, larger in number than they were before. They’re the pink and gold of the most achingly beautiful sunset Castiel has seen, from a quiet beach on the coast of Crete while he dipped blessed beads into the ocean. He no longer truly has feathers, just long sprays of white and translucency mixed with the colors of his wings, and shooting out. Inexplicably, it reminds him of the grind of a motor revving up as a car turns on.
“Help me, then,” Cas tells him, propping himself up on his elbows. He does it effortlessly, Dean notices and appreciates. “I’m new to this.” There’s a wry tilt to his voice.
“I don’t know. Everyone. You, definitely. Cas, ‘cuz he’s fuckin’ gone, and he was stupid enough to care. And me, because – because it’s all my fault, anyway.”
This kind of weather at least gives him an excuse for not going outside, and he’s tempted to do nothing but move his butt to bed and try to get to sleep. Instead, he finds himself tugging on his boots and tossing on a couple of button-ups, before he wanders up and up and up through the bunker, walking up staircases he’s almost sure he’s never taken before. His footsteps thunk on every metal step, almost as loud as the rain.
And she’s gone, practically gliding out the door of the — okay, they’re in a cabin, Dean would guess. The little crowd inside gets the fuck out of her way.
Virizion pauses in her fighting. She bends her front legs to kneel down, one long smooth graceful motion, and taps her horns against something small on the field. The little puff jumps up and lands on her back, and the two of them go charging back into battle. It takes Dean a moment until he realizes that was Gabriel’s Whimsicott, and she revived it with her touch.
“You didn’t see this one.” Dean moves Cas’ fingers until they touch his left shoulder. This tattoo’s covered up any time he has a t-shirt on, so it feels right that Castiel is one of the few people to actually see it. It’s a ring of dazzling neon blue, where the brightness of it makes even Vaporeon’s vivid scales seem dull. Dean went to tattoo parlor after tattoo parlor looking for the right color to capture it. “That night. It meant a lot.”
“Trust me, I was not planning on sharing any details of – you.” Cas’ voice cuts out funny when Dean’s tongue makes a circuit around his navel. Goosebumps pop up in the wake of Dean’s trail, and he moves to taste all of them.
love her dirty jokes and ridiculous innuendo, but she’s also smart and tough as hell and is entirely serious about her job when the situation requires it. In the weeks to come, Dean will watch her waltz right through panicked herds of Tauros and Bouffalant to find one of them that broke his leg and has been moaning loudly enough to hear it from the main hub. When she walks through the herd, they easily part for her.
Cas’ hand moves at a steady pace, wrist snapping into a twist when he reaches the top. If there’s a generic way to jerk someone off, this is it, but it’s working for Dean anyway. The rhythm picks up when Dean desperately hitches his hips, over and over, pushing him further and further into Cas’ grip and that – oh, that’s
He lets his head loll against Cas’ shoulder. The warmth of him sinks right through the leather jacket; Purgatory’s cold, cold enough that Dean can feel it in his gut and sunk into his bones, and Cas’ warmth zips up his spine and tingles in his forearms and thighs and back, a sensation that Dean just flat-out forgot about. For a minute, it puts him on edge, the newness of it, until he exhales and lets it bleed deep into him.
“It’s safe,” Cas informs him. And oh, great, the Leviathan’s actually curled along his shoulders now like a friggin’ scarf. Awesome. Cas’ll probably be opening up an arts-‘n’-crafts booth to make the guy a friendship bracelet next.
in a neutral, tinny robotic voice. The e-mails bounce back, and there’s something wrong with that, but Dean still waits for some sign from Sam, somehow. It doesn’t come. He shouldn’t be surprised by now.
That fingernail is the same as the others, now. It’s an appropriate length for a human male, but whole and rounded. Unlike previously, he doesn’t feel Jimmy’s stirs. His constant hum of energy had been like Castiel’s own wings and halo, but it is gone.
“Zachariah never goes anywhere. Too many people to ingratiate himself to here.” Cas is looking anywhere but at his phone.
Meg actually smiles back, and yeah it’s half-mockingly sweet because it wouldn’t be Meg otherwise, but it’s also part genuine. “Look, from the bottom of my tar-smeared little heart that doesn’t even remember what the word means, I really am happy for you guys. I was rooting for you, believe it or not! It’s about fucking time.”
“I know,” Cas says. Dean at least slid his hands out from inside Cas’ pants, but Cas’ palms still cup his cheeks. His wrists shake, and the idea of Cas being as overwhelmed by this as Dean is kinda blows his mind a little. Now, though, the touch soothes him. “Remember? I know. And it’s alright now, Dean.”
There’s plenty of good over at the sanctuary, of course. The workers are now all working fairly extensively with some brand new rescue Pokemon: Lucas’ Hydreigon, Roman’s Snorlax, Abaddon’s Tentacruel, and Azazel’s Hypno. For all the bragging their owners did about modifying DNA and wiping out years of evolution, it looks like their concoctions only worked temporarily. But the Pokemon are still traumatized, and they need a lot of care.
As if on cue, one of the Torchics who’s shot up quick since he first came here rushes over to Dean best as he can on his bird feet, and starts nipping at his arm. “Ow,” Dean snips back at the Torchic, but there’s affection in his voice. It’s almost always like this when Dean is here, a dizzy rush of tiny Pokemon making every noise imaginable and trying to ingratiate themselves for any food at all. He loves it. “Thanks, Charlie.”
Cas spreads him open and Dean goes with it, so easy for him. He uses a lot of lube, enough that it drips down from Dean’s body, and touches Dean everywhere while he opens him up. Dean shivers when Cas skims his collarbone; he’s man enough to admit he
“I just – I need to say this. To you, and not – someone who looks like you. Or a memory of you. And not when either one of us is on our deathbed, Jesus.” He takes a breath. His stomach trembles under Cas’. “I love you. Okay? I – I love you.” He ducks his head and laughs, but draws his eyes back up to meet Cas’ only a beat later. “Love of my life.”
Sometimes, Purgatory looks like a painting, one of those styles Dean recognizes but couldn’t name exactly. Sammy was the art history dork, anyway. It’s all rapid flares of paintbrush across canvas, gooey yellow and green and red paint dripping. He looks into the distance and his breath will stick in his throat for just a second, because it’s so beautiful. Terrifying, too — if everything else is like paint, is that him, too? He wants to know who’s twisting the paintbrush with their wrist.
“Yeah,” Dean says. It’s simple agreement, but then he’s thinking about just how well he worked with that mysterious figure and his blazing
to Gilda, and Dean wished he had the balls to ask her to tag along. He’d played the most rudimentary versions of that game on some ancient console when he lived on the road, and as it turned out, he had damn good aim.
Dean comes to in a goddamn cage. It’s a big cage, sure, but it’s still a cage, and he uselessly curls his hands around the bars and shakes them. For now, there’s nothing beyond him but a big white room, too brightly lit. At least he’s pretty sure
“But not this. I’d never stop you from this.” She pauses long enough to let the words sink in. “Does Sam know?”
He twirls up through the air, a black ribbon undulating this way and that to avoid the barrage of leaves. There’s so much of it, though, and now some of the trees are getting caught up in the green-flecked tornado. Their roots snag in his scales and he moans, loud enough that some of them on the ground below have to stumble to keep their balance.
When he wakes up, Cas is gone, but Dean doesn’t feel lonely or abandoned. He just gets out of the car, shrugs his jacket closer to his body, and starts walking toward Sammy’s cabin.
as his back hits, sending chunks of rock to the ground, filling the cave with dust. Because the darkness wasn’t bad enough already.
? We’re making plans now?” A wry grin makes its way onto Abigail’s face as she pulls her shower cap off, then drops the towel in order to get dressed.
But he’s breathing. His eyes are open, and even defiant. He’s still very much alive, and definitely conscious.
plastic. And he doesn’t have anyone to lean against; he’s only got his bedsheets, and they’re not warm until he rolls up against them.
“Good,” Cas responds, and there’s a little smile playing at his lips at the same time his voice already sounds — well — honestly, Dean’s been trying to keep himself under control so he didn’t shoot off in his goddamn
But Dean looks out at the scene in the police station with his arm slung around Cas. There are people he knows – Sam and Amy are crouched down to talk to a couple of little kids, which makes a smile spread so suddenly over Dean’s face it practically clicks on – and those he doesn’t. But that kind of joy he’s found here, the type that bubbles up and fills the room, he’s going to try to chase it for the rest of his life.
Dragons resist Grass-type attacks, and Tropius is flagging. His path up to Giratina is wobbly, coming in fits and starts. Every few meters or so, he’s stuck pathetically flapping in mid-air, unable to fly up farther, hoping a gust of wind doesn’t push him right back down to the ground. None of this is a good idea.
The last time Dean saw thunder crack the sky, back in Washington, that thunderstorm was the one thing that finally drove him back inside and off the beach. Or, more accurately, it had sent Sam outside to hoist him up by one arm. Over the driving rain, Sam had been saying something – screaming it, really – but fuck if Dean could make it out. Until Sam started howling
“I had to.” And geez, Dean’s voice sounded wrecked, sure, but he sounded sweet as Page doing “Stairway to Heaven” when you compare him to Sam. Sam’s eyes are all watery, too, the dweeb. “I wasn’t gonna leave you there — you too, Cas —”
“You’re losing me with this metaphor.” Dean’s surprised at how light his voice sounds now. Claire’s a good kid.
. He can just picture Sammy’s wide-eyed, stupid-ass expression of sympathy that he doesn’t deserve one bit, too.
Or maybe it’s not. If they survive this, there’s going to be not just a city but a whole damn continent, maybe the world, to clean up. There’s going to be lots of time to get to know his brother again.
And yet as long as Dean’s been alive, communication flowed from region to region. Talking to someone in another region was as easy as pressing a button. The Pokemon had always been there, and the communication and tech companies always found a way to work with them. Until they weren’t interested any more.
“Your Staraptor’s cool,” Dean says one day, when the Staraptor in question is staring down her beak at the nursery’s assortment of baby Flying-types. There’s a Doduo with big bald patches in his feather growth, and she seems as fond of that little guy as she does of anyone. Which is to say, not all that much, but she’s tucked him under her wing and is grooming his scraggly feathers thoroughly.
“You carry that around with you?” she asks by way of greeting. She tries to keep her voice light, but he’s six and a half feet tall and carrying around what might as well be a machete. It’s probably magical, too, what with the way these guys seem to operate. “Sleep with it under your pillow?”
“And notoriously headstrong and difficult to train,” Cas offers as response, stroking one of Staraptor’s puffy wings. For her part, Staraptor’s stopped caring for the Doduo in order to look at Dean rather skeptically.
“Azazel and Lilith had a daughter,” Bela explains, very slowly. “She got away a long time ago. She had to make herself from the ground up, and she realized she would treat Pokemon well enough, in some attempt to
A loud, dismissive snort comes from close to Dean. Surprisingly, it’s not from Michael. “If you’re so proud of it, pick on someone with your level of training, Michael.”
Right now, though, Castiel is just standing in a dressing room, wearing a jacket and jeans that are probably a size too big for him, arms stretched out. He might know nuclear physics better than any human, but he’s got no idea how to go shopping and he got childishly frustrated over a torn coat. Dean has explained a bunch of pop culture references to him and he
Dean is starting to like crazy Cas, the one who rambles on about how honey is the most superior food of all because it doesn’t spoil, much better than the one who gazes at him with those ridiculous eyes and looks like he wants to Talk. Not talk. Capital-T Talk.
“Jack is – he’s not a bad kid,” Dean says, after he’s done licking the last of his sandwich crumbs off his finger. Kinda gross, but the sandwich was just that good. People really gotta stop saying “crumbs” like they’re a bad thing, anyway, when it’s really all about the bread you get it from. (It doesn’t hurt that Cas licks the crumbs off his finger, too, and his tongue flicks out pinkly.)
fitting that he two of them had found each other and taken themselves out of the running for everyone else. They owned, respectively, a Hypno and a Drifblim, and brainwashed them to play into every bad and untrue stereotype about those Pokemon. Hypno put people to sleep, and then Drifblim dragged them away to their own fighting ring.
“You saw that, right?” Dean asks. Cas nods. Surprise has given him a wide-eyed look, something Dean doesn’t see on his face too often.
He’s not surprised when he feels a hand on his shoulder, and thankfully it’s friend, not foe. “Cas,” he says, as Staraptor disentangles her claws from Cas’ now somewhat shredded shirt and goes right after a Castform dusting snow over Hannah’s Tropius. “Thank God.” He grapples at Cas’ middle, something too desperate to be called a hug, but he tenses up when there’s no motion from Cas to return the gesture.
“I feel you on that one,” Dean says. Vaporeon’s crawled out of the water by now, and under the crook of his arm. She flicks her tail back and forth, spattering the three of them with water droplets.
All he does, though, is close the door, and lean heavy against it. His heart’s still going stupid fast.
Cas stands still for a couple of seconds, until – Dean knows it’s coming, but he still has to catch his breath, because there it is, the blue light. The blue light that ran through his dreams for years, the blue light that made it so he could stand here and marvel over it another day, the blue light that he immortalized on his shoulder, the blue light that
Castiel used to be able to see everything. Being called to the sprawling Singer Salvage never bothered him, however shabby the upkeep, because he saw beyond its walls. The ruined cars drew his interest in particular, because he glanced at them and saw the stories inside. They were ponderous things, yes, but he saw hunts and trips to the supermarket alike etched into their wheels. Castiel saw the whole map of the Midwest in minute detail, every dirt road and the clumps of wheat alongside the highway.
It should probably hurt, fucking Cas against the hollows of his hips. He’s got pretty goddamn (bad word choice, maybe) exquisite hipbones, but they push out from his skin so prominently they’re almost actually sharp. But it doesn’t hurt, it’s hot and downright glorious. Cas’ cock catches his thigh, his balls, brushing up against his hole a few times, and Dean sucks a kiss from his mouth to distract himself. He can’t come, not yet (and thank God for the cock ring).
, a sort of desperate thrashing with wild abandon accompanied by spilling their drinks until the floor gets sticky. Dean can spy Becky trying to dance with her Munna while that goddamn “Call Me Maybe” song plays.
And then embarrassment sinks in. Almost all of Emmanuel’s come landed on his hand and he’s thankfully able to find a tissue and wipe it off before he tucks himself back in, but he just masturbated in a car while thinking of a client. There’s something inside Dean that makes Emmanuel
He’s counting his blessings he doesn’t have to deal with Staraptor on this, anyway. She criss-crosses from rafter to rafter, Cas clapping his hands at her in an attempt to get her attention. It’s an absolutely ridiculous sight.
Dean doesn’t understand this burst of optimism. Maybe it’s the chocolate. Cas holds his hand out to Dean, offering his squares to him wordlessly. His palm’s warm when Dean’s fingers scrape against it.
“How did you –” Dean starts. Cas puts a hand on his back, in a show of protectiveness. It makes him cut the crying, anyway.
They’re sitting down at the kitchen table, Cas with his hands curled around a cup of coffee that he repeatedly wafted toward his nose with a flat-out blissful look on his face, when he tells Dean, “I’ve been wrong to avoid you.” So the guy doesn’t beat around the bush much. “Taking off like that, it was wrong, and if Anna was here she’d apologize too. She’s not one for apologies, either, but an apology is what’s right. What Naomi said was a shock.”
that he had to give up Heaven, because he’s just got the — the — gigantic beauty of your soul, or something.” He’s still laughing as he says it, but there’s a serious undercurrent to his words. “Guess angels find cheeseburgers and whiskey real pretty.”
Cas looks exactly like the normal guy he isn’t in a gray t-shirt and jeans and that stupid baggy overcoat he loves and Dean loves pushing off him. “With you,” he says, with no further preamble, “I’m learning need and want are often two sides of the same coin.”
It’s not as if Castiel had never considered this before. He may have been a virgin in every sense of the word, but he knows it’s a way humans and angels alike convey affection. Angels cannot read minds without express permission, exactly, but they can sense louder thoughts, and that’s how he knew Dean desired this, too.
The silence stretches for several minutes, until Gabriel ruptures it with a way too loud peal of laughter. “Great joke,” she says. “Didn’t know you had much of a sense of humor.”
The sun catches her golden hair. She seems like the type of girl who’s equally at place on Village Bridge’s perfect beaches, and charging through a herd of enormous horse bugs.
. But others, others react in an instant and batter him with fists or bullets; they don’t hurt him, but Dean still feels himself flinch under Cas’ hands. (They run back over his shoulders, soothe him in return.) A couple of them rush toward Cas with an angel blade of their own, and Dean has to remind himself that he’s wrapped up in Cas, Cas, Cas, so he doesn’t puke.
“Guessing you’re Castiel,” she greets, as she offers up a hand. He glances at it the same as he looked at the food. “You’re not much like Inais, are you?”
Cas keeps trembling with the aftershocks, and Dean could use a massage to work out the stiffness in his joints. Poor Baby’s got sweat streaked against her upholstery and come all over; Dean owes her a good scrubbing and a half.
“How do you want to do this?” Dean asks, because he’s never been good at following orders that didn’t come from his father, ever. It’s odd to see him so gentle, questioning even, but Castiel knows the way sex hormones have always smoothed over Dean’s rougher edges because he’s always been watching him.
There’s obvious emotion on Cas’ face as he looks around every corner of the room, even if most of it’s just blank walls. Dean stifles the urge to roll his eyes. “Colt ain’t under the pillow this time,” he says instead.
The light from the grace doesn’t go out too far, but between that and the spotlights carving up the dry ground, Mary can see dozens of black wing prints stamped into the landscape. There are other angels guarding there too, trudging across their siblings’ remains without hesitation.
“Oh my God,” Naomi breathes when Dean walks by, a quiver in her voice. There’s legitimate horror on her normally placid face; he hasn’t ever seen her this shaky.
“No.” Cas looks at the box in his hands with open curiosity, before he returns his gaze to Dean’s face. When Dean puts the box on the table in front of him and opens it up, Cas grabs the money in his fists, crumples it up and lets it fall out onto the table. “I don’t understand this game.”
“Watch it, bucko,” Mary returns. Castiel shoots her another look, one that tells her he’s got no idea what she’s talking about, but he turns around and keeps walking anyway.
Guy’s got a pretty firm handshake. A long time ago, when the attack outside Shopping Mall Nine happened, Dean had decided Castiel was the firm grip type for sure. He’s been thinking about this moment for years, but that it’s happening seems like some wild, impossible dream, the kind of shit that doesn’t happen in his life.
“Leaving. Like, could you zap on out of here? I mean, you’re an angel. Where do you go when you disappear, anyway?”
Once she gets up to Dean, he finds himself crumpling down again so that he can hug her. She’s shaking in his arms, twitching like she flew face-first into a live wire.
He just nods. Every movement of his head rubs his stubbly cheek against Cas’ palm, and God, it’s the best reminder.
He really likes getting fucked, and sex is even better with Cas, the way he thrusts like a hot little punch every time and it jams up against that spot over and over. Cas can hold him down with just a palm on his lower back, and Dean is not admitting how fucking hot that is. And then it’s just as good to get Cas belly-up on the bed and open him up, slide into him and let himself feel greedy while he does it; Cas stares down with moon-wide eyes at where they come together, like Dean’s cock and Cas’ own puffy little hole stretched out to fit him is the most fascinating thing he’s seen in millennia.
“That’s not Chuck — well, not as you remember him,” Cas butts in, and it’s not helping the sloshing in Dean’s stomach that Chuck or not-Chuck or whoever slides his eyes from Dean to Castiel and back again and the beatific smile just gets bigger. “Remember Kevin’s Word of God, and who recorded it?”
As if she was summoned, Staraptor perches right on Cas’ shoulder. Dean can’t see her face from here, but her feathers have puffed up; her size must have increased by a full third, at least. He imagines that glare of hers trained on Alastair and smiles grimly.
Truth of it is, though, that Dean is fucking gone. He’s been thinking about those hands all over him; he wishes they’d stain him somehow, like a brand. Never thought this about hands before, but they’re
“Hey, man, you’re getting better at this manners thing. Congrats. Not that I’m much of a role model there –”
“You truly think you can stand here gawking and not fight?” says a cold, clear voice from right behind him.
him like that, and you know that. But it wasn’t fair to either of us. No, Cas wasn’t my dad. But he meant a lot to me, and – and if he meant half of what he did to me to you, then I’m sorry. Yeah, you messed up not calling me. But I’m sorry.”
No one at the camp even knows what to do with ‘em at this point; everyone tosses out the processed food they do find and watch them wordlessly stare at it.
Cas does so; his muscles flex so gorgeously when he tosses the shirt to the corner of the room, then pulls Dean on top of him. From this position, it’s easier for Dean to finally touch and kiss his fill of Cas’ chest; Cas doesn’t flip out when Dean puts tongue and teeth to his nipples like Dean does, but his lips part and he’s panting, so it’s good. It’s so good.
Dean’s been expecting this call, but he still cringes when he reads the name on the front of his phone. It had to happen sometime, though, so he squeezes his eyes shut and picks up.
Dean needs some damn human friends. He’s gotta get out of the mentality that he’s still on the road, and any minute now Sam’s gonna to burst through the door of his apartment and tell him they’ve gotta run off to the other side of the continent because he’s got a lead on… whatever the hell dad was ever looking for. That way of thinking’s stuck to him, an obstinate burr that clawed its way under his skin.
Castiel glowers from his position on the ground, chest lifted halfway up off the floor but his legs firmly stuck there. He may be chained to the floor, his wings held down thoroughly, but there’s a gauzy, heady wave of power surrounding him now. Dean tries to stay steady, but his head swims with it.
Dean pulls the knife out and studies it, because he hasn’t really paid it a ton of attention yet. Too busy getting distracted by — everything else. It’s halfway between knife and dagger, and he lets out a chuckle at the hilt; it’s a flared wing, feathers astutely carved.
, the sensation hard against his cheeks and slipping to his neck, down his spine, until it makes his balls and abs tighten.
There’s an enormous Granbull by the girl in the corner, his fists clenched tight and gargantuan jaws snapping over and over, as if he’s single-handedly determined to prove Fairy-type Pokemon can be scary as shit too. Dean is more shocked than scared, once he realizes the situation. That Granbull won’t be a Granbull for much longer.
Meg glances over at Dean, pointedly. “I’d think you’d be better at your dirty talk by now, Castiel.”
Cas’ kisses are hot enough that Dean feels like plumes of smoke should be rising off his skin wherever his lips fall. His hands rove Dean’s body, no path in mind, but Dean still puffs out a happy exhale as those hands ruck up his shirt. Cas’ palms cup the slight excess flesh on Dean’s stomach; Dean’s never seen any reason to be self-conscious about it, but Cas can’t get his hands off it.
happens it really needs to be perfect, not when sleep threatens him at any second. “No,” he responds. “Well, uh, lemme make this clear. Not
Dean comes back to himself eventually. He’s panting when he does. Cas dusts his fingers over his spent cock; his stomach and hand is streaked sticky white. His eyes meet Dean’s, and he looks stupidly – shy, somehow. “Was that alright?”
“Cas, please,” he asks the ink of the almost constant night here. He can’t even raise his voice to yell it; he’s
Of course he remembers Nimbasa. Sam’s disappearance warped the city’s bright colors, its ever-present carnival and its twinkly music, into Dean’s worst goddamn nightmare. Dad had finally found Sam a few days after he’d vanished, hanging out at an arcade flashing neon and sticky with cotton candy. “It was like he didn’t even care,” Dad growled, in a terrifying register. Dean never heard their confrontation, but it was enough that Sam was gone to Carver in a matter of months.
If Sam and Dean’s beds are too close together, if Dean could roll over to the edge of the cot and stretch his arm out and touch Sam’s, Dean isn’t gonna complain. He keeps waking up a few times in the middle of the night and God, his eyes have to
Two fingers push inside Dean. Greedy for their easy intrusion, Dean shoves his hips back against them instantly. They’re so wide and long, impossibly – inhumanly – warm. If Cas could get him off with just his tongue, he could definitely do it with his fingers.
“Abaddon and I go way back,” Delta explains. Great, the chick whose boots were on a first-name basis with his stomach is also apparently on a first-name basis with Delta. “We were
Dean has new skin, even despite the anti-possession tattoo, and he will have a new life. Castiel still worries about Dean’s scars, however. No matter how many times they’re wiped away, humans have ways of accumulating them, he’s realized through first-hand experience. Some angels, too.
Once they leave the dorm, Dean – well, he didn’t want to think it, but his mind kept spiraling and spiraling and spiraling around one thought from the second Nancy said she didn’t know where Sam was at all. “Do you think Sam is –”
for once, but he’s not so sure the best way to introduce himself to bottoming was getting brutally fucked five times in three hours with only  spit slicking the way.)
smile now. And yet the kind of hostility that constantly crackled between Sam and Meg is gone. Even after all that shit with the possession years ago, Sam seems okay with her here. Dean’s just back from Purgatory; this is a lot of shit to get used to. “When’d you get so…”
“Uh.” Dean gets out, because he can only remember the way his thoughts had circled around and around when he stood in that living room. Like, sure, he remembers Daphne’s hand skimming down his chest, but he’s pretty sure Cas mostly ignored it. “I dunno. Not like I’m the best guide to that, Cas.”
A slim man with a messy mop of hair is carrying two enormous water jugs back to a cabin. There’s no effort there, no loud grunting like Dean would do, no sheen of sweat over his skin; the muscles in his skinny arms don’t bulge. Definitely not human. Dean realizes he knows this guy a second before Castiel raises his head, offers him one of his close-mouthed but genuine smiles, and greets, “Inais.”
He pets Hydreigon’s side again, standing up, and leaves all tenderness there, summoning his fury again.
It’s like, one PM, and Dean’s thinking how ridiculous it is that they’re doing this now. Light shines through the windows with their sagging curtains that Sarah and Sam put up, and there’s all this activity in camp — but fuck, that’s outside, and inside it’s finally just Dean and Castiel, all they were, and all they are. All they could be.
If Dean opened his eyes right now, he’s sure he’d see those city lights blinking in front of them. He’s so glad they did this. Just them, the night, and their patiently-waiting Pokemon.
Later, when they’re all back in the central house and Michael’s shucked the wading boots and cover-up, he shows Dean a picture of him and Asher together in front of the gate. Thinking about Mary helping another family is strangely perfect. They’re both grinning toothily, though Asher’s mouth is silver with braces. Dean elbows Sam about their twin sandy bowl haircuts.
Dean rubs his tongue up the shaft, and wants to smile at the hot burst he feels against his tongue, and the pointed
“Look, so you guys are having a tiff,” Gabriel continues, back in the fridge now. She’s got a big head of lettuce under one arm, and Whimsicott under the other. It’s hard to tell them apart, and Dean’s tempted to laugh. That’s a new one, at least. “I’ve seen you two together, when he still graced our fair city with his presence. I’ve heard him talk about you.
Anna folds her arms, too. “My brother’s pretty tough. We – I don’t know how to fix him. I don’t. But there are ways out there, and he’s got you, Dean.”
“Wh-where the hell did you go?” Normally, he’d pretend he wasn’t totally freaked out by Cas vanishing and didn’t yelp Cas’ name into the darkness, as clear a noise as a hammer driving a nail down into wood. But there’s not much point in pretending, not now.
“I – after I killed Lucifer, I didn’t know what to do. So I did the only thing I could keep of. I kept fighting. I made it to Heaven in that other dimension, and I made an exchange. Lucifer’s head, for – you. Or the version of you from the other dimension.”
Andrea owns a Dragonair, and a Pokemon that powerful would have made her close to famous in quiet Village Bridge. Here in Opelucid, though, she’s just another trainer with a Dragon type, and not even a fully-evolved one. Dean sees four or five Dragonairs a day, and even a couple of Dragonites.
Sam’s phone buzzes again. He’s not sure if he appreciates the distraction or it’s just going to make him more paranoid.
Cas takes a beat to look at Dean, then offers up a terrifyingly awkward, “Oh, we, uh, take a very early ferry. We are very tired every day. Yawn.” Yes, Cas actually says
Most tame Pokemon are trained to be distantly friendly with other Pokemon unless they’re family, or their owners give them permission to play. What’s in front of Dean is a total rarity; in general, Pokemon don’t end up coiled around each other, especially just to go lax in sleep. Not unless their owners are awfully close.
“Yeah, you’re fine,” he comes up with, after what’s probably way too long. “We’ll get you some more shirts in that size, maybe a belt.” He looks at Cas pointedly. “You go get some underwear you want.” God, this is embarrassing for reasons he can’t even pinpoint.
Cas pushes his hips back, going as slowly as possible, making sure Dean can take it. He can take more than this for sure, and he’s goddamn
“Yeah,” Dean continues, voice lower now. “So I made a deal. My soul for Sam’s life. Tried to find a way out of it for a year, but –”
“You too, Cas,” Dean calls out, to a nod. But all Cas does after that is grimly strap on one of those earloop face masks to avoid Paras’ spores.
He’s got no idea what’s going on, but tension suddenly strikes him. He’s been simmering in low-level tension with Cas this entire ride, and whenever he’s around really, but this tension is nothing like that. It’s swift and sharp and
“Wanna ride you for real,” Dean moans, rucking up Cas’ shirt. Hips still moving, he leans down to lick a circle around Cas’ nipples. The jolt in response makes Cas buck up against his mouth and it’s fucking wonderful.
. He doesn’t think Cas, with his perpetually rumpled clothes and hair, would be some kind of snob, but Dean’s been surprised by too many people in
When he gets dressed, he pulls his henley off well aware Cas’ eyes are on him, tracing over the broad lines of his shoulders and the twin bumps of his shoulderblades. His back isn’t as covered with tattoos as his arms are, but a couple of them are definitely visible from the back; he’s also got his dad’s dog tags tattooed over his hip, because he’s nothing if not an overly sentimental sucker, even for people who didn’t deserve it. He knows he has a cluster of freckles at the small of his back, and the idea of Cas’ eyes zeroing in on them makes a hunger rise up in him, swift and vehement.
There’s a long silence, both of them breathing in the near-darkness. Until Dean speaks up. “Wise man once said,
Hannah and Uriel pooled their money together to ship them a huge, gorgeous bed, the kind that will keep them warm in a couple of months when all that stands between them and the winter winds are the sparse tree groves on Village Bridge. Dean was able to refrain from making brain-scarring jokes about christening said bed. Of course, Gabriel made them instead.
“I guess that’s not the important part. You were just so — you were totally human, but not because of anything you chose other than stickin’ around and the other angels ditching you. And it made you so hopeless, man. Me, I was just — I had to see myself shoot people in the head with no warning, Cas. I was trying to keep shit under control when that’s not me. Sam had said yes to Lucifer.” He lets himself get quiet for a few beats, because what he saw there isn’t ever going to leave his head. “It blew.”
Vaporeon curls up by his side, and Dean finds himself looking out across the water, past all the friggin’ yachts that dot the harbor. There’s a long green strip of land far off in the distance, and Dean can’t stop staring at it. Feels like punishment.
It soon becomes pretty damn clear why. There’s a college student in the road, doing nothing but standing there. She isn’t very tall and she’s certainly not intimidating, but something about the way she carries herself is tough as hell. Dean sees a spark of himself in the way her chin lifts up, her arms cross, her eyes stay like flint; he has to look away at the prickle of recognition.
“There was this woman, on a case – God, must have been fifteen years ago.” The Layla Rourke Memorial Fund, modest as it is, donates all proceeds to pediatric cancer research; Dean looked it up a few months after the case. Every year, he stuffs a five dollar bill in an envelope with no return address and sends it to the fund. “She told me once that you couldn’t just have faith in the good times. You had to have it when the miracles didn’t happen, too. Now, I ain’t an optimist, and neither are you. But maybe you should keep it in mind.”
Lucas wasn’t married, and he didn’t have any other family. He had lots of political rivals, because the guy was kind of a firebrand asshole for his causes, but they all had alibis that checked out. Still, Dean had figured at the time, all it took was one extremist.
When Dean leaves the training center, he’s laughing along with Cas. But he can’t stop thinking about the atmosphere in the room when they first came in, how quiet and still and goddamn creepy it was.
Everyone gets hit when the water and wind crash together in front of the goons, and Dean finds himself splattered, but the gang gets it the worst. They fly back sopping wet, resembling nothing more than squishy sacks of flour. It’s a glorious sight, so many of them on the ground hardly able to move.
It’s still serious. Charlie’s got a short shift that day, and she goes home only a few hours later. She’s going to get, according to her, some
“Your boy is an excellent chef,” Uriel declares, nodding toward Cas and patting his stomach as he finishes his last bite of his burger.
expecting the hot flare that swoops up from his stomach to his throat, and makes him gasp out loud and stagger back. He’s so not expecting the world to go blurry and blaze up in gold, before —
“Thank you,” Dean says, before they do move off. “For the, uh, consolation. Ain’t your fault, obviously. And it’s not gonna bring her back. But it – it means a lot.”
Meg seems wearier than she ever did before, when that obnoxious little smile of hers was constantly spread out over her face. It’s still there, it’s just a
But the levee never got its chance to break. Now Dean’s left with nothing else but another lyric in that song:
That’s when he remembers Cas is right behind him. Like hell Dean is going to be intimidated by someone wearing a belly shirt. “Excuse me,” he says in return, trying to sound casual and failing. He elbows through the protesters, trying not to care about the darts of their glares thrown right toward his back. The crowd thins out, eventually, and by the time he gets to the entrance to the nursery, only one person’s waved a placard in his face in the past hundred feet or so.
“I was proud,” Dean says. “Am still. I’m just worried I’ve lost the kid.” He drags a hand over his face. “Referring to him in the past tense, God. The situation’s so fucked up. We had a big fight at my dad’s funeral, and – nothin’ since. Tried to e-mail him, tried to call, but there’s nothing.”
“Something’s gotta be going on,” Dean grumbles, and gets out of his seat to check up front. All he can see are the squat, uniform buildings of Edlund’s campus. There are a few stops within Edlund, and the bus won’t arrive at the one closest to the nursery for at least another ten minutes.
A long time passes before either of them speaks. “There was initial shock, but Lucifer went away early,” Castiel sighs. “He kept — he was trying to sing. All angels do what you would consider singing, it’s one of the things your greeting cards and Christmas celebrations get right, but his songs were…”
“I’m the reckless type, what can I say.” Dean’s honestly impressed with the humor in his voice; his heart still thuds hard inside the shell of his chest.
Next to Dean, Sam grunts as he tosses the last of their luggage into the trunk of the Impala. “I was sad to say goodbye to Meg,” he tells Dean, contemplative. “I know crazy, and man, that’s….”
Castiel blinks at him. Much like with his doppelganger, Dean wonders how he conveys annoyance with that action alone. There’s a silence, and Dean worries he’s ruined the moment, until Castiel continues. “It’s love I don’t understand. Your brother, your mother. The other Castiel.”
Cas smiles at her, briefly, nothing more than a quirk of the lips. “The world needs more Pokemon trainers like you, Maeve. Does anyone want to pet the Barboach?”
Castiel nods at him. Dean is not super cool with the idea of an angel soldier who only ever knew war and destruction being friendly with the most powerful being in their universe, but for once, he bites his tongue. “I just want to go home.”
Speak of the devil. (Which is just a bad choice of words for anyone in Dean’s life, now that he thinks about it. Especially when you shot the guy in the head and saw him stand up again.) Sam’s standing at the entrance to the camp, this obnoxious little
Suddenly, a wall of noise slams into Dean, and the screams he can hear are torn from his own throat because he’s hurtling through the air, crashing down down down, until –
“Well,” Dean pushes on, “you went on a pretty crazy journey, right? Cliffs Notes ain’t gonna cut it. I wanna see it all.”
Dean’s got no idea what the guy’s talking about, other than his books. In response, he makes a noise that is absolutely not a grunt, because that would be rude. “I don’t know Enochian.”
The lake is vast, and the room’s so dark it’s hard to see much in the distance. But at the other end, so far off it might be a full mile away, light rises up from what seems like the floor itself. It’s soft light, but with the darkness of the cave it makes the edge of the room into a stark silhouette. It reminds Dean of nothing so much as a halo.
“Victory Road,” Dean breathes, as its curves and intimidating craiggy caves come into view. “Always wanted to go there.” He’s never actually been, because even John couldn’t sneak them past the heavy security, but he’s seen pictures. Place is dangerous as hell, but it’s also breathtaking sienna steppes and a cornflower sky, so damn gorgeous it’d make
At some point, Cas looped his arm around Dean’s back. It’s stupidly comforting. “It isn’t the latter,” he tells Dean. Dean should tell him to fuck off, because Cas doesn’t understand shit about his life just because Dean let out a couple of details like a leaky faucet. But again, the stupid comfort thing. “I know
That hasn’t been the hard part, is the point. No, the hard part’s him finding someone of any gender that he wants to be with, and watching it all fall apart.
“Hi, uh, Nancy?” Dean says. She looks up from her textbook, and almost immediately, the sadness in her eyes slats over to boredom. It’s an incongruous reaction, considering they’re strange men here in the middle of the night. Again, something ain’t right here. “Dean Winchester and Castiel Malach,” he offers, sliding their IDs over. She checks it and doesn’t look impressed. “I’m here to see my brother.”
He’s glad to have pretty much everyone he knows on this boat, too, but his nerves crest more than he was expecting on the ride over. Very stubbornly, the waves push and pull the boat and Dean’s stomach alike up and down, up and down. Dean manages to stay out on the deck with Cas, but he has to keep squeezing his hand.
Dean’s taken a lot of blows to the head. Had a lot of concussions. One of the worst occupational hazards, actually. But none of it has ever felt so sudden as the fury baring its sharp teeth inside him at that moment.
He closes his eyes, blocking out Sam’s strange, piercing look, like he was trying to puzzle out why, exactly, his brother’s in such a bad mood after last night. Good fuckin’ luck guessing.
Cautiously, he looks out the front window of the car. The sun is setting in the quiet little town, and though other cars pass by occasionally, there are no people milling around. He pushes back against the seat, and carefully draws his zipper down, undoing the button at the top of his pants. When he pulls himself out, he’s already flushed nearly purple, like he’s been wanting it for hours. In a way, he has.
“Or red,” Anna adds. “I – I remember too. Not that I remember much but distracting Zachariah while I snuck out.”
The hunter part of her relies on logic. And it’s a good part of her, a strong part of her, a part of her she knows she’ll never get away from. But the part of her that keeps pushing Castiel forward – an outsider might mistake that for the hunter side of her, too, but it’s a different one entirely.
“Thought you might burn the place down with these,” Dean says, holding up his plate. This is the military-style bedmaking of sandwiches. Cas probably studied.
Cas doesn’t respond, and Dean figures he doesn’t agree. But it’s better than another argument. “So I can stay?” he asks, at last. His voice sounds – small, diminished somehow, and Dean hates himself a lot for ever making Cas sound that way.
“I’m just glad you’re okay,” Sam says, quieter now. Even more muffled, he gets out, “I’m glad we got this, at least.”
Immediately, he presses his arm over his mouth; much like in Mt. Coronet, all the fighting has kicked up a nasty storm of dirt. Figures emerge out of the dim light and duck right back into it. It seems impossible to fight in these conditions, but there’s enough noise and commotion – and some piercing
“Cas, he, uh, he wasn’t you,” Dean says when they’re outside the door to the dungeon. All Dean has to do is push it open, but he finds he can’t, not yet. “Sometimes, just talking to him, it helped, but – he wasn’t you. Sure as hell didn’t act like you. Not even when I first met you, and you had a pretty big stick up your ass then.” He lets himself laugh, before speaking seriously again. “You gotta know that, man.”
Dean realizes those are the first words Cas has said to Naomi since the big battle. He squeezes Cas’ hand under his.
Dean finally manages to get out “kinky” in response, but it’s like seven minutes later when Cas’ hair is all messed up and Dean’s hands have slipped inside both of his overshirts, and he’s definitely thinking that unless they get out of Macy’s, like, now, they’re probably going to
“You alright?” he asks anyway. Her feet are filthy and the seams have burst on the bottom of one of her pant legs, leaving it ragged.
“Not worried about some other things,” Dean says, knowing his brow is heavy. Cas’ eyes have darkened to navy.
Dean’s never seen Abaddon as anything less than utterly unflappable. Even with a fucking corpse at her feet, she did nothing but turn a vicious smile at it. This feels right, her crawling her way up from the ground and screaming in agony to do it.
he can feel other than the warmth of it, but with the way his leg is wrapped around Cas, God, there’s only Dean’s normal boring underwear and Cas’ fucking awesome panties in between so much skin pressed together.
The attack hits Hypno square in the chest, and frost grows out from the point of impact. Hypno staggers a couple of feet back, but it’s not even clumsy. Really, they’re more like deliberate steps to recaliberate her balance. The spot of ice starts contracting as quickly as it was expanding, until there’s nothing left.
That’s when Dean knows he’s gotta get the fuck out of the shack. His life might have cracked the fuck open and spilled out, but there are still others out there. Cas wanted nothing more than to have the people who were hurting
“How did I know you’d be a big enough dork to know what this is for? But, yes, I’m promoting my little LARPing get-togethers.”
“Cas wasn’t my dad,” Claire grits out on the other side of the line. “There was a time when I was, you know, pretty messed up, and I thought about
,” Dean all but hisses, snatching the Jolteon jumpsuit off the rack – the thing is seriously bright yellow, not even the pretty, muted maize of Charlie’s Ninetales cosplay but practically neon, and bearing a white spiky collar – and storming off into the dressing room. He catches a glimpse of two sets of wounded-looking eyes, from Charlie and Vulpix alike.
Castiel continues, “This world, your world. It taught me – other emotions. I’ve seen anger, yes, but the kind that comes from caring too much. Fear of
Charlie, of course, likes to say that the nursery’s newfound success is entirely due to her new logo. It’s pretty hard to forget. Jody’s Grotle is on it, Pokemon resting at his feet while tiny baby Flying-types perch on his back. But dead center is Tessa’s Absol, staring straight forward as a challenge. He’s sitting right on top of the logo, paws curled around baby Pokemon, protecting them.
“Did you,” Dean says, just as mock-casually. Fuck the mini-bar. He’s walking over to Cas, now, and dropping to his knees for this time around. Toys are really fucking great, but so is his mouth, thank you very much. And so are angel boyfriends, even when they’re glossy-eyed with inhuman heat. Maybe especially so.
Screams echo from below. They aren’t pleasant sounds to hear. There are Pokemon mixed in with them, too, and that’s what really gets Dean. He twirls around and around through the air, rolling over and over in the sky, like Alastair and Mewtwo shoved him down a hill. He wants to be sick, if only he could
“I get it,” Sam says, nodding, “Trust me, I do.” The funny thing about his relationship with Sam was that Dean felt like his brother
“Kali,” Gabriel says, the word full of such naked sentiment it shocks Dean. Gabriel leans forward and kisses the hell out of Kali. Seriously, Dean’s pretty sure he can see tongue. When Gabriel moves away, she’s grinning in a wide and completely uninhibited way. The dirt’s mostly caked on her face now, but she shows no sign of caring about that.
Dean wishes he had the right words to say to that — it’s the kind of shit where it’s not okay, but he understands — but he doesn’t, so he just nods. “Weird shit happened during the apocalypse,” he offers, weakly. It’s true enough. “How are you here, I saw —”
“I don’t mean to badmouth her,” Cas says. “It’s not like Naomi hasn’t helped people. When she worked more extensively with the police, she brought down not only Alastair –” Dean shudders at that, involuntarily, but he flashes a grin when he catches Cas eyeing him with concern – “but Lilith and Azazel too.”
“We text, if you can believe it. But yes, it will be good to see her.” Cas takes a few strides forward, and not missing a beat, catches Dean’s cheek in his spare hand. They kiss, and Cas’ mouth tastes like orange juice. The fuckin’ domesticity of it thrills Dean to the core. When they separate, Cas carefully inspects the note. “Mary told us to
“Hey,” he says to Cas, throwing the bed covers off. He’s greeted by exactly what he suspected, which has gotta be one of the best damn sights in the world, Cas with two of his amazing fingers shiny with lube speared inside himself. He’s fucking up into them, precise, measured motions. “You couldn’t wait for me to get the fun started?” Dean whispers, rolling his entire body over to get on top of Cas and kiss him into oblivion. It’s even better when he can work his fingers into Cas, figure out just how to open him up and get him
“Dean.” He still recognizes that voice. Cas has gone back to his human form too, and now he’s hoisting Dean from the ground and slinging his arm around his shoulder to keep him upright. “Are you –”
“It wasn’t real, Cas.” That’s all he can come up with, pathetic as it sounds. Not that Dean wants to see too many of Cas’ megadouche brothers and sisters again either, but he deserves none of this shit.
As for the building, it’s a beautiful gleaming silver. The various buildings around it are squat, and look merely gray against the chrome of Naomi’s training center, frosted over so he can still look at it easily despite the sun. It’s a hulk of a building, stretching the length of a city block, but sleek as well.
Her tail whips out at Staraptor, who’s reappeared by Dean’s side. All it succeeds in doing, though, is driving Staraptor back. She’s moving too slowly to strike a solid blow.
“Dean, I say this with pride, but the only things in all of creation that gossip more than angels? Are demons.” At that one, she just offers up that grin that still sorta makes Dean want to clock her. It’ll never really stop, but at least he’s got new memories of her, Meg lopping off the head of some Leviathan bearing over Dean and not even bothering to pause for his acknowledgement as she stomped off to check if the other demons that were apparently her
They must’ve planted a lot of ragweed out here. At least, that’s what Dean’s telling himself looking out at the wide field, because that’s when he just fuckin’ loses it. Second time today. The world before him smears with blurred tears as he sinks onto a conveniently-located bench. (There are a lot of ‘em around here. All pretty, all handcarved just like the furniture in the main farmhouse.) Cas couldn’t rush over any faster, and even through the tears Dean’s sure he could sketch Cas’ painfully earnest, concerned expression from memory now.
“You’re wonderful, Dean,” Cas tells him, at last, quite plainly but in a way that blooms color on Dean’s cheeks.
It’s only a couple minutes later when Eileen’s car rumbles into the plain, which is empty except for the road and the fire, sizzling to ash now. Krissy’s picked up her shovel again, and she’s started digging a shallow grave where they’ll pile that ash. Unpleasantly, Sam thinks of the time Gabriel had Dean stay dead for six months, and Sam obsessed over organizing the weapons in the Impala. Making the beds, all hospital corners. Making sure every hunt went perfect, to make up for the one where everything went wrong.
“Yes,” Cas returns, and his voice is low but firm. Firm like his grip as he reaches down and pulls his shirt off, and Dean finally gets his hands on him, and sure no actual sparks go off but it’s warm and so close and
“You’re very wrong.” Cas shrugs forward a couple of inches, but it’s enough to press their chests together. They’re this warm with way too many clothes on, and Dean aches for skin on skin. “I’ll kiss you in the morning, if you don’t mind.”
“It wasn’t entirely useless chatter,” Cas says, that same fondness in her voice. “She managed to tell me she got to the wreckage of Marv’s hideout. Only her. Also told me not to ask how she got there.”
Dean visibly swallows at Sam’s question. The smirk drops just as quickly and obviously as if he’d been physically holding it up. “That it’s gonna hurt like a son of a bitch for a long time yet,” he says, after a while. “That there’s no normal after what she’s lost. That hurt is – it’s okay to feel it sometimes.”
Starly’s pretty common. It’s not unthinkable this Staraptor is a momma, using her protective instincts. Dean cuts that thought off fast, because it can’t go anywhere good. That’s when he hears a voice, pitched low and full of gravel, command, “Sky Attack!”
Dean tells Cas as much over dinner that night. Vaporeon keeps giving Dean wary looks, which probably means it’s a horrifically bad idea. Dean’s sure it is, but he’s fuckin’ tired of the world being caught in this standstill. It’s gotta break.
Even with Gilda’s help, the nursery remains loud and busy. Dean’s tending to one of the ponds, where mostly Feebas and Barboach swim about, the two species awkward and ungainly; in a place like Opelucid that gives way to a lot of Pokemon trainers, it’s way too common for wannabe trainers to start with a Feebas in hopes of a Milotic, only to give up on the poor fish before ever training it. As for Barboach, they just aren’t popular and they wash up in the mud a lot. If Dean could find some way to hug these fish, he’d do it.
, Cas isn’t really a man, has no idea of societal norms. Or fuck, he’s been on Earth long enough, maybe he intentionally gave them the finger. Dean can’t really be bothered to ask right now, he just wasn’t expecting it to be so hot. One finger traces up, almost of its own accord, to play with the elastic clinging tight to Cas’ thighs. He slips it inside, just a little. The fabric’s so fucking tight when it rubs against the back of his finger, cock straining the panties out already. “You got some extra pairs of these?”
Tessa, Jody, Benny, they all hug him hard enough that Dean’s gotta catch his breath. Claire actually shrieks
When Dean opens his mouth, Castiel is somewhat expecting it. He’s observed humanity for thousands of years, after all, and he could access Jimmy’s memories. He does not even mind the tang of beer still clinging to the inside of Dean’s cheeks. But when Dean’s tongue slicks against his own, he gasps and
“Please, Dean,” Cas begs, his voice still thick with hunger. One hand’s splayed out on the upholstery so he can hoist himself up as best he can, eyes right between his legs, but the other uselessly twists trying to grab something to hold on to. (How Dean hasn’t come yet is one of the mysteries of the universe, and he’s pretty fucking well-acquainted with some of those.)
through, I’m not innocent either. It was either take it all too seriously and go nuts, or take nothing seriously at all and get the fuck away before it could all
The field’s still plunged into chaos. All the embraces, the happy reunions, aside, there are still too many people there. Most of the mooks that weren’t already manhandled into captivity attempt one last escape, but with their outfits they’re too obvious. The majority of their Pokemon already turned on them once the Swords of Justice showed up, refusing to obey orders and fleeing from battle, but now they’re the ones rounding them up and pinning them in place.
Cas is sitting at a nearby table, engrossed in a book. Dean absolutely does not feel a new hot jolt move through him just
he’d known sex. Even a few skilled jerks of Dean Winchester’s fingers against him could get him going stupid and mindless, as it turns out; Castiel does not use words like
There’s a roar from right beneath him, and Dean looks down to see his captor. It’s a Snorlax, but not a Snorlax like any Dean’s seen. They’re docile and
He’s on his feet before he knows it. The angles on the face in front of him are stark as they ever were, but they’re softened by the tilt of his smile. It ain’t a big smile, because Cas’ never were – never
There’s no rush this time, no charge toward an inevitable finish line — though oh yeah, Dean knows that’s coming too — but that doesn’t leech the passion from it, or the heat. He keeps one leg curled around Cas’ hip and thigh, two fingers sunk right into the waistband of his underwear. There’s nothing too
“I know you’re not gonna… accept anything I’m saying,” Sam tells Dean at last. Dean’s not sure how long he’s been sitting there, eyes still shut to seal him off from the rest of the world; he only knows that it wasn’t close enough to sleep, or oblivion. “But if you ever want to, or don’t even wanna accept it, just talk about it, I’m here.”
“I – thanks, Cas.” His voice is rough and sleepy, but Dean really should kiss him. He’s sure, in that moment, that he’ll never get another chance. What he ends up blurting out, though, because he’s the paradigm of fuck-ups, is, “I think we could do with some dinner now, yeah?” It’s practically a nervous tick, but he could smack himself out of frustration.
Dean wrinkles his nose. “And you call me gross,” he whines. They’re both laughing now, though, and Dean thinks that if he wanted to, he could leave this conversation right here. “Look, I don’t know. It’s complicated. You could put that down on your little Facebook page, right?”
Dean manages to pull his hand away, only to pat Hydreigon’s side and bend down enough so that his cheek is on her hide. He can feel her breathing. This is probably the most affection she’s ever gotten, considering Lucas is her trainer. “It’s going to be okay,” Dean says.
A bunch of little Cubone are crouched around him, staring up adoringly. If the visitors had any doubts, that usually convinces them.
start. It’s better than anything else they have. Dean leaves the basement room only ten minutes later; muttering sharply to himself, he ignores Sam to storm back upstairs.
Kali, trailed by her Rapidash, stands up over Gabriel and works her fingers into Gabe’s short hair. It’s still a mess, but Dean figures it wouldn’t be very true to character if Gabriel suddenly showed up looking immaculate. “Sweetheart, they’re supposed to be the ones roasting
“Whoah,” Dean gasps, stumbling back. And fuck, Cas’ lips have gone a little red and puffy to go along with his hair, which is little more than a messy brown mass at this point, and it’s a good,
Now, he sees none of it. He sees the tumbled assortment of cups inside one of Bobby’s cabinets, glinting dimly in the darkness with cut-up light – the moon, fading streetlights – from outside leaking in, because he’s staring at that. Grunting, he selects the two largest cups he can see, and fills them eagerly from the sink.
Dean knows he can’t handle Hell again, he knows it. Yet here he stands, throwing himself into the Pit for another go.
The first time Alastair attacked him, he got his goons to do the dirty work. Dean still remembers the panic that rose through his gut and throat when he found himself pinned to the ground by an Illumise’s psychic attack, how his system thrashed at him when his body physically couldn’t. That attack was so much weaker than anything a fully powered-up Mewtwo could offer.
She stuck with him. She saw him at his worst, time and time again, and leaving wasn’t even a question. Pokemon were bred throughout generations to be loyal, but they weren’t stupid either, and survival instincts always won out. There were plenty of stories of Pokemon bolting from terrible trainers and awful situations. That never once happened with her.
They’ve had better Wal-Mart runs, but they managed to pick up some spare clothes and frozen veggies, so it’s not a total loss. Sam is animatedly telling him about how Claire and Sarah helped him take out a whole mess of Leviathan when they were out looking for some weird herb to help get Dean out of Purgatory, when Dean’s gaze happens, by accident, to slide over to one of the freaking zombies propping itself up against the door.
Dean opens his mouth to tell him as much, but he falls silent. After all the shit they’ve been through, Dean all but raising Sam and going to Hell for him, through one extremely imminent end of the world into another — it’s not about Dean being gay. Who’d care at this point? Like, okay, at first Dean was a little freaked that he woke up remembering the way the dude-shaped laser beam of doom loomed over him and it gave him a hell of a boner, but that was years ago. He wouldn’t give a shit if Sam was gay, or in a relationship with a dude, or whatever, as long as he was happy.
“Dean,” Cas says, but he’s biting back a laugh. “He wanted to say – yes. Sometimes it is that easy. But think about what got you that key. Was it easy, after all?”
, or anything, but compared to the other shit they’re dealing with is pretty small fries. The ugly-ass thing looks like the chick from
“Guess you’re not in on all the news, old man,” Alicia jumps in. “We’re relocating. The hunting on the road thing – it was a blast for a while, but well –”
Sam purses his lips, but his eyes actually fucking twinkle. He’s obviously trying very, very hard not to grin very, very wildly, and mostly failing. Dean’s expecting a smug-ass
They crowd back into the car and open up all the food bags. Half of them stink to high hell, and Dean starts tossing the rancid crap out the windows despite Sam whining at him when he does it. There’s a Hershey’s bar buried in Inais’ backpack, and yeah, Dean’s eyes totally light up when he looks at it.
Dean looks backward now, just to see the look on Castiel’s face. “Better in your cabin,” he agrees. His smiles are still all wonky and they’re never gonna be not weird, but God they’re like that first ray of orange sunlight spilling across the morning sky at the same time.
dragging his feet the whole time. “Wouldn’t let you have a gun, either,” he says to Castiel, elbowing him in the ribs a bit.
Still gobbling down the plate of appetizers – he’s preparing to preemptively apologize to Cas for not leaving any food for him, though there’s practically mountains of it around – Dean moves away from the noise, to a smaller table in the reception hall. The majority of the chairs there are empty, turned this way and that, but three people remain at the table. Two of them are Gordon and Kubrick, and they’re actually holding hands. How about that.
It is odd to see Dean’s back nearly folded as he explores Castiel’s chest, slow and near-careful. Castiel has seen him perform sexual acts with women and men alike, and knows he likes it like this, almost measured. And he knows it hasn’t been like this with the men at all, only sticky fumbling in bar bathrooms that left bite marks on Dean’s neck – but Castiel is the first man, and it’s odd to think of himself as that but he is now, to make Dean’s lips go puffy and messy from kissing.
With no preamble, Cas says, “Dean, I remember you now,” and there it is. Dean doesn’t have to ask what the hell he means. Back then, it was night, and Dean’s heart couldn’t stop thudding at the danger of it all, and the wind kept whipping Cas’ coat around until he looked like some kind of goddamn superhero. Which to Dean, he kind of was.
“Nice try,” one of the angels scoffs back at her. He’s wearing the body of a man ten or fifteen years younger than her boys. His face is almost soft, with blond hair and wide eyes to match.
Dean hopes they return to Goldenrod one day. He hopes to see Carver, maybe the best college in the world, some time when he’s not so swallowed up by bitterness. And when it’s a place that the students on there can walk around freely and flash him big toothy smiles for good reason, not because they don’t know what the fuck is going on.
“I can’t — I don’t open up easy for anyone, Sam, you know that. Cas is already as far as you’re gonna get with me. This ain’t just friendship, anyone can see that —” Dean’s not
Cas holds up his hand, then rotates it a bit. The bafflement in Terrakion’s eyes fades away, and she snorts, short and emphatic. “You’re very welcome,” Cas says.
“We’ll find them,” Cas says. Dean knows Cas is just as aware as he is of Mt. Coronet’s size, but he sounds determined, at least. “Thank you, Naomi.” Might as well be saying
– Dean’s sorry he dropped his hand so he can’t squeeze Cas’ again. “And when I ended up on the other side of the rift, in a destroyed land where I knew no one, it was a comfort to see Bobby Singer there, even if he wasn’t the Bobby I knew. So – I do understand.”
On the way out that night, Dean catches Cas, who of course volunteered to stay late already, in one of the Cubone enclosures. “You’ve had a long day, I know,” Cas is saying to the Cubone, completely serious, like they’re his coworkers too. It’s completely ridiculous.
. Two chicks, sure, but being with a weirdo angel with very little sense for human norms in any way made for a great way to kill his inhibitions and dive right into the kinky shit that never left his brain, as it turns out.
Cas always comes back, though, a flurry of invisible wings with a hard expression etched into his face. Dean doesn’t say anything about it, but he lets himself smile for a few seconds.
When Dean does leave the ranch, it’s with Cas and their Pokemon only. They wander through a small wood on the property, a path cut clearly through the trees. They walk through together, not saying a word, hands intertwined. A Croagunk hops right across their path on the way to a pond, and Cas lets out a chuff of laughter, but that’s it. It’s comfortable, even if they’re both quiet. Just wouldn’t seem right to keep talking at the moment.
Dean turns around and clenches his fists. He lets himself breathe until enough of the fury’s ebbed out of his body. Castiel’s still wearing the same perfectly placid expression on his face once Dean can face him again. “Yeah,” Dean says.
Those lips find his nipple and Castiel is arching up, like it’ll get him closer and this feeling will ramp up. He can’t help the ragged noise that comes out of his mouth, and it would frighten him if he wasn’t so distracted by pure sensation, nestling its way into every vein and blood vessel.
“Now you have someone who sticks with you, even if it’s not who you wanted it to be,” Castiel says. “Is that why you haven’t driven an angel blade through my heart?”
They leave Old Navy without bothering to pay for anything — there are no cashiers, anyway, and sure, a couple of the kids in the store have name tags but fuck no, they’re not bothering to deal with that — Dean dragging like three bags of Castiel’s new clothes, and a bunch of other stuff for people at the camp. He’s pretty sure he got the bag with all the shoes, and it’s hard to hoist them all up even in the short walk back to the Impala. It’s the least he can do not to bitch about it.
him move because they’re so close, every minute movement of Cas’ echoed against Dean’s side, and that sends a zip right up his spine. “What are you talking about?” Cas asks. There’s no defensiveness in his voice, no hostility at all. It’s a legitimate question.
“Sorry,” Dean sputters, and he’s pretty sure that’s the exact wrong thing to say to a dude when he just came because he got off so hard on getting
With those words, Dean comes, but that’s not the right word for it. Not at all. Whatever Cas is doing to him, it’s like a missile determined to seek every shred of goodness from his shitty little life, and pull it to the surface. It’s watching fireworks with Sammy and the thrill of a hunt gone really right and pie fresh out of the oven and the few times he acknowledges he helped save the fucking
“It is,” Charlie says, fitting her hand over Dean’s and smiling. Her smile is close-mouthed, not the big friendly greeting it was before, but still genuine. “Don’t let our grouching discourage you. This place is amazing.”
“My brave little runaway,” she says, though there’s not a trace of sentimentality in her voice. It’s simply fact.
“I’m aware,” Cas says, in a tone that’s just bitter enough that Dean finally looks up. His pulse digs a corkscrew into his neck.
“You know Anna? Cas’ sister, picked him up at work sometimes? Tall, red hair, got his eyes?” Delta nods, curtly. “Go find her. We’ll talk about what the hell’s gonna happen if we all get out of this once we’re back to Opelucid. And Delta?”
Sam can’t help but laugh at that. He gives them both enormous hugs before they go their separate ways. Sometimes it’s good to get a reminder that the Winchester brand of crazy and tragedy isn’t the only brand of crazy and tragedy out there.
“Nice wedding duds,” Dean tells Charlie, nodding his head in the direction of one of her friends walking by. She’s a blonde with pin-thin hair who’s been constantly gushing to Kali all night, when she’s not eyeing Sam like she could devour him alongside the fifteen-tier wedding cake. What really sets her apart, though, are the enormous cotton puffs attached to her brown slip of a dress. She capped her ears with swirly green covers, too; she’s clearly cosplaying as Whimsicott.
want to feel him inside. He wants, he wants, he wants, so much the sheer joy and seeming decadence could push him right into an orgasm all on its own.
Dean peeks down the alley to the left, just in case. And then he does a double-take. There’s a Pokemon standing in the alley.
She’s not carrying a protest sign and she isn’t trying to talk to anyone. Her only company is her Noibat, who is incredibly tiny and fluttering hard, but utterly glaring at the bus. Goddamn if it’s not effective.
“Good rule of thumb: don’t surprise a hunter like that,” Dean tells him, once his breathing’s returned to normal. His heart rate never really slows down around the kid. “And thanks.”
It might have been the last time Dean hunted so ferociously, but this isn’t the Mark of Cain all over again. Dean relished hunting when he had the Mark, drank down sheer joy when taking out a nest of baddies. The heartbreak that’s wormed its way into Dean now, though, it’s left him empty.
Sam lets him go on more and more missions and Dean teases him about it, about how he’s taking the locks on the shackles off one by one. For his part, Sam just whacks him on the shoulder, laughs, and tells him to keep walking.
“Why do you even talk to me?” Castiel asks. Dean’s taken aback by the irritation in his voice. “You clearly don’t like me at all.”
Dean looks over, alarm painting his features. “What do you mean, Cas?” Maybe he wants to tear this whole damn thing between them down, walk away. Dean wouldn’t blame him.
He makes it halfway to Sam’s cabin when it turns — less good. “Good night?” Meg asks, all bony shoulders as she bumps into him. Frankly, she’s the most gleeful Dean has ever seen her, and that includes when she ambushed them with Lucifer in Carthage and she practically did a friggin’ tap-dance down the street as she let a pack of hellhounds after him. “And day.”
“Peace or freedom.” Of course he does. Not real easy to forget, even as the entire world went heavy with this haze of hurt and guilt and rage all around him. “Think we both took freedom, and it’s a real son of a bitch.”
“Yeah, that’s us,” Dean says, at last, and he’s actually smiling. They’re just gonna hold hands and sail off this cliff together, because it’s what they’ve been doing for a while now.
Most of them do; they giggle while they do it, but Vaporeon leans into their touch and coos. A couple of the braver kids go back over to the pond afterward, brushing their hands against the Barboach’s skin.
He knows he’s already flushed practically neon pink, and remembering the fact that Woobat are naturally drawn to where they can sense affection and more specifically attraction isn’t exactly helping. “A little help,” Dean gasps. He tells himself the noise he made was
Cas almost smiles. “Yes. I’m somewhat familiar with the concept.” He’s dry as Groudon’s land, so it takes Dean way too long to realize he’s joking. A joke. From Cas. It might be less weird if he actually grew feathers out of his ass. Probably wouldn’t leave Dean smiling as wide, though. “I do karaoke sometimes, too.”
, there’s a waiting list for volunteers, and an excess of cash flow. They’re putting as much of it as they can to making the lives of the Pokemon better.
than something he learned sitting in those cramped lecture chairs at school, when he actually attended.
“I created you from nothing,” Cas says, eventually. Sleep hazes over his voice. “Just your soul and stardust. It was the most incredible experience of my entire existence to that point.”
But he takes a peek anyway, because why the hell not. When the voice of God tells you to do something, well, okay he’s one stubborn son of a bitch but it’s probably smart to do so. Even if he’s not expecting to see much other than a tablet in a whole lot of script he can’t understand, and he’s gonna have to ask Cas to translate this for both of them.
is settling into his bones and through his blood, when Dean’s lips – they don’t even brush his own, it’s more like a suggestion.
Castiel remembers the tattoo over his chest, part of the reason they’re here, and lets his curiosity take over to lick Dean’s matching one. It tastes like his skin, a hint of salt and adrenaline beneath the surface. His tongue pokes at it, out of curiosity, and Dean laughs even if it sounds broken.
They make a point to talk at least every other day. It’s surprisingly easy, a muscle memory. When Dean calls Sam on Skype and sees Amy asleep in Sam’s bed, the sheets pulled up high enough that he can’t see if she’s wearing any clothing or not, it’s instinct to crow at him over it. “Don’t you know that three feet have to be on the ground at all times, Sam!” he cackles.
“What are we going to do now?” Cas asks Anna. The three of them found tree stumps, where they wait for the last of the police cars to come pick them up. “Our privacy is gone. Everyone knows.”
The “big gun” is, of course, a sunny redhead tailed by a Vulpix. “Charlie Bradbury-Peri at your service,” she announces, walking in and dumping her bag down with a heavy thud. Vulpix gallops right toward Cas, taking a running leap into his lap. “Hacker extraordinaire. Here for the
The path to the nursery is quiet and dark. Dean should take the time to appreciate how pretty the campus is here at Edlund, now that the protesters have apparently broken up for the night, but his heart is thumping away in his chest too fast for him to linger too long in any one place.
The warehouse is out of costumes in Vaporeon’s size, so Charlie ends up buying him body paint that she swears is safe for Pokemon and human alike. “And waterproof to boot!” she said at check-out, back to her usual perky self. The paint is bright yellow, because Vaporeon had totally smirked at Dean in his neon jumpsuit. Probably would have been cackling, if she could.
Daphne had offered to teach him how to drive, but he never got any farther than three blocks from their house until the inside of the car – well, somehow it bore down on him, until he felt like the roof would cave in unless he pressed the gas pedal harder and harder. Thankfully, Daphne never made him explain much, just smiled as she drove them back home.
They walk together after dinner. Dean realizes, eventually, that Cas is following him. To his room. His stomach feels like it’s doing the samba, but it’s – it’s not nerves. It’s actually excitement.
Bela leaves the courthouse not long after that, walking more efficiently in her absurd heels than the rest of the group manages in flat shoes. Dean stares after her.
“Don’t sell the others short,” Anna butts in, friendly. “Ombrinag helped out.” She jerks a thumb in the direction of a whip-thin woman with jet black hair, who grins up at them. With pointy teeth.
Their footsteps are deafeningly loud in the forest as they walk together. There’s no map after all. It’s just the two of them, the faith they lost a long time ago that things would turn out okay in the end, and Purgatory pressing in thick and endless.
Dean can’t look Cas in the face the next day – “lookin’ pretty florid, Winchester!” as Charlie puts it, oh-so-cheerfully and definitely in Cas’ hearing range – but after that, he finds himself almost compelled to look at him. He’s a weird guy, but in a way that’s stupidly endearing, and Dean rolls his eyes when he thinks that, because he might as well be writing
Anna looks a little sheepish when she meets them, which isn’t much of an Anna expression. Her Pidgeot’s circling around her, and she’s got a burlap bag slung over her shoulder. Dean can guess where this conversation’s gonna go, but he’ll hear it out anyway. “Look, I know it’s not the best time. But I’m thinking about an extended vacation.”
“I said once that human sexual activity was tedious,” Cas states, and Dean actually completely remembers that moment because he’d been real affronted at the time, for reasons he didn’t wanna pinpoint. “I hadn’t… experienced it.” His fingers trace Dean’s face, and all of their skin is still flushed. “It is not.”
Slowly, as if the energy itself knows enough to be careful, the static electricity withdraws. The temperature returns to normal. With a loud wet smack that truly does not help Dean’s pants situation, Cas pulls away from Castiel.
“I can take the couch,” Cas offers. It doesn’t make Dean feel any better, surprisingly. Fuckin’ agony, the idea of spending a night sleeping in the same space as Cas, hearing him breathing through the night, having him only a couple of footsteps away, but not
Cas pushes the blanket down a little, until his eyes are visible. The levity’s gone from them, but it’s nothing bad; he just looks serious now. “I know that’s a big step, Dean.” Under the blanket, one of Cas’ hands reaches out and touches Dean’s wrist. “Of course you can tell them. But if you don’t want to yet, that’s alright too.”
into dudes, I’d say I see what my brother sees in you. Other than the considerable looks. Objectively speaking –”
“Eee,” Vaporeon offers, but it’s low-pitched. She’s slowed down her march toward the water. Obviously, she’s not a Psychic type, but she’s good at sensing Dean’s mood after all this time. When Espeon’s around, Dean gets twin sets of beady Pokemon eyes trained on him, and he’s only just getting used to it.
“That is correct,” comes a low growl. Smiling hurts, but goddamn if one doesn’t spread over his face right as Cas comes into view. Dean reaches for his hand and grips it tight, probably too tight, but it’s just what he needs right now. Cas is solid and real and
Emmanuel can’t explain, then, why this is the best he’s ever felt in a car. Yes, his legs still feel cramped, and something about long car rides presses heavy on his back – it shouldn’t make sense, his back touches nothing but the seat, but if he is in a car for very long his shoulders and spine ache – but Dean is good company. He shouldn’t be. He’s so hardened, and he didn’t deny Emmanuel’s observation that he kills people.
“When we were shopping, you told me to get underwear,” Cas grumbles, as much as he can when his voice is sunk even lower and more growly than usual. Dean lets his brain flash through fun memories like the way it feels to get shot in order to not come right there. “I bought underwear.”
“Okay.” She laughs, and it’s sorta shaky, like she can’t quite trust him yet. “I’m Marin.” When she holds out her hand, Cas just stares at it, and she pulls it away. “You must be Dean. Heard a lot about you.” Her smile’s wobbly, but she’s cute.
“I knew it would be.” Cas’ response is even, and he keeps looking forward across the water. There’s a smile bubbling up, though, Dean can tell from so much time with the guy. He leans over to kiss him, knocking his ridiculously huge sunglasses off-kilter. Judging by Cas’ enthusiasm in return, he doesn’t mind his sunglasses getting jostled.
“I only let you be a smart-aleck because you’re right.” With that, Dean rolls over – his body makes all kinds of ridiculous protests at that, God, he’s gettin’ old, but ain’t too bad because he never thought he’d live this long – and pulls on his discarded boxers and a fresh t-shirt. He dumped his jeans off the side of the bed before he fell asleep, but they’re still good too. “Next time we’re getting’ the wild cherry lube.”
. I shouldn’t have come back from that, and I don’t know what I did to deserve that, or any of this –”
Claire is still standing there on the road. She’s so blonde and pale she was nearly washed out, in comparison to this girl and her dark skin and flinty eyes, but they’ve both placed themselves firmly in this moment. He shouldn’t be underestimating any of these kids.
But instead, a distinctly non-Joy woman enters the room. She’s short, with sandy hair in a spiky pixie cut, wearing a yellow onesie with her hands jabbed deep in the pockets. A puff of a Whimsicott follows her.
They both were a riot of color, brighter than anything Castiel or any angel had seen in hundreds of years; they were beautiful, even if Castiel was loathe to admit it.
. Plus, I don’t think Cas would exactly appreciate it. He’d just be all broody about it, though. You ever see Anna when she’s mad?
on this campus around – isn’t very far of a walk. Dean’s pretty thankful. Carver might be one of the best universities in the entire Pokemon world, but nothing about this place, with its goddamn flower paintings and cheery students, gives him a good feeling. The dorm looks cozy and comfortable, a place that could be a home for Sam. The first real home he’s known since he was six years old.
“Cas didn’t care. He told me I didn’t belong there and pulled me out. I screamed all the way back up to Earth. I tried to tear him apart. But I held on, God knows I held on. I only remember flashes, but I remember that much. He never really brought it up again back here, but he didn’t judge me for it. He knew who I was, he knew what I’d done. He still stuck around. Kept coming back, even though I should have – well, I told you about that already.”
But hating malls is something dad would probably approve of, even if he’s the one who dragged them here, so Dean says it anyway. Even as he’s gazing into the electronics stores and wondering how all the Rotoms and Magnetons in there affect the equipment. Even if he kinda secretly has expensive suit lust and tries to steal glances into the fancy department stores, the kind of places that have special waiting areas for Pokemon so they don’t shed on the clothing. Even if the food court looks
They had, it’s true. Lucas Christopher had pushed very hard to lower the minimum age for owning Pokemon to somewhere around the age
in loopy script across the front. Above all, though, she’s wearing a big grin. She gives him a firm, enthusiastic handshake, but Dean can just
Dean’s got no idea where Mewtwo’s going. Even with Cas’ freaky powers, he’s probably got no idea either. But God, it
Dean smiles, and he senses the way it crinkles the skin at the edges of his eyes. “Get in me, then,” he practically whispers, propping himself up best as he can to kiss Cas long and wet.
If the wedding was ridiculous, the hotel is exponentially so. Dean’s not sure that if he pooled everything he owns in the world together, it’d be worth the price of just a couple of nights at this place. There’s a pool in the courtyard that stretches long enough that Dean’s pretty certain it could count as a major body of water, and he keeps having to fish Vaporeon out so he doesn’t end up with an awful sunburn from staying outside for too long. The entire place is flawless cream marble, the floors speckled with gold and sea green, and the views take Dean’s breath away. Begrudingly, he’ll also admit that the bed here is far more comfortable than his or Cas’ back in Opelucid; it’s practically a cloud.
Dean realized that it wasn’t the happiness that he saw in Cas’ smile that freaked him out. The hope and the utter faith there did him in, forced him to avert his eyes.
That end never comes. It’s just him in the clearing, surrounded by these dark woods and those crimson eyes in the distance that move too quickly. He can’t focus on the shapes attached to the red pinpricks of light, but honestly, that’s probably a good thing.
“Wouldn’t have thought you’d be BFF with angels,” he says one day, while they’re sitting at one of the picnic tables at the camp. Claire’s all excited about her salad; Dean’s, well, less so. He’ll break out of this place himself to go get some friggin’
Looking at Dean was pleasing, especially for someone as prideful as Castiel. The human body had been a tricky study, especially with little practical experience. Castiel had done well enough in recreating it. That kind of power seems impossible to him now; he tries to remember it, and his brain only provides him with an image of worn textbooks. He thinks of Heaven, and all he can see are the vessels of his brothers.
“You comfortable?” he asks, laughing. Her only response is rolling further across his lap. She’s a hoot.
And so, Dean can smile back at him. It’s no relief to the tension; it only heats it up to a rattling heating valve. “That sucks, Cas. I would’ve taken care of them.”
Whenever Dean thinks about relationships, lets his mind roll over the word, he wants to run. Bolt away, really. Not because he doesn’t want it, even if he’s sure most people assume he only wants to mess around, and he’s fine doing nothing to dissuade that assumption. It’s because he wants it too damn much.
Dean knows he should probably move along; there are so many other Pokemon enclosures to check, and it’s getting late. But they stay staring at the tableau in front of them, Vaporeon’s paws curled carefully in something like an embrace and Staraptor wrapped around her best she can.
The newscaster looks out at the audience pleadingly from a small square, inserted into the footage of the brawl. “If you have any information about Claire Novak or Tracy Bell, please call us here at –” Dean tunes out the number, and looks away from the TV screen so he doesn’t have to see the pictures the news station put up of Claire and Tracy, where the two of them are smiling beatifically. That ain’t them.
“Don’t think our darling Zach was counting on us all liking Naomi a lot more than him, though,” Anna says, looking up now and smirking a bit. “I moved out before college ever started. I still do a lot of work for her, when she asks. I owe her that much. That’s what happens when someone makes you feel like a human being for the first time in your life.”
“Cas wanted freedom,” Dean gets out, at last. “We saw one of your guys, one of his brothers, Thaddeus, attack that Tracy girl right there, and he felt bad for not only her, but him too, because he got how Thaddeus grew up. He just didn’t want anyone to hurt any more.”
Still, Dean cups his hands and drinks deeply. He doesn’t need the water here, but it’s still sweet and cold in his mouth, and it only occurs to him to be embarrassed by the frankly gross slurping noises he makes when he feels Cas practically hovering over him.
“Cas wasn’t kidding around with the training,” Ennis says. His Scizor has moved away from Hydreigon a bit. She’s got a funny look on her face, gazing at Staraptor. There’s something like awe there.
He doesn’t even recognize what it is, or rather was, until he catches a glimpse of the markings carved into what’s left of the shaft, and sees the silver tip next to Dean on the blanket. Michael’s Lance. Dean’s destroying it.
“Great.” Jody cracks open the fridge and starts rooting around for something to eat. Dean notices she doesn’t even try to come in between the two of them and the eggs and bacon. He’s oddly touched, warmed by something that has nothing to do with his closeness to Cas, but also a little embarrassed at how obvious they probably are. “I got an early start this morning, as you can see. So did he, believe it or not.” Grotle’s snoozing in a corner of the kitchen, his snoring sounds lifting and falling away. “You can get out of here when you’re done eating, if you want.”
Dean glares and pushes on. “The second Cas found me in Hell, I turned his life to shit. He cared about Sam too, Mom and all our friends, but everything terrible that happened to him, that was all on me. He gave up
“These were never anything you have to worry about, Dean. They’re just creatures my Father created that weren’t fit for any other world,” Cas sighs, and if his palm presses warmly on the small of his back, well, Dean can forget about the fact that he’s pretty sure one of the freaky little fuckers just brushed up against his ankle.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says in return, tone serious. Dean could find it off-putting, but he doesn’t, not with the sweet heat that rises between them. Staraptor flutters onto Cas’ shoulder, jostling a couple of other passengers. She doesn’t seem to care much.
It’s regret and pain the guy struggles with, the shit angels were never supposed to feel. Doubt closes in on him, tight and painful like its own ring of holy fire. Loss was to be expected, sure, Cas was a soldier on a battlefield, but those losses weren’t supposed to crawl into your bones and halt you the next time around.
It wasn’t gonna take much, Dean knows that, and he’s kind of impressed he lasts as long as he did watching Cas gaze up at him, all blue and wide and heated at the same time. That’s when Dean realizes it’s probably not the porn Cas was watching that was so hot and good, it was just Cas, and his foot slips in the sweat pooled between Cas’ shoulders — he’s hot and sweaty just like a human, in a way he’s so not outside this bed. Only Dean gets this, and it’s weird but exhilarating.
The joke’s terrible, he’s fully aware. Still, Rufus positively guffaws at it, which is predictable but welcome. Bobby’s not the guffawing type, but a genuine smile works its way across his mouth and into his eyes.
Eventually, they both pull away. Cas’ chest rises and falls, heavy, which is awfully fucking gratifying. “I could have us naked and fully prepared with a thought,” he says right into Dean’s ear.
Cas looks the same as he always does, majorly disheveled but also kind of pulling the look off. He’s oblivious enough that his messy hair and off-kilter trenchcoat isn’t
“Alakazam, stop bothering them,” a woman’s voice chastises. She’s tall, with honey-colored hair and skin, a pretty filament moon-shaped pendant around her neck. “I’m sorry about that. You are…?”
Still, when he pushes open the door, his shoulders are absolutely wracked. He always held tension there.
Charlie’s nearly ever-present smile goes a tick wider. “You know you don’t even need to ask that question, right?”
weird when Cas starts tracing those lines all over his face – skims over his nose, his cheeks, his forehead, doesn’t even stop to ask him to close his eyes before he goes over his eyelids too – but Dean can’t stop thinking
They could stay up all night with Dean naming the bad things he has done, and Castiel attempting to top them with the good, and they would be no further in their conversation than when they began.
A few people mill around the camp, but it’s pretty late and most of them are probably trying to catch up on any sort of precious goddamn sleep. Dean’s here instead, not answering with anything but a shrug. Because ouch, but also true. “Dean, after Stull, do you remember —”
about liking that crap, and God knows they needed some levity. But then Sam had leveled him with a look, pointed his finger in Dean’s direction, and said, “You still know who he
in their conversations every now and then. They wonder how he survived such an extensive wound. These conversations increased in number when Bobby sent over all that money to pay for his treatment and pain medication alike.
Dean’s eyes trace the path of Castiel’s hand, and he jolts when the palm settles against him. He lets himself push into the hand, nuzzle it, just for a second, before he pulls back. “Cas, you just can’t,” he – he is pleading, a worn-out neediness. He drops his hand, like what he’s going to say is so important – as if Castiel would not pay attention to anything he ever said – there must be no distractions. “You get it, right?”
“You still see me in the form of my vessel because you are used to it. The other things here do not see me as… such.”
The ecstatic look on Sam’s face darkens. Fuck. It’s never that easy. “It’s been maybe two and a half years? It’s December 2014, and we’re all holed up in this place called Camp Chitaqua —”
He looks down, because fuck, he’s gotta see it. The light’s dim in the room and it’s dark between their bodies, but he can still see the fat head of his cock emerging from and retreating into the easy warm cup of Cas’ hand. He’s getting those gorgeous fingers slick and messy with every pass, and it just makes Dean more desperate.
at the angel, his hair still mussed up into spikes and wearing Dean’s one pair of long pajama pants.
But they don’t let themselves go to bed mad. They had enough of that as kids, Dean angry at the whole damn world but mostly just his dad, and Cas furious with Zachariah and the strange hollowness inside him. And, most importantly, even through all the craters, every hard moment, Dean remembers Cas’ words.
Latios skims through the air. There’s no serious, determined bent to his brow, like there was when he was Cas. He glides by on autopilot. It’s easy and smooth and beautiful to see and it makes Dean want to fucking hurl. At that moment, Dick Roman chooses to call Cas back to his Poke Ball – just thinking it rattles Dean even more – and vanish with the rest of Lucas’ followers. He doesn’t know where they’re going, but it can’t be anywhere good.
“You’re the one who got the reference,” Chuck points out, and even now that he’s an angel — or remembers that he’s an angel, whatever — he’s still got that smirk.
must have noticed just how cut off we are from every other region,” she snaps. There’s a sharp look to all her features, and the wind blows her hair enough so it puffs out like a mane.
Cas holds out the tape to Dean. It’s nearly identical in appearance to the tape Dean gave him, now safely held in the tape deck of his truck, only the front of this tape reads
Somehow, Sam finds himself smiling. “You give pretty good advice,” he says. “Maybe psych’s more for you, and law never was.”
Well, Castiel reacts to that one. The color drains from his face, and though he manages to fix his expression back into its usual inscrutable mask, shock remains in his eyes. “You went to Hell?”
Cas offers up a half-ass attempt at a snort. “I’m not sure I would be welcome there, considering the alphas that were present.”
“Torch it?” Dean asks, nodding his head toward the cabin, once they’re standing on the grass again. Long droplets of sweat trickle down his face and slink under the collar of his shirt. He pulls off his ruined jacket and chucks it onto the remains of the broken door, into the ghouls’ resting place.
“I knooooow.” If this was Dean talking to Charlie in the same tone, she’d tease the hell out of him over his
to do. He just needs to figure out what the fuck that could possibly be. Wanting’s an all but foreign emotion to him.
“Told you to stay out of my friggin’ head,” Dean half-snarls, because the way Alastair turned that snake grin first to his brother, then to his mom, then to him is still boiling hot inside him. Cas can’t see that and hope to understand.
Really, though, as dad keeps saying, all they’re there for is to grab some new clothes in the cheapest place they can find. Hidden away in the corner of the mall, like whoever designed Shopping Mall Nine is ashamed of it, is the generic warehouse. That’s where they stock up on bland plaids and jeans that come off the rack looking dusty, fabric going thin at the knees.
Figures, Dean thinks. It’s kinda fucked up, but glorious too, that he got thrown into Purgatory and came back out to Camp Chitaqua, only to find himself the happiest he’s been in years. He’s had better times with Sammy and Cas than he’s had in too long, even with death and duty and the fucked-up corn syrup zombies as the Leviathans’ parting gift hanging over his head. He’s got
“No,” Dean says, in a daze, and then shit, of course, Cas’ frown just deepens. “Uh, no, shit, I mean — it was way too good, was what it was.”
The elaborate cursive flares blue, and Castiel doubles over. With his free hand, he clutches at one ear, while blood trickles down from the other one. It blossoms red over his robes once it’s slithered down that far.
Speaking of that mouth. Dean hooks his fingers in Cas’ belt loops and tugs him closer to kiss him again. It’s messy and their tongues tangle wet and hot; Dean likes it slower but Cas is pushy, hand spearing into Dean’s hair and slipping up his chest, and Dean’d be lying if he said he didn’t kinda dig it.
There’s a darkness inside Sam, one he’s never fully snuffed out or brought to the light. The crackling power that still lives in his bones, it scares him. He’s turned away from it since the (first) apocalypse, and tried so badly to keep control.
But then Cas’ fingers stay there, two of them against Dean’s cheek, and Dean’s remembering the way those fingers felt twined around his own. Okay, maybe it’s more than that.
Dean wraps his arms around Cas’ shoulders and thrills at the warmth of his skin, touches their lips together. Every movement, every time Cas thrusts or Dean shudders against his chest, every tiny noise they both make into their kiss, reminds Dean that there’s a future they can have now. Dean is here, in Cas’ lap, and they made it. They made it.
He rushes down to the dungeon in the basement. His lungs are aflame and every thought is gone from his head. When he gets there, though, he’s not at all surprised by what he finds. Most of the chains are spread out over the floor by now, their silver glinting like a rushing river in the darkness.
It’s gorgeous to see. But these hills are hell on his legs, and he always hated hiking. “We almost there?” he asks.
Dean’s been wading through water up to his neck for so long and just now, he crawled out of the ocean onto the shore, letting every breath sear his lungs. All for a stranger.
Cas doesn’t make him wait long. He pushes inside, one long exhale moving as he does. Every time, Dean’s shocked anew by how the sensation of Cas inside him flips from the burn and the stretch to pure pleasure, the kind that fissions down his spine and makes his thighs ache.
And yeah, he remembers Sam bolting while they were in Nimbasa. John found him later that night at the ever-present carnival, chowing down on some cotton candy he stole. Dean got told to stay in the hotel room that night, so he never knew what John said to Sam, but it was only a couple of months later that Dean found the application to Carver University over in Goldenrod. Dean had done a lot of stupid, stupid shit for his dad, but he was loyal to Sam, too, even if it broke Dean’s damn heart to see it, what he could never do. So he kept quiet.
because they are under fifty. There just isn’t some easy word for a tornado that knocks you the fuck over and buoys you up at the same time. “Cas. This is Cas. My Cas.”
An amalgamation of cars stalls in front of them, stilled to one multi-colored mass. They’re being held up further on ahead by students. Tons and tons of students, all of them milling about in the streets with their Pokemon. There must be a couple hundred of them, brandishing signs Dean can’t read.
Sam and Amy apparently really distinguished themselves during the battle – Amy tells them, breathlessly, about Alakazam smacking Lucas-as-Giratina in the face with his
lecture a while ago, he’s kind of over it. If Dean’s being honest with himself, he and Cas haven’t ever been the definition of normal.
That settled it, because the man who tried to kidnap him, or worse, outside Shopping Mall Nine grinned back at him. He was even more angular, a couple of teeth missing, but it was definitely him.
But instead, she smiles. “I hope so. I think so,” she says, before following Dr. Chen into the room.
“I’m sorry, Cas,” Sam murmurs at – like, seriously, it’s gotta be like one AM when he hands the coat, still in tatters, back to Castiel. His mouth exaggerates into a frown, again.
Cas moves his fingers, until he’s cradling Dean’s cheek. Dean huffs again, but it’s in gratitude, and he lets himself rest against Cas’ palm. He didn’t know how much he wanted exactly this, his face held like it’s something worthy, something
Jody and Claire, right?” Her smile fades a little, that same sad look in her eyes. “The vamp thing – I have history. And I don’t wanna talk about it right now. But maybe some day. And then… I love Jody, Claire’s my sister, but I want to get out of this life.” She brightens up by a couple of degrees. “That’s why I’m here, anyway.”
The light drains away, slowly. When Dean dares crack open one eye, they’re all – gone. Everyone’s gone. The only noise is the wind rustling the grass, the same wind that whipped up that guy’s coat, and the somewhat distant murmur from Shopping Mall Nine. Vaporeon bounces over to him, screeching her name; he’ll need to patch up her neck frill a bit, but other than that, she’s fine. Thank whoever is listening up there, if anyone is.
Sam tells him he’s going to go ask his friends about coming with them, and excuses himself from the table. By the time Dean’s stuffed full of carbs and fat, he’s surrounded by a group of college kids eager to go with him. They’ve all got different levels of enthusiasm – Ava and Ruby chatter on about
Sometimes, Sam comes back from supply runs with sweat and blood clotted on his skin, mixed with black goop.
It’s not until he totally catches Sarah’s quick smile that he realizes how that comment came across, and he mentally smacks himself across the back of his head a little bit. Doesn’t bother to correct what he said, or elaborate, though, even as he wonders what the hell Sam told Sarah about him and Castiel.
Kelly doesn’t have a clue what Jack is talking about – just how much crap are the Winchesters involved with, anyway? – but Cas’ eyes flare wide, even as he judders out a breath caught between surprise and relief.
Dean’s torn between loudly laughing, and letting his head fall to the table and never picking it up. “Why the hell not, right,” he says, with a sideways grin to Cas. “Call in the big gun.”
Does he ever. Dean would snort at that, but his terror’s frozen him. All he can do for now is stare ahead, trying to keep the look in his eyes a challenge.
“I’m for your protection, not hers,” Flagstaff adds. Garchomp shakes himself awake at Flagstaff’s words, slicing his arm fins back and forth through the air like flags on display. Not really as intimidating as it could be when he was practically taking a nap at the wall a couple of seconds earlier.
hearts and flowers and girly shit, which somehow only makes it worse. At least that’s like a warning sign. When Cas hissed things like
They’re smiling at each other, really smiling. They never got the chance to just be brothers, because everything was so damn fraught. Maybe now they can find the oddest thing of all: normalcy.
He steps back, and finds himself swallowed up by a sudden crowd. There’s gotta be twenty of them. Must’ve followed the guy here, and Dean didn’t see it for a second. If, by some miracle, he gets away from this situation, he’ll have time to be flat-out
Dean’s close, so close, his balls are fucking tightening up, when Cas twines both his hands around the back of his neck and gasps, “Fuck me, Dean, finish in me, need to feel it,” and there it is, the reedy desperation Dean’s wanted to hear this whole time.
Dean spent a night or two with plenty of other girls and guys throughout the years. He’d like to buy a drink for Rhonda Hurley even now, the chick a few years older than him who made him shimmy into her bright pink panties decorated with little Clefairies, which made him come so hard he blacked out and woke up still wearing that damned, blessed underwear. But all of it was transitory. It had to be.
