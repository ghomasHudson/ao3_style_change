Tony looked at Thor. He was giving him an encouraging smile. Tony sighed in defeat.
“I have stuff to do so I get a free pass today and If I didn’t feed you you’d just drown yourself in caffeine and candy again” Steve said with a smirk raising his own eyebrow.
“There is a door you know?” Tony said putting away the gauntlet.
Steve was stunned in place but grabbed Tony’s hands gently, “I can do it myself my clarity”. “Tony”.
It's been a looooong time since I uploaded a chapter. I've thought this one through (enough) and I'm happy with the results. Meet Tasha and Clint. More to come :D Enjoy!
Steve chuckled and got a bit more comfortable. The room was cast in a soft blue light from Tony’s reactor. Steve looked at Tony’s chest with interest.
“I could see that and yes it’s almost time, Hello Anthony” Peggy greeted him with a smile, Tony just waved.
He lowered his guard as he sighed in relief. It was just a nightmare.
“Good day Tony, by the look of your face I could see that I surprised you” Thor said smiling.
As promised I wrote Bios. It's a mix of Comic verse, Movie verse and my own AU style.
“Ah, I see, what would you like to order, the selection here is quite extraordinary but you may request your own if you happen to have certain preferences with beverage choices.” Thor said eagerly. Its apparent Thor likes his job here.
“Aren’t we moving too fast?” Tony said earning him a raised eyebrow from Steve. “Okay point taken but we haven’t been on dates and stuff” Tony said thinking.
Tony looked at him fondly. He was the reason he didn’t want to get a degree, he didn’t want to be away from Steve. Tony was a playboy in the school but he only had true feelings for one person and that was his best friend. Steve didn’t know and Tony never wants him to. There were times he wanted to tell Steve what he really felt but he’d back out. Steve was a jock and a hunk. He could get any girl without even trying but he never does.
“You’re welcome and I should, We are best friends right?” Steve said more of a fact than a question.
Tony walked the direction Steve and the others went but as he rounded the corner hall, someone pulled him to the shadows, like tentacles, the person’s arms wrapped around him, Tony was startled but it soon settled as the familiar blonde hair came into view.
For the rest of the day, Tony had gone to his classes and monitored his phone on where Steve was and made sure not to stay in one place for too long. He was thankful that his class schedule was different from Steve’s. This was drastic but Tony does like to go to extremes to avoid his problems. Throughout the day various people told him that Steve was looking for him and he just shrugged them off. Guilt was slowly building up inside him with each question.
True enough there was Tony and a whole lot of stuff that looked like party decorations.
“So cap? Would you? I can see you’re busy but it would be nice to spend some time out of this gym, don’t you think?” Tony gave him a shy smile.
With just the two of them and everything that happened earlier, there was a bit of awkwardness in the air that Tony quickly broke.
Steve’s face was a myriad of emotions, surprise, realization, embarrassment, anger and he may be wrong but he also saw pain as well.
He dropped what he was doing and went into captain mode. He kept his movements subtle but made it around the entryway when he heard a familiar voice and a familiar chain of swears. He sighed in relief as he entered their giant living room.
“This is the sky arena” Sapphire Tony said as Ruby Steve turned to look at him. “I helped come up with the plans on how to get this thing built” Tony said proudly.
It happened when Steve jolted awake from another nightmare, they had occurred occasionally happening less since he woke up from the ice he laid dormant for 75 years. He couldn’t sleep anymore so he made his way to the shared kitchen floor in the newly formed Avengers tower.
Tony pulled away slightly but didn’t fully pull away from Steve’s embrace. He missed Steve hugging him and it’s only been more than a week.
Surprises await.
“I never thought that Steve Rogers was one to eavesdrop” Tony said wrapping his own arms around Steve.
It was only after a second that they realized the position they were in, Steve had held onto Tony’s torso and the chair and Tony clung to Steve’s arm. They looked at each other, things became a little awkward as neither made a move to let go. Tony took the first move and slowly let go of Steve’s arm prompting Steve to do the same.
He’s about 5’7 in height, medium build, dark brown hair and has chocolate brown eyes. He is also sporting a mustache-beard-goatee combo, much to the disapproval of Steve. He is Steve’s best friend having grown up together and eventually Tony began developing feelings for Steve.
The dot remained stationary in front of his house until it finally passed and Tony let out a sigh of relief. He went back to his car and drove of to the opposite direction hoping to entire via the rear entrance of the school.
I just noticed I didn't describe the characters in terms of appearance. I'll add a chapter for Bios and focus on describing future characters :) Thanks so much for reading :D
“You’re most welcome”
Steve held on to Tony’s hand a bit longer before letting go. Sleep slowly started to fill them as they found comfort with each other. Steve was still slightly awake when Tony came closer practically resting his head on Steve’s bare chest, his mustache and beard giving Steve a tickling sensation. With what’s left of his consciousness he wrapped Tony up in his arms as Sleep came over him.
Bio's of characters already written.
Disclaimer: The characters are from the marvel universe. I just write about them.
Tony wants to talk to Steve but gets side tracked.
Tony looks for a place to think. When he does he finds a pleasant surprise.
He looked it up and it was decent by the way it looked in the pictures. It just opened up a month ago, so it wouldn’t be too popular to warrant a big number of customers, though he could be wrong but hey he was Tony Stark.
Tony just nodded, downing almost half of it. “It’s great, I mean, superb or whatever. I mean just, wow Thor, You made this?” Tony asked confused and surprised.
Tony walked up to the counter and removed his shades, perching them on top oh his head
Just then an alarm sounded and the sounds of fighting could be heard from afar. Red diamonds tent became mobile as a protective cage surrounded it and spider like appendages sprouted underneath, carrying him to safety.
I just finished this last night, Hope you guys Enjoy.
“It’s fine Steve” Tony said with a small smile. “It feels awkward yet strangely comforting”.
He pushed off the locker and tucked the note in his jacket pocket. He picked up the bag Steve dropped off and went to class.
Steve gave him a hurt smile, “Yeah” then held him closer.
Tony ran after him.
“Need help? First let me get a snack you distracted me a while ago and I’m still hungry” Steve gave him a grin walking back to the kitchen and fixed himself with the sandwiches he was making a while ago. He took them to the living room and he even got Tony a mug of his favorite coffee. He saw Tony rummaging through his supplies as he entered.
“Hey Thor? You live by the dorms right?” Tony asked shyly as they got out of the booth.
“Yeah, I’m alright, it’s just I was thinking and maybe the things that happened today are getting to me” Tony said rubbing the palm of his hand against his temples.
“You don’t have to deal with this on your own Tony, Science Bros right?” Bruce said raising a fist. “Yeah, Science Bros!” Tony said bumping his fist with Bruce’s.
Steve just nodded. Tony grinned and scooted over to Steve. He took hold of Steve’s arm and draped it across his body; Steve just let him do as he pleased.
“I’m sorry Steve”. They stayed like that for a bit until Tony pulled away but not totally away from Steve’s arms.
“Sorry Pepper, you startled me” Steve said in a low voice as he looked back to Tony.
Thor opened the room and turned on his lamp, Thor’s room was clean a bit of a surprise. He had a queen sized bed with plush pillows and a big comforter on the bed. “Would you mind if we share my bed?” The sofa isn’t as comfortable when one wants to lie down and the floor is simply out of the question.” Thor said simply leading Tony to the bed. Tony plopped himself on the bed. as Thor tied his hair into a low ponytail joining Tony. “I hope this is not strange?” Thor asked as he sat on the bed.
Tony took out his phone, hoping to busy himself; he had also taken out a small notepad he keeps on hand to write down his project ideas and plans. He turned to a blank page and got to work. After a while, Thor came with his order.
“Just don’t try to burn me or the bed” Tony smiled as he saw a bit of steam come off of Steve.
“Why Captain, I’m not that type of guy, we haven’t been on a date yet” Tony teased making Steve blush harder. Tony laughed until the elevator dinged and they were on Steve’s Floor.
Steve liked him? He liked Tony? He never realized, they were just pining over each other and didn’t realize it.
Steve blinked at him, we’re far from other gems and you don’t need to be so formal with me. Steve nodded and Tony smiled. Steve proceeded to remove his uniform while Tony just looked at him shyly.
Tony stood and walked to where Steve was going. He poised himself at the entrance and concentrated. His gem grew bright as a beam of ice shot through his hand. Soon a sheet of ice covered the entrance.
“I’ve been here for a while huh?” Tony asked smiling “Let’s talk over dinner; I wanna taste what this place has to offer” Tony said standing up.
“I, uh, yeah. It’s Tony’s birthday and I don’t know what to get him” He gave a defeated sigh as he opened up his sketch pad, scanning for a blank page, he stopped at a particular sketch. It was a drawing of Tony in the Iron Man suit; he smiled a bit as he remembered when he drew it.
Around him were his team mates all with concerned faces. He was still at the hospital.
“I’m not mad” he said as he got his composure back and made his way to the elevator down the hall. “You’ve been on the roof sketching again huh?” Tony asked casually as he walked beside him.
“Through the summer and the fall, we had each other that was all, just him and I together. Like it was meant to be”
The other day Tony saw Steve coming down the hall before lunch and he looked pretty down. Tony wanted to go over to him because Steve was always the one who was the happy one. He knew he was the one causing Steve to be sad but that all went away when Carter (Peggy) came up beside him and looped her arm around Steve’s; that made Steve smile and Tony’s heart throbbed painfully.
“Tony? What were you really doing?” Steve asked softly. Tony looked at him a bit startled, he then looked away embarrassed. “I wanted to decorate for my B-day, to you know to do something different this year?” He nervously admitted. This was a side of Tony Steve never got to see. Tony being embarrassed and shy. He just smiled fondly.
Steve nodded and gave him a reassuring smile. Tony calmed down and sat back down slowly. “You don’t think it’s weird?” Tony asked confused. Steve gave him another smile. “No, I don’t, I’ve been wanting to try it though, uhm kissing you that is” Steve said as he grew a deeper shade of red.
Tony had taught Steve how to disassemble his suit from the outside if anything like this ever happened and he was glad that they didn’t have to pry him out of it. As the face plate came off, Steve saw bruising and blood. His blood ran cold. They usually got injured in these fights but Tony was in better shape in the past.
(See the end of the chapter for
I have been trying to figure out what angle I wanted to write. I've written a few drafts and trshed or set aside each one. Hopefully this would be good enough.
“Can you finish the song?” Tony asked quietly his eyes were shiny with unshed tears. Steve nodded propping the guitar on his lap as Tony sat beside him. Steve strummed and sang the last few lines.
He was startled from his thoughts when he felt something land on his shoulder; it was peppers hand. She had apparently arrived moments ago upon hearing Tony wake up and rushed to the hospital immediately, evident with her tussled up hair and crumpled blouse.
Her relationship status with Steve is yet to be discussed.
Tony closed the sketch book and turned to Steve, smiling with the biggest smile Steve had ever seen him with. “I LOVE IT!” Tony said flinging himself at Steve wrapping him in a big hug. Then he jolted away as fast, patting Steve’s shoulder. “I mean, ehem, it’s great Steve. Thank you” Tony said casually but he was blushing from embarrassment.
“Tony” Bruce placed a gentle hand on his back and began rubbing soothing circles there.
“That was one hell of a dream Cap! You were thrashing and calling out to Tony and we had to subdue you to get you to wake up. Bruce almost stuck the needle in you to get you to calm down”
“Then you?” Tony asked but Steve cut him off. “Like you? Have for a long time now” Steve smiled bitterly, the threat of tears were imminent. “Steve?” Tony didn’t know what to say. He just closed the gap between them and wrapped Steve in his arms as tight as he could. Steve was surprised but wrapped his own arms around Tony and buried his pace in his shoulder.
“Tell me, why do you think you ran?” Bruce asked calmly.
Suddenly the door opened and Tony heard someone gasp. Immediately Tony looked at who entered and he felt his entire soul ripped from his body; Steve.
A nurse rushed in in moments asking Steve to move back.
“Thanks for helping out Cap. It looks great” Tony grinned at Steve. “I’m just glad it looks decent”. Steve admitted. “Hey! I could’ve made it work!” Tony complained crossing his arms over his chest. Steve smirked and raised an eyebrow, clearly not convinced. “Fine! It would’ve taken awhile but I could’ve done it.” Tony pouted up at him. Steve just laughed at that. They fell silent as they looked at what they had done.
“Nah, Steve and I usually shared a bed so, no worries” Tony said scooting a bit to the side so Thor could get on. Thor smiled as he did. “Hey Thor?” Tony called out sleepily. Thor hummed acknowledging him. “Why were you fighting with Jane today?” Tony asked stifling a yawn. He saw Thor’s expression fade. “Let’s discuss it at a later time Tony, rest now”. Tony nodded as sleep called to him.
“I’ll serve it with your drink” Thor smiled at him and rang him up.
Tony was standing there, at peace with how things went; he just hoped Thor could be happy too. He’d do what he can but right now, he had his own happiness to attend to.
“How long is your break?” Tony asked nervously. He could trust Thor, but he had the knack to blab secrets to everyone at times. “Can I trust you, to you know, keep this between us?” Tony asked hesitantly. He really needed someone to talk to. Bruce was great at calming him down but he wasn’t good with the emotional stuff.
“JARVIS! Why didn’t you tell me Steve was on the floor!” Tony said to the ceiling through gritted teeth.
“I- This, this isn’t what I saw” Sapphire Tony said in fear and embarrassment.
“I know what you were doing but why?”
Getting into his car he made sure to check Steve’s jogging routes to see if there would be any areas or routes he could take to minimize the possibility of bumping into him, a red and gold Lamborghini in not something that say inconspicuous. Steve was diligent with his routines so Tony had no problem finding a good route. He made it home with zero Steve in sight and made his way inside the garage and parked.
“Talk” Natasha said as she glared at Tony. If a stare could kill he’d be dead right then.
I added a few references from the current episodes such as the greeting for higher class gems.
Natasha and Clint were in front of him, Rhodey was holding pepper at one side of the room. Banner was holding what looked like a syringe.
“Still pretty early Cap, Let’s head off to bed, shall we” Tony said getting up, bringing his mug to the sink. Steve followed soon after. They made their way to the elevator and got in after a few seconds.
Steve was relieved and amazed about the abilities Tony was displaying until he fell the rest of the way and landed flat on his face as Tony floated down.
I've already mapped out where things would go from here. Thanks so much for reading.
The beings were known as Gems, sentient humanoid creatures that had a crystal embedded in parts of their anatomy. Each gem was created for a specific purpose and had a specific hierarchy. Gems of nobler class were rare and possessed unique abilities and other commoner types were for menial work such as soldiers and servants.
They stayed like that for a minute until Tony pulled away. “Best birthday gift ever!” Tony said giving Steve a huge grin. Steve smiled but he was surprised to feel something on his lips, it was Tony’s own. As soon as it happened Tony pulled away as if electrocuted. He was completely shocked at his own actions and he was red with embarrassment.
“Same” Tony said diverting his attention to his cooling cup of coffee. “Can I join you?” Steve asked sincerely.
“Yeah, we’ll always be right?” Tony asked smiling fondly.
Steve sat on the edge of his bed with guitar on his lap. Tony had gotten him the guitar because he heard him mention something about Steve playing the guitar when he was younger. Tony had went through the trouble of getting him the guitar because he wanted to make Steve feel welcome and at home while they were living at the tower but lately Tony was different.
“Tony” Her tone was softer now. “What’s happening between you and Steve?” We’ve all noticed how you’ve been avoiding him. Steve’s been different. Not the strong confident happy Steve I’ve grown used to seeing. He’s so vulnerable, so broken-‘“He’s got Peggy to comfort him right?”. Natasha’s eyes grew slightly in shock.
Tony had calmed down enough for them to sit on a few the stools in the lab. He was still sniffling as he rubbed at his nose with the back of his hand. Bruce just sat quietly beside him, he didn’t speak so Tony would be more comfortable initiating a conversation between them. After a minute Tony did.
“Is it to your liking?” Thor asked picking up his own drink.
“We’re both so dense right? Tony asked smiling up at Steve reaching for the tears that have fallen on Steve’s face. Wiping away each one as a few more fell down.
Tony was speechless, he looked up at Steve, their hands softly clamped together and thought of his own feelings for Steve. “I guess it’s the same for me too. You were my hero growing up and when I got to meet you, the real you, things just escalated from their. I know I don’t have the cleanest records when it comes to relationships but-“He gently placed his other hand on Steve’s. “With you I could be something better” Tony admitted in a serious tone. Steve just smiled at that and gently tugged at their hands until Tony was there in front of him again.
I'm happy that the first chapter was received so well and I thought I should put the next one up. Enjoy :)
“SAPPHIRE!” Red Diamond’s voice cut through the crowd.
He felt at home and at peace when he was with Tony. They came from bickering acquaintances to close friends or at least that’s what Steve thought.
“My Father provided me with this room” Thor said as they stepped in. Please make yourself at home; I’ll just prepare a few things.” Thor said entering the bedroom.
Like it? please comment on what you think or things that need improvement on. Thank you.
It was set to detonate any moment.
Steve nodded, “Nightmares, you?”
It's been so long! Ugh I profusely apologize.
“You’re not getting it off, here” Tony then reached for his cheek and proceeded to wipe off the mark. “You must’ve done something sweet, I swear women love me, but they adore you just don’t let Vision know” Tony chuckled as he withdrew his hand. Steve’s brain short circuited.
He’s good at keeping things chill as well. Having learned Zen and the art of relaxation, one could be sure he is one to maintain a level head, most of the time.
Thor smiled at him again, “It’s for me, I thought I might join you. I have my break at the moment.” He said sitting at the other recliner adjacent to Tony’s.
“Tony!” Tony heard Steve call out to him, snapping him out from his daze. Steve was just as surprised as he was and Peggy looked at him sheepishly.
He stepped in and there was a bell on top of the door and he was greeted with the smell of coffee, sweets and a booming welcome. He knew that voice; Thor. And he was right. Behind the counter was none other than Thor Odinson. He couldn’t mistake the large physique, wide beaming smile and loud booming voice.
Steve softly strummed the guitar getting the notes right before gradually getting more volume. He heard a song while they were watching a movie in the rec room. Clint was watching and Steve just sat there occasionally glancing the screen. It was a kid’s movie about toys that came alive when their owners wasn’t there.
“Good morning sir, quite early I see. I was expecting you at a later time. Shall I make you breakfast?” Jarvis asked as Tony made his way to his workshop.
What did you think? I hope this made up for the times I haven't updated. Leave a comment or kudos if you feel like it. Thank you so much.
“Let us retire for the night” Thor said smiling as he stood. Tony was looking around if Thor had left a blanket or a pillow for him to sleep on the couch. Thor just gently grabbed him by the arm and led him to his room. “Thor? Isn’t that your room?” Tony asked tiredly. “Indeed” Thor replied simply opening the door.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thanks a lot Bruce, I promise to help with whatever project you’re working on” Tony said encouragingly. Bruce just gave him a smile as he left the room.
“Thank you!” Steve called out as Wanda closed the door. “Something only he can have.” Steve said to himself and in that instance he had an Idea. He opened his sketch pad and got to work.
“This is unheard of!” “Disgusting!” A chorus of outrage rang across the cloud arena.
Tony was surprised, this was the second time someone hugged him today but he didn’t mind. Thor’s body completely outsized him and he was wrapped around his arms. He found himself wrapping his own arms around Thor. He felt something go down his cheek; he was crying again. He buried himself deeper against Thor tightening his embrace and Thor held him tighter.
“Steve! Wait!” Steve didn’t, he abruptly closed the door and went down the hall. Tony looked at Thor.
Steve started to gather up a few bits of dried or fallen leaves and arranged them in a pile by the side of the cavern wall.
I used the word smile quite a few times cause I know Thor is a generally nice and happy guy. Still planning how to go about this story but it will come in it's own time. Thanks for reading.
“Ah! I see, but I noticed you seem troubled when I saw you come up. Anything on your mind?” Wanda asked giving him a bit of a nudge.
“When you saw me kissing Peggy, I asked her to.” Steve explained, he saw Tony’s sad expression. “But not for the reason you think. I wanted to confirm something about myself then you happened to see us and you know where this is going right?” Tony nodded and smiled. “What did you wanna confirm Steve?” Tony asked curious. “A few things really, I wanted to see if kissing her would spark something in me, a desire for women I guess and It didn’t but you know what I did confirm?” Steve asked smiling.
“I, love, Steve? I guess I do love him” Tony said with small smile. “But, Steve doesn’t love me.” Tony said defeated as he felt his eyes starting to water again.
Tony didn’t know what to do. He was in love with Steve but he has Peggy. Thor said he liked him but did he like him back. Steve and Thor shared many similarities but there were also differences too. Would Thor be Steve’s substitute? No he couldn’t do that to Thor yet Thor would do it for him.
Steve laughed at that, “We’ve been going on dates and didn’t realize it” Tony thought for a minute. “oh yeah come to think of it, we have gone out a few times. But! Those weren’t official; you owe me an official date!” Tony said poking Steve’s chest with his other hand. “Okay I owe you an official date” Steve said smiling. “Good” Tony said happily. Tony looked at Steve lovingly which made Steve smile. Suddenly Tony felt something on his lips; Steve’s own lips were against his. Tony returned the kiss but kept it light.
Suddenly a fait light started glowing, slowly growing in size and brightness. Slowly the light took form. Steve squinted his eyes, the bright light obscuring his vision. When he opened his eyes, he was met with Tony, he looked lost, dressed in a white shirt and white pants, the reactor in his chest shining a faint blue. Slowly Tony looked up.
Tony ignored him and continued munching on his sandwich. They lapsed in comfortable silence until Tony finished his sandwich. “There are a few more things in there.” Steve said pointing to the paper bag. Tony rummaged again pulling out a container with various fruits in it and a Snickers bar.
“Tony? What on earth are you doing?” Steve asked amused.
On his descent he thought of something Wanda had asked him a week ago. “May I ask why the good captain would want to give a gift to someone such as Tony Stark?” That question made him think. It’s true that they’d managed to get pretty close and to be actually friends. The dynamics between them have changed.
In what seemed like forever a faint light came through and Steve carried Tony to the hospital as fast as he could.
It took him an hour or so but he came up with a radar like app for his phone. The way it works is like when a bat uses it’s echolocation but instead of sounds it sends signals. It hones in to a person particular cell signal and sends them pulsing signals that detect where they are in the area.
“That’s calculative. So, no rewards, then?”
“If you want to come back,” she begins slowly.
“… No, Sir.”
It takes Tony three blinks and five full seconds before he replies intelligently with a “
something.
“Coming –”
“The Triskelion’s parking lot, actually. Let’s go. We’re expected.”
giving up, and just like that, despite a flickering HUD and cracking shell of his Iron Man suit, his surmounting fear… vanishes.
It doesn’t matter. He only wishes for Steve to find his swift escape. Through the whitish haze in his vision, Tony tracks the assassin the best he can, and watches him abseil to where Steve is. That idiot, probably still hopeful, still waiting to catch Tony should he fall. He can’t, and he feels so sick to the stomach that he’s bringing only death unto Steve.
That’s adrenaline and blood rush and aftermath of going a few rounds with the punching bags. Thank you for the offer, but he’d rather fuck a PVC pipe lined with sandpaper.
“It’s good to be back!” Two more have just crossed the norther borders. As for him? “Initiate House Party Protocol.”
“OK, nicely played, Anna.” Good. Roll away, Agent. “I’ll see ya around.”
forgotten about that. This stuff inside me though,” Tony groans, his knuckles kneading his temples ferociously. “It’s not curing this stupid headache.”
That’s how Steve ends up ploughing into an abandoned Cineplex, backed up by a six-man-strong STRIKE team extracting hostages, because some psychos are holding up an auditorium of people at gunpoint, demanding an obscene amount of money. To clarify, those guns are reverse-engineered Chitauri tech. That bit warrants the Avengers’ intervention – sorry, he means
Steve graciously moves away from the computers. It’s crammed, and better Tony here than him.
Two hours of driving sensibly from Manhattan to Flushing Meadows and resisting pulling a Schumacher down I-95, he parks outside of Complex B, next to a dashing Audi R8 with the words “STRK” emblazoned on the plate. He’s on his own from here on out, and if it takes him trying out a thousand doors and windows and turning this building inside out in his manhunt for Anthony Edward Stark, then
like right now.”
Mr Stark. There are eyes training on you.”
“My name was announced right after Insight.”
“Just stand there! Wait for it…” This is going to be nothing short of awesome. Steve watches him goof around with a holographic control panel, his hands bracing his waist, feet tapping to the tune Tony’s humming. “JARVIS, re-initialise sequence. Let’s switch things up a bit. Target to B2.”
Steve flattens himself against the wall, creeps as close as he can get to the hinge, and motions for Tony to get the door.
here. Look at the X-ray.” The plastic piece sits on the desk, ignored all the while. “It’s clear! The shrapnel, they’re gone. I’m not sick anymore, Steve!”
Steve doesn’t stop at the keys. Tony eyes him hesitantly when he fetches a coil of rope from the benchtop.
SHIELD paramedics want to keep him hydrated, doped to the gills and alive. Didn’t they just do their darndest best to kill him? He hasn’t gotten signals this mixed up since Bern, 1999.
December second, it’s a Saturday, and seven-oh-five in the morning. Hello, Manhattan. While still lying on his back, head nestling in his pillow, Steve Rogers pulls the sheets off his waist and turns off his bedside alarm. He hasn’t slept a wink all night, having stared at a light brown spot in the northwest corner of the ceiling. He would’ve counted the number of street lights lining the sidewalk forty-five floors below.
“Stay?” Tony asks simply. “I don’t want to see you gone, Steve. The Avengers need you.”
The only sign that Barnes is aware of Tony’s presence is his stiffening shoulders. He’s shaking from the cold, and water rolls off the tip of his nose and chin. He might’ve been crying, if Tony wants to believe that. Barnes’ dull glare on the patch of grass does nothing to ease what’s roiling in Tony’s chest.
“Desperate times call for desperate measures. He doesn’t do that routinely,” the edge of Steve’s lips twitch, and he fakes a light cough.
a series of memo flies into his workshop and holy hell, after the first twenty Howlers of is-Stark-drunk-again and SI-needs-this-contract-period and we’re-not-

The truck rocks as he goes about whatever Tony just sets him to do. All things considered, for a normal guy, he’s handling this moment extremely well. It’s not every day one finds a presumed-dead Iron Man sitting in his truck, colluding with a wanted-dead-or-alive fugitive and still has the presence of mind to fix some hardware.
“Watch your attitude when you’re parading your Avenger identity, Stark.”
“Captain Rogers? Is everything all right?” The cool, artificial intonation of JARVIS resounds in the monotony of the garage.
“I’m saying I need help.”
Steve closes the hefty doors behind him – this time, with a gentle tap instead of a ferocious slam – and slumps against it. He stands there for a whole minute, but AC/DC doesn’t blare from the speakers anymore. Steve leaves the Expo grounds after that, making his lonesome way back to Manhattan, still as burdened as before.
“I’m a lot of things, Steve. Where have you been?”
Tony finally obliges, and slowly turns around and replaces his head on the pillow. He tries not to squirm so much, or

doesn’t look like she’s buying it. Granted, none of these are evidences.
He flips Tony over again so he’s lying on his stomach. Snaking one arm around his middle, Steve reels him in until he’s on four. A rather vulnerable position – Steve locks Tony’s ankles with his own – plenty of openings for attack, no means for defence.
“Tony, these are not proofs. We can’t ask SHIELD to cancel Insight based on a

sorry for – everything. I’m not…” Tony waves a hand frantically between them, his forehead creasing as he searches for the right vocabulary. “I was an asshole, for pulling that off, and I want to apologise. I was, well…”
What is he doing?
Forgive him, Father, for he has sinned. “I’m having some really nasty thoughts about you right now, Steve. Does that make me a bad person?”
“Shit…”
“They found you?”
! Not this time, not when he can help it, and certainly not under his watch. Aren’t his parents enough? How many more must Barnes massacre? Stupid,
“… You’re blocking the sidemirror.”
He smells dried urine when he crosses the threshold.
“Tony!”
Fury not-so-subtly reminds Steve to get all his superhero ducks in a goddam row.
“Can you alert the paramedics?”
“You’ve been out for four hours, Tony. I have all the time to think this through.”
“Looking for this?” Steve’s question is a breath away from his earlobe. “I found it on the coffee table outside.” His wallet has strangely made its way into Steve’s hand.
That’s one barrier down. Tony could’ve crossed over to the back and do whatever he needs to do with the escort in the backseat
“It’ll be there.”
“That’s half-an-hour grace, max. Can you make it?”
, numbers I could still read. It was last accessed two weeks ago –”
“… Phase one, Stark’s surveillance system,” Steve chips in, his voice straining the words. “Phase
“Steve, open the door!” He’s here, dammit, he’s
“… Having the suits will help a great deal, though,” Tony quips, and takes a sip of water from Steve’s mug.
“Call them to you.”
“Tony –”
Steve stumbles closer to Fury’s bed, and braces the railings. “They cut you open,” he whispers with disbelief, “your heart
“We don’t want to have to reach that stage, Agents,” Fury clarifies, waving around a cannulated hand to make his point. “We can’t say they won’t immediately go to town with those ‘Carriers once they’re online.”
“We were almost done anyway. Everything all right with Nick?”
In the next heartbeat, his tablet turns back on.
Saying all these to Tony has been right. It
“It doesn’t anymore. Comes and go.”
It’s a shared grave, so not one to be disrespectful of his father, Tony glances sideways at Steve and says, “Hey, Dad. We found Rogers.”
“Are you clear, Tony?”
Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other.
It’s high time for a change, too, in case they have eyes on our plates.”
“OK, J. Don’t go shiny on me
“The security system, Tony! Pay attention!”
Ross makes to open his mouth, but he shuts it and looks over his shoulder. Pepper stands her ground, but keeps her distance.
“I know we joked about it before, but we seriously need to reconsider our growing nonchalance towards your newly-gained powers.”
“It’s really not about you.”
“You won’t.”
One, two –
for permission to leave. Steve figures Tony has earned his release, so he maxes out the stimulation, and redirects all of his displeasure to Fury and Fury alone.
Sounds fun. “My new year resolution.”
“OK. On your cue, Tony.”
“I’ve some proposals for you to go through,” Pepper says, and her heels tap away on polished marble as she leads him the way. “My office?”
“I know what that is.”
“Captain!”
“It’s BARF.”
Tony isn’t asleep. He may not stir, he may not respond when Steve calls his name, but he guarantees the heavens above. Tony Stark is not asleep.
“In essence everyone is bisexual in nature; society has dictated which gender is right for the other. I do not believe this is so.” Thor stated as if he was debating with someone, maybe he has before..
“Tony? If you could hear me, please. Wake up. I miss you” Steve said giving Tony’s hand a light squeeze. “It’s not the same you know? I miss the way you bring so much joy into my day like you always did. I’ll be here when you wakeup.”
Tony closed his eyes as Steve sang, laying his head on Steve’s shoulder until Steve was done.
“Do not be my friend, I accept defeat before the battle but I bear no ill will towards Captain Rogers” Thor said calmly closing the distance between him and Tony. “I pray for your happiness with the one you love” Thor gently took Tony’s hand and grasped it gently, leaving a sweet kiss on the back of it.
“I didn’t order the other one Thor.” Tony said as more of a question.
Steve hummed in agreement relaxing a bit but turned a stern gaze on Tony” Didn’t I tell you to eat before downing Caffeine? And shouldn’t you be in class?” He said with slight irritation.
“Lo-lovely weather right?” Toy said managing a weak smile. Natasha’s stare hardened. Tony gulped in fear. “Wha-what do you want me to say?”
Tony Knew this was going to happen and accepted the fact that he'll be a casualty, but Steve didn't.
Tony brushed a few hairs that started covering his face “Thank you Steve” he said with a grateful smile. Steve felt warm until flames erupted from the dried sticks and leave on the cavern floor.
Tony drove off in his red and gold Lamborghini, hoping to put whatever it is that happened behind him. He thought of his usual spots but he also thought Steve would look for him there. He thought of going home to busy himself in his workshop. Tinkering always helped him cope with things but Steve would just go there too and Jarvis is too polite to lie to Steve. He was running out on options.
Steve just chuckled and asked if he was okay.
It's been a while and finally I made a chapter. This is how things started between them in this story. Just really full of fluff. I mean I needed something salty to counteract all the sweetness I wrote down.
“Tho-Thor Please, Stop.” With that Thor did, looking embarrassed and disappointed. He released Tony, giving him some room and Tony scrambled to sit down, Thor following.
“What?” Tony asked curious. “When Peggy was kissing me, I didn’t feel like I was kissing Peggy. I was thinking about kissing you.” Steve said quietly and obviously embarrassed. Tony could see that Steve was blushing fiercely. Tony chuckled at the way Steve was acting, he was always the mushy emotional one, Tony was too more so than him, but he also felt overjoyed at the fact Steve was thinking of him when he was kissing Peggy.
He was from another dimension, one without technological advances. A land you could only read about in story books. After telling the avengers of his origins, Nick Fury consulted the other mystical heroes to see if they could aid with the return of the dimensional traveler.
Tony sighed, “I just never knew you’d-” “Be attracted to you?” “No. Be attracted to guys in general”.
Soon the pile grew and Steve had Tony test it out. Tony felt comfortable with the makeshift bed.
Steve didn’t want to but he was being pulled back by Nat and Clint. Pepper was begging him to let the doctors work on him and that he’ll be alright.
Bucky and Rhodes were wide eyed with shock at their actions, Steve more so.
Tony made his way to school as usual, checking his phone every now and then. It was still pretty early so there weren’t many students in school yet. He did see a few familiar faces, Natasha Romanov and Clint Barton were walking down the halls bantering good naturedly and Natasha even shoved Clint against the wall.
“You’d do that?” Tony asked disbelievingly.  “Science bros,right? I’m gonna look for him and then I’ll send you a txt when I find him” Bruce said with a smile.
It;s been a week and things aren't looking up for Tony and Steve. Someone has a little chat with Tony.
“Yeah, you most of all” Steve said smiling. “Guilty” Tony returned.
Tony returned the smile, “Nah just finishing up a new program I was going to make when I get home.” Tony said pocketing his pad and phone.
“Rough day?” Bruce asked with a comforting smile.
“Lonely and forgotten, never thought he’d look my way, but he smiled at me and held me just like I want him to, like he loved me when he loved me”
Thor immediately smiled. “I have just the thing! Find a place to recline and I’ll serve it to you in a short while” Thor said adjusting his apron.
Thor suggested bringing some Asgardian mead from his home world. That was something Tony might actually like.
“It’s time for our practice Tony, let’s talk about this at another time, I’m sorry we couldn’t finish this conversation; I hope you could work this out with Steve.” Thor said picking up his discarded food wrappers and cup. Tony called out to him “Please don’t let Steve know about me or this place.” Thor smiled and nodded in agreement and walked to the entrance. Tony sighed looking up at the sky praying he knew how to deal with this.
Tony stepped out of the room and wasn’t surprised to see Natasha vanish so easily. She could be a ghost the way she walks down the halls, always popping up when you least expect.
“Tony?” A voice called out behind the tree he sat beside ion; this was his reason.
Another update, it's been long overdue for an update.
Tony wasn’t the only one that got an amazing present, apparently, so did Steve.
“Took you long enough” Steve said burying his face on Tony’s shoulder.
Tony smiled as he read the letter but faltered as he read the part about Steve.. Jarvis was always so caring and thoughtful. He ate what he could and made his way to his room to bathe and change before going to class. He checked his messages and sure enough Steve left him a dozen.
Last one to leave was Thor, Tony had asked Steve if he could talk to Thor and Steve agreed, giving Tony a sweet kiss on the forehead and patted Thor’s shoulder as he passed him walking the direction their group was heading.
Tony laughed at Steve’s embarrassment causing Steve to heat up more. He walked around the cavern and gathered a few sticks and leaves to help the fire grow, trying his best not to lit up the whole cavern floor.
It's been months since I last updated and here you go, Please enjoy. More to come :)
“TONY!!!!” Steve yelled at the top of his lungs as he struggled. Suddenly he felt pain on his side and dark tentacles wrapping him in darkness.
“I gotta go Tony, meet up later?” Steve said waving goodbye.
Steve turned, looking at Tony, “Before he came, you were always with me and now” Steve stopped and looked away. It was Tony’s turn to sigh. “Is that why you’ve been acting this way?” Steve didn’t answer.
“What about?” Tony asked concerned. Thor looked around, “Let’s discuss this in private.”
It's been a while. Thanks to those who read and helped make this work orderly. Enjoy
“Hmm BLT with a generous amount of hot sauce and cut into triangles” Tony said analyzing the sandwich then opening the zip-lock and took a big bite. He moaned as he bit into it.
Finale of the story.
“Rest well Steve” Tony said getting more comfortable as the fatigue from the day caught up with him.
Steve walked carefully as to not jostle Tony but his intention soon backfired as he managed to bump against a stool and the sound alerted Tony that he almost toppled over his own stool. Steve made a run for Tony as to avoid him falling to the floor. He made it in time to balance out the chair and they both sighed in relief.
”I will Thor, soon, but not right now” Tony said sadly. Thor moved his hand to Tony’s and squeezed. “I understand” Tony squeezed back “Thanks and Thanks for the snacks” Tony said giving Thor a toothy grin.” You are most welcome.” They stayed like that for a while, Thor not really letting go of Tony’s hand until Tony felt better.
He was sickly growing up but with the help of a kind doctor, he was given needed treatment and grew in every sense of the word. He is a few inches taller that Tony almost reaching 6 feet. He’s got Blonde hair and deep Blue eyes and the build of a superhuman.
I'll be sure to add better descriptions of characters in the future chapters.
r: A British exchange student and the vice president of the school council. Along side Steve they make the school progressive and safe. She is a modern woman in every sense of the word. She’s also a prominent figure in school as much as Steve.
When he got there he saw he wasn’t the only one who wasn’t getting any sleep. Tony was sitting on a stool beside the kitchen counter. He was rubbing his temples in an effort to soothe his raging thoughts as a steaming mug of coffee sat in front of him. He didn’t even notice Steve coming in.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony looked around, it was already dark out. He took out his phone again and it read 8:30 P.M.
Steve felt relieved he could cry. He ran a gentle hand across Tony’s cheek and hair. He looked like he was gonna pass out any second. Tony opened his mouth to speak and with a lot of effort, he said something that made Steve feel horrified:
It was dark, really dark. Steve couldn’t see anything. Every way he turned; darkness. He called out but his voice only echoed in the darkness. He started walking, his feet stepping on solid darkness as he tried to make sense of where he was.
“I, uh, Steve, you, uhm, I, well” he didn’t make sense but just abruptly stood up trying to make a break for it. Steve quickly grabbed his wrist. “Wait! Tony, I, it’s okay. I uh kinda liked it” Steve admitted, his cheeks taking on color. Tony’s eyes grew wide. “You do?”
He checked his phone to see where Steve would be at that moment. Steve was on the move. Tony tracked where he was headed; the football field. They must have practice today. Tony pocketed his phone and made his way there. He was in the other side of the school, it would take him no less than fifteen minutes to get there.
“I’m glad you are not harmed” Thor said relieved.
“JARVIS, Time?” Tony asked the ceiling.
“Never mind Tony, Good night” Steve said in a rush to get back to his room but Tony reached for his arm.
The room was an explosion of gleaming red and gold. Streamers, balloons and other party décor with Tony’s signature colors. Tony had even made little fixtures that looked like mini arc reactors. Tony wanted to have a night party during the day that will go way into the night. Only a few good people will attend so that’s why Tony wanted to decorate himself.
Tony was dumbstruck, he did this to Steve.
“I understand” Thor said solemnly. “Might I kiss you once more?” Tony thought for a minute but agreed. Thor smiled up at him. Their lips met again and this time Tony returned it.
“Stark! Fancy seeing you here. Tis a surprise seeing you at such a small establishment.” Thor greeted warmly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony was both the school’s greatest asset and its destroyer. He creates mechanical wonders that have benefited the school and its students but often than not leaves the school’s labs either blown up or in disarray but he survives though being the child of an extremely wealthy family helped pay for any damages to the school.
“We’d best rest” Steve suggested standing up while dusting himself off. Tony nodded, as he stood as well.
Steve stood outside with his back to the room as he tried to compose of himself. He was silently praying that Tony will be alright.
The place was actually bigger than it was shown in the pictures he’d seen. It was a one floor building almost like a diner but you couldn’t mistake the aroma of coffee emanating from the building. Tony knows his coffee and this place smelled like the good stuff he like to indulge in, though not his usual Starbucks he thought he might actually like it here.
(See the end of the chapter for
He went around asking the other Avengers on what to get him, they replied in odd ways.
It wasn’t often that Steve was frustrated, well not as frustrated before. With him waking up 75 years into the future to a time he didn’t know and the lives of the people he knew had gone by, who wouldn’t be frustrated.
“Good day Captain” Wanda greeted him with a smile.
Tony looked at Bruce in surprise.
“I stumbled on this place while exploring, I’m pretty sure no one knows it’s even here” Ton said with pride. Thor smiled at him and as they got in Thor set down his baggie on one of the benches inside. “It feels like this place is another world entirely” Tony said fondly. He looked at Thor who was now holding up 2 paper cups and offered the other to Tony. “Thanks”
Tony looked at Thor” You didn’t tell me why you and Jane were fighting yesterday?” Thor’s smile faded but it returned in a sad way. “She and I well, we’ve decided to see other people. She will be leaving to study else where and we had issues to discuss yesterday that escalated to that degree.”
Tony looked up to see a blonde head peeking out from the side of the tree.
“I’m still new to this place and just by looking at the menu, it’s a bit overwhelming.” Tony said scratching the side of his head. It was true the menu selection posted against the wall was large, certain blends, drinks and food items written in fancy fonts. There was a specials board at the front of the counter as well.
Steve get comfort from a friend.
Tony’s mind put the pieces together. It felt like the same thing when he saw Steve kissing Peggy.
It was the eve of Tony’s birthday and Steve was getting his present ready for tomorrow. He’s spent most of his off time working on his gift and with the load the Avengers had to deal with were dealt as fast as they came. It was a miracle that nothing major, end-of-the-world catastrophes had occurred within that time leaving Steve with enough time to get his gift ready.
"You did protect me, I'm still here if it wasn't for you, Calm down Steve" Tony said soothingly. "You know? I've always been weak but gaining your strength from fusing made me feel invincible" Tony chuckled as he remembered their earlier fusion.
“Thanks again Thor, for you know today and this. I just don’t want to deal with any of this until morning. Tony said sighing heavily as he slumped in his seat. Thor looked at him smiling reassuringly “Do not mention it Tony”. Tony settled back on the sofa as Thor continued reading. Thor was still reading when Tony felt the pull of sleep, Thor must’ve seen him as he placed a lightning bolt shaped bookmark in his book and set it down.
They’re rolling out in four hours. There’s a lot of responsibilities piling on Tony’s shoulders, so he gets to ride with Captain America. Since he can’t – and won’t – risk setting up a flimsy VPN from outside of the Triskelion complex, he needs to be smuggled into preferably, the command room adjacent. How he wishes to have his covert suit in hand. Sure makes the job easier. That suit rocks the retro reflective panels in stealth mode, hell, he could cha-cha
He tosses something at Steve’s head. “Put that on.”
glare from across the room. “We take Pierce out, we ground the ships. That’s still cutting it too close. We need to front an attack from within Insight. That’s where Tony comes in.”
The world as Steve knows it is gone. Perhaps not lost, but changed.
I want on.”
“The United States government has been studying the… problem of enhanced individuals for years.
“Can’t cheat death, can I?”
too is among them, Steve notices belatedly. He’s sleeping, his body sprawling across the two-seater like an oversized octopus, legs dangling off the armrest. A thick book is spread atop his chest, one hand splayed over its cover to keep it in place.
One week later, Natasha radios in on the day Clint says she’s scheduled to come back. She says, “I can’t come back yet. This one is less of an idiot than I expected. Give me another week. Or a year. Nick says this village is famous for their eggnog, says I should try it out. It’s August, damn it. I’m sorry, Steve. Can I borrow Clint?”
The intruder calmly reaches to his right thigh, and unholsters his sidearm.
The helmet glows brighter as JARVIS speaks from the inset speakers. “Jackson Brice, alias, ‘The Goblin’, was an ex-employee of Toomes Salvage Company. In 2010, the company was forced into foreclosure once Damage Control officially takes over clean-ups post-Avenging.”
They barely make it out in one piece. The blast throws him off his feet that he cartwheels across the length of the Potomac below him, before slamming into one of the Triskelion wings and bowled through three layers of walls.
Iron Man’s MO has always been I-break-it-I-buy-it, meaning, every single thing that he breaks in the process of superhero-ing, he makes sure damages are billed back to Stark Industries. He’s careful with his business, because he’s not made of money – he would be if he’d stopped thrashing things and raking up collaterals. But fuck this time.
That’s the kind of deux ex machina his life sorely needs. “I’m starving.”
“Steve, it’s me. It’s me! Look at me!” He can’t get to Steve. The door remains resolutely locked. He knows how the haunting is like. Sometimes, it’s one night too many. “You’re safe. I have food, they’re warm! There’s beer. You don’t get drunk, but these are all free! Lucky, huh?” He’ll wrangle Steve back from the precipice. He’ll break through the glass if he has to. Rip his throat out screaming. He will. “I was listening to the radio whole morning. You’re still America’s Most Wanted Bachelor. I’m jealous. I’m not even in the footnote. And the Mandarin announced two more strikes. It’s a dangerous place, Steve. We need you.
“Milos, still all there?”
And the breakfast afterward?
“Then, stay,” Tony cuts in. “You don’t have to do this.”
“That’s the plan.”
breathes a sigh of relief when the air-conditioning and lights come back on. There’s probably fifteen minutes left for all thirty suits to complete downloading every byte of Stark Tech.
from the – Jesus Christ – Iron Man helmet Tony has stowed under the pile of blanket near his feet.
“No! OK, you know what? If you find anything weird, you’re free to report it to your superiors. Hill, Fury, up to you. Please,” Tony begs, “this is important.”
Tony. In the glaze of his brilliant blue eyes, there is the War, sprays of bullet and artilleries, an endless fire.
I know your combat experiences surpass any Generals’ still alive, and I’m not kissing your ass, Rogers, so shut up and listen. When your call and mine differ, I choose to trust mine. My numbers, my codes. Yet, I was wrong. Time and again, you guys surprise me, and it’s not because I’ve been… looking down on – no, sorry, let me try again – I guess I should’ve trusted you.”
“… You’re not done yet, Mr Stark.”
He’s stuck between the computers and Tony
, they’re not. Is that the fourth you’re eating?”
There’s a brief pause on Steve’s side, and he mutters, “George Washington University Hospital.
– dammit. It occurs to him Iron Man is still allowed to call 911 for help. He has his cell phone with him.
“… That’s a bit too forward, isn’t it?”
“Right arm out.”
Despite not having returned in years, Tony knows exactly where his parents are. He turns sharply to the right after the first row of ancestors. The garden, sombre it may be, is manicured, very well kept. It’s also deathly quiet, as if to welcome Stark’s last heir into the fold.
“I don’t pity you. If this makes you feel better, go on. I can take it.”
“… No,” Steve admits bitterly. “Not really.”
And it’s abruptly radio silence on Steve’s side. No matter how hard he taps on the black plastic wedged in his ear, it won’t come alive, won’t crackle the slightest. The line has gone cold. “
Tony steals a glance at Steve as he opens the fridge. “Need something?”
“Not for long.”
“Steve, listen to me,” Tony gasps, his bloody hand comes up to grip at the metal rod in front of him. Steve can’t bear the sight, but he steels his heart, and makes to support Tony’s head in his palms. “Steve… Steve…” It’s also getting brighter, and warmer. From
His bracelet is dead. It’s cold and quiet, a useless hunk of stainless steel around his wrist. His chest feels tight against his palpitating heart, his arc reactor warmer than usual as the generator drains the power stored within. The hole in the door quickly expands as the man kicks and punches at it, sending debris flying into the room.
“… It’s called doing your job.”
“Whose side are you on, Rumlow?” Steve growls tightly as Rollins frees him from the bungee cord.
Tony kind of hangs around his car, not wanting to continue working on it, not with all the bangs and clangs. But, Steve pins him where he is with a stare, so that means he’s not to leave the garage unless Fury instructs him to – and he hasn’t. From the tail of his eye, Steve knows this will
That is the last time Steve ever lets Tony do grocery shopping on their collective behalf. They’re still a good ten hours of continuous drive from New Jersey, so that means a pit stop somewhere off the roads to catch up on sleep. Tony checks Steve next to him, still snoozing. Thirty-six hours on the wake is tough on the body, with super-soldier serum or not. He can be a dear and wake Steve up regardless. Force him to switch.
It takes a different level of detachment to function at War. How many times had he parked his soul under his bed as he slung his gun across his back and marched out to flirt with Death once more? Here lies Tony, at the brink of everything, with him, his salvation. Steve reaches under Tony and gauges the way the rod bends under Tony’s weight.
“Well, well. To what do I owe Captain America’s special attention. You must’ve liked me more than you’d care to admit.”
“OK, how about…” Tony lurches from the sofa and wobbles on his feet a second. That’s enough scotch for the day. “You guys do room service?”
“I got you a spare key card from the reception just now,” says Steve, as he presses the plastic piece into Tony’s palm. “In case we miss housekeeping.”
… Great.
“’Take the opportunity to pilfer a goat’.”
“Yeah, that needs some recalibration. Uh,” Steve just backslaps the boot into his red Audi, “mind the property, honey.”
“Nick’s been shot.”
. I’ll show you.”
“Careful what you wish for, Stark.”
At that exact moment, a quartet of Agents – fully geared and totting MK5 – breaks past the canteen’s perimeter and scouts the surrounding. Tony instinctively shields his brows with his hand, and grows a sudden interest for the Calathea. Cocking his head to the right, his earpiece digging deeper, he whispers, “They’re onto me, Steve.”
“My image? What image? Contrary to popular belief, I’m actually fine with this. I’m not embarrassed – I rather enjoy myself.”
He isn’t about to take Iron Man out on a self-imposed search-and-rescue or counter-attack mission. He hasn’t been Iron Man-ing much – or at all – since Vanko. Speaking of which, he recalls the stink-eye French government gave him when he shoved said Russian terrorist into Monaco’s prison. Guess how happy the Kuwaiti government will be with him making a three-point landing at the US embassy’s courtyard? Point is, Iron Man isn’t a band-aid when mankind throws a tantrum. That’s SHIELD’s prerogative, and this is him doing SHIELD a favour by calling their hotline to politely alert them to trouble.
“You love me?” Tony asked not looking at Steve.
Tony sat there thinking. Contemplating everything that’s happened and thought of ways he could make amends with Steve. He loved him even though Steve may never feel the same but Steve was his best friend. Natasha’s words were sinking in as he stood. He walked out of the room and made his way to somewhere he needs to be right now; With Steve.
“Well I’ll be damned” Tony said taking another sip.
I know I could have done this better but I'm still learning and I'll edit the whole story again in time. Thanks for reading :)
“My Diamond, I have Arrived” Tony said entering and bowed lowly.
“A free pass for a beating for being obnoxious” Black widow had a smirk as she told him. He noted never to get on her bad side.
“Tony, I am pleased you’ve arrived safely. Please I need your power. The rebels have been hindering this colony for far too long now. Tell me, will we succeed in annihilating them?” Red Diamond asked, his voice was deep yet smooth.
Let me know what you think. I'll finish this to make room for more STU styled fics.
Tony stood there for a few minutes until his phone buzzed. He looked at his messages, Steve left a few and even tried to call him but he didn’t want to look at the right then but he did see Bruce’s message. “Go”
“Is the glow bothering you, I could cover it up” Tony offered placing his hand over the reactor cutting of a bit of the light.
“Go to him, I apologize if I’ve complicated things further”. Thor said with remorse.
“Thank you Thor, that means a lot.” When Thor let go, Tony gave him a hug which Thor happily returned.
Hi readers, I'm happy with the reception of this story and I'll do my best to make it great. Enjoy this chapter :)
In the end he parked to the side and did what he did best; think. He took out his phone (the one he designed) and started searching for possible places where Steve wouldn’t find him. He triangulated possible routes that Steve will go and formulated possible scenarios that could happen. His list was short but he was sure Steve wouldn’t find him in those places and areas.
Steve finds something interesting when he went down for a snack in the middle of the night.
Tony gasped in surprise but didn’t protest as Steve ran from the rain. He thought Steve felt warm, most rubies are of fire elements which may explain why Steve was so warm.
Suddenly, Steve felt Tony’s hand squeezing his hand. He was shocked and immediately pressed the button for the nurse, almost smashing the button to bits.
“I, I don’t know Thor. Honestly I do. I have to think on things but for now I have to talk to Steve. I want; no I need to tell him. He’s my best friend and I don’t want things between us going south just cause I have feelings for him.” Tony said taking Thor’s hands away from his face, Thor held onto his.
Bruce was startled when he barged him but he begged Bruce not to tell Steve he was there. He must’ve said something to make Bruce worry but he just nodded his head and Tony just entered the labs supply room hoping that Bruce would keep Steve away for now. A minute later he heard the muffled sounds of someone talking, he knew it was Steve so just braced himself against the door and prayed Steve would go away.
“I’m fine, are you okay?” Tony asked stepping forward this time.
They weren’t alien to being held by the other. Steve needed this and Tony at times too this time they both did. “Talk to him Steve” Tony asked pushing himself from Steve’s chest but Steve still held his waist. Steve sighed, “Okay, I will”. “Good” Tony smiled relieved. “Still want to go out? Or we could stay in my room and watch movies like we used to?” That sounded great.
“CLEARLY! And How dare you fuse with a member of my court! You will be shattered for this!” Red diamond’s voice rang across the area.
(See the end of the chapter for
– Tony’s resolve solidifies. But, he doesn’t ready his fist. He swims, and Barnes trudges into the bushes.
They just crossed the state border into New Jersey. No roadblocks, no patrols on their trail. Steve is about to thrash this car and borrow another one to throw their pursuers off the scent… but the coast has been clear so far.
“Just the one.”
He’s naked, remember? Yes, he just streaked across a neighbourhood park in his birthday suit to get into this truck. Not his proudest moments. And the least he thinks about it, the better. Too bad there’s no food in the glove box – which is disgusting, on second thought – or spare cash. There’s a radio, though, which is God-given. A

Steve might say no. Does that explain his tachycardia? “Since I’m already booked, why not?”
He doesn’t know how long he sat in the sofa until he hears the tell-tale rattling of a trolley outside his corridor. He gives himself a once over in the reflection of a glass-doored bookcase – making sure he has at least pants on – and gets the door. Steve is already there, one hand reaching out for the bell.
come back, glimmers of red and gold – the only spectacle that makes sense in his deteriorating sight – and lay waste to what’s left of his Malibu home. They’re programmed for utter annihilation, and will not stop until every unit of computer, every disc, every
He rounds a corner and heaves a sigh of relief. Steve is seated on a bench, head bowed in prayer.
“I have a bad feeling about this, Steve.”
Steve suspects just as much. The world may not have woken up to the news of war hero Captain America’s return, but SHIELD has. SHIELD dregs him from the frozen seas, and breathes air into his breasts. They haven’t seen the wrath of Steve Rogers, but there are tales from the Wars. He’s the largest threat standing between Project Insight, and world’s peace.
It’s getting hot in here. “It’s fine.”
“Wait, Sir, in my car,” the older man swallows again. “The glovebox. I have a gun. Take it. It’ll serve you better.”
“I’m fine, Cap. I think someone’s broken his leg. I’m helping evac. Tony is fine, too. I think his comm is broken, but he’s fine.”
“In my defence, I did not anticipate that amount of love. It’s flattering.”
Then Steve meets Tony’s gaze evenly, and wonders how well Tony would take it. He hasn’t broken the news to the others, but he can roughly guess who will be in the no-way-camp or the OK-camp. But, with Tony?
“It healed your hand.”
as they spill.
“Yeah.”
“… Not if he has wings
Tony says nothing, contemplating his answers as if they’re etched on Steve’s face. For one full minute at that, silently challenging Steve to vocalise the unsaid orders.
Tony blinks his sleepiness away, his chin tilting up to have a better look at Steve. “Did you sleep at all?”
He almost scalped Steve in his urgency. Shame on him when he
“I mean, your own room, Stark. This is embarrassing! Now, stand up.”
Sensually.
“You walk. I’ll drive the car in. Take the helmet with you.”
Tony is still nowhere to be found. Someone is skiving off Avengers duty again.
Morbid? Judging by the steel-hot lash in his side, not so far-fetched. Maybe the suit is the only thing holding pieces of him together.
harbinger of ill news. It’s almost always either about the end of the world, or his life.
“You’re overreacting, Doctor… uh…”
“When has it ever, with SHIELD?”
… He’s still computing them. That can’t be right.
“I don’t know what to do with you, honestly!”
He sees red, and orange and the fucking sun – his shirt is disintegrating.
Tony solemnly swears that he is up to no good. That he will not hold back, and he will do his damnest best to bring those Helicarriers down. Amen to the God of everything mechanical. He zips upward like a rocket and tanks all the G’s that would’ve mushed his eyeballs, if he didn’t have Extremis. His nose does bleed, and copper trickles down his throat – minor issues. Still a win.
“I mean, permanently, Tony.” Which stops Tony dead in his track. “I’m resigning from the Avengers, effective tomorrow.”
Tony doesn’t jerk himself after that. He zips his suit up, and continues to stare out of the window. This isn’t exactly what Steve demanded, but he’s fine with conceding this time. Until the next adventure, that is. He never thought of ever revisiting this phone number. To it, he texts:
“Not this one. The other one.”
No homo, brother.
“Not funny, Tony. Let me go.”
“No, not on the company. Just on specific technology that we’re selling to SHIELD.”
“Fine. You want to be like this?”
The eyes on the Iron Man helmet suddenly shine brilliantly white. Steve almost drops it when JARVIS says, “Sir, incoming short range ballistic in thirty seconds.”
“Insight is
“With due respect, General. If Fury knows about this –”
, or –”
Rarely a minute passes by in silence when Tony Stark occupies said space.
He is
“I wasn’t, but now I’m uh, inebriated somewhat. How can you tell?”
“Sir is currently driving a 1952 Chevrolet pickup. There are no accessible computer circuits to access.”
“Yeah, Wanda was there too but she left with Vision for patrol” Steve explained when Tony asked “Yeah, that’s her lipstick right?” Tony pointed to his cheek as the elevator opened. Steve was again embarrassed and tried to rub off the kiss mark, which he didn’t know was there in the first place. Tony just laughed at him.
Why did he run? Tony thought back to what happened. He saw his best friend/crush kissing someone. He felt surprised then he felt betrayed then sad then as he saw Steve looking at him; fear.
It took a minute for his mind to register what was going on and in that minute Thor had pushed him against the wall, deepening the kiss. Tony felt dazed and confused by the sheer surprise of the kiss and the confusion that was brought on by Thor suddenly locking lips with him. Thor broke the kiss and was aiming for his neck when Tony pushed him away from him.
“Steve!” Tony said rising from his seat. Thor was silent as he looked at Steve, his face calm yet tense. Tony feared the worst.
Sorry if Thor sounded out of character. what did you Thin? I'd love to hear from you. More to follow. Till next update :D
Tony sighed heavily. He didn’t speak for a minute. “I, I saw something I shouldn’t have seen” Tony said taking a deep breath.” I saw him and Peggy kissing in the student council room, I just walked in on them and I didn’t know what happened but I ran. I think Steve was calling out to me but I just ran faster then I came here and hid then-“
Tony exited his workshop and headed for the kitchen where he knew Jarvis would be but instead found a note.
“Hey Cap! Whoah! Punching bags don’t grow on trees you know?” Tony gave him a cheeky grin which for some reason made Steve even more pissed than before.
Tony hung his head as the onslaught of emotions attacked him. “I-I don’t want to end things with Steve” Was Tony’s simple reply.
“It’s fine Steve” Tony said as he crawled on Steve’s bed, Steve following him in.
“Tony? Please? Forgive me” Thor said cupping Tony’s face making him lookup at him. There were tears coming down Tony’s face and Thor just wiped them away. He leaned his forehead against Tony’s. “I’m sorry Tony Please don’t cry”.
There efforts were rewarded when they came out on top with a few bangs and bruises but they still managed. Only in a last effort, the one’s facing Steve and Tony’s team had done the cliche’; a bomb.
“I could not find ones that fit you but these might do, they are a bit snug for me but maybe they’d work for you.” Thor handed him a bundle of clothes that comprised of a pair of shorts and a large tee, a tooth brush and a towel were there too. Tony thanked him and stepped in the bathroom. The tee was large on Tony as well as the shorts but they felt comfortable and smelled nice, kind of like the scent of rain, Tony stepped out and saw Thor had changed too and was sitting on the sofa reading a book. He was wearing a tee shirt with a lightning bolt on it and a pair of pajama pants with the same print. Tony couldn’t help snickering. He placed his clothes on the table beside and sat beside Thor.
“Hey Thor, watch where your going next time or let people know your around a corner so they wouldn’t bump into you and maybe cause a concussion” Tony joked rubbing his nose. Thor smiled.
“It’s just me” Steve said sitting down. “dozed off a bit there didn’t I” Tony asked a little bit embarrassed. “Yeah, you did” Steve smiled trying to not mention he was cute. He then placed his neatly wrapped gift on Tony’s lap. He waited eagerly to see what he would do.
Bruce was at a loss, he never saw this side of Tony and he just did what he thought of best; he hugged Tony. Tony latched on to him, his soft cries becoming sobs as he held Bruce as if he was the only thing keeping him together.
The sun wasn’t up so he guessed it was still early in the morning. The events of his dream were still playing in his mind. He turned on the faucet and splashed some water on his face. Tony took a deep breath as he braced himself on the sink. He was going to have to face Steve sooner or later today and he didn’t want that. How was he going to explain things to Steve? He got out of the bathroom and made his way to Thor’s small kitchen. He smiled as he saw Thor had a coffee machine and started it up.
He’ll be lying if that doesn’t shake him up a bit. What wars don’t? When the fire goes out and the ashes settle, there are only bodies to bag and bury.
Can’t hold on, can’t hold it in –
They walk up four flights of stairs to use the bathroom attached to the master bedroom, not for want of more space – every other bathroom in this mansion is large enough for the purpose. It’s Tony’s mission to minimise his carbon footprint on this good earth that restricts his activities these days to mostly, his bedroom and the workshop. Renewable energy is fine and dandy, but habits and lifestyles have to change, too. Maybe he’ll ask Steve to give a talk about “Reduce, Reuse and Recycle!” in the coming Expo. People will listen to Captain America even when he’s talking about carpooling or planting more trees.
“What’s the magic word?”
direction that is
“… No.”
“Tell me who’s top on the list.”
He eyes the array of candies by the cashier forlornly, knowing full well he can’t afford them, and bids Mr Tough Guy adios. And then, he walks past the aisle stocked up with freeze-dried coffee powder. Bags and bags of them.
“That won’t be necessary.” Because shooing Steve off makes him look like a prude. He can handle some nakedness – this is really nothing compared to teaching a boardroom of hairless apes to look past the speedbumps into the bigger picture. Seriously, what’s one or five casualties when they are looking at a potentially multibillion dollars business?
Ignoring him, Steve begins pulling at the knob, but Tony suddenly creeps up from behind and slams the door shut. He’s so close Steve can smell vodka and sweat evaporating off his skin. Sometimes, Steve wonders if Tony has a death wish of some sort, antagonising a super-soldier so viciously, pushing all the giant, red buttons on Steve without care. He manoeuvres Tony easily that
“I believe you.”
Little stack of hay that’s now reduced to cinders. Tony grabs a broken stick from a pile of garbage and scatters the remnants before they grow into a proper fire – when the stick too lights up where his fingers have closed around.
“Why are we stopping?”
The sky is turning darker already. They’ll soon be back on the road.
“… Very well.”
“No, you won’t.”
“Anaesthesia administered. Oxygen is up by five percent,” JARVIS intones.
“You lost it.”
Steve promptly turns on his heels and leaves, assured that Tony will follow. That’s another favour he’s done for Tony there, help him save some face in front of a dame. He would be fine with hauling Tony out of the Triskelion by his collars.
“Tony –”
“No,” Steve cuts in coolly. “Our plan is to get to New Jersey, find out what’s on that flash drive that got Nick killed, and use it expose the conspiracy within SHIELD. Not everything has to be solved with bullets, Tony.”
He looks away, downward – a brief air of annoyance crossing his face. He’s suddenly kicking at something else, something near the door that Tony can’t quite see. There are
“Where is it hurting?”
“I checked. The only cargo registered was a satellite strapped to a rocket, now in orbit. The hangar was empty.”
“No deal.”
that the lust isn’t infectious.
Steve barely moves an inch when Tony’s body camera fizzles out, and the grounds tremble with the force of the unprecedented detonation. An explosion that large wouldn’t leave survivors, but survivors there are still, because Clint’s voice, garbled as it is, is telling anyone who would listen to get the medic.
At the heat of the moment, as Steve stoops over him – now squeezing and tugging at the tip of his cock – he does the unthinkable. He’s a generous lover, what can he say? If Steve wants it, he can have it. The fun usually goes both ways, and he’s nice like that.
Steve is unsettled by every pixel on the monitor Tony is watching, every key on the keyboard Tony is tapping. This is too high risk. They have security on-guard northeast and traffic is a constant. Just because Tony is oblivious to the chatter and pitter patter of a small army by the hall’s main entrance doesn’t mean they’re safe.
Not game over, either.
, right? So, if you need to take out something quickly from a distance, say, an evil microwave from the opposite apartment, you can do just that from your sniper’s nest. And they’re safe to handle. They need to be launched from your bow and hit certain speeds before they’re triggered.”
Steve laughs, and draws a deep breath. He almost wants to cry. “Tony?”
on the side in the meantime.
. He hears every grunt, every gasp, but the force of Steve’s blows never weakens.
“Oh, you’re offering?”
He doesn’t know what’s happened to Steve, or the assassin, if one of them has died or not –
“Yeah, whatever.”
“Steve!”
How long have you made him stand outside, Jesus!”
Because, there is no
“Good God, please don’t…”
“Oh, come
“Nice.”
“Go, go, go!”
They’ve been cruising along the Turnpike for close to an hour half. Traffic is reasonably clear, and the autodrive function unique to this car is God-sent. Steve frees his hands and unbuckles his belt. “What,” he raises a brow at Tony, who’s still ogling at Steve like he’s grown wings. “We have a deal. Or are you gonna quit this?”
“You are not cleared to receive that information, Captain.”
fucking calm down!” More antiseptic spills between them than it gets onto Steve’s arm. “I would’ve… I could’ve
Steve averts his gaze and doesn’t reply. He pushes the gear into drive, and with a tone of finality, he says, “Regardless, Insight cannot go online.”
Five hours later, he attends debriefing with Rumlow. Fury has threatened the rest of the Avengers and STRIKE teams to stay put in medical, which is a huge favour on Steve’s part because
is it? Where’s the arc reactor?”
He’s eyeballing it. No way his shot will go wide, even a Stormtrooper can’t miss a ship that gigantic! But it’s tough. Kudos to SHIELD engineers and mechanics. He seethes as he watches the hull brushes off attacks like pelted eggs. “That does it. JARVIS? Please tell me you’re here, buddy. I’d like to run all the calculations myself, but I don’t have X-ray eyes, so I need you –”
“… That’s not quite right, too, Sir.”
“Is Tony with you? We have some pressing issues to comb over before we head for DC next Tuesday. I appreciate if you can tell me where he is.” Because, Steve is this close to driving down to the nearest police station and reporting a case of missing person.
This recollection triggers another bout of irritability and he wallops the punching bag some more.
“It’s not rhetoric. I’m asking you.”
“… I’m sending backup.”

Then Dum-E very kindly drops a thoroughly oiled rag onto Steve’s lap. Its pincers whirrs with excitement as Steve just sits there, doesn’t quite know what to do with it. Don’t underestimate that bot, it knows how to communicate though not nearly as eloquent as JARVIS. Dropping a dirty rag onto Steve’s lap can mean anything from you-stink-go-wash-up to oops-I-wasn’t-supposed-to-drop-that.
Steve weighs in the state of the Avengers. He either loses the Widow for possibly until year end – Nick Fury doesn’t dick around when he throws blackmails like that – or he loses her
innovation. A novelty concept that comes with several million dollars price tag, so good God, how much certainties are they expecting to work with?
The wood under him erupts in flames, and he’s falling, falling –
Who knows if the sex –
Tony lifts his arm from the bench’s back and folds it across his chest. “That’s why I’m here. You’re mighty useful, for a gramps.” Steve breaks a slight smile. “I said it once, I’ll say it again. You can do whatever you want to do. What makes you happy?”
“Tony, calm down.”
clamp down on his shoulder, coming there and then into Steve’s hand. Semen runs between his fingers, and swirls into the drain hole. Some splatter against the front of Steve’s shirt.
In the nick of time.
He admits, there’s no head or tail to his story. One moment, he was scheduled to meet Alexander Pierce for a chat about Fury’s assassination, by the next he’s fleeing the state in a borrowed car.
“It doesn’t work, OK?” Tony sighs, and runs his hand through his tussled hair. “There are tests done by the real experts. FBI profilers, police detectives, clinical psychologists, students. I only need to mine the available data and cook up a version two-point-oh, and I’m telling you, there’s no guarantee of predicting who would’ve done what. Profiling is just dressed-up astrology. Besides,” dried leaves crunch in his fist as it tightens, “even if they have such an algorithm, they still need the mechanism for target detection and identification. Unless you’re telling me their satellites can magically read people’s DNA from orbit, which I call bullshit –”
“I’m sorry, Tony. I’m sorry. This will hurt.”
One more thing. What Stark Industries does, how it operates and conducts its businesses is frankly, none of Steve’s concern. It disturbs him now that he knows how vehemently Tony is against the principles of Insight, yet indispensable in bringing it to fruition. Does Tony even know this?
Tony begins to unbuckle his seat belt. “I can cover you.”
, the speakers right above his head rattle with some form of static disturbances, before
“Breakfast on the go, then?”
The teasing from before hasn’t yet subsided. The knot in his core tightens despite Gary’s whining on the outside, and what must be a fleet of Agents trying their best to get inside.
Without tearing his glare from Steve, he prods at the man behind him with his elbow and coldly instructs him to leave. “I’ll pay you in full, don’t worry. And not a word about tonight.”
“SHIELD,” JARVIS helpfully supplies.
“… Are you challenging a direct order?”
“I got you, kid.” Tony grabs the hand of a five-year-old strapped to the passenger seat and pulls him into his chest.
Steve cares not – he manoeuvres Tony onto the bed again, patched-up back flat against the firm mattress. And he leans dangerously in, their noses almost touching and their breaths, almost one.
“Clint, status!”
prepared for him all right, so Tony grabs the pile of towels arranged beside his pillow. “Just the towels, Steve.”
Both Clint and Natasha look up and shake their heads in unison. Steve chews his breakfast slowly, and he turns around.
Silver lining is, it’s nice to know that he still owns the company. It’s not a deliberate arrangement, by the way. He fully expects the shares he owns to be transferred to five charity funds as stipulated in his will – only, he didn’t die, did he? But man, it
“Oh my God, you’re Steve Rogers – I mean, you’re like on CNBC, right now. Wow.”
That’s beside the point… but Tony obliges, and he folds his legs carefully under him. He can feel his sinews protesting.
Spit and bile sputters from his lips. He’s broken something. Positive. Breathing hurts.
Steve is still on his back, dead to the world. He doesn’t care that the Winter fucking Soldier is looming over him. One choke of Steve’s neck, one jerk – that’s all it takes.
Steve is gentler with him today. His large hands are as warm and kind as Tony remembers, and they linger by his neck and shoulders. “This here feels extra tense. Long day?”
? Twice, Steve! Let’s say by some magical means he’s brought back to live after
“No.”
“Goodman.”
Tony lays his bouquet before a tall, white gravestone cross.
“I can see the ingenuity in it just fine.” The door opens to admit them, and two other interns who seem pallid with starstruck. Sure, as long as they don’t ask him to sign their Converse.
Steve’s hooded eyes droop, and Tony knows it’s Steve-talk for this-isn’t-over. To him, it is. They deserve to savour this win. This
Steve unfolds his fingers and studies what he just caught – a slim, nondescript metal bracelet that’s cold to the touch. Must’ve been left in the open for some time. “What’s this?”
“Please!”
“Done, Captain?” Tony purrs, irritation unmistakably clear in his syllables. Steve lets his hand linger a second longer, his lips twisting into a sardonic smirk as the jumpsuit tents in between Tony’s legs.
“Pep, please. I know I had been such an idiot –”
“Maybe you’re one of the lucky 2.5%, Tony Stark.”
“Has it eaten at your Boy Scout conscience already? Sleepless nights, hmm? Maybe that’s why you’re so eager to answer Fury’s call. Keep the wet dreams at bay.”
When Steve hangs up and Tony has precious few seconds thereafter to fully process what he’d just said and done, he groans audibly and collapses butt first into the sofa again. Cradling his head in his palms and chanting
Gun. Mouth. Now.
The tablet Steve usually keeps on his person, tucked inside his sweater has slipped onto the tarmac. The motion sensor must’ve been triggered, the screen now alight. The time and today’s date is on display, as is the modified mugshot of Andrew Ilnyckyj.
“Pepper? It’s Steve.”
see coming.
! They’re standing in the heart of a military base camp meant to house an army of super-soldiers. The base of operation for Insight, if the venomous admissions from Zola’s tongue are truthful. There’s got to be failsafe in anticipation of airstrikes. “Admit it, it's better this way. We're both of us...out of time. The algorithm is completed. Insight is ready. All we need is a cause to launch it. A pity we both won’t be there to witness the rise of a new order. Hail HYDRA!”
They walk to the mahogany table that was once Tony’s for over a decade. He caresses the polished edge with his knuckle and promptly sits in the guest chair facing the executive’s. Boy, what a vista. Can’t believe he spent all those years working with his back
! The suit is already running on reserves!”
He shakes his head with equal enthusiasm.
“A first time for everything,” Steve smiles wanly. He closes the door with a curt click, and motions for Tony to get on the table. “Lie on your back, make yourself comfortable. I’ll ready the oils and lotions. Is the temperature and brightness comfortable?”
A line speeds across the screen, stark green against black. “What is it?” Steve asks, and watches it blink thrice before it disappears.
“What?”
“… Tell me this is the same drive some random Agent downloaded on a hidden mission you complained about. That drive.”
my own place. This is the Tower, isn’t it? Shit… I told him to send me home… can’t miss… name’s on the roof and all…”
Tony’s grip on his armrest tightens.
“Found them by the bin. They’re expired foodstuff.”
I’m putting you to bed.”
“For you, Sir.”
Still cosying up his comforter, JARVIS tells him.
But, he’s fucking trying, and he’s
Steve isn’t a man with many possessions. Everything he has can be fitted inside two large luggage, which he parks right beside the door of his bedroom. If he leaves the Avengers, he leaves the Tower. He promises not to suddenly drop off the surface of the Earth. This… career, these things that he does to uphold the Dream has been his purpose for being. He doesn’t need the Avengers to fight the fights. Fury says his living quarters in DC is still available. Hasn’t been touched since he left for New York.
