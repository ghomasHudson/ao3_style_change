“Yes it is,” replied Castiel solemnly. “Sex is a very big deal. It is important to most humans, and to you especially, Dean Winchester.”
“Who is it?” he asked, determined not to be derailed in the conversation. Not even for a prize as coveted as new information about his mom.
Dean and all the other whores working that party had quite literally been fucked into a bloody mess on the floor. They'd all languished beneath an unholy tangle of depraved men and women, all of whom had been caught up in the theatrics of the moment, and the handlers watching over them had been slow to realize the danger. Whenever he thought back to that event, Dean tried to keep in mind that he too had been slow to understand what had been happening to him. In the moment, he'd felt like a dog in heat, as though he'd never be satisfied no matter how roughly he was used. He'd screamed and begged for more until he was hoarse so there was no point in pretending he hadn't wanted the things that had been done to him. But, in hindsight it had been easier to see that he'd been pushed too far. Beyond his breaking point, he had not been rational. Not at all.
“Look man,” he said, calming down enough to ease back onto the bed. “I just want you to know that I ain’t some sweetie pie who got taken for a ride. I wasn’t used or abused. Well, not without my permission anyway. And as far as you and me? I fuckin’ like you, Ron. So get over your shit and just be my friend okay?”
Looking over at the bed and then back at Dean, Cas asks a question with the tilt of his head. 'You want it up there? Or on down here on the floor?'
The bad news? They’ve had to start rationing. The good news? Dean finally has a legitimate reason to visit his pack. He only has a few hours with them when he goes, but he and Cas make the most of their time together. His pack are now increasing their hunting rounds and donating the extra meat to the townsfolk. They've also added a few extra patrols to insure the safety of the humans who are now laboring around the clock to try and keep up. Sadly, no matter how hard they work, it's never quite enough.
“I’m not sure what that even means. C’mon Mildred, a burger at McDonalds isn’t gonna taste the same as one from Burger King. Yeah, some stuff tastes different here. Is that really what you’re asking?”
“Let’s just say that she was far wiser in the ways of the world than I was,” he says of her. Then, with a chuckle, he adds, “She gave me a crash course in human sexuality.”
“Soon,” his dad answers, ambling over to peer into the hamster cage. “I see your furry friends are resting comfortably.”
“Okay, first of all,” says Dean, losing his patience, “I’ll let you in on a goddam secret. There’s a reason why we shoot the damned mutts at twenty paces when we’re out huntin’, man, and it ain’t ‘cause they’re werewolves. When someone gets bit by one of them, ya know what happens? Fuckin’ nothin’. Nothin’ happens. They’re just mutated wolves. Are they bigger and stronger than the ones we grew up watchin’ on the nature channel? Hell yeah. But we hunt them down like they’re fuckin’ werewolves from some freakin’ horror movie. And we do that for one reason – ‘cause we were told to. They make it seem like these fuckin’ Wares are some kind of monster that we need a wall to protect us from, Gordon, but I don’t buy it. Not for a damned minute. That fuckin’ wall ain’t for keepin’ the Wares out… it’s for keepin’ us in.”
As he often does when they're finished these days, Cas dips his great head down to lap as the cream pie he's left behind. He doesn't stop until Dean is well cleaned up. Then, having finally exhausted their passions, the two curl up together under the stars again and Dean falls into a deep and dreamless sleep. When he wakes again, it’s to pain. His head is pounding and as consciousness returns, he begins to remember the night before… the wild fucking… the bite… and the awful thing he’d needed a distraction from in the first place.
He wasn’t surprised when the mechanic, Benny, told him it would be a few days for the repair. That was how Dean wound up renting a motel room in Pontiac, Illinois and paying by the week instead of by the night.
Exhaling a long breath, he immediately sucks in another hit, taking it deep and closing his eyes again as it works its magic on him. It settles his nerves, calms his chaotic mind, and helps him relax and enjoy things… like these little private moments with Claire.
“Yeah,” Bobby agreed, scratching the back of his neck, “Someone’s gotta look out for that miserable SOB.”
"Oh," said Dean, catching on to the underlying meaning behind Castiel's words. "You weren't asking me how many people I've fucked, you were asking me how many relationships I've had."
Dean turned to face Sam then, looking across the bench seat at him in the dark as the windshield wipers beat out a rhythm. Sam’s face was angry. Angry as Dean had ever seen him when he continued, “The only brother I’ve got, isn’t a brother at all. ‘Cause he’s too damn busy tryin to be my father.”
“Well, there’s someone out there for everyone,” she consoles, handing him the first completed joint.
Dean was surprised. Cas had seemed so unshakeable, so unfazed by the whole thing that Dean had assumed his friend was ready… much like Ash and Cole were. But allowing himself a closer look now, Dean realized that Cas was actually quite tense.
At home he took a slice of pie and his bottle to the couch. That couch was his buddy for the rest of the afternoon and into the evening. After going to the kitchen for his third slice of pie, Dean finally gave up on pretenses and carried the entire pie tin to the couch with him.
Belatedly, he also had to concede that his soul must be valuable even if he’d never thought so before tonight. Because if he was being promised riches and magic in exchange for parting with it, then it must be worth more than he’d ever imagined.
“She was willing to do that, Jack. She was willing to put her entire life on hold for you. Strangely enough, she was also willing to put her faith in me… to believe that when the time came, I’d keep my word… to trust me with her future, and yours.”
“Mermaids can’t shit,” Ash laughed. Another burst of raucous laughter swelled from the group in response.
“Boy oh boy,” she crooned as he sank down onto his stomach. “That juice really does the trick doesn’t it?”
“The injured have been transported to an empty cavern in The Grotto, and your parents are already there with him. If you’d like to see him, I can take you.”
“Um, an ambulance, I guess. I remember the night my mom died… the paramedics, man, they were amazing… even though they couldn’t save her. I think it would be awesome to ride out like that… sirens blaring… be one of those people who charges in and saves the day. That’d be the fuckin’ shit, Cas.”
Wordlessly, the man turned to him. Even now, in a fantasy of his own making, Dean was surprised by the intensity of those eyes. Deep and magnetic, they held his own with ease and wouldn’t allow him to look away as the man nodded in the affirmative. Watching as the guy climbed in, Dean suddenly realized that the dude was naked under his coat. Unable to control his wandering eye, Dean took in the man’s hairy legs and his milky white neck. Trying not to stare, he wondered if there was hair on that chest, even as the man cupped himself though the coat and slid closer to Dean.
“Dean, I think you know exactly who you are. I think you’d love to let that version of yourself behind the wheel for a while. And, if your father takes back the car he gave you, perhaps that’s just the universe telling you that it’s time you chose one for yourself instead of just accepting what’s been offered to you. Especially if accepting what’s offered means you have to fit into someone else’s idea of who you are.”
“I’ve never really thought much about having kids,” sighed Castiel. I’m not sure why. But maybe I just haven’t met the right person yet… the one that makes me stop and really consider it.”
“M’just sayin’, Cas, if I’d known you weren’t comin’ til after dark, I probably woulda done something constructive with the daylight hours… some laundry or somethin’.” Dean’s words are said lightly, but Cas can’t help but wonder if maybe there was an underlying implication. Perhaps his brother leaving had been difficult for him? Maybe he’d been a bit sad or lonely in the aftermath of a family visit? He wants to ask, but also doesn’t want to pry. Exercising caution, he simply says, “It was your brother visiting, right?”
“This place has a better pool,” Dean observed as he gracefully slid baby into a parking space by the leasing office. Aside from the pool, this place wasn’t much different than the first. But the rent was higher. No one needed to say out loud that they’d be crossing this place off the list of possible apartments for Dean as they dutifully took the tour.
“I think just the truck will do,” replies Dean, secretly hoping that no one would insist on accompanying him. The addition of a few extra hands really wasn’t worth the risk it carried, not considering that the injured men were currently in the company of eight Wares.  “But,” he adds, “I’m gonna need a stretcher to get them outta there. We got one?”
Because once again, his thick cock had given an exuberant leap when it heard the man’s authoritative declaration.
“She had political aspirations,” reminds Cas, “and everyone was urging her to give you up so that she could finish school and live her dream. But she wouldn’t even consider it. From the very beginning she wanted to keep you and raise you and she didn’t care what had to be sacrificed. So, I encouraged her to step back from school while she carried you and to stay home to raise you for a while until I was finished with school. My promise to her was that when I’d graduated, I would open an accounting service that could be run out of our home. I’d work from there and take over as your primary caregiver so that she could return to school.
“Might buy some time,” he sighed. “I mean, there’s a park a quarter mile down the road. These guys are gonna get found. Soon. But if we bury them, enough time might go by that no one will think about the car in connection with the bodies? I mean, at least that way when the cops come askin’ questions, there’s a small chance they won’t connect the dots?”
Craving the collective approval of his pack, Dean gives himself over to their alpha fully and lets the rest of the pack be part of it. His beast has a tongue made for sin and even if there were no others watching, it would be almost impossible not to whine pleadingly for more when his Ware laps at his entrance. Sadly, Dean rarely gets much of that before the creature is on him. Pressing a huge and swollen cock to Dean’s tender pink entrance, he doesn’t hesitate. He puts all his weight behind the motion when he pushes in and doesn’t bother pausing for Dean to catch his breath before he starts humping in earnest.
Bowing his body as he fought the urge to scream again, Dean rode the upward crescendo of pain because he knew with certainty that this man would give him what he wanted at the tipping point.
Castiel crawled in next to him and the two latched onto one another beneath the covers. Castiel rested his head on Dean’s shoulder and Dean wrapped his arm around the man’s neck so he could thread his fingers through the angel’s soft hair.
“Oh,” he nodded, “You’re saying that I take what’s easy ‘cause it fits in my life, but deep down I really want a challenge?”
Dean and Jimmy had taken a front row seat for the action and Dean hoped it wasn’t obvious how hard he was fighting the urge to get up on stage and sing. When the hour had grown late, and no one had done a decent rendition of anything in over an hour, Jimmy leaned in and said, “I’m in the mood for something sweet. Let’s go to your place and grab a slice of that pie.”
“Well, I’m not your mother,” she replied with her chin raised in defiance. “So, you can use my name like everyone else.”
“I suppose that seems logical,” he agreed, “but you’ve already become everything I ever hoped you would grow up to be.”
Silence descended on them after that. It was as if saying the word ‘carnvial’ had brought them back to the front gates, even though they were miles away.
Cas mentioned that he'd seen one figure ambling around near Crowley's tent, so before they embarked, they split up and cased the surrounding area which had encompassed the adults-only section of the carnival. As they cut between tents, they found two men. One was recognized by Castiel as a bartender from the saloon where girls waited for their johns. The other, Dean was stunned to see, was Alfie. The boy looked a bit different in freedom than he had in slavery. He didn't strut in his cut off denim shorts and tight t-shirt. In fact, he barely spoke. Immediately Dean's heart went out to him. He hoped that the boy wouldn't recognize him as a previous customer; not so much because he wanted to keep it secret, but more because he didn't want the boy to feel shame while being rescued.
Certain that he’s red-faced, Cas keeps his back to his son as he literally runs for the safety and solitude of his room. “Bumping uglies… horizontal mambo… where do you even come up with this stuff? I can’t even-”
Dean had to acknowledge that if he were like the other young mermen, this life would have one primary and undeniable benefit. Hot mermaids. Sadly, though, Dean’s access to the hottest maids in school wasn’t exactly a dream come true. He still wasn’t feeling even a hint of desire for any of them. In fact, it was a full time job just keeping up appearances with them. He had to flirt constantly – even with the ones he didn’t like. If he didn’t do that, they seemed to grow frustrated by his lack of eagerness. To keep up appearances, he rotated through a mental list of their names to make sure he remembered to flatter each girl at least once per cycle.
He heads straight to the bathroom to take a piss and then flops down on his bed. He’s still smiling. Even when he notices it, he can’t stop. And why is he trying? Being happy feels so damn good; he should let himself enjoy it.
In this strange and contemplative moment, he suddenly realizes that it’s the need he responds so readily too… that’s what he loves about a rough fuck. It’s primal. Straight forward and honest. Sometimes selfish, sometimes even painful. But it’s the conveyance of a need that demands to be sated and Dean fucking loves to be the one to have inspired such intense need and desire.
“No you’re not,” he teases gently, his mood turning around quickly now that it’s just the two of them.
Jack had been the one to tear up the old flooring but Cas had bought all the tools to do it. Between that and what he’d paid the boy for his labor, he’d wound up spending more than what it would’ve cost to just have the installers do it. But, helping his son learn responsibility while also giving him a chance to earn some extra money seemed like a worthy cause.
Looking over at him incredulously, Dean says, “Wait. Are you tellin’ me you’ve got a fuckin’ toy up your ass right now?”
Dean grinned and set to work on shucking his pants down. It was almost comical watching Benny decide whether or not he was going to look at Dean’s cock. After a brief deliberation, he did. However, the man didn’t comment on it. He simply resumed kissing Dean. As the man switched from deep, wet kisses to small pecks to the side of Dean’s face, he whispered, “Is this okay?”
Decline the invitation explaining that he now realizes that he’s too interested in Cas to willingly share him with another  (go to chapter 18).
“Yeah, Sammy, just let me know if something doesn’t seem right – even if it’s just a weird feelin’, okay?”
Cas loved that Dean had started out with a real one too… no test swats… no love pats. This was an honest-to-god spanking that would’ve stung badly if it had been skin to skin.
Benny had abandoned the couch and followed them to the kitchen. He was just in time to watch Jimmy take a knife from Dean and sink it into the pie tin. “Lemon ricotta?” questioned Benny tentatively, “I’ve never even heard of that.”
Recently, thoughts of doing a man have been insistent enough that he’s brought up Cas Kline in his contacts a few times. Dean knowsthat if he called the man, they’d have a great night. But, he is hesitant to actually get in touch. It just wasn’t appropriate. He suspects the man would be receptive, but how to extend an invitation? Mr. Kline is a parent. Asking him out would be grossly inappropriate and asking him for a one-nighter would be even worse.
They filed through the opening one at a time and as Dean looked around, he saw that not much had changed over the years. It looked a bit smaller now than it had back then. But, the same thing was happening. Girls were showing off, exposing bits of themselves to entice and waiting for someone to make a reasonable offer. The prettiest girl in the room was dancing on the bar. She lifted her skirt each time a man approached and gave them a tiny peek at her pink satin panties before bending down to whisper her price in their ear. The conversation between his old friends faded into the background as Dean zeroed in on her. There was something very familiar about this girl and he didn’t even realize he’d been moving closer until she artfully pulled back the layers of her skirt to give him a glimpse of the goods. When she bent down and whispered, “It’s an even hundred for the works,” Dean recognized the sound of her voice. He saw her do a double-take when she, in turn, remembered him too. Before he could even consider how much she probably didn’t want to be recognized, he blurted out, “Jo? Jo Harvelle?”
Hammering the bag with no protection on his hands soon had his knuckles stinging. A dull ache was working its way up his wrist when he finally found the ability to stop for a second. He opened his locker and changed into workout clothes, grabbed a drink, and pulled gloves on. Then, with purposeful strides, he crossed the room and resumed throwing punches.
His mood improving now, Dean walked with her to the cafeteria. It was a long walk, probably part of the design layout; best to keep the scent of food far away from those who can’t eat, right? The staff took all their meals here, but the escorts only ate on resting days so staff outnumbered the escorts in the cafeteria nearly three to one.
"That all sounds perfect Sam," praised Jim. "Do you plan to use one of the rooms as a nursery for the babies and toddlers then?"
“Thanks for the ride,” whispered the stranger, breaking his silence for the first time as he pulled Dean’s hand down into his lap.
Dean was too groggy to think of a decent come-back. He settled for an eye roll as he dug into his food.
There was a moment of anticipation, just a split second, before the weight of it would come crashing down on him and steal the breath from his lungs. The feeling was familiar. He’d experienced the same thing every time he took a tooth rattling blow to the jaw, or heard the snap of breaking bone. With injuries like that, there was always a fraction of a second before his body could process the agony. It’s never been more than just the space between a few heartbeats, but it always terrifies him as it’s happening because there’s no way of knowing just
Dean was surprised by the sound of his own voice, coming out high pitched and boyish. Before there was any time to adjust to the sheer size of this man’s cock, it was pulling back out of him. “Tight like a pussy should be,” mumbled the man as he clamped his hands down on Dean’s hips. “You wanted to be split open,” he reminded Dean, “so, you can scream all you like, but I ain’t holdin’ back for you.”
“Then tell them to fuck off,” barked Sam, looking at Dean with challenging eyes. “What kind of dude just shits on his friends to move up?”
Once his arms were free of the robe, his cuffs were linked to the lead. He was then guided out of the medical facility and back to the residential section. Finally, it was time to check out of the facility. Even on good days, the process could be time consuming. But this time it was a pain in the ass, mostly because of the timing. Normally, leaving the compound is something one does when it’s a required resting day or pre-requested time off. The process begins with waking and a trip to the salon. Usually, he’s anxious to eat so he does that as well. Enduring diaper changes is part of that process but as far as Dean’s concerned, it’s better to get that over with here than to try and deal with it out in the real world. After all of that, exiting the compound generally consisted of signing some papers at the main desk while being reminded of the do’s and don’ts. There was also a standard search conducted to be sure that nothing unapproved was being removed from the grounds.
“It’s not that you need a diaper. You’re not a child. Some incontinence is an unfortunate side effect of the juice. It generally only lasts a few hours, a day at the most, but that’s long enough to merit a containment pad. You want to eat, don’t you?”
“The wall, man,” he replies with an eye roll. “You’d never make it back over the wall before they got you.”
His face is red, as it has been since he’d been asked about his favorite sex position, and his lips are stretched into a thin line as though he’s trying to keep from laughing. Then, from the mouthy group at the back of the room, a crass joke is loudly made and Jack sees Mr. Winchester’s eyes snap to them. He grabs the whistle that always hangs around his neck and gives two short blasts. Everyone quiets down immediately.
Turning towards the exit, they both hold up a hand to Garth in farewell and then push through the door. Crossing the lot, Jack wants to thaw the coldness that had sprung up during their exchange about the farmers’ market. So, when he veers away and walks around the car to the passenger side, he thumps his dad on the arm and gives him a hopeful smile. That’s all it takes. His father’s answering smile is reassurance that the two of them are fine. By the time they’re pulling out onto the street, he’s asking Jack where they should eat dinner.
“That’s what I’m tryin’ to figure out,” his friend said meekly. “I shoulda thought to grab their phones,” he lamented.
“The last of your father was in that house,” sighs Mary, naming the ghost that haunts Dean here. “All I’ve got now is a few old pictures.”
“Yeah, well, you’ve hijacked my angel before too,” spat Dean. Even as he was speaking, the sound of Sam’s voice reached his ears.
In response to her infectious grin, Jack can’t help but laugh. “Sure. We’ll put my dad on Tinder and see how that goes.”
First, no one’s face was ever shown. The subject of the video, usually restrained, was shown only from the neck down. The doctor, shown minimally, seemed to wear a black hood. There were only a few glimpses of it, but it seemed likely that it was worn for those accidental moments when his head might bob into the frame by accident. Yep. Dr. Cum Control was VERY protective of his identity. No wonder he’d been incensed at the idea that his brother may have told someone of his hobby.
Dean smiles as the bar tender approaches, ordering his usual as he hands the man his card. Turning his attention back to his friend, he asks, “Whatcha drinkin’?”
“I mean, if you are, it’s nothing to be ashamed of. It’s not like I’ve never been there. I’ve had it. I’ve had it bad.”
With hugs and a final 'Merry Christmas', he bids them all goodnight and heads for bed with Cas at his side. Despite the lingering heaviness that comes from having indulged in a holiday meal, Dean locks the door to their room. As if knowing what that clicking sound means, Cas looks over at Dean as if seeking to confirm his intentions.
The commanding tone in which those harsh words were spoken went straight to Dean’s dick and it had given a mighty leap in response. In fact, he felt the power of this man’s presence all the way to his knees, which were suddenly weak and jittery. This was going to be so good. Keeping the man in his sight, Dean continued playing cat and mouse with him, opting for a cocky attitude and flirtatious demeanor. He’d have some fun with this… be sarcastic and throw out some funny one liners… basically, he’d just be himself. He wouldn’t make it too easy, but slowly losing to this man would be incredible foreplay, and when he’d finally been beaten, Dean would gladly sink into the role of defeated adversary. He’d beg and plead for mercy as he secretly enjoyed whatever depraved penance was bestowed upon him for the transgression of challenging the irrefutable Lord who would then rule over him. Losing slowly to this man was going to be So. Much. Fun.
When he spark finally catches, she inhales deeply to get the joint burning. Then, she blows on it to disperse the ashen remains of it’s tip and leave behind a perfect, smouldering cherry. He smiles as he watches her hit it for real this time. She holds it for a moment, closing her eyes to savor, and then passes it to him as a coughing fit sets in. By the time he’s hit it and passed it back, she’s recovered.
The car wheezed to life and a squeaky belt protested. But, after a minute, it settled into an even hum. It was cold outside but after hours in the warm, stagnant air of a dive bar, the crisp breeze felt incredible. Dean set his mind on rolling down the window, but it proved to be a challenge. Old and stiff, it would’ve been a challenge for him sober. Drunk off his ass? He had his work cut out for him. Then, just as he was winning the war and savoring his cool and refreshing reward, the car came to a stop and Ron cut the engine.
The expression on this strangers face seems to simultaneously show intrigue and regret, arousal and sorrow, excitement and shame. Perhaps he was seeing something the others didn’t. Maybe he had looked beyond Dean’s cocky preening and flirtatious smiles. It was possible that this man suspected that Dean behaved this way for a reason… because he’d been broken. It was impossible to decide if he liked the man’s vigilant stare or hated it.
Dean was so horny at this moment that even sucking on a bottle felt sensual to him. He couldn’t wait to get a dick in his mouth. “I’m a whore,” he mumbled between swallows, “and I ain’t afraid to say so.”
“Well, funny you mention starting new things. I’ve been putting down some stuff of my own. Honestly, I don’t do much for designing. I can recreate almost anything, but originals really aren’t my thing. Usually. But I did start something the other day, and I like what I’ve got so far.”
“Yeah, yeah. Okay kid,” relented the man behind the window, “here’s your thirty bucks. I wasn’t tryin to rip you off. It was an honest mistake.”
“Pretty good, I guess. I took some time off. Met somebody and I’m thinking about throwing in the towel.”
Dean nods, grabs the recommended outerwear and calls a goodbye to Bobby over his shoulder as he heads out into the storm with Gordon on his heels. Dean slips on the very first step, the glaze of ice under his feet damp from the snowfall and slippery as snot. “Damn,” he curses, catching himself before going down. He takes the remainder of the trip much more slowly, Gordon falling in alongside him as they walk down the middle of the street. They make small talk all the way to Gordons place and for Dean it’s excruciating. To further irritate him, he hears the call of his pack in the distance. Twenty minutes ago, that would’ve brightened his day considerably. Maybe he would’ve even found some way to slip out and meet them. But not now. Now he’s condemned to spending time with Gordon instead, doing god-knows-what ridiculous chore.
It was hard, so very hard, to be patient and wait for his brother to process what he’d been told and respond. But, he bit his tongue and did it. Dean didn’t speak again until Sam did.
By the time Jim returned from his service, looking exhausted beyond words, they'd managed to make order from the chaos. The walls now boasted bright yellow pieces of copy paper which were taped up every ten feet or so. Each had a name on it indicating the personal space of one refugee. Each person had been provided something to sleep on and most had taken the time to settle into their space. Some were on mats with sleeping bags, others had single size air mattresses and blankets. Each had pillows and the necessary bedding too. Sam had now slid open the wide windows that separated the kitchen from the rest of the space and a line of people were shuffling forward to pick up a plate of doughnuts, a Styrofoam cup of milk, and a piece of fresh fruit. Jim seemed quite impressed. He begged off for a few minutes to change his clothes and Dean turned his attention back to the work at hand.
Immediately, Dean filled with disappointment. He’d been so careful because he knew that this would probably happen. But, still, he’d thought things were going well. Unable to look his friend in the face, Dean busied himself with returning to a normal sitting position as he waited for Benny to finish articulating some kindly worded version of ‘thanks but no thanks’. But, again, Benny surprised him. Managing to finish his thought through heavy breathing, Benny said, “I can’t. I can’t repay this.”
“We made it,” he announced. As they approached, Dean saw Crowley perched on top. He was wearing a proud grin as a mermaid swam in gentle circles around him. Dean had seen the maid before, but didn’t know her name.
To Dean’s surprise, a delightful shiver snakes up his spine. He snuggles into Castiel, pressing a kiss to his temple and they lay tangled for a moment, Cas still asleep and Dean processing a long forgotten sensation. It begins almost like a pin-prick and then it grows, starting in his groin and then radiating outward until the physical embodiment of it presents itself. Yep, there it is, right between his legs… the unexpected sensation of a hardening dick. He’s not felt this in years. Well, not without the thrill of an audience, the enticement of multiple partners, and the promise both pain and humiliation.
“I can see that now. If I hadn’t made a deal with Crowley, I still could’ve still done most of what I wanted to do. It wouldn’t have been easy, but I could’ve done it. Ya know? I could’ve studied hard and gotten a scholarship. Maybe not to Stanford, but to a decent school. I still could’ve been a lawyer. And if I’d done it on my own, I would’ve had my whole life to enjoy it. But instead, I took the easy way. And now, I’m going to die.”
However, as he fumbled through yet another opening, Dean found it difficult to adjust to his surroundings. He felt as though he was stuck in an episode of The Twilight Zone – where each door he passes through brings him farther from reality as he knows it. The three of them seem to be sinking deeper into trouble with each threshold they cross.
Dean didn’t like the idea of following anybody anywhere. But, with no viable argument to make, he had to nod agreement and allow Donna to take the lead position. The drive across South Dakota was dull, its landscape flat and uninteresting and broken up only by the vague differences between crops. Plots of farmland flicked by outside Dean’s window - corn, wheat, and soybeans in endless rotation. Still, somehow Castiel managed to spend most of the ride looking out his window as though it was all mesmerizing. Perhaps he was deep in thought.
The head of his cock was now glazed with pre-cum where it rested on the glass barrier, and behind him, his eager entrance was sopping wet. Extra tight back there after a few days rest, Dean was thrilled to have such a delectable partner be the one designated to violate it.
Then, once more feeling like an upstanding citizen, Castiel walks into the house. He doesn’t have much time before curfew so he makes a bee line for his bedroom with the intention of getting off before his son gets home. Locking the door to his room, he puts on some music and wastes no time digging into the locked, fireproof safe under his bed. To anyone else, this portable safe probably appears to contain important papers like a copy of his mortgage, his life insurance policy, and other such things. But no. Inside are his sex toys, lube, and a box of condoms that’s likely past it’s expiration. Purchased at a weak moment when he’d been considering a hookup, they’d been rotting here since. Pushing past them, he selects the smallest vibrator because there’s no time for prep. But, there’s also no way he’s going to let this night end without feeling something hard between his cheeks.
Cas, still smashed against the door, used his weight to leverage himself and push back against Dean. He felt so lustful as he thrust his ass backwards, practically daring the man to do something nasty with him.
“I’ll text you.” Cas smiled as he took hold of the stroller handle and navigated his niece away from her parents.
The feeling of being stretched over purposeful fingers stirred excitement in him and made him eager to do dirty things. There was a swirling sensation in his belly and a buzzing, tingling feeling from the waist down that seemed to rev up like an engine every time Cas’ finger touched certain places inside of him. Then, when the moment of penetration came, it was overwhelming. The act itself was lewd and carnal. Salacious. A fat cock, pushing into him, spreading him wide open, stretching his hole to its limits and violating him in the most delicious way. But, under the thrill of that, the act was also tender and sweet. It was, he realized, the complete giving over of himself to Cas. Warmth bloomed in his chest as he thought of how fitting it was to give this to Castiel and he wanted the man to know what it meant to him.
After a period of learning and working at one location, like the Boneyard, the school would move on to another location. If the rumor was true… Dean’s current excitement would be doubled because not only was he about to be a big brother, but their school would also be going to a new place. And, if that new location proved to be The Crevice? This wake cycle would be thrilling indeed.
“You know it,” he assured her with a wolfish smile. “Send me all your little pretty things… I’ll take real good care of ‘em.”
“Yeah, I’d say,” grumbled Bobby. “You were supposed to be on a half hour ago. Rufus hasn’t noticed yet, or at least, he hadn’t when I left. Now get your ass movin’.”
As if that wasn’t enticing enough, Mr. Winchester then starts backing up and bends to press his ass to the window pane. Milky white cheeks spread flat and smooth against the glass and sitting dead center is a perfect black circle.
“I know,” she whispers. “I don’t think you’ll miss your dad half as much as you think you will. But me? You’ll miss me twice as much.”
When his friend was off the phone, Dean looked back over at him. “That should keep ‘em from callin’ to have it towed,” he affirmed. “For now at least.”
“That girl? No way. That one’s gonna be in a cage before the week is out. I call ‘em like I see ‘em.”
The white noise of the road under his tires had a sedating effect on him while the feeling of perpetual motion soothed his nerves. The overall effect was probably reminiscent of how a small child feels while being rocked in their mother’s arms. When he played music, it was always chosen to suit his specific mood, and the combination of all these things lent him a feeling of being in control, even when he really wasn’t.
“Beat it kid,” he growled. But, beneath the bravado, Dean saw the guy waiver. It was just a fleeting moment, but he’d seen the brief hesitation as the man realized that he’d not really been paying attention.
“Dude, chill,” he tells her, wondering what the big deal is. She dismisses him easily and then gets up from the table a beat before the bell rings and heads off down the hall.
“Dunno,” he shrugged, “everything I just said, I guess. I’m not the brainiac of the family. That’s my little brother. I hated school. Spent most of my classes smokin’ in the boys’ room.”
He’d been hoping for more, and ‘more’ was exactly what he was given. Darkeyes brought Dean to the very edge, dishing out complex patterns of swats to the quivering globes of his ass and the wet crack between them, before finally striking his impatient hole again.
Their dinner at The Mill had been eaten by candlelight. The soft, warm light had highlighted the man’s complexion and brought out the magnetic quality of his deep blue eyes. And now, looking at these pictures, he takes in the man’s face. A striking jaw line, often darkened with five o’clock shadow, and high cheekbones that are perfectly accented with a dramatic, sweeping brow. The fact that his hair often appears mussed only works in his favor, seemingly softening his look. He needs that, apparently, because he rarely smiles. Well, he smiled a lot at dinner, but these pictures have been taken with their subject unaware and busy with other things.
When he got home from the bar that night, Dean settled in at his computer and googled Dr. Cum Control. He did a lot of scanning, sorting, clicking and then hitting the back button. He learned a lot about BDSM in general, edging and its various embodiments, and he even found Cas’s dedicated website. It was very professionally done considering that Cas had likely set it up himself. There were dozens and dozens of videos to watch, an FAQ page, and even a submission box for people who wanted to be in a video.
In his mothers community, no one is left out. Each adult contributes within their own skillset and to the best of their abilities. Those who can hunt do the hunting. Those who can cut wood, well, they do so. Everyone has something they can do to help out, even the lady who can't walk. She sits all day sewing... mending the torn and frayed. Nobody goes hungry and nobody freezes to death. Everyone helps in their own way and everyone receives the same access to the necessities of life. To Dean it's almost exactly like pack life and he really likes it.
Dean heads for his classroom, walking as fast as he can without actually breaking into a run. The warning bell has rung and the hall is empty with the exception of two stragglers who run past him, the soles of their shoes squeaking as they turn the corner. Just like Dean, they’re trying to get to their next class by the time the final bell rings.
Begrudgingly, the two of them get to their feet and finish walking home. Upon arriving, they waste no time getting to their mattress by the fireplace. Flopping down onto it, they promptly sink into a proper reunion. The wolves that surround them join in celebratory debauchery, instigating a pack-wide orgy that rivals even those of mating season. The sun has risen before Dean and Cas are finally satiated, and Dean dozes off for a few hours of well-deserved rest before leaving the cocoon of their love nest.
The Christmas celebration that year was one of the better Dean could remember in recent years and a day of electronic entertainment had been tremendous fun. Watching Sammy’s eyes light up as he ripped the wrapping paper off of his presents had made Dean ridiculously happy.
“Well,” he replied, taking Cas’ empty drink cup as he handed him the new one, “like you said, it was an asshole thing to do.”
Dean nodded agreement and tried to keep his eyes from dropping down to look at the boys lips. He failed. He was watching when the flash of a pink tongue darted out and wet those lips. Snapping his eyes back up, he found Cas leaning towards him a little.
Yeah, he was definitely infatuated with Cas. How could he not be? The guy was handsome and funny, smart and driven. He had a dream, and he was working toward it singlemindedly. It was admirable. Again, Dean found himself feeling disheartened about his chances. Even if they didn’t live on opposite sides of the country… what would Cas want with a guy like him? Yeah he was hot. He knew that or it wouldn’t be so easy to hook up. He was good in the sack, and that’s not a small checkmark on the plus side of the column. But other than his looks and his skills in bed… what does he really have to offer?
He was only a heartbeat away from a climax when the man suddenly pulled his cock all the way out and painted Dean’s backside with his cum. It was always hot to have someone shoot it on him like that – to feel it splatter on his overheated skin and dribble sloppily around his hole. He smiled as it happened too, picturing what he must look like. He even twisted around to try and catch a glimpse, then locked eyes with the man as he released his own swollen dick in favor of dragging a finger through the man’s spend, spreading it around a little and eventually bringing his finger to his tongue for a small taste. But, despite his award winning act, he was left disappointed. He hadn’t even come.
There were no vehicles in either direction when Dean got back into his Impala and drove away. By the time he was parking at the motel again, the first colors of dawn were streaking the edge of the sky to the east.
“Dean?” his friend pleaded in a whisper. “Dean? Please? Turn around get out of here while you still can. If you go up against Crowley you will lose.”
Singer, his PI, begins narrating as Dean looks through the clear, glossy images that were obviously taken with a vintage 35mm camera and developed in a private dark room. Most are of Jack’s dad. As Singer explains the significance of the shots he’s chosen to include in this bundle, Dean is only half listening. His eyes rove over the man centered in each photo and all he can think is
Positioned as he was in that moment, literally on his hands and knees, the press of a single paw began forcing his upper body down. With his knees still under him, the result was him being folded into the shape of a tripod with his ass sticking up in the air. Oddly enough, it felt right to him. As if some dormant part of him had suddenly awakened, Deans fight-or-flight adrenaline suddenly switched over to fuel a different reflex... one he'd never known he had before. Out of nowhere Dean was blindsided by a primal urge so deep and dark that he had no name for it.
Jack immediately feels empathy for his father but just can't bear to let the subject drop without asking one more question. “If you wont tell me who,” he ventures, “will you at least explain to your son, the future psychology student, why you’re so happy if you know that your love is unrequited?”
“I have a contract right here,” said Crowley, reaching inside his lapel, “You can read it over if you’d like, but it’s simple. Straight-forward. In exchange for your soul, I will give you everything you ever wanted from life… and ten years to enjoy it.”
With the preliminaries out of the way, he’s ready to get started. “You go first,” he says, eager to see which package the young man will choose. He watches like a hawk as a hovering hand teases back and forth between two packages, trying to decide which to open.
“Yeah,” he grins, not even having to lie when he says, “Any excuse to get this ol’ girl outta the garage makes for a damned good day.” Then, because he knows he needs to play it cool, he adds, “Where’s Gordon?”
“Heya Dean,” smiled Donna, walking up and dropping one last bag into the trunk before closing it. “Ready to get on the road?”
“So… Channing… is she, I mean, are you guys…” Dean was flustered now and felt himself blushing fiercely as he bumbled around trying to articulate the question that hovered forefront in his mind.
“You may speak now,” said a vaguely familiar voice from five worlds away. It was his dark-eyed Dom. Technically, the man was his customer. But in this moment, a coin toss would be required to determine which of them had served the other… at least, that’s how it seemed to Dean. He was exponentially grateful to have such an acute need be so adequately met.
“I get it,” Dean says gruffly, stepping closer to his mate. “It sucks takin’ a loss. Especially with an audience. But that’s what’s gonna happen next.” As though challenging Dean’s sincerity in the moment, the dark wolf steps around Dean. He puts his own body between Dean and The Hulk and then issues a low growl to signal his challenger that the fight is back on.
“I’ve never seen anything like it,” she breathes, surveying the carnage. “I mean, we know that the Wares are territorial and occasionally fight over boundaries, but I’ve never seen anything like this.” Both he and Sam come to a stop, framing her on either side as she takes it all in. As her gaze roves over the open area, Dean sees what she hasn't yet - his pack. They're converged in the shade nearby. Most of them are laying down, panting and obviously exhausted. The injured are licking their wounds and Dean wants to head over there and assist as his Alpha and the higher ranking wolves as they try to care for the pack.
When the finale finally came, a hailstorm of expertly targeted thrashes to the very center of his most vulnerable place, Dean did scream. He screamed loud and long, every cell in his body on fire as his hips wriggled in vein and his puckered entrance exploded violently. Jerking and twisting in his straps, Dean wept like a child as he succumbed to the power of this masterful Dom.
Gabe followed Kali’s suggestion to take her to a show. The line was long, but once the doors opened, everyone was able to move into the theater quickly. It was cool and dark inside and Gabby was immediately spellbound by the talking animatronic moose and deer heads. From there it was a snap. She curled up on Cas’ chest and giggled, loudly at first and then quieter. Much like Cas had done poolside today, Gabby faded in and out of restful sleep during the show.
Dean woke abruptly, muscle memory bringing his body up from a prone position and onto all fours before his eyes were even all the way open. This was the norm for him and had been for quite some time. Long ago, waking would have found him with one hand under his pillow, the familiar grip of his pistol in his palm.  Back in those days he’d awakened tense for different reasons. These days, when he jolted from sleep it was with a shudder of pleasure, not fear. The initial sensation of pleasure that had roused him was now subsiding and he arched his back to enjoy the tingling aftershocks that followed. As they rolled over him, his eyes drifted closed again and he pushed his knees further apart on his comfortable mattress. Humming contentedly, Dean began to rock on his hands and knees as a sensual feeling built in his groin and slowly crept out over the rest of his body. Deep in his gut was a curl of anticipation and his body was practically humming with it.
“What happens next?” Dean asked, barely able to control his fear. He was very unprepared for this. He’d wasted his entire night thinking of Castiel and could see now that he should’ve been mentally preparing for this. He’d not even thought about how to handle the mating – at all.
Feeling powerful as she bent to his will, Dean ran his heated crown down into the hole where her juicy wetness gathered, pushing the head of his dick up inside to get it slicked up. Then he dragged that wetness up to her nervous little rosebud. Over and over he did that, enjoying the sensation and aching to push in somewhere tighter. He waited though, keeping his eyes mostly on the husband as he worked her into a frenzy.
It didn’t take long to find the gazebo he was looking for. The early evening sun was sinking fast and arcs of soft light were dancing over the water and filtering through the lattice of the gazebo. Jess looked like a real-life princess in her dress, and Cas walked straight to the happy couple to congratulate them. Dean snuck up behind him as they were speaking and snaked an arm around his waist, lips pressing to the side of his neck in a quick peck. They stood together as Jess and Sam told Cas about the wedding and thanked him for coming. He laughed as he apologized for his attire… his t-shirt and shorts looking far too casual next to the wedding party in their tuxes and silky gowns.
“Okay,” relented Sam. “I guess I did have an ulterior motive for coming. But, before I get into that, can we just do something together? Just you and me?”
“Dean, as you’ve so brazenly pointed out, I have paid thousands of dollars for this time that we’re spending together. You are
As they slipped into the tunnel, the decorated walls came to life, huge screens lighting up with cartoon characters… the three Caballeros. Their boat wound around corners as screen after screen danced with animations.
“Whatever,” Dean replied, tipping back the last of his drink. He thumped his glass down heavily, letting the sound catch the eye of the bartender. He didn’t look at the man as his next drink was poured for him because a heavy feeling of depression was settling over him. But then, Dean suddenly remembered the way Castiel had kissed his tummy at the club. In light of that memory, ‘the one with the tummy’ didn’t seem quite so insulting. In fact, his entire body was now warming as he thought of their interactions that night and of how much he’d enjoyed being the center of Cas’s attention.
“Fair point,” she agrees, tossing her hair over her shoulder and adjusting the strap of her backpack.
Cas is stunned, his mouth agape. He manages a nod, snapping his mouth shut to hold back the flood of questions that are gathering there.
“He’s gonna lose a leg,” Dean says solemnly. “And he’s enough of a bastard already. Don’t wanna give him any excuse to get rougher around the edges.”
“Don’t tell me you’re into it,” laughed Jimmy, pulling his leg up onto the bed as he swiveled to look at Dean in the dark.
Bobby didn’t seem to change anything. Being near him, hearing his voice, it was a jolt. So was the realization that the real Cas, his Cas, was here now. It must’ve been the doppelganger of Castiel that they’d burned and mourned. This was
“Not really… I have more problems as Mickey. You know the other day, some woman brought her toddler to sit on my lap and then slipped me her room key?”
Then, buttressing one shoulder under Benny at his core, Dean hefted the man up. With most of the weight spread over his back, Dean was able to stagger into the room. But, with his initial burst of adrenaline from the crime scene used up, Dean was losing his strength fast and he was barely able to support the Benny’s weight all the way to the bed. Once he was next to it, Dean abandoned any hope of setting the man down gently and just settled for not letting himself wind up trapped beneath him.
“But,” the man added, still pacing, “there’s a substantial history of soul selling. There have been more tales of it than we can count… quite a few testimonials… some surprisingly candid admissions…”
A few feet away, Benny averted his eyes and tried again. “Man, I just… some nights I just need… I need my sweetheart, Dean. I need her.”
“Now, as the cycle nears its natural climax, many maidens become willing to allow more than one mate at a time. There’s nothing wrong with this, if it’s done correctly. However, if it’s done incorrectly then we wind up wasting valuable chances at conception. So, it’s time for you boys to have a lesson in anatomy.”
As it turns out, though, Dean’s got a lot to learn about being friends. He’s been out of Castiels presence for less than a week when he begins to grow frustrated. He wants to see Cas again, but has no idea how to make that happen.  He’s got the man’s number, but what to do with it? He could call and see if Cas wants to grab drinks, but that’s asking him out on a date.
Dean stood watching for a beat as Sam turned Cas away from him and the two began walking together. He stalked along, a few paces behind them, listening to bits and pieces of their conversation. He was more irritated than he had reason to be. Clearly this kid wasn’t after their money. He had no reason to be so defensive. Besides, Sam didn’t have many friends. Who was Dean to begrudge the kid a change to make one.
“No Dean, I don’t. But these are the kinds of things that I would do… if I had friends to do them with.”
Dean was speechless. He’d be a liar if he didn’t admit more than passive interest in the offer. But something about being asked for his soul opened up a can of worms that he’d never imagined having to deal with. Not to mention that some amendments might be necessary. After all, John was a colossal bag of dicks. But did Dean really want him dead? No. He’d buried one parent. That was enough.
A heartbeat later, Dean absorbed the hard shove as Cas pushed away from him and thrust out of their hiding place. Knowing it was time, Dean pushed himself forward and out into the open. Cas was already halfway to base. There was a flurry of activity as everyone raced for safety. Dean didn’t see Sammy until his brother was right behind him. He pushed himself faster, knowing he could easily outrun his brother. He thumped safely onto base next to Cas who turned to give him a reach-n-slap for having made it safely.
Dean, knowing deep down that he was territory being claimed, had closed his eyes to accept it. For the other wolves he’d tolerated the action. But for the wolf who’d mounted him, he’d embraced it. Dean  hadn’t even noticed his mouth falling open in ecstasy until he’d felt hot liquid spraying into it. Dropping his chin so that his head was in a more humble and accepting position, Dean had then swallowed a small taste of the stuff. Honestly, it wasn’t that bad.
“I’m Jess,” said the sweet-faced blonde as she took the marker from between his teeth. “You must be Cas?”
Pulling a u-turn, Dean pointed his headlights back towards the city limits. A moment later Benny’s voice flooded the airwaves again, laughing as he called out a code three. “That means you sleeping beauty,” he barked at Dean.
When he reaches the window, he peers outside. Scanning the neighboring houses, he sees nothing unusual. There’s certainly no one gazing out their window and into his. Given that he doesn’t have an audience of any kind, Dean goes ahead and takes another long look at himself. Turning to the side, he drinks in the shape of his body in profile, especially the protrusion from behind him. Gripping it with one hand, he watches himself pull it back and then push it back in, his back bending beautifully as his perfectly rounded ass hungrily takes in a shiny black cock.
“What ever happened to the ‘open campus’ for seniors?” he grumbles in response, thinking of how McDonald’s is within easy walking distance.
“Don’t over think it Dean,” prompted Crowley. “Say yes before I lose my patience. Otherwise, I might be inclined to bring your father in here and make him watch the first time I fuck you.”
Each resting cycle, Dean would swim back to his cavern. He’d eat a meal with his family and note his mother’s belly, which seemed to swell bigger with each cycle. Between the meal and sleep, there was free time and, most often, Dean’s free time was spent playing with his friends.
This time, he could faintly hear his brother’s response. Moving quickly over the hard floor, keeping his gun out in front of him, Dean headed out into the hall. Casting a glance in each direction, he confirmed it to be free of danger before turning to face the direction of Sam’s room. The lights were flashing in synchronization and the strobe effect made Sam’s movements appear jerky and robotic as he emerged from the darkness and closed the distance between them.
Holding his toy in with one hand, he wrapped the other around his cock and continued rhythmically rolling his hips to keep nudging the good spot over and over. Already he was building. “This is one smooth talkin’ cock ya got, Cas.”
As Dean stands proudly in the window and exposes himself to the outside world, he pumps his arm faster and faster. He rolls his hips seductively and fucks up into his hand. Cas’s mouth is watering and his poor, exhausted little cock can’t help but try and rise again. He cradles it in his palm and squeezes, groaning aloud as he focuses intently on Mr. Winchester.
Nearby there are pups with newly opened eyes and they're frolicking playfully in the tall grass. Under the protection of the adults, they are fearless as they tussle and tumble. Dean and Cas lay on the hillside together, just watching them and soaking up the warm sunshine. With keen eyes, Dean's Alpha monitors the youngsters, paying careful attention to their various strengths and weaknesses. Thankfully, Dean is far less burdened than his mate when it comes to the responsibilities of leadership. He’s at liberty to kick back and watch the pups without ulterior motives. They’re adorable and Dean can’t get enough.
A deep and throaty chuckle vibrated against Dean’s chest. It sounded hungry. “Not tonight,” Cas husked into his skin.
With the guttural roar of an unholy beast, Crowley finally succumbed and dropped to the ground in his glowing prison. The body remaining on earth was a withered husk without the demon to fill it. The body grew a bit smaller and seemed to fold in on itself as the very last of his essence rolled out of its mouth and sank into the dirt beneath their feet. Dean’s heart was racing as he watched the demon Crowley be exorcised to hell at the hands of his own mother. Pastor Jim continued chanting until everything was still and the witch addressed him directly.
Turning to face him for the first time, Jimmy looked at the jar of queso Dean was holding and appeared to estimate the type of container needed. He reached up into a nearby cabinet and pulled one down, handing Dean a lidded glass bowl that was obviously meant for the microwave. As Dean set to work, Jimmy turned back to his cookies, taking warm ones from the baking sheet and laying them on an adjacent cooling rack.
Even more impressive was the plan to rotate each survivor through the kitchen. They’d help with meal prep and also be taught the basics of how to cook for themselves. It was brilliant. Dean had never been prouder of his little brother than he was in this moment.
I want to thank Destiella for her work. She was responsible for the best line in the last chapter and for some pretty solid recommendations in this one. She's fantastic!
“Definitely not,” he said cooly, leaning back in his chair. He didn’t look up at her again, his eyes eagerly devouring the text, but he did hear it when her chair rolled back to its starting position. He assumed that she’d returned her attention to whatever task his scheduled meeting had interrupted, but he didn’t bother checking to be sure.
“Yep. I think it’s neat, Dean, that you can talk to them or whatever. You’re special. Have you always understood them? Is that why they never scared you the way they scared me?”
But now, thinking about breakfast, nausea sweeps over him. His mouth floods with spit, and he works to swallow it down, fighting his body’s urge to heave everything back up as he moves to get out of bed and into the bathroom. This is the final stage of waking up. The one where he’s got two feet are on the floor and his body is in an upright position. Adrenaline kicks in and he’s running, stumbling like a newborn foal. He fumbles through the doorway and flops down on his knees at the toilet, upchucking everything in wave after wave. The smell only makes it worse as he gasps for breath when he can. His stomach muscles are still clenching long after his belly is empty… even when he’s leaning back against the cool glass wall of the adjacent shower.
“Hey Sleepy,” he coos as he carefully scoops the hamster into his palm. Its little black eyes open to lazily gaze up at him. “You eat yourself into a food coma again, huh buddy?”
The only response he gets is a deeper groan as his rim is probed, circled, and then probed again. “I love that you love it,” he admits, “just like I love knowin’ you’re gonna fuck me tonight.”
“Nothing but the opportunity,” gloated the petit mistress of dark magic. “You see, Fergus, even your own demons hold you in contempt.”
Cas could feel his body gearing up and his dick was starting to throb. He was a tripod on the bed right now with his ass in the air and his mouth locked on Dean’s cock. His shoulders were low, Dean’s legs splayed over them, heavy and hairy and hot against his skin. They were both still overheated from having spent all day in the hot sun and now… no one was going to be cooling off. Their temperature was rising as Cas moved a skilled mouth over Dean’s groin and alternated sucking with licking and nibbling.
When they arrive at the hospital, Bobby is expertly extracted from the cab of the truck and taken inside on a gurney. Sam and Dean are told that that their father is “still hanging on,” but is not conscious. They’re invited to come in and sit with him, but both decline. “If he wakes,” says Dean firmly, “tell him we’ve gone to look for mom.”
Okay, so Destiella had her work cut out for her with this chapter. I appreciate her so very much, and if you guys could've seen my first draft, you'd appreciate her too!
It’s hot again today, the sweltering heat heavy with humidity. There isn’t a cloud in the sky. Turning back towards the city, Dean uses the wall and the unique shapes of the buildings within it to track their position as they move across the open grasslands in search of Mary.
As Dean acknowledged that fact, he felt a click of recognition. Lately he’d spent so much time trying to figure out what had been the tipping point in his journey towards becoming a shitty person. Now he could see it clearly. Pretending. That had been his downfall. It had started out small… just making nice with Crowley when he’d visit, even though Dean really didn’t care much for him. After that, he’d grown more and more willing to pretend that he liked things and people and games and jobs that he didn’t. It had been a downward spiral that had ultimately led him to misery – a life filled with things he had to tolerate and completely devoid of the things he actually cared about. Hell, in the end, he’d even traded away Sam to some extent. Nope. Never again. He knew what was most important now.
Behind him he feels Mr.Kline grow more enthusiastic, obviously spurred on by Dean’s reaction to his dirty deeds. The man slides his hands down from Dean’s hips to his thighs and clamps them there. He retracts his tongue from Dean’s wet hole and draws it lower. Pressing his face between Dean’s spread legs from behind, that sinful mouth is now moving up behind his balls. Sucking in one at a time, the man rolls Dean’s testicles around in his mouth, sucks them, hums on them, releasing each in favor of nibbling along his taint and back to his expectant hole.
Letting his eyes slip closed contentedly, he rolled it around in his mouth, enjoying it for a while before finally letting the weight come to rest in the center. Cradling it on his tongue, Dean let his mind go fuzzy and just enjoyed the sensation as he gently sucked and swallowed around it. When hands grasped him from behind, Dean relaxed into the touch because he knew that Benny was orchestrating the entire exchange. Pliant and trusting, he let himself be repositioned, his knees and elbows now under him and his ass guided upwards.
“Yes,” he chuckles. “I’ve got a son who loves nature shows, so I can definitely picture it.” Then, after a pause he adds, “A baby horse is called a foal, by the way. Not that it matters.”
Glad to be feeling rested, he opted to skip the hassle of signing out when his friends left the premises and resigned himself to quiet afternoon in the common room. He played cards for a while, pulled out his laptop to check headlines again and play a few free internet games, and then, pondering the world that lay on the other side of the glass and his relation to it, he stared out the window for a bit.
When he opens his eyes, Cas blinks in surprise as he sees the pitying look that has come to rest on Zar’s face.
“I’ve given you my name Mr. Winchester. And as for what I want, I should think that would be obvious. I want ninety minutes of your time.”
The good feelings flutter away like dry leaves on an autumn wind when Dean passes by John’s truck. It’s an ugly thing, he thinks, but his father seems sold on it. He’d driven across two states to buy it used, and now spends an inordinate amount of time working on it. If only he invested as much of himself in his kids as he does in his vehicles. Feeling his mood sour, Dean worked to stop the nagging thoughts about his old man. After all, the Impala that his father lavished attention on was now his; he should be glad that it was well cared for.
Glancing at the time, he groans aloud and drops the binoculars to the seat beside him. He doesn’t actually leave though, not until the excitement of the moment has completely faded.
“Let’s make sure we do everything we want to do at least once before we start repeating,” Vic countered.
Pulling an old ball cap from the back seat, Dean headed inside. Passing up the snack foods and cheap souvenirs, he grabbed a prepaid cell phone from the display and took it to the register. He paid cash for the item and left. Farther down the road, he pulled into the parking lot of a bowling alley and activated the new phone. Then, still sitting in his car, Dean placed a call.
Sitting behind the wheel of his dad’s car, Dean rolled his hips into that warm and welcoming mouth. He felt his tip brush the back of the guy’s throat and he groaned aloud. In the real world, his groan was wasted on a client but in his mind, it was given to a mysterious stranger. A light flicked on in the motel room and Dean sucked in a ragged breath. “Get off,” he barked to the man, “I think my dad’s comin’ out.”
As he stood there staring, Dean remembered how surprised he’d been by the sense of shame that had passed over him the last time he’d brought Castiel into this room. Cas had taken one look around and known that this room was a fallacy – a skillful ruse created to keep anyone who entered from knowing the real Dean Winchester. Only a moment ago Cas had stepped into Dean’s house and mentioned that everything looked the same. The thought of his friend entering this room and seeing it exactly as it had been all those years ago was loathsome. He was different now and he wanted Cas to see that.
“That’s quite true. So, you lie to your brother about your occupation. What about your father? Are you in contact with him?”
Dean glanced at Claire and watched her thread her hand into Eileen’s. He felt a bit guilty for taking the young lady out of her own dimension without even consulting Jody or Donna. But, in reality, Claire was a hunter now. She had more cases under her belt than Dean had when he’d begun referring to himself as a hunter. Because he respected Jody as Claire’s mother figure, he’d penned a note for her and left it in the bunker. If something went wrong and they wound up not making it back, Jody would eventually find it and know what had become of Claire... that she’d gone off to save the world (not our world, granted, but a world nonetheless) and had not made it back.
Dean was riveted to the spot and it felt as though his feet were glued to the floor. His vision blurred at the edges. He saw nothing but Crowley, and the ringmaster’s eyes, lit with intuition, trained on him fiercely. Wickedly, they pierced him and saw to his core. Disturbing as it was, there was something sexy about Mr. Crowley. Dean liked the way he looked down his chin as though he knew every secret desire Dean had ever held, and wanted nothing more than to indulge. His poor tired dick began to grow chubby between his legs again as the two men locked eyes, and, with a smirk, Crowley snapped his fingers.
As Crowley said the word ‘mother’ there was a heavy shudder. Dean felt it in his feet, the earth vibrating beneath him. Simultaneously a rush of cool air seemed to pass through the tent. The candles blinked out for a moment in the gust and the tent was plunged into darkness. As the air stilled in the heartbeats that followed, the flames began to flicker back to life again and the rows of candles resumed their robust amber glow. But, something had changed. A woman had appeared in their midst. She was smaller in stature than even Ruby, but with sharp features and fiery red hair, she was a commanding presence. She said only two words as the clowns on the periphery began to whisper amongst themselves. “Hello, Fergus."
Dean thought Crowley almost looked relieved. Then his face slowly changed from relief to fear as she spoke to him.
She spun fluidly when she reached the flaps that led outside and turned to face them as though waiting to see if anyone was foolish enough to try and stop her.
As he eats, Castiel wonders what Jack might have planned for the evening. When the boy was younger, he used to spend Friday and Saturday nights taking Jack and his friends to the movies or the skating rink, the mall, or even somewhere special on occasion - like the carnival. These days he just waits for the boy to come home from doing things with kids his own age, occupying his time the best he can while he waits and making sure his kid is home safe before actually allowing himself to fall asleep.
A moment later he feels something bulbous and wide pressing against his pucker.  His very first John had been big and wide like this and the memory of how it had felt races through his mind and flits back out again as he waits for the inevitable push. That first time he'd been paid to fuck had been awful. Painful, both physically and emotionally. But, with time, Dean had learned to like the feeling of anticipation… that moment when he feels something at his entrance and knows what’s about to happen. These days, he craves it.
Sam nodded, eyes falling back to his lap again. He wasn’t speaking, but Dean could see that he was back to feeling resigned to his fate. He must know that Dean had to try, but he didn’t seem to think anything would come of it. At least he wasn’t fighting it and telling Dean to stay away from the carnival. With his silence, he was agreeing to let Dean investigate.
Another great thing about Lisa was the practicality with which she approached all things. So, if there were ever someone who would be willing to marry a closeted gay man – it would be her. In fact, when she’d had a pregnancy scare once, he’d almost offered her an arrangement. Seeing the look on her face as she’d contemplated life as a single mom had him strongly considering the merits of it. But, in the end it had been a false alarm and the entire line of thought was abandoned.
“Um, I don’t know if I can…” he began, but before Dean could even finish his sentence, Aaron was talking right over top of him.
“The Wares,” Dean tells him coolly, wiping the bloodied blade off in the snow next to him. “They’re gonna get you, Gordon. Welcome to the fuckin’ food chain.”
Claire was elated as they headed to the car, bouncing along and chattering to both of them about today’s work as well as the interview she and Jody had done with the missing woman’s husband. She was lit up like a child at Christmas and pondering what they might uncover if they dug a little deeper at Biggerson’s. Her speculations about what they might be hunting ran the gamut as they languished in mid-day traffic.
Cas watched his niece squeal at the prospect of getting on the monorail. She seemed a little disappointed, the monorail losing its initial charm in comparison to the awesome train rides within the actual parks. Putting a juice box in her hand helped a lot. By the time Cas parted company from them, her head was growing heavy and her eye lids were drooping.
“Oh, yeah,” said his new friend softly. The bed dipped for a moment as the man’s weight shifted and suddenly there was light. Looking around, Dean saw that it was a decent sized bedroom. The walls were done in dark paneling and there were cobwebs in the upper corners. The furniture looked like it had come with the house, and there were posters covering the walls. This was the bedroom of a teenager and Dean loved it right away.
Heading back to the front of the room he addresses them all and says, “Okay, I think you guys are awake now. Everyone can go ahead and take a seat.” Looking out over the room, Mr. Winchester then surprises them all by saying, “Let’s try something. Everyone close your eyes.”
Now, looking over the menu, he realized it wasn’t going to be that bad. He suspected that Cas had chosen a cool place he’d wanted to see, rather than Dean’s offer as a chance to go to the most expensive restaurant on the property. Lots of people would’ve done that, but not Cas. It was just one more thing to like and respect about him.
She looked him up and down. “Great job growing up, Dean,” she flirted. “I could really teach you how to use some of this equipment.”
When his alpha has finally come, flooding wet heat into Dean, it issues another throaty growl and then hunkers down on top of Dean possessively. Dean eagerly surrenders to be dominated by his alpha and revels in moments like this one, where he's physically trapped beneath the animal. It will take a while for the knot to shrink and slip out of him, and Dean enjoys it by purposefully stretching and flexing so he can continue feeling it even as the two of them slowly come down from the high.
That’s when Dean felt the unexpected sensation of lift and drag. He watched the distorted image of his own bloody fists swiping the air ahead of him as he was pulled away from his father against his will. In the absence of further abuse, John slumped down into the dingy carpet like a sack of potatoes. He was just as dirty as one too. Wrenched up to his feet from behind, Dean began kicking out in anger, twisting away from the hands that held him, worried that the pile of filthy man on the floor still had not felt the depth of his anger, needing to get in just one more solid hit.
The sudden brush of cold metal on his skin and the click of a latch brought Dean back from his memories and into the present. Gordon was pulling him away towards the hall. Looking back at Charlie he gave her a wink and a smile before exiting. Heading in the opposite direction of the rec room, they walked towards the wing where private parties were held. Thankfully, Gordon was quiet for the first time as far as Dean could remember.
Dean didn’t bother responding to the lie. He just tipped his head back against the seat and closed his eyes for the drive home. He had a lot to think about.
“Well,” said Pastor Jim, pushing into the conversation, “that would put the fear of God into anyone.”
Dean was stunned. Not only was he floored that Benny was so openly discussing something so taboo, but that he didn’t seem put off by it at all. There was zero judgment on the man’s face as he stepped away.
Feeling young now that he’d adopted that persona, he carried on like a teenager and wailed for his ‘daddy’. He continued screaming like a virgin as he was roughly taken, and doing so made Dean’s cock pulse pre-cum steadily onto the floor between his knees. The man plowed into him from behind, holding his hips in a vice grip as he set a brutal pace. Dean, still gripping his own cock tightly with one hand, bore the weight of the man behind him with one strong arm and eagerly rocked along as he was fucked. Loving what he was getting, but still mindful of satisfying his customer, he made sure that his begging was well suited to the man. Hating himself a little for the ease with which he did it, Dean continued to call the man his daddy. In a squeaking high voice, he pleaded that the cock was too big… that it hurt… that his little boy pussy was too small. He was stroking the man’s ego and they both seemed to know it, but neither cared as Dean’s sloppy wet hole eagerly took all it was given.
Meanwhile, across the park, a raucous group of twenty-somethings has just come through the front gate and is now walking down Mainstreet USA. To their left and right are storefronts, styled in turn-of-the-century architecture. From the open doors of these little shops pours music and cool air. In the windows are different wares… some shops selling souvenirs for kids and others selling souvenirs for adults. Some are selling ice-cream while others sell candy or coffee. All are clean and perfect to the last detail. All are enticing. But as their rowdy group looks around, they are herded ever forward by a gorgeous, baby-faced blonde wearing mouse ears and a bride’s veil.
Even after the others dispersed, Dean had stayed behind. He’d been buzzing hard and needed some time before he felt okay to drive. Sitting at the bar, sipping on water, he’d wound up having a nice conversation with the bartender. When he was finally ready to leave, he’d tipped her well.
When he’d crawled into bed that night, Dean had expected to suffer a sleepless night because of all that had happened. Surprisingly though, he didn’t lay awake long at all. He isn’t carrying a lot of guilt for having killed Gordon, and he’s no longer too fearful of being caught either. So, really, the only thing that really loses him any sleep is hearing his pack call and being frustrated that he can’t answer them.
What degree of freedom he’d be allowed while in this room would be entirely up to the person who’d won the auction. For the allotted time frame, they can do just about anything they want with him. There are rules, of course. Limits. But there really isn’t much that’s completely barred.
He hadn’t made eye contact with Eileen while inside and that had been intentional. He was afraid of what he’d see.
Before sliding under the car in his garage tonight, Mr. Winchester had pulled off his t-shirt and tossed it aside. Behind his eyelids, Cas is now seeing the replay of it and his dick begins to swell. He can just imagine running his tongue over those dusky nipples, and then dropping lower. The Coach has a light treasure trail and Cas would love to push his nose into it. Follow it down.
“I’m not one to beat a dead horse, Dean. Even if I already paid for it. So, are you going to make it worth my time if I stay?”
He'd like to lay here for a while and just enjoy the afterglow but he can't. The vibrator is now dislodged, exposed to the open air rather than buried deep inside him, and its LOUD. Scrambling between the sheets, he recovers the thing and silences it before flopping back down to enjoy the last of the tingles from his orgasm. Even then, with the toy silent, he doesn’t let himself fall asleep.
That night, he’d made a promise to both himself and his friend, a promise born of his notably improved self-esteem. It was a heartfelt vow that he’d abstain from sex completely, rather than engage in the kind of risky behaviors that it took to get his rocks off.
Cautious of the sound of his footfalls, Dean tries to walk stealthily, as do the wolves. They don’t make a sound. He glances at the ground occasionally, monitoring the visible trail of a human. When the prints double up, he signals Cas. Though he’s likely not telling the animal anything he doesn’t already know, Dean can’t quell the urge to mention that they’re likely entering an area of frequent use or, worse yet, an area that’s being used by more than one person.
It always feels good to fuck, but his poor pecker is exhausted. It flops around as he's bred and Dean grabs hold of it when his lover finally comes, cupping it and squeezing his balls as he's filled from behind. Back in the old days it had been usual for once to be enough between them. These days, however, it's generally sufficient. Satisfied, they lay with their limbs tangled until long after Cas has grown small and slipped out.
With his worries tucked away next to his new toothbrush, Dean paused on the way out and they kissed sweetly at the front door when they said goodbye. Dean had spent so long at Cas’s place that by the time he’d gone home to change, he was nearly late for work. His shift was good as usual. Generous tips, easy camaraderie with his co-workers, and a few drinks with them after.
Considering all he had to lose, Castiel could not believe he was still indulging himself like this. And, to make matters worse, the subject of his fixation was no longer some random man or woman who had caught his attention in the next town over. No. These days, the person in his binoculars had connections to his son. He had sunken to an all-time low.
“Suits me just fine,” Dean replied honestly. He slid gracefully down onto the man’s dick and started to move. “I feel like I could come on your cock a hundred times and it still wouldn’t be enough.”
the first time he’d ever had to lob a decapitated head into the hole. Like some kind of bizarre cherry on his death sundae, the thing stared up at him as he began shoveling loose dirt  over the top. He didn’t stop to rest until it was completely covered over and hidden from view. Only then did he take a few minutes to lean on his planted shovel and catch his breath. He stopped twice more to rest before the task was completed, debris scattered over the freshly packed earth in a feeble attempt to hide it. Dabbing the sweat from his dirty brow with his sleeve, Dean surveyed the scene and figured there wasn’t much more he could do.
Later that night, Dean lays in bed and thinks of Castiel Kline. When they’d had dinner at The Mill, he’d wanted to sleep with the guy. He hadn’t made a move, not really, and the reasons for that were good ones. But since then, he’s been tempted to reach out and make contact with the man. He’s got his number. Hell, as recently as today he’d pulled up that number and stared at it. Now, after what he’s done in the living room tonight, Dean is even more interested in making contact. He’d like to see Cas again. Talk to him. He has a viable excuse to reach out, so what is he waiting for?
"Like that’s even the same thing," chuckled Sam, "We met Cas before we even hit puberty. You guys have a long history. It hardly compares." Dean nodded and Sam continued by adding, "Let's not forget that I just sent the love of my life to hell a few weeks ago. I'm a little shell shocked too."
“I’m assuming we’ll be out til sundown,” she tells him, which puts their return somewhere around the supper hour. “But,” she continues, “I’m going to have a half-dozen stops to take all these kids home. Do you need me to drop Jack off first?.”
A wicked grin finds its way to Dean’s face and before he can even think it through, he’s saying, “After we eat.”
Dean loves the way Cas doesn’t mention last night. Instead, he’s giving Dean something to look forward to in the new day. They rise together and throw on some comfortable clothes. Then, Dean stands by while Cas calls out sick from work so they can head for the park.
Moving lower, the thing seemed to be tracing the shape of his upper torso with its wet nose. The whole scene is just a blur in his memory now, so he didn't remember exactly how it had happened at the time. But, somehow the hairy beast had managed to flip him over using nothing but a snout and paws. The moment he'd been put on his belly, Dean had felt a wet nose pushing up under his shirt. It had sniffed up along the small of his back even as it had begun to paw at his pajama bottoms.
“Honey, what’s wrong?” she asks, seeming to pick up on the urgency with which he’s purposefully carrying himself.
With a smug grin, Sam said, "Nope," and pointed to the sign-up sheet. Dean chuckled as he noticed that Sam was signed up to be the overnight person at the church tonight.
Having come already, Dean's body wants to go limp. Piled in a heap with his lower half still buzzing, he takes a deep breath as he realizes that his partner has only just started. He grits his teeth and does his best to keep his torso at the right angle as his alpha comes to be fully seated within him.
“Does it matter?” his dad replies, his shoulders slumping. “It’s not reciprocal. I mean, there might be a little something between us, but I'm the only one with any real feelings."
This year Jack’s been thinking about it a lot and paying closer attention to what the boys around him are doing and saying. He’s really starting to see that sex is the primary motivator to almost everyone but him. The other guys talk of it constantly, discussions about anything else somehow always devolving to the subject of sex.
Jimmy gave him shit all night for being slow and took to putting ice down his back to “keep his ass moving.” It was fun, as shifts at Bernardi’s usually were. Then, after, they all went out. As had become his habit lately, Dean departed after a few rounds.
But, he was here with Cas and that was all that really mattered. After this, Dean would know what Cas sounded like when he was pleasured… what his face looked like when he came. He’d feel Cas’ body alongside his own and he’d release knowing Cas was with him.
Putting his past in the rear view mirror was easy. But cruising America’s highways as a lone wolf didn’t turn out to be the grand adventure he’d always imagined. There’s simply too much time for self-reflection. To Dean, it didn't matter how many sexual conquests he enjoyed, how much cash he hustled at pool, or how much whiskey he put down. Emptiness followed him down the highway like a specter, always lurking in his rearview mirror.
Then, unable to quell his curiosity, he looks over at Jack. The young man has just slid into his regular seat, one much closer to the front. Normally he sits next to Claire, the doe-eyed blonde girl who is constantly warring with Krissy Chambers. She must be absent today since the bell rang quite a while ago and her seat is still empty. Perhaps that’s why Jack’s behavior is a bit out of character; she’s not around to occupy his attention.
“Dean,” she said thoughtfully, “I wonder if your upbringing has clouded the way you see gender roles. I understand that most of the wait staff in restaurants tends to be female. And I also understand that you didn’t have a traditional home life. It wasn’t a parent who brought your meals to the table, it was a waitress. So, do you think that perhaps you see women in general as being cast in the role of someone who is there to serve you? Does that play into the way you think of them when they eagerly welcome your sexual advances?”
When he was finally able to raise his bowed head, Dean saw that Benny had gone back to working his way through the various suspension angles of toe, thrust, camber, and caster, pausing to make adjustments as needed. He worked steadily, without looking at Dean. God bless this man for giving Dean the moment he needed to compose himself.
To pass on today’s excitement, to put the site of Gordons kill behind him and miss the chance to join his pack in a depraved, brutish, and tantalizingly carnal celebration, well, it hadn’t been easy. But he’d done it. Casting a sorrowful and repentant look at his alpha, Dean had turned to leave. The beast had followed him too, casting curious glances up at him with beseeching eyes. If it could speak at all, it would’ve asked him why… why was he leaving when he’d just fed his pack. Again. Why would he not want to take out his cock, bare his hole, join the debaucherous celebration of life that was already starting at the site of their bloody kill?
“This is a fun crew,” he confirmed, tipping back a strange looking shot. “And you’re going to fit in well Dean, I have a sense about these things.”
Dean nodded, certain he’d remember this time. Though he remained committed to keeping himself locked down, Dean could now plainly see that Novak’s question was likely a genuine one, being asked for personal reasons. Then, he turned back to face the wall and rested his eyes as he waited for the man to continue.
“M’sorry,” he mumbled into the towel. He wasn’t sorry he’d done it. Just sorry that his brother had seen it.
Jack’s primary concern is his anonymity. He doesn’t want anyone to suspect which question is his, especially Mr. Winchester. That means he’ll need to disguise both his handwriting and the actual wording of his question.
“Yes. When Ruby brought your brother to Crowley and he signed a deal, she earned herself ten years on earth with him. For a decade she gets out of hell and gets to live like a human again. She can breathe fresh air, sleep in a soft bed, have sex, and eat hamburgers, all the things that humans take for granted.”
The bar was a dive, but they all had a blast. It seemed that the waitstaff at Bernardi’s was attractive, as a rule. Dean knew he’d fit in too, having often been told by his father that he was too pretty for his own good.
Nodding as though he gets it when he really doesn’t, he stretches and stands up. She tosses the tiny roach down at his feet and he grinds it down with his foot to be sure its out. Then, he offers his hand to her. She takes it with a soft smile and hops down from the cement wall they’ve sitting on. Together they walk out of shadow and into the light.
“No. You’re right. It’s not that easy. But, it’s the best thing we’ve got so far. We can’t just exorcise him back to hell. It takes hours, sometimes days, and several men of the cloth to exorcise even a low level demon from a human. He’s not going to just stand there and take it. That’s why possessed people are bound to beds and chairs. Without restraint, they climb right up the walls and ceiling. They attack. Or, they escape. But regardless, our only chance at exorcising this demon is to find a way to keep him restrained and I think we both know that ropes aren’t going to do it.”
“I bet you will,” goaded Dean, moving towards Pam so she could cuff and collar him through the bars.
“Yeah man, it’s me. Listen, I have one question for you. If you answer it without giving me any grief, I might actually call you again someday.”
Dean rolled his window down before backing out of his space. The soft sound of crickets chirping was drown out by the radio and as he pulled out of the lot, Dean looked over at Cas and asked where he wanted to go.
As he works his way up and down the rows like a drill sergeant, the Coach fires off questions and his students answer them in exchange for being allowed to sit back down. When he looks over at her, Jack finds Claire leaning on her desk and smirking at the coach. She likes him, though she’d be loathe to ever admit it, and this kind of stuff is exactly why.
Walking around in front of Dean, Darkeyes stepped up to the adjacent toy cabinet. The man perused it’s contents carefully, his thumb and pointer finger pressed to his chin as he considered the tools at his disposal. Watching was suspenseful with Dean so invested in which item the man would choose. He wanted his hole snapped and he wanted it badly. Sadly, what the man selected was a flogger.
“Thank you all for coming,” said Castiel, projecting his deep voice enough to be heard by everyone. “Jim and I are honored to have such a wonderful group of friends.” Cas then turned to his twin and said, “Happy birthday, little brother.”
Right now Dean was so close to Cas’ body that he could see even the tiniest imperfections of his skin. His eyes lingered on a dark freckle near his friend’s right nipple and he swallowed down the urge to suck that nipple into his mouth.
Taking the pool cue in hand, young Gavin stepped up to the table as if to take a shot at the nearest ball. Dean bent down with him, wrapping an arm around the boy’s waist to reposition his hip. Then, breathing into the boy’s ear as he said it, Dean told him to form an imaginary line between the ball and the pocket he wanted to put it into. “Got your line?” he asked in a husky voice.
“I wanted you to see this place, Cas. I wanted you to know where it was. The Pastor here, Pastor Jim, is a friend. He’s been good to us… helps my dad… helps us.” Over in the passenger seat, Cas was waiting for Dean to finish. But it wasn’t easy to put the words in the right order. “Cas, if you ever want to find me, you can come here. Pastor Jim will always know where I am and how to get in touch with me. If you ever change your mind and want to see me again but I’ve moved, then just come here. Jim will take care of you until I can come for you.”
Dean chuckled and turned his attention back to his food as the waitress approached, spearing a sausage with his fork and sliding it through his pancake syrup before popping it into his mouth.
“I need you to understand something Dean. I don’t have a mother. I mean, at least you’ve got some memories of her. I’ve got fucking nothing. Just a few old pictures.”
“Alright,” she nodded, moving on to the next question. “Are you given any daily pills like vitamins or nutritional supplements?”
Reader exposed to recollections of homophobic language. Reader exposed to recollections of sexual experimentation between under-age boys (nothing descriptive).
Unable to manage much else, Dean simply laid there in the fetal position with his hands over his dick and tried to breathe steadily as he waited for assistance. He hadn’t looked over at Kevin yet, but the odds were in favor of the young man being in a similar posture right now.
“As I said before,” smiled Cas, “just add kissing to your list and it won't seem so vastly inferior to mine.”
“Dean Winchester,” he said by way of introduction. The man’s handshake was firm and his demeanor was quite pleasant. But, he was handsome and British so he carried himself with a confidence that bordered on aloof. “Balthazar Roche,” he said in response. “But everyone calls me Zar.”
The weight of Sam’s hand fell on Dean’s shoulder, probably meant to stop him from advancing on the rift that twined alluringly. It called to Dean. His mother was on the other side of that makeshift door.
Feeling resolved, Dean turned apologetic eyes toward Jimmy. Trying hard to avoid damaging the man’s pride, he admitted his desire. “I’d be a fuckin’ liar if I said I didn’t want to. But it’s not a good idea. I mean, not if we’re gonna stay friends. And if we go there… we’re not gonna.”
As he and his mate grow older together, Dean watches the world around them slowly change for the better. Just as Sammy had once predicted, the alliance between Wares and humans winds up being a positive force in the lives of both species. They are flourishing together now, rather than slowly dying off in opposition to one another.
“It’s not,” he sighs. “I just wonder where it’s coming from. Is this because of Zar’s wedding? Are you just excited to have a trip coming up?”
He turns on the television and in the blue light it gives off, he digs through the top drawer of his dresser where the unmentionables are. He’s already cupping himself through his jeans as he tosses a dildo and some lube onto the bed. Pulling his shirt off as he walks over to the closet, he reaches up to the top shelf at the back and grabs the unmarked box where his pornos are stored.
“I know there was,” called Nick from the other room, “and probably a whole jalapeño too. Don’t light a match.”
Third, the word ‘sir’. All of the guests in the Dr. Cum Control videos used it when speaking to Cas. Sometimes it was a whisper, sometimes it was a grunt, occasionally it was a desperate word that was garbled beyond recognition. But when Dean heard the word ‘Sir’ now, he always thought of Cas.
“Me too,” smiled Dean, leaning back to peck his angel’s cheek warmly before putting the Impala in reverse and backing out onto the highway again. The car was silent as they drove home, and a new kind of feeling settled over Dean. It was uncanny, this feeling, and he continued to ponder it as he pulled into the bunker’s garage and walked with Cas down the long hall. As they passed the library, Dean made a split second decision… he’d do it now, quick and painless, like ripping off a band-aid. Grabbing Cas by the hand and pulling him along, Dean stepped into the room where his mother and brother, along with Claire and Eileen were still working. “We’re back,” he said to the group.
“Well, yes, I suppose I’m looking forward to the trip,” his father allows, turning to look at him again. “But if I seem happy to you, then maybe I’m just happy?”
Cas wasn’t releasing Dean from the circle of his arms. With their faces so close, it was hard to read his friend’s facial expression, but it seemed hopeful. “I mean it,” Dean tried to reassure, “I’ll never ditch you again. Ever. I swear it. I swear it on my… on my… on Sammy. I swear it on Sammy. Never. Again.”
“Not if you’d like him to keep his job, Dean. He’s used up all his warnings. He’s been through detox. There’s nothing I can do to cover for him anymore.”
It was impossible to keep his hips still as Cas worked his hole. His right leg was lifted by a strong hand and shoulder. The new angle left Dean’s body even more exposed now and Cas seemed to double down his efforts. He nibbled playfully at the puckered skin around the hole. He teased over it lightly and then pushed at it with his tongue before he finally sank in. Dean twisted to the side, working to get his leg higher and give this man more room to work… he was incredible.
“Um, you’re gonna have to turn me loose then,” he replied, tipping his head to indicate the cable tether that wound through both cuffs and his collar. He had about twenty inches of leeway between the three.
When Eeyore came by, Cas enjoyed the hug a little too much, soft furry arms wrapped around him and giant head tilted into his. He hoped his face didn’t give away how much he loved all this. But it probably did.
This, it would seem, is going to be his new normal with Jack - a relationship that’s more adult in nature. One where they can tease each other and even share some secrets. Perhaps it will be more rewarding for them than the hierarchical relationship they’ve had up to this point.
Immediately there were hands on his bare ass and Dean felt a shiver of delight snaking up his spine. He had to wriggle to get the leather chaps to sit right over his hips, but he’d soon settled into a slow grind to the music. The man’s hands on him squeezed and kneaded the meat of his ass as Dean’s customer stared enviously at his swiveling hips and shiny, bare chest. Between his cheeks there was moisture already starting to gather, despite having just been wiped down after the chaps were put on. The party had barely started and already his greedy hole was juicy and clenching - dying to be fucked. Behind him, he felt the ghost of a touch, rough fingers sliding over his back. Turning, he saw that it was Benny brushing past him. He watched for a moment as his friend led a man away from the group, already playing the part of the heavy bear and Dom that he was clearly meant to embody. The client was practically giddy as he followed his rented Dom, obviously excited for whatever was about to happen.
“They have my sympathy too,” Cas adds with a nod, “especially considering that the neighbors wound up calling in a complaint. They’re coming home to more than just a mess.”
Pulling in, he noticed the natural stone exterior of the office and the cleanliness of the grounds and hoped the place wouldn’t be too terribly expensive. Walking into the office, he was greeted warmly by the counter help. He requested two adjacent doubles.
“You’ll know what’s working because they’ll encourage you. They’ll make little noises, they’ll start to breathe more heavily, sometimes their eyes will close. As you both start to build together, speed and power increase and you’ll start to see bigger approval signs like twitching stomach muscles or a leg shaking, a back arching.
Dean almost laughed at that. It’s been a while since anyone talked to him like a twink. He’d come here young enough to still embody that particular fantasy, but he’d long since outgrown it.
Stopping at the shop to return Benny’s truck, Dean found the employees all lounging in an unused service bay, the industrial sized garage door open and a soft breeze floating in. Two of the men, Nick and Saul, were leaning up against the cinderblock wall, tucked into the shade of the awning above as they nursed cigarettes and watched the traffic go by. Dean had gotten to know them over the past few days as he’d spent time with Benny. Both were older, married with children, and seemed content to live vicariously through their younger friends. Looking past them, Dean saw Benny goofing off with Ash, the two men circling each other playfully and trading threats while snapping at one another with greasy red shop rags.
“Oh yeah, I’m insinuating it alright,” continues Jack, talking with his mouth full. He makes quick work of chewing and swallowing and then carefully and loudly enunciates, “Pen-e-tra-tion.”
“Sam managed to clean up a decent picture of him. I’ve forwarded it to you, Donna, and you can send it to Claire. That way you guys will have it on your phones.”
When Zar enters the kitchen, the tea is ready and there’s an artfully assembled platter of holiday cookies and candies set out on the table. Taking seats across from one another, both prepare their cup they way like it. “Wildflower honey with cinnamon,” says Zar, reading the label aloud. “Where did you find this?”
“Jesus,” he whispers, barely able to process what’s happening and trying to adjust. His world has just turned on its axis and he can’t seem to get acclimated to this new reality. “Jeez-us,” he says again, louder this time. “What?” he pleads. “What’s happening?”
It was a moot point in reality, because Dean knew that his father was a killer. He was too. So was his baby-faced younger brother. But, in considering the agent’s question Dean had to admit that the agent likely hadn't expected an answer. He had probably just wanted Dean to think about his loyalties and how strong they really were. So, he turned his thoughts to the possibility of him turning over his own father if he somehow turned out to be guilty. It was terrifying to realize that he honestly didn’t know.
He’d spent all night dreaming of depraved things and then all morning trying to be patient as he waited for a chance to live out those dreams. If it was up to him, he’d number these men off in the order that they appealed to him and then take them… one by one at first… and then two or three at a time until he finally blacked out - only to wake up still wanting more and more and more.
Dean was still in between Pam and Cas when she pulled him up by the chin. She didn’t speak, but she looked deep into his eyes as she reached out and stroked his cock, taking a firm hold of him at the base of it and pulling him forward by it. He grinned stupidly at the gesture, giddy in the moment. The first push into her brought with it an intense rush. She removed her hand from him as he sank into her warmth. Dean felt his body become sloppy, like an octopus or a jelly fish, just completely shapeless. He slid into her waiting arms with a soft moan and surrendered helplessly.
“I’m not hungry,” Sammy replies. “It’s just that, well, mom left around lunch time. So that means she’s been missing four full days now. Full twenty-four hour days, Dean. Four.”
Dean’s knees buckled as he realized what the future really held for him. From a few yards away, Castiel whimpered. Dean was loosing precious moments as he withheld his agreement and who could know exactly how many more precious seconds the Demon Crowley would wait before snapping his finger again to summon John and Jim into their midst. Dean was going to say yes eventually, Crowley was right about that. But the words, he just couldn't speak them. He simply couldn't utter the single syllable that would accept the deal, even though he knew that nothing better would be offered.
Dean couldn’t help grinning as he watched the man try to end the conversation. Stealing his attention back, the sound of ripping velcro brought Dean’s eyes back to his nurse who was now  wrapping a blood pressure cuff around his arm. He watched her face as she inflated it. She glanced up at him once and gave an easy smile before dropping her eyes to the dial that gave a reading as she slowly deflated the cuff.
Nothing has ever been so completely wrong and yet so right… so unbelievably dangerous and still so safe. Every time he’s mounted by his Ware, Dean is enveloped in fur, soft and warm. He’s nuzzled sweetly and licked reverently. But then, he’s also violently penetrated. He’s completely dominated and, quite literally, fucked into the ground. This happens with dozens of eyes on him and muted growls intermittently rising from the other canines nearby.
“Mom?” he calls. There’s no answer. He's louder when he calls out again and soon he's shouting. They both are. Having now entered the grove of trees, they can't see her flag to find her. They can only press on, moving it what feels like the right direction. When they finally hear an answering yell, the brothers both sigh deep relief and then they’re running again. Following her voice to the base of knotty old pine, they crash into the lower branches of the tree. Cuts and scrapes be damned, they hoist themselves up from branch to branch until their upstretched, eager arms are making contact with her boots. Assisting her as the three of them then climb back down, she's shaky and crying with relief when they're finally on the ground.
Dean turned to let Cas pass him and then followed as the man expertly maneuvered through the haunted house. As they slid through narrow passages, Cas was stripping his suit off. Dean could only see what was happening in small bursts when their movements would trigger some spooky scene to life. But, as they moved, Cas shoved something soft into Dean’s hands.
When the initial rush has passed over, he slumps down into the bed. Still panting heavily, he lays there with his eyes shut to enjoy the feeling as it begins to fade away. Too soon, he’s left with only the jittery after-effects of an endorphin rush and a dull ache between his cheeks where the vibrator is still buzzing away.
Following Cas’ pointing finger with his eyes, Dean saw an approaching pod of dolphins. The school and the pod met in passing and there was an uproar of excitement from the Learners as it happened. Many, like Dean and Cas, pushed their palms out and tried to touch one of the dolphins as the skimmed by. Likewise, the dolphins pushed in close, letting curious fingers run down their sides while chirping enthusiastic greetings.
“Yeah?” he whispered cautiously, suddenly feeling fear build again. Cas’s voice was laced with something… apprehension, maybe?
Though it felt like they were deep in the woods, Dean could hear cars passing on the nearby road. And from the adjacent park, the sounds of a little league game were being carried to them on the gentle breeze that wafted through the leaf canopy above. They’d gone about ten yards when Dean suddenly realized all he was about to leave behind.
She pursed her lips and rolled her eyes. “I think this will go better if you don’t talk,” she joked. He let himself laugh and felt encouraged when she didn’t pull away from him. Raising an eyebrow to him she added, “Oh you really think you’re something dontcha?”
Remembering the way he’d laid himself out on the floor in the gallery, Dean tried to find some way to enjoy what he was doing. Working on someone’s feet was subservient, after all, and Dean liked to be subservient. Hoping for the best, Dean leaned in and licked a stripe up the top of the man’s foot  to his ankle. Hoping that a little tongue tease would be all that was needed, he then pressed upwards and tried to push his mouth into the man’s lap.
There are a few things to look forward to with the new school year, but right now he’s too grumpy to bother focusing on them. Rubbing at his watery eyes, Jack heads down the hall for a shower. He comes awake under the hot water, and begins to think clearly. His stomach is growling and he wonders what’s for breakfast as he towels off.
Dean thinks of this place as their Northern den, while the cave that had originally been their den has come to feel like their ‘southern den’ to him. No doubt they will continue to use it when they need to spend a few nights on the other end of town, but they’ve not slept there at all since having found this place.
The exchange feels like a scene from a movie and he wonders if he’s meant to discreetly take the contents and leave, or if he’s meant to stay and look through it now. The man across from him is wearing a stern poker face so with no clue as to how he’s meant to proceed, he asks.
When he gets down to the last few days, Cas winds up having to accept that there are things he won’t be able to get done in time. He sits down and trims his list until it represents attainable goals. Then, he hands off a list of last-minute things that are needed from the store and sends Jack out to procure them while he continues working on getting the house ready for the company they’ll be welcoming that day.
Everyone in earshot bursts out laughing. The bell rings at that moment and lunch is over. Jack shoves one last bite in as he rises from his seat and as they carry their trays to the window, Claire suggests they walk home together. He gladly accepts, though he’d already assumed that they would since he doesn’t have practice.
“Oh, it’s probably nothing,” he says, imitating what he thinks he’d sound like if this were all really happening. “I just was over at Gordon’s place helping with his truck. He took it out for a test drive and never came back. I figure he’s stalled out somewhere. I’m thinkin’ we should go round him up, it’s been at least two hours and it ain’t getting’ any warmer out there.”
It seemed gutsy to hope that his face had not been featured on the news. But logic seemed to indicate that it wasn’t out of the realm of possibility. Given the sheer number of people who’d been marched out of the brothel, the odds were actually in his favor. For now, he was happy just to have hope. If nothing else, it would seem he’d been granted a window of time and, thankfully, some clarity with which to gather information and formulate a plan.
The man currently cringing in the back was quite handsome – at least, what Dean could see of him. He had vibrant eyes and a rough five o’clock shadow, both attractive qualities as far as Dean was concerned. But, he wasn’t in the mood to waste his first and best fuck of the day on a man who would be too nervous to really perform. So, he gave the man a trademark wink and then turned his gaze to the rest of the crowd.
John slid up next to his mate and wrapped an arm around her waist, easing the burden of her swim by adding his tail to her forward momentum. Dean trailed along behind them then, watching their two tails swish and the huge bump of her tummy hanging beneath her.
Knowing that Cas had been on the road all his life, Dean felt compelled to cultivate a home for his friend. He'd already begun looking for a house they could move into, but in the meantime, he did all he could to make them both comfortable. Returning from an errand at the hardware store, Dean handed his man a variety of paint color cards and asked him to choose his favorite for their room. Then, on his next day off, Dean went to work painting over the dingy walls. Taking a bit of extra time to repair the cracks and holes before starting had proven to be a wise time investment, leaving Dean to feel proud of how the room looked despite its wear-worn carpet. The new bed that he bought took over a week to be delivered but once it was set up, he and Cas sprawled onto it happily, thrilled to be done sharing Dean’s old twin size mattress.
“No,” he murmured, summoning the will to open  his eyes, “No, Anna, I’m going back to finish the party.”
Dean nodded agreement, even though he really didn’t want to leave. He was reluctant to try and cajole his angel into staying longer if he didn’t feel like it. Instead, he tipped back the last of his drink and headed for the door.
Cas took a long pull from his beer as Dean reached around him to grab the marker from someone and hand it to Cas.
Dean swallowed hard as she took him in hand and slid her palm up the length of him. He’d withered a little without a stimulating hand. But now, under her grip, his body responded by filling him quickly.
“I’ll get you a handler,” he repeated dryly, clearly giving Dean a hard ‘no’ to any further pleasure.
He could have taken the tunnels beneath the park, but this was more fun. No matter how many assholes try to squash it… Cas’ love of this place lives on. Someday he’ll bring his own kids here and watch their faces light up as they see it. They’ll see his movies too. The thought makes him smile.
Once  more, the Coach calls on the same student. The only one raising her hand. “Because,” she says meekly, “social norms are there for a reason. It’s how society functions.” With growing confidence, she continues by saying, “For example, take pedophelllia. That’s a deviation from the normal and it’s punished with isolation. The person convicted has to stay away from children and be put on a registry so that everyone will know to keep their kids away. That leaves the offender feeling isolated and alone. Others with the same inclinations will fear the same treatment and, hopefully, not engage. That’s why things are the way they are.”
But here were Gabe and Kali, just sorting out diaper bag supplies and discussing whether they should take Gabby through the buffet line or simply make her plate. As he watched them, Cas realized that this place wasn’t so impressive to the two of them as it was to him. First, they ate at nice restaurants all the time. Secondly, they didn’t love this place like he did. For Cas, this place was the epicenter of magical wonderment.
"I promised you something though," he said tentatively, "and that's a promise I've kept. For years and years."
“That works,” he agrees, only to pass it back to her, “but since I always share with you anyway, you can hit it.”
When they reach the end, they’re deep in a discussion of the legend of Saint George and the Dragon. Suddenly, Cas stops in his tracks. “Wait,” he says, “I almost forgot. The tickets I bought come with passes for the skydeck.”
Eileen had grown attached to Mary as the two had spent time together in the bunker, and in hindsight Dean could see it. He simply hadn’t noticed it at the time because he’d been too focused on his own problems with his mother.
“You know, I remember having everyone around for birthday parties and stuff… Grandma and Grandpa took me to the fair once. I never really thought about it until now, I just figured they’d flown in for a visit or something.”
“I can’t promise anything,” was the cautious response. That was followed with, “I’ll call you back,” in a more resolute tone. Though his words seemed to end the call, both men were still clearly on the line. After a few seconds of silence, Dean said, “Was there something else?”
The Dead Boat was just that… a boat that had once floated on the surface barrier. But, once it had sunk below the barrier, the Weaklings had died. Dean smiled as he thought of them. At a young age, one of the Guardians had teasingly referred to the inhabitants of the boats as Weaklings because they couldn’t survive in water. Cas had liked the name too, so it had stuck.
Laughing as his dad tries and fails to retrieve it, Jack continues to evade the man, pulling the can away, first over one shoulder and then the other. “Too late,” he laughs, “you already gave it to me, it’s mine!”
As Benny leans into him, Dean feels his body grow still and expectant. Projecting strength, Dean grits his teeth and says, “Get on with it then.”
Both twinks were noticeably absent from the room, likely being cleaned up at the moment, and, between two couches, there was a pulsing, writhing orgie happening on the floor.
Still down on one knee, Cas leaned in closer and rested a hand on Dean’s shin. “I hope you’ll enjoy this,” he said firmly, “but if you don’t, you can safeword. I will not be angry if you do.”
“Fine,” he grumbles, turning on his side to make room for her. Opening his eyes for just a moment, he looks around the room. Silvery moonlight is spilling in through the huge picture window above the couch. It glows on her skin, an odd shade of blue that seems to make her eyes even brighter. When she’s all settled in, he says, “I’m gonna miss you next year.”
“Code 4,” growled Benny, indicating that his traffic stop had failed to pull over and he was now in pursuit.
The man he’d locked eyes with was tall and tan with a medium build similar to Dean’s own. He had the look of a European and was dressed in dark jeans and a button down shirt with the sleeves rolled up. His forearms were inked and his dark eyes promised dirty deeds. Dean was thrilled when the man ran a hand through his shiny hair and began walking over. Bringing his hands back forward again, Dean rested his elbows on the padded supports. Now, positioned properly on the bench, he was basically on all fours but with his ass presented much higher than his shoulders.
Compared to Garth, Ash was a fine specimen. Though he wasn’t weak-looking, Ash only appeared muscular when no one else was around. His small frame, next to the others was unimpressive.
Life for humans in this version of the universe would be improving now, but Eileen had lost much in the battle to make it so. Her mother was long gone, and her surrogate father, Bobby, had been taken from her as well. Clearly Mary was special to her, but Dean knew this version of his mother well enough to know that Eileen wasn’t special to her. Of course Eileen must know that too. To Mary Campbell, Eileen was, at best, a prized student or apprentice. Now that she’d spent some time on Dean’s version of earth, Eileen had gotten to know Mary Winchester. Compared to Mary Campbell, Dean’s mother was warm and compassionate. She may not be all that he’d imagined in her absence, but clearly being a mother had made a difference in her. She thought and acted quite different from the childless version of herself.
the fuckin’ guards around here are armed. Every single one of ‘em is packin’. It’s for our protection.”
“No, it’s not interesting. It’s bullshit. He’s just following his dick like it’s a dowsing rod. He’s always been too interested in settling down for his own good. Never really bought into the solo life like I did. A couple years ago he started talkin’ about settling down with another hunter… someone who understands the life. Now it looks like he’s found one.”
“Secondly, I must tell you, it’s important to rest after you’ve released. Physically, you might feel ready to go again just a few minutes later. But in reality, moving quickly from one conquest to the next seems to diminish the amount of expenditure you’ll deliver. We recommend waiting a bit longer in between, just to make sure that when you release again – you’re delivering a viable load.”
Both were breathing hard when they parted, exhilarated, and Dean found himself laughing as he considered how reckless he’d been. And how happy.
Turning back to the man, Dean caught the hint of a smirk forming at the corner of his mouth when he said, “This is an oyster bar. Come back with somethin’ slippery.”
Dean does. He stays perfectly still, as though he’s impaled by a sword and dares not move. He grips tightly to the headboard and tries to focus on just breathing in and out. At his back, Castiel Kline doesn’t grow impatient. He plants soft kisses along Dean’s spine and whispers platitudes about how handsome he is and how lucky he thinks himself to be for even being allowed to enter this room… that he’s dreamed of Dean and wanted him… for years now… that he’d never wanted someone so much in all his life.
Cas nodded, looking past Dean at the building. The little steeple at the top had a soft amber light glowing in its tiny window. Aside from that, the building was dark.
“Lemme see those,” he says to his brother, reaching for the binoculars that still hang around Sam’s neck. Seeming to seize an opportunity to rest, Sam drops his heavy pack to the ground and unwinds the rope from around his neck to pass them over. Dean holds them to his face, adjusting the lenses as he peers through them to zero in on the wall. Beside him, he hears the whump of his brother plopping down on his satchel to rest. The wolves, too, seem eager for a break and Dean can hear them lowering themselves to the ground and stretching out. They’re panting quite heavily now in the mid-day heat, but he knows they aren’t inattentive just because they’re hot and tired. He still trusts them to have his back as he stands out in the open. Watching the gate for a moment, he makes note of how many are on duty before scanning back and forth along the length of the wall. Nothing seems unusual or out of place, but he’s been gone long enough that it all feels foreign to him. That’s when it dawns on him that this isn’t his home anymore.  Without having ever consciously made a choice, Dean had chosen. His home is with the wolves now and he’s never been more certain of it than he is in this moment.
“... I promised your mother that I would help you, Jack, and I intend to follow through on that. If you wish it, that is.”
“It’s too cold to really sit down now anyway,” she tells him - and she’s right. The temperature has been steadily dropping since they left school. Less than two hours ago they’d walked in sunshine and a gentle breeze, but now it’s dark and the wind is cold and biting.
Moving across the northern part of town, which the members of his community have never even attempted to enter, Dean hadn’t even realized he’d been looking for a place of his own until he’d found one. But, the moment he’d pushed in through the front door, he’d had an overwhelming urge to claim the place for his own. Bordering the edge of town on its Northwest corner, the acreage has several large outbuildings. Seated on a hilltop, it has a view of neighboring properties as well as the city itself, sprawling through the valley below. There’s a small pond on one side of the property and small creek nearby too, tributary to a much larger river that rolls through town.
Holding his breath, he eases the door open. The sound of hinges squeaking seems loud enough to wake the dead and despite the cold air around him, Dean breaks out in a cold sweat. To avoid making any more noise, he opens the door no farther. Turning his body sideways, he cautiously slips through the small opening. He’s relieved to be inside, but finds himself enveloped in a much deeper darkness now.
“How much have you told her about me?” he asks, watching her eyes carefully as he waits for her to reply.
“Well, don’t fuck it up,” he teased. Taking a deep breath, Dean sighed on the exhale and said, “I just knew you’d be happy there.”
Dean stopped listening for a moment to ponder that… the complexity of it as well as the obvious implications. Bobby was still talking and Dean tried to force himself to track the words. Across from him, standing next to Eileen, Sam was nodding along. It was a good thing Sam was focused because all Dean was getting were bits and pieces.
Sadly, Dean’s angry words didn’t cause contemplation or remorse in his father. Instead, they had somehow incited John to violence. As he moved around the room, dodging blows, Dean was shouting through tears of frustration, “Aren’t you even curious about where he went? What he’s been doing?”
Ready to call it a night and head home, Cas glances around the neighborhood one last time before turning the key in the ignition. Easing out away from the curb, he rolls down the street. Once he’s turned the corner, he puts on the radio, but then at the next corner, a creeping dread spreads over him. Turning off of the main road and coming towards him is a black and white police car.
The cool water rushed over his slippery and overheated member. “Fuck!” he called out, because he was simply unable to hold back a verbal appreciation of the sweet relief. His dick was now free to grow even larger. Dragging his heavy cock through the water, he felt himself shiver at the sheer excitement that came with knowing his most private part was on display for all to see. Overwhelmed with the eroticism of the moment, he cursed aloud again but the sound of it was lost to his own ears in the tumult of sounds around him. Voices, all bleeding together in a wash of sound – cursing, pleading, begging, moaning, gasping. Amid the chorus of voices were lewd sounds like the slurping of cocks, slick in their own oily juices and sliding in and out of panting mermaids; the sucking of greedy mouths that choked on hard cock and couldn’t get enough. The collective auditory feedback from those he now swam with incited a primal, animalistic greed in Dean that he feared might never be quelled. Drawing in a ragged breath of the salty sea, Dean tasted everyone on his tongue – the collective spend of countless mermen diluted in the water. The flavor he’d longed to know. Cum. He felt himself pulse with salacious excitement and grow even larger in the hand that stroked him.
When the bill is dropped on the table, they both reach for it. Laughing, they both try to insist. In the end, Dean suggests they split, since this isn’t a date. Castiel agrees easily and when they leave, Dean is sad to part. There’s an awkward moment in the parking lot, neither really sure how to say good-bye or goodnight. They do a strange little dance where Dean considers going in for a hug and thinks better of it, Castiel having leaned in too and having to pull back in reaction to Dean’s indecision. Both men wind up laughing nervously, and then Dean reaches out and thumps Cas on the shoulder saying, “See ya, buddy.”
The walk back home was pleasant, their skin and trunks drying as they made their way south through town. Sam rambled as they went along, talking of the kids they’d played with at the pool, the rides he hoped would be at the carnival, and the things he wanted to do over the summer. Dean nodded along, delivering appropriate responses as needed, but not really listening. His mind was on other things – mostly his father. He wondered what they’d find when they returned to the house. Would John still be sleeping? Would he be cranky when they woke him?
The errand proved to be anti-climactic. No one even hassled them, no one even got near Dean’s car, and even though this venue looked like a chain restaurant, the food and drinks were quite good.
“Yeah,” he says, giving Dean’s dick a final squeeze before pulling away. “We’ll get some privacy. Where we headed?”
“Dean!” Sam shouted back, clearly relieved to hear his brother’s voice but not really paying attention to the words being shouted at him.  Through the crowd of masked and made-up faces, the two brothers shoved back at the bodies impeding them until they were close enough to embrace. As they crashed together, Dean was repeating over and over, “She’s a demon, Sammy, she’s a demon.”
