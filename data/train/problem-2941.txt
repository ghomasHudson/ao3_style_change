”Henrickson, Victor.” He smiles. His eyes are as dark as his skin. Dean feels something stir in his chest. “I haven’t seen you around here before, you new?” His voice is deep. It reminds Dean of Cas.
”Sure do,” Dean muses. He probably still has glitter in his hair from the confetti cannon. “You gonna take Gilda this year?” They make eye contact in the mirror.
”Seriously, Cas, riddle me this.” Dean starts. They’re very close together, so close that Dean barely has to raise his voice, although he really wants to. “How does everyone in movies know how to dance?”
He squeezes the beads and takes his hand out from between Castiel’s. The rosary gets stuck on his glasses when he puts it on. When he gets it on properly, it sways gold and blue against the greys and browns of the graveyard. It is beautiful, and it makes Sam feel pretty beautiful, too.
He stares, tired eyes going wide. Dean drops to the floor, collapsing at Cas’ feet. His breath comes in shallow, heaving sobs.
It isn’t a minute later when he gets a response.
”What’s all this?” Dean strolls over to Sam, who’s tied his hair back in a loose ponytail and is wearing a stained “Kiss the Cook” apron.
Everyone shuffles into their seats, Ellen and Jo sitting next to each other despite the heated conversation they're getting into. It's one Dean's heard before. So many times, in fact, he's nearly got it memorized.
"Early, Dean! Really early!" Sam rubs his eyes again, clunking down into the seat next to Dean. "Whatever, Merry Christmas." It sounds like an insult when Sam says it. "You need any help, Cas?" Sam's voice is much nicer when he talks to Cas. Once again, Cas refuses.
The first thing he does it remove his squelching shoes and leave them to dry over the air vent. Even in his bare feet, his footsteps echo. There's a box of Kraft macaroni and cheese waiting for him in the kitchen. He paces around while waiting for the water to boil, pausing at the back door. Eden stands limply, flooding the plants with more water than they'll ever need. No small creatures are scampering around: they're all, hopefully, tucked away safe in their homes. Castiel searches for their tiny heart beats in the dark, praying that every one of them is alright.
”I can’t accept this.” Sam insists. His stomach churns. Guilt.
Dean has to hit the CD player a few times to get it to open, but once it does he drops
The rest of the day, Castiel unwittingly spends listening to the seconds tick away on the clock. By the last five minutes of his Chemistry class, he's on the very edge of his seat with his fingers drumming the desk. He slides a hand into his pocket, grasping at nothing. And then, finally, the bell rings. Castiel is out of the door before anyone else.
"Let's do this again some time."
"Sammy." Is all Dean can think to say. His little brother nods slowly, at nothing in particular.
Trigger warning: death
, sitting on his bed, catches his eye. The plastic-wrapped front cover is shining yellow in the fluorescent light.
Is all Castiel can think. The taller boy fishes a carton out of his coat pocket, pulling two out. Castiel takes one. It's not as heavy in his hand this time. Dean's lighter gives him trouble, sparking and choking when he flicks it.
Sam looks around the room one more time. He sniffs.
He thinks. He leaves the table, heading further back into the house.
"No, I mean..." Dean looks away, but doesn't take his hand off of Cas' shoulder. "you miss movie nights with us most weeks 'cause you've got so many damn doctor's appointments. And now you tell me you've been smoking? What the hell, Cas, that's not something okay people
Sam doesn't realize how numb he actually is until he's back in the sticky heat of the gymnasium.
”I didn’t-- I mean, I had no clue that…” Dean stumbles through an apology. He leans forward, wavering, like there is still something else. Castiel smiles, raising a shaky hand to quiet his friend, and whatever other thoughts he may be having. Cas feels the anger melt out of him. When he lowers his hand, it lands over Dean’s. “I’m really bad at this.”
Clothes disappear faster than smoke. Jace's skin feels warm and slick, and Dean wants to taste the ink of her tattoo. He can feel the air thrumming and his own heart beating in his chest. There's a row of condoms in the back seat that Jace opens with her teeth. If Dean wasn't hard before, he is now.
Dean hadn’t actually thought this far.
"No way, dude, shit, he's my uncle."
“You’ve seriously never read this one?” Dean asks, not looking up. As he heads, Dean’s eyelashes leave long shadows on his cheeks.
off the cushion. It brings Dean back to his dream, and running his hand over Cas’ scar. Dean licks his lips. He really isn’t sure how he’s going to get through this movie.
”I never had the chance.” Cas admits, looking bashful.
"Want some help?" Dean offers. Bobby nods and mutters something gruff in reply. Dean claps his hands. "Alright, everyone out of the kitchen. Gotta let the man work his magic!" Jess files out first, followed by Sam and the Harvelle's. Rummy pads after Jo with a whine. Dean glances at Bobby, running in his head exactly what he's going to say when he gets back, before following everyone to the table.
He remembers Alfie, one night while they were sprawled out in the middle of Eden, looking up at the stars through the tops of the trees, telling Castiel how he thinks that maybe he’d done something wrong. Alfie had thought about it for months, if maybe his soul was built sideways, or he had done something when he was young to make God angry. It had made him feel dirty and sick, like he had tar stuck to his joints. Castiel was enraged to hear such a bright young boy say such things about himself. He could never understand why.
”Dormer, then.”
“I think that would be very appropriate,” She says after a long silence. Dean lets out a heaving sigh. He closes his eyes.
Once everyone’s back in their seats, Pastor Jim says a few words, thanking everyone for coming. The churchgoers take a few minutes to collect their belongings and bow to the altar before heading out the door. Pastor Jim waits outside in the cold to shake everyone’s hand as they go past.
"How've you been, kiddo?" Dean asks, grinning wide at Sam more than Jess. Sam clears his throat and pushes his glasses up. "No, no, it's fine. I'll just go back to being a housewife." He leaves the pair in the kitchen. Instead of going back to Sam's room, he goes to his own and flops down on his bed like he hasn't seen it in years.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam thinks. It makes something settle uneasily in his stomach, so he just turns his attention back to the sermon.
“I know." Dean hears footsteps outside. "Hey, Bobby, I got to go.” He doesn't wait for his uncle to reply, just clicks the phone shut. Sometimes inside him uncoils. He swallows, his throat still tight, and sends a quick text to Sammy.
Dean’s eyes are bright green and shining with something tender that Cas has only seen a handful of times before. The sides of his eyes are creased with laugh lines. Cas’ fingertips tingle. Dean’s lips look smooth, and they shine where he’s licked them dry. Cas wonders how they’d feel.
His heart is up in his mouth as he puts the phone up to his ear. It rings once. Twice. Dean is pretty sure he's going to actually be sick. What a waste of Bobby's--
poster hangs on the far wall. The only thing organized in his room is the stack of torn envelopes sitting on his desk.
Somewhere along the prayer, Castiel had pressed his hands close to him, so Sam’s palm was clasped against his chest, feeling the rhythm of Castiel’s heartbeat. Castiel breathes as deep as he can. Sam follows the rise and fall of Cas’ chest with his eyes, even when Castiel turns away and coughs. They sit like this until the prayer fades from their mouths. Eventually, Castiel shivers.
Oh, but he hears that loud and clear.
Castiel thinks, feeling his gut squeeze at the thought of his mother. He tilts his head up, spotting the moon glimmer from behind some wispier clouds. Some of the light comes down in streams, leaving a strip of the sky pale blue. Castiel wonders if his mother is looking, too. She's only two floors below him, he could very well go down and check. If he were feeling reckless, he would even jump down from the roof, like he had done a handful of times in his earlier days.
“Sorry,” He apologizes, turning off the tap, “Uh. I got used to it, you know.” He looks away, sheepish. But Adra has a small smile tugging at the corner of her mouth.
Dean trudges his way up the front steps, bathed in the yellow porch light. The snow falling around him makes him glow yellow-gold. Cas follows him up until they're both standing at the front door. Everything is quiet when they stop walking. Dean steps closer to him.
”Oh.” Cas echoes. He opens his eyes again. Dean is biting his lip, one hand resting beside Castiel’s hip.
His phone vibrates beside him. Speak of the devil, it’s a call from Cas.
“Mm. Sorry, dude, I have a big, uh, fuckin’ bruise there,” Dean says. Cas withdraws his hand. He remembers the slam when Dean hit the wall, the loud, breathy noise Dean wasn’t aware he had made. Cas blinks rapidly a few times. “I am sorry,” he says. Dean answers with a peck on the lips.
"John's--" an alcoholic, falling apart, wasting away, killing himself constantly. "John's good, real good. He misses you. We all do.Except Sammy, he's too busy raving about
”Shit, I didn’t know they were doing that now,” Dean says, grimacing. He shifts his position.
The rest of the mantle is still covered in dust. Tucking the three picture frames under his arm, Castiel runs a hand over the smooth wood. The dust flutters everywhere, irritating Cas' nose again.
The whole ride down the highway, Dean's mind cycles between Sammy and trying-not-to-think-about-Sammy. Guns N' Roses is turned up as high as the old radio will let it. Twice, Dean nearly runs a red light. It isn't until he turns onto Main Street that he realizes he's going fifteen over his usual speed. To his surprise, Sam is already waiting on the front steps when he gets to the school ten minutes early. Dean turns down the music a few notches as Sam slides into his seat.
He fumbles with the buttons for a second, startled out of his reading trance. The watch face glows a bright 8:32 PM, but Dean can't for the life of him remember why he set it. He runs a hand through his hair, listening to the loud sheet of rain overhead. His hair is slick, not just from the rain, and it leaves his hand with a coat of oil.
Dean saunters in ten minutes late and reeking of marijuana. Cas knows the smell from late nights with Alfie, ones he had long-since forgotten. Dean doesn’t give Cas a second glance when he takes a seat across the room, with Jace. She greets him with a slender hand on his bicep and a kiss on his cheek.
Cas has a set jaw and tight shoulders. A soldier’s posture.
”That’s right, dude, it’s your birthday! I totally forgot!” Ash says, smacking himself on the forehead.
It's then that Jace walks in, swinging her hips like she was born to. On any other day, it would send Dean reeling, but today he barely notices. He taps his foot on the leg of his desk, but stops short. He cracks his knuckles when they start to shake.
He finds no Bible, so instead he digs into his closet for a nice shirt to wear. The one he picks out is a light blue and buttons up, so it doesn’t get caught on his glasses, which happens a lot. he runs a hand through his hair.
“Um. Yes. They do,” Cas says.
Sam scrambles up. Gabe swishes his tail at them.
“When is he not?” Sam scowls, scraping eggs out onto his own plate. He's not wrong: Dad's out hunting or working more often than he's home. But Dean never really thinks about it, that's just the way it is.
”Thank you, Dean.” Cas manages to croak out, his voice made of sandpaper. He eases himself back down. Everything aches. He watches Dean put the bowl down on the coffee table.
Of course, Castiel knows what he really wants to do is touch Dean. To run his hands through Dean’s short hair, down his chest and a few other places, and touch him like he hasn’t been allowed to before. Castiel wants to fall to his knees and pray to the altar of Dean Winchester’s body. Claps his hands around Dean like he’s clutching a rosary, whispering prayers into Dean’s freckled skin.
so strongly that Cas’ heart might jump out of his chest. He feels much too warm in all the wrong ways.
Dean’s phone buzzes beside him. He has exactly thirty-three unread messages from Cas. He figures now is as good a time as any to read them.
Not enough smoke. Dean isn't sure how long he stands outside like that, ignoring his shivering for just long enough to finish a couple cigs and not caring if the teacher chews him out for it.
He pauses, glancing at the clock and shutting his eyes. It's nearly three in the morning. Even with his eyes resting closed, and he can feel the moonlight drifting into his room lazily, as though it knows how readily it will be welcomed and takes its time arriving. Castiel decides to greet it properly, opening his eyes to flick off his desk lamp. He turns towards the window, squinting through the new-found darkness.
Castiel’s stomach lurches to his throat. His coat comes off. It is cold. But the hand returns to his back. Cas is fairly certain he lets out a groan, but he can’t be too sure. Everything wavers.”Whenever I get sick,” Dean’s voice comes again, “Mom would always make me tomato-rice soup. I tried to make some for you, but something was crawling through the rice, and I didn’t wanna risk it.” The hand leaves Cas’ back. “I think we have some chicken soup in the pantry somewhere. Yeah.” He thinks for a moment. It feels like it’s years before Cas hears “Yeah, you hang on.” And all at once, Dean’s presence is gone from beside Castiel. His brain blurs.
Then, it’s Dean’s turn. The beeps on the monitors are slowing. Sam gives up his chair, and Dean sits down in it. It’s warm from Sam, which would normally be gross, but Dean really can’t think about anything right now. Castiel watches him sit. Dean reaches up and brushes Castiel’s hair out of his eyes. His hair is sweaty and caked in grease; Castiel hadn’t much energy to shower the last few days. Dean runs his fingers down Cas’ cheek, which are sharp and hollow.
”I admit I haven’t been thinking about it much,” Cas answers, glancing down at the flowers in his lap.
”That would be very ill-advised.” Cas peeks into the cabinet. There are a handful of spices, a small flask of something, and half a container of white vinegar. Cas reaches for the vinegar. “I have an idea.”
EDITED 11 DECEMBER 2014
Cas folds his legs cross-legged beside Dean, setting the box down between his knees. The glossy photos in the box wait patiently for him. He looks back up, at the windows. Light is streaming in, making the dust particles in the air shine. Goosebumps prickle on Cas’ arm, though he barely notices them. Cas swallows; it does not go down easy.
”Thanks, asshole.” Charlie hits him over the head. “C’mon, I’ll take your stuff upstairs.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Can you not?” Dean snaps. Castiel tilts his head to the side, reigning in a second shiver.
”You’ll what? AC/DC me to death?”
Cas starts to apologize again and doesn’t. He kisses Dean, more urgently. This is Dean. He has stubble on his jaw, scratching Cas with each kiss. Dean, who smells of pine deodorant and car oil, twining their tongues together in the wet, airy space between their teeth. Cas nips Dean’s tongue and his bottom lip. Dean presses stubble-sharp kisses on Cas’ jaw. Dean’s hair is freshly shampooed, some coconut and flower concoction he would never admit to liking. The kisses he trails down Cas’ neck are open-mouthed and swirled tongue.
“Miss Novak,” Dean pants, “I’m sorry. For uh, barging in. I just--”
Parking is a non-issue: no one comes ever comes on a Monday. The wind stings their bare skin when they step out of the car. Sam pulls his jacket tighter around himself. Dean grabs the flowers from the front seat, cursing when the thorns stab at his fingertips.
”Yeah, but… What?” Dean doesn’t understand. He looks at all the other table guests. Cas is just a clueless as him, and Sam has that smug eyebrow raise that makes Dean want to shove his face into the whole rest of the cake.
There’s only one card for both flowers.
It reminds Dean of his mother Mary. Gentle. Sad. Dean’s heart pounds in his ears.
Leia whines and sits by the stairs, her tail thumping against the floor. Dean wipes his face off with his sleeve.
Adra’s car is cramped and the music is too quiet, some dramatic classical piece that Jo taps her fingers along to. They’re halfway to the hospital when Dean remembers.
"I'll be honest," Bobby says, handing Dean a beer. "I expected you two here a lot sooner." Dean tsks.
”I do not see how. Sam hasn’t stopped mentioning it.” Dean smiles.
Jess doesn't reply after that. A second picture message from Charlie shows up a few minutes later: a chainmail vest splayed out on Charlie's bed. Dean squints; it looks like the vest is made out of soda tabs.
Cas straightens up, looking directly at Ash. “My apologies. But I am back now.” He looks over at Dean, who is staring at the potluck pile. Ash looks between the two of them.
"We're in here, Sammy, everyone's a'okay." Dean calls back.
He has been chatting with Dean and Jo idly during their English class all week, but it's only today that they asked him to join them for lunch.
“Okay, then,” Castiel says. He clears his throat. He coughs, “The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me lie down in green pastures.”
Dean's backpack nearly drags him down to the ground, it's so damn heavy this morning. In fact, everything feels heavy, from his backpack to the thick fog settled on the ground outside. The door to the Shop room swings shut violently loud behind him. Dean can't be bothered to flinch. He sighs when he sits down, wanting a cig between his fingers and a cloud of smoke to billow out in front of him.
What a word, 'yes'.
"Have I shown you those?" Dean points to his mirror, where photographs are stuck to it. They move closer. Most of the photos are of Dean, standing with a red-haired young woman that Cas doesn't recognize. "This is my buddy Charlie. I met her way back when we lived down in Texas, even though we're both from Lawrence." Dean explains. Cas looks closer: the girl always has a smile. Dean's finger moves to the photo below that: Charlie with her arm around a dark-skinned girl in a purple dress. "And that's her girlfriend, Gilda. Dean's eyes are gleaming just from looking at the photos, and he's got a proud sort of smile.
"No." He tries to spit the taste out, but it only grows. "Only what Dean tells me sometimes, and even then." Sam tries to brush it off. "What about you? You live with your mother, right?" It's Castiel's turn to freeze. He stiffens, straightening his back. It reminds Sam of Dean.
Dean groans, again.
Luke moves on, giving Sam a once-over before shaking his hand. Dean presses close to his little brother once Luke wanders off.
"Dad isn't even here!" The silence that follows proves it true enough. Dean huffs, rubbing his fingers together like he's trying to hold something that isn't there.
“It's nothing." Castiel defends. The wrong thing, again. He can almost feel his mother recoil. She pulls her mug closer.
John rises quicker than he should have. John and Sam glare daggers into each other from across the room.
”Hey Chuck, how about a round of Bad Fic Bingo?”
"Don't worry about him, Miss Novak, we've got it covered." Dean assures her, giving a salute. To Cas' surprise, Adra smiles.
”Gilda,” she introduces herself, holding out her hand. Ruby takes it and leads them to their booth. Dean sits across from the two girls, who have started holding hands again.
Castiel hands the photo over to Dean, who stares at it for a long moment. He looks like he’s trying to find something else in the photograph, something that Castiel didn’t tell him. He puts it aside, though, laying it in front of him.
He can still feel dream Cas’ breath on his neck. He shudders.
was the way Sam had put it.
"Okay. Okay, good." Dean nods. Something like relief settles into his bones.
And Dean and Castiel are kissing. Dean’s lips chapped and sticky on Cas’, warm and soft with a swipe of wet that makes Dean’s heart squeeze. Their mouths move together, a better rhythm than their feet could. They are slow, both a little unsure. Dean drops his hands and holds both against Cas’ hips, pulling him close so their whole body’s line up. Castiel is warm, warm, warm and his tongue is slick, curling against Dean’s. Castiel carts a hand over the back of Dean’s head.
The Legos in the heater rattle around as Dean speeds off down the road. Sam keeps rubbing his hands together, huffing. The engine makes a scraping sound when Dean rounds a corner a little too fast.
. So Cas straightens his back, tightens his shoulders. Another sharp inhale. His chest hurts.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Cas,” Adra says, voice gravelly. She reaches over to Castiel’s hands and envelopes them. Her fingers are cool under his throbbing bruises. “Your friends know you are sick, don’t they?”
Chapter warnings: fantasy/medieval violence, mentions of animal abuse, mentions of death and smoking
Sam watches him close the toaster door, check his phone --nothing--, and check his phone again as soon as he pockets it. Nothing. Damn it. Sam starts to ask something, but is interrupted by a rough voice.
The entire house is dark, save for the single lamp they have on the floor next to them, illuminating the chess board between them. Dean went to bed close to an hour ago, trying to sleep off his inevitable hangover. It wasn't long after that Sam pulled out his chess board, and they've been playing ever since. Cas has one two games already, and there was a draw on the last one.
“Jo and Ash are here,” Sam says. His glasses are still around his neck. Dean finishes his water and crushes the bottle.
"Brady this morning. He just, why does he have to
"Is this really how we're gonna spend New Year's Eve?" Dean asks. His voice is loose, his shoulders drooping just a bit. Sam angles himself to face his brother.
The funeral and reception.
flashes in his head. Cas' look of sorrow just then will be burned onto the back of his eyes for years to come.
Castiel didn’t realize that Dean’s hand was on top of his, until it isn’t any more.
"Sure is," Sam agreed, feeling his heart still fluttering.
Sam’s chest tightens. There’s an SD card on his desk, that he’s been moving photos onto his computer with over the last couple months.
”We all decided to pitch in,” Ellen answers, gesturing to Sam and John.
Sam's upper lip quivers.
”No, no, it’s alright,” Sam insists, shaking his head. “I understand. I haven’t been to a real church since I was seven, and even then…” Cas looks at him.
"You are doing very well," Cas whispers to him.
“Will do, captain.”
"This year's yer turn, Sammy," Dean barely gets out through his howls of laughter. Sam rolls his eyes hard.
"Yeah, yeah I get you."
The brakes squeak when Dean pulls up to the curb in front of the diner.
”Are you ready to go?” He asks. Sam swallows.
“Dean.” Sam hails him from over in the kitchen. Dean watches John take another swallow, then goes to help his brother. His hand goes to Sam's shoulder, peering over him at the page he's working on. A whole lot of nothing, it looks like. “Get this,” Sam says as he pulls out a rubric, a few lines highlighted with a dying yellow marker. “We have this project in shop and we've gotta design something out of wood. Problem is, I've got no idea what to do.”
Despite being shrouded by clouds, the sun still manages to seep into the house. The more eggs Sam makes, the brighter the kitchen becomes. When it reaches eight in the morning, Cas excuses himself to go find his inhalers.
There are warm, sweat-sticky hands running down Dean’s abdomen, and a tightness in his gut that makes him buck and writhe. Someone is hot and solid over top of him, moving strong hands against Dean’s bare cock in sturdy, languid jerks. The figure pants against his neck, sliding his teeth along Dean’s collarbone. Dean feels himself jerk against the figure’s hands, until the hand moves away to press right below Dean’s throat.
Dean squints. Cas’ eyes have dark shadows under them. His lips, beautiful, dark, usually smooth and dry, okay Dean focus, his lips are cracking, even though Dean’s seen him practically eat the tube of chapstick on his desk. And he’s pale; None of his usual rosiness is there.
Mrs. Leonard continues for her partner. “You'll be reading the original novel, and writing a speech on it with a partner.” The room springs up with chatter and everyone turns to face their friends. Dean meets Jo's eyes from over the head of some lanky kid in a trenchcoat. He flashes her a grin and she nods.
”You may consider this an early birthday gift, if you’d like,” Cas tells him.
“Uh--”
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean mutters, then kisses Cas’ chest again. And lower, Dean trails his mouth over Cas’ sternum, around the curve of his ribs, licks an unfortunately ticklish spot near Cas’ navel. Cas yelps and shoves Dean without thinking. Dean stills, and Castiel tries to sit up and apologize, but a hacking cough comes out instead. Cas shoves his nose into his forget-me-nots, and coughs, and coughs. His face grows warm. With his free hand, he gropes around the nightstand. He finds smooth skin of the tissue box, and the loose pages of his book, but not what he’s looking for.
But what can a soldier do when the battle is inside him?
”They may take our lives, but they’ll never take our freedom!” Dean belts in his final, heavy breath. Nerds of all ages are whooping and shouting, hoisting their swords and archery bows above their heads. There are Moondoor knights, a handful of Fairies, and even an Elf or two in the mix.
”When Gabriel died, I had already been discharged, but I was still visiting him every so often. So naturally, when I come to find out he had passed, I was as distraught as a ten-year-old could be. But Luc, well… I remember standing outside in the hallway,” Cas points to the picture again. “The next thing I knew, Luc was being taken out of the room by force. That was the last I saw of him. Two nurses had to be taken to the ER.”
Cas thinks for a moment. His thoughts go down to the photographs spread out of the floor. There was a story that Anna told him once, about angels in heaven. He tells this to Dean.
“You're already fat enough, jerk.” Sam waves the spatula at him. But his face falls. “Hey, Dean?”
Cas winds up making stew for the trio. While it's simmering on the stove, Sam suggests opening presents.
“Let’s go for a walk, Dean,” Cas says. He coughs. Dean swallows. Cas has a knuckle-white grip on the railing. Dean sticks out his bare arm and Cas closes his skeletal fingers around it. Cas’ hand is cold.
"I had an English project."
"So, Jess," Ellen starts, trying to strike up a conversation. "What do you do?"
"No, stupid, there was a blood drive."
It dawns on Cas that he forgot his shirt. Too late, now. He takes the lid off the box.
Castiel, standing with Dean at the Winchester’s Christmas tree. While Dean sips a soda and glints at the camera, Castiel fixes Dean with a stare. Castiel is open-mouthed and red faced, looking like Dean is someone he cherishes. Worships. Loves. Dean reaches out and touches the photograph. It sticks to the pads of his fingers. Castiel loved him, then. Castiel loved him. Castiel loved him.
He takes his final jacket layer off once he starts to sweat again. He remembers why he hates the heater. Something heavy in the pocket swings down and bumps his arm. He remembers the blue book as soon as he pulls it out. The cover got splattered with a few drops of rain, but it's still in decent shape.
Dean just glares. His face feels warm, and it’s not from the armor this time.
Dad didn't come home from his night out drinking. Which happens often enough, but never at the beginning of the week. Dean half-heartedly checks the date, to see if his calendar was right this mor-- Oh. November 2nd.
Movement. Cas shuts his eyes. He can't see straight. Dizzy. And then air. Sweet, frosty air choking on the way down. He coughs. He's standing up. How did he get up? He's so cold. There's a hand on his back. Warm. The hand is warm.
The pages are faded with age, smelling like mothballs and ink.
He snaps a photo before sneaking back to the kitchen table.
“But yeah, uh, we wrote about how Victor Frankenstein represents God and the monster, sorry, creature, is all Earth’s people. Honestly, Victor’s kind of a dick. Sorry, teach, but he is. He’s too smart for his own good, like, he could’ve been a revolutionary scientist, you know, and what does he do? He shuts himself away for months and steals bodies from graveyards. Not the kind of God I’d want, I don’t know about you. And he does this for months without even thinking about what it all means, you know? So when he’s done with his, heh, project, he’s totally overwhelmed and he hates himself.
Something slick and hard slides against Dean’s hip: the person’s dick, pulsing. Dean’s mouth waters. He’s able to move his hands, so he runs them over the other man’s hips, nearly losing it the way he grinds down on Dean’s cock. There’s a scar sitting right above the man’s hip. Dean presses his thumb against it, and the man lets out a hiss.
”But you’re alright? I mean, you’re okay?” Maybe his worry bleeds into his voice, because Cas puts his burger down before answering.
Dean’s lips meet Cas’ cock through the condom, and licks a stripe up to Cas’ head. Cas grabs at Dean’s hair. Dean mouths Cas’ dick, swirling tongue around his head. Finally, finally, finally, Dean swallows him. Dean’s mouth is wet, and warm, and he tongues at Cas as best he can. He bobs up and down on Castiel, each suck smoother than the last. His cheeks hollow with each suck; his mouth is wide to keep his teeth out of the way. They snag a little, and Cas makes a disapproving noise, and Dean hums an apology around Cas’ head and then it’s fine, it’s all fine. Dean strokes one hand down to the base of Cas’ cock where his mouth can’t reach. Cas’ head spins. Dean is fucking beautiful.
“Is this charades? 'Cause Sammy, you suck.” Dean grins. “Are you tryin' to woo Jess or somethin'? Just mention you're my brother, that'll get her going.” A wad of paper hits him in the head. “Okay, fine. What kind of lady is she?” Sam scrunches up his face, trying to remember.
Rummy barks over the chatter in Bobby's kitchen. Sam is busy setting the table up. Everyone else is standing around chatting. Jo scratches Rummy behind the ears. Dean leans back on the counter, listening more to the bubbling of the soup than any of the conversations around him. He doesn't miss Bobby cursing under his breath, though.
The movie opens on a deer in the woods and an angsty speech from an out-of-frame narrator. Snore.
“I didn’t either.” Cas says. “I am a faucet, I guess.” They all laugh.
”Hell yeah,” Dean says, flopping down on the bed next to Cas. “I can’t wait to see Charlie, haven’t seen her since…” He does the math, “Fuck, last June or so.” Cas shifts his position, his hand resting on Dean’s ankle. Dean sits up and scoots closer. Cas’ hand doesn’t move.
"And how would you know?" Dean raises an eyebrow, as if he expects Cas to be messing with him.
”Sam, how are you?” He asks, friendly.
Castiel stumbles after jumping through the trap door; he has to freeze to collect himself before carrying on. It isn't until he gets to the bathroom near the stairs that he notices just how acrid the cigarette made him smell. He tries not to look at himself in the mirror, grabbing both his red and blue inhalers and a couple of his pill bottles out of the medicine cabinet. But he pauses, just before he walks out the door. The railing next to the toilet gleams in the florescent light. Castiel's hands shake. He wonders what Dean would think.
rings in Cas' ears.
There’s a moment of silence where Dean does nothing more than look at Castiel. The way he scans his hands with his eyes, the slow blink that brings his gaze back up to the table, and then to Dean. His backwards tie, that Dean’s hands are itching to fix. Or just to tug off him. Dean looks at Castiel, and he
”Pie’s almost done,” Mrs. Bradbury says. “I’m making your favorite!” Dean gives her another kiss, just for that.
"Excuse me?"
“Excuse me?” John sneers. “What did you say to me?”
Please comment. Let me know ur feelings.
”You got here okay?” She asks, holding him back at arm’s length. Neither of them can stop grinning long enough to say a whole lot.
”Nah,” Dean says, leaning back on his hands. It takes some of the pressure off his back. The hair from his wig falls over his shoulder; he wonders if this is how Sam’s head feels all the time. “The royal family and I go way back, but I live a few hours away. It was big for me to even get to come here.”
“We are doing everything we can, believe you me,” Cas says. Dean feels Cas’ voice vibrate against his fingertips. Dean rubs the spine bumps protruding there. Cas leans forward. Dean pulls back, his hand falling away.
As gently as he can, so as not to disturb the silence further, he drops to his knees. The floorboards are well worn; he runs his finger along the once-shined-up wood, already having memorized all the scrapes and scratches along the floor. He stops as he feels the indent he's looking for.
"Oh Lord, greetings. Good evening, I feel I should say, although it is hardly evening any more. I will begin this message the same way I begin all things, with thanks. I would like to thank You for my loving mother, this house, these books, and for... For this day, that I may cherish it and use it to help do Your will. The day is a gift, as I have long-since come to realize, and I should treat it as such." Castiel tilts his head up without opening his eyes. He doesn't need to, nothing in the room moves without him. There is no breeze on the other side of the window, as is common for this time of year. Silence. All at once, Castiel feels as if his words have been stolen from him. "A-amen." He ends his prayer clumsily. 	Castiel feels he should say more, but he knows he can't. But it's no matter, the Lord will understand everything he doesn't say. Can't say.
”You can’t drink, right?” He asks Cas without turning around. Cas goes up behind him, watching him rifle through the cabinet. He puts his chin on Dean’s shoulder. He did not realize just how much taller Dean is.
”Your Majesty,” one of the other knights in the room says. Sir Dean can’t remember his name. “what if we kept Sirs Posey and Roger--”
“I’ve been meaning to paint this room for years,” Adra says with a shrug, leaning over the other side of the island on her elbows, “What’s that you have?” She gestures to the box, covered in a thin dish towel. Dean adjusts his seat. He clears his throat.
All the lights are on in the kitchen, and something smells
"Cas is here!" Dean shouts into the house. Castiel leaves his shoes by the door, settling himself in comfortably. He follows Dean in to the kitchen. There are a few strings of lights hung up around the room and over the refrigerator, twinkling like the stars. Over in the living room, a flimsy but very real Christmas tree stands in the corner. A couple of decorations hang off of it precariously, but for the most part it is bare. Sam is lying on the living room couch, holding
They shake hands. Ru’s is warm and smooth.
He checks, nearly four AM. No one would be awake now.
”Bottoms up!”
Castiel finds Dean the moment he walks back through the door. Something is troubling him; his eyebrows are furrowed and he is staring down at something in his lap. He looks up to give Castiel a smile, but it is shaky. Jo and Ash, however, seem utterly unphased.
Before Dean can process that any further, there’s a knock at the door.
”Why did I agree to this again?” Dean leans over to ask Cas.
"Unfortunately so."
“Yeah,” she grits out, her voice high. She squeezes little moons into her palms, “Thanks for coming.” Castiel smiles at her, his eyes so, so blue and shining. Jo collapses, her shoulders shaking. Ash comes up behind her and squeezes her shoulders. She stays for a moment, looking at the monitors and the TV and everywhere but Castiel, and then Ash leads her into the background.
Dean really wants to say something else, but he puts his phone away. He turns to Charlie’s desk. Her laptop is sitting idle in a sea of sticky notes.
Castiel is grateful when Sam leans up and flicks off the light, leaving the only blue of the television and the cracks in the window blinds. Cas squints at the TV. Spaceships, something called the Death Star, and a princess. It sounds like an intriguing tale. Castiel settles between the two brothers. Dean finds Castiel’s thigh, then his hand, and every so often Dean presses a kiss to their joined fingers. An android whirrs and beeps on screen; Castiel has to squeeze his eyes shut. He sips his water.
As it turns out, Dean has very little interest in much going on in the class, Castiel included. Castiel sees him take his phone out almost immediately, and spend the rest of class tapping away on the small phone keyboard. The only time Dean interacts with him is when he asks to meet at the library again after school. Castiel agrees, and Dean goes back to his phone.
The next group was one he liked the best, despite the fiery pain as the artist reached the crook of his elbow: thick-stemmed flowers with heart-shaped lilac petals.
Bobby comes by, beard trimmed and his person decked in a loose black flannel. He’s left his hat off, so his bald spot shines. He spends a long time kneeled by Castiel, and when he comes up Dean swears his eyes are wet for an instant before he blinks it away. Bobby gives Adra a hug, which surprises everyone in line except Adra. She hugs him back, loose but familiar. They murmur together for a few moments before Bobby turns towards Dean.
When Castiel looks up from reading his texts, Dean is giving him a look that Cas can only describe as being full of sorrow. Cas decides right then that Dean should never have that look on his face again, it does not suit him the slightest.
The Shop room door shuts with a heavy clang, making Castiel wince. As soon as he's in his seat, his book is back in his hand. He glances up only when a few stray students file into the room. Hardly anyone bothers to show up on time, not that the teacher would be bothered either way. But this morning, someone catches Castiel's eye. Leaning back in his chair with his feet resting up on the table, a student in a brown leather jacket is waiting patiently for everyone else to arrive.

"Sure, kid." Bobby goes back to his soup.
"This was your idea, you're on your own."
Dean tears himself away to look at his own bowl of macaroni. It’s steaming, and there are little breadcrumbs sprinkled on top. Dean’s mouth waters for a totally different reason, now.
John blinks.
“Hey, Dean?” Sam asks from the other side of the table. Dean looks up. “Can I get help with something?” His eyes dart over to their dad, like he needs to make sure he's actually asleep. Dean gestures at him to go on. “Well, uh, how do you--” He makes a vague hand gesture. “You know, when you're trying to get attention from-- I mean...” He twirls hair around one of his fingers, as if that'll help Dean figure him out.
Dean runs a hand through his hair three more times and thinks maybe he should have gotten flowers, before he yanks the door open to reveal a very well-put-together Castiel, holding a fresh bouquet. They shuffle inside.
Castiel doesn’t know if he hits the floor.
“My first wife had health complications a couple years into our marriage,” She says. Dean nods, dumbly. He can’t do this. He can’t fucking do this.
A few minutes later, there’s a short knock at the door. Sam’s pulse beats in his throat. He yanks the door open with a little too much force. His hands start shaking, but he blames the cold.
Castiel doesn't want to look away from the phone while his message sends.
"Forget it." He kills the engine, leaning back in his seat. "Ain't you cold?" he asks, gesturing to Cas' single-layer trenchcoat. Dean shrugs his own jacket off and hands it to Cas, who just looks at him. "Shit!" Dean exclaims. Cas jumps. "Wow, fuck, I'm sorry Cas, I totally kidnapped you just now. The fuck am I doing, you were probably busy doing--" he looks at Cas again, who's putting Dean's jacket on under his coat. "Whatever you were doing."
"Castiel, right?"
”I’m really glad you’re back. Dean’s been a
what time it is?"
”The hell is this?”
. He tears the top off greedily. A couple of photos fall out : girl with long red hair wearing a suit of armor stands next to a darker skinned girl in a purple dress, both of them smiling. The back is labeled “Charlie and Gilda” in Sharpie, with a heart next to it. Dean smiles when he reads it. The other photo is of him and Charlie, the red head, last time he saw her about six months ago. He's wearing some costume chain mail and face paint, full-body laughing at something his friend had said, the sunlight behind him making the whole photo glow orange. He longs for the smell of firewood and the hot, dry air of Charlie's hometown. He doesn't see her nearly enough.
”Cold,” Sam answers honestly, earning a chuckle. “But I’m well. Yeah, thank you, Father.” The pastor turns to Castiel and his face lights up.
”How have y’all been?” Ruby asks, mostly to Dean.
"Awesome," Dean says with a sigh. The next puff of smoke she breathes directly into his mouth, their lips barely grazing. She rests a hand on his thigh.
They sit in silence for a very long minute. The Exit sign at the end of the hall mocks them with it’s steady glow. Dean hates hospitals. He wants a cigarette.
Castiel pauses. "Yes. I would like that."
"If you quit smoking, for good, I will too."
”Man, I was gonna offer you a shot of whiskey or three.”
“Angelic,” She finishes for him.
Outside the building, the air is refreshingly cool. A small gaggle of freshmen are gossiping about who so-and-so is going to ask out, and another group is ragging about how fast they drove away from a party once the cops rolled up. Pretending to tie his shows, Castiel stops to listen to them for a minute. They talk a lot about getting "smacked" or "wasted", which Castiel thinks sounds more painful than pleasant.
”Good morning, Sam.” The woman smiles when she talks. Her eyes look heavy in the same was Castiel’s do.
Bobby's dog, a lunking idiot Rottweiler he calls Rumsfeld, whines and scratches at the back door. The house shakes with a nasty howl of wind, but Dean let's Rummy out the back door anyway. Dean's phone buzzes in his pocket: a text, from a  number he doesn't recognize.
Oh. Right.
Dean walks up to the coffin, meticulous about where he places his feet. Cas would chastise him for clomping around too loud, waking from his much-needed rest. So Dean walks slow. There’s a little cushioned bench to kneel on in front of the casket. Dean considers fumbling through a prayer. Cas looks asleep if Dean doesn’t look too hard. He's same sort of relaxed Dean got used watching. In the dead of night, with the moonlight falling in streaks through the window. Castiel snored and Dean watched, his heart aching against his ribs.
"Dean." Cas looks to him with worry in his eyes. "Take a seat." Dean drops to the ground, letting the bottle crash unceremoniously to the ground and shatter. It doesn't smell like beer, it's more potent. Something in Sam's stomach is grinding, the same way it was when Jess let Gabe into the house.
Sunlight shines at Dean from between the trees. Good lord, does his stringy wig itch. His face feels like it’s going to peel off under the red and white paint.
another part replies,
Sam stands at the same time Dean does, yawning and telling Dean he's heading to bed. Dean calls him a pussy, it's not even nine o'clock yet! Sam just glares and trudges off. Heading back to his room as well, Dean tosses the book onto the bed next to his phone. He strips down and wraps a towel around his waist.
But it is not time yet.
Dean ruffles Sam's floppy hair and tells him they'll be staying a while. Sam's smile only widens when he spots Castiel across the room, waving excitedly. Dean's look of surprise isn't hard to spot, either. Sam walks in step with his brother. Castiel greets him with a nod, and Sam excuses himself to go elsewhere. Dean is left, standing right in front of Castiel, looking much taller than he has before.
“You got that right. Come on, it’s starting.”
”We were gonna get you a plane ticket,” Sam finally speaks up, “but we all know how you’d feel about that.”
“Dean, would you like to meet Adra?” Cas asks suddenly.
Sam shakes his head.
”You sure you’re okay?” Something in Dean’s voice is very warm. Cas doesn’t want it to go away.
He chuckles to himself in the dark, knowing that he's not being all that funny.
Emetophobia warning for this chapter, mentions of food/eating, mentions of recreational drug use (marijuana), illness, and blood.
“Will that be a problem?” She puts down the knife and leans over the island, eyebrows raised slightly. “I can stay, if you would like.”
Pastor Jim asks if anyone else would like to say something. The air in Dean’s lungs is too tight, too high. The podium is empty, the Bible splayed open, waiting, red. Dean gets up. This is it. This is it. He balls his hands into fists. The podium creeps closer. The Bible is still open.
”I see.” Perhaps the most stilted sentence Dean has ever said to him. Cas blinks. Dean blinks. “Well, let’s get to it then.”
“Hey, hey,” Dean puts his hands up.

“Acanthus, for art. Jo’s recital. Jess.” Dean’s laughter. Sam’s eyes.

than the cereal crumbs on the kitchen floor.
“Uh. A gift for you, if you’d like it,” Dean says, twirling his ring, “A few months ago, Sammy picked up a stray cat during a bad rainstorm. Well, to be honest, the stray kind of picked us up. He’s been great and all, but I’m allergic, and my dad-- Well, we figured you’d be better off taking care of a cat than us.” Dean rolls the towel back, revealing the tan cat carrier and a grouchy Gabe's pupils narrowing in the light. Dean unhooks the carrier door, and Gabe creeps out, sniffing around. Adra watches him, wide-eyed. Dean sneezes.
"Right."
”Maybe some other time,” Ruby winks. Someone back in the kitchen whistles for her to come back.
“Normal, eh?” Dean asks, kissing the top of Castiel’s head, “I think we can do that.”
”I get the feeling that you would have liked my friend Anna.” Cas says. “I was twelve when she was fourteen. She was independent, to say the least. I believe she had a record for breaking the most hospital rules in the least amount of time. At least, that is what she told me.
Dean swallows an entire mini water bottle in one go. He wishes he brought lotion or something. All this hand shaking is making his hands dry. He fidgets between people. The line doesn’t seem to ever end or shorten; as soon as a handful goes through, three or four more show up at the back. Some of Dean’s classmates show.
He always wondered why Dean never liked coming to church with him.
Sam looks down into his lap.
”Yes, Dean. I am okay.” He smiles again.
”Jesus,” Dean says, scrubbing his face with his palm. He turns the envelope over in his hands again; he’s glad it’s heavy, otherwise he wouldn’t believe it’s real.
It's a Thursday when something changes. It's hardly Thursday yet, only a few minutes past midnight. But the change doesn't come until later. Right now, the cool air from the open window is fluttering across Castiel's skin, sending shivers through his whole body.
Outside the pocket of his bedroom, he hears her voice mix with Castiel's. Sam clambers off his bed to investigate, after hearing the word 'boyfriend' drop from Jess' lips.
, and other novels. He picks up a book of short stories, one he knows he can get through before he has to get up in the morning.
"Since it's Christmas Eve Eve, and you're our guest, you can help us decorate the tree." Dean tells him, taking a beaten up CD case out of one box.
“That's the--” She stops, tilting her head.
"What's it mean, anyway? Your tattoo?" Dean moves a hand out as if to touch Castiel, but instead he folds his arms across his chest. Cas clears his throat.
”I have a cold.” He says, with feeling. There is a weighty pause. And Dean bursts out laughing. If Castiel had the energy to glare, he would have.
Sam had to nudge Dean just now, to remind him to actually close the toaster door. Gabe mews at him.
Queen Charlie keeps her box of armor up in her closet. With some maneuvering, and more than a little swearing, Sir Dean manages to get it down without breaking anything. He gets his own armor out of the duffel bag he brought before helping Queen Charlie into hers. Her tunic has the Moondoor crest sewn over the breast pocket, and Sir Dean helps her put on a belt that he knows she doesn’t just use for holding her daggers. Her magic pouches are tucked away in the bag hanging by her hip. She’s nearly ready for battle, and soon so will be Sir Dean.
“No one else could make it?” Sam asks. He tries to keep his voice even, but the way Jess touches his arm after she puts her canvas down says otherwise.
He spends the next few hours completely enthralled in a world that never existed. He listens as hungry lions growl inside of a Veldt; he weighs the silence on his shoulders when a spaceship explodes and everyone is left to drift in the vast, empty space; he watches as a man's tattoos tell stories along his skin, stories that move and change every time someone knew looks on them. Cas stops reading only when he rolls over to turn his alarm off before it rips through the morning. He uncurls like a cat and gropes along the wall for a minute before finding the light switch. The ceiling fan high above him whirs around, spluttering to life. Over by the windows, early morning light creeps up to the horizon, barely speckling the skyline with color. Fog dusting the rooftops begins to roll out and expand. Castiel can nearly feel the moisture condense in his throat, scraping him raw from the inside. He swallows thickly, followed by a hacking cough. He flies to the windowsill, gripping it knuckle-white to keep him from losing himself.
”I just…” He sighs, leaving a warm prickle on the back of Cas’ neck. “I thought that… Well, I didn’t think that… I mean, I….” Dean presses his forehead into Cas’ shoulder.
Dean’s eyes are soft, and his brows are peaked in a worry triangle. “Fuck, Cas.” And he kisses him fervently, open-mouthed, wet. Cas responds in kind, snaking a hand up to cup Dean’s jaw, and another to squeeze his shoulder. Dean makes a small noise, not entirely pleasured.
Jo comes on stage as he slides back into his seat. Even so close to the stage, Cas has to do a double take. Her hair is pinned in tight curls, stuck together with a blue netted thing with beads dangling from it. She has on a dress that’s shimmering blue, off the shoulder, and short white gloves that she sets out the sheet music with. Then, she plays.
"Yes, it's very good," Adra says. "I haven't heard him say so in..." She clears her throat. "Well." Dean feels like he can't quite hear something in her voice. There's a pause. "Is there anything else?"
The comment catches Dean by surprise.
"Shit!" They hear Dean exclaim. Castiel whips around to see the top half of the Christmas tree in flames, smoke billowing up to the low ceiling. Castiel coughs, the air in the trailer growing thick.
"My opinion on the matter is irrelevant."
A dark blue scarf falls into Cas' lap. He holds it up to the light, shrouding him in a thin blue haze. Dean watches Cas' eyes crinkle as he breaks out into a smile.
”He’s with Jess for the night.”
”Oh, awesome. Glad we’re on the same page.”
The photograph is grainy, focusing more on Castiel’s cigarette than on the boy himself.
The flaps of the tent cough up a small cloud of dust when he goes in. There are already a few people laying on cots. Dean sees the elf from earlier sitting in the corner. His pocket suddenly feels very heavy.
"I..." Words fail him. Cas stares anywhere but Dean: the coils on the stove have gone from blisteringly hot to stark cold since Cas finished his cup of tea, the leaves on the trees outside are blowing up into tiny tornados on the ground. It reminds Cas of something. "I have something to show you." Cas' arm brushes Dean's as he walks past and Cas forgets how to breathe again.
The Milton Diner is as old as the trio combines, and always smells like fresh pie. There’s a waitress named Ruby behind the dessert counter with six piercings and seven tattoos. She has a light, square jaw and dark eyes that light up when the three of them walk in. Charlie lets go of Gilda’s hand to give Ruby a hug.
They have seats near the front. Initially, Sam is in the aisle seat next to Dean, but he trades as soon as Cas suggests it. Cas has two inhalers tucked into his pockets, and if he needs to make a quick getaway he should be on the aisle to do it.
“Don't you worry about that, Sammy," Dean assures him. "Worryin' is my job. I'll give someone a call after school.”
Today, as it’s turning out, means being in Dean’s boiling car with a staticky radio and Sam complaining every chance he gets, all while Dean says little more than two words and looks in his rearview much more than is strictly necessary.
"Uh, they're for you, dude."
”You’ve still got another one comin’.” She tells him, holding out an envelope.
"Really? This girl you've been pining after for God-knows how long, all you can tell me is that she's
EDITED 3 JUNE 2014
Adra sits down on the edge of Castiel's bed and offers him the mug with bumblebees on it. He takes it with a small nod.
It's only when Dean puts his feet on the wood floor that he notices just how cold it got overnight. His toes go numb almost as soon as they hit the floor. But fuck, is it one way to wake up. His entire body tingles and prickles. Despite the shocking cold, Dean's bare feet drag across the floor. The floorboards near Sam's door creak, reminding him to keep quiet.
”Guess I shoulda seen that one coming.” He grins, crushing Charlie in a hug. “It’s good to see you, kiddo.” He pats her hair; she puts her chin on his shoulder. There’s a lot of squeezing.
"Nah, we bought them at this little shop..." Sam fades out before he can finish his sentence. There's a loud crackling coming from behind him.
Dean drops himself diagonal to Castiel, nodding to Jo and tossing his smushed sandwich onto the pile of food. Ash, mouth already stuffed full of Doritos, gives Cas a one-armed hug and adds in a couple bags of chips.
The ride to the cemetery is short, and the growing silence would be unbearably painful if it were anyone but the Winchester boys in the front seats.
“I uh, I think I need glasses.” He spits it out like it hurts to say, so fast Dean barely catches it. "And I know-- I know they can get expensive, I could just get a cheap pair." Sam tries to justify, sliding his gaze over to their dad's bedroom door. Setting his fork down, Dean takes a deep breath. His brother turns back to him when he speaks.
By lunch time, Castiel’s stomach is empty enough to start hurting on his inhale. He is no longer used to only eating what he packs himself for lunch. His tongue is empty with the want of Roadhouse fries, or sloppy Winchester kitchen sandwiches.
Dean shakes his head. “What? I didn’t do anything.”
“Well,” her lips barely move when she speaks, as if they've been sewn together, “I'll leave you to it then.” He doesn't watch her leave, although everything in him is telling him he should.
“Well, it would seem I have to go change,” She tells him, smiling. She is shaking a little, perhaps from the sudden cold at their loss of contact. He smiles at her, though it’s crooked. She heaves a relieved sort of sigh, and looks at the clock over the stove. “I have work tonight. Business from Japan.” She looks from him to his phone, which is lighting up with a text. “I’m leaving soon, I’ll be back in the morning.”
”Jesus,” Dean splutters, trying to swallow his laughter. “Really? I mean,
The trap-door entrance to his room opens with a creak. The ladder tumbles out and just barely scrapes the floor below. Castiel disregards it entirely and lands with a thud that rattles the floor. The kitchen is two floors below. He stops in the bathroom on the second floor to pop a couple of his pills and take a long swallow of water. Down in the kitchen, there's a loaf of bread left out on the counter and the milk jug is nearly empty. Castiel runs his fingertips along the marble countertop, picking up an apple from a fruit basket and biting into it.
Something's off today, something's
Entering his English class is as close to relief as he knows he's going to come for the day. The rooms smells like new books and smoke. Castiel notices the projector sitting in the corner, waiting for a handyman to come fix it. The boy from his last class, Dean, is eyeing the mechanism with apparent interest, before pulling out his phone and typing something. His presence takes Castiel by surprise.
“Uh, shit. I don’t think so,” Sam says.
Thankfully, morning arrives quickly, greeting Cas with a violent wind that rattles the windows. He stares hard out the windows in the front room, but all the snow makes catching the sunrise impossible. The window is frozen shut, a few ice crystals making frost patterns on the glass. Cas heads back into the kitchen after a minute, surprised to see Sam creeping in. He's still in his clothes from the night before, his glasses nowhere to be seen.
“It is fine,” Adra insists. Gabe has sniffed her hand and is now rubbing the side of his face on her fingertips. Dean leans forward on his elbows.
”Do you ever talk to them any more? I mean, talk to Hael?”
"I see you picked
"Mistletoe?" Sam wonders out loud. He looks down.
He rubs his eyes with the heel of his hand, watching the lights behind them dance, and willing himself to just calm down, damn it. He opens his eyes and stares at the blank ceiling. It’s a lot lower down than Cas’ ceiling. There’s a crack running from the window to halfway across the room. His vision prickles in the dark.
“I’m very sorry, Mister Novak,” The woman says. Dean doesn’t bother correcting her.
“Thanks. Man, Sammy’s gonna be so proud of me. Actually reading somethin’.” Dean says. He takes his free hand and finds Cas’ fingers, twining them together.
“I moved the--” Dean reaches over to grabs the can off the table, just as John starts to reach for it. Dean jerks back like he's been burned, letting John grab the can.
“Oh, I almost forgot, I have food he likes and uh, some other stuff in the car. I’ll be right back.” He goes out and comes back in with Gabe’s food bag, and a blue collar with a jangling bell. He sets them on the island. Adra watches him put them down.
”Fuck off, Cas.”
. A watch alarm goes off. Jo swears, twiddling with her watch until the beeping stops.
”I apologize,” Castiel looks away, bashful. “I didn’t know when Sam’s birthday was.”
Castiel and Dean talk.
When he steps back into his room, Castiel takes his poem off the desk and carefully tucks it into his coat pocket. Down in the kitchen, his mother sits alone at the table, sipping a cup of coffee. She's got some papers in a stack in front of her. She doesn't look up when Castiel grabs a banana off of the fruit stand, only swallows her coffee and tells him to bring an umbrella. Castiel thanks her and heads out the back door.
on SparkNotes later. He remembers teaching Sam how to read at the tender age of four, when Dean himself was eight. Every night, they struggled through the first Harry Potter book aloud, before they both crashed on the couch, or floor, or bed, or wherever they wound up. But they read it, cover to cover. Dean hadn't read a book all the way through since.
CHAPTER WARNINGS: brief sexuality involving penises, sensuality/romance, mentions of injury. And I guess a general warning for Twilight?
“That’s,” Dean says between kisses, “Fuckin’ beautiful, Castiel.”
"Thank you." Cas takes a step away from Dean, once he realizes how close they're standing. Cas can nearly feel Dean's breath on him. He looks at Dean, almost aching to be closer. He looks past Dean, to a box lying on the floor. “I have something to show you.” He makes the decision while he says it.
”Yeah, but… Breasts.” Charlie nuzzles further into his neck.
There is a bitter, angry reply right behind Cas’ teeth. He can feel it, hot and salty, waiting for him to open his mouth and shout.
”Uh,” is all Dean says. In truth, Castiel and Dean had been passing notes back and forth the entire time she was making her announcements.
"I would enjoy that."
After that, more people trickle in, and then a wave of them. A lot of nurses and doctors, a handful of old church women who give Dean confused, lingering looks. Sam introduces himself as Castiel’s brother. Dean doesn’t know what to say, so he lets them draw their own conclusions.
Castiel Novak can't sleep. He hasn't in weeks, not for more than a couple hours a night. But it's been years since he even tried. The world outside his bedroom window is quiet. The silence echoes through all the empty rooms in his house. He inhales slowly, as if disturbing the silence would hurt. He breathes with military precision, not hard enough to force out a cough.
“Now you've done it,” Dean snides from the driver's side, his tone light-hearted.
Silence.
Cas thinks, since he can’t seem to say anything.
Evidently, he has much to learn about their small clique.
“Dude,” Sam says from Cas’ other side, sounding wholly affronted,  “Were you-- are you quoting this movie? As we’re watching it?!”
”I can see that.” Dean smirks. “You look good, man. Cas. You look nice.”
”Miss.” She turns away and starts up the engine. Good thing, too, Sam can already feel the cold creeping in.
Dean moves. He’s in-between the kitchen table and the couch before John can move half a step towards Sam.
"Dad's gonna be home soon."
Cas sits on the left side of the couch, his back rod-straight, staring at the TV like he half-expects a wolf to jump out at him.
Cas looks at Dean and takes another puff.
”That’s not the point!” Dean argues, “The point is… You’ve seen
The cemetery gate swings open and every other thought is banished from his head.
"It's the hair," Ash decides, flipping his mullet over his shoulder. "Only the most bad ass can pull off such a 'do."
It isn't until Cas opens his messages and laughs out loud that he realizes just how empty his house is.
The trellis of roses near the back entrance are called Eden roses. Of course they are. Dean laughs, quiet among the garden. The “Bumblebees Welcome” sign hangs from the back gate, dark with age. Dean frowns. No bees have come by yet, not even to annoy him. They’ll come, he tells himself. A couple of squirrels scampered up the oak tree earlier, so other creatures can’t be far behind. Dean smiles. Dirt grinds under his fingernails. The sun bleeds down through the trees, speckling the leaves and the rare spaces of tall, tall grass beneath them. He can see why Castiel spent so much time here.
Dean nearly floors it back to Cas' house. He apologizes a couple times without quite being sure of what he's saying. Castiel insists that he understands.
Sam stops breathing. He feels like the snow outside got shoved down the back of his shirt and he's not allowed to curse about it. Cas' face falters.
Note: I originally uploaded this chapter a couple of days ago, but since have added a scene and decided to reupload it.
“Yeah,” Sam echoes, “A big day.”
"'Course," Dean manages.
Dean does. It is delicious. It is enough for now.
Dean snorts, then kicks himself for snorting. Cas glares.
Sam shakes his head. He scans his bookshelf for a copy of the Bible, his eyes stopping briefly on the newspaper clipping he hasn’t had the chance to hang up.
“Come on, Sammy, let’s go.”
”There was one night she snuck into my room, sketchbook in tow. She sat on the edge of my bed until sunrise, and we…” Castiel stops, feeling suddenly very far away. He remembers the rustle of leaves through the window, the way the moon watched the two of them together on Cas’ bed. He can almost feel the scratchy hospital blanket under his hands. And Anna’s art, charcoal and pastel, taking his breath away every time she turned a page.
His inhaler is red, and he puffs and holds it twice in a row. Slowly, he exhales.
His phone nearly burns a hole in the fabric of his jeans as he makes his way around the building. He wants to cut his next class, English, to give Bobby a ring, but his last test grade, barely a C, advises him against it. He doesn't need to give his dad any more of a reason to be angry. With a sigh, he makes his way.
"Yeah, Cas, I'd love that."
”Please. So long as you’re doing well?”
paced through all the empty rooms with the grace of the archangels.
"Uh, my partner isn't here," Dean tells her. She frowns, flipping through some papers on a clipboard.
”Sammy!” Dean shouts to his brother, his voice hoarse. “Don’t do vinegar shots!” His tone tells Castiel this piece of information is vitally important.
The desks are all lined up in pairs. Jo is sitting with her partner up at the front of the room, so Dean snags the chair a row behind her. She looks him up and down, brows furrowed. Dean just shrugs, he doesn't have an answer to whatever she's going to ask.
"Cas." Dean says back, mockingly. He looks over at the clock, his expression softening. "Let me be the first to say, Merry Christmas, Cas."
Dean tries to ignore the twinge of disappointment.
”We sat. We existed. She passed a few days later,” Cas continues, “I will admit there was much about her I still do not understand. But, regardless, when she passed, I went out to the playground, and I saw…” He flips the next picture: a crushed pack of Marlboros sitting at the base of an old tree. A single purple flower is springing up out of the carton.
“You’d think a son would have some fucking respect for his father,” John mutters, loud enough so all three of them can hear it. “But I guess that’s a pipe dream in this day and age.”
"I," Castiel starts, his chest feeling tight, "I do not think that is the best idea." Dean steps up beside him, looking from Castiel to his Sam and back.
And then the attention swivels to Cas, who's leaning forward with his elbows resting on his knees.
He tells himself.
Dean has fallen asleep beside him. Cas is grateful, he realizes as he feels a warm tear sliding down his cheek. He flicks it away.
"Excuse me?" Despite being a rather short man, Ice has a large presence when he wants to. Brady gulps.
Sam shakes his head.
”God, no, it’s just…” Dean sighs, loosening up his defensive shoulders. “It’s just a dumb movie, Cas. I don’t wanna watch it.”
The whole world seems to relax. People shrug their cloaks off, untie their belts, whip off their hats. Charlie peels off her leather gloves, and Dean nearly rips his wig in half getting it off his head. Gilda, looking perfect as always, does nothing.
Hey before you read this chapter I want you to take a deep breath, go pet a cat, draw a picture... Call a medical practitioner cause your heart's about to get ripped out :)
“Uh. Yeah. Yes.” Jo falters, then lifts her eyes and arms. The flowers follow in her right hand. Her hug is firm, clasping around Cas’ shoulders and into his spine. She smells like soap and a memory of perfume.
But she called him and he came over and she hugged him tightly until she couldn’t any more and they broke up again. Only she promised herself to not go back this time. Dean smiled and told her hey don’t worry we’ll stay friends no matter what. It felt good. The evening had faded out and his eyes glowed like fireflies.
When dean came home that afternoon after football practice he wasn't ready for the mess sam had made in the kitchen. Cas had encouraged him to try out and despite everyone's beliefs he had gotten in. that was last month. He hadn't told john about it yet. Sammy usually never made a mess but this was one of those occasions his head had been too caught up in a project and he'd lost track. "what the hell? You brought mudd into the house?"
"Sammy it's time to go" dean told him. He had noticed despite his excitement his yawns had become too frequent and he wasn't in the mood to carry the kid all the way back.
"I called your house no one picked up"
“I think I have an eyelash in my left eye” cas explained.
Now that dean was on the football team, it was easier to explain away the bruising. The staff wrote him off as dumb jock instead of stoner. He even got better grades because he was just THAT good at it that they gave him better grades to let him practice more. There were even talks of playing varsity and for dean, that was so exciting. He'd never thought he'd be able to go to college. College was for smart kids and rich people. People whose parents set aside money for them. Whose report cards were all As and talked of SATs like it was the match of century. He still hurried home to make dinner for Sammy. He still lowered his gaze whenever john was around. But now outside, in the world of his peers, he was looked up on and it was a new feeling. One he didn't know how to handle. One that had pushed what had happened on Halloween night, deep deep down. He pretended. He was good at it. but how well could he pretend to someone who knew everything else? He told himself that he was doing okay that it was enough and he should just push through whatever it is to make the thing go away and that no one would know any better.
implied underage rape
"okay then, I'm just gonna drop his homework then"
It was raining cats and dogs. Dean couldn’t see beyond his own headlights. The taillights of the next car over on the road were almost invisible. He was driving carefully. That was a rare thing for him to do. Driving was like breathing for him, thinking about it gave him headaches. His best friend cas was on the passenger seat. He was staring intensely at the road, ready to scream stop if dean’s attention wasn’t quick enough, he was obviously nervous, beads of sweat had formed on his face which gave his skin a slight filmy effect. they’d won the game. The car smelled sweaty and humid, the bracelet on dean’s wrist was stuck to his skin and it was itching but he had refused to part with it, cas had made it in shop and given it to him for his birthday. They were supposed to go to the McDonalds for pizza but they got lost in the urban area and it had started to rain heavily out of nowhere. Finally dean pulled over when cas spotted a diner. They decided it was better to wait out the rain, eat something, ask for directions.
"hey" sam replied after swallowing his bite.
"clean it up, you should've done this in the backyard" dean barked at his brother and grabbed the shoe box quickly. Sam started to protest and tried to swat it out of dean's hand but the taller boy had already opened the window and thrown the box open. butterflies flew out, all were white with black dots, dean wiped his hands on his shirt, feeling a creepy feeling go through his body. Yuck. Sam started to scream at him. "why'd you do that I spent weeks gathering them!" despite their size difference it wasn't an easy task to stop sam from biting him or screaming at him. They struggled for a few minutes until dean immobilized sam under his weight. The little tiger's heart was racing and his cheeks were flushed. Dean was just going to make sure he had calmed down before he'd let him go. " promise you won't do anything then I'll let go" dean said. He knew sam would start kicking the moment he'd let go but he always asked him that anyway. "that was sick, do you like being pinned down?"
The diner was almost empty, they were uncomfortably wet when they stepped inside, even though dean was careful to park as close to the entrance as possible and Cas had covered them both with his trench coat. Dean always teased him about it. Called him inspector gadget. They sat next to each other on the second row. The waitress was an old woman, tired. Dean ordered bacon and soda, cas ordered pancakes and orange juice for them both. They sat, waiting for their order, staring blankly out the large windows into the absolute darkness and some other shades of darkness their sight could not differentiate. Cas was aware of the 2 inches of distance between them. Of the way dean stank but how it didn’t bother him. Of dean’s wet hair stuck to his neck. Of hi-
After the new year's party dean headed back home. He carried sam to his bed and took the shoes off and tucked him in. he went to the bathroom to take a piss when he smelled john. He had drunk even more than usual. Dean's arrival had awakened him from his drunk stupor. He stumbled out of the old bathtub and started his usual nagging. Dean had gotten pretty good at blocking him out by now. He never failed to mention how he should have made mary get an abortion, how she'd trapped him in a marriage and then whore herself to half of the town and left him to deal with the brats. Dean grimaced and decided to go to the back of the house and just relieve himself in the bushes. John called after him, where are you going boy, look at me when I'm talking to you. He took dean by the jaw and squeezed his fingers to face himself. Then he told dean, you have her eyes, her whore eyes. Dean wanted to throw up. He could feel the desert and the dinner trying to make their way up from his stomach. He tried to get away. His body felt rigid. This was the part he'd never told anyone. What john did that made him cry. He would stop feeling like he was dean, he would start feeling like he was a glass of water set on a desk in a quiet library and he would only start feeling like he was himself when he was alone in the room again. this time it was even messier, the floor reeked, he was laying in his own pee and once john was gone he started to throw up as well. It took him hours to clean himself and the room. He couldn't feel his hands. His back hurt. He sat in the tub and winced, the clear of water turned pink.
“Charlie”
"sick huh?"
"jesus…okay, kid just tell me where I can find him?"
"I had this nightmare, where I found a box, like a travel box from the old movies, a wooden suitecase if you will, and I opened it and you were inside, only you looked hallowed out, like someone had taken a spoon to your cheeks and eaten your fat and I woke up." Cas replied patiently, it sounded like he had practiced it a few times in his head.
And then they stayed there, not moving at all. Dean shifted his head a little, his nose brushed cas's adolescent stubble. Cas opened his jaw as if to talk but his lips made no sound. Unlike cas Dean's lips weren't dry, he had a nerveous habit of licking them. Neither of them had any time to get their heart racing or think of it because they heard people shuffling in the hallway and they scrambled away in a hurry. They did not talk about it. they did not mention it again. dean already knew how to act as if nothing had happened but he took even more meticulous steps to make sure he knew how to act. Specially the times a song came up on the radio and he would catch cas glancing at him as he drove, to see if dean loved the song as much as he did or not, and dean would pretend to be fascinated by the scenary. Or when he let dean have the last slice of pizza and dean had to pretend he'd really would have fought him over it. Or when he'd bend over at the hardware store to reach a shelf and dean had to busy himself looking at the sharp edges of the mechanical saws and count every single ridge. Or not to blush when cas remarked about his biceps having gotten bigger. Or not to think late at night about vampires biting his neck.
“I think I forgot my wallet in the car, did you bring yours?” Dean raised his eyebrows. “I think you’re catching a cold, you look red”
After the final school bell rang a highschool boy came over to the shared field they had with the middleschool and waved at sam who was sat on the bleachers having a small sandwich and conjugating Spanish verbs.
"yeah no, he's sick"
“He was so skinny I took him in, I fed him, he was a sweet boy, John never made inquiries about him until Mary came back. If she’d come back a few weeks late I’d have done all the paperwork. When Sam was born, Mary left again. this time for good. John didn’t come around there any more so I lost track of them for a while. Your father had died, I had only you and me to think of.”
“Mom why are you telling me all this?” Jo’s voice faltered.
Dean teased Sammy about having a crush on the new librarian. She was also their new neighbor. Sammy asked him to make her some brownies. Dean tossed him a recipe and told him to make it himself and he’d help him with the oven then went back to his room to do some push ups. It was a silent sort of exercise and dean was always quiet as a mouse at home. Sam couldn’t read his brother’s terrible handwriting so he had to go upstairs a couple of times to ask him. Sam asked him for the last ingredient and dean laughed and told him it was love and sam blushed and cursed him under his breath. He went back to the kitchen and cleaned up. He didn’t want dean to get in trouble. Then he asked him to come fix the oven, dean was sweaty and he stank but he slid the tray in the oven and sat on the counter, drinking iced tea and letting the afternoon breeze cool him down instead of taking a shower. When it was done he went over to their neighbors with Sammy in tow and rang their bell. It was a shabby old house and the porch’s doorsteps creaked under their feet. When the door was opened it was a young woman with dark hair and a sweet smile who greeted them. She invited them in and thanked them. Dean didn’t know why she talked like that but he didn’t ask either. He could see it was sam’s schoolboy crush, the kid was always at the library and shied away from most people so he was happy he had taken his nose out of the books for some human conversation. The interior was freshly painted and the furniture was old yet clean. There was wild flowers decorating the living room. Miss Eileen, the quiet librarian / neighbor brought them some lemonade. She talked with sam about his homework, she asked dean about their upcoming game, she purposefully avoided asking about their parental situation, sam tried to use sign language but she laughed because he’d mistaken some words and so his brother was feeling like an idiot for a change. Miss eileen was sweet and nice to them and dean would have thought she was just like every other adult he’d met in his life, well meaning and clueless. He’d never trusted any authority figures, even ellen, he knew he couldn’t count on. But before this story comes to an end, miss Eileen would prove to be much much more. For now, they said goodbye and she handed dean a small Emily Dickinson booklet and dean had a hard time saying no, so now he felt like he’d been given homework but for the first time, he didn’t want to disappoint. He’d ask cas to help him with it, cas was nothing if not resourcefully good with words.
Castiel blinks, certain he’s missing something. Hadn’t he just been somewhere else?
“Dammit Cas,
Sam sighed, the humor dropping from his face immediately. “We’ve even tried to get ahold of Jack and Amara, but we knew that’d be a long shot.”
“I-“ Dean paused. “Is something wrong? You sound off.”
Sam sighed. “That’s not what I meant. I want to find him too Dean, but we’ve had too many losses like this before. Have hope, but be realistic.”
“How can you be sure? You said yourself, he’s been distant for a while. Maybe he’s just up and left.” A bitter edge crept into his voice.
“Cas?”
“You said the one thing you want, is something you know you couldn’t have.” He coughed, the words making his mouth go dry. “And after all these years, I thought the same thing. Because I know what my own true happiness looks like. And it’s always been with you. Because you changed me too.”
Do you ever hear a song on the radio, have it immediately take you back to a point in time. Or be reminded of a person you care about when someone mimics a movement. Even just a simple phrase can spark recognition in your chest, filling your mind with a memory. A lingering feeling.
“Oh but Dean, he made a deal. I’m afraid there are no returns for this one,” Meg’s voice reverberated through the darkness. “So sad really.” She appeared out of thin air, lounging on a throne. “You know what he’s dreaming about? Every time he failed you. Every mistake he made, every act of betrayal. It’s tearing up his poor little heart.” The Empty smirked with Meg’s face. “And I can’t let that be interrupted I’m afraid.”
A book slams onto the table in front of him, and he jumps despite himself.
_____________
No response.
“Whoa whoa, easy,” Dean said, helping him stand. He kept an arm around Castiel as he swayed on his feet. “We had to do a spell to get you back. It required a transference of power once you’ve drained it, and the most powerful thing nearby was your Grace. I’m sorry.”
