And since Steve hadn’t ever been into that sort of thing either, he’d just grinned and said, “Guess that’s one we don’t need to check off our list, huh?” and volunteered a sort of embarrassing story about being punished during his own school days (for refusing to recite an essay he found insulting and just flat wrong-headed in front of the class) as an illustration of how little he wanted to relive them, and they’d just moved on.  But when they’d moved into impact play, Steve had realized that if you left the roleplay off, Tony kind of loved spanking, the hard smack of Steve’s hand against his rear, the warm glow of it, the pain, even liked him to go what Steve thought was pretty hard, moaned and rocked his bottom back into it and begged for more even when Steve knew it hurt and he was panting, head hanging down and his body flinching and flushed even as he pushed his rear back and begged with his whole body to be smacked.  Tony was no masochist; Steve knew that, not like he was himself, but there was something he liked about it, liked a lot.
“Course,” Tony said, and shuffled his legs apart just that little bit more.  “Come on in, big boy.”  It came out very breathy, light and soft, but maybe Steve wouldn’t mind that, so much.  It kind of fit character, right?
noise, whimpering, his eyes opening wide, then sliding closed.  He tongued sloppily at one side of Tony’s cockhead, then pulled off just enough to whisper raggedly against the messy wet tip of his cock.
with his hand on Steve’s cock, drawing it out.  “I came five times,” he finally managed to slur out.
“I know what you want,” Tony said softly.  “Yeah?”  Another little bit of pressure, sending pain shooting from that oh-so-sensitive skin and flesh to every part of Steve’s body.  “You want me to step on you.  You want me to hurt you.  Give this big gorgeous cock a nice little kick, huh?”
it as Tony attached the weight to the bottom of the clamp and it abruptly pulled down and
“How was that?” Steve asked, then, still massaging the back of Tony’s neck, gently.  “Okay?”
Tony blinked at him a moment, and his mouth moved, making shapes, but no words came.  He swallowed, then smiled again, suddenly, brightly.  “You’d know I’d stay with you any time, sweetheart,” he said.  “I could climb in bed with you while you sleep, but that might hurt, babe.  Not enough room for both me and you, big guy.”  He gestured illustratively at how Steve’s large arms were already precariously near the edge of the small hospital bed.
“I hardly did anything,” he muttered, mostly under his breath, but Tony must have caught it, because he gave him one hell of a look.
“Spread your legs a little bit for me, babe,” Tony mumbled, curling his fingers in Steve’s hair.  “I wanna get a good view.  Want to watch you come off for me.  Roll back on your hip, show yourself off for me.”
—”  He sounded absolutely mortified just at the thought that Tony might have been
Steve smiled up at him, raising his eyes just enough that Tony could see it, see them, the rueful tilt to his mouth, before he kissed Tony’s thigh again.  “I wanted to do it again ever since the first time,” he said, in what was barely more than a hoarse whisper.  “But I—well, I was afraid I’d looked like an idiot, if I’m honest.  Afraid you wouldn’t want me to do it again.”
“You are,” Tony insisted, then grinned and bit lightly at the lobe of Steve’s ear to lighten the moment.  “Big, beautiful, and you can suck cock like a champ.”
“Gorgeous fella,” Steve said, grinning and warming to his theme now.  He caught Tony’s wrists in his, rubbed gently against the pulse at each of them.  “With his gorgeous blue eyes and his long eyelashes that could’ve been on some Hollywood beauty without even any need for makeup and pretty lips and defined cheekbones and ridiculously nice, soft, thick hair and—” he slid his hands up, then down, under the blanket, following the line of Tony’s shoulders and back to squeeze gently, teasingly, caressingly, at Tony’s tight behind “—and the tightest, most beautiful backside I’ve ever seen?”
“Mm-mm,” Tony stuttered, groaned.  “Mmm. Yeah.  Good.  Feeling good, honey, honeybunch.”
He was amazing.  Steve still wasn’t sure where the judges got off giving Steve anywhere near the PCS they gave Tony, especially with the depth and quality of his edges to go along with it.  His legs looked a lot less wobbly today, too, though, of course, he didn’t do any quads today.  There was no need for it in an exhibition, of course, especially when Tony’s quads weren’t the strongest.  Steve just wished he himself could remember to use his arms like Tony did—though he didn’t think he had any chance of that.  The lines of them were so elegant, and the way he used them seemed totally different, based on his music—finger snapping and swinging his hips, now.
It didn’t take long at all for Steve to come, and Tony let him ride it out in his mouth, sucking at him and playing at him just perfect with his tongue, until the pleasure built and built, turning soft, then bright and bladed, on the edge of pain, and into hot, throbbing, over-sensitized pain itself, and Steve found himself pushing Tony gently away.
“All right,” Steve said, with a will, measuring out this flogger against his hand.
Steve rubbed at the small of Tony’s back, stroked him up and down over his sides with both hands, rubbed at his shoulders, the back of his neck, squeezed there, then down again. “Good?” he mumbled, sucking another wet kiss at Tony’s neck, and damn, his voice had gone so low and deep, sex-rough, and Tony felt it in his gut as it squeezed tight with desire, trembled through his hips, his thighs.
Eventually Tony pulled away, breathing raggedly and unevenly, and buried his face against Steve’s throat, half in his sweater.  His face felt hot, his lips wet, and he was trembling all over.  Steve rubbed at his hips, pressed a soft kiss into his hair, and held him close, and Tony sighed and relaxed into him, going limp like his strings had been cut.  He curled his arms around Steve’s neck.  “Love you too, apple pie,” he sighed.
Tony smiled a little. “Yeah, well,” he said.
“This is gonna be harder,” Steve told him, reached for the strap on the bed.  “It’s gonna hurt a little, okay?”  He stroked down one of Tony’s legs, then the other, rubbing softly with his knuckles over his thighs.
Steve had known he still shouldn’t—Rumlow was his subordinate, for God’s sake, and kissing him outside a bar bathroom didn’t change that, however it had felt—but Rumlow knew what he was doing, he clearly knew what he was doing, on the field and off of it, with a pool cue and with his mouth as well as a gun, and Steve so often felt like he didn’t have a clue, about any of it, and it felt like the first time he’d been able to forget all about that in—in a long time (the last time he’d been to Stark Tower, and Tony had smiled at him and taken his hand with both of his and patted the top of it and squeezed, but that hadn’t lasted, Tony had been off like a shot a second later, talking about a thousand different things Steve didn’t understand in a way that felt like it was subtly mocking him for how he couldn’t keep up, and they’d ended up snapping at each other all over again, however little Steve had wanted to—he’d been so determined to get along with Tony that time, to tell him he wanted to move into the Tower, to show him how much he wanted to be friends, but—well, he hadn’t done any of those things, and he’d ended up moving out to DC instead—and, well).  But when Rumlow—Brock—had grinned at him and invited Steve back to his place, he’d agreed.  Agreed and tried not to think too much about Tony, even as he rubbed self-consciously at his mouth, red and bitten and wet, stinging with the marks Brock had left on him, feeling like everyone could see, would know what he’d been doing.
“Do you like that?” Tony whispered, his own voice rasping, rambling.  “Do you like my cock in your mouth?  Does it fill you up nicely?  Feel good, nice and hot and salty on your tongue?  You like that?  Do you like the taste of me, do you like the idea of me inside you like that?  Swallow my spunk down and let it keep your belly warm, huh?  You like that?”
“And you’re mine,” Steve mumbled, unable to put into words the fondness that welled up inside him, that made him squeeze his arms around Tony and hold him close, the gratitude and softness and how it made him feel overwhelmed that he got to have this, to the point that his throat felt thick and tight and wet stung the corners of his eyes.
, pulling at his tit, a constant tug, biting and demanding even as he sucked in his breath and that made the muscle bounce, pulling in against the weight as he flexed instinctively and it rolled to the side.  The ball tips of the clamp abruptly felt even more cruel, harsh and deep, and Steve gave a harsh whining breath of effort.  He felt lopsided, suddenly, off balance, until Tony did the other side, and the harsh pain was the same both places, that heavy downward pull that made his nipples feel stretched and heavy.  Tony flicked them both, set them sliding over Steve’s hot red pecs, and Steve moaned, couldn’t help the way his muscles flexed, hands curling into fists behind him and shoulders pressing into the bed until they flared with tender soreness, arching his back, lifting his backside off the bed until he fell back with another moan.  His tits ached, and his nipples
Steve grabbed more whipped cream on his finger and swiped it against Tony’s nose.  “I did,” he admitted.
“I know; I won’t forget,” Tony said, soft and sweet and warm.  His hand slid back up, rubbed gently at Steve’s shoulders.  “Thank you.  Thank you, big guy.”
Steve flushed, looked down, then back up at Tony, bit his bottom lip.  “Just as long as I can please you,” he blurted, finally, almost shyly, big body going hot over Tony’s as he met his eyes.  “That’s all I want.”
“That’s it,” he groaned, “oh, that’s it, that’s perfect, sweetheart, God, Steve, that’s so good; that’s just exactly right.”  Steve licked him again, and he whimpered; there was no denying that had been a whimper.
“I thought you wanted more, golden boy,” Rumlow had half growled, half purred, into his mouth.  “Looking at me with those damn bedroom eyes of yours, with those ridiculous eyelashes, like you wanted me to just bend you over the pool table and go to town—” and oh,
Natasha shrugged with a laugh.  “It’s just an exhibition,” she said, but she did push off from the wall and give him a little wave before heading off again.
“Yes, sir,” Steve mumbled. He still felt sleepy, thick, pleasantly transported on the warmth and solidity of Tony’s body, the warmth and welcome of his presence.  “You’re the boss.”
Steve was sure that was true, but that didn’t make it any more fair.  Or nicer to have to deal with, he was sure.  “All the same,” he said.  “Whatever their problem is.  I don’t have it.”
Tony caught his breath on a gasp, feeling it vividly as a tremor went through him, lancing hot through his cock, making it swell, throb against the smooth metal tight around it. He moaned, overwhelmed, bucked his hips up, then pushed them back on Steve’s finger, trying to be good, to take him deeper.  Steve gripped his hip, squeezing, massaging his ass tightly with his other hand, and Tony gasped for air, got one hand down and rubbed instinctively at the metal encasing his cock, groaning.  It was just a ghost of sensation, of warmth, but it took the feeling even higher, somehow, and Steve didn’t stop him, just murmured praise to him as he sank his finger even deeper inside, began to thrust it in and out, gentle and slow, stretching Tony inside with gentle circles and pushes of his knuckles, curling it, working it inside, each time.  Tony was gasping, chest heaving, gulping with each breath, his mouth wet, gripping desperately at his cock, dragging his hand up and down the metal surface as Steve worked his finger inside him, before too long, feeling hot and overwhelmed and shivering with it, Steve’s finger soft and dragging against him inside in a way that left him feeling sensitive and hot around him already, close and clinging and tight, tender and throbbing at every touch, especially when Steve began to stroke his prostate and pleasure sparked hot and needy through Tony’s body, thrumming under his skin, with each sweet, hot pulse of slowly building pleasure as Steve rubbed at him.  Tony was moaning, panting, already, as Steve worked in another finger, and his cock throbbed needily, twinged as it was constrained by the cage.
Tony grinned, then obeyed.  The sight of him sticking out his tongue also made blood rush south—it was all—all red and glistening—but Steve steeled himself as he took another big dollop of whipped cream with his finger and swiped it onto Tony’s tongue.
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve called out after him.  He grabbed one of the little bears off the top of the pile in his arms, and tossed it toward him in a slow loop.  Tony caught it easily, looking startled.  “You can keep it,” Steve said, and knew he was blushing again.
“I didn’t mean to get blown up,” Steve said.  “It wasn’t my fault this time.”
Tony whined at him, shaking his head, had a feeling his other hand was clawing pretty unnecessarily at Steve’s thigh, dragging his short nails down it, but Steve didn’t seem to mind, just nuzzled in against his throat, his jaw, kissing him gently.
Tony.  Tony was talking to him.  Why were his thoughts coming so slowly?  He felt cold, and not much else, other than that tightness, that pain, in his chest.  His eyes weren’t open, he realized.  He was very aware of the passage of air over his bottom lip, which felt dry.  Tony was talking to him.  That was Tony’s voice.  Was Steve even still alive, then?
“Then it’s Tony,” Stark—
it made him feel vulnerable, maybe.  Maybe that was good.  Maybe he liked that.  Maybe he kept wanting more of it.  Tony wasn’t even sure.  He let his hands lift up, slip over the skirt again, up to his stomach where it was bare above his navel, watching Steve’s eyes dilate, watch him in the mirror.
And then as far as he knew, he was struggling to open his eyes, which was unreasonably difficult, because his eyelids felt incredibly heavy and seemed to want to flinch closed, and his lips felt very dry and cracked and he wasn’t sure if he was bleeding anywhere but he was pretty sure he was because his leg felt all wet and he was panting, gasping for air but he couldn’t get a deep breath, and his ears were ringing.
“Sorry, sorry,” Tony said.  “I shouldn’t tease, babe, I know.”  He was petting Steve’s hand now.  Steve wondered what that meant.  “But if you wanna sleep, I can be here when you wake up, too.  I can bring you a tablet so you can catch up on the news and we can play cards or whatever you want to do.  And I’ll bring you some ice cream, any flavor.  I just don’t want you to hurt, big boy.”
Tony let him wait for it for a moment, working himself up, smiling down at him the whole while, twining his fingers in the short hair at the back of Steve’s neck, before he gave Steve’s hard cock a little flick with his shoe, one that set it slapping hard against Steve’s pelvis, a quick sharp bite of pain that had him sucking his breath and shivering, squirming, helplessly in Tony’s hold, under Tony.
Steve tugged gently at Tony’s sagging stockings, pulled them up then let them slip down again, rubbed at Tony’s hips, played with his panties, tugging on them, feeling at them, before he grinned at him in the mirror, sat back a little, and ran his hand over Tony’s side, then the other over the other.  “You look so beautiful,” he murmured, and Tony ducked his head down.
“I won’t know until I try,” Steve said with what felt to Tony like shocking cheerfulness, and wrapped his fingers around his cock again, put his mouth back down over it.  The sudden heat and wetness and pleasure surprised a moan out of Tony, and he felt Steve smile around his cock.  Oh.  That—that was lovely, to feel Steve smile as he sucked him, to feel like he was—he was happy enough doing this to do that—he moaned, felt his hips jerk again, lift up into Steve’s mouth.  He tried his best to keep it gentle and gradual, grasping at control desperately, realized his hand was sliding back, knotting in his own hair and tugging as if that would help keep him grounded, an old habit he thought he’d broken when his hair started falling out because he’d figured it didn’t need any help with that.  A broken whimper escaped him as Steve flicked his tongue at the underside of his cockhead, dragged it up and down the underside, laving at it, without opening his mouth.
Tony was just grinning.
“Hey, no,” Tony said, still soft.  His fingers dropped, rubbed at the back of Steve’s neck, and he almost closed his eyes again in pleasure, had to fight against it.  “You need the rest.  How are you feeling?”
“Steve, Steve, Steve, please.”  His chest hurt.  Someone was calling to him, welcome and familiar, but that beloved voice had gone scratchy and rough.  As he listened it dropped down nearly to a whisper, little more than a hoarse rasp.  “Steve.  C’mon, Cap, don’t do this to me.  Don’t do this to me, big guy.”
“Hey, look at that,” he managed to say.
“Okay, this is how we’re gonna do this, Steve—you don’t mind if I call you Steve, right?” Rumlow said, and Steve shook his head against the bed, but Brock still wasn’t moving.
pressure.  He whined, moaned, twisted his head until he could pant into the bed under him, jerking his hips up despite himself.  He was aware his voice came out sounding breathy and needy and desperate, like—like sex.  “Hurts so perfect, Tony.”
“Tell me how you cleaned up for me, Tony,” Steve murmured softly, now stroking his thumb along the underside of Tony’s caged cock, leaving sticky wetness there.
Steve nodded, rapidly, still not quite meeting his eyes.  “Yes,” he finally husked out, and then covered his face with one hand.
Steve’s eyes fluttered closed again, and he pushed his head forward, taking Tony’s length back into his mouth and hollowing his cheeks out to suck, still rolling his hips forward into his hand in that way that put him so fantastically on display.  His shirt had ridden up almost to his nipples, and Tony could see how deeply his chest and belly were flushed.  He was practically glowing, the way he did with exertion and the faint hint of perspiration (Tony got sweaty, but Steve just sort of glowed with his sweat like the idealized heroine of a romance novel—not that Tony would admit to having read those if most people had asked).  The suction on his cock was so good, so, so good that it was making Tony’s eyes want to cross, but he kept them open with an effort, sliding his hand through Steve’s hair, scratching gently at his scalp, because he wanted to watch, watch him come off with his mouth still on Tony’s cock, even as the pleasure it sent through him went brighter and brighter and sharper and sharper, and he let his hips roll just a little into Steve’s mouth.
Before he finished Steve moved back up to his shoulders again, painting them with the soft white leather, the creamy velvet of the tails, over the hot, sensitive skin, watching Tony as he trembled, keeping an eye on it.  It was a long time before he thought Tony had had enough, and Tony was very, very hard by then, moaning as he rubbed his cock unthinkingly up against the pillow.  Steve set the flogger aside, stepped in, having to adjust himself through his pants as he did and groaning out through his nose at the pressure on his needy, hot, wanting cock, before he stroked over Tony’s rear, his shoulders, again, and heard him make a startled noise, felt him jump under his hands.
“Shower?  Maybe later,” Brock said, grinning at him.  He tucked his dick away, zipped himself up, and Steve felt very aware of the cock lying loose and limp against his own thigh.  “Strip the bed and put the sheets in the wash, first.”
at Tony, and Tony had to close his eyes, take a deep breath, as his big hand curved around Tony’s cheek, rubbed at his chin, the hinge of his jaw, and he said, “Okay, good, that’s good.”  His fingers brushed softly, gently, over Tony’s mouth, and he said, “Thank you, Tony, sweetheart.  I really mean it.”
Steve was very patient this time, gently massaging at Tony’s inner tissues, stretching him gently, making sure he was slick inside and out before adding another finger and crooking them inside, rubbing gently.  He found his prostate, then, and started to rub there, again and again, massaging the spot into waves of hot, breathless pleasure that stabbed hot into Tony’s gut, went straight to his cock, and made Tony knock forward and smudge his lipstick against the mirror more than a few times, before he licked it up, his cock throbbing hot and hard, feeling heavy between his legs.  Steve got one, two, three fingers into him, pumping them in and out, twisting, stroking, working them against Tony’s prostate until he was gasping against the urge to twist back onto them, panting until the mirror steamed up with his breath between each lick.  Steve’s attention to his prostate was so constant, so assiduous, that Tony started to feel like it was aching under the gentle, constant pleasure, throbbing with it, swollen and sensitive and wanting, that throbbing pleasurable itch that it seemed like only Steve’s firm, caressing, slick fingers could scratch with each deep, soft rub into him.
Steve frowned at him and shook his head, leaned down and pressed a kiss to Tony’s shoulder, then his hip, then curled his hand warmly over Tony’s hip again and leaned in.  Tony watched him take a shuddering breath, felt it feather hot and damp over his groin, down over his cock, watched Steve swallow, and then lean in again.  He reached out, curled one hand around Tony’s cock.
Tony’s words echoed in his ears, made his cock throb and jerk all over again, made him ache all the way down to his toes.
.”  Another cruel yank to the sensitive peak that had Steve letting out a broken sounding groan that was damn close to a sob.  It
“Sir,” Steve managed, breathily, his voice sounding choked and wet despite the wispy breathy quality it had acquired somewhere, an acknowledgment of what he was saying even as he trembled down to his toes with the knowledge of it, wanted to moan.
“You feeling good right now?” Steve asked, and Tony nodded.
“Well, the feeling is very mutual, hot stuff,” Tony said with the kind of warm, glowing, genuine appreciation that made Steve go hot down to his toes, hands still on Steve’s forearms to steady him, and then got him under the spray.
“Merry Christmas to me,” Tony said, and his smile was brighter than every light in the house as he wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck and kissed him again, and they stayed there, for a moment, just kissing at the top of the stairs.
“That’s right,” Tony told him, and Steve could hear in his voice that he was smiling faintly.  “I’m in charge of you right now, soldier.  I call the shots.  Be a good boy for me, all right?”
Tony groaned, panting even as Steve gently let go of his cock, letting it bob up against his groin again and reached back to press gently at his hole, stroking, pressing but not pushing in, massaging the rim.
“Mmm,” Tony said.  His eyes were hazy, dreamy, and he looked soft and well-kissed and a little drowsy himself.  He leaned his head on Steve’s shoulder as Steve started to carry him out of the room and found the stairs.  “Nah.  I set up everything with holiday bonuses and the holiday work schedule for Stark, and I think we’ve got everyone covered with shift rotations and presents here, too.  You did most of that anyway.”
, and then there were two fingers, slick and wet with something, pressing against him there, against his hole, just like Brock had done earlier through his jeans, and then they were pushing unceremoniously inside, and it was the first time anyone’s fingers other than his own had ever been inside Steve, and he felt himself gasp against the bed and it hitched in his chest, as a wave of heat went through him and he felt so very aware of his cock bobbing cold and wet in the air now that his pants were down around his knees.  He was sweating, and he couldn’t seem to get a breath in.  He clenched his hands in the blankets and dragged in an unsteady, heaving breath, and then Brock’s fingers, callused and rough, dragged along something inside him and it felt so good,
“Turnabout is fair play,” Tony said, with an unrepentant grin.  He brushed hair back off Steve’s face and kissed his forehead.  “By the way, there’s hot cocoa in the crockpot, and Jarvis made some cookies.  I . . . helped.  Okay, I kept Clint out of the way and kept Carol from stealing the dough and then the cookies themselves but.  I added some icing and some sugar, too.”
Stark was stretching his muscles from side to side now.  He still had his earbuds in.  And Steve really needed to concentrate on his own warmup.  He forced his mind back to his routine, running through his choreography in his head.  If he forgot his steps again, Fury was going to kill him.  And he really did need the money.
“To me, or to Jarvis?” Steve asked innocently.
“Good,” he said.  “I, uh, I do my best out there, I mean.”
“Fine,” Steve said. He didn’t want to dwell on his injuries—they weren’t a big deal, and they’d be gone in another few days, anyway. It was just a few broken ribs, a slash down his leg.  They were already knitting, healing; he could feel it.  Sure, it was rough, being injured a few days before Thanksgiving, but hey, at least he could eat a lot over the next couple of days, give his metabolism a boost.  He was just sorry he couldn’t chip in to help Jarvis with the cooking like he normally did.
Tony blinked, swallowed, had to struggle to think clearly for what he felt were understandable reasons.  Steve’s big thumbs were resting against the inner muscles of his thighs, rubbing warm circles into the bare skin, and he felt hot and prickly all over with the awareness of his gaze, as breathless and electric as if this was his first time all over again, ridiculous for someone as experienced as he was, and considering it wasn’t even his first time with
“And a garter belt, too,” Steve said, sounding overwhelmed, watching in the mirror as Steve slid his fingers up, along the garters, along his thighs, to rub over the tight fabric of the garter belt.  He pushed the little skirt up, and then Tony reached down, pulled it and held it against his belly obligingly with one hand, so that Steve could see it, the soft pattern of floral dots over it, rub at it with his fingers.  It made Tony’s cock feel strangely held in tight, compressed, nowhere to go where the garter belt fit snugly over his groin, held him down against his groin, his belly, compressed under the panties and the tight garter belt, throbbing helpless and tight, hot and needy, as Steve rubbed his hands up and down over the garter belt, over the slight bulge that was all it revealed at his groin.  Steve made a low, deep, needy sound in the back of his throat, watching Tony swell there just the tiniest bit as he stroked him, and burrowed his face in against the back of his neck, sucking wet, hot kisses there, along his nape, over his neck, until Tony’s was squirming.  Steve’s face felt hot against his skin, his shoulders and pecs hot against Tony’s back through the thin soft lace, so he was turned on and flushing desperately the way he did when he really needed it, already.
He couldn’t have said how long that went on for, either, just that eventually he felt Steve running his broad, warm palm, firm with callus, idly, almost curiously, up and down his cock, felt him slide back and off him, and Tony realized his eyes were shut and he was gasping for breath, that he’d melted back into the bed and his legs were spread wide, his chest heaving.  He felt like a liquid, like his bones had melted and his body had forgotten how to be a solid, like Steve had turned him into a quivering pool of runny Jell-O against his own Egyptian cotton sheets.  He pet clumsily at Steve’s hair, dragged in a breath, and said, startled by how deeply his voice rasped in his throat, “Steve, stud, wow, that was, wow, I, that was perfect,
“I’m so glad,
“Got a hard head,” Steve managed, and oh, God, was that his voice, all raspy and broken and hoarse like that, little more than a whisper? He sounded like hell.  No wonder Tony was overreacting like he was.  Like he always did, Steve admitted to himself. “I’m, ‘m gonna be fine, Iron Man. Right back to the fight.”
Tony wasn’t sure if that was a euphemism for oral sex or if Steve meant it exactly how it had sounded, but he supposed that each was as accurate as the other.  “I’ve always thought practice made perfect,” he said, keeping it light.  “So, if that was a question, sweetheart, yes; I’ve done my best.  I take it you’re appreciating the results?”
Steve nodded, groaned in the back of his throat, his eyes opening wide as he stared up at Tony.  He flicked his tongue against Tony’s cock, around the head, against his thumb, as if to assure him he was still ready to go, and his hand tightened on Tony’s thigh, on his own cock, making himself groan as he nodded again.
“Touch yourself,” Tony managed to moan, somehow, getting his head back up, his eyes open, curling his fingers in Steve’s hair.  “C’mon, touch yourself for me, big fella, I want you to feel good, too, want to know you’re touching yourself while you’re bringing me off . . . want to know how you’re enjoying this, that you’re enjoying this . . . .”  He really, really did.  It sure seemed like Steve was enjoying the hell out of all of it, what with the throbbing heat of his erection all huge and wet against his belly, the eager gulps and grunts and noises he was making as he sucked on Tony’s cock, but—but he just wanted to see it, to remember Steve loving this, loving sucking Tony’s cock like this, really, really enjoying it.  And he wanted to make sure things went better when he came this time—but more than anything he wanted to see Steve come.  “God, I want to watch you come,” he mumbled.  “Want to see you come for me, watch you come sucking my cock, big guy, gorgeous.”
“Let me see,” Steve said, smiling up at him, already flushed all over, sounding a little breathless. He slid his thumb over the top of it, patted Tony’s caged cock gently.
“Mmm,” Tony said, and his eyes fell to hedonistic slits.  “’s
“Good,” Steve told him, and then reached down, curled his hand around Tony’s cock.  It always fit so perfect in his hand, hot and jerking, smoother than his own, and he rubbed at it, gentle, slow, rubbing his thumb around the tip in circles, around the edge of it, just the way Tony liked, until he gasped and came with a soft, low, broken little cry and fell back against him.
He’d never thought, exactly, he’d be the sort of person who had hot dates.  Not like Tony, who could have dated any woman—any
“Promise?” Steve said, managing to smile at him, and Tony’s answering smile was so warm and soft.
It wasn’t a total surprise, but the pleasure of it still struck Tony like a blow, had him arching up off the bed helplessly, clutching at Steve’s hair with one hand and covering his mouth with the other.  Steve moaned, as if in pleasure, as if to spur him on, and moved with that thrust, keeping his mouth on Tony’s cock even as he moved back, then sinking himself back down over it again.  He didn’t go so deep that it hit the back of his throat, but he still covered a good percentage of Tony with that hot, deep sucking pressure, and Tony heard himself whine high-pitched and pathetic as Steve drew back, his lips dragging over his length, providing tight suction around him all the while.
Steve blinked.  He felt very tired, and his chest hurt.  He couldn’t really feel his legs, but he had the impression that there was something wrong.  He took a breath, tried to remember.  His head hurt.  He’d been walking—he’d had to drag his leg, there had been blood.  He’d worried about—about bears, or wolves.  His chest had hurt.  His helmet had come off in the—there’d been a crash.  He’d—he’d fallen.  Out of the plane.  Hydra plane.  Ugh.  He didn’t want to make a habit of this.  He’d fallen and then he’d found the wreckage of the plane and they’d been dead and the radio had been dead and the experimental mind control drug they’d been carrying had all been contaminated and leaking into the soil.  Which probably wasn’t good, but it had to be injected, so Steve had figured he’d just tell people where this had happened and—once he got back to—where was he—
“And I really like the curls,” Steve said, letting one twine gently around his finger, tugging on it.
Tony grinned.  “You’re welcome, soldier,” he said, and then took Steve’s elbow and led him over to the sofa.  Steve blinked at it, almost disoriented, because it looked like—a bed?  Oh.  Tony had made up his wide pullout sofa with sheets and pillows and blankets.  It looked—so inviting, oh God.  “Lie down, sweetheart,” Tony said.  “I just have to strip the bed, it won’t take long.  I’ll be here with you in another moment, I promise.”
“All right,” Tony said.  “So, it’s up to you how you want to do this, lovely, but I’d put my hand on the cock in question—mine, in this case.”  He winked and Steve huffed out a laugh, ducking his head and looking up at him through his eyelashes, smiling a little, and there, that was good, that was what he wanted.  He reached down, circling his hands over Steve’s massive shoulders.  “And you know, be careful to cover your teeth with your lips, right?”
He was blinking up into Tony’s concerned face a moment later. And it was strange, because it was like he hadn’t even remembered Tony existed until he saw him—hair falling into his eyes, sweaty and sticking to his forehead, so he must have taken his helmet off, his face flushed and his eyes frantic—but then when he did it was as if something had fallen back into place, and his life was complete again, and a wave of warm, bright happiness swelled in Steve’s chest, even bigger and brighter than the pain.  He realized he was grinning, probably dopily, up at him.
, oh, that had made Steve hot all over, had gone straight to his already hot, throbbing dick, straining at the front of his jeans, “Gave me ideas, big guy, the way you stick your ass up in the air for me like you’re panting for it.  You wanna help me out, don’tcha?  You’re the one who got me all wound up like this,” he was tugging at Steve’s hair, biting at the side of his mouth while he talked, and Steve was groaning, hitching his hips forward against him, unable to stop, hot all over, every word making the inside of his head feel hotter, making him feel like he was melting, “the way you were batting those—those fuckin’ eyelashes, I know you want it, fucking asking me for it . . .”
And Steve kind of liked it, too—well, more than kind of, the sharp crack of his hand hitting against Tony’s bare skin that quickly translated into warmth, the rhythm of it, the way Tony’s rump got so warm so quick beneath his hand, watching Tony’s reactions as he writhed and panted and moaned under him.  He liked actually touching Tony, and he felt like Tony liked to actually feel his bare hand, just as much as Steve liked to touch him.  So he liked to start with this, with barehanded spanking, to get Tony warmed up.
“That’s it, that’s just perfect,” he managed to assure him, panting.  “That’s wonderful.  Just keep that up, with—with your tongue for a while, yeah.”
“Oh, God, so much,” Tony panted, and he saw Steve’s quick smile before he stroked his tongue over Tony’s cock again, the head of it, then the shaft.  They were soft little licks, then firmer, stronger, longer strokes of his tongue, then back again to soft and gentle, careful over his tip.  “So good,” Tony managed to moan.  His hands were sweating, mussing Steve’s hair, making it fuzz up around his face as he clutched at him.  “You, you can, you can, oh—oh.”  He panted, swallowed, tried to clear his head just a little, just enough to think, to talk.  “You can, uh, if you slide your tongue in against the, the slit, you know?  That’s always nice.  If you—if you want.”
“I don’t know about that,” he said, laughing a little awkwardly.  “Uh.  Anyway, I thought you could join me and my friends for warm downs while we wait for the finale.”
Tony’s smile was turning sheepish, self-aware, almost flustered, and he looked first one way, then the other, then back at Steve, and laughed a little helplessly.  “I’ve never been with anyone who liked my backside as much as you do, sport,” he said, after a moment.
“What?  Jeez, slugger, that’s taking it to the next level, don’t you think?” Tony said.  “Don’t have to apologize for being out of it.”  He sighed, and Steve thought
“There’s no pressure, my dear,” Tony murmured.  “I’ll like it however you do it, I promise.  I’m easy.”
Steve pulls back into the garage and Tony can feel his heart sinking from his chest into his stomach and the overwhelming feeling of desperately wanting to be anywhere other than here is creeping over him again, crawling across his skin, making him shiver and itch. Steve dismounts and looks at him, his eyes tired and aching as he searches his faces for an answer he won’t like, and he knows. He knows without Tony saying a word that he’s going to go out again tonight, that he’s going to drink and that he’s going to try whatever Ty gives him, and that he’s going to call Steve at some obnoxious hour and ask for a ride.
He stayed there as the sun came up, even as his stomach growled and gnawed insistently.  He put his head down on his arms.  He took a breath.  He should eat, he thought distantly.  He felt so cold, so cold and so alone and so—so worthless.  He wasn’t any good, not for anyone, he wasn't . . . good, he was terrible, a terrible boyfriend, a terrible . . . fuck, a—he should have done more.  The inside of his mouth still felt gritty.  He was so cold.  He shivered.  Maybe he should take another shower, he thought, but he found himself just running his fingertips over the grain of the wood of his table.  There was a scored mark there, a flaw.  Was that his fault?  Had he put that there?  Jesus Christ, he couldn’t even take care of his own goddamn things, the things SHIELD had entrusted him with, one of the few damn things he had in this time.  Why couldn't he even take care of a goddamn table?  His fingers went around and around, over the mark.
“You don’t mind?” he added quickly.
releasing because Tony hadn’t let him yet, until his bound hands were twitching into fists and his shoulders were quivering, shaking, against Tony’s.
“Okay, big guy,” Tony murmured.  “Yeah, you kneel for me, huh?  That’s it.”  He smiled so softly there was no sting in it at all, nothing demeaning, when he said, “Love you on your knees, my big piece of apple pie.  You’re so sweet.”
God, how did Tony
“Yes, yes, sir,” he panted, and his eyes still felt wet.  Tony hummed, pulled his foot back and gave Steve a little kick, flicking his cock up so that it smacked against his belly again, and Steve moaned, flinched, startled more than anything by the sudden hot bright pain.  Tony did it again, and the hot little spark of pain it sent through Steve had him messy and leaking a wet little burst of precome all over again.
“’S okay, Tony,” Steve managed, because he didn’t want Tony to be upset over it.  “There’s not much they can do.  I’ll just burn through any painkiller they’ve got, probably.”
Steve gave a little rasp of a laugh and bent his head forward so that his eyes were hidden.  “Yeah,” he said, after a moment.  “Sex.  I meant.  You know.  You’re so good at—putting your mouth on—you always make it so good for a fella.”
It usually took Tony a while to come, and ever since the cancer it had taken even longer, but he could feel how close he was now, and was sure, absolutely sure, that Steve’s hot mouth, his gentle, coaxing tongue, would get him there before too long.  He found himself clutching at his hair, fingers digging into his own scalp, pressing the back of his other hand against his mouth to muffle the noises wanting to escape him, to help keep them back.
The praise felt wonderful, warm and soft, settled in his belly like a glow, but Steve’s mind had caught up on something earlier.  “’Course I’m sure,” he murmured into his arms.  “And ‘course I’m sore.  Wasn’t that the point?  ‘S good though.  I like it.”
Tony’s program made Steve very glad he’d gone earlier in the night.  Steve was painfully aware that he was no artist.  Tony … was.  That didn’t even come close to describing what he did out there, though.  He didn’t have the biggest jumps Steve had ever seen, that was true, but it hardly mattered.  He was even better than Steve remembered from Nationals and Worlds. Tony might have said that Steve had perfect jumps (
“Yeah, you could have come, no problem,” Tony said against his temple, sounding pleased as his fingers carded through Steve’s hair, held his head close to his shoulder.  “You were right there, weren’t you?  Right there, right on the edge, just from that, just from having your sore little ass massaged and pinched and tortured, huh?  I’ll remember that for next time.  My big, sweet, needy pain slut, aren’t you, big boy?”
“It was really good, Steve,” he sighed, finally, relaxing against him.  “Just, just perfect, honey.”
Steve could feel himself go red, an even deeper red, hot all the way down over the back of his neck, over his ears.  “I, um. Is that a yes?” he asked.
Tony kissed him for a long time.  Steve couldn’t have been happier.  He was floating, somewhere where everything was pleasure, deep and sweet and good, the kiss perfect, sending little shivers of pleasure through his whole body as Tony kissed him and kissed him.  He kept moving his mouth against Tony’s, maybe a little clumsily, but he didn’t even care, rocked by pleasure every time Tony easily moved with his lips or tongue, gave him even more exactly what he wanted, even more perfectly.
Steve pulled off again, just a bit.  “You like that?” he said again.  He sounded breathless.
, or,
.  He’d always dreamed Tony might do that someday. He moaned, shook his head.
“Well, I’ve probably got that part under control,” Steve said, self-deprecating, and Tony laughed, and they both took a drink of cocoa.  Steve put his down, after a moment, and leaned in and kissed Tony again, tasting cocoa and whipped cream on his mouth.  “Tasting malted milk on your tongue,” Steve murmured against Tony’s mouth.  “Highlight of my holiday so far.”
“You beg so prettily,” Tony said softly.  “Never seen anyone who begs as prettily as you, sweetheart.  All so, so damn sweet and sincere and honest.”  A gentle circle of a fingertip around Steve’s painfully sensitive nipples, over the tips, above where the balls bit into his skin.
The cage felt heavy, tugging Tony’s cock and balls down between his legs as he rubbed at it through the silky fabric of his panties, feeling the smooth metal, cooler than his skin, through the silk, knowing the bulge of the cage, the shape of it, the mesh pattern of the steel, was visible under the clinging panties.  It was always a strange feeling to rub at himself through the cage, feel pressure and a slight tease of sensation but nothing else, the way the cage dragged him down, the metal and weight and pull of it making him constantly hyper-aware of the way his cock was locked up, contained. It fit snugly, but didn’t compress him; it was comfortable to wear, and actually made him look bigger in his panties as he rubbed at it, at himself, creating a more dramatic bulge under the soft silk. Steve had told him that he wanted Tony to be comfortable in whatever cages they used, first and foremost, then smiled at him, caressing the underside of Tony’s cock, just under the head, and said, “So I can keep you in it just as long as I want, right, Tony?” and Tony had shivered, moaned, pushed up into his hand, and said, “Yes, yes, honey, please,” hot all over just thinking about it.
?  How did he pick stuff like that out of Steve’s head, like he could just see inside?  Did he have some tell, some little shudder or flinch he gave that Tony could see, had already categorized with his genius mind, or was Tony just rambling—but either way, the inside of his head was too soft and too giving right now to even worry about that, it slipped away even as pleasure burned all the way through him that Tony thought it was
It lasts exactly twenty-three minutes and fourteen seconds.
“I’ll be right outside.”
do this because he’s done it before. Tony takes a deep breath in, flexes his hand against Steve’s arm, focusing on the feel of sinew and muscle, committing it to memory so he can revisit it later while Howard is talking, then pushes the door open. He only drops his hand when Howard looks up, forcing Steve to follow him into the room. Steve doesn’t object, quietly takes a place behind Tony as Tony sits on one of Howard’s spinning stools.
He pauses, his eyes drifting down to bore a hole into his hands before he looks back up. His gaze has tightened, turning brighter, sharper, a strange passionate gleam lighting them up from within. He takes a deep breath before continuing, and if Tony didn’t know better he would say that he was witnessing Steve steel his resolve, and his next words come out in a rush, on a warm breath of air that blows across Tony like a summer breeze.
“Can you hear me now?” He hopes he sounds more sober than he is.
Tony laughs gently as a wrapper moves past his face and falls to the floor, and his cheeks are starting to hurt from how much he’s laughing at the faces Steve makes every time he misses his mark. His eyes are sparkling and he’s letting out deep laughter that stems from the center of his chest and vibrates through Tony, making his skin spark and dance with adrenaline and joy. Their conversation ebbs and flows, moving gently from one subject to the next, and even the silences in between are comfortable, familiar. Tony feels no need to fill them with noise, no need to do anything at other beyond enjoy himself in the moment. He hasn’t been this happy in so long that he’s almost forgotten what it feels like, how easy it is to be near Steve.
Tony’s face is on fire, a blush burning its way across his cheeks, the heat of it making him dizzy, as he glances towards the doors where Steve stands, spine straight and stiff. Steve is listening, Tony know he is; he can’t help it. Howard’s eyes glance towards the doors as well, and Tony watches as frustration and disgust dance across them. So Howard know that Steve helps him through his morning hangovers and doesn’t like it it. So what. Tony spins back to the right.
He stops himself again, lets a small shiver rush through him as he shakes himself, shakes off the lust that he normally forces to lie dormant deep in his gut. His eyes continue their slow meander down Steve’s body, hungrily eating up the curve where his neck meets his shoulders, following the line until the top of his soft blue tee hides him from Tony’s eyes. He’s in the process of registering the broad width of Steve’s shoulders, how tightly they pull his t-shirt, how the muscles of his biceps are nearly ripping the seams, when Steve moves, only slightly, but enough to let Tony know he’s cutting his perusal close. His eyes drop down faster, drinking in the strong planes of Steve’s stomach, the abs defined by the shirt that must be one size too small, then further, to Steve’s lap. To the half formed tent in Steve’s pants. And it takes him longer than it should to fully understand what that means, because suddenly his genius brain has shorted out and heat is rising into his cheeks, making his face feel hot and too tight and he needs to, he should, he -
The cycle resets.
For once in his life, Tony listens. The rest of the trip home and into his bed is uneventful, forgettable. In the morning, Tony won’t remember giggling wildly as he tripped over the garage steps. He won’t remember Steve carefully directing him around the island in the kitchen to the steps in the foyer, or Steve keeping a firm hold on him as he gracelessly walked up them. He won’t know that Steve stopped him in the bathroom, made him brush his teeth and drink a glass of water. He’ll have no idea that Steve got him out of his dirty shirt and suit jacket, helped him change into his pajama pants. When he wakes up, Tony will be under the impression that his sheets just fell on him like that, perfectly tucked up to his chin. He won’t think about it too hard. He never thinks about it too hard. It’s easier for him to not know that Steve Rogers has spent the last eighteen years looking out for him.
Tony sighs his thoughts into his hand and lets his eyes catalogue Steve as a distraction. His large frame is stuffed into the chair, head tilted back in a position that can’t be comfortable. The dark blonde eyelashes dusting Steve’s pink cheeks are fluttering gently; he doesn’t have much longer before Steve is fully awake. His eyes move from Steve’s only slightly mussed hair to his softly parted lips, pink and full and a little dry from Steve’s snoring. Tony doesn’t care. They’re still beautiful, still kissable, still begging to be wetted by Tony’s tongue -
Tony can feel Steve hesitating behind him and has to stop himself from turning around and begging Steve to stay. He would, if Tony asked, would do almost anything if Tony asked him. But Tony isn’t a child anymore and he can’t go running to Captain America every time his daddy upsets him, makes his chest feel tight, and his heart race. He has to face this alone, he knows it, shouldn’t have even dragged Steve into the lab in the first place. And then he feels it as Steve starts angling away, feels the loss of the heat that radiated from him, leaving Tony’s back cold, bereft. He suppresses the shiver that crawls across his bones at the loss, clenches his hands into his thighs so he doesn’t turn and dig them into Steve’s shirt instead. He doesn’t look, can’t look, can’t watch Steve moving across the lab, leaving him here, alone, unprotected.
Tony doesn’t see the blush shining faintly on Steve’s cheeks as he looks back down. He is too busy staring at the most fascinating water spot growing on the tiles of the ceiling, trying to decide if it looks more like a lion or a monkey. He decides on lion, though he could be wrong, it’s hard to really tell when he’s blinking so furiously that he only catches glimpses of the spot. He sniffs once, twice, looks back down at his completely shredded napkin, and wipes his nose.
His eyes are cold, tired, the lines around them cutting creases that make him look old and worn down. A frown plays at the corners of his mouth, and Tony tries not to roll his eyes. He couldn’t possibly have disappointed Howard any more this time around than he did the last time. It’s an act, an attempt to manipulate Tony into guilt, into feeling like he should apologize. And maybe he would have, once, and maybe he would have even meant it, but now he just stares blandly back, praying this will end quickly so he can call Ty and find out where his next party is going to be.
He shifts forward, eyes suddenly bright and alert, leg bouncing under the table while his hands tap a nervous rhythm across it’s sticky top.
Tony starts and his eyes snap to Steve’s and he doesn’t….he doesn’t look like he’s joking, like he’s trying to trick Tony into talking. He just looks mildly curious, interested. Attentive. Like he wants to listen to Tony, genuinely wants to hear what Tony’s been working on, what he’s been up to when he’s holed away in his lab and Tony…
“Water.” Steve nudges him, makes him sit up halfway before placing a cool glass in his hand. Tony brings it to his face blindly because the sunlight still hurts and makes his head throb. He sips at the water greedily, begging it to heal him immediately. It won’t; it never does. He tries not to chug it down in one go anyways. He knows from first-hand experience how well that would go over with his stomach right now and he’s not eager to look into the bucket again so soon. After he’s drank almost half the glass, he tries to speak again.
His thoughts slow with the bike as they pull up outside of Luke’s and Tony can’t stop the smile that breaks over his face. It’s a hole in the wall, really. A tiny place in the heart of Brooklyn, opened sometime in the late 50’s and somehow still around and doing business, even though there’s usually only one or two patrons ever there at a time. The checkered tables are always covered in a thin layer of grease, the red leather booths are all cracking and torn, and generally there’s only ever one waitress working at a time. The menu is short, no nonsense, burgers and breakfast food, all filled with a disgusting amount of cholesterol. Their burgers are passable, their fries often overdone, but their milkshakes, oh….they’re sweet, sugary, thick enough to need a spoon, and bursting with flavor.
Howard continues tinkering with his project, paying little attention to Tony as he resumes his spinning. It’s hard for Tony to sit still at the best of times, and neigh impossible in situations like this. Tony is sure it looks to Howard like he’s just distracted, like he isn’t interested in anything Howard is about to say. He doesn’t care. The silence stretches on, Howard working, Tony spinning, looking for things to distract himself with, and he is contemplating getting up and leaving when Howard finally puts down whatever it is he’s working on and looks up at Tony.
He doesn’t look, but he does hear.
As soon as they reach the garage Steve picks Tony up like he weighs two pounds and plunks him onto the back of his bike. He grabs a helmet off the handle bars, plops it on Tony’s on head. It’s too big and falls over Tony’s eyes, blocking his vision and making him giggle. A thick finger moves into Tony’s eyeline, pushes the helmet back up gently. Steve’s face is revealed to Tony again and he’s smiling sweetly, chuckling, and Tony feels his stomach swoop and dance and suddenly his little genius mind is hyper aware of the way Steve’s nimble hands move as they buckle the helmet, of the space Steve occupies. And then Steve chucks Tony’s chin and winks at him and Tony stops thinking all together. He just watches as Steve swings a leg over the bike, settles into the seat. The engine rumbles to life beneath them and Steve tells Tony to hold on and Tony does, wrapping his skinny arms around Steve’s big waist. He grips Steve tight as they drive through the city, the lights from the buildings they pass twinkling in the sky, blurring into a rush of yellow against the deep blue of falling dusk.
Tony is nine years old and Howard is laying into him about his engine building technique. He’s trying to help build a new type, a hybrid Howard calls it, part machine and part computer and Tony loves it, he does, the blend of the two, but he’s struggling. He’s only just finished making his own OS and now he’s trying to put it in a car and it’s hard but Howard doesn’t care, doesn’t want excuses. He just wants results. He can’t present excuses to the board, Tony knows, so Tony needs to do better, to be better, to use his stupid genius brain and figure it out, because isn’t that what his brain is for? To think and work and make his dad happy? And then Howard is yelling at him again because why is he crying when he should be taking criticism like a big boy, like a man, and Tony is scared and Howard is going to hit him if he doesn’t stop but he’s shaking and he can’t get ahold of himself and -
Steve is sitting in a chair so close to the bed that his knees are hitting it, the bucket between his feet. He’s wearing grey sweatpants and a white shirt, over which his arms are folded, and his mouth is, indeed, set in a frown, lines creasing around his lips, but his eyes…. His brows are drawn down, but the ocean blue eyes underneath them aren’t disappointed or even angry. They’re sad. They’re staring at Tony, roving over him, and there’s an overwhelming sadness in them, and Tony is suddenly struck with an all-consuming need to crack a joke and make the eyes sparkle, or run his hand over Steve’s face and smooth out the lines. He needs to do something, anything. Anything to ensure that those eyes never look so broken again. His brain’s command to move and touch is halfway to his hand before Steve interrupts it.
His face is drawn down, his mouth a tight line of chapped skin where his teeth worry over his lips. Small lines of concern spread from the corners of his eyes, turning them dark and sorrowful, and Tony suddenly knows he is finally seconds away from the lecture, the one where Steve tells him how disappointed he is, how just like Howard, he thinks Tony should be spending more time on his studies and his robots and building, creating, doing, doing more and more and-
Because Tony exclusively uses zippos; fancy gold ones that cost more than a car, small silver ones that shine like glass.
But later.
So he drinks. He parties. He tells Steve he needs to blow off steam, needs to be away from his dad. Pretends the sad look in Steve’s eyes and the droop in his shoulders every time he leaves the house with Ty doesn’t bother him. But sometimes, whenever he deigns to be honest with himself, he thinks about it and he knows. He knows that all the drugs and drinking, all the parties and the beautiful people and the frequently bad sex he has with them….they’re all a pathetic, desperate attempt to fill the ever growing void that gnaws at his heart, that hollow dark place that sits empty and cold inside him, longing to be filled by Steve.
Waiting on Tony… the pieces slide back into place with alarming clarity, worming into Tony’s brain like parasites, making it pound with memories, and he slaps his hand to his face. The meeting. The shareholders’ meeting. The meeting that could not only decide the fate of his future in the company but also Howard’s. He missed it.
“Easy there, Tony!” The blowtorch is plucked from his grasp and placed further back on the desk, out of his reach. Mr. Rogers is in his uniform, kneeling in front of him, his eyes crinkling with a kind smile. “Gotta be careful! We don’t want you getting hurt. Here, why don’t you play with this?” He places his shield down on the ground where Tony can reach and Tony’s eyes widen to the size of saucers. He knows how important Mr. Rogers’ shield is; daddy has told him so many times, usually when Tony asks if he can touch it. Mr. Rogers smiles at him again. “We’ll be done soon, champ, and then I’ll play with you all day, okay?” He ruffles Tony’s hair and goes back over to Howard, leaving Tony with his new favorite toy.
“I’ve watched you grace the pants off even the most stubborn of boardroom executives, convincing them to listen to you, to take you seriously, to hear your ideas. You pull people into your orbit, Tony, and you don’t let them go until you’re good and ready to, and believe me when I say that they always wait for you to come back.” He stops, catching Tony’s eyes again, ensuring he has Tony’s undivided attention before continuing. As though Tony could even think to want to give his attention to something else right now.
Tony makes him wait, a teasing smile curling around the cigarette.
“12:18 pm.” His voice is tight and Tony knows that if he looks, he’ll see Steve’s eyebrows drawn together in disappointment and his mouth pulled down into a frown. He doesn’t want to see that face this afternoon. He looks anyways.
“Yes. Where are you?” Steve’s voice gives away no emotion, but Tony knows he must be nearing the end of his patience with these calls. It’s the fourth time this week Tony has had to call him for a ride because he’s been too drunk or high (or both) to see straight, let alone drive.
"You don’t have any virtues, Tony."
He tears his eyes away, doesn’t want to look anymore, doesn’t want to see, doesn’t want the train of thought that starts tugging at him, pulling him down a path where he’s no longer in the bed but is instead sitting in Steve’s lap, feeling that length grow harder underneath him as he rocks his hips. He could wrap his arms around those shoulders, let his fingers cling to the muscles barely hidden under the shirt, kiss the soft lips. He’d get to watch Steve wake up with wonder in his sleep fogged eyes, feel those big hands wrap around his waist as he registered Tony straddling him, grinding against him, as he took a breath with Tony’s mouth less than an inch away and -
“Tony. You’ve done things, accomplished things, that no other man your age has been able to do. Even Howard. And you know why? Because you’re better than he is, Tony. You’re smarter, you’re more clever, hell you’ve built every recent accomplishment he’s claimed!” Steve stops again, breathes hard through his nose, flexes his hands a couple times. “Look. I’ve watched you grow from the brightest most curious child I’d ever met into a handsome genius who’s building his own artificial intelligence program. And everything you bring into this world, you treat with care and affection, because you understand that even a silly robot like DUM-E has value, has worth, and deserves to be loved. I just wish you'd realize... that's true for you, too.”
They wander in, a little bell over the door jingling their arrival to the one waitress hanging around behind the counter. She looks up from cleaning, smiles a light “Hello!” in greeting and directs them to a booth in the corner. The leather seats of it are cracked and split and they creak as Tony and Steve slide into opposite sides. Their waitress wanders over, smiles and introduces herself, and Steve gives their orders (two burgers and a soda for himself, one burger and a large vanilla milkshake for Tony). Tony watches her stroll back behind the counter and stick her ticket up in the window for the cook who’s appeared there. They sit in companionable silence after she’s gone while waiting for their food, siping waters that she brings before disappearing again.
“You missed the shareholders’ meeting.” He sounds tired rather than angry, disappointed. Tony doesn’t respond and he sighs softly. “You know how important that meeting is, Tony. I expected better of you.”
They’re unfiltered Camels, the cigarettes he smokes on a semi-frequent basis. The same kind Obie smoked… because it was Obie that gave him his first. He tried to change brands after the betrayal but. He couldn’t. Everything else tasted wrong when he tried, would burn in his throat, gag him, or just plain taste bad.
Steve sighs deeply and cups Tony’s face in one hand.
And he knows that the click of the lighter is immediately a trigger for Steve. He’s seen it, Steve’s response. Sometimes, when they’re in a meeting, he’ll idly take the lighter out and flick it, on and off. He slyly watches Steve squirm for nearly thirty minutes and then after the meeting pulls Steve into an empty conference room to take care of him.
And he just… he can’t stop. Especially when Tony is sliding slowly into him and he seeks out Tony’s mouth or his hands… needs that taste on the back of his tongue, the fingers fucking his mouth as surely as the cock in his ass.
The fantasy he wanted desperately to avoid is interrupted by his stomach growling loudly, voicing it’s complaints, and Steve’s eyes flicker open. Tony sees it when he hits full alertness, taking in Tony sitting on the bed, chin in his hand, his stomach still grumbling.
Tony laughs, accidentally blowing smoke everywhere.
There’s an incessant pounding in his head, beating in time with his heart, and Tony closes his eyes tighter against it, as though that will make it disappear. His tongue is thick and swollen in his mouth and his throat is dry; he tries to swallow but there isn’t even enough to spit to choke down. He tries to move his hand, to wipe off the dried saliva clinging to his face, but his arms refuse to respond, feeling like dead weights attached to his body and about as useful. He feels his stomach roll as he breathes, nausea bubbling up, threatening to overwhelm him, and he groans, tries to move again, to roll his side, but he can’t, he just can’t. He gives up, even as another wave rolls over him, and then he’s coughing and retching and suddenly his body is moving of its own accord. No - there’s a hand, warm and solid, rolling him, directing him, and when he opens his eyes he sees another, pointing down at a bucket.
