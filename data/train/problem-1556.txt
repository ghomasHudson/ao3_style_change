"John, you must know how I feel about you." He steps closer, and his hands fumble at the buttons on front of John's faded blue cotton shirt. "How deeply I care for you. What I feel, what I've always felt, is far more than friendship. From the moment we met, I knew. I denied myself, but I knew."
"You and your brother snuck cigarettes? Together?" John laughed, turning the bottle in his hand. He set it down, then took another bite of pastrami. "Perfect."
“Not so at ours. With no resistance, thieves had pilfered our labs and estate. What I came home to was all but abandoned. My first duty when I arrived was to secure what I could of what was left. I managed to resurrect a few of the generators and put my talents to the test as an alchemist to deflect further theft while I also continued work in the labs to find a new serum to stave off my scent.”
“I’ll give you the damned bomb if you leave and never come back,” Sherlock said. He waved James off with the back of his hand. He knew it would never work, but it was the thought that counts.
There were even some surprises: Summers visiting “Skully” Island were really Sully Island. Pictures of Eurus and Helena on the beach. Memories of Redbeard at his feet. Scenes of Christmases long ago.
“I knew you remembered.” She’s blinking and looking over John’s shoulder at Sherlock. “But not it all. Or else.”
The man eyes flutter shut as he presses his lips tightly together in concentration. “Fear triggered in my amygdala, releasing stress hormones to my sympathetic nervous system. My hippocampus and the frontal cortex processed this contextual information, while my inhibitory pathways dampened the amygdala fear response. My brain functioned efficiently.” He opens his eyes and looks on at John frankly.
It came as a blessed relief to deduce the old fisherman who’d stayed here before. The old man had left more than Jack Daniels: stacks of magazines, a beat-up fishing hat on the fireplace mantle, his tacklebox and fishing pole. His thermal underwear.
“Before you say no, I have one more proposition for you. Actually, it was Mike who suggested it. The more I thought on it, the more it makes perfect sense. I could use a flatmate.”
I had wondered before. It is now confirmed. The folds. I read it again. A sudden panic washes over me. I recall how Mycroft and I desperately worked to understand the song lyrics to find Red Beard’s location. That was the cryptic riddle before, now it is a poem.
At Mycroft's name, Sherlock nods and, after refilling his rehydration bottle, leaves him to rest. A few hours later John wakes again to Sherlock checking the wound on his leg.
John clenches his fist, breaking the thought. He was about to write down. Again. This is no good. He's already written about how his wife and daughter died. He's gone over and over the sixteen chaotic days from when Mary first developed symptoms to when Rosie was taken away with Mary to one of the designated quarantine facilities. He wants to remember and write about the good in their lives. He starts to type again when he realizes he'd forgotten what Mary called Rosie's stuffed lamb. How could he forget?
He checks the time. John shouldn’t be home for another hour, so he has time to go upstairs, get his meds.
While Sherlock appreciates John’s blushing, he can’t help be frustrated at how John can be so obtuse at times. How does John not understand that Sherlock’s comment was a hint? Sherlock would love to make lots of interesting things happen in this room and in John’s bed. He was so sure that John was interested in a sexual relationship.
His textbook was open to chapter three on inorganic molecules, but John's eyes weren't tracking down the page. Instead, he stared at the middle of that page, his right hand clutching the bedspread and his foot bobbing nervously. His behavior was out of character. John always greeted him, even if it was just a grunt or wave.
Molly turns on the radio and tunes it to oldies, although Sherlock wonders what the term oldies actually means. Shouldn’t oldies be classical composers like Chopin not something called the Rolling Stones?
“Excuse me if I’m being forward, but I need to know. You are my son’s doctor and friend, but might you be something more to my son?”
I walk the path I have chosen. My father’s voice echoes: "Walk and talk through the world as an alpha but never think as one."
Abraham Markham hands it to me. It’s folded into the shape of a heart with my name on the front. My own heart thumps rapidly. I’ve only just remembered part of that piece of me, but I do know her handwriting.
"You're convinced that I'm not a dangerous person, but you're not sure about yourself," Will explains. "And I believe the reverse to be true. We're at an impasse on that point, but as we're talking about dangerous people, protection seemed like a logical follow-on."
This is abominable! He can’t think! Sherlock eyes the thick case file folder with his name written on it, resting on the table where Sophy left it. It’s not proof. Far from it. But there’s enough to make him wonder. But what does it all matter? He’s no longer a possible threat to those he might harm. Why is he worried that John Watson hasn’t answered?
"That Moran chap said you took out half a block with an open chest wound. You can turn this to stone."
This is an example of a character in the story taking ahold of the author and leading them down a different path than intended. From the story’s conception (which was long ago and far, far away), I’d always intended for the reveal to John to be the turning point of the story. I’d even thought of ways that John might uncover it then, confront Sherlock. Even as John carried the envelope back, I intended for Sherlock to keep his mouth shut about it. Imagine my surprise, when Sherlock gets a mind of his own and blurts out at the end of this chapter, “The other man in the photo is me." I almost deleted it, then I realized that this was the best possible plot turn for the story and gave me an entirely new avenue to explore.
One is next chapter may be a bit longer wait since I'm up to where I finished writing it at this point.
Sherlock had a gun to his head! Any wrong move on his part and … shit! John steadied his gun and clenched his jaw.
. He felt excited. He felt regret. He felt unsettled. More unsettled than he was regarding his connection to Pandora.
“A shame. I understand that you are having a difficult time meeting expenses. I would be more than happy to make it so that you would not have to participate in the work study."
Sherlock huffed and grumbled under his breath as we continued through the family graveyard and across the moor toward the manor, but he also had a bounce in his step. He was far too happy for this to be anything but one of Sherlock little games.
John's voice is soft, but his jaw is tense, and Will pauses before answering, choosing his words. "It has a psychosomatic component. Like your leg." He looks up. "Oh! I'm sorry, John."
It was when John lost his father to the bar all weekend that John felt his life began to grow darker. His dad lived at John's Tavern. When John was younger, he'd thought he liked the idea of a tavern with his name. It was almost like his dad was hanging out with him. But he came to hate the place as the years passed. He'd lost his dad to John's Tavern.
“You’re trying to distract me.” John takes a sip, following Sherlock with his eyes from over his cup. “Exactly what
He sighs and decides he could do with a walk in the park instead. That will clear his head and then he can head back into the fray.
He'd learned about the secret rendezvous site by chance, sitting in Martha's Truck Stop at three in the morning. The truck stop was only three miles from the place his family had rented him until school would begin. It was tedious waiting for the summer classes to start. There wasn't much to do, but he did like watching the customers here. His landlady ran the place, and she gave him free refills of coke and coffee.
"What? This is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me. You think I'm gonna say no to this? I'm keeping the job."
"I'm sorry. I would give you something for the pain, but I need to know what part of your arm there is to salvage. This is despicable to let you suffer like this and allow the infection to spread as it has. We need to get your fever down."
I spun around, but it wasn’t John. A homeless man stood in front of me. He was John’s height and build. His hands were loose at his sides. His face was unshaven and peppered with grey. His clothes tattered.
It's written on the yellowed notebook paper he found left behind in this place he hates more than his own life at the moment. Writing the fucking note makes him more seasick, but it at least gives him some sort of purpose.
“No, and I am not going to. Yet.” I begin. “You want my help out of this mess you are in. My brother is not someone you want questioning you. You have little to worry about from me. He brought you back because he knew you were harmless, but he said you hold information needed to end this expediently, and I don’t mean the note. He knew I would get said information more readily than he would.”
Much of what I’ve read about in the research our own labs have duplicated. To think of the time we could have saved and the progress made if we’d worked together. I recall suggesting this myself to Mycroft, but he said it was a poor business practice to do so.
“Oh, but what a waste. You have remembered much more than you’ve let on, haven’t you, Sherlock? But I may need your help. That bothersome blog of Dr. Watson’s has damaged what progress we’ve made convincing people that they need our guidance,” she says, and points the gun down at John Watson. Sherlock keeps his face blank.
“So, we’re both just slumming in the psych department,” she said, and nudged him playfully in the side.
“A millionaire. He made most of his fortune in real estate. He's owned various companies. And yes, a few are pharmaceutical. He’s a recluse— before the Pandora, he was visible but only intermittently. After Pandora, he’s become a mystery— it’s rumored he’s housed in the top floor of one of the tallest buildings in Cardiff.
Fear was also so much more manageable with someone around who cared. Redbeard had cared. He used to jump on the bed and huddle up to next to Sherlock after one of his nightmares.
"And tell him we're locked in a walk-in freezer? I think I'll wait for Miss Frankenstein, thank you very much." I still pulled out my mobile. No reception. It wasn't even an option. I huffed and puffed into my hands to warm them.
“You bloody cold fish!” John struggles against the men holding him as Sherlock passively turns his head to watch the scene. “You know your mum almost died thinking her last words to you were cruel! They weren’t cruel enough!” John catches his breath. “What a tosser you have for a brother.”
Sherlock had ample opportunities to come clean to John. What type of fucked-up relationship did he have with James Moriarty that made Sherlock think that this was the way a relationship functioned? Lie about how they really met? Was James telling the truth? No. Couldn’t be. The man took pictures of them! That was truly fucked up.
Sorry for the delay! Real life and all, but here it is. Some answers and even more questions for our Sherlock.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “I hardly think you would surround yourself with idiots. The fact that she and Lincoln survived the havoc after the epidemic should have been a clue that they have superior minds.”
“Mycroft texted. He said it’s late, and he’d already planned to keep Rosie overnight,” John says. “He’ll bring her back in the morning. Wouldn’t be surprised if he had Anthea run out and buy a fancy bed for her.”
Sherlock paced the cabin floor. It was his habit of late. James and the others had tried to turn John against him. James had tried to manipulate John’s memories and thoughts and feelings. Most likely using suggestions in the beginning with Mary and Moran. Then hypnosis. Sherlock realized it the moment he saw James’ tapping. He wondered how much and how often they had tried to alter John’s memories, to manipulate him.
. And John had the perfect sugar ratio. It was like some sort of supernatural fluid flowed through Watson's veins instead of blood.
God, it's all too much for John to take in. That she would have killed Sherlock. That she pretended to be someone she wasn't. That...
“He is a pompous bloody arse is what he is!” Lestrade huffs, striding towards the nurses' station. John laughs sympathetically.
“I didn’t believe it either. That’s why I thought the whole experience was a hallucination. Then one of them came to me again. About a week before Mary shot me, I was browsing in that old bookshop I love in Soho. One of the same angels who visited me in Afghanistan took me aside and told me I would need a new vessel.”
“You’ve been doing well these last couple of days. No headache,” John says, setting his fork onto his plate. “The less stress you’re under, the faster you’ll heal.”
“Let’s get you looked at first, and I’m set to get stitched up. It will keep. You need to rest. I’ll find you when I’m done.”
“Why don’t I use your blogger’s gun?” she says, reaching out. One of her men places John’s service revolver in her hand. She points the gun at Sherlock’s head.
John wiped off his forehead with the back of his hand before he began digging for his notebook and pen out of his backpack. The professor hadn't missed a beat, and John crossed his fingers that his late entry had gone unnoticed. He reached into his bag only to have his pen slip from his fingers. His heart sank as he watched it roll under the chair in front of Molly.
When John had spoken that name, Sherlock's first instinct had been to flee the room. But he stood fast against his fear that James Moriarty was
“Why would you continue to insult someone who hit you in the mouth?” Johns says and Sherlock laughs. It comes from his belly and it’s long, loud, and it makes John feel like he owns the world.
Most of all I want thank MrBotanyB, whose collaboration, inspiration, and partnership I treasure as much as Sherlock does his John Watson. No matter where life takes us or how far, I will always be here. Please remember that.
He had been crying, collapsed sweaty and exhausted in the middle of a lane, when he heard the crunch of Mycroft's boots approaching. Sherlock wiped his face and raised his head to see his brother, his arms filled with a wet but excited Redbeard. Sherlock raced up to his big brother, who gently lowered Redbeard into Sherlock's arms.
It doesn't take him long to realize that the book is set on this very island. He becomes lost in the story and reads it all over the next few days. He waits and watches for more signs of people, but none appear. No Sherlock and no more footprints in the sand. He uses the novel and the various books as guides to what's around him. He knows where he is now: Palmyra Atoll.
Sherlock is quiet for a moment, then he reaches out and touches the frame. “That’s Mycroft, I, and Euros with Helena.”
His family had been on holiday. His mum loved St. Anges in the Isles of Scilly, and they often went there on short vacations. He hated leaving Redbeard behind. Sherlock begged and begged to take his best friend with him that summer. It was Mycroft who finally convinced their parents that Sherlock was responsible enough to watch over Redbeard.
He'd looked around for a part-time job that wouldn't eat up too much of his time. John had had to turn down one job at a local grocery that was just too demanding of his time. He couldn't work thirty hours a week and still maintain his grades and keep his scholarships. He'd applied to at least twenty stores and shops in the area, had had two interviews, but nothing came of his efforts in the end.
As if anyone could ever keep me. Paylar wasn't even his real name, but he insisted everyone address him as such.  Ridiculous!
Since I had on a warm jumper, I held out my leather jacket to Ellen, the woman who had opened the door for us and still followed. Sherlock was wearing one of those thin silk shirts of his that barely stayed buttoned. He shook his head and kept his Belstaff.
He watched as Moriarty left. He tapped the pen against the desk as he took a few moments to collect himself. He decided he might as well get back, and he put the pen in his backpack. As he walked toward the dorms, he thought about what James had said, juxtaposed to what Sherlock revealed to him. Something about Moriarty didn't ring true. He hoped it wasn't because he wanted so badly to believe Sherlock.
John continued to talk to Sherlock. He probably didn't hear a thing, but he felt he needed to say it. "I need this job. Besides I already called Seb Moran and told him I'd take it. I'll be working with him most anyway. I'm meeting Moran at eight tomorrow morning in the quad."
Sherlock croaks out, “Yes,” and John leads him to his room by the hand. Every touch affects Sherlock’s groin. He never felt so exposed, so vulnerable, yet so wanted. He can feel his pulse beating in his cock. Every touch sends a new throb of heat into his core.
John’s eyes flicker to Sherlock’s mouth, and Sherlock relives the tactile memory of how warm and excruciatingly soft John’s lips are. He grasps John’s old London Calling t-shirt and pulls him in. He doesn’t know what the Clash is, but he takes the title as an invite as he fits their lips together.
John laughs. A palace. “Rather a romantic notion. It sounds more like a pirate’s perspective,” John comments.
“Ah, if you didn’t notice, you’re bloody brilliant. I guess you could call our director a bit of a maverick. She saw something in you and thought you’re worth the change. Beca’s rather unconventional in her approach to running the hospital, but it works.”
“I understand that, John. But this is necessary. I’m creating tension in Lestrade’s department to make my move that will
"This is very good … the offices on the campus have no security,” Sherlock said. “One can slip inside and procure or add any information to any file."
“We’re not movin’ a thing, but you need to,” the leader barks back, and points behind them. “Ya don’t want ta go ‘n make my mates angry now, do ya?”
“I didn’t understand why I ever doubted your opinion of the assistant professor Moriarty,” John said, looking at the note. “The man is oily.”
“I will,” James said as he stood, “but know this and do not doubt my words: If you do not come with me to London, I will burn the heart out of you.”
“All children suck the life out of you,” she says, unruffled. “Never had a cavity until I gave birth to my twins. A full set of dentures is what they left me, bless their souls.”
He decides he'd better head back to the boat. Throwing his message bottle into this lagoon will do no good. He needs to be on the ocean side of the island. He can head up along the channel and investigate tomorrow. For now, he's sweating and thirsty, and the bottle of water he brought from the boat is long gone. John sits down in the white sand for a few moments in the shade of coconut palms. He's leaning back with his sandals behind him as his toes dip in the water. He imagines this place long ago, pirates on these banks looking over this very lagoon. Maybe there's buried treasure? His first impression that this is just the sort of place Sherlock would love is correct. Aye, matie, leave it to Sherlock to put him on an island once home to pirates. He shakes his head in resignation.
Three dirt mounds over four feet high, each over six meters long by three meters wide, fill the open lot. On them dried wreaths with faded and frayed ribbons, handmade crosses, weathered cards and notes, tattered stuffed bears and babydolls, bouquets of flowers some placed fresh that very day. Most flowers were old and brittle petals: crushed leaves left to lace the mounds like sorrow. Tufts of grass and weeds grew among the offerings—  little bits of life between death.
"At some point he sat the cleaver down as he tried to explain to you that you were lovers. You couldn't see your father, since his unconscious body was obscured behind the butcher block. All you saw was Brutus's mangled body. You picked up the cleaver and somehow managed to cut off your lover's hand. He bled to death on the floor next to your father."
John is chatting everyone up on the walk home. John steps in a puddle and doesn’t swear, and he’s smiling like a loon when he spills some of his tea on his jacket. He comments on how the birds are singing and how the drizzle feels good on his neck. He wears a crooked smile and laughs a bit too loud at Mike’s bad jokes. Even Mike knows something is up. It’s like Sherlock is in a alternate universe. First the note, then Beca visiting the morgue. Molly going out on a date with Anthea! Now this! John shouldn’t be happy. He should be on edge. Sophy Kratides could nab him off the streets at any moment!
“John and your suspect will go to Cardiff Royal. I assured Mycroft that you will keep Ms Kratides under close inspection although expect him to have a few of his own men watching her as well.”
John’s mouth closed as he stared at the pen. Sherlock read the doubt and confusion in John’s eyes. The pen! Of course. He was using it in some way to try and manipulate John.
"Allergic reaction," Sherlock said. "Obvious. You have been scratching and sneezing. It is something in this new environment or you would already be dealing with it. The most common socially-encountered allergens are perfumes and cologne. You don't wear any. I do."
With a smirk, Mycroft intentionally takes Sherlock’s seat at breakfast. Sherlock cinches his dressing gown tighter in frustration and pulls one of the two extra chairs against the wall to the table.
"I'm certain he still hopes to convince me, if not coerce me, to his way of thinking. If not, I may well become his prey, and so, by being my roommate, may you."
He’s on the third floor when John notices an attractive woman walking down the hall ahead of him. She’s got long red hair, a bit unkempt, wearing a pastel-colored paisley dress with blue hospital slippers. Her dress is a bit tight in the bum, and she has a nice curve. John has to admit, he doesn’t usually go for women this much taller than him, but her bum is pretty cute the way its swaying back and forth when she walks. If he had more time, he’d stop and chat.
And he will because he finds Sherlock just as important, but not because Mycroft demands it. John can’t hide how he feels, and he no longer wants to try to hide it. Greg sees it. Mycroft sees it. His heart knows what it wants.
John sighs and searches in his desk for another pen. "What's this, then? Something to do with those murders?"
From the ramp he moves, another stairwell. While does his best to avoid security cameras, he simply pretends he belongs to fool those who may be observing.
"I see. Tired and confused. Yeah. I was tired and confused before I stepped inside here. Even before I was LOCKED IN A FREEZER, Sherlock."
"So I've been told." Sherlock let the corner of his mouth turn up. John was blushing beneath his scruffy stubble. It was a look Sherlock enjoyed.
"You left your bed unmade. You never do that unless you are in a rush," Sherlock said. "I was joking in regard to the professor—but you know that. You did, however, run into someone."
I believe John is right. I feel a bit overwhelmed with this idea of Mycroft reading the bedtime story tonight.
changed,” Mycroft says, looking John up and down. “That aside, it would be much more effective if Dr. Watson did not know all of the details.”
When John stops, Sherlock groans in disappointment followed by a sharp gasp of pleasure as John lies fully on top of him. John body fills Sherlock’s edges and angles with hollows and curves. John shifts, and they lock into place. Sherlock’s own gasp reverberates through John.
“I do care,” Mycroft states. “However, sometimes there are ideals and principles more important than our punny lives. Unfortunately in this world, people will not listen to reason unless one is respected, trusted, or feared. I need people to listen. To do that, I will need my name cleared and those who smeared my name cleared
Sherlock paces the floor. John hasn’t come home. It’s been well over two hours, and he still hasn’t returned Sherlock’s last text.
“Do be a dear. Sherlock said you need to bring a few things with you. I have a list.” She handed it to John.
"Because I think it's in his best interest as well as mine, and his country's. I just want to talk to him," she replies.
“Beca, it’s really only a superficial wound. I really need to see Sherlock. He’s had one of his episodes and really needs to speak to me. He seems to have remembered more.”
“I have more of his life stored away. One box is filled with crime scene sketches. Too grizzly and macabre for my taste. I really didn’t want them in the house— but that he drew...me...” she bites her lip and fights back more tears.
John follows and takes a seat at the couch, looking up at the clock. “That’s not going to work this time,” John says.
As Mycroft moves to sit down, John pulls back his fist and slams Mycroft in the mouth. The cat yowls and leaps from Sherlock’s arms. Mycroft flies back and lands on top of one of the tables. John’s hand feels like it’s broken, but it’s worth it. Hitting Mycroft didn’t cool him down enough, however.
Sherlock does remember how much he loved his sister. And that she loved him. He knows she did. She was confused and confined. She never had a mind palace. Maybe if she’d had a place to store all her thoughts she wouldn’t have burned it all down.
“I don’t think I care,” Thomas says, as he swabs her arm with gauze after. “Don’t put her under any more stress.”
John's breath catches, but he presses forward. This is why he's begun writing more in his blog recently. He needs a place to put these memories where they don't tear him to bits.
“How do you know that?” John’s head pops up, and he crosses his arms. “You looked. Of course you looked.”
“I’ve already said as much on numerous occasions. Do keep up,” Sherlock says. He looks all around him.
Life was rich then. A freshly-painted white ranch house with blue shutters in a quiet cul de sac with an attached garage was their castle. During those early days, his mom stayed home to take care of John and his sister, Harry.
Since then, Sherlock spent hours in his mind palace determining why he let James fuck him. He knew the psychological reasons why he might accept being drugged, disrobed, and handcuffed to bedposts. In the end, it happened.
John recalls the fences and cryptic warning signs he'd seen when he found the sea turtle pond during his first week here. So many dangers for a seeming paradise.
He could argue with Mycroft. Tell him that what he sees in Sherlock is not just what John wants to see. He sees Sherlock Holmes, genius. Not perfect. But either is he. Far from it.
“Vivian said she switched them, but it is also possible that Mary only saw what Eurus wanted her to see. Eurus got to us. She got to you, and she got to Mary. She probably believed they were blanks. It may well be that she tricked Mary into loading the gun with the live rounds herself. Think, John! We can’t believe what we think we saw, not when my sister is involved. Use logic. We ignored so much, and the plan worked until now. Eurus suggested it to you and to me. She had us only believe what she wanted us to see or not see. She made me believe. There was no glass barrier between us. Eurus made me overlook the obvious. We were to believe their plan, her hoax. The irony is that the gun was loaded. What I am uncertain about is if that was Eurus’ plan all along.”
No. He can't believe it. Something is off. Over the last few weeks of planning, John has noticed Sherlock's unusually good humor. No temper tantrums or insults about absence of intellect, even with that ninny of a caterer who thought they should go with "seasonal sauces."
“It’s starting to get dark and it’s lights out. I always pull the blackout shades down about this time.” Will helps him. They have actual electricity. No more candles.
It feels like I’ve been struck with a brick. John blamed himself for doing nothing! I can no longer sit by. I kneel in front of John.
“I don’t know,” she said. “I think sometimes it’s best to step back and reassess. It’s really difficult to find housing this time in the semester. You might have to tough it out at least until semester change. You can always choose to ignore him.”
"You're not taking this seriously," John says, rolling over before flattening himself out on the bed next to Sherlock. He unties the knot and starts a new one. Sherlock watches John's fingers intently as he connects the two cords with a double-surgeon's knot.
”On the bed," Sherlock says, his hand slowing as he follows John and spreads himself next to him, pushing one of the pillows aside to make more room.
read the instruction card here, beside the door, before you enter a room. Here, you see, there’s a note to keep the lights low. This patient’s got a head injury and unless there’s a medical need, we don’t want to go blinding him when he wakes up. He’s still unconscious, so: keep your voices low and we’ll just peek inside so you can see how the room’s set good morning, Doctor Watson.” Mike says this last without breaking rhythm, though he looks slightly surprised to see John. John attempts to squint the sleep away from his eyes.
Sherlock can feel everything as John buries himself inside. Sherlock trembles. He feels like he could be on an edge, but knows he’s not. Not yet. He feels as if he’s falling, down, down, down, heat and flames and blood rushing with white-hot heat before his very eyes. John moves inside him, and he’s brilliant. It’s better than any high he’s ever felt, and he’s beyond pleasure. What do you call a place like this? There’s nothing in his mind palace to tell him what this bliss is. Indescribable, undefinable, exquisite.
He almost turned around twice to follow them. He reminded himself that John was capable. Still, doubts formed.
John laughed. "How much worse could he be? This is like something out of one of those true crime magazines my mom used to read."
Then came high school. Freshman year. He'd overheard two boys in the locker room after football practice, heads together, whispering about free blowjobs and more at 818.
“Some good reading on your shelves,” Sherlock says diplomatically, scraping the plates off into the bin. “Although the James Patterson novels you have are rather predictable.”
I cross the room and over to the window. It’s beginning to rain and it patters on the glass. “You would be foolish not to do so.”
John quit watching the pen and studied the man’s face. If the man was lying, he was an incredibly gifted actor.
John remembered his mom setting new tan shorts and a blue checkered short-sleeved shirt on his bed. He remembered the butterflies in his belly as he held his dad's hand. And as he walked between the large foundry doors, he made sure he matched his dad step for step. Inside, the sweltering heat of July was nothing compared to the furnace blast of pure hell of the foundry. But that didn't matter. John felt like he was in heaven standing next to his father as he got pats on the back and boy-howdies from all his co-workers.
John slips off his robe and pulls his t-shirt over his head. He drops his sweats in a heap on the floor, then crawls across the bed next to Sherlock. He props himself up on his elbow and scans Sherlock, checking. Then John leans and presses his face into where Sherlock’s long neck and shoulder meet. Immediately arms and legs weave together, and Sherlock breathes, he’s shaking from head to toe. It’s only transport, he tells himself. He works to calm himself. He needs methodology, step-by-step scientific procedure to explore all that is John Watson.
“Mm,” Sherlock says, straddling him. “I do have something else for you,” Sherlock says. “But I plan to take my time to give it to you. I'll begin by kissing all your sensitive, hidden spots. I’m going to make you gasp and plead.” He nips John’s neck and licks his ear. John groans in approval.
John leads him through our home, and Rosie verifies my earlier conclusion and squeals, “Kitty! It’s a kitty!”
Finally, John is fuming. His face a bit pink. It’s intoxicating to see him flushed. Sherlock sits a bit closer, leaning into his shoulder. A jolt of electricity sparks between them. What magic!
. That same young man, his back to him, his whole body tensed up like he was doing something illegal.
I am watching the people on the street below, going to and from wherever regular people go in the afternoon. One woman wears a red hat and pushes a pram on her way home where she lives with her parents. Another is walking a terrier and carrying a bag of groceries in the other arm. He has no one waiting for him at home. I realize I’ve been holding my breath waiting for John to respond. Except for the wheels of Rosie’s red truck spinning across the rug, the room is quiet.
When he gets to Sherlock’s room, John stops in the door. White sheets compliment his dark, unruly curls, framing his closed eyes and making Sherlock look otherworldly. His arm curls around his head, contrasting his handsome, angular features. His lips slightly part, and John wonders how one man could be this ungodly attractive.
“He said something about having all these rooms in his head— most of them he couldn’t open. He calls it his mansion.”
“Why should she get to have it all? She wouldn’t let me walk away, so I made Mary disappear, permanently. If I had more than one bullet, I would have shot you too.”
He stealthily unlatched the cover, giving a very quiet sigh of relief that none of them popped or squeaked as he did.
John’s heart quickens as he looks around at the roofs. Most are framed flat, some angled like a shed, and a few are gabled. He sees some movement atop too. They continue at the same pace as two men shadowing them keep their distance.
In a dream-like state, John drifted. He could hear bits and pieces of conversations. He didn’t know if they were real or imagined. In his mind he watched Moriarty walk away. John raced after him to the dorm. Like many dreams he’d had, his legs felt as if they had irons on them, holding him back. The sidewalk became a lake covered with ice. He slipped. The treacherous ice cracked beneath his feet, splintering. The lake threatened to take him beneath the ice, never to escape. He was too close to the edge. He had to warn Sherlock. He couldn’t let himself slip into the water. He concentrated on remaining upright. If he fell, he would be lost.
"Time's up! I hope you're ready." He slides his double chocolate wand of wonder inside. John exhales with odd hiccup-like sounds.
These are making a comeback again. I hate them. Impossible to get out of (John has the same complains me) and uncomfortable, these chairs were in every where in the 1970s when they gained popularity. They were around long before the 1960s, however. With a little research, I found their history can be traced back more than four thousand years to ancient Egypt and were also used as training tools in ancient China by students of tai chi.
“You keep calling me little brother, but it doesn’t feel complimentary,” Sherlock says, taking a seat on an old iron cafe chair.
John may say he believes that I didn’t shoot her, but if Eurus is behind any of this, she may have planted some doubt.
Greg hears the innuendo in Sherlock’s voice and his mouth falls open as he looks from Sherlock to John, and John feels like he’s been caught making out with the his best mate’s sister. His face heats up despite the fact they’ve only snogged.
Will stares at John, who keeps looking over and grinning back like a loon. "Those guys were terrible carjackers," John says.
“It’s getting dark.” John said. He massaged the back of his neck. “I guess you should have clocked out an hour ago.”
John supposes that later, Sherlock will rely on John to clean up the mess with Greg and get him on board without telling Greg too much. Not that John can give away what he doesn’t know.
“Batman returns!” John laughs. “All clear. I’ve got him tied in your room all neat and tidy where I found him. What did your brother do? Drive a few blocks and let him out on the streets?”
He forces me into a waiting sedan at gunpoint. I sit down in the back seat with Norbury next to me with the Glock shoved in my side.
He’s googled the name Sherlock Holmes over the last days with less results. A lot less. He’s miffed Moriarty has almost 11.2 million more results than he does. Even Mycroft has more! For a man who was supposed to be covertly working for the government, Mycroft has almost as many hits as Moriarty.
"You're late," she whispered. "Professor Doyle hates it when students waltz in after the lecture has started."
I fall backward against Calhoun. Norbury turns his Glock on me. At that same instant, I hear the blast of a gun. I’m not shot. It’s from John. I hear a splash as Calhoun goes into the Thames. I’m going down as well. A slow fall. I’m waving my arms to balance, but Norbury whirls around, tipping me completely back and I land half on, half off the dock. My head is hanging down over the end. The concrete bucket drags across the planks, catching on a board. I dangle precariously over the edge, but I’m holding on to the dock with my fingertips.
“Yes. I hate talking about them. Always have. I spent years in counseling not talking about them. But now. Sherlock we have to. I know you hate it just as much.”
Doctor Bellin met with me. I'd hoped she was going to congratulate me for being right about the thief after all. Too much to hope, I suppose. She jumped right over that bit and told me she was hiring him as morgue attendant! Not entirely what I was expecting. Then she rattled off these reasons.
As a boy, he began simple and twirled them between his thumb, index and middle finger, learning how to create captivating motions and stunning displays. But over the years, he learned that it was essential to use all the fingers in the presentation. Sherlock dazzled those who watched. Even his mum and dad were impressed.
"I play an instrument also." Sherlock's voice echoed from above like he was some sort of celestial being. "My brother told me not to bring it. He said I would chase away all of my roommates. I of course brought it anyway. I have refrained from playing since coming here."
It's possible it was all three. It doesn't matter. What matters is that he's never seen an attentive Sherlock like this before.
He tries to sleep. He goes to his mansion instead. He forgets locked doors and spends the evening rereading a pharmaceutical microbiology manual his mind instead.
Why hadn’t he told John last night? As cliché as it sounds, he’d had the perfect opportunity, but he didn’t want to spoil the moment. That incredible moment on the couch. Together. Sherlock’s pulse quickens thinking of it.
He makes himself at home and finds more doubled ziplock bags of flour and sugar (he assumes it is since he can't read the labels) and tea, although he's not sure what kind. Someone has added bay leaves to what looks like powdered milk. Possibly. And pilot bread. There's biscuits in tins. And crisps, which he opens and finds stale despite the extra ziplock bags. He sits down at the dining table to take a break from the heat and puts his feet up on the extra bench.
To stave off my boredom, John had given me much of the recent research his family’s labs have compiled and conducted on anatomy and reproduction. He notices that I have the folders scattered on the coffee table.
“No! I mean, later.” And he sets the rose carefully on the table as John pours water into a beaker. It will have to do. No vases. Water splashes onto John’s jumper, and it strains a little darker down his chest. Sherlock steps closer and takes the beaker. He can see a bit of the way down inside the loose neckline. He looks for the scar, but can’t see it. He glimpses the gold of his skin and freckles scattered within freckles, glossy with sweat.
That's the secondary plot here. All by the seat of my polka dot pants. This story pushed me in fits and starts. I’m rather proud of the final chapters, mixing love humor and action together. I have a special place in my heart for juxtaposed emotional moments. I threw Moriarty, Moran, and Mary into the pot along with our boys. Rocky Raccoon's family kind of showed up to help stir the pot. The wall banging is another real-life experience on my part. My parents first home (and mine) was a cottage on a lake where raccoons had made their home before we came. They were noisy rascals. And this story is no exaggeration as to how disruptive they can become.
Sherlock thought it had worked. No more bodies, and the killing spree ended. When he'd come to the United States, he thought it might be over—that Moriarty had gone on to his next obsession.
"We most certainly will not be. I estimate she will find the note in less than two hours. Maybe sooner, depending on how tiring today was for her."
Despite the growing evidence, I found it difficult to believe that Sherlock would pick such an unlikely spot for a tryst. Why not a warm room? With a bed? Even a locked broom closet would be better than this.
“Head injury. I’m afraid he’s had seizures from them, and it’s most likely part of his memory loss. When I first met him, he called himself Will.”
“It wasn’t your fault. None of it. And she … Mary never came close.” He squeezes my hand. “You were gone, and I’d loved you for so long. Then my prayers were answered. But I understand if you don’t ... feel the same ... I’m not the same.”
“Just shut the fuck up, both of you.” Moran’s eyes turned briefly to the door where cold air whistled in. “All clear! Come in boss!” Moran hollered.
"Sure you did." He sets down his fork and looks Sherlock over more closely. He'd missed the signs. The sunburn hid the pallor. His itching from the bug bites explained the nervous scratching. But the shaking, his clipped speech?
With the heat, he's not keen on cooking. There's a tank of fresh water nearby on the shore, but he's not sure if it's potable. He'll need to boil anything he consumes. Best to do that in the mornings. He does find some bottled water that is warm, but will do for now.
During those weeks, my sister opened up to me. The time I spent with my sister, I remained hopeful. I was also very careful. I went to her to help myself heal but also to help her. I thought I had reached her. I know she had helped me understand a part of my past that I never knew existed. Even with all she destroyed, there was a part of her that longed to be loved. I felt it as we played the violin together, and I read to her stories from our childhood and poetry. Yes, one of the poems was this one by Millay. She’d asked me to read it to her. I’d also read
. As much as Sherlock would love experiencing the game with him, he cares for John Watson. He knows that Sophy could make him do about anything if she threatened John. But John is smart and resourceful. He could be an asset to Sherlock undercover. They would have to play this game perfectly to convince Sophy. In his mind’s eye, he sees himself working side by side with John Watson. Suddenly every object in the room is clearer, brighter. Every sense heightened, heart pounding in his ears, he wants to solve this with John at his side.
returned. He'd immediately made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, grabbed a warm Coke, and sprawled out on his bed with his biology text. He scanned and read, mult-tasking as he took notes and turned pages with one hand and fed himself with the other.
Americans were so different to Brits. Some were arses, most of them were stupid, and some were like Martha.
"We have time. We're stranded on an island with just one bed," John grins. "Only the sea will tell."
He sets to work slurping his Captain Watson sundae. John twists and squirms as Sherlock’s mouth and tongue work around the root of his cock, yet avoid the treasure. Ar
The rain blows off to sea as quickly as it came in, leaving everything even more humid and sticky than before.
His heart filled with gratitude, Sherlock closed his eyes, head thrown back in sheer relief. When he opened them, he was staring up at a ceiling tile left askew.
That explained the odd looks all afternoon. He can’t live like the look of disgust on people’s faces. It reminds him of something he can’t remember. It’s almost there in his mind. People who hate him. People who are disgusted by him. People who go out of their way to not be near him.
It seems I am still protecting him from the truth. Now, my motives are simple: protect and do no harm. To do this I must have all of the facts. I need to be able to tell John the truth in full. There is a risk this will push him away. Although that is reason enough for me to not want to reveal all, I along with others have made too many decisions for John. I cannot add to these past omissions no matter how much I want to protect him.
He'd still had the shadow of that black eye on the evening he overheard two men talking about Rest Area 818.
"Why must I hide what I am?" I had wondered. The answer was in the chapter: The lie is that "Omegas who have the ability to transmute are an aberration of unchecked power." They are said "not capable of controlling the enormity of the power they wielded" that they were "too emotional and physically frail" to withstand the pressures of calling, but in reality, omegas were the most capable. No Alpha or Beta alchemist compared to that of the great Omega "alchemystics." Posing as Betas and Alphas became the only way for the Omega alchemystics. They transmuted suppressants.
"I choose to ignore it. I keep in mind that I am an alchemist first. I have an omega's body. The transport is immaterial."
John lay back down on his bed. It was so short that even his legs reached to the very end. The bed groaned like an old man. He cringed when he heard the springs underneath rub against his guitar case. He’d shoved it under his bed a few days earlier—it was the only place that he could think of to store something as large as his guitar. He’d paid a lot for that case, but better to scuff the case than the lovingly-used Gibson.
Although he understood why John kept it: sentimental reasons. Sherlock had his own. Christmas morning, an eight-year-old Sherlock had unwrapped a shiny spy glass from his Uncle Rudy. This treasure became his constant companion. While the spy glass had its practical uses, that was not why Sherlock cherished it. It was that it was from his Uncle Rudy, who'd gifted the spy glass to his nephew with love. He even wrote it on the card (which Sherlock also kept): To my curious young scientist Sherlock from your dear Uncle Rudy.
“Somethings are better left behind. I really don’t have much. Not even the clothes I first found myself in.”
It’s the second check that night that got me worried. I woke with a start from one of my nightmares—  the usual one where I’m on a battlefield and a mate is shot in the chest, and I can’t stop the bleeding. I heard yelling upstairs. Forgetting Will was here, I grabbed my gun. As soon as I realized Will was having some kind of nightmare too, I put it away and went to check. At first I didn’t think I should go, but his medical condition concerned me. I stood on bottom of the stairs a moment and listened. He kept yelling, but I couldn’t understand a bloody word, so I went up.
After that, his dad only worked odd jobs, if at all. His mother didn't plant petunias or marigolds because she was too busy working as a cashier at the local Kroger store. Life became a series of mindless habits. The entire family became a mirror of his father's apathy. The house was not a home. It was listless kisses on the cheek, obligatory goodbyes, and aloof I-love-you's. Still, they remained a family and his parents remained married. John couldn't figure out why. They slept in separate rooms and rarely spoke. She served him dinner, when he was around, in his thread-bare lazy boy in front of the TV, where he'd complain that his mashed potatoes were cold and the gravy lumpy.
“You’re always in the middle of some experiment. Waiting for you to come to your senses is so tedious.” He tapped his shoes on the floor. “You’ve become boring with your little playmate. He is rather cute. Such lovely blond locks and puppy dog eyes, but I bet he bites.”
She pinches his leg hard and he flinches. Then she takes his wrist and feels his pulse. “Not done yet. I do wish you’d hurry up and die. I have so much to do today.”
"We do have the proper sustenance," Sherlock adds, pointing to the ice cream. "We could survive here on love, sex, and twelve delectable flavours."
As they followed the gory trail and hastened toward the long, ramshackle of a building, Moriarty demonstrated to Sherlock his profile of the murderer. He spun around in circles with the grace of a ballet dancer, his flowing gestures refining each deduction.
Meanwhile, John was lonely, but never alone. He had his guitar. All he needed to do was reach under his bed and take it out of its case. He’d saved up for months to pay for this guitar, bought used from Victor. He doubted his friend had ever tuned it, let alone played it. It was one of the many gifts that his friend had gotten from his parents that had simply collected dust in his closet. He knew he hadn't paid near what the Gibson was worth, but Victor hadn't cared.To John, if a man could love an instrument, this was love. Like all fine guitars, it always sounded best when a touch off pitch, and what was more lovable than that?
"I'm sure you were," he said, gracefully slipping his elegantly lean body between the desk and one of the filing cabinets.
“I don’t remember you. I don’t remember much. I don’t know why,” he says, honestly. Anthea’s seems to be convinced that he doesn’t remember. “I need something. Some proof that you’re really Anthea.”
He's nearing the boat when he sees footprints on the higher ground above the tideline. They may have been here a while but with the sudden rains, he doubts it. He's not alone after all. They're certainly big enough to be Sherlock's, but how would he know? It's dense with undergrowth here. It's possible someone could have been here for days. Somebody had to stock the boat and tend the water tank. John makes a mental note to keep an eye open.
Sherlock had other fears. He learned to embrace his fears and learned from each of them. Fear brought caution in the face of danger. Fear was nightmares, or a big brother who'd jump from behind the bushes and scare him. Fear was his own bloody hands after falling through his window to test its strength, and it was a cat drowned in a well by cruel old man. It was a bad hair day and wrinkled trousers. But nothing, nothing came close to fearing James Moriarty.
“It will be necessary since I had to take the rest of your arm, I’m afraid. She said your arm was a really well-made prosthetic and that she can augment it to fit your shoulder. Tricky, but if anyone can do it, she can.”
Sherlock takes another spoonful of ice cream into his mouth. A smear of chocolate caramel lingers on his lip, and he licks it off. "Will you drop the sex toys!"
Two days later: no problem at all. Sherlock was still walking around smelling like a field of wild flowers, but John had stopped itching.
He falls back onto the bed. “I don’t work for you,” he says and dismisses her as he rolls over and turns his back to her. She sets the other folder on the desk before she leaves.
He tucked my head under his chin. "John, your teeth are chattering. That and shivering are the first signs. But not serious ones, yet."
“And I have drawings,” Sherlock says. “Either can be acquired. I need you to describe to me something you know about Mycroft that can’t be reduced to photo or simply extracted.”
“Oh, and he said to tell you to bring the soup and crackers since he doesn’t have those. He also said something about cigarettes. I wasn’t sure if you had any of them on hand, so I picked them up for you. They’re all in the knapsack behind the seat.”
And why was he gay? Does it really matter why, because he is. He finally was able to admit to himself that he was part of the ten percent. That was what that Kinsey Report book said, ten percent of the population desired the same sex. For the last few years John had written off his desires to the part of the report that said half of the male subjects got hard-ons for members of both sexes. John did.
“Much better. Now, let’s try some of this new lubricant.” Sherlock takes his hand and slathers the final remains of the double chocolate-caramel onto his own cock.
Disappointingly, a middle-aged woman stood there, holding the door in her tiny hands, head peaking around it.
“Yes, it often stems from blocking out something that the patient doesn’t want to remember. I think it’s more than likely when he was injured something happened so traumatic that he found it necessary to block it out. Considering what his mission was, the fate of the world resting on his success, I’d say when he knew he’d failed, that would be enough to cause it.” She seems disturbed. John almost wishes he hadn’t shared this with her. But she nods and accepts as she opens the door.
“It’s intolerable,” he hears Sherlock say. “I simply can’t wear this! I’d rather wear those silly cracker hats.”
"This is not an equivalent exchange!" I cry. My other hand vainly tries to grasp the space where my arm once was. But there is no blood--the heat from the orb cauterized it.
John recalls a silhouette, cradling his violin like a lover. Moving the bow with passion. John wants to be Sherlock’s passion. John wipes his eyes and gets out of bed. He stands in the doorway and listens as Sherlock finishes his Sonata in his mind.
Mary was locked up far away. My brother saw to that, but it felt like she was beside me every moment, whispering into my ears, blaming me for not being the one dead. She was right. I
Well, there'll be no hope of getting off this island unless he suddenly becomes some sort of mechanical genius or learns to sail. He wonders when Sherlock plans to show up. Is he already here? When will he arrive? How? What will John do when he finally faces his kidnapper?
I attempt to sit up, and he gently pushes me back, his wedding band cool against my chest. Missing mate. I ponder on it. He is unattached, hence the intoxicating pheromones washing over me. Not divorced or separated, therefore, deceased.
“She claims it was an easy way to keep her quiet,” John sighs. “She said Mary’s murder was all part of it. She told me her mom didn’t shoot Mary. Guess who she says did it?”
"I applied pressure and stopped the bleeding," he says. "You have lost enough blood to warrant a transfusion, but that's impossible under the circumstances. You need to drink—immediately—and I've made up an electrolyte solution to alleviate the risk of dilutional hyponatremia. It was quite fortunate that it missed your trunk. You did, however, have an allergic reaction. Most unusual. Fortunately there was an epi-pen at the ready in the med-kit and I administered it. We shall watch you for other signs. I cleaned the wound properly, avoiding iodine-based antiseptics, so no infection should set in, but we do have proper antibiotics if there should..."
. Sherlock inched down the aisle, not looking back, yet still knowing they’d stood and were leaving as well. From the corner of his eye, he watched them leave. While he was certain she wouldn’t do anything tonight, he would never trust her. Every fiber inside him cried out to follow behind them, but if he followed, John would resent it. And if he caught Sherlock doing so, he would turn around and tell Sherlock to “fuck off.”
“No use pushing that call button,” she says. “It’s disconnected. Not that your hands will be of any use.”
Thank you everyone for reading and indulging me my final words. I appreciate all of you. In times like these, we need each other.
After Mycroft leaves with our guest, I go online and delve into Abraham Markham’s history, and I find where he is employed.
He doesn't get far before he realizes he should have brought one of the sun hats and looked around to find more appropriate footwear. He grabs a dried palm frond and uses it to shade his head.
“Ta, I’ll see you in a bit. Tell Beca I’ll be there in time for my rounds.” John gives Mike a wave and shuts the door.
“He came here? Yesterday? I thought he didn’t want to come here because he thought he’d be recognized.”
John fell back onto his bed. Wasn't this just the way his luck always went? Everything seems to be falling into place, then someone tries to come in and smash it all to hell. Like his dad drunk on whiskey falling into the kitchen table and knocking the model of his '68 Chevy Camaro onto the tile floor and busting it to smithereens.
“We don’t have the toxicology,” Molly says, “but a preliminary on our part found a sedative was in his system although in our opinion not enough to stop his heart. I’m certain when toxicology comes back it will confirm the drug is a match to that of the other victims.”
The note remains on the coffee table. All three of us stare at it there—even Markham tries to scramble out the chair to see. I don’t need to pick it up. I recite the words aloud with no inflection or hesitation:
He’s pushing her in the high-backed bucket swing. It hugs her safe and secure. As usual she’s singing out, “High!”
Most of it contains what Anthea had already told them, plus a bit more detail as to how he was going to manipulate the shooting. Mycroft's final words were to "be prepared to leave with Anthea."
“From becoming a homicidal maniac like yourself? Or did my sister mold you into what you’ve become? Either way, keeping you two a part for as long as I did saved more lives.”
“Can I speak to the person in charge of this shift?” he asked in his best midwestern  American diction. The damn cord jiggled and static crackled.
"True. But I haven't now. You are merely exhausted from the trauma and still dehydrated. You lost a lot of blood. Your immune system has been taxed. You know as well as I that if I gave you something in those pills it would take more than a few minutes to take effect. Lie back and let the paracetamol work."
John bursts out laughing. “What?! No! You're not a serial killer any more than you are a psychic.” John sucks in a deep breath, lets it whistle out. He knows Will is missing something, and so is he. “What about this as an explanation? You're in some profession where you face death. You don't know that you're not a doctor. All doctors are taught to be detached. Seeing death every day, you have to be. It comes at you in other ways.  Nightmares.”
John waits until Sherlock nods to him that the room is clean. “Other than riling up Greg and making it look like you’re on the outs so Sophy can hear you through her listening devices, you’re just flying by the seat of your pants, aren’t you?”
Will helps John with the crates from the trunk and sets them outside of the garage of his new home. “I promised Mike I’d lock it up for the night and keep it safe.” They both have a laugh. After what happened, it seems silly. “Mrs. Hudson keeps hers here, and it’s never been touched.” John snaps the bolt lock shut.
Sherlock had taken his hand off John's knee and picked up the prescription bottle that John had left on the bed.
Sherlock thrusts his hips. Cocks slip and slide together, the heat from the friction builds between them. Sherlock could time it all, but he lives for the feeling instead. The sweat on their bellies and thighs mingle as they push together again and again and again. Skin on skin.
Moriarty entered the room with all the pomp of a king. It reminded John of Shakepeare’s Richard III’s entrance in Act 2.
the largest circulating, long-running magazine in the world, still has the two regular columns Sherlock mentions to Mycroft in the story. "It pays to enrich your word power" and "Humor in Uniform” were such popular features in the periodical that books were dedicated to them. The word power column continues today and is themed. These quizzes in a multiple choice version format select words to help elevate your diction. Humor in Uniform includes readers' contributions of jokes, anecdotes, cartoons, quotes, and stories from men and women in the armed forces. I should think that John might prefer  “Drama in Real Life” survival stories from Readers Digest.
"This is a destination where people come to get away from the world, just as we have," Sherlock explains, poking through the vegetation of the thickest part of the jungle. "They sail here and squat. They don't always ask. I am not excusing, Mycroft, but it would be easy to miss a smaller live-aboard sailboat approaching, although his surveillance should have noticed when anyone sailed through the channel."
He hums as he makes toast and slathers on the butter. This feels right having Will here. Like it always should have been this way. He even gets a bit sentimental thinking back on London and his family. He thinks of them a lot. His Mary and little Rosie. He writes about them in his journal too. Now, he has someone else to write about, to include. As he hands Will the toast, he thinks at least he knows where his loved ones are resting. So many were buried in mass graves during the epidemic. He got to hold them, say goodbye, even if it was in quarantine center. So many who were kept away from their loved ones. As a doctor, he was allowed. He’s no longer in London to visit the headstones, but John visits them in his memories, his journal. Will doesn’t even know who he is, or who he should miss. Being a doctor, John cared for so many, yet for some reason he never became ill. No a spot or sniffle. After Mary and Rosie died, he wanted to join them. Thought about it.
“Unexpect the expected,” the blog on characteristics of a BAMF said. Maybe John wouldn’t shy from the truth. Maybe I’m the one wrong. Maybe he’s expected it all along. I just never told him.
can repair it! The metal is finely folded steel of rich carbon, calibrated with precision. You can’t allow some simple-minded blacksmith to repair it!"
“You are getting to be your old self in some regards!” Mycroft sits down across from him. “Our Anthea has proved to be a very resourceful woman. I underestimated Anthea and Mr. Lincoln.”
"Not to worry. I won't harm you unless you want," James crooned. "Not until you give me permission."
“No act. For once. This is me. Who I am," Sherlock says. "Do you want to know the truth?” He leans in a bit, making the lasers dance more, then whispers to her theatrically: “It took me far too long to recognize it. I’m happy that the Pandora Epidemic happened! It killed all the
"It is in your best interest to listen. My brother was … is obsessed with James Moriarty. It is an unhealthy obsession. It is also a mutual one. While Sherlock’s vision may be clouded by this obsession, my brother does embody an unmatched talent when it comes to mastering the intricacies of the criminal mind. He is correct that Moriarty is a very dangerous man, but understand that my brother can be just as dangerous. He takes unparalleled risks. That he seems to have found a kindred spirit in you is most distressing to the family. Most reasonable people would have found themselves another roommate, but not you, Mr. Watson. Why is that?"
Over and over I wake unsure how long or where I am. At times I wake myself screaming. It's raw torture. Even my arm is on fire, not the flesh and blood arm that is no longer but the metal substitute. Despite this, the pain is real, very real. I scream, “Cut it off, chop from my shoulder, now! I'd do it myself if you won’t!”
Um, so what about that swing? It what Sherlock and John’s relationship has become. Sherlock has learned to love himself, trust himself. He is completed by his own acceptance of who he is. He is independent on his own swing. If he gets tangled in the swing, he could get hurt. If he jumped off when too high, he could too. Unlike the seesaw, it’s about his actions. With Rosie, John puts her in the child’s swing. Age appropriate. He teaches her how to swing, then let her go as high and as fast as she can. Consider the freedom of flying high in the air. As long as she and Sherlock hang on tight, they’re both in relatively safe seats.Finally, they all soar alongside and in unison, independent yet together. Safe with the ones they love.
John sighed. He’d only planned to work till three o’clock, but if Moran was going to be here after three, he'd take his time with the files and give them to Moran himself. He'd been trying to work out just what Moran did here. The two times he went to his office, nothing was on his desk and he was on the phone listening intently to whomever was on the other end of the line. John suspected it was Moriarty by the way Moran flicked his eyes back and forth at John as he listened to the person on the other end of the line.
He’d love to give William reassurances about his memory, but it’s too soon and too tricky to predict. He needs more information, and it seems this William Hawkins has no answers— at least none that he can give.
"I've done this many times," Sherlock had said. "Cards can be very lucrative. I could use some extra spending money."
Steven picked up his bags. John recalled how Steven shoulders sagged even as he called back to John, "I'm not gay."
“Oh, fuck, fuck,” the man beneath him gritted out. His voice was uncanny. Deep and exotic. There was something else there too. An accent?
“We weren’t after marketability. Believe it or not our interest was in the public good. Yeah, we need to make a profit, but we have plenty of pharmaceuticals that fit that bill. We believe that Alpha’s should take on more of the responsibility for birth control.”
John frowns, trying to put thoughts together without sounding too off-balance. "You talked to him,” John says. “You know he's clever, you can hear he's posh. And to hear him tell it, he's been living with no idea who he is and bloody great lumps on his head. Someone..."
