“I didn’t like those women touching you, Dean,” Cas said while Dean found the oil and dipped his fingers in. “I didn’t like having to watch them drape themselves all over you and I could only stand there and watch.” Dean nodded, putting a hand next to Cas’s head to support his weight over the boy while he circled Cas’s entrance with a pad of his finger from the other. “I’m the only one who gets to touch you like that.”
Dean groaned, his breathing starting to pick up as he felt heat coil low in his abdomen. He could almost hear Cas’s voice now.
slick because it turns you on so much,” Dean asked, pushing back up to his knees. He motioned for Castiel to follow and said, “Sit up so I can take your clothes off.”
“Because I’m more than just my status, just as everyone else is. I’m an alpha, but that’s not all that I am.” Dean gestured to Castiel. “You’re an omega, but you’re not
“It’s for when my brother and his girlfriend visit,” Dean said, “I keep it around in case Jess needs or wants it.”
Benny rolled his eyes. Dean always forgot he couldn't lie to Benny. “You did the right thing, Dean,” he said. “Leaving her there on that island? That was the right thing.”
Dean shoved his tongue into Cas, massaging his inner walls until he started whimpering. From where his arms were, Dean could feel Cas’s thighs trembling and he pulled away as he brought his hand down to rub his finger over Cas’s rim.
Cas pulled his fingers out of Dean’s mouth once more and moved his hand down to grip himself lightly, sliding his thumb over the slit of his cock. Dean craned his head down when Cas didn't bring his hand back up. “Oh, fuck!” His hips stuttered and Dean surged forward to kiss Cas, rough and uncoordinated, thrusting his hips a few more times before he spilled inside Cas with a strangled moan.
The Captain was back in his cabin and waiting for Cas to get done with his shower. He had to hear it from the boy himself.
Everyone looked up to see Ellen standing by the door. She tapped her wrist and smiled. “It is time to go,” she said. Castiel felt his stomach do a flip from how excited he was. He couldn’t stop smiling as his friends led the way out of his room.
“Sh,” Dean whispered, his hands coming to hold Cas as close as he could. “I got you, baby. I’m never letting you go.”
Castiel nodded tentatively, but still walked with her to his room. He held the door open for her, and she made herself comfortable in front of his fireplace.
Meg winced again, but said nothing. She kept her eyes downcast and crossed her legs. Castiel could tell by her scent that she was feeling uncomfortable, but she didn’t regret what she said.
They quickly made their way through the halls to the beautifully decorated chapel all the royal weddings had been conducted in since the castle was built. Castiel could barely contain his excitement as they arrived. Benny, Sam, Jo, Victor, and Gadreel met them at the entrance and each apha linked arms with the omega they were walking down the aisle with and got in line: Sam and Jess, Jo and Gilda, Victor and Charlie, Meg and Gadreel, and lastly, Benny and Alfie. .
A string of curses left Dean’s lips as Cas started to pick himself up and fall back into Dean’s lap. “Fuck, Cas!” Cas couldn’t stop himself from repeating the same words over and over again:
Dean didn’t say anything and pushed the ringer again, taking a step back and turning to face Amara. He waited for what felt like hours before speaking again.
Jess stepped back next to Castiel and took ahold of the hand he had on her arm, squeezing it to comfort him. Castiel let go of her arm, but kept his hand in hers as Jess pulled him over to sit down between her and Alfie.
Jo cut Dean off with a snort, “Doesn’t matter if you need him to or not, he’s your brother. But he’ll come to his senses. Just as Benny and I did.”
“Forget it,” he said, and before Rachel could get up, he left, grabbing his things from the library, and then heading out. He knew he should go to the hospital because he’d never really been able to take a hit, but the adrenaline and anger coursing through him was keeping him on his feet. It was just like Jo to take her anger out on him after something like that, but for Rachel to take her side? Castiel guessed he shouldn’t be surprised. He was just…
Castiel scowled again to himself because he may have the ability to hear thoughts, but it felt like Dean could read his mind even better than him; and even without powers.
It was around noon when the carriages stopped and Cas was ushered out. He was told to follow his father and before he knew it he was standing behind his father as he spoke to the King of the Kingdom of Hell: His Majesty, Crowley. Only every few words Michael spoke made sense. The others were just white noise to Cas.
“And he’s scared that you’re about to figure that out and not want to be with him anymore,” Sam finished.
Cas threaded his unoccupied hand into Dean’s hair and nodded. Dean smiled softly and kissed him, sliding his tongue into Cas’s mouth at the same time he slid a finger into his heat. Cas gasped softly, and pushed down onto it, tears welling up in his eyes...
Castiel shook his head. “No.” He pulled away from Dean and slid off his lap onto his own legs. “I’m not.” Castiel pulled Dean up from the stool and tugged the alpha with him as he walked back towards his bed.
Dean almost laughed but thought better of it. “Where do you feel it?” He asked, already having an idea of where Cas was feeling it.
The feeling of being incomplete was horrible. It distracted him from what he was supposed to be doing with Amara and got him in trouble. And, well, it wasn’t like Dean really cared if he got in trouble, but he wasn’t fond of the cuts and marks she left when she got mad at him. Furthermore, Dean definitely wasn’t a fan of the worried scent Castiel gave off when he saw the wounds. He hated it when he worried his omega.
“You just want to watch Titanic for the Kate Winslet drawing scene,” he said, smiling as some laughter erupted. “How about Hidden Figures, huh? Came out not too long ago, it’s got great actors, and it’s an amazing movie. I went to see it in the theater with my mate and we both loved it.”
“Gods, Cas,” Dean breathed out, raking his eyes up and down Cas’s body. “You look so...” He trailed off losing himself in the feeling of Cas moving faster and making the chair they were in slide back inch by inch.
“Dean…” Cas whispered. The man was just as beautiful as he remembered. The only change Cas could see was a small pink and healing scar poking out from his hairline.
Time seemed to stop for Dean as Castiel looked up at him, because Castiel’s dazzling blue eyes weren’t what was staring back up at him. Instead, he saw gold. Castiel’s eyes shone gold up at him, and Dean felt the last bit of control he had on his alpha slip.
Castiel took a moment to process everything his siblings had said and focused harder than he ever had to search their thoughts to see if they were telling the truth.
“Yes, Dean, please! I am ready!” Castiel cried. Dean leaned down to kiss him, slipping his tongue into Castiel’s mouth as he grabbed his member and guided it to Castiel’s entrance.
“He will not give me what I want from him,” Castiel said, “I want more from our relationship, and he will not give it to me. He said was that we have to wait until marriage.”
“So why don’t we do that?” Alfie sounded hopeful. Cas generally didn’t want to do anything, but he didn’t want to let Alfie down, so he found himself doing a lot of different things with Alfie and going through the motions. From what he could remember of it all, it was all, not surprisingly, tiring.
Lighting lit up the room again, and Castiel saw the shadows of his wings on the wall he was facing. They flared out behind him in a display of dominance, and Castiel couldn’t help but notice how Dean’s hips started to lift up to meet him when he fell back into the alpha’s lap.
And ever since that meeting with a representative from the Kingdom of Hell blew up in Michael’s face… Well, Cas’s Grace had more than just internal healing to do than normal.
“Why, I believe I can’t say. I’ve promised Ben here it’d be our secret,” Dean joked. Lisa’s mouth twitched up before she could help herself. She shuffled her feet before trying to give the handkerchief back.
Dean flicked his eyes down to Castiel’s chest, and Castiel almost covered himself because his scars were deeper by his rib cage and they were some of the ones he hated the most. But Dean just slid his hands up, tracing the edges of his scars with his thumb. And it didn’t feel humiliating to have Dean giving them attention, either. Castiel didn’t know how he did it, but Dean actually made him feel beautiful.
At the moment, Dean was singing him to sleep. Cas wasn’t really listening to the words, he just liked putting his head to Dean’s chest and feeling the rumble as he sung.
that they were touching you,” Cas said, his voice deep and gravelly. Dean didn’t think that a voice like that could turn him on, but it did and he barely had time to recover from it before Cas’s hands gripped his member tight. “I’m
“You’ll be there when he wakes up,” Sam said, “If Gilda said you needed to get out, then you don’t need to be in there right now.”
Amara’s smile fell off her face and her lips pressed into a thin line. “Throw the next fight you’re in,” she said. Castiel took a moment to process that, looking at Gadreel to make sure he’d heard right.
“Happy to do it,” Dean said, continuing with eating his own meal. Castiel pushed his plate away and slyly scooted closer to Dean. He planted his elbow on the table and put his chin in his palm.
Gabe’s arms came around him, hugging him tight and surrounding him in comforting embrace. “I know,” he said, “I know.”
“Dean, please,” he whined, wrapping his legs around Dean’s waist and pulling their hips flush together.
“Please,” He begged. “Please, I need to come.” Dean raised an eyebrow at him as he tugged Cas’s pants and drawers off the rest of the way, grinning as he bent Cas’s legs at his knees and pushed them up to his chest. He whined and whimpered as Dean moved his limbs.
from his Grace. It was something that was purely Cas and something he was certain only Cas could do.
Castiel’s chest felt tight as he entered, and it grew harder to breathe as he walked deeper into the house. The marble floors documented his every step, and the high ceilings echoed his labored breaths. Castiel may not feel things like other people, but he knew what panic and fear were.
Dean clenched his jaw for a second before Cas ran a hand down his back to soothe him. Once he untensed, Dean rested his forehead against Cas’s and he swallowed to clear his throat. “Who even is she?” He asked.
“You looked for me?” Castiel asked, because he couldn’t believe that. Rachel hugged him tighter and Gabe rushed over to wrap his arms around the both of them.
“Stop it,” Cas chided himself, pulling his covers up around him tightly. He couldn’t think like that. If Dean had really perished some other pirate would be taking credit for killing him and everyone on the Impala. Since no other buccaneer was, then there wasn’t any reason to believe the rumors of Dean’s death were true. And, anyway, the rumors originated from the old and crazy veteran sailors living on their broken down boats.
“Cas?” Alfie’s hand on his back snapped him out of his daze and Cas was able to notice that someone else was in the room too. “Are you alright? What happened?”
Cas nodded, taking a few step backwards out of the kitchen. “Thank you,” he said one last time before turning and walking briskly out into the mess and then onto the main deck.
“What are you thinking about?” Dean asked, smiling in amusement. “You look like you’re thinking real hard.”
“Yes,” Castiel said, and then Dean was pushing in, bottoming out inside Castiel with no resistance in one smooth, gentle thrust. Castiel’s eyes rolled up into his head at the feeling of being absolutely complete. Not even those wooden toys he’d used a handful of times to prepare himself for this could compare. Dean was hitting all the places that he couldn’t reach, and he was being stretched open so wide. Castiel finally felt that itch deep inside him scratched, and it was so much better than he could have ever imagined.
fault,” He said as Cas dropped to his knees. “You didn’t even show up to that meeting! Do you have any idea how untrustworthy that made me seem?! Crowley called me a goddamn cad! What the fuck does he know?!” Michael looked down at Cas and sneered. “Get up.”
Ellen moved aside and Alfie stepped into the room, his eyes widening as he took in everything. Like Castiel, he’d never seen such grandeur before; let alone been this close to it.
“I got you baby,” Dean huffed out. He reached between them and undid Cas’s pants, tugging them down just enough to get his cock out before sliding down Cas’s body and taking the length into his mouth. He bobbed his head like it was what he was born to do.
“Where is he?” Castiel cut Gabe off. He looked from sibling to sibling, trying to find where they were keeping Dean in their thoughts, but he couldn’t find the information. “I know you took him!”
"I won't," Dean said lowly, watching Cas's face closely. He always made the prettiest faces. And the fact that Dean was the one who caused him to make such faces only made Dean feel like he was special. Not only that, but he was the only one who had ever seen Cas at this state and he was the only one Cas would let see him like this.
“Nothing is as big as you,” Cas whimpered out, “Please?” He turned his face to look at Dean over his shoulder. Smirking, Dean pushed Cas flush against the tiles.
“I’m so sorry, angel.” Dean buried his face in Cas’s neck, keeping him gripped as tight as he could. “I’m so fucking sorry! That night, I was just about to wrap you up and carry you back to our ship when Sam climbed through your window a-and he told me that Abbadon had taken hostage the island that his and Benny’s wives lived on and she was going to kill one person everyday until I got there. And then when I did get there half the pirates in the sea were waiting for me.”
When he was seven, his father had locked him in his room and starved him for two weeks with minimal water because he’d wandered off one day in the market when Michael was teaching him about how their town worked. Cas was drawn to the harbor and the ships docked there; he didn’t know it then, but that was himself saying he wanted to get away.
“What do you need, baby?” Dean asked, pushing his fingers against the bundle of nerves inside Cas mercilessly. Cas felt himself getting close.
“I don’t know if I want to see him,” Cas interrupted. “I don’t know how I should feel about him anymore.
“Everyone having a good time?” Cas heard Dean’s deep, rich voice. Nods and sounds of agreements were heard among the pirates at the table along with an enthusiastic nod from Gabe. Dean caught Cas's eye and jerked his head toward the exit.
“I’m sorry, father,” Cas said. Michael made a noise of acknowledgment as he shifted, tapping his foot on the floor.
“We’ve eliminated the last ship,” Benny said. “We’re safe until we make it to shore. And we should get there by sunset.”
Cas tightened his grip on Dean as he went over the edge and Dean came at the same time Cas did, with a quiet shout of ‘
“What?” Abbadon gaped at Dean as he turned around and came face to face with Jess and Andrea. He pulled out his other blade and gave one to each of the women.
By the time he got to the café Dean was at, he could barely keep a coherent thought, because he felt so… Alive. The whole day, it had been like the air was easier to breathe, the sky was a brighter blue, and Castiel didn’t feel like he was going through motions. He felt better than he had in years. And he knew that part of it was due to Dean, but the other part? It had to be that he hadn’t had his medication.
Dean smiled and let go of Cas, scooting up on his bed. Cas came and sat down next to him, but Dean pulled him into his lap, legs on either side of Dean’s hips.
“Let’s get dressed and we can lay together for a bit to get you warm again,” Dean said, helping Cas onto his feet. Cas nodded and held onto Dean as he led them out to his bedroom, again. He dried them both off before searching around for clothes and when he found two suitable outfits, Dean dressed and then started on Cas.
“Fuck, I can feel you,” Dean rasped, resting his head on Cas’s shoulder as his thrusts grew erratic. “I can feel you squeezing around me. Are you close?”
Castiel hadn’t noticed his shoulders had begun shaking and that tear upon tear streamed down his face until Dean spoke up again.
Amara liked knives, and she liked using them on Dean almost too much. He didn’t have scars because Amara was smart. She didn’t want to mark him, she just wanted to hurt him. And seeing as he’d just upset her, tonight would be hard to get through for more than one reason.
“That you love me,” Castiel said, and he felt tears begin falling down his cheeks. “That you still want
“I guess I can’t argue with that logic,” he said, “Sorry to offend, but I’m not stupid, I know I’m attractive—dare I say charming or enchanting, even—” Castiel laughed under his breath. “—and I know the effect I have on omegas. Unfortunately, that effect can attract some underage omegas.”
“That is so good to know,” Dean laughed as he stroked Cas’s back gently for a while before speaking again. “Do you want to go to sleep?”
“I’m not jealous, Gabe!” Cas raised his voice. “Those… Those…” he searched for a word he could use to express his displeasure towards the courtesans that had the audacity to touch Dean.
“Missed you so fucking much, baby,” Dean muttered, sucking one of Cas’s nipples into his mouth and swirling his tongue around the sensitive bud until it was hard. After that, he moved to the other one.
“And love you, we do,” Charlie interrupted, stepping up behind the two and giving Dean a hug. “Happy birthday.”
“What’s up?” He asked, his voice higher than normal. He coughed and pretended as though he had something in his throat.
“Dean,” Cas whined, his thighs quivering and opening wider. “Faster!” Dean kept his pace the same. Right now was not the time for a rough quickie. He knew Cas wanted it, but he wasn’t going to allow that. The pirate looked down at Cas’s cock. He was sure the small length was aching painfully to be touched again.
“Before we do anything we need to send a scout team to shore. Charlie, Sam, and Garth will go. They’re a good team. Effective.”
“Are you hungry?” Charlie asked. Cas felt Charlie sling her arm over his shoulders, something she was too short to be doing, but he didn’t mind. She pulled Cas forward towards Benny’s station.
“Fuck, Cas, you know you cause this boom of thunder and lighting every time you come?” Dean said, groaning into Castiel’s neck on one of his rougher thrusts. “I mean, I can already feel every time you come, but now it’s like I can almost see how good it feels for you.”
Michael started to rifle through the clothes in the corner of his closet. The clothes that Cas kept there to hide the burlap that Dean had given him with his toys.
The smile Dean had on his face now was real and it was smug and boastful. It made Cas smile, too. “And Luci,” Dean threw over his shoulder. “It’s
“I trust you because you’re not like the others. You’ll listen without thinking it’s all about you,” Meg said. She let a beat go by, looking at Castiel in thought before she continued, “When I jumped forward into the future, do you know what I found there?”
“Gods,” Dean said, looking at the man. “Apparently you made a mistake, too, Sandover.” He sauntered around the man, before stopping in front of him and looking at him in disgust. “You’re fucking pathetic.”
Abbadon rolled her eyes and sneered. “I wouldn’t have taken your second chance even if you’d offered your ship, crew, and gold with it.”
“Cas!” Dean growled, letting go of their members and grabbing Castiel’s hand from around their shafts. He pushed both their hands above their heads, and thrust his hips against Castiel’s.
won’t be starting anything and I want them to know that; but we’re not going to go down without a fight if
“Nonsense.” Dean waved him off. “You’re my guest here and what kind of host would I be if I let you do chores.”
But mostly, Castiel was thankful; because she was the one who’d let Dean out. She was the one who’d saved everyone when Castiel had lost control. Ellen was the only person who understood how Castiel felt about Dean. Castiel could feel the love she had for him and his siblings, and Castiel could tell if the situation were reversed, if her children were in danger she would do whatever she could to save them. Just like Castiel would do anything to save Dean.
“But we can’t give up yet, everyone knows that. We’ve reached the shore and defeated Abbadon’s armada.”
Cas felt himself smile. He laced his fingers into Dean’s hair and nodded. “I’d like to get to know you better, too.”
“Ready?” Cas asked, scooting up again, sitting up on his knees and reaching behind him to guide the head of Dean’s cock to his entrance.
“Both,” Cas answered, nudging Dean to lift his head so he could wrap his arms around the man’s neck.
“I am glad you like it,” Dean said. Castiel saw him smiling in amusement out of the corner of his eye.
It started slow. Dean kept his hands on Cas’s hips until he couldn't anymore and he was picking the young man up and laying him gently down on the bed. He did just as Cas had and kissed every inch of skin he could as clothes were shed.
Castiel felt Benny coming at him before he saw, and with all the indifference in the world he turned just in time to catch the punch Benny was throwing at him. He ignored the surprise on Benny’s face, and leaned in, squeezing down on Benny’s fist.
“I’m sick of it here,” Ava said, ignoring Dean’s question. She jerked Cas forward. “If I have to hurt your little pet to get out of this town, you bet your ass I’m gonna do it.”
Dean laughed softly. He nodded his head and kicked at the ground. “I’m sorry,” he said. Castiel rolled his eyes and took a step forward.
“Cas, you’re not ugly,” he said. “You’re extraordinary. You’re stunning and beautiful a-and every other amazing word you don’t think describes you. You’re wonderful.”
Then, he summoned Cas into his study and made him stand in the middle of the room for a good half hour before he broke the silence by standing up and pacing in front of his desk.
“Good,” Dean whispered, latching onto a sensitive spot he knew Cas had and sucking hard. Cas gasped loudly and whimpered.
“Meet in the middle, no weapons?” Abbadon called over. Dean took off his weapons belt, handing it to Sam.
“Yes,” Cas said. Dean’s heart filled with emotion before he crushed his lips against Cas’s and hugged him tightly.
Dean’s eyes raked hungrily down Cas’s flushed body to stop at his cock. There was a steady stream of precome leaking onto Cas’s stomach. Cas was a sight to behold like this: legs trembling, mouth open, eyes squeezed shut, and his cock aching to come. Cas sobbed out a whine. Dean took pity on him and slammed into him, hitting his prostate and making Cas scream out Dean’s name as he came, pulling Dean over the edge with him.
“Do you mind me asking what happened?” Dean asked. Castiel gripped the strap of his book bag again and held onto it tightly.
It wasn’t until Dean pulled away from him that he finally remembered where he was, and his guard went back up immediately. He turned around and pressed his back to Dean as he wrapped them in a protective barrier.
Castiel mewled high in his throat and he curled into himself again as he orgasmed. Dean didn’t slow down though, and Castiel’s body shook from the stimulation.
And then she left, and Castiel stared at the spot she had been until he couldn’t hear her footsteps anymore before he bolted with the intention of never returning—even if he knew he would have to come back, eventually.
Cas looked up at Dean. “When’s your birthday?” He asked. Dean also looked up, an amused expression on his face. They were in the mess, having a midnight snack of cherry pie together.
“I have a feeling you’re still sore from last night. And believe it or not, but I’m sore, too.” Dean looked back up at him. “Plus, I’d like to get to know you better.”
“Right,” Cas said under his breath, rolling his eyes. Gabe sighed exasperatedly and pushed himself up.
“You ready?” Dean asked, after breaking away from the kiss. Castiel nodded, gripping the sheets beneath him and looking up into Dean’s eyes. “Let me hear you say yes.”
“Wait, Meg, stop!” Castiel jumped up and blocked her path out of the living room. “Wait, I’m sorry. It’s… It’s been so long since we’ve seen each other, and I’ve missed you. I don’t want to lose you again.”
“Let us adjourn to the dining hall for sustenance and merriment!” Bobby yelled over the cacophony of noise, but all Castiel could focus on was Dean—his best friend, his true mate, his
“I can’t believe you don’t know about—okay, look, true mates are mates, but it’s different. It’s like—” Gadreel waved his hand like he was willing himself to remember. “It’s not a choice
“Fuck, Cas,” he groaned, “So good.” Cas smiled wider and leaned forward to rest his forehead against Dean’s.
“What does that matter?” Cas snapped, finally turning and walking back the way they came. Gabe blew out an exasperated breath, looking over at Dean and catching the man hold up his hand and point to it with a dangerous look directed at the three women. He furrowed his eyebrows when the three women's shoulders tensed and they hastily sashayed up to another man who looked like he had some coin. Gabe mentally shrugged and turned to follow Cas.
Dean you always make me feel so good,” Cas gasped and strained against his bonds. Dean smiled to himself. He crooked his fingers and watched as Cas sharply inhale a shaky breath and shiver. “Oh my god, right there, please. Right
“Wait, no,” Dean said, untangling Castiel’s legs from his hips so he could back away, “We should wait.”
“I did not think I had a choice, your Majesty,” Castiel said, clasping his hands together in front of himself.
It didn’t take long for the feeling to finally overtake him and throw him into a deeply satisfying release. Castiel hummed in contentment as he came down from the high he’d been floating in and smile at Dean.
“Now, Castiel, how do you feel?” she asked. Castiel glanced up to Alfie, frowning as Alfie wouldn’t look at him and his face still was tinged pink. He took a deep breath and then nodded his head, smiling at Ellen as he answered.
“How has the day been up until this point?” Dean asked a few moments later. Castiel smiled fondly up at him.
Cas gave Dean a moment before speaking. “Dean?” he asked, scooting down on the bed to see Dean’s face.
“He’s right,” Lisa murmured, scouting the crowds to see where Dean was with Ben. “They take this holiday the most serious out of all of them.”
“Cas, no!” Dean lunged forward again, catching Castiel by surprise as he wrapped him up in his arms and slapped a hand over his mouth. “Jesus, Cas!” He looked up at Sam. “And damnit
” Cas gasped. Dean let go of Cas’s hands and undid Cas’s slacks, pulling them off in a swift motion along with his drawers. Cas bent his knees and opened his thighs eagerly. Dean oiled two of his fingers, reaching between their bodies to circle his finger around Cas’s rim and in turn making Cas squirm. He pushed his digits in and crooked them in just the right way that made Cas’s hands shoot up to beside his head, gripping the edge of the table.
came from behind him. The wind around the courtyard began to pick up, and as Castiel turned around with Gabe clutching onto him, his eyes widened at the sight before him.
Castiel surged up and threw his arms around Dean. “Thank you,” he said, and the sound of Dean’s laughter in his ear gave him butterflies again.
Cas’s heart pounded in his chest and he looked at Gabe as his father was pulled from the carriage. Gabe lifted a finger to his lips and jerked his head towards the open carriage door. Cas wasn’t given time to think much about what that meant a before the door to his right was pulled open and he was grabbed by the front of his ugly brown suit.
“You like being tied up, don’t you,” Dean spoke in a deep voice. Cas’s legs jerked open wider. “You like being helpless to me.”
“Dean, just trust me,” Castiel said. He motioned for Dean to move up the bed, following closely as Dean settled against the headboard.
Another tear fell down Dean’s face and Castiel wiped it away. He stepped forward into Dean’s personal space, cupping the alpha’s cheek. And then that feeling from before sparked back to life. That heat inside him ignited and it made him surge forward to kiss Dean.
“Dean… Thank you,” Cas stuttered out, smiling. Dean leaned down and kissed Cas lovingly, moving his lips slow and steady against Cas’s until they were breathing hard. He moved his hands up to play with Cas’s nipples until he was squirming beneath him and whimpering against Dean’s mouth.
“Your cock is leaking so much,” Dean noted, pushing Cas’s legs apart to look at the young man’s red and angry looking cockhead.
“He broke my heart,” Cas said, turning back to look at Sam. “He left me after I’d shown him the acceptance letter. He wrote,
He slumped back onto their bed, moaning softly as he came down from his high. Dean kissed over his face and neck tenderly, waiting until he knew Castiel was finished coming. And once Castiel sighed deeply, he knew Castiel was alright to continue.
“Your breasts will grow, although only slightly. A male omega’s means of making and storing milk, in the case you ever have pups, is an internal function. It is not akin to the way female omegas and betas store and make milk,” Jess said, “and that is because your breasts are inside your chest, and if you ever do have pups and begin to produce breast milk, you will need to find a way to expel it as soon as possible otherwise it would grow to be very uncomfortable and painful and could cause difficulty breathing due to your breasts and where they are positioned internally.” Jess said.
The heat from Alastair’s body between Castiel’s legs went away, and Castiel figured that meant the other alpha had won the fight over him. He readied himself as much as he could for what was about to happen, but all he felt was his pants and underwear pulled back up and buttoned. Someone began talking to him, but Castiel couldn’t understand what was being said. He felt an arm slip under his back and another slip under his knees. A small whimper escaped his lips as he was lifted up and into someone’s arms.
“Will do, Captain,” Charlie saluted. She grabbed the bandages from the counter and placed one over Dean’s neck before patting him on the shoulder and walking out to give Kevin his task.
“Yes.” Castiel nodded. He cupped Dean’s face and leaned down to rest his forehead against Dean’s. “You are my true mate,” he said softly, “and I don’t want anyone but you.”
“I never should have believed Jo,” Rachel said. “She’s always been… It doesn’t matter. I moved to California a year after you left because I thought that’s where you were.”
“Your Majesty, these stories my subjects claim to be true are not. They have made them up. There is no maltreatment of the lower destinations on my lands.”
“Okay, so, meet me outside the back entrance to the auditorium tomorrow at eight in the morning and we’ll set up together before the presentation,” Barnes said, handing Castiel a pink slip to give to his teacher. Castiel thanked her and was on his way.
used to isolate yourself from everyone and everything. Even when we were young. Especially when we were young.”
“Turn into the alley on the left up here,” Cas instructed, lifting his head up only slightly to see where they were. “It goes along the outskirts of town and leads out to the woods.”
Castiel would have been happy to spend the whole day in Jess and Gilda’s company, but a knock sounded on the door and Gilda got up to get it.
“You don’t understand family, Cas,” Rachel said, and huffed out another dry laugh. “You don’t even understand what it means to be in a relationship.”
“These rings will now seal the vows of this marriage and will symbolize the purity and endlessness of their love,” Bobby announced, “By the power vested in me by the King, the land, and the cosmos, I now pronounce you, Dean and Castiel Winchester, true mates and King and Queen of the great land of Winchester. You may kiss to seal the bond!”
The next thing Castiel knew, his body was being lifted up, what felt like miles, from his face-planted position in his pillow. He felt an involuntary whine escape from his throat before he was being lowered back down. He sighed as the coolness of the new pillow soothed his burning skin. And then... As he inhaled, the most amazing thing he’d ever smelled overtook his senses and he couldn’t stop the pleased little noises he made as he tried to burrow deeper into the pillow.
“You keep oil in your desk?” Cas asked, throwing his head back when he felt Dean push a finger past his rim.
“Please?” Cas asked, gripping onto Dean’s hands while they made love. “Please stay; just one more week.” Cas ended his words with a gasp as Dean thrust into him.
Benny and Gilda were already in a small boat and Cas kept silent as Sam situated him next to Benny. “Let’s get on!” Sam yelled. Jo and Ash pocketed what goods they wanted and then made their way over towards the other few boats.
“Dean,” Castiel said, motioning for him to come in and take a seat at his desk. “I did really good tonight, didn’t I?”
Just a quick little note: this chapter may read like the characters are acting out of character, but just hang in there. It’ll be explained.
“Don't mention it,” Charlie said, “Turn around though. Benny made something special for your birthday.”
“Gabriel,” Michael said, curt as always. “It was nice of you to come visit us so late in our stay in the kingdom.”
“Cas, the world is going to end in ten days, and I don’t know how or why it ends.” Meg shook her head like she was ashamed. “All I know is that we need to stop it.”
However, he also knew that not everyone worked the way he did, and he didn’t want to make it seem as though sex was all he cared about. He’d brought the conversation up with Cas one day when he was having doubts, and it seemed like it was the first time Cas had ever even considered that thought. Cas just said that he never thought of them having sex as just sex. Each time they were together he’d always thought of it as…well, as an act of love and closeness between them. Dean agreed; very much so. He’d never thought of his time with Cas as just sex. But sometimes...sometimes he needed a reminder that Cas felt the same way.
“Are you asking if he’s been looking at you without his normal completely smitten lovey-dovey gaze? If so, yes,” Charlie answered. “He seems like he could be upset with you, but I don’t know what it’d be about.”
“Hey, baby,” she said, and Castiel rushed over to her, wrapping his arms around her in a crushing hug.
“Stop it,” Cas hissed to himself, shaking his head to force the all around feeling of nothingness away. He closed his eyes, making himself think good thoughts about Dean, Gilda, Charlie, Sam, Benny, Lisa and Ben—anyone from the Impala. That was one cure he had found worked when this happened. Most of the time it worked, too.
“Stop saying my name like that,” Cas snapped as Ava dragged him out of his room, letting him grab his trench coat, and heading down the stairs. Ava laughed quietly.
Then, like he could smell the content and happiness from miles away, King John came and tried to ruin it.
“Yours was the scent that was on that quilt and pillow?” He asked, “You were the one at the door who gave them to Ellen?”
“Do you know what this does?” He asked. It was a piece of metal with a two pronged fork at each end. “See, what we do is,” Dean paused to unclasped the fork from the collar to wrap the leather around Sandover’s throat. “We put this around your neck, and then we attach the fork, and if you lower your head, you die. It’ll impale your chest or throat.”
Amara was quick to react to that and straddled his middle, raining down hits and scratches wherever she could. After another hit below his eye, Castiel yelled and shoved Amara off of him. He rolled over to get on top of her, but she jumped up, kicked his side and knocked the air out of his lungs.
“Will you untie me so I can touch you, now?” he asked. His breathing hiccuped as Dean’s pupils dilated and lust flashed through his eyes.
“Right,” Michael said, he stepped aside and let Cas pass to get into bed. “Well, I’ve come to tell you that the search for Ava has ended. I’ve had messages sent to all the neighboring towns that if she’s seen she’s a wanted woman.”
“Cas…” Dean breathed out, looking at Cas with wide eyes. He cupped Cas’s face and kissed his forehead. “I’m not going to stop loving you.”
Naturally there were still some inconsistencies in the husband's testimony, but they didn't outweigh the evidence that proved him innocent.
Cas tightened his hands in Dean’s hair and pushed his chest into the pirate’s hands. “Dean,” he squeaked, letting the older man know that he was close. His hands were tugging roughly at his hair and his hips were starting to thrust into Dean’s mouth at a uncoordinated pace. Dean closed his eyes and removed his hands from Cas’s shirt, continuing at his pleasant pace until Cas was doubling over and holding Dean’s head down. He cried out loudly as he came, "Dean!" His hips stuttered to a stop before he breathed deeply and laid back on Dean’s desk, removing his hands from Dean’s hair and letting them fall down next to his head.
Dean looked into Benny’s eyes and nodded. He picked up his blades and sheathed then in his belt. “Let’s go,” He said and exited his cabin. Benny followed closely, watching as with each step Dean transformed into the tactical and formidable Captain he knew Dean to be. “When we get onto the ground we need to be fast.”
“But I’m cold and you’re warm,” Cas protested. Dean batted his hands away and stood up, pulling the articles of clothing with him to rest on Cas’s hips.
Dean laughed, “I don’t know,” he said huskily, nipping harshly at the spot where Cas’s jaw started. Cas arched his back into Dean and whined. “I think I’m gonna tease you. Teach you a little lesson?”
Castiel was sorry for losing control. She’d tried to teach him better than that, but Castiel hadn’t been able to learn from her. He wasn’t able to keep himself in check when Dean was being threatened. Castiel was sorry for failing his mother and disappointing her.
“I think an actual introduction would be good,” he said, sliding his arms around Dean’s middle as the alpha curled his arm around his hips. “This is my mate, Dean.”
“I know sometimes you don't think you're a good person or that you're not enough for me… But Dean, you are enough. You’re so much more than enough.” Cas came around to face Dean again. He undid the string keeping Dean’s trousers up and helped Dean to step out of them. But he didn't stand up, and instead he sat on his knees, running his hands over Dean’s legs and closing his eyes. “I know you think these scars you have…” Cas started, feeling his heart clench again at all the variations of skin he could feel on Dean’s legs. “...make up who you are, and that who you are is an ugly and unlovable person. But that's
Gabe laughed loudly and in an overly fake way. “Great idea, Rach, let's do that,” he took a swig of whatever cocktail he’d made. “Yeah, refreshing. And now that I’ve had time to think about it, I say no. Who’s with me?”
Dean smirked and pulled off, bringing one of his hands down to glide over Cas’s spit-slicked length. “Do what?” he asked, smirking when Cas had to fight for breath.
Castiel felt his face flush and he gave Dean a small smile as he moved inside. He stood off to the side and looked around, taking in all the different things he saw. There were several desks in the middle of the room, and cabinets and dressers against the walls, while lamps and other antiques were scattered over any surface available in quite a pleasant way. The store was cluttered, but not chaotically.
“Sh, baby, I got you,” Dean whispered. He lifted his head from Cas’s neck, “I got you.” Cas whimpered loudly and screwed his eyes shut. Dean smiled and jerked his hips forward, making Cas cry out loudly and snap his eyes open to look into Dean’s. “I got you,” he repeated, making Cas gasp for breath as he fucked into him again.
After Castiel was completely dressed and had his hair done, the ceremony was only a very short while away. But, as Meg said before sneaking out to get some pastries and tea, as long as they weren’t needed for the ceremony, they needed time to do as they pleased.
Dean inhaled shakily as he rested his forehead against Cas’s again. “Yeah,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “I love you, Cas. I love you so much.”
Plus, my writing isn't... Great. It's very underdeveloped. I've come so far since I began this fic, and whenever I sit down to continue writing, I fall back into the headspace I had when I first started this fic. It's a dangerous place to be because you get more dialogue than description when more description would be better. Not only that, but this fic is also all over the place. I've put in useless scenes that don't advance or help the plot and it's just... Wow. Not great. (And all the historical inaccuracies???? Oh man, I want to slap myself. Some of them were intended because I didn’t want to have to write  about the realities of this time period, but still. Not good.)
Dean moaned quietly, running a hand through his hair and moving his other hand faster over his manhood. He thought of the time he’d made Cas come four times back to back just by whispering dirty things into his ear and massaging his fingers against Cas’s prostate. That boy was honest to Gods the single most sensitive person he’d ever met. It was unreal how sensitive Cas was. Dean knew a lot about sex. He knew where humans held pleasure spots and how responsive each spot could be, but Cas was showing him new extremes. And Dean
Castiel could hear the thunder and see the lighting. It roared outside in time with the rise and fall inside Castiel. Every rush he felt, thunder cracked, and when he dropped the lighting lit up the room. Usually, rainy weather put Castiel on edge. He’d never liked the loud booms and sudden flashes; but when he was the one causing it? That was a different story.
In the year since Castiel had accepted Dean’s proposal of courting, he’d been the happiest he had ever been. He spent a lot of time with Dean, and the more time he spent with him, the more Castiel fell for him. Not only did Dean show him all the wonders of the world, but Dean taught him so much, too. They had weekly sessions where Dean would help him to understand the politics of being Queen and what was expected of him when he did take the throne. Dean never once made Castiel feel stupid for a question he had, and he didn’t make Castiel feel less than for not knowing something.
“Well, I’m here now,” Dean answered, smiling as Ben nodded and rested his small head in Dean’s neck. “I’ll protect you.”
“I’m so close, Dean,” Cas mewled, rolling his body into Dean frantically. Dean huffed and moved his head from Cas’s shoulder to his chest, taking one of his nipples into his mouth and swirling his tongue around the nub as he sucked lightly on it. “Gods, Dean!” Cas cried out, clamping down on Dean as he felt his orgasm approaching fast.
at night. You can’t hold yourself to a higher standard than everyone else. Not in a situation like this. You’re just one man.” Jo jabbed Dean’s chest.
A ripping sound followed soon after Dean’s words and Castiel saw Dean holding the belt he’d been wearing. “Worth it,” he said.
“Father, no!” Cas panicked, throwing his covers off and shooting over to stop his father from rustling around in his things. Michael looked at him with a curious look and an open mouth. “I-I mean, it’s not over there. It’s in my dresser by the window.”
When Castiel finally took a pause and started fidgeting, Gadreel got up and got Castiel a glass of water. He still didn’t say anything as he handed it to Castiel, only let Castiel take it and process for a minute or two.
fault, guys,” Jo spoke up, and her voice cut through the air like the knives she threw. “I was the meanest one out of all of us. I thought that if I showed dad how much like him I could be, he’d love me more. He’d think of me as Number One even if I wasn’t named it. I’m… I’m
“Well, then he couldn’t have had someone send a message to me or something?” Cas asked. “He couldn’t have had Kevin or Ash o-or Chuck or
“I-it hurts. I’m not even ten feet away from you, but it hurts. I can feel the distance between us and I can’t—Cas, I can’t not want to be close to you,” Dean said. “I can’t stay away from you. You’re my true mate.”
“Before I pronounce you mates, you must place your rings upon each other’s fingers.” Bobby summoned the ring bearers, Krissy and Ben. The two of them came over, smiling up at Dean and Castiel as they each handed a ring to one of them. “Gramercy,” Bobby said, “Castiel, take Dean’s hand and repeat after me…” Bobby recited the announcement Castiel was to say as he took Dean’s hand.
Had they’d kidnapped him such a public display to make a point? Had Dean ordered this? If so, why? What had he done to deserve such cruelty from the man he gave his everything to? Or, were they trying to tie up loose ends? he did, after all, know more about Dean and how he operated than anyone on this planet. Was—
Meg laughed under her breath. “It sure is nice to see you haven’t changed either, Jo,” she said, and then followed after Rachel in leaving.
There were preparations to be made for the entire lot of new subjects. And more to be made for any others who wished to come. It would be hard work to figure out accommodations for the sheer amount of people, but they found that with each other by their side? It really wasn’t so daunting.
treated him as worthless! It made it so Castiel could only see red. He wanted to kill them. There was nothing else he could think about but making them pay for what they’d done to him…
Castiel shook himself, and looked around the room, wrapping his arms around his middle for comfort. Everything looked rather new and unused. There was a fireplace on the wall directly opposite the door, and two windows on each side of the stone to let natural light in. A small area to sit during the cold seasons, Castiel guessed, was in front of the fireplace and on the to the left, on the west wall, was a large wardrobe. And lastly, to the right, there was a four poster bed with drapes to ensure privacy. It was the largest bed Castiel had ever seen, and certainly comfortable looking with all the pillows and blankets, but Castiel would not be won over by a bed. Castiel knew what kind of man the King was raised by, and therefore knew how King Dean would think of omegas. Castiel was not one of the teen omegas from the kitchen either, so easily won over by just looks.
When he reached Dean’s body, Castiel dropped to his knees and used whatever strength he had left to push Dean onto his back. He sat down on the floor and pulled Dean into his lap, cupping the alphas face with a shaking hand.
So, Cas came to the conclusion that no, Dean was not dead. He couldn’t be. And he wouldn’t die. Not out at sea and certainly not without Cas. He felt it in his bones that Dean was still alive. But there was always a doubt that maybe what he was taking for truth was just Cas wanting it to be truth so bad, he was tricking himself.
Castiel mumbled something from under Dean’s hand and Dean felt him moving his arms. He looked down to see Castiel spreading his hands out as best he could, nodding at Sam. Dean could see the mental smirk Castiel had.
“Absolutely not,” Dean said, a tone of finality in his words. “Cas, there’s you. And there’s me. And then there’s you and me. I don’t want you and me to overshadow
Castiel wasn’t sure how long he was frozen for, but then the man laughed, and Castiel stopped breathing.
“Castiel,” Alfie said suddenly, pulling Castiel to face him, “This is something else. True mates are rare. Benny and I met by sheer chance, we were never supposed to even be in the same parts of the castle. If Dean is your true mate—”
Dean smiled and dropped everything to the ground. “Let’s do it,” he said and began undressing. Back on the boat they had both decided they wouldn’t need any swim clothes. Cas blushed, only a little, and did the same. He took Dean's hand in his when they were both undressed and let Dean lead him to the waters edge. Slowly edging himself in, Cas found it to be the perfect temperature.
“How can you be sure?” Cas said. “Emotions are fickle and they can change in a day. You could wake up tomorrow and I could say something and then, bam, you hate me. Or two years from now we could start drifting apart and then one day… Bam,” Cas looked away, his eyes welling up with yet even more tears. “You don’t love me anymore and all those quirks that you used to love about me you now hate them and they drive you insane. How can you be so sure that you’re not going to stop loving me?” Dean didn’t even hesitate to respond.
“Gonna take that as you forgive me,” Dean said, laughing as Castiel rolled his eyes and pushed at his head to get him to move down.
“What?” Castiel knew his voice was a few octaves higher than normal, but as Dean moved off the bed and unbuttoned his jeans, Castiel found that he didn’t care to be embarrassed because his focus was on Dean’s hands.
event! Stars are born when true mates meet. And when you look into their eyes, everything changes. You see a glimpse of their past, their present, and you see your future together with them. The deepest pit in your soul is filled, and you know that as long as they are alive... You will never be alone again.”
“There’s so many people,” Lisa said, a wonder-like quality to her words. “There’s never been this many people here on Thanksgiving.”
This couldn’t be happening. This wasn’t right. Castiel should have been able to feel Dean, should have been able to see his soul.
“Feel good?” Dean asked, a laugh in his voice as he started fucking Cas deep and slow. Cas nodded his head enthusiastically, tugging at Dean’s hair.
“I love you!” Cas cried, saying the words each time Dean thrust into him. The pirate responding with desperate kisses against his neck and whispered
Dean was smiling when he saw them and immediately picked Cas up and spun him in his arms, kissing him deeply.
“Great.” Rachel stood up as Castiel did and the two of them followed Benny out to the courtyard where everyone was waiting already.
Dean was only eight when it happened. His father sold him to a royal looking for someone to have around for whenever he needed to…’blow off some steam’.
Dean walked slowly inside, a deep, thoughtful look on his face. He took a seat on the edge of one of the couches in the living room, and looked at his feet. Castiel closed the door quietly. He didn’t want to jolt Dean from whatever thought he was having because it seemed important. Castiel could tell.
“Now we’re getting somewhere,” Dean said, moving down to brush his lips against Castiel’s. He relished the little gasp the omega gave, but before he could do anything about it, Castiel was surging up to kiss him. And fuck, if it didn’t take the wind out of Dean’s lungs. He’d kissed and been kissed by some great kissers and attractive people, but fuck. Kissing Castiel immediately took first place because he was so enthusiastic about it.
“Fine,” he said, and the way Dean’s face lit up almost made him smile back. “B-but you have to keep your distance.”
It was pushed open to reveal an absolutely stunning dark haired omega that made nearly all of the students’ jaws drop.
still interested, I think you’re ready, too,” he said, tugging on Dean’s cock just enough to get his point across.
“Me neither,” he said, running his hands through Dean’s hair. “But we have the rest of our lives together,” he continued in a whisper. Dean smiled at him, groaning lowly a second later as he thrust into Cas. Cas gasped at the spark that ran through him and rolled his body down to meet Dean’s next thrust.
“Yes.” Dean said. Castiel shook his head, because he couldn’t—he wouldn’t lose. “I know you won’t, Cas, I mean I know you and I know why you go in there. I don’t want you to throw that fight.”
“Good,” Cas said with finality. “‘Cause honestly you didn't have much of a choice.” He ended his sentence with a yawn before turning on his side and snuggling into Dean.
“Cas, look, before we get any further into things, I need to warn you,” Dean began, “I really don’t want to make you unhappy, but speaking of Amara…”
Castiel reached out and grabbed Dean’s wrist, stopping them both in their tracks as something electric rushed through both of them at the contact.
Jo nodded her head and came over to stand next to Lisa. “You betcha. He cries easily, he’s needy, he’s constantly whining, and if he doesn’t get what he wants he’ll throw a fit, too.”
Castiel nodded, because he could relate to that. He wanted to be a writer and writing little stories in the moonlight was how he escaped when he was younger. “I know what you mean,” he said, “Wanting a way to escape. When I was younger,  I would write those typical short stories about an omega prince saved by the dashing alpha prince from the evil queen who locked him in a tower, or the charming thief who freed the omega from a curse.”
“Yes,” Cas sighed, letting Dean unwrap his legs from the man's waist so he could clean them both up.
Castiel smiled, looking down at his feet as he worked up the courage to speak again. “Thank you, Dean.”
“Please,” Castiel said, pulling away to look into his mother’s eyes. “I’m so confused about everything because I—”
Dean snarled as Castiel’s heat spasmed uncontrollably around his cock. Castiel clawed at Dean’s back, crying out every thrust because Dean’s cock felt so good inside him and Dean knew exactly how to fuck him. He could feel his pleasure heightening, and when the beginnings of Dean’s knot started tugging at his rim, Castiel came again, squeezing around Dean unbelievably tight.
“Alfie is down below. He’s with Dean at the moment, being shown the ropes and familiarizing himself with everything,” Sam said, frowning as Cas didn’t respond. He let out an anxious breath as he pushed into Dean’s cabin. “Please hear him out. It’s not his fault that he left and was gone for so long.” He plopped Cas down on the bed and began untying the ropes around his wrists first.
“Sam, you take care of things while I’m taking Cas back, get the swabs to work,” Dean said, “Charlie, Ash, Benny, you’re coming with me to better keep Cas’s identity anonymous. I take it you all know who his father is?” Everyone nodded. “Who else knows?”
“I don’t know if Dean has told you about him and I…” Benny started, obviously not sure how to approach this subject. Benny opened his mouth to continue, but Cas cut him off.
“So… Michael…” she started, “Why, again, were you not able to meet with us all those years ago when we first reached out to you about a marriage proposal?”
Castiel nodded like he understood the urge and Dean almost wanted to question it, but Castiel stepped forward hesitantly and Dean got a whiff of his scent. If Dean didn’t know better—or hope Castiel hadn’t, at least, because foreplay was one of his most favorite parts of having sex—he thought maybe Castiel had already had a session of… Self love.
!” Sandover said, spitting his words into Dean’s face. Dean smiled as he wiped the saliva from his face, letting out a fake laugh.
“Come,” he commanded, watching in awe when a moment later Cas’s mouth fell open and his back arched into Dean’s chest. A high pitched moan tore itself out of his throat and Cas came. Dean followed him soon after placing sloppy kisses over Cas’s face until they were able to talk.
Castiel tried to be mad, tried to be even a little miffed at Gadreel for taking away from the point he was trying to make, but he wasn’t. Honestly, he knew what Gadreel was doing, and he was thankful for the fact he had a friend who could distract him from the stupidity of people sometimes.
Dean expected Cas to scream or something; in no way was he prepared for what really happened: Cas’s head flew back with his mouth open and eye squeezed shut as his hands flew back to Dean’s thighs and gripped Dean almost painfully. He drew in a stuttering breath before raising himself up again repeated his motions, screaming this time. Dean guessed Cas had angled himself so his prostate was being hit each time he sunk down.
“But they’re touching him,” Cas said, his voice low and upset. “They’re touching what isn’t theirs.”
Cas was still smiling as he swallowed all of Dean’s release and as he pulled off, stroking Dean’s length gingerly and coaxing him down from his high.
“Castiel,” Michael greeted as the carriage door opened and he got in. “I have a meeting to go to at six tonight, so I will not be home for dinner.”
“Let’s go to your room,” Cas said, taking Dean’s hand in his and pulling the man with him as he walked into the cabin’s hallway. “I have some things I want to say to you.”
One infraction that stood out to Cas was the time of which the husband said he got home. It didn't line up with the time in which it would've taken him to get home from the whorehouse. He said he left at around eleven fifteen, and his house was a twenty minute walk from the brothel. The husband said he got home at eleven forty, but he also said he took a carriage home; meaning he should have gotten home much faster.
“You’re human. And you make mistakes,” Jo said softly. She hugged Dean tightly. “But, those mistakes are not
“Shit Cas,” Dean groaned, tilting his head up to kiss Cas desperately. Cas kissed back for a brief moment before he had to pull away to breathe. Dean kissed down to Cas’s neck, sucking bruises over his skin.
“Put your hands behind your head,” Dean said, using his Captain voice again. Cas locked his fingers together behind his head and looked to Dean for more instruction. Dean raked his eyes up and down Cas’s body hungrily before issuing another command. “Fuck yourself on my cock." Cas whimpered and raised himself up an inch or so. Any more and he wouldn't be able to handle it. "Talk to me, tell me how it feels."
Dean shook his head and wrapped Cas up in his arms, clinging to him like his life depended on it. “And, Cas? No,” he said, “I haven’t stopped loving you. I could never. I love you, Cas, I love you so fucking much. I missed you every day. I hated leaving you, but I couldn’t risk you getting hurt or worse.”
