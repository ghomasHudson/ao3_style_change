Their familiar staying as a small, fluffy rabbit for several days was a dead giveaway about their mindset, and it made Castiel’s heart ache.
“Uh-huh,” the man mumbled, fingers pulling back. Then something soft and warm and blunt pressed against Dean’s hole and he
He buys the essentials. He has no skill in the kitchen, nor desire to learn. It all tastes like dust to him.
His body shaking body and his head rolling back, body trembling on his fingers, he was beautiful to see, lost in his bliss, that Cas couldn’t wipe his emotions off his face before Dean came down from his pleasure.
“Dean? Are you alright?” The voice, vaguely familiar, was rumbling, like a growl. Dean bristled, baring his teeth and skittering his back legs (
Her hand came up to his chin, long acrylics digging into his skin and leaving what he knew was going to be little red crescents, and he felt himself harden even further at the thought. She yanked his chin so that his eyes met hers, and he felt like he was melting under her gaze.
Finally cracking a smile, they left to go to the bathroom to brush their teeth, and once they had finished, they stopped for a moment, their own face surprising them for a moment.
Cas shuffled slightly behind him, seat scraping lightly against the floor. “I got bacon from the store while we were out. Feel free to enjoy yourself.”
Dean’s head rolled back upwards, and his eyes locked with Cas’s, eyes hazy and molten. He licked his lips slowly and deliberately, jaw dropping open into a silent moan as his eyes slid shut, breaths puffing out in little huffs. His hips were moving faster, more jerky and uncontrolled, and his eyes fluttering open at particularly rough downthrusts to expose his eyes unfocused and rolling back. As if he had lost the ability to do anything but chase his own climax.
“Oh, nothing that could help you right now. Fingers itching, aye? I haven’t done nothing wrong.” She shuts Dean down and starts writing down the list.
“Bad neighborhood, shaky electricity, the place is pretty much empty ‘cept for us, agent Eppes. Would you like to see what we have put together on the investigation? Like Steve mentioned, we are largely leaning towards demons, but something’s slightly off, there’s no sulphur smell for instance and there is no proof of the ladies being possessed.” Benny stoops to the same level that Steve started with – intimidate with the crazy, works almost all the time.
“We’ll see about that,” Don is not amused, “Winchester, we have work to do,” he exits without a nod or a goodbye. Not convinced, huh?
“Yep, said he seemed to be too observant for just a librarian,” Colby shrugs his shoulders, “not that that should limit people.”
“And don’t you forget we still have that game of cards waiting,” Missouri says while she shows the man out, “you don’t want to give me the impression you’re scared of my skills, now do you?”
For a second she hovers over Sam’s name, but it would only complicate matters, if she’d involve him in spying on his coworker. Nope. She waits five more minutes for Dean to answer and then peeks out of the door.
“You are quite well known in certain circles,” he tilts his head as if that explained everything, “there’s no need for the knife, I assure you I am no threat to you.”
“So, you’ve been working here long?” he sits himself on the armchair in the corner, whoever left it here.
“I’m confident we’ll find something on the killer,” Dean nods and means his words. “Were there any other irregularities? Before the assault I mean?”
who’s sister, Alicia Banes, happens to be working at the CalSci Library, specializes on witchcraft.”
“It’s more like someone else is thinking this way. There is this case and I fear the consequences of everything that’s happened might be deadly.”
so, maybe you noticed that i've deleted the Sam/Eileen tag. now, the reason for that is that i kinda started to like the idea of Sam/Nikki while writing this chapter. i don't know if i'm gonna go there or not, but i decided to leave it open for now. if anyone has a clear preference, you should tell me NOW. ( i love eileen as well, but i'd have to find a clever way to bring her into the story and right this instant i don't have it)
“I tell you what, you let me in that room with him and I won’t take over your investigation completely, you’ll still call most of the shots, how about that for a compromise?” he asks seriously, without any smiles this time.
“Kevin, was someone here asking about the case?” Don turns his investigative tone on, “dressed in a beige trenchcoat? Dark hair, blue eyes?”
Don smirks and fakes a laughter. “Very amusing, I can give you that. Hey, we both know you’re not under arrest, you can walk out of this room any time you want, I’m not holding you.”
“I’ve never seen anything like it,” the kid remarks. Course he hasn’t, the coroner Kevin Tran looks like he’s seventeen. When Dean made a remark about that, he received a deathglare and a venomous “try ten years older, we can’t all look like a fossil”. It was enough to shut him up and he did
i'm so sorry this chapter took so long. but you'll be rewarded for your patience with some familiar faces ;)
“Yeah, good to have you. Heard you’re a computer girl? You need some equipment? We’re quite high tech.”
Sam’s eyes sharpen and take on a dangerous shade: “Yes, I do know some of them. But I have studied the occult, it’s only natural I would know them. I don’t recognize them all though,” he frowns as if it’s something that is actually puzzling him.
“So, uh,” Dean is straightening himself, “my coworker should get here any minute now and,” is he nervous? “Well, she’s really a nice person, can be a bit overbearing, but, kind of a nerd, just, just don’t bite her head off, capiche?” he finishes.
Dean shifts nervously and slides a hand over his mouth: “I mean, naah, it’s, yeah, I don’t think that’s necessary, how about you, Don?”
“Of course,” Steve confirms and Benny sees that as a sign to collect everything they’ve put together and hand it over.
“Can’t we have any clues without his name popping up… You know what, maybe it’s good, we can still keep an eye on him. You haven’t really discussed the case with her, right?” it’s more like a statement than a question.
This breathtaking man should be his True Mate? Cas somehow couldn't believe it. Cas knew Dean had already noticed him. Slowly the Alpha turned to him and looked straight into his eyes. Suddenly Cas didn't know what to say anymore. How could you convince your roommate that you were meant to be together?
“This is the smell of an unmated Omega in heat. You should try to inhale as much as possible. In a few days, your rut should start. But after you inhaled we should move you to …. to a place which is more … um …soundproofed.”
„Fuck, Dean. I am not sure I will last. I wanted you for so long… I…“ Cas whined and it was clear that he was as overwhelmed as Dean was.
"That explains why your jacket is sooty. But, it doesn't explain why your so-called friends just left without you. " Ellen pushed and Dean had to admit she was right. Dean was pretty pissed about the fact that they just left him behind. But he wouldn’t admit it so he just shrugged his shoulders.
"Sorry Lisa, but I think it would be better if you'd stay at your apartment tonight," he explained.Lisa looked at him incredulously.
He just wanted to avoid Cas on the campus and pay as little attention as possible. Cas presence in their dorm alone drove him mad enough.
Shit! There was no way he would put on headphones now to blend out the sex noises. Dean was already too turned on. He knew it would be nearly impossible for him to look his best friend in the eye for the next days, but at the moment he didn't care. With shaky fingers, he freed his aching cock from his pyjama pants.
“Boy, if you think I'm gonna let you drive in this state, then you're so wrong. I have no desire to see your car curled up around the next tree. We can get the Impala later.”
"Cas, even if you're still registered as his emergency contact, he may not want to talk to you. I'm sure the car accident didn't change the facts for him. " Gently she touched his arm.
„Didn’t you recognize Deans reaction when we had our first breakfast together, his pained look? And now he is avoiding him as much as possible. Nearly every day he is at Charlie's. He even changed his English class. He loved English literature. Now he attends Englisch writing.“
Turned out Dean was lucky Cas didn't blame him that one of the pregnant cows calved. About half an hour later they realized the cow wouldn't make it without help. Somehow the calf was stuck. Cas had no choice but to call for the vet. They spent the whole day more or less helping the animal. The hay harvest was out of the question.  At least for this day. They only managed to take care of the rest of the animals and clean the stables.
Dean didn't know what to think. He was an Alpha! After all these years he was really an Alpha. He would finally present. That's all he ever wanted. He wanted to be Cas’ Alpha.  Oh god! It just wasn't fair. If everything had gone the way nature intended, he and Cas would have been bonded long ago. But now it was too late. Cas had found his true mate and there was no place for Dean. Finally, his biggest dream came true and it didn’t matter anymore! He lost Cas forever. So he lost everything.
"It can't be so difficult to find a new roommate. Your apartment is next to the college campus. It must be easy to find someone new, " she countered.
Then he pushed the other Alpha into the living room to the couch. There wouldn't have been enough time to go upstairs to the bedroom. Cas wanted Balthazar right away, without having time to think. Even before they arrived at the couch, they were both naked and Cas had trouble not coming before they even got started.
"Damn it, Meg. You can't just decide things like that for me. Dean is my best friend. I don't want anything to change in our relationship. I'm gonna lose him. Can't you see that?" Cas cried desperately.
He was begging now, "Fuck, please, Dean, just fuck me already, I need you… need your cock inside of me, please, please…”
“Shhht. I am here and I won’t leave you.” The Omega reassured him and kissed the tips of his fingers.
And not only would it be embarrassing to drift into a heat in a foreign house, he wouldn't be very useful to Sam either. For the split of a second, he also considered buying a fake knot for himself. Just in case. Cause he was sure he wouldn’t get Dean's help in a case like this. The Alpha had made it very clear that he didn't want an Omega. Cas was sure that would include his true mate. He even suspected that this would relate to his true mate in particular.
"Yes, we’ve been smoking and hiding behind the small building. Alist..., one of my friends, threw away the match and the dry grass caught fire. The others ran straight to the car and drove away. I tried to put out the fire, but it had already started to grow too uncontrollable. . ."
Sam left and Dean tried to wake up Cas. Like always it wasn’t easy. It was adorable how grumpy the Omega was at first, but the Coffee and the Donuts lightened up his mood immediately.
“What…? Cas, you can’t know he is in Santa Cruz. This is insane. Cas, please look at me. I googled it. There are several phases after a break-up. At first, you are desperate for answers, afterwards, you are in denial, then there are bargaining, relapse, anger and finally acceptance. You are in each of this phases except the last one.”
With a deep sigh, Cas rose from his chair. The nurse was right. There was nothing he could do until Sam got here. The thought of a shower and a hot meal was also very tempting.
"The animals will survive when they get their food half an hour later today. But I won't survive if I don't feel you naked above me right now. The last few nights without you have been hell," Cas replied with a rough voice.
Cas didn't understand what Dean was getting at. That was exactly what he had done. He had bitten Dean.
He managed to turn around a bit and so he could take a look at the one who held him like an octopus. It was none other than Dean! Damn it! How did Dean get into his bed and why the hell were Cas scent glands no longer covered with the blockers? At that moment he felt Dean's tongue. In his sleep, he licked Cas glands. Oh Jesus fucking Christ! Dean must have licked off the blockers. Dean squeezed even closer and pressed himself against the back of the Omega. Cas could now clearly feel Dean’s hard cock. Oh, God, how would he ever get away from this? Dean's licking slowly turned into sucking and Cas could do nothing against the rising arousal that was spreading in him. Dean started rubbing his lower body against Cas's ass.
”God, Dean. You don’t know what you are doing to me,“ Cas whispered. His eyes were nearly black now.
“I am so so sorry, Dean. We have to go back. There is a little timeframe to undo a full Omega rejection state, so we…”
Dean would have liked to hear what the rest of the conversation, but Charlie pulled him away relentlessly.
"Why not? It would just remind me my whole life that my soulmate doesn’t want me. I wonder why he didn't remove it a long time ago. "
Cas’ hands were gripping his hips hard, keeping him in place as he pounded into him, pushing them both closer to the edge with each thrust.
How did he feel? The numbness in his true mate's soul still hurt, but somehow he felt a bit better. Maybe it was because he had some rest.
After Sam had something to drink and to eat, they returned to Dean's room and ate the sandwiches while the watched some more Prison Break. The afternoon passed very quickly between watching Netflix and cuddling with Dean. So Cas was almost surprised when John called them for dinner, he had ordered pizza for everyone. And for the first time since Cas arrived at the Winchesters' house, they were eating together because Dean's father didn't have to work and Sam's heat had passed.
The only problem was that his inner alpha wasn't on board with the whole idea. He was able to smell Cas scent anywhere in their dorm, despite the scent blockers.
"I'm sorry, Cas, but Dr Crowley has established a strict no-omega rule. Apparently, it would be bad for Dean’s hormonal level to be confronted with an unmated omega right away. "
"Would you please stop this nonsense? Do you really think you had the slightest chance of raping me? Dean, I'm one of the few male Omegas in this country. The first thing my parents taught me when I presented was self-defense and believe me I am very well able to defend myself. You didn't do anything I didn't want you to and when I said stop, you stopped right away. So everything is fine! But this isn't about me or you. This is about your brother. He is the seventh male Omega in the United States.  I think we're only 35 worldwide. You should take me with you. Your father did the right thing not to let the Male Omega Care organization into your home, but your brother needs support now. He wouldn't let you or your father in his room, believe me. "
Cas knew he should have been embarrassed because his voice sounded so incredibly needy, but he didn’t care.
Dean grabbed him by the arm and pushed him towards the garage. There he opened the Impala and sat down on the driver's seat. Crowley sat down next to him.
I can't believe it's over! Thank you all so much. Your comments cheered me up all the time! It was amazing! <3   <3   <3
"Jesus, Charlie! What are you talking about? Of course, I didn't misunderstand him. What's there to misinterpret? The man is married!" Dean realized he got angry. He didn't want to feel guilty or have doubts.
Jo made herself comfortable on the couch and turned on the TV while Dean went upstairs with a cheeseburger, chips and a glass of orange juice. First, he knocked on Sam's door.
Afterwards, he was lying on top of Cas, his nose buried in the Omegas neck, smelling and licking at the scent glands. Cas fingers were drawing circles on Deans back. The Omega smelled so happy and Dean knew he was smelling happy and sated too. They didn’t talk very much while they were locked together. Of course, Dean was aware of the fact that they had to talk, but not now. He was so exhausted and tired and it was so comforting to just lay there in Cas’ arms. And so they fell asleep while they were still locked together.
Meg: I know and I will be grateful forever, Cas. But please remember that you promised me to tell me if it gets too much or if you meet your soulmate. We can easily get a divorce. I don’t want you to suffer because I want to be a part of the US Archeologie Team. You are my best friend and I don’t want you to get hurt!”
Oh,  God! Cas was so close. Dean couldn't control himself. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. The other Alpha must have always worn scentblockers. It was impossible, but Dean's brain was too occupied to think about it at the moment. The pouring rain must have washed away the blocker. Cas smelled like hot chocolate and fireplace and Dean wanted to soak in the smell. No Alpha should smell so incredibly tempting. Not for Dean, who was an Alpha himself. But damn it. Dean wanted to bury his nose in Castiel's neck and inhale as much of the amazing scent as possible.
"You really want to bet that you manage to seduce my little cousin? Dean-o, Dean-o. It will take a bad end with you. But okay. Of course, I’ll accept the bet. If you manage to seduce my cousin until Thanksgiving, you'll get fifty bucks. "
"Dean! Sometimes you’re really impossible. You can't seriously still doubt that you are true mates," Sam cried.
Why couldn't Dean look him in the eye? It was like he was ashamed. But why? There was no reason. Or maybe… Mabey Mary had told him about what happened to his tattoo and Dean felt sad for him. He was pitying him. Jesus! This was even worse. He had to get upstairs quickly.
The Alpha tried to go slow first, but Cas wanted him to go faster and harder. He wanted everything Dean was willing to give
“No, you won’t! Cas, I …I won’t tell anyone. Of course, it will affect my reputation, when I have to admit to Gabe, that I can’t seduce you, but I’ll get over it.”
"Listen, nobody thinks you had anything to do with the fires. I'm not even sure you were to blame for the fire in my shed. Honestly, I doubt it when I think about your family history, but even now you still won't betray the real culprits. Jody thinks that your friends were the ones to blame but because you stayed loyal to them, she thinks that if she investigated them you might help them," Cas explained.
Dean hadn't noticed the Alpha entering the hallway of the garage. As always, he was in a terribly good mood. But no one could blame him. Everybody knew he fell in love just a few weeks before Dean got here.
When they arrived there half an hour later, the party was already in full swing. Astonishingly many people cavorted in the large garden. Jody had the impression that the whole city was here. After all, many here had suffered because of Dick Roman. So Dean and Cas were their heroes because they were the reason the police were finally able to arrest him. Apart from that, everybody wanted to congratulate them. It wasn't every day that true mates found each other. The city desperately needed good news and this was definitely good news.
Dean let go of Cas cock and started to lick between his butt cheeks. He spread them with relish and drove his tongue around the rim of the hole. Oh, God, Cas tasted as amazing as he smelled. Hungry he pushed his tongue inside and licked away the sweet slick.
He hated when she was making a scene. Why did she always have to be so fucking jealous? And why the hell did she not see that it was her mistake?
"Of course, I know you two are Alphas. Like I said he is gay. He likes knots. You don't really have to. . . just keep him happy. It doesn’t matter how old he is. Maybe he will be … grateful if he thinks he has a chance. You know what I mean. Just let him see. . . what he might want to see. . . " Crowley suggested cautiously.
Charlie set down on the floor next to him and hugged him. She always had the feeling that her two friends were meant for each other. How cruel fate could be to separate them. It would take ages for Cas to get over Dean. At the moment she even doubted that could ever be the case.
"No, don't worry. I didn't say anything. Although it was really a dick move of you guys to just walk away without me, so I got caught. " Dean said.
„You should come with us. We don’t want to disappoint Dean Mr Handsome Winchester.“ Charlie giggled and places a kiss on his cheek, again the Omega didn’t know what she was talking about.
Wow! That was. . . surprisingly direct… and also odd. Dean's brother thought they were True Mates. That meant Dean must have talked about him. Did Dean think they were True Mates, too? Damn it! Then why was he avoiding him? Wasn't it every Alpha or Omega's dream to meet their True Mate? Was it because Castiel was a man? But somehow Cas knew that wasn't what caused Dean's behaviour. Everyone knew Dean slept with men and women. But they were always Betas or sometimes even Alphas. So it was much more because he was an Omega. Dean was clearly not interested in having a true mate. That had to be the reason. He didn't want to commit forever. He wanted to continue his easy life. Without limitation by a mate. Because if they were to bond, Dean wouldn't be interested in it anymore. He would just want him forever. And that's probably what the Alpha wanted to prevent. Castiel was sure of that.
“No, stop it. I don’t want to….” With all his force Cas pushed the Alpha away and jumped out of the bed to escape into the bathroom.
Was it weird that the other boy’s refusal turned him on even more? Of course, it was! But Dean couldn’t help it. The more his roommate resisted, the more Dean wanted him. He could still convince himself that this was only because of the bet with Gabe, but he knew the truth.
“Dean, Cas loves you. He loved you since the very first moment you two met. You can’t leave him. It will break his heart.”
Later, when they sat at dinner together, Cas got nervous again. How was he supposed to behave? Was that a one-time thing? Should he ask Dean to sleep in his bed? Or would that be totally inappropriate? Cas felt like a fourteen-year-old boy with a crush.
This was so hot. Dean was grinding faster and faster and his mouth was sucking the skin on Cas neck. He could feel Dean’s hot breath on his skin. Fuck! His own dick was achingly hard as well. It took all his willpower not to touch it. After all, he couldn’t just lie next to his roommate and masturbate.
Another whole month! If only Dean had known for sure that Cas was counting the days like he was. But right now, Dean feared that his soulmate didn‘t. Of course, Dean knew he had to blame no one but himself. If he hadn't had the tattoo removed, they would be able to prove the soulmate bond. Cas hadn't even complained about Dean's stupid action.
Dean reached for Cas's T-shirt and pulled him closer. Then Cas felt Dean's lips on his and it was so good to finally be allowed to kiss his soulmate. Wantonly he pushed Dean even closer to himself and opened his lips with a moan to let Dean in. Dean's tongue ravished his mouth hungrily until they were both gasping and panting.
Certainly, for the thousandth time in his life, Cas wondered why all Omega-shops in the US have to be pink. Okay, most Omegas were female, but still. Not that pink wasn't a pretty colour, Cas liked it. But it was a bit dull that all shops looked almost the same. However, he had to admit that they also had a certain recognition value. In every mall where Cas saw a light pink shop he immediately thought it was an Omega-shop.
"Yeah, she installed security cameras all over the farm. She hopes to catch the perpetrators in the act," Cas explained.
Without realizing it, Dean started to stroke Cas back. Somehow Cas fit perfectly into his arms. Almost like he was made especially for it. With every breath of Cas amazing scent, Dean was forgetting everything around him more and more. All that mattered was the Omega in his arms. With one hand he tried to draw Cas closer to him, while the other hand was now buried deep in the Omega’s hair. Perhaps he would have had the situation under control if his former roommate had behaved passively if he had not reacted to Dean's touches. But when he heard Cas moan quietly and the Omega started to suck at Dean's Scent glands, Deans self-control melted like snow in the sun.
"Yes, I was in Lawrence today. I was at the same tattoo shop where you were. I had no photo of the tattoo so I hoped the lady there would remember your tattoo. And thank God she did. She said she was wondering when I was gonna show up. "
"Could you please stop freaking out, Dean! Meg said that nothing serious had happened to Castiel. He only got a few scratches. Can we please continue celebrating now and ... "
"Yes, this is for you. I know how awful hospital coffee is. Think of it as a matting gift. " Sam grinned and handed the bag and the mugs to Dean.
Encouraged by the reaction of his soulmate, Cas mouth wandered deeper and sucked on the soft flesh of the younger’s tummy. Dean's legs opened by themselves. The sight was exhilarating. Dean was laying below him, his eyes closed, his cheeks red, his mouth slightly opened and swollen from their kisses, his dick was hard and leaked precum while little moans escaped his lovers' troat. Oh God! Dean was so beautiful like this! On the inside of Dean's right thigh, Cas discovered the Soulmate tattoo. Dean got a new one, too. Warmth spread in Cas's chest. He gently stroke his fingertips over the two white wings, then he kissed the tattoo. Dean's breath came intermittently.
“Only because you are fucking numb. Jesus Christ, Cas! Please! We need to try this. Do you really think I could become happy without trying to fix this? I need you!”
"Yes, I will, but first I have to remove off my Scentblockers. Otherwise, he won't let me in either. "
"Okay, Mr Winchester, let's get one thing straight. This is not some stupid prank. You're definitely not a Beta. You are an alpha who suppresses his second gender with the help of Relevium. My question as a doctor is for how long. "
Actually, he didn't feel like talking to Charlie at all. Still, he grabbed the phone from the nightstand.
Instead, he sucked at the warm skin. When Cas automatically tilted his head to give better access, Dean nearly lost it.
The Omega beneath him was arching his back at the same time when he also fell over the edge. His inner walls were clenching to milk even the last drop of Deans release. And it was so fucking hot!
“Yes, it was, Dean. More than that. It was mindblowing. I don't know what I did to deserve you, but I will be grateful forever. I love you, Dean Winchester. With everything I have. And I hope you never regret having accepted me as your soulmate after all.”
Cas couldn't hear the nurse answering. He was far too busy dragging Dean into his hospital bed and kissing him senseless.
"No! I don't want this! Now that we've finally found each other, I don't want to wait another four months. Dad, please!" Dean begged.
“No, there's no school tomorrow.” John was smiling at him. “I have to say that I am proud of you and Dean. I am aware that it wasn’t easy to follow my order during the last four months.”
Dean’s head fell back on the pillow in relieve. Thank God it wasn't that bad. He would soon be able to go back to work. There was no way he could afford to be absent right away. Benny, his boss was a good guy, but the man needed help in the garage and if Dean would drop out, he would have to find someone else.
Dean gasped into the other Alpha's mouth, nipping at his bottom lip. Cas' stubble was scraping against Dean’s skin and he was barely able to breathe - it felt so good. Why had he never considered this before now? He had always thought that he'd only go for the soft curves of female bodies, but shit was he wrong. Castiel's muscular chest pressing against him and his scratchy stubble were doing things to him that he never thought were possible.
He quickly slipped into his jeans and a T-shirt and went downstairs into the kitchen. He knew that a pie would be waiting for him there. Or at least he hoped so.
If he didn’t watch out, this would get out of hand and escalate quickly. But he wouldn’t give the other the satisfaction to be his number 3500 of seduced idiots.
“Sure. That’s the impression I had too when you were literally begging me to bite you. Fuck! I would have nearly done it!”
“Fuck the party, Cas. I have been waiting long enough. I want to be with you. I need you. Please don’t send me away tonight.” Dean begged.
Of course he knew that his disappearance would raise questions, but he would simply claim that the fact of having to find a new roommate had upset him. Even if Cas had not been hopelessly in love with Dean, the news would certainly have shocked him. So he had a right to just sneak off and be mad at Dean. So he tiptoed out of the house and drove away in his car.
I hope you are not too upset with me because of what happens in this chapter. But I promise I will make it up to you ^.^
Of course, this wasn't the first time the Alpha blew someone, but usually, he preferred to be on the other end. With Cas, however, it was something else. It was an incredible feeling to take the Omega apart like this, to know that he was moaning and shaking because of him.
„Yeah, that fits with my deductions. At first, he seemed more flirty but now he is only looking at you the whole time.“ Charlie said.
"I somehow sensed something was wrong and immediately called Jody. Therefore, thank God everything went quite fast. I don't even want to think about what would have happened if I had arrived just five minutes later... " a shiver ran through Dean's body.
"Don't be silly, Sam. As you can see, Cas is still asleep. So nothing indecent happens here. " Dean explained.
When Castiel looked at the sheet of paper the secretary had handed him, he couldn`t believe it. But there it was in black and white.
Cas didn't seem to have any problems with Dean not getting too close to him any more. On the contrary. He seemed happy. He made friends. Especially with a very pretty redheaded alpha girl. Dean tried not to be jealous. He really tried, but he failed.
"Jesus, this is disgusting. You are such a sap. If I had known the whole story would end like that, I never would have spilled the tea," she said shaking her head.
The poor secretary blushed even more. In another life, Dean wouldn’t have thrown this chance away. Lisa was beautiful, funny and clearly interested. But this was still his old life. Even though he had moved away from Lawrence for miles, this didn’t change the fact that for him there was only Cas. And this fact would perhaps never change.
Dean was glad they finally changed the subject. For the next hour, they were occupied to plan everything. The only problem was where they should get the beer but Charlie's mom helped them and agreed to buy it if they promised not to drink the harder stuff.
After all, he worked his sentence here while the others had a nice summer and Cas was more than sure that Dean's so-called friends were at least as much to blame for the fire in his shed than Dean.
Fucking hell! He really had knotted the boy! And Dean's knot did pop too. What the hell happened here? They were clearly not true mates, otherwise he would feel some inner connection to the boy; at least that's how the literature described a bond. But the only thing he felt at the moment, however, was confusion and arousal, since his knot had apparently not had enough.
“Yeah, he is. I can’t tell you the details because I promised him not to tell anybody but I know now he is a good guy. He had his reasons for marrying. And his reasons were very selfless. And he is still waiting for his Soulmate.” Mary tried to explain.
Dean tried to go slow first, but Cas wanted him to go faster and harder and Dean was so on board with that. Even if he knew he wouldn’t last.
"Fuck! Do you wanna kill me?" Cas whined breathlessly. Instinctively, he also squeezed his hand around Dean's knot. Dean's body reacted immediately and his back arched from the hay bales. Why did Dean have to be so damn beautiful? This wasn't fair at all, especially since he also smelled better than anything.
After the third beer, he felt a little better. Charlie had disappeared with Dorothee after a while and Cas was leaning against a wall with the fourth bottle of beer, watching the crowd. He tried not to look at Dean and the black-haired and failed. Of course, he failed. It was impossible for him not to look. Secretly Cas wondered that the two were still just talking. Her signals were clear and Dean wasn’t famous for taking it slow.
"Cas, for sure I won't leave you here alone if Dick Roman plans to destroy your entire existence and doesn't care if you get hurt by doing so. The idea of losing you in a fire too..."
He would stay at the Winchesters house until tomorrow or maybe one more day to help Sam. Thank God first heats never took long. Afterwards, he would ban Dean from his life completely. Hopefully, his own heat wouldn’t approach until then. Then he would most likely have to go to a hospital. That much was clear. True mate rejection heats were usually very bad.
Cas didn’t answer. He kissed his mate with passion and took their hard members in one hand to stroke them together. Through the bond, he felt how close Dean already was.
The sensation was driving him absolutely wild. Dean knew he wouldn’t last if Cas didn’t stop. He looked at the other man who was kneeling next to him on the bed, his face was flushed, his eyelids heavy, and his breaths came unevenly...
But at least Cas now knew that he didn't have to get his hopes up. Dean was straight and the mere thought that Cas had slept with a man seemed to repulse him.
In the three weeks since he left Lawrence, he had not managed to turn on his cell phone and call Charlie or Sam. He was way too scared that there might be news of Cas. He didn't know if he was ready to hear it yet. Maybe the Omega had found his true mate again in the meantime and was grateful that Dean had left on his own.
While he went inside the house he considered what Crowley had told him. So Castiel Novak was gay and quite young. Perhaps there really was an advantage to be gained from this. Even if Dean wasn’t interested in male Alphas at all, the rancher didn’t know that. Maybe Crowley's suggestion wasn't so stupid after all.
He didn't know if she had a seventh sense or something, but she immediately stared at his hand and saw that his soulmate tattoo was gone.
Meg:  “I am sure you are overreacting. Okay, this Anna may be pissed but can you blame her? She lost her Soulmate.  But why should Mrs Winchester react this way? It’s none of her business. And her son Clarence, he is a teenager! They change their minds every second. I am sure tonight at dinner everything will be all right. You’ll see. Trust me. And if not… You know you could tell them the truth, don’t you?“
He knew he would have to let go of Cas hand eventually to hold the fork but he made sure their thighs were bumping together.  It seemed nearly impossible not to touch Cas. But it was okay, he knew Cas wouldn’t care.
"Cas, stop it. You don't have to apologize. I don't want to know how many times you've heard me. I should apologize to you", Dean muttered.
Jesus fucking Christ! What The Actual Fuck? How could he be so stupid? Of course! They were both Alphas. Two Alphas, so two bites! It would have been so easy! All this time they were just too stupid to complete the bond?
The feeling of Cas' finger inside of him was strange but so good, and it became even better when Cas used his other hand to stroke his dick. Dean felt himself slowly relaxing as Cas pushed his finger in deeper and deeper. After a while, he started to thrust in and out. And when the other Alpha inserted a second finger and thrusted deeply, he must have touched Dean's prostate because immediately Dean's whole body was in flames.
“Thank you, Mrs Winchester, for listening to my sad story and for the water. Please don’t tell anybody. What I did is still not legal.”
Of course, Dean knew he couldn't stay at the groceries forever. He'd probably have to go home sometime. It was also important that he made some food for Sam as soon as possible. The fridge was almost empty because John didn't want to leave his Sammy alone.
Dean changed his position to get a better look at Cas. The movement squeezed Cas' knot and ...oh fucking hell. This felt so good.
"Yes, but Meg, my wife is in Europe right now. She is an archaeologist working at a site in Greece. "
The next morning started with bright sunshine and Dean couldn't imagine that it would rain in the afternoon. But he knew that weather changes could happen very quickly. In the morning they mucked out the stable and cared for the animals. The little calf was already running around in the small box, but his mother was still not doing very well. Cas, therefore, decided to feed it himself. Together they started to feed the animal with a feeding bottle. Dean was surprised Cas even owned something like this. It turned out that the poor little creature was very thirsty. Probably the mother was just too weak to produce milk. Thank God Cas had thought of feeding the poor calf.
“You can’t be serious. I don’t want to work on a farm for the whole summer. I can work at Bobby's garage and pay the money back. Novak’s farm is right in the middle of nowhere. I wouldn’t even be able to hang out with my friends during the summer.” he complained further.
It didn’t only hurt, Dean felt guilty as well. Guilty that he wasn’t able to be happy for the Omega. That he hated his true mate even if he never met him.
„It’s okay, Dean. You can relax. We decided to try this and so we should do everything that’s possible to make it work. So if the article says we should touch, we do.”
"I know this is terribly embarrassing for you. I still remember my first heat. My parents had called the Omega Health Care Service. I'll spare you the details. But that much is for sure, it was more than distressing!"
"Happy birthday. It's just a very small gift. Since you're reading Vonnegut, I thought you might be interested in Stanislav Lem." Cas shrugged his shoulders.
"I don't think so. Dick Roman wouldn't give a damn if you are here or not. If he wants to start a fire he would do it, with or without you," Cas replied.
"Winchester! You behave as if I had invaded your territory, but if you haven’t smelled it yet. Castiel is a beta. Alphas don’t fight for betas. "
One second they were arguing and Dean feared he might lose Cas and the next they were kissing. Dean stood up and grabbed Cas‘ T-shirt to pull him closer. Then he pressed their lips firmly together.
“Heya, you look like you’re living in your head at the moment?” Liz approaches him, “work or personal?”
when she’s holding literal fire,” Steve snaps the picture back and Benny almost laughs out loud at Dean’s confused face.
“Huh,” Dean doesn’t give a smile at that, “maybe.” It’s almost as if he seriously contemplates about that. “Can I see the bodies? They haven’t been returned to the families, right?”
“Oh, that’s the jewel-thief, Lugosi they called her. She was killed by the laser-eyes-guy, just a minor player.”
Bela. Another coincidence? Their victim’s name is also Bela. Bela Talbot. He checks other photos in the room., nothing else catches eye.
“Yeah, Charlie, everything under control, you go back to your math or your wonderful wife or whatever the else you should be doing instead of talking about hypothetical cases. Yeah, ok, bye,” Don ends the calls with his brother. He’d been observing the man during the conversation. No real signs of distress, except maybe the occasional hand scratching, no shifty eyes or overly confident look. Seems more like a calm and thoughtful person. Still, the hand-thing could be a give-away.
This time there is a visible reaction. It’s the second victim that does the trick, exactly as Don had anticipated. Sam Winchester clearly recognizes the dead lady on the picture. He coughs for a second.
“Yeah. Charlie, these are agents Colby Granger and Liz Warner. You should meet the others soon enough. I’ll go get the boss,” Dean nods to her and goes to search for Don.
“I…I admit I did talk to him, yes, but I never claimed to be an agent, he must have assumed I was. I’m terribly sorry, I don’t think I said I was a journalist, perhaps that’s why he was confused? Perhaps he was waiting for you to appear and that’s the reason he decided I was in fact an agent? Forgive me, I don’t understand where I made a mistake,” he looks back and forth between the agents, squinting his eyes and looking like he’s confused. Not natural.
Charlie throws the phone back into her bag and, convinced that the search on sigils she’d been assigned to is running, starts to hit the keys on her personal laptop to find this Steve Clarence from
“Hi, umm, Alicia,” Sam decides to go with the name, “I’m Sam Winchester, I was supposed to…” The girl cuts through before he can finish: “ID?” Sam shows it to her and Alicia’s look softens a bit: “Right, of course, I’ll show you to Pamela, she can fill in all your paper-work,” she gestures to her colleague and gets up.
“We’ll see, sure there’s something we could always discuss, but hey, big brother comes into town and you’re all clean again. What’s all that about anyway?”
Eppes is narrowing his eyes at him, he looks at Colby and answers: “Personal connections don’t do any good for our investigation, I’m sure you can understand that.”
“Well, there is, how shall I put this, a certain substance that won’t allow your body to burn, even if it’s lit from inside.”
See ya, guys,” she raises her hand before slipping out of the door. She doesn’t wait for Don to follow her, she just can’t wait to get out. Don is right, it’s a messed-up case already and they’re not even sure
written on his forehead. Why are they even keeping their little discussions in the library of all places?
“Our contacts,” he places the business card on top of the folder and taps on it, “we have nothing to hide, but we are very helpful. I’m glad we could clear up the misunderstanding and you can get back to finding the real culprits.” He lets out a grin.
“Yeah, I mean, could be just a reporter searching for an angle, but sounds more like a stalker. I mean, if he had told Reznik about being a journalist he would’ve spilled the guts, no need to pretend to be an agent.” He knows he’s right, but something  still seems off. Probably just the gazillion missing pieces. And the guy might know about things that go bump in the night.
“Okay,” Don raises his hands, “you win on that one. The name is Don Eppes, special agent,” the words are followed by the door opening and closing. Nikki finds a seat next to him and hands a few papers to Don. It’s information sheet about Sam Winchester, as well as a few photos of the victims.
That’s exactly why Dean freaking hates all the cops and agents and whatever the hell they are. Don is returning to this subject just to spite him.
i know i'm extremely late, thanks for sticking with this story! i've had troubles with finding motivation, but here's another chapter. hope you'll like it, i did enjoy writing it!
“Oh, last night, it was very late, but he said it’s an important case. It wasn’t an agent, was it? Do you think he placed here some listening device?”
No body answers. That is so not a good sign. If this is a business building, shouldn’t there be freaking people around? He reaches for his gun, but then on an impulse drags out the knife from his right boot and shoves it behind his back. Just in case. This whole house seems like a haunted castle. He gets to the ninth door and knock. “Hello?” There’s a swift of wind and shuffling behind the door. He tries to open it, but it’s locked. “FBI?” he tries again and touches the head of the knife with his fingertips.
“Yeah, yeah I do and so does Don. We’ll get conformation today, plus someone’s supposed to accompany him. I mean, I think his connections are legit, but do I think he’s an agent? No idea. He’s definitely a flirt though,” he adds.
“Yeah, sure, there’s a place nearby,” they’re at the doctor’s office, not the usual coroner, but some specialist, “hey, what did you do to get to the position you’re in?” Don muses almost to himself, but Winchester answers anyway.
“Mister hot-shot, huh? Seems like your badge real, but it only says agent, no high ranks or anything.”
The morning didn’t go as planned, impersonators showing up and delays in the work due to that. Still no closer to the murderer, unless of course it is Sam Winchester. Still a pretty good possibility, the one that Larry had come up with after all. Don observes Dean closely. The guy seems to be a living contradiction, one moment he’s all smiles and flirtation, the other serious as a true investigator. And way too fucking open-minded, didn’t even blink at the alien theories of Ronald Reznik.
“Not by name, no. I had seen her once or twice. She must’ve known the building was closed for the night. She didn’t even go for the door, seemed as if she was more interested in the walls. Maybe she saw the symbols, but they were invisible at the time?”
“This left corner marking, doesn’t it look more like a handprint than a drawing? Right here, in the middle of this ring-thingy? Look, I’ll put it on the wall,” he moves fast to project the image and largens it to the corner, “I might be wrong and I know we already got all the fingerprints they managed to find, but why would there be something like this?”
Don nods: “Kevin, did he look something like this?” he shows the picture Ronald Reznik had helped to draw from his phone.
“Ah, we haven’t seen for a while, I believe. I do miss our shared staring at the news stand every Monday morning,” the guy smiles thinking of memories, “speaking of disappearings, I have a question for you,” he looks around the room, nods at Sam and two other workers, “it’s about that hiding-in-plain-sight theory we once discussed and you had some alternative thoughts on the matter,” his voice has become so quiet that Sam has to sharpen his hearing to follow the conversation. Why is he listening in anyway? Old habits, probably. Dean would call it gut instinct.
“There’s a lot of mystery around this, the way they were killed, the markings. Perhaps we should look for other people dabbling in occult. Brings Steve Clarence back into the picture, doesn’t it? I wish we knew how it all happened.”
“Now I see it, yes, yes, it would serve as a freezer…” she seems to be lost in her own thoughts. Don tries to catch Dean’s eye, but he is also deep in thought.
They’re at the house and Colby stops the car. It looks like a normal place. The door creaks open before either of them could knock on it.
“No, no, I’m sure it’s all right, mister Reznik. I’ll make a phone call, agent Warner will keep you company,” he nods at Liz and steps outside. Reznik might be right about the listening device.
“I’m sorry,” he answers, “I don’t even know how they died. It’s …” Don’t say interesting, don’t say interesting, don’t say interesting, Dean conjures in his head.
“No patterns, just intuition for me,” Missouri closes the door and smiles too warmly at Sam’s questioning look. “An old friend, did him a little favour.” Sam nods. It’s not as if she owes him an explanation. He still feels as if something bad is looming over his head, instincts are telling him to flee, but he has no idea what to flee from or where to. So he stays and tries to concentrate on his tasks.
The library building is right beside a fountain and a few trees surrounding the study complex. Sam stops for a second, breathes loudly in and out and rubs his hands nervously, holds his bag a little stronger and finishes the walk to his new work place. There are so many people! He has worked as an apprentice in several colleges, but he has only ever worked full-time at public libraries. Those hadn’t been nearly as big or prestigious. He should really thank Rufus for giving those wonderful recommendations. Without him he wouldn’t be here. He finds the information desk along with a pretty black lady with a judgmental look in her eyes. Her name tag says Alicia.
This guy needs to be something special to recognize Dean and unsettle him like that. Nothing. Well, if she can’t accept a challenge like that, she’s not worth her name. She cracks her knuckles and starts digging other people associated with the magazine. Benjamin Lafitte, born and raised Louisiana, moved to LA four years ago, charges of a minor assault back home, clean sheet since then, articles mostly about vampires. Garth Fitzgerald IV, works part time for the journal, full time babysitter? Seriously? Seems to be specialized on werewolves. Joanna Harvelle, specializing on ghosts, damn she’s cute, but apparently just moved out of town and is contributing rarely these days. Billie Scythe, that’s not a real name, is it? And her area of expertise are reapers? That is so not a real name. What the hell is this magazine? Just as she’s about to think those were all the authors collaborating she finds Max Banes and witches. Added to Steven Clarence for demons and angels? Wait-wait-wait, is that where his last name comes from? Huh. Interesting. Especially since there’s no such thing as angels. To think that all their articles seem to be truthful, as far as Charlie can tell at least, it’s stunning that they’d list angels among the creatures that humans should be aware of. That’s slightly disturbing. According to the Steve-guy, angels can heal and smite people instantly. And you should never say yes to an angel, unless you want to die a long and torturous death. Lovely. Good thing they’re not real. Though the healing thing would be nice, no stupid comas after car accidents…
He backtrails out of the room, it’s not like he could do research here and walks right into someone.
“Heya,” sultry voice and sultry look behind black curls make Sam’s heart skip a beat. Are all the girls here this fantastic? “You must be Sam, huh, I’ve been waiting for ya, hop in, gotta just take your picture and that’s that,” Sam can feel her eyeing him and he wouldn’t mind it, but Alicia’s magnificent eye roll makes him cough uncomfortably.
“No need  for that, Colby,” he winks at the guy and smiles, “I have every right to be here, “ he shows his badge as he continues explaining, “why don’t you ask around a little from your bosses, huh? Cause as far as I can remember, I still have the power to intercept any investigation. You know what, I’m sure they’ll contact you soon enough, I did let people know where I was headed.” He broadens his smile and hopes the call will come soon. Otherwise he won’t have any legal means to convince this Don-guy. And it would be bad impression if Sam were to just leave.
“Yeah, alright,” Don nods, his eyes catching Dean’s. Guess he’s trying to be more careful than Dean anticipated. That’s good, that’s good.
“Don’t take long,” Don nods and observes as Dean walks away from him. “Sammy, hey,” he hears before he’s out of the earshot.
“Couldn’t be the best circumstances for a child. Is that why you turned to myths and the occult?” Don might have something there. Dean wants to snort-laugh, but he knows he shouldn’t. Sam does.
“Not yet. Well, one of them is protection against evil eye, but that’s a pretty common one, don’t think it’ll help.”
What? She whistles. “No wonder Don went easy on him. Still seems like something’s off. I hate politics.”
“I’m sure there’s a misunderstanding here somewhere,” he tries to jump in and salvage the situation.
“Why don’t you take a look at Ronald Reznik’s file instead?” Colby changes the subject. He knows he gave her an answer with that anyway, but at least they can concentrate on work now. Liz isn’t usually this curious, but it’s like a virus. He doesn’t know who started it, but after David left, suddenly his personal life became the most important subject in the group.
The angry look, fisted hands and clenches jaw speak for themselves. So this was presumably the brother he knew nothing about, Dean Winchester.
“What, you from the X-files unit or what?” Kevin scoffs, but nods and pockets the card. “Might get along nicely with the Constantine fellow.”
The stairs are dusty, the eighteenth step screeching painfully in his ears. There are no signs on the second floor either.
“I’m sorry, is this going to be who lied to who conversation? It does seem rather pointless to me,” Benny jumps in, visibly irritating Eppes with it. Dean and Steve are having a silent conversation again, what the hell is up with those two? Seems as if Steve hit the nerve with that agent remark. That’s unexpected.
“Good. Good. We’ve got a couple of consultants working on formulas. Maybe you can collaborate?” Don offers.
“Uh, yeah, she has a clean record. So clean it’s almost as if sealed.” His eyes are following every move Dean makes. “Like a lot of things around here.” And there it is, the reminder of Dean’s own shadiness, along with Sam’s.
“Yes, well, we’ll see you both,” Don throws and starts talking to his phone. Dean smiles, gives a little wave and rushes after him.
“All right, let me just get my things. Am I allowed to make a phone call?” he knows he is, he’s even allowed to not to talk with them.
“Right, I should leave you to your work,” Sam starts to walk away, when the man opens his mouth again.
“Can I help you take these somewhere?” Sam asks when he’s gathered all the papers, some in rolls, some just flying around loosely, they all seem to be some schemes and drawings, physics or engineering.
“Heya, Sammy,” he whispers before sliding next to him on the other side of the desk. He leans on the wall and looks at Sam. He looks good, healthy enough, Sam’s eyes travel with him until Dean gives a quick nod. Sam turns himself back to the agents. Dean notices the photos. There’s one of Megs’ face, one that looks awfully lot like Bela’s and a third one of various magical markings. Figures. Sam should’ve let his data be sealed. That way they would’ve known right away when someone was snooping around. Or maybe Sam did know, just didn’t make the phone call.
“Uh-huh,” Don doesn’t know what to believe. This all sounds too much like a hocus-pocus, still, so does physics. Nothing about this case has been conventional
“Gotcha!” she fistbumps the air before remembering that library doesn’t really have anything to do with the murders, apart from the suspect working there. But shit, that’s some ridiculous coincidence.
“You don’t look like a Steve,” Dean’s eyes are focused on Steve, who looks back at him and answers with a chilliness he usually reserves for threatening people. “And you don’t act like an agent.”
It’s next Tuesday when they come straight for him. His smile fades the moment he sees them. It’s the woman from before, accompanied by a white guy, who seems to be an ex-soldier.
something that’s not about men in my life, you let me know,” she puts as much innuendo in the word as she can muster up and winks. Liz smirks, looks away and clears her throat. That’s a good sign, right?
“Naah, no harm done, right? You alright though?” he looks up at Sam quizzically and tilts his head, “never good to be too lost in your thoughts.”
Ok, so now the families and their network. Charlie dives deeper into the mystery that is The Band of Veil, as she starts to think of them. It’s a tedious detail searching and at some point she forgets to take notes, leaving the pen in her mouth. Next of kin…Steve comes out empty, like he didn’t have any digital fingerprint left. Two years he’s been with the magazine and that’s all, all that she can find. Ridiculous. Andrea Kormos seems to be Benny’s wife? Fiancée? Their pictures are a filled with heart eyes and Andrea works as an event planner. Ok, next is Bess, Garth’s wife. Aww, they seem such lovely people! Damn it, she really wanted to not like them, it never ends well, does it? Ellen Harvelle, Jo’s mother, works as a bounty hunter. Well, that’s something, might be they all really do know the supernatural world. Billie Scythe, the only thing she finds are a few pictures of an old man who looks suspiciously like death and a photo of a lady, who’s tagged as Tessa. She can’t find anything about them. Max Banes, mother Tasha, father deceased, sister Alicia as the emergency contact. Wait-wait-wait! Now wait just a second! Alicia Banes, who works as a receptionist at the freaking library, the same freaking CalSci library that Sam does!
Sam let’s out a snicker, this time it seems to genuine, like something about Don made him laugh. “What’s so funny?”
Colby grabs the papers, takes a seat and starts flipping through them. Where the hell did he get that obsession? Like a dog with a bone.
“Colby, nice to see you again,” Dean’s smile doesn’t fade, when he turns to Liz, “and you must be agent Warner, lovely to meet you as well,” his eyes are travelling on her and he almost winks, “must be my lucky day. Dean Winchester, but y’all can call me Dean,” he offers his hands to her and Liz gives him a little nod while shaking it. “You guys aren’t big on smiling, are you?”
“I’ll go talk to the doc again, Colby, take the lead on the last potential witness, Ronald Reznik, was it?”
Antagonizing, really? Didn’t they get already, it won’t make him spill his guts? “Agent,” he gives a small smile, “do what do I owe the pleasure again?”
“That sounds almost kind, you know that?” leave it to the president’s head of security to pull up some soft tone. Victor laughs a little: “Yes, well, we do want you to clear this mess up. Good luck and say hi to Sam from me.”
“Yes, but he didn’t agree. Kept muttering about how it’s all out of order and not right. Creeped me out a little.”
“I can do that, thanks,” he says. Eppes seems a little taken aback about that. Can’t blame the guy, he hasn’t been very polite so far.
