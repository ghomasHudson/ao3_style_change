It glowed soft gold around everything it touched, like the pixie dust that Harriet had used to love so much in her precious copies of
“It’s ironic, for one of my kind to walk in dreams is a normal mode of transportation. Yet Humans place such firm walls between their dreaming and wakeful state.”
Mike's distressed voice crackled from the other end of the line, muffled by a background clatter that sounded like every single expensively breakable thing the man owned (Which admittedly probably wasn't much) was being smashed into pieces.
made his left hand clench in tension. Finally, and answer in the back of his head, shrieking alarm bells.
“Sherlock,” John whispered. He felt that if he spoke any louder it would be an invitation to ruin the peace the two of them had found. The Selkie hummed, a soundless question. “Would you…” John bit his lip, hesitating before daring to ask, “Could you… could you sing something?”
John wanted to argue, but he was honestly warm and comfortable and felt inexplicably safe. Drowsily, he didn't fight as he
Mycroft for his part thought the whole thing rather dramatic as he looked at it, sipping his tea in silent consideration. He leaned back in the deep wing-backed chair of his private room in the Diogenes' club, one hand drumming absently against the polished wood of his desk even as he took into consideration the scrap of a child staring out from the photograph paper-clipped to the front of the stack of pages.
and moved away. He kept his voice steady, did not shout at her, nor did his features seem to belay any semblance of disappointment. Still, Claude felt like a failure. She felt tears, hot with betrayal, fill her eyes.
Sneak murmured, and even as he spoke his fingers still twitched, wanting to continue playing but unable to so long as the amp was still connected. The metal box sat beside the chair, and Sherlock's gaze flicked to it as the detective's voice rumbled deeply.
It also meant the voices in his head remained blessedly silent- and it was only to himself that John admitted privately that they existed at all- and that he was afraid of their words curling in his ear like smoke.
Then Sherlock woke, jerking awake with a snarl already on his lips before he took in the rapidly-becoming recognizable peeling wallpaper of 221 C. Slowly, he took in the fact that he had slept for nearly a full day and a half, the morning sun probably just beginning to rise if his internal clock was correct. Much too long; he could usually manage to go without sleep for nearly a week before he collapsed. The bath had made him stupidly complacent. Unsure of how long John expected him to rest for, he came to wonder as always if he would finally be beaten for one of his transgressions. Nervously, he licked his lips and listened half-fearfully for the crack of a whip or an angry voice. Instead, he was surprised to hear a sound that was at once recognizable and yet alien to him, drifting softly down from the floor above him with a gentle caress. It had probably been the thing that had woken him up in the first place.
Sherlock’s eye, the one that had been itching, began to throb. He resisted the urge to close it, an image blinking into existence in the back of his eyelid. It was more of an impression, a suggestion of a memory. Cold snow, a freckled hand reaching for him. Like a wisp, it was too soon gone.
“My brother cared for me much of the time as well. Back then Mycroft wasn’t… as pompous as he is now. I will admit it only once- but we were quite close back then. There weren’t many other children that could keep up with us, and quite frankly before school began for me, I was the slowest mind in the house. Mummy was lightyears ahead of both of us, and our father hardly counted as fair play. He was never there, and when he was, he was more focused on upholding the family name.”
Sherlock replied coolly, his expression giving away nothing. Mycroft set his dish down, unflustered. His frost-fringed lashes fluttered as he peered up at his brother keenly, analysing him in the silence that stretched between their words.
Worse, Sherlock couldn’t even just refuse his transport; the curse of being an Incubi by nature meant that he
But it wouldn't be until after nearly a decade later that he'd realise that no, the Water-Spirit had never truly understood his Mother's words at all.
The only thing his brain hadn't bothered to delete about that night was the way Sebastian's hands had continued to roam despite his reluctance to let them, and how mocking the man's voice had been when his hands had ducked underneath Sherlock's belt.
, as the army's idea of “bonding” tended to be “work each other to the ground so that we're forced to interact or we'll be left behind”. As a result, he knew exactly how far each of the soldiers could run, knew what they ate and what their habits were. Yet he couldn't say to save his life who had family, who had someone waiting for them at home. He couldn't say for certain who had siblings, or who cried themselves to sleep at night.
Sherlock looked at his flatmate then, expression lost. So confused. Wanting to defend and protect John, and yet unable to see the danger. The things that haunted the insides of their heads. It was a beautiful expression, and suddenly unable to help himself, Sneak leaned forward. The chaste, almost sweet brush of John's lips against his own for a moment caused the detective's breath to halt, his eyes wide. For a second he forgot, for a moment it was simply....
Sherlock hadn't realised he was grinning. He carefully schooled his expression back to blankness. Nodding to his landlady in clipped fashion, the detective all but charged up the stairs, to which he
“I’m going to admit, I had ulterior motives for meeting you.” Mycroft looked at him in confusion. Ulterior motives? Greg was quick to explain. “Your mother… she told you to interact with me I take it?” Mycroft nodded, the pieces rapidly clicking together even as Greg spoke. He felt surprise and shock as it was suddenly made clear.
“Mummy sends her regards, still. As does father. They both miss you, despite what you would believe. They just have a tribe to rule, and the political situation…”
He wondered not for the first time if he should say something. Yet despite his occupation, Lestrade was surprisingly good at pretending that something wasn’t happening, even when he noticed.
Mycroft Holmes wondered if John knew, just how much such a small light could lend hope when he stared at the face of the cold world he had immersed himself in for someone else's sake.
Slowly, he listened as the crunching noises became gradually louder, followed by the familiar muttering burble of the creature talking to itself. From the tone, it sounded like it was having a heated inner debate, even as out of the corner of his eye John caught a glimpse of a happy jade-green tail wagging animatedly at the doorway as the Dragon paused at the frame of the flat. Though the young man didn't dare turn his head, he saw from his peripheral vision the hesitation of the creature as it paused at the threshold of the door. Having shrunk down to its half-human form so that John could see those pale blue eyes shimmer in suspicion under those dark curls and his nostrils flare, The Dragon took in the smells of the flat. The soldier noted clinically how  the Dragon's eyes flicked to the kitchen unerringly, scenting the flavour of bacon that is coasting in the air with languid appreciation. When he breathed in, the protruding expanse of his ribs heaved unhealthily. He exhaled frigid fog.
A half hour in, and the back of his neck had a healthy coating of sweat. It dripped from his chin as he gripped his knees, panting in lungfuls of air. Everything burned pleasantly, the cool air a blessing. Around John, the sound of the park filtered through to him between the sounds of his own breathing. He felt revived.
John offered him a seat in the living room, as well as a cup of tea. He wasn’t really sure if Selkies had any cultural differences in terms of making a guest feel welcome, but he assumed since Lestrade didn’t complain that he wasn’t being too obnoxious.
The Soldier's eyes flutter closed, and the last thing he sees is the outline of that umbrella, twirling in thought. It's black outline spins in a pinwheel, narrowing in his vision as he slips away. Spinning and looking almost like fireworks as the entire scene seeps into darkness.
Mycroft Holmes stood in the doorway, looking at the two men that had come apart with his entrance, now lying on the floor. John groaned, his backside aching with the harsh landing onto the hardwood. Sherlock however was already on his feet, adjusting the buttons of his sleeves and his eyes strangely… cold.
“He is due to wake up any time now, he’s been taken off the anaesthetic.” Mycroft’s voice drifted to him from the entrance to the hospital room. Sherlock made no outward sign of having heard him, but the words registered somewhere deep inside of him. His chest felt twisted in knots, and it was entirely unpleasant and strange. “You should know that recovery for him will be slow, and that he’ll likely slip in and out of things for a while. It’s not like films, he won’t wake all at once.” Sherlock listened to the slight tap of the man’s umbrella, his gaze locked onto John’s face. It was easier to deal with, in that moment. When he did not offer an immediate reply, Mycroft exhaled at length. “You would do with a few more meals, and some sleep. Remember, the two of you as it stands are connected now. Your health, is his.”
“This is not your territory, Moran. If you have no other business, leave, or I’ll make you.” Sherlock cut the wolf off, drawing attention away from John. The wolf jerked its gaze back towards the Water-Spirit, its ears flicking back in irritation.
He knew it by the way the man's feet touched the floor, cat-like and nearly soundless. He could feel it as his flatmate's figure stepped into the corner of his vision, the slow curling smirk on John's face not his own. The detective busied himself for a moment longer with the experiment he was working on, the pale shadow of dawn highlighting the curve of his spine in the dark blue of his dressing gown. It set him like a watercolour painting, and the darkness of his curls were like whorls of black ink even as he turned and assessed his friend up and down with one critical glance. He wasted no time identifying the personality that sat itself calmly in the kitchen, crossing their legs and humming to themselves the last trace notes of Beethoven's symphony number nine.
“I, Raz of Recheinbach, son of the Temple am here today to witness this ceremony, and contest for the fact that the Water-Spirit has claimed John, son of Walter with love in his heart and a promise to protect. Much like how he cares for the village, he shall provide for his bride.”
Looking to John, the Dragon's eyes were gold as he rumbled, almost shyly offering the tidbit of knowledge to his Mate. It was a huge show of trust, as Sherlock up until this point had been very recalcitrant on the ways of Dragon's and his past.
And that made him think of Victor, and Sherlock wondered not for the first or the last time if he looked as pale as his dormate had looked that night, if he was biting his lips that hard or if he was shaking as fiercely...
Sherlock's gaze was inscrutable but penetrating as he stared John down, searching for hidden or ulterior motive. However, the Human refused to flinch away, his jaw solid and unwavering, hands loose at his sides. The picture of someone giving an order. Except John wasn't ordering, Sherlock knew that now.
It was almost as if it wasn't so much disturbed at being held in a strange room with no windows and only one door, but
He began to study hard and late into the night, trying to find an answer for as much his own problems as the problems of others. He poured over books and heavy medical documents, putting his mind to better use than just sitting and wondering. Waiting for things was useless after all. As he got older, he wondered if all of the other versions were complete personalities, or if they had separate functions. Base duties. His therapist Sarah told him that often the other personalities would have been created under extreme levels of stress. She also told him that despite her attempts at hypnosis to try and bring some of the other personalities out, he had 'trust issues' and couldn't fully relax under her control.
He watched as John's dark blue eyes widened in awe and amazement. An expression Sherlock knew actually quite well.
. Keeping his voice low he ran soothing circles under the collar around Molly's neck, pleased when his Dragon slowly began to relax against him.
Yet John's vitals were stable, steady under Sherlock's thumb. He felt an irrational prick of uncertainty, even as he brushed his hands over John's arms again and again, feeling the lumped scar tissue and smooth skin.
He largely ignored his sexual impulses, and when they became too much, he blacked out and often just woke up in a strange bed with a strange woman or man.
“Arch-enemy.” The Water-Spirit corrected the connection lightly, voice rumbling in displeasure. John made as if to awkwardly hold out his hand to shake in meeting-Sherlock’s feelings towards the matter be damned- and instead found The Water-Spirit tugging his arm, pulling it back to his knee.
Sarah stepped into her office, staring at the resume laid out before her. Ex-soldier, army doctor. Seemed a bit overqualified, but this “John Watson” had seemed eager and willing to work. The nurse that had shown him in had described him as “Polite to a fault”, something Sarah couldn’t find enough of in people these days.
It was then that Sherlock glanced over, noticing the empty glass vial that lay discarded at his side. Forcing himself to blink away the burn of chlorine in his eyes, the detective made himself grip at his companion’s shoulders, determined to figure out Daniel’s state. Daniel, seeming to sense his question was quick to reassure.
Soon, however, they came to the cove, and both forgot safety once more as they were granted the sight of something awe-inspiring as they hoisted themselves to the top of the rock face.
“Information. Nothing indiscreet. Nothing you’d feel… uncomfortable with. Just tell me what he’s up to. You could even do it instead of John, if you feel like sparing him from anything unsavoury....”
I'd like you! Interesting, so very interesting Mr. Holmes! No wonder John can't stay away, you're the full package down to the
walked all the time between missing the war and letting it haunt him, he might have been more impressed. As it was now, he was more afraid. Afraid of all the unknown variables. Worried over everything and anything that might have happened to John while his Alters were at play. His voice soft, the words slipped out before the detective could stop them. His voice was almost pleading.
Mycroft’s voice was deathly quiet, and his answer was at once strangely comforting, and even more terrifying.
, he still reached for it. The greasy food distracted him from his inner repulsion as John carefully stepped forward, leaning forward to pull the plug. He wanted to drain the water and draw another bath, so that they would have a clean start. He watched as Sherlock's eyes widened and fixated on his hand, the creature's breath hitching and coming faster as the soldier's fingers almost brushed his feet. John felt a small pang of pity for the creature, but shook it off with the mechanical noise of water flushing down the drain. When Sherlock's eyes pulled themselves back towards his face, the soldier's features were composed. Friendly, but not overly so.
Mycroft’s deepest nightmare was a memory, and it was one that haunted him in the long stretches of the night in which he lay awake in his bed sometimes. Like most everything in his life, it was to do with Sherlock. The image would burn in the back of his eyelids if his brother was having a hard time, was too manic, too wild and savage in his movements, in his actions. It was a cold hospital bed, an ashen figure lying before him, under medicated sleep after having been brought in for an overdose that should have killed him. His greatest nightmare was reliving long nights unknowing if his brother was going to live or die.
you that I've seen your bank balance and you've only bought enough food to total to about one thousand calories
He added silently to himself. Daniel frowned, eyes glittering thoughtfully as he looked at the knuckles of his hands. It was a long time before he spoke, but when he did his voice was quiet, slightly rougher on the edges.
Regardless, he had gone into the Yard today feeling pretty low. He kept a professional air, but the truth was all Lestrade wanted to do was go home, sit on his beaten up couch like a gremlin in the dark and make some soup.
But lovely memories all the same, and the Dragon would collect them like treasures of immeasurable worth.
“You make them nervous.” Sherlock answered the question that his brother had never really asked, sitting up and bracing his elbows against his knees. Mycroft sighed through his teeth even as a creature, bones clattering together with a hollow clacking jumped up into Sherlock’s lap, coming to rest in the dip of his waist. It scratched behind one nonexistent ear much like a cat would, the dry sound of it grating to the sensitive ears that provided it audience. Sherlock’s long fingers absently reached to stroke the creature’s serpentine spine.
But no latte could make up for the way his old friend looked at him with new-found pity, blue eyes clouded with something unreadable as he looked into the rim of his cup.
Lestrade, seeming to sense Sherlock’s fear, flicked his eyes towards John. The obvious coupling between the two honestly didn’t much shock the D.I, but an insidious voice within himself did wonder if the ex-army doctor wasn’t to blame. It didn’t sound like John to force someone to dress a certain way for his own pleasure, but Sherlock was notorious for having a weak spot for his companion, an inability to say no. John dated women, had emphatically stated that he was not gay many times over. Yet Greg also knew that both men had feelings for one another, and that their coupling was about as inevitable as his own eventual divorce from his wife.
Cerioth greeted them with a small nod, surprisingly, a gun in his own hands. Not many Dragons bothered to learn how to shoot, but as John set his Browning on the bench and went to get supplies from the back to clean it, he could see that the creature was an excellent shot. There was something almost sinuous in Cerioth's movements, in the slow breath he exhaled at each shot, in the way those dark eyes unflinchingly locked on the foam target, hand applying the slightest pressure on the trigger. Dodge was equally talented, able to fire with accuracy even as she watched John from the corner of her eye, lips pressed together in an unreadable expression while she paused to reload.
The pup raised his head defiantly, feeling his new features settle into an unpleasant expression as he glared at the red-haired young man glowering at him from the edge of the beach. He was tall, taller than most of the others, and the rest of the pod turned at the sound of his voice. Sherlock hated it, the way he could command a presence so effortlessly while the pup struggled even to be heard.
The thought of Sherlock made John frown in consideration. It would be dark by the time he returned, and true to the creature’s nocturnal habits, Sherlock would likely wish to go outside. Yet the recent reports of disappearances made the woods that John passed on his way home seem eerie, and there was a prickling of unease steadily working down his spine. The night was beginning to feel unsafe, despite the fact that John had quite literally one of the best protective measures habitually glued to his side as of late.
A part of him recalled one time when he had gotten into a scrap with his father. Da had been drinking all day, and John had come home to find him in one of his rages. Except this fight hadn't gone like they usually did. Normally, the older man had thrown in a few hits then quickly gotten bored, uninterested because John never screamed and rarely fought back. This time though he hadn't seemed to care, and the beating had gone on for hours. John could remember the way those fists had felt on his face, like a rock hitting him again and again in the jaw. By the third hour he had been sore all over. He broke down by the end and allowed himself to curl into a protective ball, crying silently all the time.
There was a horrible twisting sound: the wet noise of a heart being squeezed until it punctured. With it, John watched in some awe as the Demon before him actually

chasing me off that easily, Sherlock Holmes.” He'd said, voice unwavering even as he took the man's agitated fingers in his own and forced him to lie still.
There were still rough patches. Sherlock, despite his newfound tenacity, still ate pitifully small amounts when in comparison to John’s diet. Yet that in itself was perhaps not entirely due to his disorder, as the detective had never really had much of an appetite, even as a child. A sparrow-like eater, the detective had always preferred to pick, rather than sit down and eat a full meal.
Slowly, inexorably, the egg had shifted further and further to the edge of the couch. Making its way to a steep drop to hard floor.
“No, thanks, and she likes everyone.” Molly deflected easily, scooping the Dragon up into her arms with ease. Nalini thought this great fun, rumbling pleased noises. She took the offered chair, letting Nalini curl into her lap like a serpentine puppy. Molly was warm, warmer than most Humans, and so provided an excellent spot to nap on.
Cara didn't realise that the pony was moving, moving deeper into the water. All she vaguely realised was that the cold feeling was reaching her knees.
“And… you’ve always…” John trailed off uncomfortably, glancing at the mark on Molly’s shoulder. It stood out, a lighter patch of skin that never tanned, and seemed silvery like scales. The young girl flushed if possible even more darkly in what could only be described as deepest shame. Her voice was tight and quiet, but it spat with a venom that John didn’t think Molly capable of, coming from somewhere deep and shaking within the Dragon.
They all told him it was a terrible accident, caused by rain and heavy traffic. John recalls nothing. Not a single breath of a honking horn, and not the screech of the brakes as his Father slammed down on them, sending the car into a skid and then a flip. He doesn't know if he cried or not then, but by the time he does remember waking up in the hospital, he no longer had any tears to shed. It felt like he had sobbed for an eternity, and yet he cannot recall a single drop hitting his cheek.
John’s voice broke the Dragon from his thoughts, as it was prone to do. Sherlock looked up from his usual curl in the hard plastic chair. John looked at him, seeming tired but interested. It was not often these days that John
Sherlock insisted on having Lestrade stay until nightfall, as he wanted the Selkie to lead him to the “scene of the latest crime” as he put it. This meant that Sherlock largely ignored the other Selkie, leaving John the task of playing host as he himself paced about the living room, wrapped up in his newfound project.
The Selkie was warm, nearly feverish to the touch, and felt like a furnace under John’s hands felt as he had chilled himself by hiding out downstairs for most of the night. For such a tall creature, Sherlock curled up rather easily, tucking his face instinctively into the crook between John’s neck and shoulder. At the contact, the Selkie let out a feeble whimper of pain.
The sun sank just below the horizon when Sherlock’s phone chimed. John’s number flashed eerily up at him, but the words were foreign and read like ash in the detective’s mouth.
He ran for several hours, his pace only increasing upon sensing John’s distress through their Bond. He ran even as he could taste a sour flavour on the back of his tongue, his body beginning to burn. Sherlock ran even when the fragile skin of his wings began to flake, peeling under the harsh onslaught of heat and desert. His nails began to crack and bleed, he felt like a vice was coiled about his lungs.
Sherlock's song cut off with a shrill, pained cry. The boy-creature crumpled like a stone, gripping the front of his groin with a pained shout of outrage and surprise. John didn't stop there, he struck out with his fist, socking the boy solidly in the jaw before letting out a little yelp of his own and trying to scramble away. However, he realised that he had unintentionally cornered himself against the sharp bluff of the rocks, and whimpered in fear as he turned to find the pale boy rising back to his feet, eyes slitted in anger. The child in that instant no longer looked like a boy, but rather something more feral and monstrous. His blue-green eyes were slitted almost like a cat's, his lips curling back to reveal slightly pointed canines. A rattling hiss of breath rumbled from the creature's chest, sounding like the animalistic snarl of a large wolf. Those bony limbs righted themselves to a graceful crouch, poised as if to spring. John's wide blue eyes widened further, and his skin crawled with sudden and intense terror.
Something cold shot through John then, like being doused in ice water. He felt his hands curl into the armrests of his chair, hard. Before them, tea lay untouched, John having eventually forgiven the older Holmes in the middle of his conversation. It now sat forgotten.
John was small, but he was military-trained and vicious in a fight. What was more, he did not appear to care that Sherlock’s voice was getting increasingly higher in his ear with stress. Like a train going full-throttle with no breaks, his fist raised again and again, landing squarely into George’s stomach. Each strike, Sherlock could swear he could feel bones creak with its force.
have an intelligence that could potentially rival even yours, and some have degrees in things that John nor I can even begin to comprehend. As well there are others with an I.Q below John's, whether because they're too young or it's not necessary for them to possess it. We have what we need. No more, and no less.”
The Chinese Dragon bowed its head then, and John’s eyes flicked to the creature’s back. Much like Sherlock, Xavi bore marks of cruel handling. Deep scarring gouged his back, and scars ran white and whip-like along his thin upper arms. Swallowing past the sudden lump in his throat, John spoke softly.
Still, Sherlock noticed that John had been quieter than usual, and though normally he’d merely deduce the reason, he found himself trying to avoid looking too closely. Perhaps it was because a small part of him felt that if he did so, John might stop the gentle touches he seemed to be favouring as of late.
The pair of them eventually seated themselves onto a bench, Sherlock still grumbling but less so than he had been before. In front of them was a small pond, and ducks swam back and forth searching for bread crumbs. John watched them even as Sherlock took out his phone to check for signal, feeling a contentedness he hadn’t felt in a long time seep into his bones.
Sherlock however didn't appear to be listening. His gaze was attentive, but it was closed off. He was no longer twitching, but he had gone stock-still, and somehow that was entirely more insulting. To be so completely ignored that the man couldn't even bother to fidget in his presence. John ground his teeth together in infuriating frustration, reaching unthinkingly to clasp the man's knees as he growled, forcing the detective to look up at him with eyes widened in shock at the physical contact.
She’d still taken his heart, desperate to be united with the woman she had truly loved. She had been eaten by the wolves she had betrayed him for, Sherlock left heartless, reduced to a Spirit and filled with hatred.
At the mention of Queen Rania, Hajera’s spine stiffened. She flicked her gaze towards the woman, reluctantly hopeful. Her hands reached for the headphones, and she found to her delight that they made it easier to drown out the helicopter’s din.
His mother hummed, her voice soft and amused. She lead Mycroft back to her side with her tail, until he and his brother were tucked safely by the warmth of her stomach.
He guiltily admitted to himself that he hadn't bothered to think of his friend at all in the past couple of days, too wrapped up with Sherlock. In fact, he hadn't left the house once since the Dragon had arrived, and he was truthfully beginning to go just slightly stir-crazy. He had caught himself tapping his fingers nervously against the counter, a habit that only came forth when he had energy that was not being spent and not enough to do. Also, he was starting to run dangerously low on groceries. The bread was gone, and he had used the last of the milk this morning in his breakfast cereal and tea. Soon, he'd be forced to drink the horrid fruit tea Mrs. Hudson had given him as a welcoming present (not that the sweet old woman didn't have the best interests at heart) and John knew he would sooner eat his favourite jumper.
“I don’t care what you think I think.” Mycroft growled, rolling his eyes. “The fact of the matter is that you have a brilliant mind, and it is slandered acting like this.”
Though she had been telling her story just fine, John noticed that here Irene’s throat had seemed to close up. He knew with terrible certainty who she was now, but still he waited for her to push through with her story. He knew that the woman he was talking with wasn’t here, not really.
The threat fell flat however, particularly as it only made Sherlock’s grip tighten, his bloodlust deepen more. He was in the mood for a fight, and threat of death really didn’t have much effect on him. The Dragon smiled, but it was not a friendly thing. His voice was a purr even as he covered Sebastian’s mouth with his free hand, dangerously edged.
Lyle then turned to John, seeing the uncomfortable lock of his jaw and the tense line of his back. The blonde man thought he saw the man frown slightly, but quickly it was smoothed over with a cheesy smile and a clap on his shoulder that made him want to cringe.
Before he could finish the apology however the detective stood, reaching around the table and embracing John fiercely in a rare and yet significant hug. It was the bone-crushing type, the kind that made
A part of John wanted to argue that it wasn’t fair to Sherlock. A part of him was all but crying in relief, because someone

anything to do with Gems, with their powers. John grew to hate with a loathing that was black and unfathomable and bottomless as the sea.
His Mummy looked every bit as radiant as the moon in which she controlled. Frozen, pallor, untouchable.
He had approximately three weeks until he was going to be shipped to a base along with Mike and hundreds of other soldiers, each accompanying a heavily-scaled weapon disguised as a Servant. It was ridiculous, how people fooled themselves into thinking that their Dragon house-pet was a tame domestic creature instead of a wild animal. Even the military deluded themselves, pretending they were the ones in control of a War they were all losing. John smirked morbidly. It was a wonder; the young man thought privately, that most deaths happened on the battlefield. Why the Dragons didn't just rebel was beyond him, but perhaps it was because they were caught by the illusion as well. They had so long been told that they were beneath Humans, that they were savages, that they had become savage in kind.
Sherlock watched as those pale eyelashes fluttered, unconsciousness swiftly returning to John once more. He longed to reach out, to touch those fingers that twitched in distress. The detective instead made do by opening Henry’s file, hungrily absorbing all the knowledge he could about the assimilation of personalities, and how it would affect John’s future.
“One does what one must, when one has a goal before them that is greater than themselves,” the man murmured, seeming to once again read his thoughts. Sherlock growled, a subsonic noise that vibrated in his bones and would make the hair at the back of a normal man’s neck stand on end. It was the sound of a predator, inhuman and wild.
“You’re distressed.” The quiet deduction caused John to instinctively shake his head no, hesitating a moment before he carefully tried to explain.
The rocky shore glittered like jewels in the darkness, and Sherlock picked his way along in bare feet, heedless of the possibility of sharp shells beneath his toes. John walked behind him more slowly and in shoes, the crunch of his solid footsteps a faithful indicator of his following. John watched the Selkie’s silhouette nervously, tall and strong and bare. Though it was technically private property, the beach wasn’t exactly the most secluded of places, and the thought of anyone seeing Sherlock, naked and moonlight-white filled him with a surprising amount of possessiveness. There was of course the fear of being caught out beside a man completely naked out in the somewhat admittedly sheltered public of the cottage’s grounds, but more than that it was the small voice in the back of John’s head that whispered that Sherlock was a welcome sight.
And the creature would look less like a powerful monster and more like a pup that had been forced to grow into an adult, as he clutched his cloak to his face and derived a little comfort from the softness of his own pelt.
It was true, looking about the kitchen. John had made not only waffles, but had gone out of his way to go down to the market at some point, obviously. Fresh strawberries had been sliced up, rolled in sugar and awaiting placement onto said waffles. Whipped cream in a bowl, homemade had been left on the table (conspicuously absent of experiments for once).
Sherlock's wings stretched to engulf the both of them, shielding John in an ever-changing force field that melted from blue to green to darkest violet. It was lovely and strange, and he longed to reach out and touch.
His breath quietly began to quicken as he saw the way Irene looked at the fallen man. There was no mercy in her expression.
He was quickly told that though his power was a gift, he was not to use it around those easily frightened. His father, deep voice shaking the throne room even in its softness, was firm.
“Lord Sherlock is most excited to see you, he’s told me. He hopes that you like honey and nuts, and there are some new foods for you to try. I personally quite like the Daisy-wine.” She babbled excitedly, fawning over John’s clothes briefly by reaching out and touching his sleeve, adjusting his sash. Her efforts were deliberate, a mother attempting to cheer up a disgruntled duckling, and John appreciated her trying even if it wasn’t exactly welcome.
John laughs, a bright and airy sound that fills the dim back of the cab with light. The noise is so open, so childlike and warm that Sherlock is surprised it can come from someone with such sad eyes. In many ways John Watson looks like a man just waiting for his grave. His clothes are cheap and warm, not meant to last for a long time. He has the haunted gaze of a person being hunted by an unseen force, possibly nightmares of his past. When Sherlock sees him, his first impulse is to consider the fact that the Browning in the drawer of the man's desk shouldn't be left out in the open for him to use, for his own safety. Yet there are moments, brief flashes where the Detective sees that he is not completely broken. Scarred yes but not shattered. For some reason, he wants to see more of what John
Immediately, the rather cute expression melted into a snarl, the Dragon's spine bristling defensively as it mistook John's chastising tone for anger. The young man instantly froze, lifting his hands above his head in a sign of passiveness. Still the creature curled into a sharp ball like an angered cat, its eyes narrowed to slits as growls tore from his throat and made the walls vibrate with their power. Thoughts once again circling calm tones, John searched the kitchen for something suitably distracting to draw the creature out of its fury. His eyes landed on an abandoned bag of ice he had left on the table, and slowly he reached over to take a cube out of the package. John felt rather than saw the sudden shift in energy. Anger slipping into a kind of suspicious curiosity. Sherlock flinched slightly when the young man lifted his hand in a fist, but soon leaned forward when he saw that something was held in its fingers. When he saw the ice-cube his fever became apparent to himself once again, the heat making him pant slightly just at the thought. His head turned unwillingly to the trail of melting cubes that disappeared down the hall of the flat. For just a moment, a strange image of footprints in snow flickered across the Dragons' mind, he shook his head clear and turned back towards the Human called 'Jawn'. His growls lessened as slowly, the Human came forward with the piece of ice in his hands.
“Text Lestrade,” She ordered, all four eyes narrowing like a wolf following a scent keenly “Tell him you’re looking for a killer that is hiding his murders by making them look like heart attacks.”
“Yeah, and this here's Sherlock.” John replied after only a moment's pause, caught by the effusively friendly atmosphere as well as the hum inside of his thoughts, when the other Dragons sought to make a niche inside his head. Like different channels, they all hummed, bees that had to be turned down carefully, lest they be shut out by accident.
It was not the first time this complaint had been raised, and Sherlock sympathised. He exhaled from his chest silently, considering. The silence that stretched between them was companionable, but it was heavy with words left unsaid. Neither of them wanted to touch it, lest it burst at the seams. Yet there was a heaviness to it, filled with possibility. Sherlock was acutely aware of his wings, shifting colours with his thoughts. They were the softest grey, nearly a pink that could only be seen at the edge of a sunset.
he was dangerous. Before his eyes he saw the creature slowly melt into only a man, someone soft and inviting, a warm body calling for him like a beacon of light. Like a moth drawn to a flame the soldier wavered, caught in a web of music and magic as he swayed in place. Sherlock carried on in earnest now, even as he shifted, bringing his bonds subtly closer towards where the Human could reach. His eyes roved, picking out details he saw of his Mate, the life he had lived while the Selkie had been lost… so lost without him…
Sherlock murmured, even as leaned into John’s personal space. He held up the fruit between them, yet even so John’s eyes flickered to the Water-Spirit’s lips apprehensively. If Sherlock noticed, he pretended not to. Instead he explained, quick low. “I cannot let your physical form leave my palace, not before the wedding. There are ancient laws and traditions that unfortunately, people get tetchy if you don’t uphold. However, if you are amenable, I can guide your dream-self. You can visit your family, your village there.”
“That hurt....” She sobbed softly, and she bit her lip as the group of homeless laughed raucously. The one in the orange jacket was harsh and jeering as he sauntered over to the fallen army doctor.
“I remember you. Take orders well, smart too. Not afraid to throw your weight around. Dragon's well-trained too.” John only heard the next part because he was straining to listen, head ducked down as Sebastian leaned forward and purred into his friend's ear
just enough to not seem obvious. This is a conscious effort as you changed clothes the moment you switched with John. Since you've somehow managed to
A small, impossible kernel of hope lodged itself in John's throat like a stone, even as he heard the footfalls of his sister approaching. Her voice was breathless with having run long distance.
him, John's blue eyes making her question seem rather innocent and mild. However Sherlock was cautious, because he suspected that there was cleverness within that child's façade. He'd made the mistake of underestimating John's Alters before, and he wasn't going to do it now. He kept his expression neutral, although he did use warmer language when addressing the child. He didn't want to upset John after all, no matter what age he was. No matter what aspect of him it was.
He had first found the photographs. Strewn about the flat almost negligently, they were deceptively hidden
Conrad finally snapped, cutting off the distressed shouting with his own booming voice. Swearing obtusely he rifled in his pockets, trying to figure out where the hell John put their phone. Soon his hands closed over the familiar cool touch of metal and he pulled out the infernal contraption, hands clumsily turning it on and dialling the only number that John Watson had coincidentally memorized.
John had been working at the coffee shop now for almost half of the winter months, and soon he’d have enough money to finally afford the small flat he’d been saving up for in London central.
When they were both finally sitting, the detective's luggage lay forgotten in the living-room. Yet Sherlock felt as if he were carrying it already on his shoulders as he picked at his food, wanting to eat and yet unable to quite bring a bite to his mouth. The scrape of his cutlery running over the bottom of the plate was a constant, soothing pattern.
For a moment, he thought it just Sherlock leaning against them both, rambling about some case or another Lestrade's given him (a cold case, easily solved from home. Sherlock refused to leave without his egg and there would be no way to explain such a thing to the Yarders) when there was a nudging against his arm, where he was idly holding their egg in his lap. For a moment he froze, looking down in surprise, and Sherlock's deduction cut off mid-rant immediately as he noticed the change in his partner. Instantly the Dragon was down on the floor in front of the couch John was sitting on, eyes wild and frantic as he demanded
Scribed in an old-fashioned sort of lettering, John found the Table of Contents, appearing to be handwritten and impeccably organized. Above it, written in bold ink, was a single definition surrounded by two hand-inked Wyverns, their tails being devoured by one another as they formed a ring about the paragraph.
“Oh. James doesn’t have parents.” Sherlock and John looked at one another, and in that look was a mixture of concern and unease. Turning his son to face him, Sherlock looked Hamish in the eye. His voice was deceptively calm.
It was such a smooth, gradual transition that it was impossible to entirely tell where man ended and beast began. Scale turned into flesh, and flesh turned into scale.
“Bad idea, Jounhin.” Sherlock answered the unspoken thought through a yawn in the dark. “As you might have noted, I am stronger than I appear.”
”  Dodge murmured. Morstan put together the rapidly-amalgamating puzzle for John, her voice tight with controlled calm.
Sherlock didn't know what was wrong. By all accounts, the logical part of his brain told him that nothing was amiss. Still the silence of the flat irked him, and his hands trembled with need as his gaze flicked uneasily about the three corners of the living room. Everything chafed like an ill-fitting suit of armour, and his shoulders twitched with nerves. He sat curled in the fourth corner, tail wrapped about himself tightly as he exhaled sharp gusts of fog through his nose, trying to steady his racing heart. It thundered through his veins anyway, and the Dragon could imagine the way his blood vessels were undoubtedly widening, stretching to allow maximum blood-flow through his system. He felt heady from it, his brain swimming with the increase of oxygen.
“The likes of you wouldn’t understand. You come to our village, attack our men, women and children and disappear leaving us shattered. How do you think that feels, left to recover only to be destroyed once more?”
And right now, he could feel the tingling along the base of his skull that only came when danger was very, very near. If he pulled John closer to him instinctively, then neither of the Holmeses chose to mention it. Sherlock's voice was acerbic but marginally less spiteful than usual as he murmured stiffly
“Jounhin won’t disappoint, Mycroft.” Sherlock growled, temper sparking. He set his goblet down, hands folding before his face even as he leaned nearer.
He got tired of having his elbow yanked out of its socket, John soon dug his heels into the stone ground, forcing Sherlock to jerk to a halt. He spun to glare at John, his blue eyes illuminated by a crack of lightning. John forced himself to stand his ground, because there was no way he was going to be trapped in his damn room again.
And Sherlock found himself nodding, accepting even as those hands moved away, and Sneak straightened, voice quiet. His words took on that of a storyteller's, and he stared at his hands even as he began.
John grit his teeth and braced himself for an explosion when Dodge promptly snapped her fingers, uttering a military-like command. Testing John's honesty.
to the point where John was standing there, fists clenching and unclenching, eyes flashing dangerously, well Sherlock would rather privately admit to himself was likely his fault.
He didn’t want to give this “Mycroft” any more leverage over him than he already had. A collarless prison still had steel bars.
Greg’s face flushed a bit in embarrassment. He set a hand down on the young Dragon’s shoulder, glancing at Mycroft apologetically.
It would be perfect, if it didn’t feel like John was performing said actions out of a sense of guilt. The worried look upon the man’s face was infuriating and concerning, and Sherlock couldn’t look at it too long before he wanted to shout at the man to stop being so incredibly dull. John’s appetite had also waned as of late, and all in all it made John look pale and somehow fragile. It was a look that seemed completely out of place on his face, and Sherlock wished not for the first time that he had the ability to actually read minds instead of just guess. For guessing at
“Colonel Wilkes I'm sure mentioned of course to the new recruits that they are not to abuse their Dragon's collars except in dire circumstances?”
her.” Sherlock murmured this while reaching for his scarf. On the surface, it was a logical conclusion, and John could find no fault with it. Yet the smaller, more jealous side of him thought of how intently the detective had been scrolling through Adler’s website as of late. He thought of Sherlock’s avoidance, his careful insistence that not even their hands brush in passing. It was with a small scowl to himself that he followed, the bad feeling in his stomach only getting worse as Sherlock hailed a cab.
let it rain, I’ll do whatever you want. I promise, I won't fight you.” Sherlock closed his eyes tightly at the words, quite suddenly loathing himself more than anything else in the world. The words he had spoken in haste, in anger hot and vile now seemed like sharpened blades, and they worked beneath his skin and did their best at causing him agony.
Sherlock needed to find John, and he needed to escape this cell of white walls and bland sterility. That decided, the Dragon prepared to Shift. He braced his palms against the cool tile floor, eyes slipping shut to reach his true self, tucked away under the mask. He was interrupted by a sharp rapping on the door, breaking him from his single-minded mission.
Anniversary of what, neither of them had to say. In response, Sherlock spoke in clipped, emotionless tones.
“Don’t be dull, you have every right to be bitter about it, angry even.” The detective’s voice softened minutely, and now John chanced a glance up at his partner. Those blue eyes he had come to love so much were trained to him, willing John to hold his gaze. “What matters, is that you also allow yourself to be
“How does… How do you manage to run a kingdom like this? Especially with… well being unable to…” John blurted the question out before he could think, promptly trailing off before flushing at his own forwardness. Dodge would have his head if she had known he was asking such things, but the Queen fascinated him on some level. There was an aura of Dragon-based Magic about her, a sort of haze that made the Thrall side of John quiver with energy.
John didn't recognise the man that called out to him at first, yet still every single one of his muscles seized in irritation and disappointment when Mike Stamford of
At first, he thought he was imagining it, but as he blinked awake, John became aware of the moon. The clouds had finally dispersed some, and its pale rays shone down and turned everything to white and silver. The sand under the boy's feet seemed to glow ivory. Looking slowly up from his knees, John blearily realised that he was not alone.
“Piss off, Mycroft.” John panted, shooting a look towards the bench a few feet behind him. He hadn’t noticed as he’d passed, but of course now that he looked, he saw Sherlock’s older brother. Still dressed in a bloody three-piece even though he was sitting in a park, too.
“There used to be lilies here.” Sherlock’s father finally commented after a breath of a pause, using his pipe to gesture to the blackened flowerbed. Sherlock looked towards it, hands folded in their lap.
Her final words to him as the Handlers' get the trolleys to lift the Crates to the car were laced with a sort of sardonic amusement.
Some of Sherlock's strangely affectionate mood had worn off by the time John got the tea-tree oil ready. The soldier had known to give the Dragon some time by himself to recover slightly from the stress of earlier. While politely asking Sherlock to clean up after himself, John had soaked a cloth with the pungent-smelling liquid. When he came back to the living room, the Dragon was back to relative normal, save for one small detail.
“Dodge was just here.” He murmured “Said you’re with me today.” Sherlock frowned, expression thunderous even as Murray yawned and scrubbed at his face. The Dragon moved into the man’s personal breathing area, eyes slit-like as he stared the soldier down. The Dragon’s Magic sparked about him, a dangerous force of power that crackled and made Bill’s focus spring to attention. Warily, the soldier regarded Sherlock, voice unnaturally calm as he held his hands up- an obvious sign of submission. “Hey now, I knew you were going to be upset, but John’s in good hands. He’s with Dodge and she and Cerioth are his backup-”
“Though I cannot harm your Dragon without provocation, Murray, I think you'll find I don't have to. It's always been in his nature, rookies, don't forget it next time you need a favour from him. Murray here can't stand to watch anyone be in pain.”
No one came for Sherlock Holmes, and unfortunately, Greg found himself releasing the young man, slipping his phone number by way of apology into the addict’s belongings without even really having meant to.
The elder Holmes' gaze flicked over the man that had once been John Watson, eyes tracing over each stain, each bruise that lined the man's arms (his sleeves were pushed up to his elbows, revealing the scars that Mycroft already knew were there) each cut and purpling smudge of violence on his skin. The elder Holmes for a moment lost his voice as he analysed the raw carnage from merely the blood underneath the ex-army doctor's fingernails. His voice terse, and behind the man Anthea hovered with her phone in her hand. It was clear she was preparing to signal for emergency, should the need arise.
“Why do you want to go home? Your wife is thinking about having an affair and it’s not like you care, really. You’re focused on your job completely, too focused to be having anything close to a regular social life. It’s supported by the circles under your eyes- caffeine and sleeplessness don’t go hand in hand well. Even if you wanted to go home- bringing me in will just create more paperwork and endless amounts of tedium.”
Yes, the creature was territorial.... in fact he had probably Claimed the basement flat with such ferocity that poor Mrs. Hudson wouldn't be able to sell the room out to anyone ever again lest she have to explain the claw marks. The Dragon had used his scent, had wanted to make sure that no one would enter a space that he perceived as
Sherlock huffed, after a moment of hesitation allowed his to hand be shook in greeting. His manners were stiff and awkward, but although he showed discomfort John saw that within the Dragon there was no appearance of fear. John felt his chest swell in something dangerously akin to pride.
Mike hadn't realized that there were certain scents that triggered things in Molly's memory, echoes that triggered her memories of the past. She was no stranger to sexual abuse, and when she woke to the sharp and acrid tang of cologne hanging heavily in the air, her sleep-addled mind immediately snapped to a Master she would have much rather forgotten. Opening her eyes, she saw not the plain bed she had been given to sleep in, but a relic of a past time that made her shudder and cower in fear.
It would have almost sounded like joy, had not the sensation of it sent chills along the Dragon's spine.
John was about to respond in agreement when an echo rang in his ears. It was strange and sweet, and for a moment, he thought he had imagined it. Then it came again, a low and moaning sigh. It came from the cove, from the shadowy darkness of it. Though he couldn't make out the words of it, he could pick out some vague impression of its meaning. Like a lullaby he once knew. His eyes seemed to move against his own will to stare at the entrance to the cove, gaze feeling heavy and lethargic as his own heartbeat began to deafen his ears.
, what are you afraid of? Who might come after our daughter?” The thought of anyone, any enemy or unseen force taking their child away sent a fiercely enraged pang of protectiveness through John, and Sherlock could smell it, coppery and warm. Still the Dragon seemed to hesitate, expression flattening into reticence, avoiding his husband's gaze. After a minute of silence, John tried again, more insistently.
John to his credit refused to bend to the strange Selkie’s will once he was inside the cottage, forcing his mind to wrench itself from the commanding air that had put a haze in his thoughts. He held the door open for the massive seal, having had to all but drag it up the steps, and the once-dignified creature looked rather ruffled and irritated as it slid itself inside.
Her small, sturdy legs then carried her through the crowd and she darted amongst the waves of clothing and noise without a care in the world. Sherlock straightened, watching her go. His expression was unreadable. Beside him, John smiled.
“Please.” John heard himself beg, fear making his throat dry. For what, he didn't know. Couldn't know. He looked up into those starlit eyes, trying to see an ounce of pity, an iota of understanding. He prayed that someone could see how very afraid he was, how unsure. Pressed against Sherlock's chest, he could feel the inhuman cold that lingered in the Spirit. The tightly-coiled muscles underneath his robe held John in place. The young man wondered how it would feel when he was held down by those arms, and bile rose in his stomach and he fought harder, close to tears. But no tears came, because John refused them. He bit down savagely on his tongue, tasting blood but still unable to stop the litany, breathless and barely there of
“Blackmail. She’s being threatened by another member of the aristocracy. Some… rather compromising photos were taken, and if they were to be made public… well. The Gem Homeworld would be a chaotic place indeed.”
Except that none of it happened, not really. For Sherlock blinked and like a mirage the scene vanished before him, his jaws closing in around air. A vision from across the Bond, made real by heat exhaustion. The Dragon’s legs trembled, and a moment later they gave out.
It gave a gratifying pop and sizzle in response as the food turned and settled, the bacon curling predictably at the edges like crinoline on the skirt of a dress. He imagined it was laughing at him as it snapped and crackled, telling him off for the dark circles under his eyes and the cramp that had developed in his left hand slightly from writing so many notes. His spiral-bound notebook lay on the coffee table, cream pages now filled with his Doctor's script.
The D.I quietly moved forward, finding Sherlock silhouetted by a hallway mirror. The detective’s face was turned artfully away, and though Greg couldn’t see much, he could tell that the detective was rubbing something off of his lips, his eyes and cheeks. Lestrade’s eyes narrowed upon the tissue, seeing the faintest wine-coloured lipstick even as incredulously he found himself asking “Are...are you wearing
Sherlock frowns, running through the conversation he had with John not to long ago. His response sounds rude, but he believes from John's explanations anyway that it is the honest truth.
Molly and John walked back to the barracks together, neither of them saying a word for a while, unsure and awkward around one another. It wasn’t that John wasn’t fond of the quiet Fire Dragon, rather he found her sometimes very… shy. He didn’t want to overstep himself, make her uncomfortable. In doing so, the young soldier unwittingly created a barrier between them of awkward inquiries about the weather and truly British attempts to avoid any truthful or meaningful conversation.

Many people had forgotten the instability that had come to her land before the Dragon War. They reminisced of better times, unaware or forgetful of the blood feuds that so often broke out over the crown. It was so long ago, many had already passed and so knew no other life.
Fruitlessly, John tried to tuck his shirt into his sash. It did nothing. His sister pounded harder on the door.

It made his hands ball slowly into fists, and his voice rumbled lowly in his chest, more a snarled accusation than a question. The detective's gaze was dangerous as he looked up at the man hovering over his shoulder, his mouth twisted in a curvature of aggression as he looked at Sneak and growled “Your games though obvious are not particularly scintillating. If you will do little more than
It was clear to John upon entering the home of Irene Adler that she came from a line of Gems best-designed to rule. A Pearl opened the door upon their arrival, and her petite presence alone alerted John to the fact that Adler came from old power. The Pearl introduced herself as “Kate”, and she took Sherlock’s ruse as a priest that had been assaulted with stride (and oh, how
It had been three nights later that Sherlock had found himself all but crawling out of his skin and his mind, as much from withdrawal as something else.
John had never been good at dancing. A typical British male through and through, his few school social events had lead him to discovering quickly that he had two left feet, and possibly a third leg that was invisible, tripping him up. He mastered a few base moves to impress secondary school girls, but beyond that he was well and truly hopeless.
Both man and Dragon made sure that Murray slept each night, as he was prone to sitting outside in the cold desert air, gazing up at the stars with a lit cigarette in his hand, shoulders trembling. John couldn't even say for sure if it was the flight training that was bothering his friend, or if it was the memory of something else. Some deeper running scar.
The detective marveled at how such a small, insignificant thing could make all the world of difference.
John winced against the sound, curling into himself even as he frantically looked for his bow, tossed carelessly a few feet away. Blocking him from it was Jim’s right half, which was rapidly becoming stained red-black. John still couldn’t quite look at the beating organ, and he struggled to breathe as panic truly began to cloud his mind. Oh,
“Could be dangerous,” he muttered, and though Sherlock could not have possibly have understood, he seemed to read something in the man’s body language. The Selkie smiled, and it was a small, surprisingly gentle thing as those slender hands reached towards the shore, picking out something amongst the bracken and stones. Sherlock knelt towards John only to grab the man’s wrist, hand covering the old Bond-mark. It was a silver moon of flesh, as colourless as the Selkie’s eyes. John found deposited in his palm was a smooth piece of sea glass, but its colour was unusual and eye-catching. The colour of teal, it sat a nearly perfect marble in John’s palm. As he held it up to the moonlight, something prickled in the back of John’s neck. It took him a moment to recognise it as Sherlock’s song, cautiously humming as he knelt, as if waiting impatiently for John’s reaction. The Selkie’s voice was soft as it traced the glass in John’s palm before curling his blunt fingers over its surface.
It was a difficult one, the murderer actually a duo- twins named Henry and Albert Wright. They had been able to mimic each other with near-perfection, and as a result each had had an alibi at the time of the killings. However one of them had made a mistake, forgetting that his twin didn't part his hair in such a neat and fastidious way. As a result the detective had given chase, throwing himself after the killer without second thought. After a moment, John had followed behind.
Molly greeted him in the hallway, her gowns once again changed but equally odd as before. Her skirts were deep violet, her hair held up in elaborate braids that were not a style that the girls in John’s village wore. In fact, the longer John stared, the longer he found himself thinking that Molly was beautiful, but so very strange to him in her clothing. It didn’t help the dreamlike quality of the place, and John once more felt a twisting in his stomach for home. Molly smiled at him, her chipper attitude still working on making him feel at home even amongst the cold walls and her colder master.
John was pinned to the ground by Sherlock, shielded from the blast of heat that radiated like molten lava, causing the air to shiver with fire. He felt the side of his face heating up with it, not-quite burning. When he blinked, there was a blast of air that blew back his short-cropped hair from his face. When the soldier opened his eyes, there was a ragged hole in the roof of the medic bay.
She spoke mostly in growls and snarls, got her way by purring like a cat or whimpering in such a way that John's heart strings would tug painfully in his chest. She ruled the flat like a tiny queen, wings growing day by day, flaring outwards with interest or curling about her when she was in a strop like a protective shield. This body language was relatively easy for John to read, and with Sherlock by his side, he had no issues communicating with his daughter (in fact, Elena had grown into a fascination with medical terminology, and quite often tailed John with a big picture book in her hands of human anatomy, asking questions by pointing and chirping exectantly). The issue, was when John became rather painfully aware that his child was rather deprived of socialisation with children her own age, and found the need to bring it up to Sherlock one night while they lay cuddling under the covers of their bed.
“They can’t,” Sherlock murmured, though he wasn’t sure if it was to himself or to John. “Which is why I’m trying to prove that it’s murder.”
It looked dark inside. John swallowed nervously, balking a little as he strained to see anything inside the inky shadow. Sherlock didn't seem as perturbed. He bounded ahead, stopped only when the hand attached to his new friend's wrist was yanked back by John's hesitation. The pup turned to John in confusion, huffing irritatedly as he realised what the problem was. The creature's voice turned soft and soothing, and even though John was aware he was being manipulated now, he couldn't quite bring himself to care. The tune coiled deeply into the little boy's chest, tunnelling its way into an aching emptiness right by his heart that he didn't know existed until now. It was pure comfort at its most base sound, and no child nor man could hope to resist the melody of a selkie attempting to be kind.
“He witnessed them pulling the body out from the alley, as Victor was shot. Nine times, with a semi-automatic. He saw his once best and frankly, only, friend being lifted away like he was little more than a sack of potatoes. Victor didn’t have many relatives to begin with, and none that were currently in the country. John, sentiment lead Sherlock to reveal himself, but it
Mycroft seemed to take the barest of breaths then, his hands tightening around the handle of his umbrella. When he spoke, it was as if he were purposefully trying to gentle the grisly demise of the victims for his brother’s sake. Sherlock could have snorted in derision, it wasn’t like he felt the least bit of remorse for anyone who had a hand in tormenting John.
And with those words Sherlock's eyes flick to the file again, hands twitching just slightly as he considered the information laid out before him. On the one hand, he was almost desperately curious about why his brother was so interested in John. After all, even though he was his flatmte Mycroft rarely showed so much distress over Sherlock's choices. Instead he often chose to Mother-Hen from afar, John being the first person Sherlock had ever seen actively become warned about.
Mycroft saw that, his head inclining further in interest. Where he was taught that sentiment was never an advantage from a young age, John seemed to be taught that above all, love came first.
John took in the dust-covered floor, his bare feet making imprints as if it were snow. He crept in slowly, half expecting to see some madwoman leap out from behind the wardrobe or some such thing. When no such thing happened, he entered with a little more confidence. John craned his head, searching instead for something, anything that could have made a melody.
Stars exploded behind Sherlock's eyelids as his skull cracked against the hardwood, bright fireworks that quickly cleared as he hissed breath through his teeth and tried to loosen the grip tightening inexorably about his windpipe.
He thought to himself that the world was actually going to hell when in response, Dodge merely laughed.
The pup felt he could not have made a better choice than in John. Surely, he had made a good decision. John was not wanted by his family, and Sherlock wanted John. It seemed simple, and simple was good. Simple meant even idiots like his brother could not find fault within the pup's actions.
Then Sherlock seized, spine arching as he let loose and strangled cry and very suddenly, it didn't matter. Nothing mattered at all. Nothing that is except the wail of sirens in the distance, and John's frantic attempts to get Sherlock to -
A Dragon at full speed could easily outpace the average car, and Sherlock cut a sand-blasted figure on the desert floor as he tore along the sand. Red droplets left a trail behind him for those to follow, but there was little he could do. His scales burned red with pain, and gold with determination. His wings acted as balance if he had to make a sudden turn, tail lashing out like a whip to keep him upright around tight bends. His eyes were slits against the sun. It was a race against his own body, and Sherlock had no choice but to press through it.
“She a cousin or something?” John asked, ignoring Sherlock's question in favour of getting answers to his own. Not that he was particularly desperate for the answer, more like curious. There were very few images of his
John gripped the door handle, opening the door and seeing at first, no one. He blinked at the empty air for a moment, brow furrowing in confusion.
John refused to be budged, blue eyes filling with tears even as he fought them, fought against the overwhelming feeling of panic. His mother carried on, oblivious to her children who hid just outside the hall.
Mycroft, feeling rather like he was suddenly caught between two snarling jackals looked from woman to woman, feeling Shyla’s pleading as well as his mother’s steady gaze. The unspoken demand of pick rang through him, and it was not a decision he could possibly prepare himself for. He had just gotten back from uni, and didn’t want to upset either of them.
When John woke it was to a throbbing headache that could only mean he had gone to bed crying. His mouth tasted like sandpaper, and his tongue felt heavy and slow. Groaning, he rubbed his face against silken sheets to banish away the griminess he felt, wondering at how quickly he was becoming used to waking to such a thing.
rimming his glasses, seeming for a second not to recognise him until all of a sudden his eyes widened and he tugged his friend inside by an iron-grip to his sleeve.
At least if John wanted to keep the integrity of his mind, not to mention his clothing (As Sherlock burned things with his breath when he was tetchy).
He lifted the weapon, eyes bright even as he took aim steadily. A part of John realised belatedly that time had slowed to him, seemed to narrow to a pinpoint. All he could see was the wild Gem throwing itself towards Sherlock as if in slow motion, the detective’s eyes closed to the onslaught, his violin crooked in his neck and the quivering emblem of his melody ringing in the air.
John murmured, rolling his eyes slightly when in response the Dragon made a small affirmative noise and continued to nose along his shoulder. The gesture was strangely intimate to John, and he found himself flushing harder than he should have been when he caught Mrs. Hudson's eye. Shaking himself out of his momentary
him. It's John's choice whether or not we stay and I could be wrong… but I think that’s none of your business.”
John had glowered up at the detective, but Sherlock couldn't help but chuckle. It was strangely endearing to him, how much John worried over his safety.
dear. Fancy seeing you here. Half expected you to weasel out of it.” Moriarty’s voice was a silky thing, laced with false pleasantry. But even as he spoke, his body shifted imperceptibly, guarding his food and blocking the human from Sherlock’s direct line of sight.
The rogue Gem let out a shriek of enraged agony, stopping its destruction to become a figure that clutched at its head like it was threatening to crack open. With a pause in its rampage John saw its gem- resting on its chest and glinting in a sickly kind of way.
They both knew it was a lie, still, John agreed. “Yeah, say hi to Clara for me!” He watched as his sister, all but bouncing up and down, chased after a head of dark brown curls and a face dusted with freckles. John hoped in that moment that their father didn't notice the way that his sister's eyes lit up when he saw a glimpse of Clara's tall frame.
Sherlock snorted quietly. “You know less than you think, human. You know nothing of my kind; your information is a millenia out of date. There was once a time we could move freely between our worlds, but then
“It’ll be… thorough. Mycroft doesn’t really do discretion when it comes to searching people… I understand if you’re uncomfortable exposing all of your personal information to me.” Sherlock might of carried on, but as he spoke John’s expression had grown incredulous, and the smaller man couldn’t help but laugh outright at the detective’s feeble attempts at allowing John privacy.
He hadn’t found anyone interesting in such a very long time, his romantic interests reduced to a grey area, a source of numbness like a severed limb after the wake of his injury. Part of it was due to the blow in his own self-confidence, a point Ella had been sure to underline and stress for him. Yet a larger part was that John had felt until this point that there had been no real reason to date, no point. He hadn’t planned exactly to have a future at all, and to find his heart racing unexpectedly in his chest, alight with reluctant fascination was at once welcome and somewhat irritating.
Nothing answered, and no prophecies or well-wishing glimpses of advice made themselves known as the Water-Spirit continued to stroke the human’s ear in bemusement.
At least today, it reared its head like a rather savage dog. It made his chest constrict painfully, and his lips tighten. beneath his fingertips, a storm tapped away. Light on his skin, turning harsh and violent as fingernails pushed down.
His upper torso bare, Hajera found her gaze drawn to the twisting mass of black and blue ink that seemed to be crawling along John’s arms and across his chest. It was a Bond Tattoo, but it was rare in that it was incomplete. It writhed with the pain of its host, snowflakes and mechanical gears, a flickering mirage that never lingered too long in one form. One second, it was a mountainous landscape, the next the rotting branches of a tree outstretched towards the sky. Back to snowflakes and maze-like designs, it shuddered sickly. Damaging it, John’s shoulder wound was a red maw, breaking up the design.
Sitting on the hardwood floor, the detective ran her fingers over the box’s surface, the name Sherlock temporarily falling to ash in her own mouth even as she opened the lid. It clicked softly, revealing its contents to be an eclectic collection of trappings. A woman’s razor sat bright pink upon folded layers of a soft black dress, flowy and long. It was covering a silk-soft leather jacket that Shyla knew would only reach her midriff, perfect for covering one’s shoulders but not shrouding her. They were familiar pieces of fabric, and she set them out with gentle reverence. Underneath them, a small black makeup bag sat innocently, its contents likely past its due date but functional enough for Shyla’s purposes. Gathering everything to her, the detective closed her eyes briefly, drawing into herself. Familiar self doubts crept in, familiar words from other people’s sharp-edged judgements briefly clouding her mind.
It was a clumsy, half-flailing thing, but he couldn't help but revel in the new form he was given by light of the full moon. His dark curls atop his head bounced, pale bare skin milky white and ghostly as he charged free from his brother's grip. Chastising calls snarled after him, but the pup ignored the adult's scolding in favour of getting the hang of his new limbs. He stared at them as he kicked the waves, clear droplets glittering on his bare skin. The other children watched him and did the same, chattering to each other in their clicking tongue and fingertips exploring the expanse of their own shoulders and arms.
hai! :D sorry this took a litte while.... but guess what? I have a beta now! Much thanks goes to her fantasticness, thanks Iolre! <3
that resounded had seemed to echo, along with the pulse in Sherlock's ears. His brother had stumbled back, but not enough. Never enough. A part of Sherlock would always know that his elder brother expected him to strike out, and would bemoan in private his own predictability.
Stitching up people in battle was nothing like trying to stitch up a cadaver or even a patient back home. John knew this, intellectually, but the first time he caused a man to scream as he held pieces of his guts inside of his own body still caused bile to rise in the back of his throat, sweat trickling down his spine. It was the crunching sensation as he bore down, and the taste of his own sweat beading atop his upper lip. Something about it mingled with the harsh cries around him, making his head threaten to spin.
And yet when John finally reached out with a hesitant hand to touch crest of Sherlock's curls, he shuddered. Because the rough pads of the soldier's hands made him want to simultaneously pull away with their lying tenderness and lean closer towards their touch. He trembled, pressing his face against his bent knees as he breathed slowly and allowed himself to shift to his fully Human form, letting the soldier past the final physical wall. John blinked in surprise as Sherlock's wings suddenly folded and
John also found quickly that the conversation lead to topics that he had trouble navigating safely. Attempting to find a line of speech they could both relate to, John shyly found himself glancing at the Queen’s scarred face- curious but unable to ask directly less it be seen as rude. After the fourth or fifth glance, Ryuk let out a soft rumble of amusement that sounded like marbles rolling on a wooden floor, and Rania poured more tea smoothly even as she told John
Live a happy and fulfilled existence while pretending that his condition didn't exist. Because John didn't want to give the Others a chance at taking him over, of gaining permanent control. Even though sometimes he suspected that's what would happen in the end. Yet none had come to him in quite awhile, and John sometimes wondered if they were waiting for him to do something. To initiate at just the right moment and spring on him when he least expected it. So he bought his time even while smiling, only becoming slightly distressed when he found out that Sherlock had used up all of the groceries for experiments, even his favourite strawberry jam.
She and Mike did not speak of it, but she knew he felt it too, sometimes. The first month was turning out to be a hard one, and neither of them quite knew what to do. For Mike, there was counselling, and there were treatment centres. Yet Dragons did not have much by the way of mental health professionals, and the ones that were available were not affordable on army pensions.
Tilting his head back over the bucket John used, the Dragon hummed in quiet pleasure. The ex-army doctor couldn’t help but smile, as even for the duration of his cleaning Xavi had refused to let go of his egg. It was clutched to his chest, and he ran tender fingers over it now and again even as from under fanned lashes he took in what would be his home for the foreseeable future. The shed wasn’t much- an old weapons storage unit, now filled with soft straw that would normally be used to trade with the people in nearby villages. It was no larger than a small classroom truthfully, and Xavi’s collar had been chained to metal loops that normally would have picketed horses. The length of it meant he could walk the perimeter of his holding cell, but that he could not go far outside. This didn’t seem to particularly bother the optimistic creature, and he hummed joyfully as John rinsed soap from his hair with gentle precision.
Sherlock, voice agitated once again reiterated the fact that he didn’t know the code. Despite the other Gem’s skepticism, John could hear the honesty in the detective’s voice. It frightened him, because the Gem pressing a weapon to his skull didn’t seem to care and didn’t trust Irene enough to glean the numbers from her. His heart began to pound, and in the back of his mind John caught glimpses of sand-blasted deserts and blood and gunfire. He didn’t think Sherlock had ever seen someone die of a headshot before. A part of John prayed that now wouldn’t be the time that the detective discovered just how brutal they could be.
Fear, pain and shock can do strange things to a person. That was what John's parents were told when the doctor came to see them and tell them about their son's condition. Dr Finnegan was an elderly man, and his Irish brogue was carefully differential even as he held up the clipboard in his hands and explained to them why John had to be sedated.
if you can’t… but.” She looked earnestly up at Xavi, her expression apologetic. “I keep imagining horrible things happening to the soldiers captured, to my squadron. I don’t know what the
The mortal felt small in his arms, almost tiny. Though he had looked fierce enough even when chained and bound down below, now Sherlock could see that he had essentially been bound to a child, a boy. The shocking youth of his features looked up at him, as in unconsciousness the Spirit held him and used the edge of the ghastly bridal robe to smear away the paint that had covered him. Streaks of riotous red and blue came way, shimmering silver lining it. To Sherlock, it felt like clay between his fingers, ruddy and faintly oiled.
to the detective's recent knowledge of John's condition. He was still half-crouched before him, and from the looks of it, Sherlock had no plans of moving out of John's line of sight any time soon.
“Good, that’s a good start. I think you’ll get through at least the party if you’re already got being intimidating enough down.”
Nothing like this ever happened in the ocean, and that made Sherlock want to all but vibrate out of his skin.
Sherlock gripped the stone basin, sinking to his knees. One hand came to tear through his hair, scarcely unable to contain another cry of fury. He curled up against the fountain, strangely childlike as he pressed his forehead to his knees. Memories consumed him, dark and terrible and edged with pain. Seeing Moran had brought them to the surface, tearing into him more effectively than any teeth could.
Hajera couldn’t seem to tear her gaze away from John’s shoulder, still a horrific scene despite all that these strangers were doing for him to limit the carnage. She wondered if a Bond could be dealt a blow by physical wounds. Certainly, the Magic that twisted over John’s body seemed to be in distress.
He trailed off, hands clenching and unclenching uselessly at his sides. He didn't want to say it. A part of him didn't want to know the answer. However John was nothing if not stubborn. Clenching his jaw, his posture was military-straight as he dared to ask.
It was at that point that John's mother took his grandmother by the arm, and firmly instructed that the faerie tales before bedtime were to come to an end.
in the first place, and Sherlock found a frown tugging his features even as he continued to sing. Nervously, the Selkie glanced about the length of the beach. No other Humans were around... but this was taking too long. Too much work, too suspicious. If someone came...
For one, Molly soon found herself rapidly unsure of where she stood in her new Master's presence. Mike was... different than the Humans she had encountered before. Kinder. He didn't shout at her when she accidentally dropped his favourite mug while trying to make him a cuppa in the morning, nor did he order her around as much as other Masters had. In fact, Molly had found her usually tightly-strung nerves being soothed by the husky but gentle face that would smile at her approvingly when she did something right, which admittedly wasn't all that often. Though she admittedly didn't understand much of Human-Speak, she did know when orders were harsh or cruel, and Mike's tone was never either of those. In fact he was soft.... hesitant almost, and almost reminded her of a Hatchling attempting to be a full-grown adult, all awkward limbs and overly-false confidence. He blushed beet-red when she called him “Master” and stuttered when she had asked him in confused and broken English why she hadn't been hit for failing to prepare him his evening meal. Molly hadn't understood what he said when he placed his hands on her shoulders and looked into her eyes, but if she had, she might have cried.
No one expected it when the bowl of water started to glow. A white-bright light that streamed from the priest's fingers and cast out the darkness just as a terrible strike of lightning illuminated the Water-Spirit's statue so that his eyes seemed to pierce the night.
The slow drag of footsteps across desert sand was a harsh rhythm, set in the dead of night when the air was frigid and the sky held only the thin suggestion of a moon. The darkness was nearly total, save for a lantern held at the front. It glinted off of the chains that cuffed sweat-slick necks and wrists, made fear-wide eyes seem wild and prey-like.
There wasn’t much one could do to defend themselves from these monsters, as their powers made them smoke-like, able to walk through even the thickest of walls in order to feed off of humanity. They didn’t kill, not like the first wave, but they left behind scarring that lingered for far longer. Sure, the Fae offered wards, small tokens of charms that would discourage them, but as John leant against his post he very much doubted that the Ash sprig in his breast pocket was going to defend him much.
“Should I even ask?” John wondered aloud wryly, lying down and staring at the ceiling even as sweat began to collect and pool in the small of his back. In response his partner grunted something unintelligible, frowning at the lumped pile of blanket and army doctor before him. His hands rested on his hips as if in deep thought, and those irises glittered with speculation. Then, snarling curses, the dragon stalked out of the room, feet stomping even as he shouted something along the lines of
but the sex was definitely lovely. His husband paid even closer attention than he usually did, focusing in on John and only John until the poor man was writhing and begging, pinned under Sherlock's superior strength. Only when his partner was completely strung out, all but unintelligible, did Sherlock allow John to let go.
He shoots back, but there is no real bite to the question. Just more of a certainty that Sherlock would probably lie for his own benefit as well.
“Change of plans.” The darkly-curled teen lied smoothly, blue eyes flicking to his hands even as he did up the buttons of his shirt from the bottom-up. Sherlock's words were partially true at least, Sebastian had met up with him in that library for the first time only a month or so before, and he had run out of the second batch of drug he had gotten as of three days ago. For three days he had debated with himself, fighting over whether or not he should meet up with the shark-smile man. Yet finally, the calling had made him give in.
“Then you will be the first to die, John Watson, and no amount of training or rules will help you,” she interrupted, focusing on John with a piercing stare. Her eyes seemed to hold in them a certainty that made the young soldier's stomach twist in discomfort, and though he tried, he could not maintain his fury. It extinguished into a sick kind of foreboding, and without thinking John's fingers traced the sleeve that hid the curling tattoo on his arm. Sherlock's defensive posture remained unchanged, but his tail stiffened, ceasing its restless thrashing. The Dragon's eyes were narrowed in calculation, and he seemed to be mentally taking Dodge apart piece by piece.
Daniel paused, face half-turned towards the detective. His blue eyes were lowered to stare at his hands, which were clenched tightly at his sides. His jaw was a hard line of tension as he spoke.
Sherlock had to find John; that was all that mattered right now. John Watson was definitely in danger, and he could not waste time being injured or wanting to pass out. Bill was most definitely trying to give chase, too. Either way, to give up meant certain death, and Sherlock was nothing if not a survivor.
More than that, when he closed his eyes, his husband reached out tentatively, long fingers winding themselves from their death-grip on their egg to run through John's short hair. The sensation was soothing, pleasant. Comforting.
He tried to pretend the sound that came out of him was a bitter chuckle instead of a harsh and muffled scream.
Dragon soared upwards, passing John in a rush of air that took the man's breath away both figuratively and literally, and
Warm hands were pressed to him, supporting his weight. A Scottish brogue murmured in his ear encouragingly, mopping Sherlock’s soaking wet curls back from his forehead. When there was nothing left to throw up, the detective gasped for air. he flopped like a wet fish onto his side, blue eyes blurrily blinking past his own tears and chlorine, his heart thundering in his chest like a quick march.
But the illusion his family had wanted, the picture of the little girl in soft lace and skirts, that had never been him.
that Molly would no longer be destructive. He needed to make sure Mrs. Hudson was okay, and that life at
“You tell John. If you can't trust us, you tell him your own hurts. How you came to be like you are. You may not have split personalities, Holmes, but you have masks. And John wants to see under them, but you need to let him know that you're okay with it, otherwise he won't pry.”
Sherlock realized with a frown that he was getting distracted. He pushed those irritating thoughts out of his head.
so you guys have probably noticed I'm doing the Alter's stories in chunks, and a bit out of order. this is completely intentional. (As in, claude's story will be continued upon as time goes on)
He was surprised when the army doctor didn't seem to mind his meltdown, not touching but not quite moving out of his line of sight. Sherlock found himself staring into those blue eyes, catching his breath, arms automatically curled about his chest as an unexpected wave of self-loathing washed over him, sharp and visceral. He had the sudden and fierce need to hide, because under his own hands his hips did not feel right, and there was a startling empty feeling that gutted him between his legs. The shadowy feeling engulfed him, and he didn't know why, but he was trembling, and biting the inside of his cheek because all he could think about his how
Right before he passes out that second heartbeat seems to surge, and John realizes that again he is going to turn. Again he will become one of his Others, and in a crowded place filled with people.
, trying to recall what it said to do in extremely tactile situations. He guessed it had something to do with avoiding having his throat ripped out, as it was at the forefront of his mind even as he could feel himself being slowly dragged over towards the little nest of couch and blankets and clothes Sherlock had made for himself using John's wardrobe.
The smaller Dragon's figure had drastically changed. For one, his skin was no longer the golden tone it had once been. Now it was tinged a deep jade green in places, smooth scales running up his arms and legs and creating swirling, delicate designs on his cheeks and chin. More fragile than Sherlock's, but sleeker, like the belly of a snake. Like war-paint, it enhanced the darkness of his eyes as it curled in decorative whorls about his skin. His horns differed from Sherlock's the way that a deer's might from a bull's, daintier yet rapier-sharp, with the potential to be lethal if correctly used. They glinted wickedly under the lights of the living room. The Dragon did not have wings; rather, Cerioth floated as if suspended in mid-air, steam curling from his parted lips as he let loose a low warning growl towards Sherlock's hunched figure. The tea set lay broken on the floor, hot tea creating a molten divide, the moat that separated both parties. Dodge had her gun out, though thankfully with the safety still on, her figure tense and her gaze professional as she assessed the situation. Unlike John, who was upside down and crushed by Sherlock's tail, which curled around him possessively.
Standing, he discovered he was better at walking already than the others. He would never tell them it was because he snuck away sometimes from the rookery and
Sneak slowly looked up at his reflection, a curling smile twisting upwards on his face as he smirked at the simple clothes he wore. He looked about the toilet with interest for a moment, a low whistle coming from his parted lips as he took in the polished handles of the sink. A critical eye swiped over his hands and pockets, taking into account the fact that he had a wallet this time around and that there was more than one exit from the bathroom. A pink scrap of tongue peeked out from his upper lip, and a slightly Irish accent rumbled easily from John’s chest.
without further hiccups. At least until the detective went back to wearing solely male attire, and resumed his crackling deductions.
Instead of laughing like Sherlock had privately hoped John would, his friend's frown seemed to grow, and his voice lowered in what was dangerously close to sadness even as Sherlock made room for the stubborn man on the couch. John sat next to his friend without hesitation, gaze steady whereas Sherlock's had a tendency to flick back and forth between his hands, John's face, John's neck, and away.
And yet he still found himself all but screaming at Sherlock, desperately trying to break past the Dragon's chaos of emotions to get him to see reason. The normal, easy way in which John's brain normally could permeate into Sherlock's thoughts was now tangled and snarled by emotions, the signal malfunctioning even as the soldier tried to stop his friend from going into kill mode. His thoughts projected desperately, shouting at the Dragon as if raising his voice could somehow break through the creature's haze.
Again the phone buzzes. This time Daniel feels something almost akin to nausea as John fights against him, the roiling in his stomach unpleasant and painful. He feels a sheen of sweat begin to bead his brow as he reads the text, gritting his teeth against the temptation to go to sleep.
He trails off, blonde eyebrows lowering as he realizes that his answer can't possibly be correct. Sherlock has seen that expression before, but not quite so obvious on someone's face. John's features are extremely expressive, which
From Grandma, that was not a compliment to be taken lightly. John flushed, grinning before trying to tug the woman's hand excitedly towards the rest of the family. The other Watsons were far calmer upon exiting the car. Harry yawned sleepily as she leaned against the boot, her diary in hand as she checked in vain for the pens she had brought with her on the trip. She scowled when she found none. John's parents both were stretching the stiffness out of their limbs, his dad already going towards the boot of the car to search for their bags. John's mother looked towards Grandma fondly, a small smile on her lips as she came forward and gave her own Mum a brief but meaningful hug.
To the rest of my readers, Uni has kicked my ass and given me little time to write. Forgive me. To make up for it, here's a chapter.
Being shot hurt more than Sherlock would have guessed, admittedly. In past experiments (all theoretical of course) he had imagined it would be an intense, but localised sort of pain. He hadn’t accounted for the way the human body often dealt with injury by radiating agony throughout the person’s very bones. He also hadn’t accounted for a bullet wound to be so close to his lungs.
Close by, his arms crossed and leaning against the pole that waved the British flag, a solitary figure stood watching. Bill, his expression unreadable. He produced a cigarette from his pocket, brought it to his lips and set it alight to a blazing burning ember.
In the end, classical had been more of a default option to fall back on, but it seemed he struck lucky. John could see even though the Dragon was by no means relaxed about him, that some of the all-consuming tension that had wired his every move the night before had gone slack. Half-crouched on the floor, Sherlock's tail swished lightly to the tune, his mind imagining deft fingers plucking away at instruments he had only ever dreamed before of hearing.
“That it was a member of the rebellion, self-ignition, and that it resulted in far too many casualties than I’m comfortable with.”
But the detective's gaze kept flicking minutely behind John's figure, and the army doctor took only a moment to understanding.
Mycroft was careful to reply. He did not mention to Sherlock how in that moment, there was a sliver of humanity in those blue eyes, something that had been lost for many a millenia.
“Middle-class, these guys are. You should see the royalty here, it's ridiculous. They collar their Dragons in solid gold, and are right jerks that refuse to speak English to us even though they could.”
The Dragon severed the memory with a sharp shake of his head, forcefully wrenching himself away from John’s subconscious. It was more effort than it should have been, and it left Sherlock feeling drained and strangely hollow.
“Take Soo Lin. We'll swap Dragons for a bit so I can check out Sherlock's heart and his fluid intake to make sure it hasn't been strained with the heat, and you can have an assistant that knows where everything is.”
families before. The children had always looked at him with a complicated mix of mistrust and fascination, and he had reciprocated the stares more often than not with a glower of his own.
The case took on the macabre name due to the amount of media attention it received, and Sherlock took to the newfound fame of his name and his career like a martyr facing the pyre. He argued with John good-naturedly about the poor storytelling of his blog, even while reading avidly each time a new article was posted. Of course, John wasn’t meant to see the detective read them, but the army doctor was nothing if not sly and Sherlock only hid in his own room on the rarest of occasions. Life at
If John concentrated, he found that there was a disconcerting lurch in the back of his mind. Images that he knew did not come from his own mind drifted before his eyes, pictures and vague ideas of places he had never seen.
A muffled curse, the sound of someone stubbing their toe on the door out of the room, Lestrade caught the end of a blue silk robe before it disappeared abruptly. Sherlock’s voice was gruff, calculatingly dismissive. Lestrade did not buy it for an instant.
HOW CAN YOU THINK SO LITTLE OF YOURSELF THAT YOU THINK YOU ARE NOT WORTH WHAT LITTLE PROTECTION I CAN GIVE TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT I
Silence. Someone speaking on the other line. Sherlock listens and thinks he hears a vaguely Welsh accent. He frowns slightly.
The sting, the swelling flow of the blood, was enough to ground him for a moment, leave him gasping and shockingly in the present. The scattered tendrils of his mind slowly curled inwards, drawing together to form coherent thought in order to inform his body that he was in pain.
Frowning, the detective wasted no time in making his way inside the flat, long coat swirling behind him like a shadow as he stepped into the warmth of
Instead, he reached over to adjust the Dragon's scarf more tightly about the pale column of his throat, and didn't protest when Sherlock let out a sharp breath through his nose and leaned minutely into his side.
Greg was not what Mycroft expected. Though what he expected exactly, the prince honestly couldn’t say. Perhaps someone rude? High-and mighty? Or perhaps just simply uninterested in the likes of someone younger than themselves. Instead he found a Dragon that was more down to earth than anything else. Despite clear signs of his upbringing, Greg was straightforward, quick to laugh and smile, and what was more a good listener. He introduced Mycroft to the gathering of children as if he’d known him their entire lives.
Sherlock didn't like seeing John cry. There was something inherently wrong about it. Partly because the tears John was now desperately trying to keep from shedding were not the tears of a grown man. They were the open sobs of a child trying to control themselves and failing, and though the detective claimed
Sherlock’s skin didn’t tan, but it was prone to burning if he forgot to apply sunscreen and make an effort to take a break during the hottest parts of the day. The Dragon’s scales could be used as an offering of shade if he was desperate, the sail-like membranes tougher than mere skin. It was so warm, that John often didn’t even realise that back in London fall was fast approaching, the shedding of trees sending small children so very far away outside, running to make leaf piles. Dragon and soldier alike began becoming used to the desert and its harsh beauty, and with that ease John forgot steadily about his home, finding a better grounding in Sherlock’s quiet presence. He instead found familiarity in cold, austere nights under a star-filled sky.
Sherlock had also on an unrelated note, become more comfortable arguing with John. He also felt more at ease to joke around, and play pranks – albeit in his unique, Dragon-like fashion - such as leaving experiments in the teapot to find, or coating the floor in a thin, clear layer of ice to have John slip on for later.
Ryuk slithered down from her neck then, curling in her lap before peering up at John. The Queen’s hands stroked his flanks lightly, and her voice took on a mildly softer edge as she looked to the soldier before her, dressed as a servant.
He might have been more worried, had he been a little bit older and a little less captivated by the various treasures his grandmother had been saving for his arrival. Her gnarled fingers frequently held out to him all sorts of little shiny things a boy his age delighted in, everything from crab shells to smooth pieces of sea glass worn by the waves they once swam in.
His sister appeared to have stopped breathing, curled as she was in the wide back of the family’s armchair. She fixed Mycroft suddenly with a piercing, hungry gaze, disbelief and impossible desperation suddenly flitting over her features. Shyla quickly smoothed over that impulse, but her hand was clearly shown before she could manage it. Still, she kept a deliberately detached tone to her voice.
The other personality hummed dragging his teeth across his bottom lip once before sitting up slightly. On his face was an amused smirk, one that Sherlock found reminded him rather uncomfortably of sharp glass and gravel roads. He noted somewhat absently that his eyes kept going back to the outline of muscle along John's abdomen that wasn’t' usually highlighted by his choice of clothes. Sherlock scowled, firmly dragging his gaze back towards his
eyes became rounded and Human. Right before John's eyes, he found himself staring at a man, half-starved and skinny but very much
as he looked up at John, pleading at him to quietly accept his candour, to not break what little trust still held between them, however tenuous. John, to his credit believed him. He could always read Sherlock's honesty, at least when it came to issues concerning the detective himself. Little things, John might not notice (the drugging of certain mugs of coffee for instance) but for serious things, things that were life or death... John had learned to read people, and in that moment, he saw honesty swimming in those pale irises.
very much, and I will not bend to your rules just because you’re not used to someone telling you no.”
At this, Sherlock froze. He had been under the impression that the majority of the compound had been captured, imprisoned. The Dragon had compartmentalized the emotions that wanted to surge from within at the thought of what the
The increasing distress on Sherlock’s face was too much for John. Sitting up in the bed, he made himself stand, ignoring the dizzying feeling of freefall even as he righted himself and stepped towards the detective. Sherlock, still pacing, barely seemed to notice until the army doctor was standing before him, his words abruptly dying off as he turned to find John facing him down. Sherlock in that moment had the glint of mania in his eyes that spoke to him and spelled out trouble. It was the same expression John had seen in a few of his caretakers in the past, had seen in lovers that had lasted longer than the norm or old friends. This- all of this, was strange and didn’t make any sort of sense, but John knew the deer-in-the-headlights expression before him, and knew it well. It was the kind of look that made a protective current surge through his veins, as it was plastered on the normally stoic detective’s features. It was without thought that John stepped forward, crowding into Sherlock’s space. Blue eyes, burning dark and cobalt peered up at the detective, and though John was the shorter of the two Sherlock felt unaccountably small as his friend reached upwards, cupping the back of the detective’s pale neck. John’s fingers were short, trimmed and compact, warm. They gently pulled Sherlock’s face down enough so that the ex-army doctor could look into his eyes.
John pressed a kiss to his husband’s neck, hug tightening about his shoulders. His voice was calm and firm.
John was slightly more tense than before, but he drummed his hand against the armrest of his chair and answered tersely.
and still he leaned forward, greedily accepting the touch. Craving it. He hated the way his skin pressed against John's. Loved it more than anything else. The strange scent that was the army doctor- a unique and interesting blend of gun-oil, tea and shampoo- filled the detective's lungs. He inhaled for more, paralysed. Yet desperate to move away. For John was saying this, murmuring things, and his words sent a sharp pain of something
for it.” The last part was said with an edge of pleading, so uncommon in Mycroft’s voice what Sherlock had to shut his eyes, his head jerking his chin away from his brother’s direction as if bracing himself for an invisible blow.
“You seem to have stopped struggling. Is it possible that you’re perhaps not as eager to escape as you once were? Shame on you,
“Oh great Spirit who guards our walls, who protects Recheinbach and never lets it crumble, we thank you tonight for your patience. For your yearly relief from our drought. Our thirst. In honour of you tonight oh lonely God, we ask of you to accept the only thing we can offer you: A bride.”
“Do as you like, then. For the rest of the villagers, we’ll take them to the infirmary and kitchens. The children amongst them look hungry, and I could do with a meal myself.”
John notes the way the man before him is seated, hoping to glean some kind of information as to where he might have seen him before. What he sees is an odd countenance. The man doesn't look like a soldier, but then again he doesn't really look like a scientist either, despite the fact that he's bent over a microscope. John's medical degree puts him around his thirties, the younger end of it. That makes it unlikely that he knew him in military service. Not to mention the paper-white pallor. Almost translucent under the sick medical lights. High and hollow-looking cheekbones held pale eyes of ever-shifting colour, unblinking in nature as they glanced over at him.
“Mummy?” He inquired politely, only to have Mycroft answer with a facetious smile that did not reach his eyes.
Sherlock couldn’t help but give a small sigh of relief before he analyzed again, taking in the stiff annoyance lining the ex-army doctor’s lips. He frowned in confusion.
Sherlock murmured, yet the clench of his jaw implied that a hundred other meanings lay underneath the rather archaic greeting. John frowned as he saw how shifty the detective suddenly seemed. Sherlock was eyeing escape routes as if he were a dog cornered, and John got the impression that there was an entire conversation being left unsaid between the two brothers. It crackled instead in the air, a living and breathing thing.
. They were fairly decent people, from what I can remember of them anyway. Once a kid in Care reaches a certain age, people don't tend to adopt them as much. This couple specifically chose older kids, partly because the Mrs had a bad hip. They were warm people, good people...”
“You’re a liar,” John murmured, though he wasn’t entirely certain how much he believed that. There was an aura of blunt honesty about Sherlock - for a Demon at least. John couldn’t see much past the cloak that was the creature’s wings, but from this close he could see that the Incubus was unnaturally handsome like most of his kind. The difference however was in the
When he finally found the key in his shirt pocket and fumbled the lock open he paused, turning to look one last time at the beast curled underneath the bare bulb of light hanging from the ceiling. Like this, the creature looked somehow just a little smaller, a little less threatening. It whimpered softly in its sleep as if in pain, and John was nearly overwhelmed with how he could sense a quiet sort of sentience within it, past the animal rage he had witnessed. Softly, he closed the door behind him and turned the lock, the sound making the quietest of clicks before he tucked the key back into his pocket. Then, still leaning against the door, his legs gave out on him. He slid to the floor, silent sobs racking his body as he cried over the shreds of his sanity.
to rearrange themselves to at least appear normal and uniform, even if underneath Sherlock and John were anything but.
The ex-army doctor found his irritated amusement fading into true worry as Sherlock looked at him, for a moment more animal than man. Sherlock did not often looked this... rattled. It was an expression that normally only came in times of great danger, desperation or need.
John jumped as the baritone suddenly sang, words rolling and menacing in the dark. Rich like the promise of cumulus clouds on the edge of the wharf. Sherlock's expression was murderous as he pressed the bow of his lips against the scar and rumbled threateningly,
Daniel caught himself hoping that perhaps, just perhaps, the man downstairs could show John even a glimpse of the purpose he had given up on so long ago.
“Well this is a fair change.” Dodge commented wryly as she stood over the Dragon crouching before her, seemingly impressed by his stillness and good behaviour.
thanks for all the lovely comments and kudos while I was gone! I love London so far, and I'm so happy to get back to writing! :D
In the quest to get the gender that Sherlock most often recognised in themselves noticed, they had traded their freedom to be female. Though it didn’t seem to bother Shyla much (As it was as far as John could tell normally only for a day or two with long gaps between when she felt female) it bothered
The way the compound fought was the squadrons worked together, the medics spreading out to aid all people on the compound.
“Let him go, and I'll show you. Tell you.” A siren whispering their own demise. John struggled anew, a desperate snarl leaving his lips. And the detective's voice cracked (and that had to be on purpose, that
A power game then. It sort of figured, given the nature of the Woman’s profession. John ran his tongue over his teeth, considering the angles of the case. Irene’s position made sense, but it did not change the fact that she held extremely delicate information. He sensed Sherlock’s glance, and excused himself quietly once more, claiming to be searching for the loo. Irene barely glanced at him, her gaze merely locked on Sherlock. John felt an inordinate amount of satisfaction in his role of the plan.
He forced himself up and out of his chair, determined to do something to take his mind off of Sherlock. He would go outside, go for a walk, or even a run (he hadn’t done that since his army days, and in truth the idea of sweating his frustrations out a little appealed to him just then). John nodded to himself, determination renewed. A nice, long jog in Regent’s Park was what he needed, to clear his mind and to make him more himself and less of
Claude blurted out in glee and amazement, clapping slightly as she bit down on her thumb-nail to keep from babbling in excitement. She was always told she talked too much, and she didn't want to annoy Mr. Holmes. Not when he was being so wonderfully entertaining. Conrad might scold her later, but it was worth it. Against her finger, her words came out slightly muffled.
“Downstairs. There are places we can sit.” Sherlock murmured, looking towards John. He forced himself to keep his head held high, though his expression was soft when he saw the worry etched into his companion’s features. “John. Go take a shower. I’ll explain to Lestrade.” His voice bartered no availability for an argument.
Without realising it, John’s eyes closed only to refuse to reopen. The soldier’s posture had been slouching already, but it became further slackened, his knees giving way. John slid down the post, a snore already leaving his lips even as he curled much like a child into himself.
“I didn’t,” Mycroft scowled “Three days before you would receive that package, I would find the tome missing from my personal collection. I haven’t the faintest idea who sent it to you, or how they could know you’d need it. It’s quite irritating, actually.” He said the last part almost to himself, seeming vexed. “I dislike not knowing things.” John could tell he was telling the truth, somehow. There was something about the man’s face that, despite his coolness, he found he could see through.
She snapped sharply, Cerioth within a second morphing into his true form, coiling about her protectively. Steam hissed out from between the Dragon's open maw, and Molly if possible shrank more deeply into Mike's side. Sherlock appeared stoic and unimpressed as usual. John wondered though at the brief spark of colour he felt pass between their Bond when the creature's eyes met Sherlock's, challenging his stare.
And he'd push through it. Suffer through the ache, persevere through every longing craving for even just a bite of food, if it meant in the end he didn't hate himself quite so much in the mirror. It was not good, and he knew that. This, this could
One thing Sherlock knew for certain at least, was that there was no way John would ever be able to keep a secret from him. He chuckles to himself once at even the idea, and then his mind flits back to the case at hand.
“I told you to come if Sherlock was doing something concerning, what you, John or any of his other personalities do when outside of my brother's watch is of no concern-”
Still, he had been sure to make his displeasure at such a decision by huffing, a bit of whispered magic at the right time turning John's shower
Skeletal fingers wrapped around tan. John's palm was warm, but Sneak's finger-tips were cold. They fluttered against his knuckles before releasing their grip.
