John looked around surprised to see a normal looking house on the outskirts of town. The slaves were guided into the house. He couldn’t wrap his mind around what was happening. They should have been driven to the arena.
“Now what?” she asked “if nothing else happens they will both recover with no ill effects. Who do we say I was called to attend upon?”
His breathing was ragged, Caesar turned to Mycroft “Go with him, I will give you my seal that any you claim from the pit shall go with this man to save the life of a loyal Centurion. Never let it be said that I will turn away those that are loyal to me.” he looked pointedly at Mycroft “Any that are taken from the pit shall be turned over to this man, to assist in saving his son.”
“what?” she looked at him skeptically, he stalked across his room and grabbed his notes waving them at her.
The celebration was also perfect, the guests offered prayers, and blessings. There was food, wine,  dancing and entertainment for all. It was a holiday for all but the most essential workers.  Sherlock spent the entire celebration trying to figure out why he was relieved that she was pleased with him, why did it matter to him what she thought? It wasn't as if he planned on really living with her. He studied her briefly out of the corner of his eye while someone spoke a toast. He felt her smack his leg with her fork, and noticed that the toast was complete, he lifted his glass an drank on command. How had she noticed that he wasn't paying attention to the words? He had never seen her even look at him.
Late that evening, she was laying out supplies in the apothecary, when she heard a frantic shouting at her front door. Throwing the door open she saw a Centurion and a women, holding a babe of only a few days, the woman was crying and the Centurion looked strained. “Please help us” the centurion begged standing at the door “my child, is dying and no one can tell us why, let alone save him”
“One of these men is a friend of mine, he killed a man to save my brother’s life, but he was sentenced to death. He is a skilled physician and a good man, but he is a Jew. If you save him, I will save your son” Mycroft spelled out carefully.
Molli looked at him stunned for a second, before beginning a flurry of activity, grabbing bottles off of the shelves “do you know what kind of poison was used?” she asked the young guard shook his head “how long ago was he dosed”
“she is with my wife and the empress, they are as safe as I can make them” he swears, guiding John toward his chamber.
As soon as Caesar was finished speaking he excused himself to seek out his brother, he would need to handle this carefully, but his brother needs to see that this union is beneficial to  him, not just to the family. He needed to really see that Mycroft was looking out for him, and his best interests, and that this unassuming girl was the best match that anyone could have found for him. She knew how to behave as a woman should, but was just as willing to throw that aside for her own passions. That this union would give Sherlock back his lover, was only a minor part of the equation,  though likely the one that would make Sherlock agree.
He closed the door to their suite of rooms. No sooner had the door clicked than she turned to him, the little mouse had turned into a lioness.
John submits to the other man, “what can your servant do for you?” he asks coyly his hand reaching for Mycroft's sash “would you have my body, my hand, or my mouth?” John's voice lowered with lust.
“At least my Alpha only leaves his socks and pants on the floor. A bit of perspective, that’s what you add to my life” the other man added “he likes it when I come home after talking to you, you know, I end up so grateful that he isn’t your Sherlock”
They left the festivities for the evening and retired to the rooms set aside for them, the celebration would continue for a week, without stop, as was proper.  She pinched his hip “smile to the crowd” she whispered out of the corner of her mouth, her own smile never faltering. He regarded her briefly, her hands were far stronger than he expected, they were also not as soft as he expected them to be. She smiled and waved to the assembly, the smile reached her eyes, but didn't light them. He was perplexed by the woman at his side, she was a puzzle, a mystery. Perhaps this would give him a few days of entertainment while he tried to puzzle her out.
“Mater Juno is a Goddess these were Jewish women of no consequence; none were even born of citizens of the empire. They weren’t important, to anyone” Mycroft’s frustration was starting to show through as he spoke. He sighed dejectedly “Even if I agree with what John did, even if Caesar agreed with what John did,” his eyebrow rose enough to still his brother’s tongue “even IF Caesar did agree with John killing a Roman citizen to protect the daughters of his kinsmen, there would still be nothing he could do. There have been too many mad Emperors, even in our lifetimes. Caesar is still establishing his hold on the empire, without history poisoning his reign, and” he gave Sherlock a pointed look as he continued his explanation “And, Sherlock, allowing a Jewish man to kill Roman citizens, would not sit well with the nobility”
“Of course” said Anthea “you would need a couple slaves to attend you this evening, I will send for yours as they assuradly know your tastes better than any we could provide?” her voice even as she reached for the girl’s arm not giving her a chance to read the scroll in her hands. As they walked arm-in-arm to the room they had shared the morning before, she dispatched a runner to summon a male and female slave from her house.
“Exactly Sherlock ‘women’, if they were wives or daughters of important families their men could have protected John, but they weren’t Sherlock.”
Molli stood at the threshold of her house and offered a silent prayer of thanks and protection, for those that were within. John opened the door smiling at her, as he wiped his hands on a rag. “The little one is sleeping, I just finished his blood treatment. If God is willing, this should be his last. I just sent the old man off with his tincture, and the girl with the spider bite is resting. Everyone here is doing well and we even got to bed at a decent hour this morning.” John joked lightly. He had come far in the weeks that he had been in her household, he was much more relaxed and if it wasn’t as exciting as he wished for, it was still good work. He felt useful, and even needed Molli and her household were grateful for the extra help from a trained healer and he was learning new techniques, as well as teaching some. This was the first time Molli had ever worked with another healer that treated her as an equal, and even though he was a slave he was nothing less, in her house, than a partner in medicine.
Caesars face was hard to read, “bring Lord Mycroft he is being housed at the palace as we speak, and my wife, if I am to meet the gods this night those are the ones I want by my side.” He said
The guard let himself in to Caesar’s rooms through the servant’s halls, to avoid questioning eyes, his most loyal men following closely in his wake. Caesar woke and looked at him, betrayal written on his face “we have no time. My men are bringing your taster up now. He has been poisoned. Whom shall we bring to your side, my emperor?”
Molli paled at his voice “as my empress has said, so say I". he spoke from the bed. "Gifted healer” he spoke opening his eyes and looking straight as Molli “never fear speak truth to me, you have saved my life. All in this room have earned the right to speak freely to Me.” he intoned ritualistically
The man came in and threw himself prostrate on the ground before the two men “Mighty Caesar, who rules with the wisdom of the gods, I beg for my son’s life”
“Think, Sherlock” Mycroft said, exasperation getting the better of him “what household would I decide you could be happy in? what kind of woman would you imagine I would choose to be your bride?  Why would I allow, let alone ask Caesar to bind our family to
Lestrade looked at her as if he had no idea who she was, she looked back at him challengingly “What, I am an Omega, and a Woman, you think it hasn’t happened to me?” she asked
John climbed into the shower, he sighed “come here, please, I don’t want to be that far away from you right now.” Sherlock stripped his clothes and climbed in behind his lover. John leaned back into his arms letting Sherlock support his weight as he scrubbed every trace of the other Alpha from his body. There was no need to preserve evidence, as the man was dead. Sherlock took his own expensive body wash and cleaned John with it; the smaller man sighed and leaned against Sherlock. “Sometimes you know exactly what to do” he said resting his head against Sherlock’s shoulder, letting the smell of his Alpha wrap around him. “Come on, I want to be in my own bed, I should only have another day of this at most. I think I can handle it with some smaller toys and maybe your hands on me”
Mycroft laughed in relief, as Sherlock threw himself onto his brother knocking him to the floor under him. His lips connecting with his brother’s, in a searing kiss, everything that Sherlock could not trust himself to say whispered through his skin. “He lives” Mycroft replied exhaustion from the long night tugging at him. “Stand, Sherlock. We have much to do. We must give offering to the Pluto, Juno, Apollo, the Gentle One’s and The Fates in thanks for sparing his life.”
Molli waved them into the room and lay the swaddled child on a table. Looking at the babe she could instantly tell what was wrong. Bowing her head in silent plea, she pressed into the child’s skin and noticed the yellowing under her finger. “your child has the wasting disease” she reached out and took hold of the Centurion by the shoulder forcing him to face her, knowing what kind of infraction she was causing by speaking directly to a man, let alone touching a man without invitation “listen to me, and heed my words carefully, if you wish your child to live.” She handed him a strip of cloth, “find men and women, free or slave matters not, just find me four that when a drop of their blood is touched to the fabric, it turns orange. Not one man in a hundred will turn the fabric, so you must search but be clear on this, find them quickly; by morning your child will be dead, so waste not a second of time. If you cannot find four, find three, if you cannot find three find one. If the gods will it one will save your son tonight, two will save your child until Sun’s Birth and four or more, and if the Gods are kind, will save your child until manhood. Now make haste and find them” the Centurion’s eyes were dark in confusion.
The guard looked at the cooks and the pot slave “if the boy and Caesar both survive this, you will as well, but if either of them die I will assume that one of you had something to do with their condition and all three of you will die. So I suggest that all three of you do everything in your power to keep them alive” as he knelt next to the boy and propped his head, he tilted his flask to the boy’s mouth giving him a small sip of water, before wrapping him in a blanket and trying to make him comfortable.
“tonight there will be a banquet in honor of the new princess, you will be present and sit at the empress’s table, we will present you with your official gift there, now I believe that my wife and the lady Anthea, wish to assist you in preparing for the feast tonight.”
he paced frantically through to the room, ignoring everything in his way; furniture, slaves, guards, even his brother, nothing mattered. It was all inconvenient proof that he had been sold to a woman, by his brother and Caesar, for what reason, he couldn't explain.  Apparently they wanted him to settle down and become a good little citizen, marry for the good of the empire, and produce children to further his brother's political scheming.
Sherlock held john on his lap as he stroked him, John's arms wrapped around his neck. Kissing his Omega gently as he came for the third time. Sherlock held him tighter and let him come down from the orgasm. His own erection ignored in favor of his lover's needs, but it was beginning to become painful. “do you need another?” he asked the smaller man. John shook his head, Sherlock gently lifted him off of his lap. He stood to leave the room, to take care of himself as John's hand reached out and grabbed his arm.
John woke up with the worst hangover he had ever had, and something else, something was not right. He was naked and he wasn’t alone. He could smell an Alpha but it wasn’t Sherlock he tried to remember what had happened the night before when a hand reached over and took hold of his wrist. “awake are you?” the Alpha next to him purred “good, I have been waiting for someone just like you, you are gorgeous does your Alpha ever tell you that, because he should” the  Alpha reached around John and started stroking his cock, his traitorous body started to respond. “I could smell your heat starting last night. It has been so long since I spent a heat with an Omega. Don’t worry I will make this good for you.” The Alpha purred into John’s ear as he lined up his cock and drove it home. Still stroking John and driving him to orgasm as his tears fell. John couldn’t decide if he wanted Sherlock there to save him, or if he didn’t ever want Sherlock to know what was happening. He prayed that it would be over soon, but he knew that that wasn’t possible as the Alphas knot breached him he screamed as his orgasm crashed over him.
Sherlock was working alone in the lap when a masked man barged into the room and tried to strangle him. During the struggle the man lost his footing and slipped hitting his head hard against the counter and was killed instantly.
“His username doesn’t ring any bells. He had to be an inactive member, only reading posts without commenting.”
“The photos are not hidden in a locked room that would imply he lived alone and didn’t have many visitors, if any.”
It didn’t take them much time to reach the store and alarmingly it didn’t take Sherlock much time to pick up the lock.
“You think yourself very clever, don’t you?” Sherlock didn’t seem concerned with the gun pointed at his face.
. ‘His’ of course refers to you, the part guard is capitalized along with the letters A and G so it can be read as His Guard A.G, does that ring any bells?”
“Don’t be ridiculous Dr. Watson, I would never kill you despite you lack in judgment regarding boyfriends.”
“Another member sent him a message few days ago. He asked for a private meeting stating that they had an important thing to talk about regarding their idol. ”
John was hoping that his presence would have faltered Gerald’s plan but it apparently wasn’t the case.
“It’s been smelling weird for a few days.” Nicholas informed him, wrapping his hands around a cup of tea. “At first I thought a cat had crawled in and died, but with everything strange that’s been happening, I thought it might be a good idea to tell you.”
“It’s Greg.” he said indignantly, “Well, I’ve just been talking to a few of the Oliver boy’s teachers and friends. Apparently he was everyone’s favourite. Star student, theatre junkie, go-to friend. They’re all devastated. I didn’t find anybody who could possibly dislike him, let alone hate him enough to murder him.” He peered at Sherlock curiously. “Are you on a date?”
All three of them turned to John. “Er.” he said awkwardly, “I’m not sure I should intervene. It’s a family matter.”
The only way his theory would help the case would be if someone at Sherrinford had a bone to pick with Irene. Even then, why would this someone murder her stepbrother, when she clearly didn’t care about him? Who would go to such lengths to psychologically scar Yardley Oliver? All of Sherlock’s background research had revealed that the man had no enemies. And yet, such an intricately planned crime certainly couldn’t be a random one. Sherlock hated the feeling of grasping at straws, but he realized he was doing exactly that.
John peeked in, and as on every other morning, his hair was a perfect rat’s nest. He caught Sherlock looking and nervously tried to flatten it, and Sherlock was forcibly reminded of a conversation they’d had many mornings ago.
“Oh.” John sounded slightly crestfallen. “Well, it shouldn’t be too hard. She liked you even when you were a massive dick to her. Being nice now will only give you away.”
“Crime number two - victim: Upton Adams. A yellow 4 painted on the front door. Sister Bertha Adams died of a drug overdose. A week later, she visits Upton. Bertha was being blackmailed about her past, as was Mrs Hudson.”
“Right. I tried to get Adams to talk about the case, but - for god’s sake, John, be gentler with that ice pack! Are you trying to heal my face or bruise it further? - all he said was that he had already given his statement to the police. Told me that he’s had enough of dead sisters rising and is leaving for a monastery in Tibet tomorrow morning.”
Even as the first few vestiges of panic began to appear on Rachel’s face, John was already running full pelt back to the clearing. He could see Noel’s arms desperately flailing somewhere in the middle, and he quickly ripped off his jacket and shoes and dived in. The water was cold and his muscles seized a little as he swam furiously for the first time in months, but there was no time to process. He was right - the pond was deep, and also apparently a lot wider than it looked. As he finally reached Noel, just in time to grab his unconscious body, he could hear Rachel yelling from the edge.
“It still holds.” He moved up to kiss Sherlock’s cheekbones. “I’m not gay, I’m bi. Do your research.”
Seated in his armchair by the fire, John observed Sherlock at work now. He was sitting cross legged on the floor, in a sea of yellow-coded files and post-its. He looked up, caught John’s eye, and gave him a small smile. This was new - Sherlock being freer with his smiles and glances.
“I don’t think John even remembers it, and I just didn’t have the heart to tell you.” Lestrade scrutinized Sherlock carefully. “Look, I know you apparently don’t have a heart, but I can see it when it breaks for John Watson.”
“so what if she can ease the birth of a child, any woman could do that!” he spat “why does that mean that she is allowed to get in my way? You have children that are likely to reach adulthood. So why saddle me with a woman to try to appease, before i am allowed to carry on my work?” Mycroft was becoming rather amused at his brother's ravings, rather than the normal exasperation. That fact caused Sherlock to stop and consider that his brother had information he was withholding. Sherlock knew that there was no way his brother would change his mind, when he saw the look in his eyes that reminded him of his childhood, when Mycroft would catch him doing something he thought clever but the older boy knew to be a childish ploy. He would just have to figure a way to deal with this farce, he wouldn't even need to speak with the woman if he made her, with child quickly, and it wasn't as if he would be forbidden anything. He would just need to establish the order of the household as soon as they were wed.  which from the speech Caesar had issued was to be very soon. He needed to think of what he would tell her, and what he would, graciously allow her, in order to keep her out of his way. Of course he would allow her to continue as a midwife. perhaps that would keep her busy,  or at least out of his hair long enough to get real work done, she may even have access to herbs that could prove useful. Best not get his hopes up too high, he thought, she likely wasn't useful for much.
Molli was shown into Caesar’s side room, as opposed to the main throne room. Caesar and Mycroft were sitting together in the middle of the room, huddled over a pile of papers, a scribe at Caesar’s elbow. Molli took note of the large map table in the corner of the room farthest from her. The empress and the new princess were sitting with Anthea in a small alcove closest to the door. The food taster was staring at Molli with frank admiration, from his perch next to the table. Molli watched him concerned by the pallor of his skin and slight sheen of sweat on his brow. Noting that Caesar looked similarly disturbed, Molli frowned harder, much to the men’s amusement.
“But I was complaining about you to him, and the things you do that frustrate me. he must have taken that as…”
Lord Mycroft looked at Caesar and turned to the young guard “go quickly to this house, there is a healer that is said to be born of Apollo himself, if anyone can save the emperor, it would be her. Move swiftly” he said handing the man a scrap of parchment
“Yours was the last booth of the day for me, I have to call upon a patient before sun’s sleep today, and be ready for new ones on Sun’s Death tomorrow” Molli replied softly. She wished that her friend’s booth was closer to her home, with a promise to attend them again after Sun’s Birth Festival she left to see to her young patient, and his family.
The priest laughed, such a joyful sound, from a man that knew more of the ways of the dead than the ways of the living.
Mycroft ignored the mental image of Molli simpering. he didn't want to risk laughing in his brother's face at the notion of the girl that had ordered Caesar's most trusted guards around as if they were her servants, and had used the empress as a birthing assistant so none would know that the child born was not of her body, the woman that scolded Caesar himself like an errant child. “I will not have some woman, getting in the way of discovery” Sherlock continued ignoring his brother's carefully hidden thoughts each word trying to form a new image in Mycroft's head that he carefully locked away, he would retell this story to Anthea, verbatim. Yes, that would amuse her, and give him the opportunity to laugh at the images drawn up in his head.
“I will see that you may” he whispered standing and fixing his tunic. He watched his brother leave the house. He heard the soft footfalls of his wife behind him. She always makes just enough noise for him to hear her, but never so much as to intrude. He felt her soft hands guide him by the arm over to the cushions and help him down. Her dark hair fell freely across her shoulders in the manner he always preferred. Her gentle presence a balm to the aches of the world, but even she wasn’t enough today.
Mycroft just smiled at him “you will see, brother mine after the wedding” he said “but” he added, "you will marry the girl, and do your duty to; our family, the gods, and the empire first".
Molli grabbed the arm of the guard and raced through the streets to the palace. To the young man’s amazement the few people they passed so late in the night all made a sign of blessing, believing that they were trying to save the life of a mother and babe, not of emperor of Rome himself. Heartened the young guard ran faster knowing that the girl with him was correct, the foresight she showed may give them the edge to save the emperor.
In a mark she would belong to a man, she had never met. She would have to find ways to hold onto any freedom she wished to maintain.
He looked on, maintaining a calm demeanor as the younger man paced frantically around the room spinning to face his brother. The broken look in the young man’s eyes tore at his brother’s heart, but he couldn't allow that to show.
“If I hear of the hour of his death, I will see to it that you get the opportunity to speak to him.” Mycroft answered exhaustedly
“You would be welcome to bring anyone from your household that you wish, to attend your needs” Mycroft said, far more casually than he felt.
“No!” Sherlock shouted, his normally smooth and beautiful voice shattered in grief “you have to, otherwise he will die, and it will be my fault” he dropped to his knees in front of his brother, hooking a finger under Mycroft’s sash “I will do anything to see him home safely” trying to make his voice into a sultry purr, but the pain still showing “you have Caesar’s ear, he will give you what you ask”
“not likely, and less likely the combination would be given. Either one could easily kill a woman on their own, and the combination was almost guaranteed to. Someone wanted her dead, though if she had survived the child wouldn't have, so that could be a factor”
Molli grabbed one of the slaves by the arm and guided her into the back room. The Centurion and John followed her
the boy led them to Mycroft's suites asking John to stay behind as he took Martha to attend to Molli
Mycroft sat next to Caesar, speaking of the event of the day. He poured wine for his Emperor, allowing no hand but his own to touch Caesar’s goblet. Caesar could tell that he wished to make a request of him. Mycroft always showed him, before he asked. That was one of the things Caesar appreciated about the man. He always knew what to expect from him, that and Mycroft’s ambition was to be the most important person you would never know, and Caesar thought a bit ruefully, he likely was. He was invaluable, and brilliant, but he never wanted anyone to know his true power. Very few in the Senate even knew how he pulled strings in their own ranks, with Caesar, and even in the military. The man was a marvel, but because of that, he was entirely loyal. His power was tied to the power of the men he influenced, perhaps controlled was a better term. Caesar smiled, he should be offended by the thought of being controlled by such a man, but the reality was that Mycroft was privately ambitious, remarkably gifted in both intellect as well as the understanding of the ways of men and women, and had tied his ambition to the throne. He was Caesars man, in every possible way.
Molli stood in the room that Anthea had set aside for her use and stared at the wall. She was to be wed to a noble, the brother of Caesar's trusted adviser. She had even been adopted into Caesar's household, though that likely wouldn't mean much as long as her husband ruled her. She had protections, if he abandoned her or if he died. She looked over the scrolls again, the marriage contract that Caesar had signed as her father, allowed her to divorce and find a love match, if her husband failed to give her a child within the first two years. She would also keep everything she had now and all of Caesar's gifts to her, as well as any payments from her own work, if her husband set her aside. She knew the herbs to take to prevent conception, and to end a pregnancy before anyone but she, would even know it had begun. She hated thinking of the latter, but if the man that was to be her husband was unbearable, she would do it. Of course, if he was cruel to her, or tried to keep her from her work, there were other herbs that would assist with that. She shuddered at  the thought of what she may be forced to do. As a healer it went against everything she believed. She would pray the gods' forgiveness for even thinking of what she would do. Perhaps he was like most of the nobility, interested only in his own amusement. If so, she  would buy slave girls and perhaps boys, that were beautiful enough to hold his interest. She would only need to see him when they lay together. As long as she could leave him to his own interests, she would be fine. If he was an easily controlled simpleton, she could even become with child with John. They looked enough of a kind that anyone would only think a child took after their mother. She closed her eyes, preparing herself for what awaited her, in only a few days time. She would come out ahead of this, she hoped.
strong hands grabbed him and drug him along. This is it his mind supplied he prayed that he would find favor with God and be forgiven for his sins. He had given Mycroft a letter for Sherlock, telling him not to blame himself, and that he was loved. He wished he could see the man one last time, just to say goodbye, but maybe it was better this way. He was led outside and set into the back of a carriage, swiftly but not unkindly. He closed his eyes, and waited for the dizzy spell to pass. His mind registered that the door was opening as another man was pushed into the carriage, a few minutes later a woman was shoved in, by the time the third and fourth were brought out, his mind was starting to clear. He had hoped that he would be drugged before his death, but it seemed that God wished to meet him on his feet. He closed his eyes again and laid his head back against the carriage wall, when the carriage started moving. He heard a soft prayer coming from one of the women. His mind drifted to Sherlock, not sure if he hoped to see Sherlock again, or if he wished to spare his fried the pain of seeing him die.
“Could you please close the door Dr. Watson.” Gerald calmly addressed him. John closed it without turning his back to the security guard but Gerald eyes were solely fixed on Sherlock.
It was really sad that John first reaction at seeing the gun was a resigned sigh because of course the night would end like this, it was the only logical conclusion of everything that happened today.
“Exactly!! Alexander Gerald to be exact, I saw his name tag once, and I remembered few days ago I walked with you to the building and kissed you goodbye, he must have seen us then.”
John felt creeped out, first the shop assistant and now the security guard, both men part of his daily life not some strangers lurking in the dark, both looked and acted normal with no ominous attire or shifty eyes. He guessed it was too much to hope for loonies to look their part. Shaking the dark thoughts and focusing on the present moment, the tried again with Sherlock.
“Not actually stalling. I knew Mycroft men were right behind us. I wanted to hear his plan before they took him in.”
“I said I killed somebody; a man to be more specific. Should you go to the doctor? Are you losing your hearing?”
“‘Kill’ a verb that means causing someone to die by unnatural causes. Are you also losing your comprehension skills?”
“Threatening John’s well-being. I would never forgive that.” In a quick move Sherlock brought john to the ground covering him with his body as a shot rang out in the house. Gerald dead body hit the floor with a thud.
“I won’t let you miss your daily fix of danger, I promise. I’ll even tell you every single fiddly detail so that you can write about it in your public love letter.”
“No. Jesus.” John ran a hand through his hair, frustrated, letting some of the anger and hurt slip into his voice. “I
It occurred to John that Harry and Sherlock would get along spectacularly. They were both such drama queens.
“It comes up in casework more often than you’d think. People tend to let their guard down when they’re sexually manipulated.”
John peered out. Sure enough, right below the window, a pipe led down to the backyard. “Well, what d’you reckon?” he asked Sherlock, “Why did the Golem do this?”
Sherlock’s eyes were burning. Hunger gnawed away at his insides, and he almost repented skipping dinner. John had tried to force him to eat, but he didn’t want to stop working - not when he felt like he was finally on to something.
“I don’t know.” Sherlock said. He sat up, agitated, and pulled John’s blanket tightly around himself. “I don’t like not knowing.”
John got up and plucked the apple core from his hands, discarding it and leaning by the desk. Far enough to give Sherlock his personal space, but close enough to provide comfort, if needed.
The waiting was the worst part. Time seemed to drag on at half its normal speed, and he could only imagine what it must be like for Sherlock, who was a generally impatient man. John had spent enough time in hospital rooms to know that staring at a clock didn’t help, but he didn’t have the heart to say anything to Sherlock. He settled for massaging Sherlock’s hands instead; his muscles were wound tighter than steel.
A huge plate of fish and chips later - none of which Sherlock ate, opting instead to watch John happily dig in - and Billy still hadn’t signalled. Sherlock sighed and shifted his gaze from the window to the waitress, who was flirting shamelessly with John.
He turned away and buried his face in the jumper, lulled by the comforting mixture of smells which were so uniquely John. He spent the night in some dreamland between slumber and wakefulness. By the time the first rays of dawn penetrated the room, he had given up on getting any sleep. He sat up and suddenly froze, for he had heard footsteps on the stairs, and then the door creaked open.
“No.” John said stoutly, “I don’t understand. You - you can’t just tell me to leave. We’re a couple! We stay, we talk!”
John swallowed. It reminded him a little of his own childhood, although his father would never hit a child...he turned to find Sherlock watching him intently. Sherlock looked away quietly.
Just for a moment, there was a ghost of a smile on Mycroft’s lips, but it vanished as quickly as it had come. “Well, brother mine, I thought it was about time. Let’s move on, shall we? I am a busy man.”
The lights seemed too bright, so he switched them off and curled up on the sofa. His arm brushed against something soft, warm and instantly recognizable, and he pulled it out with a sinking feeling. It was one of those ridiculous jumpers, the ones which John somehow managed to look endearing in. He ran his fingers over the knitting pattern and recognized it as the one John had worn to their first case. They’d both been so alone and averse to offers of help, but so entirely willing to throw their lot in with each other. He still didn’t know what had gone through his head when he saw John for the first time and decided,
Molly drew herself up to her full height. “Please don’t talk to me again, Sherlock Holmes. I’m done being used by you. Goodbye.” She turned on her heel and stormed off.
Together, John and Sherlock had tried every possible combination, unscrambled names, addresses, dates...nothing made sense. At some point, John had gotten up to check on Rosie, rejoined Sherlock on the floor, and then fallen asleep himself. He woke up now, looking disoriented and bleary. Sherlock snapped his eyes away. He didn’t want John to think that he had watched him sleep.
“But you aren’t. I can get you some, if you’d like. I’m sure one of them -” she tilted her head at the guards, “- has a pack.”
John’s face was an inscrutable mask, and Sherlock got the distinct feeling that he was hiding some deep, dark secret. He would ask, but he could see that John needed some time to sort through whatever he was feeling. After all, John hadn’t forced him to open up about Irene Adler in front of the fireplace that night. This brought him back the original problem: how badly he wanted to cuddle with John again, to settle his head in the crook of John’s neck and fall asleep like that.
. Rosie stopped crying and surveyed him with equal parts interest and wariness. Finally, she happily reached out and tweaked his nose. “Ta.” she declared. He just held her even further, unsure about what to do. He hadn’t dealt with babies since Sherlock and Eurus, and he remembered all too well how
“Your body works day and night to keep you alive, Noel. All that blood and bone and muscle. Don’t hurt it. Don’t disregard it. Situations change, but these scars - they’re a permanent reminder of what went wrong.”
Sherlock saw the resolute look in John’s eyes and knew that he meant it. “Then deduce me, Doctor Watson. I’m sure you’ve learnt
“Dad’s right.” Sherlock interrupted. “Come on, Mycroft, what could possibly go wrong? Sherrinford to the hospital, then back to Sherrinford. Just put maximum security on her.”
“I won’t deny that. Oh, it’s Lestrade. Hello, Gerald.” Sherlock listened for a while, and then his face lit up with intense excitement. “Good. We’ll be right down.”
It was at times like these that Mycroft really comprehended the differences between them. He may be smarter than Sherlock, but at the end of the day, Sherlock had what mattered: the humanity that anchored him.
“I think it really did break him.” she said, “First his wife, and now the dreadful business with James. But you wouldn’t understand that.”
“Then stay at Baker Street.” Sherlock turned to face him, eyes intense and piercing. “You and Rosie - you can both stay for as long as you want. There’s plenty of space, but if Rosie needs more, I can shift my experiments -”
John was a little taken aback. This was the warmest she’d been since - well, since she’d finalized her divorce and cried herself out on his shoulder.
“Because, Sherlock, it’s the only plan we have! For god’s sake, stop being such a big baby.” John could feel his own temper rising. “It’s one date. I’ve told you this before and I’ll say it again: do something while there’s still a chance, because that chance doesn’t last forever.”
She hesitated and pursed her lips. “It’s possible. But not in the way that you think. I think his reappearance last night shook Noel more than his death.”
. He didn’t find the shoe, but his hand brushed against something papery. Against his better judgement, he pulled it out.
“- identified as Nathan, Alex and Howard Garrideb. The bodies washed up on the shore a few hours ago. Investigations have been launched to ascertain the cause of death - ” the reporter said. Beside her were three blown up images of the Garrideb brothers.
Sherlock tiptoed halfway down the stairs and sat down. He’d found a slinky in his room, and he now let it bounce down the stairs, fascinated. There was something strangely elegant about its movement and balance, the orderly arrangement of its rings, the way it righted itself at the bottom of the stairs instead of rolling away chaotically. A door above him opened, and Mycroft’s irritated face poked out.
Sherlock watched him disappear through the main door, then made his way upstairs to their flat. What a wasted opportunity. Still, he was rather touched by the fact that John finally trusted him enough to leave him alone with Rosie. He entered the living room and got to work, printing out photos of the crime scene and sticking them all over the wall. It had been a while since he’d been handed such an interesting case.
- as the panic he’d been avoiding till now started to set in. Noel wasn’t light, and he was dragging them both down. John was struggling to keep both his head and Noel’s above the water, trying to hold on as the faces and lights flashed before his eyes.
“No, you twat, you have nice eyes.” John said, “Only I can never figure out what colour they are. They keep changing; green, blue, who knows?”
The stairs led to a small room - or a landing, rather - with two doors leading off on each side, one of which had yellow tape covering it. It was this one that John, Sherlock and Lestrade entered. The room was small, with a single bed pushed against one wall, a dresser next to it. A few pictures and posters adorned the faded walls, all of which Sherlock ignored as he made his way to the dead boy lying on the bed. He looked expectantly at John.
He tuned his violin, but ended up playing such a mournful melody that he depressed himself further. Flinging it down on the armchair in disgust, he picked up a pile of post-its, intending to update his case notes. But his brain was too muddled, and even thinking about Rosie getting kidnapped was painful. He made himself some tea, then realized he’d made two cups out of habit. Slamming the cups down in frustration, he grudgingly admitted that he couldn’t tune his emotions out this time.
Eurus smiled to herself. Sherlock, obviously; he would bring John Watson. If everything had gone to plan, Charlotte - whoops, Irene - would be with him as well. She took the violin from its hatch and lovingly cleaned the bow. Did Mycroft really think that a few Christmas treats could make up for years of incarceration? Oh, how she wanted to drive this very violin through his skull. Not that she ever got the chance; Mycroft never visited her, except when their parents forced him to.
Sherlock pulled away for a moment to consider this. If he had known John loved him, would he still have jumped? Absolutely; there was no question about it, not with John’s life on the line. But watching John’s world fall apart would’ve been twice as hard. On the other hand, if he had known that John cared that much, he might even have told him about the fake suicide plan. He would’ve stayed in touch, at least...
“ - I watched you. I saw your reaction. You dropped your head into your hands, like you couldn’t bear to listen, and almost curled up as if to protect yourself.”
“Found out where he was staying, got the keys to the adjoining room and jumped over from the balcony. I had to see him, John. The victim’s narrative often contains leading clues - ones which Lestrade would surely have overlooked in his interrogation. Remember Henry Knight? Remember how him saying
Breakfast at the Holmes’ house that morning was a gloomy affair. Sherlock pushed his food around his plate, weighed down by the knowledge of what he would have to do later that day. John nursed a cup of coffee, checking his phone constantly - Mrs Hudson had called earlier to tell him that Rosie had an upset stomach. Mr and Mrs Holmes tried to indulge them in conversation, and while John tried to be polite and friendly, they could still sense the grey cloud gathering over him. They decided to focus their energy on interrogating Mycroft instead.
His eyes followed the way Noel was hugging his pillow. “Look there!” he said suddenly, pointing out of the window, and Noel looked. In a trice Sherlock had the pillow and had plunged his hand into the stuffing. He pulled out a small tin box and opened it to find, as expected, the small blades. Noel stiffened.
Sherlock had thought he would never be able to sleep again, but he drifted off eventually, only to be roused by a nightmare. He sat up with a sharp cry, automatically reaching out for John, but there was no one to comfort him - only the dark, oppressive stillness of the night. He took a deep breath, willing his heart rate to come back to normal.
“No.” he said, “There’s always something.” Yardley looked up, and John patted his shoulder. “Your wife and son would’ve wanted you to keep living. They wouldn’t want you to give up.”
“No! No, I think it’s a great idea.” John smiled widely at him. “Honestly, I’ve always loved camping, and it is good to get out of London for a while. Just didn’t peg you as the type.”
She squeezed his hand. “Well, I’m glad I can attend at least one son’s wedding before I die. No pressure.”
“He leaves the living room window open when he sleeps.” Lestrade said, “She climbed in. It’s only the ground floor.”
“Mrs Ferrier’s necklace has been stolen.” Lestrade informed him, before he could ask, “An hour ago. She puts it in a cabinet, leaves for a few minutes, and when she comes back, it’s gone.”
The doctor sighed. “All right.” he mumbled, writing something on his notepad and giving it to Sherlock, “Take this pass.” Sherlock snatched it and ran out of the room.
Chances of an update next week are pretty shaky. I’ve already written the next chapter, but it’s crucial plot-wise and I need to make sure I get it right. Also, I have two almost life-alteringly important exams on the 21st and the 27th. On the plus side, I’ll have absolutely nothing to do after that, so my update frequency should increase!
“You came back earlier than I deduced you would.” Sherlock said, amused, “And just as drunk, if not more.”
John nodded. “Of course. We’re leaving now. You ought not to stay here tonight, what with the broken French window and everything.”
“She just makes sounds right now. She should say her first word soon.” he said. He held his arms out for Rosie, but she clung on to Mycroft. “Do sit down, Mycroft.”
“The thing about that.” he started, but Mr Trevor was looking at him so intently that he lost his nerve. Behind him, Mycroft tapped his foot impatiently. He took another deep breath and continued, trying to speak as slowly as possible. “I’m sorry, Mr Trevor, but your son is dead.”
“The crimes with red numbers…” Mycroft finally said, “They coincide with murder. Red five, Irene Adler’s mother murdered. Red three, Noel Evans’ father murdered. Red one…”
“Go back to your room, young man. I don’t want you hanging around this investigation. You don’t need the trauma.” Rachel said, sternly. “Oh, but eat something, you haven’t eaten since yesterday -” But he had already gone back up the stairs.
“Is there any way I could see him, just once more before he dies?” Sherlock asked, without facing his brother. His hand stretched before him, against the wall, as if holding himself up on it, his head hung dejectedly, his eyes closed in pain, his voice shaking. Mycroft crossed the room and placed a gentle hand on his brother’s back, he rested his head gently on the younger man’s shoulder. “I need to tell him, I need to see him and touch him one last time. I need to beg his forgiveness” his voice soft and pained
“Is she safe here Mycroft” John asked seriously, turning in the other man's arms “I have sworn that I will keep her safe,  swear to me and I will be yours until she calls”
“If any can, it would be her, I have seen a child saved that the gods had called.” Caesar said sitting up in his bed “if the gods will it we may both be saved” he gestured to the boy in the corner
Mycroft and the Centurion hurried through the halls of the slave pit. Mycroft showed the writ to the guards, they were falling over each other to get out of the way of Caesar’s men.
“My son was born not 10 days ago. He started bruising and a rash appeared across his body, he refused to nurse at his mother’s breast, the midwife called it the wasting disease. My wife and I took him to a healer that said that she can save him, if we can find men or women that when their blood is touched to a cloth, it turns orange. I do not lead so many men that I can find enough to save my son. I beg of you Caesar, please grant me access to the slave pits. That I may find enough that my son could live”
Mycroft walked regally into the small temple of Pluto. His brother standing at his side, he placed a ring in front of the alter in the offering plate, of the finest gold, and clearest gem he could find. His brother placed a similar clasp next to it. The priest of Pluto stepped into the room. “I thought I had heard the door open” he smiled at the men. “I should have expected it would be you, most fear Lord Pluto too much to do more than toss a coin or two at his feast.”
“Is the wine to your liking?” he asked using no honorifics, or titles. They were friends, and they were in Caesar’s private suite.
Sherlock and Lestrade were talking to the bartender that John spoke with the night before, every word making both men more concerned than the last. Sherlock stepped outside to call Mycroft while Lestrade continued to question the man.
John sent a short prayer after Mycroft for his safety, as well as his brother’s. If God was pleased with him, he would see the brothers again, but for now he was willing to stay as a slave in Molli’s household. He felt useful and he knew what it was like to be, not quite, a part of society, as well as healer. He a Jew, she a woman, but they were united in their desire to serve, to help and to protect life. If he had to serve as a slave, he would accept being the slave of a healer, at least until Mycroft and Sherlock found a way to purchase him from her. The other option being a slave to the centurion was also positive, he would be taken into the man’s routine and accompany him on campaigns, he would be a military healer again. Even if he didn’t get a say in who he served, he would still serve as a healer and do everything in his power to keep his patients alive and hale.
“You have to fix this Mycroft, you are the only one that can” a pleading tone that, Mycroft had a hard time reconciling with his brother’s voice.
Caesar sat behind him, never breaching his sight, as to not shatter the illusion that it was another man dripping olive oil over his length, stroking it, as he held him against the solid weight of his chest. Mycroft’s head was thrown back as he gasped in relief. This was not about pleasure, it was about forgetting, it was about removing himself from the world for a few moments, and it was all the man could give his friend. His hands and lips working over Mycroft’s body, wringing every sensation possible out of the man, he would not speak a word, he knew what Mycroft needed to release himself from the prison of his own mind. He had seen the man go stiff when he had given the order, he wished that his power was more assured, that he would have been able to indenture the man for a few years into the hands of the brothers. He could feel Mycroft’s body react under his hand, he could feel his hardness throbbing with his impending release; he kissed at the other man’s shoulder breathing carefully across his throat from behind. Mycroft’s breath caught as his climax stole over him, the man behind him not allowing him to turn his head. Mycroft felt a single hot tear trace down his face, his grief, his despair and his pain all unable to be contained anymore. He would not allow himself more than that brief moment to show any weakness in public. He closed his eyes and laid his head back against the solid body behind him, his mind replaced the room with his chamber at home, and the smell of the man for the faint trace of exotic spice that surrounds John. Pulling his robe closed, and allowing the comfort of the other man to support him, he would be in Caesar’s place after sunrise, when the executions were to occur. He would be the one, holding and supporting his younger brother, after the death of the man they both love.
He turned to his home, knowing he would not be seeing it again until after the executions. He wanted nothing more than to take refuge behind her walls, and let his wife care for him, perhaps invite guests over to celebrate the turning of the seasons. He touched the door in silent prayer for the safety of all within, as he did every time he left. Knowing that the one person he would wish for safety would be dead at the change of the moon. He held his head high, knowing that he could never show the trial that weighed on his heart. He started the short trek to the Curia, and the Palace after the close of the Senate for the evening. His boy silently joined him, the sack Anthea had prepared slung over his shoulder. He rested a hand gently on the child’s head in acknowledgement as he walked.
“did you not listen to what was said and how. You are now family to Caesar himself. Think about what that means for you, and did you not hear the name and title of your bride?”
She left the mother and child, and went to her slaves’ room both were awake. They knew the life of a healer as well as she did. Both were already in motion “go, rest.” The old  woman insisted softly “we will wake you before the father returns, until then there is nothing you can do, we will have the room set” Molli nodded, she knew to sleep when the opportunity presented itself.
“Why couldn’t you get me in to see him, you promised me that I would see him before…” his voice trailed off as the tears fell unchecked
The soft rustle of fabric was Mycroft’s only warning before he felt soft lips touch the back of his neck. “We shall grieve death, when it falls. Tonight shall we grieve life?” Caesar whispered into his ear, his hand reaching for Mycroft’s sash. He froze waiting for acceptance before stripping the other man of his robes. The exalted emperor of the great Roman State stripped him of both of his shells, clothes and of mind. Mycroft felt a hand stroke his side his eyes closed in pleasure. If in his mind he saw a shorter man with bright eyes, sandy hair, a crystalline laugh, and strong but unassuming bearing; instead of the emperor of Rome, he would never speak of it to any living. If Caesar knew that while he stroked Mycroft to fullness that the other man was imaging it was the hand of another man, he would never say. Just as Mycroft had never spoken of it, when it was his mouth surrounding Caesars manhood, as Caesar called the name of a lover lost in an attack that should never have happened.
“I know you would have, had it been possible. Now all I can do is pray to the gods and grieve for my lost friend. The fault was never with you.” Mycroft sighed defeated “nor with my brother, Sherlock, would never have knowingly risked the life of one he loves. The fault lies with the dead, Lord Pluto’s hand now holds all”
“I believe your physician wishes you to take a break for your health, My Emperor” Mycroft stated warmly “at risk of sounding disloyal, I must agree with her assessment.”
When she reached the last booth in the market that she was to visit that day, she couldn’t help the smile that crossed her face at the man in front of her, they had grown to know each other well over the few year she had been in Rome. She had seen all four of his children into the world, after the first was trapped in his mother’s womb, and she was the only healer that refused to give up until the child was safely nursing at his mother’s breast. He returned her smile as he placed the bag on the bench. Looking into the bag she raised an eyebrow at the extra bottles in the bag. Reading the slip of paper that accompanied the bottles she smiled at him fondly, the man was almost too generous with her. “It causes no hardship” his wife’s voice came from behind her. Molli turned to face her friend, one of the few she could speak to openly. “I speak true. We find many herbs that would only be useful to a rare few healers. That you are one of those healers, is Fortuna’s work” the woman smiled at the young girl that saved her life, and the life of her first son. “Would you care for company on your shopping?” she asked
Caesar ran his finger gently through Mycroft’s hair. He knew how it felt to lose a man under your command. The Praetorians standing guard over the men, looked on in sympathy, and respect. They had also lost men trusted to their care, and knew the heart sickness of grief that came with it. Mycroft leaned into the other man’s caress, taking comfort in the warmth, and affection being offered.
“Bring boiled water and blankets” Molli said quietly exhaustion sounding in her voice “let no one enter the family wing”
He hated being caught in the middle of his brother's plans, he had no intention of settling down, and he wasn't a cruel enough man to kill a woman that he was bound to. He stalked the room trying to find a way out of this. What was he supposed to do, was he to care for her, while she lived a life of ease, was she to take care of him while he attended to the tedium of court, and the nobility, that he was now marrying into. He hated not knowing, but right now he had no idea what even the next day would bring. Today would be the ceremony, then a celebration, then he would be alone with a woman he had never met, and he would be expected to lay with her, at least that part he knew what to do, he had taken lovers enough to understand how bodies react and the motivation for some crimes.
Sherlock's eyes darkened suspiciously “who is she, and what aren't you telling me, Mycroft?” he asked warningly.
John opened his eyes, when the door opened, it was dark in the pits, but that was hardly a surprise, it was always dark in the pits
Molli pulled out some clean clothes and thought about sending the girls out to wash, she figured they could wait a few more days, but the life of a healer meant that you could never take time for granted. She called John and Martha out to the garden to help cut herbs, as the three of them were the only ones that knew how to treat medicinal herbs. She planned on teaching the slaves purchased with John to read and write so she could at least get some help with labeling them. Sometimes she wondered if she shouldn’t purchase a youngster or two to teach the skills that she would never be able to pass on to a child, as no suitor would look at a woman that lead such a disgraceful lifestyle as to have a profession of her own. Not that she would ever want a husband to control her and take her work from her. That would be absurd. What man would want a wife like her? No she was never going to teach a child of her own the gifts of medicine, but maybe she and John could teach a slave child, or an orphan. She would have to discuss that with him, after they settled in for the night. It wasn’t spoken of, but as a slave it was not unheard of that he knew her. She wondered briefly as she cut some fenugreek and placed it in a basket to sort, what he would be like. She knew what he was like as a healer, and she had seen his scars and knew that some of them had to be earned in battle, so a soldier as well, he was a kind man with a strong sense of morality, she looked over at him as he cut a few more stems and placed them. His eyes drifted to hers, and he looked at her as if trying to read her mind, Molli blushed a bright crimson causing John to laugh cheerfully. “I would deny you nothing, mistress” he said smiling “though today perhaps a better use of my body is simply to bring you comfort. If that is your wish”
“we need sleep, then to bathe before the banquet tonight. My wife knows my habits enough to entertain your lady, until it is time to be ready” Mycroft whispered into John's ears.
Molli nodded her head cautiously, not sure if she wanted him to see her interest or not. He looked harmless, and that fascinated her, but there was something about him that she couldn't quite place.
John nodded, his face buried in his Alpha’s neck. Sherlock just held him “Take me home, please Sherlock” he asked quietly “I don’t want to finish out my heat in a hospital, and there is no real reason for me to go anyway”
The boy was the greater concern, he was not fairing as well as the emperor. That was only to be expected, as the child was smaller and much more fragile than the strong man in the bed.
Mycroft looked on shrewdly, as Molli sagged again looking to the guards, “escort the empress and the healer to the empresses quarters and make a pallet on the floor for the healer” he turned his head “you” he said to another guard “set up a royal nursery for the child, and you” he nodded at the cooks “prepare a birthing suite, bring more water and spread the word through the servants that the empress has had a healer brought in because her baby is coming early”
about it - not even his therapists, not even Mary. He knew it was the wrong approach, but he figured that if he never spoke about it, he wouldn’t have to deal with it. He didn’t want their patronizing pity, because they wouldn't understand. They didn’t
“I promised your mother that if she ended up on the deathbed, I would get the family together one last time. She vowed to do the same for me. She would want to see her daughter, Mycroft.”
“First eyes, then a head, then thumbs, and now a foot. Shall I expect an ear next? A lung, perhaps?” asked John.
Next Tuesday found John struggling hard to stay awake, although it was barely noon. Between a restless detective and a screaming baby, it had been nearly impossible to sleep the night before. He tiredly stirred the coffee, rubbing his eyes; it wouldn’t do to fall asleep at work again. The door opened and the receptionist (he was yet to learn her name; she was the fourth since Mary) peeked in.
“I’m starting to see what you’re driving at.” John said. “The first one involved Irene Adler and a murder - to catch your attention. It set the trend so that you would surely turn up to all the other investigations. The second one led back to Mrs Hudson, the third one to me. This sort of thing, it needs resources and a large number of people - one person can’t do it on his or her own. Who would hatch such an elaborate plan and why?”
He tripped over a small white shoe and started hunting for the other one. Rosie’s shoes had a knack for ending up in the most unexpected places - wedged under the fridge, underneath a sofa cushion, once even jammed up the fireplace. He sometimes had a feeling Sherlock hid them just to exasperate him. Well,
The living room was a perfect mess. The papers and files from the previous night still lay scattered around the couch. Rosie’s toys and clothes were everywhere. John looked around at the chaos and huffed, exasperated. He almost wished that he had accompanied Sherlock on his revisit of the crime scenes, but he was far too tired from his day at the clinic.
“John, I’ve made a terrible mistake. Mycroft was right. Caring is not an advantage.” he said monotonically. John wouldn’t fall for it, but it was the only thing he could think of.
Sherlock Holmes. It’s absurd. Yes, you bloody moron, absolutely. I’ll be your boyfriend - if you’ll be mine.”
Sherlock took a deep breath. “And, you know, if the bees don’t bother you - you could come too. Assuming we’re both still alive, of course, and on good terms with each -”
“Oh, you’re a bad man.” John muttered. He threw open the closet doors and pulled a random drawer open, mentally apologizing to Mary. He dug around, trying to get the job over with. To his surprise, his fingers touched something hard and papery, and he pulled it out. It was a nondescript brown file, but when he saw what was inside, his eyes widened. On the front page, one word printed in dark black ink glared at him.
“It’s for the case - and don’t worry about Rosie, she’s with Molly. I need to watch this area for a night, just to see if there’s anything suspicious going on. I could use your company, I suppose.”
“There’s a difference between not protecting people,” he commented, “And voluntarily putting them in danger.”
He sat down next to John, who was still staring at the letter. Sherlock didn’t even need to read it again. He’d practically memorized it by now, rereading, hoping, wishing.
“Firstly, Moran’s a lot older than he looks.” she started. “What I’m about to tell you is practically ancient history - it happened back when Frank and I were still married, and he was running the drug cartel. There was a man - Frank’s rival - and Frank invited him over for tea, to discuss some business matters.”
John reached out and took his hand. “We are not made to know and understand everything.” he said softly. “You’re here with me, right now, at this restaurant with frankly mediocre food, and that is more than I could ever have hoped for. Let’s just try to enjoy this, yea?”
“They told me not to.” Molly said in a small voice. “I’m not like you two. I’m not used to dealing with a situation like this. I really am sorry.”
“John, don’t be aggravating. Fine. Let’s do this the boring way.” He leaned down and pecked John on the cheek, but John simply swatted him away again.
“Do have a seat, Mycroft. I’m sorry you had to go to the trouble of coming to Baker Street, but you told me never to come to the office if I wanted to talk about anything...sensitive.”
“Shut up. I’ve been in love with you for far longer than you can possibly imagine. When you came back, it drove me crazy - I couldn’t choose. You were as unattainable as ever -”
“Yes, drug overdose. In case you were wondering, Upton’s staying at a hotel for now. He’s a nervous wreck. There’s no chance of you talking to him.”
“If what you’re saying is right, hidden somewhere in all that information is our message. We are going to crack this code.”
Yardley looked over as they approached, drying his tears on his soaked sleeve. “Ah, Sherlock Holmes,” he croaked, “Pleased to meet you, sir. And you must be Dr Watson.”
“Yes.” he finally said, “When Harry came out, nobody reacted well. Not him, not mom, not any of our relatives. I tried to stick up for her, but he was quite immovable. Mum and dad didn’t even come to her wedding.”
Lestrade brought Mark into the living room, and he stood there, scared and shaking like a leaf. Sherlock hadn’t even asked him anything yet, and his eyes were already darting around like that of a criminal caught in the act.
“No, when Mrs Ferrier realized that the necklace was gone, she screamed bloody murder. That policeman - right there - his name’s Wilkins, he heard her and came running.”
Sherlock knew that he was at a dead end. He couldn’t move forward with the case until he found out more about the boy’s history, and he couldn’t do that until he talked to Irene and John talked to her father. Rosie raised her head and peered at the wall, too, pouting.
Lady Anthea smiled “I should not have startled you. I can see how exhausted you are. I was going to ask if you wished a bed here”, Anthea’s fingers drawing abstract patterns on the skin of Molli’s exposed arm “to sleep in”. Molli looked concerned, Anthea read every twitch of a muscle, every quirk of an eye lid or brow, every flash of thought in her eyes, Molli was easier to read than any scroll, or book. Her eyes betrayed every thought. Anthea was fascinated that she felt no reason to mask her intentions or thoughts, causing  everyone around her to unmask themselves as well. Her hand tightened on the younger girl’s arm, this girl was exactly what she appeared to be at any time, and yet so much more, she had to know more about this brilliant woman that had just saved the emperor and the empire. Her forethought was the reason that no rumors of treachery had been mentioned. The slaves were being split between the guards that had saved Caesar’s life, the food taster was being gifted to Lord Mycroft at the girl's, admittedly wise, suggestion. Any that knew of the treachery were either proven loyal, or the traitors, and rumors can be tracked to their source. Anthea had to know more, she felt drawn into a magnificent orbit of a girl that must be god-born, she felt her lips rest at Molli’s neck. Her fingers lightly traced up her arms and across her delicate throat, imagining a golden chain with a caduceus, or the golden disk or Apollo gracing such a beautiful column, her lips gently touched the spot that the gold would land in her mind. She entwined her fingers with the healers, “you do have a healers hands” she said in wonder “graceful and deft, yet strong and sturdy” she pulled Molli along after her, knowing that the girl’s fear and reservations were nothing but status based, but she had to know this delightfully intriguing girl better. She led Molli into the suites she shared with her husband and sent a slave to give Mycroft the message that she would be attending to the healer until she had at least rested and eaten. She was at the moment the perfect hostess, to the exhausted woman.
