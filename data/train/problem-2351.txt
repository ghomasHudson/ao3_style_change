Sherlock looked so heartbroken that John just had to kiss him. "You are no monster and I believe that you would never hurt me. No! Let me finish!" John intersects when Sherlock tries to interrupt. "I have a friend, that's a psychologist, who did intensive studies into mental illnesses. One of theses mental illnesses was Pure Obsessional OCD. Pure O OCD attacks the mind and plagues its victims with horrible thoughts. Usually makes the individual believe that he or she is cruel or bad. It is even said that the people with Pure O OCD have the kindest hearts and are some of the most loving people you will ever meet. So, no, Sherlock. I don't believe you are a monster. I believe you haven't been treated fairly and have always dealt with this alone. Sometimes just talking helps. When something like this happens in the future tell me! I will try to help and if I can't, I will find someone who can. I love you and nothing will change that."
and needed
Sherlock goes to take a step forward, arm outstretched to pacify the woman in front of him, but as soon as his foot is lifted from the ground, Mary fires—Sherlock in the chest.
The next morning, the sun shown lazily through the windows in Sherlock’s bedroom. After a long and emotionally taxing day, the two lovers fell into bed in an exhausted heap, but not before a loving kiss and whispered endearments. Now as the sun shines on John’s face, he blinks awake slowly. A besotted, happy grin spreads across his face as he takes in Sherlock’s relaxed and peaceful features.

"I promise. " He can confirm, because he knows that it will be alright.
But his daddy still leaves, and doesn't say goodbye.
"What did you have to do to them
Mycroft, (again)
Sherlock's shoulders visibly deflate and his eyes cast downward. When he does reply it's in a quiet hesitant tone, "I never thought I would have a soulmate. When I had found John, though, I had given up. I knew I was doomed to never find love and that I would always be alone. He had tried to court me on our first case together but I didn't want anyone, at the time, who wasn't my soulmate. Soon all that had changed and I found myself reluctantly in love with him. When we had found out that we are threadmates it no longer mattered, it just added to the love I already possessed. I constantly worry that he will find someone better. I am the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant and all-round obnoxious arsehole that anyone could possibly have the misfortune to meet, yet John loves me anyway. I don't deserve him. I've put him through so much. I just want this to be good for him. I just want to do one good thing for him after all the damage I've caused."
Special Thanks: QueenLadyAnne, my extremely wonderful, fantastic, and extraordinary beta. She always gives me such wonderful advice and encouragement!
But John wanted the to clear up any uncharted waters. He was tired of analyzing every word Sherlock said for some unspoken meaning. He was determined to put everything out on the table and either try to move on or see where this could take them. This is it.
During the plane ride, John sat by the window, looking out at the vast horizon. Outside, the sun is setting. The sun casts oranges, yellows and bright light across the sky, and beside him, sat his gorgeous husband. Sherlock was dozing lightly after the taxing day. A permanent smile was stitched across his face all day since the moment John saw Sherlock earlier this morning and it was still there as he gazed at his beautiful threadmate. John leans across the seats to place a gentle kiss against the detective’s ebony curls. The blogger smiles as his snoozing soulmate only burrows instinctively closer to the elated doctor.
John heard the front door slam so he knew he was finally alone. He slowly exhales and let's wave of disappointment settle over him. He knows he shouldn't be upset but he can still recall that eight year old little boy who had dreamt of a country home, a gorgeous husband, and possibly two adopted children. The husband fantasy now seems to be out and no adoption agency would ever take two unmarried blokes seriously if they had even tried to broach the subject of adoption.

gave me some inspiration for Dr. Heather Love.
Sherlock knew a few people (alright, he'd deduced them, but it's practically the same thing) who use cannabis to manage health conditions. There was the medic who often came to crime scenes - veteran, Iraq, amputated left lower limb, severe PTSD managed quite well with cannabis.  Excellent medic, always professional.  One of the best that he’s observed in recent memory.  Always gives John a tight grin of acknowledgement, which John always gives back.  Is always slightly stoned.
“But that’s – didn’t Einstein have an IQ that high?” John asked, astonished.  “Why isn’t she at Oxford or Harvard?  How’d she end up at Barts?”
“What about them?”
“Of course she's a genius, Sherlock. How can she not be with you teaching her everything day in and day out? Tea?”
“Hospital people?” John huffed a laugh. “And, no, generally, they do not, Sherlock, unless a very important document is routed to another person at a totally different hospital for some unforeseen reason. Which also never happens.”
Mrs. Hudson, whose hip pain is bad enough that she's worried that she needs a hip replacement.  No stranger to recreational marijuana; it manages her pain quite well, actually.  Keeps her active, helps her attend her many social engagements, she tolerates it exceedingly well. In fact, she’d gone clay shooting in Windermere just two weekends ago. She'd told him that she was using it before he had even thought to deduce it. Unprecedented, that.
“You're going to anyway . . .”
“No, but you’re certainly the most interesting.”  She had said it as a bit of a challenge.
He'd caught John looking at him that way, more times than he could count, but John had always looked at him in wonder. It didn't mean anything.
He stared back at her.  Of course she knew of his feelings for John.  But how could she have realized the shift that had occurred.  How could she know that just yesterday his world had burst open with the realization that John could be his?  Did she realize that?
.  You will be taken to a 21+ age-restricted site.
I'd like to believe that John really did love Mary when he married her.  He's a good guy; he wouldn't enter into something as important as marriage without being sure of what he was doing (at least until a drunken, handsy bachelor party made him question what he was doing - my opinion, totally).
“Molly? Greg, you old ladies’ man,”
“What?” John asked, taken aback by Heather’s abruptness.
They had all, obviously, benefited from cannabis with remarkably positive outcomes.  Granted, the sample size was small, but everyone knows that cannabis has a myriad of legitimate, medical uses.  Extreme nausea during cancer treatment, for example, almost always dissipates with cannabis usage.  He is not against this course of action.  He cannot decide if John will be for it or against it.
“Difficult not to notice,” he said, giving her a slow, languorous smile.  Not so difficult to turn it back on, then.  Not so difficult at all.
What he'd said before that?
Mrs. Hudson, LeStrade, and Mycroft were keeping a close eye on his usage and watching Sherlock for any signs of abuse (John couldn’t imagine Sherlock on downers.  The man never slept.  He couldn’t stand to be still, to stop. Cocaine derivatives were more his speed).
But John was very not gay and Sherlock was entirely gay.
Yet another opportunity to thoroughly study John.
When he opens his eyes he sees a different John.  He looks lighter.  His smile is luminescent.  John is standing up (no! More kisses!) and leaning into his ear and he says,  "You taste like cherry.   Seems appropriate."
“No!” Sherlock shouted.  He heard the prison psychologist shift in his chair and could feel the armed guard stiffen with attention. “I need you to speak!  Why can’t you just speak?  Tell me what you are trying to say!  Please, Eurus.” He closed his eyes, angry at how desperate he had sounded.  She did not need that to hold over him.  And yet, who was he kidding, she already knew everything there was to know about him, every button that she could push.
Sherlock spun on his heel and marched back into the living room, sitting on the edge of the Le Corbusier staring irritably at Mycroft.
“You’re the great John Watson, partner of the one and only Sherlock Holmes, the man behind
He knew that he cared for John. The depth of feeling that he had for John Watson could not be quantified and words did not exist to define it. He considered John his, always had, even when he'd been married to Mary, even when everything went to shit and John wouldn't acknowledge his existence, even after the letter that had rended him to pieces and nearly destroyed him. John was still his and always would be his.
“Well, it’s somewhere between 170 and 180.  When you get that high, they can’t get any closer than that.  But she doesn’t like to talk about it, really,” Molly answered.
.  And not exactly in the Greg LeStrade sort of way.”
The varietals that I've used in the story are all recommended for the treatment of PTSD.
Heather looked at Molly, a full, dazzling smile lighting up her face, and said, “Molly’s the best, isn’t she?  I couldn’t have a better lab neighbor.”
Sherlock's chair is a
“I know, I really do, but John brought it up,” answered Greg, a sly smile on his face.
“And?”
“Bringing your own teacups now, Mycroft?” he asked, his voice terse,  stopping as he ran into his bedroom to change into more suitable nightclub attire.  He'd change into the jewel blue silk shirt with those black pants that pushed his bum up  . . .
.  Needs someone else to
He’d come so close to death, and he’d realized that he didn’t want to die, so something good came out of the whole homicidal Eurus debacle.  She may have dropped three men off of a cliff but she’d saved John Watson from putting a gun in his mouth.
But right then, at that exact moment, just like when he was on a case and the answer just came to him, it felt as if someone had blown a hole through the wall of the John Watson's suite in his mind palace. Because that look that John had given him, that had meant something, and Sherlock had given it back.
He's very, very good at being a damn sexy beast.
At that moment, they both heard Rosie jumping in her cot, making gurgled noises with her tongue on the monitor. John took a deep breath in and schooled his features, stood from his chair, and said, “Sound's like She-who-must-be-obeyed has woken up. I'll pop up after her, yeah?” Sherlock had nodded quickly, feeling slightly stunned, frozen in his spot.
“Were your ears burning, then?” Greg asked Heather. “We were talking about you when you walked in the door.”
Come join me at my Johnlock tumblr,
“So, Greg and Molly, eh?” he said, easing into it.
“Piss off, Mycroft!” Sherlock yelled.
“Well, when you started coming to the morgue with Sherlock, after your – you were in mourning.  You were jumpy and angry and not the John Watson that you’d been before.  Then one day it seemed that you’d mellowed out.  You were smiling.  Your back was straighter. And you have connections. Also, Sherlock let something slip about your little green friend when you were walking down the hall.  Doesn’t take a genius.”
She gave him a warm smile and then pulled him in for a warm hug.  Greg arrived back with four pints and another plate of chips.
- The individual buds of dried cannabis flower, before it is ground up.  Large nugs are very prized.
John’s eyes widened as she looked between Heather and Molly, who was laughing at something Greg had said at the bar.  His growing anger that Molly would disclose something so sensitive must have shown on his face as Heather quickly added, “She told me because she found out that I use it too.  For PTSD and anxiety.  She saw some of my edibles at my flat.  I’ve been medicating since I was in college.  I don’t get by very well without it.  She told me in greatest confidence that there were others in the hospital that use it and your name might have been brought up.  By me.”
John Watson felt his heart speed up, resisted the urge to yet again wet his lips, and gave Dr. Heather Love his most lascivious, carnal smile.
He spends a lot of time thinking about it too hard.
Sherlock had three viable options: sabotage John's recovery, keeping him dependent on Sherlock.  This would not be the optimal course of action, and would infuriate John. It might even destroy him, and Sherlock had done enough of that already. Which left leaving John to his own devices, letting him bring home more boring, vacuous blondes, or control the events so that John would end up with a suitable woman: someone who was beautiful, because John deserved beauty in his life, someone who was intelligent, because Sherlock couldn't bear the prospect of Rosie being raised by someone with anything less than a stellar intellect, someone alluring and sexual, someone whom John would find fit, because John needed to be happy with his sex life. Someone safe. This was perhaps the most important quality.
John leaves his mouth open fractionally as he looks at Sherlocks knees,  seemingly searching for the right thing to say,  and then he finally settles on a very quiet,  "It's not.  Unrequited.  It's never been unrequited."  John's gathered a bit of confidence,  so he looks at Sherlock and says,  "You said you were married to your work. "
“He still needs psychological help.  And no, Mrs. Hudson is not enough, nor is she interested.  I did notice, however, that he's been weaning himself off of the Klonopin.  He has become much more of a help to you during your investigations and is relying on nannies less and less.”
And then the loveliest thing happened.  A beautiful blush appeared on Heather Love’s cheeks, high up on those impossible cheek bones.
They were stuck in a holding pattern, circling each other.  It had become nearly unbearable.
“Well, like I told Greg, I’m happy for you, Molly.  You deserve to be happy.  He makes you happy?”
And then he has a lap full of John Watson,  and he's being snogged within an inch of his life,  and he now completely understands why all of those women made so much of a fuss over John.   He wants to kiss John for the rest of his life.   He thinks he might get to,  especially when John whispers in his ear, "I'll love you until the day I die," and Sherlock can only answer,  "Yes."
(See the end of the chapter for
She already had her violin when he stepped into the room adjoining hers.  Already had it raised to her chin, waiting patiently as Sherlock removed his from the case, applied rosin to his bow, folded the tea towel that he used on his shoulder.  When he raised his bow, she played the A string continuously as he adjusted his, bringing his violin in perfect tune with hers.  They worked their way through the strings until they were both one tuned to the other.  And then he waited.
“They are,” she said, her eyes not leaving his.

Shoulders: tensed.
“Four pints? Getting me caught up?”
So that was it, really.  He read the manual for the vaporizer, found out that it had cost 300 pounds and was, indeed, top of the line. The grinder had been 125 pounds for Christ’s sake, but was the best grinder on the market.  Nothing but the best for the Holmes boys.
John is frightened.   He's starting to tremble,  holding his breath.
The debriefing commenced.
“I need –,“ he realized that he was whispering and that his whole body was shaking.  He took in a deep breath and modulated his breathing and spoke again, louder and with more authority. “Eurus, I need to know what you are trying to say to me.  I don’t want to guess this time.”
In the UK, cannabis is a Class B drug and illegal to grow, distribute, or possess.  It will buy you a minimum sentence of 5 years imprisonment and up to 14 years.  Since I don't live in the UK I'm not sure how strictly this is enforced; there are some parts of the US where cannabis remains illegal but drug courts are turning more of a blind eye toward possession, especially if there is a legitimate medical reason to have it.
Thank you for the kudos!  I am amazed at how many I've gotten so soon!  When you write a Snape/OTP story, the audience has to be persuaded a bit; Johnlocker's are hungry for more more more!  I love this ship,
“I’ll pick us up a few pints.  Why don’t you go join her?” Greg suggested, giving John a convivial slap on the back.
“Oh!” answered Molly, finally catching on. “Yes, that thing that is very important!”  She smiled and winked at Heather following Greg out of the booth.
She’d been adopted by a professor at a local university and his wife.  He’d encouraged her intelligence, giving her an area of his biology lab to indulge her curiosities.  She discovered the world of genetics in textbooks and had been hooked from that point forward.  She graduated American high school at 12 years of age.
Respiratory rate: elevated.

The wait was intolerable. All waiting was intolerable, but this was especially burdensome, even with Rosie's company and the anatomical figures that he had found to show her. She perhaps was a genius. She was only one, so any measure of intelligence at this point was unreliable, but she was exceedingly bright. She was fascinated with the inner ear, and really, who wasn't. The ear was fascinating, with it's bony architecture and tympanum and cochlear balance system. Rosie definitely understood everything that he was teaching her. She would be an otorhinolaryngology expert by the time she was three. He was certain of it.
John can tell he means it, that this is no experiment or script that Sherlock has come up with.  Sherlock can read it in his face.  Still, John asks,  "And you mean it? You're not fucking with me?"
John hadn't had intercourse in well over a year.  Toward the end of Mary's life they barely acknowledged each others existence, much less had sex.  It was one of the things that Eurus had taken advantage of; she had very nearly succeeded in bedding John.  She had not counted on John's strength of character, however; she couldn't have predicted his moral integrity.
“Oh, you know,” she said, suddenly interested in her napkin, folding it with precision and concentration, “Someone with authority.  Someone strong, who could take the reins in the relationship.”
Perhaps it was time that he changed his tenor.
Her smile fell from her lips, her pupils contracting as she watched the tip of John’s tongue skim over his lower lip.  The lovely blush reappeared.
He smiled, but he made sure that is wasn’t the kind jolly Doctor Watson smile.  No, this was a smile that hadn’t seen the light of day in years.  This smile was full of sex and control and testosterone and promised nothing but wicked intentions. She shivered when he ran his index finger over hers.
Slight bead of sweat on the upper brow.
But John sees it,  of course he does. John's voice is gentle and he says,  "Hey,  don't leave me, Sherlock.   Stay right here with me."  And when Sherlock refocuses,  John says, "I have something to tell you and I need you here with me. "
He turned looking surprised and said, “Tinsley! Fancy running into you here! John and I, however, are in a bit of a rush -”

Mycroft put down his teacup on the awaiting saucer and stood, examining the mantle. “Could I offer you a piece of advice?”
“You cannot stop John from becoming involved with a woman.  You can, however, vet the woman that he becomes involved with and control the initial meeting.  I will leave it up to you to figure out how to accomplish that.”
John joins Greg for pub night with the Yarders for the first time in a long time.  An opportunity arises, and he remembers that once upon a time, he was a damn sexy beast.
“Holy God.  Am I ever,” he answered.
The music was often full of sorrow.  She was deeply lonely.  Understandably, she felt forgotten.  With that came an undercurrent of chilling rage, that Mycroft had let everyone that mattered to her believe her dead.  Her song would go from plaintive to harsh and discordant at the flick of her wrist, her eyes mirroring her rage.
, your
He was shaking.  For a moment he was worried that he might lose his balance; the prison psychologist put his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder.  Sherlock violently shook him off.
In that moment,  staring at the pink tip of John's wandering tongue,  Sherlock knows that he has to make a quick,  calculated decision. This could be the moment that breaks the holding pattern.   He wants it to be that moment.  He DESPERATELY wants it to be that moment.
Greg was laughing. “Might do to close your mouth, John.”
She was smiling by the time she reached their booth. “You’ve got my pint, then,” she observed with her cultured American accent, and then, openly looking John up and down, extended her hand, smiled and said, “I wondered when we’d finally get the chance to talk, Dr. Watson.”
He stood and began putting his violin away.  It was no use trying to engage her when she was done with him.  There was nothing he could say or do that would get her to even acknowledge him once she signaled that she was done.  Still, he always turned to her, hoping that she would respond when he told her goodbye.  That she would act at least a little human.
A month later, while John was taking an overnight shift at A&E (his first in quite a while), Sherlock returned from survielling his suspect to find Mycroft resting in John's chair, a fire going, drinking tea from a china teacup.
“Yes, with all those times you spied on me in my lab, I figure you’ve gotten quite an eyeful by now,” she smirked. “Took Molly getting us to a pub at the same time to finally get to chat with you.”
Sherlock waited for the harsh buzz that signified that he should push open the door to the visitor’s intake at Sherrinford High Security Hospital for the Criminally Insane.  He removed his Belstaff and belt, opened the violin case, removed its contents and placed them in the waiting tray.  Removed his shoes and turned his trouser pockets inside out. Stepped through the metal detector, which would not go off as he was careful to not wear any metal other than the belt buckle, which was currently being scanned by the stern-faced prison matron in the x-ray machine.  Stepped to the side and put his arms out to the horizontally, spread his legs for the wand check.  On randomly chosen days he was subjected to a cavity search; it seemed today he would be spared that indignity as the prison matron signaled that he could pack up his violin case and proceed to check-in.
Remember, PWP is an awesome tag, but this isn't a PWP.
John shook his head in amazement, biting his lower lip. Closed his eyes and took a breath. Further composed himself.  When he opened his eyes to look at her again, his shock was gone, and the hunger was in his eyes again. “I cannot say that I have,” he answered.
Why wouldn’t she just speak?
Sherlock stood and turned his back to her.  Pinched his nose.  Stifled the roaring anger in his head.  Tried to clear the rush of blood that he heard in his ears.  Breathed.  He could feel her stare, her little grin.  Could feel the vicious glee in her triumph.
“Of course it does, John!”
“Of course,” Molly insisted, continuing, “all the same babble: she’s gorgeous and has a ridiculously high IQ.  Greg can’t get over it.”
"I simply haven't - yet.   No need - and when I've thought I might want - well,  it's unrequited,  isn't it?"
but this is John,  and he knows what Sherlock is capable of,  that Sherlock can manipulate as easily as he can breathe.   Sherlock's got to make him know,  somehow,  that this isn't a manipulation; it's an invitation that John can either accept or deny.  He's got to be subtle and yet intentional.   He can't push John too hard,  or he runs the risk of John  fleeing.   So he smirks just slightly, a smirk only ever meant for John.  He locks eyes with John,  his cheeks suck in and,  with the slightest,  almost inaudible moan,  he sucks that round lolly all the way in,  holds it there,  and keeps sucking.  He's aware he has a slight blush as well  (all of the sudden his cheeks are burning - which was totally unplanned yet could work remarkably well in his favor).   He continues to lock eyes with John despite the overwhelming urge to look away,  to clear his throat like he's made a miscalculation,  to jump up and flee to the safety of his bedroom.
Her eyes were as blue as sapphire but there was melancholy in them.  She’d been there too.
"Thus,  me coming to the conclusion that it was unrequited.   That was your wedding reception,  was it not?"
When they reached the debriefing room, one of the prison lackeys came in and whispered into the psychologist’s ear.  He laughed irritably, shaking his head.  Looked at Sherlock.
The game was afoot.
He often wondered what she did when she was deemed too dangerous, when the control room shut her off from her visitors.  Did she sit, frighteningly calm, sure of herself, or did she rage, pound on the glass, demand she have her prey back?
Sherlock did know about that spark. He did know how it made absolutely no practical sense. He'd felt it with The Woman, and that had been completely nonsensical. A lesbian pining after a gay man? And he, who had never had anything in the way of feelings for another woman, he had become quite enamored with Irene Adler. He'd put his life in danger to save her and would do it again without hesitation.
They both had their individual styles.  Sherlock suspected that to the casual observer the music that they played to each other would seem similar or maybe even the same.  He, however, heard the differences in how she played – how she put extra vibrato on certain phrases, how she lengthened or shortened notes that he would play differently.  How she put different emphasis on expressions than him.  Interestingly, as she played to him today, she was mimicking his style, something that she had never done.
After just one ring, it gets picked up.
The man hums, self-pleased.
"Yes, ahem, would you like to...? Let's move the dinner table and make some space."
, now?"
"Sherlock!!"
They both laugh at his quip, and John pops an eye open. The sunlight’s after-image takes a second or two to vanish, revealing a bare-chested Sherlock and,
“Yeah, right. Would you do that
He stands up and turns the kettle on, all the while reviewing the odd call. “A case”, the man had mentioned. Murder. Kidnapping. Cocaine? The stranger had sounded quite strung up: was he high on something?
“... What?”
He lowers his eyes and sees it. His dressing gown. Right at his groin. Tented.
He tries to imagine what he could look like. His mind makes up a vague silhouette of an elegant man, all refined gestures and pretty features, a hint of cologne, a glimpse of pale skin - essentially, what can be as distant as possible from the tanned, rough chaps he’s entertained himself with during his time in the army.
Ridiculous non-sense. He mustn't let such absurdities distract him. Sherlock turns on his heels and exits the courtroom - there must be a place to quieten down this turmoil. The insect-like clues follow him.
"Half an... What? Why,
Christ. The man could belong on a magazine cover.
Pale, tense, his forehead beaded with sweat: Sherlock is either on the verge of vomiting or - in layman’s terms - scared shitless.
"Well, thank you."
“Not exactly. Could have been, in the old days, but not tonight.”
“Hey, here you are, at last! And this is Diane, Jamie’s mom.”
The other end rings one, two, three times. The call gets disconnected.
It’s quite impressive to see Rosie this excited, this early in the morning. The same Rosie who, on any normal day, hogs their bed until late and has to be bribed into getting up with the promise of pancakes.
“Here, take this.” He set out to go back inside.
Sherlock scoffs and mumbles under his breath: “Mpfh. That’s because it’s not the nearest school -”
“Please be still, sir.
“DON’T MOVE HIM!” John shouted, and in a flash he was checking the injured’s pulse, barking around an order to call an ambulance, applying pressure to the wound – he was completely focused and swift, working on auto-pilot as it was engraved in his bones by military action.
, now?
Mrs Hudson is shoving it in his face. "Come on, Sherlock. It is
“Gag gifts. Truly charming. You know I didn’t
"...What." John braces himself for whatever absurdity is coming his way.
deductions.”
John curses under his breath, his mind going astray at the sudden image of a bottle of lube.
“What… what are you even doing?”
She smiles warmly at him, instead.
“Go on, you drink that one.” John noticed she looked rightly shaken. She’d not anticipated such an eventful morning, of course.
Sherlock forces himself to regain some composure.
John met Sherlock’s piercing eyes in the mirror, all at once feeling very closely observed.
The man stops talking, and a distinct noise reaches out from the other end of the line: the sharp “click” of a tube being uncapped.
His imagination was right about the pale skin and pretty features, but evidently fell short on all other accounts. No way it could have come up with those sharp cheekbones and tousled dark curls. A pair of sea-green, piercing eyes look into the camera, and the man’s plump lips - a work of art, with that perfect cupid’s bow - are slightly open apart in an inviting display of want.
John’s face lights up, as though a whimsical idea is making its way in his mind.
“Gérard”, Sherlock addressed the tailor with nonchalance, and the man peeked through. “Would you please check the heating? It’s very warm in here.”
? Must be awfully expensive, too.”
would be an accurate term.
. John lifts his gaze, resolute, and finds a deer-eyed, flushed, incredibly perfect Sherlock.
"Sherlock!!"
“Yeah, we’ve already talked about this, love. I know, but - “ John pauses for a moment in search of the right words, “ - we really, really must go now, if we want to be there on time.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes: “I wasn’t... examining the snow.”
- and turned on his heels.
John's body automatically responds by finding a new center of balance.
Sherlock stared at him with a questioning look.
He gets cut off by a roaring laugh, followed by a matter-of-fact question.
He actually makes for a very good teacher, attentive and thorough as he gives John precise directions, his exposition refreshingly punctuated with poetic analogies.
He cocked his brows up, as if to ask her to go on.
– not what he pictures when thinking of tango.
"Mpfh...what?" John replies in a dazed state.
He gently taps on John's spine, right between his shoulder blades, then at his sternum, readjusting him ever so slightly to a standard he doesn't care to share.
"John."
John is dancing by his own at the center of the room, his arms up in the air in front of him, embracing an imaginary partner. Sherlock has insisted on cheking out his form, and now watches him meticolously, his eyes following each of his steps with intention, his voice the only sound guiding him along.
The whole range of the picturesque humanity from this rustic side of the world parades before his eyes: flocks of loud teenagers, families desperately trying to herd their snotty toddlers, gangs of boisterous drunken men and broods of tacky matrons. Regardless of their age and class distinctions, they’re all engrossed in the same activities: eating and drinking copiously, laughing and talking at an appalling volume,
Now that the earlier irritation has vanished from the man’s voice - and what a voice, he has - John can hear him practically purring out his words. He settles on his bed, half slouched on top of the covers.
. Glittery confetti fall from somewhere above.
, a pinched expression on his face.
delete the solar system, don’t you?”
John stares at his phone for a moment too long than needed.
The music dims out for a moment, and John wonders if it's ending already, but then it picks up again in a surge of fervor, the piano and the violin conversing in a duet of ascending intensity; Sherlock's pace becomes more energetic, back and forth in a fast succession of steps that pull John into an entrancing chase. Then they slip again into a soothing
“Yes, that. How close have I got, Captain Watson?”
"Wait," Sherlock's interjection stops him in his tracks, "you didn't even break a sweat."
"John."
John’s cheeks heated up at the unexpected compliment.
Holding John’s gaze in the mirror - a mischievous look in his eyes - Sherlock started nibbling at his jawline, and John feared all the pins would pop at once.
- it's like they're floating on the floor, John realizes, and all at once he grasps the elegance of this tango. Sherlock's lips begin mouthing foreign words:
" Sherlock demonstrates by slowly inhaling and exhaling with him. "Excellent. Now, can you recall the steps?"
men, alike.”
Mrs Hudson is shoving it in his face. "Come on, Sherlock. It is
Sherlock’s eyes go wide as saucers. He sucks in air in an aroused gasp and crashes down on him.
“It mattered because of the work, of course, and it mattered because of who was on the other end of the line. I won’t ever forget your face when you realized, you know? That child. You had to save him, and you did.”
“That day… you had claimed you didn’t care for astronomy. That it didn’t matter if we went around the sun or the moon. But then… you damn well paid attention, and remembered about the Van Buren supernova. Because it suddenly mattered, didn’t it?”
“Uhm.” The stranger seems disappointed at the revelation.
Rosie has caught sight of one of her friends from the playground and wiggles out of John’s hand-hold.
The weird thing is, the door doesn't lead back to the hallway. A cozy kitchen opens up before him. Mrs Hudson's kitchen, to be more specific, and there she is as well – warm motherly expression, coiffed head, apron, the works.
Hardly fun, if he had the guts to admit it.
“Timmy!”
Sherlock instructs, and John raises his gaze to meet a pair of sea-green, welcoming eyes. Sherlock nods on the tempo, leading him effortlessly into a last sequence.
He pointed at the snow. “Chop-chop...
John cocked his brows up at him, and Sherlock reprised, mouthing almost silently:
The corridor unravels before his eyes, new rooms coming into existence as he moves forward. His head is throbbing, his palms are sweaty. One of the doors on the left emits a faint glow, as if to call his attention. A shiny etched plate spells: "TOILET".
"Err... yes. Right. I'm not even asking how you know. And?"
“It’s made of vicuña, the rarest and softest wool in the world. And thus, the most expensive, too.”
He shrugged.
“What I’m
“ ‘Piss off.’ ”
“Papa is... alright, dear Watson. Come here.” She climbs on his knees, and he clutches at her like a kid to his comfort blanket.
“Gag gifts. Truly charming. You know I didn’t actually delete the solar system, don’t you?”
He stands up and pads to the bedroom. John's asleep and breathing with his mouth open; he nudges his shoulder.
“Go on, you drink that one.” John noticed she looked rightly shaken. She’d not anticipated such an eventful morning, of course.
A few moments of silence pass, and John uses them to undo his flies and pull down his jeans and pants just enough to get some relief.
When the music ends, John realizes that he's shaking and that Sherlock is supporting a good part of his weight. They stay still for a moment, both panting. Both sweaty.
“Oh… I have no doubt you’d be able to, John. But you have no choice but to listen to me, don’t you? I can hear you’re really wired up, by now.”
"First thing first," Sherlock approaches him with his hands clasped behind his back and what must be his best
“And the shawl lapel... it outlines your neck beautifully.” Sherlock’s fingers moved to the fabric’s edge, brushing against John’s skin. “What a
As the music starts again, they’re promptly engulfed into the revolving stream of people; John leads, puffed up because of his recent practice at this particular flavour of dance.

Silence is all he gets back.

, even - utterly passed out and blissful.
"Yeah... yes. It actually kinda makes sense now, you know?" John chuckles.
Sherlock offers him an unconvinced, tight-lipped smile. The fifteen-minute walk has done little to calm him down, and a nagging thought still sinks its nails in his mind: what if?
John sighs and sits on his chair, a questioning look worth a thousand words on his face.
The mischievous idea had struck him in the middle of the night, when he had to get up for a brief trip to the bathroom.
“Ready?”
The jumper he was wearing was very soft and warm, one of his favourites for sure, but it was just… that. A cable-knit jumper.
No way he’s going to let Sherlock get the better of him, he decides, and in one last flash of genius before his head will go light, he thrusts his hips up and - as he lets out a concerted growl of want - he ruts hard against him, his hard-on now evident under the flimsy layer of his pants, and eagerly pressed on Sherlock’s.
“Wait, I don’t even know your name.”

a tad overwhelmed. It's like that first time, all over again: he can suddenly feel
“And you believed you were calling a certain ‘Samantha’”, the other man continues, “Not a girlfriend; unlikely to call one at that hour, and you being in that state. A friend maybe - but, no; you didn’t have her number saved or correctly memorized - so, an acquaintance from the past, perhaps someone amenable for a casual encounter of sexual nature, a… what do you call it?”
Wrong, wrong.
"Yes. Positive. Now shut up."
“Yeah, right. Would you do that
The next morning, John was up already, sipping from his cup of tea, when he heard some shuffling coming from the bedroom, then an audible gasp. He barely suppressed a giggle: his plan was coming together.
!” The man’s positively shouting into the phone, and John flinches. “You know? Murder? Kidnapping? I’ll take
He had hoped it was just a gross stereotyping, but the wild gesticulation that punctuates their - surely trivial - discourses would be enough to give him a headache. The small bar table he’s seated at is a sticky mess and - oh god - are those two youngsters snogging?!
Theoretically speaking, his waltz lessons are over, so he can't even fool himself with that excuse as he types on his phone.
“Papa?”
“Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other. Your living situation sounds unacceptable for a man of your caliber, and before you ask me, I can tell you are located in London because of its absolute highest percentage of government-issued bedsits, and the horrible traffic noise coming from your window. You see, I’m in London, too.”

He saw Sherlock getting up and taking the few steps that separated them, coming to stand right at his back.
“How do you feel about the violin? I play the violin when I’m thinking. Sometimes I don’t talk for days on end.”
Sherlock's hands on the small of John's back are grasping his shirt. "I'm sorry, I should have anticipated... the peculiar effect of tango."
The thought of the first dance with the bride, a mandatory tradition that will be featured at his wedding, got him worried at first; but it's his fifth lesson and his steps are starting to show some boldness, at least.
would require more attention he's lavishing it with, as of lately. He even made sure to have a light dinner, earlier, if only to make John shut up about it. Is his mind failing him? And what's this muted
John is quite sure this extraordinary man will tease him to death.
“You see,” John reprised while enveloping Sherlock in a hug, “at first it was just meant to be a silly present, but there’s more to it.”
"My point is, an additional half an hour wouldn't kill you."
Wrong, wrong.
“And that was when I knew,” John continued, “that as much as you loved showing off that big brain of yours, you had a way bigger heart.”
“Papa?”
The oldest slice of society - and by “old”, you must picture:
Sherlock nestled closer into John, his lower lip pouted as he recalled that fateful day.
The man has spoken quickly and clearly, with just a tinge of amusement in his voice. John has never heard anyone so much “in his right mind”.
, now?"
"Uhm, yes, I guess I'm getting the gist of it."
“Right.”
– why, why, why is it so difficult to focus in his mind palace, today? A surge of upset inundates him. He might as well face the irritating, noisy cluster of evidence that's waiting for him outside.
Rosie lets out a screeching “Yeeeeah!” and sprints towards him, ending with a pirouette that makes her skirt fan out. She’s so cute in her new uniform, a red sweatshirt with the school emblem embroidered in white; Sherlock can’t appreciate it in due manner, right now, though.
The italian words rolled out beautifully on her tongue, but it didn’t help make him any less oblivious on the matter.
“I’ll be back,” he said.
I was.”
John is staring at him again,  mouth hanging open -again,  face going through too many emotions (again). This goes on for a bit longer than Sherlock had anticipated (he'd calculated 3.6 seconds,  tops,  but they're well past the ten second mark when John finally speaks again).
As John leaves that evening to return to the house he now shares with Mary, best man now confirmed, the thoughts and doubts he has been denying spring to the front of his mind. Not for the first time, does John realize how wrong this all feels. Yes, by proposing he is making a promise to Mary. He is promising to love and care for her, but it all feels so dishonest. Marriage is the ultimate sign of love and devotion, but how can he truly love Mary fully when Sherlock is alive? He only started dating Mary to begin with as a distraction.
(See the end of the chapter for
That night, as Sherlock was curled around John sound asleep, John lay staring up at the ceiling with a smile on his face. The blogger lay remembering the course of the day. He gently touched his lips as he remembered inexperienced ones against his own. Although, his brow furrows once he remembers that he had meant to discuss some things with Sherlock. He had said some pretty hurtful things to Sherlock today, and the look he had given John when he had said them bordered on melancholic. This conversation was definitely not over.
“Yeah. Tinsley is beautiful, she's kind, she's quite accomplished but, I don't know, Sherlock, it just wasn't there. Everything was incredibly stilted and uncomfortable and the conversation was, for lack of a better word, painful.” John laughed to himself and said, “Quite frankly it was one of the worst dates I've ever been on, and I'm relatively certain she felt the same.”
“You know, Sherlock, sometimes people just don't mesh. Sometimes, for reasons that we can never figure out, it just doesn't work. That spark isn't there, you know? But it was a step in a good direction. And I want to thank you for that.”
Sherlock smiled to himself and then turned his head infinitesimally toward Mycroft.
John stepped out of the rainy twilight into the warmth of the pub.  Truthfully, he preferred the rainy walk to the cacophony of the pub, but it had been a while since he’d taken LeStrade up on an offer to join the Yarders and he’d realized that he missed Greg, that he missed the in your face brashness of Sally, he even missed the complete incompetence of Anderson.   So here he was, grabbing a pint with his mates.
Sherlock never had friends outside of his blades. Each insult hurled his way caused him to become reacquainted with his poisonous friends. He hates himself and now he has decided to end it. At age 19 Sherlock takes out his razor blade and cuts as deep as he can. He can feel the blood oozing out of the deep incision and he laughs. He finally feels relief. He finally believes that it will all be over, but right before he passes out he hears his name being called. Sherlock couldn't really care at this point and closes his eyes with a deep satisfied smile.
) until Mycroft cuts in: “Excellent! Now, Sherlock, go grab a few things, and then we will be off.” As Sherlock reluctantly goes to comply, John follows him into their bedroom.
I hope you enjoy this chapter! As always, happy reading!!!
He began by searching the internet on
: QueenLadyAnne, my extremely wonderful and helpful beta, and the ever so lovely Ariane DeVere (Linke here: http://arianedevere.livejournal.com/) for creating such a wonderful transcript to go by. I appreciate both of these lovely human beings.
"Sherlock! Love, wake up!" The snoozing consulting detective instantly stills and the arms around John's waist disappear. When the good doctor can finally turn around, Sherlock has sat up, a faint blush has spread across his high cheekbones, and he refuses to look at John. "I-I'm sorry John. I shouldn't have done that." The embarrassed detective slowly makes his way up and then turns to leave until John reaches an arm out and drags him back into bed.
,’ appears before his eyes.
Than to nurse your wounds to heal.
John looks truly baffled. The tears have finally stopped and Sherlock looks at John in cool defiance. He is ready for the confirmation that will end his entire relationship. He tries to convince himself that he doesn't need John but there is proof to the contrary burning beneath white wrapping.
There is no way that Mary should know any of that. He doesn’t want to believe that the woman he once married could be Moriarty, but suddenly it all makes sense. The fact alone that she has a past of being an assassin is proof enough that he never really knew her. John’s face turns dark and angry as he realizes that the woman he thought he knew is completely gone. Out of the corner of John’s eye, he sees Sherlock’s breathing changes and his hand twitches as if to say, ‘
Love conquers all.
that there is something else seriously wrong that has nothing to do with being undercover. Deep down, although he would never admit it out loud, he knows that it has something to do with him. It doesn’t take a genius to realize that the timing is no coincidence. John’s no longer at Baker Street. The flat is cold and empty and Sherlock is alone once more. Without being told in so many words, John knows Sherlock’s life is a lonely one. He had admitted on several instances that John is his only friend.
Sherlock confidently replies, “I want to stay with John.”
Disclaimer: I don't own Sherlock.
Sherlock snorts again and mumbles, "No, just...marriage." John blinks up Sherlock when continues, "A wedding is, in my considered opinion, nothing short of a celebration of all that is false and specious and irrational and sentimental in this ailing and morally compromised world."
At that, Sherlock’s entire body goes rigid and his eyes turn to steel.
He bitterly thinks to himself. When the doctor does come and reassure John's growing worry he rushes to Sherlock's room.
"Greg wanted to know when you would be coming back into Scotland Yard. I told him it would be a couple of weeks at least."
thread with his eyes, and noticed that the same red cord was attached to the shattered man just a few feet away from him. He closed his eyes briefly, but when he opened them again the threads were gone.
It was all very logical. It had to do with the amniotic fluid escaping into Marideth’s body which then caused all of her organs to begin failing. The doctor told of Marideth’s brave sacrifice. She gave her own life to bring her son into the world. Everything made sense. Geoffrey could follow and understand everything the doctors were saying. This, however, did not stop the all-encompassing sense of grief and rage he felt at his wife’s premature death. What was he to do now? His wife is gone. He now has to raise two children on his own.
to insinuate he doesn’t care about you?” In this moment John can see why he is labeled the ‘Ice Man’, every word is laced with icy bitterness and spite as he continues with, “Not to mention all the other deplorable things you said to him. You have no idea what he’s gone through, Doctor Watson. You have no idea the pain he’s gone through to make sure you could remain happy.” The man once again tries for indifference, but it sounds too forced as he quietly says, “You’ve had your fun, but now I think it’s time for the games to end.”
I hope this makes sense! I hope it all will come together in the next chapter. Sherlock will return and the rating will possibly go up (I haven't decided yet). The boys are now finally confirmed as soul mates :D
I've finished this story completely long before season 4 aired. What that means is that this is not season 4 compliant. However, what this does not mean is that you will get chapters any quicker than you are getting them, which I am terrible sorry for, but my betas and I all have lives that we must attend to and thus, we can't get these out any quicker than they are coming. I hate to say that, and I am sorry if that sounds terribly mean, but with school starting once more, I will have very little time to make corrections and the like. I hope you like the story, though! As always, thank you to QueenLadyAnne, CCwritessometimes, and Hateya W. These lovely betas all work with me to make this story into something I believe is special. I hope you like it! We will try to post Saturdays, but like this week, sometimes that just won't happen.
"John."
When the pair withdraws, Sherlock’s bowtie was, once again, askew. The consulting detective’s face was set in a firm scowl as he moodily repositions his bowtie for what seemed like the hundredth time that morning. “I hate these horrid things,” Sherlock grumbles. John walks up to his moody fiancé and gently places a chaste kiss against his cheek and whisper, “I think you look beautiful, love.”
Backstory to the true villian.
It was not long after that the wedding preparations began. He could honestly care less about the bride’s maid’s dresses or accent colors or whether the napkins are folded as a swan or as the Sydney Opera House. You would think that considering that this day is meant to be the happiest, most important day of his life, he would care more, but you would be mistaken. Only his resolve and the mantra of ‘
Sherlock comes home
"I hope he isn't talking about a case. Greg knows you aren't allowed to leave yet! Doctor's orders." When the blogger has finished speaking, he sits down in his own chair and looks at his threadmate over the rim of his mug. Sherlock smirks slightly before replying, "No, I just wish to head down to the Morgue soon to run some tests. Molly has a few severed feet for me."
She reprises in a scolding tone: "Sherlock, dear. You have to take care of yourself, don't you realize? Here, have some cake – or would you prefer a
A break from this overwhelming plight sounds inviting, so he pushes the door - the hinges squeak - and the washroom welcomes him in. It's cooler in there, and he catches his breath, resting against the white tiled wall. The clues have stayed back, at least.
John gestured at the snow build-up at their feet and all around them. The damned snowplow had done a number on the pavement in front of 221B, and they should shovel it for Mrs. Hudson to come out of the house without breaking a leg.
“A bespoke suit is
“Right. Bold of you to sport it for such a job, then. You must be a brave man!” She let out an unnerved chuckle.
“Obviously, John. I wouldn’t send her to a

is there nonetheless.
“Obviously, John. I wouldn’t send her to a catholic school.” Rosie wriggles in his arms, visibly distressed by the quarrel.
"Now, now, now." He talks to himself out loud, as he taps his chin with restless fingers. "Your recent progress calls for the right piece of music. Something... something
"Good. Thanks, I mean," he replies, and starts looking for his jumper and his wallet, ready to part ways.
"John. I know it's 2 in the morning, but..."
John yawns and rubs his eyes. "My...
He shrugged.
“So,” John clears his throat, surely hoarse from the night’s shouting and drinking.
The music darkens to low notes and Sherlock takes advantage of the subtle change to close the gap between them. There's a stronger grab in his arms, a fiercer push in his core – John can neither offer resistance nor back down: he has to match him with equal transport, their legs caught in a concerted scuffle, like two opponents measuring each other.
; that, even he can tell.
- and turned on his heels.
There's something fishy with this newly-formed room, though. The three stalls in front of him have no doors, for starters. And there are holes in the separating walls – one for each, perfectly round, and at crotch's height.
“Oof”, he huffs, “Bloody. Hell.”
"...and eight." The song comes to its end – it was a short one - and Sherlock stalls, a very confused John still between his arms.
"If dance is communicating," he tells as they slide repeating again and again the set of eight steps, "tango is like writing a letter, with commas and periods. Don't rush, John. Did you know that the Pope banned it in 1913? Don't look at your feet."
John extends his hand. “John. Nice to meet you... and this is Sherlock.”
vacation to the remote countryside of Italy - with this very argument: he’d get bored or restless and definitely ruin it. In the end, John has pressed him to accept, and he’s the reason Sherlock finds himself in this predicament.
Sherlock has to speak over Rosie, who’s idly playing with his curls.
He's got an inkling that Sherlock had actually
"No. Yes! I mean... I didn't expect you to lead."
“John.” Sherlock called him, “I lied.”
John finds himself mirroring Sherlock's movements, their legs sliding together as they were interconnected by an invisible twine, their bodies silently talking to each other by means of touch. A light nudge of Sherlock's fingers on the small of his back suffices to tell him which direction to go, the gentle pressure of Sherlock's chest against his marks pauses and rests. Commas and periods.
He made an added effort not to move a muscle - maybe that would speed things up - only managing to get too stiff, already feeling a cramp creep up from the back of his calf.
John looked at her, then, a bit lost, at his own clothes. He wasn’t dressed much differently than usual. The jumper he was wearing was very soft and warm, one of his favourites for sure, but it was just… that. A cable-knit jumper.
He saw Sherlock lifting his gaze briefly to meet his in the mirror.
“You know, it’s a passion of mine. High-end italian fashion.”
A break from this overwhelming plight sounds inviting, so he pushes the door - the hinges squeak - and the washroom welcomes him in. It's cooler in there, and he catches his breath, resting against the white tiled wall. The clues have stayed back, at least.
John bursts into a belly laugh, throws his head back, apparently amused to no end.
"Yes?"
When the song ends, they regroup and the couples get reshuffled, the ladies looking for their respective partners or a new one to invite over.
“Your living quarters. Your current situation.”
“And looking for a flatmate, if you’re open to the offer.”
“What… what do you mean? It was a gift, yes. Why?”
The stranger snorts. “That’s not what people usually reply.”
It’s all so… natural and easygoing. The small talk doesn’t put him off, for once, and Rosie, over there at the school’s playground, is making friends already.
The shorter of the ladies is trying to communicate something, and what they lack in shared vocabulary, she makes up for with enthusiasm. John pays his undivided attention but, of course, doesn’t understand much - until she points with her full palm at Sherlock, then waves her hands in a circling motion as if to simulate the movement of the dance.
“Oh - fuck, yes - oh, Christ! -” He shouts into the phone, as he rides his orgasm.
“Medical discharge,” John specifies, “I got shot.”
John feels warmth pool in his groin at the thought of that brilliant mouth, and how it could be put to work. His hand trails down his belly again: his hard-on attracts it like a magnet and requires attention
The tailor excused himself with a polite nod, and John started turning around, but Sherlock stopped him.
“Here, take this.” He set out to go back inside.
His train of thoughts must be written on his face, because Sherlock continues without waiting for a reply.
“You’re a man of action."
“I… I may have to wash
“Ready?”
Oh...
. This damn tango has wired him up and utterly destroyed him, all in the space of three clock minutes.
A lingering apprehension in his look, he glances at Sherlock, who lets out a timid “Hi” and expects to see some sort of… confusion, or veiled questioning in response.
“And, well,” she continued, “good thing you had rolled up your sleeves.”
“And you invaded Afghanistan.”
“Please, Dr. Watson. Do go on and tell me about it.”
“What? Oh. How
“John. Stay right there.”
There's something fishy with this newly-formed room, though. The three stalls in front of him have no doors, for starters. And there are holes in the separating walls – one for each, perfectly round, and at crotch's height.
“Uhm, do you really want to know?”
"Mpfh...what?" John replies in a dazed state.
John’s voice comes out hoarse.
“You called at 2 a.m., after having indulged in a considerable quantity of alcoholic beverages.”
Because John Watson is, at the moment, having the time of his life.
“Come on. We’ll be fine.”
Sherlock nestled closer into John, his lower lip pouted as he recalled that fateful day.
“Hello?”
Sherlock flops into his chair and exhales, undoes the first button of his shirt (then changes his mind and buttons it up again), restlessly taps his fingers on the armrest. He considers coming up with a sudden, unpredictable illness - which wouldn’t be that hard to fake, to be fair - when John comes out of the loo and into the sitting room.
She must have noticed his baffled face.
“If I recall correctly… about
useless, on top of that.”
Sherlock let out a grunt and padded towards him, then leaned down to stamp a peck on John’s lips.
finished.”
, John."
Suddenly, they hear a booming thunder over the loud music, and they feel what seem like the first drops of rain of a summer shower - but the dancers around them are apparently unfazed and they can’t break the collective rhythm, so they go on dancing. Sherlock pulls a questioning expression:
He was just about to come up with a reply to get rid of the woman and go back to his work, when a loud crash coming from the street startled them.
“Papa! It hurrrts!”
Sherlock turns around and is quickly in front of him, his right arm around John's waist and his left hand propping up John's right to lead him. In the background, a violin has joined the guitar, and there's no time for John to process what's happening as Sherlock grabs him closer and shifts his weight, whilst simultaneously dumping on him a waterfall of incredibly fast instructions.
What if they grab the attention of some other parent? What if someone makes an ungracious comment about them - will he be able to restrain himself? What if some child mocks little Watson? What if she’s made to feel different from the other kids? What if -
A thought crosses his mind: what if the stranger can pick up what he’s doing? He surely can. Oh god, this is exciting. He wonders just for a second if he’s taking this too far, when he hears a rustle of fabric from the other end of the line, and the man resumes speaking.
"Very good, John, considering I didn't show you the steps in advance. A spur of spontaneity you shall forgive me." Sherlock's arms fall to his sides and he takes a step back from John, his demeanor seemingly calm and collected as usual.
“... the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever done.”
. As if his
She smiles warmly at him, instead.
He tried to counter Mycroft’s generous offer - an all-paid,
“He has been detained, Sherlock.  I knew that the only way I would have your undivided attention was if one Troy Albertson was taken out of the picture.  He is currently in the custody of the British Government where he belongs. Now back to the discussion at hand . . .”
He was fascinated with her.  She terrified him.  He was terrified of her power, of her ability to bring so many worlds crashing down on a whim.  He was terrified of what she would do if he left her.
He sees Mary get shot in his dreams.  No matter how hard he tries, no matter what he does to keep her going into that room, no matter how quickly he moves to save her, no matter how vigorously he tries to wrestle the gun from Vivian Norbury, she still gets shot.  Night after night after night.
He could See John again,  could Read him,  and John wanted it.  He was vibrating with it,  someone on the cusp of something he'd wanted with everything but wouldn't believe he had until he was holding it in his hands.
John's pupils: dilated.
Greg walked up to him with a warm smile. “Eh! There he is!  I wasn’t sure you’d make it; I’m happy that you did.”
He had forgotten how good he was at this.  ‘Not a time to get cocky now,’ he thought.  Not when he had a beautiful woman under his thrall, someone brilliant and quick with a comeback, someone sharp and more than able to play his game.
