“I still think about Mom and Dad,” sighs Dean.
“Sure, Gertie. Thanks.”
“It’s not bigger, but definitely more immediate for us...”
“Yeah, that’s what I’ve heard.”
Gadreel comes by from his perimeter check. Kelly tells him how she misses yawning and settling into a good nap, and he says that the closest he gets is focusing on the movement of time. Kelly looks unsure. Gadreel explains that it’s not human linear time, but the rivers and eddies that swirl around the space fabric like one finds in a liminal space. He thinks about it and taps her head to pass the thought. She nods and goes to the other recliner. Gadreel turns out the light and goes to heaven to check in.
“You forgave me for other things. Not for the pain you went through when I died again, and the damage to your relationship with Jack.”
“Hey, pancakes are almost done. Stick around and eat, you can take a shower after,” says Dean
“It won’t be long and you’ll see. But I’ll give you a hint. It’s one of my aunts.”
here. Look, I don’t care if Jack freezes Hell over and turns it into a ski resort with lines to get in — the idea of any of our family being in Hell is not something I can handle. It doesn’t mean that I want to have another happy family dinner yet, but I’ve made a home with Cas, my friends are close by, and no one is suffering.” Dean thinks about his father and grandfather Samuel and wonders when he’ll be ready. “Mom, things are good with you and me. I learned my lesson. Amara tried to tell me that I needed to get to know you as a person, and not as a saint on a pedestal, or an apple pie image. I shouldn’t have done that to you. It took me a long time to figure it out.”
“We’ve only been on vacation a couple days. What about the mountain scenery?” Asks Jack. Jeremy gives a signature dramatic groan, and startles a bit as Cas grabs his tripod so he doesn’t have to carry it.
“But I found it. I’ve got it ready, and it’s like 20 seconds.” Jack has that tone that indicates there’s a risk of a frowny face appearing, so Jeremy agrees to watch anyway, and graciously leaves out a dramatic eye roll and put out groan.
“He was editing the wheat Jesus pictures last night,” adds Jack.
“Of course” says Cas.
“Doesn’t hurt our being on campus,” says Alex. “All that privacy,”she teases.
Jeremy follows them back to the mudroom and discovers the intricacies of dog drying. They’re in there over half an hour when Sam comes poking his head in. Dean and Jeremy hold on to Miracle so he doesn’t zoom out the narrowly opened door.
“Oh my god, oh my god, is it what I think it is?” says Charlie leaning out of her seat.
“Hanging dry wall doesn’t sound like a small first project,” says Cas as Jody nods in concerned agreement.
There’s a whoosh sound, and Alex and Patience are in the kitchen. Everyone stands up as they run round the island. Alex announces, “Claire decked Jeremy for real, and he kicked her knee out! Snapped a PCL or LCL for sure.” Patience nods in agreement.
Sam pinches the bridge of his nose, and says, “Well, there is some logic to all that.”
“That’s what I like to hear. Grab a booth. I’ll be there in a minute.”
Sam snorts, “Like I haven’t seen you enjoy pizza and wings. Bring anything that has meat for Dean and Eileen, and maybe some soba along with the sushi and teriyaki.”
“You’re not vegetarian, right?”
“There’s just ooone wee thing.”
“You’re doing food pics?” says Dean, motioning to her phone.
“I wouldn’t fight Eileen for it, though,” warns Jack, but with a smile to show he’s not too serious.
Jack tells Dean, “I won’t be able to talk to her again until I die. I don’t remember if I saw her. Heaven felt like it happened so fast. I don’t remember everything…”
On Christmas morning, even though Jack’s curious about the presents, he and everyone else decide to have breakfast first. Jack, Sam, and Kelly don’t require morning caffeine to function, but everyone else either lines up at the coffee pot, or opts for tea, which Rowena oversees making. People are more huggy than usual, and everyone wishes each other Merry Christmas. Cas gets teary-eyed, which makes everyone except Kelly teary-eyed.
“Yeah I’m sorry. I guess I wasn’t paying attention,” Jeremy says.
“Sounds fun,” says Dean mildly.
Dean gives the sisters and Jack a normal amount of Champagne, except for Kaia who asks for just enough for one toast.
“I would. Oooh, whipped cream and chocolate syrup.”
“She probably has a sunny aura,”comments Jeremy.
“They were there one time, but it was mostly with Mary and Bobby and their friends. We should sleeping on the ground, and build a fire. There were little kids there and I remember doing a shadow puppet show for them. Sometimes there were buildings with dirt floors, that kept out the wind. In the morning Mary would give me a can of something to heat up, or maybe I’d share a protein bar with her.”
“I’m flattered. Does she do this much? Ask to say hello?”
“No, it’s not gender roles. It’s the perfectionism.”
“Ok, I’ll do that. I promise.” Jeremy pauses a moment. “Your uncle Gabe is named after him, right?
Sam blushes, and walks forward saying, “I’m coming. Find your sweater and we’ll get you ready in our bathroom.”
“Well, I don’t think Claire is going to try teaching me to fight again anytime soon. I haven’t figured out what I want to do either, but if it turns out to be accounting, the risk of injury is probably pretty low. And I promise to be careful in high-risk activities, like driving, or hanging out with Claire.” Jeremy smiles for effect, but Jack seems unamused.
“Their regrets will come with them, and they’ll learn from them. Heaven and Hell will change.”
The funniest bits are usually people running into doppelgänger’s.
“So are those both for you, or do I get one?” Asks Dean, stroking a hand down Cas’ arm in comfort.
“Suck up!!” taunts Claire, but with a smile.
“So there’s an angel named Castiel?
Sam blinks a bit, and says, “Uh, I never asked Cas, what is it with some angels and sweets?”
“You have a point there, but change is gonna come. There’s a lesbian holiday rom-com on Netflix.”
From the other side of the table Kelly looks at Cas awkwardly, nods at him, and then turns to listen to Jack talking.
“Bet he did it himself,” says Mel.
“He’s committing to spending more time with his son, so he’s moving to Kansas in January to be closer.”
Jeremy tries to take his tripod back, but Cas just gives him a pat on the back with his free hand and moves away.
“Thanks, Jack. Good choice,” says Cas, heading to the stairs. Even with his hands full of damp dog, Dean manages a flirty-look and a wink signaling to Cas that he didn’t mind the wet t-shirt at all. Cas just rolls his eyes at his husband and continues up the stairs.
“You’re adorable. You told me that yourself,”says Cas.
Both Jack and Cas answer saying, “Nathan.”
“She normally doesn’t want to meet anyone, but she likes to tell me what color people are on the inside — I mean made up colors,” the woman blushes apparently wondering if that came out offensive or weird or both.
Deans eyes narrow. “You want to explain that?”
“Solids are good ‘cause the backgrounds are going to be busy or have bright colors,”says Jeremy and for the first time on the trip he rolls his eyes at Jack’s parents. Dean smiles, pleased at the eye roll.
“Jack!” Kelly wraps her wings around Jack as Cas stands back, glimpsing the shadows cast on the snow. Jack is ecstatic to see her, and she holds him tight. Cas’ eyes can’t help but get a bit watery as he thinks of how much it means to Jack to have her here.
Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground -
“Thanks! This is great,” she says taking it from him. “Anyway, there was someone with the background we were looking for in St. Louis, but that didn’t pan out, so Mom and I left early for Denver. I’ve got to get back to the Tech Center for an appointment this afternoon.”
Dean asks, “So where did all our Queens go?”
“What’s that smile, Dean?” asks Mary.
(See the end of the chapter for
“There aren’t that many cleared to come down yet. Inias would drive Dean crazy fawning over Cas. Balthazar and I might be a bit much together and there
Sam gives Dean a death glare, but before things escalate, Arlette asks Dean about his pie order.
Miracle gets excited, barks a bit, and tries to follow, but Dean grabs him and says, “Hey, hey, boy. Slow your roll. Well, it’s too soon for a full dessert after that meal, but I think I’ll make some hot chocolate. They’ll get cold out there, and I’m pretty sure it’s something Kelly can taste.”
“I’m going to chauffeur,” Mel says with a smile, getting into the driver’s seat.
“Dean seems to be a very capable person,” Nat says. “Let’s get your car, and go to the hotel.”
“Yes!” said Cas before he was finished, and there was a titter of laughter and some “awws”. Dean somehow knew which one to slide onto Cas’ finger, and Cas slid the other on his.
Dean stands up and folds his arms across his chest. “So you’re just telling me this now?”
“The Road House group — Ash and Pamela, the Harvelles, and some others have become a council of sorts, running heaven for human souls, so fewer angels are necessary to assist humans,” says Kelly.
“Holy shit!” “That’s possible?” “Amara did that?”
“Then I should be fine,” says Gertie.
Dean’s heart is racing for no reason. Arlett is welcoming in Cas, and looking over to the booth
“Hi Aunt Rowena!” Jack bounds up and gives her a big hug. “Jack, you’re a handsome boy, but more importantly, you’re kind one,” says Rowena softly while they hug.
After that talk in the Impala, Jeremy’s a bit unnerved, but he promised Jack he’d take all the kitschy tourist photos he wanted, and it seemed the perfect way to get time using the DSLR, so he concentrates on setting up. It helps that Jack always seems able to change emotions quickly. There’s a trampled path and circle in the tall yellow grass where other tourists have stopped. He’s running around it letting Miracle chase and bark at him, with Dean jumping in to play-growl at Miracle occasionally, working the dog up to release his energy. Cas just watches them full of affection. Jeremy snatches a little of it in video mode, before yelling to Jack that he’s ready. Cas has Jack’s phone to take pictures on it, too.
“Arlette! Your music stopped.”
“Thank you, Kelly.”
“Time runs different here. I just meant to take a ride in Baby and gather my thoughts — think about what I wanted to say to him. Next thing I knew, I got out to look at the scenery and you were here.”
“Yes, I would like all that. Let’s see Kelly first. She will be so happy.”
Jeremy gives a wry half smile. “He said that it bothered her for while, but then she found out how popular he is.”
“Noooo, but he’s a dog.”
“That was all Jack and J. They found and picked out 3D shape patterns from four different sites, and I knew where to outsource the 3D printing to make it happen.”
Dean groans, and with tears spilling over says, “Get over here, Mom.”
Donna comes over and reports on dinner. “Hey, we’re about ready. I’m going to go get the kiddos.”
“You are devious, Alex,” Claire says, hugging the grumpy cat sweater with one hand, and tossing Alex the coyote one with the other.
“Nope. Mom’s vegan, so vegetable lasagna with sauce and cheese was something she made a lot of on the weekend as a compromise for me, even though she doesn’t do dairy. I was supposed to learn to cook for myself but that didn’t happen. She’s really organized about stuff like that — cooking for a week on Sunday. She made a lot of my stuff in advance.”
“Ok Sammy, we can stay. Good choice. Double-ovens!”
“Are you kidding? That was a joke. We’re boring Cas. Now that we’re retired we’re the boring middle-aged dads kids treat politely. We’re not going to inspire anyone to rebellion.”
“Lag shot?” She asks. Jack nods and calls Sam over to judge.
In this AU world, you'll see lots of names of people and beings who should be in Heaven, Hell or the Empty, who aren't where we left them. There's been a shuffle of location, and I hope to give some glimpses of how that happened in later chapters.
“We’re just a little late this morning and
“You do?”
“With Charlie?”
“Come here boy,” says Sam. He gives a sniff and looks at Dean. “He smells familiar.”
“So this trauma anniversary thing… Our plan for a big heaven Game Night brought it all back to you, huh? That’s why you’re here. We did it.” Mary just shrugs.
“I guess that’s a reminder that I’d better call my mom,” Jeremy says with sigh.
“Good job, Jack,” Claire says, wiggling her own feet that have thick slipper socks. “Catch a donut hole!” She throws one at his face, and Jack twists to catch it in his mouth. “Whoo!” Claire says as it goes in.
“Oh, hang on and let me talk to Charlie,” Sam steps back and motions for Charlie. “Hey, it’s Rowena. She wanted to know if she should go ahead and come.”
“Don’t judge me,” she says with a raised eyebrow and a hint of a laugh. “I’m behind in setting up a new IG.” Once everyone is seated, she says, “Jeremy, it’s great that we all have some time to spend with you while you have a free schedule — no classes or exams.”
“She loves it,” says Kaia, pouring more cider for herself and Patience.
“See ya, bitch,” says Dean.
Sam raises an eyebrow at Jack getting a Macleod tartan, but it’s clear Rowena takes being Jack’s aunt very seriously, and Jack may as well be a Macleod heir.
“I think my head is gonna explode,” Dean says.
“As close as we could get,” say the boys.
They decide not to force themselves to do everything, and settle on a few more: the coloring book area for Jack and a reluctant Jeremy; the happy face wall for Jack; the donut wall for Dean, Cas, Jack and Miracle; and the boys insist that Dean and Cas pose at the heart wall.
“The Ball of Twine was east of where we hit 70, and since we were heading to Denver we missed that one.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s just right for me,” Patience.
Sam looks uncomfortable. “Well, I can swim you know…,” seeing Dean’s exaggerated shaking head, he adds, “remember, you were the one who was better at sports, including swimming, when we were kids. I’m just exploring some new options.”
Dean makes a waving motion, as if to sweep the appreciation away. It’s still a little awkward between Dean and Sam, but without most of the earlier tension. Sam takes a hard look at Dean, and then exhales and says, “Ok, spill it. What else happened.”
“You’re just in time for baking,” says Cas.
“I am the Shadow. I am The Empty!”
Eileens smiles and says, “This is the last meal Sam and I plan on doing for the holidays. Dean can take over.”
Jack goes off to hug a new person, and Jeremy’s mouth might be open, because a different girl with long, wavy dark hair is staring at him with a concerned look on her face.
To Jeremy’s annoyance, Jack opens the car door before he’s come to a complete stop, so he says loudly, “Brah, rude!” He also grumbles, “I didn’t think the car would even let you do that,” as Jack runs out.
“Sure sweetie,” the waitress says with a smile.
“How did you guess that?” Jack looks shocked and he’s frowning.
“Understandable,” says Cas mildly. “We should let you eat.”
Rowena heads out. The rest watch the Mandalorian, with Jack, Charlie and Dean particularly excited. Claire and Jeremy migrate to the sofa at some point, falling asleep on each other. Kaia comments that with their blond hair they look like they could be brother and sister. Kelly takes a picture so Alex, Kaia and Jack can embarrass them later, but Cas and Dean ask her to send it to them, too. Charlie asks Kelly to whoosh her upstairs, which leads to the question of whether or not to whoosh Claire and Jeremy as well, so they don’t get woken up just to go to bed. Since Kelly has healed and blanked Jeremy, Dean, Cas and Kelly figure the angel line has already been crossed. Jack collects Jeremy’s laptop and finds Marvin squished under a sofa pillow. Kelly sends all the remaining young people to bed. Dean gives Kelly a hug, and Cas gives her a kiss on the temple. Dean and Cas then walk out leaning on each other.
“It’s akvavit instead of vodka.”
“I know, but I started, and I want to keep going.”
“coach-parent arguments…”
“He’ll be along after the seating bustle is over,” says Mel, unworried. She sidles up to Cas and Kelly. She says in an atypically soft voice, “He probably caught the feels. That’s one reason I can’t take him to the movies. He cries at just about everything, and doesn’t like people to see.” She shakes her head like it’s a trial she’s suffered for years; although, she does it with a smile. “He just has to think about something else for a few minutes. I’ll save him a seat.”
“Sammy, I get you’re trying to make the Winchester name and the Men of Letters something good. I respect you for that, but I’m out and staying out of all the Winchester family crap. Cas, if you and Sam want to figure out something to do with Henry’s money, fine. I don’t want to make any decisions about it, not ever.” He stands up and runs a hand over his forehead and through his hair. “Look, I’m going to take a nap before dinner. Just yell at us when it’s ready,” he looks to Cas. “Unless you want to stay?”
Jack spots something and motions them over. “Oh, this is cool. I saw this one online. The bed is attached to the wall so when you walk on the floor, you can look like you’re walking on the walls, or jump and look like you’re falling.”
Jack’s disembodied voice says, “I dropped my phone.”
Cas pulls up Sam on his phone, and puts it on speaker. After quick hellos, they run through the plan.
Jack asks, “Nat as in Jeremy’s dad?!”
Alex huffs at him and says, “Enough talking. Just rack up.”
“No problem. It’s not even really a hack. I’m just asking nicely for their system to let me buy a ticket.” She flexes her fingers,“And I’m very persuasive.”
Before the third game, Jack and Claire both sigh. They smile at each other and Jack says, “I think it just depends on the break.” Claire nods in agreement.
“We’ve all been through a lot and wanted to celebrate,” says Jody. “It wasn’t too bad.”
“It’s good. Maybe a little on the light side for christmas,” says Alex. “I’m more of an eggnog girl.”
I hope you're here for the slice-of-life stuff, because there's a lot of it.
“The trouble that you had with Dean, that happened when she passed away, didn’t it?”
“Yes, m’am!” Dean says releasing Claire right-side up and running over.
“Do you need an aspirin?”
BANG!
“It’s heaven. It can’t hit
“That sounds terrible.”
“Who? Your mom?”
“It looks like someone could do a cooking show here,” says Jack.
“I don’t carry him that much,” protests Dean.
“Your uncle — Michael — that’s an angel, too?”
Then suddenly Jack wasn’t there, but Amara was. She smiled and said, “I’m happy for you Dean.” She gave him a kiss on the cheek, looked over at Cas with an even bigger smile and said, “I felt the bond you two have a long time ago. I just didn’t understand it right away.” She clasped their hands together and it felt like a blessing of sorts. Then she turned and both she and Jack were gone.
“I knew you’d say that,” says Sam. Jeremy just shrugs. He imagines Huntercorp is probably a reference to the giant hunting and fishing stores that he sees every so often, like
Dean resumes looking at a map on his phone and makes a decision. “I’ve been thinking that we don’t want to get to the cabins in the dark, so maybe we should stay in Denver overnight. Then it will be a short final trip — maybe a couple of hours.
“What is it with you being surrounded by women with C names?”
“The number of Reapers has diminished, and they now collect people based on probability forecasts, since they don’t know exactly when everyone dies. Tracking billions of people keeps everyone busy,” says Gadreel. “It’s nice for the fates to have something challenging to do. Otherwise they get…unhappy.”
Cas gives another softer laugh and a smile that crinkles up by his eyes. “So what do you you two have planned for us? You told me we were taking pictures, and I know we need to leave after checkout at 11.”
Gertie stirs some soba noodles and skims knitting patterns on her tablet at the end of the table opposite Sam, but is still attentive enough to push a platter a little closer to Charlie who passes it to Jeremy.
“I’m just happy everyone’s here,” says Jack sitting between Kelly and Cas.
“Kristen Stewart should dump her ass,” says Jeremy. “I get her not being out, but lying to Kristen that she was, and then asking her to pretend to be something she isn’t — it’s too much.”
“Gadreel whooshed us and I didn’t have time to get my phone out,” says Rowena. Cas raises an eyebrow at that. She gets a package out of a shopping bag Gadreel is carrying, and then Gadreel heads for the tree to put some other things down. Cas follows him and whispers some questions to Gadreel who looks stoic as he answers. Dean goes to the kitchen to start getting things out for the s’mores. Jack and Jeremy arrive, and Jack rushes up when he sees Rowena.
to look at Claire like she’s a completely suspicious character.
Dean says, “Well, I think that’s enough of that,” and picks up the dog. Cas helps Jack up and dusts off his fashionable and now dirty sweater and fusses over his hair.
Sure enough, Jack is out in about ten minutes, but Jeremy doesn’t feel weird calling Cas, who waves from the other car. They chat a bit about the music he and Jack have been listening to. Cas says he likes Lizzo and Beyonce best, but also Taylor Swift. Jeremy confesses that he’s heard Dean only listens to classic rock. Dean protests that he likes some new stuff, including Taylor, and then says it’s better than liking Celine Dion like his brother. That transitions to a couple stories about his brother and car trips involving farting and vomiting. His mom would hate it. He’s only driving a little over an hour, but he’s getting drowsy, too. He lets Cas know, and they choose a place to pull off. He’s expecting Cas to come drive his car, but instead it’s Dean, who has apparently watched videos about how to drive a Tesla and use the center screen, so he doesn’t have to explain anything. Cas drives Baby with Miracle in the passenger seat the last ninety minutes, and Jeremy sleeps in his own backseat.
Sorry this took a while. I made some changes to the tone of this chapter that had me cutting and rewriting sections I'd already done. It was a spur of the moment decision months ago that had me expanding the original small little Christmas exchange one shot to my first multi-chapter fic.
Cas takes over. “Jack, why don’t you and Jeremy see if Miracle needs some water? We’ll pay the bill and give Sam a call to let him know the schedule.” As the boys slide out of the both, Cas places a hand on Dean’s thigh just to ground him a bit. Dean nods at him and puts a hand on top of Cas’ to give it a squeeze.
“What’s changed? How are you able to stay?”
“I just was suffering from a little perfectionism. I’ll be fine next time,” argues Cas.
Sam leads them to the living room where Jody and Donna are simply themselves, but perhaps Rowena goes for being more gently welcoming than usual, and Charlie tries to be low key.
On the Road Again -
“I’ll hold you to that, Cas. Thanks for loving me enough to organize this circus.”
“NO. I just want to sleep.”
Eventually, they decide it’s time to go back in. Dean and Cas clean up the s’mores, while Sam and Eileen take care of the fire pit. Jack helps Jeremy take his tripod and camera set up inside.
Further into the movie, Jack looks concerned with Jeremy’s tight grip on the popcorn bowl. “You can hold Marvin,” he offers.
“Don’t get me wrong! Mom’s very nice until she isn’t.”
“I know, right?” Jeremy says.
super-Cabella’s or something.
“Guess you have a clue now,” says Jeremy.
“Should we go out there?” he yells back.
“Same,” says Jeremy.
“Those are your cousins at University of South Dakota?”
“None of us have a good track record with actual birth parents, so it doesn’t feel like there’s a normal out there. Maybe it’s all weird,” says Claire.
She whips out a paper floor map. “Because of our courtyard, some of the hallways are short. I’m putting you here, on an outside back wall with an arch on one side. So far there’s no one at all on your side. I can’t guarantee it will stay that way, but if we get to your floor, we’ll start fill-in for the night on the opposite side of the hallway, where the boys will be. Due to storage, this side of the hall starts rooms a little further down. So their room will be almost two rooms down from yours and opposite side. Again, I can’t guarantee you won’t have a neighbor if we have a run at night, but you have good odds and,” she pauses looking at Cas again, “obviously you’re a lucky man.” She slides over the map and the key card with a sly smile, and then makes out another for the boys’ room.
“I know, I know.”
“Hello,” he says.
“Sometimes I am,” says Alex with a smile. “I guess it’s different kinds of strengths. Being smart enough to know how you — or anyone —
“Oh now, that’s not fair. We all know that your wonderful meals can make a stack of dishes,” says Donna. “And Jodes and I want to make a couple of casseroles for Christmas Eve dinner.”
Jack catches Cas and Dean’s attention and mouths “parent mode.”
Soon everyone is enjoying pancakes, bacon and scrambled eggs. Kelly causes a stir by drenching her pancakes in maple syrup, and using a fork to push her bacon and eggs around until they’re covered in syrup, too. As they finish up, Sam looks at Eileen and she nods.
“Oh, it is a gift,” says Cas.
“On a Sunday? Really, Charlie. This sounds too nose to the grindstone.” Dean makes a grimace.
Donna and Jody go out to start the fire for s’mores. Charlie puts the tv on a crackling Yule log, and Sam reinstalls the smart speaker in a new location for Christmas music. The doorbell rings, and Miracle starts barking, running for the door.
After a little time, they’re brought to a half-booth, half-table in a semi-private room. Since they sit four on each side, Kelly sits herself next to Nat so Sam can sit across and not be in an awkward position for eye contact while talking.
“I did defrost the windows,” replies Kelly.
We need a couple field educators, but the staffing is minimal. I’ll still help Garth, Jody and Eileen with current hunters, but the non-profit will be my priority.
“There are still things that we don’t talk about — that we can’t talk about,” Jack says.
“I’m trying not to envision anything, but yes, I do worry about people getting hurt if Jack’s not ready. Regardless, we have to trust him.”
“I get that. I guess nowadays mistletoe is a consent issue waiting to happen. We’ll have to save it just for us next year. Here, turn around, let me do you.”
“After all that, looking at grades isn’t going to feel stressful at all. Pretty low on
Jody says, “So is this going to come up in family meeting after Jeremy leaves?”
“Might depend on whether you get a business degree or a BA.”
Warning for MK's wacky post-finale fix-it head canons.
They have time to kill while the Tesla charges, so they sit around the picnic table sipping drinks and chatting. Jack has a hot chocolate and Jeremy has indulged in something just as sweet looking, but with caramel. Although the wheat Jesus sign is within easy walking distance, Cas isn’t crazy about all of them crossing 25, so they’ll get into Baby to make the three-minute drive over. Since they got word of Jeremy’s seat belt question from Jack, as he walks the boys to Baby, Dean explains that the Impala came with just lap belts, because shoulder straps didn’t come out until the 70s. “I knew we’d have Jack on the road trip, so I installed shoulder straps in the back seat a couple weeks ago. The buckle is a little weird, but it retracts like normal.” As Jeremy slides in Dean continues, “Of course Jack’s ridden in this car a long time without them.”
Cas scrambles and wriggles the phone out of Dean’s pocket.
Tourist photography -- click, click
“What color am I?” asks Jeremy, joining in.
Rowena shakes her head a bit at Claire. “I imagine that you two will be moving on to the puffed cheese balls later,” she says with a smile.
“He was surprisingly aware of what was going on, even if he wasn’t looking. I saw him react to a couple things that you and Mel said,” says Kelly.
“Cas, our kid is a college freshman at four That’s bad enough. I’m just not sure if I’m ready for him to have a boyfriend or girlfriend.”
Mel’s smiles very big, and says, “I hope to get to know Jack better. He has a natural joy and pleasure in every day life, and it seems like he must get that from, you.”
“That was just hello! I wasn’t serious!” protests the girl.
“That’s fair,” says Jeremy, respecting her firmness.
Dean took another good look at Sam. “Did you have a good life, Sam? How long did you live after…I died? You don’t look any older.”
Dean pauses. “Am I that terrible?”
The more logical part of Jeremy’s brain explains to him that Claire and Jack were just playing. When Jack tapped her head it was him telling her he could have pulled her hair to break out of the hold, but didn’t. The less logical side seems to be highly suspicious of Claire. Jeremy’s eyes are still following her as she goes to Cas who embraces her and gives her a loving kiss on the head like she’s a precious toddler princess and not someone who gives dangerous wrestling holds as tokens of affection.
“I’ve got my pans seasoned just right. Not gonna leave that to chance,” says Dean perfectly serious.
“Thank you, Cas.”
“It’s really weird, isn’t it?”asks Jack with a scrunched up face.
Claire says, “You know, Cas gave me a grumpy cat from — she makes quotation marks with her fingers — ‘Hot Topical’ years ago…”
There's been a bit of a reboot from the canon finale, and Jack doesn't have God!powers or God!knowledge. He's a human being. Cas is also human.
Jody laughs and says, “Ok Sam, you’re forgiven.”
Cas smiles and sends it to Jack’s phone, and to the family group chat.
“Don’t be so serious,” Charlie says with a nudge. “But I did go ahead and put on all the files for you anyway.”
“Gadreel, remember, you can just call me Cas.”
“Definitely.”
“This car has seat warmers?” asks Cas.
“You say that almost every morning.”

There are exactly six pictures. There’s the one of Dean and Cas in the diner back in Lebanon, looking at Miracle, the sunlight coming in makes it fuzzy, soft, and unfocused. There’s the selfie of Jeremy and Jack on the mountain when they went tubing with squinting and smiling and the sunlight making rays across them. There’s one of Jack, with Marvin next to him, looking at his laptop and not the camera. The lighting is dark, so the light from the laptop illuminates just Jack and Marvin. If one’s completely honest Jack looks slightly creepy, because of the intensity from concentration. There’s another of Jack, Alex and Patience, with Jack facing away. Alex and Patience face the camera, but aren’t looking at it, and they’re all sitting on one of the big landscape rocks. It’s a good picture, but left un-cropped it looks far away. Another dark picture is around the fire pit making s’mores. The viewer would have to know Claire and Kaia to guess who it was, but you get the impression of two people very close. The last one is of Nat and Mel on Pearl Street in Boulder. They’re backlit so you can’t see their faces well, but the lighting helps show that their fingers just lightly touch as they stand looking around at different things.
“Since you were the one who got killed, maybe I should cut you some slack and we should talk about how you’re feeling?”
“How did these kids wind up being morning people who exercise, Cas? I thought kids their age were supposed to sleep until noon.”
“Glad to be back.”
“Ok, I didn’t want you to wear plaid today,” confesses Cas as he hands Dean a fork. “We’re taking pictures at the selfie museum.”
“See there!”
Eileen intervenes, “It’s fine. Kelly knows someone who can do it quickly and nearly painlessly, and they’ll look really good.”
Both Jack and Jeremy laugh. “Uh, he doesn’t talk about it too much, but yeah,”says Jeremy.
“Jack wanted to let us know that he told Jeremy a little more than we planned about Kelly.”
Jeremy looks at Jack. “You’re disappointed about the bunk beds, right? You wanted a top bunk?”
“Yep, he wanted to learn all the traditional dishes he could, so it was a scheme of theirs. Dal is his specialty,” says Jack.
After the toast, Jeremy asks for bottles of soda for Jack, Kaia, and himself, and everyone starts loading up on wings and pizza.
“She did?”
“If you open it you’ll know,” Jeremy says with a smile. Jack goes ahead, and finds inside a pair of boot slippers. They pull on snugly and shouldn’t slip or slide.
Patience comes up and says, “Your being here was nice. It was fun to tell all those old team stories. I felt like a normal person.”
Kelly speaks up, “I get the impression that if he thinks you won’t be interested, he doesn’t say much. And he did listen to everyone talk about the tourist outings, and the holidays. He might talk to me about the tax code, but that’s ok.”
“There’s so much that’s changed! We should wait for Rowena so you and your dads can hear everything at once. But the reason is that things are as safe as a universe with free will can get. Team god gave up omniscience. They still see all the possibilities, just not the end. It’s like a weather forecast. We shouldn’t have threats from cosmic beings for at least a hundred years. Ghosts and witches should be as bad as it gets, so instead of being a guardian on high alert in heaven, I can be a mom with you on earth.”
“So you feel up to inspection Mr. CEO?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean and Charlie look like they’re about to cry again. Jack gives Patience a questioning look, but she rolls her eyes and crosses her arms.
After Jack gets downstairs, everyone decides to hang out in the rec room. Jack lets them know Jeremy is calling his mom, but they’re interrupted by the group chat.
Sam’s phone rings, and he goes to the dining room to answer.
“If we were with the family, that’s where you’d insert a wink or a flirty look to get them all groaning.”
Jack says, “Mom, Jeremy and I should put the pool noodles on the rungs for you.”
“Maybe. Right now I’m mainly working with weights and gardening. Well, it’s less gardening and more trying to rehabilitate all the empty lots and spaces around us. Are you running every day?”
Jack protests, “Hey, I like having Queen Aunts,”
“We were talking about camping, and I started thinking about the camps with Bobby and… Mary,” Jack’s voice crumples on Mary, and tears start rolling down.
Something about Jack’s expression has everyone at the table glowing with smiles, and Jeremy is thankful he didn’t just say no, which was his first impulse.
“You’re the driver. Driver picks the music. Shotgun shuts his cake hole.”
“Nah, I mean taking a turn wearing out Miracle.” He hands him the tennis ball and says, “Just show him that and run around and he’ll go along with it.”
“I’m taking the bunk beds, so obviously I needed pool noodles,” Kelly says with a smile in her eyes. “Jack can climb up and hang out with me occasionally. And rather than compete with Rowena on gifts, I thought we should join forces.”
When everyone is resettled on the couch, Claire asks, “Soo, moving on to the elephant in the room, how are you and the ‘rents?” Kaia rolls her eyes.
Jeremy adjusts some pillows and turns on his side to face Jack. “So instead of going to camp, you went actual camping with your Dads?”
“Sounds hobbit-y,” Charlie says, “I’m envious.”
“Not anything big. Jack’s friend Canada seems to know exactly when to text me to annoy me in front of Jack, so the joke is that she’s psychic, but she’s actually not texted for a couple days.” He shrugs. “And we ran into a little girl who told Jack he was Skittles, and he said he’d heard that before. Later he said that she was describing an aura.” Patience nods. Jeremy continues, “Hey, do you want to give a second opinion on mine? The little girl described it for me.”
“Do you mind seeing Miracle on my bed?”
“Hey J, are you good to drive about 45 minutes once we get back to the cars?” ask Dean.
“Wow, that’s big news,” says Sam. “Is it ok if I send you some ideas later.”
Dean is sitting at the barstools instead of behind the kitchen island for once. He’s drinking some orange juice, like Cas suggested. Miracle chews a toy underneath his seat.
“So Jack said you haven’t freaked with the idea of Patience being psychic?” Alex raises an eyebrow.
“Come on y’all! It’s ready.” She sounds more like she’s welcoming them to family dinner than bringing food to a restaurant booth. Dean grabs Cas by the arm and pulls them back to their seats. Surprisingly, Sam’s vegetable plate is a complete misnomer. It’s taken
“No! It’s just a rental. Look, let’s just get the cars unpacked, and I’ll tell you more later.”
“Well, probably billiards,” says Sam.
Jeremy laughs and says, “Too young to drink.”
“Dean, I wasn’t prepared for this reaction,” says Charlie.
“Yes. I mean he already knows what’s in your heart when you see him, but sometimes a person has say the words anyway. Cas is next on my list. I thought I should talk to you first. He’d expect me to,” Mary says with a wry smile.
“Everything.”
“How the heck did they manage to get a cookie cutter like Baby?” Jody asks.
“It’s like a hammock, but you sit in it. I mean obviously she has a bed so she doesn’t need a full hammock. Then she has Christmas lights along with her Smart bulbs,” adds Jack.
▪	write without a beta for feedback.
“She sounds smart,” says Eileen, impressed. “I think I’d like her.”
Dean chuckles, “We’re doing road tourist stuff for once. Stopped by the Wheat Jesus sign.”
“It was the best mom. You’re here — I mean really here. You’re not just a presence in my head and heart, and all the Dads are here, and my cousins, and most of my aunts. And my best friend got to come, and I think he had fun even though he was feeling down. He didn’t take take out his ball to throw at the wall even once! And it can only get better when my uncles and Aunt Amara can come.”
Gertie says, “I want to thank you both.”
“How did you know we’re not from Texas?” asks Cas.
Sam says, “We’re having the ceremony on March 17
Cas chuckles. “I have to agree with you. It’s certainly a mixed blessing.”
“What happened to Ajay? Wasn’t it always Ajay and Jeremy? When did it become just Jeremy?”
“That’s the logic.”
Kelly smiles, and says, “Have a good night.” Then as they leave she finishes off the can of whipped cream.
“It should help your moods, though,” continues Kelly.
Sam looks a bit sick. Eileen smiles an amused, unworried smile, because she’s a complete badass. Rowena gives a sly smile and a devious look. Dean nudges Cas, and says, “History,” while Cas tries to look anywhere but Rowena.
“I really should. She’s been traveling around with me on my work trips, but I’m a little selfish. I still want to keep my time with her to myself. And she likes to have some time on her own, too, so I don’t want to dump her into a situation with a lot of people.”
“She doesn’t need a hammock, but she needs a swing chair?” asks Dean.
“Both of them did this?
“But you don’t usually worry about doing things that aren’t … I don’t know — manly.”
Dean snickers. “Antlers hit too close to home, huh?
Gertie says, “I’m going to tell you a secret. Sometimes when someone says that they don’t like crowds, it’s not that they really dislike being around a lot of people, it’s that they dislike how they might act in the crowd. I’ve always liked people. I was considered an extrovert when I was younger — Charlie gets that from me — but I was in a car accident that put me in a coma for years. It was just me and my memories for a long time. Sometimes I’m not sure what’s real and what isn’t, so I can blank out or have a conversation with people who aren’t there. Both those things tend to upset people. Today’s been a very good day, but every day is different. Every person is different. Your father might have a phobia, or be an introvert, or something else may be going on. He might be like me, but I doubt it. You’ll have to ask him, if he seems open to it.” She shrugs, “I probably shouldn’t have said all that, but I’m in a good mood today, so guess I can handle a few mistakes.”
“So you know the alliterative friend group?” Asks Dean as Cas makes a choking sound. Dean pats Cas’ back, with one hand and pushes some water over with the other.
“Dean’s just cranky ‘cause he can’t hold Cas’ hand,” says Eileen.
“But Kelly healed them,” says Alex quickly, realizing they had buried the lead.
Everyone whooped and screamed. He heard a few shout “Kiss him!”, so he stood up and did so, passionately, as Cas returned the kiss with the same intensity. There was a dog’s bark, and then some laughter and then things got a bit more quiet. He and Cas parted and they turned. “Jack!” Without thinking that this was god, Dean gave him a hug, and so did Cas. Jack didn’t fight it and instead returned the hugs quickly saying, “It’s good to see you Dean. I thought that you might want these.”
“Maybe you guys should take out a map and draw a big circle that has Lebanon and Sioux Falls in it? Then look in the circle,” suggests Alex.
“Now I do. I didn’t then. Dean, I’m sorry. I’m sorry for the grief and anger that you felt.”
Eileen gives Jack a playful light whack on the arm. “Hey, introduce me first.”
“Hello Dads!”
“Jack, do you feel like you know your Dads?”
“As fun as that was, I think next year we should draw names,” says Dean. “I can’t believe that I’m saying this, but we all got too many gifts.”
“You shouldn’t get it again, I also repaired some nerve damage and helped out your receptors. It won’t change your thoughts, so if you’re having trouble with intrusive thoughts, you need to see someone Mia recommends.”
“Yeah, I never liked the idea of telling people you’d been married to anyone but me, so I approve. But Jack’s trying to show his friend that everyone can be still be one big happy family. We’re the example, aren’t we?” Dean looks a bit uncomfortable at the idea, but Cas just smiles.
THR 100 - Intro to the Theater - A
I’m here!” then pulls his second KU ID, the modified one, which is nicer than saying fake, and taps the pad with it. The lobby door opens and he waves at the security monitor who nods. During the quick elevator ride to Jeremey’s campus apartment, he double-checks the supplies in his backpack. He’s about to knock, when there’s a large thud against the door from the other side. Pause, thud, pause, thud. It’s the ball.
“Maybe not the new album. It makes me sad.” At Jack’s surprised look he adds, “Hey, I don’t live under a rock, and I have feelings.”
“I hope this is for your relatives. You don’t have to get any of us gifts!”
Forgive me. Once again here is a chapter about just
“Hello Castiel. You don’t have to be afraid of me. I’m sorry that I hurt you.”
want to hear. Uh, excuse me m’am.”
Dinner feels like everyone is ready to take a break from bigger emotions and dive into holiday small talk. Sam looks relieved that he’s not the only person willing to eat the vegetable lasagna, as both Cas and Jeremy share the pan with him, while Dean, Eileen and Jack pile the meat lasagna on their plates.
Rowena get up and says,“Gadreel is somewhere around here. I’ll make him pop in, even though he won’t eat anything
“Just run it by me again. I want to make sure I’m not mixing up all his friends.”
There’s a lot of emotion in the intensity of Cas’ hug, but when he lets go of Jeremy, he just says, “Thanks.”
UNI 103 - Orientation Seminar - A
“Ok, now share,” Dean says and Charlie gives everyone hugs.
Dean chuckles. “Ok exercise explorer, let me know when you buy a bike, so we can come cheer your first Ironman or whatever.”
Eileen rolls her eyes and signs and says, “As if I’d let him. Tour?”
Mary stirs her coffee a little longer than necessary and answers. “John’s with Bobby, Rufus, and Bill Harvelle on a fishing trip.”
“But you’re not going home. You’re going on a big family trip.
Arlette brings drinks and napkins and says, “Food will be out soon, so I’m going to warn you now — leave room for pie.”
“You just have a thing for Aubry Plaza,” says Claire to Alex.
“I’m holding you to that, Charles.”
For a quiet and reserved person, Nat doesn’t seem at all bothered by Mel’s announcement, and seems to accept it as a fact. Kelly decides to try a Bloody Viking, too, but everyone else keeps to water or soda, feeling the need to keep their wits or driving ability.
They mainly talk about the week’s activities, with Mel asking to hear more from Jeremy and Jack about the tubing and the selfie museum. Nat and Sam slip in talk about work more than they probably should, but the lack of concern from Mel indicates that’s usual for Nat. Kelly surprises both Nat and Sam by quoting part of the tax code. Since that’s after the third Bloody Viking, Nat is suitably impressed.
“I’m up for whatever you guys want to do so, as long as I get my six hours tonight and some coffee tomorrow morning.” Now that they’re retired, Cas insists that Dean always try to sleep at least six hours instead of four even if it doesn’t always happen.
“Is that a fish?’
“You can take Miracle off the leash, Gertie. I think he’s calm,” says Cas. Gertie undoes it and hands it back to Cas. Miracle jumps on the couch and puts his head in Gertie’s lap much to her surprise and pleasure, as she gives him scratches on his head.
“What? Abandoning us already?”
“Sounds like a lot of trouble,” says Jeremy unconvinced.
Claire passes the gifts out and instead of albums, they all get small digital picture frames. Claire turns hers on.“Hey, you got some pictures of when we made s’mores,” she says.
“I’m scared,” says Dean.
Cas raises an eyebrow as Jack says, “Sounds like there’s a story there, dad.”
Everyone else starts catching up on the things that needed to be held back from civilian eyes and ears. Eileen, Donna and Jody go online in the office for some hunter check-ins, even though Garth is handling most of it. Rowena, Gadreel, and Sam take over the fire pit area to work on a spell problem. To everyone besides the three, it’s unclear exactly what the spell is meant to accomplish, but it seems to act as an angel beacon — to Kelly’s great annoyance when she feels the pull to see what’s going on outside. Gadreel admits it feels strange. Fortunately it’s limited in range, so it doesn’t pull any angels from heaven to investigate. They do get Balthazar who asks to see Cas — to Dean’s great annoyance. Balthazar reminds Cas about his very awkward public apology for killing him, and laughs at him. He then proceeds to tease Dean about his clueless pining. Kelly finds Balthazar amusing, so Gadreel is the one stuck removing him before Dean starts looking for an angel blade — to Gadreel’s great annoyance. Kelly also goes away, and Rowena and Sam tweak a few elements and try again. Kelly feels no desire to come out again. Gadreel feels normal. A couple of annoyed, but cautious reapers come by and leave as soon as they see the Queen of Hell and Sam Winchester together, figuring whatever is going on is above their pay grade. Rowena declares the experiment over.
Still whispering Rowena says, “No, t’isn’t. Not any more. And they’re asking for a consultation, not for you to run things. It’s quite all right to say no to heaven. That shouldn’t be a problem for The Sam Winchester who shot god, or am I wrong?” Her look is challenging, but eyes show sympathy.
Dean wonders if it’s strange to be so worried about about Jack being at college, considering he remade much of heaven — but then the load of being God had become too much, with both Jack and the universe threatening to crack. With Amara trying to hold everything together, it took the help of heaven, hell, and many they pulled from the empty to create a new balance, but they’ve managed to once again re-write their story. What’s a few more minor details, thinks Dean. He stands up and stretches, dislodging Miracle from his feet. Now both of them are ready for some movement, and he’s about to get one of Miracle’s toys, but Cas is back already.
“Yes,” says Cas moving closer to Dean.
Jack smiles, and says, “Can I show the others?”
“So we seem sketchy?” Jack asks.
Cas nudges Dean. “See? She likes Grumpy Cat.” Cas leans back looking pleased with himself. Dean gives Cas an affectionate squeeze.
the same as dirt from the bottom of your shoes. There’s no comparison between eating on a bed and wearing shoes on a bed. Just think of the germs!”
“I’ll help again,” calls Jack. Feeling self-conscious Jeremy takes the ball and yells, “Hey look here, boy!” Miracle perks up and Jeremy starts running around the worn circle. When Miracle is about to catch him, Jack jumps out, and makes him run a different way. “Look! I still have this!” Jeremy yells as he waves the tennis ball at him, and Miracle follows. He’s not sure how long they circle around, but Jack is starting to run out of steam. Finally, Jack just plops down on the long grass, as Miracle jumps on top of his chest, while Jack yells, “Oh no, a monster’s got me.” Miracle licks Jack’s face as he squirms and pretends to fend him off. It strikes Jeremy how easily Jack can be himself. Jack is always transparent and always a mystery.
Dean got down on one knee. Cas’ eyes widened. “Cas, I love you. This wouldn’t be my heaven without you. We can make it anything you want it to be. I just need you. I want you by my side from now on. Will you stay with me?”
“Yeah, I like this one,” says Charlie. “Ok, handmaiden, time to earn your title.” Charlie gets Dean and Cas to help her do a handstand, and everyone does lots of jumping up and down. Miracle gets passed around a bit as a prop but he’s an oddly good natured dog, who seems incapable of getting stressed.
“He was pretty impressed with Kelly,” says Sam with a grin, thinking about the amount of akvavit consumed at the table.
“Nothing!” they all say.
Dean and Cas look behind, both blushing, but Dean clears his throat and says, “You got it Kelly. Cas?”
“Wait, what’s happening?”asks Jeremy.
Jeremy smiles and tells Charlie, “Would you tell her I’m making an effort? I think she’ll get it.”
PSYC 104 - General Psychology - B
“Dean must be a really good cook. I like these hash browns,” says Jeremy. “Oh Cas, before I forget, I wanted to tell you that the cookies were great. You’re a decorating pro. You should have a YouTube show.”
Cas nods and goes to scratch Jack’s lower back which gets a groan and a “Thanks, Dad,” and starts Jack toward alertness.
“He’s so nice, why wouldn’t he be?” asks Jack.
“Wow,” says Sam.
“Absolutely not,” Jeremy says. Alex gives him a hug.
“No, I can tell you some things. There’s not much I haven’t already said to Jack. I get angry at them, but I don’t hate them. I just don’t understand them. Dad’s been asking me to think about how I want to spend vacations, and they say they’re fine with us all being together for some of them. Then I wonder why get divorced if you like spending time together? I guess it comes down to both of them wanting to be out on their own. They tell me that… ” He looks at Jack, “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t go on. I mean your mom was on her own for a while, and nothing seems weird about her being here with you and your dads now. And I can’t imagine Cas without Dean.”
“Is it Rowena? Is that the real reason I can’t wear plaid?” asks Dean.
Sam laughs, “It’s true. Dean’s probably done more hugging in the past couple of years than the previous decade. Of course when he was a five-year-old he ‘wuved hugs,’”
Cheesy tourist stuff and middle-aged dads being gross(cute) over each other.
A man who looks like he might be the girl’s father appears and calls the woman over. They say quick good-byes and walk on to the car. Kelly puts a hand on Jeremy’s arm.
It’s a rush of cold, cold, air. Gravity and uneven weight distribution makes them rotate and slide down at the same time. They get a roller coaster stomach drop effect over one of the big bumps. Jack and Kelly scream just for the fun of it, and then they’re already approaching the end. A big snowbank is meant to slow their momentum, and a tall, but soft plastic fence is behind it. As the tube slides to a stop it seems to climb up the bank pretty far.
Sam stands up and says, “We have an announcement to make.”
Jeremy and Patience launch into a surprising number of funny stories about being in high school athletic teams, including pranks involving stuffing lockers full of ping pong balls, helicopter parents adjusting the position of competition livestream cameras, and dealing with long charter bus rides.
Back stories, cover stories, and lunch.
“When don’t I say it?”
“The what?” Dean and Cas ask together. Cas tilts his head at Jack and looks confused.
“How did you leave it?”
“Anyway, Charlie helped Jack and me get some gifts, but I think I need some get a few more.”
“K, got it,” says Jeremy. There’s a pause, then he says, “Well go ahead and let’s get it over with.”
“I don’t know Jack. That’s a lot of people. I’m not sure I’m up for it.”
Cas says, “Dean, I’m sure he and Mel discussed us heavily before we met, and then he only talked about his areas of expertise. I don’t think we’ve seen him interact casually yet, and certainly not around seventeen people at one time.”
“So that’s why Gadreel.” Sam looks about and then whispers, “Why did Team God let an angel come down?”
“Aren’t most of you drinking age?” asks Jeremy.
Claire says, “One more,” and holds up a glass. “To family.”
“Hey, I think the boys should have it, since Sam can keep her warm,”says Dean with a smirk.
Eventually, Sam calls everyone back to attention, because Jeremy and Jack have to pick their room.
“We’re going.”
The Empty frowns. “I feel Darkness in you and I am both drawn to you and repelled by you. How is that possible?”
“Today, I’m your driver. I’m also on call in case anything comes up.”
Arlette comes by with paper place mats. Sam waves off a straw as as she also sets paper napkin-wrapped cutlery down.
“Ok Rowena. See you soon.”
Sam snickers a bit, then looks questioningly at Eileen, who says, “Let’s have some pancakes.”
“I’ll leave you the room for a while.”
“Maybe you’ll like graduate students a lot more.”
“Thanks Charlie, you’ve been a big help,” says Jeremy.
Claire and Kaia stayed at the bunker for a while, helping to teach hunters, until the bunker was finally locked up as more of a storehouse and emergency backup location, like some of the old Men of Letters chapter-houses. The key eventually went to Garth’s sons, Castiel and Sam, for safekeeping, and the plan was for it to stay in their family.
Jody laughs, “You ok with that Sam?”
Canada says, “Tell him I’ll be on good behavior — and Jack, you might have to frowny face him to get him to agree.”
“Then my work here is done. See you soon, Jeremy,” Claire says, and she and Kaia take off.
“It’s good to be prepared. What if there’s an emergency and we have to run out? I don’t want to take time to put on my shoes.” Jack pauses and then turns toward Jeremey with his eyes narrowed. “You
?— those were just a few he noticed clapping and whistling. There would be time to talk to everyone later.
Rowena comes from the stairwell. “I hear you bellowing, Dean Winchester! Let me tell you that’s impossible. Miracle was spoiled before — just in different ways.”
“Souls coming from the veil immediately come to hell and are placed in their memories, unless there are special circumstances that have them going straight up to heaven. Heaven kept souls repeating their happiest memories, but that essentially trapped them and kept them isolated. Instead, people will relive memories and be assessed as to whether they have enough empathy to move on to live with others in heaven. If people are cruel, they aren’t tortured, but they do have to relive their memories from the point of view of the people they wronged.” Rowena shrugs. “Until we can figure something else to do, people either trap and torture themselves or eventually move on to heaven, as they come to understand their actions.”
“Cas, I hid my feelings and I don’t want to hide them anymore. Please forgive me. Cas, let me tell everyone I care about how much I love you, and let me dance with you in front of them.”
“We thought you needed a bigger selection for your cookie cutters,” says Jack.
Jack walks over to Castiel, Amara no longer visible. He turns to the Entity and says, “You no longer have any power over anything but yourself. No beings will be sent to your Void. You can sleep now. What the sleep is like is up to you.”
“Yeah, you’re not getting out of it. You gotta call him yourself.”
“I’m so sorry,” says Jack with a sob.
The Empty nods and gives a determined clenched jaw, “What are your terms?”
“Then don’t,” interrupts Patience.
“Jack’s gotten really good with eggs. He can do the fancy omelets, where you get a flat disc that you can fold fillings into.”
Jeremy takes the tennis ball and throws it straight up into the cold, but bright blue sky. He watches it carefully and catches it as it comes down. He feels lighter, as though his head is as clear as the sky. He walks toward Dean who has his hands full holding Miracle. “See if you can get it back in that outer pocket for me, J.” Jeremy has it in the wide pocket of Dean’s jacket and is walking away before he realizes that he now has a nickname.
“Dean Winchester, turn it down a notch,” says Jody, but with a smile and without any real irritation.
It’s a logistical event getting everyone to the Convention Center, but they manage it. They all pose for a few pics with the Big Blue Bear on street level, but the bear is positioned so that he’s looking into the building, not facing out. To get it facing the camera means going into the Center. Dean and Charlie stay with Miracle to do some catching up, while Cas follows the boys inside.
“Burger joints are great places to eat,” protests Dean.
“I thought I knew them. It feels like they lied to me. They never argued. Like never. In high school I heard other people’s parents arguing at games all the time. They always acted like a team. I thought they were different, and they’d be together forever, but they never loved each other.”
Since he’s got his phone out, Jeremy goes over as well to make sure that Alex sends him her vids.
“Heavens!” says a striking older woman walking out of the kitchen. She reminds Dean of Ellen, but with dark brown hair shot through with white. She notes Dean and Sam with a nod and yells over, “I hope that you boys like Willie. The rule is my shift, my music.”
Both shoot a ball to the back rail. The balls almost simultaneously travel down to the back rail and back. Jack’s isn’t perfectly straight on the return and doesn’t come up quite as far, while Claire’s rests perfectly at the front rail.
Nevertheless, Jack starts off, saying, “Ajay’s mom thought that Asha, his older sister, needed to learn to cook traditional food, and she really didn’t want to. She finally made a deal that she would put 100% into learning how to cook…”
“So, do we figure they’re all going to bond over manual labor,” asks Charlie with a smile reaching for her coffee.
“I won’t say no to your cooking, but no cleaning up from you guys,” answers Dean. “Anyway, no cooking for anyone tonight. When our missing Queens get home, they’re bringing pizza and wings.”
“You want me to grab a little of everything for you?” Jeremy asks. He seems a bit surprised at himself for the offer, but motions to Charlie’s plate.
Family dinner, lesbian holiday rom-com, s’mores around the fire pit, then back in to see baby Yoda.
“Are you assuming that I’m going somewhere other than home? Brah, I’m not a beach for break person. I can come back to Kansas anytime, if I’m invited.” He turns to Charlie, “Is there still a dragon roll left you can pass me?”
Jack yells, “I love mine!” Jack holds up very busy Mandalorian sweater with Grogu in the middle on a background of Din helmets.
It’s obvious that they understand each other very well, and both can turn on being entertaining and distracting. Although Alex gives familiar nods to Patience’s stories, they’re new to everyone else at the table, even Jack. Everyone smiles and laughs. Jeremy and Patience both seem to run out of steam though, neither being natural extroverts. That’s when Jack whispers something to Jeremy and then to Charlie, and they go to the living room to fish out a large box from under the tree.
“It was more about the packing for the trip,” Cas says.
“That’s what I thought, but how is he here? He’s ok?”
“All of us have complicated stories,” says Jack.
After the table is cleared, Rowena reveals that she also brought holiday decorations, so the lack of a tree is solved. Gadreel sets up a very tall one in the living room by himself and Rowena has him stack ornament boxes ready for tree trimming when the sisters come. Everyone else grabs wreaths, bows, and swags to tie on doors, rails, and lay on tables. Presents get rearranged under the tree.
“Jeremy…” Jack walks over to him.
into this movie.”
you’re wearing your shoes on your bed. I can’t believe your dads let you do that.”
“I can’t help it, and half the circus is mine, but you’re welcome.”
There are some high pitched squeals of joy involved in saying hello that catch Miracle’s attention and have him putting his ears up.
“Donna, lookin’ hot! Huh, Jody,” says Dean with a wink.
“Then you would never learn,” dead pans Jack.“Ajay is one of his roommates. He cooks really well.”
“He’s not going mansplain things, is he?” asks Claire suspiciously.
Patience says, “We can stick it out with you,” looking at Jody and Donna who nod, “Then we watch Rudolf.”
“Sunshine, you don’t know the half of it.”
Sam gives a wide smile that drops a bit when Dean turns around and gives him a quick finger jab and the admonition, “Just don’t turn into Lance.”
Dean and Cas let Kelly take the lead in being mother hen, making sure that Jack and Jeremy have layers, waterproof snow pants, and all the small logistical concerns for an outing. Even if they’re college students, neither give eye rolls, or any other signs of minding Kelly’s fussing. Jack seems especially content and cheerful. When they head out the door, Kelly throws the keys to Dean, who discovers he’s driving an 8-person SUV, as she wants to join Jack and Jeremy in a 3-person row. Dean shrugs, not one to mind being the driver. He takes a couple minutes to familiarize himself with the basics on the dash. He gets some heat going, and then starts up with Cas navigating from his phone.
“Babe, you were so stressed out at the beginning of this whole thing,” counters Dean. “We had a talk about it.”
Sam says, “All in favor, raise your hand.” Everyone’s hands shoot up.
“Dean, this is a beautiful.” Kelly takes out a phone to get a picture of her hot chocolate, with an artful mound of whipped cream and swirls of syrup, then moves to the dining room, as others come around the counter to fix their mugs.
Kelly says, “He’s also brave and kind, but really it’s all him and the Dads.”
“Hey, I’ve got some stranger’s kid driving and his electric car to charge. No way we’re going up a mountain in the dark. Ya gotta cut me some slack here.”
“I understand if it’s too much, but you’d really like the Dads and my mom. Claire’s coming. She’s tough on the outside, but she’s cool. She’s like a sister, and her girlfriend Kaia is really sweet. If Claire gets to be too much, Kaia will take care of it.
“The story is that he made me wear a totally boring pantsuit.”
“Dean? We can park it in Lebanon and all go to Denver in Baby,” offers Jack.
“Pretty swank place you rented,” says Dean with a questioning tone.
“Sorry Jack, surprises and presents in the trunk. Backseat,” apologizes Dean.
“That seems…odd. Can’t they make it…there?”
Donna seems amused for some reason, but just says, “You betcha. You tell your parents hello and thank you from alla us for letting you stay.”
“What exactly did he tell?”
“Stay here with me, then.” Cas gives him a softer kiss and says, “I love you, Dean. That doesn’t mean we won’t have to talk about it later, though. ”
ANTH 150 - Becoming Human - A
Dean looks at Cas again. He still looks confused but there’s affection for Jack in his eyes. Confused affection is another one of Cas’ adorable looks. Well, no reason not to make them all happy, he thinks.
“Do you remember when there was No Thing?”
“You could bring your mother,” says Cas.
“Hot damn, that’s gonna be fun,” says Dean.
“Ok. What do you think of this color tape?”
“It would seem so. You have to admit that it’s more true than Kelly being my ex-wife.” said Cas.
“…post-popularity….”
“It’s no trouble,” says Dean. As soon as his hand is free, Miracle jumps into Dean’s arms. “This trouble-maker is Miracle.” It’s a bit tricky to give Jack a hug this way, but neither Miracle or Jack seem to mind getting squished against each other, and Jack gives Miracle a ruffle on his head and receives a lick or two to his face.
Mary smiles, “I thought we might need to talk before.”
“Not too strange for you?”
With a gasp, Dean puts a protective hand on Cas, but it’s over the top, so he’s joking.
Dean yells from the kitchen, “Hey guys, Miracle has the zoomies! A little help, please!”
“Huh,” Dean says, and silence seems to reign for a several minutes, as he slowly works on his beer.
Cas looks annoyed until Dean lifts out a second exact same shirt.
“Sure, I’ll stay tonight. Uh, I’m thinking about running for an office in my Schol Hall.”
“There’s always someone who likes it, but I’m not a fan. It’s more trouble than you’d think.”
“You have no right to be embarrassed — we didn’t get you gifts — so we should be embarrassed,” says Patience.
He looked around, and then saw Castiel’s wings for the first time in his life. He gasped at the dark feathers as they caught the bright light from the sunset and exploded into iridescent rainbows. They spread out as he hovered for a moment and then pulled down as he stepped lightly on the ground in front of him. Dean launched himself at Cas, and would have tackled him to the ground if Cas’ wings hadn’t stretched out again to keep them upright.
“It’s so good to see you Charlie.”
Everyone switches seats, and Claire pretends to get offended at Dean stealing Cas and the love seat, and she and Kaia go join Jody and Donna. Patience and Alex try out the futon mattress on the floor with the Tsum Tsums. Charlie puts on Rudolf and leads everyone in saying, “deviance from the norm will be punished” at appropriate times. Dean cheers “Yay, gay dentist”which both amuses and annoys Cas, because he’s not sure that it isn’t inappropriate. Finally Charlie yells “deviance from the norm will be punished unless it is exploitable.”
“You’re welcome, Charlie,” Jack says, not seeing when she’d come in.
“Gadreel, thank you for the news, and… thank god,”says Cas getting up to help Dean grab things for the table. Gadreel nods and has a hint of a smile.
like to see them play.”
Dean says to Sam, “You did good, Sam. Eileen’s amazing. Now let’s get the hell out of here before she gets me crying.”
Sam sighs, and says, “Yeah, actually I think you’re right. I had times like that at Stanford.” Sam nods, and then drops the topic. “Ok, so dinner’s about ready,” Sam turns around to Eileen, signing and saying “What’s left to do?”
. Before his thoughts drift too far, he realizes that Sam’s talking about Willie Nelson.
“Rowena told me to say, ‘Auntie Rowena is going keep your Dads from wrecking your fashion sense with plaid at Christmas.’”
“So do you two think you’ll be able to get enough to eat?” Cas asks as he sits at the large table they picked.
“I suppose I enjoy seeing everyone get riled up when I flirt with you, but I deserve at least a decade of flirting with you that I didn’t have.”
The lesbian holiday rom-com they are watching is "The Happiest Season," currently still on Hulu. For this particular experience, Jeremy and Alex are my self-inserts. I felt like I was going to have an aneurysm watching everything Kristin Stewart's character (Abby) went through. However, reading some reviews, I discovered that many people were moved by the movie, and I wanted to reflect that.
“I don’t think I know the myths that get taught.”
“I’m Jeremy. Do you know where I’m going?”
“No, silly, like the swimming pool…”
“Yeah, but you can’t judge him. You already said he was cool, so you can’t change your mind. Seriously, don’t you want to listen to your stuff?”
“My father thought that I couldn’t go to college if I tried to help people. I’m proving that I didn’t have to be perfect or go to an Ivy. The University of South Dakota may not be Harvard, but I’m learning what I need to know. Nothing has to hold me back. I’m sure I can get into medical school. I should be happy, but it all makes me so angry.”
Arlette unsuccessfully stifles a chuckle, but gives an innocent enough face. “I’ll bring your drinks over in a minute.”
Kelly gets a framed picture of her and Jack. Sam and Eileen get a picture of themselves laughing together in the living room that neither of them remember Jeremy taking. Kelly rolls her eyes and says that she was there and Jeremy specifically asked them if he could take some pictures. Dean teases that they were just too much in love to really notice anything.
Kelly smiles sweetly and says softly to Dean and Cas, “You two don’t need to worry. If there’s a problem he can’t handle, I’ll handle it,” she says, ending with a smug look.
Cas sighs, “I’m just thinking. Don’t worry, Dean.”
“No, I’d be terrible. Besides, I’m not sure that I believe the whole do what you love thing. I’d like to keep enjoying things I want to do — not try to make money from it.”
“Hey Jeremy, Kelly’s here!” Sam yells. “They’re just outside by her car.”
“I’d probably like what you know of them, too. That’s not so bad is it?”
“How is someone without a soul or even with a damaged soul going to
“Kids nowadays just don’t savor the humor in torturing people with awkward situations like we do. It’s for the best,” says Dean with a wink and a smile.
“Whoah, it’s a stroke training pool,” says Jeremy, highly impressed.
“No, I’m here. My head is not a great place to be right now.”
“but you have,” then she makes a wavy motion with her hand.
Cas shakes his head with exasperation, and leans over for a kiss anyway, but they get called out.
Charlie wipes a tear with her free hand, but they all sit in comfortable silence for some time lost in thought, but finally Kelly says, “Anyone want to go with me to get some kettle corn before we head to the house?”
“Bobby said he’s in heaven. I’m almost afraid to believe it, but yes.”
“They’re in the back seat.”
“And it sounds like a great place to bring my DSLR.”
“Ugh, I don’t want to tag anybody, or have a lot of followers. I just wanted to have some pictures to remember, and not have them lost in my camera roll. I wasn’t including all the stuff that I’ve edited and given to people. I wanted some pics that weren’t perfect, so it’s more that I was there to see it and not how good it looks.”
We start back to Dean and Cas, but meet Jack and Jeremy for lunch.
Cas smiles at him, “Thank you Gadreel. You’ll have to forgive our rudeness. I hope you’ve had a good morning.”
“What’s the story?”
“I wasn’t planning to take just Castiel.”
After a few minutes, Jack says, “Dad! We’re wearing our coat’s already, I don’t think we need that much heat.”
Dean puts out his hand for a fist bump, and they’re sealing the deal as Cas and the boys come up. “The gift shop is closed on Sundays,” Jack says.
“You have time to change that. There’s never as much as you think there is, but you have some time to talk to your family. Everyone here is very special, and it does make them easy to talk to, but I assume you must be, too.” She sighs and stretches. “I think I’m getting tired. Would you run down and let Charlie know that I’m ready to go home?”
“It was no sacrifice for you. I love you, Jack.
“A little fan of Kelly and Jack,” says Jeremy.
Alex has been recording the game on and off, but she says, Kelly, quick, over here!” Kelly as a dutiful mom has also been recording with her phone, and Alex moves her to around to one side of the table, and she takes a different angle. Jeremy had thought that taking video would be too distracting for the players, but now is glad Alex and Kelly have gone ahead and done it. Jack takes a different cue stick from the rack and removes the rear section which causes Sam to shake his head just a bit, and he looks at Dean who seems to agree that’s a bit much, but gives a shrug and a smile. Then Jack starts chalking the cue up.
“Maybe you need some projects, though.”
Jeremy just says, “You’re welcome.”
“Hey, look,” says Sam pointing at a large chalkboard, “their vegetable plate looks amazing. See that long list of choices?”
College Algebra - A
“Hello!” says Jack with sincere enthusiasm.
“She just told you that over the phone?”
“We don’t have to bet money. It could be dish duty or something,” says Alex.
Charlie says, “OMG. Are you guys not catching that Gabriel’s probably going to be down for Sam and Eileen’s wedding! You guys are gonna have an archangel at your wedding!” She’s gleeful.
Jack find kilts, and a Macleod tartan vest. “I like it. It’s reminds me of bees,” Jack tells Rowena, holding the yellow and black plaid.
Jack come in with Miracle on a leash, so he knows he needs to be on good behavior. Miracle sits politely with one ear lifted through Charlie’s introduction of the late-comers. Gertie asks to pet Miracle and he goes placidly. When Gertie comments on how nice he smells, Sam gets a suspicious look.
Dean says that he’ll have to give Miracle a bath before he gets to jump on everyone. Deciding that they all have things to do, they get up and head for the parking lot.
Claire blushes furiously and looks anxiously at Kaia, who seems completely calm and has a small smile, and says, “We haven’t figured it out yet.”
She goes over to two young women who avert their eyes as soon as he looks over. He might be imagining things, but he thinks he hears the phrase, “in shock at least five minutes,” from someone.
“I just didn’t want to have Kelly mojo everything ready tomorrow,” says Dean.
Kelly walks out the door, and since no one is around, she indulges herself in a snap. She then knocks on the door to Charlie’s very nice hotel room.
“Start with Taylor?”
Jack smiles softly. “I hope I’ll see her soon.”
The remaining group looks around to see that Nat has disappeared.
“No, but I didn’t get an clear idea of what exactly that means. I’m not expecting an answer, though.” Jeremy checks the door and the room, and seeing it clear says in a soft voice, “Claire’s wrestling holds freaked me out a lot more.”
“Dean! I..” and Cas’ words were broken off as Dean kissed him and they held each other. When Castiel parted to look at him he said, “I never thought you would return my feelings like this.”
Sam says, “This place is really close. I’m sure everyone can tolerate the temperature for the ride over.”
“You usually call,” points out Dean.
▪	turn a 1,000-word one-shot into a multi-chapter fic on a whim
After working a few moments, Jeremy says, “Your parents — your family —
“Kate-lyn is with a K. And Candy is Candace. I understand that she’s an extremely intelligent and poised young woman. They call her Candy ironically. I think her real nickname is Canada.”
“How many young women are in a flock, Dean?” Cas squints at him.
“I like them, so it’s ok,” says Jack with a smile.
“M’am that’s a philosophy I can get behind” says Dean pulling out his most charming boyish smile, as she walks over and adjusts a phone plugged into a sound system.
“Hey, you guys look shiny!” yells Charlie. Donna has a headband on instead of her usual ponytail, and her hair is shining.
Jeremy tears the wrapping and finds a sweater in a beautiful grey color — definitely not grout. It’s not a typical cable pattern and has rows of slanting links. He already knows enough about Gertie to realize she’ll want a picture, and want to reverse-engineer it. He shakes it out, and sees that this sweater falls a couple inches longer than what Rowena gets Jack. It also looks a little more roomy than what she gets Jack, but not as baggy as what Jeremy usually wears. He realizes that Rowena has paid attention to what he’s comfortable in, and given him a nicer version. He’s pleased but a little self-conscious about it, too. Jack is hovering to see.
“Is this something we all should change for?” asks Jeremy.
“C’mere boy. I’ll take that off for you.” He takes the bow off and Miracle gives a good shake. “I’m surprised someone didn’t magic this on you. You looked sharp most of the day, though.” Miracle gives him a lick and then lays down next to him on the couch.
Dean nudges Cas next to him and taps Charlie across from him, “So was that a surprise or not?
“Oh, any special requests for the kids?”
“Good thing you’re getting a University of South Dakota lil’ sis sweatshirt for Christmas,” says Alex with a smirk. “You’ll blend right in.”
“We’re here for the company and the cookies,” says Jody.
“That’s unusual,” says Cas and he stands and does the thing where he’s automatically dressed in jeans and a t-shirt, with his wings unseen.
“Yeah, seems a little too short for a full heart to heart,” replies Dean, not looking happy.
MATH 104 -
“I’m surprisingly ok with censorship in this car,” says Jack
“It’s a loaner. I thought something big might be useful for this trip.”
Sam laughs. “Yes, one of my best projects. Cas is next,”
“Let’s put them in the trunk. It will be cooler. I don’t want the icing to melt.”
“What took you so long?” Dean grumbles.
“There’s a lot of angel names on Cas’ side of the family,”Jack answers.
“Yeah, we’ll have him misbehaving and fighting authority soon enough.”
“Well, Cas and Dean understood with Charlie, so they would understand if your dad wasn’t comfortable meeting all of us. Mom, and Sam and Eileen would understand, too.”
“Thank you! I know it’s going to be great, but..uhm”
Castiel looks around. “I’m not in pain.”
Dean realizes that the yell came from the back, where he sees a couple of men who look to be in their 60s sitting at a small table.
“Oh, sure. Just including an ex-deity, an ex-angel, and a guy who’s retired from killing monsters. Yeah, I’m seeing more of a Halloween thing.
“Thanks for letting me come along with you guys,” says Jeremy obliging Dean with a polite if somewhat uncertain handshake.
“You just info dumped me
“Castiel, I…mourned you. I missed you.” Jack releases him.
“Ajay loves cooking,” says Dean.
Again thanks for sticking with this. I hope you like the slice of life stuff. Another chapter in a couple of days. Jack Kline's birthday is coming up on the 18th. I'm very sorry that I'm not going to finish in time for that, but I still have hopes(unrealistic?) of finishing in a week.
“Son of bitch!” yells Dean. Sam sits again, woozy from relief, having anticipated a cosmic event. Eileen strokes his back. Cas and Dean on the other hand look more upset and agitated than they were before.
“Shhh.” Cas soothed. ”We have all the time. Let’s dance for a while.” Then he pressed closer.
“Ok, Jack. Try the ladder.”
Rowena has brought manicure and pedicure supplies, and she and Cas have a selection of polish colors. Jeremy says that he has his hands occupied, but that he’ll get his toes done. Cas offers to apply the polish for Jeremy, and Jack helps him pick out a color. Kelly does Jacks toes. Claire has her nails painted black already, but lets Kaia experiment with dotting little white and pink flowers on them. Alex smirks a bit over the flowers, but says that the results look good when Kaia finishes. Charlie paints Dean’s fingernails a pearlized green that Cas likes. Kelly waves her hands back and forth over people’s nails, and that seems to help the polish dry, so no one gets smudged. Patience is getting tired, and commandeers the love seat to lay across it. Alex considers, and then just makes Patience go to bed.
“So is everything set?” asks Sam.
“What sort of thing?” Nat says, asking for clarification this time.
“I guess my ok-ness comes from my expertly falling on you?”
“Hey guys! So which of the two-bed rooms did you want?”
Jack looks up and says, “Yeah.” He takes out his phone to check his messages again, runs a finger over the crack in the case, and then pockets it. With a smile, he says, “My mom texted earlier. She’s coming early — tonight.”
Jack texts, “
Jack goes on.“I was on my group chat, and I worked on a surprise for today.” Jack looks at his phone. “Coming around 10 a.m.”
Sam says, “Mel reminded me of mom with her hair and that jacket, but she doesn’t look anything like her really.”
The eye roll Jack gives him shows that Jack doesn’t believe his answer, but he smiles anyway and says, “Good night,” turning away, holding Marvin.
“Yeah, I’ll need another glass,” says Kaia.
“Try something different. Live a little. Cas don’t enable him! Make him take you all somewhere nice.”
Jack motions Claire and Kaia to sit on his bed. Kaia does, but Claire goes over to Jeremy.
“Sweetheart, the room next to us is empty. All the rooms on this side of the hall are empty.”
“One of Ajay’s shot glasses. I can replace it at the bookstore. I’ll clean it up myself. Just, later, ok?” Jeremy’s looking for his ball.
“Yeah, I get that,” says Dean.
The hallway leads into a large kitchen in a welcoming light apricot color. There’s big built-in fridge and freezer, but instead of the sterile-feeling stainless steel of the bunker, there’s a large, semi-circle marble island, with a cooktop and rinsing sink. There’s a counter above the work area and a row of barstools. Anyone who cooks can have an audience or some conversation. On the wall side are the ovens, a full sink, and the appliances.
Bobby looked to Dean. “Well, get calling ya idjit,” and he walked into the roadhouse.
“Mary is a bad ass. She’s in heaven now. I’m looking forward to seeing her again, but it’s sad knowing that it’s my lifetime away.”
Sam walks back to the living room and says, “Rowena’s coming in an hour, and she’s bringing dinner.”
“Parents and kids, right?”
“Come on, Charlie. We can recreate our fashion montage moment.”
“So no monster visions lately?” Kelly asks Patience.
A blonde woman leads them downstairs to a bedroom he vaguely remembers from the tour, and once he puts the pillows and bags down, she introduces herself with a hug.
“I bet he’s considered a catch,” Dean says with a knowing look.
is different.”
There’s a ping and a text that they got to the hotel. Jack immediately texts, “
Dean looks up. “I thought you weren’t coming? Didn’t want to overwhelm them with too many people and all?”
Dean holds Jack’s face in his hands and gives him a kiss on the forehead like he’s seen Cas do with Jack. Then he tries to wipe some tears from Jack’s face. “Maybe I need to find some tissues,” he says, and Jack responds with a weak smile. His cracked phone vibrates a notification that perks Jack up a bit. He tells Dean, ‘It’s mom. She wants to know if I’m ok.” Jack quickly types and immediately get a response. He types a little longer message, and then sets the phone down again.
Alex isn’t having it. “Hey, why would you be embarrassed?”asks giving Jeremy a nudge.
Christmas gifts. Required banter. Social media. FaceTime. Bye.
My apologies for any pool errors. Although, I actually was taken to play pool on a date in college, I don't know the game. The pool scenarios are half research and half The Gamblers episode.
“I’m proud of you. You never know when pool is going to come in handy,” says Dean.
“She said that no one could help but love a baby, and that I should have the feeling of being loved like that. She said my memories would come back when I was old enough to understand them. I wanted to do it, but I didn’t like the idea that I might grow up to be somebody different. I wanted to be me. I just wanted you to love me for me.” Jack’s voice has calmed, but tears are steadily rolling down his face.
“Really, you sure?”
“Alex do not tease them,” warns Patience.
“Damn Cas, I’m going to break my thumbs on your shoulders. What are you doing?”
A faint trail of laughter comes up the stairwell and through the foyer along with snatches of conversation.
“Fair enough,” says Mel, sliding next to Sam. “By that logic, Kelly has to come sit by Nat and the akvavit bottle. It’s a drink-with-dinner thing.” Eileen sits on the other side of Sam, and Jody sits next to Eileen.
“What happened to Brian?” Dean asks.
Kelly shakes the container of whipped cream, and turns to Sam and Eileen, “So are they always like that?”
“I really should go, so let me tell him goodbye and that will give you all a chance to hit pause.” Cas nods. “Hey handmaiden!” yells Charlie unapologetically in the public space. “I gotta leave. Come hug me goodbye.”
Cas says, “Yes, but once I heard it, I realized I should have expected it.”
Surprise, suprise. You get an extra chapter.
“Charlie would probably know what to do, too. She works with computer systems and she’s coming in a few days, so you’ll meet her.”
Everyone sits on the barstools around the island as Sam sets a tall glass of water in front of Dean, and opens a beer bottle to slide over next to it. He says. “It’s close enough to dinner time. Just stay hydrated. Cas?”
“Yes!” they say in chorus.
“Sounds like a good guess,” says Sam.
“But you have eternity — we have eternity.”
Dean moves toward J’s mom as Jack and Cas greet J’s dad. Dean introduces himself to Mel, who seems to enjoy the mix of a firm handshake and nail polish on a man, and decides Dean is weird enough for her liking. Nathan looks at Cas and Jack as if they make sense to him, and he says to Cas, “You can call me Nat.”
Cas, Gadreel, and Sam look equally shocked, but Cas recovers and says, “While I have a hard time picturing Gadreel on a roller coaster, I think he’d enjoy watching people. What you do say, Gadreel?”
Jack looks like he’s considering a moment, then he says, “Good,” with a straighter smile.
“So how’d his mom take it?” asks Dean.
“But there wasn’t anyone to find them after Abbadon. Those old members would set up other members as executors, and had a private bank. After Abbadon, the British sent a representative who got control of US accounts and sealed places where they could.”
“Hey, that’s near the wheat Jesus sign,” interrupts Jack. “We should stop and take pictures.”
Kelly and Jack go to the living room to look out the windows. Kelly says, “So Jack, did you have a good Christmas?”
“I liked the shopping and wrapping,” says Cas.
Jack says, “I think I’ll take the blow drier.”
“What do you say about all this Alex?” Patience asks.
to keep up the hits on their cool dorm vids.”
Kelly’s eyes twinkle, and she says, “I’m happy I could make you both laugh, but we should go in. You two must be getting cold.” She grabs Cas’ hand on one side and Jack’s on the other, and playfully tugs at them, but then drops their hands and lets Cas lead the way into the house, her wings tucked away.
Dean says, “J, everyone already knows that you do. I sure as hell know. So take care of yourself, and call us anytime.” Then he gives him a hug.
“I didn’t want to be in a picture.”
“…I know it’s supposed to be a big family holiday, but do you think Jeremy could come? It’s just that he had a big fight with his dad, and he’s sad and angry…”
“But not too much land and not too big a house. I don’t want us to have more than we can keep up with,” adds Cas.
Dean started crying, “Cas, I never thought an angel could love me. I wasted so much time.”
There’s no answer. Jack is silent, already under the covers and staring at Marvin as if Marvin can answer some questions he has. Jeremy sits on his own bed and looks across at Jack, “Are you upset, too? Mad at me?”
Everyone seems settled by the evening, and Sam is finally able to convince most of the family to go to Copper for snowboarding tomorrow. Charlie is spending the day with her mom. Rowena passes saying, “Dearie, my natural place on a snow-covered mountain is at a lodge in front of the fire with a drink in my hand.” However, she promises to dog-sit, since this time the whole family will be out all day. Dean retreats to the office to painstakingly type and print out detailed directions for her. No one except Dean believes that she will look at the directions. Dean believes that she will look at the directions and then ignore them, but feels obligated to provide them anyway. He hopes Gadreel will be around.
“Tea — whatever you usually make.” Despite a protest from Cas, Eileen gets back up to get some honey from a cabinet, so it’s not long before they all have a beverage.
“I worked with the Winchesters and Castiel on a project some years ago. I’m afraid that I overstepped some boundaries. I’m thankful for their hospitality considering the mistakes I made in the past. I’m assigned to Rowena a short time, and then Michael has some suggestions, but I’d rather not speak of work now.”
“Plus, we’re going to have an angel group chat, ”
“Ok, I admit she does show how to anchor it neatly. I might not have done that, and it is for your mom so it should look nice.”
“She has an ironic nickname and a real nickname? Did they all come as a set?”
Cas is silent holding Dean’s hand as they go upstairs. He’s looking distracted and not at all present. Once they’re up, Cas pulls Dean to him, and then pushes him against the wall where he gives him a thorough kiss. Then he looks at Dean, and asks, “Still in your head.”
Rowena looks around. “There’s still an opportunity to get in on the ground floor as my favorite niece.”
“Then what would you do?”
He turns to Alex, but she interrupts with “Don’t get too emo. Patience says we’re going to see you soon, ok?” Patience gives Alex an annoyed look.
Cas has a smile and watery eyes, and he shifts over and embraces his husband. That might turn into a kiss that turns into another deeper kiss, and…the sound of a Demi Lovato song plays loudly.
Gadreel nods. He’s experienced enough of Old Heaven to understand that feeling. “I did see one piece of good news that I’d like to draw your attention to.” He folds over the paper to a story and passes it to Cas.
“Maybe,” says Dean seriously.
“Dads, since you’re going to bake today, we thought we’d give you this early,” says Jack.
a human psychology to it that makes sense, and he sometimes carries Miracle anyway, so he picks him up with a shrug. He decides to keep carrying him for a bit, since they have some stairs to go down. He’s always afraid someone is going to trip on Miracle or his leash.
Jeremy and Kelly talking about shopping and gift ideas until the tour group comes down the stairs.
“I thought I could fix it. I thought that if I pushed him — me — the one who’d seen him be a leader and protect whole encampments, he’d realize something was wrong.”
“You didn’t buy this place did you?”
“You’re right,” Sam sighs. He suggests that they leave the luggage there until after the tour, so they’ll know where to take the suitcases. There’s hallway on the left with doors on either side. Sam says, “The house has a strange long space that I think was the original garage, but it’s impressive what the owners did.” With that mysterious preface, Sam leads them and opens the door. The room has a skylight above and large windows at the far end. The floor is grey, possibly slate. There’s a treadmill, elliptical, and exercise bike facing the windows. Closer to them is what Dean describes as, “the smallest, most narrow pool ever.”
“I think there’s an electric Mustang.”
“Yeah, the first ones I took didn’t come out, but there were a few.”
Jack climbs up to the top and get into the bunk. “I like it up here. If I had Marvin, it would be great.”
“He’s just processing,” answers Cas. “That’s fine. We’ll go out for lunch in town and figure it out when you two get here. Just text us when you’re close.”
“I’ll go change,” says Jack heading upstairs.
and a reception the Saturday after.”
“I asked Sam to marry me and he said yes,” says Eileen.
Dean is quick to interrupt. “Hey, hey, you guys are not washing dishes this holiday.”
“Thank you all for coming. There's something special I want to share.
“We need to set out mugs and fixings?”
Eileen takes the opportunity to change the topic. “Sam and I have some news…”
“So…” he begins, but Patience cuts him off quickly.
Jack beams. “That’s important.”
There is now a third long table, spaced out to make sure there’s more than enough room for 19 people to eat without crowding.
“K,” says Jeremy measuring against the rung. Jack hands him a marker.
“Bring it in, Queen,” says Dean standing as Charlie gives another fierce embrace. Miracle jumps on Dean’s chair, and is on the verge of barking hellos to the whole restaurant, excited by all the activity. Dean turns around to grab him, as Charlie slides over to Jeremy.
“Good bye, Sam!”
“I think twelve on Christmas! And they won’t even all be there the whole time, so there’s plenty of room.”
“We’ll need to find somewhere with a heated patio since we have Miracle, but I understand Denver is a dog friendly city. We should be fine,” says Cas in his supportive voice. A grumbling sound comes out of the speaker, and both Dean and Cas can visualize Sam’s eye roll.
Jack and Jeremy gravitate to Cas’ conversation with Gertie, which moves from knitting — apparently Cas is learning — to books and movies. Gertie is thinking about volunteering to sort items at a library some evenings. Although it’s entirely behind the scenes without public interaction, she wants to know what young people are reading and watching. It turns into an opportunity to compare what everyone enjoys, and for Jack to talk about Baby Yoda.
“Dean and Cas will be together for the rest of their lives. Their love is like —
Cas starts blushing, and Dean nudges him. “Hey, it’s a perfectly G-rated memory.”
Dean looked at the sky and lengthening shadows that were starting to edge into a sunset. He put a hand on his heart and started to pray.
“We can stay. Is there somewhere I can hole up with my knitting, though? Just in case I need to be somewhere quiet?”
“Oh Dean, you went through too much, but I still have some things I still want to try to make right.”
Gadreel walks into the living room area, and Sam suggests he take the other club chair.
“What held you up?” Asks Dean as they pile into the second row seats.
“I think we
“I don’t mind. You should.”
He wonders if disliking bunk beds and camp is a left-over from resenting mom and dad for sending him in the first place, since they apparently thought he needed socialization like a puppy. Typical only-child parents, he thinks, but the whole learning to swim thing turned out ok. Thinking about his parents reminds him that he and Jack need to get online and check grades, since he’s promised to at least FaceTime Mom once he gets them. He sighs and then…
Dean sighs and closes the laptop. “Yeah, we need to make sure nobody walks in talking about Jack’s archangel uncles, our werewolf godchildren, or any of the really crazy shit.”
“We did rewatch some of baby Yoda,” says Jack with an excited smile recalling the finale.
“That I am,” says Dean as Cas walks over, coat over his arm. His hair has that end of day disarray that looks so good on him, and he practically hits the woman with his deep blue eyes. “Hello,” says Cas in his gravel voice. The woman behind the desk blinks a few times and then looks at Dean with a slight blush on her cheeks.
Jack is smiling but he mainly seems amused with Jeremy more than anything else, “So basically you got me these so I’d do what you wanted me to do.”
“Maybe you two need a rest in your room,” Dean says with an eyebrow wiggle directed to Jody and Donna.
“Executive Director — it would be to my advantage if he looked and found something wrong. Then I could fix things before we get going, but I don’t know if he’d want to take the time. There are rules about donating services if someone consults for charities, issues about valuation and hours, and on our side, we have to track in-kind donations… ”
Eileen taps Cas on the arm to turn him around. “Let’s go do the tour for Gertie and Charlie.”
“Yeah, an archangel.”
Claire smiles. “That never stopped me, but since Dean’s cutting down, I figure I should cut down, too.”
“Look, go ahead and do that, and if you don’t want to go, come with me for break.”
“No, I mean — does that car not have seat belts?”
Cas smiles. “I can believe it, because you get a perverse pleasure in encouraging that impression.”
Sam says, “Oh that reminds me, this house is pet friendly, so Miracle can go anywhere. No carpet at all, just like at home.”
Cas stops signing his conversation with Eileen, and raises an eyebrow but before he can say anything, Alex raises her hands defensively and says, “I was just joking to lighten things up. It’s not like we can talk about this, so no way to tease anyone,” she grumbles.
Castiel nods. “Thank you, Amara.”
Sam goes to the hallway to mudroom where it turns out there’s a wine chiller. He pulls a bottle of champagne. Rowena nods in approval.
Donna blushes and Jody sets a hand on and her knee. Jeremy smiles and raises an eyebrow and a questioning look at Patience and Alex, not realizing their adopted moms were a new thing. Patience smiles back, and says softly under the other conversation, “I saw it coming, but it was still kinda weird at first.” Alex rolls her eyes and whispers, “Yeah, they were friends a while. It’s newish. It’s good, though.”
Jack frowns and Jeremy feels weird about it.
“Oh…,” Dean says trailing off. He nods, then says, “Ok, I finally get it.”
Dean has a quick memory flash of Cas saying “The voice says I’m running out of minutes.” Just because he can, Dean gives Cas a quick but tender kiss that Cas returns sweet and loving before they slide out of the booth. As they leave, Cas grabs the pie and Dean gives their server an additional tip besides what’s on the table, and says, “For setting up the table for Miracle.” She nods a quick thanks and waves as they leave, needing to clear some dishes. He turns to Cas and says, “Let’s get this show on the road.”
Sam shook his head. “Say to who?”
The alpine coaster goes surprisingly fast, and Jack decides that it’s closer to feeling like flying than the tubing. Dean and Cas seem to like it, too, and are all smiles. Jeremy keeps his DSLR strapped inside his coat, and while he doesn’t take his best lens, he gets some pictures. They all take some pics together on their phones, too, and Jack posts his group chats.
“As long as it has tomato sauce and cheese, I’m good,” says Jeremy.
Jack handed him a pair of silver rings. Dean blushed and turned to Cas. “Cas, would you…”
“She’s very frank about her opinions, and seems enthusiastic about becoming friends, yet I can’t say that know her well.”
“I’m fine. It’s no big deal. It was my fault. I caught you off guard.”
“Yes, it’s a good sign,” answers Kelly. “You sure, nothing disturbing?” Kelly looks carefully at Patience.
Donna, Jody, Patience, Alex and Kelly sit around the landscape rocks.
“Fine, somebody will get you pool noodles in December. Just go on.”
Gertie motions Charlie over and they sit on a bed. Charlie puts one hand over her mother’s.
She glances at Cas. “I’d have to talk to all your Dads. I’m happy to be at the Bunker, if I can be of use, but I don’t get lonely that way anymore. Lawrence might be better.”
Jack, Dean, and Cas all look crestfallen. Kelly says, “Well, at least we have this week.”
No one can ever patch up Cas’ wings thinks Dean. Arlett seems amused by how Cas’ hair is sticking up and with a motherly hand tries without success to tap it down.
My goal is two more chapters and a short optional coda!
“Dude, I just came for hugs and breakfast,” says Charlie pointing to her plate.
Cas whispers, “Tell you later.” Cas stands up. “This is amazing. Thank you so much.”
Patience looks surprised, but brings up her hands as fists and then opens and closes them quickly suggesting small starbursts.
They hear the outer door and then see Kelly walk in with everyone else, including Miracle, following. “We had a minor accident, but everyone’s fine.” Claire gives Jeremy a slap on the back and heads for the barstools, as he follows her. Jack enters with an arm around Kaia, comforting her, as they come in whispering in low voices together. Kaia seems very angry, near tears, and not inclined to hover over anyone stupid enough to get themselves injured
“I get the feeling you probably know as much about mythology as you do about Star Wars.”
“He’s coped with more than he should have, but he’s only human. I’m just glad that he has a friend like you.”
Kelly thinks that most of the time Jack sounds like a young adult, but he sounds very childlike now. They turn off the lights, and Kelly wraps a wing around Jack as they sit in the living room and look at the the snow. It’s cleared up enough that one could see the moon, and maybe still Saturn and Jupiter if they tried. They were so busy that they missed the conjunction a few days ago. Kelly considers telling Jack all about the stars and planets, but thinks maybe it should wait until one day when he can visit them with her. Maybe in a hundred years or so? They should just enjoy the quiet and the feeling of contentment. They look for maybe five minutes or maybe it’s thirty minutes — small bits of time get so stretchy it’s hard to count — but then something niggles at her mind.
Charlie's mom. Rowena. Heaven shenanigans. Advice
“When I started playing the ScholHalls it was for promises to swap cleaning shifts with people, attend hall meetings — stuff like that. Now that everyone is wary, it’s just for fun,” answers Jack.
Cas likes to get Jack whatever he wants. Sam tries to be a practical dad, talk about things rationally, and use phrases like “wants versus needs.” He was the one to set up a budget and accounts for Jack at college. Sam dutifully reviews monthly statements with Jack online. Dean figures that given the deprived childhoods they’ve all had, a few things here and there aren’t going to break them, or turn Jack into an asshole. Also he figures that Cas and Charlie have the Big Blue Bear souvenir covered.
Claire and Kaia scoot off to the rec room. Patience and Alex cut through the dining room to wait at the barstools. Jack, Kelly, Cas, and Dean go to stand around in the foyer. Everyone else stays in the living room. Gertie and Miracle are already up in the alcove. Rowena has made Gadreel promise to pop in somewhere unobtrusive later. Sam and Eileen go to open the door.
“Boo!”
red head Queen, Handmaiden.” says Charlie walking in. She goes to Jack first with a squeal and a hug. “I’m so glad you suggested I drop by.” She plants a big kiss on Jack’s cheek leaving a red mark. “Oh my god, what have I done! I always hated it when my relatives did that to me. I must be getting old. Sorry, Jack.”
“Uh, yeah, that’s an angel name.”
“It’s mainly the Old Angels that spent a lot time on earth that get obsessed about a taste — so Gabe. Sweet is the easiest human taste to learn. They can eventually turn off the whole molecule thing, but takes a very long time and and a lot of effort. I think Balthazar concentrated on wine as soon as it got invented, so he can taste subtle things. I was lucky, since Jack re-made me. I can taste most things that are sweet or very strong in flavor — and also peanut butter. Sweet and spicy food is good. But eating whipped cream from the can is just a thing I did before becoming an angel.”
Jack is though. “Ooh, Alex, I know I shouldn’t ask, but…”
“Every single large vacation rental I looked at had a rec room with a pool table, so this was impossible to mess up.”
“Maybe a little.”
“So, an electric car and an upset young adult who may or may not be romantically interested in our son?” asks Cas.
Patience considers. “I try not to read auras, because it would be too much information all the time if I were attuned to it, but I can do it.” She says, “Sit.”
“Jack! We were going to leave shortly. There isn’t a problem is there?”
A petite woman having a little bit of difficulty carrying a girl who looks about 4 or 5 years old, comes up to Kelly. “Excuse me, this is bit strange, but my daughter is going to be very disappointed if she doesn’t get to say hello to you.”
Dean shakes his head with watery eyes. Cas is going to feel all the emotions stirring in Dean through their bond. He’ll probably be pissed off that his husband isn’t happy in heaven, so he doesn’t envy Mary, but Cas is always forgiving and able to see the pain that others still carry, even in Heaven. Dean thinks that Cas will probably be better at helping Mary than he is.
“Yeah, I’m looking forward to seeing Sam and Eileen,” says Jack.
“Working. Just cracked the case and the corner of the phone. Still good.”
Jeremy looks a little hesitant. “Look, if I ever want to just talk to a parent who’s not one of mine, do you mind if I call Dean or Cas?”
Dean lets out a whistle. “I’ve got a handsome husband and a handsome son.”
Team Free Will has a meeting after dinner with Jody and Donna about the family trust, and they in turn talk to Patience and Alex about their degree plans. Alex admits that it takes pressure off her knowing that Jody and Donna won’t have to help her financially. Patience’s feelings are more complex.
“Hello boys — and my fellow queens,” says Rowena. “Where’s my nephie?”
“Cas,” Kelly calls after a while, beckoning him over with a tilt of her head and a smile. Cas jogs over and she wraps him up in the hug along with Jack. He gives her a kiss on the forehead, like he used to when she was pregnant with Jack, then stands back to look at her, but now that he’s human, he can’t see a form to her grace. “It’s good to see you, dear friend.”
“Cas how long have you been standing there?”
Eileen has moved on from eye roll to her own resting bitch face and says and signs, “tour?” again.
“Yeah.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh God,” say Dean, Cas and Sam at the same time.
Jack rushes over, “I’m sorry, I…”
“But?”
“Same things you know.”
“What the hell? Oh. That’s a Dean thing isn’t it?”
Jeremy goes to the bed that doesn’t have Alex lying down, resting her head on a Tsum-Tsum, and sits still like Patience is taking a picture.
“It’s funny how it worked out, too. It’s better when Ajay tells his story, though,” says Jeremy.
“What color do you think I am?” asks Jack, who’s been standing behind Kelly.
“None of you can be trusted, can you?” Jeremy says, flushed and squashed on the floor.
Dean passes Kelly a mug of hot chocolate that looks right out of a commercial.
They’re near the pink wings again, when Cas stops. “Jack, let’s go ahead and take a picture here. You and me.” Jeremy and Dean direct them to the middle of the wings and Jack stands in front of Cas. Cas lays his chin on Jack’s shoulder and they both smile for the camera. Then Jack decides to give Cas a hug so he turns a bit and they have a sideways hug with their heads close together. Cas gives him a kiss on the forehead and they declare themselves done. They move away so other people can take pictures at the wings, but they stop a few minutes to look the images on the cameras.
Dean gives a sigh, and then says, “Ok, so which other rooms to do you want to hit?”
—————————
“Dean Winchester, your lines are terrible. I’m getting out of here to sit with the boys. Maybe you should take a cold shower.” He makes a show of holding up the coffee and putting it on the nightstand so Dean knows where it is and he grabs a key card. Dean realizes that Miracle hasn’t hopped up asking for bacon. “Speaking of Miracles…?”
“Surprisingly so,” says Sam with a smile on his face. “They’re going to a place with a brick oven, and they’re getting me a garden pizza. And we know everyone else’s faves by now.”
“He’s been trying to get me to run regularly, too, so I’m very surprised he didn’t. Maybe he didn’t want Dean to feel he was the odd one out — you know how he pretends to complain about running.”
Dean stands, too. “Thank you. Now get over here. Hey, kiddo.” He reaches out and hugs Jack and then Charlie. “You, too, J. I’m huggy in my old age.” Jeremy goes over without protest.
Fortunately Miracle has been towel dried, so he’s not sopping wet, but catching a damp dog running around a dining room is a challenge. Miracle pounces around in front of the stairway.
Whew, I got to Christmas! Yay, me.
“I still haven’t figured out what to get you. You might not get a gift until January,” says Jack.
“I told her I was ok. She said that she’s coming early. Later tonight.”
“Hey! Absolutely no sparring this Christmas. We agreed!!”
Dean sputters a bit, while Cas smiles and hums.
“I know Eileen got the whipped cream, but it looks like you and Cas robbed a Starbucks,”comments Sam. At Dean’s annoyed look Sam puts up his hands and adds, “Hey, I’m not complaining.”
“Yes, just like that!” Canada says.
“Damn. With those thighs of yours I think I should sit in your lap.”
“Another aunt?” asks Jeremy.
“Speaking of the rec room, we should play some pool after dinner,”says Dean. He comes in and hands off bottles of beer and soda, then moves to perch on the arm where Cas’ is sitting on the squashy couch next to Claire and Kaia. Miracle jumps up for scritches from Kaia.
“What?”
“A gift’s a gift,” says Claire. Alex raises and eyebrow at that and smiles thinking about Claire and the coyote sweater.
“So are you going to start running, Dad?”
Patience puts a hand over her mouth. Jeremy sits down near Jack. Patience and Alex fill in next to him. Claire looks narrowly at them, as if they’ve taken a side. Cas puts an arm around her and Claire relaxes back in her seat, comfortable between Cas and Kaia.
“Oh yeah! Got it,” He pulls himself back up and sees Jack’s upside down face at the side of the bed. “Case feels cracked, you better check it out,” and he reaches out to give it to Jack. “Brah, sit up or you’ll fall on your head or something.”
“She thought a mini-futon was too much.”
“The ability to show our emotions honestly was hard fought. They’re going to be fierce.”
Jack gives him that squinty look like his Dad.
“Except that I haven’t checked out his car,” says Dean. “What’s he drive?”
“It’s not our choice, but I’ll admit that I’m not ready either. Dean, I think he just wants to make friends right now, so I doubt that it’s going to be an issue on his part. My worry is other young people.
It was a small diner on the outskirts of Austin, painted brighter than most. Usually that meant an intense 1950s vibe, but this was much more laid back. There was rose-tinted natural light from a large picture window showing the setting sun. Something inside of Dean relaxed as they walked in.
“They’re wonderful,” says Kaia going to hug him. As a joke to rile him up, everyone goes to hug him at the same time, and with Alex, Claire and Jack putting their full weight on him from the same direction the whole pile slides off the couch, to a chorus of “oof!” and “ow!”
“He’s still in the boys’ room. I thought we’d leave him there until you finished eating. There’s a key card for their room on the dresser, but I can bring him over now.”
“No, but it helps to focus and it’s a symbol of both initiation and completion, summoning and sending. It’s good form.” Kelly smiles. “I guess some of them also like to use it to be dramatic, like signing your name with a flourish. Both Michael and Gabe snap. Does it seem over the top?”
Once the hot chocolate has been drunk, and the boys have gone off to take noodles and tape upstairs, Cas rests his head on Dean’s shoulder, as Dean rinses mugs.
I want to say thank you to the (probably) 30 people reading this. I appreciate your time!
And apart from the content notes, I just want to say thanks to the people who have kudoed. Also, BIG thanks to Velvet for the comment, which helped me to plow through this chapter.
There’s a gift marked “from Santa” for Dean and Cas that no one takes credit for, and they open it cautiously. Cas lifts out a t-shirt that reads, “Trophy husband.”
Per story, this is Sunday, December 12
Jack smiles, “Let’s go. Oh, and Amara says we need a spa day so she can work on you.”
“Sam’s rented an enormous house for us outside of Denver. It’s a surprise. Dean thinks it’s going to be a couple of plain little cabins. He doesn’t know that we could fit like 20 people if we wanted, and there’s a big kitchen and a pool table.”
Claire says, “I figured I’d say bye now. You’re going to get mobbed on the way out as it is.”
“Heh, heh, yeah. That was a good one,” says Dean with a big smile that crumples into a frown. “So you had a flashback about Sam going bad?”
In the home stretch.
Jeremy voices a very offended “Brah?!”
“That is, Rowena, Queen of Hell, will give us an update on her domain and Team God — with help from Gadreel and Kelly. I’ll follow up with the new family non-profit. Rowena, please continue.”
“Now I’m offended that he didn’t ask me to run the background checks,” quips Charlie.
“No, I appreciate it. It was rude of me to come up here and invade your space the way I did. It’s just a lot easier talking to Jack and his family and friends instead of mine.”
Miracle is laying down on Jack’s lap, not minding him researching tourist spots with his phone just above. Jack pauses and rests a hand on Miracle who gives a squirm of protest, and then settles down again. Jack ignores some alerts and turns to Jeremy. “So what did you think of the Dads?”
“Nah, I won’t take long. I’ll get him.”
“Nah, you just got pretty. Let Patience and me do the chocolate chip cookies while Dean and Cas do the fancy ones,” says Alex.
“Hey,” says Jeremy.
They can hear the ping as Jack sends it, and the waitress comes up. Everyone keeps it simple with burgers, and they get in an order before the rush of people starting to come in.
“Ya know Cas, I’m glad we have legit unlimited plans and good phones nowadays — no more cheap burners. I feel like we spend half our time on the phone.”
Dean smiles big and says “Damn, now that’s what
“I guess that’s what happens when you call them kiddos, hon,” Jody says to Donna, as she walks in and sits next to Jody, getting a kiss on the cheek.
“How about some pecan pie for Cas, and apple for me?” Arlette smiles, “Sure thing!” They’re left to their meal, and Dean does go ahead and help Cas out with his fries.
For some reason that puts both Jack and Jeremy into giggles. After Dean and Cas recover from seeing Jeremy laugh for what feels like a full minute, they find that Charlie has melted, and she agrees to come. She has to pull her laptop out of her courier bag to get a reservation confirmation for the selfie museum, even though the time is sold out.
“I’ve seen him. He’s really good, but I think the word’s out that he’s hard to beat,” says Jeremy
Jeremy’s not sure what to make of that, so they sit in silence a while, until Jeremy’s ready to speak again, “You know, I didn’t think something like this would happen. Jack’s always so cheerful and calm — ok sometimes he does get high key excited — and then sometimes he’s stubborn as fuck over something, but then he’s usually stubborn and calm…maybe just occasionally bossy.”
Dean gets a strange feeling of dread that he didn’t think would happen in heaven. “Sounds like we’ll need breakfast then.”
“You know how the family believes in angels…”
“I’m gonna take video of you walking around opening day, and make you watch. Then you’ll see how every damn person there is trying to get in your pants.”
“I think that tube caught some serious air a few times. So what did you think, Jack? Was it like flying?” asks Jeremy.
Canada asks, “What’s up with King?” King is Canada’s usual way to speak to and about Jeremy, mainly because it mildly irritates him. Jack thinks Canada’s true preferred method is to yell in a booming voice, “Yo, Kiiiinnnngggg,” so that she sounds like a drunk frat boy. It’s funny, but really irritates Jeremy, so Jack made Canada promise to keep that to once a semester, or a special occasion.
Cas comes close to Jeremy and says, “Dean’s a Dog Dad.”
Donna goes up first. “Hey kiddo, we didn’t get to see enough of you. We need a longer stay next time.” Jeremy is pleased that everyone seems to feel that there’s a next time coming up.
“Hello, Sam,” says Kelly who leaves Eileen’s side to give him a quick hug, which he looks surprised by.
He pulls J’s car closer to the front entrance to park. He raises his voice a bit, “Hey Jack and J! We’re at the hotel! Rise and shine!” Jack stretches his body and lifts his arms up. Jeremy rubs his eyes but his body is still in a slumped half ball. By the time Cas comes with Miracle walking on a leash, they still haven’t become vocal, but Jack is at least out of the car. Dean takes his opportunities where he finds them.
At the pool table, as Alex racks the balls, Jeremy motions toward the couch with Cas, Kelly, and essentially Cas’ kids, and asks Dean in a low voice, “Does that ever bother you?”
“A little over seven minutes.”
“They’re teenagers, so I want them close, but not too close. I wanted a little privacy for my husband and me, so definitely not adjoining rooms.”
cool, isn’t it?”
Cas sighs, “The angel bureaucracy loves that sort of thing.” Gadreel and Kelly nod.
Charlie says, “Lemme have your phone.”
“And that his parents know where he is! Give them my number,” adds Cas.
“At Illinois? Indiana? Anyway Ajay is the favorite son,” says Jeremy “and so he says, ‘no problem, mom, I’ll do it for you’ and she’s all pleased about his sacrifice. Well, you can guess…”
Patience says, “That kind of cheerfulness is a very special gift.”
“Awww. Why’d you get so sleepy boy? You’re in the middle of everything.” Dean kneels and boops his nose. Miracle makes a whine full of grievance. “Come on, boy.” Miracle twists on his back a couple times and then rights himself. “Hey now, walk it out,” says Dean standing up and walking back to the dining room getting Miracle to follow, albeit slowly.
“Maybe if you can figure what he wants we could get somebody to make a 3D printer pattern. I know a junior in design.”
Dean says, “Spill it and quit the lead up, Sam,”
“What is with all the plaid prejudice lately?” Grumbles Dean as he catches a waitresses’ attention.
“The juicer is mine,” says Sam.
“Jack, I wanted to show you something. I just started a new account. I guess it’s sort of a finsta…”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not exactly, but it’s not just me. I was worried about you. Time is different here, there are no anniversary dates unless you choose them to be. That sounds good, but the problem is that you don’t know when something is going to hit you bad.”
“Sure. Just another reminder that John didn’t know his father cared about him. John winds up becoming an abusive dick, uses your college fund to buy ammo, and tells me to kill you if you get dangerous. Then we have a sweet kid who I wanted to use as a bomb, but that’s ok because he survived, we got him to college, and now he has a trust fund.” Dean gets up.
“So true,” says Cas.
“Thank you Nephie, but not to worry, my new title will be... Queen of Magic!”
“Thanks,”says Jeremy.
“And we meant to go by the windmills,” says Jeremy.
Songs:
“Huh? Oh the outsider wild card. They didn’t want Claire killing J if he kissed Kaia or any other rom-com moments, right?”
“Yes,” says Kaia.
Patience says, “Gimmie,” and takes a couple glasses from Alex. Jack follows with two more glasses and the bottle.
“Sam, I’m glad you’re back.” Cas steps up for a hug, but quickly says, “Sam, this is Jack’s friend Jer…”
“Jody and Sam think it’s a good idea. Masters degree nurses get paid a lot more, and I could specialize. I just don’t know how much college I can stand before I go crazy.”
Alex gives Patience a squeeze around the shoulders.
Sam raises his hands up and says, “OoooKaayy, so, this might take a little discussion. How about you two talk it over and we’ll meet you back by the luggage?”
Patience smiles.“Yeah, Hufflepuff.”
“Finally,” he mutters as he sees Cas approaching in front of the glass door. Suddenly, there’s a strange silence in the diner as the song ends, but no instrument picks up again. Then a voice without accompanying music sings,
Dean says, “What the hell, Sammy? Of course. Hey, can I still say what the hell?”
“Almost?” asked Dean.
Cas is standing in deep concentration looking at the contents of the trunk. Dean walks out with the old green cooler, a duffle bag, and a couple of coats thrown over his shoulder.
“Jack, you are my favorite nephew.”
Cas says, “Your father started out conservative and religious, but he would have sacrificed anything for you. I’m sure that includes any beliefs that would hurt you. I don’t think you would have had to wait for him to come around to the idea. I believe he would have had no hesitation in accepting you as much as he loved you.”
“What is it?”
As Dean walks in, he sees there’s a very professional looking young woman at the check in. She greets him (not too bubbly) and is ready to take his reservation information. As she confirms a king room and a double room, Dean turns on the charm. “The king is for me and my husband, and the double is for the kids.”
Cas starts laughing loud and hard, and Dean thinks it must be the best sound in the world.
“And aren’t you and Cas ready to start looking for a place of your own to fix up?” asks Jody.
Cas takes in a breath, and Dean says, “Just spit it out.”
“It’s good. I like his other stuff more, because lentils, but yeah,” admits Jeremy.
Gadreel moves through the foyer, taking chairs to the dining room, while the others cluster in the living room.
“The most important thing is that they made an effort — to give Jeremy space by letting him stay with us, and now by getting to know us,” says Cas.
“Yeah, I figured you’ve got so much going on there that he shouldn’t count on it. Well, you know where everything is. I should clean off the coffee table — and DO NOT say let me help!”
Cas nods. “It can be surprisingly easy to hide behind being outgoing.”
“Jack, it just occurred to me — does Jeremy know he’s your best friend? I’m kind of rusty, but I think you’re supposed to tell him.“
“I was just checking. I’ve been told that before,” says Jack with a big smile.
“K,”says Jeremy, a little more relieved.
“In a good way?”
looking into each other’s eyes. Lifting her voice a little, she says, “If you two leave the kitchen, I’ll sound-proof ALL the bedrooms.”
