"Round 3," Dean replied before drinking orange juice straight from the carton. Using the back of his hand to wipe his mouth, he recalled what Cas had told him the night before. "When's your final?"
" Sam's blush worsened and his older brother's laugh followed him out the door. At that moment, his phone vibrated in his pocket and all laughter ceased. He unlocked the device and found coordinates from a blocked number. 'Another job so soon?' he thought with a frown. Another text followed, and Dean's eyebrows shot up. $15K for one hit?
"Your dentist must have a field day with your teeth!" Cas exclaimed with a surprised laugh, only half-joking. "It's a wonder you haven't permanently damaged them with how much plastic you consume."
Cas sighed and sat down on his bed, pressing his head into his hands and elbows into his thighs. The faded gray sweatpants he’d borrowed from Dean still vaguely smelled like him – like whiskey, motor oil, and summer rain - and it gave Castiel comfort.
“Damn Sam, ever heard of a shower?” complained Dean. “I came back from Purgatory lookin’ better than you do right now, bitch.”
Unlike him, she had a clean slate with Dean, one that was not stained by past betrayals and years of heartache. She was able to earn and keep his trust, which was something Castiel wasn’t sure he would ever be able to do again. Dean had every reason in the world to mistrust him, but no reason to doubt Ronnie.
"That's it baby, say my name like that. I wanna hear you beg." Dean pressed his nose against Cas's ballsack, inhaling the sweet yet musky scent of arousal and sweat. He swirled his tongue around the base of Cas's cock, watching as Cas fell apart above him.
Thanks to everyone who commented, left kudos or bookmarked this new project of mine! I almost forgot how fun fanfiction can be. Hope y'all enjoy this new chapter!
"Fuck, Dean, I'm close! Ah!" All at once, Dean had Cas's whole dick down his throat and Cas couldn't hold back any longer. Thick, ropey ejaculate shot down Dean's throat as he shouted through his climax. Dean lapped it all up like a lollipop. Cas completely noodled against the bed, staring at Dean with an expression of unrepressed longing. "I want you to fuck me." he said after a moment, and Dean, whose cock had been slowly losing interest, perked up. "Please, Dean."
“Hey boys!” Ellen Harvelle-Singer greeted warmly, pulling all three of them into a hug. “This is a pleasant surprise!"
“Get in, bitch.” Dean greets Sam as they roll up to the Winchester family home. Deciding to attend the University of Kansas meant they only lived twenty minutes from their families, but still paid the extra money to be in the dorms, just for the independence it offered.
The door to their dorm room opened and Dean came in, tossing his backpack onto his bed and falling back into his chair with a relieved groan. “Long day?” asked Cas, returning to the Q&A video.
A wad of crumpled up looseleaf paper sailed across the room and bonked lightly against Cas's head. Startled, he rolled onto his back and blinked, re-familiarizing himself with reality. Had he really gotten so far into his thoughts that he hadn't heard Dean calling his name?
"Dean..." Cas sighed heavily and walked toward him, cradling Dean's face and jaw, brushing his thumb over the other man's cheekbone. "Be careful." He closed his eyes and pressed his lips against Dean's, trying to convey all of the feelings he wasn't brave enough to say yet. Dean returned the kiss passionately, yanking Cas against him. Cas ended the kiss before Dean could go further, closing himself in the bathroom. Dean waited until he heard the shower turn on, shouldering his duffel. Somehow, the bag felt far heavier than it ever had before.
"Are you hungry?" Cas asked, breaking the silence but still speaking lowly to avoid waking Sam. "Thirsty?" Cas padded over to the kitchenette and Dean watched him go, eyes lingering on the way the robe clung to Cas's ass. He followed Cas, leaning on the archway that separated the foyer from the kitchen. Cas busied himself with getting the Brita pitcher from the refrigerator, murmuring to himself about changing the filter at some point. He poured two glasses of water, as if it was totally normal to be awake at 3 am. Dean approached Cas from behind and rested his hands on the other man's waist. Cas stood to his full height, inhaling sharply when Dean's erection made itself known against the cleft of his rear.
"I-yes. Yes, I'll care for him." If Cas wanted to, he could probably send Dean to stay with his foster parents, Jody and Bobby, but something stopped him from calling them. Sure, he'd have to let them know at some point that their foster son had been hospitalized, but the idea of sending him to live in South Dakota seemed petty and immature in Cas's mind, especially since Cas was perfectly capable of caring for him.
“I built her from the ground up.” Dean bragged. He knew he shouldn’t, but it felt good to be proud of something for once.
"Sam's having a friend over at the apartment tonight," Cas told Dean conversationally, and Dean harrumphed. He scrawled out a response on his whiteboard,
"M'horny, Cas." Dean rumbled and Cas shivered. "Always am, after a job." he added, jutting his hips forward ever so slightly. Cas gasped outright this time. Smirking victoriously, Dean reached for the knot that kept Cas's robe closed, intent on fixing the issue, when Cas's hand clasped around his wrist like a Venus Flytrap around an idiotic fly, halting his movements. "Baby?" he asked, perplexed. Cas turned toward him with the glass of water in his hand, moving out of his embrace and putting roughly a foot between them.
Dean half-shrugged, which was Winchester-ese for 'I'm embarrassed and I want to stop talking about this particular thing.'
"Dean..." he murmured, unsure what else to say. Should he apologize? Should he pretend everything was normal? Should he...?
"You know, you can learn a lot about a person by what they carry on their person. For example, you have several state IDs in your wallet, most of which are expired, except for the California one. This tells me that you live, or at the very least spend a significant amount of time in, the Golden State." Zachariah got to his feet and approached Dean, a satisfied smirk curling his lips. "Now, what could keep you coming back to that specific state, as an assassin for hire, if not family or a significant other?"
The further away he got from the dorm, the more his anger and hurt ebbed. He still felt them, but they weren't quite as violent as the volcanic eruption he'd caused in front of Dean. He groaned and stared up at the sky, as if the stars would give him some kind of answer. The night was remarkably clear for urban Kansas, and Cas automatically searched for the North Star as his father had taught him to do whenever he felt lost.
“Dean,” Cas said, still not looking at him. The angel clenched his jaw, similarly to how Dean did when he was upset, and Dean decided to take a risk.
The comments and tweets just would not stop coming. Never mind the direct messages and private chatrooms.
He'd been working on his sign language in between studying for finals, so he signed to her, 'Hi, Eileen. I hope I'm not bothering you.'
“Don’t worry about that.” Chuck snapped his fingers, and Cas’s eyes snapped open along with his mouth, which gasped for air. “I couldn’t restore his grace, so he’s human now, but I imagine that won’t be a problem.”
"You've been starin' holes in my face for the last five hours." Dean informed him without preamble. "Is there somethin' on your mind, Cas?" Cas's brow puckered as he considered how to approach the subject delicately.
Cas yanked his jacket from the hook and threw open the door, desperate for fresh air and to for the searing pain in his chest to stop. He'd always believed broken hearts were metaphorical, but if this agony was anything to go by, they were most definitely not a figure of speech. If Dean called out for him, he didn't hear it.
"And now he repeats it, as if it wasn't abundantly clear already!" Cas scoffed, laughing incredulously but humorlessly at the same time. "You want to know why I hate your pen-chewing habit so much? Because it nearly drives me mad with lust every time you do it. Because watching you flirt with girls causes me physical
“So, I was thinkin’ today I want to do some work on Baby. Routine stuff – change the oil, clean up the inside…” he met Ronnie’s enthusiastic gaze. “Wanna help?”
“It means that I am somewhere between sexual and asexual. I do not feel…sexually attracted to someone until I’ve formed an emotional connection with them.”
“I already told you,” Cas said, and Dean noticed that Cas wouldn’t look at him. “Lucifer’s child created this alternate dimension.”
"Dean, we live together." Cas replied flatly, despite the way his heart skittered at Dean's word choice.
They were silent, and Dean’s fingers itched to touch, to know if Cas’s hair was as soft as he’d always thought. He craved Cas with an intensity so strong is frightened him sometimes.
Once they were back in their dorm room, it took all of ten seconds for Dean to start chewing on a pen cap again. Castiel tried to ignore it, but the sound and the visuals his mind had been steadily supplying had brought him to his wit's end.
“I know what you meant, I didn’t think you were askin’ me to make a sex tape,” teased Dean, and Cas coughed, shifting his legs to cover the halfie he was now sporting. “Uh, sure. I guess.”
Dean smiled and, after making sure Cas was 100% okay with it, pressed his pointer finger into the other boy's entrance. Cas hissed at the intrusion, even as Dean did it so slow and gentle that Cas wanted to cry. A few pumps of one finger, and Dean pressed two in. The stretch was a glorious pain for Cas, who screamed his pleasure into a pillow. Dean pulled two fingers out, watching with amazement as Cas's hole gaped at him. "You ain't seen anything yet."
It took everything in Dean not to roll his eyes as his target pled for his pitiful life. He'd already been paid for this gig and this bastard had been a bitch and a half to find. Now, he was getting on his last nerve.
“You already did, but shoot.” Dean stood up and stretched, the bones of his spine popping as they realigned with his movement. Cas forced himself not to stare at the tan skin of his stomach that revealed itself when Dean raised his arms.
"KU's the only place where I feel like I can be myself." Dean said roughly. He cleared his throat but Cas could still hear the pain in between Dean's words. "And you're a big part of that."
“So you like meat and reading up on the things that go bump in the night…what else?” Dean asked around a mouthful of burger. Cas picked at his salad, his eyes downcast. Dean would ask him about it later.
"Hello, Mr. Collins. I'm sorry to wake you, but you're listed as the emergency contact for Dean Winchester. He's just been admitted to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. Nothing life threatening, but his jaw was dislocated and he's therefore unable to speak on his own behalf. Would it be too much trouble for you to come and sign some paperwork?"
"Cas, make up your mind." Dean grumbled through gritted teeth. "Either go or don't." Cas went, holding the swinging door open for Dean habitually. "I'm not a girl, I can open the door for myself." he snarked, and Castiel sighed once again.
Ronnie just barely resisted the urge to roll her eyes and opened her mouth to say something, but her phone rang.
"I was just thinking about when we met." Castiel answered honestly. He'd found that, even though he was keeping his the truth of his feelings from Dean, if he spoke candidly about other things, the ache in the center of his ribcage throbbed less.
Dean blinked, trying to process everything Cas was telling him. To Cas, it looked more and more like rejection. His heart, poor, beleaguered thing that it was, still beat like he'd been running in a marathon, though this was mostly adrenaline now.
Dean jumped, jostling his laptop in the process. The paper he was supposed to be writing, hadn’t, surprise surprise, just appeared before him like he’d hoped.
"You're lucky I'm too sex-addled to be mad at you." Cas told him, turning away. Dean pulled him into an embrace.
open on his lap. “So, I’ve been updating the Men of Letters’ archives, digitalizing them. You won’t believe some of the stuff I found.”
“Dean-” Cas’s voice broke, and he clenched his fists in his sheets. God, how many times had he pictured this exact same scenario? His heart was beating like a jackhammer, so fast and hard that it could crack cement.
"Not gonna lie, Cas, it kinda feels like I'm on trial for somethin'." Dean glanced toward the spot where the cap had been thrown as if he were a puppy whose owner had discarded their favorite toy. Cas exhaled through his nose and leaned away from Dean before standing up. "Where are you going? We still have one and a half movies left!"
The Winchester brothers turned to see Ronnie in the door frame, wearing a large Ole Miss t-shirt and pajama pants. Her skin was the color of toffee, and she had a sprinkle of freckles across her cheekbones. Her hair was curly and short, styled similarly to her mother’s.
Speaking of Dean's oral fixation, he currently had a straw in his mouth that he chewed on as he laughed at something Charlie said. Cas swallowed hard against the wave of desire that rolled through him. All he could hear was the dull buzz that filled his mind with static. What could Dean have going on that he wasn't aware of?
Dean only has to pull a little bit on Cas’s arm, and his best friend is falling into his arms, like the angel he was named for.
"Yes. He's exhausted himself stressing about one of his final exams despite my repeated encouragement that he will do just fine."
Jiffy Burger was probably the thousandth quick bite joint that Dean had been in, but they all managed to do something different with their meat. The double bacon cheeseburger was simply to
A warm flush trickled up Cas’s neck to bloom on his face, but before he could make an excuse for it the conversation had shifted.
to be there. Somehow, he’d let it slip along the way that he lived with his best friend, and his viewers were dying to meet him.
"Have you tried?" Castiel inquired, to which he got a noncommittal shrug. In Winchester-ese, that meant 'no.' "Well, I think you should. Give him a chance to surprise you. He's certainly shocked me more times than I can count." Sam glanced up at him, eyes wide, and Castiel wished he could take the words he'd just said and shove them back down his gullet. "Sam-"
“Is that bacon?” Ronnie came into the room then and grabbed three slices. Dean grinned, forgetting Cas for the moment.
"I'm not letting you out of my sight for the next 36 to 48 hours." Castiel answered, and Dean shot him a confused look over his shoulder. "I've already looked into getting someone to take notes for you in your classes. You'll have to go in for your midterms, but I'm handling everything else."
on his board. "Very well then. The nurse should be in soon with those papers and you will be free to go."
Dean whined via the whiteboard, and Cas smirked in spite of himself. Perhaps now Dean would feel a modicum of the emotions Castiel felt when the tables were turned. When Castiel was up half the night worrying about Dean's safety, when he turned down date requests because even though their relationship was
"What's up?" she asked, signing it for emphasis. Sam chuckled nervously. He made sure to talk slower so that she could read his lips.
"It's unsanitary, for one." Cas replied. "Two, it's incredibly bad for your teeth and the inside of your mouth," he took the offending cap from Dean's hand and threw it across the room. It landed in the corner with a far-away, tiny clattering sound."And three, you could be spreading viruses and bacteria to anyone you lend the pen too. How often have you given Charlie one of your monstrosities so she could write her name at the top of her test? Or Sam?"
Predictably, Dean Winchester threw a massive wrench into his well-laid plans. A mechanical engineering major with a love for classic rock, cars, and corny jokes, Dean was far from what Castiel had anticipated his soulmate to be like, but he couldn't help it. Dean was handsome, incredibly smart, modest, great with kids, and a truly wonderful friend. The fact that Dean wanted to stay local and potentially take over his godfather, Bobby Singer's, shop once Bobby retired conflicted with Cas's California dreams.
“I’m just saying,” Sam says with a shrug, “pretty weird that that was a big enough deal to you guys for it to manifest all that anger in you.” When Dean shoots him another glare, he continues, “Just my two cents.”
The bartender pauses to think. “Um…I’m not totally sure. Maybe like, two, three minutes after I heard Rita say she didn’t love him? It got pretty rowdy pretty fast, and they wouldn’t listen when I told them to keep it down.”
“She didn’t have much on these guys or the previous sets of vics besides what we already knew. Perfectly happy couples gone sour, lotta yelling, turned into pretty brutal murder-suicides. What I did get is that all the vics so far have been regulars at this bar called The Tree Trunk.”
To his left, Dean is staring at the building. Cas watches him patiently, waiting for an indication to head inside. He gets none.
“No, you know what, fuck you! You should appreciate me more!” Marcus snarls, slamming the kitchen door as he storms into the room after Cara.
in love with you! But, then again, it could have been those god-awful loafers you insist on wearing everywhere that put me off!”
“Great, so, obviously, me and Dean aren’t going on a fake date, and I think it’s best if the two of you pose as a couple while I set up the weapon outside.”
“What the fuck?” Sam breathes when he comes to a stop in front of them, and Dean realises his brother isn’t meeting his eyes. He’s staring just below them, at Dean’s left cheek.
After a few moments of stunned silence, Cas realises he can breathe a little easier now the creature has departed. He carefully peels himself off of the wall. He can still feel the curse thrumming in his head, but it doesn’t feel like it’s trying to eat through his brain anymore, which is nice.
With an amused breath, Cas leans forward to bump his forehead against Dean’s and, suddenly, Dean has nothing else to say. Nothing except that one fucking thing he’s been putting off for so long, that birdsong, that open door, that death sentence, the end of his piece that he’s been selfishly and stupidly trying to avoid as though that’ll delay the inevitable. He feels like he’s halfway up a mountain he knows he’ll never get to make it down. Ah, well. May as well try to reach the top, anyway.
This upsets Cas. Dean doesn’t understand. He never has. “Feeling something and wanting something are very different things, Dean,” he says, voice sharp and firm and climbing up closer to match Dean’s volume. “I figured that, if you wanted to talk to me about how you felt, you would do so. You never did, so I drew my own conclusions.”
“Well, at least we got a name. Might be more lore on it online. And, hey,” Dean says, a grin widening on his face, “now we know this thing’s never struck two nights in a row before, I’m thinkin’ dinner.”
“Billie,” he manages, somehow. “Billie was...she was coming after us, and we were hiding in one of the storage rooms. Some...some black goopy shit just started appearing when we were in there. Then Billie got in. It took her. Then it took Cas. He’s…I don’t even know what the fuck it
If he’d been stronger, less selfish, he coulda kept to his own damn rule of not letting people too close. Cas would probably still be gone, sure, but at least Dean would be, too.
Dean sighs. He doesn’t know how to explain this, seeing as he hardly has any fucking clue what happened himself. His fingers feel numb. So does his brain.
Cas looks at Dean again, smiling, still, in spite of everything. He inhales deeply as the black goo surges forward, tendrils curling up and around his body, consuming him. A tear rolls down his cheek as the blackness creeps up his neck and over his head.
Jerry takes one step towards his fiancée before she figures out what he’s doing and starts to scream – awful and loud and gut-wrenching – and stumbles backwards. She isn’t fast enough; Jerry plunges the sign into her stomach, twisting and twisting, pushing it as deep as it will go. Strange hands grab at him, try to stop him, but Rita collapses as he pushes her body off of the makeshift blade and Jerry simply shrugs his neighbours off.
“Cas,” Sam says, “you don’t have to come back with us, you know, we can meet you somewhere in the morning.”
He watches for one. Dean, naturally, gives him nothing by way of facial expressions, even though he must be aware of how intently Cas is staring at him from the backseat. He tries to use his grace to sense how Dean might be feeling, but doing so feels like smacking his grace against a wall in Dean’s mind.
Maia smiles at him one last time before leaving. When he can finally exhale, relieved, he sees Dean’s expression. He looks pained.
“Okay.” Dean sighs heavily. “We gotta try it.” He pulls his arms away from Cas’ shoulders to rest a hand tentatively on the small of his back. Slowly, he begins to guide Cas out of the alley and towards the car.
and a crash of glass, and they pull away. Cas tries and fails to drag his eyes away from Dean’s face, but notices the room has gone dark. He must have burst a lightbulb.
When Cas looks back at Dean, he sees him looking at Sam, mouth open in surprise. Sam is looking back at him with wide eyes.
“Shit. I didn’t…Cas, you know I didn’t mean it like – like – ‘I don’t ever wanna talk about this’ or, I dunno, ‘leave me alone’, or something. I just knew I wasn’t in the right kinda mind frame to deal with it all. I thought, if you tried bringing it up, I’d probably freak out and say some shit I didn’t mean. Didn’t wanna fuck this up any more than it already was. Guess I was thinkin’ it too hard and it turned into a prayer.”
As Sam backs up, he manages to lure the vastamare into the circle he painted on the ground, which seems to work now that Cas isn’t stood inside it. The creature struggles against the bounds of the trap, but still lunges at Sam with its claws.
Dean turns to look at him, sighs, says, “Yeah, all right,” and then grabs Cas’ hand. He shoots Cas a smile that doesn’t reach his eyes.
“And that’s without even mentioning the literal date the two of you were just on in there. Sorry to cut that short, by the way,” he says, not sounding sorry at all, “looked like you were having a
“It’s…a lot, all at once. Hard to process. I’m tryin’ to focus on being glad I didn’t end up killing you, you know?”
“You said you can feel how I feel, right?” Dean’s voice is a little higher, now. More desperate. “So, you already know. You – you
Dean’s eyes snap up to meet Cas’, and he still has that look on his face when he says, “I…yeah, Cas, you look great.”
“You know,” Dean starts, his forced tone of composure and half-hearted chuckle startling Cas into looking up at him again, interrupting what had looked like a moment of deep thought, “this is technically our last night on Earth.”
“I still don’t get why you didn’t wake us up, man,” Dean huffs as he follows Sam and Cas into a diner for breakfast later that morning. “We all coulda gone at five a.m. no problem.”
Dean closes his eyes, throat bobbing as he swallows. “Cas–” he starts, and his tone betrays the fact that he’s going to deflect.
He looks around the kitchen carefully as Dean wanders over to the sheriff. He tries to be as inconspicuous as possible, but still makes sure he peers into every cupboard, looking for hex bags or sulfur or strange symbols, anything that might indicate some supernatural involvement in the Wallaces’ deaths. He stands with his back to the rest of the room in an attempt to conceal the gentle, white glow that spreads from his palm as he uses his grace to search for further evidence.
Cas shakes his head. “It isn’t exactly like that. I’m not a mind reader, Dean, I can’t see all the thoughts you’re having. It’s like I can feel some of what you’re feeling.” He finds this difficult to explain, so opts to use an example to illustrate it. “For instance, right now, I can feel that you’re scared, but there’s no way for me to tell what exactly it is you’re scared of.”
Cas obediently opens a packet of sugar and pours it into the mug, testing another small sip. It’s still intolerable. He repeats the process with some sweetener, next, but that does nothing to improve the drink, either. He then tries the same with a pot of creamer, to no avail.
“Hey, Cas,” Sam cuts in, perhaps in a deliberate attempt to save him from Dean’s groans, “find out any new info online last night?”
Cas stands and approaches slowly, not wanting Dean to get jumpy again, and gently places his hand on the gash. His thumb presses, unintentionally, against the scar of his own handprint. Dean closes his eyes against Cas’ grace, and Cas can’t help but watch as his face slackens. The wound heals and the remaining blood on Dean’s arm gets mopped up.
Cas takes a step towards Dean, still yelling at the top of his voice. “I love that being around you makes me feel safe!”
How the hell are you meant to go on after you’ve killed the love of your damn life? He doesn’t think there’s a way to come back from that. It sure as hell doesn’t feel like there is.
“Wait, wait, wait.” Dean snaps out of his sulk, frowning at them. “A pretend date, why would we do that? I don’t wanna do that.”
“All right,” Sam says when he catches his breath, “we should head back to the motel, prep this weapon we need.”
Dean starts nodding quickly, and Cas half expects him to start up his endless stream of ‘okay’s again.
He can hear Dean laughing and can’t help himself from laughing too, despite the warmth of his cheeks. He looks back up at Dean, and his grin only widens when their eyes meet. This whole ‘date’ thing is easier than he thought it’d be. Perhaps that’s because it’s with Dean.
He eyes Sam and Dean. They are both still sleeping heavily and won’t wake up – naturally, at least – for another hour, minimum, so Cas decides to head over to the crime scene alone.
Cas debates continuing his insistence that he isn’t interested in the waitress, but thinks social conventions might dictate that he should answer Sam’s question first. “No. I don’t eat.”
“It was nice,” Cas tells him. “Dean let me play Billy Joel in the car; I don’t think he hates his music as much as he says he does.”
He drove there on autopilot in total silence, having no trouble at all pushing through his tiredness and doing the journey in one go. It’s probably a good thing; he doesn’t think he’d have been able to sleep if he’d tried.
With a sigh, Cas looks at himself in the mirror. He twists and turns, trying to find an angle that he thinks makes the new outfit look better on him than it feels. This turns out to be a difficult task now he isn’t being fixed with an awestruck expression from Dean; without that, he struggles to feel like it suits him at all.
After a moment of observation, Sam nods. “I guess it’ll do.” He turns to survey Cas’ outfit. “I like your jacket, Cas.”
Once Dean spots him, Cas finds himself fixed with the same look Dean had given him in the changing room at the store. Cas isn’t looking at Dean’s outfit anymore; he can’t seem to tear his eyes away from that expression on Dean’s face as his eyes slowly roam Cas’ new clothes.
He gets two grumbled and blatantly untrue ‘I’m fine’s in return as Cas snaps his feet into action to deal with the remnants of the creature that had come so close to claiming both his and Dean’s lives. Crouching over the pile of dust, he waves a hand and sets it on fire. He is joined by Sam and – at a noticeable distance – Dean, as they stand in a quiet semicircle to watch the vastamare burn.
“I then found out that, due to frogs being freshwater creatures, their bodies have a much higher salt content than the water around them. This is why, instead of needing to drink, they can just absorb water through the skin on their stomachs and thighs, which is much more efficient.”
Dean finally looks at Cas, grinning like a cat that had just brought his owner a dead bird. Completely at a loss for what to say or do, Cas trains his eyes on the wall just to the side of the waitress, hoping desperately for this whole thing to end so he can figure out how to breathe again.
Squeezing Dean’s side, Cas grins and turns his head so Dean’s hair tickles his mouth. “Very stupid.”
With still no reaction from Dean, Cas isn’t sure if he would want Cas to use his grace or not. He sees no point in asking, since he doubts he’ll get an answer.
Cas tilts his head, a wobbly smile playing on his lips as he recalls the first time Dean said those words to him. “I still don’t understand the significance of that line.”
By the time they reach the door, Dean seems a little more aware of what’s going on, and nearly falls over himself trying to hold the door open without letting Cas’ hand go. He nods for Cas to head in first, and Cas smiles warmly at him before leading him into the bar.
Behind the tower of black goo that was once Cas, Billie stands determined, scythe ready to fight against this strange entity. She doesn’t get the chance. It takes her quicker than it took Cas, as though she’s some kind of added bonus while Cas was the main meal.
He takes Cas’ mixtape out of the slot and rummages through his box of tapes. Led Zeppelin, REM, and Bon Jovi all get picked up and quickly tossed back in. Dean ponders Bob Seger for a while before that makes its way back into the box, too. Sam groans and begs Dean to just pick one so they can go, but Dean ignores him, eyeing up an old Motörhead tape. That clacks against the others as Dean throws it back in, scowling at his extensive collection as though it’s somehow offended him. He grumbles something under his breath as Sam clears his throat very loudly and deliberately. It’s been almost five minutes by the time Dean realises he’s started picking up tapes he’s already looked at and discarded, so, with an incredibly overdramatic sigh, he picks up Cas’ Billy Joel mixtape and puts it back on.
Finally, Cas spots Sheriff Martin over by the bodies and starts making his way towards her, instead, hoping she’ll have more information on the deaths than that strange man or Officer Sanchez. She is wearing soft pink flannel pyjamas with her sheriff’s hat, coat, and boots on over the top, and Cas thinks she must be quite cold.
And it’s gonna be his fault, his fault for leaving Sam and Jack, his fault for bringing Cas back to the bunker, and he can’t save them. He can’t stop it, he can’t do anything.
Sam nods. “One of the neighbours mentioned that, too. She also said she heard the Wallaces arguing before the screaming started, and it was so loud she called the cops. I saw a neighbour of the first vics there, too, and he said something similar about them.”
Before he can nod, Cas has to pause to brace himself against another urge to – somewhat literally – spill his guts out.
It seems that Dean has failed to notice that Cas has used up every drink additive the diner provided their table, as he takes a large gulp before clapping his hand over his mouth, disgusted.
Sanchez stalks towards them, entering the circular trap on the floor as though its existence doesn’t faze him in the slightest. Even as he pauses his stride – seemingly as a silent gloat that their trap has somehow failed – Cas feels no different, though the circle was supposed to ease the effects of the curse.
Cas’ fire is efficient, so it only takes a minute or so for the remains to be more-or-less burned away entirely. He raises a hand to Sam in a silent question and, when Sam nods, heals the injuries he sustained from fighting the vastamare. The pair of them then get to work on scuffing out the circular trap with their shoes.
With a controlled nod, Cas says, slowly, “I feel tired and confused, but more comfortable now I’m not wearing that awful jacket.”
Dean doesn’t say anything as they manoeuvre through the front yard to find Sam waiting for them by the crowd of civilians outside of the caution tape. They head back towards Baby as Dean starts reciting what he learned from the sheriff.
Cas then looks around the crowd, trying to locate the sheriff so he can talk to her, though he spots several other familiar faces first, including Maia and the other waitress who had served them at the restaurant, sobbing and in their pyjamas, and Officer Sanchez, dressed in casual clothes, apparently not on-duty. Cas slides through the crowd to get to him.
“They were all here last night,” he says. “All said pretty much the same thing: heard the raised voices and saw them get kicked out, but didn’t think anything of it at the time. Why would they?”
He then wonders whether he should do something with his hair. There isn’t that much of it, and he also has no idea how hair-styling works, so he finds he can’t do a lot to change how it looks. His runs his hands through his hair a few times to push it back a little more than usual, and thinks it looks quite smart.
Cas fails completely and spectacularly to comprehend why Dean has concerns about this; it’s a very logical plan that protects more civilians from harm and should allow them to kill the creature that’s been slaughtering Keeley Forest residents with no intentions of stopping any time soon. He has heard Dean say several times in the past that hindsight’s a bitch, and this is a saying he remembers as soon as Sam continues speaking as though Dean hadn’t cut in at all.
Dean holds up his hands in defeat and starts talking to Sam. Cas just sits there quietly, the words ‘incredibly attractive’ rattling uselessly around in his head. He quite likes them, especially coming from Dean.
Cas nods. “Good. The other thing the people on the forum were talking about was that the vastamare enjoys watching the process of the couples arguing and killing each other.”
“You’ve been acting strangely about it since Sam brought it up. We can try something else if you aren’t comfortable. I understand, and you know Sam will, too.”
With a well-timed swipe, the vastamare catches Sam’s torso with its claw, not deeply enough to cause any serious damage, but with enough force to send him falling onto his ass
While Sam is asleep, Cas watches Dean, hoping he might take this opportunity of relative privacy to say something – literally anything, Cas wouldn’t mind. He just needs some indication from Dean as to how they’re going to be approaching this situation. Cas wants to speak up, wants to ask him if they’re going to talk about it or act like it never happened, but he’s worried Dean’s forced composure will snap if he brings it up, and he isn’t looking to start any unnecessary arguments. Dean will talk about it – or fully commit himself to
is going on - and he realises, approximately one life-changing confession too late, exactly what’s about to happen.
“It did not take me half-an-hour to try the clothes on,” Cas informs Sam. “How is the duck blood mixture coming along?”
“So,” Cas says drily, “as long as no one gets cursed while you’re outside painting a circle on the ground, we’ll be fine.”
Sam wanders over to them, tiny notebook in hand, having finished speaking with all three of the patrons.
, and it might have been mistaken for the wind if not for the utter silence in the car. Cas is sure it wasn’t on purpose – he doubts that Dean even knows he’s done it, since his deliberate prayers always start with him addressing Cas in some way – but it was
It isn’t long before Dean pulls up opposite a small house that’s blocked off with yellow tape and surrounded by people, most of whom are milling around anxiously. Dean turns off the engine and, with it, the music, before passing out the fake FBI IDs.
“But, then,” Sam says, voice a little croaky with emotion, “why did it wait ‘til now to come and collect?”
Cas doesn’t know how to respond but, luckily, it seems he doesn’t have to figure it out, as he finds himself saying, “You heard me. I love you. I’ve loved you from the moment I pulled you out of Hell.”
. It goes for another swing, but Sam kicks and takes out the creature’s legs before it can slice him.
Another thud echoes through the small storage room. Dean rounds the chair, unable to take his eyes off of Cas.
Dean suddenly looks to be experiencing some form of internal despair. His eyes focus on his hand for a while as it moves up and down Cas’ sleeve. It seems like he’s resolved himself to ignoring Cas’ statement entirely, but then he moves his hand slowly back to Cas’, curling their fingers together on top of the bar a little too tightly. When he speaks, he tries and fails quite blatantly for a light-hearted, jokey tone.
“It can,” Cas says, earning him two very baffled looks. “Do you remember when I said I recognised that smell from somewhere?” –the guys nod– “It smells like a flower called the
“Thank you both,” Cas says, touched. “I hadn’t taken your comment personally Dean, and, Sam, your reassurance is appreciated.”
There’s another loud bang on the door and Dean thinks, somewhere in the back of his mind, that this is it. This is the end. If he could focus on anything other than the way Cas is looking at him, he thinks he might actually react. For all that he would trust Cas with his life, he does
The vastamare lands, albeit gracefully, face-first on the gravel. Sam scrambles to his feet and raises the stake to end it, but the vastamare recovers quickly, pushing up off of the ground and slamming into Sam with its back.
He hears Dean say his name again, so pulls open the curtain to show him. Dean immediately stops tapping his fingers along to Billy Joel on the seat (he stopped quickly, but Cas would recognise
Without any further warning, it starts backing into the thick cluster of trees on the other side of the alley. Both Sam and Dean start to run after it, but stagger to a halt when they lose sight of the creature almost instantly. It seems to have melted into the shadows between the trees and disappeared from view entirely.
‘secret’ in particular to manipulate Dean and Cas into killing each other. He’s certain he must have kept enough other secrets from Dean over their many years of fighting side-by-side and navigating countless apocalypses together that would likely elicit a far angrier response from Dean than
“I’ll run ahead, get to work on setting another of those traps out here,” Sam says, getting out of the car and grabbing the stake from the trunk. “Whatever the reason for it not working before, we shouldn’t risk not having one on hand this time. You guys catch up as soon as you can.” He starts making his way across the parking lot in the direction of the factory building.
Still keeping his distance, Dean squats to pick up the stake, and Cas sees him hesitate with his hand hovering over it for a moment before he grabs it and strides over to put it in Baby’s trunk.
Recognising a pattern, he’d started to hold it back. If he didn’t say it outright, if he held the people he loved at a distance, then he’d be keeping them safe from him without losing them completely.
“Well, good. And, look, I know I just said to be obvious, but you don’t have to, like, go overboard with the dramatics or anything.”
“We could attempt to ‘ease into it’, as you say. Like with how…in the car, did you mean to pray to me?”
It isn’t long before a waitress bustles over to take their orders. Sam gets a breakfast garden wrap with a water, Dean gets a five stack of bacon and syrup pancakes with a coffee, and Cas very nearly forgets what Dean had told him the night before about it being polite to always order something.
.” Dean starts at the sharpness of his tone. “What, you don’t think I do my own research before picking out who to curse? No, come on, with the way you idiots look at each other? How you practically always have your hands in each other’s pockets? There ain’t no denying it. You’ve been giving off marriage vibes from the moment I saw you. Plus,” he winks at Dean, “I had to check, to make extra sure, and the way you got all protective when I insulted him in the bar earlier and charged me a minute ago were
No one acknowledges that he’s spoken. He sighs heavily and doesn’t try to talk again. Several minutes later, Cas feels him drift off to sleep and envies him. He supposes it’s fair, since Sam had done essentially all of the physical work on the case whilst he and Dean had been dealing with the curse.
Cas half-laughs, half-sniffs, producing some weird snorty kinda noise that sends a wet laugh bubbling out of Dean unbidden. He ducks his head to hide his expression as he tries not to choke on it, tries not to give into his light-headedness and pass out then and there.
Walking is significantly easier now that Cas doesn’t require the use of all of his energy to keep his thoughts in check. He takes this time as they migrate across the parking lot to wonder why the vastamare’s curse latched onto
Dean scans for the source of the noise, his hands trailing down Cas’ cheeks so his fingertips rest on his jaw. His eyes land on the bedside table and its tall, definitely-lit-a-few-moments-ago lamp.
Cas suspects he’s deliberately leaving that opening for either him or Dean to start talking about their side of that evening’s events, but neither of them do. Sam sighs again.
Cas is vaguely aware of how scared Dean sounds as his hands move to cup Cas’ cheeks, tilting his head up to look him in the eyes. Cas tries to explain what’s happening to him, but the words that threaten, unbidden, to form on his tongue when he opens his mouth are ones he’s kept buried for years – not out of shame or even fear, really, more out of grief – ones he isn’t sure he wants leaking out into the world, ones that have floated through his mind more times than he can count this evening alone but would never dare say out loud.
Sam scoffs. “Dean, this is literally a wrap. Rabbits don’t eat wraps. Besides,” he says, twisting his plate to give Dean a better view, “it’s mostly falafel and avocado in here, some leaves, tomatoes, and I think some sweet chilli sauce, actually. It’s nice.”
Dean shoots his brother a glare. “Just took Cas a half-hour to try his clothes on,” he grumbles before moving over to his bed and lying face-down.
Unfortunately, that seems to encourage it to turn on Cas. It leans right into his space with a sneer, breathing the thick scent of rotting flesh all over his face.
“Look, man, sorry for saying that shit before about your people skills freaking people out, okay? That was a dick move, and I don’t want you thinkin’ I meant it the same way that douchebag in the bar did.”
Judging by his expression, it’s pretty clear that Dean hates this entire situation with a vehemence.
With care, Sam takes the tape and slides it back into the box with all the others, which Cas appreciates. He then finds himself wondering how much of his and Dean’s…conversation, for lack of a better term, Sam had heard. He’s sure most of it would have been difficult to miss, even from a distance, with how ridiculously loudly they had been shouting.
When Dean doesn’t react, Cas considers healing him, anyway, since he’s apparently too proud to admit he needs it, but Cas doesn’t like to use his grace to heal larger injuries without permission, unless the person in question isn’t conscious enough to give it. Cas is unsure whether Dean’s resistance is to being healed by grace, by Cas, or just being healed at all (because Dean is like that, sometimes, however infuriating Cas may find it), so he waits, hoping for some elaboration. He gets none.
Something rather strange begins happening to Sanchez; he flings his arms out to his sides as his fingers start to fade into a black mist. The dark shadow spreads slowly up his arms as his feet start melting into black smoke, too. His fingers, suddenly looking alarmingly far from human, stretch out into sharp points as the translucent shadow starts to thicken there until his hands resemble claws. Once dark brown, his eyes now glow brightly, green and piercing. He bares his claws and makes a low hiss.
It snickers when Cas doesn’t respond, though he can think of some very choice things he’d say to it if he trusted himself to get the right words out.
The vastamare stumbles back as Sam gives it a hard push, twisting the stake in his hand to get a better angle to swing from.
All he comes up with is a faint smell by the window, something he recognises but can’t remember exactly where from. He almost misses it, and he suspects he was only able to notice it because of his angelic senses. It’s highly unpleasant and resembles rotting flesh, just a little more fragrant, as though someone had tried, for whatever reason, to make a corpse-scented perfume. Cas scrunches his nose up at it.
“Dean, Cas can’t keep this up forever. If it’s all the same to you, I’d rather avoid the two of you guys killing each other ‘cause of some curse, all right?”
The room is still and quiet for almost an hour, punctuated only by the clicking of keys, the turning of pages, and Dean’s occasional grunts as he has to shuffle around slightly on the bed, refusing to listen to Cas telling him he’d hurt his neck trying to read lying down. Cas can feel his irritation and discomfort at his position but, ever infuriatingly stubborn, Dean refuses to admit Cas is right and opts to deal with the stiff neck, instead.
It’s nearing eleven o’clock, and they had just been to the scene of the previous night’s deaths, as Cas had promised the sheriff, to investigate more. The sheriff had still been there – no longer in her pyjamas – and had had more information to give them on what had happened.
Actually, Cas can think of several reasons why Dean might not want to go on a date with him, fake or otherwise, but he decides it’s probably best not to bring them up, so he just nods and gets out of the car. He’s sure Dean must be aware that Cas knows he’s lying about how comfortable he is with the plan – he wasn’t exactly very convincing – but Cas wonders why he felt the need to do so.
An uncomfortable amount of time later, Sam clears his throat. “So, um, get this. We were right about the vastamare using the factory as a second base kinda thing; it was hiding in a storeroom with a sleeping bag and a bunch of food when I found it. It started chasing me around the building, so I led it out to the parking lot to get it in the trap. I was, uh, gonna get you guys’ help with fighting it, but…”
“I do agree that we need to at least be here,” Cas says. “The only other place the vastamare might have attacked before is the lumber factory across town, but we only know for certain that it’s been here.”
“Sure thing.” Sam stands up. “I’ll run to the Gas-n-Sip down the street, grab something we can microwave to eat when we get back from killing this thing. You guys can get changed while I’m out.”
“It’s okay, Cas,” Sam interrupts, completely misjudging what Cas was about to say, “we don’t mind. You guys know what you’re ordering?”
Dean’s lips are soft and warm and there’s still the echo of a laugh trapped in his mouth as he licks into Cas’.
For a Friday night, it isn’t too busy, and most of the patrons are just couples sharing quiet meals. Cas is pleased by this; it makes the room feel much calmer and nowhere near as overwhelming as it might have been if there were lots of people with less consideration for those sat around them.
At that, at the implication that Cas knows what’s going on here, Dean’s brain catches up - as much as it can when he still has no clue what the
“Dumbass.” Dean’s voice is soft and filled with more fondness than Cas thinks he’s ever heard in it before. He places a hand on Cas’ cheek to tilt his head back up again.
Cas spins around and finds himself face-to-face with Dean. He is holding some folded clothes with a pair of boots on top and not quite looking Cas in the eye. At least he isn’t hiding, although it had seemed that way for quite some time.
Dean’s mouth is pressed into a tight, thin line and he looks like he wants to bang his head against the table.
going to die, because there was no way they could escape, not because Cas was going to leave him. Not like this. Not again.
As the time displayed on the laptop ticks closer to three o’clock, Dean starts to stir. He awakens fairly quickly – Cas senses it happen – but takes his time grumbling and adjusting to being conscious again before prying himself from the bed and making for the kitchen.
Officer Sanchez grins at them widely from the entrance to the alley, eyes darker and fiercer than they had been before. He stood as he had done when he was on duty, arms behind his back, chin up with the same air of superiority, stance wide and ready for a fight.
As they draw nearer to their motel, the road becomes dotted with more streetlights, causing Sam to stir, which only intensifies the awkwardness of the car’s silence. They pull into a parking space and all climb out of Baby without saying a word, and Cas misses the usual post-hunt feelings of relief and camaraderie.
Cas narrows his eyes, but doesn’t argue. Dean isn’t wrong about him needing to get better at pretending to be an FBI agent, but he doesn’t know how Dean expects him to do so if he won’t at least let him try. People skills take practice, they can’t be learned from a book. Cas has tried.
The Impala swings into the gravelly parking lot outside of The Tree Trunk, and Sam stops the car to let Dean and Cas get out.
“How’d I almost forget that part?” he whispers, only just loud enough for Cas to hear him. “How such a grumpy son of a bitch has such an easy time making me laugh is completely beyond me, man.”
Cas has heard humans describe silence as deafening before. He never really understood what they meant. He gets it now. As he finds himself gulping down air, able to breathe properly for the first time in almost an hour, his ears start to throb against the silence that somehow completely drowns the massive, empty parking lot.
“Well, maybe I’ve been actin’ weird about it ‘cause, when you and Sam come up with ideas together, they tend to go all Professor Frink and cause more problems than they solve.” Dean snorts, but Cas notices it sounds more forced than his usual laughter.
Cas’ head whips to Dean, trying to convey his panic through a look, but Dean keeps his eyes on Maia.
Sam rams the stake towards the vastamare to protect himself from its claws, and manages to graze it with the blood-soaked point. The vastamare howls as the shadows momentarily dissipate from the point of contact.
Dean looks at him, exasperated, and Cas knows that isn’t what he meant but doesn’t add onto his reply. He has resigned himself to his pettiness.
“Cas?” Dean moves over to him, passing Sam the stick, and rests his hands back on Cas’ shoulders, trying to catch his eyes.
A different waitress brings them their food, eventually. Not-Maia is a lot less smiley and chatty than Maia, for which Cas is secretly relieved. He doesn’t have the energy to pointedly ignore her again.
“Not all gay guys wear crop tops, Dean,” Sam says with an eye roll. “Also, you’re going to a bar. I just mean little things, you know, to make your cover convincing–”
“You’d better be,” Dean grumbles. When Cas looks at him, he glances up to meet his eyes. He still looks about as scared as Cas feels. His voice is quiet and unsteady when he says, “I don’t wanna lose you, Cas.”
“I know, I know, man.” Dean shakes his head, trying to filter the emotion out of his voice so he can get the right words out before he runs out of time. “You just...you gotta know how much you changed me, Cas. Meeting you was - well, it was fucking terrifying at first, I’ll give you that. But then, it wasn’t anymore, ‘cause it turned out you were more than just a robot in a trenchcoat, you know? You were always more than that. It was around when I figured that part out that I stopped being scared
“-I found a website that talks about something called a vastamare. It’s this shadow-like creature that goes after couples who are keeping secrets from each other. Might fit.”
Cas wasn’t expecting that. “I wouldn’t call that ‘easing into it’ but, if that’s what you’d like to talk about.” He stops for a moment, considering how best to say what he wants to. “To be clear, Dean, I never once lied about the way I felt for you, and never went out of my way to hide it, either. I simply didn’t approach you with it directly because I didn’t expect it to end well, and I decided that it was more important to me to get to continue to exist near you and call you my friend than to try and alter our relationship and risk losing you altogether.”
“You know,” the vastamare begins to speak, voice higher and more taunting than it had been before, “when I realised I’d drawn a bunch of hunters into town, I was gonna hightail it outta here and set up shop somewhere on the west coast, instead. Good thing I didn’t; imagine my surprise when I sensed all the little secrets between the two of you, here.” He gestures between Cas and Dean with a malicious smirk. “I thought, ‘gee, a hunter and an angel in a relationship? That sure as hell ain’t something you see every day, I gotta get in on this!’” He spreads his arms. “And here we are.”
As they enter the store and begin to look around, Dean doesn’t talk much. There is an almost overwhelming number of clothes surrounding them, and Cas tries to focus on finding things that fit Sam’s criteria for a suitable outfit. He lets his eyes skip over countless comfortable-looking sweaters, soft jackets, and pairs of socks with bright, fun patterns on and searches instead for formal jackets and smart shoes.
Despite Cas’ resolve, they don’t make it very far. With no warning, Cas’ head starts pounding so hard that it knocks his breath away and sends him doubling over, but Dean catches him before he can fall to the ground and pulls him back to his feet. Cas’ hands scrabble against the rolled-up ends of Dean’s shirtsleeves, and he feels himself rapidly losing the fight against the curse as it splits open his brain.
“You guys can’t just go in there and sit in silence, you know,” he says. “It’s Saturday, so there’s gonna be a bunch of other people in there and we need the two of you to be the ones the vastamare decides to target. You guys need to be the most obvious couple in that bar.”
“Yes,” he calls back, a little too late. He tries to stand more casually, to appear relaxed, but he isn’t really sure how to do that.
“Well, maybe,” Cas says, a little quieter thanks to the trap weakening the curse, “if you didn’t spend so much time worrying about how you could help everyone around you then you might have been able to figure out how to tell me that.”
Less than a minute later, a quiet sound emerges from the bathroom. Cas focuses on it, and starts when he realises it’s Dean softly singing a Billy Joel song,
Her scream cracks and she stops to catch her breath. The anger that had overtaken her suddenly rushes out like a tide. She blinks spots of blood out of her eyes as they grow wide, taking in what she’s done.
Sam laughs at him. He retrieves his laptop and pulls up a website to show Cas. “So, get this. While you guys were out, I did some digging on the origin of the spell used to bind the mixture to the weapon or as a circular trap. Turns out it’s Latin;
“Okay,” Dean breathes, fingers tight on Cas’ face. “Okay.” His eyes dart over Cas’ shoulder. “Okay, Sam’s not at his table anymore, so we know that thing is – I mean, no shit we know that thing is here, it fucking got you. Sam’s gonna be outside waiting for us, okay? So, all you gotta do is keep it in until we get outside and Sammy’ll handle it and you’ll be fine, you hear me?”
Even though there’s no sound playing through them, Cas takes off his – Dean’s – headphones and places them on the table. He thinks keeping them in might make it look as though he isn’t paying attention to Dean’s presence.
“Of course I know, Dean, I’ve explained enough times that I’m really quite tuned into your emotions.”
As Sam thanks her, Dean leans back to whisper to Cas. “Who the hell gets fancy white cabinets then goes Jigsaw on their husband all over them?”
Dean keeps muttering, “Okay…okay…okay,” under his breath as he starts to lead Cas slowly towards the door, weaving carefully between full tables of patrons.
“Shit,” Dean mutters. He’s holding both of Cas’ hands, now, one of which is pressed firmly against the wall, and the other is resting on his own chest as he fights to breathe through the waves of nausea the vastamare’s curse is causing him. Dean’s hands are shaking in Cas’.
Dean sighs. “Yeah, I guess I am. Just…humour me, Cas, please, this isn’t…I don’t know what else to say.”
Dean is still fixing him with a fond gaze as he gets to the end of his frog-fact-outburst. With a tiny smile, he reaches a hand across to squeeze Cas’ knee. “Thank you,” he says, voice low and warm and rumbly. It seems Cas’ attempt to calm Dean’s panic had not been lost on him.
Dean always worried he was poisonous. He’d seen evidence of it everywhere throughout his life: the death of his mother, his father, Bobby, Ellen and Jo, Charlie, Kevin, all the times he’s lost Sam, or Cas, or Jack. All these people who knew him, who he cared about, got hurt or killed because of it. He knows, if he told Sam, he’d tell him that was stupid, none of that was his fault, and Dean clings to that, two-handed, desperate to believe it, to be absolved of the guilt.
Once again, Sam saves them from too much more awkwardness by staggering over to talk to them. “You guys okay? I need some help dealing with all this, uh, vastamare dust.”
Cas opens his eyes to see the vastamare turn just in time to watch Sam toss the stick to Dean, who has snuck up behind the creature. Dean hoists the sharpened stick above his shoulder and charges at the vastamare. It twists out of the way deftly. Dean tries to draw back in order to avoid impaling Cas on the stick and stumbles into the wall just next to him.
“You called him ‘Officer Stink-eye’,” Cas says, holding Dean’s arm to keep him in place. “I’m not sure that counts as ‘bad news’.”
The next bang is followed by a crash, and the warded door to the storage room bursts open. Over Cas’ shoulder, Dean sees Billie stride across the threshold, scythe in hand, murder on her face. Cas doesn’t look away from Dean.
Sam runs towards the vastamare, stake raised to attack. He meets the vastamare and takes a swing at it, but it ducks out of the way and forces Sam backwards.
Dean immediately looks at Cas with a smirk at what the two of them have decided has become Sam’s unintentional catchphrase. Cas tries to hold in a laugh at Dean’s expression. Luckily, Sam doesn’t notice.
Cas is faintly aware of the rotting flesh smell getting stronger as they walk through the kitchen door, but it’s gone by the time they get outside.
Very quickly, Cas finds that going any closer to the building is really not something he can do. He clasps his head with his free hand as he tries to tug Dean back to stop beside him.
“Dude,” Dean says, glaring at Sam who is sat with one eyebrow raised judgementally at Dean’s choice of meal. “Don’t look at my pancakes like that. It’s a breakfast of kings. You can’t get all high-and-mighty when you’re eatin’ damn rabbit food.”
Dean lets go of Cas’ hand to grip him by both shoulders and try to shake him out of it, but Cas remains frozen in place as he tries to make sense of what’s going on. Thoughts seem to wrestle with each other to get closer to his mouth, closer to being spoken aloud for the first time.
If Dean hadn’t been grinning like an idiot, Cas might have paid more attention to Sam’s awful attempt at pretending to be interested.
. Cas suddenly gets it. The intense look from the waitress, her calling him ‘handsome’, Dean’s implication that he’d want to know if she was free later that evening, his assertion that she was ‘into him. Cas sincerely hopes she isn’t expecting him to reciprocate; she seemed very nice and he’d hate to hurt her pride by having to explain to her that – for several not entirely unrelated reasons – he wasn’t interested.
When the bathroom door swings open, it takes Dean a second to see Cas, expecting him somewhere over in the kitchen area rather than by the mirror next to the beds. This means Cas gets a couple of seconds to notice Dean’s outfit – dark jeans, a black t-shirt, boots, and a green button-up Cas hasn’t seen him wear before with its sleeves rolled to his elbows – which he rationalises is a very typical outfit for Dean to wear, so he isn’t sure what about it is causing him any difficulty with breathing. Or thinking.
, frogs!” Cas rolls his eyes, trying to keep the exasperation out of his voice, reminding himself that Dean is tired and it isn’t his fault he’s struggling to grasp the very simple concept of a frog. “I’ve learned quite a lot about them, actually. For example, I found out that a group of frogs is called an ‘army’, which conjures a mental image which I find to be very endearing.”
They find a motel in the centre of the town with spare rooms and decide to stay there while they try to figure out what’s happening to the couples in Keeley Forest. Sam is sat at the kitchen table on his laptop, while Dean is slumped sideways on his bed, a book they brought from the bunker held above his face. Cas is leaning against the bed’s headboard with Dean’s legs propped up on his lap, using Dean’s laptop to search further back through Keeley Forest news reports.
As he speaks, Cas sees the factory door burst open and the vastamare glide through it, capturing Sam’s attention as he turns back to face it. It doesn’t register in Cas’ mind that, just maybe, he should be doing something about that.
Cas leans into the coldness of the log wall, grateful for the way the temperature grounds him. As he stands there, he realises his feet are within the circle of duck’s blood mixture Sam had set up to trap the vastamare and weaken its curse. Before he can let his mind wander off too far, he refocuses on ensuring his mouth remains tightly closed.
“Of course.” Cas frowns. He’s close enough for Dean to hear his breath catch as Billie knocks on the door again.
Back in the motel room, Sam begins the mixing process, complaining bitterly about having to use duck’s blood even after Cas explains that it’s actually quite a common spell ingredient since ducks are a traditional symbol of marital happiness, so it makes perfect sense as an ingredient in the weapon that can kill a vastamare.
“As much as I enjoy talking to you, especially about frogs, you still need to go back to sleep. I told you, you’re annoying when you’re tired and I’d rather not have to deal with that during the day.”
“Oh, did you, you poor, self-centred son of a bitch?” Dean snarls. “Your conclusions were bullshit! You should have just
Cas lifts his free hand to hold Dean’s arm and uses that along with the one that’s still resting gently on his cheek to guide him to one side. Dean goes with no resistance, moulded and shifted by Cas’ hands as easily as Play-Doh.
“Just…” Dean places his head in his hands in a manner that would have looked frustrated if he hadn’t been shaking. “Just stop…I mean…how are you being so nice to me?”
“I wanted to tell you then...I was gonna tell you…’cause I didn’t want that to happen again, didn’t wanna lose you before I could tell you. I was gonna. But then I didn’t, and I haven’t, and now we’re here and I’m about to lose you anyway and I never even...I swear I wanted to, and if I could go back now and change it and give us, fuck,
“Heard some witnesses saying they’d been arguing, then the guy kills his wife and kills himself, just like those people from yesterday. I mean I…I just can’t believe this keeps happening. Must be something in the water, you know?”
“You slept with my boss!” Cara shrieks, eyes flashing crazily. “I mean, I can’t believe she let you, with those ridiculous baseball-patterned underwear you always have on.”
“Come on, hey,” Dean says in a soft voice that makes Cas’ chest tighten. “Don’t do that to yourself, you were just doing your job. This ain’t your fault.”
“No, actually, because you interrupted me before I could ask him anything. I couldn’t find any sulfur or hex bags in the kitchen, but there was a strange smell by the window and door.”
Dean’s hand tightens in Cas’, and he looks around as though trying, impossibly, to commit every patron’s face to memory. His eyes are wide and his shoulders tense, alert, like there is an imminent threat. Cas isn’t sure if he’s worried about the vastamare or just all the people. Looking around at them, Cas can’t think why he would be, since not a single person even seems to have noticed their arrival.
And that’s it. The story as anyone besides Dean knows it is that he and Cas hid in that storeroom to get away from Billie, and the Empty somehow interpreted that as a sign that Cas’ happiness had peaked and swooped in to steal him away, taking Billie as a bonus prize for its efforts as it went. Nothing untoward happened, and Dean definitely didn't spend hours in that room, shaking and sobbing and praying until not even he knew what he was saying anymore. In many ways, he’s relieved to be the only one who knows the truth; he doubts Sam or Jack could stand to be near him if they knew he was the reason Cas was gone.
Before any of the screaming witnesses even know what’s happening, Jerry drives the sign through his chest, cracking a rib and piercing his heart, and collapses onto the sidewalk next to Rita, unconscious and fading far too fast for anything to be done about it.
It helps calm Cas’ nerves a lot to see that Dean appears to be far more nervous about the date than he is. Cas watches him bounce his leg up and down in the passenger seat from his position in the back of the Impala, and he keeps patting his hands on his legs as though he is in desperate need of something to do with them.
trust the expression that currently paints his best friend’s face with all the warmth and radiance of the damn sun. They’re both about to die - whether that’s to Billie or to whatever this weird black goop is - so Dean isn’t sure what exactly Cas has got to be smiling about.
He is sat in the back with Dean next to him; he had tried to say he was fine on his own, but Dean had insisted on keeping him company back there. Dean is holding tightly onto his hand on the seat between them, though Cas isn’t sure exactly whose benefit it’s for most. His other hand is sat on top, tapping along anxiously to Billy Joel on Cas’ skin, ever unable to keep his hands still for too long at a time. Aside from the music, the car is silent, and Cas doesn’t like it.
The vastamare backs away as Dean regains his balance. With a better view of it now, Cas notices that it looks like it’s made of black smoke that curls in on itself, constantly moving as though with the breeze. It is taller and lankier than the form it took as Sanchez had been, though it adopted the same alert stance as before, hands gripped behind his back. It gives another icy laugh.
“My, uh, my...no...you know when…” Dean struggles to find a place to start. He’s imagined this conversation hundreds of times in his head, all playing out in different ways, all with different openers, different anecdotes, different endings, and his brain is trying to force them all out through his mouth at once, jumbling them together. He inhales. “Ok, wait, wait, shit, gimme a minute.”
Cas smiles back genuinely, hoping it’s reassuring. Dean’s hand is clammy; there’s a distant part of Cas’ mind that would find that amusing if he wasn’t so aware of the dampness of his vessel’s palms, too.
, you’d know I lied about going to those Zumba classes last summer because I was fucking Jason Harris!”
“Don’t talk to me about ‘my own worth’ like you don’t take every goddamn opportunity you can get to try and remind me of it!”
Cas’ face looks broken, looks elated and crushed all at once. Weird as it may sound, Dean knows the feeling, and what's even weirder is that it makes Cas look so damn beautiful.
Dean inhales sharply. “Yeah…yeah, okay, Cas, let’s talk about it,” he says, turning slightly to look at Cas.
In hindsight, that example may have been unwise. Dean’s head snaps up to him, suddenly defensive, though he seems to realise there isn’t much need for him to be.
The door to the room clicks open, and Dean jumps away from Cas almost comically. It’s just Sam, of course, back from the store with a bag of food, but Cas sees redness starting to spread up Dean’s neck.
“Good evening!” A chipper waitress suddenly appears at their table, and Dean’s head snaps to her quickly. “Can I get you guys any drinks?”
and make it seem like the most interesting thing in the world, just ‘cause you care about it so much!”
The result of this sudden breaking of the curse sends Dean stumbling out of his attempt at murdering Cas and falling towards him, instead. Of course, Cas catches him, but Dean jumps out of his arms the second he’s caught his breath.
They’ve all stopped talking and Cas can hear Billy Joel, finally. He bobs his head along, staring out at the world passing by his window. He almost gets a full minute of this quiet enjoyment.
Cas puts his hand on top of Dean’s to pause his rambling. “Well,” he says, “we’ve technically already had our first date. I think that’s generally quite a significant part of a relationship. I’d say we’re doing well so far.”
That seems to put Dean’s head back on straight, as he frowns at Sam. “Dude, come on, no one needs to look at me and Cas and think we’re into men, they just have to think we’re…you know…together.”
A morose silence falls over them. Cas dislikes thinking about his mistakes, particularly his ones from before he met Sam and Dean, when he was a very different person, so to speak, and part of him wishes he hadn’t told them, in case it changes their opinion of him.
"But, my grace," Cas starts, sounding slightly panicked, "I couldn't... if it wasn't real than why couldn't I control my... Why did I have these urges to..."

“Uh, here.” He hands the blade back to Cas, who mumbles a “thank you” and puts it back on whatever plane of existence he normally keeps it.
When he finally kisses Jensen’s lips, they’re already parted and waiting for him: soft and pliable and so,
The man reaches down with his free hand, brushes past his balls, and Castiel’s breath catches in his throat as he watches the man spread his legs, lift his
Instead of answering, Dean removes his hands from Castiel’s hips, takes two large steps back, and crosses his arms over his chest to punctuate his point.
“Whoa. Nice TV.” Dean points to the flat screen on the wall and then down at the gaming systems. “Oh shit, is that a NES?”

“That’s it, other than a section that explains how to kill it, but that’s only useful if we know this is the thing we’re dealing with. This site isn’t very informative, but it’s the first place I’ve seen mention this thing.”
“Well, that’s something, at least,” Dean says as they reach the car. “You get anything from Officer Stink-eye, Cas?”
. It immediately becomes clear to Cas what must have happened. He clamps his jaw shut. This isn’t good.
Dean is still speaking loudly. “You say that like you haven’t dedicated your entire fuckin’ life to trying to protect me, or something.”
“Cas, hey,” Dean says, “you don’t have to go too near that thing again, okay? But we gotta go and help Sam.”
Cas lets himself sigh this time. He had spent the first five hours of the drive trying to convince Dean to let him play his Billy Joel mixtape (he spent hours making it, he likes it a lot) until Dean conceded when they were about an hour away from Keeley Forest. Is it too much for him to ask to be able to sit and enjoy it without interruption?
“No, I don’t…” Jack cuts himself off with a sigh. “When I died, and Cas went to Heaven to rescue me, the Shadow followed me there because it thought I belonged in the Empty instead of in Heaven. To stop it from taking me, Cas...he made a deal.”
“I saw a nice-looking place on the way into town,” Dean continues, oblivious to Sam’s complaints. “We could swing by there instead of getting convenience store sandwiches again.”
The sheriff sighs, her curled hair bouncing as her shoulders sag. “They were good people. Take as long as you need, Agents.”
The woman blinks at him. “But I thought these were all isolated cases, right? No offence, but I don’t exactly see how the feds are gonna be able to stop people killing each other like this.”
Dean hums in agreement, closing his book. “I think Dad hunted one of those, once; I recognise the name, maybe from his journal. Don’t think we’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting one.”
Cas nods. “Thank you.” He turns back to Dean and whispers, “It’s approximately a six-minute walk from here to their house.”
Officer Sanchez raises an eyebrow and steps to one side so they can leave the kitchen and head back out to the front of the house. He watches them leave, probably rather confused by Cas’ sudden and premature departure from their conversation.
He takes several alarmingly fast steps towards Sanchez, who hardly flinches, before Cas catches up to him and grab his arms. He tugs Dean towards the door, grateful for his angelic strength as Dean is trying very hard to wriggle out of his grip.
Dean looks at him in sheer disbelief. He starts helping Cas to his feet. “Yeah, you ass, I read it in high school.”
Dean swallows, and Cas has to try very hard not to laugh as he senses Dean’s panic at trying to come up with a coherent response. When the panic doesn’t falter quickly enough, Cas decides to take pity on him by pulling the changing room curtain closed again and starting to change back into his suit and trench coat.
Cas has absolutely no idea what water has to do with this situation, and suddenly wishes he could tell Officer Sanchez that they actually think it’s a vastamare causing all of these deaths in order to prove him wrong. Sadly, he has to resign himself to simply giving the officer another strained nod.
Miraculously, Sam is able to maintain his balance as the vastamare rounds on him again. It clenches its smoky fist and swings a punch, this time, which catches Sam off-guard.
“I have to, Cas, ‘cause I didn’t do it back in Purgatory, I didn’t do it when I first figured it out, and I didn’t do it any time between then and now, so we’re stuck with now, ‘cause there’s no way in hell I’m letting you leave me without knowing, not again.” Dean takes a deep breath, no idea what words are gonna come out on the exhale. “I’ve had a pretty crappy life, right? But the part where I got to know you? That was the best part, hands down. The way I...the way I feel about you, that’s not something I’ve ever felt about anybody. And,” he breathes a humourless laugh, “this whole time, I was too chickenshit to do a single thing about it.” Dean drops his eyes to the ground, blinking away tears. When he raises his head, he brings up his free arm to curl his hand around Cas’ wrist. “I’m so sorry, Cas.”
Cas smiles as the car finally pulls away, watching the back of Dean’s head as he not-so-subtly nods it along to the beat.
The bartender stops wiping the bar, straightening up with a frown. Her dark hair swishes in a ponytail, and she’s wearing a red flannel open over a black shirt, sleeves rolled up to her elbows. She crosses her arms and chews at her lip. “Yeah, uh, I was working last night. Had to ask those guys to head home after they started yelling at each other.” She rubs at her eyes. “You think, if I hadn’t done that, they’d still be…you know…?”
“The Empty?” Sam frowns. “Why? Was the Shadow going after Billie, and Cas just…” he clears his throat, “...just got caught in the crossfire?”
When he turns back to Dean, he is glaring at the floor. Cas places a hand on Dean’s shoulder to draw his mind back to the present, even though he’s sure Dean can feel how much it’s shaking. Dean takes several seconds to look back up again, but seems to relax a little when he sees Cas’ gentle smile. He leans into Cas’s side, and Cas moves his arm so it’s curled all the way around Dean, hand stroking up and down Dean’s flank as he rests his head on Cas’ shoulder.
When they pull up outside a nearby clothing store, Cas is happy for five reasons: 1. Cas got to ride shotgun, 2. Dean did not say a word about Billy Joel playing in the car, 3. Cas definitely saw Dean nodding along to Billy Joel on several occasions, 4. Cas is excited about getting new clothes, 5. Cas is excited about going shopping with Dean.
It feels like someone’s rearranging his brain, not exactly painful, but so incredibly unnerving and unwelcome and uncomfortable. He feels his thoughts and ideas move around as though of their own accord, sliding around each other with slow, careful precision, slotting into different places than they had been before, drawing some of his more deeply buried thoughts gradually nearer to the surface of his mind.
With very visible difficulty, Dean searches for something to say. Somehow, he lands on, “Cas…how are you?”
only want you around when you can do something for me. And then you left ‘cause I was mad at you and you thought we didn’t need you anymore and I never told you how much I wanted you to stay, so you didn’t.” Cas hanging his head is all the confirmation Dean needs. He leans down to catch Cas’ eye, to draw his attention back to Dean. “I always needed you around, man, always. And not ‘cause Sam and I are better at our jobs when you’re there, and not ‘cause you help us with shit, but because you make us better
Before he can do so, Sam plunges the stake through the vastamare’s chest, trapping it against the ground as it wails and wails, arms beating the gravel as it starts to fade into a body-shaped heap of dust.
“I got information,” Cas says with a frown, “and we got even more this morning. Besides, all the witnesses were the couple’s direct neighbours, so we know where they live.”
The place Dean had spotted for dinner is cosy and well-lit, the sort of place that tries to look a lot fancier than it is. The walls are white wooden panels at the bottom and painted a soft, bright turquoise at the top, and a plastic chandelier that looks like it had been painted gold hangs from the ceiling, spreading a pleasant, warm light around the room.
Despite all of this, Cas is aware – and has been for most of the afternoon – that something is bothering Dean, so, when they park, he decides to investigate the issue.
“Dean.” Sam sighs. “Did you actually listen to anything I said? You gotta look” – he gestures noncommittally at Dean’s outfit – “
Returning the nod, Dean slides his hands away from Cas’ face and grabs his hand, lifting it off of the bar, and gently guides him to stand up. Cas releases his grip on Dean’s leg, but finds himself having to move that hand up to hold onto Dean’s arm.
, and I remembered in the bar why I was familiar with it. Several hundred years ago, when I was a commander, there were rumours going around the garrison that two of my soldiers had become…uh…romantically involved with each other, in secret, which was unconventional but not entirely unheard of, and definitely an act of disobedience. I was going to report them, of course, but they were two of my best soldiers and my team needed their expertise and skill. It took a lot of deliberation, but I eventually came to the decision that what they were bringing to my team was more essential than finding out the level of truth in the rumours in order to report them, so I ordered the rest of my team to keep quiet about it. Well,” he says with a wince, “I say ordered, but it was more of a threat.
That afternoon, they split up to ensure they had everything they needed to take down the vastamare. Dean wandered around Keeley Forest until he found a duck to kill and drained its blood, Cas collected a sprig each of basil and lavender, and Sam found a sharp stick on the ground.
“No, no, don’t worry, Cas, I need some fresh air. Besides,” he says with raised eyebrows, “y’all need to have a conversation, and there is literally no force in Hell that could persuade me to stick around and watch.”
Cas turns to look out the front of the car and tries to ignore the nervous glances Dean shoots at him every thirty seconds. It had been too quiet in the car before he spoke, and it’s too quiet again now. He feels like he can
When Dean had decided on the aliases they’d be using, picking Armstrong for himself, of course, Sam had quickly called dibs on being Agent Dirnt. Cas didn’t mind; Agent Cool had a nice ring to it. Dean had assured him it sounded cool, although Cas wasn’t sure how much of that was genuine reassurance and how much was for the sake of the joke.
“All right,” Dean groans as he climbs off his bed, “you guys are being dorks too loudly, and we gotta get ready to go if we wanna be ganking this thing while it’s still light enough out to see it.”

That earns him a glare as Dean sticks his arm out in permission. Cas is as gentle as possible, starting to swipe away the blood around the wound without touching it directly to avoid hurting Dean. He has to move Dean’s sleeve up slightly to make sure the whole area gets clean, so he pinches the hem very gingerly, careful to touch as little skin as possible, and lifts the sleeve out of the way. Then, he sees the handprint.

“So, it definitely gets its rocks off watching, then,” Dean murmurs over the top of his mug of coffee.
“Yes, but then if we can’t find it, there’s nothing we can do to help if another couple gets cursed.”
“That fits with what the sheriff was saying about that old bar, too,” Dean says. “Bartender kicked ‘em out ‘cause they were arguing too loud, made ‘em walk home.”
Cas shakes his head, taking a deep breath. “I think my…being in there…too…meant that it…didn’t…work.” He doesn’t miss Dean’s hands tightening around his as he speaks and relaxing slightly again when he stops.
The waitress turns to Cas, wide smile softening into a more deliberate, heated expression. “Anything for you, handsome?”
Dean’s face creases into a small frown, one Cas knows well enough to understand that there’s something he’s missed. Perhaps Dean is worried they won’t make a convincing enough couple, or that these small-town people might not like seeing two men on a fake date, or maybe Dean is experiencing the same waves of self-consciousness Cas had been feeling earlier. Whatever it is, it’s clear that Dean is flagging slightly and needs some help.
He’s heard it said that being loved is the best feeling in the world. He isn’t sure that tracks. After all, being loved by Dean Winchester seems to be a death sentence.

Telling Dean not to do something is a surefire way to get Dean to do the thing, and Cas knows this and tightens his grasp.

“Thank you, Anna.” Castiel resigns, and Dean laughs, the sound of which Castiel can feel vibrate deep down in his marrow.
When he gets there, Cas has already loaded the cooler into the trunk and is waiting patiently in the front seat. If this all goes according to plan, one of

The initial shock has passed but Castiel still feels like he’s been betrayed by both Dean and his own body.
“What, are you a doctor now?” he mumbles, voice rough enough that the sarcasm hardly comes across. “How’d you know all that?”

And with Cas’ grunted consent Dean pulls back harder on the tie, causing Cas’ to clench up a little tighter, and he starts pistoning in and out of that
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Castiel feigns indifference, although inside he is basically vibrating as he feels Dean’s heart rate speed up.
“Smoke ‘em if you’ve got ‘em,” she’d said after receiving her call. And Castiel didn’t quite understand what she meant by it until she quit her job,
Dean takes him by surprise and pulls his right leg out from under him, flipping him over and onto the bed. Castiel tries to take a moment to appreciate the

Still, it’s at least 90 degrees inside that tin can even with all the windows open and fans on high.
“Dean, this is incredible.” Castiel looks out at each wing, moving them around and taking stock of them. He looks down at the pile of feathers Dean made.
Dean balances himself on one hand and reaches down, lacing his fingers over Cas’ and pressing them together even harder. Cas gasps and looks up at Dean.
He had his arms crossed over his chest and was slumped deep down the seat, head lolling onto his shoulder. His lips were parted slightly, allowing for the
