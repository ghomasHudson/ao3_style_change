Castiel raised his head at the sound of his own name to see Gabriel reaching his hand out. Cas blinked a few times before handing a balloon to his brother, who automatically attached it to the end of a tall bookshelf.
“Yep,” Dean answered, eying his son's precious face, “But you've gotta get dressed if you want to go, okay?”
. But in all the right ways. The angel smirked and glanced back at his sleeping human through the mirror. No other being in the universe could ruffle Castiel's feathers like Dean Winchester...
“Be careful, son,” Pop cautioned, studying Jude’s eyes, “How are you feeling? Are you in any pain? Can you state your full name?”
“What the hell?” Bobby breathed, sounding equally appalled and impressed.
have Ollie around for everything that happened in her life...
And judging by the tremors that rocked Bobby's Singer's house every few seconds, it wouldn't take Darkness long at all to complete the job.
“If you had just called, we could have told you all of this over the phone and you wouldn't have wasted all that time and gas to get here,” Dean muttered.
Jessica bit her bottom lip to keep from bursting into a fit of nervous giggles.
“Oh, Dean,” he breathed, unable to stop himself from rocking back against the man's tongue, “That feels
“You wouldn't need to leave though, Cas,” Dean said, placing his hand on the angel's shoulder, “At least, not until after the baby's born. And we'll make sure we've got everything we need beforehand so that we can hide out for as long as possible.”
An odd sense of deja vu came over Clare as he shook his head. Hadn't they walked down this same corridor before, in suits while Jude was drunk? Didn't that happen just a few days earlier?
“No,” Dean said, carefully getting to his feet. “We thought he was dead, too. But he was actually captured by Asmodeus. The dude kept him locked up in Hell and was siphoning his grace for years. He didn’t break out until recently. At least, that’s how it is in the world I came from.”
,” Clare sang softly, “
“No shit, Gabe!” Sam huffed, “She probably flew off to get to -”
“Yes,” Clarence answered, actually standing up from his seat to nod, “I'll listen. I swear.”
“Me too, kid,” he agreed, his golden eyes glancing downward, “Now toss some clothes on that gorgeous body of yours so we can go tuck our glitter-maker into bed.”
“Anyone ever told you how gorgeous you are when you’re pissed?” he hummed.
Jude quickly chewed his food and gulped it down before answering.
“Um... I guess?” Jess muttered.
Jude cringed at his boyfriend's side. That wasn't a very nice way to ask a stranger for help. Luckily, Michael seemed indifferent to Clarence's big fat mouth. He only took a deep, gusting sigh.
” Jess cried, “
“I know, boy,” Sam whispered, “I miss him too...”
“Look, man, I'll be the first to admit that demons are dicks,” Dean began, “but if you love Crowley –
, he thought to himself,
,” Jess mumbled erotically under her breath.
“What's the matter?” the little girl blurted.
Jude gulped. Uh-oh. She thought Jude was his Dad. Did he really look that much like him?
Yeah. This chapter dealt with a lot of serious topics, but hopefully it's all within the realm of possibility when it comes to Supernatural. I think a lot of us would benefit from behaving as innocently as children who always tell the truth. Sometimes it's better to speak up and say, “Hey, this is how I'm feeling, please help,” rather than bottling it up inside. (That is what I hope happens with Dean on the show before it's too late, to be honest.) And yes, ever since *that* fanfic came out, Elvis Presley's “Can't Help Falling in Love” has been the unofficial Destiel anthem in my heart as well. (You guys know exactly what I'm talking about. Lol) ;D Whether you are happy or not about Meg's return into this story, I think we can all agree that no one should ever question their existence on this Earth – And if
“No, no,” Jude immediately interrupted, “This is great, Pa. Honestly. It's too much.”
“Sam, don’t be stupid,” Dad barked, “Lucifer’s got the scythe! He could kill you with one swipe.”
“When Jude's not available?” he repeated, sounding humorously confused.
The first stop Cas made was Jude’s bedroom. Jessica and Oliver had already reclaimed Jess’s room, and were inside taking inventory of Charlie’s stuff and looking through the closet. Across the hall, Jude’s old bedroom looked exactly the same as he had it. The twin-sized bed was made with Superman sheets, the Batman nightlight was glowing softly from the corner, and sitting patiently in the middle of the bed were Jude’s stuffed bumble bee and his two otters. The sight of the familiar toy gave Dean a small chill. It was nice to see the physical representation of Jude’s childhood intact.
“Hmm,” Dean hummed gleefully, freeing his lips long enough to speak, “I think that blanket over there is calling our names, Cas.”
Sam and Gabe stood by while Bobby and Dean grouped around Castiel, all preparing to fly back to Bobby's house.
“Jess, I’m sorry,” Ollie continued at the door, “I really am… Gabe has already given me a lecture and a half, but if you need to yell at me too, I’m ready to hear it.”
"Uh," Clarence eventually mumbled with his mouth full of food, "You want something, pal?"
"Now who needs the hearing aid?" Papa scoffed, â€œYep. You're looking at an archangel, Clare-bear. And this baby-bunny is my little girl."
“Aren't you gonna give me a kiss, sweetheart?” the trickster purred, easing up towards Sam's face.
The angel softly laid his hand on the hood and fastened his eyes to the sleek metal, as if he was feeling it with celestial energy. Cas was touching the Impala the same way he always touched Dean, gently and affectionately, being careful not to hurt it. Dean secretly enjoyed watching the angel handle his car that way, like he was touching his lover's body. Was it right to find the interaction so damn sexy? Cas eventually lifted his hand and turned back to Dean and he seemed slightly surprised.
“Is that a ring?” Dean blurted.
With a small breath, Bobby turned back around to the study door. After a few 'clink's of a lock being removed, the old man finally slid the heavy door open. Dean drank in the sight of the study being revealed at once, secretly scanning for any noticeable differences inside. He just knew there had to be a dead body in there, or at least something disturbing or gross. But, the first thing that struck Dean wasn't something that he could see. It was something he smelled. The harsh scent of Pine-Sol and bleach – the very same smell that Bobby was drenched in – was strong in the room. The closer Dean moved inside, the worse it became.
“I won't,” he promised.
A pleasant sort of expression lifted across Clare's face, as if he was happy to hear that Jude wasn't going anywhere. Clarence nodded and shrugged before stepping out of the study to shuffle toward the hallway.
, man! You just have to -”
Jude closed his eyes tight, still trying to keep the tears inside. He didn't want anyone to see him crying and figure out how much he liked Clarence – how much he
“Allow me, Dean,” Cas whispered, reaching for the door.
Jude opened his mouth to defend his own truthful statements, but turning his attention back to Clarence made the words disappear. The demon was roughly scratching his own arms, digging lines into his skin with his nails. There was a fidgety shakiness about him; twitchy hands, elevated breathing, lip chewing. It seemed like Clarence was having a hard time focusing too, but not for the same reason Jude was. Wanting to help them both relax, Jude tried bringing up a new topic to talk about.
son... Little Metatron Junior.”
“I, uh, must've gotten turned around or somethin', 'cause I don't see the power plant anywhere,” Bobby replied, looking out through the windshield.
“Me, Sam, Dean, and Cas. Your son's favorite guys,” Gabe answered instead, “You're lucky we brought Oliver home when we did. We scared off those burglars.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Words?”
Gabe gulped, staring up at Sam with his eyebrows furrowed.
. He spent his whole damn life chasing you down, and guess what? You shattered his heart. And then
“Hey! Monkey-boys!” Gabriel shouted, halting Jude and Oliver on the beds, “What does this look like? A bouncy castle? Get your wiggly butts down before I fly you home.”
The Lord nodded in his earthly vessel and plucked a muffin out to place it in front of Jessica.
“And what about Clare? Will it work for him?” Dean asked.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean whispered, “I’m glad I accidently knocked you up.”
Dickie barked a few more times, as if he was answering Ollie's question, but Jessie let her grace go out and quickly scooped the dog up into a hug; holding him as close to her heart as she could. She had never been so happy to see a dog in all her life!
With the snap of her fingers, Jess used some grace to clean up the spilled dog food. It all swirled up from the floor and twisted its way back into the bag, much to Dickie's disappointment. Ollie watched it happen, but he still wasn't smiling. It wasn't until Jessie studied his face that she noticed the dark circles under his eyes and the paleness of his already-pale skin. Ollie looked like an exhausted ghost under his many freckles. Was he not getting any sleep?
“Who is that? What happened to Mommy and Daddy?” Ollie gasped.
Dean came in a rush, semen shooting out of the tip of his cock like gunfire while Cas pounded into him. The continuous stimulation, both inside him and out, made his orgasm last a few nice long seconds. All Dean could really do while it happened was seize up and repeat Cas's name like a mantra over and over in hushed whimpers.
switch places. The king stayed in his world and Dean’s boyfriend came back home with Dean. Also, you probably noticed that there was no smut? Yeah, that’s because I took your advice and left out the whole smut chapter. (but I have arranged some naughty time for Dean and his own Cas in the next chapter, so there’s that to look forward to!) XD When it comes to WIPs, I find that you guys are usually right. I take all of your feedback and suggestions to heart when creating a story, because at the end of the day, these fics are for all of us, not just me. Plus, I love you so much and your opinion matters to me! You’re an important part of my writing process, and I wouldn’t get much done without you! Thank you so much! *hugs* Like I said, there is one more chapter to go, and it is arguably the best of all of them! (The ending will leave you with tears of joy, I promise!) ;D I really hope you liked this chapter despite the sad parts! Thank you so much for reading and commenting! The next chapter will be out soon! :)
“Yes. I'm afraid that's true,” he admitted, “I did lie... but only to fool those hunters. I've dealt with their kind before. I know how to keep them running in circles -”
In the back of his mind, Sam was tempted to wonder if Gabe would really be fine with this deep of a wound. A small part of him worried that if they stayed in Purgatory for longer than a few days, they might end up with something worse than just minor injuries. If one of them died here, would they die forever? No. Sam didn't want to even think about it. He focused on tying the makeshift tourniquet above Gabe's knee to slow the bleeding instead of dwelling on bad thoughts.
Dean reached back and wrapped his free arm around the angel's back, tugging him into a slight embrace. There was a look of comfort and relief in his emerald eyes, as if he was happy to see Castiel staring back at him.
Jude swallowed a gulp and looked around. How in the world was he supposed to sum up everything that was going on? From the anxiety with the black bag, to everything that just happened with that half-demon guy in his room, Jude wasn't sure what was going on with him. His emotions were a mess... but so far, they all kept fading back into one feeling. What was that feeling? Why was it so powerful? It was like being hurt and healed at the same time.
Eddie, of course, shook his head. From the sweat on his face and the oil stains on his hands and shirt, Dean could tell that the guy had been out here for a while, probably trying to salvage what he could of the rims and bent axle. Plus, this particular stretch of Kansas road was notorious for not having cell phone service...
for taking the time to read this thing! I hope that this was a fitting end, and that the entire story was able to bring you happiness! :D I love all of you! :)
?! But how?! She was so young! Bobby took a timid step closer, wearing a mixture of relief and shock.
“Son, this is not a matter for debate. The longer we postpone, the more your children’s lives are in danger,” Papa stated firmly.
“Don't worry, Jude,” she said, “It's okay. The polar bears aren't hurt or anything.”
“Oliver,” Jessica realized out loud, “Pop, you have to go tell Ollie!”
“Hell yeah they do,” Gabe agreed, turning to look up at Sam, “Our daughter blasted a warlock to pieces, Sammy.
Though he was still curious about the potion bottle and whatever Clare just wrote, Jude forced a nod.
“Yeah,” Clyde sighed, churning the large stick mechanically into the small hole, “Wasn't nothin' I could do. The devil tricked him, I know it. That's all the devil's good for. Trickin' people.”
him. It almost resembled their very first kiss; soft and tender, but full of power. The potent blast of absolute love that surged through Jude's soul was enough to yank Darkness out of the way so that he could properly take over. Jude could finally
“The twins seem to be shaken, but unaffected. Their heartrates and brain activity are normal. Jude’s body suffered minimal damage from the scythe, but I will keep a close eye on him for any changes,” Cas explained, shaking his head toward Jude’s closed eyes as he gently stroked Jude’s hair, “Why… Why must you be so self-sacrificial, son?”
Sam couldn't stop the tiny tear that escaped the corner of his eye. He breathed in the flowery smell of Jessica's blonde curls and tried very hard to hold himself together.
The husbands laughed together for a second before wrapping each other into a hug. Clare was overjoyed that they would finally be able to start their own little family – to have a
Cas gives him a look that’s part guilty, part pitying, part warning, but he doesn’t say anything.
“Yes,” says Cas. “Who you thought was dead.”
Sam blinks fast for a few seconds, then sets his jaw. “Yes.”
With a beer in him and another on the way, he’s willing to admit that he likes the way Cas looks in his clothes: the unbuttoned flannel over the black t-shirt, the jeans that are a little tight, even the ugly sneakers he got from the campers and wears because Dean doesn’t have any other shoes. It’s charming. Very different from the Novak suit. He likes the stubble and the longer hair. Sure, it’s not necessarily the Cas he knew before—but it’s almost like he can pretend it’s somebody new, somebody who doesn’t have all the baggage they have, but with all the good parts of hanging out with Cas. Cas knows Dean better than almost anyone else on the planet and yet maybe they can still get to know each other.
and then everyone will know the deal and it’ll be normal. Cas probably already talks about Dean all the time.
The coroner sidles up to Dean.
CUT TO:
“Mr. Nowotny,” he says. “Dean.”
Cas does the same, shoots it back, nearly chokes.
Oh, so now
It sounds like Cas, but it isn’t Cas. It can’t be Cas. As Dean’s eyes adjust to the darkness outside, it looks a lot like Cas too. Looks like his hair, a little overgrown, and his big, round eyes, and his thin, concerned smile.
“Control?” Dean says, making his way into the bathroom, looking at himself in the mirror. He looks like a wreck, but at least he doesn’t have to see his reflection under the hospital’s unforgiving LED lights anymore. “If it was about control, then wouldn’t I be the one, you know, playing Christian Grey?” Cas stares at him. Dean holds out a hand. “Instead of Anastasia?” Nothing. “I’m just saying.”
The phrase “sex life with Cas” sends Dean for a loop despite the fact that he does, in fact, have a sex life with Cas.
“Yeah,” Dean says, leaning over the back of Cas’s chair. “Back up. Who’s Janine?”
“I’m sophisticated,” he says with a shrug.
On Kara, walking around her gorgeous, expensive-looking apartment.
“He’s both. He’s neither. He is, as it were, the Eternal and the Light, I suppose.” Cas sighs again, turning his eyes towards Dean in that deeply earnest, tired way that always makes Dean fidgety. “He’s just Jack, Dean. Even now. Think of him as Jack.”
“Make sure he takes it, would you? In the long term, again, you’re very lucky. You’re looking at high mobility. You may have some chronic lower back pain. Clearly you’re active and in good shape, and it shouldn’t take away from any of your hobbies unless you’re a very serious athlete.”
Oh, uh, yeah. Very observant. Good job.
Cas makes a pleased noise and burrows into Dean’s shoulder.
“You, uh…” Dean comes up behind Cas, clapping a hand down on his shoulder. “You doing all right there, pal?”
“How are you with the public?”
“Well, yeah. But if you eat you’ll feel better.”
“We love having you, Dean,” Eileen says. “And you too, Cas. Be safe. Let us know if you need anything.”
I know it's just a superstition, Dean. It's - it's silly.
“Okay,” he says, “but you gotta let me go so I can go grab some dinner too.”
Sam puts his hands in his pockets, looking sheepish.
Eventually Cas comes out of the bathroom, dressed but disheveled, still looking ashen.
“Y’all have fun now,” she says. “Hope everything’s good with your room.”
Cas just smiles serenely, as Cas is wont to do lately.
stickin’ around,” John D shouts from the other end of the bar, “I’d tell you we have karaoke on Wednesdays.”
“All right then,” he says. “Well, come on.”
Cas nods and stands.
“I don’t know, man,” Dean finally says, looking anywhere but at Sam. “I’ve been thinking.”
Winky face.
He kicks his jeans off too, pulls the covers down on the bed, pats the space next to him.
“I don’t think so,” says Cas. “I’m not very hungry.”
Still nothing. He sits in the silence for a few minutes, but really it’s an hour. He heads back to Sam’s.
Cas nods, looking up at him.
“Options,” Dean says again, and the disgust he felt at the paint samples drops back into his body like a brick from a ten-story building. “You know why he was at Home Depot? He got all these stupid fuckin’… paint chips. Wants to paint the walls in the house blue. Live there forever.”
He looks sweet, standing there in jeans and a yet-unbuttoned flannel—with assistance from Sam’s cash, he now personally owns 5 plain t-shirts, one pair of jeans, two flannels, several pairs of underwear, a watch, a belt, one pair of black boots, and (for undercover purposes) a suit from Goodwill that Dean took to an old lady in Kenosha to get tailored for fifteen dollars. All the essential parts of a man’s wardrobe, in Dean’s opinion. Looking at him standing there, Dean thinks about how much things have changed in the few weeks since Cas has gotten back. How little. Cas has been shaving (to Dean’s minor disappointment) and he got a haircut last week, so now he’s back to looking like regular old Cas. Just in different clothes. Dean kind of misses the old uniform, he’ll admit, but there’s still something about seeing Cas in hunting clothes that feels right, or at least wrong enough to be worthwhile.
He hesitates outside the door. Brings his hand up to knock. Then he remembers that it’s his house and he doesn’t have to knock. He opens the door.
“How did he choose to come back? What’s—” Sam rubs a hand over his face, sits down at the dining table. “So that’s really Cas? And, what, he just decided to come back from Heaven because he was bored?”
“He is,” Cas says hurriedly. “He’s doing a great job. But I’m not sure it’s what he wants.”
You know how the curse works.
Dean can't help but laugh at that. God, he's in love. It physically hurts. He steps forward again and Cas meets him in the middle. They're basically face-to-face now, both on edge.
Rowena is a very powerful witch.
What?
While Dean starts making coffee, Cas sits in silence.
When he’s calmed down and he comes back out, Cas looks at him a little strangely, but doesn’t comment.
“They seem like a hoot and a half,” Dean adds uselessly.
“Lucky,” says Dean. “Sure.”
Cas pulls out a knife. Dean stares.
“Are you sure?” says Cas. “Are you sure you’re not looking for a way out of this?” He hears the way Cas says
Eventually, Cas stands and walks into the bathroom. Wraps his arms around Dean from behind, his lips pressed together in moderate, tender consternation.
Sam do anything, is he? He doesn’t have to decide what’s good for Sam anymore. That’s Eileen’s job now. And, okay, sure, maybe Sam’s. Maybe mostly Sam’s, actually.
I don't know, Sam. We're so close to opening the portal. Maybe we should reserve our energy.
“You didn’t do any work,” says Sam.
for thirty lifetimes.”
Castiel smiles.
"Hey Cas?” he whispers.
“Good. Good.”
“Right,” says Dean. He only kind of knows what that means. It sounds like the kind of stuff people usually say about God—stuff that he knows for sure wasn’t true about Chuck. But maybe Jack is leaning into it. Maybe he’s not even doing it on purpose. Or maybe it’s just that Cas is special, being Jack’s father and everything. Dean hasn’t even tried praying to Jack since right before he started praying to Cas again.
“I figured it’d be pretty easy to swing since that’s Jimmy’s legal first name,” says Sam. “And it’s a nice way to honor his, uh... sacrifice.”
Reflexively, Dean squeezes his burger so hard that it splits in half. He says nothing.
Dean closes his eyes, inhales deeply.
“Oh.” Cas looks at the bed, then at Dean. Then his eyes widen. “Oh.”
“That makes sense,” he says. “You earned some time to think about it.”
Cas says nothing, just gasps a little as Dean grinds his hips down. They stay like that for a while, until Dean slows down enough that Cas gets impatient and flips him, climbing on top and pinning him down. Usually this is about how it goes—Dean attempts not to think consciously about the fact that they’ve done this often enough that they have a routine he can point to. It’s not that he doesn’t like it; it’s really, really not that he doesn’t like it. It’s just the routine of it all that he tries not to let unsettle him.
Cas leans over the console, kisses him on the forehead. It feels like signing on to something new.
Dean exhales hard through his nose. He feels it happening. He’s fucking it up. As always. He knew it was too good to be true. But then he looks at Cas and remembers how much he wanted this, begged for this. He tries to reel himself back in.
“No way,” says Dean. “I’m coming back, I’m comin’ back on my terms. The bedroom’s already done, so no big deal there.” He points at Sam. “But you’re gonna be the one pulling up that musty carpet in the living room.”
Jake raises an eyebrow. “You imagine? You not on good terms?”
I'll go check the hookup rolodex in the Impala.
“What?” he says. “What’s wrong?”
Brad hangs up and tosses his phone onto the table. He looks around, feeling suddenly free. He smiles. And then he bursts into flames. Close-up on the pile of flaming ashes that constitute his remains.
“It’s whatever,” she says, waving a hand. “You left some sloppy seconds. I took out a few werewolves in Iowa a few weeks ago. There’s gonna be rugarus for, like, ever. But no demons, no
I love you too.
“You were just in the kitchen. You tellin’ me you couldn’t hear everything I was saying?”
Yeah, well, I don't really think it either. But it's like - it's in there, and it's been in there the whole time, and now it's obvious and I can't stop saying it. And I hate it, but I also feel kind of free, you know? Like I want to say it. But also I don't. I really don't.
gets too attached? What if Cas actually hated it? What if it wasn’t actually as good as Dean thought it was, and he remembers more of it, and it freaks him out? What if they can’t even look at each other anymore? What if Cas wants nothing to do with him?
“Maybe I need dessert too,” she says.
“I must be very perceptive,” Cas says, obviously pleased with himself.
Sam pops back out of the car with a question mark on his face.
“Uh,” Dean says, the barest hint of panic edging into his voice. “New York?” Jesus Christ.
Then Cas kisses him in earnest, a few weeks’ worth of pent-up anxiety all spilling out of both of them: the new job, the fall off the ladder, all the envy and fragility that Dean knows radiates off him, that he knows must be exhausting for Cas, but he can’t help it, because Cas is adjusting so well to the human world and Dean, the lifelong human, is floundering. And yet here’s Cas every day with all his mercy, his grace, his forgiveness for the mundane and the unforgivable, his endless patience for Dean’s bullshit, his warm, chapped mouth on Dean’s mouth, their breath intermingling, and Dean wants nothing more than to give Cas the life he deserves, the life he finally has a shot at, but no matter how hard he tries he still doesn’t know how.
“Cas,” he says. “Okay. Okay. I guess you’re right. There’s some stuff we need to talk about.”
Cas brings a hand up to his head, looking startled. Dean laughs.
“There’s,” Cas starts, and instead of finishing the sentence he sneezes in a way that looks almost comically painful. Dean reaches out for his knee, pets it while Cas blows his nose. This is it, baby. Domestic fantasy. “There’s something else,” Cas says, more stuffed up than ever, his nose red and raw, looking totally pitiful, but his eyes are steely.
“Oh, no, it’s not like that,” he says. “We’re good. He’s just—he’s so busy. And everything. With the job. Big important job. Fuckin’… uh… you know. Crazy hours. He hardly sleeps.”
“What?”
“I was going to ask, Dean,” Cas says, reaching out and brushing Dean’s hair back, and Dean is humiliated at how instinctively he leans into the touch, which until this moment he abruptly realizes he had subconsciously resigned himself to never feeling again. “I want to ask how your day was. Because that’s—” He doesn’t finish the sentence.
“We’ll try out some other ones soon. I’ll hit you with ‘em when you least expect it.” He considers. “Maybe a
“Well, Mr. Developmental Officer—”
“What’s the plan for today?”
“Is this—” he says, starting to sound concerned again through the haze of arousal. Dean nods vigorously.
Dean carefully removes his hands from his mouth.
“What?” says Dean. “Of course I have. When I prayed to you all year—and in Purgatory that one time—”
“Good old C.J.,” says Dean, slapping a hand down on the table. “My good buddy C.J. Novak.”
There are many, many things Dean could say.  He falls back onto the bed, sighing loudly, hands lacing over his stomach too. It’s not that he wants to lie. He just doesn’t know what the truth is.
“I can have a talk,” Dean mutters. And then Sam is saying something about outdated modes and property and patriarchy and gender and Dean is saying, “Okay, I get it, I get it,” just to get Sam off his back. Somehow that lightens the mood enough for both of them to relax, and Dean leans forward onto the table, putting his chin in his hand.
Cas shifts in his seat.
Castiel loiters awkwardly at the door.
Sam says, “Dean, you sure you’re doing okay?”
Still don't know if we should've come back home, man. What if something happens to Kara? What if there's somebody else?
“What?” he says, rolling onto his back to look up at Cas’s face. Cas tilts his head down to look at Dean, expression unreadable.
Yeah?
They do all the dumb road trip stuff Dean never really felt interested in doing with Sam: stopping in at dilapidated Midwest amusement parks and non-haunted tourist traps; going to the drive-in movie to see
Cas must feel the change in the air—or maybe he just feels Dean’s heart start to race, or even just the hand clawing into his back—because he kisses right behind Dean’s ear, then around, up his jaw, slowly, until he lands on his lips, light but stable.
Hi, is this Melanie?
“Listen, son,” says Tom, “I’m impressed by your resume and, well, we’re a little short-handed here. Normally I’d give you an interview, but how’s about I just give you a probationary period on the job next week, since we need a hand and all, and if we like each other you can stick around?”
“I made it back eventually,” Cas says, squeezing his hand.
“Hunting
Cas comes in holding bags, and Dean turns to say something passive aggressive, or maybe just aggressive, but then he notices that the bags say “Home Depot.” What was Cas doing at the Home Depot for almost an hour?
So it's a two-for-one. Interesting. Anything bad gonna happen to Kara?
About an hour later, there’s a doctor in front of them, saying, “It’s just a sprain. It’s mild, so you should see significant improvement fairly soon. You’ll just need to keep an eye on it and ice it a few times a day for at least a week.”
Castiel kisses him. Gentle but forceful. A
Sam, Dean, and Castiel exit a diner after a massive breakfast. Dean stretches dramatically.
“Well, one of ‘em.” Dean applied to at least ten garage jobs, and this is the only one he’s heard back from. But it just takes one yes, he guesses. “Whatever abracadabra bullshit you pulled on my resume sure took a while to kick in.”
“Last time I was human you still had cosmic protection. You were in grave danger every day, but—but you weren’t going to get into an
Ready as I'll ever be.
Charlie. She made that clear early on. So hearing Cas say “was” strikes a chord that Dean can’t totally identify.
Cas shrugs. “You’ve probably heard me say it before.”
“What do you mean?” Cas says, squinting.
BLACKOUT.
Dean shifts around in the bed on instinct but it hurts—he hisses through his teeth. The doctor nods at Cas, who stood the moment Dean showed any indication of being in pain.
“Man? Really?”
“I’m gonna,” he grunts. “Kitchen.”
3) behold......... the Sexual Scene
A few more pleasantries and then Cas herds him into the tiny office kitchen. Before Dean can say anything at all, Cas grabs him by the shoulders and looks him square in the face.
“No. Not molecules. Just…” He takes another bite—chews, considers, swallows. “Bland.”
Bridget greets them at the door in an outfit somewhere between a devil and a superhero: red leotard, red cape, pink tights, pointy headgear. Is it sexy? He can’t decide. If it
“What are you talking about?”
“Is it too much?” he says. “I just thought it would be nice to have. I’m sorry if it brings up bad memories.”
Sam shoots a glance at Castiel, who's somewhere between totally spellbound and wanting to vomit.
“Jack had you on secretary duty?”
“Of course you do,” Dean shouts from across the room.
Then Cas’s hand is under his shirt, rubbing his side tentatively, and Dean pulls away. He feels his heart pounding in his chest again. Maybe it’s too much, too fast. Maybe he can’t do this.
Cas squeezes his shoulders. “I’m excited to move forward,” he says. “To just… be a person. Not just a human. A person.”
“No, you’re right,” says Dean, scratching at the back of his neck. “He. Got a girl too though.” He kicks himself for offering extra information, but he’s well-versed in revealing more to reveal less, and at least it’s not totally true. Claire is his and not his. So is Jack. Maybe this is his out—they can talk about Claire. It’s easier to talk about Claire.
“What about supplies?” Sam asks as Cas returns. Dean notices Cas’s eyes flicker over to Sam in a way that might be weird—it’s hard to tell with Cas.
Gabriel gulped at the sound of their daughter's outraged tone. He finally finished wading through the people at the double doors just in time to see Jess planted next to the table with her hands on her hips. Her beautiful face was tinted with betrayal and horror, as if she couldn't believe her dad actually showed up to the dance unannounced. Behind her, Oliver was nervously fidgeting with his own hands. The loud music continued to play in the background, making it difficult for them to hear each other.
,” the guy says, drawing out the second syllable like he’s impressed. “Never heard that one before.”
Are you... feeling any better?
“You don’t have to say anything. I just wanted you to know I heard them. So I came back.”
“Ooh,” says Emily. When Dean gives her a look, she says, “I’m twenty-two!”
“You should know that we’re—well, as you know, we’re living here together, alone… but together… And there’s a reason for that. We—Dean and I—we’re—"
“I’ve been dead many times,” says what looks like Cas, stepping forward into the light. He’s wearing an orange t-shirt and bootcut jeans. “Also, I don’t know if ‘dead’ is the most accurate way to describe my recent tenure in Heaven. Certainly death-adjacent.”
“Dean,” Cas says, but Dean interrupts him.
Dean chokes a little on his beer.
Castiel knows what he wants to say. He doesn't know if he should.
“Sometimes you can’t taste stuff when you’re sick,” Dean offers. “Because of the inflammation.”
“No, Dean, no,” Cas says in a rush, grabbing for Dean’s hand. “Nothing to do with you. He’s just—he’s trying to make things better.”
“I see,” says Cas. “Yes.”
that makes him feel selfish for not appreciating what he already has. He doesn’t even know what else he wants. It’s not like he isn’t already happy. But no matter how close he is to Cas, something in him always calls for
“Eileen and I happened to be engaged in scintillating conversation,” Cas says, eyes glittering.
He shifts just enough to pull his shirt off and Cas does the same, throwing his across the room with force. Dean does a double-take and looks back at Cas, questioning.
When?
We'll figure it out. Tell Rowena to hurry up.
. They’ve rehearsed the story too of his time in the clergy, how he’d fully immersed himself in the church after his illness and turned away after falling in love with a man. It’s all very romantic, Dean thinks, very soap opera.
Dean and Castiel both stand up. Castiel and Sam look at Dean.
I can imagine.
On Marjorie, elegant and terrifying.
“Sam is sending me job listings,” Cas says, ignoring him, scrolling with concentration. “Accountant… Development officer… Director of Diversity and Inclusion…”
“Dean,” says Cas seriously. “I mean at all. Ever.”
Cas tilts his head into Dean’s hand, unsure.
And now Dean is experiencing another emotion, one he pushes down very deep at once. He’s not going to think about marrying Cas right now. He can’t. Cas with a ring on his finger, Cas Winchester—Dean coughs. Coughs again. Keeps coughing.
Cas shrugs. “I’ve retained certain things. Especially since my ASL is still active. My Korean, on the other hand, might be a bit rusty.”
INT. IMPALA - DAY
At breakfast, Cas orders a normal amount of food: a bacon and egg sandwich, another cup of coffee. The hangover from hell really has seemed to level out his appetite over the last couple weeks.
“Have you ever cooked, Cas?” she asks.
“D&D?” Dean snorts fondly. They really do have some things in common with Charlie. “Nerd.”
Hey, man, you've been quiet this morning. Quieter than usual, I mean. You good?
“You really love me?”
,” she says, somewhat sheepishly, when she catches Dean blinking at her.
“I can’t send you out there by yourself, Dean,” he says, his forehead tight with stress. “Are you sure you don’t want me to come with you?”
here, it’s you.”
“Significant other,” Cas mumbles. “Companion. Lover?”
“Hello, Emily,” Cas says kindly. “Hello, Safiya. Would you give us a moment?”
Before Dean has a proper chance to react to being called “darling” in public for the first time, Cas is standing, coming around the desk. Grabbing Dean’s hands. Dean feels his entire face flush. For a second, Cas tilts his head at him in concern—then his eyes widen for just a second and he lets go, steps back, leans against the desk. It’s casual in a way Dean didn’t really know Cas was capable of, and Dean knows he’s only doing it because he knows Dean so well—knows Dean is still pretty afraid to do this in public, no matter how small that public is.
“What do you want, Dean?” Castiel's mouth is as bitter as ash and radicchio. He rolls the anger around in there, sour as a lemon. Spit it out, get it out. He can still hear Dean's words from last night.
? Are you serious?!”
“Hmm. Good question. Why don't you just text him back and ask him?” Dean suggested.
“Rowena, can you tell me where you purchased those things as well?” the angel in the trench coat asked, his voice still as serious as before, “I, um, I believe I know someone who would enjoy that type of activity.”
Lucifer stepped close to look God in the eye, their faces only inches apart.
The outside of Bobby's house looked like a damn sci-fi movie gone wrong. The ground was jagged and uneven everywhere, making trees stick out in awkward positions. A few stacks of his junk cars were overturned and sprawled all over the ground, and some of the ones parked along the street had been smashed by downed trees and power line poles. All of it was barely visible in the lights from Bobby's windows. The entire scene would have been pitch black otherwise. The wind was heavy, cold, and full of debris, but Clarence braced a shoulder against it and kept on trudging. He had a job to do and a little change of scenery wasn't going to stop him.
Sam finally heaved a great sigh before he swooped down and – to Dean's utter horror – quickly smacked his lips against Gabriel's. The sight of it made Dean's insides curdle like spoiled milk. Ugh! The two of them kissing just wasn't right! But, thankfully, it was just a small peck, quick enough that it was over in a blink. And then, Sam was on his way, tromping off toward the mass of vacant tables while steam rolled off his flustered face.
person in the bunker, Jude discovered as he walked inside. Some guy was standing in the middle of the room, twirling around to look at the Winchester family, who were all surrounding him in a loose circle. Jude studied the new person as he paused in the doorway. The man seemed kind of young, closer to Jude and Jessie's age than their parents. His hair was shaggy and messy, like he hadn't combed it in a long time. His clothes seemed really old and worn out, and there was a guitar case on his back. Whoa. Did he play the guitar? Why was he in the bunker? Who was he?
Hey, you guys! I missed all of you! *hugs you tight* :D NashCon was awesome and it was even more amazing to meet some of you in person! Thank you so much for making my life that much more worth living! :) (Btw, I may or may not have forced Richard Speight Jr to hold a moose for a photo op. And did an air-guitar in front of Jensen Ackles as he was signing my poster... *ahem* Yeah. Crazy weekend. Lol!) XD Anyways, I'm really sorry that this chapter wasn't as long as usual, but hopefully its messages still came through strongly. ;) The 'Enochian' that Cas and Michael argued in earlier was actually Latin (because Enochian translators wouldn't work with me. Lol) Basically, Cas said: “You did this, This is your fault!” and Michael replied with “Enough!” Sorry for the lack of Enochian continuity, but I hope it doesn't distract from the story too much. Also, some of you probably noticed already, but I'll let you in on a little secret: I sort of turned the Darkness character into one big giant metaphor for depression. Since it is something that I, and many of us in the fandom, struggle with, I figured this would be a great opportunity to 'introduce' it into a story and basically deal with it. And you know what? I'm happy to say that we are going to join Jude in facing Darkness together. We can do it! Because we are not alone! ;) Thank you guys soooo much for patiently waiting for this week's chapter! I hope it was worth the wait. I'm very grateful to have you all as readers! :) The next chapter will be out soon! :)
“Oh yeah. My celestial six-pack. Did I not tell you about that? It's good for attracting moose,” the archangel mused.
“Well,” Chuck sighed, “I guess it means Jude is pretty powerful. And he's going to do great things.”
Sam's smile returned. It was really sweet that Gabriel wanted to keep Jess young for as long as possible. But even their child had to grow up eventually. Wanting to comfort him, Sam raised up to capture Gabe's mouth with his own again. This kiss was softer and more powerful, meant as a statement of love and support.
“A race car,” Jude answered, digging around in his pocket to get it out and hold it up, “Look, Daddy, the doors open too!”
“Whoa, calm down. Everybody's fine,” Dean promised, glancing over at his son, “Jude just kinda... made all the machines explode with his grace. Nobody got hurt.”
Jess pressed her hand flat against her stomach as she hovered over the toilet. Luckily, the urge to vomit was slowly going away, but she was still left trying to figure out the cause. Maybe she had a little too much to drink at the reception. Or Papa spiked more food with magic or something. Feeling clammy, Jessica tilted her head toward the bedroom and laid it down against the toilet seat. Through the open door, she caught sight of her stuffed bunny and Ollie's unicorn laying on the floor. Her white rabbit seemed to be giving her a stern expression, like he didn't approve of the fact that she was kneeling naked on the bathroom floor with her head on a toilet seat. But he didn't understand how sick she felt.
wasn't there yet, dammit! There was a bag full of gifts in the truck that Jude and Jessica still needed to open before the day was over! How in the hell was he supposed to find the damn place when it was completely hidden from view?
Though he was a little bummed about not being able to finish his story, Sam gulped down the rest of his research and pointed to a specific spot on the map on the screen.
. She belonged to
“Skunks don't get drunk, Clare,” Jude paused his steps to argue in the hall, “and I'm not a virgin. Stop calling me a virgin -”
“Brother,” Michael said sternly, “I was sure you finally left for good. What brings you back to this battlefield?”
“Your rapist,” Cas clarified, “He's dead. Several months ago, we captured him. He attempted to gain Clarence's trust, but Clarence resisted his advances. The man was slain, salted, and burned in his own home...”
“Those were angelic soldiers, Samsquatch,” Gabriel said quietly, walking over to plop himself into a chair at the table, “Recon division, I think.”
“Thank you, Gabriel. Your advice has been most helpful,” he said truthfully.
“Uh... Aren't you guys a little early?” he mumbled, peering out from under the bill of his worn hat.
“Gabriel always seemed like a magician to me,” she admitted after a few minutes, tired smile on her mouth while her hands held onto Ollie's arm, “I suppose it was true.”
“Y – you don't have to do this, moose,” Gabe commented.
“It's not making sense,” Jess grumbled nervously.
"Mornin', Sammy," Dean sang, tossing him a grin over his shoulder.
“The kid loves Motown,” Oliver said over the music.
“Baby... I just met your dad.”
Everyone watched in surprise and bewilderment as Jessica ran to hug Rowena's tiny waist. The forceful impact nearly knocked the witch over, causing her to gasp and stumble a bit. Rowena seemed equally confused by Jessica's sudden display of affection. The two of them had never met before. How did Jessica know her name? Perhaps the young girl had overheard it in conversation.
"Oh, Jess," Ms. Jane finally muttered, "You're so beautiful."
“Dad?”
“But I have some conditions,” Dean quickly added.
As usual, the animal shelter was loud; full of barking dogs and meowing cats. By the tone of their excitement, it was morning feeding time, which meant that Ollie was handing out food. Jessica's assumption was proven right when she spotted his red hair bobbing along the top row of cages across the hall. The voice of his boss echoed from the back of the building as Jessica and Dickie ventured out of the closet.
"Did they know your mom?" uncle Sam asked.
“Yeah, I know,” Jude replied, bobbing his head, “Just like Batman and Superman.”
“Just think. You still get to look forward to your proposal,” Jude offered as kindly as he could, speaking low so no one else would hear.
Jess nodded and wiped her tears away as Bobby pat her shoulder and moved away to greet the rest of the angels in the kitchen. As he and Crowley walked by, Rowena came up to take Jess’s face in both hands.
“Baby, what are you doing up? You need to stay off your feet,” Dean said, placing a hand on top of the warm baby bump.
The room in which the cage was sitting didn't have any natural light. In fact, the only source of light in the area was coming from Gabe's hand. It cast a golden shine on the empty room around them, showing that there wasn't anything else in it. The ceiling was really high and appeared to be made out of metal, almost like a warehouse or garage, and the floor was a solid sheet of stone. The walls beyond the cage were plain but dirty, with spots of ash or soil splattered across some of the blank surfaces. It looked like there was one door straight across from the cage, but it was shut. And a very large square piece of wood was nailed to the wall opposite the cage, which Gabriel assumed was a boarded up window. The whole sight of the room was boring and lonely and it made Gabe wonder. Were they still on Earth? Or was this cage in Hell? Or Purgatory? Or even Heaven? He had no way of finding out as long as they were trapped.
Jessica nodded fiercely, looking genuinely afraid. Gabriel straightened up her rainbow hat and adjusted her curls as he spoke his next words.
Bobby exhaled heavily again and rolled his eyes, acting annoyed and flustered. It seemed like he didn't want to answer any of their questions; like he was trying to keep this whole thing a secret, even from Sam and Dean.
Dean's eyes carefully traveled up to meet Cas's and he could tell that the angel already knew what he was going to say. Cas's free hand was back to clutching the arm of the rocking chair and his head was already starting to shake back and forth a little bit. Fear and panic were growing in his precious blue eyes. But no matter how much they both hated it, Dean had to say it.
“Castiel?” Meg repeated, her tone and expression filling with pleasant surprise, “Cas is still around?”
. For his
“Thanks, Jude,” she muttered, “Good night.”
“I – don’t know,” Dean admitted.
“Good morning, moose!” the archangel sang, sauntering over to greet his husband with a quick kiss to the lips, “Why are you up so early?”
“Darling, don’t you think we should tend to your eldest boy first? You may need to tuck him back into bed and read him a fairytale,” Crowley mentioned sarcastically.
“What?” he asked, probably confused by Dean’s sudden smirk.
“Come on, moose,” Gabe smiled, rounding the car to hold out his hand, “Let's go make small talk with the nice lady like normal people do.”
A loud, winded, dramatic sigh came from across the room and almost everyone turned toward the kitchen. Rowena – red hair tossed in all directions, fancy dress stained with various oils and potions, sleeves rolled up, hands and face dirty, and eyes weary and dark from lack of sleep – had slumped into the nearest kitchen chair and was blinking back at the crowd. Though she was extremely exhausted and looked like she could use a hot bath, she still managed to smile back at the rest of them.
“It's alright, son,” Cas instantly comforted, voice much calmer than before, “Jane took your suit to be dry cleaned this morning. When she brought it back, I placed it in the laundry room.”
In between writing fanfic, I have actually written and (finally) self-published my first book! :D It is called “The Cotton Candy Man,” and it’s available on Amazon now. If you couldn’t tell from the title, it is HEAVILY inspired by Sabriel. There are many Sabriel/Supernatural easter eggs in the story, like the fact that Robbie’s second job is being a Janitor, like Gabe’s was in Tall Tales. (In fact, Dickie himself makes a cameo.) XD It’s an emotional read, but totally worth it if you can make it to the end. :) Of course, it’s not exactly Sabriel, but they were my motivation. If you’re interested or want more information, here is a link:
The archangel reached over and yanked Bobby's hand back out of his pocket to inspect it. All of the other adults in the room leaned closer to see it, too. The ring on Bobby's finger looked like it was made of solid silver, inlaid with an onyx band and lined with tiny rubies. The thing looked handcrafted and expensive as hell. Where did he get such a nice piece of jewelry? Did Crowley buy it? Did he
Holy shit.
“No,” Sam interrupted.
“Shit, Cas,” he breathed, reaching up to hold the back of Cas's neck, “Ah... Baby...”
“Daddy?” Jude muttered without raising his head.
When it was their turn to get on board, Ollie let Jess get in first. She slid all the way over so that he would have room. The ride operator shut the door behind them after Ollie sat down and the giant wheel began to turn, carrying them high above the festival. Jessica's heart was beating hard and fast, making her lungs race to catch up. '
Gabriel looked back at his brother in surprise, gulped, and revised his statement.
“That hat on your head,” Crowley pointed upward, his smirk growing, “I want it.”
Clare spun around and threw the duffle bag on the floor, making Jude flinch back in the bed.
“Oh, yeah. They're fine. They're in there having breakfast now,” Dean said, briefly waving toward the door, “The angels caught me and Sam and they dinged Sammy up pretty good. But Gabriel healed him and he's fine now. Man, you should have seen what Gabriel did to those angel bastards, Cas. He absolutely
A genuine smirk temporarily flashed on Sam’s face. His granddaughter didn’t call him Grandpa or Pawpaw. She called Sam ‘Moo-moo,’ because she heard Gabe call him Moose all the time. Honestly, Sam had gotten so used to the nickname that he didn’t mind it anymore. To him, Moo-moo was a hell of a lot better than Grandpa.
“Sorry, uncle Gabe,” Jude uttered with a blush.
“Angels over there,” he demanded.
“I know. No more hanky-panky until after the vows,” he rehearsed, “but I can still kiss you, right?”
After saying goodbye to their son in Hawaii, Cas flew with Dean back to the bunker in the blink of an eye. Dean braced himself for the flight, but the inertia still made him sick. By the time he landed back on his feet, Dean's hand was clinched hard around Cas's and his stomach was in his throat. But the familiar feeling and smell of home was able to put him at ease.
It’s like a switch flips in Cas. He falls to his knees too, grabs Dean’s face. “I love you,” he says, breathless. “Oh, I love you. I love you, Dean.” He kisses Dean hard, over and over. Reaches down to unbuckle Dean’s belt.
“Never gonna hate you,” Dean mutters.
Dean knows where it’s coming from, but it still feels like a punch in the gut.
“Time to go?” he says.
Dean nods again, an invitation to continue, though he’s not sure he wants to hear it. He wants to let Cas speak for once. There are just a lot of things Cas could say that he might not want to hear.
Dean exhales loudly and leans back against the headboard while Cas blows his nose again. Then they lie there, shoulder to shoulder, quiet but for Cas’s somewhat labored breathing.
“Okay,” Cas says. “I’ve been having some trouble reading.”
Dean leans back again, thinking, thinking. Cas has always liked being human, sure. Wanted it, preferred it.  But he can’t want it like this, can he? To spend a short, crude life next to the man who hurt him so many times, on accident and on purpose. To give up his peace, his true happiness, whatever the fuck that means, to return to Dean Winchester like a dog and live the rest of his days on Earth in ineffectual uncertainty. Yes, Dean asked for this. Begged for this. He just didn’t think he was going to get it. He feels a throbbing in his cheek, wonders what new emotion causes that. He reaches up and touches it. Realizes he’s hurt.
“You’ve never said anything like that in front of me,” he says, his eyes outlining Dean’s entire face.
, forcefully.
Castiel looks down at his palm. Stares at the coin. CLOSE ON THE PENNY.
“Glad somebody thinks so,” Dean says, grinning.
“I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry I treated you like that. And I’m sorry I didn’t say it back when you—I should have told you while you were here. I need you, okay? I need you. You know, Sam’s good, he has Eileen, and it’s good for him. I’m happy for him. But I’m starting to realize that I’m too fucked up for that kind of happiness. Fucked up for good. And the fact that I made you—” He’s crying now, fully crying. “The fact that you went away because I made you happy is fucking me up, man. It fucks with me. I didn’t make you happy. I made you fucking… suicidal. Nobody who loves me is allowed to be happy. I can’t be happy. Everyone I’ve ever loved but Sam has fucked off or died. Guess you did both. A few times each. But you always came back. Even when I didn’t deserve it. And I definitely don’t deserve it now. But please, please come back again. I know you’re not there, but I’m calling, Cas. Please.”
As he approaches, they both snap their heads up to look at him, wide-eyed, scooting closer together. They must both be early twenties, barely out of college. One of them giggles again, covering her mouth.
“No, I’m the one who’s sorry. Look, I—I should have asked first. I can go get another room if you want.”
Sam, Dean, and Castiel are gathered in the library. Sam paces back and forth nervously. Castiel leans against a bookshelf, arms crossed, looking distracted. Dean is sitting, both hands clamped over his mouth.
He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his card. The penny falls out, onto the floor. Dean doesn't notice as he hands Kara the card. Castiel notices, almost says something, doesn't. Marjorie is watching them intently. She continues staring at them as they leave, then looks back to the floor. Zoom on the penny. Zoom on Marjorie's face, looking ominous.
Dean sits down next to him on the bed. “You steal ‘em?”
“Now tell me you love me,” he says.
Once they’ve hauled it into the living room, the couch is perfect—exactly what Dean wanted, though he hadn’t really let himself picture anything before this. He feels a twinge of something in his chest, something he hasn’t felt since he lived in the bunker, since Cas helped him set up the Dean Cave. Nesting. It feels, just for a second, like maybe this could be a real home after all, not just a place he’s obligated to be. Like maybe Dean is allowed to have what he wants without worrying about what’s coming to destroy it. This place can be what he wants it to be; it can look how he wants it to look. For now it’s just a couch, though. It’s not a big deal.
“Uncle Sammy hurt uncle Gabe,” Jude said again, “He hurt him! He bit him and made him cry! I saw it!”
The dark figure manifested in the far corner of the room, the only part of the brightly lit diner that had any shade. He lingered in the shadows and observed the scene for a moment before calmly stepping into the center of the room. His cane lightly clacked against the floor with his casual footsteps.
She pecked Ollie's sweet lips one more time before sliding to the edge of the cab to climb out of the passenger side. The night air swirled her hair around and she tugged her jacket tighter around her, turning back to wave at her fiancé.
"Do you fight?" (They have never talked about it, what Dean does when he leaves. It is reasonable to expect a fight. The Norsemen have a reputation for war. They are hired by the Byzantines, called the Varangian Guard. Protect the palace; protect the emperor. Sword-quick.)
He pauses, standing and straightening. His tunic caught in wind, his blue eyes sharp. Dark curls wild against his sticky-skin forehead. Look, look out there.
"Not usually," Dean says, rolling up onto his elbow to look at Cas. Castiel doesn't turn. "Sometimes."
Castiel clutches back. A rush of blood. If he knew of electricity (it has not been discovered yet), he might think of it like watching a grid light up as night falls across a continent. Instead, since he does not know electricity, he thinks of the little shipboards of himself. He pictures his body put together like a ship, each board carefully in place. Dean's hands creeping across him like saltseep, soaking him with something strange and rough. He doesn't know what it is. Grab at it, at Dean's rough hands and his hunger-mouth kiss. This grappling. Desperate as a beached fish trying to breathe. (When you do finally breathe, you always wonder how you have managed before. So he wonders.)
“No,” says Cas. “I wasn’t hungry.”
“There’s the upside,” says Dean. “Paid off. Thanks for the reminder.”
“Okay…” Sam says in that infuriating way he does where he’s waiting for Dean to finish the thought.
“Well.” Cas clears his throat. Dean can see the calculations behind his eyes. “As you know, I was in the church.”
“Have you heard me make a phone call?” Dean says, a little too harshly.
“Reasons.” Cas considers this. Then his eyes light up. “Oh,” he says. “Sexual reasons?”
, Dean notes, checking his watch (only 9:57 PM) and his own beer (still mostly full, surprisingly). The guy shoos Janine and her Party City witch hat away to clamp a hand down on Cas’s shoulder.
So it was you. You did this to me.
“You deserve to be saved,” Cas says. “You deserve better than to die on the ground, on a hunt. You still haven’t learned, after all these years. You’ve saved the world, over and over. You’ve saved so many people. You’ve saved me. And I will save you every time.”
Sam is sitting, buried in books. Dean reads half-heartedly. Castiel squints at a laptop.
(measured)
. Then I say
Cas seems to get progressively more excited throughout dinner. Dean doesn’t think he’s drunk—he’s only had two beers the whole time they’ve been there, and he’s been working on his tolerance the past few weeks on the road. When he gets up again to check on dessert, Dean leans over to Sam and whispers, “You seeing this?”
“Yes,” Cas says.
The look that Sam gives him chills him to the core. But then Sam takes a breath, looks calm for the first time since he saw Cas.
So he does remember. Right? That has to mean he remembers.
Kara nods sheepishly.
“I would like that, yes,” Cas says.
you.” He clears his throat, pauses again, listens hard to make sure there are no footsteps, no wings around. It’s less about hope and more about embarrassment. He notices that he’s tearing up. So fucking stupid. But why be embarrassed? Nobody’s listening. The most embarrassing thing is how alone he is, how pathetic, praying to an angel who used to love him but probably hates him now, has probably turned off his Winchester frequency for good.
“We don’t need health insurance,” says Dean with a dismissive wave. “We survived without it this long.”
“Another drink,” he says. When he starts moving towards the bar, he walks backwards for a second, eyes lingering on Dean, before he turns around. Dean follows behind.
... What?
You two already know about the only time I've had sexual intercourse.
“Partner?” Cas offers. Dean thinks about it for a second.
“Wow. Wish I could’ve heard that speech,” says Dean. “Sounds impressive.”
Now they’re playing “Cowboy Take Me Away.” Dean downs both his shots, takes a sharp inhale through the teeth, and lifts Cas up from his seat, slinging a supportive arm around his shoulders.
“Heads up, Cas,” he shouts. Cas is still hovering at the forest’s edge, waiting for an in. “Come on.” Cas rushes in right as she stoops to grab the gun, stabbing her in the back of the neck with the demon knife, and Dean faces away to catch his breath for just a second. Just a second.
and the
Castiel had choked on the open air. He had looked then over at the table, the long and lean form of the sailor, the fire caught in eyes and hair, reflecting from keratin and cornea. The pale catch of light, the smell of straw and salt still sticking to his breath.
Castiel sighs. "Yes, I can see that. That's not - a good idea."
Kiev.
“Are you certain?” Dean asks. Castiel glances away, windcolor on his cheekbones.
“You could get hurt or -“
"I don't want
) In his fingers, a piece of amber, waiting to be given away. Traded, if he is lucky. Amber for honey; honey for amber. Nothing important. Nothing the matter here. A simple merchant’s transaction.
What world is there in which there would be a
Castiel had stumbled on the way through the tavern, overhearing his name.
Later, later, Castiel lays in his little bed, his eyes picking spiders out of the ceiling. Naming them too.
"What do you want, Cas?" Dean asks, his hands moving up along Castiel's chest. The desert of his skin, dry and long-aching. Untouched. (Even if he has been touched, long in the past, it doesn't count. It didn't matter, not like this. He is untouched.)
Dean doesn't still, he is not rigid or panicked. Castiel has wondered over the past day, over and over and over again. Dean's fingers drive into his bicep, the rough scratch of his beard against Castiel's skin. His moan of his, his hard-shut eyes. Castiel had thrown himself over to Dean's mouth but he's the one slowing down, pulling back. He opens one eye slightly, just to make sure Dean has his shut, to make sure that the blush is on Dean's nose too, that the moan is coming from his throat. To keep an eye on the honest-work fingers (to know what is really being said). The fingers clutch, tight and fast. A grip that says
for fuck's sake."
Castiel had hesitated, wondering if he's supposed to keep talking. "Are you - are you staying with - "
and wash our hands of it. That is that. It is unsettling to think that may not be true, that there are stories they never told us. Things they did not leave behind. Logically, of course, that must be false. There must be things we do not know, things that were never written down in pen on paper, in chisel on stone. There are things we do not know.
Dean swallows. "Do you want there to be?"
“No,” Cas murmurs, “Neither did I.”
A story of long ago, somewhere far away. Let's look back, long past the years, past the decades and the centuries too. There is the temptation to review the past and to assume that what we do not know is blank. That if we
"Come on."
It should be self-evident that they were not sleeping together. They can barely stand to be in a room together without somehow riling each other up. Castiel frowns slightly. It is half his fault, yes. But sometimes, sometimes the things Dean says are impossible things, sometimes they are just infuriating when combined with that oil grin and that wink and the crossed arms and canted hips and Castiel just bites back, sharp sharp sharper than he had intended.
He sees the longships on the horizon, coming into port. Their wood hulls and their woven-wool sails. Castiel is a shipbuilder and a builder always appreciates craft, so he admires the graceful curves of the ships.

Castiel takes a swallow.
"You're leaving in the morning," Castiel whispers.
Let us look at it, as Castiel does when he passes along the banks. Look at it, wide and dark blue, the heavy forests hugging the edges like mountains might crowd a pass. He knows that the soil is good here, that if he digs his hands into the ground, they will come away filled with black earth. The water blooms with green algae in the spring and summer, bits of plankton and rotifers. The fishermen catch pike and perch, chub and catfish. They gut them there, right in their boats, the smell of fishstink like salt and blood in the air. In the spring, there might be sturgeon and herring too. It smells exactly
There is a spot on the river. Sails on a ship. Smoke-colored and sharp against the sky.

were talking, I heard you."
Despite being in the center of the world, (or maybe because of it) there are many longships he has never seen. Kiev is land-swallowed. The trade ships come through the Slavuta, the river, limited in depth. But there are oceans out there and seas too, wide stretches of unknown water. He aches to know. The sailors tell him that these ships are the
easy on me?”
Castiel shifts uncomfortably. He looks over at Dean, this bed of grass and rock. He doesn't want to think of that. Consumption, the spit of blood into cloth. (The earliest we know of tuberculosis in humans is in the skeletons of a mother and her child, found beneath the water at Atlit-Yam in Israel. Tuberculosis comes into history’s lens eight-thousand years ago. In with villages and agriculture, in with domestication. With stories. Tuberculosis has never left us. Faithful friend, that one. The lesions on the bones had seemed familiar, even millennia later. We scraped the DNA from their ribs, the bones of their arms, the ulna and radius.
Like the first time and like all the times after.
"Why do you want me to stay?" He pauses, "We don't even get along."
He is watching the water. Bending and picking out good stones to throw in the river.
Castiel watches the river. The longest minutes in our lives are spent in waiting rooms and this one has no

Dean quirks a brow, "That so, then?"
Are you still with me? Castiel and his cast-iron heart, his shipwreck heart. Castiel and the river, bearing back and away again. He has been touched once, he is still terrified.
The world is changing. (The past is burning too.)
(Said as if they were poker-hot, as if they tasted like battery acid.)
“Why?” Castiel and his suspicious glance. Dean shrugs, picking at a leaf, peeling it to shreds. "Dean. It doesn't matter - you said it yourself. There's
He still remembers that day, six years ago, when a horse had spooked. Had darted, throwing Dean from his saddle, down into the river. Castiel, steady Castiel (those eyes like chromium, like the sea), had spread his hands, already grown into an adult at nineteen, had gripped Dean by the shoulder and raised him from the depths. The grip had been desperate against the water, against the current, had left a bruise in the shape of a hand. Days later, watching Dean jump into the river, Castiel could almost see the fingerprints still in his skin. (He had looked at them then, thought of them still sometimes. Had felt a strange loss when they faded, healed away to nothing.)
me?” (Strangely serious.) Dean pauses, “It smells like smoke, doesn't it?”
Castiel lives in the center of the world. All roads lead to Kiev. Rivers too.
Half-asleep, it is not too difficult to think of Dean's skin, the color of polished natural oak. Of his eyes that, if you are close enough, remind Castiel of the river's yearly algae bloom. Castiel has never had anyone in his bed, he's never fumbled his way into anyone else's. It's always seemed a bit of a mess, hasn't it? Clumsiness and awkward petting, confused hands and stickiness. He's always avoided it. Now, suddenly, something else. He tries to picture Dean in the height, eyes slammed shut and face shattered with want like a broken window. Castiel has never wanted to be the brick through the glass but suddenly he is there, in the kiln, being fired for only one reason. He touches himself with disbelief.
“Yes,” Castiel breathes.
There is a very very strange tone to Dean's voice. "No," he says, pausing slightly. "We're not friends." He looks over to Castiel's crossed arms. "I'll make sure they don't say anything else to you though. Friend or not."
The worst of all confessions. It has been happening since the dawn of time, the beginning of all things. We meet our lovers with that instant knowledge. We do not love at once but we know, we know, we always know that there is a spot for them upon our shelves, that they will fit perfectly within. I can exist without you, it will be worse if I am wrong. Don't say it, don't say it, don't say it.

How do you stop that then? Castiel has wondered. There is no telling a heart. Tell me, have you ever wanted what you were supposed to? Tell me about ache, the sounding out of empty spaces, the echo in the room. He thinks of last night, sitting in the tavern, the smell of ale still sick on his shirt.
"Oh."
“Say it.” (
"I'll be back next summer," Dean says. "You'll be here. Like, I mean. Wait for me. I mean, don't. I guess I don't know what I mean."
) See the symmetry of the bow and the stern. No other ships on the water can simply angle their oars the other direction, pull back and reverse direction. The Norse ships are striking. When they come into the Kiev port and Castiel is hired to do repairs, he always likes to run his hands over the beautifully-worn carved pieces of Norwegian pine and Danish oak.
(He knows, of course, about games. You're supposed to play the game, to play by the rules. Even if you're in bed, even as you say
He stands at the river. His feet on the sandbar, the water not much further. A handful of pebbles in his sun-dark hand, throwing them to the water, seeing how fast they sink. It's a bit of a comfort, really, knowing that once they're past the surface, they won't be seen again. Past him, not too far away, you can hear the strike of hammer and chisel. He can hear the crash of the wooden statues in the streets, oak against stone. It shatters. Wood is always terribly loud, really. It's a strange and unsettling thing, knowing that when he goes back into the streets, they will look different. The wooddark statues of the gods won't be there, proud against a blue sky. Just this empty space. And in this empty space, upon a rock and out of rock, they are building a church.
Want. Strange thing, want.
I am going to tell you a story.
"Are you? Leaving?" Castiel squints off across the river, trying to make out distant points of light. Stars, maybe. Fires, perhaps.
Yes, here on the hilly shores of the Slavuta River, here where the world comes to ask for a bit of cloth, a parcel of salt. Here, where the ships sleep. The Slavuta is the carotid artery of the world, the long vagus nerve up the spine where all signals pass. It rises in the north, in the Valdai Hills, flows south through valleys and farms, forests too, before coming to empty into the brackish waters of the Black Sea. How old is the river? We don't know, not exactly. We do know that it has not always borne that name. We can read from Herodotus that the Greeks had called the long river
"Why?"
A nod. Silence. They are not usually silent.
eating you alive from the inside out. Hammurabi’s ancient code talks of it. The Yajurveda speaks of it. Even the Bible, newly adopted here, even in this Bible, this old pestilence is not unknown.
The sailor's name is Dean Winchester. Castiel's workshop had been one of his first stops after coming into port a few weeks ago. It always is; it always has been. Fifteen years now of this dance, of Dean sailing up the river and down again, his ships loaded with honey from northwestern hives and asking, holding out wide hands, for bits of Kievan amber. Amber torn from trees. Clear sometimes. Clear enough to see the dead things inside. Preserved flies, entombed ants and honeybees.
Why would it matter? Dean is nothing to Castiel. A familiar sailor, porting twice a year, occasionally coming in to lean against well-polished wood and eye up Castiel's workshop. So what if the lean is too long and a bit too much against the counter, against the worktable? So what if Dean’s hands are long and work-rough and tanned where the sun has touched?
Perhaps, that is it. Castiel has never understood why, when spring and autumn come, when the ships come from the Baltic (with Dean at the stern), Castiel loses all interest in shipbuilding. He twitches to and fro. Out of focus; out of order. He wanders over the grass and the roads, picking at rocks and bark. He loses interest in eating even. Dull thing, food. Who can eat when there is this rollicking to him, this network of bright lights and gooseflesh stealing across his arms and the thick of him?
Dean sighs. "Look, Cas, I don't know what the fuck you want from me. You're always like this. You're just fucking impossible."
But history isn't important.

"Cool. Good," Dean had said, "Sounds real good, Cas." He frowns, staring off into the dark back corner, quiet.
"What did you say?" Castiel hisses.
"Lots changing here, isn't there?" Dean had ventured.
The trouble with want is that, where we are considered, there are no rules. We cannot legislate want, cannot carve it into stone. We cannot chisel it into clay tablets or onto a basalt stele in the way of the Babylonians and Hammurabi with his code. Dean is a sailor, coming into every port. He has heard all the religions and their own codes, their rules. The Christians, who have begun building their churches near his own town, saying
Castiel had nodded, keeping his tone even. "It'll be done by then. I'll come down to the docks with it."
It's the following night when Dean finds him on the edge of the river. He holds the wine bottle out to Castiel. "Here."
"What? I could

"In the grass?"
"Lie down, Dean," he says, pulling Dean's straw-tan body down with him. Pulling down the question-mark mouth and the spilling confession, the wide grasshopper eyes. The two together, the bit of grass.
"We don't like each other."
Castiel pauses.
A dry laugh, humorless. He still holds out the bottle. Castiel doesn't move toward him. "Just go with me for once, Cas? Alright? Can we just

"Yes," Castiel had said, had offered nothing else. Dean certainly already knew. The stories have flown wild of how Vladimir had gone to Constantinople and had something of God in the Hagia Sophia. Had brought Christianity back with him, determined to give this gift of the Cross to his city (whether they wanted it or not). So, there is talk of building a church. There had been statues raised to the gods eight years prior. Now, they are being torn down to make way for the skeleton of the church. Taken down and set aflame. Castiel looks out at the sunset. They are strange things, sunsets in fire. How can something so small affect the sky? The visible smoke is gone, there is only this, the smell of fire, burnt wood, the way it discolors the sky. The reds are brighter, the oranges more violent.
Castiel and his wide eyes, counting the thrushes. The blush has gone past his face, his cheeks, his nose. Dean watches it snake like a river down his throat, blotchy and strange, a red algae flush. Across the chest, yes, like a river pours into the sea.
"Yes."
It doesn’t matter. All love stories are the same.
We must ask the question then of them,
"Oh, er, Bobby? Yeah," Dean had said, starting to wander around the shop. Looking at things, picking them up and putting them back down again. He picks up an awl, weighing it in his hands.
he thinks. It makes perfect sense. He has seen the other man pressed up in a clutch before, dark curls in his grasp. Glaring at Castiel for the interruption. It had never quite occurred to Castiel that Dean has a bit of a type, you see. For river-blue eyes and sky-dark curls and those soft to the touch. Perhaps that's why the question had been asked.
“Cas,” Dean says. (
"So let them talk." There is a sound of something, a slam. A boot kicking a tree, perhaps. "Who gives a fuck, Cas?"
