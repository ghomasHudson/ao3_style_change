“Alright, Cas. You can buy my coffee, but after that I wanna hear about this cow. I’ll get us some seats.” He winks and walks away before Cas can answer, but it doesn’t matter. Of course he’ll have coffee with Dean. His meeting can wait. The world can wait.
trials, and those almost killed him. The guy’s friggin surrounded by mooses… is mooses correct? Meeses? No, not that. You know what I mean. Multiple damn moose toys.
“I left my session with Hannah, and you know there is a coffee shop across the street? Well he was there, with what I assume was a date but he definitely
It tastes... better than he thought it would, and he laps up his chin with a grin. “Lick it off, Cas.”
“Yeah. You and me both…” He was quiet a moment before asking, “Where are we going? Where was that church?”
Dean came harder than he had in ages, emptying completely into Cas’ mouth with a loud moan that matched Cas’ as he swallowed, and this time... Dean could feel exactly when he came, too. It sent a shudder right down Dean’s spine and he finally released Cas’ hair, going limp against the bed. “Jesus, that was hot.”
The voices in Dean’s head were screaming at him to go back out to his car and wait. He was already drawing more attention to himself than he wanted to, and Cas
so sure he’d never get another chance, he’d have been content with the frottage tipping him over the edge. Even still, the bolts of pleasure coursing through him each time the glans of Cas’ cock brushed against his frenulum made it a tough call.
Cas was fucking leaking with every bite and when Dean broke the skin, Cas sighed as if it was the best feeling in the world. “Fuck,” he whispered. “There’s no one like you.”
Cas answered with a sharp intake of breath and a smooth hand carded in his hair. “I trust you, Dean.”
Cas flinched and let him go, climbing back into his bed and submitting to the tears that have been clawing their way to the surface for over a day. He completely let go, letting all the tension that has built over the years come pouring out of him. When he had a moment to think clearly, Cas grabbed his phone and put on some metal, hoping their screams would drown out
"Assume away," Cas rushes out, gripping Dean's hand and yanking him toward the door. Maybe all the blood is pooling in the
John walked in from the backyard with Charlie and was shaking his head. “Can you two be any louder?” He ruffled and pushed Dean’s head lovingly.
“Call him. Now. Find out where he is. Say whatever the fuck you need to say.” His jaw was set and the path before them was clear in his mind. He knew he should be more careful than this, but the thought of having an extra body - someone Dean could actually kill - was a strong enough motivator that he didn’t care how risky it was. It had been
“Good. Now ima make this ass mine.” Dean drops down and sucks a mark on Cas’ perky asscheek, ending with a bite that sends a chill up Cas’ spine. When he stands back up, they’re both shaking with need. “Fuck... I can’t wait any longer.”
Sam called Eileen immediately, and broke down crying in front of Dean when she answered. Dean tried his best to be happy for his brother, but that didn't stop the pang of sadness he felt.
Sam noticed the way Dean placed his hand on Castiel's when he was asking a question and how he would let his fingers linger when his question was answered, not wanting to let go.
Castiel said it out loud without thinking as they laid in bed. "I think I want to become human," He whispered. Dean shot up, no longer on the edge of sleep. "What?" He said, placing his hand on Castiel's chest.
Castiel wants Dean to love him. He lets the tears fall over his cheeks, wet and salty. He's tired. He's tired of this nagging feeling, this nagging voice in the back of his mind that tells him he isn't wanted, that he isn't good enough. The voice sounds like Dean's. The voice tells him he's a burden and that he can't do anything right. He believes it.
Dean. He owes everything to Dean, so it's no wonder he constantly throws himself in the line of fire to protect him.
It's been 3 days Dean got Castiel back and Sam can't help but notice the new things about their relationship.
Sam noticed how Dean slowly inched closer and closer towards Castiel over the hours. He noticed the way Castiel looked at Dean when Dean was too into research to notice.
"I-I don't," Castiel croaks out. Dean watches patiently, concern written all over his face. He clears his throat. "I don't want to bother you, Dean."
Castiel thinks about his relationship with Dean and how it's evolved over the years. He remembers his former self. The obedient-but-actually-not-so-obedient soldier, following orders from Heaven and never questioning where they came from. Meeting Dean, everything changed. He found himself smiling and laughing in his presence. Then all at once he realized: he could
"I feel like I'm not enough for you, Dean," he whispers. All at once the words spill out. It feels like pouring alcohol on an open wound and Castiel winces. Dean looks stunned, but he's still holding Castiel's hand.
They said goodbye, Dean on extra tight to Sam, telling him to be safe and called when they got there. Sam smiled at him and Castiel, wiping away his tears. As he got in the car, he looked at Castiel and said, "Take care of my brother." Castiel nodded and grabbed Dean's hand as they drove away.
They spent the first night in their new place watching movies. Boxes all around them, the two of them curled up on the floor in a blanket together. Dean was happy.
Sometimes Dean falls asleep halfway through the movie, his head resting on Castiel's shoulder. Not wanting to wake him, Castiel stays there, in silence, watching over him. He's done it countless times before and he doesn't plan on stopping now.
Castiel feels a dropping sensation in his stomach. Anxiety. Fear. Dean just stares him, mouth open slightly. Castiel pulls his hand away as the shame takes over.
Time after time he has put Dean first, without thinking about the consequences, for himself or others. It makes sense, considering he rescued Dean from Hell, then proceeded to rebel against Heaven and his family
hadn’t had the opportunity to have one on one time with Cas. There was always at least one other person when they fucked.
“How kind of you. Sunday should work again, I’ll let her know if something changes but you should know...” Cas walked back over and grabbed his backpack, leaning in slightly, “Your come is my reward,” then turned toward the door.
“I agree. It’s... hard for me to get off to porn... or with my own imagination. Thank you, Dean.” Cas sounds breathless, but
Cas just hung out with a completely different crowd. He had messy onyx hair and almost never wore color. Everything was just better in black. Some of the jocks teased him for being ‘punk rock’ but that was their mistake. Maybe he dressed like one, but Cas was all about the classics.
They made their way to the North side of town, searching for an exit, only to find a checkpoint. “Oh fuck.” Cas reached over and gripped Dean’s hand. Whatever was about to happen, would happen to them together.
Cas takes a long sip and shakes his head. “No, Charlie mentioned you were late because you chose to work on your car. It's the only vehicle I've seen around here worth putting off sex for. I took an educated guess.”
Dean clicked his tongue. If he lost, that would drain them of basically every penny they had... and he also knew Anthony was full of shit. They were only betting $5 each before he got over there, but his bravado told Dean that Anthony was confident he’d be able to win - and confidence often led to mistakes. He pretended to mull it over and then nodded. “Fuck it, it’s only twenty bucks, right? Not like it’s gonna break the bank.”
“Look at that, Cas. I think he wants you, even though it’s pretty clear you’re gonna give a whole knew meaning to the phrase
Cas smiled and nodded. “Alright. I can do one more drink. And then I have to drive home, I have work in the morning,” Cas lied. He was already bored with David, but he could play the part a little longer.
“You have no idea,” Cas admits quietly. “Especially if you’re not the first one to come.” He wants to say more, to explain that when he jacks off, he uses enough lube to let an elephant safely fuck a mouse just so he can pretend it’s someone else’s come... but he’s not sure if Dean wants to hear it. “I’m speaking about frotting, of course. I’ve never actually taken part in a gangbang, although... I can imagine.”
“Sure thing.” He shook his head and walked home, slightly annoyed that he suddenly got the urge to draw,
Nick shrugged, “He was never officially diagnosed. My dad just told them he wouldn’t stop moving and they gave him pills to make him stop.”
Somehow, looking around him, he doesn’t doubt it. That feeling only intensifies when the door opens for a final time and a tall, insanely gorgeous god walks through the door. A couple of people yell out: “Dean!” which only confirms Cas' suspicion, and suddenly… he's starting to regret choosing to sit things out.
Castiel hummed again. “I’m wrapping my hand around your cock. You’re so wet for me, gorgeous. We might not even need that lube.”
Dean tossed his shirt to the side and crowded Cas, caging him against the car. “I could say the same thing about you.” He drank in the sight of those eyes and then kissed him hard enough their teeth clashed. He broke the kiss and spun Cas around, shoving him down until he was bent over the hood of the Impala. He jerked Cas’ jeans down further to reveal his ass and smacked it roughly enough the sound echoed through the trees around them.
Cordelia smiles softly while tracing her finger lightly over her pen. “Those are lovely things to say about each other. It’s already clear that whatever has brought you into my office, it’s not a lack of attraction.” She leans forward slightly and makes eye contact with each in turn. “Could you share what
“In a way yes. When it is completely unexpected, I still jerk away and feel the touch long after it is gone, but it isn’t
Cas laughed and straddled his lap. “I haven’t touched anyone else since we met. No one else will do.” He kissed him and pulled away. “I want all that too, Dean. I want to be yours.”
“Nerds? Maybe this guy, but me? Pfft.” Dean threw a hand playfully and moved on. “Yeah, we’re ready. Bringing the beer pong table? Because you probably shouldn’t… unless you want me to kick your ass again, Seven.”
“You do. And you better worship this ass every day.” Cas grinned and laid back, pulling Dean down with him.
They have a few more hours with him before he begins to stiffen and it’s time to say goodbye to the most stunning shell ever created.
Cas nodded and spit out the window, “Good.” He pushed in Dean’s cassette tape so they could hear some music as they drove out of town.
When Dean and Sam met up at the roadhouse for lunch, Sam could tell something was up. “What is it? You’re smiling more than usual.”
“Not really. Not clicking with anyone, these cups mean something and I have no damn clue what it is. You gonna help me out?” Dean looked at Cas’ face, searching for answers.
Dean shifts a little uncomfortably. “I can go with you. Just... sit somewhere else?” That would be breaking his own rule about not being seen more than necessary, but he didn’t entirely want to be away from Cas either.
“Tomorrow,” Cas agrees, planting his feet and pulling Dean down as he thrusts up. “You have a free pass today.” He wraps a hand around Dean’s cock and sends a grace pulse through it, smirking when it makes Dean jerk.
when Dean was buried deep inside him, placing soft kisses and nips to the nape of his neck. It was a stark contrast to the violent nature of the actual sex, but it was exactly what Cas needed.
Dean licked his lips and leaned in, ungracefully pulling Cas’ dick into his mouth with his tongue as he added a second finger. It was mainly to stop himself from saying something stupid, but Cas could take it however he wanted to. He sucked slowly as he pumped his fingers.
“And then we figure it out. No one expects you to have answers right now, Dean. You can stay here forever.” He looks around his small open living space and shrugs. “Or until you’re sick of me... and having no privacy whatsoever.”
- the control this was about to bring him. He didn’t care if Cas gave up that control willingly or not. He climbed up onto the bed with the rope between his teeth and handcuffed Cas’ wrists together behind his back. He laid Cas down, fashioning a type of noose around his neck and securing it to the headboard. With anyone else, he’d have continued without a word. But this was Cas, and
Dean grinned behind Cas and wrapped his large, calloused hand around Cas’ wrists. He leaned forward a bit throwing his weight into the grip. “Can you move?” He slid three fingers back into Cas just to make him squirm.
“Come on, Cas. I can take it.” Dean pushed back again with a growl of his own. It took everything to let it go and settle for a quick slap on the ass, but Cas could instantly tell Dean loved it.
friend! You don’t even know anything about him! He has issues.” By Cas’ face, he heard that, and then he slowly slid off Dean and went to the bathroom.
Cas pulled him back down and gripped his hips, rutting up against him and sighing in relief. Dean moaned as he dropped his forehead to the crook of Cas’ neck; he’d been so lost in his attempt to map out Cas’ curves and jagged edges that he hadn’t even noticed he was rock fucking hard. The head of Cas’ cock slid up and down his shaft and it nearly punched the breath from his lungs. There was something so unbelievably erotic about it that if he
“That one,” Dean said as he pointed to a tan and white guinea pig. The little thing was in a cage with two others, and was trying to hump the
Tossing his head back with an obnoxious cackle, Dean pulls him back in and presses their foreheads together. “Course you are. I love how possessive you are of me.”
Dean brushed his fingers over Cas’ prostate and laughed quietly. “Just because you said that, I think I’m gonna make you come first and
Cas honestly isn’t sure how he feels about the admission. It doesn’t necessarily complicate things, Dean can enjoy whatever he chooses to enjoy and it doesn’t have to change anything between them — but Cas knows himself. He knows how desperately he wants... “Yes, that’s what you said,” he states, just to interrupt his own thoughts. “I suppose that makes two of us, hm? What... kind, exactly?”
Nick pulled Cas away, against his wishes before he could talk again. He was interested in this Winchester man but Nick was adamant he kept his mouth shut. Any time Cas walked close to Dean, Nick was there to pull him away.
Dean flushes adorably as he makes his way to his phone to turn off the music. “Uh... This is exactly what it looks like.”
Sliding out was a travesty. “Yes, the sooner the better.” Cas tied off the condom and looked around awkwardly for the trash can, locating it quickly and disposing of it. “Are you alright?”
was love. It definitely wasn’t what love looked like in movies. But Cas... he’s never seen that in real life. So, this is what it had to be... at least for them. And that was okay. He reached out and gripped Dean’s throat, forcing him to make eye contact again. “And yours is
Dean opened his eyes. “No, Cas. It makes you a guy that was shunned by his entire fucking family simply for likin’ dick. It’s actually kinda textbook that you get off on the idea of someone actually giving a damn about you.”
Dean glanced around the coffee shop and scratched his head. “So um... I’m not 100% straight... I’m not
Dean threw his head back and laughed as he went around to the drivers side of his car. “I beg to fuckin’ differ, angel. Don’t sell yourself short, I think you can handle a
Dean didn’t answer. He pulled up Cas’ Spotify and searched for his ‘Dean’s Top Seger Traxx’ playlist, then slid it back over. “I’ll read your book, you listen to that. Deal?”
outta her bluff. “Yeah, alright. Fuck it. Why not? You want him to suck me off, by all means, at least
Cas considered texting Dean again but left it alone. He just wanted to get home. Waking up in a stranger’s bed was always the worst, he never slept well and was always disappointed in himself for not having his shit together enough to make it home, or at least to Meg’s. Now he has to make his exit awkwardly as the dude tries to make him breakfast.
who has taken the life of so many people before him, touched him so softly it was easy to believe he was harmless.
“Cas.” Nick approached him, holding a hand to Sam to give him a moment. He was the only one that could reason with Cas once he was angry.
“The same. Where are your hands?” Dean felt his cheeks burn up, and considered lying but again, decided to go with honesty.
Cas cut the words off with a passionate kiss, and Dean immediately opened for him. He would have been content to fuck Cas - or hell, they’d started switching a while ago, he’d let Cas fuck
“Fuck,” Dean gasped, tightening his grip. He was way too damn close already and part of him wasn’t ready for it to be over, especially if Cas wasn’t there yet.
Cas nodded quickly, “So fucking full, baby.” He moaned around Dean’s thumb, using all his willpower to stay still.
Cas frowned. “So we’ll be apart?” The thought made him nervous. “What do I do if he makes a move?” He asked, genuinely curious.
The rest of the week was more of the same. Classes, annoying jocks, homework, repeat. Cas couldn’t wait for after high school. That would be when the fun really began… he hoped.
fallen for Cas. He couldn’t deny it anymore, not that he even had the strength to. Once again, Dean was alone. He walked over to Cas’ bed and climbed inside, smiling sadly, surrounded by Cas’ scent.
“Nah... take your time with me, sweetheart. Own me in those fucking panties.” Dean lays on his back, spreading his legs further.
Cas nodded, knowing there was no way in hell he was going to win, so Dean’s end of the bet didn’t matter. What
Cas sat back disappointed. Why was he still soft? Cas was about to bust out of his jeans... didn’t punching that guy do
“Can I have your number Cas? This would be easier if I didn’t have to hunt you down every time a business emailed back. I can help you get started, and no I’m not asking for anything in return.” Dean tried to sound as professional as possible.
He rocked forward slowly, stretching him out further and smirking at the way Dean’s ass was trying to hold him in. Cas pulled out completely just to tease him, smacking his cock against Dean’s perfect, puckered hole and shoving back in, groaning at the added friction from those panties. “Do you think you can come on my cock? You ruining that satin…” he trailed off with a grunt, digging his nails into Dean’s hips and slamming into him.
He grunts, trying not to, but every inch of him wants to obey Dean. “Please,” he whispers. “Please, Dean… I need you.”
Dean was momentarily caught off guard by the stir in his jeans. He blamed it on the eyes, there was a fire in those eyes that he couldn’t fucking
A few hours - and drinks - later, Cas was already annoyed with the damn football team. “Ugh, the jocks are drunk.” Cas groaned, glancing over by the beer pong table.
There were a lot of nipples in that room, every single one of them attached to very naked, moaning, writhing men. He’d walked into a fucking gay orgy, and he took a couple of steps backward to double-check the house number. Nope, this was definitely the right place. He cleared his throat, apparently invisible to the five - no, six - guys going at it like fucking jackrabbits. Dean’s body flushed under his clothes. He definitely wasn’t a stranger to kinky sex, but this? This was new.
“I’m not complaining. I get to actually wash my hands this time.” He walked over to Dean’s master bathroom and washed his hands. “Now that the cat’s out, you disappointed?” He walked back and shoved that hand towel in a backpack.
Dean did to him. He made sure to stay still, and let Dean move his hands however he wanted, closing his eyes and releasing
“Oh. Shit. Fuck. Yes.” Cas was already a mess, crumbling under Dean’s touch and when Dean gripped his hair he thought he would come. He always eventually regretted the lack of lube, but in the moment, he fucking
He’d be lying if he said the compliment didn’t send butterflies scattering in his stomach. “Okay. We’re picking what happens if we lose, not if we win. It’s much fairer that way. So, if you win, I have to confess something.”
It was actually a little hard not to just keep going. But, we hope you enjoyed this double-installment of our little quarantine orgy - or, as Celi would say, our "fuck fest to fluff fest". See you Tuesday, we're officially halfway through!
He can feel Dean is close when his hips begin to stutter. He moans Cas’ name over and over like a prayer and then slams inside, filling him up with the sexiest grunt Cas has ever heard.
Dean set the lantern down near the cross and let go of the bag, turning to face him with a confused expression. “You were
“Jesus Christ, Car…” He shuddered, making a grossed out noise and texting her back that he wasn’t nervous and she should probably get that checked out by a doctor, or maybe a detective or something. He tossed his phone down on the couch and unlocked the door, knowing Cas would be there any minute.
“I’m surprised you haven’t ran for the hills ye— ah!” Dean jerks hard when Cas nips his hip. “Fuck, I love everything you do with that mouth.”
Dean growled, a low and possessive sound. “You knew I would. I told you I would.” His hands clutched tight to Cas’ hip bones and urged him to move a little faster. “Is it fucked up I’d rather watch someone fuck you than kiss you?”
She leaned in and kissed him just as a long tongue licked up his shaft, slowly twirling around the head. He paused again, and Dean could feel Carmen shift as though she was watching Cas lick his cock.
Dean’s mind was reeling, this guy had gotten under his skin with all the sexual favor bullshit and he really worried about what was going on with his fellow officers so he sent Sam a quick text to see if he was available. Dean had questions.
“I just want to help.” Dean got out of the car before Nick could say anything else and made his way to the door. Nick followed suit.
David froze completely other than the uncontrollable shaking of his body. He was sobbing quietly, saying
the seconds it took to free him from the fucking green lace wrapped neatly around his cock. He dropped fully to his knees for the first time in his life, his kneecaps clacking in delicious pain against the concrete below him. His eyes traveled hungrily up Cas’ body until they locked on those ocean blue pools of promise, and took Cas’ cock in his mouth.
Dean comes with a sinful moan, his legs shaking from the release, and the look on Cas’ face as his come coats his cock is absolutely priceless. But none of it compares to the sound of Cas jacking off with his come. Between the wet, smacking sound and those delicious whimpers, it might just be the best thing Dean’s ever heard. “Fuck,” Cas breathes, fucking into his fist. “Feels so good, Dean... your come feels so fucking good.”
Dean let out a chuckle, still unable to look away. “Oh yeah? Bet I can beat you, your posture is all wrong.” He chugged the rest of his drink and set it aside, fighting off the gag. “Want some help with that?”
Dean’s eyes widened and Cas blushed furiously. “Go away... it’s my birthday!” he joked, and kissed Cas one more time before climbing off the bed. “Cole interrupts everything.”
All Dean could do was moan. Every inch of his body was awake and focused entirely on Cas, and he felt like if he didn’t get more of him soon, he’d fucking explode. He lifted his hips a little and rolled them in a circle, bringing his hands over top of his head to grip the pillow. “Yeah. Yep. Yes, fucking want you.”
Cas froze and turned back toward Dean with a curious look on his face. He hesitated, but ultimately walked back over and stopped inches from Dean. “Yes?” He cocked his head.
“Gross.” Cole teased and shoved at Dean. “Why are you slummin’ it with this mediocre wide receiver, Novak?”
He stopped stroking himself a while to browse the internet and learn about sexualities, but his dick was still hard; it was not going to let up until he finally got some release. Before he knew it, he was watching porn. Gay porn.
Dean cut him off, “No idiot, I’m asking for your safety. It’s late, you’re intoxicated and not near your house. Let me take you home.” Dean put his arm behind Cas to lead him to the car.
“I did.” He kissed him again, hoping Dean couldn’t sense how nervous he actually was. “I just can’t stay away. Is that okay?”
Cas looked up from his hands and once again met his gaze. Dean was completely unreal. His eyes were an indescribable green, and Cas didn’t miss the way beautiful freckles were peppered across his nose and cheeks. His lips looked so soft, Cas pictured them around his cock with Dean bound on his knees and he had to shoot back his drink to push that painful visual from his mind.
before, and make sure your skin doesn’t touch anything else until we’re outta here.” He followed his own instructions and then went over to strip the bed, balling the come-stained sheets up.
Dean spoke up to the group, "Be careful of needles, please. I'll be in charge today, I'm Officer Winchester. Officer Jones is off today.”
“Nah,” he says. “It’s fine. Don’t need my head today.” It’s a joke, but it helps Cas’ conscience, and when they lock eyes for the first time, Castiel is lost in a sea of green.
The pressure feels amazing, and Cas starts using both hands to fit them better. “So don’t use your imagination anymore. I’m always around... always want it.”
The answer to that question was... complicated. On one hand, yes - it reminded Dean of all the ways he’d wanted to break Castiel when they’d met. But
Dean tugged the sheet over himself and rubbed his eyes. “Look, I know you don’t wanna hear this, but I know him better than you think I do. This ain’t even about Cas, Carmen. Our relationship wasn’t workin’ out either way, I just don’t get why you all of a sudden give a shit.”
should have at least let Benny clarify that comment he’d made about horny men, because when he parked his car and opened the front door with the spare key, his suitcase
He approached the tiny librarian and half smiled at her, relaxing his body language and leaning on the counter in a fake show of comfortability. If you acted like you belonged somewhere, chances were good people would believe you. The librarian seemed to believe him at any rate and she handed over the login for one of the computers in the corner. He sat down and was suddenly nervous.
“He’s... handsome.” Dean’s voice was small, he wasn't used to talking to his dad this way, not about dudes.
Cas clasped his shoulder and stared into his eyes again. “Until next time, David.” And then he walked out the door, knowing Dean would follow soon.
it or hated it, but the thoughts didn’t have long to battle in his head before Cas was sucking him off like a goddamned pornstar. Dean’s voice was wrecked from moaning and grunting so much already but he rasped out Cas’ name as his body convulsed. His toes curled and his knees bent of their own volition... he was beginning to think that in the small act of conceding control of the sex to Cas, he’d flat out
Dean grinned, a different kind of intensity in his eyes. “Put your damn pants back on and lets get the fuck outta here.”
“Well, like you said. Men can’t really fake it.” He digs his nails gently into the back of Dean’s neck and dismisses how close they are.
Castiel was asleep before the end of the second movie and Dean realized he’d much rather be watching Cas sleep anyway.
blowjob quickly escalated. Dean had previously never had the opportunity to frott before - condoms made it nearly impossible - but since Dean had recently been tested, they decided to try it and if they both came in less than two minutes, that was their business.
“Yeah. Sorry she slapped you. Was it right here?” He kissed his cheekbone. “Or right here?” He kissed his jaw.
His confused expression only got worse. “What, like... gave someone else control? During sex?” He scoffed and tried to lie, but the words came out sarcastic sounding at best. “Of course I have.”
“Dean?!” Charlie runs out from her room, instantly dropping to the floor in front of him. Charlie never judged him for breaking down, but he rarely lost this much control.
can break me?” He smiled and sat up straighter, their eyes still locked. “No one could break me, handsome. How can you break something that was never fully together?”
“Would be a boring party then, wouldn’t it?” Cas asks breathlessly. “No, I want you to fuck me and send me back out there to play games filled with your come.”
“Yes, we did. She decided I wasn’t really her type, and I wasn’t exactly upset about it.” Cas picked at a cupcake to distract himself, breaking off tiny pieces and chewing slowly. “I’m not exactly a stranger to being single.”
"Besides the fact I’m gonna take a picture of it and post it everywhere I can? Nah. I just wanna help. Sam calls it my hero complex.” Dean smiled.
“You’re askin’ an awful lot, angel.” Dean curled his fingers into the sheet above his head and the muscles in his entire body went taut.
Charlie cleared her throat and made some awkward exit to the bedroom, but they hardly glanced her way.
Dean just chuckled, not really taking him seriously. A convict with anger and arrogance issues wasn't really on his radar…
“It’s okay, Dean. You don’t have to say it back, there’s no rush or anything. But one of the things I’ve been working on is how to effectively communicate what I
Wednesday rolled around and Dean was getting impatient, he was having a lot less fun fucking Carmen now and was looking forward to Sundays in a way he never did outside of football season. But as luck would have it, nothing ever seemed to go in Dean's favor, and Carmen told him that Cas wasn't gonna be able to make it that week. He tried to pay it off like it wasn't a big deal, but the disappointment washed over him and he bummed around the rest of the day.
Dean was an expert at seeing without really looking and when a dark haired man with a leather jacket walks in by themselves, you pay attention. He spent some time flirting with his drink, letting his eyes wander aimlessly but never quite landing on the man. He waited to see if anyone joined him, but they didn’t. He didn’t want to let his hopes get too high so early, he was going to need to remind himself to keep his normal pace. Catch and release a couple of times; learn his habits and his story before he could pounce. Chances were good he’d find something that made him an invalid candidate in the first five minutes, but hell. He’d be lying to himself if he said he didn’t want to see how bad this one squirmed while getting fucked dry and then hung up on meathooks by his fucking shoulderblades. He looked like a
When he heard the click of the front door, he felt butterflies in his gut like a damn Taylor Swift song.
Meg knew it was either Nick or Dean pounding on her door but she was shocked to see both, “Wow, this is a shocker. Let me guess, you want me to give up Cas?”
He backed up and bumped the wall. “Oops. I’ll just…” He pointed to walk away, but Charlie grabbed his arm with a worried expression.
He offers Cas an apologetic smile when he finishes chugging all the beer, and then makes his way over to make it up to him. “Are you mad at me? Cause if you are, I’ll have to fix it… right now in the bathroom.”
The guy clears his throat and stands up as he shakes Dean’s hand, and Dean’s surprised yet again at how strong his grip is. “I'm Castiel, but most people just call me Cas.”
“Good.” Dean pushes in two fingers and moans, a pleased look overtaking his features, but it ends almost as quickly as it begins and he’s moving to hover over him. Dean strokes, slicking his long, thick cock and then nudging at Cas’ hole. “I didn’t hear a please… c’mon, Castiel. Let me hear you beg.”
"You are creepy," Cas says with a grin. "But you're gorgeous enough that most of us just ignore it."
him. He slid bloody hands slowly up Cas’ jeans and nipped his teeth playfully over the bulge. “You’re just like me, angel. That’s why. You’re mine, and you’re just like me.” He took his time unbuttoning Cas’ jeans and sliding them down. He
“Would do anything for you, though.” He slid his finger in further and began working him open. “Doing okay there, handsome?”
Cas would have loved to stay asleep but mother nature had other plans. He rolled over with a groan, already feeling the soreness in his ass as he sat up and went to use the bathroom.
Cas growled and pushed Dean off of him with a strength that surprised them both and flipped their bodies so Cas was straddling Dean’s lap. “Gonna come all over your fucking chest, don’t move.” Cas leaned forward and set a hand on Dean’s neck while the other stroked himself hard and fast.
Dean was incredibly uncomfortable with being the one tied up, but he crossed a lot of lines he shouldn’t have with Cas and understood on some level that there needed to be compromise. He nodded hesitantly. “How are you gonna get off?”
A wave of calm spread over Dean. They were safely in the soundproof room, and this man just proved to him he deserved to die. This would be the first time in his life he ever killed someone that truly deserved it, and it filled him with a sense of righteousness he didn’t know was possible. “Actually,
He waited several minutes and eventually went to go get Cas. He stepped behind him and turned him slowly, trying not to make any sudden movements. He leaned in and pressed a kiss to his forehead and then led him back to bed, crawling in with him and opening his arms in an invitation. “Come here, Cas. Please.”
what he just said before. Cas slowly leaned forward and took a chance. “I’d like to watch that too.” He sat back again and finally took a bite of his burger.
They talk for days, have some more dates that end with amazing sex and when the sun begins to set three weeks after they met, Cas asks Dean to come stay the night. He misses him already and when Dean agrees Cas rushes to the kitchen to bake him a pie.
Jask trips as Dean drives him back a little too far and knocks over one of the dining room chairs trying to catch himself, and by that point, they're laughing too hard to do much of anything — but when the theme song starts over, Jask lets out a battle cry and charges again.
“Uh, sorry Chuckles. Talk later!” Dean rushed out of her apartment without listening for a response.
“I’ll be right back, just gotta find someone sober enough to drive. Because I’m like three Skittles too drunk to drive.” He winked and wandered off.
Shaking those thoughts from his mind, Dean stood them up to search them, Cas’ stash was in the backpack so as long as that wasn’t found he was fine. “Come on. I’m taking you both in." He grabbed their arms and hoisted them towards the car, tossing them in the back.
Charlie came up behind him, blowing one of those annoying party favors in his ear. The papery material hit him in the side of the head and he turned to swat it away, laughing. “You’re an assbutt.”
The noise Cas lets out sounds a lot more like a whimper than anything else, and when he kisses him again, it feels a lot different than normal. It’s slow, passionate, deep... a mix of all the things their kisses usually aren’t.
He shrugged a little, biting into his breakfast sandwich. “You’re fucking grumpy when you first wake up. Didn’t wanna deal with it.”
It took awhile for Dean to get Cas off the bathroom floor. They lost count of how many times he had puked, and Dean was happy to finally get some water in him. He led Cas to the couch and got him set up with a blanket and a bucket, turning on the TV so they could finish their Avengers marathon.
He twitched, pulsing and leaking into Cas’ expert mouth, no longer even trying to deny how much the whole scenario turned him on. “Heard you like how I taste, Cas. Gonna get off on it again?”
It took everything for Cas to swallow this man’s nasty seed. He wanted nothing more than to spit it out or puke all over his shoes but he grabbed Cas’ head and slammed his disgusting cock into Cas’ throat when he came and didn’t move him until he was finished.
“No complaints here. Feels kinda good to hear, actually.” Dean puts an arm around him and licks his lips. “Most people think I’m annoying, but... you’ll get used to my singing and shit.”
All Cas could do was groan, no words were worthy in this moment of bliss. He rode Dean like it was their last time because
The moment they're safely behind a closed door, Cas fists his hands at the bottom of Dean’s shirt and pulls it off. His eyes hungrily roam the lines of that gorgeous body, and he drops to his knees to kiss over the flushed skin. “Once isn't going to be enough, you know that, right?”
“Up the stairs, second door to your left. Sofa pulls out, unlike me.” Benny grabbed the angel again and yanked him back down, and just like that… Dean was forgotten.
Dean smiled, just a small thing that smoothed out some of his rougher edges but did nothing to sugarcoat the underlying darkness. “You just can’t get enough, can you.”
“No actually, the burgers were your idea, I’m too full to walk now. You’re driving.” Nick began enjoying his pie.
“You’re disgusting. But seriously, if you don’t click with anyone by midnight, we’ll leave. Deal?” She didn’t want to, but Dean being comfortable was more important.
Dean cuffed both of them before pulling Cas’ beanie off and tugging the bandana off his face, Dean’s breath caught in his throat. He'd never been attracted to the whole
Dean’s eyes danced with dark promise as he fixed his gaze on Cas and stepped forward. “Then I suppose I won’t get convicted, now will I?” He raised his hand to the back of Cas’ head and slowly curled his fingers around the mess of onyx locks. He tugged backward, hard but not brutal, and leaned in to kiss him. He started slow, marking the way he tasted before the fear set in. His thumb slid through Castiel’s belt loop and he yanked his hips forward toward himself, trapping him in a kiss that quickly turned possessive.
Dean let out a breathless chuckle and pressed a quick kiss to Cas’ temple. “Another 5 minutes and I mighta turned into a
“Let’s just pop these and see where they take us?” Balt said, handing Cas two Oxy as they walked out the door.
Cas moved and barely had an inch. “Fuck, no... I can’t move much. You gonna keep talking or fuck me now?” Cas was happy Dean couldn’t see his grin. He knew Dean didn’t want a brat, but Cas needed Dean to be
Dean gently bites Cas’ nipple with a satisfied hum, and Cas isn’t sure if he imagines the “good boy” that follows or if it really happened — but the insistent twitch of his cock is real enough as Dean slowly eases into him. “Fuck, you’re tight,” Dean moans, and all Cas gets out is a whimpered little noise that he’d be embarrassed about if this didn’t feel so good.
Jesse stepped into Cas’ face as he turned and kissed him, but Cas instantly backed away. “Hey man, I have a boyfriend. I was just being a friend.” He felt as though he just betrayed Dean. No one was allowed to kiss him but Dean.
across the parking lot before climbing into Baby and taking a moment to listen to her purr. He doesn’t look at his texts until he parks in his driveway
“Yup.” Dean shimmies around Cas and heads for the stairs. “Wanna order pizza tonight, or did you get full from all that come?”
“Mmmmm.” Cas hummed as he slid Dean down his throat, loving how he had to contract around his thick cock. Hearing Dean say that had him stroking himself faster.
how to tell his angel to come - he brought his free hand up and squeezed Cas’ neck, his eyes flashing.
“Just shut up and wait for the public defender.” Nick whispered and Cas rolled his eyes. “We’ll talk to the lawyer.” Nick said to end the matter.
Nick leaned over his shoulder and hummed. “How many shades of green do you need? I think the other colors feel left out.”
Castiel on the other hand, isn’t thinking about the kiss. It’s on his mind, somewhere in there, but right now, all he felt was
Jack turns up his head, frowning and looking into the distance before speaking. “There are no universes in which you and someone named Sarah Michelle Geller are a romantic couple.”
The keys to his cage were still suspended in a block of ice in his freezer. He was trapped in the cock cage indefinitely until he could get Crowley to hand over the key.
Upon reaching his floor however, Dean is confronted not with his still ajar door, nor even what he’d thought was a worst case scenario of it being locked and having to find a way to call his brother for the spare key, but a box of his belongings outside his door.
“The other three weren’t enough?” Dean asks, but he’s smirking and walking off with an arm around Jack’s shoulders.
“Hello Sam,” Castiel says as he walks in from the other room. He has matching nail polish to Dean’s on his fingers.
Eventually Crowley took pity on him and shut the plug down plug off, Dean sighing.  Finally, Dean stared down at the contents of the box to see what precious little Crowley had allowed him to keep from his belongings. The massive dildo was still there, as were his other plastic cages, a collar, a pup hood he’d not gotten to use, a handful of panties in various fabrics and styles such as a jockstrap, a few of his other dildos, a half used bottle of lube, one bottle of poppers, two very niche and very expensive imported fetish magazines, a Hot Wheel Impala, and the sole photo album he kept of his brother and him.
Dean glances down at his fingernails, having gotten used to it and not even really thinking about it anymore. “Uh, Oil,” Dean says, shoving his hands in his pockets, feeling that intense need to hide, to deflect, to cower and beat himself up with shame.
Sam puts up his hands “hey, I wasn’t saying it was bad. Just, not something I’d have ever expected form you Dean.”
When Sam returns a few days later from seeing Eileen his eyes almost immediately zero in on the cracked and partly faded nail polish on Dean’s fingers.
“I know you have plenty of experience with begging Winchester, usually on your knees, but I cannot be swayed with some puppy dog eyes and offers of blowjobs. At least not from you, and not when you owe me that much money.” Crowley’s footsteps could be heard as he walked deeper into Dean’s now former apartment, leaving him alone with his thoughts and the buzzing against his prostate.
In his sleep addled state he shoots out of bed, moving on instinct and bone deep trauma to speed out his apartment door and down the many fights of stairs. It’s only as he stops in the lobby, eyes fully opening and looking around, that he has time to catch his breathe and realize why he feels so strange. It isn’t that he’s still barely awake, no, the reason seems to be that he’s incredibly cold. And that’s when he looks down and remembers that he’d went to bed in his normal sleepwear for the last month and a half; lacy panties, a thick butt plug, and his cock cage.
Dean resisted the urge to kick the door once more, then resisted the urge to cry because he didn’t do that, even if the situation was bad enough to call for it. He started to walk slowly, defeated, towards the back stairs to at least mitigate some of the damage of being seen going down the main steps when a door opened to his right.
“Oh, well...” Jack squeezes his fingers in his opposite palm, looking away then back at Dean. “I was wondering… Would you teach me how to bake a pie?”
Everyone in the room looks at one another before Claire says “well, I guess that makes 48 now,” and they all crack up.
“Just get ‘em all,” Dean says, patting Jack on the shoulder and leading him up to the counter. It’s only then he realizes he’s a 40 year old man, with what seems to be another young man, buying 4 bottles of nail polish. His cheeks heat, but he keeps a determined dour, stoic expression as they hand their purchases to the girl at the counter.
Jack smiles beatifically. “Of course, I’m god, I had to rebuild all the other worlds Chuck destroyed. I keep tabs on them a bit, but not much.” He pauses for a moment and then chuckles. “Sorry, I forgot one. You are also with Dean in one universe.”
“I...” Dean pauses, taking a moment to have a small internal war over whether this would damage his masculinity irreparably, but in the end he decides fuck it, this can’t be any worse than when he wore those panties, and he liked that. He’s pretty sure this is just going to be annoying.
“Jack, that’s nail polish,” he says, looking at the perfectly manicured nails of some woman on YouTube.
Dean looks up from where he’s sitting in a comfy chair, you could almost think he was relaxed if it wasn’t for the book in his hand being so old and dusty that he’d only be reading it for research.
When they get to the local CVS Dean searches for about ten minutes before he figures out where the nail polish is. “Whoa,” he says as they stand in front of the giant wall of makeup.
Jack picks up three different bottles, going through them one by one. One is a shiny purple, another is a matte yellow, and finally a white color. “I can’t decide Dean.”
Dean is in the middle of a very nice dream where his ex boyfriend Benny is fucking the living daylights out of him when the fire alarm wakes him.
Jack then rattles off a list of women that Charlie’s of other worlds have dated or are currently with.
Charlie straight up cackles at that and Dean blushes even deeper red. Then Charlie’s smile turns devious. “Wait, Jack you can see who everyone has ended up with in every permutation of the worlds?”
Okay, so yes he’d seen the “rent is due, now!!!” signs on his door, and slipped under his door, and in the mail. He was going to get to it, but business had been slow lately and he’d needed the cash for other things. Other things like the humongous depth training dildo he’d bought in a horny tailspin and was now sitting at the top of the box of his things, jutting out for anyone to see. Dean scrambled to try to grab the box and get inside, but the door was locked from within and he heard someone moving beyond it.
“Where am I?” Benny says, before he looks over and sees Dean. “Dean? Brotha!” he smiles, his eyes lighting up and in the flash of an eye Dean’s chair is overturned and he’s colliding with Benny so hard they both almost fall over. “Hey, hey, what’s all this then cher?”
Dean coughs and nudges Jack and the boy stops and smiles. Shaking his head Dean looks over at the girl, feeling his face heated with embarrassment, but the judgment he expects to see in her face isn’t there. Instead, she’s smiling in the softest way.
He nods and kisses across his hips, sucking a dark mark before he moves lower. “Yeah... I’m sure, Cas. I wanna try. Will you guide me?”
Cas didn’t respond, he just got out of the car and walked in, nodded at the waiter he’d fucked a few times and sat in a booth. He knew it wasn’t a date, he always sat there. “Bacon cheeseburger for me and a double for a... friend.” He didn’t even wait for Dean to come in and sit, he already knew what he wanted so he ordered it for him. “Wait, some water too.”
Cas tilts his head, pretending to think about it. Truthfully, he's told him that at least twice already today, and about a million times since their first appointment with Cordelia. They've seen her so often over the last two years that she's earned herself a permanent place in their lives, whether or not they ever need couples therapy again. “Um… I don't know. Have you?”
“I was hoping it wouldn’t be.” Cas grinds back, distracting him for a moment. “At least we get to keep the dildo. It feels good in my throat.”
Dean's eyes flashed with momentary panic at the implication, and then he pulled Castiel into a kiss. His hands slid inside of the leather jacket Cas was wearing and slowly worked their way around until he was nearly lifting Cas off of his feet, claiming his mouth the way he'd once claimed
Dean threw his head back and laughed. “Even better. I’ll take her.” He received an awkward nod in response and a few minutes later, Dean was holding a plastic ball with an animal inside of it and staring at his passenger seat.
“Yes.” There was no hesitation in Dean’s voice, no wavering or room for discussion in his gaze. “I will.”
“Well, next time my house burns down I’ll try and give you a heads up.” Dean nudges him with a smirk and Cas shoves him harder.
The latex snaps as it forms around Jask's long length, and Dean gallic shrugs at that admission. “Fair.” He rolls it on and then wipes his hands off, queuing up the
“My cock is definitely on board with that.” Dean clenched the base again, trying to keep some level of control over his thoughts so they could talk.
“I got it.” Dean made his way over and grabbed their oversized mugs. “Thanks.” He walked back slower than he needed to, but with each passing second, his butterflies had more and more friggin babies.
Cas fucking nipped his hip and pulled away, back to that predatory stance above Dean. “Are you sure you want me to wait?”
with a grin on his face. “You know I have a middle name right?” He continued to carve and then lifted the bloody tip of the knife to his tongue. “But I’m just doing first and last like you did.” He started working on the
Cas’ leg shook irritably as he stared down at the paperwork. “Fuck!” He stood up, shoving the chair away.
“We should,” Cas agrees, and before he can stop himself, he moves his hands and leans down to kiss Dean.
Anything, really. He’d always been vocal during sex but wasn’t sure if Cas even wanted to hear his voice at all. Dean undid his pants quickly, shoving them down to the middle of his thick thighs and moving behind Cas. He took a moment to run a hand over the plug splitting Cas’ cheeks as he stroked himself, hardening quickly.
The cop leaned down to look in the car, shining his flashlight in each of their faces and then the backseat despite the fact that it was still daylight.
Dean’s answering laugh was dark and full of promise. He stretched his fingers further around the sides of Cas’ throat and squeezed a little harder. “Or, you could start with your name. If you want me to bend you over and split your used up little ass in half, I will... but you’re going to work for it. Entertain me first.” He released his neck and sat down, wiggling two fingers at the bartender without taking his predatory gaze off of Castiel.
It kind of sucks to know they’d really have issues before they ever even attempted to begin, but he isn’t surprised. No relationships have worked out thus far, go figure this one wouldn’t either.
Having Dean’s mouth on him is incredible. He ruts up, desperate to come, but all sensation ceases before he can. Cas’ eyes snap open to see Dean smiling up at him like the biggest asshole on the planet.
Sam nodded and spent the next half hour having them sign papers and scribble out confessions, "We can just squeeze you in with a judge before today ends. I’ll be back when they are ready.” Sam walked out.
His lumbering giant of a best friend is stripping before he even gets the full words out, then staring down at his flaccid cock and laughing. “Uh… Yeah, don't judge me.” Jask starts stroking, his eyes squeezed shut like he's trying to forget Dean is right there.
It was the thought of Cas going down for this that made Dean finally move. His body felt sluggish as he rose off of Jesse’s lifeless form, and he was
Dean’s eyes widened and he swallowed his candy. “Fucking same for the exact same reason. Don’t want none of that responsibility. I don’t even wanna be team captain.”
Dean nodded, grateful he’d just gotten off not a half an hour ago or else it’d be painfully clear to everyone in that diner just how much the fear in peoples’ eyes turned him on. “He asked a stupid question, I gave him an answer. Don’t think he was very happy about it.” He pulled his glass of water to his lips and took a slow sip, his eyes locking onto his angel’s.
“Dean... you fill me so fucking good.” He clenched and had to remind himself to breathe. “Your dick was made for this ass. Fuck me like you missed me.” Cas braced against the door and tossed his head back.
Seriously, feel.” Cas reached out and took Dean’s hand, bringing it to the bare skin of Cas’ stomach. “So, yes. It makes me want to be
“Mmng,” Cas moans, grinding his face against Dean’s crotch before pulling back up and sucking hard. He wants it so fucking bad it’s clear as day, and it sends Dean over with a choked-out sob. He watches Cas swallow and suck the come out of his body with his mouth completely slack.
By the time Dean spoke, Cas’ cock was rock hard. Watching his devil punch someone in the face had him so turned on he wanted Dean to fuck him right here against the wall.
Cas had already taken this woman’s loose dollars but he was entertaining her anyway, seeing as she just got him a drink. He kept glancing at Dean and the woman even commented on ‘that man’ being too handsome to be such a sloppy drunk. Cas laughed it off, knowing damn well Dean was sober. But he
Cas snorted and took a sip of his shake as he settled down at his desk. “Yes, and now I can rest easy. You’re decidedly
Dean hummed and grinned proudly. “Goddamn right I would.” He tilted his head, watching his angel. “Wonder what
Dean’s hands snaked around Cas’ waist and his eyes drifted to the photo. “Do you know how many people died because of that picture? How many times I tried to recreate that without you, and how many times I failed?”
Dean stayed propped up on his arms for a moment, but as he melted into that kiss, he laid back fully and ran his hands through Cas’ hair.
what Cas knew he would offer. “I know a place, just make a left here.” Cas led him to the warehouse and Dean wasn’t there yet so they went inside.
“Glad you both made the game. Hey, Cas.” He let them go and checked out their school pride outfits. He’d honestly never seen Cas in color.
Blood oozed into Castiel’s mouth and he sat back up, bouncing on Dean’s cock with his blood dripping down his chin.
ready?” Dean teased, knowing damn well Cole was always ready for alcohol. He ruffled the running back’s short hair and earned himself a shove.
That was what it finally took for him to realize he spent the entirety of the night nearly crying over a fuck. It was
“Oh.” Nick actually looked sad for him and it made Cas feel even worse about it. “Well… When you do, we’d love to meet them.”
Turned out that the project was much harder than anticipated. Dean was never known for having a gentle hand, and when it came to measuring shit for science, he was horrible. Cas had the softest hands he’d ever felt - not that he was paying attention to that - and he measured the liquids like a pro.
An uncomfortable laugh worked its way out of Dean. “Yeah, I can imagine.” He rolled over onto his stomach, sliding his arms under the pillow. “We’re good though, right?”
Dean uses his left hand to fish around for it and squirts some over the head of his cock, letting it drip down to the base before he strokes it and hands Cas the bottle.
This powerful, dominant man gave Cas some of the control back, making him grin and feel more in his element.
Dean actually feels bad. Yeah, he’s never hurt Cas personally, but he’s sure his exes probably had this exact complaint about him. Do they feel like they disappointed him, too? “You don’t, Cas.”
an angel, sent to undo him. His finger clicked the button that would memorialize that moment forever, then he reached down and removed a condom from the pocket of his discarded jeans. He handed it to Cas. “Put it on me and then lay down on your back with your legs spread and in the air.”
Cas wanted to “experiment” last night. Mistakes were made. I don’t give a shit how much you like bees. Honey does not belong in certain places. Especially when a certain archangel lets ants into your room. Anybody want an angel? Clearly, Gabriel is fucking broken. I’m about to tell Sam to give up the D just so that Sonofabitch leaves me alone.
This time, Eric slumped over, and Dean got out of the car. He cursed quietly, fixing his uniform and glancing toward the warehouse. He muttered to himself, “Ready or not, here we come.” He pulled Eric’s limp body from the back seat and dropped him on the ground, then dragged him by his ankles toward the door. It took some maneuvering, but he managed to get him inside.
Cas, wanted to see exactly how much someone that clearly broken could take before shattering completely. He wanted to force him to keep those blue eyes open as the breath slowly left his body and his blood washed the voices away, but... maybe this wasn’t the right time. Maybe it wasn’t the right place. Everything he did was so meticulously planned and Castiel was forcing him to reconfigure the rules at every turn. No, this wasn’t worth it. No one was. And yet...
He’d never shared a more all consuming kiss, in his entire life and he knew in that exact moment that no one else would ever do. They finally managed to break away to catch their breath and it was physically impossible for either of them to hide their raging boners. Dean could tell Cas was every bit as big as he thought it would be and nodded towards the hallway. “I’m not opposed to fucking you in this hallway, but maybe we should go inside?”
meat.” He was still chuckling as he got into the car, and if he hadn’t laughed like that in years, who cared? Who needed to know?
David tried again to squirm away from Cas but couldn’t get far. His wrists were starting to chafe, and he’d been on his tiptoes trying to alleviate the pressure but the blood spilling onto the floor made him slip.
him to take it and it was going to take a lot to fight it. He groaned and sat back, trying to adjust his semi without touching it too obviously.
Dean slides them between his fingers and pulls, arching his back at how insanely good he feels. “I— fu— canIcome?”
Dean watched Cas for a few minutes as he let the whiskey relax him. He knew it wasn’t wise to get drunk, they may have to make a run for it at any moment now that those sketches had made the national news. They probably shouldn’t have been hustling at all, but he’d hoped a run-down biker bar would be full of people that didn’t watch the news, or at the very least, wouldn’t pay close enough attention to it to remember a couple of bad drawings. Sure enough, no one seemed to look twice at them. When he was satisfied they were in a relatively safe environment and were likely the two most dangerous people there, Dean slid off his barstool and intentionally staggered toward the pool table, appearing much more intoxicated than he actually was. He listened to the drunken bikers argue over whose turn it was for a moment but quickly got bored and spoke up. “Hey now, why don’t we just start over? You two against me.” He dropped the little bit of cash they had left on the table and picked up a cue stick to lean on it. The bikers eyed him and seemed to agree it would be an easy win, so the larger of the two re-racked and leaned over to break.
Once he finished grabbing some new pencils and paints, he made his way back outside and nearly knocked Meg over as he checked his cellphone.
They talked for over an hour before Cas was ready for something much stronger than coffee, especially to stay awake talking to
“Fuck you, you’re in my house, Chere.” Benny walked over and put Dean in a headlock. They wrestled until one of them spilled a beer all over the carpet and then they all banded together to clean the mess. They always did come together when it mattered.
was why he kept coming back... why he couldn’t leave Cas alone. He’d seen this in his mind’s eye and knew nothing else would ever come close. He nodded once, ignoring the desperate squeals from the man face down on the floor. “You said he fucked you dry and discarded you when you bled? Maybe it’s time he learns how such a thing feels to someone that ain’t actually askin’ for it.” Dean was already hard in his jeans, his cock pressing painfully into the denim. “What’s his name, anyway? God himself knows I ain’t callin’ him
Things had been mostly good. Cas still had his bad days but Dean was getting a lot better about not taking them personally. He realized after the first half a dozen of them that a bad day didn’t mean they were breaking up, it just meant that Cas needed a little extra space.
“Whoa, whoa.” Dean took a half step back as he finally found his voice again. “Easy, tiger. Don’t get up on my account, I’m not stayin’. Well, I’m
But he’s so mad at me that when I asked for a glass of water he brought me a glass of ice and said “wait” and just walked away. Definitely not getting laid tonight.
He collapses next to Dean, and they both look over at each other with dopey, sated grins. “I’m sticky, but now I just wanna nap.”
Cas was happy she always had good music and riding with the windows down was a given. Fall weather had just begun so they needed to enjoy the warmth while they could. Night Moves started just as they parked in the student lot and they decided to wait the song out before heading inside.
They went in, and thankfully, no one really seemed to be awake. The beds appeared to be full but there was a pile of blankets on a table set up near one of the walls, so they helped themselves and huddled in a corner. Dean was hardly going to count this as decent rest, but they were dry and warm... and at the moment, safe. No one ever looked to close at the homeless.
He can see Dean hesitate a second before he nods. “Y-yeah... go’head, Cas. You can touch whatever you want.”
He instantly calls 911 and they’re there in minutes, rushing him away with nothing more than a hospital name to meet them at.
Dean pulled him down by his hips and then lifted him up, ignoring the feelings it stirred inside. “I got him.” Dean cradled Cas in his arms, close to his chest as Nick led the way, opening Cas’ bedroom door.
He thought. But he didn’t want space tonight for some reason. Maybe he was just sleepy, but he actually wanted to be closer to Dean. “I do know actually. I’m claustrophobic.”
“You in the mood to take these guys today or should we... I dunno. Do something normal for a change? Go after them tomorrow?”
Dean smiled, “Who’s askin?” Jo smacked his arm. “I’m kidding. She’s at work like most adults we know. I’ll tell her you asked.”
It helps that all their friends are at the very least bi and attractive, so as Dean slides on his Captain America tights, he doesn’t have any worries about who he will be fucking tonight. Dude, chick, doesn’t matter, everyone knows Dean is a top and Charlie wouldn’t pair him with someone incompatible. Even still, he hopes it’s Cas.
me in the next five minutes!” He paced his apartment and grabbed his cellphone. First he caved and made a damn Facebook but couldn’t bring himself to add any coworkers. So that left Sam, Benny and Charlie. Dean didn’t have many friends, he kept his circle tight but all three of those assholes had girlfriends. They could only entertain him for so long.
“I’m not saying their gender. But I feel shitty about it... and I absolutely want to do it again.” He covered his face in shame.
but Cas still felt them. He couldn’t deny that. Once Dean was done, Cas got up and limped to the bathroom to clean up more, still unable to find the words.
Those withdrawals are a bitch but nothing compared to the withdrawal he was about to start feeling from the Oxy. He can already feel the cold sweat all over his body and the familiar dry cough he’s dealt with in the past after a day without pills, but that’s only the beginning stage, he’s never had to go past that. Because he isn’t an addict… right?
“Enemy? You’re a legal tattoo artist, with a pill problem. You’re not even on his radar.” Cas started to put his earbuds back in.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut behind that blindfold and brought his legs together. He couldn't fucking help it, everything about this felt weird and the fact that a dude was breathing on his dick wasn't helping. Wasn't...
“Watched porn while thinking about us fuckin’ and suckin’ each other? Yeah. A lot actually,” he confessed.
Dean's stomach flipped and he grinned. "Eh, you got a little soft and gooey on me there for a minute, I think you could do better." He cleaned himself up quickly and slid to his feet, catching Cas in another kiss just as he was pulling on his shirt. "I've jacked off to the thought of you jacking off, so uh...
the end, then it was one helluva ride. “There’s only one left. We could kill this one and buy some time.” If Dean was going to kill him, he didn’t want it to be rushed.
Cas slid a finger inside with his tongue. He knew he needed to get at least three in there before he would fit, so he needed to make Dean feel good so he could stay relaxed. “If you spread a little more I can give that cock some attention too.”
“Is that so?” Cas nodded over to where Dean was wrestling with Michael again and forced his eyes away.
Dean laughed and crashed his mouth to Cas’ and then spun him around, pushing him forward until Cas was forced to catch himself on the shower wall with his hands. Dean stroked himself, it wasn’t difficult to get his dick on board after Cas admitting he wanted it too, and then after a couple of minutes of Dean working Cas open with his fingers, he thrust in. “Fuck, your ass is amazing.”
Nothing on Earth can stop the eye roll Cas sends Dean’s way. “Spoiled, that's what you are. You're spoiled.”
way no one would ever be able to separate them. “Thank you for this ride, Dean. You were the highlight of my life.”
“Shut up.” She grabbed her phone and sat on the bed next to him. “I’m not like... trapping you or anything, Dean. I’m serious, watch.” Carmen hit call and put it on speaker, watching Dean’s face.
Dean blinked, freezing entirely. He was originally hoping for the first, but something about the way Cas’ eyes twinkled when he said ‘good boy’ made Dean want to be that. “S-second.” He cleared his throat, snapping out of it.
“Yeah, I know.” Dean bites back his grin and squirms in anticipation. “How many times did you imagine doin’ this? Before we ever did anything, I mean.”
Cas’ eyes devoured him. “All that for me?” He stepped inside, backing Dean against the wall, instantly pulling on his belt and dropping to his knees.
“No. Just took a half.” Cas lied and Dean took a seat next to Cas on the couch, it was obviously more than a half.
He didn't even realize he had fallen asleep until Charlie was back, making him drink some water. “I called Cas. He’s awake, and he said you can have his number. I already put it in your phone. You should pick a more complicated passcode. 1-2-3-4 is amature hour.”
The second time, he got closer to his mark. The guy even kinda looked like Cas with his face covered in blood. He’d kept that one for a while... James? Was that his name? And when he finally slid his knife between his ribs and ended it, he’d realized the issue was that these men weren’t angels. Not like Cas. As a way to bridge the gap, he carved a cross into James’ forehead and dumped the body in a church graveyard. The authorities had had a field day with it, wondering what kind of monster would do this and what it meant.
Dean grabbed a knife and climbed back on top of Eric, his jaw clenched in jealousy he wouldn’t let himself verbalize. He might not have been able to bring himself to say it, but he could
America’s ass, and so despite Charlie’s efforts to give Castiel exactly who he wanted, it may not play out like that anyway. As Dean shakes his ass for the room full of admirers, Cas huffs and straightens his beige tie.
Cas cuddled close, knowing he was probably the only living human to ever cuddle this man. “Guess we will.”
Dean flopped down on his couch and picked up his phone, trying to decide whether or not to warn Cas that Carmen might be on the rampage. But in the off chance she left him alone, he didn’t want to force the ‘hey, I’m single now’ conversation with Cas when he didn’t have a clue what that was going to mean yet.
The blush only deepened as Dean nodded, staring down at where Cas’ hands were still fisted around the fabric. “Fuck, you want it, huh?”
He pushed Cas’ jeans down so roughly that the button snapped and clattered across the floor. Their victim was in his way; he wanted to get to the bed in the corner and fuck Cas into that mattress until he wept with joy. He reached down and grabbed Jones’ ankles, coating himself in fresh blood and shoved him aside. As Cas undressed, Dean kicked Jones’ used up, naked body and made his way to his
He leaned in and kissed Cas this time, throwing in enough passion to hopefully fill the blanks of what he wouldn’t say - that
“Thanks Cas, I’ll do that. I definitely wasn’t ready to get out of bed this morning.” Dean grumbled, he sounded slightly annoyed, but Cas didn’t feel it was directed at him so he chose not to dwell on it.
When he steps foot on the porch, he can hear the music playing through the wood and takes a breath before barging in the door and jumping on the nearest chair. “Cap is here y’all, and yeah, you’re all welcome to stare at America’s ass. It looks so good in these tights I wish
Cas’ happiness is evident in his smile and he leans down to kiss him again, this time much more promising. “It’s okay. We’re doing it now.”
“No actually, I just remember Hermione. I remember all the boys having a crush on her and I didn’t, which only made me realize just how
Cas moaned at the return of Dean’s fingers. “Yours. Only yours Dean.” He slid slightly so the rope tightened on his neck and groaned in pleasure.
than that.” She hesitated, “I can see he means something to you and you’re not going to give up until you save
Cas smiled, happy Dean trusted him. “Alright, see you later.” Cas took one last look at Dean and left.
Nick spoke up again as Gabe entered the dining room. “You’re dating a fucking football player? Sweet!”
Cas had slid them on already and was pulling on his jeans. “What? Ready to go?” He wasn’t about to explain why that made him feel some type of way because he didn’t know
“It’s fine. I don’t have anything to hide.” Cas gripped the waistband of Dean’s shorts and pulled him in, wishing so badly that he could kiss those beautiful pouty lips. “You were going to come to my room, and lay on my bed, and I was going to take care of you.”
“You look drunk.” Dean stared into Cas’ eyes, allowing himself to get lost for a moment before he realized how dilated they are and had to look away. “And high.”
Dean’s cock twitched and he had no intentions of stopping long enough to go get the real lube. He looked around quickly and leaned over Cas’ back, opening the cupboard and fumbling around until he found the olive oil. Five minutes later, he was pushing his oil-slicked cock into Cas’ eager body and bottoming out, letting out a moan.
Cas flinched away from Dean’s booming yell. “I’m sorry! But I hated seeing her touch you, she touched what’s
The urge to actually touch Dean is a little overwhelming — but that isn’t the deal. In fact, that reminds him that he should clarify something before they even begin. “Dean... am I allowed to watch you? If you say no, I promise I’ll keep my eyes on the screen. I just... don’t want to watch without your consent.”
The one thing he didn’t learn from his dearly departed father, however, was his uncontrollable urge to play with his food. The only thing nearly as good as being the force that drove the light from someone’s eyes was sex, and when he combined the two... it was his own personal Hell on earth. The joke was on the Sunday school teachers Dean never had though, he liked the fire. He thrived in the chaos and misery and screaming.
“Oh sure, because you can do anything, right?” He shoved him the map and motioned his hand. “Go ahead, hero. Save us.”
“I was meaning a movie, but I’m down for that too.” Cas was fully smiling now and fuck, it was beautiful.
Dean grinned, much less feral than last time. He’d killed recently, he’d just felt a man’s jaw break under his fist and he was finally not imagining those blue eyes. “You hard for me already, Cas?”
Cas hissed and tensed under him. Breathing heavily as he watched Dean with his jaw slack. “Fuck... I’m already hooked on your beautiful mouth. Dean, I’m close...”
He hoped he was overreacting, but something deep inside of him told him to prepare for the worst... just in case. Maybe it was the apocalypse mentality they’d all taken on over the last month, or maybe it was just his own insecurities. Either way, as he laid on that pull-out bed for the last time, he was too nervous about what was going to happen to feign any sort of optimism.
the drop. It didn’t happen often but it was as though he had no control of his emotions. Silent tears fell down his face as he continued to shake his head.
gut instinct he had by not killing Jesse right there and taking Cas away. But his angel’s words cut through the voices and he reminded himself that Cas
With a knowing chuckle, Cas pulls Dean close and once again sends them through time. When they land, it's a little harder for Cas to heal him quickly — the jumps are starting to get to him but he'd do anything for Dean. Anything at all.
nickname from his Devil, who also seemed much less devilish this time around. Yes, Dean demanded control and inflicted the best kind of pain, but it was different. He didn’t want to just hurt Cas. And maybe it was because he knew Cas got off on it. Who knows, and really, who cares. No matter how
So, why not use that? It felt good and he got what he wanted, and pretty soon, he didn’t need any mundane job. Blowjobs paid his studio apartment’s rent. Fucking paid for his food.
He licked his lips quickly and nodded. "Yeah, fuck yeah. Touch whatever you want, just stay away from my ass. Exit only." Dean nearly asked then about seeing him, but couldn't bring himself to do it.
He took a moment to get his bearings, he’d driven around Sioux Falls enough that he had a pretty good grip on where he was. “It’s about ten miles away, why, you wanna go back there?”
Instead of “moping” around, Cas got up and decided to go get some more art supplies - since Nick is paying. He still loved walking and talking to random old people, that never changed. Cas has always liked old people. People his age just didn’t get his company. It was probably his favorite thing about Dean. There was no rush, no push to be fun or exciting.
If he waited any longer, Dean was going to come without even fucking his angel. His fingers left Cas empty for only a moment until he slicked his cock with warm blood and slid into him, snapping his hips. “Come for me, Castiel.
Dean nodded a little, listening to Cas describe what the man had done to him. He made a mental checklist in his mind of all of that and more. “Cas, angel, do me a favor and figure out where this man keeps his smokes. I’m all of a sudden in the
should just... go back to your house?” He was happy his face was still hidden, because he was definitely blushing. Cas was ready to start this next chapter with Dean, whatever that meant.
of him. He held the kiss for a few, long seconds, then set Cas back down, speaking loudly enough for the onlookers to hear. “Damnit, I missed you, Cas. I gotta get a better job, being away from you for so long is starting to get old.” He smiled down at his angel, all genuine warmth and kindness. He could fake it with the best of them when his ass was on the line.
needed to hurt. He pushed himself up, fighting Cas’ grip and threw his ass back until their bodies were jarring together. He finally found his voice again. “After all this, you
They aren’t perfect. Not by a long shot, but they truly believe their beginning set them up for the long haul, and even though they bicker sometimes, Dean can’t even imagine his life without Cas.
Dean set his glass aside. “What are we waiting for? You’re about 30 too, right?” Cas nodded and he continued, “same here, we aren’t just some confused kids. We know what we’re doing.”
Cas nodded and turned away with a frown. “Wish we could have killed him.” He reached back and grabbed his toothbrush and a cup to brush his teeth, needing the man’s taste out of his mouth.
Dean pulled his fingers out and clicked his tongue. “Guess I need to teach you patience all over again.” He picked the knife up from the bed and slid his thumb over the sharpened edge of the blade, the hint of a dangerous smirk playing at the corner of his mouth. He dragged the blade over the inside of Castiel's thigh, careful not to cut his artery and watched with lust blown eyes as the blood cascaded down to his groin. “Now be a good boy or I'll do it again, you understand?” He set the knife down and began stroking his own cock, punching out guttural moans at the sight.
It doesn’t take long for them to be drunk and as predicted, Cole and Bela disappear after the first game, Charlie and her two soon after. Lisa’s eyeing Dean and he knows he’s going to be pulled away soon so he takes advantage of Cas alone in the kitchen one last time. “So next year, huh? Didn’t want to meet someone and fuck the same day?” He licks his lips and stops a little closer than he should.
but something about his tone made Dean’s fists clench under the table. “Yeah, he’s mine.” He uncurled his fingers and leaned back against his seat, tilting his head and giving the waiter a challenging stare. “So uhh... whatever
"No, but now that you're stripping..." Jask waddles over to the table and grabs another condom, shoving it at Ares. "Join us, babe. My boner isn't going away anytime soon."
Dean drifted off to sleep with Cas in his arms and the voices in his head nothing more than a distant choir. The following morning, he woke up before Cas and decided to let him sleep. He got dressed, taking their laundry to the laundromat down the street and then picked up a couple of burner phones and some breakfast on the way back. When he returned, Cas was awake. He tossed him one of the phones and the bag of food and doubled back to the car to get the laundry. He set everything down and started eating. “Sleep okay?”
Cas kissed him for a while, making sure Dean was completely relaxed before he got up to get the rope. “I won’t start with cuffs, those are too confining, just your hands with the rope and you can still grip my hair.” He tied Dean’s hands in front of him and then kissed him again before kissing all the way down to his now semi hard cock. “Relax baby, you trust me?”
She had watched them learn about themselves, and she’d witnessed the spark between them grow over the course of the hour they’d been sat on her couch. It had been wonderful to watch, and Cordelia will be the first to admit that it had warmed her heart to see the way they’d become more and more smitten with each passing minute. It was enough to make her wonder how she hadn’t noticed something else was going on sooner. They had looked just so damn stunned after the first kiss they’d shared! However, nothing she felt that day was comparable to the emotions she currently has coursing through her. Of course, it’s merely professional interest, right? She’s just eager to find out if a relationship with such unconventional beginnings could actually blossom into something deep and lasting. Yes. That’s all this is. It’s a professional curiosity and nothing more.
“I didn’t. I just wanted to make up for your head injury.” He offered a smile and Dean took a huge bite, sitting back with a grin.
The chemistry between them is like nothing she’s ever seen before or since, and it had taken all her self control to not reach out to them before now to satisfy her insatiable interest in their budding relationship.
Just for the record, I know what bi is, I am bi. Dean is seventeen years old and druuunk. He instantly says he isn’t explaining it right and tells Cas to research. Please don’t comment about how Dean was wrong, I know how he was wrong and this isn’t the focus of this fic, which is why it moves on quickly. I wanted to naturally throw in that there are more sexualities than most people realize, as realistically as possible.
One swipe of that damn thing had Dean chubbing up, dude or not. He ran his hand up Carmen’s side and slowly spread his legs further.
The Roadhouse wasn't far from him, and he got off work early enough it wouldn't really matter when. All he had to do was convince Carmen to go somewhere else for a while, or just tell her he was working late, which happened often enough she shouldn't think twice about it. Again, he kinda felt like a dick... but she'd opened this door, not him. And it was just one time, right? To help Cas out and get it out of his system?
Angel. Castiel had never felt more important in his entire life. “Let me ride you baby.” He whispered while Dean kissed down his neck.
“You okay, angel?” Dean’s voice was wrecked with lust but at least he asked. “Remember your safeword?”
him keeping out of trouble. He’s been drawing since he was three and ever since then he’s been a perfectionist asshole about his art. I’m not allowed to touch his pieces.”
Dean didn’t hesitate, it was the first time since he was a child that he let his emotions rule over logic. He punched Nick in the jaw with a deafening crack, then shoved his hand in his pocket and pulled out a single dollar bill. He shoved it at Nick’s chest. “There, and I bet that’s a whole two dollars more than you’re worth.” He grabbed Cas’ hip again and led him outside. The second they were clear of the bar he turned to finally look at him. “You have shit taste in hookups,
The realization had him shoving his phone back in his pocket and making his way home. He didn’t respond because he didn't know what to say. Why was he feeling this way? Why did he find himself thinking of Dean so much? Dean was a guy… Cas wasn’t gay.
He can’t catch his breath, but who cares? Let it run as far away as it wants, he can die happy. He’ll never have sex better than that, there’s no way. He’s good.
want to.” Cas palms himself, his mouth watering as he drops down to his knees, pulling at Dean’s jeans like it’s the last thing he’ll ever do and he sucks a dark mark on his hip, branding him his.
“It wasn’t stupid. It’s okay to be curious about it. Especially after a dude sucked your cock. Just don’t pressure yourself to choose. I’m gay, because a chick couldn’t get my dick hard if she had a buzz cut and a strap-on. But that is just me. I can’t tell you what you are.” Cas actually sounded completely non-judgmental that time, and there was no laughter involved.
The first time they have sex is filled with raw, palpable passion. When they come together, Cas nearly confesses his love right then.
Been on my own since I was 17 because I loved cock and I’m really just passing through. You haven’t told me your name, what am I supposed to call you?” Cas gave Dean what he thought was little to no information about him but really, it was more than enough.
“Well, you never know. I mean, we don’t always talk about things.” He didn't want to ruin the mood, but it was the truth. Dean saw home videos of who John was before they lost his mom and Sammy, and he was very different from this. John did the best he could raising Dean, but he didn’t take a lot of downtime because working all day was much easier than sitting around and missing what you’ve lost. Now that Dean was older, he got it. But sometimes he wished he could just… talk to his dad.
“Jesus, Dean.” Cas pulled out and slammed back in, bottoming out. “Fuck!” He started fucking into Dean, feeling like he was in a damn dream. “Bite me, so I know I’m awake.”
“What are you hoping to gain here? Do you pick up a new stray every few months so you can feel good about yourself? Why the fuck do you care?!”
He shoved the front of Cas’ panties down and started stroking him, continuing his quest to mark the hell out of Cas’ neck. “Good. Keep cookin’.”
They mumbled their agreement and Dean’s eyes swept the house for Cas. He didn’t see him, and assumed he was probably hiding in his room to avoid the awkward goodbye. He looked up toward the ceiling and said quietly, “So glad to meet you, Angeles.” He licked his lips and let out a steadying breath through his nose, then walked out the door.
Cas came back a moment later with a perfectly fitted white shirt on, and sat down on the couch, waving for Dean to join him. “So… you have my attention, Dean.”
“Okay, is that a problem for you?” It surprisingly wasn’t for him. He found himself wondering how Dean looked in the mornings and suddenly wanted to go see.
It makes Cas’ pupils blow and his cock thicken. He pushes his finger deeper, twisting it and pulling it back, twisting in, pulling back… “Take your shirt off and get in the car. You need to wait just a little longer, sweetheart.”
“Yeah, well... you did.” Dean leaned in and kissed Cas, pulling their hips together and biting his lip.
Nick was grateful for his job, but that didn’t mean he was a fan of it. And not unlike his brother, when he didn’t like something, his mind started to wander. Yeah, he was glad that Cas was doing better - but he had a feeling Cas just swapped one addiction for another, and this one was a person. He knew Dean felt something for his brother, so why the hell hadn’t he texted him? He decided to text him and find out, because if he had to deal with Cas being lovesick and grumpy all the time, he at least wanted to know it was merited.
He didn’t care that they won the season opener, he was determined to be undefeated. “What’s wrong with you boys? You look like you just got done fighting a war. How are you supposed to keep up with the Knights if you can’t even handle a few two-a-days?”
“Okay fine Mr. Officer.” When they reached the car, Cas turned around so he and Dean were face to face and for some reason, Dean didn’t move away. Cas licked his lips again, noticing how Dean’s eyes watched his tongue. “Just let me take care of you.” Cas whispered.
“Cas— fuck.” Dean starts riding him, lifting and rolling his hips, desperate for release. “Fuck... tell me it won’t be the only time. I need —
The man struggled in his arms, but Dean’s hold on him was absolute. From this angle, he could see the blood dripping from the man’s eye, and he licked the line of rust-flavored crimson from his cheek. He snarled, letting out a tearless sob. “Let me go! I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you both!”
By the time the bell rang, Cas couldn’t help it. He pulled out his phone and smiled down at his messages.
He taps Cas’ hat and bites his bottom lip in a way that’s so endearing Cas nearly forgets that he’d just hit on every single person in the room.
Cordelia grins as she thinks back to the confusion she’d felt that day. These two stunningly beautiful idiots had waltzed into her office and engaged her services under questionable pretenses, and with that had begun an academic fascination in the therapist’s mind. She’d read studies on fake relationships that later developed into real ones. She'd read romance stories featuring people pretending to be together to placate interfering families. She’d even come across more than a few instances of legal complications in false marriages with some insurance fraud thrown in. Nothing she’d read had come close to what these two boys had attempted, and it was downright comical.
Cas nodded when he understood. “Alright, that’s smart. I’ll go.” He pulled Dean in for another kiss.
also laid awake at night, wondering what it would be like to finally give in and just have sex already? Either way, Cas knew the reason he was saying no to everyone else was because he needed to
Another day passed, and it was more of the same but Cas could slowly feel himself coming back. With the amount of sleeping he had done, he found himself wide awake around 3am and walked around the house, finally getting food for himself. Cole had brought him food every day, in fact at some point every one of them had checked on him by bringing water or some form or sustenance and he was truly appreciative of them. Fuck, he really needed to get a grip, if not for him, for the ones that gave a shit about him.
It makes Dean smile wider than anything else and he kisses again... and again. He’d rather not stop but he remembers where they are and sits back, waiting patiently on their food.
Dean’s entire body twitches at the visual and his eyes close tightly as he tries to come back to the moment. “Goddamn, Cas. We’re absolutely gonna have to do that.”
would I ever leave the only person to ever give a damn about my safety? I told you, I don’t have a family because I’m gay. They kicked me out at 17 and never once tried to help me survive. They didn’t care if some old dude tied me up and tortured me, because I’m
His stomach flipped and his dick woke up at that. The thought that Cas wanted Dean to come inside of him was almost too fucking hot to handle, and he shook out his arms to shake loose some of the tension building in his shoulders.
Eventually, Mr. Jones quit making noise. His body went limp under Cas, and Dean walked over, reaching out to touch his angel’s face. “You’re perfect, Castiel. Put it down, he won’t wake up for awhile.” He waited until Cas set aside the dildo and pulled him into a kiss, all heat and passion and bloodlust wrapped up into a single act. His cock throbbed between them and his hand slid to Cas’ throat, where he squeezed tightly as his tongue claimed his angel’s mouth.
He bites him gently and then hums, sliding down to let Dean roll onto his back. Once he splays out, Cas slots himself between Dean’s legs and sucks gently on the inside of his thigh.
long. “I can’t argue with either of those choices. For me, I just —” he pauses, feeling his face flush — “really like come. Watching bottoms come while being fucked, frottage, gangbangs where someone just gets covered...” A full body shudder wracks through him, and he stops, pulling his knees up to his chest to hide the evidence of how serious he is.
that openly defied him. “I think I’d start with his fingers, to be honest.” His tone was light and contemplative, but there was a sense of gravitas to his words. “Do you know how many times you can break a single human finger? Depends on the tools you’ve got, but... suffice it to say the answer is probably higher than you think.” He paused to take a bite of his burger, moaning at the taste because it had been a long time since he’d sat down to a normal meal. “Then... I dunno. Depends on how mouthy he was at the time.”
Castiel’s body was so responsive to him that Dean nearly unraveled in that parking lot. If he was like that just from a kiss he only threw half his effort into, what was he going to be like during sex? After? Would Castiel’s pale skin jump under his blade, like his very cells were trying to escape? Would he shake as the warm blood coated his chest, his back, his ass fucked raw by Dean? It was difficult to tell much of anything except for the fact that
Cas glanced over at Dean and had to palm himself to keep from coming at the sight. “Fuck, you’re so fucking hot.” Cas continued to brutally shove the toy into the man with his eyes on Dean.
“Relax for me baby.” Cas stripped Dean and returned to his ass, spreading him open. “You love my mouth, remember?” He lapped at Dean’s hole.
Sighing, Cas glances back down at the costume card he was given. “I still think you could’ve picked a better costume for me than Bucky Barnes, though I appreciate that you’re at least letting me wear his army uniform and not the post-Winter Soldier madman one.”
“Yes, I’ll marry you,” Cas says quickly. “Now come in my fucking lungs.” He dives in, sucking hungrily and sloppily to show Dean what he can do, then stills and taps his leg to tell him to take what he wants.
Just in case - there were two uploaded tonight so if this is the first one you're looking at, go back or this won't make a lick of sense. Enjoy!
Dean curled his fingers in a circle and dug his nails into the raw flesh. “Is that how you ask for things?”
Dean peppered kisses over his shoulders, speaking only when he managed to drag his lips away. “I told you, touching you is a privilege I will never take lightly.” He pulled away enough to allow Cas to maneuver onto his back again. They locked eyes, and Dean swore he could see the entire expanse of the universe in Cas’. Whatever was happening, it wasn’t just sex. It wasn’t even limited to this plane.
They made their way inside around 9:30pm, and the party was already in full swing. People were drunk and probably having the time of their lives, but Cas still cringed. “People are idiots, Charlie.” Cas turned towards his friend and realized he was alone. “Oh, great. So glad I came.” he rolled his eyes, and against his better judgement, he went to get a beer.
for the community, but it’s normally something stupid. They were either about to be painting over the taggings
Dean shrugged, trying to remain as nonchalant about it as possible. “If he wants to, sure. Who the hell am I to pass up a free hummer?”
Dean laughed out loud, “You know I agree with that.” He kissed Cas and interlocked their fingers as they began to walk to the stairs. “Feeling better?”
About a month later, they were in the middle of absolute nowhere. Dean wasn’t convinced the backwoods West Virginian town even had a name, but that suited him just fine. They’d been in town for a couple of days and were actively stalking an accused rapist that got off on a technicality. Cas had come up with the idea of choosing victims from the sex offender registry, and after he’d taught Dean how to actually access the internet on his burner phone that he’d previously thought incapable of such a thing, Dean got to work. He was still seething over Alastair and was going out of his fucking mind from not killing for so long, but they’d spent the last few weeks lying so low they were practically starving. They hadn’t risked staying in motels more than necessary, instead, they lived out of Baby and truck stop showers.
And so they traveled, stopping only long enough to do what was absolutely needed. Dean wasn’t quite aware yet, but he was traveling back in direction of where their journey all started: Sioux Falls, SD. It had been a couple of weeks since Dean’s near unraveling at the restaurant but true to his word, Cas had bled for him. He’d also dropped again, and Dean wasn’t all that much better at handling it then than he had been the first two times.
They live a long and healthy life together and even on Castiel’s death bed, he still aches for Dean Winchester. The hopefulness he feels as he slips away isn’t for heaven, it’s for the one man he hopes to see there, and when he opens that door and steps inside…
Cas jumped off the counter and grabbed the paper towels to clean the mess. “Can’t even have a moment to my fucking self anymore, Benny?” Cleaning up aggressively led to a cut on his thumb, the dark crimson liquid dripping onto the counter and down his wrist. “Great.”
He walked up behind Cas and ghosted his fingers down those bare sides, leaning in to kiss the bruise. “You’re spoilin’ me.”
Inviting Cas to hang out after the blowjob was probably a stupid idea, but Dean had never really been known for making good decisions post mind-blowing orgasms. Besides, he
Once they were clean and fed, they sat down on the couch to continue their Star Wars marathon. They sat so close Cas was practically in his lap, but they preferred it this way.
Cas stares up at America’s ass in disbelief. He already wants to hurt every person in this room that started clapping, but the sheer joy on the face of the man wearing the costume reminds him of one, very important thing: Dean Winchester truly believes that Steve Rogers
People sucked. Cas knew that and anyone who denied it was kidding themselves. Dean walked around like things were fine, like the world wasn't going to shit around them and it was borderline infuriating.
He nearly falls trying to scramble up Dean’s body. “Are you sure?” Cas mutters quickly, grabbing a fistful of Dean’s hair and pulling his head up the moment he nods. “Open for me, sweetheart. Taste it.” He comes with a grunt, and Dean’s eyes close as some lands just above his eyebrow, but the rest coats his tongue and chin.
Dean kneeled in front of Cas on the bed, taking a moment to appreciate the gorgeous arch of his back and the way the smooth material cupped his ass like it was a delicious, crimson present. He stroked his own cock in front of his angel’s face and brought his eyes down to it. “Want it?”
Dean dropped his head to Cas’ lap, exhaling hard as relief rushed through him. He chuckled quietly and clicked his tongue. “What can I say? I don’t do anything halfway.”
A smile threatened to crack Dean’s face right in half and he let out a nervous, relieved laugh. This was still Cas, in all his sassy glory. “Fuck. I don’t know.” He kicked his sweats and boxers off in a hurry, helped along by eager hands. “Better?”
While Dean showered, Cas looked around again and came across Dean’s journal. He smiled, one day, he would make the time to sit and read the whole thing. But for right now, he needed to check out this article. He picked up the paper to read what his parents said about him; he hadn’t looked at it close enough yesterday before his freak out.
Everything was ready when Cas pulled in the driveway, and Dean quietly apologized to the creature before throwing a towel over the cage to hide her. He made sure the sides were still open so she could breathe, and then met Cas at the door after hearing him come up the stairs.
Cas groaned behind the briefs, but complied with Dean’s demand as best as he could. He didn’t want Dean to stop and he knew he would if Cas wasn’t a good boy. He planted his hands and let his man pound into him, not caring that the car was rocking enough for people to notice.
Those small moments with Cas didn’t help Dean’s crush in the slightest, but he still couldn’t stay away. In fact, the crush got so ridiculous that Dean had to
Cas doesn’t respond for hours. Dean works the night shift tonight so he took the morning/afternoon to catch up on some tv, just as Dean is getting his uniform on, he hears the chime. He’d never admit the smile he had as he walked over to his phone.
He went to his usual coffee joint and flirted with the barista. “Back again?” Alec asked with a smile.
“Her name is Nut, by the way. Get it? Hazelnut?” Dean grinned cheekily, proud of himself as he watched Cas cuddle Nut to his chest. The bitchface he received for the name was absolutely, certifiably worth the hundred bucks he’d just spent on the damn thing.
killed Cas and it wasn’t even on purpose. It had been almost a year since their encounter at the church. They’d slept together, killed together, raped together, and hunted together - and yet, Dean nearly killed him. He slowly got off the bed and rummaged around, finding some salve and a bandaid in the bottom of one of their bags. He came back, gingerly cleaning and bandaging the cut on Cas’ thigh, remaining silent.
Balt and Cole were in the kitchen having coffee and instantly felt Cas’ tense energy. Cole had been living here a few months and he knew the best way to approach Cas on these days was at a distance, so he nodded a farewell at Balt and went upstairs to the comfort of his room with Gad, leaving Cas and Balt downstairs.
“Because Charlie asked me if you could have my number about three minutes ago, and now my phone is ringing. It was an educated guess. You’re drunk.”
noise. “Isn’t it beautiful? Look at it; eggs, bacon, cheese... on a friggin bagel! Take a bite, lemme watch.”
he teased, and reached for Dean’s hand. “You don’t scare me because I’ve seen your soul and deep down, you don’t want to hurt me. You hurt me for pleasure but you killed that man today because he hurt me. You protected me.
That simple phrase sent Cas over. His dick chubbed up in his jeans and he dropped the fry he was attempting to eat.
He was kissed fiercely then, like Cas was certain that words would never be enough. Perfect, strong hands wound their way under Dean’s t-shirt and he shuddered at the feel of them. He wanted to take this slow, but the ache inside of him to have Cas fully was almost too much for him to bear. Dean pulled back from the kiss and kneeled up, crossing his arms by his waist to unhurriedly ease the piece of clothing over his head.
Cas looked up and stared into those beautiful green eyes that had haunted him since that night. “I fingered myself before I left but I’m not wearing a plug.” He freed his cock, already feeling a slight release. His jeans were too fucking tight.
Something about having someone balls deep inside of him made him a little more open, in more than one sense. The thought of pulling away caused his chest to ache; and all at once, he put a name to it. “I can’t. I love you, Castiel. All of you. I’m not goin’ anywhere.” Dean’s entire body flushed and he panicked, cursing himself for picking now of all times to say something like that. “Now, shut up and
Cas slaps his hand away, shaking his head because he can’t form the words to tell Dean that his cock is all he needs. He can feel the warm familiar feeling of release in his gut, he’s close, too close and there is no way he can hang on for Dean. His head swivels forward and he finally meets Dean’s eyes, the flame he sees sends him free falling over the cliff.
Prep takes longer with help, especially with how gentle Dean is being, but by the time he’s leaking with desperation, he can’t take it anymore. Cas shoves him backwards and straddles his lap. “I need you, Dean.”
He sat on the porch until the sun rose, thinking about how to fix this shitstorm he had created and by the time he heard movement in the house, he had decided on his course. First, he would call his old therapist. Yeah, he had moved away since the last he saw him, but maybe he could give a reference of someone closer to Cas? It was worth a shot. Secondly, he would fix this with Dean. How? Well, he hadn’t gotten that far yet, but he had to try. Dean was the only one Cas could see himself getting over all of this bullshit with. Maybe he could never stand the touch of a stranger, but Dean wasn’t a stranger. He had only known him less than four weeks and yet he felt closer to
“Hey for the record, I’ve been trying.” Cas dropped down to his knees and instantly swallowed Dean down with a groan. He reached to pull his sweats down as he bobbed hungrily.
A short while later, Dean returned with breakfast and one of every single flavor of Gatorade because he’d forgotten to ask and Cas hadn’t responded to the text he’d sent. He carried the bags inside in a single trip, his arms straining as he opened the door noisily and set everything down.
Dean swore loudly and dragged his nails down Cas’ thighs, digging in until he could feel a few warm, wet dots of blood under his fingers. He let out a breath, relaxing under Cas. “Fuck. So good, ride me, angel.
Cas shrugged. “I’m interested in it. I just love your cock so much I haven’t thought about it much. I used to top Alec from the coffee shop.” Cas admitted, not sure if it would upset Dean.
“Hi, baby. Have I told you how friggin amazing you are today?” Dean slides his hands up to Cas’ hips and kisses again.
to his supervisor, but he didn’t catch a damn word she said. Knowing Dean was touching himself had Cas’ bursting at the seams.
The flood of Cas’ warm come interrupts that sentence and Dean groans as he swallows it down, greedily sucking for more. Cas doesn't have it in him to pull him off until he's over sensitive and shaking, and by that point, he needs to taste Dean so badly he's a mess for it.
“Y-yeah... you want me to come on you, Castiel? Where you want it?” Dean eggs them both on with his words, and when he pictures Cas covered in his come, his entire body shudders.
“You had said you liked a specific kind, and I was wondering if it was true, or if you were just saying it to... I don’t know. Make me feel better? Relate to me? I don’t think those are the right words, but you know what I mean.”
“My week was incredibly mundane.” But he knew she wanted more than that. “A student of mine came out this week. He came up to me and thanked me for helping him feel confident in his sexuality but I didn’t feel I deserved it.”
Dean rested his forehead between Cas’ shoulders, stunned in the way he loved hearing his angel say his name. He bit again, this time not with the intention of breaking skin, but the intention of leaving a different kind of mark. The kind of mark that would let anyone else that ended up behind Cas know that he belonged to someone else. To him. To
He didn’t have a phone, never needed one, but he had a laptop so he looked up some local BDSM clubs and the rest was history.
Dean huffed a laugh and stood, if he didn’t leave now, who knows what he would do with Castiel. “Anyways, sorry to interrupt your mind porn about some pretty cop. Take care Cas.” Dean called out as he walked towards the door, a sly smile upon his lips as he exited.
Dean studied her for a moment, knowing he should shut the hell up, apologize, and just give her what she wanted. But there was something bugging him that just wouldn’t go away, and he had to find out eventually.
A different waitress brought out their food letting them know their former waiter was on break and she would be taking care of them from now on. “Guess you scared him off.”
Cas would have laughed if he wasn’t currently sliding a dick down his throat so instead, he hummed around Dean, sucking messily to get Dean slick just like he asked.
His best friend pulls him into a hug. As soon as Dean realizes just how badly he needs this, he wraps his arms around Cas, burying his face into his neck. It’s the best thing Dean’s felt in a while and he appreciates the fact that Cas doesn’t even attempt to move away. Neither of them do.
natural. These fingers were made to be together. Castiel smiled over at Dean. “Real food sounds amazing.”
“My brother informed me the same, we don’t have the same brother right?” Cas chuckled at himself, “That was a shit joke.”
Dean started the car and looked over at Cas, smirking as his eyes traveled over him. “You’re a mess.” He slowly licked his lip and admired what a
He alternated between slow, deep thrusts and quick, almost brutal ones - never letting Cas get used to a certain pace. “Fuck, I love seein’ you spread out like this for me, wanna fuck your tight little ass over every goddamn inch of this house.” Dean reached around, stroking Cas a couple of times and letting go, just short spurts opposite of his thrusts that he knew would drive Cas insane.
Dean was fidgety as hell on Sunday, even worse than the previous week. This time, there would be no buffer, no one to distract him from the fact that a guy was sucking him off. He didn't even know what Cas looked like, what if he was a troll? At the end of the day, it probably didn't matter, it wasn't like Dean would ever have the fucking balls to take the blindfold off anyway.
His words. I shit you not. “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this. Have a nice day Dean.” And continued wailing “HELP ME MY KNIGHT!” At the top of his lungs.
do would put out that light. His hips stuttered and his grip loosened just a little as he realized with a jolt that he
talking to you. I just needed some time to process. I’m sorry if I let you down with the safe word.” Cas averted his gaze.
Cas’ grin faltered slightly, “Even off duty you’re a prude.” He can tell Charlie is about to tell him off so he stood, “Not that this
Unable to deny his angel anything in these final hours, he pulled back. In the absence of proper lube or blood, he spit-slicked his cock and Cas' hole and pressed in, sinking slowly with a quiet moan. If this was going to be the last time he ever entered Cas, or anyone for that matter, he was gonna make every second count. When he finally bottomed out, Cas' legs wrapped around him and he dropped his upper body down, kissing him gently.
Dean struggled with whether he should be offended by this. On one hand, he didn’t want him to text. Talking to Cas would just make what happened more real. And on the second hand, Cas just sucked his dick and went on with his life like nothing. Did it mean
Cas fucked Dean right back down into that mattress. Dean’s arms felt like jello anyway, he wouldn’t have lasted much longer trying to hold himself up through Cas’ assault. He was drooling all over the sheet and there was a matching fucking wet spot from his cock leaking all over the place every time Cas made him see stars. He was right, he wasn’t gonna be able to come without something else, but Cas finally being the one to take what he needed from
“I dunno Nick!” Dean sighed, “I don’t know. But he needs to eat.” Dean pulled in the Roadhouse diner’s parking lot and parked. “The owner here is basically my aunt, her name is Ellen. She’ll whip something up for him but you have to say it’s from you and not me, something tells me he’d take it wrong and think it’s charity.” Dean rolled his eyes and reached for the handle.
