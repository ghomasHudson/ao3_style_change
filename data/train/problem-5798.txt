Steve hit the ground shield first, making an even louder thud as the shield absorbed the impact. Tony’s foot didn’t allow Steve to pop himself up as it came down on his back with an extremely loud crunch. Two or three vertebrae were under extreme pressure from the solid armoured boot. Steve grimaced, turning his head toward the two men that stood in a stancethat was supposed to resemble power and authority.
Steve lifted the robot out, carrying him over his shoulder. “You know what, lil’ guy, I’ve spent my whole life alone – going from my home to the orphanage. I know what is like to be the one who gets thrown away, the one that people lose hope in, but look at me now! Now I’ve got America depending on me and people look to me for hope.”
“W-what are you doing?! Stark! Get back in here!”
“Shit...” The once billionaire scowled, rubbing his messy overgrown beard and walking around, attempting to get used to his limbs. “This sounds far too suspicious. With Oscorp taking over then murderous rampages...”
As they approached the city center it was clear with the amount of destruction that they were in the right place. Carol pulled her car to the side while people were running around screaming, flailing their limbs about and stumbling over one another trying to get out of the buildings that the bot was attacking. It wasn’t just stomping around the city clumsily like they’d expected, no, it was shooting lasers, flinging its huge metallic arms about, with its bright green eyes instilling fear into the local civilians that attempted to escape it. It echoed, its booming ear-shattering voice replaying the same message over and over again;
Fury rolled his eye, “I
“So what’s the plan?” The master strategist asked.
“I can’t do this.” Tony bolted for the door, actually running toward it, long lab-coat fluttering behind him as he tossed it off just before running through the iron-clad doors.
“Perfect, now is the time then.” The gruff voice behind a mask spoke, the metal around his face causing his voice to echo ominously behind it, bright blues peering through the slits at the screens with interest, watching the red dot move quickly down the screen and along a street. “Now, we strike. I will get those plans, if it’s the last thing that I do!” He laughed darkly.
“A biochemical…”
“Then what? What’ve you got for me?” he asked, waving his fingers with anticipation. The quake above them made the rusted pipes shudder and shake dust, even cracking with the impacts. It sounded as though he were in a bunker during the war, listening to bombs being fired above. For that second even as they both swung their heads toward the roof and kept their shoulders raised from the surprise.
The ticking of the cogs resounded throughout the entire old, rickety building, heavy machinery slamming down on their respective parts, churning and producing, hot steam releases piping throughout the air and whistling as they pressed and released.
Tony placed the mug down and fell into his seat, placing his hand over his red bloodshot eyes. “I just want Steve out of here…”
Peter and Jessica stood side by side on guard throughout the entire operation which to Tony took a lifetime, but in reality only took a couple of minutes. Praising his speed, they began to dash down the alley which they had initially come through and with that Carol broke from the embrace to tug Tony’s arm and propel herself forward. She moved so quickly her feet lifted off the ground and she zoomed ahead to catch the two spiders up, hovering not so high above them, but just enough to keep Tony in the air too. To make things easier he lifted his legs, but her strength never ceased to amaze him. The exit to the streets wasn’t too far, and Peter was now webslinging from wall to wall to pick up more momentum.
Tony shook his head, “I can’t see anything...” He said, looking over at Steve and still seeing the light from the hallway cast those wing-like lights over him. “Though, the way you’re sitting, it looks like you’ve got wings.” He mused.
He pulled him close and smoothed his metal fingers through Steve’s hair in an attempt to calm him down. He knew Steve loved having his hair touched  and combed through, that’s what he had always noticed whenever he was with someone, including the times that they had spent together on the couch. Steve would sometimes playfully curl one of Tony’s locks around his finger casually, just to tease him about the perm that he once had, but Tony secretly enjoyed it. And from then on he would notice Steve would always play with Sharon’s hair or even Bernie’s a very long time ago. Perhaps him doing the same would trigger a memory that would soothe him. But he did regret that he couldn’t touch him with his own fingers, he couldn’t embrace his soft locks and let them skim across his fingertips until Steve was out of here. It only added to his conviction to find a cure.
Tony had luckily found a couple of spare wires in the department store, clearly meant for lighting but they had already been pulled out and exposed from a slab of drywall, so it wasn’t really any harm for Tony to tug these wires out with an appropriate amount of force and use them to help re-wire his reactor to his bionic arm; the wires trailing over his chest and leading directly into his arm, so he had a makeshift repulsor if he needed it, powered by his chest. It didn’t take two seconds to wire, but it meant that as they were walking he was still fiddling with the pieces in his palm, trying to make a direct output to match that of his own armour.
“I’ll handle it,” he mumbled. “We’ll just have to stick with a divided force, divide and conquer, like the Romans.”
A sad sigh escaped Tony’s lips, but he knew that Steve was still alive. He could feel his soft breathing as he held him close, knowing for sure he had to get him as far away from the public eye as possible. That, and he had to get back to Carol to make sure that she was safe where she was, considering that they left her in such a state back by the park. That and he had to get Peter back from whoever had taken him and he needed to get his helmet back. The first call of action was to return to the hospital and pass the park on the way, that way he could get Carol and take her there too. The main task would be trying to navigate himself back through this foreign place without Peter’s help.
“You rats think you could get in here? I thought we managed to get pest control on you already!” he taunted in his slimy, snarky voice that forced the hairs on the back of Tony’s neck to stand.
“Make him watch…” Hammer said, and just like that the Purple Man snapped his fingers with glee. Tony’s head jerked to the side, his eyes forced wide as if pins were holding prying his eyelids open. He could feel his eyes burning, watering – he needed to blink but the invisible toothpicks holding his eyes open were preventing it. The blade forced itself down lower and lower, tearing into his muscle with a loud
“It appears Batroc has been captured.” A disgruntled voice replied, much higher than the one that had posed the question. The strangely formed robot with a huge head and tiny legs, seated on a floating chair with a tiny rocket thruster keeping it afloat, moved from screen to screen.
He used the back of his
“…So you think he… The explosion probably burned him up…”
Tony shook his head. “No quarantine.”
He screamed out, kicking himself back and falling back, clutching his face. His lips were bleeding and torn and Steve had blood stains all over his mouth, slowly rolling off the table to all fours before crawling over to Tony, reaching out for him.
Steve looked at the artefacts that resided in their own cases, wanting to reach out and touch them but being restricted from doing so, which once more sent a dull ache coursing through his chest.  He needed a distraction, and quick, which was what, brought Tony to his attention. He took a few quick strides to catch him up then flashed a tiny nostalgic smile at the contents of the display that the dark haired man was focused on. “That one is one of the guns we used to infiltrate a Hydra base back near the East of Frankfurt.”
“You found a way to calm him?” Reed asked with interest.
Tony stared like a kitten, wide eyed at his owner who just stirred lightly. Impatiently he huffed, dipping to press his chest against Steve’s, hearing the clink as their reactors pressed together. He let out a groan, the sensation being odd to say the least. It made his body go slightly numb, as though they were two magnets trying to repel from one another, which would make theoretical sense since the arc reactor was essentially based off the basis of an electro magnet.
There was no call back. But Reed had the tendency of getting so engrossed in his work that he tuned out the voices around him. JARVIS went ahead and ran around the lab while Tony collected his bots, putting them all in an upright position so that when they turned on they wouldn’t struggle to function. They would all need to be mended with the same care and love that he’d put into all of his projects, that was for sure.
Bucky had to yank his hand out of the control panel, reaching for Steve’s hand but the soldier was falling further and further out of reach. “Steve!” He yelled.
As soon as a blast came their way, Steve held up the holographic shield that seemed to soak up the energy and bounce it back.
Hammer was definitely as greasy looking as Tony had described him. He wore a white suit that looked almost grey, short slicked back brown hair, glasses, and hada skeletal looking face with a huge nose. He looked like a man who had been thirsty for attention his entire life, that or he was trying too hard and vastly overcompensating. His glasses were thick white frames, gleaming under the light and hiding his dark coloured eyes that Steve occasionally caught a glance of when the glare on the lenses shifted.
“It’s getting smarter.” Steve noticed.
The blond raised his hand, pressing it to the side of Tony’s face, instantly spotting the way he eased into it, like a cat rubbing its cheek against an object with such delight upon his face. He smiled, hand lowering into a caress, gently skimming his thumb across Tony’s bottom lip. The other man didn’t flinch; instead he seemed mesmerised by such a gentle manner coming from a man that was famed for his punches and brutality. But no, Steve was a lover; he was a gentle soul at heart.
“Well,
Steve was just gawking at the man, trying to figure out what on earth he’d just witnessed.
He knew Norman was the brains behind the systems, but whether he was truly in charge was another thing he needed confirming. Tony prayed internally that the government had just changed hands. He could deal with politicians, but not mad scientists.
“For what!?” Tony repeated.
“What’s wrong?” He turned to ask Tony.
“I know that’s why… I trust you. Because you and I have more in common than you can believe, we have what makes us unique, but we also have each other…”
The patriotic star spangled man growled under his breath. He hated his city being in danger as much as anyone else, but bombs in recent times, the increasing terror threats since that dreaded day, always made him tense up more than usual.
“That breathing control chip has a tracker in it…” Tony pointed out.
“Surely you control the weather,” Clint said, sharp blue eyes focused outside as he stood by the window, being the only Avenger standing asides from Tony. He couldn’t help it. The outdoors just looked like a scene from an upcoming apocalyptic movie, something straight out of one of the Avengers movie nights that Jan insisted on having as team bonding.
“No funny business.”
“Served my tour, this is a little break for me. Working alongside the police is a dream .”
I am lost.
“You see, I survived the accident, Reed. All this time I’ve been right here, continuing my plans. At first I sought a few items for my own creations; metal parts, money, emeralds – they weren’t just for vanity, they were all for my plans to create the ultimate robot and build my kingdom. But every time I tried to obtain these materials you and your pesky robot were in my way!”
“Shut down!”
That didn’t matter now.
Quickly he placed his thumb to his ear and his pinkie by his lips, the silver rod extending from the top of his hat.
“I’m surprised you haven’t used this place as a hiding place before. Seems empty.”
“You are compromising the safety of these people as a superhero, you will be destroyed.”
Civilians began to leave their homes and resume their natural state, although to their horror there were some portions of the city that had been destroyed overnight by the on-going conflict between superheroes and berserkers. Luckily they were in the safety of the high walls again.
“Let go of me Steve… Let me fix this, please.” There was silence. “Please…”
Steve felt his legs rocking, he could hear them creaking and he tried to get a footing, but it wasn’t easy. It felt like he was just learning to walk again, putting one foot in front of the other slowly but surely. The entire time Tony had his arm wrapped around Steve’s torso, just under his arms to help him stay upright. Un-level surfaces were hard to walk on as it was, Tony couldn’t begin to fathom how it felt for Steve while they were surrounded by a surface that moved under the slightest pressure. Whenever Steve felt unsteady, Tony’s grip tightened, his fingers curling into the remainder of the uniform that was left on Steve’s upper half.
Bucky knew that he was the most agile of the two, and used Steve to help climb closer, grabbing onto the panel of the bomb and flinging it open, watching the door fly off and plummet to the ground, causing him to make a loud swallow. Of course there was hesitance in his motion, and he knew he had to be careful with it, but the sooner he could get it done, the sooner that they could go back home. Steve approached with the same mind-set, carefully trying to amble his way up and fight the air resistance that was pushing him back to reach Bucky’s side.  Before he could, there was a loud beeping and he saw his sidekick’s fingers begin to move quicker. “Cap, Cap it’s going to blow!”
“Jarvis, get into the systems. Give me vitals.”
“Oh I think I’ve found one…”
“Yeah, well, depends what we find but that’d make things much easier. Why didn’t Oscorp think of that? Oh wait, like they care about the environment,” he rolled his eyes, seeing a searchlight drift by. “Quick!”
one and only?”
“What?”
There he stood in front of him, armoured legs that looked all too familiar. They were his design after all. He remembered working on them, spending hours trying to get them correct, making them lightweight and agile with powerful propulsion systems. His eyes moved upward to the hips that were the same set of pieces, then the abdomen which had each plate to form a defined sculpt with each crease having a natural curve. That was where the armour ended to reveal his star covered chest – rather than being robotic armour, that was a skin tight Kevlar with scales, one that he had also been developing specially for one person.
“Yeah I…” He rubbed his head. “Steve! Where’s the food?”
“No, you can barely walk, yet alone look after yourself.”
“You’re starting to sound a lot like Barnes, with that sort of talk. You know, when he was brainwashed and all.”
“I’ve heard Black Bolt speak more than I’ve heard
“What do you mean malfunctions? Tony, what’s going on? So this is after the bruises are relatively healed?”
Steve sat up where he was, his hand moving to cup Tony’s face and look at him straight in the eyes. The last thing he could remember was seeing him engulfed in fire, but that was probably the same fire that took him. He recalled the pain in his heart that day, the exact same feeling that Tony felt. Upon watching Tony slip off his own gauntlet, looking at his hand back and forth, examining it in his regular curious manner, Steve copied him and removed the gauntlet to reveal his augmented hand too.
“Go and check it out, if you need help, I’m here. So are Carol, and the others. Call us.” He said, walking eagerly to join Carols side before she would zoom off without him, she already looked as though she were ready to. He needed to fill her in too, just in case.
“Come on, now…” Steve pried more sternly.
A civilian walked by and without even stopping to think about it, Steve grabbed the young man and began chomping away. There were loud screams from nearby and Tony ran to join Steve, helping him tear open the bowls of the person that they had taken down.
“Tony I want your wings to be normal again; I want to take you up there with me, up to those gates.” He said, pulling back and opening his eyes, staring into Tony’s wide sapphire eyes.
“Wait, you weren’t sure!?”
Steve’s arm flailed and a bullet shot out, shattering the glass ceiling. Norman’s attention was brought to it right away, the heavy rain entering the building whilst the thunder rumbled above.
Fury of course, wasn’t one for demands, especially from Tony; nonetheless, given the situation, he gathered the tools and gave them all to Tony.
The clanks of metal flooded the small quarantine room, large thuds and growls as Steve snapped at the bar, his once perfect teeth chipping away to reveal a more jagged edge each time he attempted to chomp at the metal beams that composed the first bot. Tony cringed with each loud screech of metal rubbing against the bone.
“Hey Steve, I also… Noticed that you were into drawing, the way you doodle constantly in the car when we’re on patrol, and you know NYC has plenty of art galleries open. What say we head to one, one day?”
“But sir, he has triggers, even in his own time. Yes the easing process will be much better once we figure out a way to get him up to date by speeding up development and time for him in that mind simulator, but for now we’re focusing on trying to cure the lingering effects from the War. Once we manage to help him with those, then we’ll manage to start the time speed. But recently he’s been having severe panic attacks.” The lab assistant gestured to the screen, and on it was Steve in that street, clutching his head, gritting his teeth, down on his knees as ringing sounded through his head. The flashes of Bucky drifting away and falling into the ocean, leaving them behind flew rapidly through his thoughts.
T’challa rolled his eyes at Tony while Reed tackled that judgemental look that Tony had braced himself for. Slowly he wiped his hands on his already oil-stain covered white tank top that he was used to working in.
“Something’s been happening to people... Stark. We don’t know whether it’s this chemical making them crazy but after a while, after the incident, people started going on killing sprees. You know who the first victims were? Heroes. These regular folk started attacking all of the Avengers. The team had to disperse, but every day a new body gets brought in.”
“And what are you hesitant to do, or say?”
“Steve? You can, you can hear me?” That was the first time he had heard the soldiers voice speaking normal words in days. “Steve?”
Hammer staggered back with an undignified, “WOA-OA-OAH!”
Tony nodded eagerly and positioned himself, raising his hips over Steve’s lap, gripping his firm muscular thighs for support, trying to prevent his sweaty palm from sliding across the metal.
“I thought— “
“I can show you the world~” Tony chimed. Steve just stared, confused as to why the man had suddenly seemed to burst out into song. The director tried to shrug it off and laugh, imagining what Steve’s reaction to the wonderful world of Disney would be. He made a mental note to take him to Disney world.
“I don’t want pity, Steve.” He replied with a low voice.
I am a murderer, revelling in pain of my long lost loves.
Janet gasped when she noticed Tony’s arm, her hand rising to cover her mouth in horror, even more so when she scanned Steve and noticed his legs too – it was then she knew it was serious. When Steve Rogers was taken down, she knew in her mind that the situation was dire. Then again, she was still getting over her own loss-
“Long journey up…” Natasha replied, staring out of the glass windows and watching as the city began to get smaller and smaller, the shrinking buildings and the even tinier blips that were the drones outside along with tiny explosions where Clint was clearly taking care of the drones.
“My name is Tony Stark – Anthony Edward Stark, alias: Iron Man and this… Well, is my diary? Captain’s log, some could say.”
“No no, I’m taking a picture, Cap!”
Steve tore himself away from the screen and turned to the food, eating just as he did before, quietly huddling the food to himself and trying to make it last this time. As much as he wanted to take slow bites and chew it all it was as though his body was trying to fight against him at that point and began tearing and ripping at the food. “I’m so hungry…” He muttered between bites.
“Newbie!” A voice called from across the room – it was the man who had been drinking out of the coffee pot earlier holding a bunch of keys in his hand. “This’s yours!” He threw them over the few desks that were in the way, Steve caught them easily.
POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION
“You were supposed to help me back before Zola—“
“Wouldn’t have it any other way.” They took a few more steps together until they reached Steve’s bedroom door. Tony knew he’d have to part ways with the man, groaning at the thought of leaving the comforting warmth and departing from the firm yet secure grip as well as the Captain’s distinct smell of (oh so American) apple pie with a hint of cinnamon and the bitter faint after-smell of gunpowder.
There was no better gift than love.
His sleep was broken by a loud noise. The second he looked up, he spotted a few of Zola’s monsters attacking a golden and black metallic figure that he could barely make out given how dark the lab already was, but it was the light rose shimmer from the centre of the figures chest that confirmed that it was indeed Tony who had come to his rescue yet again.
I let him fall; I stood by his body and protected it with all of my might as I laid my eyes upon the sleeping prince who my heart had yearned for. He would have saved and protected me; he would’ve looked after me… I know he would have, he wouldn’t have just left. A man of loyalty with a reputation of loving so tenderly, that’s who I wanted to be with, that’s the guy who would protect me from everything. He’d known about my father and told me a little of his too, and I’d researched the rest in the files that were left. We were so similar and I know he had nothing but a pure heart, after all this was the guy I wanted to be like when I was a kid, this was the very man who my father used to prattle on and on about, searching for him. In a way, I think my father lost himself the second that Captain America had fallen off the face of the earth so it seemed and I think that was what pushed him into his work, trying to create a substitute, a deterrent just as Captain America was supposed to be. Cap was made to be a weapon as the ultimate soldier and thus the best weapon that the US had ever produced and without him, my father was forced to find another way around protecting the US. So basically, after the war, I destroyed the best weapon the US had. Once again tarnishing my father’s work and succumbing to the darkness and foul habits that plagued me. He was my one light, the man who kept me company, and he was gone.
Visions of the Captain appeared, fighting him, hiding from him, running from him – everything was unclear, a blur where all he could see was Steve…
The next morning Steve was in the kitchen of the mansion, with the others happily going about their day and exploring the new place, as well as settling in. It was nice for once to hear the busy chatter.
“I know… You’re better.”
Unsurprisingly, there was another flinch the closer he loomed to the wound. “I’m going to take that chip out completely. I’ve done it to Peter and I’ve done something similar to Carol and Jessica, so I know what I’m doing.” He knew Steve didn’t need reassurance, but he provided it anyway.
STATUS: POSSIBLE INFECTION. QUARANTINE PROTOCOL MAINTAINED.
“He’s going to have to make me a brand new suit and get me a new set of wheels for me to forgive him this time.” Rhodey joked, as serious as the situation was, but it helped. After all, the Commandos would do exactly the same thing, even in the darkest situations, as much as they made jokes, they took the situation extremely seriously.
“Didn’t hit the core, I must’ve missed by a few inches, but that’s where-”
“This has to be one of the best days of my life.” Tony spoke with such elation, his hands flailing with excitement as the camera pointed toward the sleeping Steve, then back at him. “Best days… Ever!”
QUARANTINE BREACH
“Oh shut up, Hammer, I am done with your whining…” Killgrave spoke from the centre of the machine.
“Steve! Hold your shield up!”
“Don’t preach to me.” Tony snapped. He’d hated religion for a while. He was accepting of others beliefs but when people tried to push them on him, that’s when he started to get agitated.
“Yep.”
“I don’t… I don’t remember… I just…” Steve stuttered, his fingers skimming over his torn flesh that wasn’t bleeding at all.
Then there was a loud sound from behind him.
It was then it clicked.
Steve with a begrudging movement offered his arm to Tony who carefully pierced his skin with the injection and began administering the transfusion, a longer chord attaching from his suit to the syringe that had much more blood, but to his surprise Steve’s body seemed to soak up the blood rather quickly. It was as if he was giving water to someone who had been dehydrated; it was a matter of moments before the entire pouch of blood had been drained and Steve had regained a little more colour to his skin, even his hair was once more accumulating that golden shimmer.
Slowly he reaches for Tony’s hand, even though it’s difficult to pry his arm away from around his shoulder, and slips the ring on. Tony had never before been so eager to kiss those heart shaped lips that were dusted with the aftertaste of sweet chocolate. Steve returns the passionate kiss until they have to part their lips to take in a breath of air. Then the claps of the others followed.
Steve rolled his eyes and grabbed Tony by the arm, walking into the elevator and looking from side to side. “How about we fly up?”
Steve rubbed his cleanly shaven chin, biting the inside of his lip with a pensive furrow if his brow. “You got any details?”
“You know Steve, I would’ve gotten back to you, but I need to save Peter first.”
“Got it. I’m recharged anyway, have faith in me boys, I’ve managed to handle Whirlwind on my own.” She flicked the top of Tony’s head and pat Steve’s arm before heading off, shrinking her size again and buzzing into the distance. Tony and Steve were both worried for her. It wasn’t as if they’d spent a long time outdoors resting to regain their energy, but it put Steve at slight ease when Tony had fixed some sort of distress system, meaning hopefully they wouldn’t be separated for long. There was strength in numbers, and Steve needed to make sure that there were no extreme casualties like Hank – who was clearly unable to join them in the fight against Hammer until he recovered.
“Protect me? From what?” Tony asked as his eyes remained widened, slowly raising his arms and awkwardly patting Steve on the back. What else was he supposed to do? Steve seemed so distraught for some unknown reason so the least he could do was try and comfort him a little.
“Stark’s put these out a little early for Halloween, it’s only July…”
“That sounds best, so it’ll just have to be us. Who do we have? Carol, Natasha, Thor, Clint, Janet, Steve and of course… Moi.” Tony puffed out his chest proudly as he tried to take control of the situation in the way that Steve would. “So you return to the others, Vision, tell them where we are.”
Tony’s eyes drifted to the floor again and he tucked in his lower lip, “You know, I stopped believing in that stuff…” There was no point expanding when Steve apparently knew.
Steve stared up from his possessions with a hollow glare, trying at least fathom all he had been told.
I am a shattered reflection of my father.
“I’m glad that came off in the wash...” He muttered to himself, saying the same old fashioned sayings that Steve used to tell him after an argument. But he knew that bloodstains wouldn’t just come off in the wash, no, they’d be with him forever. He would try and scrub at the American flag that was once hanging tall, flying atop of the roof terrace of Stark Tower, with rips and tears from the harsh weather conditions that it had endured and yet it would still fly and beam with pride. Now it was stained with blood and Tony made sure to take it within his two hands and scrub so desperately to clean it, but only ended up tearing it more, and yet, he couldn’t just throw it in the trash; he kept it in his office, tucked into his desk drawer as he tried to hide from it, but there was no hiding from the harsh reality he was surrounded by.
“Tch.”
Tony hopped out of the car, feeling the urge to skip out, actually. He couldn’t have had a better night, and the fact that Steve had agreed to going out with him some time really made him buzz with joy, not to mention a touch of anxiety, worrying over what he was going to wear already. Of course he’d wear his signature hat and coat, but what suit? The choices were endless. It would have to be something designer and top notch, even though he knew by now that Steve didn’t care about designer brands. Still, Tony would give Steve nothing but the best.
Everything was on loop, a systematic loop that would change when the scientists added more variables to the equation. This was all to keep him safe, all to keep him in his bubble not only because he wasn’t ready for the world of
“Wait, Tony, hold on… I just noticed something.” The alternate armoured version of Steve stepped back.
He just wanted Steve back to normal.
“Osborn!” Steve shouted at the top of his lungs whilst the newly powered reactor in his chest began to fizzle and spark with energy.  His hair soaked, falling over his eyes as he stood with his fists tightly clenched.
“You know the guys an eccentric.”
Tony and Steve nodded, shooting and slamming anything that came near them, creating a path for Janet and Natasha to follow, approaching the huge metal doors that belonged to the upper lab.
“Sounds to me like it definitely is,” Steve replied firmly.
It was hard to get a proper view of him, but there was a strange tint to Taskmaster’s eye colour. His iris seemed outlined with purple, which did indeed pull at Steve’s need to investigate, but he couldn’t tell at this point whether it was just his vision failing him. After all, the skies above seemed to be painted with the same purple; the grey of the clouds appeared more violet, some with outlines of indigo. It was difficult to draw conclusions, but Steve had a resounding sense of déjà vu ring through him, but he didn’t have time to linger. Just as he was buried in a moment of thought Taskmaster ran at him with a full fist, which Steve quite easily sidestepped before knocking him down, giving him the last blow; striking an elbow to the back of the head to send himto the ground like a fallen dummy.
Maybe he’d spoken too soon.
Tony wasted no time going for Steve’s tie, followed by his shirt after desiring to strip him of it ever since he had first kissed him, letting it unveil a fine specimen of a man; carved muscles that lifted and sunk with every single breath he was taking. Even in the dim light Tony noticed how it had a faint pink blush that extended from Steve’s cheeks down his muscular torso, but when he pressed the pads of his fingertips along the pectorals he felt that it was surprisingly soft. Nothing like he was expecting, and yet, even more desirable, it was silken and opulent.
“It was blown off in the explosion.” Nick said calmly. “You were out for 5 years, Stark.”
“No…” he whispered, pushing the gate open and running into the courtyard, staring at what was around him. He decided to go with his gut, as twisted as it was at that very second, and ran inside.
“I feel like you’re going to make me fall into a trap door here.”
“All over the world.” Stephen Strange added as he held his hands up.
I’m not the man you all think I am.
The words were filled with conviction, filled with hope and power. This was something Tony was setting his mind toward. Hurting Steve was the last straw. He leaned closer to the torso of his suit, fixing the new and improved spinal clamp. “We’ll go to the tower and this will be the end of it, rescue Peter, save the others. The end.”
to die, I’d be honoured to die by your side. But no matter where we go, or what happens to us, I’ll find you in every reality, and I will love you in each the same. I’ll be with you forever Tony Stark.”
“You tried to bite me, Steve.” Tony spoke bluntly as a reaction to his shock.
“Me too, always have. You know, sometimes you get tired of running and you just want to stand up to them, but you know, in this case you can’t. But you want to. Sometimes it’s just being curious, like what would happen to me if I did just get caught.”
hungry?!”
Tony skimmed his hand over the back of his hat, rubbing it and then shrugging with a smooth, yet embarrassed grin on his face. “I uh, it’s sensitive tech, combusts a lot… Gotta have a handy dandy fire extinguisher, right?”
Critical eyes scanned each statistic with intense scrutiny. “He no longer requires oxygen… There’s very little haemoglobin left in his system at all.”
And he’d never gotten to really tell Tony…
The crowd that was by the entrance of the alleyway still hadn’t dispersed, watching the wide curious empty eyes stare at him as he stepped further out. He frowned instantly, giving them a growl and holding Steve protectively, huddling his head away from them and closer to his own chest. He staggered, still in pain from the previous fights. He knew he had to push through all of the pain to get the man he loved back into shape.
The words ‘confusion’ and ‘shock’ didn’t quite describe what Steve was feeling at that moment.
Steve was pummelled outside into the rain, shards in his back, on the floor around him as Tony stayed on top of him, punching him, beating him bloody against the mud that he had landed on. Cap grabbed Tony’s good hand and pushed him back, but Tony seized the opportunity to shove Steve down into the ground. He lifted his arm and brought his elbow down with a loud-
you?” Tony implored.
“Don’t leave me... It wasn’t worth it, it wasn’t worth it!” He screamed.
Zola crashed to the ground with Tony on top of him, before he could escape from his body Tony was quickly trying to use Extremis to access any sort of system override so he could try and prevent him from doing so, a firewall of sorts, anything to make sure he didn’t escape that easily. Frankly, he’d had enough of dealing with the same lowlifes that were plaguing him and his friends and having Steve taken from him struck a chord in more ways than one. Steve was something special to Tony and always had been, despite their arguments and fallouts which only in the end fortified their bond, meaning that Steve would always have a place with him, and Tony would be extremely offended if anyone so much as touched a hair on the super-soldiers head.
“That’s insane, I can only imagine.”
“That’s right, Steve, remember,” Tony pleaded, staying stooped down on his knees in front of the man and placing his hands on his broad shoulders, trying to very cautiously edge toward the back of his neck where the chip was. If he could manage to try and get it out completely then that might stop this from happening. No wonder why Peter was so eager to let Tony get rid of his chip without a question, especially if this was the consequence. The thing is, he didn’t know how dependent Steve was on it, whether that would keep this neuro-destroying airborne toxin from destroying him. Again, Tony was reminded that it was because of his reactor that he was saved from it, and he did notice that Steve had a reactor in his suit; maybe, just maybe there was a chance that he wasn’t dependent on this chip and that he’d be able to survive without it.
“Oh… Never mind,” Tony brushed Steve off, proud of his own joke as he waited to get to the basement level, tapping his foot impatiently to the elevator music.
Tony could feel something entering his system, he could feel his blood becoming thicker as he coughed and spluttered out drops of black ooze.
Steve stared at him for a moment before returning back to his position, trying to sleep as best as he could.
“I don’t need you to save me! I have my team, I have my friends, and I have Steve!”
Once Jessica had scrambled off Carol, she got to her feet, Carol striding up to the fallen bot and punching her fist through a huge sheet of metal to sever its head from the rest of its body. She knelt down and pulled out some of the chips.
Steve leaned over to Tony, waving a hand in front of his dazed face and snapping his fingers to shake him out of his memories, Tony jumped and resumed listening to Doom. “Carry on…”
The command low toned made Steve purr, giving him another chaste press of lips and continuing with the smooth rub along him. He could feel Tony’s body lift in eagerness and his ankle hook around Steve’s own. He breathed him in, sharing their breath with such an intimately placed kiss, deciding to trail his lips to the patch of well-trimmed hair that framed Tony’s chin. Tony’s hands raised and cupped the back of Steve’s head, drawing him closer as he noticed whenever he came close, his stroking movements would pick up their pace.
“That’s a good one, what is that? A pickup line? Lemme tell you Cap, that lines pretty outdated.” Tony said with a laugh.
He walked up to one of the people that seemed to walk past in their group, giving them a light shove on the shoulder. They turned, looked at him, and then just carried on with the group, continuing with that blank stare.
“Oscorp made the augmentations before the government got super involved. They gave them to hospitals, and special augmentation clinics gave them to people, and then after that a select few were asked to submit. Superheroes and us, were asked to submit. The people weren’t asked at all, why ask them? They ain’t going to provide any use. Like your registration act, it’s like that. You give in and then you get to work with the government. Obsorn, Stane, Hammer, Bain – they’re the ones who submitted. We weren’t told about this, none of us were, we found out after the submission period ended. So we were shoved out, whether we liked it or not.”
loyal. He wanted the man that other nations adored; he wanted the weapon, the tank.
They both needed each other, they both had parts missing, they were both in dire need of being complete again and this affection was what Tony had been searching for. Steve needed it too, after waking up, trying to process everything himself.  It was as though their history together had led up to this moment, all of the battles, all of the arguments, and there they both were – in a rickety old hospital, trying to get back into full health.
Captain America.
“I won’t like you when you’re angry? Okay, so, Bruce must be even more pissed off that you’re stealing his lines now,” he said before blowing a strand of hair out of his face.
The rain continued to pelt down, the sinless drops of angels tears coating the damaged surroundings.
“Steve…!” He gritted his teeth. “I love you..!” He mouthed silently, over and over, in hopes of reaching his heart, his eyes brimming with tears. As a single tear trailed down his cheek Steve’s eyes returned back to their normal colour.
“No… It’s not, Tony. This is more than we had ever anticipated.”
There it was, that sickness boiling in his gut again, just like when he had woken up.
The sound of trickling water was the only sound in the entire room that Steve was locked in. Patterns and traces dancing down the curve of his back as water sprinkled from the shower head, his golden hair that was always perfectly styled now dripping wet as a mop of dirty blond over his eyes. Steve rested the palm of his hand on the tiles of the wall, just allowing the water to engulf him. The steam and mist from the warm waters, the only warm presence in the entire room, bringing him a sense of serenity.
“He’s smarter than we give him credit for, that’s for sure.” Clint replied. “You never know, this could have all been an act. Then again, I never believe the crap that these reporters go on about. How’d they know it’s Stark?”
“I’ll cover you!”
“Let the boys play, we have more important things to do.” Maria summoned them as she effortlessly strode forward ahead of them, past the junction in the hallway. Just round the left hand side Steve and Tony were on the floor.
The people outside stopped in their tracks, eyes opening as though they had just woken up, gasping for air and stumbling around, looking in sheer confusion.
“Tony, just take him down…”
Tony could see stars flying above his head, eyes rolling around, dazed from the fall. In fact, Tony was so dazed that even Steve could see those stars. At first he wondered if he was seeing things but then realised that there were little lights on the rim of the fedora that were projecting stars flying above him, just like a cartoon. Again, Steve had to stare for a second before brushing them away and grabbing Tony’s gloved hand and picking him up with a heave.
Hammer chuckled in the background. “You know what we’re going to do to you, Tony? My buddy, my pal?”
Much longer was an understatement.  Panic stricken and in a hurry, he dashes down the stairs without putting on socks. Socks are over rated in his opinion anyway. But he stops as he reaches the bottom of the silver spiral staircase (which by the way makes you extremely dizzy if you run down at high speeds) and remains perched on the last step.
Steve caught it with precision and injected the needle into the woman’s neck, watching her fall limp within a matter of moments.
Organs tasted juicy like fruit freshly plucked from a tree.
He shook his head and found his hand dancing fondly over the neatly folded bedsheets. He curiously sauntered over to Steve to peer over his shoulder, and was awestruck by the intricate drawing Steve was working on. “Is that me?”
“When we’re fighting, do you feel different with these?”
“Quiet.” Steve said. Tony nodded, knowing that was their signal for things to be stealthy. If they made a move out of place he knew that either more security would be alerted or the civilians would notice, and that was something they couldn’t afford. Reaching for a bottle that Tony had picked up on their way, he threw it to the other side, hearing it shatter.
Tony shook his head. “He’s been there for me all this time, he’s been carrying my weight on his shoulders for so long. I went to go and see him just before I came down here, actually. It helped clear my mind just a little. I don’t know where I’d be without him… He’s helping up top, keeping things in order. You know he’s better at organising the troops than I am. I think it’s an armed forces sort of gist, they’re so used to that, the others.”
Tony heard the metal clank, an indication of the sharp movements that Steve was making. He pressed himself forward, reaching his arms up and then touching the area at the back of Steve’s neck to see what he had to deal with.
He could feel a shiver down his spine and brushed it off as the after effects of the release of emotion,  then he felt it again, a touch to his back. His eyes fluttered open slowly, turning around very carefully as he spotted Steve’s arm, curved around him. Panic washed over the blissfull feeling and he stared at Steve, who still had his eyes shut.
“Tony, there’s-“
“Not here for your dirty work.”
Steve’s palm smacked his own forehead hard enough to make a sound, frustrated by Tony’s banter, and he hesitantly peered through his fingers to see the detective flashing the toothiest of grins.
Tony wasn’t a religious man but when good things happened, he needed to thank someone. After all, there weren’t many good things in his life, all considered. But Steve was one of the best things— no, he was
“What?”
Steve walked to the glass and pressed his hands against it, as greasy as they were after eating. “Thank you.” He said with a genuine return of gratitude. Tony wasn’t sleeping at all because of him, and hearing that he’d fainted because of it saddened him. The overwhelming feeling in his gut wasn’t helping his attempts to sympathise, though. He felt boiling in his stomach and moved to sit back down, feeling weakened with the lack of food, even though he had just eaten enough for three people.
“That thing… You know, I couldn’t really ask anyone else. I knew I’d probably get a sassy answer or slapped in the face, those augmentation things… They’re pretty personal, right? I’ve never had one, nor do I ever want one, but I’ve just always wondered… How they feel.”
“I am modified for perfection,” came the reply, clear and simple.
He waved his hand, his mouth preoccupied by guzzling down the black liquid. Steve could do nothing at that point but raise his eyebrow questioningly.
Such a cold name; Patient Zero. It dehumanised Steve to little but a lab specimen. Although the others had lectured Tony time and time again about detachment to people that they were working with, they all knew that it was impossible for Tony to pull himself away from his childhood hero like that. It was as though he were talking to a brick wall.
“It’s amazing what huge mobs of murderous civilians can accomplish.”
“I’m going to look around…” Tony whispered, pulling back and letting Peter pay his respects. He needed to see who else had died but most of all, he needed to find the stone he was looking for. Taking long, careful strides to weave between the disorganised stones, he set his eyes on a range of names that he was familiar with;
Both T’challa and Reed shot Tony an identical dumbfounded glare.
It was those drops that drizzled over the huge metal bar that was just on top of Tony. A gentle stream of water made its way down the side of the rusted bar towards its edge, reaching the jagged corner before cascading momentarily in the air until it met with Tony’s eyelid. More drops followed, one by one, landing on Tony’s eyelids.
That was the best apology he was going to get. Steve could tell that Tony wanted more, but instead patted his back to signal that if he pushed Fury further he’d probably get a knock in the teeth judging by the chief’s temperament.
“I was there, Peter. He was right next to the bomb.” Tony’s voice raised an octave, his heart raced as he talked about the super soldier.
He began to continue walking through the streets, trying to stay close to the walls and alleys, at least then he wouldn’t attract any attention; not that he’d be noticed if he wasn’t flying around shooting lasers, especially by these sorts of people.
“Yes, I helped. Though I wasn’t the entirety of the brains behind it, but I helped. You know…technically, that means I’m the one who made you as great as you are.” Tony chuffed with pride, patting the glowing centre of his suit. “So, how would you like to work for me, Tony Stark, considering that you owe me?”
“What?” Tony tilts his head.
spotted, we’d have to abort the mission and ask Strange to wipe their minds for us…” Steve held a hand to his chin for a moment. “We’re not exactly
“This is far too fishy, what’s to say Osborn isn’t behind all of this?”
Tony had remembered he’d programmed it differently, it didn’t run on the run of the mill software – this was something that he had worked long and hard for, including a chip that made it impervious to viruses.
“Those are my boys, you’ve got Dum-E, Microchip, and that one with the arms is… Arms… I built them myself, pretty impressive, no?”
Clint looked from side to side. “Now, who’s going to clean up this mess?”
“Exactly, whoever planted the bomb intended it to destroy the people who came to this hospital.”
There was no way in hell Steve could move his legs, not with that damage. Tony could see nerves, he could see where they had been severed and were just hanging on by tendrils of muscle – the bar landing on top of them forced the bone out and destroyed them. He was no biologist but if even he could see that just by initial observation he knew something was most certainly wrong.
Peter pushed the gate open, with the broken chain that was supposedly to keep the park off limits hung loose. The clatter of chains against the iron bars made the sound echo even louder  and caused a haunting chill to spiral up Tony’s spine. After the ex-billionaire shuddered he walked inside, now seeing makeshift tombstones made out of things like bricks and planks of rotted wood with carvings where benches used to be, and children used to play.
to see. The last person he had wantedto hear; the real Tony.
. Next.”
“Avengers, assemble!”
“Two” Tony continued.
Suddenly calling Bucky bionic man because of his arm didn’t seem so funny anymore.
“It’s possible.” Reed considered that but was beyond curious, wanting to learn more about what exactly was pushing Steve’s blood through his body with a lack of functioning circulatory system. He needed to investigate. By a force of habit his thumb pressed lightly into his temple, rounding in a massage motion to somehow provoke further thought on the matter.
“That’s got nothing to do with it. You just… Please, believe me. I can’t tell anyone but you, you’re the angel, you’re like me. I don’t know what happens when angels tell humans that they’re angels…”
“You’re a doctor, and she’s extremely smart! I’m sure you don’t need a doctor to tell you if your child is sick.”
“Tony and I are one, we are the same. We share thoughts, and the conclusion is that you are out dated, and must be exterminated. Survival of the fittest. You are the original and now with a new and improved serum based upon your own, Tony and I shall be superior.” It spoke, throwing Steve back to the ground and kicking his stomach hard.
Just under the rim of Tony’s cap a small flap opened up, and sliding down were a pair of black sunglasses that fitted firmly and comfortably on the bridge of Tony’s nose. He stared forward, what Steve couldn’t see was that the pair of ordinary looking sunglasses actually had a radar system, on it were a few green blips and of course the robber was the one that was going far quicker than the others, trying to get away before any other police cars neared.
Steve smiles to Tony’s retort but feels the wall he’s chained to start to vibrate. “Tony..!” He let out a cry of warning.
Internally his thought process was wondering why this door wasn’t opening at all. At some level, he realized parts of his brain had shut down, certain segments misfired wildly. He could still think, he could still feel a knot in his chest whenever he looked up at the blood drenched muscular man that dragged his feet over next to him. He wondered if Steve could feel the same, thinking to himself that he probably could.
“I think I love you…” Tony muttered tiredly, barely audibly.
That didn’t negate the fact that it was a talking dog, which really didn’t help ease Steve’s confusion any, even with the explanation. Still, everything in the lab that he was standing in needed explaining. He’d never seen anything like it in his entire life. He curiously moved over to a lava lamp and prodding it, as though that was the strangest thing in the lab.
“O-over-ride… Shut down protocol.”
“I know this is a lot to take in. And I want to help you, I feel since I’ve taken over from old man Fury, that it’s my duty to.”
“What happened?” he asked in a whisper, unsure if he should ask that question in the position that he was in. But a pure interrogation wasn’t his style, he had to get answers for himself, especially since this was taking far too much of his time up.
“Seems so. These subsidiaries aren’t run by anyone but him, and…Look…”
“Tony…” Steve finally spoke, drawing his eyes away from the hologram of the man on the operating table. “Waking up to find out your girlfriend… I mean, I’ve been in the same situation. If we’re exchanging stories…” It was Steve’s turn. “I lost my partner while we were on patrol once, fighting a huge neo-Nazi gang. We’d managed to take them down but… It was on Brooklyn Bridge. We took them out but they’d cut our brakes and we flew off. My partner, Bucky Barnes, probably the snarkiest fella that I’ve ever had the pleasure of working alongside, I’d do anythin’ for the guy – we were practically brothers – anyway he managed to unlock my side of the door and unclicked my belt, left me to float out free whilst he was… Dragged down with the car. Strangely enough, they never found his body… I know it’s not the same as yours, but we both lost people we care about on duty.”
“Sounds rather possessive.” Steve couldn’t help but smirk. Maybe he enjoyed the banter a little too much.
Quickly, Tony cupped his hand around her, drawing her out before she returned to her full size. The shock was too much for her small frame and with that she was unconscious.
His breathing quickened, his body felt numb but he knew that he had to do it. This was the only chance he had if Steve’s condition continued to worsen.
Tony couldn’t take it any longer, the butterflies in his stomach had amplified to a hurricane and he tried to gracefully lift his leg up, attempting to push Steve’s underwear down with the constant brushes of his foot against the fabric, reliant on the friction. Steve didn’t hesitate to assist, trying to wriggle and twist out of his own star spangled boxers, letting it hang down before hesitantly removing a hand from Tony’s plush skin to toss them off, allowing Tony to give them one final shove off with his ankle.
Suddenly, a large suit of armour stood up just behind them and reached for Tony’s head, but Steve couldn’t and wouldn’t let that happen. With all of his might, he swung his shield, knocking the arm back and then throwing himself at the huge bot. It was clear that Hammer had tried to mimic the Hulkbuster with the huge, clunky design.
Tony stares for a moment, blinking wide eyed as he looks up at the man.
Now he was ready to go. But to try and look discrete or to be noticed was the new question on his mind. Who was he kidding? He was Tony Stark; of course he’d be noticed. That was pretty much out of the question.
He tried to brush the blood away but only ended up smearing it, chastising himself internally.
“Of course, Tony.” Reed reassured him, pulling away from the screens to walk to a hidden part of the medical bay. He swiping his card and typing in a PIN for the metal wall to fold back. This in turn revealed a quarantine room that they’d built in case of an emergency. Tony was well-prepared for situations like this, yes…but never did he ever think that he would have to use this room on someone he held so dearly.
“Plug the reactor… Into the machine…” He said with the last ounce of his strength.
“Of course I will, Steve Rogers..!” Tony exclaims, unable to hold back his excitement any longer. He holds out his arms and throws himself at the Super Solider as he gets to his feet. Steve almost loses grip of the box he holds, Tony was really that eager and excited. Just the reaction he was hoping for.
The man in the blue armour took off his futuristic looking helmet, shaking out his blond hair.
The man in the blue armour stared, a tiny smile over his own lips. “At least they went out together…”
“I would’ve thought as much. This is the best part.” Steve beamed.
Steve nodded, hand resting over Tony’s shoulder too, walking alongside him and listening to him talk about progress and technology, and how his company was the pioneer for the future, including its progress into prosthetics and augmentations to help those in the medical industry. Though it was all extremely difficult to swallow Steve felt enlightened by the prospects that were introduced to him, and couldn’t wait to learn more – he felt like a sponge willing to soak up everything that was placed in front of him.
“You leave that alone, Osborn!!” Tony’s cry turned into one of desperation.
“My eye… It’s buzzing… It hurts!” She screamed with unbearable pain as the sensation of needles piercing her covered eye was the closest description to the sensation that she was experiencing.
Once he was done he pushed himself up from the floor, dragging his feet and letting his blood coated hands fall, trailing blood behind him as he walked around trying to sniff out more food. That’s when he spotted him; Steve was hunched over a mangled body that he couldn’t even identify. The soldier had really gone all out on him, smashing his head in completely. It was only the ID that lay strewn to one side with some tattered fabric that gave the identity of the man away – the mangled cape made Tony’s already paling eyes widen sharply. How Steve had managed to take down Doctor Strange was a question all in its own – probably an ambush, knowing the tactician. There were tentacles probably from defence laying around, but it had seemed that Steve had managed to take down a man with power of an epic proportion. He had achieved the impossible,
“Steve?”
“Oscorp.” Steve finished off.
Becoming Iron Man had changed him. It had instilled more compassion into him, ever since recovering from being a monger of death he certainly wanted to prevent it. Bombs should’ve been his forte; the key word being
“Not too long.” Tony yawned. “How’re you feeling?”
The lights began to flicker.
Tony stretched his arms out until he heard that distinct crack of each knuckle and then mirrored the motion with his leg. He wiggled one toe after the other and then rubbed his eyes once more with the side of his hand.
“I’ll enjoy this, Tony Stark…”
It was strange to feel this overwhelmed with emotions over something that felt so surreal. He knew he would wake up and this would be a dream, in fact that was his worst fear, that this moment would end. He was drowsy already and probably drunk on tiredness, but as long as it felt real, that’s all that mattered.
“No what?”
“I thought it was all phooey. But I guess the old man hadn’t lost as many marbles as I had initially thought.”
“Are you blaming me?!”
“You okay there? Captain?”
“Well we’re not going to risk it in the sewers again, and I don’t think I could sleep in there.”
“C’mon, c’mon…” Steve whispered under his breath, desperate to catch up with Tony. All things considered he was actually worried about him, wondering if the driver had a gun, then Tony would really be in trouble.  They could only slip up so much before they were caught out, Steve knew that for sure. But it was no use; the car wouldn’t go any faster.
“Then finish.”
“You two, go on! We’ll cover you!” Janet yelled.
Fury could silence her with just a glare, his hands resting behind his back with a clip of his heels echoing on the metallic floor beneath him.
“Believe it will and it might.”
Tony stared up at him. “Keep your voice down…” He zipped up the suit to hide the mark.
They were lucky he didn’t upgrade his speaker system.
“Set the computers to observation.”
“Well, Tony is right. Police regulatory rules state nothing of the colour or accessories that are attached to the car, so long as it bears the crest of our police force and meets the speed requirements which this new model apparently surpasses, by far.” Reed stated from his corner. “Though, you must be a good driver, Mr. Rogers, I know Tony wouldn’t trust anyone with fast vehicles after… The accident.”
It screamed with jealousy, twitching and firing in absurd directions and trajectories.
He walked toward Zemo; the man was much leaner than Crossbones was, which made him easier to demonstrate on. He lifted up the purple mask to reveal the man’s neck, and then pulling out the acrylic shard. Crossbones raised his gun out of the holster.
Tony spotted Steve surrounded by fire in the centre of the room.
“Don’t blame yourself Steve, we’ll find who did this and we’ll hunt them down. I promise you.” He spoke with conviction, comforted by the touch near the arch of his spine. He pulled back to press their foreheads together.
“He’s going to feel that in the morning!”
“You need to move on.”
“Yeah.”
“Go go Stark repulsor blast!”
Kneeling down, he slipped the boot covers over Steve’s legs, even though he heard his back crack when he did so. Grimacing in pain he shook it off. Slowly continuing placing the boot over the metallic foot and looking up at Steve. It seemed so much like a fairy tale.
, a lag in response, he could
He rolled his eyes, sucking on his teeth, “What’d you see this time, oh great angel?”
Steve snarled and reached around his back for his shield; now Tony knew he’d really found a sore spot and he was going to poke it until he’d gotten some answers. He couldn’t beat him on strength, that much was clear, so Tony would have to find some way to break him down. The armoured blond furrowed his eyebrows and lifted his shield, without ground to stand on he was fully reliant on his force.
Peter laughed, “If only. Then I could just walk out the cinema and write a terrible review and it’d be over.”
Tony decided he’d need to push forward before more of these things came at him since he’d cleared a path but didn’t know how long exactly that would last, so he raised his legs off the ground, placing pull power in his thrusters and just used himself as a human battering ram. “Thank you Juggernaut!” He yelled as he pushed through the oncoming hoard and right to Zola.
Instead of parting ways, Tony just held Steve’s hand tighter and stared at him lovingly, with the utmost affection.
“I wouldn’t make such an assumption.” Black Panther said from the seat behind Tony. “Political tensions have reduced between Latveria and the USA significantly. Victor Von Doom would not risk the truce at present.”
“Our home… That was our home, Steve.” He gestured to the rubble, eyes starting to well up at the sight, quickly however his hand raised and swiped the tears before they had a chance to roll down his cheeks.
Obliging, the man took his place in the scanner while the beams of red light swept along his body, and surely enough his vitals were registered on the monitors. Reed then took that opportunity to compare with the vitals that he had previously glanced at, and then at Luke’s. “The scanner is working perfectly fine, Tony.”
“Not that you ever cared for History, be honest Peter. You were more into science and the arts, if you count photography as an art. That’s up for debate. I’m more of a pop art collector, I don’t particularly count it as an art,” Tony jested back. “And kid, this belongs to me. My suit, with custom additions that you’ve probably never seen before.”
“Steve!” Tony exclaimed, the life returning to his eyes.
“That… Doesn’t look good.”
“Hold on.” Steve held up his finger, waggling it at Tony. “Don’t get any ideas. And since when have you actually ventured into the laundry room? You’re the guy who just dumps it in your lab and gets your bots to clean it up.”
“Because there is something terribly wrong.” T’challa bluntly stated.
“It’s great! By the way, her name is H.E.L.E.N. She’s a companion AI to JARVIS, she’s your driver right now so I’d be nice if I were you, Rogers.” Tony replied with a proud smile. “Isn’t it amazing? I managed to create an AI in a matter of moments.”
That made him wonder; was this chip that was to prevent neural damage actually causing it rather than preventing it?
“You trusted me, that’s how. For that moment when you let me touch your wound, your foot, you trusted me.”
“Why don’t we show them the tribute room?” Steve nudged Tony and placed a hand on his shoulder, rubbing it softly.
Tony spun on his chair to glance over at the man. “As you may have noticed, the Captain is becoming much more aggressive—“
“Oui… none other than the marvellous V— “
A heavy sigh escaped Steve’s raindrop stained lips. “I’m on my way to find Stark, he’s in trouble.”
Tony could’ve practically leapt into Thor’s burly arms at that point, he was so glad to see that no one was injured severely. Instead, his pace only quickened until he was by their side, hanging his head after exhaling a deep sigh of relief filled with pent up emotion.
Steve grabbed it and heaved himself up with Tony’s help, once they were by the range of pulleys, out in the open Tony looped his arm around Steve’s waist.
“What’re you— “
Tony was a man of science, but he’d known with his previous work with Victor years in the past that the man was open to all sorts, and even teased his belief in magic, of which Tony had constantly mocked him for, as did Reed.
“Don’t blame me!” Tony stood up from his chair, stepping around his table and as close as he could to the glass. “I’m trying to help!”
“Wow that was… Quicker than expected. How are you feeling?”
“You get closer, and he’s losing more memories. You know, I can see them all here – on this screen.” Norman pointed. “Let’s get this one up, hmm, what is it now…? The moment he first had woken up and saw you.”
“You better take it easy, Stark, when we’re done with this you’re going to rest, you hear me?”
No, Tony had lost those that he had loved the most in the past; he couldn’t save them, he had lost his girlfriends in the past, all taken too soon purely because of his name, because of his legacy. Tony was the target of many attacks before joining the force; in fact those reasons encouraged him to follow the path of justice. He couldn’t lose someone else, especially not Steve.
“Retinal override!!” Tony screamed out, smacking the door with his fist. “Quickly!”
“That and… It’s another special day.”
The Robot paused momentarily, “I am a robot, love is… For humans.”
The director couldn’t deal with this, he got to his feet, grabbing his black cat suit and zipping it up. He would rather not be shouted at wearing nothing but his tighty whities. He’d been humiliated enough.
The director found himself leaning into Steve’s arms, resting. Focusing on his presence alone, letting everything else fade away, all of his worries dissolving in Steve’s strong arms. Over the course of the time they had spent together they had not only become best friends, but more than that.
Soon enough Hank McCoy had arrived, looking as dapper as he usually did in his lab coat, ready to get to work straight away. Tony was appeased when Hank began running samples, sending in bots to retrieve samples from Steve who at this point had no choice but to co-operate, though Tony begged Hank to keep the poking and prodding to a minimum. He had just managed to pacify Steve, he didn’t want to get his emotions up again.
“You could have gotten yourself killed!”
His head turned to the bot that he had dismantled before to create himself his own functioning arm. If he could do the same for Steve he knew he’d be able to walk again. So once more, despite the exhaustion, he pulled himself to his feet, dragging them and the stone from fallen rubble under his feet, reaching for the bot and dragging it back to Steve.
The smell of foam flew up Steve’s nose and made him cough, speckles flying everywhere over the green grass. He could feel all eyes on him that very moment as he turned his attention up to the woman who he had thought was behind him. Turns out she was next to him, too close, and while he was shaking off the foam he’d claimed a new victim – the little black cat and the lady were covered in the remnants he had wiped off carelessly off his uniform and face.
“Give me the stats on Captain Rogers.”
There was a powerful surge that shot through Steve’s arm augmentation, zipping up his body and through his armour. A huge shock that send him straight into convulses. Immediately the armoured soldier yanked his arm back out of the cavity in Tony’s chest, causing the fallen man to choke at the abrupt removal. Trails of blood streaked through the air from the crimson covered robotic arm. Steve’s entire body began to shake violently, and Tony had only hoped that the force was strong enough to fry whatever was controlling him. He could hear the chattering of teeth, the trembling sound of shaking metal. Opening his eyes as much as he could to watch Steve, even though that only pained him more.
“Mhm…” That grunt didn’t give much away, Fury didn’t seem impressed in the slightest at Steve’s display of loyalty, his face seemed to be stuck in a permanent frown with huge bags outlining his tired eye. That hard edged scruff didn’t help either as the Chief ran his fingers across it. “We have a special assignment for you.”
the billionaire thought, but sought to be peaceful. He’d just get this over with and keep the best interests of the team in mind.
Steve’s bright blue orbs widened in panic and he began to tap faster. Bomb defusing wasn’t his forte, that was more Gabe and Dino’s expertise, and it became even more difficult to focus when the floor was beginning to rumble, and the countdown activated.
Steve dropped the shield mid-pose, his jaw falling slack. That very second he could see memories in his mind going in reverse; starting with the most recent.
He groaned again, clutching his stomach as a pain seared throughout his body originating from his abdomen. Tony tried to scramble to his feet, apparently he wasn’t dead, but it took a lot of effort to get himself up. His entire body was stiff, and he couldn’t quite straighten out his neck. Thoughts and memories seemed to blur, everything was like he had just woken up from a dream of some sort.
“It won’t happen again, scouts honour…”
Sitting down there was like waiting in a bomb shelter, hearing the thunderous footsteps above them shift and move. Peter kept his eyes on the man hole cover, inching closer, though as Tony noticed him doing that he called the boy down. “Show me what you’ve had done…”
“This is our city, Inspector.” Steve said, gazing out.
This was the best dream he had ever had. In his life. Ever.
“…I know, I’m sorry.”
“Tony… Tony wait.” Steve called.
Clint continued to laugh, telling the others that walked in who joined him in a chorus of giggles, each patting Steve on the shoulder sympathetically. Steve didn’t understand. There were a number of questions popping into his head at that moment; who was ‘the detective’ and what was so terrible about him? Every time he received a pat or a squeeze on the shoulder he could feel another butterfly appear in his stomach. His lips lined strictly together and he gulped nervously, his eyes going back to the guy locked up behind those heavy silver iron bars.
Steve winced, knowing that the chief was going to yell at him for this, his eyebrows slanted in pain for the poor car. Tony didn’t stay in the car for long, though, instead he quickly darted back out and decided to try and balance on the hood of the car, making it harder and harder for Steve to see.
He could feel his heart in his throat, he knew something wasn’t quite right with Taskmaster, but he had to leave it and help his friend. He grabbed Masters by the hood, roughly, and pulled his body over to the nearest lamp post, reaching into his own utility belt to pull out a few rope ties.
They’d parked outside and used the car’s invisibility function, which was rather handy whilst they left it parked close by, with Steve and Tony standing next to the wall, peering around the corner now and then to make sure that the many security cameras couldn’t catch a glimpse of them.
“Hey, have some faith. It’ll work, trust me on this.” He placed the radio back into her hands safely. “If anything happens just press that button.”
“That’s not what I’m upset about.”
“I pulled out every trick in the book. At times I wished ‘geez, if only I could fly away from this person’, well now I can, but before that… I just didn’t have the capability. I drove as quickly as I could, and then… Would you believe it? I started heading back with Rumiko just over the Golden Gate Bridge, and that’s where it happened…”
Many geniuses are considered insane upon closer inspection; Einstein, Michelangelo, Lord Bryon and yet they were so respected for their work and because of their contributions to society that they were overlooked. And yet I had become part of a system with zero accountability and my work had become so transparent due to the millions of lives that were lost by my hands and my craft, which my respectability had been completely lost to and thus others sought to pry into my life and pressure me to breaking point. My contributions to society are overlooked and even as I try to do my best and push the company away from the image that my father had created and so they label me insane because I’ve been able to wash away what I’ve done in the past, as well as what my father had done, forever dwelling in his shadow as much as I try to reach toward the light. It seems the more that I reach for it, the larger the shadow becomes.
“He’s not saying a word and we’ve run tests in his lab. Marc was kind enough to provide us with some samples, but nothing has given us any clues as to what we’re facing. Zola is extremely unpredictable, his usual creations aren’t viral like this, nor do they contain possible contagions. Hanks taken the samples that we’ve gotten back to his lab too, and right now nothing has come back, no results at all, we simply don’t know what we’re facing here.”
“Then what?” He blinked.
“I’m sure you will, Rogers… Anyway, this is something we need you to take care in how you handle.”
Peter nodded, though he didn’t know much about the other woman. But if she managed to put the heebie jeebies into Tony Stark then it really was someone to worry about. But right now he was supposed to be angry at Tony, not sympathising with him. He huffed afterward to show his mood but something in the back of his mind was telling him that Tony was here for a mission, and he was just doing what needed to be done. Although they’d lost someone because of his mistake, pinning the blame wouldn’t do much good. He just decided to keep quiet and kept his head facing forward and walked along the dusty roads that obviously weren’t used too often, in fact this part of the city in comparison to where they just were was significantly different; broken buildings, rubble, bricks just lying there. But there were noticeably more trees whereas the other part seemed more like a concrete jungle.
Everyone knows that last second preparations are always chaotic, particularly around the holiday season. Last second nips and tucks to each tree, and then there are those who lie nearby and watch the busy bees work hectically, observing like cats on the prowl. It all depends what sort of person you are that decides how you go about with the holiday season.
“For now, just until we get there, let me show you a couple of things on my tablet.”
“You mean, Doom?”
“It’s his brain processing, sir, our systems are dictating a small anomaly.”
“I think the number increases every time I ask you.” Steve chuckled, shaking his head, and managing to get Tony up to his room, placing him down on the huge oversized bed that looked overly extravagant as usual, once more with an ornate golden headboard that had an iron man helmet each corner of the bed-stand.
Tony’s eyes remained focused on his image and he groaned, gargling up some fluid while his other hand touched his visible lower teeth, now exposed due to a lack of lip – the million dollar smile that was now probably worth less than a cent. Then he caught sight of Steve in the mirror standing next to him, holding on to him protectively, wanting to keep him by his side. There was that stare that seemed almost human, the small movements, and the subtle twitches in Steve’s face that reminded Tony that he was still the man he loved. They still looked perfect next to one another even in the state that they were in, at least in Tony’s eyes anyway.
As she grew, so did her weight. Tony’s arms began to sag before he got a firm grip of her, tucking her closer to his chest so that JARVIS could do some scans, make sure it was nothing vital. Tony knew for well how painful electric shocks could be, so empathy tinged his touch as he held her carefully against his chest.
She removed her cap once she was indoors and kept it under her arm, waving to a couple of the other cops and leading Steve throughout the maze of their precinct until they reached the main staff lounge and gestured for Steve to take a seat while one of the other men handed her a cup of coffee straight from the pot. It was then that Steve realised that she was clearly someone important, and respected, which only made him sit up straighter, his back not touching the back of the dark grey stained seat. By the looks of it someone had spilled their coffee on the chair he was sat on in the past, numerous times.  Not that there was anything wrong with stains; at least it was a little more homely, to a degree.
Another loud clang and then a clawed scaly monster grabbed his arm. Tony, fuelled by rage, spun around and shot out a cross of repulsors, cutting any of the remaining standing creatures with clean lines. Unintentionally some equipment was caught in the crossfire but at this point Tony could care less, it was a moment of distraction from Zola before he turned his head back to him and grabbed the vessel he was now trapped in. “Tell me what you did!”
The pain was too much to cope with. Even still under the control of the Purple Man, Tony could feel every single movement he could feel the blood being drained from him, the burning of his skin. The smell of burning flesh would haunt him for the rest of his life, he was sure of that.
He was eager to see how the arm worked, and how Tony dismantled it and changed it. At least the skill would come in handy in the future, and honestly, a little education was nice after spending so long on the run.
“Don’t call me director…” He grumbled. “I hate that job… God damn admin work all the time, you know how much red tape I have to go through, even in my position?”
Tony snapped out of it and looked around at the TV that was on behind him, the news of course, and then there was Jessica sitting down with one leg folded over the other crunching popcorn between her teeth, turning her head to look at Tony whilst Anya sat on the arm of the chair next to Jessica, reaching over to try and get some of the corn. Jessica frowned at her before getting a handful and chucking it at her playfully, making the younger girl pout before laughing, both of their attention turning toward the man who sat upright with a cold sweat dripping down his temple.
“Calm your bones…” Tony sighed, pulling out the acrylic shard and then beginning to make a small incision into the neck. The shard wasn’t the most hygienic thing to use but it was the only tool he had to work with. In the exact same place as Peter’s chip was, was the supposed ‘anti-toxin’ chip which he supposed everyone this day and age had in order to survive. “So, you know about the tracking in this thing huh? What’s it for?”
Steve exhaled a sigh, his hand going for Tony’s shoulder and rubbing it in gratitude. Tony couldn’t help but lean into the touch, like a kitten being rubbed under the chin, he smiled even more broadly and handed the remote back to JARVIS. “You keep this safe, disable it completely, wires and all.” That was when he turned to MODOK. “Where are they?”
He paced and paced like a cage animal but with slow steps, dragging his feet but mentally scolding himself whenever he did; he would hear his Sarge’s voice growling at him in his head, shouting and threatening to send him to the kitchens to peel the potatoes if he didn’t lift his feet when he was walking, if he didn’t keep his back straight, posture up, shoulders squared and sharp.
“You have to give him credit, he makes great robots. This looks way more life-like than his suits do.”
The journey was awkward, and Tony kept taking glances at Steve, opening his mouth as though he wanted to say something before stopping, doubting himself, internally reeling over the how Captain America sitting there was enough to shut him up.
Tony let out a quiet groan, trying to raise the white strap on his director’s uniform that he’d been working in, but it hurt to move his shoulder. There was a giant gaping burn creating a tear in the costume, but it wasn’t the uniform that worried Steve, it was the man inside it. “Come on director, I’ll get you patched up.”
Steve could never sleep. He had one or two hours because his body needed it, but he couldn’t sleep for lengthy periods of time which resulted in him spending time in the unfinished gym slamming his fists into the punching bag, full of regret and remorse for his fallen brothers in arms, or up in the living room flicking the TV channels trying to learn new things and get himself up to date with current events. He was a heavy reader, and Tony would always leave a book by his door every Monday morning without fail. They would be iconic books of their time, just so that Steve could get a nonbiased view and opinion of the modern day and age and struggles that people had faced. The director would usually send his secretaries to get things when it came to performing errands, and he most certainly preferred reading from a computer screen, but after Steve had helped him out through their missions countless times he decided to actually walk into a small bookshop himself, looking for the best sellers and taking them to the counter. The look of amazement that he usually received from the cashier during his first visits always made him chuckle, but in return he would flash her a charming smile, being polite as he always was. Tony Stark was a true gentleman, despite what the papers insisted on saying about him. Once he had the books he would return to the mansion, place them by Steve’s door with the usual card ‘
“All business? That’s no fun.” His hand rubbed down Steve’s bicep, giving it a testing squeeze, making a pleased “ooh” when he felt how rock hard the muscle was. “Fine, business first. We’ll fuck later.”
Tony crawled to the new carcass that Steve was working on, dragging his armoured legs along with him and joining him.
“Aaaah….” He held his hands out for the cat, “ahhh… ACHOO!” There it was, Tony sneezed loudly and flew back, crashing into a hedge sculpture of a giraffe. The cat meanwhile was so startled by the huge noise that Tony had made that it darted down the tree and jumped straight into Steve’s arms.
“I’ve got you Steve, I’ve got you,” he felt compelled to point out, biting on his lower lip, praising whoever it was that brought Steve back to consciousness.
“I hate goin’ with SWAT…” Clint droned. “Guys are so uptight…” He took another long sip from the pot.
“Just making sure…” Tony replied in a dizzy haze. “I need this.” An unintentional whisper escaped that caught Steve’s attention, making him dip and press a line of butterfly kisses down Tony’s neck, slipping down his body, then to his chest.
“I’ll help round the others up,” Janet volunteered, eyeing the two and trying not to smirk to herself, but instead just whispered a firm ‘finally’.
But where was Hammer?
“This isn’t your fault, Tony, we’ll save Reed and get those schematics back, I promise you.”
He stood to his feet, head lowered, rim of his hat shading his face, trying to compose himself against Doom who stood there so triumphantly towering over his fallen comrade. His arms were trembling with pain, fingers slowly curling and balling up into fists. Tony closed his eyes for a moment, opening them with a bright blue glow to the iris, power surging throughout his body and all channelling down to his chest, to his beating heart.
“Impossible. Reed must’ve caused some sort of time skip again, that’s the last time I leave him in the lab after 1AM alone.”
“So what is this…?” Tony asked, his voice echoing throughout the hallways, which showed how large this place really was.
No response.
Steve picked up one of the gadgets on the dashboard, which looked like a megaphone, talking into it. “We’ve got other plans, but thanks Carol! We have to save our friend!” It was hard to converse over a loudspeaker like that, especially as they both were driving down the highway at quite a fast pace. He’d explain later, but she flashed her front lights to signal that they could go on and Tony took the hint, nudging the car to speed off and follow the coordinates.
After a while of simply being next to each other, with Steve kissing the back of Tony’s hand, taking in his scent and the warmth of his body they drifted into a well-earned rest; Tony hoping that his own serum, Extremis, would heal some of his injuries over night, but at that time his injuries weren’t his worries. He was in the arms of his hero and that was all that mattered.
“Here sir…” One of the lab assistants handed over a holo-file, a small tablet with a cyan interactive projection.
“Did you get any samples, do any further tests?” Reed asked eagerly.
“See that doesn’t make much sense to me. Why would it be global unless there were numerous culprits?”
There was much more that needed to be done but at that moment Tony couldn’t bring himself to. Steve had been calling out for help, he knew that he was in danger and Tony just ignored it, he said he would be there to help but in the end he just wasn’t quick enough. Rapid shots of holding Rumiko in his arms flashed through his mind before he became entirely numb. Then he became angry, livid in fact, fuming, succumbing to his rage he bolted over toward Zola and began pounding at the machine that he was trapped within.
His eyes were eyes that saw a world in a whole new light, or much rather darkness. He would step out into the new world where his act, his idea had taken seed and as opposed to seeing superheroes cooperate and work together like he had planned, all he could see was the damage that he had done. Tony Stark was a futurist but at the current time all that he could see was the past, replaying in his mind over and over. Yes, had worked hard, damn hard, for what he had gotten now and he wouldn’t change a thing... Well... Only one thing; for the boy from Brooklyn to just see things from his perspective and not rebel against him, not with such venom and hatred, and yet, he expected as such from Steve, it’s a wonder why he couldn’t see this coming. With all the peace he had achieved and with all the casualties of war all he could think was that “it wasn’t worth it...” Nothing was worth the death of his friends and nothing in the world was worth losing the one person who always had faith in him. Now everything was darker than it had ever been, with shadows and ghost of empty souls wandering the streets. Sometimes he would walk along the streets of NYC whenever it was dark, between late night and early morning, before the sun had risen over the horizon and even before the moon had completely moved along to shed its glow elsewhere. At that time, he would walk the empty streets, barely surviving mentally, since he had become so accustomed to living beneath the surface without his shield to protect him. It was then he would see faint silhouettes looking at him, staring as he walked with his head hung and he would feel their sad gaze upon him as though they pitied him. Always alone. Iron Man.
“I’m so confused right now… So the government provided these augmentations? Why help people who aren’t submitting?”
He turned to look over at Steve sleeping, eyes tracing over that delicate silhouette, along the sharp features of his face and admiring how the light from the outside window perfectly hit his jaw to highlight how wonderfully chiselled it really was.  The rattle of the blinds against the window made him jump a little, but he resumed his awestruck vision until he reached Steve’s chest.
They reached a room blocked by a plank of wood, shifting it to one side and opening the door that fell off the hinges the moment they did. Tony held his hand out to Peter, walking in and staring through the eyelets of his faceplate, looking from side to side, holding up his palms so that he could shine more light into the place.
Soon his vision focused on the other man who sat in the corner of the quarantine room. His clothing was torn; the blue t-shirt with a once white star was now tainted with red and grey. The torn trousers were now worn at the knees, the dog tags hung around his neck. Everything was utterly in shambles. Steve’s body twitched as though he were flinching at the constant pains his body was going through with the changes. His pale eyes even more sunken in with his cheekbones and jaw appeared far more angular and protruded ominously. Dark black varicose veins threaded throughout the plains of Steve’s once glowing skin to make it look much more lifeless than Tony had ever seen him.
“Your memories, Steve, I’m not about to lose them!”
“You’re telling me.” Peter hopped over some broken glass whilst Tony just tread over it, hearing it crunch under his feet.
“You have me, and I am all you need.”
They exited as quickly as they could. Now that they were out in the open, Steve placed Hank down on the ground and began examining him, Tony did the same when Janet was sat down on the sidewalk. “We’ll get you fixed up. Hold on.” Tony dashed away from them for a moment to run into a nearby grocery store, grabbing a few bottles of water, bandages and granola bars and then writing a huge “I.O.U – Tony Stark.” On a lotto ticket that was resting on the counter before running back out and joining the others, handing Janet a bottle with one of the bars while tearing open the wrapper with his teeth and taking a huge chomp of the bar he was holding. Janet stared with worry and concern over Hank as Steve caught the bandages that Tony tossed to him, wrapping Hank’s multiple wounds up. The shrapnel from the bomb had done quite a lot of damage, but it wasn’t life threatening now that it was all wrapped up.
“Painful…”
“When I was a kid, my old man used to criticize everything I did, but one thing he would allow me to do that was somewhat childish was to collect these Cap comics. It was my first ever comic book, actually. I used to watch the cartoon too, I mean, come on… Who
“Hey, I ain’t just good with guns you know,”  he shouted back.
“Fury isn’t in charge anymore. Did you not get the memo?”
It was the first official day that all of them had moved in and their floors were furnished, and they had all managed to find time off to celebrate their new home.
“I’ll make sure of it, Cap.” He flashed a reassuring smile.
All eyes were back on Steve and he loosened his collar a little, choking out a nervous laugh. He was prepared to face any challenge, but working with someone that had been through a string of partners was extremely daunting. Internally he scolded himself and stood up, taking a deep breath. “I’ll last, I promise. I’ll be the best partner you’ve had, pal.”
He had to focus all of the energy he could, communicating with his suit through the micro-electrons that ran through his bloodstream, sending messages through as though activating an entirely new neuro-system, finally with that command his propulsion unit accelerated – sending him up into the air, and following the jet as fast as he could. Even though he was chasing Peter, Cap and Carol were still in the back of his mind. He couldn’t deny that Steve was his focus of thought, the way their eyes locked and for a second he could’ve sworn things were just the same as they once were, though he knew that was most probably just wishful thinking.
Tony’s boot pushed down harder on Steve.
Steve sighed. “There’s no point in waiting, let’s just get this done with so I can get my feet on the ground.”
Tony was trying to recover as much as he could, running from the courtyard to that special room, grabbing everything he’d held from his childhood and transferring it outside including a vintage Captain America shield and ensuring that it was safe for Steve to use to replace his damaged one. Tony Stark was by no means a sentimental man, but when it came to that room in particular, it just contradicted his nature entirely.  Some of the items in that room had been in his collection since he was years old, and there was no way he was letting them go now. He’d also managed to find a few parts to use later. Like he said, he’d upgrade their bionics (he was still resentful that he was using something of Hammer’s).
Tony’s systems locked on to the large circle of metal that it detected and he pointed his boosters downward, holding out his hands to land perfectly on the dimming lights under his feet until they completely faded. This caused the sand beneath him to partially subside with the flusters of air that projected from the landing style. The winds also helped reveal something that was otherwise hidden by the sand, and eventually it all became crystal clear – there it was, a giant silver disk that was his door to finding his friend.
“Will you two stop complaining? You’re clouding up my radio; we have to keep these airways clear.” Carol commanded.
Everything was well in New York City. The birds were once again singing, the children were outside playing and the town was safe and being rebuilt once again. The robot parts scattered around the city were being recycled and used for Tony’s new business – prosthetics for those in need. He was helping in more ways than one, naturally the philanthropist. Reed was back in the lab, being monitored by Sue more closely than ever. Carol was running her new sub-team, helping rebuild the city and monitor supervillain activity. And Steve and Tony, well, they had plans of their own.
No witty comeback, not an addition. He had just lost every ounce of fight in him.
Just when he was running his hand down to reach his belt buckle—
“Geez… That’s incredible, you betcha I’ll call you on this whenever I need you!”
The super soldier ran at full speed, barging him with immense amounts of Herculean strength “Get your hands off him!”
“Hm?”
There it was, that little tightness he felt in his chest began to swell when Tony had said those last words. Sure, he had been confused and a little scared of Tony at first given his enigmatic reputation and then the robotics that startled him, but when he explained there was nothing really dislikeable about him. “They yell at you a lot, huh?”
“I believe you Tony.”
“What do you think happened? She’s suddenly gone nuts.”
Tony zoomed as quickly as he could to reach the man that appeared to be leaping down the street, jumping from streetlight to light, and swinging himself around to gain momentum then throwing himself to the next like some sort of circus performer. He was astoundingly acrobatic in his purple and yellow leotard.  It was up to Tony to weave through the lampposts and chase down the leaping Frenchman that was singing
“The control panel! Steve! Disable it!”
Instantly Tony’s eyes went from shocked to livid, and he raised his eyebrows indignantly. “It’s you!” He managed to shout, breaking free with a yank backward. He raised both of his hands and pointed them at Crossbones, ensuring his palms were facing him. His voice was particularly fuelled with bitterness, considering that this was the very man that had shot Steve before.
“Sir…” Maria attempted to say, but never before had she heard his voice so strong and filled with conviction.
“Yeah! HELEN takes the best route, she gets traffic updates via a satellite that we have set up, she’s incredible, if I do say so myself.” Tony patted the dashboard lovingly, the car honking in response.
“Go go Stark gum trap!” Tony ordered the car, rubbing his hands together to see his latest invention at work, but instead of gum shooting out to stick the cars down, actual gumballs popped out from the exhaust. Before he could say anything the road behind them was littered with rainbow coloured gumballs, the cars behind skidding and crashing off to the side after their tires were unable to keep a grip of the ball covered asphalt.
“We didn’t cause those, are you absurd? Why would we get ourselves killed trying to stop these things! Why would we be the cause of it!”
He shut his eyes and tilted his head back whilst Steve knelt down next to him.
“What?! What, what is it, what happened?!” Peter said as he pushed the curtain that separated them back and saw the skull.
“I’m not saying anything but… That could always be a possibility.”
Steve took a closer look at the keys so he could see what number his car would be, each police car had a 3 digit number that was usually on the top of it, the one assigned to him was car ‘616’. He made a mental note and headed out with Tony, catching the others glancing at them from afar, making their comments about ‘the detective’ and a few whispering good luck to Steve along the way. Truth be told, he was still trying to figure out what exactly had happened in the office and wondered if he’d had one too many cups of coffee; maybe the excitement was making him delusional.
Tony had done it.
Steve punched the wall again and shook his head, drawing back and looking at his knuckles that weren’t even close to bruising. There were absolutely no signs of it at all, his skin remained fully in tact with not even a scratch.
“It’s true, I mean, well… You believe and trust me Tony, and now I’m just asking you for this one thing, just please believe me…” He said, reaching around and touching Tony’s wings again. This time Tony felt a strange sensation surge through his body, it was as though he was feeling someone dive into his thoughts and he looked up at Steve.
“STOP!” Tony squirmed, gritting his teeth tightly, hands wrapping around the wrists of the suit, trying his hardest to pry them away. The burn around his neck was like no other, the intense heat emanating from the metal around his throat was so hot that he could feel his skin begin to sear, in fact, he could smell it, and the stench of burning flesh was one that always made him cringe and remember the time that he was on that island alone with the suit, and it did the same as it was doing now.
Jan sighed deeply once she took in the concentrated look on Tony’s face, knowing that it was never a good sign of what was to come. Tony was a man who would laugh and joke, so the moment that he was serious, she knew that there was a real threat to deal with. “It looks like a storm’s brewing outside, either that or Galactus is on his way again…”
“You... You’re not here.”
His arm began to tremble as he held it out to support the failing leg, unable to keep this up for a lengthy period of time. The armour was heavy and the power chip was clearly not compatible with his leg and it was causing it to malfunction. He grit his teeth together and tried to shift without Steve noticing any area of weakness, since he knew well that he’d hone in on it.
No luck.
His eyes darted around the circuits as though reading a book, “They all have trackers. Well, at least yours does. And Carol’s augmentation did too.”
“Cut the crap, Tony. Stop defending that thing!”
Luckily, he’d managed to save one of his prized possessions, and he stooped down to pick up an old Captain America comic book, one of the first he’d ever gotten, one of the only things that Howard had ever allowed him to keep without saying it was too childish.
“Golly? Gosh? Isn’t that what you’re prone to saying?” Tony teased,
“Well… The light… Sometimes… When you saved me a couple of times before, I guess they were particularly bright when… Well… The Red Zone, when you’d saved me there, then I returned the favour…” He shook his head, “And here I thought it was me being delusional from all the toxins in the air.”
Steve’s eyes focused, though his iris seemed to flicker in colour. “You shall be destroyed.” The vice grip intensified.
“What is it?” Steve asked, noticing the sudden silence.
tech. With his own sweat and blood.
“You were the cause of the bioweapon in New York…” T’Challa growled.
“Better… But I’m still hungry. It does feel better though, I don’t suppose you have more burgers, Shellhead? I knew I could rely on you.” Steve smiled weakly up at him.
hand to wipe the remnants of the liquid splatters from his mouth, looking nothing but miserable. That was a vile taste; it’d tasted like he’d downed a bottle of battery fluid.
“Lucky,” he repeated with scepticism. He slipped his mask on again, making sure it clicked firmly in place, looking from side to side, taking in a deep breath then coughing again, forgetting the air was dust infested. He looked at his hand, turning it back and forth, gazing at it from fingertip to elbow.
“Eyes on the road, Cap.”
“Stop, Steve, wait!” Tony quickly grabbed Steve’s wrist and stood in front of him protectively, narrowing his own eyes as he watched the figure slowly reveal itself as the smoke subsided. The Green Goblin was taking slow steps out, laughing darkly. The tone he used to laugh made the hairs on the back of Tony’s neck stand up, backing closer to Steve for security. The armoured Captain instinctively huddled closer to Tony, placing an arm on Tony’s.
“You’re pretty angelic when you want to be.” Steve said, moving one of his hands from Tony’s shoulder to scratch the back of his head nervously.
Tony squirmed as he was carried off the floor, clutching Steve’s wrist. “Steve! No, Steve!! I love you, please! Remember who you are!” His feet kicked, trying to find a way to push the enhanced Super Soldier away. “Steve, I love you!”
Steve huffed and diverted his attention toward Killgrave, running to the machine.
“You ain’t in a deal makin’ position here,” the low voice returned.
“Good throw! Thanks!”
“So you’re basically a prototype?” he was hesitant to ask.
Steve swung his shield around, watching it ricochet against the wall and knock Tony’s hand, which was the perfect opportunity for him to go on the offensive again, grabbing him and drilling a series of punches to his chest and abdomen. Though with each strike his own eyes widened, a pained expression lasting. He was conscious, he knew he was, but he couldn’t do a thing; trapped under the puppeteer’s control.
Steve clasped his shield on his arm, bringing Jan, Natasha and Tony closer. He thrust it out at the bots, ducking under for cover while Jan and Natasha used the space to fire at the hoard.
“Rhodey, I’ve got this.”
The first observation that he had made was that the hand was in fact not part of his armour at all. It was black, thin, a skeletal structure that moved as though it were real. It began to tremble as the realisation became more and more clear, noticing how it was attached to his elbow and that was where it ended the trembling alone was just too realistic, too humanistic.
Another mission another day – returning home from Madripoor after a tedious mission involving the likes of Taskmaster meant that things had become far more complicated than first anticipated. Nonetheless, the enemy was taken down, Taskmaster was behind bars again, and Steve and Tony were making their way back alongside Rhodey who was accompanying them. The Director was wearing the suit that he’d been working on. The refurbishment was rather impressive, and the once scary looking suit that was hanging on the hooks in the lab was now being worn and used and packed a hell of a punch.  It was clear that Tony really did mean it when he said he was fixing it, and yet he used a different helmet, most probably a newer model. It certainly wasn’t his area of expertise, so he couldn’t really judge, just so long as he did his job and the suit protected him. He’d been using it ever since that incident in his lab.
“A little sore.” Tony pouted, wriggling his derriere. “My battle wounds don’t hurt as much, but we’re in a hospital, I’ll patch them all up.”
“That doesn’t give me a reason to just leave you like that, soldier...”
“I have a personal score to settle with Justin Hammer, for his treatment of my comrades.”
“So… Tony, you going to show us around a little?” Reed suggested, trying to change the topic of conversation even though it was difficult to with Tony standing there with his shirt wide open, and Steve with his head turned, hiding his face. It was absolutely amazing how the Captain would change from this confident commanding character to extremely bashful when he was exposed like that. Not that everyone didn’t know already.
“Oh sure, you get belts.” Steve groaned.
Steve threw his shield and bolted forward, hearing a sound from behind him as he peered over his shoulder to see a red and gold suit land. “Tony?”
Fred Myers, also known as Boomerang was actually an American raised Australian putting on a horrid accent to promote his heritage.
“That was a close call, thanks Iron Man.”
“It’s safer! I know about safe, you want me to slam fire hazard laws in your face, Cage?!” She yells in that authoritative boom.
“You too, my beloved.”
“Nothing’s wrong, is there?” Steve queried.
“It does…” His voice trailed as he leaned closer to Steve’s cheek, giving it a swift lick with the tip of his tongue, wiping away the blood. “…look like something.” The metallic flavour lingered on his taste buds. Tony licked his lips to display his satisfaction, before grinning such that all his teeth showed. His sharp canines were on display, dazzling in the artificial light around them.
Tony growled under his breath at the shoddy explanation which still revealed little to nothing. “What chemicals did you use?”
“You destroyed a police car in the chase; you know how much that costs Tony. The chief doesn’t like you; don’t give him an excuse to fire you!” she warned him, handing Batroc to one of the other cops to shove him into the back of her car.
“And your chip, the one you three have since you were recently incarcerated, you have a hybrid chip which can potentially engage mind control on you?”
“There is no sign of him sir; traces of liquid nitrogen are around one particular area of the lab. Upon further research it seems that the EMP device that you had previously found belongs to one Victor Von Doom.”
Nothing but static; a noise that Steve was growing infuriated with.
Steve was back in the room that he had started in with the strange dark shadows fading back and retreating into Tony’s shadowy wings. It was as though he had never left; Tony was in the same spot and was staring at him with exactly the same expression as he was before the trip. The truth was that he was overwhelmed by what he had just witnessed – seeing him being manhandled like that, and it clearly wasn’t the first time either. It caused his body to quake in sadness just thinking about it. This was Tony’s past, something that he had been hiding and after this, it was made apparent why. Steve wouldn’t want to relive anything like that, that’s why he kept his past to himself too. He did know his fair share about abusive parents too; his father was extremely abusive toward his mother, in fact, that was one of the reasons that he wanted to grow up to protect people, to protect them against abuse, against bullying.
Well, that was
a man of thought, a scientist of creation that could invent things that would even amaze the great Tony Stark (although it took a lot for Tony to admit that he was impressed). The thing about the scientists within their group was that they were all specialists in their own division, and even with Tony’s seven doctorates, he still found himself specialising in engineering. This was very different from Reed, who preferred studying interdimensional travel and particle theory as well as side-lining his vast knowledge of human biology, chemistry and physics. (At least they had shared common ground on their knowledge of electrical engineering). Tony rarely questioned Reed at all in regards to his work; what the two of them had specialised in had made them the people that they were today.
Tony laughed a little, “Puh-lease. Grey’s Anatomy is far more interesting.” His eyes returned to the screen where there was a huge map, eyes darting from highlighted point to point to see all of the places where the weapons were. He clicked on the point on the Empire State Building – only to see the schematics of the bomb that they were trying to dismantle.
“Nonsense, it’s perfectly fine, right Reed?”
“I’m not... I’m not like you!” Tony snapped again, with more tears falling down his cheeks.
He let loose an impatient huff of air and nodded. “Fine, but we need to find a cure as
Each movement was harder than the next. His head was still pounding from earlier, but his mind was in complete disarray. Eventually, he managed to sit up completely, but not without ripples of pain spreading throughout his entire body.
“Enough with this speculation!” Carol shouted. “We all know Detective Stark. We know that he’s a great guy with a heart of gold, when it comes down to it. We need to go and send as many men as we can to stop this bot, first of all. I’m sure Tony can’t be behind this…”
He shrugged nonchalantly to hide the nerves that began to build upon his Freudian slip. “I could’ve said ‘the’ one and only, but this conversation is just between me and you, hence ‘my’.”
Tony’s eyes shot wide open and he backed off, trying to get Steve to stay behind him. “That’s a…”
partner?” The word caught Steve’s attention.
But if there was one thing neither of them could stand, it was silence, even in desolate times Peter needed to hear words around him, even if they weren’t necessarily words of comfort. He had to fill in the silence.
“Tony, listen to me, please…”
“Better? How? That place was perfect, I’m not bragging or anything but you know…”
“Now that we’ve quite exceptionally explained our intentions, I feel as though you should get finished off…” The Purple Man turned to Hammer, who rubbed his hands together far too eagerly.
Steve hit the wheel and spun it to make a dramatic left as instructed.
“What happened?” Reed asked.
“He’s not. He’s alive, the serum must’ve helped him and must be fighting whatever it is that Zola’s injected him with.”
“Uh, it’s back in the kitchen-” Anya was cut off when Tony bolted up, still with the blanket wrapped around him, nearly tripping over it but in a frantic mess he ran back to get all the food that was collected on the table and then dashed back down as quickly as he could, not even bothering to take the elevator but running down the stairs and stumbling a few times before finally making to the lager bolted doors that stood in his way. He heard the gentle metallic click of hidden machinery after the beam of blue had met his iris, his pupil constricting then dilating to the light. Another loud sound was heard after the retinal scan was complete and the set of doors and panels shifted aside to reveal the medical bay that he had now adopted as his second lab for the time being.
Slowly, with that heavy pounding resonating in his chest, he turned to stare at the stub that was left of his arm.
Tony crawled a little further and tugged out his own set of cuffs to snap the guy’s ankles together too. If there was one thing that he’d observed it was that Batroc’s legs were extremely powerful, and if they were restrained at least he couldn’t get away. Steve sighed with relief and got to his feet, grabbing Batroc by the collar and holding him up, hearing French curse words being muttered under his breath.
“N-nothing, just checking… You—it looked like you stopped—never mind. Nightmares.” He muttered incoherently, curling up against the pillow and pressing his nose to it instead. Paranoia was surely getting the better of him, so burying his face against Steve’s pillow to inhale that fragrant scent that he adored was enough to pacify him.
While Steve was content with the first bot, the second had finally made its way around it when it loomed over Steve who was crouched over the fallen metal frame. This was the moment that Tony began to grind his back teeth nervously, if it didn’t work he’d have to build a new bot. Having to do that would cost time that the treatment team simply didn’t have. It slid the top bar forward with a minute click. Tony knew that sound attracted Steve, like an animal, so he had to make the movements of the second as quiet as possible. At this point Tony could hear his own heartbeat pounding in his ears. Even a pin drop could be heard like a loud bell-ring to Tony at that second in time. When the top bar slid open, the hatch was revealed, and the syringe slowly lifted from it.
“Used the same code to lock up the entire building.”
Tony’s heart felt as though it was in the clouds, he could feel and taste that same taste that remained on Steve’s lips despite his condition. It was absolutely wonderful, a beautiful feeling, a feeling of happiness that he wanted to cherish for the rest of his life. He could feel a tear welling up in his tear duct as he continued to kiss the super solider.
Tony held up his hand to speak, “Yeah, we were actually just on our way back to the lab to get everything fixed, Officer Danvers.”
“Shut up for a second, Tony.” She whispered but still with that hard tone in her voice but the last word was filled with bitterness for a reason unbeknown to the man she was talking to.
home.
Tony burst out into the hot rays with his thrusters leaving blue streaks in the air behind him. The sun brought a little more colour to Steve’s face, much to his relief. He had never clutched onto anything so preciously, holding Steve throughout their journey back to base as if he were a porcelain doll. “We’ll get you home…” He repeated aloud as though it were a mantra as the setting sun cast blood orange glow in the sky that they soared through together.
He came to the steel clad doors and shouted the password, “Captain America!” To which the doors slid open. As expected the lab had been totalled. The explosion had obviously come from just underneath it, leaving it in ruins asides from a few remaining machines.
He was walking inside with Tony just a few footsteps behind him before he spotted it hanging from the ceiling – A P-64, a fighter plane, on full display, bullet holes and all. Seeing it there gave him a chance to actually admire it, as opposed to when he’d step foot in the air base he’d either be shooed away or have to watch them fly overhead. Then not too far away was a Light Tank M2 in all of its glory. Proud and sturdy, and yet, Steve could pick out the weaknesses in the armour of the tank and where exactly the enemies would strike. He’d not seen many of these on the field himself, they didn’t really last too long either, but taking a look at it close up made all of the memories rush back to him as if it were just recently. He could almost hear the loud clunk of the engines as these rolled by the usually wet terrains. Tony stood with his arms folded, staring at Steve who seemed at that point like a child in a candy store, spoiled for choice, surrounded by everything he could want.
Tony shut his eyes and rocked his hips ever so gently against the hand, encouraging each motion that was being made, keen to show how much he was enjoying it. It had seemed like forever since they had been together, and this was their first time in such an intimate circumstance, even though it felt as though they had been there before Tony knew that was only probably from the copious amounts of dreams he had of the other man doing these things to him, but he could never fathom this sort of scenario.
Hours of talk after the long initial silence had ended them back in the USA, in New Orleans to be more specific. Getting transferred from plane to car and getting taken to the museum. Tony was exhausted, dozing off in the car journey while Steve remained distracted by the sights that passed by in a quick hazy flurry.
Tony held him close, fingers trailing down the nape of his neck, down his shoulders and along his shoulder blades.
“Never mind, I can get a new one… Those books were for show anyway.” The voice spoke in a calm, chilling voice.
“I’ll get you out of here!” Tony reassured him, while Steve was trapped in a circle of flames Tony had to find some way to form a bridge over them. He glanced back at his other suits, but they were surrounded by flames and rubble too, and it wouldn’t surprise him if the entire internal system was down. It must have been if the sprinklers weren’t working and JARVIS wasn’t responding.
As he reached the heap, he dashed to move to the next which was only a couple of yards away, but felt his movement slow, his leg was starting to drag. With a groan he used his arm to lift it and heave it forward so that his strides were long, but slow.
Tony stared at each second that ticked down. With each moment that passed, as the bot reeling itself in and Steve lunging at it. Luckily Tony had anticipated such a reaction, and the first bot was a dummy, the second rolled itself through the decontamination doors. This was the moment that he bit his lower lip with pure nerves, his hand returning to clasp the bottom on his chin as he maintained the same perplexed stare while the second bot scooted around Steve just as planned. T’Challa and Hank stood just behind Tony, both with their arms folded watching every small jerk that Steve was making, observing with intense scrutiny.
“You see, the thing about this mirror is that it can only be used once for cross-dimensional travel. Once.” Tony leaned closer to the mirror. “How badly do you want to work for me, though? I want to
He fell back to his position back on his knees, far too weak to stand. When the dust subsided, he leaned closer to see Steve’s legs. The sight made him queasy; bone jutting out of the knee and the other had been broken beforehand. As he stared at it the flashback of him cracking Steve’s knee flashed before his eyes. The tremble in his body increased tenfold, he held both of his hands up but his focus honed in on the one responsible, the one attached to him from the start; his flesh hand.
“Armies are nice though, you could always use them to do other things rather than completely useless drones that just become suicide bombers. No sense of self preservation, always depending on others to save them.” Norman preached, kicking Tony’s hand away and turning his back on him, only to stare at the wall of stasis tubes.
He nodded and began to look around to soak in his surroundings. This was the place he would now practically be living in. He’d be surrounded by these people every day so he had better learn to get along.
“I know but I guess angels can’t forget their roots, they can’t lose faith completely because they know that there’ll always be someone to save them, like a feeling in their heart that they can’t explain.” Steve’s hand drifted to Tony’s cheek and he held it lightly, his palm pressed against the man’s velvet skin.
That was an awkward shift in conversation as he pulled Steve by the arm toward the looted store, being careful as he stepped inside. He grabbed a black long sleeve t-shirt, simple, chic, perfect – asides from the arm he had to tear off to fit his bionic arm through, but he considered himself a fashionista of sorts so this was just him making a regular outfit fabulous. Jeans and a pair of sneakers were next – it was far more comfortable than wearing his soaked to the bone workshop clothing, in fact being in dry clothes again warmed him up instantly, he could feel himself burying his face into the fabric at times with pure and utter gratitude. Without a doubt he had shifted into his new gear with Steve standing right there. He wasn’t bashful around the Captain, after all, he had seen a
“Death Valley, it had to be a location named so ominously.” He lamented to his computer systems as his black and golden armour shimmered in the scorching beams of sunlight that parried off the metallic surface, casting offshoots of light even as he flew with such rapidity that not even a grain of sand beneath him was shaken.
Steve’s handwriting was always much neater than he’d ever imagined. Each letter had an italic slant and cursive lettering, which shocked him at first, but now he just sat back and enjoyed it. The Captain was a natural artist and he managed to reflect that in every way.
“Well I’ve got—“
To this day, he held a grudge, trying to parry the guilt off himself toward the sniper, although he knew Steve would have never been in that position if it hadn’t been for his action. Blame or not, that was something he had never forgotten. Tony Stark wasn’t afraid to kill. He didn’t like doing it, but he would if he was driven to the extreme. His eyes narrowed, his position crouched ready to obey his instinct when he caught sight of Cap slumped in that corner. He had to move to protect him, but Crossbones seemed to have no intent of going toward Captain America, which was strange. Still, he tried to sidle toward the Captain with tiny sideward steps.
The plank that Steve was chained to now rattled with tremendous force, as Steve’s entire body was wracked by horrific spasms, almost as though he were having a seizure. The only thing that kept his head from hitting the wall was the giant syringe that was planted firmly to the top of his spine; whenever his head jolted back, it’d hit the large tube and he would fall forward again. His arms and legs squirmed and writhed as though he were yearning to break free, his eyes opened wide and rolled back so only the whites of his eyes were visible. To Tony Stark, this was possibly the most terrifying thing he’d ever seen in his life, and he had seen some
A sense of relief washed over Tony’s face and he placed his palm firmly on Steve’s muscle clad shoulder. “You’ll be running in no time, Cap.”
“I think I’ve managed to prove that classic ingenuity and tactics managed to overcome technology.”
“No but I believe in destroying evil, and that suit isn’t worth salvaging.”
“Mainly people we locked up, either they’re working for the security force here or sewer dwellers, and trust me, there’s not enough of us to take em out. They’d jump at the chance to kill us; we learned that the hard way. That’s how we lost… “
best thing in his life.
“Wait!” Tony quickly tugged something out of the pocket of his long jacket, fumbling as he tried to open the car door but eventually pulling it open and then jumping out, tripping on his feet but maintaining his balance (just) as he ran up those few stairs to meet Steve, taking his hand and placing something in it. “I almost forgot this!”
“Feel What?”
“He’s the only one still in America, still right here. The rest are scattered across the world.”
“So thank you Tony, you are officially one of the departments… Prized inspectors.” Every word that escaped Fury’s mouth held a grudge to it, but at least he was being honest. “You’ve earned your place in the precinct, and your title, inspector. Along with your partner. I suppose tin-men are okay…”
“Steve… Steve…” His name rolled off his tongue, his childhood hero doing this to him was beyond anything he could have ever dreamed of.
Steve’s expression lifted as Tony pulled him, glad that he could rely on the man that was now guiding the team. Natasha and Janet were just behind them shooting the bots that charged at them from behind. It wasn’t long until they reached the main hall where before they could even open the door, and a sea of drones swarmed out and crashed through the walls.
“So now you’re saying I’m not human?”
He was so weak that he couldn’t call for help, so dazed, still as though he was being tugged at by a leash. Tony groaned, but not even that would escape his mouth.
“We do!” Tony said proudly.
Steve shut his eyes, seeing thoughts and images pass through his mind, seeing cave wall surroundings and hearing screams of pain, blood, running, panting. So many more images, a dark haired woman who he’d known of just by her name – Rumiko, the way she broke Tony’s heart. The other countless lovers flashing by in a dizzy haze.
“Damn, Steve, killing me like that.” The man in the red and gold armour chuckled, folding back his golden faceplate to reveal dark sapphire blue eyes and a well-trimmed goatee.
“A-a-a-are any of you… going to help me?”
Tony swallowed hard as he could help but scan the worried face in front of him, so close to him, those pink bright lips, indented chin, golden hair that continued to shimmer in the very little light that continued to peek through the door that was very slightly ajar, “How?” He asked meekly. Although he didn’t believe him, the man seemed so persistent, so why not indulge him a little?
Jessica followed holding her hand close to her chest, and Carol limped as she leaned on the other woman for support. There was a momentary exchange between them, a glance of relief and thankfulness glimmering. Carol leaned a little closer, and as Jessica turned her head she felt the light skim of the other woman lips against her cheek, causing her to smile the faintest of smiles.
put your brain before your heart.”
“I’ll heal your heart Tony Stark, whenever you need me.” He said, “Just promise you’ll never drink the pain away.” He replied, placing his lips to the side of Tony’s jaw.
Right now that deal was tempting. He couldn’t fight him, nor was he in any condition to.
“Yeah sure, sure,
“Yeah, and you know, we never did figure out who kept setting them off. It was a huge terrorist attack on a global scale.”
Cap was busy trying to get the right wires in line when he spotted the same LED that Janet had. It’s flashing pace was gradually getting faster and faster. He tapped his communicator,
“Tony!” Steve gasped, staring back at him, placing his hand under his chin and looking from eye to eye to make sure that he didn’t have a concussion. “Tony, speak to me, can you see anything?”
“Why is this taking so long?”
“Steve…”
To be quite honest, Tony had no idea what to do. He stared at the woman and knew it’d only be a matter of time before she broke free from the webbing using her powers. They were already starting to corrode at it. They didn’t have long, but the question was whether they had long enough for the genius to really examine what was wrong. That would involve having to remove her entire faceplate, which was much more troublesome than just an eye plate. He knelt down as Peter removed some of the webbing to reveal her face, she screamed at them, even louder without any obstruction before Peter quickly webbed her mouth shut.
Fury cleared his throat, standing with authority in front of his office, a cigar hanging between his teeth while he pushed back his greys. Just the sound of his throat clearing managed to silence the buzz of noise around the precinct. “Listen to Carol. We need to stop that thing from walking down the street actin’ like it owns the joint! Everyone, get your asses down there ASAP! Take it down and make sure that Stark comes back in cuffs!”
“Tony, what’s going on? Tell me!”
Hammer held his hands up, palms toward the two giants that stood above him, with their heroic stature and lack of light shadowing their ominous expressions. “Huh? Th-that’s mine?”
His heart paced as he tried to creep closer and closer without seeming too obvious, but it was difficult when Steve kept flinching like that, jerking with movement. Tony understood his pain but he needed to stop it completely. With a rapid movement he pulled the exposed part of Steve’s neck, apologising profusely as he crushed the metallic plate that he could find. Steve’s eyes shot open with pain, his pupils dilating before he fell forward, whispering his friends’ names; Sharon, Sam, Bucky… Tony.
“There, all fixed.”
“I just…” He blushed as his eyes instantly went to the floor, purposely avoiding eye contact.
His head tilted back and mouth fallen ever so slightly open.
Tony palm faced forward, but Steve couldn’t quite get a glimpse of his other arm, it appeared hidden, the way that Tony was standing. But he did notice something by his feet – drops of blood were starting to trickle from Tony’s hidden arm, pooling on the floor.
The second that they drove past it Steve couldn’t help but wonder how he hadn’t noticed the place before, but now when he stared at it, it gave him the heebie-jeebies. It was only thanks to the tracker that they’d actually found the place, but Steve wasn’t the only one kicking himself for not noticing – Tony of course had thought that all this time Victor had returned to Latveria, but there he was, right under his nose. He was kicking himself internally as he passed the mansion that just oozed the dark power that was so typical of his nemesis.
“Steve please!”
. It was one of the words that people used too often whenever there was anything that they needed to poke and prod. He scowled at it, rolling his jaw – mimicking Steve’s action of frustration. “Sedation until we find a cure entirely, it may help with his outbursts of rage. He doesn’t sleep, so perhaps easing the irritation of unrest…” Hank proposed.
“Got it and you’re sure this works, Rhodes?”
That was the first time he’d called him by his first name, properly. It just slipped out by instinct, smoothly sliding off the tip of his tongue.
As much as Steve wanted to have faith in the man that he held his heart out to, he realised after a few days that the entire situation was becoming bleak, and perhaps there was no way to recover. He had though that he was getting better all this time but actually seeing what he had become began to trigger more inside him, he could feel himself changing, he could feel his memories fading one by one.
Tony nodded and pulled back, releasing Steve’s arm from his clutches and instead walking side by side with him.
“You did this all yourself?” Steve asked, wide eyed.
Tony paused just before they could enter the room, grabbing his sunglasses and slipping them on.
Steve winced, kicking his legs out and hearing the repeated thuds of his boot clanging against the metal. “Tony, call it off!”
) but more often it was used for situations where they were both at risk such as the current one.
love the rugged look, it’s sexy. But I can’t have you outshining me, Colonel… Not that you have much of a chance with this personalised chrome finish, but…” He chuckled, more for his own benefit than anything else. “Next.”
To take the words away from Tony Stark was truly a feat in itself.
It took a moment for Steve to give in, nodding sadly and aiming his own repulsor toward the Green Goblin, with Tony doing the same, both of them standing back to back, armour to armour, with their hands held out, palms facing the same man.
It was time to get to park.
“You go any further than we are now and it’s taken territory…”
He brushed his lips against Steve’s. “I knew I’d be fine…” He whispered.
“Like I said, Stark, we’ll make a deal. Ya do what you need to do and we won’t be usin’ you for the next mask of our gang,” Taskmaster said from behind his mask. “Cap over there ain’t in good shape, you ain’t goin’ to risk it so just do what we tell you to and we’ll give you your info.”
He asked again, “Cap..?”
“Shellhead, where did that come from? I thought I…” He winced as they tried to walk together. “…I thought I heard you say that… Over the comm, last battle...”
“His body is…” Hank said in astonishment. “…It’s attacking the new blood, the serum isn’t surviving…”
“I’m not an animal either, I…” Steve paused, hearing his stomach growl again and pulling back from the glass. “I’m a… I’m still me.” He repeated, mainly as a mantra to himself.
“We all do. We’ve made the team aware of what’s happening, briefly, and they all know that Cap is in good hands now and that he needs his space.”
Tony’s sudden smirk of confidence began to fade as there were more blips on the radar, more red dots. “The Destroyer, Major Talbot, Black Swan, Whirlwind, Absorbing man, a hoard of Doombots… Why are all of these people coming together? Why now? This seems so… co-ordinated…”
Tony began to stammer, his chest aching at the memory of it. “Victor… I don’t know what happened to him, but I’m sure it was brutal. When I tried to find him, they’d taken him back to Latveria, probably with injuries leaving him nearly dead. That’s the last we heard of him. All of this was for some stupid schematics… Those very schematics that were used to save me. You see, Steve, my body was almost completely destroyed in the huge explosion when we crashed – I mean, think about it, oil tank and collision – of course there was an explosion. My body was taken back and I was a lost cause, about to be left to die, when Reed stepped in with the schematics and decided to use them to save me. So my own brainwork along with Reed’s was used to build me into the ideal robot, the ideal police tool, the perfect detective. Which is why and how I’m standing in front of you today.” Obviously there was some work needed on that ‘perfect’ police tool point, but Tony elected to leave that out for the time being.
Taskmaster was going to take a hell of a beating.
“We’re going to draw attention,” the young man said.
“I can get to him quicker with my boots.” Tony said, gasping and ducking back into the car when the open door knocked a lamp post with a loud PANG and flew off, hearing a couple of angry civilians scorning in the distance as the door rolled on the sidewalk with a loud screech.
“Superhumans are not humans. They are threats. Did you not view what happened with your previous comrade?”
“Yeah, yeah…” Hammer fanned his hand at the man. “A deals a deal, come on Tony!”
Tony nodded understandably and eventually they reached the now gated off Central Park. Large jagged iron bars decorated outside, all that were once black now covered with a green moss that crept from the base to the spikes. It looked haunting, dark, with very few streetlights around – only a couple of flickering lights from the broken lamps nearby.
“Hey Cap… I’ve been waiting for you…” he powered up his repulsor blast, which was pointed directly at Steve, the brightness forcing Steve’s eyes to narrow. Instead of getting up, he was forced to roll to the side to avoid the blast that was aimed right toward him.  He was unmasked, eyes a bright purple – just like Taskmaster.
“Back when I re-joined the Avengers huh..? Days were much simpler back then.”
There were two guards by the main door, two large henchmen that were quite clichéd in terms of appearance; bald, burly and wearing white suits. If he didn’t know better they looked as though they were based off the King Pin, especially with the large canes that they both held.
“You know what, Victor, I’ve always been a fan of heavy metal but this takes it to a whole new level.”
“He’s made more than just one crazy one, I heard a rumour that once he made a robot that was in love with him.”
“Under the bed, by the left hand side.”
“Tony..?” Steve asked.
Blood tasted better than the finest of wine.
There was a voice from the distance, and a man with a white hood with orange lining stepped out from one of the hidden corners of the alley, “You give us info, and we’ll give it to you,” he said.
“No use apologising, the past is the past. I’m a futurist Steve, I thought you would’ve realised that by now.” As annoyed as he was, the feeling of Steve’s soft breath skimming over his cheek made his voice sound softer, it made his heart flutter. Steve was being so touchy today, not that Tony was complaining in the slightest. Maybe today was the day. Maybe it was time to let the super soldier know how he’d felt all this time, throughout all these years. But what was there to say and how would he phrase it?
“Steve…” Tony whimpered.
That HURT. It really did. Tony was dazed, struggling to get up off the ground. He could hear parts of him pop out of place; unfortunately the impact was so hard that a couple of screws had fallen loose. Again the projection appeared above his head of birds singing and circling around the top of his hat while he smacked his glove, trying to get it to power up again to work but it kept morphing between a real looking hand and his red metal glove with the mechanism having fallen out of joint.
“Don’t lie!” Tony’s tone gradually became more ferocious. He didn’t want to lose Steve after he had just gotten him back, straight away he took a glance over his shoulder at Steve, making sure he was okay. The Captain was fine, his eyes focused on the man walking toward them and taking according steps backward, even though Steve was never one to cower away. He was only moving back because Tony was the one taking the steps backward until they backed into the main computer which they were using in the first place.
It was like music to his ears.
“Where are we headed?”
“Those chemicals of yours got blown up along with all of your labs, in fact, everyone’s labs. There’s no science, there is only obeying and adapting.”
It was getting worse.
It took months on end for Tony to recover from it, hell, he couldn’t even stand in front of cameras and deliver a coherent speech, and talking in public was his forte. If he couldn’t manage to pull himself together just for that, he didn’t know what he could do. Resorting to drinking again, without his pillar to keep him sturdy, seemed the best option he had. He loved Steve very much and he didn’t need to say it for everyone to know that the feeling was mutual, and it was just a sheer shame that things had to end up this way.
Whilst trying to scratch the sticker off his heel, Tony attempted to gather his thoughts;
“That was a long time ago. Unfortunately…it was unsustainable.” Zola paced his lab in one of the newer models of his body. He remembered events extremely well, including the invention of his ‘son’ using Steve’s blood to create a child with super soldier abilities. That was soon used against him, and brought upon him his own downfall. There was a victorious spring in his step as his absurdly large eyes from the projection screen in his modified body’s chest darted from test tube to test tube. “There are much more…
Tony stared at him with wide blue eyes, not believing what he was hearing; were heroes actually getting killed by people?
“Why was I kept in that room for so long? You said it yourself, it’s like I lived a life, a virtual life, for so long…  Why wasn’t I woken up?”
“I’ll… I’ll get you a punching bag in there, and I’ll bring some paper, hey, maybe you can finish that drawing of me?” He tried to suggest, compelled to lift the mood of the soldier.
“My… My hand,” he stuttered, eyes fixed on the tool that he had used to create, now replaced.
“Clint, come on…” Anya pleaded from behind, pushing Clint’s back to try to get him to follow Maria.
That glimpse of fear along with the words made Steve’s eyes snap back to their usual azure, gently placing Tony back to the ground against the cabinet and turning to Norman silently, sleekly. He drew his shield out and swiftly drew it back.
I am lost without him… Without my guiding star.
“Don’t mention it, Cap, really. Now come on, I’m getting hungry and a little tired so we’ll give this place one more sweep and head back to your new home.”
JARVIS was huddled up by the wall, his tail having extended into a wire that was plugged into a huge fuse panel outdoors. His eyes were lit up green with binary floating across where his eyes were usually as he searched through the security protocols.
The behemoth of a man took Carol’s arm, lightly at first and gave her a deadpan expression. She tried to smile reassuringly but the grip began to tighten and tighten. That moment she knew this man wasn’t desperate, there was just something wrong with him. She tried to yank her arm away, but even with her extreme strength he pulled her down, throwing her to the floor with immense force.  The concrete slab which she was thrown against cracked with the weight of her back pushing down on it. She let out a yelp of pain and Jessica ran in, only for another woman this time around the same height as Jessica to run in and punch her hard in the gut. She came out of nowhere, again at a speed that didn’t match her body. That same deadpan expression echoed throughout, and she turned around with precision and elbowed Spiderwoman whilst she was winded. Tony didn’t want to stand there and watch, and he certainly wasn’t going to even if he was instructed to.
Tony pulled away, covering his face over his hand and falling to his knees,
No, it was Osborn’s fault, Norman Osborn had made him do this. He pushed him to his limits, and it was only with Tony saving him from the control that he was freed from the prisons of his mind.
been. But fine, I’ll get him down here.” The last few words escaped as a hesitant growl. Tony reached into his pocket for his phone and texted Steve, but when he didn’t receive a reply, he decided to tell the others that he would fetch him himself. Worried to say the least, Tony made his way toward Steve’s room where he presumed the captain was.
“Oh… Holy shit!” He cursed, not expecting that. It was amazing, this pulsing was pushing against his sweet spot over and over, making his body shudder with bliss, his eyes shutting whilst beads of sweat trickled down his back.
“Oh say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light!” Hammer sang with a tone deaf voice that made Steve cringe.
“Deep breaths…” he whispered to himself, as though trying to calm himself with a vocal mantra.
Steve tried to be a little lighter, but when he felt Tony flinch again he looked up at him with a stern leer.
the man
“Thank you, for this.”
He held his shield ready, doing the same spin and sending the Vibranium serrated disk toward Tony.
This had become his routine; whenever either of them had a nightmare that they simply couldn’t put behind them, they would venture into each other’s rooms provided they didn’t have company and rest assured that they would be safe next to one another. It was a mutual understanding, a bond that they had both shared, even just as friends…though that additional comfort was undeniably something more. Once more, it became apparent to Tony that Steve was his support system. After that entire…episode back in the searing heat of Death Valley, Tony was filled with constant nightmares of Steve being taken away from him yet again in the worst ways possible. He was grateful that he didn’t have to explain that aloud to Steve.
Tony tilted his head, used to being the one doing the looking after, not the other way around.
“That’s…”
It was Tony’s turn to tackle the bars. He stepped up to them and powered up the beam in his chest again but made a whimper of hesitation when he remembered how terrible the force of recoil was and how far it sent him back in the building. Although he couldn’t feel the pain to its full extent, he didn’t like how it had shaken him. Tony’s brain still had memories, it still had certain thoughts and had the feeling of hesitation that Steve had seemingly lost and thus restraint held him back.
“Don’t say that.”
“Steve, whats wrong?” Tony pressed his hands by the microphone.
Steve wanted to get that sensitive reaction out of Tony, so he pushed his fingers deeper, resting his chin on Tony’s chest to observe his reaction which was a louder moan, filling the empty room with that sudden cry.
“I can’t seem to find a window…” Thor shouted from the distance.
Steve stared at the holograms, eyes following their every move as Tony began to flick through and bring up projections with ease, into buildings, people that moved, people that talked. He had never seen anything like it in his entire life and he didn’t know whether to be afraid of it or whether to accept what he was being told. Everything seemed so factual, so real and solid. Information being thrown at him and being forced to accept it was an extremely bewildering feeling. But the man next to him seemed so thrilled to be preaching about development and how things have changed, even introducing his company to him. Steve was familiar with the company; in fact it should’ve clicked sooner – Stark.
Tony’s touch was electric, their tongues intertwined and muffling the moans from the both of them.
“What was that? I didn’t hear…” He said with a soft smirk.
“At least this is a short cut to the top floor which I assume they’re hiding in.” Tony said.
“Tony, Tony we have to go, we have to get out of here! We have to go tell the others…!” Steve’s hand moved to his radio, trying to press the device only to hear static and loud explosions in the distance. His breathing quickened. “Tony, Iron Man!”
Before Carol had time to speak, Jessica dashed by and grabbed her, knocking her to the ground and out of the way of the missile that shot into the space that Carol once stood in, Danny and Luke both running back as far as they could.
For a moment Tony held out his hand, shooting his repulsor into the sky, but making a drawing with the beam of light in the shape of a heart. Corny, Steve thought, but adorable. It only caused Steve to chuckle under his breath and loop his arm closer around the other.
that he shared that connection with Steve after years of fighting at his side.
“HOLY SHI-!” he cut himself off, rubbing the side of his face that he’d hit on the bedframe on the way down.
“It’s not Stark at all, look, this says… Property of Victor Von Doom.”
“Wait so… Who else can see them? I don’t get this whole angel thing, forgive my lack of knowledge.”
But instead of jets powering up, the rollerblades popped out and Tony’s eyes shot open, Steve gasping loudly as all three of them were dragged down for the bumpy ride, yelling loudly, pitch changing with each heavy step that they bumped down.
He watched it flicker until an image finally cleared, eye narrowing on the vision that was before him of Steve walking about the city. This was all what was going on in the mind of the super soldier, and was being manufactured by the simulator.
“Cap! Steve..!” The ghostly voice called.
“I love you…” Tony whispered uncontrollably, the fire inside him being lit after being dormant for years
Steve, however, was worried about Tony, slipping out of the open space where the car door used to be and jumping out, climbing on top of his rival’s car for a second with ease to ensure that Tony was okay, but when he saw the detective slowly get to his feet and fix his hat on, he knew that he was fine. Moments later there was a stream of bright cyan as Tony resorted to using his jet boots again. Steve made a mental note to remind Tony to fix those boots when he could.
Just as MODOK exclaimed, the jet that was keeping his chair afloat flattered and suddenly stopped, sending him to the ground with a loud
“We don’t know. We’ve never seen them… If they’ve managed to brainwash Osborn into working for them, they must be powerful.”
Steve licked his lips and pushed the empty tray away. “M-more…”
Tony’s eyes widened at the revelation. “Osborn’s brainwashed…?”
Once back on course Tony continued to navigate. “Left, Straight, keep goin’!” he shouted with excitement, hearing the buzz of adrenaline ringing through his ears. Steve felt exactly the same way, eyes on the road until they spotted the end of a purple and yellow painted Peugeot just over the hill.
“Hold on, stand right there.”
“Who says this has to be the last?” Steve asked, finding it easy to get lost in Tony’s eyes, catching them dazzle through the eyeslits of the old mask.
“Thirteen, here we are!” He said, his loud voice echoing throughout the passage.
“Oh, you’ll see.”
after that entire fiasco. His heart was still drumming, even as he held Steve over his shoulder, switching once both of his hands were free to carry him bridal style. Steve looped his arms around Tony’s neck for security, watching as the golden faceplate slipped over once more and Tony made his way out the same way he had come in, this time with his friend resting there in his arms.
“Will you?” Steve asks. His voice low and soft, his eyes fixated on the dark haired billionaire that stood with his arms dangling at each side, mouth wide open.
“Yeah, just a
JARVIS chimed in, “Humble is one word for it…”
Steve made a snappy movement and his hands went to his stomach.
“That is actually disgusting,” Peter said, lifting his mask and giving the bundle a stare of revolt.
Tony felt his lip quiver. It only helped to reassure himself that Cap was a relentless soul that refused to die, so he couldn’t have been beaten this easily, could he? Only statistics could confirm.
Chief Fury was in full uniform, with badges and ribbons decorating his lapel, with further decoration on his shoulders to signify his higher rank. Steve was certainly no stranger to authority like that, and tried not to stare at the eyepatch the man had either covering his left eye with the string tucked neatly behind his grey sideburns. He was quite the sight, clearly a war veteran that had turned to helping out the police.
“Oh, like you? You’re a relic!” Now it became personal. “Fury kept you under because he knew you couldn’t handle it, and now look, you can’t handle it. You think destroying the future of technology is the best way forward instead of repairing it? And I’m supposed to be the futurist here, the one that destroys and moves on, and yet I take from your mentality and I’m being persecuted by the man who always sees the best in things… Technology isn’t your forte, Rogers, stay back and let me work.”
“My darling, my daughter is stuck in that tree!” she wailed, clutching her pearl necklace.
Everything comes back to
Tony glanced back up, still hurt. “I know Steve, I’m trying to make this process as quick as I can… McCoy is coming in and he should be able to help more than I can.” He muttered. “I want to get you out of here Steve, do you think I enjoy seeing you cooped up like this?” Tony’s eyebrows slanted and he pressed his palm against the glass, resisting the urge to punch it.
Being a director wasn’t all perks that was for sure, and became particularly relevant as soon as he had to go through the expenditure and give a sign off on certain things to the accountants and so on – masses of bureaucracy went into running a huge industry like that, and finance was the most meticulous process.  As he was sifting through the papers he’d noticed something – an expense that was being diverted to a subsidiary off the coast of England. Tony’s hand ran along his well-trimmed beard, pinching his chin a little as he ran through the spending which was for equipment, utilities, payrolls – all to a place off the coast of England that he had never once been made aware of. In fairness, he hadn’t ever fine lined the finances this thoroughly, but it still concerned him. He got to his feet and started going through the old files that were still in paper form, sifting through the large folders and trying to find what on earth was in that location.
“Why not get it off your own work then?”
I am talentless.
He held the pillow close, and there was silence minus their soft breathing, the occasional creek of the springs when either of them turned, particularly Tony with the weight of the armour. They both needed food and water, but that could be settled later, knowing Peter and how he was surviving – he probably knew somewhere to get the supplies.
“I’ll be back for you,” he growled to Taskmaster before setting off.
“I won’t slack, just give me a cup of coffee in the morning and I’ll be completely fine.” Tony gestured casually, giving Steve’s chest a little tap. “You take care, Cap. Don’t get kidnaped while I’m asleep.”
“Tony.” There it was, that dreaded powerful tone T’Challa could use, strong enough to command a country. Then again, Tony knew the real reason that he was so invested was because he didn’t want the strain of whatever Steve had to spread to his own lands.
Steve got to his feet with a wobble, holding onto Tony for support then helping him stand properly, seeing the slight slump in his posture.
“Don’t you dare!”
A light grab to his shoulder.
Steve let out a chuckle. “Come on, I’ll ask Reed to open the next portal for us.” He wrapped his arm around the armoured man’s waist and walked on, stepping through a giant square portal of blue light that formed just in front of them.
“I just want information… Nothing more, and it seems to me like I’m saving your life here.”
“Float like a butterfly, sting like a wasp!”
“What is the point?”
That argument about him being outdated was a defence mechanism and Steve knew it, even though it made alarm bells ring, and he could see right through his lies. He knew he wasn’t the best at using tech, but he certainly knew how to learn and adapt as quickly as anyone else could, if not quicker. He wondered if Tony underestimated him all this time, and although his morals
“Sorry Chief, guess this is why you should digitize files huh? I should help you with that sometime.” The man said in a cocky, confident voice as he removed that fedora that Steve had spotted and pushed his hand through his short, neatly trimmed black hair with stunning blue eyes that were earlier hidden by the shade casted by the hat.
It broke Tony’s heart.
“Way there? Where are we going?”
“These results indicate that he, at the time, had no cardiac function. Yet his blood was somehow being pushed through his body, circulating the serum.”
He could see his armoured fingers touch the steel, finally getting a grip of it and using the planes speed to steady himself. Once he heaved himself onto the wing he ran, staggering from the movements of the vehicle to try and reach for the door, spring boarding off the wing toward the door. Either that, or he’d have to blast a hole into the plane to bring it down, but he’d rather not risk the lives of the crew on board. Even if they were some sort of cyber Nazi-police force. That reminded him to find out more about these people later – all he knew is that once heroes were caught they were never seen again, and that simply wasn’t good enough in terms of information. Tony was all about the details.
Tony flashed a slanted smirk even though Steve couldn’t see him, “Heartless isn’t the word, stubborn is much more appropriate…maybe even headstrong, if I’m trying to hit the nail on the head.”
“You boys have always been connected; it doesn’t take any machinery to enhance that,” she said, swinging her feet in contentment.
A fashion trend.
A light dizziness befell him. Luckily, he was on a table.
“It… Your fingers…”
Steve carefully opened the door using the silver doorknob and stepped inside, closing the door behind him and standing strict and straight, just like he had done in the academy, holding his hand up to his brow to salute his new chief.
Then he could feel it again. As though he couldn’t fall further into the pit of despair, he could feel the world crumble beneath him, falling further and further into sadness and sorrow, regret and remorse.
“That’s the one!”
He walked into his kitchen and slipped off his black blazer, the truth was that he didn’t wear any colour asides from black since Steve’s death; although that wasn’t a conscious decision it became apparent that he was mourning to everyone who saw him, including Pepper who decided that it was best to keep her distance for once. Tony needed space to heal, so they thought, since the man loved to do things independently, but in fact, Tony needed comfort and company. Nothing hurt him more than seeing his teammates turn against him like that and even though many times he had been accused of not having a heart but it was then that he himself felt his heart thud and ache with loneliness.
“He does not love you, Steven Rogers. We are on the threshold of change, that man evolves and I am here to facilitate that evolution and give nature a helping hand. We shall be one. You are in our way.”
T’Challa had done a great job evacuating the city, as he said he’d do. It was clear from the get go that there was something big lurking on the horizon, so T’Challa’s call to evacuate the city was certainly a good idea, but it left them in this barren city that they were both so used to being the centre of attention, the hustle and bustle being nothing but a quiet whisper of the wind now. Hammer’s explosives not only impacted the factory – there was a trigger of explosives spanning the entirety of the city that looked as though they had all detonated at the same time. The smoke was turning white, the rain having extinguished most of the embers by now. If there were stragglers left after T’Challa’s evacuation, then they had most certainly looted the stores. Broken glass was scattered everywhere, store windows were clearly broken into, displays were taken, and clothes and some items littered the streets.
