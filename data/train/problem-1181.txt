"Why?" John growled out.
"Yes, you do." John told him and noted a wide smile on the Alpha's face. "What are you so happy about?"
"Oh, good you follow." Sherlock said as he begun digging around Van Coon's pockets.
"No, you didn't." John teased gently bumping against him.
"Okay." John said knowing that none of the questions he had piling up would be answered. The drive to where ever they were going was a good 15 to 20 minutes long, and when they pulled into what seemed to be a recently abandoned factory (or maybe this mysterious phone caller was just that powerful to have a factory emptied out for tonight), John military training kicked in. As soon as he was allowed out of the car, John's eyes focused on the nicely dress man standing in front of the car while casually leaning on an umbrella. Was he about to finally meet the Mysterious caller? John squared his shoulders and limped over to the man.
"Yes. He was being threatened." Sherlock told him examining the (was that origami?) newly acquired evidence before grabbing an evidence bag from the Beta forensic woman, and bagged it. The smell of another Alpha entered the room seconds before Sherlock straightened up, attention on the new Alpha. John turned to look at the Alpha. He was taller than John yet still slightly shorter than Sherlock with short, dark brown hair and annoyed eyes.
And for weeks that was their life. Nothing changed. And Sherlock didn't mind it as much as he thought he would. Because, even though they didn't do much of anything but be with each other, life with John was
"I don't know, get a flat share or something?" Mike suggested.
"Not what?" Sherlock asked looking at him causing John to blush in embarrassment.
"Come on, come on. Quickly!" Sherlock hissed at his computer.
"Cup of tea would be lovely." John called to her as she began to leave while picking up the news paper she had left on the arm of the chair he was sitting in. "Thank you."
"Not a word." Mike said smirking at John. It would seem he had just proved a point Mike had made to the Omega earlier.
"Look at him, dashing about..." Mrs Hudson muttered before shaking her head and turning to look at John who was fighting the urge to get up and follow Sherlock. He was curious about what was going on while at the same time he wanted Sherlock to know that he wasn't one to be bossed around. "My Mate was just the same. But you're more the sitting-down type, I can tell." John saw her eyes flash to his cane and annoyance rose in him. If only he didn't have this damn limp. "I'll make you that cuppa, you rest your leg."
"Ah, Molly! Coffee, thank you." Sherlock interrupted, bored of John's question, and handed the Omega his phone back while turning to take the coffee from Molly. She had removed her lipstick. "What happened to the lipstick?"
"John... John!" Sherlock gasped out. Help!
"You're very loyal very quickly." He pointed out.
"I call it..." The young man paused in spray painting to take a step back and look at his Sherlock with a flirtatious smirk, "Urban Bloodlust Frenzy." John glared at the young Omega and stepped closer to Sherlock. It didn't seem to matter to John that Sherlock hadn't even seemed to notice the flirtation as he scrolled through his phone. All that mattered to John right now was that he had seen the Young Omega flirting with his Alpha, and John needed to put him in his place.
"I don't have to!" John snapped back. It seemed to take Sherlock a few seconds to understand what John was saying because a second later Sherlock had pulled him to him. "Yeah, but if you were clever, really clever. Jennifer Wilson running all those lovers, she was clever. She's trying to tell us something."
"You were gonna take that damn pill, weren't you?" John accused, knowing he was right. He had seen the look in Sherlock's eyes, seen the trimmer in his hand from the urge to take it.
"No, he wanted rid of it. He left her. He gave the phone to you. That says he wants you to stay in touch. You're looking for cheap accommodation and you're not going to your brother for help. That says you've got problems with him. Maybe you like his Mate. Maybe you don't like his drinking."
"This is childish." Sherlock growled.
"What about the message, though?" The Inspector asked.
"You think he's stupid enough to go there?" John asked.
"Yeah, I didn't get the shopping." John told him as his eyes scanned over everything. Had Sherlock left any clues, besides the scratch on the table, that a fight had taken place? Sherlock stopped skimming the book to look at John worriedly. How would John react? Would he yell? Would he worry over Sherlock and demand to check for injuries? Would he not feel safe and leave?
"Of the body. You're a medical man." Sherlock said nodded towards the body.
"Her name's Jennifer Wilson according to her credit cards, we're running them now for contact details. Hasn't been here long. Some kids found her." The Inspector informed them as Sherlock glanced back at John who smiled silently letting him know he was fine. Once they had got to the room where the victim was, John was shocked to see an Omega woman dressed in nothing but pink. It was almost like looking at a bottle of pepto in human form. Sherlock wasted no time in beginning to examine the body.
"Her daughter?" Sherlock asked removing his nose from John's hair, but still held on to him. "Why would she write her daughter's name? Why?"
"Almost can." Sherlock corrected pulling John as close to him as her could. "You did get shot, though."
"Basically." Sherlock agreed.
"Shoulder! I thought so." Sherlock said.
"I'm guessing there's no point in asking where I'm going." John said.
"It's not what they saw." Sherlock muttered trying to keep himself focused on the case and not how delicious John was starting to smell. "It's what they both brought back in those suitcases."
"Anderson won't work with me." Sherlock said looking away confusing John on what was going on.
"Don't wanna use mine. Always a chance that my number will be recognized. It's on the website." Sherlock said.
"'They take the poisons themselves', that's what you said." John said. "He makes them take it. Well, maybe he talks to them. Maybe used the death of her daughter somehow."
"I know. It's how we met. It really quite fascinating." John said smiling softly at Sherlock while squeezing his hand. Sherlock gave John as small wink before smirking at Sebastian who didn't seem to know how to react. It would seem he isn't used to being ignored by an Omega.
"Yes, you see, neither of us have our keys on us. Stupid us, I know. But we were in a hurry." John told her. "But even though our door is locked, I
"'Harry Watson.' Clearly a family member who's given you his old phone. Not your father, this is a young man's gadget. Could be a cousin, but you're a war hero who can't find a place to live. Unlikely you've got an extended family, certainly not one you're close to. So brother it is. Now, Clara, who's Clara?" Sherlock asked looking back at the engraving. "Three kisses says it's a romantic attachment. The expense of the phone says Mate, not girlfriend. Must have given it to him recently. This model's only six months old. Bond is in trouble then, six months on he's just given it away. If she'd left him, he would have kept it. People do. Sentiment." He said growling the last word.
"Oh, we're done waiting. Look at her, really look! Houston, we have a mistake. Get on to Cardiff. Find out who Jennifer Wilson's family and friends were. Find Rachel!" Sherlock ordered getting to the ground floor.
"Clings to walls like an insect." Sherlock continued deducing, ignoring the Detective. "That's how he got in." He said looking out the skylight to the roof.
"Sorry." John apologized after Sherlock shoved a man out of his way into an apartment building. John chased him up the flight of stairs until the came to the roof. Where was Sherlock taking them?
"Brian Lukis, freelance journalist, murdered in his flat. Doors locked from the inside." Sherlock told the Detective before turning the computer around to show him the article.
"Alright. We have one more stop before we can go home and get you something to eat."
"The wound's on the right side of his head." Sherlock pointed out.
"What?" Sherlock asked distractedly. "Yeah, yeah. I'm fine."
"He's your brother?" John asked.
"Watch..." The man said and the camera turned away from him. "There is another camera on the building opposite you. Do you see it?" John instantly searched the camera out. Someone was either playing with him or trying to prove a point. The second John spotted the camera, it too was moved to point away from him. "And finally, at the top of the building on your right." John turned around and spotted the camera just before it, too, was turned. He got the point. Who ever was on the other end of the phone had connections, powerful connections.
"How do you feel about the violin?" Sherlock said turning his attentions back to John, his new flatmate.
get a
"Well, they've got it wrong, Sebastian. He was murdered." Sherlock told him causing Sebastian's smirk to widen.
"How are we going to figure out that cipher?" John asked, not wanting to distract Sherlock from The Work.
"No." Sherlock agreed. "So this investigation might move a bit quicker if you were to take my word as gospel." Dimmok looked away again in annoyance. "I've just handed you a murder inquiry. Five minutes in his flat." The two Alpha's glared at each other for a minute before Dimmok sighed and stood up.
The morning after the shooting, John woke up and it took his mind a few minute to realize he was alone in Sherlock's room. Slowly his mind recalled the memory of last night. After getting a taxi home and ordering delicious Chinese, Sherlock had taken John gently by the wrist and took him to his room, shocking John. When he had planned to go to bed last night, he had thought he would be taking the upstairs bedroom. But obviously, Sherlock had had other plans.
"Sorry?" John asked.
"I was just chatting with your secretary outside." Sherlock said and John's hand stopped trembling. "She told me." John glanced at him with questioning eyes but remained silent about his lie. A tense and angry silence fell over them before Sebastian broke it with a forced laugh. Sherlock had pissed him off.
"Yes, well." Sebastian said tight-liped, obviously barely holding in a snide remark about John. He pulled at his suit collar, obviously uncomfortable with John in his work space. Sherlock caught a glimpse of his watch, two days off. Traveled around the world. Twice. "Grab a pew." He ordered Sherlock who bit back the urge to be childish and remain standing. "Do you need anything, coffee, water?" Sebastian asked John. Sherlock bared his teeth at the Alpha, John was
"I guess that's the soldier in me." John snapped out. The man gave him a hard look before sighing in annoyance as he pulled his little notebook back out.
"Good, you're finally asking the right questions." Sherlock said before slamming the door shut. Without a word, Sherlock lead him back to the elevators and entered them. In the elevator, John gently removed Sherlock's fingers from around his wrist (they were starting to hurt) before slipping his hand into Sherlock's larger one and gave him a comforting squeeze.
"Oh, don't pretend you worked that out. Somebody told you that." Anderson hissed.
"That's not possible, Inspector, we texted him and he called back." John told him.
"Sure." John sighed out and the two of them slowly limped towards a coffee stand, well John limped and Mike awkwardly walked slowly next to him. After ordering coffee, John set off to find the closest bench to have Mike stop pitying him. The silence between them was tense for a couple of minutes before John finally broke it, not being able to stand it any longer.
Sherlock froze. John was upset. And he wasn't upset that there was not food in the flat, this happened about every other week. He was just using that as an excuse to take his anger out on Sherlock. So what had made his John so angry?
"Oh. Yeah, of course. Can I borrow your phone?" Sherlock asked forcing his mind back on the case. John's limp could come after the case, or at least until after he had sent the text message he needed to.
"I'm fine standing." He argued, yet remained seated while Sherlock glanced around the room. Moments later Sebastian Wilkes, an annoying Alpha, walked in.
"Nothing, just... 'Welcome to London.'" John quoted as they looked over to see the passenger talking to a real police man.
"You." Sherlock said. "Mrs Hudson! Dr Watson will be moving in."
"Oh, for God's sake!" Anderson complained.
John stared out the window watching the scenery pass them by as the sun sat while Sherlock typed away at his phone. John knew that if he was to get any of his questions answered, now would be a good time to do so before they got to the crime scene. John looked at Sherlock and opened his mouth only to sigh and close his mouth again. He didn't know if he would be bothering Sherlock with his questions or not. John shook his head and looked out the window only to have the Alpha sigh in annoyance.
"Why would I do that?" Sherlock asked defensively.
"What?" Dimmok demanded.
"Sorry." Sherlock said fight off a smile.
"You could always go yourself, you know." John told him, pausing on his way towards the kitchen to look at Sherlock. "You've been cooped in the flat for weeks waiting for an interesting case." Sherlock looked back at his book when his mind pulled up the very recent memory of the fight. "And what happened about that case you were offered, the Jaria Diamond?" John asked from the kitchen as he searched for Sherlock's card in his wallet.
"Come here." Sherlock had whispered, and John thought he had sounded unsure and slightly scared, as if afraid John would deny him. After hearing his tone, John had quickly climbed onto the bed and allowed Sherlock to pull him so that they were now back to chest. It felt strange to have someone laying beside him or, in Sherlock's case, wrapped around him.
"'Trust issues,' it says here." He read out and John paled. Had this man somehow gotten a hold of his confidential therapy notes? How much did this man know about him?
"Oh, you've no idea!" Mike responded to the Omega.
"Is that it?" John demanded and the tone of his voice caused Sherlock to stop. Had he not known John was an Omega, he would have thought he was an Alpha with that tone. John was becoming more interesting by the moment.
"Please, God, let me live." John said, saying the exact words he said in Afghanistan.
"I'm fine, Sherlock, I think I'm just hungry." John reassured him with a smile forcing himself to forget about the pain. It was well into the late afternoon, and he hadn't had anything but some toast for breakfast that morning, having been too nervous about his interview.
She put the cleaning products on a shelf next to her and moved forward, pulling John into a tight hug. Perplexed, he hugged back, patting her back lightly. She seemed unfazed by the sight she had walked in on and was already making herself comfortable with John.
“What?” John asked, suddenly worried something was terribly wrong. “Is everything okay?”

“I’m …” John glanced back at the door, making sure Mary wasn’t standing at the window listening. “I’m good, now that I’m talking to you.” Another nervous glance. “I … I miss you.”

“Take it, John. It belongs to you, after all,” Sherlock thrust it in John’s direction again, his aggressive movement betraying the real emotion that was boiling underneath the surface.
He used his hands to pull Sherlock up and turned so he could push him onto his back onto the bed. He then crawled onto the bed with him, straddling his ankles so he could pull of Sherlock’s trousers and throw them on the ground. Sherlock helped him to next pull off his underwear, shimmying out of them. He was rock hard and John was ridiculously dazed at the sight. He couldn’t believe it. He couldn’t believe that this beautiful, otherworldly man wanted
why is this coat still in the way?!” John demanded, mirth in his voice as he fumbled with the many buttons on Sherlock’s heavy coat.
shoes!” Sherlock gestured to the brown loafers, his face looking as if a tragedy had taken place. “You were supposed to wear something else! Must I take you shoe shopping myself?”
As Sherlock brewed the tea, he could hear John moving around in the living room before he settled himself on the sofa. And by the time Sherlock had emerged from the kitchen with two mugs of tea and a gingernut hanging from his mouth, John was lying down asleep, his brow furrowed and mouth hanging slightly open.
“Amazing,” Sherlock breathed, his chest still heaving.
“Sounds good to me.”
When he opened his eyes again, they were shining deep cerulean and emerald, drinking in the sight of John as if it were the last time they would see each other.
“I miss you too,” he answered and John was now certain he was smiling from just the sound of his voice through the phone. His voice sounded brighter when he was smiling.
“No,” Sherlock answered plainly. He glanced down with a derisive glance at the man’s hand on his waist. “I’d much rather call it a night, Lucas.”
“So John,” Sherlock spoke low, his voice seeming to crackle when he said John’s name. “Why are you deciding to learn to dance now?”
As his voice reverberated through the air, Sherlock shrunk away from the window, the curtain falling back across the glass so John could no longer see him. John ran his hands through his hair, frustration bubbling in his chest.
John stayed silent, his hands moving onto Sherlock’s penis, slowly stroking along his length. He heard Sherlock suck in a breath as he began to lick delicately along the underside before reaching the top and taking him in his mouth entirely. John felt Sherlock’s hand tighten in his hair slightly as he moved his head to suck with precision, his tongue lapping at the salty precome that was trickling from him. Soon Sherlock was completely erect, sighing out John’s name.
John found Sherlock standing on the sidewalk when he stepped out of the car, waiting.
John lifted his cappuccino to his lips, taking a sip – it was an average coffe, he would have much preferred tea. “So … just how likely do you think it will be that you get accepted for this job?”
John called and ordered the takeaway and when it arrived, he slipped into one of Sherlock’s many silk dressing gowns (“Why on earth do you have so many?!” John had said, perplexed. “One can never have too many dressing gowns, John,” Sherlock had answered sagely) and slipped downstairs to retrieve the food, taking his phone with him.
Chiming music began to fill the room and a lone ballerina ran onto the stage, dressed in a long white tulle tutu, a delicate silver tiara adorning her blonde hair. Beaming, she turned lithely, before flitting off into the wings again. John recognised the music flowing out of the speakers however, not having watched ballet before, he couldn’t place where it was from. As more ballerinas danced gracefully onto the stage and off again, John glanced into his programme and saw that this was called ‘
Mary sighed, nodding. “Yes, I think so. I like the Valley range, let’s go with that one.”
His chest was heaving, sweat glistening on his skin, and his eyes were half closed, lips parting so he could catch his breath. John was overcome with emotion at the sight and as soon as he saw Sherlock frown, that all too familiar crease appearing on his nose, John couldn’t bear it so he stood and made his way out of the auditorium, his head spinning.
“Where are you? It’s not Dad, is it?”
Mary’s face fell into a pout as she lay down in bed next to John, her hand coming to rest on his forearm gently. Her touch seemed to burn into his skin and all John wanted to do was rip himself away from it; instead he simply allowed her to keep her hand on him as she closed her eyes and sighed out “goodnight, then.”
John followed his sister in a daze, still reeling from the fact that she was in London when he had called. They moved into the elevator and he glanced at her as she swiped a keycard against the scanner and pressed the level they needed to go to. He noticed the deeper lines on her face and the faint dusting of grey that was slowly beginning to streak its way through her hair.
As John sat, Sherlock removed his jumper, pulling it over his head so he was just wearing his white shirt. John couldn’t help but drink in the sight of Sherlock’s taut stomach as he pulled his jumper off, which had caused the shirt underneath ride up to reveal his pale white skin. He tucked his shirt back into his pants before clicking play and sliding the remote across the floor away from him.
A laugh escaped John’s lips as he sat up slightly to look at Sherlock’s face: it was sweaty and red and his curls were now damp and askew. He looked utterly beautiful. John kissed him, smiling still. This was where he needed to be. This was home to him.
We have a mix of performances for you tonight, including movements from the Nutcracker and Sleeping Beauty. We also would like to welcome Sherlock Holmes, one of SDA’s newest teachers, who will be performing a special self-choreographed ballet for us.
"You know, I actually think there's a rule where it says sisters
The past tense wasn’t lost on John. He
“Hello?” he put the phone to his ear, hoping against hope that it would be Sherlock on the other end.
"Well, I just want you to know that it's never too late to back out. This is your life and you don't have any obligation to follow a path you don't want to go down." She said, removing her hands from John's hair.

“Because that’s not my home …

? He knew going upstairs surely meant their relationship was going to progress in some way or another: both he and Sherlock could feel it without it even being spoken out loud. Hell, John
Sherlock nodded, leaving the practice, feeling utterly mortified. This was the first man in many years who he felt he actually had a chance with and somehow, in those few minutes, he had fucked it all up.
“Love,” John came up beside Sherlock and placed his hand on his arm, “are you sure?”
"John!"
John listened to the lyrics in the song and thought it fitting for the situation. Sherlock’s dance came to an end and he stood in the middle of the room; his lips were parted, slightly breathless. John was silent for a beat, before he simply breathed, “
“Do you want to be my boyfriend?”
Harriet complied, opening one of the cupboards and pulling out a bottle of Bell’s whiskey. She placed it down on the bench and pulled out two glasses, pouring generous amounts for both. John snatched one up and gulped it down, screwing up his eyes as the searing liquor burned his throat and settled in his stomach. He put his glass back down, groaning at the taste, and nodded at Harry for another.
“Who?”
The pair sat naked on Sherlock’s bed and ate their food, with Sherlock ending up slopping curry sauce on his sheets. He sighed, attempting to wipe it off before resigning himself to throwing out the linen because of
The snake that had wrapped itself around his throat was tightening its grip.
Slowly, he leaned forward, letting his tongue graze the underside of John’s penis and John let out an audible groan at the feeling, his hand tightening in Sherlock’s hair. He couldn’t get enough of the sight of Sherlock at his feet, so beautiful, so perfect, everything he could ever dream of. Sherlock was his and he was Sherlock’s, he saw that now, wholly and clearly.
. Sherlock paused, waiting for John to become more comfortable and when John nodded his assent, Sherlock slowly pulled at John’s underwear, allowing them to fall to the ground. John’s erection sprang free and Sherlock just
“I’m not gay, Harry!” John protested, suddenly feeling defensive.

!” Sherlock exclaimed, switching off the music as he watched John from the piano.
? John was sure Sherlock was playing a joke on him. That, or he had just always been that pompous and John had never clued onto it before now.
Sherlock was greeted warmly when he entered the restaurant by a portly Italian who grasped Sherlock’s hand and shook it enthusiastically. The man, who Sherlock greeted as Angelo, had a booming voice as he received the pair.
“It was fine.” He answered curtly. “Actually, Mary, I’m pretty exhausted – I just want to go to sleep. We can talk in the morning.”
“Oh, John … take me …” Sherlock whined, resting his forhead on John’s and closing his eyes.
“A cab,” Sherlock gestured to the busy street. “No luck getting one then?”
John felt he must have looked like a bit of a dick, standing out in the rain, staring up at the building, crying quietly. His hair was sopping wet, water dripping into his eyes, not even a waterproof coat to protect him from the elements. He stared at the numbers on the door, contemplating whether he should knock and ask Mrs. Hudson if he could go upstairs. She wouldn’t be aware of the current situation between the pair, so it wouldn’t be like she would have any reason to send him away.
Sherlock looked up from unlocking his front door and his mouth fell open when he saw John, his body frozen for a moment as he registered the situation.
“I have to go …” John managed to say and Sherlock didn’t bother to hide his disappointment. “I’m sorry, Sherlock. I really am.”
“Wait … job interview? What job interview? Sussex?” John was suddenly very aware that he was almost panicking. If Sherlock got a job in Sussex, that meant that he would move there. That meant that John would either not be able to see him anymore, or somehow he would have to either move to be with him or travel back and forth between London and there. He couldn’t believe Sherlock would leave him behind so easily.
“Just …” John waved his hand in a nonchalant fashion, attempting to play off his dark mood. “… stuff at home. I’m fine.”
“Oh, don’t mind him, John,” Mrs. Hudson said, noting the look exchanged between the two men, “he can be quite rude sometimes but he’s really a big softy.”
“I just want to talk to him,” he pleaded. His voice broke, betraying the true emotions inside John’s chest. His initial thought was that he wanted to fold himself into Mrs. Hudson’s arms, allowing her to hold him until the cold left his bones.
John lay awake in bed that night, his mind spinning over his impending marriage with Mary. He was wondering whether Sherlock would realise the date was merely days away and whether he knew that John was going through with it. He wondered whether Sherlock was moving on just as John was trying to.
“What? Uh, no. I’ll just finish up with this, maybe just go take a seat while I do? It’s a bit boring, really.

“We can talk about that later. Text me when you’re nearly here and I’ll meet you outside, okay?” Harriet was always blunt and to the point, somehow managing to get her way every time, and this was no exception.
Thanks for reading!
Another sigh. “John. I … I am going for a job interview on Sunday. In Sussex. I want you to come with me. For support.”
“Will you stay the night?” Sherlock asked, still lying on his back, enjoying the weight of John’s hand in his.
“—no, no, I didn’t mean – do they have vegetarian options?” John quickly cut in, feeling panicked that he was now missing out on his chance.
“Oi,” John quipped. “You a bit grumpy?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He was so close to telling John his true feelings earlier he could still taste the words on his tongue – they were bitter and he resented them because of course how true they were and the fact that John wouldn’t reciprocate. Of course he wouldn’t when he was grieving his dead wife and had just been through a traumatic ordeal in which he had nearly beaten Sherlock to death. Sherlock had accepted John’s apology and he would never hold his actions against him, however it still didn’t push away the hurt it had caused Sherlock. It still didn’t push away the memory of the look in John’s eyes when he was standing over Sherlock, hands clenching and unclenching, with a face that said “you’re dead to me”.
“Mm,” Sherlock hummed. “I think Indian?”
,” Sherlock whined. “Oh, please, John.
“Your seven minutes is up. Enjoy your wedding, John. I hope she makes you very happy.”
John extended his hand towards Mary as she turned, picking up her dress, and walked with quick footsteps back to her car. His head was spinning and he suddenly felt as though he were going to vomit. Glancing behind him, he saw that Sherlock had disappeared too.
“And how can I resist when you always end up producing the most delicious sounds when I do things like that?” John smiled again, his mind becoming overwhelmed at the sight of Sherlock’s wet and pouting lips.
“Hey,” he said, lying with the phone up to one ear.
Mary laughed freely, before wheezing out a “Please
Harriet moved across the room and joined John at the window. “Work. And Gina wanted some space. I’m pretty sure we’re broken up.
John’s eyes welled up again as he took in the bruises Sherlock had sustained from the beating in the morgue. He could never forgive himself for doing that to Sherlock, not ever. However, he did vow to never allow himself to get to that point again.
“Marlene, don’t you have …
“Battenburg!” she exclaimed happily.
“What?” John’s voice was breathy as his hands moved further up under Sherlock’s shirt, feeling his tight waist and then moving up to his shoulders, which were all hard muscle, yet small and petite. John now understood the attraction people had when they spoke about dancer’s bodies after laying his eyes on Sherlock.
“You’re uptight in your shoulders, particularly your left, previous injury, I bet. And your shoes are exacerbating the problem. You need to loosen up before we try anything - my form of teaching will not work if you’re not
John felt as if he were watching the scene unfold from above as he pushed his card into Sherlock’s cold hands, his fingertips lingering on his soft skin, before turning and beginning to march down the street, unsure where it would lead him. He felt as though his heart was being ripped from his chest and it took all his energy to stop himself from turning around and begging Sherlock to take him back.
Sherlock nodded, moving away to show John another movement, his cheeks flushed.
“Yes.
“It’s not enough.” Sherlock’s lips formed the words and John felt them like a knife.
After his shower, he changed into his clothes from the day before, feeling slightly dirty, and found Sherlock in the living room, standing at the window and staring absentmindedly out onto Baker Street below. John walked up next to him and placed a hand on the small of his back, joining him in looking out the window – it was beginning to rain, a light dusting of moisture misting over London.
“Love is the most honest thing we can give each other.”
John grabbed a fistful of the front Sherlock’s coat and pulled him into him, pressing their lips together, hard. At this stage, he didn’t care who saw the pair together – he only knew he needed Sherlock like he needed the blood that was currently pumping violently through his veins. He smiled into Sherlock’s mouth, using his teeth to gently pull at his lower lip, prompting a whining groan to escape from Sherlock.
“No, I’m not gay,” John said defensively. “I like women ... but I also like men – Mary, can we not do this here?”
was the one in the wrong.
whenever you want, Sherlock.”
Sherlock opened his eyes and looked John in the face and he knew it was over. They were finished. John knew this from the way Sherlock was looking at him as if he were deleting all the memories they had together. He felt as though his legs were going to give out from under him.
John placed a hand on his arm, settling the tremor in his hand as he reached inside his pocket for his money. Raising his eyebrows, he didn’t break eye contact with Sherlock, and handed over his own cash before Sherlock could with the driver who grunted his thanks. He was enjoying this game of distraction with Sherlock, who was melting into his hands easier than he thought would be possible.
This was written in about two days in between work and recovering from being sick, so here's hoping I got it down how I wanted.
Moving into the room, Sherlock met him halfway, his eyes regarding him calmly. There was a brief moment of silence before Sherlock let out a small

John placed his hands in Sherlock’s hair, stroking him tenderly.
“I actually am,” Sherlock said, his eyes falling on John. “It’s fine. I’ll forget about it soon enough.”
Sherlock’s hands moved up to cover John’s and he pulled away from him, taking another step away from John. The space between them was beginning to feel like a stretch of time, an empty plain of space where the only thing that held them together was a thin thread.
“I trust you,” John answered quietly, allowing Sherlock to quietly manoeuvre John’s legs and feet.
She folded her arms across her chest and regarded John seriously, her breath steaming in front of her, curling above her head in slow, thick tendrils. Shaking her head, she moved forward in her slippers, reaching out a hand to place it on John’s arm, stopping him from pacing up and down in front of her.
There was a brief moment of silence in which John waited with baited breath. Something was happening, he could tell by the way Sherlock lips were pulled into a tight smile; John’s stomach was suddenly doing flips.
“I’ve decided to take up dancing lessons,” John spoke quickly, his eyes not looking up at his fiancé who was standing across from him in their kitchen - he didn’t want her to catch a glimpse of the rosy red that was creeping up his neck.
“Would you take someone back? If they did what I did?” John asked, glancing at her from the corner of his eye.
“Oh, uhm …” Sherlock turned to face John in the bathroom, his face thoughtful. “No.”

John turned away, not wanting to look at Sherlock for fear he might stay longer, and left. It was only when he was sitting in his cab, heading home, that he felt his eyes welling up. Yes, it was obvious Sherlock was falling for John. But it was only now that John realised he was actually falling for Sherlock as well.
(See the end of the chapter for
Was that an innuendo?
He still looked like himself. If only he
much about you!” she said as she moved back, holding him at arm’s length to look over him. “What a handsome catch, Sherlock! Oh, how lovely!”
“An old friend,” Sherlock was quiet, not offering any more information and John had a feeling this person was more than an ‘old friend’. John understood the silence from Sherlock, however, and chose not to pry into it.
“Wait,” Sherlock spoke urgently.
to look at another person’s unfinished work without their permission, John.”
John opened his eyes, looking up at the man in front of them and he couldn’t help but smile; it felt as if they were the only two people in the world and John was intoxicated by him. A mixture of music, awkwardness, and happiness at the fact that he was actually
I wanted to add in a little bit of canon here, adding my twist to it, so I hope you all think it's okay.
“John …” she whispered into the back of his neck as his crying subsided into quiet sniffles. “John, what’s wrong, love?”
John drew away and looked at Sherlock, whose eyes were fluttering open; his was mouth parted, allowing his heavy breathing to escape his lips. When he saw John looking at him with an amused twinkle in his eyes, he changed his expression to that of nonchalance.
Sherlock’s eyes never left John’s and without hesitation, Sherlock simply said with a shrug “They’re obnoxious.” A sly smile played at Sherlock’s lips as he saw John’s face frown in horror.
“You okay? You’ve been in there a while.”
John thought, amused at the sight of this polished man feeling slightly anxious.
“Go on …” John answered hesitantly.
“Are you hungry?” he asked, slightly breathless.
without fear had turned his brain to mush which showed in his face (Sherlock thought he looked rather gormless as he looked up at him, although it was quite charming at the same time).
Flouncing into the room, Sherlock threw himself down on a couch that was sat up against the back wall, crossing his arms and legs tightly, a scowl darkening his features.
Mary eyes narrowed playfully and she leapt from her seat, grabbing onto John’s hand, pulling her up with him. “Come on, Mr. Watson. You’re going to dance with your wife to be.”
“I had a few at the pub after work with Stamford,” John lied.
to Mary. For the first time in their relationship.
There was a beat of silence where the two men observed each other. John knew their lesson was up, but he suddenly wanted to spend more time with this man – he was enjoying himself and knew that when he got home it would be back to boredom, Sheppard’s pie, and Mary’s favourite reality TV show. Sherlock seemed to be feeling the same way as he stood across from John, attempting to come up with something to keep the two of them together – he had no other clients for the evening and he was enjoying flirting with this man.
John looked up at Mary and found her smirking into her cup of tea before she sat it down on the counter and spat out “
Thanks for reading, folks. See you next week <3
Sherlock sighed, placing his cup down on the saucer and turned to look Mrs. Hudson in the face. “Wonderful. Thank you for the tea, Mrs. Hudson. Perhaps you should go and finish up your cleaning or whatever you do when you’re not making tea.”
Turning, he spied Sherlock still standing on the steps of his house, phone to his ear as he looked down the road towards John. He couldn’t stop the smile from spreading across his face at the sight of Sherlock standing there. It was a glimmer of hope.
John jumped as his phone started vibrating in his pocket – Sherlock’s name was flashing up on the screen with a call. Hurriedly standing up from the table, John muttered something about taking a work call and moved outside onto the front step so he was out of earshot.
“Yeah,” John panted, looking up at Sherlock. “Thanks.”
He dashed from the train station, ignoring the looks from people he received as he shoved past them, feeling uneasy on his feet. All he needed was to get out of the building and away from the noise so he could collect air in his lungs once again.
John turned and trudged purposefully down Baker Street, not daring to look back at Mrs. Hudson for fear of her pitiful stare making him even more ashamed than he already was. When he finally reached the corner, he quickly glanced back at 221B and saw her moving back inside, shaking her head sadly.
“Sherlock!” John’s voice cracked through the silent street. The cold had sent everyone indoors to their homes, leaving him the only person on Baker Street. “Just talk to me!
” she crooned in his ear, arms around him gently but firmly. “
“It’s a beautiful range,” she prattled, holding up the mock invitation. “Simple, elegant, and I think you’ll agree the print along with the valley motif complement each other wonderfully.”
"Thanks, Harry. It's good," he said, taking in his appearance.
John slipped his hand in between Sherlock’s cheeks and began stroking at his perineum and soon Sherlock was jerking unintentionally from the sensation.
The auditorium was large: plush velvet seats spanning in front of him slowly filling with people; that led to the stage, which had a thick maroon curtain obscuring it. The lights were dim, just enough to illuminate the aisles so people could find their way to their seats. John allowed himself to let out a long sigh, attempting to settle his nerves.
“I’m doing this for you!” John huffed, becoming more and more irate as the minutes wore on. “I’m doing this so I don’t look like a complete plant pot at our wedding!”
John crawled up to straddle Sherlock, their cocks brushing against each other and Sherlock let out a moan, his body nearly vibrating with pleasure. Moving one hand in between them, John took Sherlock’s cock in his hand and began stroking, crooning at Sherlock in a low voice.
to her. And yet all he wanted to do was run away, into the arms of someone else.
“Not a fan of sharing clothes. Hurry or we’ll be late,” he said, promptly closing the door and leaving John standing perplexed by himself in the bathroom.
“I love it when you do that,” John spoke softly, his hand coming up to brush Sherlock’s pink cheek. “You look so
“Hungry?” John asked, turning on his side to look at him.
“Need some change?”
“Like this?”
“Come on inside out of the rain, quickly now.” She dashed out into the rain and placed a hand on his back which was wet through to his skin, leading him into the shelter of her home.
John shrugged, smiling at her as he took the envelope and wet the seal. “No, I’m okay. Just thinking about how real this is … it’s a little unnerving.” John answered – he was, for once, being truthful.
“Mmm?” she purred, low in her throat. “Is this helping?”
“Sorry,” Sherlock said, nervous. “I still haven’t managed to get around to unpacking …”
“Right,” Sherlock announced, spinning around to move into the middle of the room. “First step goes as follows.”
“I’m unsure of what choice of clothing to wear … perhaps my Hardy Amies suit. Yes, I think that will do. You need to help me decide what shoes to wear as well … oh, who am I kidding? I’ve seen your taste in shoes. No, I’ll have to decide myself. Perhaps while I’m in the meeting you could check in at the bed and breakfast I’ve booked … John?”
“Mmm?” Sherlock’s voice was groggy and a lazy smile played at his lips, his eyes were closed happily.
Mary’s grip was resolute and she pulled him into her arms, humming a tune as she began to sway with him, her arms around his neck. John put his hands on her waist, succumbing to her attempts. He followed her movements as she turned her head and laid it on his chest, her humming low and tuneless. He lowered his head, placing his nose in her hair – it smelled of coconut shampoo and perfume. The scent reminded him of the first night he had spent with Mary all those years ago – they were both drunk at the time and John wasn’t able to last due to the whiskey in his system, however Mary had stayed, saying she was enjoying herself regardless of whether he was able to perform or not. They had ended up in bed: legs tangled together, his arms around her, nose in her hair. He was happy. In those first moments, he wouldn’t have dreamed he would be in the situation he had put himself in now.
,” Sherlock breathed, his eyes focusing on John’s face and then squeezing shut. It was all so much at once, yet somehow he couldn’t get enough.
“What …” Sherlock was lost for words and he moved down a few steps to come level with John, snow beginning to dust his dark hair. “What are you doing here?”
And suddenly he was being directed to a bench, a firm hand on his back; he could hear the train leaving behind him. A plump older woman was guiding him to sit down and words were coming from her, but John couldn’t process them, he could only hear the sound of the train rolling over the tracks, carrying away the one person he loved most in the world.
“Wait, what are you doing in London?” John queried, confused.
“You okay?” Sherlock breathed, his hand coming to rest on John’s, holding it in place on his chest.
Sherlock silently sunk down, his mouth coming into contact with John’s torso, his tongue lapping up the taste of him. He moved down to his bellybutton and slowly kissing his way further south, and finally coming to his belt buckle. John’s head fell back, his eyes closing, because if he were to watch Sherlock doing this, he wouldn’t have been able to handle himself, nor be responsible for what he might have done next. He was excruciatingly attracted to Sherlock and his body was responding just as he thought he would. Heart racing, trousers feeling tight, sweat beginning to bead on his brow.
“Good,” Sherlock said, his eyes closed.
“Naturally,” Sherlock responded, smiling back at John before moving off to start the kettle.
The pair sat in silence, listening to the fire crackle pleasantly. Their eyes regarded each other seriously – something between them felt different, like there had been a shift in between the time of their confrontation at the wedding and now. The distance that had once separated them had now been crossed, allowing them to find each other again.
. He had isolated himself from his friends and family. His sister obviously wouldn’t welcome him into her home with open arms. And Sherlock? Well it was a whimsical fantasy that he would ever take John back. And if he told Mary, he would lose her too. He couldn’t do that – not right now.
to do or something instead of prying into my private life?” John was truly reaching the end of his tether with her and he stood, reaching over to the door to start shutting it.
“You okay?” John asked, frowning.
“Oh god,” John breathed into Sherlock’s mouth, desperate.
John was startled by Mrs. Hudson standing in the doorway, arms folded, scrutinising him from across the room. He sat up quickly, feeling guilty. But why should he feel guilty? It’s not like he was with Sherlock anymore – Sherlock knew about everything and they weren’t together anymore.
to be sorry for,” he spoke, more aggressive than he intended, but it was all he could do to avoid bursting into tears again. “I’m sorry for not coming to you sooner, Sherlock. You needed me and I refused to listen. I haven’t slept in days because all I can think about is . . .”
“Do you want to find somewhere to sit?” John suddenly asked. He knew Mary was going to be late and he wanted time to talk to Sherlock; to just spend time with him was everything he could have dreamed of.
"Isn't there some kind of rule where sisters don't get to be bossy and mean to their siblings on their wedding day?" John picked up a piece of toast and pointedly took a large bite out of it, before placing it back on the plate.
“N-nice to meet you,” John stammered, wondering at who this woman could be. Sherlock had never mentioned her before and she certainly wasn’t his mother. Either way, her kindly and relaxed nature made John immediately take a likening to her.
“I … I’m sorry,” John stuttered. “I shouldn’t have done that.”
John wasn’t sure whether the conversation was finished, but as he cleared up their plates, neither of the pair broached the subject again and Mary seemed content to let John head out for a drink at the pub with a friend. In reality, he wanted to have a drink by himself to subdue the thoughts that were flying through his head.
“Mm?” Sherlock was the same, warmth radiating through his chest. He kept hearing John’s words repeating over in his head:
John flushed at the compliment and suddenly he was very aware of how intimate this situation felt – green eyes drinking him in, soft hands holding each other tenderly, skin on skin, breathing so close to each other’s space he could almost taste Sherlock – and suddenly John felt …
John shook his head emphatically. “Nope … no. Not yet.”
. I’m so sorry, Sherlock. You must forgive me—“
“Uh, Mrs. Hudson?” John started.
John took a step forward, aching to hold him, and when Sherlock automatically recoiled away from him, his heart felt as though it were shattering into a million fragments and he was suddenly afraid wouldn’t be able to put them back together again.
John let a laugh grace his mouth; he knew exactly why Sherlock was mad at him.
Sherlock’s shaking hands fumbled at his belt, his nerves making him unsteady, so John helped him, unbuckling his pants so Sherlock could pull them down. They pooled around his feet and Sherlock sucked in a breath at the sight of John straining to be released from his cotton briefs, his erection obvious underneath the thin fabric. Unable to stop himself, Sherlock used his hands to cup John’s hard length, wanting him all at once, and John had to pull back, reminding himself to calm down a little.
“Oh don’t start,” John sat his plate down on the bench, deciding to forgo cleaning it so he could leave the kitchen, therefore leaving Mary to her rage. He knew it was a petty argument, but deep down it felt good to just yell for the sake of yelling.
John let out a small chuckle as he moved into the bathroom.
“Sherlock, if I achieve nothing in my life except for loving you … I know I will have done everything right. You’re my guiding light, love. I always come back to you,” John breathed. “I won’t leave.”
“I love you too,” Sherlock said and John’s felt as though his heart were filling with the weight of those words.
Sherlock moved gracefully with the music, his face showing depth and intense emotion that connected him with the movements. He looked tall and lithe as he moved his body with elegant movements. John didn’t expect to be quite so enraptured by him, but as he moved across the floor, stepping into simple, yet powerful movements, John felt his heart swelling, his breath coming out in short bursts as he realised every so often that he was holding it. Sherlock twisted himself through the music, eyes falling on John, and then on himself in the mirror behind him, making sure everything he was doing was just so. Sherlock made it look so easy, but John soon became anxious at the thought of learning the steps.
“The interview is at 9:30am at the studios, so if we catch the 7:30 train tomorrow morning, we should get there in enough time,” Sherlock continued.
“Keep your eyes closed,” John heard Sherlock murmur – his voice seemed close. “Now breathe and
“Okay,” Sherlock whispered, his voice now enticingly close to John’s ear. “I’m going to lead you now. Just feel the music, follow me, and remember to
Standing on the sidewalk, John was very aware of the fact that this very much felt like the end of a date moment: the moment where the couple awkwardly kiss, or one invites the other around to their apartment and a night of hot sex ensues. And when Sherlock hailed a cab down, he almost thought Sherlock was going to lean in for a kiss (and would he have said no if he had tried?). But instead, Sherlock simply opened the door for John, smiled and bid him a goodnight.
John heard the front door being unlocked and his heart jumped into his throat. He watched the door open slowly and for a moment, he believed Sherlock would step out over the threshold, however, when Mrs. Hudson stepped outside into the cold, pulling her dressing gown tighter around her thin body, John let out a ragged hollow laugh and paced away from her, his hands wiping away the tears on his face.
John settled down, shuffling his feet underneath him, a smile playing at his lips, and Sherlock took a remote out of his pocket that was connected to the stereo in the corner.
Harriet remained silent, smoothing out the back of his hair with light, stroking fingertips. He heard her sigh.
John nodded, laying on Sherlock’s chest comfortably for a moment before shuffling off back into bed to wait for him. It was 2am and John was basically already asleep by the time he fell into his pillow.
Sherlock nodded, regarding John with cool eyes. “A good excuse to start,” he responded. “You really did pick it up naturally. Freeform dancing is one of my favourite methods of teaching – allowing someone to learn to
“Wait, you’re cheating on Mary with a
John thought back to the moment all those weeks ago when Sherlock had removed John’s shoes and he had done the same, right before he had taught him the steps to their dance. He remembered his body
“Is that why you’re not in Sussex?” Mrs. Hudson was quiet, watching John attempt to think of a response. Her lips were pursed and she had her thin eyebrows raised, waiting expectantly.
“D’you, uh, d’you mind if I—“ John dropped his hands from Sherlock and awkwardly took a step backwards, clearing his throat. Sherlock’s heart dropped as his touch disappeared and he knew that John was going to try and excuse himself from the situation again. “D’you mind if I go clean myself up a bit? Wash my face? I just don’t think going out for cake with my face looking like this would be very ideal.”
He thought about what he had said to Sherlock last night – about the fact that he loved him and he considered him home. Did he ever feel this way about Mary? He couldn’t remember. When had he ever felt as if his heart were going to explode from being filled with so much love for her? When had he felt as though she were his oxygen, his reason for getting up in the morning? When had he ever felt as though
John knew she was saying that in jest, but it only made him more willing to keep his secret even more.
“Well, I always have been,” John rubbed the back of his neck, moving over to where Sherlock was by the piano. “I’ve never been able to do …
and Sherlock responded with a shrug, rolling his eyes.
He collapsed onto him, his face in Sherlock’s neck. Both men were still breathing heavily, John staying inside of Sherlock, his cock twitching slightly. His head was fuzzy and he couldn’t form coherent sentences except for expletives.
By the end of their lesson, John was desperate to kiss him, but he held himself back, repeating to himself that he was
Mary leaned in towards John, a small smile on her face. “I can’t wait to be Mrs. Watson,” she murmured, placing one hand on his cheek.
Sleep deprivation has resulted in me being very apprehensive about this. However, it is here nonetheless.
“Too much whiskey,” John whispered, as Mary looked up at him with a pout. “Sorry, love.”
“I’m sorry, Sherlock,” he choked out, his voice muffled into Sherlock’s chest. He was holding desperately onto Sherlock like he was oxygen.
that.
“I still love her!” John protested.
The following Monday, John had finished work quickly, rushing to get to his lesson with Sherlock at 4:30. He arrived at the studio on time, however when he walked up to the door he was suddenly overcome with an intense feeling of trepidation. His hand hovered over the door handle, his mind sullied by thoughts of
John crawled up to join Sherlock in bed, who was laying with his hand over his eyes, his breath still coming in hard bursts.
, he thought defiantly. He almost wished, deep in the well of his mind, that someone he knew was there to see the pair, so they would run back and tell Mary and everything would finally be out in the open, come what may.
“No, stay. I want you to sit here,” he said.
“Where’s your bedroom?” John pulled away.
John jumped up, his head spinning from the alcohol and the sudden change in position, and dashed over to it, hoping against hope that it would be Sherlock’s name flashing up on the screen. Instead, it was Mary’s. John watched her name flashing, holding his phone in his hand, before silencing it and stashing it in his pocket.
“I actually need to pop upstairs and grab something. That’s why I came here.”
Once both of their feet were shoe-less, Sherlock rose from where he was sitting and held out a hand to John, helping him up. They ended up face to face, inches from each other. Sherlock’s hand stayed on John’s as they looked at each other; John’s eyes watching Sherlock’s lips as his tongue flicked out, wetting them slightly.
John hung up the phone and idly let it slip from his fingers onto the bed in front of him. He closed his eyes and used his fingers to pinch the bridge of his nose, exhaling loudly.
“It’s amazing. Who is it?” John asked.
He wasn’t really sure what he was expecting – all he really wanted was to see Sherlock so he knew he was okay. It had been a few months since their interaction at the wedding and since then, after John and Mary had split up, he hadn’t tried to contact Sherlock, deciding time alone would benefit not only himself, but Sherlock as well. And now he felt as though a weight had lifted off his chest and he was free to breathe again and although some nights were still hard, with the dark thoughts creeping their way into his dreams, those nights came less often. All he needed was to see that Sherlock was in a better place now; he wanted him to be happy, even if it was without John.
“You don’t understand, Harriet,” John said, his hands wrapping around the amber liquid in his glass. “You’ve never experienced heartbreak so you wouldn’t know.”
Sherlock grabbed the door handle and began shutting John in the bathroom.
“Please Sherlock … can we talk about this? I-I … don’t want to leave you.” John was now crying, allowing his tears to fall freely; he didn’t bother wiping them away.
John watched as Sherlock focused intently on his trousers, smoothing the fabric out, a frown knitting across his brow. It was only when the small crease on the bridge of Sherlock’s nose appeared as he looked up at John, his curls swaying delicately in the cool breeze into his eyes that John couldn’t help himself and he reached out and brushed the soft hair away from Sherlock’s eyes. The motion was so tender and Sherlock seemed to crumble underneath his feather light touch.
Let me know what you guys thought and whether you enjoyed it or not!
Just as he was moving off to sit back on the couch, Mrs. Hudson came to the open door, knocking with one hand, her other laden with a tray of tea. She sat the tray down on the coffee table in front of where Sherlock was sitting, and stood watching John who moved to sit next to Sherlock on the sofa. She was smiling kindly at the pair.
“Hello?”
“No, no, of course not,” John turned to face Sherlock, placing his hand on his cheek; his lips were still wet and John had to stop himself from leaning in again to taste them once more. “You’re perfect … it’s just …”
Sherlock could hear the water running in the bathroom as John splashed it over his face. Padding silently down the hall in bare feet, Sherlock stopped at the doorway and leaned against the frame, watching John bend over the sink as he washed the salt from his tears away from his face. He straightened up and looked into the mirror, his eyes falling on Sherlock. John looked exhausted; his eyes were dark and deeply pained, and the lines on his face seemed deeper and more pronounced.
“Okay,” John said, still unsure what to make of the situation. “You sure?”
“What did I do?” John asked stupidly, matching her stride.
, John’s brain seemed to be screaming. Instead, John pulled his hand from Sherlock’s and he cleared his throat, breaking the tension. Sherlock took a step back, suddenly realising how close in proximity he was to John and feeling slightly nervous.
“Tell everyone to go home,” John said. “The wedding’s off. It’s finished.”
“You know,” Sherlock was turning the invitation in his hands, his eyes roving over John and Mary’s names, memorising every detail, “when I found this in your jacket last night, I thought I
“I don’t think I’ll ever get used to that,” Sherlock spoke quietly, his eyes watching the barista behind the counter rush to prepare orders.
John then began the same motion, pulling off his own jacket and shirt, and discarding them carelessly on the floor beside him. He took a moment, watching Sherlock face as his eyes roved over his chest, noting all the perfectly imperfect things about John: all the scars and blemishes and the way his muscles moved underneath his slightly tanned skin. Sherlock drew in a breath, astonished at the fact that John Watson was finally in his bedroom, getting undressed in front of him.
John turned and Sherlock was in front of him again, hastily pulling on a black, double breasted Belstaff coat – it made him look even taller than he already was. He was carrying his leather messenger bag which had papers stuffed into it, hanging out of the top slightly.
Pulling into the small church, John spied the familiar faces of his friends and colleagues and he felt his stomach twisting again. Ignoring the feeling that he wanted to run as far as he could, he emerged from the car and made his way through the entrance into the chapel, smiling at his friends along the way.
meet with the photographer – we were meant to do that next week! Can they not just send someone else?” Mary was harried, suddenly into cleaning mode as she cleared the table of stationary and piled up the stacks of invitations, the stress evident on her face.
Berating himself for not figuring out where he was supposed to go, John decided to follow the small groups of people, all obviously here to watch the Christmas show as well.
“Probably not,” she answered immediately, but upon noticing John’s despondent reaction, she continued. “Unless I really loved the person. Do you think he really loves you?”
“You really don’t deserve me.” Mary spat, and for a second, John glimpsed tears welling in her eyes, before she blinked and they were gone. “I’m going to leave now.
“John,” Sherlock moaned his name again. “I … I need you …”
John turned to Sherlock and pulled his body into his, hands on his waist. He was now suddenly apprehensive at the thought of seeing Sherlock unclothed, naked and waiting for him. He had thought about this moment for weeks, imagining how Sherlock would look as he lay down on the bed, his curls falling softly around his green eyes. He knew there was no going back from this.
After their interaction at John’s wedding, he had avoided talking to anyone, including Sherlock. He didn’t want to hurt him anymore than he already had and he thought by allowing him to move to Sussex without interference from John, that would mean he was allowing him to move on. He thought it would mean he was allowing
John laughed. “Enough about the shoes already! Yes, you can take me shoe shopping. I’ll text you in the morning, yeah?”
John opened his mouth to apologise, but was cut short as Mary stormed off, getting into their car and slamming the door dramatically. She sat in silence, waiting for John to get into the driver’s seat. When he started the car, she crossed her arms, pursing her lips as she stared angrily out the window.
For a moment, Sherlock didn’t respond. He simply withdrew his hand from the cupboard, pulling a cup with him and walked to the sink to fill it with water.
were the snowflakes. He was beginning to understand the story being told and was actually enjoying himself.
John clicked send and quickly put his phone back in his pocket, looking up to find a cab passing by. He just
“I think it’s time for a nap, yeah?” she said.
"Uh, Charlotte, I'm going to have to leave you for a moment. I've just seen someone I need to say hello to." John left Charlotte mid-sentence and began making his way over to Sherlock, his heart pounding in his chest.
“Do you …” John was licking Sherlock’s left ear, tasting the salty sweat that was now wetting his skin. “Do you have lube?”
John waved his hand distractedly as he watched the blond lean forward, placing his hand on Sherlock’s arm, kissing him softly on his cheek. He scowled at the sight and was thankful that Sherlock moved up the steps to his front door alone while Lucas went back to his car and drove away.
“I’d like one ticket,” John said, feeling uncomfortable and cold.
done. John felt incredibly stupid, standing in the middle of the room with Sherlock scrutinising him with his penetrating gaze. How was he supposed to ignore everything in the room with that man basically
“Right. I’d best finish up here. Meet you outside?” John urgently wanted Sherlock to leave so he could finish up posting the invitations without him seeing what they were and his best bet was to ask Sherlock to wait elsewhere.
The man twisted John around to face him, still grasping firmly onto his shoulders, before he began to shake him violently, back and forth and side to side.
“I love you,” Sherlock spoke quietly, unable to stop himself.
“Sunday. We can stay overnight at a bed and breakfast.” Sherlock’s reply was breathless and John had an inkling that he might have literally jumped for joy.
The snake and the forbidden fruit.
“No … I’m not okay,” it was the only sliver of truth John felt like he had said in a few weeks and it tasted bitter on his tongue. When had he become such a fraud that telling the truth had begun to feel foreign to him?
Sherlock was holding back tears, that familiar crease on his nose making it even more difficult for John to leave. He stood so the pair were face to face and John heard Sherlock’s breath escaping him raggedly.
. John had to touch himself. He had to. He felt like he was going to faint from the pressure building in his cock.
Sherlock’s emerald eyes collided with John’s and he saw they were brimming with tears, his true emotions finally making it to the surface; he took one last look at the card in his hand and then his face creased into something resembling pained disgust. He tucked the invitation back into his pocket, not able to stomach looking at it anymore.
He wasn’t sure what to expect coming to watch Sherlock dance at this show, but as John took in the vast brick and mortar school with its endless windows, intricately designed, and the huge sprawling gardens, he began to feel out of his depth, like he didn’t belong here.
John leaned over, removing the lubricant and hastily pouring some out onto his hand. He quickly rubbed it all over his cock, moaning at the sensation, before applying it to Sherlock – smoothing his hand over his penis and through to his asshole. Sherlock squirmed underneath him, his keening moan increasing at the sensation.
, but he knew deep down he wanted to. He knew deep down, if (or when) the opportunity presented itself, he would take it straight away; he would be greedy and desperate in his need – which is where the majority of his guilt came from. It had been so long since he had been with a man that he had nearly forgotten what it felt like. He had memories from years ago with his first love – sometimes when he was with Mary he would fantasize about those times, closing his eyes and imagining someone else underneath him. James Sholto was his first and last and he was a memory in the wind – he would catch glimpses of him every now and then in small things like a scent or a certain phrase and sometimes in his dreams he would remember his lips and his hard fingers. But the rest was hazy and faded and left to rot in the abscess of his mind where John left his most painful memories.
with those feelings.” Sherlock said, very seriously, before he turned the music up louder.
“You here with your wife?” the woman croaked, her green eyes twinkling at John.
“Excuse me?” John didn’t know whether to laugh or cry – of course it would turn out exactly the way he expected: obviously this man was a bit of an arrogant dickhead and he was going to be told to leave the first chance Sherlock got.
“I was
“Six quid,” the cabbie said, eyeing them from the rear view mirror again.
John looked over at Joanne, then Mary; both were watching him with expressions of confusion and annoyance, waiting expectantly for him to answer.
John went to turn away from Sherlock to run inside back to his wedding, but Sherlock reached out and grabbed his arm, forcing him to look into Sherlock’s face; his eyes were pleading.
If you have any questions about anything regarding this fic, feel free to comment and I will answer as soon as possible.
“I’m fine. Trust me,” Sherlock answered, filling his cup, “just needed some water.”
Marlene paused for a moment, eyeing John with a small smile on her lips. “I’ve got a form for you to sign,” she said, handing him the paper. “What’s going on with you? You look like someone’s
,” John whispered, his eyes meeting Sherlock’s again.
And as the music echoed across the studio with a final haunting note, Sherlock opened his eyes to watch John coolly, speaking out across the room to him.
“D68.” John’s voice was grave.
“I should, uh, go.” John finally muttered. Still, he didn’t move from where he was.
“Well I’m starving, then.” John finally said.
There was silence for a beat, before John realised he could hear someone moving in the kitchen. Rising from his bed, John slipped out of the blankets and padded down the hall silently, towards the source of light from the kitchen.
. I don’t want to not be a part of your life. I want to experience every shade of blue and every heartbeat … every
At work the next day, John couldn’t stop thinking about all the moments held between Sherlock and himself. The thick tension in the air as Sherlock held onto John and moved in and out of his space. Sherlock was electric and John couldn’t stop himself from feeling the delicious shock to his core when Sherlock’s fingers brushed his bare skin. John was lost in thought after a client had just left when he heard a knock on his door. Marlene, his receptionist, popped her head around the door.
who would be waiting at home for him. And could he really face her if he had just come home after kissing someone else? He wasn’t so sure.
“What, so you’re just going to keep this from her then? You’re just going to marry her and never tell her about your affair or the fact that you’re in love with someone else?”
The way Sherlock was looking so utterly soft and lost, John couldn’t stop himself. He leaned forward and placed the most delicate kiss on Sherlock’s lips, his hand coming up to caress his cheek and then he moved it down to hold onto the back of Sherlock’s neck, his fingers interlacing into the soft tufts of hair at the nape of his neck. Sherlock sighed into him habitually, his body settling back into its fit with John’s, as if it had never left.
Sherlock peered at John from under his hand, before smiling at him.
“Oh, well … do make sure you dry off while you’re up there. You don’t want to catch a cold. There’s a nasty one floating around.”
“It’s … f-fine,” Sherlock gasped, a small smile on his lips.
approach nowadays,” Sherlock jested with a small smile and John’s heart sung at the sight.
He was finding it easier to stay quiet when he woke from these nightmares, but on one occasion Mary had woken to his sobs, automatically wrapping her arms around him from behind, holding him tight. One hand snaked under his arm and came to rest above his heart, pulling him tight into her warm body.
." she admonished, frowning.
“W-well yes, why not?” John was suddenly defensive.
“Hey!” Mary’s voice sounded light and elated at finally hearing John pick up. “How’s it going?”
with Sherlock and now he wasn’t. He was reminded of what he had lost and the memory of it felt like sand slipping through his fingers.
“I can’t.”
Both Angelo and Sherlock didn’t seem to hear him as Sherlock had taken John’s menu already and was placing an order for them: eggplant parmigiana and a mushroom risotto. He also ordered a sparkling water for himself and, when John was prompted, a red wine. Angelo moved off to place the order, leaving John and Sherlock alone together, regarding each other across the table.
“John …” Sherlock sighed out John’s name, his azure eyes opening again to hold steady onto John’s, mapping out his features like he were seeing him for the first time.
,” Sherlock breathed.
John rolled his eyes at the petulant girl, reaching into his pocket and feeling around for the loose change he had stashed away. Finding his pocket empty, he resigned himself to using his card.
“Right,” John nodded.
“Hey,” John looked up at Sherlock who continued watching cars pass by. “You okay? I hope you’re not still thinking about that nightmare last night.” John could have sworn he saw one corner of Sherlock’s lips twitch into a smile that lasted a micro second.
“Yes, that’s right,” John answered, “would you like a seat, Mrs. Hudson?” He made to move so the woman could sit, ignoring the audible sigh from Sherlock, but Mrs. Hudson shook her head.
“John,” Harriet said with a dubious stare, “it’s nine in the morning. Don’t you think it’s a little early for the hard liquor?”
He moved forward, crossing the room in three large strides and pulled Sherlock into him roughly, one hand behind his head and the other on the small of his back, kissing him like he were starving and Sherlock was the only meal he had had in days.
Let me know what you guys think <3
before soft notes of piano began playing out of the speakers, reverberating through the room and in turn, through John as he stood in silence, awaiting Sherlock’s next move.
“Yes,” Sherlock smoothed his shirt down, clearing his throat, “well then.”

“I will be,” Sherlock responded, eyes watching John guardedly.
John was led to a quaint bungalow in a suburban location in West Sussex and as Sherlock’s car pulled onto the side of the street, John indicated the cabbie could pull over a small way ahead so they wouldn’t notice him watching the pair from the car. John twisted in the backseat to watch as the blond man jumped out of the car and opened Sherlock’s door for him. Sherlock stepped out and said something to the Lucas, who laughed in response.
beautiful – his eyes were closed with his eyelashes splayed out and his lips were left open in a perpetual sigh, shaking slightly. John had never felt more in love than in this moment and he knew, after lying awake pretending to be asleep and feeling Sherlock caressing his face and hands that now was a better time than ever.
“Yes, yes, John is handsome. I’m quite aware,” Sherlock snapped impatiently. “Now if you’ll excuse us –“ Sherlock took John’s hand and started to lead him upstairs.
“John Watson,” she murmured into his mouth. “Your dancing skills have improved.”
?!” Mary’s face was a mix of shock and amusement, and her incredulous tone did nothing to quell the ever growing shade of crimson that was now covering his cheeks and neck.
“I do! I mean … I don’t know,” John leaned onto the countertop and rested his forehead in his hands. “I have honestly fucked everything up, Harry.”
“Okay, well … I love you.” Mary said softly.
John seemed to only hear the words as they came out of his mouth and he was almost shocked at the fact that he had said them himself. But of course they were true. Sherlock
“You okay, love? Looking a bit peaky,” Mary said, carefully writing down the address for John’s sister on an envelope.
and his skin felt like it was crawling and the old lady was rubbing her hand on his back and it felt like razor blades and he needed to
Sherlock’s home was small and messy, boxes still piled up in his living, not yet unpacked from his move. There was no furniture in the living room, except for a rug in front of the unlit fireplace and single wooden dining chair positioned next to it.

Again, please remember to let me know if you liked it (or even if you didn't like it (but please be kind)).
! You were having an affair, John!”
Thank you for reading
“Oh, yeah. Fair enough,” he replied, awkwardly removing his arm. “Maybe I can watch you dance again some other time?”
John was staring out the window of the shop watching people pass by, thinking about the text he had just received from Sherlock confirming their lesson on Monday evening; they had decided instead of seeing each other every seven days, they would now be having lessons every three days – what they would achieve in the multiple times he would be seeing him over the next few weeks John was not certain, but he wasn’t complaining. He was nervous, but also incredibly eager to see Sherlock and be close to him again. John allowed his mind to wander to thoughts of what could possibly occur next time he was with Sherlock – would they end up kissing at the end of the lesson? Would they dance together, closer than they had been before? Would Sherlock pull John back when they broke apart, his lips crashing into his, hard and rough? Or would he be gentle and shy, allowing John to take the lead, pushing his tongue into his mouth with fervour? He imagined Sherlock’s hand pulling at the soft hairs at the nape of John’s neck, tugging them slightly, him sighing into John’s body as they held each other close, their bodies desperate for each other.
It sounded childish and silly to John, but all of a sudden, Sherlock’s emerald eyes were colliding with John’s and a wry smile played on his lips, before he uttered out a small: “
He stumbled over the threshold of his small home and saw Mary’s bag sitting on the couch, meaning she had just arrived home minutes prior to him. He heard her moving around in the kitchen and when he walked to where she was, she turned and spotted him, smiling brightly.
Sherlock was tall, John noted, and he had an intensity about him that made John curious to talk to him to try and unravel the mystery he seemed to hold. He had dark hair which was slicked back across his head stylishly, and a jawline that would rival George Clooney. He was wearing a fitted light blue collared shirt that was rolled up at the sleeves, tucked into a pair of tailored slacks, all of which was finished off with some dark, pinstripe braces. He was stylish and tall and handsome and everything John felt that he wasn’t.
“No,” John said, embarrassed.
“Bad enough that they need me, apparently. Overnight.”
John allowed himself a sad smile at the thought of Sherlock dancing happily after seeing John, but it was soon replaced with intense regret. Mrs. Hudson wouldn’t be hearing him dancing alone anymore, he mused.
to touch it – he would go crazy if he couldn’t.
“No. Never. Just you …” John said, swaying in time with the music. “It will always be just you, Sherlock Holmes.”
“Sorry,” she mumbled with an awkward laugh, rushing into the kitchen and hurriedly clearing away the mess. “I didn’t really expect visitors, you know.”
After cleaning up the rest of the kitchen and finishing the emails on his computer, John finally got around to setting up the couch to sleep, shattered. He settled himself down into the blanket and closed his eyes, only to be woken up by his phone vibrating.
“Ah, well, I understand. It was probably a bit forward of me to assume you had the time anyway—“
John hated Harriet right at this moment. He hated her because he knew she was telling the truth and now that it was coming out of her mouth, with her deadpan blue eyes glaring into his, he was ashamed of himself.
Sherlock’s eyes met John’s and he was afraid Sherlock was about to start crying. His soft lips parted for him to respond, before he sighed and let out an awkward chuckle.
“Hi,” Sherlock’s deep voice rung out and John’s heart swelled at the sound. “How are you?”

. John’s inner voice was telling him, but he couldn’t. He had wanted this for weeks. He had been holding back for weeks. He had been putting up with this need, attempting to ignore it, for
John allowed his eyes to rove over the sea of people sitting in front of him, thinking about who Sherlock was to John. His friend? His boyfriend? An acquaintance? None of those options seemed to fit.
Sherlock pulled John against him tighter, smiling sleepily against his skin. He yawned, his fingers sleepily tracing down John’s back to settle on his bum.
John knew it was getting late. He had avoided looking at his phone, knowing he would have to tell Mary some excuse as to why he wasn’t going to be home that night. That could come later. Right now, he was starving and needed some food.
Moving back down into the hall, Sherlock’s bedroom door was shut and when John placed his hand on the door handle and opened up his now messy bedroom, John had a virulent flashback of them lying in bed together, tangled amongst sheets and limbs, smiles coming so easy. He spotted a small, old fashioned cassette player on Sherlock’s dresser and John pushed play, wanting some kind of noise to stop his thoughts from overwhelming him.
Mary raised her head and kissed John, her hands moving up into his hair. He closed his eyes and kissed her back, desperately searching for the spark he had once felt. She moved her hands to his belt buckle and began to undo his trousers, a giggle escaping her lips.
“Mm, perhaps,” Sherlock replied.
John nodded and handed over his cash to the woman. He took his programme from her and threw her a distracted word of thanks, his eyes moving onto the crowd around him, noticing the multiple performers mingling in the throng before the show started. John immediately felt anxiety bubble in his chest – he was worried Sherlock would also be out in the crowd before he went on stage. He hadn’t expected dancers to be out before the show, but then again, he had never been to a show like this, so he didn’t really know what he was expecting in the first place. All he knew was he didn’t want to bump into Sherlock right now and have him find out he was here – his plan was to slip in, watch Sherlock, and leave.
John flashed Sherlock a frown that said
“So you want to learn to dance?” Sherlock asked, turning on his heel and quickly moving across to the middle of the studio.
When Sherlock disappeared inside of the train, John felt his legs moving to rush up beside it and he peered through the windows to try and catch a glimpse of Sherlock one last time. He finally spotted him, walking through the aisle in an attempt to find a row of seats to himself. His coat collar was up, shielding his face from other passengers, but John could see the palpable pain etched on his face. He loved Sherlock with every inch of his soul and he hated himself for doing this to him. He hated himself for being so damn stupid. He hated himself because he knew he would never get him back.
"I was just thinking … don't you think there's a reason you cheated in the first place?" she asked thoughtfully. "What if that reason is because you shouldn't be doing this? I ... I love you too much to see you make the same mistake mum and dad did."
,” Harriet turned and regarded him seriously. “You are getting married. You can’t continue this way. Mary deserves to know.”
“I do, though.” John breathed, sighing into his body. “I need you to know this. You make me … very happy.”
“Mrs. Hudson,” John attempted to sound normal, moving forward and taking the bags from her hands. “Here, let me help you with that.”
Sherlock untwisted himself, standing, and instead of moving
“Since I first started getting dancing lessons with him,” John said honestly and regretfully.
“You’re a cruel man, John Watson.”
John blinked up at her. Did she really think this was fixable?
about it all.
As the night wore on, John continued with his whiskey, soon becoming quite drunk. He sat on the couch next to Mary, the television becoming more blurred with each sip he took. She had bought a bottle of wine and was down to her last glass, which had made her slightly tipsy as well. She was sitting next to John, her toes tucked underneath his butt for warmth, attempting to pay attention to whatever they were watching, but ending up with her eyes on him, her thoughts roaming.
Rolling his eyes, John walked out of the kitchen into the living room and sat down at his laptop which was sitting left open on the table with an article on hyperbilirubinemia in infants. He sat down to it and attempted to ignore Mary by involving himself in the words on the screen in front of him.
He knew this would happen eventually, but seeing it in writing suddenly made it feel more final than ever. He felt like once Sherlock left London, he was officially leaving his past with John behind and moving onto bigger and better things. He wanted to be happy for him, and a part of him was, but he couldn’t stop the feeling jealousy that he could just leave so easily. Of course there was nothing tying him to London anymore, not now that John was moving on too.
that he proceeded. “Can we go back to yours?” John’s voice was a low murmur, sending an expectant shiver down Sherlock’s spine. He knew what that meant.
(See the end of the chapter for
. You may open your eyes when you are ready.”
As a cab that Sherlock had hailed halted in front of the pair, John ducked his head to step inside. He felt Sherlock’s warm hand on the small of his back as he guided him into the car. And as guilty as he was feeling about the situation, John wanted him to keep his firm touch on his bones. With a start he realised he wanted more.
“Is that one of yours?”
He was jarred out of his reverie by his phone vibrating once again and, groaning inwardly, he finally decided to bite the bullet and answer Mary’s call.
Clearing his throat, he attempted a grimace that resembled stress as he moved into the house and back to where Mary was finishing up on the last few envelopes.
“Thank you,” she handed over the bags and gestured to the rubbish bin for him to store them in. “What are you doing here? I thought you and Sherlock were supposed to be in Sussex.”
Suddenly the music came to life, the delicious melody filling the theatre, along with the stage being lit up by hundreds of fairy lights, twinkling on the walls and the curtains and even dangling from the ceiling. Sherlock lifted his head and sucked in, audible enough so that John could even hear him from the back seats. He lifted up on his toes and pushed forward, letting go of his raised foot so he could twist into motion, his eyes half shut with feeling. Sherlock’s pale form looked stark against the black background, but with the countless dazzling lights behind him, he looked like he was dancing in a galaxy of stars, painting the sky with his fluid movement.
“I …” John couldn’t tell him. He just couldn’t. He wanted to shout and scream and tell him he was engaged to someone who he wasn’t sure he even loved and he didn’t know what to do about it. He wanted to tell him that he wanted to be with him instead of his current girlfriend, but instead he let another lie escape his lips. “I just don’t want our first time to be like …
shoes.”
“Oh stop playing with your food, John! You’re a bloody child!” Mary suddenly burst out, slamming her fork down on the table.
Harriet moved to the bed and sat on the edge, before laying herself back and staring up at the roof, thoughtful. She made enough room for John, so he joined her, lying back so they were side by side. They used to lie like this in John’s bedroom when they were kids, usually making up songs or stories together to cover up the sound of an argument between their parents in the room next door.
“Are … are you okay?” John finally said.
“Even Sussex.” John reassured him, squeezing his hand one last time.
“Sherlock?” John whispered, slurring with sleep on his tongue.
“No, no. It’s fine,” she answered, relaxed as usual. “Just make sure you bring me back something nice from Sussex, okay?”
“You.”
“Do you say that to all the boys?” Sherlock said.
into the music.”
“No,” Sherlock answered, using two of his fingers to pinch the bridge of his nose. “Something is very wrong, John.”
“Yeah, I’ll manage.”
“You are probably one of the most beautiful people I’ve laid eyes on.”
that way. Truth be told, he felt like an alien in his own skin. He knew he hadn’t cheated on Mary physically, but he had still lied to her and that in itself was eating him up. He had never lied to his partners before – honesty was something he cherished. And yet …
“Look who’s being childish now!” John snapped back, following her and taking his plate with him.
(See the end of the chapter for
John awkwardly moved out of the kitchen to the staircase and placed his hand on the banister, his eyes watching the top of the stairs, almost afraid to move up there for fear of him not being able to connect with any of Sherlock’s things. When his legs finally started moving, he felt his stomach filling with apprehension.
“Do you have any idea how to make a bed, Sherlock?” John asked once Sherlock started to get incredibly frustrated.
Mary nodded enthusiastically, holding up the previous invitation sample against the one Joanne was holding. “Oh, it’s just
Turning, John saw Mary's maid of honor making her way towards him in her pastel pink bridesmaid dress, her face breaking into a bright smile. She hugged him tightly, placing a kiss on his cheek.
“Who was that?” her voice was low, deathly calm.
The elevator door pinged open and he entered the unoccupied compartment, his feet moving over the carpet with a whisper. When the doors closed, he found himself face to face with his own reflection in the mirrored door. He looked wild; fists clenched, hair skewed, cheeks flushed, and red eyes. All he wanted to do was smash his fist into the reflection, to rid himself of the memory of him being so damn angry, because he knew he had no right to be.
to what it is telling you and your body. And then
“What?” Sherlock whispered. His eyes were heavy-lidded and impious and they wandered over John’s features hungrily.
“No, it’s fine, love.” She answered, yawning. “Oh god, John, you smell like a wine cellar.”
Sherlock’s eyes were dark as they stared into John’s, unreadable as he processed what he had just said. He looked as though he were contemplating a million different responses before settling on something.
"Yeah, you could say that," John answered with an awkward chuckle. "Is she here yet?"
“Right hand side, top drawer,” Sherlock said quickly, his chest heaving.
John smiled at the sight of Sherlock lighting up over his passion – all angular arms as he moved his hands around, showing as well as telling John about music and dance and emotion intertwined. John admired the way Sherlock allowed the words to fall from his mouth, including praise. So many times he had to wrench honesty from the lips of those around him, it became exhausting. But with Sherlock, everything was so forthcoming and truthful and raw – he could have listened to him speak all day.
John accepted the strawberries, putting them on his desk with a quick thank you. The two were still standing awkwardly in his office, neither of them feeling very comfortable at all. Sherlock could feel the awkwardness radiating from John as he stood across from him.
John let up, allowing Mary to straighten herself so she was sitting cradled in his lap, arms looped around his neck – both were smiling benignly at each other, all thoughts of their near-fight gone.
John gestured vaguely at the post office. “Had to run some errands.”
John knew at that moment that what she was saying was true. He needed to be sure and he needed live in the present which meant leaving behind Sherlock and embracing his relationship with Mary again. John had once told Sherlock he would follow him anywhere, but he understood now that by doing that, he would be burning down the home he had built with Mary. And yes, she deserved better than that.
John couldn’t help but let a burst of laughter bubble from his chest as Sherlock’s frown deepened, the cute crease returning to his nose. He looked down at his shoes before returning to look up at Sherlock who looked affronted.
“Yes,” Sherlock’s hand curled into John’s blonde hair. “Keep going like that.”
“It’s done,” he said bitterly. “She found out about everything.”
John and Mary were sitting inside a small boutique shop that specialised in wedding stationery. The stout woman sitting across from the pair was babbling on about the benefits of what she called her “Lily of the Valley Range”. John didn’t really understand what she was so excited about considering the range she was showing the two looked exactly the same as the previous range she had presented to them, only with lace trimming.
He seemed to be talking to himself more than anything, battling with his inner voice, trying to rationalise an irrational situation. He was clenching and unclenching his hands again, his legs moving automatically underneath him.
to look at; he wanted to kiss every inch of him. He used his fingers to trace over his stomach, moving to his nipples which were raised slightly at the sudden change in temperature, and down to the waistline of his trousers.
John stood and turned to look at his sister as she began picking up the hair products on the seat next to her. Standing, she brushed past John, avoiding his eye contact, and made her way to his bathroom to store the products away. Following, John examined himself in the mirror.
Sherlock chucked, low and heavy. “John, I don’t care where we do this, just as long as it’s with you. Do you have any idea how long I’ve been waiting for this moment? Please stay.”
Stopping outside he was overwhelmed by the urge to cry again and when he looked up at Sherlock’s window, he allowed the feeling to take over, tears mingling with the rain on his face. He knew Sherlock wasn’t inside, but he felt like if he were to go running up there, he would find him waiting, willing to forgive him. He wanted to go upstairs and find him sitting naked, cross-legged on his bed, curry sauce adorning his top lip, a wry smile across his beautiful face. His chest ached with the pain of his need to hold him, or to be held by him.
“M’not laughing,” John said, his hand coming up to cover the grin on his lips.
Sherlock’s hand moved up to reach for John’s as his eyes closed once more and his voice trailed out over his lips like a ghost: “Hold my hand, I am falling asleep.”
Standing in the post office, he handed over the stack of wedding invitations and money to the teenage assistant at the till, feeling as if he was sealing his fate in doing so.
“Yeah, uh—“ John didn’t know where to start. “I’m a bit shit, to be honest.” He answered truthfully.
. Grow up a bit, John.” Her voice was hard. She was repeating her usual trope of ‘drawing a line’. “Enough is enough. You got yourself into this, so you’ve got to get yourself out. There’s no point in you moping around like a bloody sissy.”
John pulled away and turned to throw her an incredulous look, staring Harry in the face. “What kind of bloody thing is that to say?”
John allowed his jacket to be pulled from him, feeling too overwhelmed to do anything else. He felt out of place in his usual cardigan/shirt/jeans combo next to Posh Boy Sherlock Holmes, but soon forgot when he felt Sherlock’s hands on his shoulders from behind him.
“So did you,” Sherlock answered. His bottom lip quivered slightly as he took in John’s wild face and when he spoke, there were unshed tears sparkling in his eyes. “Go home, John.”
He crouched out of sight, peeking through a car window to watch the pair as they made their way past. Sherlock was wearing plain black trousers with a black sweater pulled on underneath his Belstaff coat, which was draped across his shoulders.
Mary sighed again, a frown gracing her forehead. “I know when you’re fibbing, John. I’ve seen you these past few weeks and something’s going on. Be honest.” Mary paused for a beat. “Are you … are you having second thoughts? About us?”
"I told you that you wouldn't like it!" she said defensively. Her expression was bashful and she almost looked guilty.  "Turn around, I need to fix the back a little."
When the bullet had entered Sherlock’s chest, John couldn’t quite believe it. It was as though he were watching the moment play out in slow motion as Sherlock went entirely pale and collapsed to the ground, blood rapidly spilling out to wet his shirt with angry crimson fingers.
“Don’t laugh, John,” Sherlock said in mock indignation, his hand coming up to half-heartedly cover his wet locks.
“Um …” John, for the life of him, had no idea what he was on about.
“Sherlock,” John placed his tea on the floor and reached out to grasp onto Sherlock’s hand; it was trembling slightly, and not from the cold. “I know it won’t mean much anymore and I know it might be past the point now, but … I promise I will never lie to you ever again. If I could go back and do things differently, I would in a heartbeat. I will
“You don’t think I tried that? You don’t think I tried to contact you? You left, John. You left us. You left
“Never experienced – you’re saying I’ve never experienced heartbreak?” her cheeks were rising in colour as she spoke. “How about the heartbreak of being exiled from our family, John? How about realising you’re a lesbian and in love with your
The sunlight was slowly beginning to filter into the room, creating soft vines of light across Sherlock’s still features. John trailed his fingers over the skin on Sherlock’s arm, which erupted automatically in goose bumps as he did so. He smiled as Sherlock stirred slightly, but instead of disturbing him anymore, John slipped out of bed and moved into the bathroom to relieve himself.
John gasped quietly as Sherlock tumbled to the ground, thinking he had hurt himself when he landed; he was crouching and curling his body over so his toned back was heaving, sweat glistening on his pale skin, yet when he tucked his head into his chest, his hands deliberately coming to position themselves on the floor and he kicked his legs out from underneath himself, John realised this was just a part of his performance. The music continued swelling and shrinking, alive in itself, and in the quiet moments in between the soft chords, John could hear Sherlock’s laboured breathing and his feet moving across the dusty floor with hushed whispers.
John supressed a giggle, picking up the sheet and flicking it so it lay out flat. “That’s all you needed to say, Sherlock. Here, I’ll show you.”
“Yes, well, it was good to finally put a face to the phone calls, Mr. Watson.” Sherlock rushed to grab John’s coat, handing it to him quickly.
He hadn’t realised just how intoxicated he was, but at least the alcohol had made it easy for him to forget about the nightmare he had found himself in today. He was exhausted and devastated and using alcohol to cover that up made things easier for him to cope.
“That’ll be an extra five quid,” she droned, extending her hand expectantly.
She was slightly askew from a hard day and her short hair was lying in tight blonde curls on top of her head. She looked utterly beautiful and happy and it was then that John knew what a mistake he was making if he told her. He couldn’t tell her. Where would he go? Leaving her would mean he was left with
John paused for a moment, mulling over her words. Could you still love someone you haven't spoken to in weeks? Or would that just be considered obsession?
by his mess. Of course John should have
“Do you want them tracked, sir?” the girl’s voice was bored, her expression echoing that. “People do that with wedding invitations, so …”
With the song finished, John allowed the room to fall into silence and crawled into Sherlock’s messy bed, moving onto his side so he could pull Sherlock’s pillow into his chest and breathe in his scent. John wondered whether Sherlock would be feeling the way John was right now. He wondered whether Sherlock would feel as empty as John did. He wondered whether his world would feel as bleak as John’s. He wondered whether Sherlock could no longer feel his fingertips, his body numb with the loneliness that was slowly consuming him. He thought about Sherlock’s music and wondered whether it would still feel the same, or whether it would remind him of the sound of the train rolling over the tracks as he left John behind.
with, was at his work. The fact that everyone who worked with him knew his girlfriend and would think it suspicious if he acted the way he usually did around Sherlock made it ten times worse.
John thought back to the way Sherlock looked at John when they finally said they loved each other: he looked as though he were suddenly breathing again, like the light in his eyes were somehow brighter. He knew that was real. He knew their love was real. He wasn’t ready to give that up. He wanted to fight for Sherlock.
. You’ll work it out.”
Mary narrowed her eyes, a small smile playing at her lips. “Okay then. If you’re not drunk, can you walk in a straight line for me, love?” she said, her voice overly innocent and light.
“Marlene, I don’t exactly know what you’re insinuating here, but think you’ve got some paperwork to finish up. Best get onto that.” John ordered, scowling at her.
“The love of my life,” John murmured under his breath.
“Oh,” John ran his hands through his hair, awkward. “Sorry, what were you just saying?”
like normal adults. You two love each other, yes?” At John’s emphatic nod, she continued. “So do what people who love each other have done for years and
"You really should eat," Harriet said, her mouth half full with muesli. "It's going to be a long day."
John sighed, shaking his head at the sight, before leaning in again and placed another kiss on Sherlock’s lips, his hand returning to its place in his curls. But soon after, Sherlock pulled away from him, his eyes moving over John’s body as if he were getting an idea. Without speaking, he shuffled back and reached out to pull one of John’s feet out from under him to place it in his lap.
John ran his hands through his hair, his breath coming out in hard bursts, misting in the cold air. If only Sherlock would come down and just talk to him for once, he could try and make things better. He was sick of being avoided. He had tried multiple times to call him and text him, but after every attempt ending in radio silence, he had given up trying. Now, he felt seeing him in person was the only way they would talk.
Resting his forehead against Sherlock’s, John couldn’t stop his smile and soon Sherlock was smiling too, eyes shining, his heart swelling with free love for the first time in his life.
Sherlock’s voice rung through the air and John stopped on the outskirts of the garden, just about to enter the carpark, turning to find Sherlock rushing up to him, his cheeks still wet from tears.
“Hey,” a woman’s familiar voice filled John’s ear.
of the dark, so to speak, but lying here with the noise of London around him, he suddenly couldn’t stop remembering the remorseless demeanour of the father as the police apprehended him. He lay on his back, staring up into the dark, and saw the faces of the dead children swimming in front of him. And when he turned onto his side to face Sherlock, he knew Sherlock was lying awake as well, both of them unable to shut their minds off.
Once inside, he ordered a pint and found a spot by himself in the corner. It wasn’t busy – mostly people sitting down to a late lunch, having a few drinks after work. He didn’t want to have too much to drink, but as his thoughts became more turbulent in fretful anticipation of his confrontation with Mary, the more drinks he ordered. Eventually he had gone through five pints of lager and he felt very nearly drunk. Looking at the time, he realised it was time to go home. Mary would be arriving any second now from work. It was time to make the leap.
John ignored this and examined the living room, which was messier than he expected, but quaint and charming nonetheless. Throughout the room, books upon books lay in messy piles, teetering as if they were going to collapse any second. There was an easel propped up in the corner by the window with a canvas on it, the beginnings of an exquisite piece of art started with charcoal on the white material. John walked over to it and examined the piece, which was the beginnings of a shirtless, male dancer in motion, and although it was incomplete, John could feel the lyrical movement of the person on the material. It was beautiful. John noted the familiar jawline and eyes and slowly it dawned on him …
“Let me know when you’re going to come, yeah?” John asked and Sherlock nodded slowly, his eyes falling on John.
“Come to bed, John.”
Pulling away, John watched as Sherlock’s eyes remained closed, his mouth pouting in search for more kisses; his face was flushed, a pale pink that was dusting over his cheekbones and his nose.
“Okay,” Sherlock said quietly.
John shook his head, his mind attempting to come up with some excuse to extricate himself from her presence so he could go upstairs to be amongst Sherlock’s things. He wanted to breathe in his scent so he could feel closer to him, so he could feel not so alone.
. Before he did anything he would later regret.
“John?” Sherlock’s quiet voice filled the space between them.
“What was that, dear?” she leaned in to John, her small hand coming to perch on his armrest.
John had willingly obliged, his cool fingers snaking their way across the sheets to find Sherlock’s hand and curling around it comfortingly. And suddenly, with the weight of Sherlock’s hand in his, John found that he could close his eyes and allow sleep to take him.
John would remember those words forever.
When John returned to the table, their food had arrived and it was delicious – John started on the parmigiana and eventually finished Sherlock’s risotto as well. The conversation flowed easily with Sherlock explaining how he had plans in the next year to move to Sussex, where he would continue teaching part time and pursue new horizons. John, now stuffed, was finishing his third glass of wine. He found himself examining Sherlock from across the table; the way Sherlock’s fingers absentmindedly caressed the table in front of him, drawing circles as he spoke about ballet and his study in classical music. He watched him swallow his drink, his adam’s apple moving under his pale skin. How it was possible for someone to look attractive while they
“John, you have nothing to be sorry for—“
John looked at Sherlock who was rolling his eyes dramatically.
“Don’t be stupid, John, of
“Sherlock tells me you’re a doctor, John?” Mrs. Hudson said, still standing above the pair.
He walked through the maze of cars in the dark parking lot, on his way out to the sidewalk to meet his cab, his breath ghosting out in front of him. Suddenly, he heard a man’s voice travelling towards him.
Sherlock Holmes was sitting at the piano which was sitting in the corner at the top of the studios, his eyes closed as he took in the music that was playing over the speakers. His face rose to the heavens as the violin swelled to a crescendo, his face conveying something akin to sadness if it were not for the smile playing at his thin lips. He kept his eyes closed as the music continued, rising and falling with a depth John couldn’t understand.
John.
“No.”
After he had finished up, John and Sherlock walked out into the street, falling into step together. John was still feeling uneasy about his near miss with the invitations and he couldn’t help but keep seeing the teenage girl’s face as she called him out on his lie. He took a deep breath, sucking the wind in between his teeth in an attempt to clear his thoughts.
Seeing Mary scribble addresses on envelopes and pass them over to John for him to seal made it all the more real. All those people were going to be showing up to watch them take the leap into so-called wedded bliss. His sister was going to be there. His mum and dad. Mary and John’s closest friends. The thought made him feel sick to his stomach.
Thanks so much for reading. Let me know what you guys think <3
“What’s wrong with you?” she questioned brazenly, opening the door wider so she could lean on the door frame.
the motions should be doing. You should be able to taste the music on your tongue as you move through it.”
After meeting the whirlwind Alpha named Sherlock, John had been in a slight daze for the rest of the day. The Alpha hadn't backed away from him after getting close enough to smell how broken he was, like everyone did, like the Beta (Molly) who had brought Sherlock his coffee had. And apparently just from looking at him, Sherlock had known everything about him. It fascinated him to the point that when he had finally made it home he had to look the Alpha up.
"Sherlock?" John asked curious as to what he had just realized.
"I'm fairly sure you must have found it. What I want to know is why you haven't turned it over to the police." John told him softly causing Sherlock to want to jump up and kiss John for believing in him, but he refrain. He didn't want John to get the wrong idea. He wasn't looking for a Mate. "Do people usually assume you're the murderer?" John asked as if sensing his thoughts.
"He climbed up the side of the walls, ran along the roof, dropped in through this skylight." Sherlock informed them.
"I've still got questions." Lestrade said.
" The woman asked.
"The bullet they just dug out of the wall's from a handgun. A kill shot over that distance, from that kind of weapon. That's a crack shot we're looking for. But not just a marksman, a fighter. His hands couldn't have shaken at all, so clearly he's acclimatized to violence. He didn't fire until I was in immediate danger, though, so strong moral principle. You're looking for a man probably with a history of military service," And then Sherlock was looking at him, realization in his eyes, "and nerves of steel..." When John saw that Sherlock understood he had shot the man he looked away from the Alpha, but with an ear still in the conversation. "Actually, do you know what? Ignore me." John's heart speed up at that, Sherlock was protecting him.
"It could be." The man said.
"Been away three days judging by the laundry." Sherlock deduced before looking over at John who had yet to move from his spot next to the bed. "Look at the case, there was something tightly packed inside it." Sherlock ordered but John was still stuck on the fact that Sherlock didn't believe it was a suicide because no matter how hard he tried, he could not find anything that said other wise. "John." He said with a small growl pulling John's attention back to the Alpha.
"Right." John said as Angelo made his way to them.
"Don't touch anything." Sherlock ordered as he opened the door. "This is now a crime scene." And then the Alpha pulled out his phone and called Lestrade.
"What kind of boss was he, Amanda? Appreciative?" Sherlock asked, eyes roaming over her desk, taking in everything. A luxury hand cream.
"She could have left it at a hotel." John suggested.
"You were thinking. It's annoying." Sherlock growled out. He stared at the body for a couple of seconds before kneeling down and rubbed a hand across the woman's back and examined his fingers. Sherlock quickly searched the woman and pulled out a white umbrella from her left pocket. He checked the collar of her jacket before pulling out a magnifying glass and began checking her left wrist and hand. John tilted his head in slight confusion when Sherlock took off the woman's Bonding ring and began to examine it before slipping it back on to her finger.
"Moriarty." Sherlock said.
"What did they steal?" John asked.
"What are we?" John asked suddenly, "Because you obviously called a head of time, before I got there and reserved this table for us, with me as your date. Yet, you don't want a Mate. I'm telling you now, Sherlock, one of these days I want to find a Mate that can over look my-"
"Got my eye on a nice little place in Central London. Together we ought to be able afford it." Sherlock informed John. "We'll meet there tomorrow evening, 7:00." He ordered and John opened his mouth to question him some more. "Sorry, got to dash. I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary."
"No. No, wait..." John said as his brain tried to make sense of everything going on."Mummy? Who's Mummy?"
"If you were dying..." Sherlock started before stopping with a low growl. He shook his head and then seemed to try again. "If you were dying... If you'd been murdered in your last few second, what would you say?"
"Well, I'm dealing with a child." Lestrade said. "Sherlock, this is our case. I'm letting you in, but you do not go off on your own. Clear?"
"He could look to you and tell you your whole life story." Sebastian told John.
"Haven't the faintest. Hungry?" Sherlock asked before leading him into Angelo's and to the seat he had requested. "Thank you, Billy." Sherlock nodded to the waiter before taking off his coat and scarf and sat so that he could watch the street. "22 Northumberland St. Keep your eyes on it." He ordered as John got comfortable.
. It's German for 'revenge'." Anderson said as Sherlock walked over towards the door. "She could be trying to tell us something..."
"Traders come to work at all hours. Some trade with Hong Kong in the middle of the night. That message was intended for somebody who came in at midnight." Sherlock pointed out as he pulled out the name plate and handed it to John. "Not many Van Coons in the phone book. Taxi!"
" The woman asked and John knew that if they were going to get her to let them in, he would need to jump in.
"Course I wasn't." Sherlock told him and John glared at him. "Biding my time. Knew you'd turn up."
"Do you leave your windows open when you go on holiday?" Sherlock asked once they had gotten to the back of the apartment nodding towards the open window as he backed up enough to get a running leap at the ladder. He easily climbed the ladder and made his way to the open window.
Sherlock shot off the couch, fixed his suit, and quickly scanned to see if the swordsman had broken anything. John was already piss off about something, he didn't need to anger him any further by having something of his broken in a fight. The swordsman jumped back up, and before he could continue swinging at him, Sherlock punched him. After getting over the shock of being punched, the swordsman charged at him and pined him to the oak table in the kitchen with the sword against Sherlock's throat. The two struggled against each other and Sherlock growled when the sword dug into the table leaving a noticeable scratch.
"We don't all end up with a bullet through your temple." John pointed out as Sebastian's mobile alerted him of a message.
With a sigh, John slipped out of Sherlock's bed and, with a slight hesitation, grabbed a spare house coat before leaving the room. John padded down the hallway and paused just outside the living room when he spotted Sherlock lounging on the couch in his house coat with his hands stapled under his chin. "There's food in the kitchen." Sherlock told him without opening his eyes.
"Please." John breathed out without thought only to blush when Sherlock winked at him.
"Who says I trust him?" John asked.
"Mrs Hudson!" Sherlock roared just as John yelled:
"Sherlock texted me. He said you forgot this." Angelo said and John looked back at Sherlock, who had moved to stand behind John, in amazement.
"I like company when I go out, and I think better when I talk aloud." He admitted. "The skill just attracts attention, so..." He joked happy when John laughed. "Problem?" He asked when John still hadn't gotten up to take his coat.
"Why are you saying that?" The Inspector asked.
"What do you mean, how? John just said it. Rachel!" The blank look Sherlock received from Lestrade and his team caused him to groan. "Look at you lot, John obviously excluded. You're all so vacant. Is it nice not being me? It must be so relaxing." It felt good to know that Sherlock was not including him in that lot. "Rachel is not a name. John, on the luggage, there's a label. E-mail address." He said giving John a little shove towards the case as he rushed to his laptop.
"I'm sure you know my name." John said sitting back.
"Anything interesting?" The Alpha asked trying not to sound eager causing John to bite back a smile.
"Stop right there. I am in no mood to hear someone bad mouth Sherlock. Yes, he can be annoying. Yes, he is full of himself. And yes, he's smarter than you lot. Now, can you hurry up and just give me his damn journal." John snapped out shocking the Alpha.
"Mrs Hudson, Dr. John Watson." Sherlock introduced and she hugged him just as motherly as she did Sherlock, not bothered at all by his scent. This caused John to relax a little. Since his womb had been damaged no one seemed to treat him the same, they either treated him with pity or as if being near him would cause defect to them. And yet, here were two people who didn't seemed to mind him being broken and treated him as if he weren't. It nearly brought him to tears.
"Of the message?" John asked in confusion. If it wasn't German for revenge, then maybe it was Rachel.
"Are you alright?" John asked rushing to help him stand.
"That was amazing." John said slowly and honestly. With one look this Alpha was able to see everything about him. He knew he should be annoyed or even angry, but he wasn't, he was actually impressed and wished to see him do it again. His response seemed to come as a shock to Sherlock.
"Bit different from my day." The Omega muttered as he looked around the room. Doctor. That pipped Sherlock's interest. It wasn't everyday that an Omega became a Doctor much less a military doctor.
"We don't know a thing about each other." John said with a small smile, he was gaining entertainment from this. "I don't know where we're meeting, I don't even know your name."
"She said..." John started only to stop and look away. Was he trying to gather up the curage or stifle any rage he felt from whatever she had told him. "She said you get off on this. You enjoy it."
"Freak's here. Bringing him in." She growled into her walkie as she and Sherlock lead him into the abandoned building that was their crime scene. On their way inside, John watched Sherlock look at everything and wondered what he was seeing, what stories was he being told? When they were right in front of the door, another Beta step out and blocked their way. This one was a scrawny looking male in a blue forensics suit. When he saw Sherlock his lips puckered as if he had just took a bite of a lemon.
"Obvious." Sherlock pointed out.
"I need to ask some advice." Sherlock informed him, shocking John.
"What's that?" John asked hating how small his voice had suddenly become.
"You're not broken." Sherlock told him firmly. "You're wounded, not broken." It was silent between them before Sherlock forced himself to look back at the street as he pushed his menu away from him. "Eat. We might have a long wait." Angelo came back and placed a non-scented candle in the middle of their table.
"Say that again." Sherlock ordered.
"Delivering?" She asked.
"What's your name then?" John asked curious to see if she'll give out her real name or not.
"I'm not implying anything. I'm sure Sally came round for a nice little chat," Sherlock said gently taking a hold of John's wrist again and began to lead him around Anderson, John saw him glance at Sally's knees, "and just happened to stay over." Sherlock paused just inside the door, he gently pushed John further into the building before addressing the two Betas again. "And I assume she scrubbed your floors, going by the state of her knees." With that said, Sherlock closed the door and walked passed John and further into the house.
"Don't bother." John told him causing the man to chuckle amusingly.
"You think so?" Sherlock asked reminding John of a shy little boy.
"Well, that's where this gets really interesting, but for that, we'll have to go back to the reception desk." Sebastian informed and Sherlock motioned for him to lead the way. And within minutes they were huddled around a computer behind the reception desk as Sebastian pulled up the security log. "Every door that opens in this bank, it gets logged right here. Every walk-in cupboard, every toilet."
"But how?" Lestrade asked.
"Close enough." Sherlock said.
"I see." Sherlock said turning back towards the wall and John thought that was the end of that conversation. John bit back a grunt as the pain flared again and began to turn to head into the kitchen to get him something to snack on while Sherlock pulled out his phone and texted someone. Sherlock spun on the balls of his feet away from the wall and quickly made his way to the coat closet without a word. John sighed, it seems they were leaving again. John allowed Sherlock to quickly bundle him into his coat before following the Alpha out of their flat.
"That's him." John said
"Yeah." Sherlock said flashing his badge. "Everything all right?"
"Are you sure?" John asked.
"Oh, for God's sake, if you're just making this up..." The Inspector growl out threateningly.
"Van Coon was left-handed." Sherlock stated before trying to contort himself as he mimicked trying to shoot himself with his left hand on the right side of his head. "Requires quite a bit of contortion." He taunted.
"How long?" John demanded hoarsely.
John followed Sherlock out of their flat and down the stairs. "Sorry, Mrs Hudson, I'll skip the tea. Off out."
"I phoned Lestrade. Is he on his way?" Sherlock asked in a guarded voice.
"So... Another case cracked. How very public-spirited." The man said eyeing Sherlock's arm around John's waist. "Though that's never really your motivation, is it?"
"End of Baker Street there's a good Chinese. Stays open till 2:00. You can tell a good Chinese by the bottom third of the door handle." Sherlock informed John who froze when he saw the mysterious caller step out of a familiar black car. From the growl Sherlock was letting out, John was sure he had spotted the man as well.
He had gotten that request days ago, accepted it, and had solved it within hours. He just hadn't gotten around to e-mailing the person back with the results. But before he could begin to type out a response, the door to the flat burst open as a Arabic swordsman ran in. Sherlock carefully tossed John's laptop onto John's chair and began dancing around every swing of the sword. The swordsman cornered Sherlock on the couch and went to swing at him, but Sherlock kicked him away causing him to stumble and trip over the coffee table.
"What kind of a message would everyone try to avoid?" Sherlock hinted at trying to help John come to the same conclusion Sherlock had already come to. "What about this morning? Those letters you were looking at?"
"Yeah, I know, I got fat." Mike joked misreading the look in John's face.
"Four." Sherlock corrected her confusing John. Unless Sherlock knew of one that hadn't been made public, John was pretty damn sure there was only three. "There's been a fourth. And there's something different this time." He continued as John heard a car door slam.
"Of course. Yes. Enough for a life time, far too much." Sherlock finally stopped with his chest nearly touching John's, and for a split second, John wondered if the Alpha was going to either scent him, kiss him, or both.
"Take my card." Sherlock told him, the thought of John using the money Sherlock had earned from all of his cases gave him a warm feeling. He was proving to John that he could and would take care of him. And though he knew what that feeling entailed and were that thought process would lead him to, he didn't feel the urge to run and hide. He couldn't stop the loving smile from appearing on his face.
"Can you print me up a copy?" Sherlock asked.
"Stop it! We can't giggle, it's a crime scene. Stop it." John said trying to reprimand Sherlock, but his giggling wasn't helping.
"Have you talked to the police?" John asked as Sherlock shot out of his chair and threw on his suit jacket.
"I was invited." He informed her simply.
"Why do you keep saying suitcase?" The Inspector asked cutting into their strange little moment causing Sherlock to jolt back as if he had been shocked.
"Of course she's not." Sherlock growled out in annoyance as he began to look something up on his phone. "She's from out of town though. Intended to stay in London for one night before returning home to Cardiff." He said putting his phone away. "So far, so obvious."
"Welcome to London." Sherlock said causing John to laugh before he stalked off.
"Think about what Sebastian told us. About Van Coon, about how he stayed afloat in the market." Sherlock said.
"It's for men." Sherlock informed the Beta who rolled his eyes.
throw them away." He warned as he went back into the kitchen.
"Sorry?" John asked at the sudden change of subject.
"No, that's fine." John told her politely. He raised an eyebrow when she blushed and checked him over. He had to have imagined that, he was broken. No one wanted a broken Omega. Well, no one other than Sherlock.
"Maybe a little." John told him never looking up from the phone as he wondered how Sherlock had gotten his number.
John sighed as he finished eating his meal that Sherlock had had delivered from Angilos the second they had gotten back to the house, while watching Sherlock pace in front of the fireplace while skimming a book on languages in his hand. Sherlock growled in annoyance and slammed the book closed.
"Yes, I see it." Sherlock told him softly.
"So who did I meet?" John asked, his tone telling him he would not drop the subject until he got his answer.
"Shut up, everybody! Shut up! Don't move, don't speak, don't breath. I'm trying to think. Anderson, face the other way. You're putting me off." Sherlock roared.
"And you don't mean duty free." John said, from the corner of his eye, Sherlock caught three Alpha's and four Beta's eyeing his John up and down, this caused Sherlock to reach across the table and take John's hand, intertwining their fingers. A silent message that John was his.
"He fired a shot when his attacker came in." Sherlock informed as he slipped his coat on.
"Address?" Anthea asked after John had put his phone away and checked his hand.
"Really? I thought it was a big improvement. Your mouth's too small now." He told her in hopes that it would keep her from wanting to date him as he went back to The Work while taking a sip of his coffee.
"Two trips around the world this month." John said obviously curious how he deduced that out. Sherlock smirked at him. "You didn't ask his secretary, you said that just to irritate him."
"You know him better than I do." John said as Lestrade slipped his coat on.
"I prefer to text." Sherlock told him.
"Which was it, Afghanistan or Iraq?" Sherlock repeated turning to look John in his eyes. Blue with a speck of green. John quickly looked away from him to glare at Mike.
"Am I your date?" John asked and Sherlock stiffened up. He knew he should say no, that if he didn't John would get the wrong idea, but for the first time in his life he didn't want to say no.
"Well this could be very nice." John said with a nod as he began to hobble around the living room taking everything in. "Very nice indeed."
"Right, have a look." Sherlock said releasing him before gently pushing him to the computer (John's) that was open and had an article pulled up.
"Sherlock!" He cried out happily shaking Sherlock's hand. "Anything on the menu, whatever you want, free. On the house, for you and your date." He continued handing them the menus. And Sherlock knew he should correct Angelo that this wasn't actually a date, but he just couldn't make himself do so. Part of him wanted it to be a date.
"You've got to admit, it's similar. Both man killed by someone who can walk through solid walls." John pointed out.
"But the gun-" Dimmock growled out.
"I'm not even sure it's a proper language." He told Sherlock with a smirk causing Sherlock growl at him in annoyance.
"Yes." John answered firmly, setting a hand on top of Sherlock's, silently claiming him. Sebastian raised a reprimanding brow at John. Sebastian never did like the idea of Omega's being out spoken and independent, he preferred them to be subservient and stay at home.
"Her case?" John asked.
"Pink!" Sherlock yelled before finally leaving. It took John a second to understand what he meant. Were they looking for a pink suitcase?
"If you do move into, um... 221B Baker Street," He read from the notebook, I'd be happy to pay you a meaningful sum of money on a regular basis to ease your way." That pissed John off. Who did this man thank he was? Did he really expect John to spy on Sherlock? A thought suddenly hit him. How many new acquaintance had this man kidnapped and offered money for them to spy on Sherlock? How many had actually taken the offer?
"The time was right, but the date was wrong. It was set two days ago. Crossed the date line twice and he didn't alter it." Sherlock informed as they stepped onto the second escalator.
"Sherlock?" John called when the GPS said the phone was in the flat.
"You've got a psychosomatic limp, of course you've got a therapist. Then there's your brother." Sherlock said suddenly reaching into John's pocket and fished out his phone. "Your phone. It's expensive, e-mail enabled, MP3 player. And your looking for a flatshare. You wouldn't waist money on this. It's a gift, then. Scratches. Not one, many over time. It's been in the same pocket as keys and coins. The man sitting next to me wouldn't treat his one luxury item like this, so it's had a previous owner. Next bit's easy. You know it already." He said turning the phone over to show the engraving on the back.
"Remind me. When was the last time that it rained?" Sherlock asked before shooting from his seat, forcing John to do so too (causing John to spill his drink onto himself), and ran outside, pulling John with him. Sherlock didn't let go of John's hand until they were at the door the phone book sat at. Sherlock ran his thumb along the ruined pages from the whole in the packaging.
"Any good?" Sherlock asked.
"It's a crime scene. I don't want it contaminated. Are we clear on that?" Anderson hissed out in a weak attempt of an order.
." The woman said, sounding slightly more curious than cautious. "
"They all did. They're not strictly speaking on the drug squad, but they're very keen." Lestrade informed them.
"You can't withhold evidence, and I didn't break into your flat." Lestrade said.
"Got everything I need to know. That graffiti was a message." Sherlock told him. "Someone at the bank, working on the trading floors. We find the intended recipient and..."
"It's a drug bust." Lestrade said shocking John. Sherlock couldn't possibly use drugs. He wouldn't dare risk destroying his mind like that? Would he?
"Yeah. And can I use your balcony?" Sherlock asked dropping his act.
to pay attention to your surroundings when you walk?" John snapped at him alerting Sherlock that John was pissed.
"You heard me perfectly." Sherlock growled out angrily. "I'm not saying it again." Why was Sherlock suddenly angry? Did he not like the fact that he needed advice? But he had been just fine until he had informed John of this fact. Was Sherlock angry at himself for needing help? Did he think that John would look at him differently now?
"John." Sherlock warned and John looked at him in shock.
"Four people are dead, there's isn't time to talk to the police." Sherlock informed him.
"Sorry, you were saying?" Sherlock asked looking away and saw her deflate just a bit.
"In Afghanistan. There was an actual wound." Sherlock said wrapping an arm around John's shoulders.
"So, what exactly am I going to be doing here?" John asked trying not to laugh at the annoyed look on Sherlock's face from that tidbit he had just told him.
"Colleague of mine, Dr Watson." Sherlock said grabbing John's wrist and gently pulled him under the tape. "Dr Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan. Old friend." Sherlock introduced, hissing out the last two words in a way that John knew was a lie even without the glare Donovan had sent him.
"What, so-so-so you set up a pretend drugs bust to bully me?" Sherlock asked, stuttering in anger.
"In a manner of speaking. Took me less than a minute to guess yours, not exactly Fort Knox." Sherlock told him. He heard John sigh just before he stormed over and slammed the laptop shut and took it away. Point taken. When John is in a bad mood, do not touch his stuff with out permission. Would John be willing to come with him to the bank when he was in such a bad mood? He needed to physically go to the bank and look at everything to see what was missing from the e-mail.
"What? I..." Sherlock started before the kitchen door opened to show a pissed off Anderson and a deep growl flew from Sherlock. "Anderson, what are you doing here on a drugs bust?"
"We can't both stare." Sherlock argued before grabbing his coat and scarf and running out the door, pausing long enough for John to catch up before taking off after the taxi as it began to move.
Sherlock sighed and grabbed John's laptop once more and signed in. He quickly messaged the person about where the Jaria Diamond could be found before checking his most recent e-mail. Sherlock's eyes narrowed and growled when he saw who it was from. Sebastian Wilkes. Him and Wilkes had gone to Uni together, even stayed in the same building. Wilkes had been someone who Sherlock had thought would be a friend, would possibly understand him. They had seemed to get along quite well, until Sherlock deduced something he shouldn't have. And then Sebastian tormented him the rest of Uni.
"And you invaded Afghanistan." Sherlock said causing both of them to laugh as John shifted to rest against Sherlock.
"Know the author?" Sherlock asked gently taking the spray can from John's hands and tossing it into the bag full of spray cans next to the young Omega's feet before taking John's hand into his. The feeling of Sherlock's larger hand against his calmed him down just enough. John looked at Sherlock who was watching the young Omega with a bored look and the young man flipped through the pictures.
"A fourth?" Mrs Hudson asked as someone ran up the stairs and into their flat. A Bonded Alpha with short graying hair.
"Soon as we get all this rubbish cleaned out." John said just as Sherlock said:
"Who's this? Who's speaking?" John asked wondering if the person had mistaken him for someone else.
"Why?" John asked.
Life with someone was different than Sherlock had expected it to be. He had thought that he would have been hiding in his room or running his new flatmate out of the flat to do whatever they would do for the whole day. But, with John, Sherlock always wanted John with him or in the flat within ear shot. He found out very quickly that he loved having John in his arms as they slept and for the past week he had pulled John into his room at night. And though Sherlock didn't sleep much he found watching John sleep at night fascinating.
"jennie dot pink at mephone dot org dot uk." John read to him.
"Are you still at Barts then?" John asked and Mike seemed eager to talk about something that didn't seem be a touchy subject.
"You'll have to meet him to find out." Mike said before cheeking his watch. "He should still be at Barts." With that said Mike stood up and began to walk in the direction of Barts. John sat there for a second or two before he forced himself to stand and follow Mike.
"Teaching now." Mike said with an awkward laugh. "Yeah, bright young things like we used to be. God, I hate them." He joked causing John to chuckle as he shifted his cane to rest more comfortably against his leg, drawing Mike's attention to it. "What about you, just staying in town till you get yourself sorted?"
"Bills?" John asked. What did bills have anything to do with this? John's eyes widened when Sherlock suddenly pulled something black and papery from Van Coon's mouth. And, unless Van Coon had placed that in his mouth before shooting himself, then Sherlock was right that this was not a suicide.
"You can't just break into my flat. Do you know how long it will take to get your stench out of here!?" Sherlock growled.
"Who'd want to kill him?" John asked, letting Sebastian know that he would not stay quiet.
"Yeah. I pickpocket him when he's annoying." Sherlock admitted. "You can keep that one, I've got plenty at the flat." That caused John to start laughing again. "What?"
"You told him about me?" John asked accusingly.
"About an hour ago. Where were you?" Sherlock asked checking him over from the corner of his eye. And unlike when the Beta had checked him out, Sherlock's gaze relaxed him.
"That's not what people normally say." Sherlock told him quietly shocking John.
"Yes, thank you for your input." Sherlock said slamming the door closed in Anderson's face.
"What about it?" John asked.
"Somebody must know something about it." Sherlock said.
"You had a row with a machine?" Sherlock asked tensing up. Mycroft had known about the fight happening in the flat and had tampered with the machine to keep John out longer, but that had caused John anger to rise. Sherlock bit back a growl at that. Mycroft needed to keep his nose out of their lives.
?" Donovan question and John was really starting to hate her. "How do
"He scaled six floors of a Docklands apartment building," Sherlock growled at him, "jumped the balcony and killed Van Coon."
"It's Anderson." The Alpha said causing Sherlock to growl.
"Where did you get this?" John asked. "Detective Inspector Lestrade?" He read.
"What will you be doing?" John asked when he noticed Sherlock putting on his own coat.
"Somebody's been in here before me!" Sherlock repeated.
"Well, he won't be your assistant." The Alpha told Sherlock in annoyance.
to be taken care of as an Omega. Sherlock sat down and took John's hand, sending a silent message to Sebastian that John was off limits.
"Yes." The man drawled out in a slight purr, John's hackles rose when he caught the mockery undertone. "The bravery of the soldier. Bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity, don't you think? What is your connection to Sherlock Holmes?"
John stood over the dead body of Edward Van Coon. Van Coon had been an Alpha and, from the evidence, had taken his own life. John didn't miss the fact that had he not met Sherlock weeks ago, this would have been him. John took a shaky breath as Sherlock returned to the room slipping on forensic gloves. "Do you think he lost a lot of money? I mean suicide is pretty common among the city boys." He said only to receive a hard look from Sherlock. Had he said something wrong? Statistically, speaking, people who live closer to the middle of London do take their lives more than those who don't.
"I play the violin when I'm thinking and sometimes I don't talk for days on end." Sherlock informed the obviously very confused Omega. "Would that bother you? Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other." He watched in slight amusement as the Omega took in everything that Sherlock had told him before his eyes began to shift between him and Mike.
"Hiya, buddy. How long has it been, eight years since I last clapped eyes on you?" Sebastian said as he took a 'discreet' sniff of Sherlock. His eyes widened before looking at John and, not so discreetly, checked him out. Sherlock felt his hackles rise at that. His scent was clearly on John so there was no mistaking that John was off limits. But then, this was Sebastian who believed he had the right to everything and that if he wanted something he would be allowed to have it. Sherlock would just have to prove him wrong.
Sherlock knew that if he, for some ungodly reason, ever did find himself with a Mate then that said Mate would distract him from The Work. He could not have that. His whole world revolved around The Work. It was the only thing, besides Cocaine, that kept his brain occupied. Without The Work, he would be bored. And a bored Sherlock was a disaster in itself. Last time he was board, he nearly burnt a whole block down.
"Is that what?" Sherlock challenged wanting to see how John would react to an Alpha's challenge. Most Omega's would instantly back down and cower away, but John just squared his shoulders and raised his chin in defiance to either his own biology or to Sherlock's challenge he didn't know. But it interested him.
"I said he's with me." Thankfully the Inspector left it at that.
"Went through the open window." Sherlock explained as he put on his gloves.
"The killer must have driven her to Lauriston Gardens. He could only keep her case by accident if it was in the car. Nobody could be seen with this case without drawing attention to themselves, particularly a man, which is statistically more likely. So obviously he'd feel compelled to get rid of it. The moment he noticed he still had it, wouldn't have taken him more than five minutes to realize his mistake." Sherlock said looking away from the case to glance at John and nearly lost his thought when he saw the amazed look on John's face and in his eyes. He had never met anyone who thought his ability to read things and people as amazing as John did. People only ever hated him for it. Yet this Omega, this man, was amazed by it, by him.
"Oh, don't worry, there's all sorts round here." Mrs Hudson told him soothingly. All sorts of what? There couldn't be many broken Omega's, could there? "Mrs Turner next door's got Bonded ones." John stiffened at that. If Alpha's and Beta's couldn't even stand to be near him to want to mate with him what made her think anyone wanted to Bond with him? He staid frozen as she went into the kitchen. "Oh. Sherlock, the mess you've made."
." Sherlock growled.
"Well, you know what I think, don't you?" The Beta said.
"But who is he?" The Inspector asked again causing Sherlock to growl at him.
"Late that night, he dies too." Sherlock finished coming to stand next to him.
"I've known him for five years, and no, I don't. Didn't even know he was interested in mating anyone." Lestrade said and John had to fight a blush.
When they had gotten to the bedroom, Sherlock gently pushed John onto the bed before disappearing confusing John. And then, Sherlock had come back with John's night clothes. "Change." The Alpha had ordered gently handing John his clothes before stepping out. After John realized what the heck was going on, he had changed. And before he could let Sherlock know he was done, Sherlock was back in the room and was now laying, sprawled out, on the bed. He had also changed and was now in sweats and a house coat.
"Just moved in?" Sherlock stated confusing John.
"Right." John said before he continued into the kitchen where he began to search the refrigerator for the food Sherlock mentioned and nearly screamed in fright when he saw a head in the fridge. He slammed the fridge shut before running into the living room where he noticed Sherlock had sat up, concern in his eyes. "There's a head in the fridge!" He told the Alpha.
"A friend?" Sherlock growled out.
"And I said 'dangerous,' and here you are." Sherlock countered before moving over to John and gently pulled him out of the chair. Within seconds, Sherlock had John in his coat and was leading him out of the flat. His plan was set in motion. He would kill two birds with one stone.
"No, no." John said shaking his head while awkwardly looking around not wanting Mike to know the real meaning behind John's look.
"We have to find her." Sherlock told him.
"You don't seem the kind to make friends easily. Not after what happened to you in the war." The man said lazily and John took in a hard breath as the walls began to try and close in around them.
"What about your taxi?" Mrs Hudson asked.
"I mean, it actually is a childish feud?" John asked looking between the brothers.
"My deodorant?" Anderson asked confused.
"Who was it?" Sherlock asked never taking his eyes off the pictures.
"Quite clear." Sherlock growled back in a challenge. "And is your Mate away for long?"
That news had shattered Johns hopes and dreams. Ever since John had presented as an Omega he had two dreams. The first one, being a Doctor in the military, had come true. But the second one that had sat on the back burner while he was a doctor in the military was to find his Alpha and start a family. And now, John closed his eyes to fight back his tears, now that would never happen.
"Yes. Yes, must have been. Through that window." John squeaked out.
? Wait." Donovan turned her attention to John. "Did he follow you home?" She question.
"He's with me." Sherlock said.
"Are we done?" John growled out.
"Yes." John said receiving an intense stare from the Alpha. "That's true, isn't it? But he wasn't a very nice man."
"I'm a consulting detective. Only one in the world, I invented the job." Sherlock bragged.
"Rachel." Anderson said. "So we can read her e-mails. So what?"
"Yeah, it's for shock." Lestrade told him as John tried not to draw attention to himself.
"Says the man at the door." Sherlock said just before someone knocked on the door confusing John. After receiving a gentle nudge from Sherlock towards the door, John walked over to the door and opened it to find Angelo standing there holding his cane. It was then that John realized he hadn't been limping or using his cane since they began chasing the taxi.
And though Sherlock had wanted to hold this off for a couple of days, he didn't want to run John off that quick. Why he didn't know, but he figured it had to do with how interesting John was turning out to be. But if John was going to be his flatmate then he needed to know who he was sharing the flat with.
"Hello, freak!" She said crossing her arms.
"Yeah, she's downstairs. I tried shouting but she didn't hear." Sherlock said.
"So, out of 300 people, I'm sure you were able to narrow it down. So, who is it meant for?" John asked and Sherlock smirked at him.
"It was a threat, that's what the graffiti meant." Sherlock informed Sebastian after having lead John (by hand) to the Alpha's table. John quickly took note of the four men sitting at the table they were standing next to, all but one of the men were Alphas, the other was a Beta.
"Yeah." Sherlock said his eyes narrowing.
"You're a doctor." Sherlock suddenly said causing John to jump in shock not hearing him come back in. "In fact, you're an Army doctor."
"Now look, whatever you're trying to imply..." Anderson started threateningly.
"I'm breaking every rule letting you in here..." The Inspector started.
"I guess that's true if you ignore some evidence." John muttered as Sherlock released him to pace angrily.
"Yes, how did you know?" John asked, that was one question that was bugging him, that and how he knew about Harry.
"Sherlock, what have you done?" Mrs Hudson asked in concerned fear causing Sherlock to look at her.
"That's true, he was a bad cabbie." Sherlock said wrapping an arm around John's waist and began leading him away from the crime scene. "You should have seen the route he took us to get here." He joked and John began to giggle.
"Yeah." The man answered with a little nervous laugh.
"Um, I could always do with the money." He told her with a polite smile, making her blush darker. She was just warm, the room did feel a tad bit warm.
"That's a skull." John said noticing the scull on the mantel after the Alpha had moved over there while 'straightening up' and stabbed a knife into the mantel.
"Sleep." Sherlock told him as he began to run his hand through John's hair, luring him into a deep sleep. A sleep that had not been disturbed by nightmares. John sat on the bed, wrapped in the blankets soaked with Sherlock's scent, shocked that he had been able to sleep through the whole night. It had been years since he had slept the whole night. John's stomach growled informing him that he was hungry.
"Who do we trust even if we don't know them? Who passes unnoticed wherever they go? Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?"
"How could you possibly that?" John panted out. He hadn't run like that since boot camp.
"Didn't look like it." She told him with a smirk, looking as if Sherlock had just proven a point. John rolled his eyes and walked past her and under the tape and began to walk away looking for any taxi he could hail. "You're not his friend." Donovan called out to him making him stop. "He doesn't have friends." John turn to glare at him. "So who are you?"
"You said you could identify a software designer by his tie and an airline pilot by his left thumb?" John questioned.
"Is your flat?" Anderson asked.
"Afghanistan or Iraq?" Sherlock asked obviously shocking John as Mike shot the Omega a smirk.
"They won't work with me." Sherlock told him.
"Suitcase! Did anyone find a suitcase? Was there a suitcase in this house?" He called running down the stairs.
"Put those back!" Sherlock ordered.
"Who are you? What do you do?" John asked.
"Sorry to interfere with everyone's digestions." Sherlock said sarcastically. "Still want to make an appointment? Would maybe 9:00 at Scotland Yard suit?" Sebastian nervously tugged at his collar before getting up and heading towards the restroom with them close behind. Sebastian began to wash his hands and John leaned against the counter and glared at him waiting to hear what he had to say, while Sherlock stood in front of the door to keep him from leaving until he was done with him.
