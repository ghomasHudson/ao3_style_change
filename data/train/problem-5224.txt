“Just get ‘em all,” Dean says, patting Jack on the shoulder and leading him up to the counter. It’s only then he realizes he’s a 40 year old man, with what seems to be another young man, buying 4 bottles of nail polish. His cheeks heat, but he keeps a determined dour, stoic expression as they hand their purchases to the girl at the counter.
“Hello again Benny.” Cas smiles softly, standing and moving towards Benny and also hugging him.
Turning to thank Castiel, he noticed the man’s eyes snap up from what was clearly ass level and he smirked. The smile fell off his face though when his eyes skidded past Castiel to his own door down the hall and a thought occurred to him.
“Was there something else kid?”
“Anyway,” Dean says, trying hard not to think about that little tidbit of information, “what color are you getting?”
Cas was sitting next to Dean, their thighs brushing together as Dean’s cheeks flushed from more than just the alcohol in his system. Sam and Eileen were frantically signing to one another trying to keep up with the rapid fire jokes Charlie was spouting as she sat in Rowena’s lap. Mary was hitting John on the back for an uncouth comment he’d made about something or other while Jack and Claire were deep in discussion about some meme she was trying to get him to understand.
When they get to the local CVS Dean searches for about ten minutes before he figures out where the nail polish is. “Whoa,” he says as they stand in front of the giant wall of makeup.
Jack tilts his head “how come no one asked me to bring back this Benny person if he is so special to Dean in most worlds?”
Jo bent over and flicked him in the nose, hard. "I know it's not, you dumbass, but like it or not, this falls on you. You chose the crazy guy with attachment issues and what I think may be possible anger management issues, so it's on you, like it or not."
Castiel growls and takes off his glasses. "You're my Dr. Sexy." He grumbles, his face turning red.
"Actually, anything you want to do,
After a hot shower and sandwiches made by Jo, because she actually felt sorry for him and was the best friend ever, Dean texted Castiel and told him he was coming over. The response Dean received simply read
"He's… doing really well." Dean said. "He's the same old Sammy. I can tell it hurts, like the light here is too bright for him after all of that darkness, but it's him, Cas. We did it. We got him out."
"Goddamnit." Cas grumbled.
When he said that, Dean felt him tense up, his body a drum.
"Of course."
"Are you trying to get me all hot and bothered first thing in the morning?" Dean murmured. He reached over and dragged his fingers along Castiel's hips. "Doing that."
Castiel didn't move. Dean reached over and plied the beer from his hands. He set it on the table.
"The ceiling isn't going to answer your questions, Cas. There is no God. Remember what Uriel said, what Raphael and Michael said? God's dead. Or at least he's a deadbeat Dad who isn't paying Cas's baby mama any child support." Dean said sarcastically, taking a huge swig from a bottle of Wild Turkey. It was his third in five days and it was almost gone.
"You're still doing well?" He felt dumb asking, because for once, it was obvious.
"You're still here?" He asked.
but it happens. I'm mostly surprised that he didn't send me flowers or buy me a car, with how apologetic he is." She said.
Dean shook his head and bent over and tickled Cas's ear. Cas stirred and lifted his head. He groaned when he saw Dean, or maybe it was just the smell of the Crowley mix. Dean hoped it was the latter.
Dean groaned and sat up. "I hate you too." He said sorrowfully.
"Right, Hell, torture, Lucifer… well, it's there. I can remember it and it is… bad. But it's kind of a haze, almost like it was a bad nightmare, well, the worst nightmare. It hurts, but right now it's an ache instead of roaring, flesh searing pain. Which is weird. It wasn't like that for you Dean, not at all. Shouldn't this be worse?" He said slowly.
"I know." Cas mumbled.
Did he really want to be here? Is this what he wanted?
"Yes. I feel like it gets the message that something is incorrect across more effectively than any other color." He said, as he crossed an answer out.
"Let's go out." Castiel said. "We haven't really left this house except to go to Jo's place and I think you could use a break."
"It's all I know, Cas. It's all I've known my whole life." He said.
Castiel's eyes widened and he turned purple. Dean choked on his coffee and almost had to pull over.
"He's not my family."
"Oh, well. For the best, like I said…" She said, her voice trailing off. She shook her head. "Let me get your brother."
"Gabe, your flirting is beginning to get creepy." She said, smirking at him. "Is your sister here? I'm much more interested in her."
"Yes, and when Raffie went down, his forces just kind of… well, they gave up! Angels need a leader and now that leader is Gabriel." Balthazar said.
Despite his clear exasperation at seeing Balthazar again, Cas reached over to bottle of bourbon that had been present since the supernatural had reappeared in their lives. He poured Balthazar a cup and handed it to him.
"Please. I want you too. I'm not going to break. I swear, I won't break. I just… god, I need you." Castiel whimpered, his breath hot in Dean's ear.
"I'm sorry, Cas. I didn't mean to be an asshole." He said softly.
"I'm exhausted. Human emotions are exhausting. Also, my feet sting where I stepped on the glass." Cas muttered.
"Is that such a bad thing?" Cas mumbled, reattaching himself to Dean's mouth.
"I think you should slow it down with the shots." Castiel said. "I'm not going to get mad over this, because I know you're just drunk and sad, but at least slow it down."
Cas stood there, looking embarrassed and uncomfortable, like he had just been caught sneaking a peek in the girls locker room or cheating on a math test.
Dean sat down on the couch and they spent the next half hour working without much distraction. He glanced at Castiel, who was hunched over papers, glasses falling down his nose. He watched as Castiel actually grimaced at an answer on the test, and scribbled something in red pen.
He could tell she was crying.
"Hell has a new boss?" Cas said, suddenly interested.
"Yes, you dope. I never would have come back here if it weren't for you. I'm so goddamn happy I did."
"You know, I've lost track of the smiles." Cas said.
"Honey, I ran into Jo at the supermarket and invited her over to help with dinner. I haven't seen this girl in such a long time!" Mary said, smiling at Jo. They set bags of groceries on the kitchen table.
"Dean, it'll be fine. I wouldn't have come if I weren't ready. Are
"Yeah man, I'm sorry; I should have said something about that. At the time, I didn't think about it… I was only thinking about getting Sammy out, about killing those goddamn demons." Dean murmured.
It worked because Castiel stopped his groping to gape at her. Dean just chuckled.
"Cas." He moans as the horrible sounds of Melt Banana rouse him from delicious sleep. "Cas, turn off your goddamn phone or change your ringtone, for the love of God."
you and I want us to have a connection that is more than sexual." He said into Castiel's ear.
"Then I saw you, Dean. I saw you there and I knew that my journey was worth it." Cas said, almost wistfully, which almost made Dean laugh.
Dean's eyes lit up. "Is it similar?"
"I'm sorry." She said. "That was shitty of me."
Dean groaned inwardly and lifted himself off Castiel, whose eyes were still burning. He winked at him again and stood up.
Cas shook his head. Dean sighed. He remembered the night before, when Cas had been 'worried' and how edgy he had been in the hours following Dean's fight with his mother.
Dean said, feeling equal parts disgusted and outraged. "Jo! I know you! You didn't wear anything underneath these! You liked to do the pyramid without them!"
Cas looked like he might throw up when Gabriel said that. Somehow Dean knew that having the deaths of thousands of angels suddenly placed on his shoulders was not something that Cas needed. Luckily Gabriel realized this.
When he said that, Castiel's eyes were far away, back to a time when Dean hadn't known him and things had been much worse.
"Just visiting for the weekend. Couldn't miss Gabe's big Halloween bash. Jo, you look very nice tonight. I appreciate the veracity of your costume." She said.
Dean grinned in spite of himself. Leave it to Sam to make him smile. "He's got a point, Cas. In the grand scheme of things, I guess your eyeballs moving a little bit doesn't really compare to how the Winchester clan deals."
"How was it?" He asked quietly.
"How do you think we go about summoning Crowley? He's the king of Hell now, so the spell is going to require more juice than your average spell for a crossroads demon." Dean wondered, amazed that he was actually considering summoning 'the New Lucifer.'
They were seated at the dining room table, eating dinner. Cas had discovered that he loved cooking after he watched an all-night Paula Deen marathon and had just prepared his first "real" dinner, which consisted of corn on the cob, turkey burgers, and cherry pie. Dean was a little wary to let Cas take over the kitchen, but he had insisted. Dean was glad he'd let him, because Cas was a damn fine cook.
Dean thought about bringing up Castiel talking to his mother like they were best friends, but decided against it. He'd picked enough fights the night before.
"How do love thee? Let me count the ways." He murmured. "Dean, have you ever read that poem?"
"At first, no. I thought you were selfish and weak and that you spurned God. I saw how brightly your soul burned, even in the depths of Hell, and I should have known then, but I didn't. Then… well, there was you, every day, and I grew to care. I grew to understand you, and why you did the things you did. And well, at the end of my previous life, I found that I had grown to love you." Cas said.
"Oh, Cas. Don't… don't cry. Don't cry again" Dean said. He couldn't stand that right now.
"Jo, I love how, even here, you're showing up at my house unannounced at the worst times." He said, sending her a tight smile.
Once again, Dean knew he was being an asshole, but he was getting sick of Cas's praying. He missed Cas's misplaced sense of optimism, however fake it was.
"Sam didn't get it from him." Dean repeated.
Castiel watched this interaction with fascination. Dean grabbed his hand and led him into the living room.
"Leave me alone." Castiel wheezed. He was sitting on the edge of the bathtub, crying.
"Don't worry Cas, we'll get you answers… somehow. We'll get answers for everything." Dean whispered, stroking his hair.
Dean felt tears spring to his eyes. He didn't want to imagine what the demons had done with Bobby's corpse, nor did he want to imagine what they had planned to do to him. It had to be horrible.
Dean felt a little taken aback. He expected that Sam was taking it two or three times a day, but he didn't ask. 20 milligrams three times a day was a lot. No wonder he was so tired. He sighed, thinking about how Sam would have to do this every day for the rest of his life. Dean wordlessly wrapped the tourniquet around Sam's arm and prepped the needle. He glanced at Sam, who looked slightly nauseated. Despite receiving injections three times a day, for years now, Sam was still scared of needles.
“You really think that you’ll be able to kill him with that? The moment he has you pinned against a wall you’re done.”
“Yeesh. The old Novak house? That place gives me the heebie jeebies.” Charlie shuddered.
”So it looks like there have been some unnatural activities in downtown Dallas. I think we should go and check it out. Maybe it's Alastair. And if not, then there might still be some monster we could kill.”
“And so we meet again, Castiel,” he sneered. Cas was glaring at him, anger clearly visible in his eyes.
Ten minutes, and a very smug grin from Sam after he told him that he would sleep in Castiel’s room, later, the two were lying in bed, Cas on his side so that he wouldn’t hurt his wings, an arm wrapped around Dean’s waist.
“No. Yes. I- I don’t know.”
He knew that Sammy was just trying to keep him calm, to distract him and it would have worked if he hadn’t looked into the mirror and saw Cas. That secret-keeping jerk in the back of his Baby. Dean just focused on the road again, deciding that there was no use in starting an argument now.
“Don’t ask stupid questions,” he barked, averting his eyes and letting out a sigh. Sam looked up from his research, a questioning look on his face.
Dean’s eyes widened as he looked at Cas with shock.
“Okay, so, Cas, you think you can make out how many demons there are?” he asked looking back at the angel.
“Yes.”
, and immediately began wondering if the guy was deaf. He hadn't so much as acknowledged anything Dean had said so far, and was still just staring at him, almost in awe. It gave Dean goosebumps, and he instinctively wrapped his arms around himself.
“You what? And how do you three idiots propose to kill him?” He asked, eyeing them all up and down. “You’re two hunters and an angel with barely enough grace.” Dean rolled his eyes, as he looked anxiously towards the door. He pulled out his blood-covered angel blade showing it to the angel.
Sam looked between them before clearing his throat. “No, I don’t think so, thank you Castiel.”
“Yes, it’s in an old church museum only an hour from here. Look,” Sam said, turning his laptop so that the other two could have a better look at it.
“Dean? Be careful.” Sam said with a serious expression. Dean turned his head and nodded.
“Bullshit,” Dean exclaimed. Cas fixed him with an angry stare.
“Yeah. We already knew that you needed an angel blade but it also said here that only
“Do you actually want to be in a relationship with me?” The question caught Dean off guard, especially since the angel was always so direct and blunt, seeing him unsure was new for Dean. He still smiled softly and cupped Cas’ cheek.
“Do you maybe… want to spend the night here…?” Cas asked, blushing furiously. Dean smiled down at him before pulling him up and kissing him again.
“So get this, according to the lore, there is one thing that
him. He put it in the lock and opened the door.
The boys find a few things and Sam and Dean start to get suspicious...
“Yeah, sure. He’s already inside there Sammy. How are we supposed to do that, huh?” he snapped before turning to Castiel, “You got any ideas?” Cas shook his head, averting his eyes. Dean took a step closer to him, crossing his arms over his chest.
Dean thought,
after Dean had complained about his tiredness.
“Okay. I’ll be right back.” And so the two of them found themselves snuggled on Cas’s bed while doing research. When Sam entered the room to see what they were doing, he found them both asleep, his brother's arms wound around the angel protectively.
“I suppose it is. My apologies. I can assure you that it was necessary.”
So the next morning they ate a quick breakfast and then got on the road. The first three buildings turned out to be empty.
“Hey, baby bro. How’s it going?” He asked, completely oblivious to the demon standing in the room. It took a few seconds for Dean’s mind to kick in before he actually recognized the man.
The three men were sitting in the Impala, Sam obviously shotgun and Castiel in the back, looking bored out the window. He hadn’t really said much after Dean came back from the shower and to be honest, Dean didn't mind. He really didn’t like this guy. He was a stranger to him and it felt like he was constantly being watched. After some time on the road, and being watched through the review mirror for the fast few miles,  Dean finally spoke up.
Dean sighed. “No, I’m sorry Bobby. So what’s up?”
”Guys, we leave in five. We've got talk to local law enforcement before we can go and look at the buildings tomorrow,” came Sam's voice through the door. Dean groaned in frustration and let his head fall on Cas’ shoulder.
“No, it was gone when I got there. They said someone stole it last night. Did you find anything?” Without waiting for Sam to answer, Dean stood up and walked over to his bag, taking out the feather and handing it to Cas. “You know anything about this?”
fuck this up or you’re dead,” he warned the other hunter. Cas gritted his teeth before replying sarcastically.
It wasn't so much a decision to kiss him as it was a reflex, a logical outcome. Dean pressed his lips to Castiel's and it was as if Castiel expected it to happen, like he was waiting for it. Their eyes slid closed and Castiel's full lips were soft and pliant as they locked with Dean's. The kiss was gentle, almost innocent, their lips sticking slightly as Castiel pulled away. He hovered for a moment, only mere centimeters from Dean's face before pulling back a few more inches to look back up into Dean's eyes. All trace of humor or mocking was gone, Castiel's intense gaze was back, but changed...almost in awe. He tilted his head slightly to the side again before giving him another sideways smile, less intimidating than the others, his white and straight teeth showing slightly.
“Sam asked if this could be angel,” he said, gesturing towards the article.
The man jumped dramatically and turned in his chair, and suddenly, he was looking up at Dean with wide eyes...the bluest eyes he'd ever seen. His dark hair was sticking up all over his head and he had what had to have been at least a week's worth of stubble on his jaw in contrast to full, dusty pink lips. He had dark circles under his eyes and a dull pencil tucked behind his ear. His initial surprise faded quickly, and he narrowed his eyes at Dean and cocked his head to the side.
“Come in,” Dean growled. The door opened and Castiel stepped inside. At the sight of him, Dean’s eyes widened and his mouth went dry; he was standing there completely naked, a towel around his waist. His body was well defined, though tattoos littered the skin, all in deep-black ink. He stood there looking a bit shy but Dean could have imagined it because when he spoke his voice was as serious and cocky as it always was.
When they arrived at their destination, they parked a bit further away before Dean shut off the engine and exited the car. God, he needed to get out of that small space. He heard the other two doors squeak open as he walked to the trunk, opening the secret compartment in Baby.
“Dean… I don’t want to leave but before I met you I just lived in motels,” Cas said ashamed, “but if I remember correctly, you told me once that Sam and you live in a bunker and maybe… I don’t know… I could move in?” Cas was completely red by now, his pink cheeks a nice contrast to his dark roots. Dean reached out and crooked a finger under Cas’ chin, lifting it up until he was looking at Dean again.
They were back at the motel and Dean was even more confused than before.
“Okay, yeah, I think I remember reading something about it once.”
But before he could actually say anything Alastair came back from his momentary shock.
Alastair grinned evilly. “Handy, isn’t it? Made out of angel blades.”
Dean nodded and they got ready for bed. It was already 2 am but it’s not as if they weren’t used to sleeping only a few hours. The next morning they quickly got ready and left, determined to find the angel.
Sam decided to go and take a shower before he would conk out for the night. Dean stayed in Cas’ room, helping him clean up a bit since he couldn’t use the shower with the injuries or his busted wings.
?” Dean barked. The demon turned towards him, pressing him a bit more against the wall.
Dean knew bullshit when he saw it and Cas was clearly lying, and he didn’t hesitate to call him on it.
The boys briefly thought about splitting up so that they could work faster but soon dismissed that idea due to the previous experience they had with Alastair.
“Well, I've seen you. I've watched you.” Castiel shrugged and gave a dry laugh. “I've...researched you, I guess you could say.”
“So?” Castiel asked, raising an eyebrow. Dean was about to comment about him being rude but Bobby was faster.
“Yes, I have, though nobody who has seen an angel is still alive. Let alone would be in the possession of such a thing,” the blue-eyed man said. He seemed pretty sure of what he was saying which was weird to Dean but he just focused back on the road.
“He's welcome here anytime,” Castiel said softly as he handed Spock over to Dean, “so are you.”
Dean couldn’t see anything at first. The room was soaked in darkness. He couldn't make out anything and drew his gun just in case, but when his eyes started adjusting he could see a figure huddled on the bed, looking down.
Before anyone of them could do anything, he turned him back around and stabbed him in the stomach, another terrible sound filling the air. Cas was starting to lose blood and Dean could see him getting weaker and weaker with time passing.
! Mr. James Novak wasn't too hard on the eyes either!”
Alastair was standing now in front of Cas, one bony finger running slowly over Castiel’s cheek. His angel was trying to turn his head away but the force holding him in place was too strong. Dean glanced down at Castiel’s arm and saw that he was trying to get his angel blade into his hand, without any luck.
“Huh? Yeah… it’s just… I think I’ve heard about this before. I think what they are referring to here is the blood of an angel.” Dean’s mood brightened a bit.
“Hey, relax… we can take it slow and I
Charlie scrolled some more.
Dean nodded back and then entered his Baby, turning the engine on and waiting for his brother. They had only been driving for a few miles when his phone rang. He frowned as he pulled it out of his pocket before answering.
Dean parked the Impala at the edge of the forest and then he and Sam took a few weapons, mostly their guns and a knife each and made their way to the clearing. Sam was silent but he was glancing at Dean every few seconds.
“What is it Sam?” he asked annoyed.  Sam momentarily froze, probably hoping that he hadn’t been that obvious.
Dean met Castiel’s gaze, his eyes flitting back and forth over his stony features.
Dean arched an eyebrow after him. “What about you?”
The barn was dark and dusty, the only light coming from some of the busted windows. They looked at each other before slowly moving forward. Dean was about to look around a corner when Cas reached out and pulled him back against the wall they were crouching against.
“Calm down, Dean. I wasn’t blaming you. But how are we supposed to find him?”
Fuck.
A sudden thought crossed his mind and he didn’t like it. He looked at Cas, his good mood dropping a bit. Cas picked up on the change of mood and cocked his head to the side.
Charlie was a busy computer programmer with little to no free time outside of her work. Her one escape was the yearly Moondoor larping, a week-long event in the neighboring city. Charlie went full nerd for the entire week, buying completely into the fantasy world so wholly that she actually stayed in her “Queen” tent for the entirety of the week. She even slept in Medieval garb, for Chrissake. Dean was sure she probably even had a bedmaiden to place a pan of warm coals at her feet. No less than the best for the Queen of Moondoor.
A small smile tugged at the corners of Castiel's mouth. He nodded absentmindedly and took a few steps back toward Dean, stopping a little closer to him than necessary. Dean sucked in a breath, his green eyes cast down slightly into Castiel's blue ones. Castiel looked like he was studying Dean's face, his eyes wandering from Dean's eyes to his cheeks, the curve of his jaw, and finally his lips. Dean watched him, mesmerized, something like an invisible current pulling him to the mysterious man and he slowly leaned in closer, until they were breathing the same air, their noses practically touching.
“Because,” Cas said gritting his teeth, ”you don’t like Michael either. You never did, and before he cast me to earth I remember that you complained about him and that you only get to do boring tasks. Not only that but if heaven doesn’t care about me, then nobody would mind you helping me.” Cas tried to persuade him. Balthazar eyed him suspiciously for a bit before he sighed.
“I would like that very much,” Dean whispered before he kissed those tempting lips again. The kiss was more passionate than the other ones they had shared until then. Dean moaned into the kiss and brought his hand up, combing through the soft black and blue hair. Cas opened his mouth letting Dean’s tongue slip inside. Even though Dean really wanted to continue kissing Cas, pulled back with a grin.
Stupid fucking cat.
“Get the fuck away from him, you son of a bitch!” Dean tried to get free but he couldn't, that jerk was too strong. Sam tried the same but to no avail.
a way to kill him.” Both Cas and Dean looked up at him with wide eyes.
“Did you get yourself a boyfriend, Cassie? I’m impressed, he’s handsome.” Balthazar said as he looked Dean up and down. Cas just glared harder.
”Guys? I think I found something,” Cas called a few hours into their research. Both brothers looked up at the angel with curiosity.
“Yes, Cas?”
There was a sizzling as the demon started burning orange from the inside out before he crumbled to the floor, Cas standing behind him with angry eyes.
“I mean since I’ve known you, you never talked about something long-lasting. Always just for the night, nothing more so I have been wondering…” Cas tried to avert his eyes but Dean caught his gaze. The uncertainty in those blue eyes almost broke Dean’s heart. He understood Cas’ question and the concern but Dean wanted to try.
“What the hell?” Dean exclaimed once he made sure that the room was actually empty.
“Apparently not,” the younger Winchester said.
“Guys, I don’t want to ruin the family reunion, but we kind of have a situation here,” he interrupted, both angels only briefly looking at him.
“How do they appear to humans then?” Dean asked, trying to sound as annoyed as possible. Cas rolled his eyes, gritting his teeth a little. His eyes were filled with anger and Dean couldn’t suppress a little smirk at how easy it was for him to get the other man so irritated.
“Fine. I still want to gank him though.”
“I said I fixed it, didn’t say I did a good job…” Dean stood up and got the first aid kit and closed the door. He knelt in front of him again and pushed his chest back a bit so that he could look at the wound.
“I think I got him. At least I got an idea where he could be hiding. There was some kind of electric malfunction in a five-mile radius from the barn, probably when he zapped away, and another one about fifteen miles away, same radius. So...we just have to check out the places in that area, and then hopefully we’ve got him.”
“Huh. Maybe.” She didn't look convinced. “Shame what happened to Mr. Novak, though.”
Dean's mouth snapped shut and he narrowed his eyes at him in question. “How?”
”Cas?” he asked carefully but the man didn't lift his head. The hunter walked further into the room, gun still raised but there was still no movement. The light coming from the street was helping his eyes get used to the darkness and Dean slowly put his weapon away and walked in front of Cas. The angel still didn’t really move and Dean started to get a bit worried so he knelt down in front of him, catching those blue eyes with his. Cas looked beaten down, his face pale, at least that’s what it looked like in the dimly lit room.
Charlie shook her head. “No...James Novak lived there...five years ago? Six? I don't know. He was a writer.
“And what reason would that be? Huh?”
“Well...I mean you do hunt monsters and I didn’t want to be your next target.” Cas confessed.
“Gabriel?” Cas asked, baffled.
“I don’t know but we could try to exorcise him,” he suggested in that deep voice of his, that almost made Dean shudder.
“Relax, it’s okay.” Cas tried to reassure him. Dean just glared at him with anger in his eyes.
“This can’t be possible,” Cas mumbled, worrying his lip between his teeth.
When they looked back at Sam, he was looking at them with a fond smile.
Everybody turned to Cas who, after saying that, started blushing a bit.
“Guys, I think we found it,” he told them, pointing to the demons. Both Sam and Cas looked out to where Dean was indicating.
“Dude...that's creepy.”
“Well, since Michael cast you down to earth, he doesn’t really care what happens to you, as long as you don’t somehow endanger heaven. You’ve always been known to be the black sheep of the family, brother and, oh don’t look at me like that,” Balth said as he frowned at Cas who was looking rather angrily at him, “Anyway, Mike said that there should always be someone to make sure that you don’t do anything stupid.” He concluded with a grin.
“Yes, got you.” Sam smiled triumphantly at the screen.
“Sorry,” he grumbled and turned back towards the window, playing absentmindedly with his lip piercing.
“He was fine.” Dean sniffed, rubbing his nose with a wadded up piece of tissue.
The sidewalk seemed to stretch forever as Dean made his way to the open door, the house even less inviting up close as it had been from the road. His whole body was tense, his ears straining for any sounds or signs of the stupid cat. He had hoped the damn thing would just come back out on its own, maybe spooked by something inside the house. It would serve him right anyway, making Dean Winchester feel like a pansy like this, but he had no such luck. By the time he reached the bottom of the steps leading up to the porch, Spock still hadn't emerged from the dark abyss of the inside of the home.
“Oh, Dean, Dean, Dean. Don’t tell me that you care about him,” he mocked slowly making his way over, “How sweet of you. Love is always the best way to make the other suffer the most.” Dean struggled harder against the force, trying desperately to do something. To at least get one hand free but to no avail. The demon was just too strong.
. Let’s do something fun.” Dean whined against his boyfriend’s skin.
“And what do you propose we do?” Cas finally closed his book and turned his head, looking up at Dean with a smirk. Dean couldn’t resist and leaned down again, kissing those pretty, pink lips.
“Don’t you
Castiel stared at him expectantly.
“Son of a bitch!” Dean tossed the bowl of candy onto the couch and stepped out into the night, pulling the door closed behind him. He took off down the street in the direction of the old creepy house, his boots thudding loudly against the pavement. He had to stop just short of the dark house to catch his breath, doubled over with his hands on his knees as he panted dramatically. He looked up just in time to see the damn cat disappear into the open door of the house that Dean was sure had been closed earlier that day.
Dean took a sip from his black coffee, happy about the warm liquid.
“Shut up. I’m redoing this because it’s badly done and I don’t want you to die on me.” Dean said, focused on pouring some disinfection liquid onto the wound, feeling Cas tense up from the burning. Dean was impressed at how calm he stayed, compared to Sam when Dean had to stitch him back up.
.Sam walked up to the front porch but before Castiel could follow, Dean grabbed his arm, holding him back.
“Hello, boys. Good to see you again,” he said with a smug grin as he walked up to them. “Wouldn’t have thought I’d see you here, Castiel, but it’s a pleasant surprise.”
’ at his boyfriend who nodded grimly before focusing on the others. They both slowly stood up and tried to sneak up on the unsuspicious demon.
“Yes, well. I suppose the idea of agape is somewhat…superfluous. Can I ask you something else, Dean?”
” Dean frowned in confusion.
“Dean, kitchen, now,” Cas said firmly, standing up. Dean wanted to protest but when he saw the adamant look in Cas’ eyes he just huffed and followed Cas.
Dean had no idea how this happened but they were scoping out the place when that dick appeared out of nowhere and pinned all three of them to the wall; Sam and Dean against one, and Castiel against the opposite one. He was walking towards Cas, a smirk on his lips.
Castiel left the brothers alone, wanting to take a shower and then sleep for a bit. At least that’s what he told them anyway. Dean turned towards his younger brother.
“What do you mean-” Dean didn’t get finish his sentence because the front door was opened and he heard a deep, gravelly voice greeting Bobby.
“Don’t be a wuss,” Bobby grumbled.
about it,” Alastair said, almost sounding bored. Dean looked at the unconscious form of his brother, slumped against the wall. Apparently, while the demon was focused on Dean, Sam had been able to free himself and tried to sneak up on him.
“So, uh, I'm just gonna...take the cat, and I'll be going...”
Still nothing. Spock turned his attention back to the man once more, peering down at him from the monitor.
Dean scoffed as he sat down beside her. “Well, if the guy was a recluse then it's not all that strange that I never knew he lived there.”
In short, the house was creepy as fuck, and there was no way Dean Winchester was going inside. None. Uh uh.
“You see an attractive being across the room and you want to fornicate with them.”
Dean thought. Sammy always tried to be nice to everybody which you obviously couldn’t say for Dean. It was silent for a few moments, Cas and Dean looking intensely at each other and Dean had to admit that Castiel’s eyes looked beautiful...
After they had taken Cas’ blood, even though it wasn’t that much, Dean insisted that Cas didn’t do too much, which the angel wasn't a fan of.
“Thanks...though...I want to help you, I really do and I know that lying wasn’t the best idea but I didn’t know what else to do,” Cas said sincerely. Dean huffed.
“No, I don’t. I have never seen anything like it.”
Dean nodded. “Selfless love. But…that’s not even possible, is it? I mean…in Christian lore, supposedly the only person capable of agape is…God.”
“Ha ha ha...bite me.”
“An angel Samuel, a warrior of God.” Alastair told them, “and he has that angel blade with him that could kill me,” he added before there was a loud clink and when Dean looked at the source of the sound, he saw a silver dagger on the ground, right next to Cas. Alastair pulled Cas back from the wall and then slammed him against it, this time face first so that his back was exposed.
Dean was speechless. He had never experienced the angel quite so honest, so vulnerable about something.
“Do you believe in love at first sight?”
”I hate my brother right now,” he grumbled. Cas just hummed in agreement.
Cas took it and let his fingers run over it carefully, a look of sadness and nostalgia on his face. Cas was quiet for a bit before he said.
“What do you want?” He asked, a dangerous edge to his voice. Balthazar frowned at him.
“Hey, buddy...”
He hesitated at the wrought-iron gate at the front of the dilapidated property, taking in the crooked shutters, unmowed grass, crumbling sidewalk, and chipped paint on the front door. He'd never seen so much as a car in or out of the property, much less any sign of human life. Every once in awhile he thought he heard music playing from inside the house, creepy melodic classical tunes, but it was just as likely to have been his imagination.
“Hello, Castiel,” the man said with a sly smile. Cas lowered his weapon but continued to glare at him.
The cat looked over at him, clearly bored, but the man didn't turn to acknowledge him. Instead, he let out a disgusted noise and furiously crumpled the piece of paper he'd been working on, tossing it angrily to the floor before starting on a fresh new piece.
“Yes it could,” Cas answered, a still bit lost.
Alastair growled deep in his throat before he tried it again. When nothing happened, a sword appeared in his right hand. Gabe just smirked as an angel blade slipped out of his sleeve and fell into his hand. It looked like the same that was currently in Dean’s sleeve, the only difference was that Gabe’s wasn’t covered in Castiel’s blood.
He walked further into the room and started looking for anything unusual. He approached a bag that was placed on the bed. When he peered inside, he froze.
“Of course I’m right, and now let’s see if it says anything about how we have to use the blood once we got it.” Dean leaned up and captured his angel’s lips in a reassuring kiss.
“Hey,” Dean stood up and walked over to Cas, kneeling in front of him and cupping the angel’s face with his hand, “don’t say that. I’m sure that your blood will work just as fine. I think it has to mostly have a bit of grace, and you still have some. Though maybe we should get the blood in the next days so that when we face him, you’ll be at full strength again.” Dean smiled up at him. Cas looked at him for a few seconds before the corner of his lip twitched upwards.
There was no way one of them could go up against Alastair alone. Teamwork would be key here.
“Really?” he asked, looking over at Castiel who was as surprised as he was.
“I can’t make them out clearly but there are at least six on the outside, and maybe another four inside, plus Alastair,” Cas said, his expression looking concentrated.
Dean thought.
Castiel walked over to the desk and picked up Spock, tucking the black cat into the crook of his arm and cradling his head, rubbing behind his ear with a thumb. The cat purred loudly, his yellow eyes sliding closed with the contact.
“Wait, what?” Dean interrupted with confusion. “You can store that stuff?”
When he reached that point, he stopped briefly, looking at the two brothers.
The shorter man turned to them with a grin.
“Yes, but I got cast out from heaven...I had other views than Michael and so he cast me down to earth.” Cas explained as a sad expression crossed his features.
“Come here and I’ll tell you. I got a new case for you two,” Bobby told him before hanging up. Dean threw his phone into the glove compartment. Sam looked up from his tablet concerned.
“You’re right. But what are we supposed to do then? I don’t think it would be a good idea to turn back, I mean we are almost there anyway.” Sam shot Dean a glare.
“Oh...yeah I get that though,” Sam said and Dean could tell that he felt a bit bad about that. Dean decided to change the topic.
“What the hell, Bobby? You know we don’t work with others and especially not with punks,” he exclaimed, anger rising inside of him.
“Maybe...but maybe I’m wrong. I bet there would be something to freshen up my memory…” He said, Dean, already knew that he wanted money. Though Dean was really not in the mood to play. He looked around before he drew his jacket back, revealing the white gun in his holster.
“Yes...so maybe a day or two. My wings should be able to go back to their tattoo form in a day, hopefully, even if they’re still a bit busted.”
“So...any ideas?” he asked with a raised eyebrow. Sam walked up next to him, looking at all their weapons.
“Wha...what? I uh...do you want that shower gel or what?” He asked. Cas just nodded and then Dean turned around searching in his bag until he found the bottle and tossed it to Cas.
“That's...kind of beautiful.”
“I did.”
Sam shrugged. “I don’t know…” Dean shrugged out of his brothers grasp and walked to the table, taking the keys to Baby.
“Buddy, what, uh...”
“Uhh, sure. Look, man...”
“Hello, Sam. How’s it going?”
“Of course I want to be in a relationship with you. Why would you even ask?” Cas blushed and Dean was sure if it wasn’t the barrel of a gun, this adorable expression would be his death. It was too much to handle.
Castiel smiled and held up a finger. “So! It can be argued that all the different Greek definitions of love can actually be applied to people who have never developed an established relationship of any kind. You can, technically, feel all of these types of love for a person, without them ever knowing you exist. Which leads me to agape.”
worked. A grin spread on his face as he slowly looked up into beautiful blue eyes. Cas was just as baffled as he was but Dean could tell that he was happy too, his eyes shining brightly.
Sam and Dean try to find Cas...
, Dean thought sarcastically.
“Has anybody checked in, yesterday, about yea high, blue eyes, black hair, sensible shoes?” Dean asked, already exhausted. The desk clerk thought about his description for a bit.
“And you’ll be working with another hunter,” Bobby shot over his shoulder as he answered the door.
“Fucking hell, angel, so beautiful,” Dean breathed as he pulled away from those enticing lips. Dean looked at Cas and smirked; the angel underneath him was a panting mess, his hair sticking up in every direction, smiling lazily up at Dean.
“Even though I’d love to continue, I think we should rest. You’re still not completely healed and I spent the whole day driving around and speaking with motel managers.” Dean stood up, ready to make his way to his room when Cas’ slender fingers wrapped around his wrist. Dean looked back at the angel with a confused expression.
“Cas…” Dean began gently, “I have never talked about it ‘cause with our job it isn’t easy to have a partner. Let alone someone who is a hunter and understands this kind of lifestyle. But with you… it’s… it’s different. You know about this, about the job, and I have never felt about someone the way I feel about you.” He reached out and took the angels’ hand into his.
Alastair had a sick smile on his lips as he did it again, getting closer to the centre, where they connected with each other.
Finally Castiel breaks, a small smile creeping across his features. He turned to his desk and scribbled down a few more things before slapping the pencil down on the desk and turning back to Dean.
“Okay. I’ll be back in 30.” Sam said and then he was out the door. Dean smirked and stood up, walking behind Cas and wrapping his arms around the angel’s shoulder from behind.
“Dean I told you, I’m fine but if you’re so persistent, can I at least help research from here?” Cas asked hopefully. Dean thought about that for a moment before smiling.
“What do you wanna know?” Cas asked looking at Dean who sat down next to him on the bed.
“You kids may wanna avoid that creepy old house down the street...” he gave them a sly wink, “I think it's abandoned, but some sketchy things have been known to happen around there...”
“Come in, Sammy.” He said and only two seconds later Sam was standing in the small motel room.
When they finally arrived at the clearing Dean all but froze; the grass in the middle was burnt so much that it was completely flat and yellow. All the trees that were around it had fallen away from it, the trunks of the trees burnt at the bottom.
“Just...give him a chance...maybe he finds something…” he said hesitantly, running a hand through his long hair. He needed a haircut Dean thought. Dean gritted his teeth, trying to stay calm.
“I’ll be right back,” he said cheerfully and, with that, he was gone.
“Yeah but hey, look, he's fine. It was an accident. He got past me when I opened the door for some Trick-or-Treaters. Ended up in that creepy house down the road.”
They checked into the motel around 5 pm, Sam insisting that the couple should share a room and ’
Dean frowned at the page before dropping it to the floor. Whoever wrote it was obviously talented, the words inexplicably weighing heavily on his heart as he scanned the dark room once more for the stupid cat. As he made his way to the other end of the room, he saw a sliver of light through the other room, which appeared to be a kitchen. Just as the doorway came into view, he saw a flash of black go darting through it and into another room, making his heart beat out of his chest.
at the time of his death, about unrequited love between the narrator and a character the narrator had never met. Aw, that's sweet.”
Dean observed the whole conversation with a rather confused expression. He didn’t quite get why they should be looking at what Cas was doing in the first place.
Dean almost growled at himself.
“Night, Cas,” Dean whispered back, kissing the top of the angel’s hair before he closed his eyes and slowly fell asleep.
“Yes, he left a few years ago and nobody has seen him since.” Cas looked at Dean who was pretty close to him right now and Dean couldn’t help but notice how blue Castiel’s eyes were. Like a sea, Dean could drown in.
It had been a few days and the brothers and Cas had to spend the days talking with the local police officers and digging into the lore. It was one of those days when Sam said,
They spend the next few hours searching for motel rooms and spells but in the end, they didn’t find anything. Dean let out a frustrated huff as he closed the book.
“Cas?” Charlie cocked her head to the side. The action gave Dean a brief flashback to Castiel doing the same thing, and he smiled.
“Good, how is….tricking people? I’m still a bit angry that you killed my brother… about 100 times.” Sam said but there was no anger in his voice. Only joy and something else Dean couldn’t make out.
“Uh...I think it will take longer than if I had all my grace. Michael took some and stored it in a bottle. Not all but part of it and-”
“That was too easy,” Cas commented as he pulled his blade out of the lifeless body on the ground.
”Dean, I know you don't like this and neither do I. But it has to be done. If he hadn't been so focused on me last time, he would have hurt you. And even though we weren't together back then, I know that if something had happened I wouldn't have been able to live with that.
“Don’t you
That's it, guys, the end of our story. I want to thank the amazing artist
Dean took a deep breath and let it out, the music building to a loud crescendo as he finally stepped forward and placed a shaking hand on the man's shoulder.
He shook his head in an attempt to ban all of those thoughts away.
“Okay fine, be pissed as much as you want but we do need him.” Dean didn’t answer that and instead continued walking, stomping on branches and leaves, crushing them under his boots.
Alastair dropped the blade before he walked over to them, stopping in front of Sam.
Very carefully Dean leaned forward, not realizing what he was doing until soft, warm lips touched his. It was different from kissing a girl but not in a bad way and Dean found himself tangling his hands in the dark locks, deepening the kiss. He loved the feel of the piercing against his lips. It was a nice contrast to those gentle lips.
“How the hell am I supposed to know? I am as confused as you!”
It was Castiel.
The doorbell rang just as Dean sneezed again. He wiped his tender nose, grumbling to himself as he grabbed the candy bowl and made his way to the door.
Castiel Novak and Dean Winchester meet for the first time and they aren't quite fond of each other...
“What?” Dean asked, confused. Sam grinned at him.
Dean thought to himself as he cleared his throat.
“Why?” Cas’ eyes stayed on Dean, calming him further.
“Dean…relax. I don’t think confrontation is the best idea right now. He must have had a reason for not telling us.”
Dean laughed. “What would you know, you gay nerd-”
Dean stepped forward hesitantly, his feet shuffling almost silently along the paper-ridden hardwood. Either the man hadn't heard him, or he was too engrossed in his writing to notice. Dean cleared his throat, but the man's writing didn't cease, the muscles in his back rippling under his shirt as his hand flew over the paper.
The man stepped closer, holding out a hand to Dean's face. Dean wanted to drop back, even smack the guy's hand away, but he was frozen in place. His breath caught and eyes went wide as the man caressed his cheek gently, skimming a thumb along the stubble on his jaw and over the curve of his lips. Finally, he pulled his hand away, his frown deepening.
“Why are you helping me?” He asked quietly, not looking at Dean. Dean smiled as he packed away the things.
They decided to split up, Cas looking for that blade and Sam and Dean driving to the sighting. Dean drove them to the field an hour out of town, pissed and annoyed the whole time. He didn’t trust this Castiel guy at all but he kept his mouth shut because he didn’t want to start a scene. He would suck it up and do his job.
“Dean?”
“I’m gonna go now…” Cas said after a bit and turned around walking out of the room and back to his. Dean looked at the closed door for a few seconds before turning back around to his brother.
“Well...we got a call from Bobby who told us that about ten minutes before I called you there was a wave of supernatural energy at that place. Apparently, some local law-enforcement told him,” Sam informed him. Dean looked at his brother before he asked, mostly to see Castiel’s reaction.
alone,” he pointed at Cas, “don’t you
“The hell you don’t. You’ve worked with your fair share of people over the years and just because you don’t like how he looks doesn’t mean he can’t help you. So suck it up, because you
”So what? We all of us just waltz in there and hope for the best?”
Cas looked up and a small smile played at the corners of his lips. Cas leaned forward and kissed Dean softly.
Dean had just parked Baby in front of the fifth barn they had decided to pay a closer look to. He squinted at the building which was surrounded by fog and after a bit could make out two people standing near the door.
“Yeah. Died suddenly too, some kind of heart problem. Hold on, maybe I can find something about it online.” She plopped down on the couch and pulled out her phone. “I can't believe you never knew any of this. Jesus, Dean, when you move into a neighborhood you're supposed to actually...you know...move in.”
They stared at each other until Cas’ eyes flickered to Dean’s lips. It was just for a second before they were back up but Dean did notice and licked his lips subconsciously. The days Cas had been gone Dean had started to actually think about his feelings and what his constant observations about Cas could mean. He had come to the conclusion that he wanted to be with Cas, no matter what. Of course only if the angel wanted that too.
“Sure.”
“And?” He asked expectantly.
Dean looked at the body in front of him with rather wide eyes. It worked. The angel blades
“Seems like I’m gonna have to start with loverboy then,” He grinned and made his way over to Cas. Both squirmed, Dean in order to get free, and Cas trying to get as far away from the demon as he could. Alastair pulled a silver knife out of thin air and placed it on Cas’ cheekbone, slowly cutting in. The angel hissed in pain but didn’t dare move, in fear of making it worse.
“No, nothing. He either didn’t go to a motel, or he didn’t check-in and just zapped into a room, hoping it would be empty and-” Sam cut himself off as something popped up on his screen. He focused on it, typing wildly on the keyboard as he was muttering under his breath. ‘Come on, come on.’ Dean just watched his brother, not interrupting.
After that Dean helped Cas to take care of some smaller wounds. Cas even let Dean take care of his wings and help him bandage them. Though that had been more reluctant mostly cause Cas didn’t think they were pretty anymore. Dean had shut him up with peppering small kisses all over his face until he was smiling annoyed at Dean. Some time had passed and soon there was a knock on the door.
He asked himself.
He stood in a foyer, about six feet across, which turned into a hallway that extended to what looked like the far end of the house, under the stairs. The stairway began slightly to his left, another few feet from the door, and led up to a dark upper floor that Dean decided he was not going to investigate. He told himself it was because the stairs looked less than reliable.
“Yeah, you two do that, I’m gonna take a shower. Need anything else?” Cas asked casually.
“Hey! Don’t argue now. It won’t help. What do you say we go scoop out the place a bit?” he suggested. Dean sighed, relaxing a bit.
“What are you doing here, Balthazar?” He asked, his voice angry though, Dean could make out the slightest bit of confusion in it as well. Balthazar just smirked smugly as he took a step closer. Dean’s instincts kicked in and he stepped in front of Castiel protectively. The other man noticed and looked at him.
”Dean, are you okay?” Cas asked him that night in bed. Sometimes he hated how good his angel could read him. He sighed and looked down at the dark mop of hair on Cas head that was currently lying on top of Dean's chest.
“Cas, babe, you okay?” Dean asked in concern, ignoring the look he got from Sam at the moniker.
“I will.” And with that, he made his way to find the angel. He knocked on the door but nobody opened it. He knew that the room wasn’t empty though because he could hear rustling. Dean frowned and took out the key, the desk guy had
“Holy shit,” Dean breathed out as he stared around it walking more into the middle. Whatever did this must have had a lot of power. Sam stepped closer, taking everything in.
“Fine,” Dean mumbled, anger still clearly visible on his features. The three men walked back into the living room where Castiel was still standing, annoyance all over his face, arms crossed over his chest.
“Come on, Cas. I’m
“Your little friend over here is not who he says he is,” he began.
He loved when Cas played with his hair. It felt like he was important. Like he was needed.
“Heya, Spocky!” Charlie exclaimed, picking the bored cat up from Dean's chair and cuddling him obnoxiously to her chest. “I missed you so much! Was he a good boy?”
“Well our lovely Castiel lied to us.” Sam stood up and approached him just a bit.
“What the hell is
“Get the fuck away from him you sick bastard!” Dean exclaimed, his eyes fixed on the blood that was running down the tanned skin. Dean did notice that Cas had been fairly quiet the whole time, never saying anything which confused him a bit. Cas was normally the first to tell someone to fuck off.
“Whatever came here was very strong. Do you think it wanted to come here or was it forced to?”
“Sulfur,” he said, more to himself than to the Winchesters. Even though Dean didn’t know a lot about demons, he knew that they left behind sulfur.
“Damnit! Nothing. You got anything?” He asked hoping that maybe he’d found something. Sam shook his head.
“There were a few killings in Iowa, probably demons and I want you to look at the scene since you know so much about them and the boys will help you as well,” he gestured towards the Winchesters who just nodded.
Dean rolled his eyes at the snark. “Yeah, sure, then why is it bleeding?” Dean asked with a raised eyebrow. Cas looked annoyed down at him.
“Look at you, so concerned about him. I mean not as much as your brother but still…” He reached out and took Sam’s face between his fingers, forcing him to look at the monster. Dean growled deep in his chest.
Dean shrugged. “Eh. S'not so bad. A little beat up, maybe. But Cas seems nice enough, if not a little...odd.”
“Okay, we’ll rent a room next to yours and stay here until you’re ready to go again.” And that’s what they did; the brothers checked into the room next door, making sure the owner wouldn’t report them to the authorities.
With the big bad finally gone, they clean everything up before they can go back to their normal lives...
“Great, so it’s a demon, Let’s go then, we got everything,” he said, standing up quickly. He couldn’t stand being next to this jerk anymore.
“They possess humans-”
That night, Dean held Cas as close as possible, not wanting to ever let go of one of the most important people in his life.
“I know.” Cas had the same smirk on his lips.
“What’s up?” he asked.
“You two go. I’ll go to the museum and look for that angel blade,” he said. Dean knew it was an excuse the moment he heard it.
Dean just wanted to kiss him again.
“What the hell?” He mumbled as he grabbed his stomach, trying to stop the blood.
"See it?" He asked, pointing at the ocean.
"I really have to stop picking on the nerd angel." He muttered to himself, remembering his epic ass kicking from just last month.
"Cas, tell me, when you pulled me out… how long did it really take? How difficult was it? We've spent all this time together, but you have never told me about it." He asked.
"Yeah, Cas, I cleaned."
This is when he first notices the steely, almost otherworldly gaze.
"What do you want to do tomorrow? Since it's a Saturday and everything, I figured we could go out. Charlie mentioned that her band's playing a show in Portland. There could even be costumes?" He said hopefully.
The ground, where the earth had just opened its maw to swallow up his only remaining family, was still hot to the touch. A few feet away, the splattered remains of his guardian angel lay, and next to this fetid pile lay the body of his surrogate father, his neck twisted half away off his body, and his blank, lifeless eyes staring at the sky.
Later that day, Dean stared at his phone. He had texted Jo to tell her that he was about to make the call, in case he somehow lost it during the conversation and needed her support. Sam's number was open on the screen, a dopey picture of his younger brother smiled up at him. Dean had picked the photo for his caller ID photo because it was taken the last time he was home. Sam had been lucid, doing so well, and Dean wanted to remember it because he knew he wouldn't be coming home for a long time.
