“I’m not used to this.” The detective stated. “I’m not used to having somebody with me when I change.”
“Sounds like I should’ve let you scratch me, then. Another’s scar’s nothing; could do with the heightened senses, my hearing’s going a bit. Getting old I guess.” He said with a slight smile and chuckle, trying his best to be casual about it all but Sherlock wasn’t laughing. John took a breath in, clearing his throat awkwardly as he shuffled in his chair, reaching over to finish his tea.
It had been a few weeks since John had found himself thrust into this strange new world where werewolves existed. Sherlock, of course, had been just as difficult as ever while he recovered from his injuries, wanting to go out on cases while John had been firmly putting his foot down and refusing the detective such pleasures. The reason the doctor found himself in an argument currently was because Sherlock had received a text from Lestrade earlier that morning who was in desperate need of help on an apparent suicide case.
him – at least not in the way Sherlock needed. Sherlock needed somebody to help him see that he wasn’t a freak, that his mutation wasn’t all bad. He needed somebody to believe in him, to believe that he wasn’t a monster...
Sherlock frowned at John’s question. Of course it was him, John wouldn’t be this close to him if it wasn’t; his teeth would be around his neck. Sherlock met John’s eyes and gave a small nod.
John hurriedly held the phone up to his ear. “Mycroft! Oh thank God,” he breathed into the phone. “It’s Sherlock, I- I don’t know what’s wrong with him, he just-“
When John returned, heat pads and tea in hand, he was initially concerned to find Sherlock unconscious; wondering if something other than exhaustion has caused him to pass out. He put the tea and heat pads on Sherlock’s dresser and hurried to his side, taking his pulse. The doctor let out a sigh of relief when he felt the soft flutter through the detective’s wrist, signalling that he was in fact alive and would be fine. John stood still for a moment, examining him. He had tried to see Sherlock in the wolf, tried to see similarities between the different bodies. His eyes were the same, and his face, oddly, seemed to be similarly structured – apart from the thick muzzle. His fur had been the same dark colour of his hair as well, and for the most part, his personality unchanged. He could see the wolf in Sherlock, through the expression on his face; he always looked the same when he was asleep, for some reason. After Mycroft had shot him and the angry wolf side had subsided, he had been left with a sleeping Sherlock, even in his wolf form he could recognise that. He smiled a bit, brushing the curl’s out of Sherlock eyes, petting his hair like he’d done the wolf all those hours ago.
John clasped a hand over his mouth when he saw the wolf flinch, watching his ears twitch. He cut himself off immediately, taking in a breath and holding up his hands defensively. “I-I’m sorry.” he spoke in a much quieter tone as he watched Sherlock continue to lick his wound. He was disappointed not to receive an answer to his question at first, but that soon changed to worry. “Sherlock,” he repeated, frown deepening. He lifted a hand, about to reach out to Sherlock before he pulled it back, a sad expression on his face.
"No, you aren't. God, get your shirt off. I don't want you getting a heat stroke or something, there's no reason you should be this warm." he commented, beginning to go to the kitchen and pausing to turn back and open the window, despite his previous complaint. "My med kit's upstairs, I think it still has some medicine I can give you for the fever. Any other symptoms? Stomach ache, sore throat..." he called, opening the freezer and pulling a pack of frozen peas out for Sherlock's forehead.
John scrunched up his faced in confusion. “Me? What did I do?”
Finally, the muzzle was the last feature to shrink away and a sweaty, shaking and injured Sherlock was left on his hands and knees before collapsing to the floor exhausted and trembling.
Sherlock didn't understand any of this either, since when had it ever been this bad. He tried back tracking in his mind to see what could have caused the change, and then it hit him like a stone cold pavement. How could he have forgotten? How could
John sighed out as he shook his head, continuing to rub at his temples. “Wait, if you’re a werewolf, how come you aren’t... you know?” he questioned, pointing a finger at the unconscious wolf on the floor.
Okay let's just agree that I'm terrible at updating...

(See the end of the chapter for
The wolf had began to snarl and claw at its head, leaving deep gashes along its face and neck before continuing to bite at its arm, tearing a great chunk of flesh away, leaving a gory wound behind.
John sighed at the look he was receiving, leaning against the door frame he watched Sherlock stare at him. “What?” he asked after a minute of silence as he raised his eyebrows defensively. He thought it was difficult to read Sherlock at the best of times but this was even harder. The tail wagging and ear movements had been helpful in understand how Sherlock was feeling beforehand but now he was completely still. He couldn’t even tell if Sherlock was thinking at all. “Did I make you mad or something? Are you angry with me?”
John was suddenly wide awake, cringing at the sudden whines and screams, feeling incredibly light-headed again. It was terrifying, almost as upsetting as seeing his fellow soldiers die in Afghanistan. That, however, he’d had time to prepare for. This... this was impossible, shocking, and he wasn’t sure he could recover so easily.
Mycroft sighed out with a slow nod. “I best make myself comfortable then.”
“Just try not to draw attention to yourself, I’m already on my way.” And with that, the elder Holmes hung up.
“You still shouldn’t have to deal with this – you still shouldn’t have found out.” he repeated weakly.
Sherlock stopped pacing, his ears pricking up.
John bit his lip and sighed, plopping down on the couch, turning back to Sherlock. "Well lucky for you, I'll be home to take care of you tonight. Audrey cancelled." he muttered, glancing at his phone once again and tossing it on the coffee table with a sigh.
John’s eyes widened when he heard Sherlock’s exclamation. Glass of water forgotten, John hurried to his friend’s side to try and steady him.
The ex-army doctor stumbled back immediately, clutching the phone tightly in his hand, attempting to muffle the sound but it was already too late, the wolf’s head had shot up, staring straight ahead of him with golden eyes towards John as the black mass started to slowly stalk towards him.
“You don’t need to leave on full moons anymore, okay?” John spoke without hesitation.
Remember that comments/constructive criticism are greatly appreciated.
John flinched at the sound of the gunshot, momentarily thinking that the bullet had hit him, but the hard thud and snarl that followed soon after confirmed that it was in fact Sherlock that had been shot. The army doctor lifted his head slowly to see Mycroft Holmes standing at the entrance of the living room with a gun raised out in front of him, a mixture of concern and pity etched on the elder brother’s face.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s beside the point, you don’t understand.”
John frowned in confusion. “What was?”
Sherlock nodded slowly. “Yes, but it’s not the physical bite that changes you. The disease is passed through the saliva, if a werewolf scratches you are more than likely dead as a werewolf doesn’t just scratch but if you managed to get away with only some scratches you would be left with permanent scarring and you’d adopt a few ‘canine’ characteristics.”
have forgotten? That damn woman had distracted his mind; distracted him from his worst nightmare.
The doctor had forgotten all about the phone in his hand and held it up to his ear with a hushed whisper. “Mycroft, what the hell is going on?”
The words felt strange on the blonde’s tongue. He couldn’t believe he was talking about this seriously, describing two different beings inside Sherlock’s mind. The ‘wolf’ and of course Sherlock, the man he knew; the man he had lived with; the man he had grown to care for. “If you both really are separate and I can only guess that it took you a lot of effort to stop the wolf attacking me, why did you do it? Why didn’t you just let it get me? It certainly would have been easier.” He admitted - it wasn’t fair that Sherlock had had to put himself in harm’s way to protect him.
Sherlock dipped his head to look at his feet; John was right again - John was always right when it mattered the most. Sherlock gave a small nod before placing his muzzle under John’s chin and giving him a small nudge upwards.
, Sherlock. That’s okay.” John continued. “It isn’t supposed to be bad; you aren’t supposed to hate it. You can’t pretend like that part of you doesn’t exist – it does and frankly I think that’s amazing.”
John pinched the bridge of his nose as the door shut behind Mycroft, glancing back at Sherlock. Of course Mycroft wouldn’t stay. If there was one man who could show up and shoot his younger brother and leave as if nothing was out of sorts, it was Mycroft Holmes.
“What?” Sherlock panted lightly. “It’s far too warm...” he mumbled to himself as he opened it further, sticking his head out slightly in an attempt to cool himself down.
John let out a hysterical noise, some sort of mixture between a laugh and a cry. “What do you mean
“John!”
John let out a sob-like laugh, although he was not crying. “
“When I was younger my father used to send me out into the acres of grounds we owned, not to come back until I was human again.” He started, not making eye contact with John. “As I grew older and moved out Mycroft would take me to a nearby forest, and now Mycroft sends a car and I drive.”
The full moon hung like a great luminous pearl in the inky sky. Its light shone behind the clouds making them look like sheets of silver against the black bed of the sky. It had been a complete month since John had seen Sherlock turn into a werewolf before his eyes and now the detective was beginning to show the signs of another change.
“I almost killed you!” Sherlock finally snapped. The pair of them stared at each other before Sherlock broke eye contact to look at the floor by his feet. “You keep talking about how I’m hurt and how I should rest but you’re completely skipping the part where I almost killed you.” He said quietly after a long moment of silence.
“Help me, then.” John replied calmly, staring at the other man. “I can’t understand if you don’t tell me, Sherlock. Just give me a chance to understand, yeah?”
“Really Sherlock? Your brother came in here and shot you right in the back. How did he know it wasn’t going to be a through and through and hit your heart? Do you have any idea how scared I was?” he asked, his voice rising slightly at the careless attitude Sherlock was displaying towards his injuries. John sighed, scrubbing a hand over his face once more, knowing he had to calm down.
John frowned, dumbstruck by Mycroft’s instructions. “What? No. Mycroft can you not hear him, I can’t leave him like this.”
John stared at the other man’s face, trying to read him. He wished he was a brilliant as his companion, he could seemingly read minds just by a line on the face or the ways eyes were focused. He had no way of knowing what the detective was thinking or feeling. However John did noticed Sherlock’s grimace and watched the detective walk past him into the kitchen. “Did you really have to be that hard on yourself? Trying to tear yourself apart?”
“Don’t.” Mycroft warned. “Let the Wolfsbane do its job first.”
John narrowed his eyes at him in confusion. "No, I read it right. She’s found someone better, it seems. Didn't even bother to call, just sent a text. Third time that's happened to me this month." he grumbled, scrubbing a hand over his face, before frowning. “And since when have you cared about my love life?”
However John was interrupted by Sherlock who had trotted over beside him and had hauled himself up onto his hind legs to reach the cupboards that lined the top of the walls, giving his nose a good rummage through the cupboards, knocking some tins and packets out as he went.
As always, constructive criticism and feedback are appreciated greatly!
Sherlock had to admit: he’d never been petted before. The soft feeling of John’s hand running down the top of his head and down his neck was divine; eyes closing unconsciously and tail wagging; he wasn’t too sure if he should be enjoying it .
Something struck in Sherlock’s heart. Of course he wasn’t, he would never intentionally harm John. He slowly turned his head to look at him, everything was just wrong. This was why he was supposed to keep this a secret; this was why John was never supposed to know. Sherlock lowered his head as he slowly made his way back to his room, shutting the door quietly with his head.
The wolf’s head spun round and roared powerfully at John, teeth bared, ready to kill. John knew showing fear would make it worse. If this was truly Sherlock, he couldn’t allow him to hurt himself. However, yet again, the wolf began to shake its head in torment, fighting with itself internally. It wanted to attack; it wanted to kill the man in front of him but something inside was telling it to stop, to back down, telling it that this man was not to be touched.
He opened his mouth but nothing but a quiet, quick cry of fear made its way out. He wanted to scream, to call for help, he half expected Sherlock to burst through the door and shoot the beast, saving him, being the hero the detective never believed he was. However, John knew Sherlock wasn’t coming to save him; Sherlock was about to kill him, or eat him, or whatever the hell he wanted him dead for.
“John!” Sherlock yelled in panic as he ran towards the attacker only to be struck from behind as well. He stumbled forward, clutching the back of his head, looking for John ahead of him only to see him on the floor, clearly knocked out. “John,” he gasped as he scrambled drunkenly forward before another hit from the dark caused him to fall to the ground, the world around him started to blur and with one final blow the veil of unconsciousness swallowed him whole.
John drew his brows together and leaned slightly forward in his seat. "So you're telling me you didn't let me in on your plan because you think I am a blabbermouth?"
”John!” Sherlock was right above him now, his face inches from John’s. John arched his back before Sherlock could move away, and
He still thought about it sometimes even now. After 2 years had gone by. He didn’t think of it as often as he had done in the beginning though and he knew now he could make it. Even without Sherlock. It was hard and it took all his strength not to give up, but Mary gave his life meaning again. He could not run away anymore. He had to stay alive now. For Mary. He didn’t want her to feel the way he did and still does every day. He knows it won’t feel like this forever though. Someday this hurt will be gone and all there will be left is the memory of a life before Mary. A life with a man he had loved so much, a life without him was almost impossible. Almost.
He couldn’t see anything and his blood was rushing so loud that he couldn’t hear anything either.
John felt his heart rate speed up and his blood pump through his body in anger. He gritted his teeth and clenched his fists, but remained frozen to the spot.
“Sherlock!“, John rasped. He suddenly felt quite exposed and hoped the dark lighting would hide his embarrassement.
That’s what Sherlock had thought anyway. Before he met John. Because now he could understand. He could understand it very well even. All those women John wasted the time with dating. If Sherlock was an insensitive arse to everyone else, he took great joy in being an insufferable git to them even more. He just couldn’t stand them. They were all so offensive with their boring personalities. It was like they competed for the price of the dullest girlfriend. And John didn’t even seem to mind. He actually
It was raining when John finally arrived at the place that he visited every tuesday. Every tuesday since
“I‘ve met some one, Sherlock. Her name is Mary and I am gonna ask her to marry me. I know you don‘t think much of marriage and love in general. Sentiment is not an advantage, isn‘t that what you used to say? I know that now to be true, but I can’t survive alone. She could never replace you, I know that. But she can make me forget, at least for most of the time and if it hadn‘t been for her, I wouldn’t be here anymore. I wanted to follow you, you know. I would follow you anywhere. Even in death.“
John's brows drew together and he made to defend himself, but Sherlock interrupted him again.
him! Had gone so far as to kill for him! And that was how he was repayed?! By being bloody tied to his own bed?
~***~
Sherlock’s eyes snapped back to John’s, scanning the shorter man’s face for any sign of insincerity and finding none. Finally reassured, Sherlock let his happiness show, his eyes (while still completely black) now very bright and his mouth turned upwards in a proper smile.
Sherlock would be proven to be right. After their first Sunday spent in their bedroom, and afterwards on their sofa to watch crap telly, it started to become some sort of habit. Soon enough, every Sunday started to look like this.
«John ... Why would you think I don’t want you here? Certainly, we had some difficulties in the past few months, but I will always want you by my side-»
Sherlock said cheekily, as he took John’s hand and led their way to his bedroom.
"Well for starters I would like to know what the hell you were thinking. Jumping off that roof and then leaving us all thinking you were dead!" It was clear John tried to stay calm while saying that. It seemed like this issue was still a sore point for him. Sherlock could hardly blame him.
new Job! You
But his stupid, annoying, wonderful, perfect arse of a flatmate had chosen The Woman over him. Somehow the fact, that it was The Woman, of all people, made him very pissed.
John huffed. “What I want is to be freed of these ties right this instant!“
And there it was. The answer. He loved him. He, the great Sherlock Holmes, who took pride in calling himself a sociopath and thus distancing himself from any and all human feelings, loved John Watson with all his heart. What a great irony that was.
After having been prompted to breathe, John did just that. Rather loud and quick, but at least the purple from his face seemed to vanish with every gasp that came out of his mouth now.
John, I am a grown man, I hardly need your permission!"
”Just answer my question and I’ll let you come. I promise!” Sherlock’s voice was low and aimed at soothing. John didn’t trust his promise, after all this was Sherlock’s doing. He didn’t have a choice though, so he just nodded.
“I don’t care for Irene, John. And I can safely assure you, she doesn’t care for me either. As I‘ve told you before: Women are not my area!“
we were a couple you went above and beyond to correct them!»
John cleared his throat. It had gone all dry all of a sudden and he had to suppress the instinct of swallowing several times. Sherlock also seemed to be a bit nervous. His eyes were darting over everything but John and he seemed to be quite fidgety. Sherlock being twitchy was nothing new, considering he was an ex drug addict, who was on edge as soon as he felt even a little bit bored. Sherlock being twitchy because he was nervous though was something John would never have thought he‘d see.
It happened right after John had stepped out of the shower, dried himself off and put on his bathrobe.
As he thought about it, the stone was very much like Sherlock himself. Very neat and cold and so so beautiful. Those inky black curls against that flawless white skin... There were some big differences though, and I mean not Sherlock having been a human being and the stone being.. well.. a stone. But Sherlock having been so full of life, almost bursting with energy and always ready to go on adventures. Sometimes talking for hours on end. The stone was nothing like that. It was silent, calm and almost like it was resting.
you didn’t, but now ...
The young man looked up at that and for a second their eyes met, but then he looked away again and hid himself further behind the woman. Said woman smiled sweetly at John and pressed the button with the number four on it. John tried not to show his disappointment at the briefness of the eye contact. It was always like that. The man only ever looked at John for about three seconds before he found a way to politely ignore him. Whether it was by tapping rapidly on his phone or now by hiding behind the nice woman and studying his own shoes.
Sherlock scoffed. «Don’t be ridiculous John, of course I care about you! I would not have sacrificed my life for you the many times that I have, if I didn’t care. I thought that much was fairly obvious!» Surely John couldn’t be
Sherlock got up on a whim and grabbed John by the wrist to forcefully turn him around.
He made his way slowly over to the side once, careful as to not tread too heavily for fear of making the elevator drop.
Where it was old-fashioned and cold on the exterior, it kind of had a vibe similar to a Hotel once you were inside. Dim, yellow lamps cast a warm glow along beige/brownish walls and the corridors were laid out with soft, red carpets.
"So you think I’m gorgeous?“, the man asked.
"John!", Sherlock whined. It came out quite desperate, but he couldn't care less because John regarded him with the sweetest smile. It said
”I wonder if you’d be just as filthy if someone else was watching. Would you show them how horny it makes you to be watched? Would you be a little slut for them like you are now?”
"Right, uhm, do you need anything?“, it was a stupid question and John mentally prepared himself for yet another scathing remark. This one definitely deserved one anyway.
“Sounds like a usual Sunday afternoon to me“
flat.
“I guess we are both idiots now, hm?“
“For fuck‘s sake Sherlock, stop being so mysterious. If it‘s not Irene, then who is it? Because I can’t take it anymore. I can’t just delete my feelings for you and act like it’s all fine. It’s not, not for me. I can’t stand the thought of you being with some one else. I’m sorry Sherlock, but I ...“
Which was good because Sherlock really didn’t want to let him go. No matter how many fights they would have or that John might possibly be the end of Sherlock Holmes, he just couldn’t give up his friend and colleague. Not now, that he knew his love confession didn’t drive John away. He wouldn’t have to hide his feelings anymore and he wouldn’t have to be afraid of John leaving. John wanted to stay.
When the woman got off on the second floor there was no room for the tall man to go and John was glad that he could look at him proper now. The man was always remarkably dressed, which was no different today. He wore perfectly tailored suit trousers with a purple shirt, but no tie. The first three buttons of his shirt were undone, giving way to a pale long neck and a lovely set of collarbones.
Sherlock turned around to the Driver one last time to make sure the man had not just gotten the address wrong or simply took a small break before driving Sherlock to his planned destination. The driver didn’t even look at Sherlock though. Without a word of goodbye, the man headed off into the night. Mycroft had probably warned the driver of Sherlock possibly getting cold feet and ordering him to turn around and go home.
Sherlock crawled slowly onto the bed while talking to John, calling him names and making him impossibly more erect.
I'm sorry it took me this long to finish this, but I have been very stressed lately and I didn't have the strength to finish it until now. I hope you still enjoyed reading it though! If you did, please leave some Kudos and Comments. Thank you for reading! :)
«Hmm?» John nuzzled Sherlock’s neck.
"So, what did you want to talk about John?"
or your new flat or your
Almost.
“You’re dead!“
And fuck, if it didn’t turn him on to be watched by Sherlock right now.
John moaned at the deep baritone drifting towards him. He arched his back, giving Sherlock a perfect image of just
And that did it. That last thought broke all his barriers and tore down his resistance. His tears came streaming down his face and he started sobbing. He might have even screamed, but he wouldn’t remember.
Sherlock didn’t believe they could still be friends. If John left now, he would leave forever. And yet he didn’t have the strength in him to stop the doctor.
John squirmed a bit on the mattress. He knew this would make his erection seem even more prominent, but he couldn’t care less. Or rather he could, but he didn’t want to. He
So Sherlock had to make a decision here. He could still leave, John would never know he was actually alive and he would have a shot at a normal, domestic life with this mystery woman he clearly liked a lot. Or Sherlock could take the last step, finally reunite with John and they will continue their life at Baker Street as if nothing had happened. It wasn’t a tough decision to make. Sure, Sherlock would do everything to make John happy, even if it meant leaving him forever, but Sherlock just knew that he was the only one who could not only make John happy, but also make him feel every emotion there was. Let him experience a full life and give him everything he needed. After all, Sherlock was the one who knew John the best. Again, the limp proved that.
Sherlock snorted.
«I can’t do this anymore Sherlock. I don’t want to do this anymore!»
The detective seemed to have lost all control of his vocal chords. A gasp escaped his mouth which he found even more embarrassing than the whine.
"couldyoujustkeepholdingmeplease?“
Sherlock nodded again. He didn’t trust his voice at the moment.
“I know my appearance here is a little unexpected John, but you really don’t need to hold your breath!“, Sherlock said with a smile, that he hoped looked rather teasing than nervous.
No, Sherlock wasn‘t ready for any of that.
“Good Evening Sir! Do you have a reservation?“
John cleared his throat. “Hm? Oh, yeah, I’m fine! Yeah ... just ... fine!“ He still had that manic expression on and it seemed to get even worse, cause now the corner of his mouth began to twitch. “Isn’t it just great, that after two years of NOTHING, my best friend actually came back on the one day that for once was supposed to be not about him?!“ John had screamed the middle of that sentence and was now scooting back his chair roughly and moving to stand right in front of Sherlock. The restaurant has gone awfully quiet and Sherlock could feel hundreds of eyes following the scene right in the middle of it all.
John’s grin grew impossibly wider. He buried one hand in Sherlock’s curls, while the other still lightly stroked Sherlock’s cheek.
“Watson, hmmm ... let me just check. “ The young woman traced the names of all the Reservations with her finger and finally halted, then tapped one name on her list.
John had to fight the sudden urge of taking the man in his arms again and protecting him from all the harm that was lurking outside.
Later they would talk, Sherlock would tell John how and why exactly he had faked his own death, John would tell Sherlock that his girlfriend had broken up with him because she knew and they would say to each other everything they have wanted to say, but then never did. Later they would talk.
They had had a row, John and Sherlock. Sherlock doesn’t recall how it started. It might have had something to do with dangerous experiments or Sherlock’s disinterest in religious festivities and the like. Lately it was always something like that. Sherlock did his best to be enough for John, to not be a hindrance and make living with him as comfortable as possible. But in the end there would always be something Sherlock had missed and John would lose his temper. There was nothing Sherlock could do. He was walking on eggshells here.
John took another deep breath. He had never said that last bit out loud. He felt ashamed of having even thought that, but saying that out loud gave it power. It was the truth. After Sherlock had jumped, John wanted to kill himself. He hated that he was so weak, but he couldn’t help it.
Sherlock! How the fuck am I supposed to trust you, when you have me tied to my own bloody bed?!“
Neither of them said anything after that, they just stared at each other.
“Yes, I know that now. I was too hurt to see it though. I felt betrayed and alone, that‘s why I texted her back. I didn’t mean for anything to happen, but somehow it did.“
A cloud of smoke formed in front of Sherlock’s face. It might have been from the cold if it weren’t for the cigarette currently dangling from Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock couldn’t help thinking that John would not be happy seeing him having a smoke, what with being a doctor and all. Sherlock needed that cigarette though. He
«I DIDN’T KNOW YOU LOVED ME!», John burst out.
«I’m an idiot!», John whispered. «You were always trying your best to make me happy.» The doctor nuzzled into Sherlock’s neck again. He seemed to like it there.
’s into his neck, his shoulder, his throat, his cheeks, his temple and finally into his mouth.
I know!», John probably meant to sound complacent, but his relieved smile gave him away.
them, which was the most infuriating thing of it all.
“Very well Sir, what is his name?“
“Well John, I always knew your observational skills aren’t the best, but surely a man in the medical field should be able to tell the difference between a dead man and one that is very much alive.“, again the humour did nothing to take the awkward out of the situation. John did not smile or giggle or even show a hint of mirth. He just continued staring at Sherlock as if he didn’t believe what was happening. He probably didn’t.
He tried his best not to think about it. He tried when he first awoke the morning after and the flat was silent. He tried when he made tea just for himself for the first time in 3 years. He tried when he went shopping and didn‘t get a SMS about milk. He tried his best over and over again, but failed miserably. It seemed like that day was everything he could think about. It nagged on him in every nerve of his body. It made his throat burn, his eyes sting and his heart ache. How had he not seen it coming.
"Well no, obviously I’m not alright!“, The man snapped.
John took a deep breath and looked at Sherlock. The detective was already turned towards him and there was a hesitant smile playing around his lips. John heaved a relieved sigh and started to giggle. This was all so fucking absurd. They had full out snogged each other senseless in front of their friends, putting on quite a show. John, officially not so straight, Watson and Sherlock, not always married to his Work, Holmes. What a pair they made. Oh well, only God knows what the future would bring, if they worked out as a couple, if Sherlock even wanted to be in a relationship and if they wanted to keep it private or make it official. But for now, John was content with just being allowed to finally touch Sherlock. As a matter of fact, he would continue doing that right now. Everything else could be dealt with later. Today it was just them, John and Sherlock, the blogger and the detective. Lovers.
"I should probably leave now!“, John said, not moving an inch.
“Okay I reckon this must be a bit much to take in right now and you are probably confused. I will explain everything once we’re back at Baker Street and can have a proper chat, but for now the most important thing is“ Sherlock glanced at the floor, then took a deep breath. He fixed his eyes on John’s once again and continued:
The best proof could be found at his line of work. Love had always been a vicious motivator. The most murders were caused by an act of Love.
... »
John took a step forward, pointed at Sherlock and was just about to threaten him with binning all his experiments, if he didn't grow up already and behave like a normal human being, when Greg suddenly called out to them.
John also didn’t bother asking Sherlock whether he wanted some tea. He just put on the kettle and made two mugs of hot tea with milk, one with sugar.
“Do you love her?“ John looked straight into Sherlock’s eyes, warning him not to lie.
It took them just a few seconds to reach the fourth floor and before they knew what was happening, the elevator stopped and a high
So this was the reason why all their friends had reacted so weird, when John and Sherlock had entered the room again. It was because they both had been standing (and as a matter of fact still were) right under a mistletoe. Their friends surely didn't suspect them to really kiss, did they? It would be too ridiculous to even imagine and besides, Sherlock and John were not that sort of friends. And their guests knew that. Sure, there had been quite some jokes concerning both men and various intimate scenarios that John really did not want to think about right now, but they were just that. Jokes! Nothing serious! Right?
They had to break their kiss to come up for air, which had been totally neglected from when the innocent press of lips had turned into so much more.
"Thank you, he rasped.“ "And no!“
The tears that had threatened to come during the whole conversation now decided to fall freely. Sherlock let them.
Sherlock didn’t mind. He knew when he woke up, John would be there. Smiling and fondly calling him an idiot. If he had that, all was going to be alright. They would sort it out. After all, they always have. And they always will. Because they were John and Sherlock and that was that.
"You don't need to be embarrassed Sherlock, you look lovely like this!" John grinned and placed his hand on Sherlock's heated face.
By unspoken mutual agreement, they both leaned forward at the same time, until they were only inches apart. John could feel Sherlock's breath ghosting over his mouth, moist and warm. John closed his eyes. Their noses were touching now, there was no turning back. This was it. John would have to kiss Sherlock. Deep down John always knew that he had been attracted to his flatmate and best friend for quite some time, but there was no point in pursuing his feelings because Sherlock just wasn't interested. In anything of that sort. So John just always kept a tight lid on his emotions and continued to be happy just being Sherlock's friend.
«God yes!» John exclaimed, drawing his friend into his arms and smiling into his skin. He breathed more
John took a deep breath and cleared his throat. He opened his mouth, closed it again, opened it. “Come on Watson, you‘re a soldier. You invaded Afghanistan. You can do this! How hard can it be? He won‘t hear you anyway.“
“Appears so“ Sherlock said, smirking back at John.
Although Sherlock had wanted to say something along the same lines, it still hurt to hear them be directed at him.
"Oh, great, thanks!“
"Of course John! Do come in!"
John got up from his chair and made to leave.
«Don’t look at me like that! I know you’re not a sociopath, I’m a doctor after all! But I didn’t think you would care about
Sherlock let his eyes roam over the young Maitre D‘ behind the podium. Somewhere between late twenties and early thirties, daughter of the Hotel owner, does not like her Job, but needs the money to pay for a private arts school. Has two cats and just broke up with her boyfriend due to unfaithfulness. On her side, not his.
Sherlock smiled to himself and closed the door to the room that had functioned as his hiding place for the last few weeks, when he still had to recover from his so called "excursion" to the east.
"I’d love to!“
desperate John was.
“I‘m so sorry Sherlock! All I‘ve said that upset you. Everything I did that annoyed you. I wish I could take it all back. Calling you a machine, yelling at you for ruining my jumpers. I didn‘t mean any of it.“
"I said, could-you-just-keep-holding-me-please!“ He sounded annoyed and a bit irritated, as if John was being deliberately obtuse.
John had apologized after every fight already, but it never felt as sincere as it did now. John really didn’t want to leave.
At the first contact of their lips, Sherlock stayed infuriatingly still, but then he shrugged himself out of his stupor and began to kiss back. Tentatively at first, but gradually becoming more aggressive.
"Do you want something to drink? Tea?", he asked, already busying himself with the tea bags.
Maybe it wasn’t that much of an extraordinary Sunday after all.
Maybe John was going crazy, but he felt like Sherlock could hear him. When he touched the stone, he imagined Sherlock could feel him. He wanted this to be true. He needed it to be true. Maybe he was going crazy, but he knew if he would stay rational, he would not be able to survive. To think his best friend was gone, the man he owed so much, was gone and would never be coming back.. John could not stand that thought.
The man was silent for a while and just as John thought he might never get an answer, the stranger finally said: “could you just...“, he cleared his throat, swallowing a few times before continuing.
"Do you want to get that coffee now? There’s this little café right around the corner and it shouldn’t be too crowded at this hour!“
and that seemed to do it. John deepened the kiss and Sherlock all but lost himself in it. When their tongues met they both moaned. Sherlock would have been embarrassed with the noises he made, but he was way to absorbed in the feeling of John. John's lips that were nibbling and biting on Sherlock's lips, John's hands that were drawing Sherlock impossibly closer and John's body pressing unyieldingly into Sherlock.
"Look, don‘t get me wrong, I really am glad that you‘re back, but I don‘t think this is ... You know a lot has changed since you-"
Sherlock took one last drag of his cigarette and then made his way back up to the flat. His steps were heavy with the decision he had just made.
! But he had made it through the past two years without John and he would just continue his life until he didn’t have to miss him anymore. He just hoped that day would actually come.
your death! Two years Sherlock! And then you come bouncing back as if nothing had happened. You don't give me an explanation or a reason, just tell me you're not dead and then you fucking leave me again! FOR FUCK'S SAKE SHERLOCK!"
daft, could he?
There was a long pause. Sherlock averted his gaze and stared at the wall ahead of him, ignoring John’s stern eyes that currently seemed to bore holes into his face.
”, John gasped. He was close to sobbing. This wasn’t a game anymore, this was torture!
After a while of listening to John’s steady heartbeat, Sherlock could feel his eyes droop, his mind drifting off further into the comfortable embrace of the impending sleep.
«Hey, Sherlock, look at me! What’s happening in that great brain of yours?»
«And you ... love me?»
Of course if John would equal Sherlock in intelligence and perceptiveness, the Reservation could have been made by John for John and himself. But Sherlock knew that John was clueless about Sherlock’s state. Thus the limp.
Oh what a glorious feeling that was! Sherlock couldn’t stop the little grin that was forcing its way up the corners of his mouth.
Before John could think anything else though, Sherlock’s hand had landed on John’s neck and used just a little bit of pressure, to signal for John to lean his head onto his shoulder. They both slowly drew closer to one another, until they were fully embraced in each other’s arms.
John appeared in the door frame, red faced and a bit flustered because of Greg's comment. Sherlock stood right behind him. Upon seeing them, Greg let out a guffaw while simultaneously choking on his wine. The other guests also regarded the pair with either wide eyes or a smirk or in Molly's case a curious blush. "What?", John asked. He was regarding his friends with a desperate look for help, but they just continued to stare at them. Greg finally seemed to pull himself together and pointed at something above and behind John's head through his laughter. John just frowned in confusion and was about to request his friends to just cut the crap and tell him what the bloody hell was going on. He didn't get that far though because Sherlock suddenly gave out a put upon sigh. John turned around to face him and then saw what Sherlock had just discovered himself. Right above their heads on the kitchen doorframe hung a small green sprig with a red bow. John hadn't really noticed it before, probably just thinking it was part of the Christmas decoration that Mrs Hudson had bathed the apartment in, but now for the first time really looking at it, John had no doubts about what he knew it was. And as it seemed no other person in this room did either.
John looked up at Sherlock with what could only be described as a hesitant smile.
Currently Sherlock was licking at John's lips, asking for entrance. John had to smile again, but willingly let Sherlock invade his mouth with his over-zealous tongue. Their tongues stroked in an obscene manner and John's amusement over Sherlock's inexperience quickly turned into raging arousal. John couldn't stop a choked off moan.
«Woah, now hang on a minute,» John tugged on Sherlock’s arm to face him. Once that was managed, he continued talking. «I never said any of that!»
, “How...?-“
But he wasn't going to do that. He had made the first move by telling John that he was back and very much liked for him to be his best friend again. For them to be
Sherlock looked at John as if he had been slapped. Why was John angry all of a sudden? He thought all had been well. John had understood the necessity of keeping the death a secret and he
Or so Sherlock thought. Which was why the detective found himself totally off guard at the sight of one "John Watson" standing in front of his door.
“I did meet with her John, but it was different than you think. She had started texting me after you got married. At first I ignored her, as I had always done. But I was so lonely John. Every one around me seemed to have some one and I, well I used to have you, but ...“
John was vaguely aware that Sherlock had asked him a question to which he expected an answer, but honestly John couldn’t care less. All that mattered was that he had to get off. He was certain he might actually explode otherwise and really, that wouldn’t be fun at all.
It must have been quite a few minutes until Sherlock finally calmed somewhat. John still held him in a tight embrace. when Sherlock’s shaking had abided and there were no more tears left, John didn’t let go. When Sherlock started to feel self conscious and tried to wriggle out of John’s grasp, John just held on tighter.
me John!"
Sherlock hated that smile. And he hated whoever it was directed at. And he hated that sour aftertaste it left in his mouth when he saw the effect that smile had on the women.
"Yeah!“, Mr Gorgeous nodded.
"Sure!"
John’s breath hitched. He could feel his cock twitching before he had given it the permisson to and Sherlock’s eyes were back on it lightening fast. They stayed there for a while, whatching John’s hips move in tight circles, a droplet of pre-cum forming on the tip.
John tensed up. He didn’t want to talk about her anymore. He didn’t want to hear, that Sherlock had fallen in love. That she was the one for him and that she made him happier than anyone ever could. He didn’t want to hear that Sherlock would leave him to be with her. He didn’t want to hear that.
It was this that finally seemed to turn a switch in John’s head. With three quick strides he was suddenly standing right in front of his flatmate, looking shocked and if Sherlock saw correctly, quite stricken. He was biting his lip, trying to find a way to be of comfort for his friend while still leaving him at arm's length. He gave up on that second part when Sherlock started shake. He didn’t quite ‘sob‘, it was more like mutely crying, but it was enough for John to forget that he had been just about to leave, and instead pull Sherlock into a tight embrace.
Sherlock held onto John's body for dear life. He had the strange feeling that his legs would give out if he let go now.
«That I love you, you git!»
Mycroft had tried calling him that very day and a couple of times after that, but Sherlock had just turned off his phone. He didn‘t want to deal with his Brother and the "I told you so's" that would undoubtedly make an appearance in their conversation. Sherlock wasn‘t ready for that. He also wasn‘t ready for the pity that Mrs Hudson or Lestrade would try to hide, but nevertheless regard him with. They would probably go out their way to be overly careful with him, so if not to remind him of his broken heart and the person responsible for it.
«Yes.», John didn’t seem to be at ease with his decision, if anything he seemed to be more conflicted and quite a deal more tired.
Sherlock also had a feeling that this woman was no stranger to dangerous situations. No innocent naive nurse at all then. She seemed to be a contradiction in herself, just like John. And as far as Sherlock could tell, they got along really well. Sherlock tried not to feel hurt by this. He wished John all his happiness and if John was happy because he had found a woman who loved him as much as Sherlock did and who John actually loved back, then who was Sherlock to stand in their way.
sit in it, that had been the only time that Sherlock had acknowledged his brother. Sherlock had simply glared at the government official and then continued to ignore everything the latter had said.
Sherlock drew in a harsh breath, before fully laying down on John, using his whole weight to bodily pin him to the bed. John gave out an embarrassing whine at the restraint.
announced, that the doors would now open.
He didn‘t want to think about the fall today. He came to Sherlock’s grave to talk to him. To tell him something. His right hand clenched and unclenched as he looked at his own reflection in that black stone. He looked awful, leaning onto his cane, big black bags under his eyes, crinkles on his pale face. He looked so old.
Sherlock felt his eyes take on the physical form of saucers. He blinked a few times, trying to make out if this was a dream or some sort of hallucination. Did he take any drugs after their initial fight? He suddenly couldn’t remember.
"Yes, probably!
Of course John would never be satisfied with this so-called substitute, but he started to think Sherlock was really there. Somewhere in this stone, hidden to eyes that see, but do not observe.
Therefore he visited Sherlock’s grave every Tuesday. It was the only day he was able to get off from work and he needed this day to be alone. To allow himself not to ignore his thoughts about that day. About Sherlock being gone. About never being able to be completely happy again. He needed to feel Sherlock’s presence at least for these Tuesdays. He wouldn’t often talk when he visited. Sometimes he would just touch the engraving in that highly polished cold black marble stone.
John closed his eyes. If he couldn’t free himself from this situation (which he knew he couldn’t - Sherlock was a smart man after all), he at least wouldn’t give this Sociopath the satisfaction of seeing the hurt and anger in John’s eyes.
Mycroft's car already waited outside, when Sherlock finally made his way down the stairs. Without another look back, he stepped into the car and told the man behind the wheel to drive off. He didn’t need to give the man any directions. Mycroft had already told him where to go and so Sherlock just leaned back in his seat und watched the landscape pass him by.
John tried not to be too eager, once he spotted the beautiful black curls behind a short, but remarkably big woman on the elevator.
Suddenly the elevator alarm went off and John finally realised, that he was still standing on the threshold of the elevator. Blocking the doors and preventing them from closing.
Just as he opened the bathroom door, he heard it. That one sound he dreaded the most. Other people might have laughed or gotten embarrassed by it, but not he. No, he was furious. He was furious because he knew what it meant. It wasn’t just a sound. It was an indication of what had happened or might happen soon. It was the indication that Sherlock did have feelings. Feelings for some one else.
John must have felt the changing of the mood in the room, for he had calmed somewhat and was regarding Sherlock with a strange expression. Almost as if to ...
«Sorry!», John said into Sherlock’s skin, not moving an inch.
John still didn’t move until he finally asked:
The car had parked right in front of a fancy hotel that Sherlock remembered having once visited on a case with John about poisened food.
Sherlock huffed. «So you’re saying what exactly?»
"Jesus I just...", John broke off, then shook his head. There was a small pause before he started talking again.
It hurt to think it, but Sherlock might possibly never return to those days. He just had to face that John and Sherlock - the Detective and his Blogger, was not a thing anymore. They weren’t the unbreakable union they once had been.
-) sort about his flatmate to surface.
The consequences of that were that he was starting to run out of stuff though. He didn't have much to eat in the flat and he had used last of the milk two days ago. He didn't mind. He wasn't eating much anyway and even tea wasn't the same anymore. Now everything just tasted
“Oh John, do observe for once!“. The taller man rolled his eyes, then strode towards the foot of the bed where he towered over his friend.
", John asked in disbelieve.
With the lights back on he was finally able to see the other's face, and what he saw astonished him.
The driver didn’t stop at Baker Street. Sherlock noticed this only when he realized they had halted at a whole different part of London. It didn’t happen often that Sherlock Holmes got confused, but he had been stuck in his mind palace for most of the car ride and had not been focussing on his sorroundings at all. He had been ensconsed in plotting a scheme of how to surprise John. It would be a surprise for him, no doubt about that! John thought Sherlock had died that day he threw himself off the roof of St. Barts. And even though John was pretty damn smart, Sherlock was confident that John would not have figured out that it had all just been a clever trick.
John was right, it would have been better if he had gotten to see him without the wolf controlling his every move. “That’s true but it’s not in a werewolf’s nature to go telling people about their condition, you don’t know who you might be telling it to.” He spoke.
Sherlock shook his head. “They’ll only melt.” He grumbled through a heavy breath. Sherlock felt a small spasm in his arm causing him to wince under his breath. It had started. “John?” he gasped. “John, when it starts I don’t want- argh!” he startled, surprised by the painful shot up his back.
John’s eyes widened in surprise when the wolf bit itself, almost feeling a surge of pity behind his fear. He took the sudden opportunity to scramble over behind Sherlock’s chair, since the wolf was blocking the exit. There was nothing else he could do; his gun was upstairs, no... he couldn’t kill Sherlock, even if Sherlock wanted to kill him. What if this was Sherlock? Or maybe Sherlock was gone... John shook his head clear of his thoughts; he didn’t have time to dwell on the idea.
“You shouldn’t have to deal with this...” Sherlock continued. “You shouldn’t have found out.”
“Just you and me, big guy.” he mumbled at the wolf’s still form, grabbing the banister for support as he climbed the stairs to his bedroom. Part of him was exhausted and wanted to collapse on his bed and pretend none of this ever happened. He wouldn’t be surprised if it was all some crazy dream.
“Look at me.” John asked, rounding on him. “There is something to explain. You said so yourself, ‘that’s beside the point’. You told me I wouldn’t understand. I need to understand what’s going on with you Sherlock right now, it’s important.” he demanded, grabbing hold on Sherlock’s uninjured arm to stop him walking any further.
“I need the cases.” He asserted, ignoring John’s comment about the pain. “I can say I was injured on a private case, usually works.”
Sherlock rose from his chair with a grimace to go and put John’s mug in the sink. “If I had been, I wouldn’t be here.” he lied.
“John please, I’m trying to protect you!” he urged.
“You’re not going to hurt me.” John answered with complete certainty, looking Sherlock over, a melancholy expression on his face as he dropped his hold on Sherlock.
Sherlock had thanked John as the doctor finished stitching up his back and arm and wrapped both wounds in tight gauze. The atmosphere between the pair had been awkward after that, of course it was, Sherlock had just turned into a wolf in front of John’s eyes. John was still in shock and Sherlock could tell the ex-army officer had an almighty list of question buzzing around his head.
“I bared my teeth at you. I frightened you.”
“It was wrong of me...”
The detective’s pulse was fast but not dangerously fast, John suspected it was just the adrenaline rushing through Sherlock’s body so he wasn’t too concerned on that front. However Sherlock’s breathing was another matter- it was ragged, wheezy and whiney interspersed with trembles of his body. He had never known the detective to be asthmatic but if he had been, John might have misdiagnosed it as a minor asthma attack.
“Sherlock, if this splits there won’t be anything that we can do. It’ll hurt like hell and I can’t do anything when you’re a bloody wolf, I’ll be useless!” John countered. He squeezed the bridge of his nose, shaking his head and taking a moment to compose himself.
The doctor looked away from him, focusing now on the injury of the detective’s back deeming the wound on his arm as clean as it was going to get. “You’re going to be fine.” John started, changing the subject. “I’ve seen worse, we can get you to the hospital-”
Sherlock held his arm out with a grunt, teeth clenched tightly in pain as his body twitched painfully.
Without further thought, John strode quickly over towards Sherlock’s door only hesitating as his hand hovered over the door handle. Sherlock had wanted his privacy last night but John couldn’t stand the thought of him suffering on his own; especially after their falling out last night. The doctor gently pushed down on the door handle and opened it a fraction.
, for you to understand and control your urges. It ruins people’s lives, John. I couldn’t let that happen to you.”
“You’d prefer your meat rarer, your sense might become slightly heightened, that kind of things.”
His heart was pounding in his chest but he knew there was nothing he could do but sit and wait. It had been a long time since he’d felt this useless.
“What the hell am I suppose to do Mycroft?”
John scratched the back of his neck. “To be honest, I don’t know. I mean, it isn’t as if you’d have a reason to lie about something like that. And knowing you, you wouldn’t exactly joke about it either. I’d probably think you were on drugs again or gone mad or something, but I guess I would have believed you eventually.” He responded. “Then again, I’m almost not surprised. Never really thought you could just be an ordinary human. When I think about it, it sort of makes sense. I mean, you do use your nose a lot; you’re unusually protective, bordering on territorial about certain things. If I had believed it was possible, I don’t think I would have missed it so easily. I mean you could have always shown me, too. Pretty bad night to watch you change, hm? Anniversary or whatever. I’m sure you aren’t even half as bad when your minds’ still all there.”
Sherlock was suddenly aware that he had been staring for quite to long without saying anything. He slowly let his gaze drag up John’s face until he finally reached his eyes. John’s full attention was on Sherlock now, probably had been since Sherlock had faced him. There was a mixture of shock and confusion in John’s eyes and the way his brows furrowed. John’s mouth hung open in a silent “o“ and he seemed to have forgotten to breathe altogether. Sherlock asserted all this in 0.86 seconds.
“Yes, that was a Message from Miss Adler“
now he is not alone in his bedroom. Someone
He heard a loud gasp from behind him and knew John was about to call after him, but whatever he was going to say, it was drowned out by the people in the entryway and the cars on the street as Sherlock opened the door and made his exit.
"Yes! Okay! I will go out with you!“
Maybe it was the images of the events that were just too much for him. Of course, John had PTSD, he was bound to be suffering when he was confronted with trauma. And even the presence of Sherlock seemed to be trigger already for John to be reliving that moment over and over again when his friend had committed suicide right in front of him. Even if it all had been a ruse, the experience must have felt very real and probably still was in John’s mind. Sherlock wouldn’t be able to change that with an explanation right now. Maybe not ever.
Sherlock was his best friend and yet he hadn‘t known he wanted to end his life.
John drew slow, circular motions on Sherlock’s back, making comforting noises and waiting for Sherlock’s breaths to come even.
Sherlock’s breathing was coming rapidly now, but so was his. He could feel each and every hair on his body stand up in anticipation. Part of him was afraid of what was going to happen, the other part, the forbidden part that John had so carefully been trying to hide was secretely excited. It had been so long that he had allowed a thought of a more romantic (and who was he kidding,
"Shit, sorry you aren’t taken are you? I mean you probably are, just look at you!“ John made a vague motion towards his companion.
It was better this way! John could finally be happy now and Sherlock would just go back to his life before John. He would be able to focus fully on his work again and wasn’t that uplifting! But Sherlock knew he couldn’t lie to himself. He would miss John terribly and the first months would be
After a few minutes he had finally calmed down enough to see that his eyes had somehow adapted to the darkness and he was able to make out the stranger’s form, which was pressed up on the wall at the other side of the elevator. Wait, was he trembling?
«I know, I’m sorry!», John apologized for the umpteenth time. It felt like he was trying to apologize for all the fights they had had in the past couple of months and especially for the nasty ones in the past couple of weeks.
His cock was fully erect now, twitching every now and then and his hips thrust uncontrollably into air, unsuccessfully seeking friction.
They were both panting, when their eyes finally locked, pupils blown from want, cheeks flushed and lips swollen from kissing.
He did see though, that Sherlock startled, even just a little bit, but it was indication enough. He probably felt guilty, because he knew how John felt about him. Of course he knew, even ordinary people could see it, so Sherlock must have had to be blind, not to pick up on it too. Here John was, madly in love with his flatmate, while Sherlock didn’t even feel remotely close to how he felt. That had been established on their very first day at Angelo‘s, when Sherlock had turned him down.
him. Oh God! Sherlock's pupils weren't dilated, were they? And Sherlock's hand was still on John's arm, but John's fingers had turned inward to Sherlock's own wrist and were now gently pressing down. Sherlock could even feel his pulse spiking himself and to make matters worse he even started panting a little bit.
"Of course not, don't be stupid, John!", Sherlock scoffed, while blushing even harder.
Why did he even care so much? It was not even like John was his family! And even then he could say with confidence, that he would not so readily have given up his life for Mycroft.
Sherlock knew it wasn’t all about their boring personalities though. He could have cared less about their low IQs, if they were any other person in the street. But the fact that John dated them, liked them even, always filled him with such a rage, that he actually wanted to make them hurt. He wanted to make them hurt even more than he did, when he saw John smiling at them with his stupid flirty smile that always meant he would take them to bed that same night.
John stood with his back to the window, directly looking at Sherlock as said man entered the room. Before Sherlock could say anything John started to speak.
"Okay?“, John parroted.
"YOU’RE GORGEOUS!“, John yelled.
“Honey, don’t you think you’re overreacting a little bit?“, John’s girlfriend had also vacated her seat and was now standing behind John, tugging on his arm lightly and trying to turn his attention away from Sherlock. John just ignored her.
“The Landmark“ it said in cursive Letters on the canopy. Sherlock remembered it being a very expensive Restaurant. Why would John, who thought Jumpers were a fitting attire for any occasion and who always made a fuss about overpriced clothes and food, go to a place such as this? It didn’t make any sense.
John lowered his head, leaving his forehead leaning slightly onto Sherlock’s chest, while he let go of his hands, his right hand remaining in the wall next to Sherlock’s face.
”No.”, the taller man said quitely after a while. John was almost afraid he was being turned down, but then he remembered his own question. He released Sherlock’s fingers and looked questioningly at his face.
The man twitched a bit at that, but his cheeks were now rather taking on the colour of a ripe peach.
"No?“, John asked. He shouldn’t be surprised to be turned down by a man like that. After all he was just too handsome and way out of John’s league. Hell, at least he had tried, right? Now he didn’t have to lay awake at night, thinking What if?!
"Four please!“ He said, when he stepped through the metal doors into the little box.
John hummed. He didn’t know why Sherlock had stayed with him. He had expected him to leave the minute John had let go of his hands. He was too tired to question Sherlock’s actions though. So he stayed silent, feeling as if he were in a daze. He didn’t care why Sherlock held him. Maybe he felt sorry for him or maybe he felt guilty. It didn’t matter though. John was happy with where he was and as long as neither of them moved, he couldn’t wish for anything better.
however, want Sherlock to see him. He wanted the Detective to see what effect he had on John. He wanted him to be just as turned on as John was. Bloody hell, John had it bad, hadn’t he?
«No, not that, Sherlock, I just… I didn’t expect you to care...» John amended in a whisper, more to himself than to Sherlock.
“So you guys are texting now? What’s next? You gonna meet her again?“
John felt white hot anger take over him. He couldn’t hold it back now, and if he was being completely honest, he didn’t really want to.
"Shit!“, John said again for a totally different reason.
“If you could forget your trust-issues for a moment and concentrate on what is really going on, I’m sure even you could figure it out!“
Mycroft used to warn him about these sorts of things: "Sentiment is not an advantage Sherlock!". "Love is a defect found on the losing side". And oh how right he was. Sherlock would never admit this out loud - he hated when Mycroft was right, but it didn’t change anything for the fact that it was true. Sentiment was not an advantage. Sherlock was reminded of that everyday.
about it with anyone else in the room! And now, John of all people, had to catch him in a moment of weakness? Sherlock did not want to think about the irony of that!
«What? Me breaking down crying? Yes, I did not expect that either!»
The grey clouds were a constant companion of Sherlock's since he left London. Since he left John. John Watson, his companion, conductor of light. His friend. His John. His ... no, he was not allowed to think that way. John Watson was not his in any way. And he never will be, Sherlock thought grimly. Yes, that’s right! John Watson was not gay and anyway Sherlock was married to his work.
Wrong! Because Greg clearly felt differently. He was getting up from his previous lethargic position on the couch and started clapping his hands and beginning a mantra of "Kiss!, Kiss!, Kiss!".
“Watson“
It was getting harder and harder to not let it take effect on him. Sherlock was constantly afraid of doing something that might upset John, so he always bailed when John was near. He would either go out to Barts or wander aimlessly around London, trying not to think of how it had been before the Fall. How John had gladly followed him into any situation, how he had called him extraordinary and brilliant. There was none of those quiet nights by the fireplace or ridiculous giggle sessions by the staircase anymore.
His cheeks were tinted with a lovely shade of pink and John suspected, that his ears underneath the curls would be even redder. Finally arriving at the eyes John could make out two distinctly gray eyes that looked right back at him and seemed to darken with every second. John experienced a feeling of having been caught red handed at doing something naughty and he could feel his own face starting to heat. He didn’t dare break eye contact with his neighbour though. He had waited all this time to make a move on him and here it was, a chance to do just that. He only had to open his mouth and introduce himself. He was just about to do that when the elevator suddenly rattled and the came to an abrupt stop. The lights flickered, but after a moment they turned off as well.
John used his hand, that lay on the stone to push himself up and leaned onto his cane for support. He let his eyes roam over the grave one last time and imagined it was Sherlock he was looking at. Then, without another word, he turned around and slowly made his way back to the gate, where a beautiful woman with a warm smile waited for him.
John crumpled down as he said this. He had one hand on the stone, one hand covering his eyes as tears continued running down his face. The rain drained him from head to toe and he could already feel a headache forming at the back of his head, but he didn’t care.
”Oh”, and then suddenly overcome by a surge of courage, John said ”It’s you, Sherlock! Fuck, it’s always you! No one else, just you!”
If John thought he couldn’t have gotten any angrier, well he could. And he did. With two long steps he strode over to Sherlock and stopped mere inches from where he was still seated in his chair. He grabbed Sherlock by the collar, which earned him a high pitched gasp and dragged him over to the nearest wall. He pinned Sherlock‘s hands with his left hand over the younger man’s head and fixated him with his body. Now the fear was very visible in the detective‘s clear green eyes, but John didn’t care. He was so angry.
He let go of John's arm and tried to turn away, but John's grip simply intensified. He could feel his cheeks starting to warm.
Sherlock turned his attention back to John, still feeling slightly dazed.
To believe this would one day serve as a sorry excuse for a substitute of one great Sherlock Holmes, had almost made John laugh the first time. Almost. It had actually made him angry. Furious even, that one would ever suggest a cold, heartless stone could replace a human being.
It was a rhetorical question, because John already knew it to be the truth. His flatmate was still in the same position he had been in last night, sitting at their kitchen table and looking through his microscope, while sporadically taking notes.
Sherlock would probably deduce all the pains he felt right now. He would advice John to work less, eat more and start working out again. John could not do any of that though. He didn’t see the point in it. What difference does it make to stay in shape, when he didn’t need to chase criminals through half of London any more. Why would he care that his leg ached like hell and his shoulder started cramping every night? At least this way he could almost forget that draining numbness that made him so careless and tired every day.
there was some friction against John’s achingly hard member.
When Sherlock took John’s hand to guide him to his bedroom, it wasn’t for sex (though there would be plenty of that later). They were simply going to lay in each others arms, holding on tight and basking in each other's comfort.
«I should have realized sooner, but I was just so bloody frustrated that you didn’t seem to care ... I mean you didn’t react in any way to my advances, you didn’t answer any of my questions and then I thought you knew and just ignored it to spare us both the humiliation and that just made me angry. I know it’s no excuse, but I was just so wrong. I’ve never been so happy to be wrong in my entire life!»
John was abruptly cut off, as Sherlock cupped John’s cheeks with both hands and pressed his lips to John‘s. John let out a surprised gasp. He froze for a few seconds, before he finally recovered and kissed back. It was a simple kiss at first. Just a hard, but lovely pressing of lips. That grew into a more tender, but also more passionate kiss, as Sherlock flicked his tongue over John‘s upper lip, asking for entry, which was granted with a low moan on John‘s behalf. As their tongues finally met, Sherlock shuddered. He fumbled with the belt of John‘s bathrobe and let his hand‘s explore John’s naked chest and back, as he finally managed to open it.
"Fuck! I didn't think you guys would actually shag each other right here. We just asked for a little kiss.", Greg said half laughing. John and Sherlock sprung apart as if burnt and successfully put 6 feet between them in under a second. John was blushing furiously now and he had a feeling Sherlock would be in quite the similar state. He didn't dare look at him though. Instead he looked at the shocked and amused (This was only Greg though) faces of their guests. John had totally forgotten about them some time into the kiss and Greg was right, they did go overboard a bit with their mistletoe-kiss. John closed his eyes and clenched a fist into his hair. This was fucking humiliating!
They stayed like that for a while, until Sherlock decided to break the silence.
But he didn’t do any of that. He had just stood dumbstruck on the ground, looked up to the roof and watched him jump. It was his fault his best friend was dead. The man who made his life worth living was dead. And he couldn’t do anything about it.
The young man was
John wakes in his own bed feeling slightly out of place. He feels uncomfortable, like someone’s watching him. With some effort he regains full consciousness and immediately regrets it. He can sense his own strains before feeling them and he
They didn’t move much after that, just laying side by side on John’s bed, smiling at each other and falling into a content sleep, facing each other, their fingers touching above the duvet, each with a smile on their lips.
It was all too much and still not enough in a fascinating way.
again. It was John's turn now to answer. If he wanted to have Sherlock in his life, he would have to say so. Sherlock didn't want to be John's friend because John was lonely or because John needed a distraction. Sherlock wanted to be John's friend because John wanted him to be. Of course Sherlock didn't want to be JUST his friend but that would have to be enough for now. Everything else they would figure out later. First Sherlock had to know if John even wanted him back.
John made his way to the door in a daze, but turned as he was halfway through. He didn’t want to leave this elevator, and especially not before at least getting this guy’s phone number.
At that Sherlock couldn’t help but smile. All of a sudden he couldn’t wait to finally see John again. What was he doing, standing in front of a Hotel and nearly having a panic attack. No, he would be fine. John might be angry at first, for Sherlock having fooled him and leaving him behind. John reminded Sherlock of a german Shepherd in so many ways. They were always extremely hurt when they were left behind as well. But that was not the point. The most important trait John had to offer was that he would always forgive Sherlock in the end. He was extremely loyal - again, just like a german Shepherd - and Sherlock knew John would do anything for him. Just like Sherlock would, and had done in fact, for John. They needed each other like they needed air. Sherlock had been made painfully aware of that during his time away from his Doctor. With renewed confidence, Sherlock strode into the Hotel and walked through the foyer in the direction of the Restaurant.
“I’ll tell him what I always tell him, I was injured on a private case.” Sherlock countered.
The ex-army doctor blinked, staring at Sherlock’s previously opened eyes in surprise. No, the doctor's eyes must be playing tricks on him, the light maybe? He was certain Sherlock’s eyes were blue; a brilliant moonstone colour.
“Just go!” Sherlock moaned through the pain, rolling himself onto his side and trying to push himself away in an attempt to create some distance between John and himself. However, John didn’t hesitate to grab him again, rolling him back over onto his back and pinning him down with his hands. He was sure Sherlock often forgot he was strong; he was a soldier after all. “I’m calling Mycroft!” the doctor asserted as he went to grab his phone, hitting the call button but all-the-while keeping a heavy hand and elbow on Sherlock’s chest.
“Lestrade!” John tutted.
The wolf roared once again as it clawed at his face, ripping at its fur, biting and slashing before it collapsed in a fit of anger to the floor, panting heavily as its claws dug into the carpeted floor, clenching and unclenching.
During the night, John had gathered his medical kit and a few towels and clothes for Sherlock; going by the werewolf movies he’d seen growing up, he figured Sherlock might need them once the fur was gone.
(See the end of the chapter for
“The effects should wear off soon enough, I doubt my brother dosed the bullet with enough of the stuff to kill me.” He smirked weakly.
“Shit... Wait, what’s it doing why hasn’t it attacked?”
“No, it’s- he’s, whatever, is blocking the door.”
“Sherlock- wait...” John let out an exasperated sigh as he watched the door close behind Sherlock but the doctor didn’t follow him - maybe it was best just to let him be at the moment. It had hurt John to say what he had said, hurt him to be faced with the fact that maybe Sherlock didn’t want his help. Sherlock needed to know that the way he had acted was normal and should be treated as such. He couldn’t let him believe that his natural behaviour was wrong – he shouldn’t have said anything. The army doctor let out another defeated sigh as he sunk low into his chair; all he could do now was wait until morning...
“Drugs don’t work on me.” Sherlock responded casually. “Well, on our kind.”
“I don’t want anyone else to know John.”
John let out a sigh, kneeling on the floor beside the bed with a groan, pain shooting up his leg. “I can’t just leave you here. Remember what I’ve been saying this whole time? About not wanting you to be alone? If this is an issue of privacy, then I can shut the door and wait outside until you’re done, but I’m not leaving you. I’ve already seen this happen once and it doesn’t change anything. I’m going to be fine, Sherlock. I promise. And so are you.”
Sherlock glanced at John’s incoming hand, wondering what he was trying to do. Was he trying to pet him? However when the hand recoiled, Sherlock looked away sadly, confirming John’s fear of him. Sherlock turned his head away as he made an attempt to get up, stumbling a bit on his injured leg.
John opened the fridge door hesitantly, and of course, Sherlock was again immediately up on two legs, practically throwing himself into the fridge. John took a few steps back, not wanting to get in the way of a hungry werewolf as Sherlock poked about in the fridge, again knocking a few things out in his search. John scrubbed a hand over his face, knowing he’d have to clean up the mess of smashed milk bottles and cartons of leftover takeaway later.
All too soon the sound of cracking bones could be heard audibly and Sherlock let out a scream. John cringed at the sound of... God, was that sickening cracking sound coming from Sherlock? The doctor didn't try to grab him again, John just sat there on his knees, staring at the detective rather stupidly. He’d never heard any sort of drug being able to have this effect on someone. He opened his mouth to call his friend's name again but no sound came out, and he just stared at him, horrified. What was happening? He felt frozen in place, and his mind felt numb.
“So you keep telling us.” The elder brother smirked.
“Is everything okay between you two?” Lestrade suddenly asked, despite John’s best effort to keep conversation to a minimum. “I mean, Sherlock just seems to be acting a bit... well, let us say more weird than usual.”
John knew this of course and he completely understood. “We’re both not used to this.” he reassured with a smile as they stared at each other in silence for a short moment. “Let me go get your tea.”
He was trying to tell me. He wanted me to leave and I couldn’t stop being so stubborn.
With the sun setting behind them and the alley way becoming increasingly darker by the second, Sherlock suddenly extended his arm in front of John to stop him. “Shh,” he commanded the doctor quietly.
The doctor’s expression softened; something was wrong. This wasn’t right; Sherlock never said please. John bit his lip and shook his head, standing his ground. “No Sherlock. I can’t let you leave, I’m sorry.” he sighed.
- John didn’t want anything else worsening the detective’s already sullen mood. He took a sip of the cheap coffee catered for the Yarders, wrinkling his nose at the lukewarm temperature, tossing it into a nearby bin.
“Amazing...” Mycroft breathed down the phone.
It had been several months since Sherlock’s first transformation in front of John and it was fair to say that the doctor had begun to grow fairly used to Sherlock’s lycanthropy. He had nearly memorised the pattern of Sherlock’s change after witnessing it roughly six times; it was still horrifying to see his friend in so much pain but the doctor had learnt how to keep himself together through it all. He had to keep his brain turned on to process it and not allow shock to overtake him, and with that in mind he was able to get through it with little more than a look of extreme pity and worry. However Sherlock’s mood had not improved much from the first time John had been with him, but it didn’t mean John didn’t try to change that. He still encouraged Sherlock to let himself go for a bit, be the wolf that his body reflected, but Sherlock seemed even more resigned that ever. John even bought a few pounds of raw meat every full moon, hoping he could get Sherlock in a good mood, but he rarely ate it. When he did, the detective would drag it off to his room and eat it quietly, denying John the opportunity to watch.
“It’s not your fault.” The detective croaked, seeing the guilt written on the doctor’s face. “I should have told you.”
Why was he so certain this was Sherlock now? Why had it taken him so long to make up his mind? John’s mouth fell open and his head had begun hurt; feeling light-headed and disoriented as he scrambled forward to the wolf’s side.
“I heard that!” Sherlock growled furiously.
Mycroft turned round to face John. “You were simply here; he had something to fight for.” Mycroft paused. “I don’t think you realise that my brother cares for you, Doctor Watson.”
John tired to smile through his comment but once was again greeted by an upset Sherlock. This was different though, he didn’t just look upset, he looked almost frantic – panicked even. “Sherlock, hey,” he tried to say something, pausing when Sherlock began to wipe his face on the carpet in panic. The army doctor furrowed his brow, worried.
John smiled with sarcastic sweetness and took his phone back. “Good boy.” he mumbled under his breath after dialling.
John rolled his eyes when Sherlock twisted his head away, his bloody pride. “Oh, come on. You don’t have to pretend you don’t like it. I can see straight through that. I can imagine that feels nice, with all that fur.” He smirked.
“John?” he breathed, finally opening his eyes to look at the doctor painfully.
Mycroft shrugged slightly. “You may be surprised but you’ll find out soon enough, it’s almost sunrise.” he informed, double checking his watch.
Sherlock seemed almost unconscious, in a way, he was breathing but seemed far from aware. The groan would have been a comfort if Sherlock had been in this state for any other reason.
“Correct.” Mycroft nodded. “Sherlock and I inherited the condition from our parents. Lycanthropy in the Holmes family dates back many centuries; it’s a big part of our family history.”
John furrowed his brow in confusion. “I’m glad I know... I’m glad that you don’t have to sneak off anywhere alone now.”
The soldier didn’t think he’d be able to stand, let alone run away, if he had tried; his socked heels prevented him from moving as much as he’d liked to. Since when had he been so easily frightened? John took sharp breaths through his nose before trying to speak. “S-Sherlock, its-it’s me, John.” The wolf let out a low growl and John held up his hands slowly in defence. “Please... It’s just me.” his voice was shaking and cracking uncontrollably, but he didn’t dare blink as the wolf moved ever closer.
John’s gentle smile vanished when Sherlock made his way towards the door. “Sherlock, hey...” he called as he too got up with a grunt and hurried after him. “Sherlock,” he repeated, grabbing his shoulder, noticing how tall Sherlock was for an animal, even on all fours. John wasn’t the tallest man, he knew that, and Sherlock’s head reached to his mid upper arm. Not to mention the fact that Sherlock was somewhat slouching and staying low to the ground, cradling his arm to his chest. “Sherlock,” John tried again as the wolf shrugged his hand off and made his way through the kitchen towards the living room. “At least respond to me, Sherlock!” John called from the doorway with a frustrated tone.
“What?”
“It’s not like the movies, John.” Sherlock suddenly interjected, sensing a bit of excitement in John’s voice. “It’s not a quick bite and then the next day you can you see and hear perfectly. It’s painful, agonising, excruciating, it takes days for the transformation to complete and even then it takes months,
Part of John wanted to press his ear against the door and listen to everything even though he knew how upsetting it would be. He could hear Sherlock whimpering quietly and it took all of his strength to trust him and stay outside. However he nearly lost that strength when he heard Sherlock scream, breath catching in his throat, his hand darted to the doorknob. He gripped it tightly, cringing at every sound of snapping bone and tearing flesh. He prayed none of it was harmful and Sherlock wasn’t in trouble, but even so, what could he do? This was beyond his control. Sherlock was a werewolf. This was apparently normal for the detective.
John was worried he’d knock the whole fridge over the way the wolf was acting. “No, I mean it, Sherlock. Stop it. God, look what you’re doing.” he complained looking at the mess, feeling tired already. When Sherlock finally pulled his head out, John grimaced at the hunk of raw meat wedged tightly between the wolf’s teeth; still bright red and dripping juices onto the floor. “What the hell is that?” John asked, knowing with Sherlock it could be anything. He certainly didn’t bring it home, nor hide it in the back of the fridge, unpackaged and unprotected. He just prayed it wasn’t a piece of leg or something of the sort. Although it already seemed Sherlock was gnawing contently on it in the living room. He knew he wouldn’t be able to get it from him if he tried and Sherlock didn’t look keen to drop it any time soon.
“Just relax... Here, let me help you onto the bed, make you a bit more comfy yeah?” John suggested as he helped Sherlock to his feet. “I’ll get you some warm pads for your muscles.” He stated, noticing the stiffness of Sherlock’s body and his newly compressed muscles as he lowered him onto the mattress. “And some tea...” John said under his breath, mentioning it more for himself than anything as he went to leave the room.
A black pointed ear swivelled in the direction of the shaky whisper that called his name. Sherlock opened his eyes, his moon-stone coloured eyes shining brightly against the black fur, only now realising his back was to John, maybe that was for the best? The fear in John’s voice made his heart ache, that was why he avoided people in this state. The edge of fear that lined his friend’s voice gave the detective all the information he needed. He slowly rolled off the bed, landing heavily on the floor as he tried to find his footing. He let out a low growl of pain as he became accustomed to his new form.
Guess who hasn't had great luck with computers recently? Me! So my computer completely died on me and I sent it of to get repaired and to fix it they basically had to scrub my computer clean and reboot it - no worries because I always backup my files on a hard drive. Only what are you suppose to do when your hard drive becomes corrupt... So the massive delay was due to me having to rewrite multiple chapters and get it the way I liked it again and ugh! It was just such an ordeal... it wasn't a fun at all.
Of all the people John had witnessed in agony in his days at war, he could have argued that Sherlock looked worse. The supernatural aspect of this only added to it, every change in Sherlock’s body bordering on impossible, something that a human would never expect to see. He could see Sherlock’s body compressing itself, shrinking, crushing the expanded organs inside until they too changed to fit. He couldn’t bring himself to look away, no matter how horrifying it was. His bones made sickening cracking sounds as they snapped into place, rearranging themselves, swollen muscles seemed to dissolve under his skin, all the while the black fur thinned all over his body - except for the select human places where it was meant to exist.
The sight frightened John. That was a warning. He knew what Sherlock was saying and he knew Sherlock knew exactly what he was doing, how he looked. Sherlock was mad. Sherlock didn’t want to understand. He didn’t want peace. The idea of being a wolf and being happy was unfathomable to him. John knew it was possible. It had to be. Still, he flinched at the sound, stiffening. “Is that a threat?” John asked shakily after a moment, looking his friend over sadly.
Sherlock let out a snort from his black nose before finally extending his arm for John to look at.
“I’m not having it. You’ll rip that open again and then it’ll be even worse. No, I’m sorry, I’m telling Lestrade you can’t leave the flat yet.” John said, reaching for his mobile, however Sherlock was quick to intercept and managed to grab John’s phone before he could, keeping it from him.
John let out a breath when Sherlock stopped, his erect ears proof that he had been heard. “Are you going to bite me? For trying to help you?” his heart felt heavy.
“Wha-” but before John could continue Sherlock, who was still squirming and shaking violently, roared. The detective’s voice and the word ‘run’ a mixture of that soft, smooth baritone and a deep, threatening roar.
“Oh shut up.” The detective complained as John teased him.
John pressed his lips into a thin line, upset by seeing Sherlock in so much pain. He gently unhooked the bandages wrapped around Sherlock’s arm, unwinding them and tenderly removed the gauze. The skin was still bright red and scabbed in areas, although for the most part the stitches had dissolved. The skin was indented largely where John had not been able to replace much skin, and he ran his fingers over the closed wound gently, hoping it would stay sealed.
I hope you all enjoyed this chapter! I love hearing feedback from you guys so please remember to leave a comment! Constructive criticism is welcome also! :)
“Sherlock, I want to help you. I... I don’t know if you can understand me, but... I want to help.” he spoke softly edging closer but the wolf snarled sharply baring its teeth and John stopped moving quickly. “It’s just me, it’s John, okay?” He lowered his head slightly in an attempt to show that he wasn’t a threat and mentally laughed at himself. As if this thing would see him as a danger. Look at what it’s capable of. John looked into the wolfs eyes again, keeping a perfectly straight face, banishing any emotion from it and praying he was, in fact, speaking to his friend. “I’m not going to hurt you... and I don’t think you want to hurt me either...” he smiled softly, extending a hand to try and touch the top of the wolfs muzzle in comfort.
“They don’t work. Werewolves have very fast metabolisms, so our bodies just burn off the medication.” he explained.
“I know, I’m sorry, Sherlock...” John said quietly as the detective hissed sharply through his teeth. He squeezed his friend’s hand, dabbing at the wound as gently as he could. John’s face was scrunched into a look of pity and sadness, even pain, as if it was him who had had a bite taken from his arm.
“You’re a
John frowned. “What do you mean?”
The detective’s body froze at the sudden information, his eyes drifting back to John with worry. “No, I’m pretty sure you just read it wrong.” he attempted to persuade.
John set his jaw as he tapped his fingers against the arm rest before nodding slowly in submission. “Okay.” He agreed gently. The detective was right, he had no idea of the world Sherlock Holmes knew, the world in which John had now found himself in – but he wanted to learn. John turned his head to look towards the morning light pouring in through the window. “For the record, this completely goes against ‘potential flatmates should know the worst about each other’.” He commented to Sherlock.
“I wasn’t sure what you could eat when you’re like this, so I got a few things at the shops earlier.” John stated as he got up from the floor and went to inspect the cupboards. “There’s your usual snacks in there, don’t know if you’d want those later or-”
did that.” He referred to the slightly more serious wounds including the bite out his arm.
“John, listen to me carefully. You have to leave the flat this is instant.”
“It was hardly a near death experience, John.” He argued with a grump.
The soldier hesitated a moment before setting Sherlock on the floor carefully, snatching a pillow from the sofa and sliding it under his head. He still kept a hand on the detective’s shoulder lightly, in case he needed to grab him again. “Sherlock, I swear, if you don’t tell me what you’ve done, or whatever drug you’ve taken right now, I’m calling Mycroft. Do you understand?” he warned as he peeled open one of Sherlock’s eye lids to see if it was dilated. However as he did, Sherlock’s eyes flashed dangerously gold causing the detective to pull away and clenched them shut once more.
“There’s got to be something we can do for pain? We can ask Mycroft, maybe. Also, it might be best if you stay home for a while. I doubt you’ll have a lot of movement in your arm for a few weeks.” He called over his shoulder.
After being pushed from the counter top, Sherlock’s nose led him to the fridge. His breathing deepened and sped up as his nose pushed against the rim of the fridge, smelling something delightfully delicious. Sherlock scrambled at the edge of the fridge in an attempt to try and open it.
“He’ll be fine.” Mycroft assured as he watched John look on in horror. “The bullet’s not laced with enough Wolfsbane to kill him, just enough to incapacitate him.”
The doctor continued to watch the wolf attack itself, yelping and growling until he couldn’t take it any longer. This had to stop before it ended up killing itself, or Sherlock, or however it worked. It took John a few moments to build up the courage, and it wasn’t even all there when he stood up, arms stretched in front of his body defensively. “Stop it!” he shouted as loud as he could, trying to scream over the wolf’s roars and stand tall.
He tried to keep his thoughts on track as he grabbed his kit from under the bed, pausing before grabbing his cane as well, shoved far behind it. It couldn’t hurt.
“Yes, usually.” Sherlock answered rather forcefully as he turned on the tap. “Besides I should be fine in a few days.”
“Well I see you’re... um... you’re acting a bit more wolfy.” John said casually, although there was apprehension within his voice.
Sherlock sighed gently as he looked down at his arm. “It would have killed you. If I hadn’t had intervened I would have woken up to your dead body.” He admitted solemnly. “And I suppose I intervened for more selfish reasons than heroic – I wouldn’t have been able to live with the guilt, I didn’t want to live with the knowledge that I had let it kill you.” The detective let out another sigh as looked up at John. “And even if by some miracle it hadn’t managed to kill you, I didn’t want to be the reason you’d change, the reason why your life wouldn’t be the same.”
John jumped slightly when the wolf fell off the bed, the loud thump shaking the floor where he was seated. He swallowed thickly when he heard the low growl, waiting to be noticed, hoping that Sherlock wasn’t right when he’d been worried about hurting him. There was nothing John could do now though. If this wasn’t Sherlock after all, he might not make it out as lucky this time, cornered in a single room. The doctor leaned to the side slightly, trying to get a better glimpse of the creature, noticing how it was holding one of its front legs to its chest. He didn’t look like he was in excruciating pain at this point but John still worried about the carefully stitched skin. Whether Sherlock’s mind was present or not, this was his friend’s body; he couldn’t let the wolf hurt it.
