“Hello sir,” a scratchy voice polluted Steve’s ears breaking his focus away from the beautiful harpy, “are you interested in buying?”
Steve listened to the voice whispering the last line over and over again in his mind that he missed someone calling him, “-er! Soldier! I need your credentials!” The man looked strict and impatient. Steve swallowed nervous but replied all the same. The man gave him a one over and snorted. It seems like everyone shares the same opinion of him. It did not matter. Steve will show them. He will show them all.
“If he doesn’t make it through to the field we could always use him in the strategy meetings. That boy is smart. I mean really smart,” Steve heard his commanding officer speaking to the Colonel. The other man gave him a skeptical look before catching Steve looking at them and ended the conversation. His commanding officer turned to see him and smiled.
“I know but at least try to talk your way out of it. You were always good at that,” Pepper pulled fully away before turning and leaving Tony on his own.
“Is everything alright shield brother?” Thor asked and Steve knew he had taken too long to put the artifact away.
It seemed like the prince could feel the anger behind Tony’s words and just blinks before saying calmly, “Is that so? Why don’t you enlighten us all about the subject of servants vs. thieves?”
“Don’t take everything they say to heart. Your looking at what remains of the 107th,” Peggy placed a comforting hand on his shoulder.
They got to the Colonel’s tent and saw the man talking away about some soldier or another being MIA and waiting for the designated type writer to catch up to his latest sentence. Steve cut in before he could continue, “Sir, what happened with the 107th?”
“Steve!” Tony shouted from across the city center where the merchants and mechanics were set up. Tony was waving like mad calling attention to Thor and Steve. He felt his cheeks redden at being made the center of attention but Thor seemed to bathe in their looks so he let the other blond man take all their attention for himself. Instead, Steve made his way towards Tony who was poked by Sam to get back to work. It was good to see Tony busy at work fixing tools and machines that locals brought to the city center in hopes of getting it fixed.
“’Ello,” a small voice spoke up walking towards him. Tony looked up to see a boy standing there. He wore large glasses and his hair was a bit too short for Tony’s liking. The boy was smaller than him which was a hard feet since he was already small in nature.
“You would have fought to stay,” Tony just said, “took on the whole world on those tiny shoulders to prove we were worthy. And I loved you for that but I also knew that love blinded you to the opportunity that you could have. I am not going to apologize for making that choice.”
“Jerk,” Steve replied rubbing his forehead feeling his cheeks burn in slight embarrassment; he did not want to look stupid in front of Tony. It was important to him that Tony come to like him and getting whacked around probably doesn’t help.
“Yeah, oh,” Tony snapped a bit before trying to climb off the now awake soldier. This was not supposed to go this way. Rogers was supposed to stay asleep and Tony to laugh off this stupid idea as a drunk mistake.
“Steve!” Bruce shot up from his seat looking excited and relieved to see him, “just in time, do you have the ingredients?”
“I have no idea if I got the tools you want or need but I have I have a mechanic friend in the city and thought I could ask them,” Steve spoke up coming to sit next to Tony. This was the first time Steve really instigated contact with the harpy. Tony turned slightly towards him with a serious look on his face.
He had gotten up early that morning to give himself a few extra hours to head towards the market and a chance to enjoy the view. The land of Nework was beautiful full of trees, hills, mountains and large gatherings of waters spread all across its land. Ever since Steve had received the special potion from the medicine man Eckenstein, he has been able to experience the world at a whole different level. Hear the gentle brush of wind against the grass, the animals moving slow across the familiar terrain, the slow buzz of the insects moving about. Feel the cold wind against his bare skin, the hard protective cloth, the gravel like pebbles in the grass. See every shade of color from the different greens to the darkest greys, far away details of buildings that was slowly coming into view, the minute details of nature’s beauty. Steve experienced it all. Most of the time he learned to tune it out but days like this, he lets it consume him just for a bit. It made the trip all the more worth while.
Ever since then Steve began to hear more and more people talk about Tony and his story and often times hearing them demand to know the actual truth of what happened. All that they were doing was going to help Tony save his people if the people are willing to let themselves be saved by him.
Tony stopped moving and slumped in Steve’s grasp. Steve felt relief wash over him as Tony allowed Steve to maneuver him into his arms fully and just hold him there. They just stood there holding each other for a while as Tony calmed himself down.
After his plate was filled Jarvis put Tony down on a chair in the corner of the room. Just in time, since his father seemed to be searching the room for Tony and if he saw Jarvis carrying him it would have been bad for the both of them. Howard spotted him finally and noticed the plate of food. He nodded at Tony like he would discuss it with the six year old later. Tony just stared at the plate in front of him. He felt a little lost. To distract himself from his train of thoughts Tony began to analyze the makings of the pieces of food on his plate. He began to identify the ingredients as he bit into each piece on his plate. It was child’s play but it did its job.
“Yeah? And what’s that? The cute girl who works on your floor or the boy down in printing?” Bucky smiled knowing full well that although Steve found them cute he wasn’t interested in pursuing anything with them.
“So, what does a guy like you do during the recession,” she asked, “Since you know you can’t be a solider.”
“I made something,” Tony came into Steve's tent without an invitation and if it were anyone else Steve would have kicked them out instantly. Instead, he shifted around to give Tony some space to sit next to him. Tony brought his mechanic bag with him so Steve figured it was something Tony had finished building. It was quite exciting to see what a brilliant mind like Tony's would make.
Steve began to suck and move over Tony’s cock like he owned it. Like it was his job. He kept a quick rhythm, bobbing his head and sucking just in the right place, making Tony moan and arch his back. Tony kept his hands in Steve’s hair clutching hard, feeling Steve’s almost brutal routine all over his body.
“My name is Tony Stark and I am the rightful king to the throne…” Steve tried to listen but his head felt dizzy and the world blurred around him and suddenly there was nothing but darkness.
It was fun all around until Sam brought them all back to the topic at hand, “first things first, we are doing a lot better than what we thought we would be doing since Tony started helping. Man you are are a miracle worker. Anyway, that aside, the next mission is kind of dangerous because we got to go into the forest near the Sabers are located. Those vicious cats are a killer to face. Steve, Thor and maybe Bucky could go ahead and check out the safety of the mission while Tony, Bruce and I can go into town to get a few more coin and supplies. You willing to put those hands to work Tony?”
"Hey," Steve spoke up softly as to not scare Tony, "We are going to make it and save your people. Each one of us wants to help you bring your people freedom and peace. Your family, they will come back to you. I promise."
“It’s fine Happy,” Tony smiles softly at the larger harpy who came to sit next to Tony immediately. Steve realized that each and every one of the three was quite protective of Tony and not because he was their prince but because he was their friend. Tony let Happy press up against him despite it limiting Tony’s movements. It seemed to make Happy more comfortable knowing he is, in a way, sitting between Tony and any immediate threat or danger. Steve sat on Tony’s other side giving him enough wiggle room to stay comfortable but close enough that their knees brushed each other casually. He could feel the brush of Tony’s wings against his back in a constant deliberate motion. They sat like that silently as the rest of the Avengers filed their way in.
Steve stood in front of a group of girls who were laughing at one of Bucky’s many jokes. Though he was not listening in the slightest. He looked around catching a girl’s eye from across the room. She smiled at him. Not wanting to hurt her feelings by his disinterest he just shyly looks away. Somehow, it does not get him the desired result. She walks towards him. Bucky notices and smiles encouragingly at him.
Rogers did not seem himself, either; in fact, he looked nearly as uncomfortable as Tony. His fisted arm guiding Tony by the small of his back was stiff, and he never took his eyes off the door ahead, nor the ones after that…
“The Sheriff?” he suggested in a tone that made it clear he consider it a nice joke. His quiet friend seemed to agree, letting out a tentative chortle. “Hundred dollars, that’s what’s been the wage far back as I can remember. A hero or not, the state can’t be paying him more than fraction of that for his service in war in addition.”
“Yeah, it’s me.” Steve let out a small, relieved laugh as he closed the distance, and enveloped Tony into a strong hug. Tony stiffened but did not draw back. “It’s Steve. Your Steve.”
“And why did he have to bring that wretched Babushka?” whispered loudly a woman reclined in a velvet cocktail chair as he passed the group. “What was she called again? Molotov?
Mystified, Tony climbed over the solid, square seat, trying not to knee Rogers at the back of his head. Without the divide of the back, it suddenly felt very intimate to share the same seat. At a sharp bend, Tony felt himself slide towards him despite the ridged upholstery.
This was one of those uncomfortable things Scott seemed to have a habit of saying and which made Steve feel a strange mixture of humbling embarrassment.
“No less naïve than trusting a stranger and a suspect, whom I have not treated considerately, I guess.”
“Fury said the construction of the bridge is underway,” he said, matter of fact. “He also pointed out that I own a company now, and since I’m to be held responsible for the destruction of the last one, I should pitch in.”
“It’s spot-on,” said Tony, who felt Rogers had overstayed his welcome; he made a meal out of watching Dummy chase the gardener and his hosepipe in the distance.
Idly, Steve scratched at the newly grown hair on his chin. Next to them, a woman peered hopefully into the apple crates and, after finding them empty, walked off briskly into the direction of her home. Watching her retreat, Steve grunted and changed position.
Tony’s step faltered with a sudden, high-pitched squeak of rubber sole against lacquer. The men inside the room quieted. Soon, their footsteps neared the door, and it opened before Tony, revealing two men in shawl-collared tuxedos. At the sight of Tony, Stone’s square face closed off and became as hard as his namesake. The other man’s puffy face twisted into an unquestionable sneer.
“Don’t want them to steal the thunder?” asked Tony, who was eying with interest the typewriter Jarvis had scavenged for Steve.
So he did. Sufficiently scolded, Tony inquired on Rhodey’s plans to leave for America, on catching the train, and offered, quite graciously, to have Happy drive all his trunks to the station.
“May I?” asked Rogers, hand on the back of a chair he was about to draw for himself. He sat down. Just as he pulled out a little booklet, a knock came from the door.
Natasha, Steve couldn’t help but notice, looked rather flattered at this. Steve, feeling sore about the person whom he suspected to be the source of this rumor as well as the one concerning Tony’s involvement in arson, couldn’t quite muster similar regard.
She blushed scarlet under her white cap, releasing a little giggle just as the latch clicked shut after her.
The following silence was so total one could hear the distant sound of constant mechanical throbbing in furious rhythm.
“Here to hear me confess my sins?” Tony asked, shooting a glance at Steve. “I already did. You just missed Father Fury.”
make you see more of this town than this room. Even if it means making you a new pair of legs, I will do it,” he finished fiercely.
Happy gave a look, which Tony answered with a tiny twitch of the head towards the driveway and its oaks.
Steve held his breath, but Tony did not elaborate; just looked out of the window in what looked to be another troubled silence.
“But there are mountain lions out there,” Scott moaned. “He don’t do so good alone. What if he gets lost?”
“You haven’t brought them with you, have you?” Tony inquired, perking up. “My new security detail’s proven to be corrupt.”
“Never thought I would miss your pining,” Bucky said, breaking Steve’s trail of thought. “This, whatever this is, is worse. Way worse.”
And for a brief moment, Steve allowed himself the impossible hope that Tony would stay and talk. However, once Steve couldn’t delay taking the coat any longer, he saw Tony’s awkward gesturing that signified this was the end of the conversation.
“You know,” Steve told him, “sometimes I have no idea whether you’re about to wreck our house or kill yourself with work.”
Steve hastily wiped a wet cheek against the carriage’s wall and straightened. The window was blurred where his heavy breathing had fogged the glass.
“I found it lost under his cot, already opened. I like my privacy, and I’ve found that the best way to maintain it, is to respect that of others.”
Twice, Tony thought he felt an icy, calculating pair of eyes on his back, but when he, at last, could chance a look at the front door, his eyes merely caught those of Obie, Mr. Stone. and Stern, standing in a ring, smoking cigars.
Tony nearly drippled some of the salmon paste onto the couch: a jolt had shot through him, causing his hand to spasm.
While the end of the table was the most coveted seat, for one could cut their food without cramming their arms, Steve noted, though, that this also put him in a position where he would not be in contact with Steve on either side.
“Think of Tiberius Stone coming here, alive, expecting to see you, yet all he got in return was to bleed out on a hard floor, cold, and alone, and here you are, handling the loss of a life like he was a
Fury exclaimed, mimicking Steve in turning the letter around and around but no further text appeared. “Damn it! Just because he’s got the brains doesn’t make it open season on my shit. Light-fingered, pilfering motherfuc—”
Now what? Tony thought desperately. If he could be sure it was just a housemaid … or an air bubble in the pipes … but still, no cause made itself known. There was nothing for it…
Tony startled; he had not realized Jarvis was still there; and although he should have known it would be coming, he had not expected the jump from Master Anthony to
strike me as the sparing sort,” jumped in Bucky. “If he’s not dead in a ditch somewhere remote, he mustn’t be much of threat to Stane.”
Someone tugged at Hammer Sr.’s elbow, but the livid old man did not back down: face red from both strain and anger, even his carefully arranged toupee had become crooked as his meaty fist curled tighter and tighter.
Tony continued to listen to doctors as they continued their monologue and instructions for him. Once they finished prepping him they began to guide him through each of the tests. It had bugged him a bit but he had asked one of the nurses to call Steve back into the room. Tony did not want to be alone while he had someone poking and prodding at him. He hated it but he knew Steve would not come to gloat at him or shove this in his face. And as fast as he requested the super soldier, Steve was there by his side. They never touched but Steve was a constant pillar standing there letting Tony know he was not alone. And just for a moment, Tony felt like he could actually do this. That waking up in the future was not so bad.
“Yeah,” Steve smiled bashfully, “they call me Captain America. I just...I wanted to help in the war and if I had listened to Colonel Phillips I would have been stuck on the sidelines. At least this clown costume helped me do something rather than sit around fiddling my thumbs.”
“I can’t ask you to risk your lives!” Tony tried to reason with them but looking into each of the Avenger’s eyes and settling on Steve’s all he got was stubborn determination to help.
There was a knock on the door. Steve looked up to find his mother standing there holding a cup of warmed milk. She smiled at him as she stepped into the room, shoving the cup into his hands. “Thanks,” he grumbled. She smiled placing her hand on his cheek.
After a long track back they made it to the town. It was small and busy bustling with life. It was like most towns they passed in Nework, people moving around trying to get by and makes ends meet every day. If Steve were any other man, this would probably have been his life. But he had been given a chance to help make a difference instead. Even if a part of him wished he could live a simple life he never regretted his decision in his life.
“Travel stress. You know how it is,” he explained. “I’m trying to ground myself, but you gotta admit, this house is damp.”
“It gets lighter at the ends,” he heard Tony mutter against his neck, and wished there was a reflective surface available to catch his expression. “Did you know?”
This was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far as Tony knew, Howard and Hammer Sr. hadn’t been alone together in a decade, and direct contact between them had been negligible after a rivalrous weapons deal. However, Hammer did not deem it necessary to fact check this. He put his hand around Tony’s shoulder and drew him close.
If you're reading this, you've just gone through a 13K chapter. Whoops. It was either going to be 8K + 5K but the endings didn't quite satisfy...
“Just ‘cause I wasn’t elected doesn’t make me any less real,” Fury grunted. “I convinced him the air was fresher in Tennessee.”
, was the best word for it. Although outwardly resembling the usual QWERTY design, the Y had moved out to the bottom row and changed digs with Z; and the slot for paper had been replaced by three jagged cogs, each with a small, dark screen by its base; and given Steve’s deepening frown, nothing legible was coming out.
He picked himself up again, trailing a finger along the back of the drawer, seeking for an uneven edge. When his fingertips graced it, he tugged — and a dark square of thin wood, exactly the size of the bottom, came loose, revealing three sheets of paper: Tony bent down and rifled through them.
“He didn’t tell me much … I thought you’d hit a rough patch,” explained Bruce, who was rather studiously rubbing at his elbow crease under the folded cuffs of his shirt. “But then … you went and ran into a building on fire. Stupid, but heroic.”
As he crossed the dark street, Sam’s horse looked up from the hitching post, neighed softly, then resumed its dozing. Steve stopped under the porch of Bruce’s house, staring at the chipped paint of the front door, rubbing his throbbing hand, and thought of Tony.
said Bucky, “refer to the time between the crime committed and the moment of capture, or the moment a sentence has been given in court?”
Steve didn’t reply. Instead he felt at his intact chest, gazing past Sam into the rim of the theater’s roof, past which he could see the starless sky. Despite this, Steve thought it had not looked so bright in months. Finally, he looked back at Sam.
“There won’t be a puddle you can cross peacefully in between here and Nova Scotia except the River Styx, should Stane prevail. I know you all have been hoping for a position where you might see a fair bit of action, but this is far more than survey work. Public opinion is what preserves his innocence. The idea that there is somebody out there who might be able, whose
Silence pressed upon his ears as he tiptoed through the dark, echoing hall. He could only see ten feet ahead of him, so that as he reached the foot of the staircase its steps appeared to emerge suddenly out of the oncoming darkness: several feet of polished, smooth balustrade, console tables of deep mahogany decorated with hazardously thin-glassed vases of daisies. He walked ahead and ahead, out towards the left wing, his eyes wide, staring through the shadows around him to the blackness beyond, where a door would be.
“Jarvis must’ve stumbled across one of dad’s, uh, unrefined prototypes,” said Tony. “Sometimes even us geniuses have to scrap an idea—”
In the following silence, the pendulum of the clock ticked and clacked. Tony’s eyes followed its movement, mutinously quiet.
Steve noticed that many of the people who passed them had the same harried look that met Steve every morning in the mirror. Nobody walked alone. Less time was spent talking and, even less than that, shopping. Trade had slowed down as the usual supply lines were cut. On the other hand, a number of questionable, self-contained salesmen had sprung up. The newest one, who had entered the Saloon in hopes of an easy deal, was taking his sweet time in the face of what should have been an instant rejection. Steve feared this one was just the start of a long list of hardship.
Tony could not make up his mind whether the cushions between them were a barrier or a bridge. The sandwiches were finished. Tony no longer had anything to keep his hands busy with.
He swung around. A tall figure laid on the Persian carpet behind a couch. Bathed in moonlight, illuminated in a cold and silvery hue, untouched by the glow of the fire, it was unmistakably a man … it was Tiberius.
“Well, I suspect he suspected. He had a lot of questions after he took that close up look at the papers in my safe. He would’ve made a decent spy.” There was something in his voice that sounded almost
They traded looks; unless United States had suddenly acquired a penchant for rich Starks, they had just identified their old man as their so far most promising lead into Stark Industries’ business.
Steve glanced back at the forge. The fire had spread into all rooms; flames licking behind the two windows at the side caused the building to look alive and menacing, like a beast with glowing eyes. As he considered the flames, he saw Bucky silhouetted against the blaze. His shoulders were slumped in defeat.
“It’s damn bad luck years for democracy. What a Western campaign tour ... someone must’ve put a bounty on his head.”
“… with stipulations?” Steve finished, undeterred. “Of course, you’d hate that, too. You don’t like anything unpleasant, do you?”
The loss that had possessed him since the funeral felt different now. The detachment of death seemed to have nestled in his brain, like a diseased thing, infecting his memories of a father he had idolized, enabling him to see past the rosy lenses into the actions of a distant, emotionally unskilled man. Had spending time with his son truly been so burdensome?  Had he, like Tony, found himself incapable of stomaching mindless questions? Could he have turned his back on a child because it was more convenient to him than learning patience?
Steve squirmed, very much uncomfortable. Nearby, Tony bit off, hard, a large junk off his peppermint stick with an audible snap.
“Funny you should mention him. You have no small task ahead of you, given the only way to cross the country is by train. Do you know who owns the very rails they move on? Railway stocks are the gold mines of today—horsepower has turned into mechanic thrust, and the wealth of men has waned from heritance to ones luck in
“Read on,” urged Clint. “They mention the killer further down. They say it to be a Confederate sympathizer.”
If you liked my writing style, you're welcome to keep tabs on my next possible stories that are as follows:
Leaving his chair, Tony felt Obie’s hand settle across his shoulders once more and he let himself be steered out of the library. He was thankful; the sheer bulk of Obie seemed to act as a buffer between him and any possible attempts at self-promotion, until, at last, the commotion cut off, ceased by the closing door.
“You know their policy is to keep count of the purchases, right?” asked Sam, who now had to raise his over Bucky and Clint’s noises of derision. “And for a good reason—”
Steve, as though startled by the honorific, was brought back on to earth. Then, slowly, his face broke into a smile
Oh, what a time, what a time ... this virus really be taking so long that me, a marathon writer extraordinaire, manages to post not one but two (!!) fics before it is all over. Sigh.
“However,” Jarvis went on, pointing a finger at the picture frame. “I could have sworn this young gentleman bears a startling resemblance to old Master Howard in his thirties…”
“What’re these black spots for?” Clint asked, following with his finger the dotted lines of numbered streets and alleys that were interrupted by many black, star-like marks.
Steve felt as though a stone had slid through his chest into his stomach. He remembered well enough: he had even handled the thing as they moved between fronts. It had brought a feverish flush of power from feeling its powerful kicks onto the faces of his men as they spun the brass crank…
The dog jumped up; for a second Tony thought it had been bothered by their raised voices, but then it barked once, which was the only warning they got before headlights danced across the passage walls from the driveway below the windows.
Outside, where the October air felt cold and fresh after the suffocating blaze, more hands fought him as he tried to get back, to save Tony.
“What’s happened?” Steve asked apprehensively, draping his dusty jacket over his chair just when Clint threw the newspaper on top of Steve’s scattered papers. Steve drew up his chair and picked up the newsprint.
Nothing but the shock of hearing that voice could have had Tony springing to the screen-windowed door. Heartbeat erratic, he gripped the framework. There on the other side stood Inspector Rogers, plainly dressed but soaking wet; the shoulders of his overcoat had turned a muddy brown. His hair looked mussed as if it had been recently tugged at.
In the dark library lit by the slanting shafts of pale evening light, there were dozen-odd chairs pushed in a semi-circle around the large desk the solicitor had laid his brown attaché case on; three people, however, were not sitting: Anna Jarvis, who appeared to have aged more than a month since the funeral, was talking to the head of Maria Stark Foundation; in the background, Obie was going through the shelves, picking books at random and riffling through their pages carelessly.
“If you want to leave by tomorrow, you’d better hurry to catch the train at Julesburg,” he said, turning his back on them.
Steve shook the offered hand. Despite the laugh lines etched onto the man’s face, his eyes were cold. All Steve’s speculation was soon forgotten, though, as Pierce addressed Steve’s group—finally relenting his unfaltering gaze on Steve—and the moment he did so the scowl vanished, and he took in the men and a disguised woman with what looked like amusement.
“… our best lead, who we didn’t even know we had, was lost right on the eve of investigating Stane? That doesn’t seem suspicious to any of you?”
—the adventurous sort. He got that from his father—never stayed still, that man.” Jarvis then said coaxingly, “Has he gone very far, do you think?”
“He had the most curious collection of books at his house,” he said. “The Art of War, a volume on the Comte de Sade, another on Marxism. They can tell a lot about a man.”
Tony stared warily at the car. Mr. Stone was supposed to be in mourning — so what was he doing, sneaking around town, doing trivial tasks better suited to be done by the help? Tony watched closely as the car coasted level with him, then passed, the light filtering through the windows revealing the figure of a middle-aged man, staring resolutely at the road ahead…
There was a long silence. The street had grown quiet, the stragglers that had witnessed the scene had forgot Tony’s presence, and Tony used the cover of astonishment to slip past the grille and into the double fronted shop next-door.
Steve thought he looked drawn, even ill, but although Steve watched him closely for signs of discomfort, only the red goggle-creases marring the corners of his eyes were found.
“I guess I should hand over the ring. It’s officially not mine, by now. How long did it take—just out of curiosity, by the way—for Phil to make it on-record?”
Tony, who did not want to look as though anything odd was happening, seeing as Rhodey had only just stopped thinking he was a frail, weak thing, said, “I’m not afraid.”
“Well, there was a rogue window, but—” another ring, another denial “ — just take a look yourself, this is hundreds of acres of land. A lot of things happen here that I’m not aware of — ”
“Well,” said Tony flippantly, “the enemy of the State is six feet under. I’ve got the company now. I’ve turned on a new leaf, I am
The realization that struck Steve with the force of a battering ram was as staggeringly bright as it was relieving. When Steve’s face, breaking into understanding, snapped back to Tony, he found him already looking back.
Steve mulled this over: how did Stane let a slip like this happen? Had he been so sure of his immunity he took one look at this person he considered nothing but a servant—an old, poor, working-glass man with little connections—and overestimated how deep his loyalty went or, knowing Stane’s modus operandi, how far his bribes carried?
“We should stick together,” Steve began, but showed his unholstered hips under his jacket, nonetheless. Pierce was shaking his head.
The sudden, irrelevant question caught Steve by surprise. He couldn’t tell where Tony was getting at—or if he even knew what he meant by it.
“He’s willing to talk?” Sam said, his breath misting the air. “Is he not aware snitching could cost him his life?”
And soon they came back, a heavily breathing man in tow, who let out a hoarse wail at the sight of Hammer spread out on the floor, stumbling unsteady steps further into the room.
The sun was about to set now; it’s low-hanging light dazzled them even through the distorting glass of the old windows.
Natasha appraised him. For a minute, no one spoke. Steve engaged himself with his drink. He imagined the subject of Tony had been closed, but he was wrong again.
As soon as his shoe was above the threshold, Tony felt the atmosphere in the over-furnished room change subtly. Nest disrupted, thought Tony with satisfaction, preparing to observe the insects scatter.
“H-hey! That was not fair! You broke the rules!” Tony called after him and Steve just laughed heartily at Tony’s antics as the harpy came running up to him and lightly punching Steve’s arm in retaliation.
“What the hell Buck? Why did you threaten him with me! You know how hard I'm trying to get him to like me!” Steve growled looking at his friend as anger boiled deep inside him. He did not appreciate being used as a threatening tool against the harpy. Steve would never hurt any of his teammates or traveling companions deliberately.
Steve saw Peggy and she looked like she wanted to both hug him and lecture him at the same time. He could feel her exasperation and fondness from where he stood. Peggy really was a strong and wonderful woman.
“So Stane is creating bioweapons now? Using people as experiments? If they actually successfully get that potion to work we are doomed,” Tony said after a moment of silence once Happy finished his speech.
They did not talk along the way as Steve lead them both back to the Avengers camp. He was feeling dread as they neared since Steve used most of their money to save Tony from the dreadful place. Steve never understood the value of caging and harming other races for mankind’s greed. They all deserved a place on this planet as much as humans did and it was not right for humans to treat them as second rate citizens in their own territories and homelands.
The first time he put on the ridiculous uniform he could hear Bucky laughing all the way from Europe. Even if his friend did not know of his new found strength and physique, Steve knew Bucky would find this too entertaining. Everything about the uniform felt wrong. Even the shield. Especially the shield. Nothing was right. Still, he was going to help the war by doing this...right? An angry side of Steve said
“It's great to see you Tony,” Steve said instead giving Tony a soft smile, “Pepper wanted you...she wanted you to see the future. She told me before she died that she wanted you to see what you helped create.”
a small voice supplied a few moments after the first thought. Though the real question was does he want to?
“We are in,” Steve spoke up standing up abruptly. Tony stood too, looking into Steve’s eyes trying to figure him out. Even after all this time, Tony did not believe that Steve and the Avengers not only cared for Tony but want to help and assist him in anything he needed.
“Tony should be with...should be with his family,” Steve said out loud talking to no one in particular.
“I don’t know Steven,” she answered weaving her fingers into his hair like she always did when he was younger. Steve closed his eyes trying hard to regain himself again. These feelings kept growing, consuming him. Every night it felt his heart break. Every morning he felt hallowed and lost. No matter how much his mother or Bucky tried to cheer him up.
So Tony ended up meeting papa Rhodes a little later than wanted having shedded the robe he was wearing and wrapped it in a sheet he found hanging to be dried. Better to not let anyone know he was carrying something expensive. So Tony was wearing his simple clothes that Rhodey had left for him to change back into near the back gate. Tony was grateful that Pepper thought ahead and asked Rhodey to slip the clothes somewhere safe for Tony to get.
Everything was going to be fine. Well mostly fine. Now that Tony was back home with his family he will have no reason to continue traveling with the Avengers. Their role in Tony’s story was about to come to a close and it broke a bit of Steve to think it. They were going to move on and Steve won’t have Tony’s smile, Tony’s stories, and ideas or Tony’s playful sparring to look forward to. He couldn’t stand the idea of being separated from Tony. The harpy had become a big part of his day and he always loved it the time he spent with him.
“Not at all Mr. Rogers,” the woman on the other side of the phone said with a calm monotone voice, “since you are Mr. Stark’s live guardian we are here to inform you that he has been synthesized successfully into his new android body.”
They passed the final marker in continued silence and it was not until then that Steve wondered if...if Tony was a forced mute. It was not uncommon for traders to silence captured races due to it being easier for buyers  to see the enslaved creatures as nothing more than exotic pets. Anger sparked in the pit of his stomach hoping that Tony’s voice was something Tony just wanted to keep to himself.
“Hmm, a tool set ya say?” Dum Dum thought for a moment before smiling widely, “Give me eight hours and I will get ya a new set of travel friendly tools and materials. I will give ya a good price for em too but first let me collect the items before setting a price on ‘em.”
Then it happened. Tony had snuck into his lab to look for something when an explosion occurred in the middle of the city. It shook the ground they were all standing on putting everyone on edge. Steve was helping Tony into his workshop when the Steve heard it before he felt it. He pulled Tony to his chest and bent down to secure him in place as the wave of shock coursed through the castle. Tony looked up at Steve confused as to what was happening when they heard guards running towards where they were. Steve cursed lightly but acted quick and held Tony firmly in his arms and jumped out the nearest window which happened to be open.
It was now or never. Steve looked over the stall door to see the stable boy on the other side. He was too far to stop Steve and get in his way of taking the horse. Steve hated having to interact or knock out innocent bystanders like the stable boy.
“So to let you know the gist of who we are,” Steve lead Tony to an empty log indicating for him to sit, “we are known as the Avengers. We are a missionary based group who work on random jobs here and there to get by. Though we take different forms of payments so it’s not always gonna be easy to get supplies and items we may need but it works. Our last mission was a lucky break and we got a good load of coin from it but that was a rare thing to get. But I know you will fit right in with us so you don’t have to worry! We take some getting used to but we are not a bad group of people! Most of us are just trying to do our best!”
Still it did not mean he did not fancy her. She was a strong independent woman. And he liked that. She was the first girl who seemed to remotely ignite any feelings in him other than Bucky.
“You! How? Why?” Tony looked at him pained and Steve understood. Still Tony looked to be calmer and more grounded with him in the same room.
“Fuck me,” Steve rubbed his hands over his face. The anger faded and in its place was sadness and frustration. Just when he thought he had a chance to fix things with Tony. He did not expect to come back to this but then again Tony has been doing everything differently. It was just shocking that Tony was refusing to leave his tent since Steve left. He hoped it wasn't Tony feeling self-conscious about the lake incident. He just realized that he never really got the chance to apologize to Tony for that. Steve had left without speaking a word to Tony having been so worried about Tony's wings. He had decided that Tony would wait but he should have at least apologized.
Dr. Erskine was in the barracks when he got there. The German Doctor looked pleased to see him as he spotted the ice pack, his smile softened. It was odd but Steve liked it when the doctor came to visit. He had finally revealed his intentions for Steve and was waiting for the order for them to head out back to New York for the experiment.
“It always works like a charm,” Steve chuckled before leaning forward and cleaning up the mess Tony had made with his cum. Tony blinked, losing focus as he watched Steve gently roam his hands over Tony’s dirtied stomach with the washcloth.
Tony got up and switched places with Sam and pulled Steve towards him to wrap him in a tight hug wrapping his still growing wings around Steve’s torso keeping them cocooned away from the rest of the team. This was the first time Tony had done this and they were awfully close that Steve could see the small specks of different colors in Tony’s eyes. They were silent for a moment and the world around them washed away. It was serene and Steve felt connected to Tony like he had never connected before.
The engine of the scarlet Cadillac under him roared as he willed it to go past 60. He had passed Andover, then Amesbury, and after them had started a chain of small farming towns split in two by the very road Tony followed westwards. Old Ditton was one of the smallest of the chain, a good hundred miles from London.
“Obadiah Stane?” repeated Jarvis like he hadn’t quite understood Bucky’s question. “I’m afraid I have not seen him since the funeral, sir.”
Tony looked down at the cigarette and kicked it away with the toe of his shoe; a Royce already came squealing out of the open garage as Tony retreated back to the house. As he stepped under the Edwardian arch, he glanced back at the speeding car, and stayed quite still until he couldn’t see a sign of even the seat shroud, then he closed the door behind him.
At this, he glanced back at the detective, as though checking the impact of his witticism, but found the man’s pale brows set into a one, severe line as he followed noiselessly; this brought the small talk into an irredeemable halt which, in turn, lasted until they entered the oblong study.
Next, Steve stared at the forge as his steps took him closer to the remote edge of the town. He was waiting for the moment when Tony would come out of the shop, proving he hadn’t already left without a word. However, Tony did not appear then, and after a while, Steve found himself simply gazing at it out of nostalgy, wondering if the strength of his feelings might penetrate the walls, that Tony would somehow know Steve was thinking of them, not holding a grudge.
“He’s a good man, though,” the other said, a little defensively. “If he was paid piecework instead of wages, there would be no money left in this town—”
“It is not always that one gets asked about their previous places of employment,” Jarvis mused quietly. “Us little people tend to be forgotten about, even by our own masters. I was one of the lucky ones—under Mr. Howard Stark’s roof,” he added, in answer to their questioning looks. “One of the best men. Bright, very bright. He used to tell me I should think of him before divulging any trade secrets. I rather think he was jesting.”
I'm so disappointed in myself. In my defense, though, the space fell clean off my 7 y.o. computer and I had to edit this with the stub that was left in its place. Sigh. You gotta work with what you've got, like they say.
Fury said, half irritably, half proudly, “Two. The bridge delayed the mail, I only got the news a fortnight ago. Still with me?”
“Started three pages ago,” Bruce said, not lifting his head that was still bowed over Steve’s palm. “It’s rather fascinating. They’ve come up with a new theory on tissue regeneration.”
Happy rocked forward. The little girl was hurtling around his legs, squealing in delight and throwing herself into the arms of a laughing Scott, who lifted her up in one, smooth swing, crying, “Cassie!”
Bucky huffed. “Should have used Stark’s, that’s what I would’ve done. Harder to pin down now that everyone and their mother’s got those—now
They soon discovered this was not taken kindly. After the stables, where their shivering horses had been taken to dry indoors, they had walked straight to the main house. At its thirty-feet-long stone entry they were greeted by a housekeeper, who, after bestowing upon them a look of deepest repugnance, briskly lead them upstairs, where Steve found himself gaping at the Rembrandts, Gainsboroughs, Reynolds, and Gobelin tapestries decorating the walls of the staircase.
Steve thought, and was dismayed when the affectionate thought brought with it a rush of dread. It was not Tony’s fault he was a workaholic—Steve had no room to complain—but when it kept him from sleeping, that’s when it became a problem.
“It’s too big,” Tony hoarsely, with half a glance at his ring. “Turns out being held captive is stressful.”
It had been a while since Steve had answered to direct orders from the White House; he only narrowly prevented his body from slipping into parade rest.
“Good, good,” Pierce returned, distractedly, for he was fishing a big set of keys from inside his double-breasted jacket. He got them into the building through another iron gate. When the grille clattered shut behind them, Pierce took off at a brisk pace.
Tony looked bewildered but, freshly caffeinated, followed Steve up the staircase into the second floor of the Saloon and across the landing. Steve knocked on the last door on the right. A muffled, “Come in!” answered them.
“Cap—er, Sheriff Rogers, sir,” said Scott Lang, flustered, but looking at Steve steadily. “The law doesn’t rest, huh? Cool, cool … cool. I said that already, didn’t I?”
Breathing hard and fast, they looked around them. The hall was quickly vacating itself (and not least because of the scorching molten metal spill spreading over the floor) and around Steve, the others, too, were debating the hazard of more explosions in a very much flammable factory. Steve turned to the person next to him and asked a question.
Once in the grounds, having passed under a decorated ranch gate, they still seemed none the nearer. Steve could see several buildings now, nestled between the two steep hills: the stables, cowhand housing and a small chapel. They rode a short way with just the wind passing thought whipping their hair and the horses’ manes. It dried the murky river water lingering on them, leaving behind streaks of white.
Steve felt as though a brick had slid down his chest to his stomach and then risen back up. He remembered now: the divorce papers he had received from Coulson on the day of meeting Jarvis. And now that he thought about it, they were still in the pocket of his light brown jacket he had worn that day, and he had … he had…
Clint’s whistle followed them to the streets, but Tony did not set course to their home. Instead he walked towards the forge.
Sam pulled back his fist, but the man was out for count. Absurdly spread-eagled, he laid there, a red mark starting to bloom high on his cheek while the sand was slowly settling anew, coloring the thief’s white shirt light brown.
“Blind Al’s a paranoiac,” Sam comforted after the silence became too awkward for him to bear. “You do know why they call her that, right? It’s nothing, Steve.”
“Lorrimer rang for him five minutes ago,” said a new voice from the door. “The police are on the way.”
He recognized one as a kind of coded sheet, another as belonging to a Polish patent license. The third was crumbled and in Howard’s own writing; he smoothed it out.
Another silence followed. Just when Tony looked like he would bring some subterranean train of thought to the surface, clicking heels hurried closer and he withdrew back into his shell; Steve all but bit his tongue.
This brought a momentary stiffness in its train. His friend, well into his drink and eyeing Tony beadily, broke the rather awkward silence by saying with slight effort, “Just as I told the police, never trust a foreigner! A matter of time before he went off his rocket, innit?”
it was by chance. He had suspected this. If it were easy, the killer would have left a card on the rug for them to pick up, instead of a body. He set off around the cover of his shelf, trying to catch a sight.
Burying his face in one hand, Steve turned the frame around with the other. The backside read in unfamiliar penmanship:
“It was so good of Mr. Jarvis, bless his poor heart, to try and direct the blame off you, sir, by smartly mentioning the burglary,” she noted conversationally.
And although Steve had his retort ready for when Bruce asked him why he had not simply taken care of it each night, he did not need it: Bruce sat down facing him without a word once the new dressing had been finished. His hand still throbbed, but he was determined to be as detached from it as he was from the hollow in his chest.
Tony hurried past Thor to the door where Steve still stood. He had his hand on the handle when Steve found his words.
Steve hadn’t realized his guilt went so deep that he had thought Steve, too, would hold the misuse of his creations against him. Steve thought of young Tony—orphan, eager to please—being taken advantage of by someone he considered a parental figure, and Steve had to fight to keep his anger at bay, lest Tony misunderstood.
“Did you know I was born prematurely?” he rallied on. “Personally, I think that set the tone for the rest of my life, thrust into new situations unprepared.”
“What do I have to do with you people,” said Fury, looking exasperatedly at their unimpressed expressions. “Present you with a fully sketched masterplan to destroy Earth?”
For Tony had startled awake. The hat toppled off, revealing a wide-eyed Tony, cold sweat on his forehead.
“Just out of curiosity, Sheriff,” Strucker started and hit the papers against the desk before stepping up front. “How many people have you arrested, let’s say, these past six months?”
They trained for a while letting themselves get into the groove for a bit and letting steam out. Tony seemed to have a large amount of pent-up energy that he needed to release and Steve was a great outlet for that. Steve did not go easy on Tony even after finding out that his newest friend was a prince. A prince needed to know how to defend himself and fight. Steve will not let something happen to Tony in a fight because the harpy had not learned how to defend himself. It would devastate him.
It was then that it really dawned on Steve that he had no where for Tony to sleep. He felt bad for forcing Tony to share the same space as him but he did not have another choice until they went into town tomorrow to get some supplies for him. “So you will sleep with me tonight,” Steve said looking at Tony in the eyes. Suddenly the air changed and the tension between them grew. Tony suddenly felt a lot darker and more angry than Steve had ever seen him. He was not sure what brought this on but he hoped Tony would understand why they had to share the same space.
“Hey yourself,” Steve answered giving her his own smile back. He was trying really hard to fall for her. He wanted to so badly. Even more so since they first met. Still that annoying part of him would not relent. If he could he would punch himself in the face. Why does he have to be so damn difficult?
“Something is wrong with Tony. I need to get him some supplies for Bruce to make him a remedy,” Steve answered, “could you...could you get me my travel bag? It would be easier than me having to you know.”
“Does it have to be yours?” Tony bites harshly not really meaning for it come out the way it does. He took a sharp breath and tried to swallow his anger and continued instead saying, “thanks Rogers...for not letting me wake up alone. I-this...this is not how I imagined it to play out.”
With a pop Steve finally let up, allowing Tony a single moment of reprieve before giving his still hard cock more attention. This time though, Steve decided to use his hands and tongue to bring Tony to fruition. He licked Tony’s cock, following each vein and lapped up any pre-come that dripped from the head. It was a show and Tony was addicted and enticed. He watched as Steve wrapped his hand around the base and gave Tony’s dick a hard tug, earning him a quiet gasp.
Steve hurriedly bought as much supplies as he could with the remaining coins that he had on him, the team was not going to be particularly happy about this. Though they will have to promptly get over it since Tony was more important than Clint’s choice of seasonal fruit or Sam’s want for extra copper wires for his pet project. Steve still dreaded the conversation to come but it was worth it to save Tony from those barbarians.
“I love you, sweetheart,” Steve complied easily, bending down to pepper Tony’s stomach with kisses. Tony felt like hiding his flaming face in his hands but if this was just a dream then it didn't matter right? So instead, he dug his hands in Steve’s hair again, forcing him to stay where he was, and trying to lead him to what he really wanted Steve’s mouth to kiss. As if reading his thoughts, Tony felt Steve’s hot breath brush up against the hot skin of his erection. Tony let out a whimper and stilled, waiting for Steve’s next move.
The landing hurt but they made it out of there quick and fast. Steve did not have time to dwell on the pain as he pulled Tony up and began to rush towards the rising smoke. They weaved their way through people running away from the explosion site hands interlocked. Steve guided them to the source of the explosion to see a few bodies lying around with a large hole in the center where a harpy stood in the center completely charred from head to toe. He ignored the dead harpy and instead turned to look at Tony who seemed to have locked his eyes on something to their right. Steve followed his gaze and noticed a familiar face laying close to an intact wall. It was Happy. The harpy looked to be unconscious and bleeding but even from this distance, Steve could see the small rising and falling of Happy’s chest.
“That is swell,” the merchant smiled wide looking creepy and even more disturbing to Steve, “though I would not recommend this one. He is a pesky little thing and does nothing but cause trouble for his previous owners. Had him returned to me three times since I got him...almost not worth keeping around.”
When Steve dived into the arctic waters it felt cold and painful. It was instant. He felt his breath begin to give and his body begin to panic trying to move from his spot but he knew it was too late.
“First you quote Utopia at me, then deny you hit me with an apple and you won’t even give me a name to get to know you by,” the prince began to follow Tony who was trying hard not to run away, “please just a name so I can find you later.”
Steve was so angry that he just left his tent and the camp so quickly that he did not give anyone the time to stop him. He just went to a secluded area and found the largest tree and began to endlessly punched the trunk as hard as he could. There was silence around him. He can only hear the sounds of his fists bouncing against the tree trunk for minutes until he felt the base snap under his hundredth hit and the tree timbered down away from him. He just stood there clenched fists and harsh breaths staring at what used to be the tree he was beating.
“For you Steve, anything,” Dum Dum replied waving at Steve to follow him into the tent. Steve happily did and was lead to a small work table filled with papers and designs. This was their design hub which Steve remembered that Dum Dum had always wanted to work at. It was great to see that his friend was following his dreams.
“You are the best Pepper!” Tony smiled and Rhodey just wrapped his arms around her and pushed her into a hug. Both knew that Rhodey was too lost for words.
After sending redwing to get Clint as the backup, Steve ventured deeper into the forest to get a better idea of what was ahead of them. Steve was glad he had not brought Tony along since harpies and sabers were natural enemies and to see Tony getting attacked with such viciousness would not bode well for Steve’s mental health. But Tony was not here, Steve reminded himself, he was at the small town a few miles away. Safe. There was no reason to worry about it.
“If you continue to zone out I will not hesitate to take my first swing,” Tony warned in jest but Steve just rolled his eyes and they got back to training like they had been for the last few days before Tony’s family arrived and attempted to kidnap him from the Avengers.
Steve walked past the supply tent and towards the circle of other tents reaching the center. It was tight space between the tents to make it practically impossible for intruders to sneak up on them without any of their tents getting disturbed. Each tent had its own characteristics that matched their individual owners and for a moment Steve wondered what Tony’s would look like within the mess of tents. Steve pointed out the water supply, the camping wood, and what exact supplies each of the ragtag team carried as to not catch Tony off guard if he saw any of them. He did this because most of the Avengers carried an arsenal on them and often times could be paranoid at not knowing what the other was carrying. By now it became a force of habit to tell new members this piece of information.
“We have to get moving papa Rhodes,” Tony reluctantly broke the embrace and began to move away from the castle, “I need to get these robes back to Pep and you back to your family.”
“The latter,” Rogers replied smiling sheepishly, “I never expected...wow...what year, is it? Is Star-oh sorry-Howard coming?”
It was not until later that night when the fire went out is when Rhodey brought up the subject. He had been quiet this whole time and just stared at the dying flames contemplating on how to say what he needed to say. The moment he spoke up the group went quiet and tuned into his words, “after Tony was gone Stane, Obadiah Stane, claimed that Tony was too young to understand the nuances of ruling and ran away and that is why he shall take Tony's place. He claimed it would have been what King Howard wanted but he had forgotten how purist the late king was. Pepper, Happy and I grew suspicious and did not believe Stane when he said Tony had run but we had no proof or any way of figuring out what happened. So we dug and dug deep...it was Stand who had set up the hit. He is the one that wanted to you out of the way. I'm really sorry Tony.”
Tony then introduced the harpy to Rhodey’s left as Miss Pepper Potts. She smiled welcomingly but Steve felt like she could take him down in seconds if she needed to. Her aura read a lot like Nat’s did when they first met her. Pepper came forward and urged Steve and the group to call her just Pepper. Nat seemed to be quite happy to know that she was no longer the only independent female warrior around. Steve bowed and complimented her strawberry blonde hair that was immaculate with no strand out of place.
“He will come around eventually,” Sam smiled encouragingly as he sat to Steve’s left. Steve smiled at his good friend trying hard to resist the urge to stare at Tony’s tent. He meant what he had said about not pressuring Tony to join them. Though he really hoped Tony would take Steve on that offer.
Steve had been collecting some coin on the side doing some extra work as the rest of the team called it quits after finishing their daily missions. Steve was saving up money to buy Tony a present. He had seen the harpy fidget and play with items he could get his hands on but it was not until he spotted Tony secretly fixing Sam’s poor redwing gadget that he knew. The light that shone in Tony’s eyes as he picked up redwing carefully from its spot in the makeshift supply tent spoke volumes. The way he studied it and tinkered at it careful not to ruin Sam’s initial design.
The prince was about to respond when someone called for him and Tony took advantage of the prince’s distraction to leave. Tony waited until he was over the bridge before looking back for a moment to memorize the prince’s face one last time. This was probably the last time he will ever meet him again. Shaking his head, Tony left to go find papa Rhodes who was waiting for Tony at the back gate.
“We need to get out fast,” Steve spoke up pulling Happy close to his chest and looking Tony in the eyes. Giving Tony the responsibility to get them out of there seemed to ground him into this moment. Steve could see the click behind those eyes as Tony turned and began to lead the way.
Steve blinked and he was once again back at camp with an annoyed Colonel looking at him as if he had asked him a question. Steve felt his cheeks burn a bit waiting for him to ask the question again.
“Ya laughing at me?” Dum Dum pretended to sound offended but quickly put what he was working on down and paid his full attention to Steve.
Hours passed and Steve’s crying just lead to him to quietly tremble in Bucky’s arms. It did not feel right but he bit back those feelings and let himself be carried to bed. A part of him was disgusted even. Gosh he was a horrible friend. Steve stiffened himself and let Bucky drape him on top of his chest. They often did this since Steve’s bed was never big enough to sleep the two of them separately.
“This way,” Tony whispered into Steve’s ear as Tony pressed up against the door and gave the soft signal to Pepper. A few long moments later, the door was propped open and the Avengers moved into the castle. Their plan was ago.
“Hi,” he finally replied looking at his feet. She was pretty but it didn’t sit well with him at all. A part of him kept screaming
“Father,” Tony tried only to get backhanded across the face. Tony fell to the floor on his hands and knees. He tasted blood.
“Fuuuuuck,” Tony rolled the word off his tongue as he felt the vibrations of Steve’s chuckle over his dick, making it even harder to keep himself together. This man really was gunning to have Tony instantaneously combust.
Steve doesn’t know if they are or will be truly prepared to face down Stane and his growing army of harpies while being as nonlethal as possible. But he will do his best to get Tony to save his people even if it meant dying in the process.
As he came down from his high, Tony forced himself to refocus. He closed his eyes for only a moment, letting himself bask just one last time before he had to burst the bubble. “So...well...wow,” Tony spoke as Steve came back from the bathroom with a wet towel and gave Tony a smug smile.
“The path for you is clear Steffan,” the soothing familiar yet foreign voice whispered in his mind, “we will meet soon. Wait for me.”
They made it to camp and they parted ways. Tony left to his tent while Steve went looking for Bucky and Sam. Those two always seemed like they were up to no good and seemed determined to prove something that neither of them is willing to tell Steve. He found them both bickering near the supply tent. Those two always could be found throwing insults at the other while simultaneously saving the other’s life. It was a skill they had perfected since day three of meeting.
Tony felt panic build in his chest trying to figure out how to get papa Rhodes back. The man began to move again when Tony cried, “I can pay for him good sir! I have twenty gold francs!”
The sun had long set when Steve went back to Dum Dum’s work table. He was nervous since it was Steve’s first real gift to Tony that did not include essential living supplies. Dum Dum was sitting on his stool studying something through a small hand held telescope. It was a funny to see a large man holding something as delicate and small as a small metal piece through a small telescope. Steve could not help a small chuckle escaping his lips.
Howard fucking Stark. If he wasn’t already dead Steve would have found a way to beat his ass and get away with it. Still, Steve was angry at Tony for taking away his choice. For making that decision for him. He had no
That night Steve dreamed about him. About the mystery man he sometimes called Anton. He would stand next him and press himself closely to Steve. Steve let the man take control. Let him talk to him. Sooth him. It was almost heartbreakingly peaceful. The man said things he did not fully understand but it made him feel comforted all the same.
Jarvis grabbed Tony and lifted him up to his hip. The butler carried Tony over to the snacking table grabbing a plate and handing it over to the young genius. Tony took the plate. It was cold to the touch just like how he felt inside. Distracted a little he almost did not notice Jarvis holding out a piece of fruit tart towards him. Straightening out the plate Tony watched silently as Jarvis began to slowly fill the plate with food. Tony loved being handled like this. It made him feel loved even for a short while. Even if he knew it was not really real. If his own father cannot love him then no one could. Tony was not worth the love of anyone, really.
Steve stared into the trees for a moment in fear. Tony never talked about his kind and it was odd to Steve because Tony seemed to have talked about everything else except that which made Steve worry even more. It is known that harpies are very isolated as a species and to catch a harpy they would have to have been sold out by their own, abandoned when young or lost. Steve had a feeling that Tony was betrayed by his own kind and seeing them take him away brought an on a panic within him.
“If you are the prince than…you didn’t actually run away from your crown like the stories were told,” Steve had not realized he spoke those words out loud until the rest of the team turned to look at him. Steve locked eyes with Tony feeling ashamed for believing those stories instead of striving for the truth.
“Sam,” Steve smiled in relief as he laid back down letting Tony settle back on his chest without further complaint instead he just wrapped his arms carefully around Tony to keep him in place.
Tony led Steve back to there booth and showed him what he was working on. Focusing on Tony’s words and hands was a good way to help soothe him. Not long after, Steve left the rest of them to continue their work while he went to drop off the artifact to the client.
“I know but I am scared. I already have been walking on thin ice already,” Steve sighed getting up from his spot next to Bucky. His friend patted him on the leg in encouragement as he went back to tying the logs correctly and securely.
“Sounds great Dum Dum,” Steve smiled elatedly. He was excited to see what Dum Dum would get him, this was quite important to Steve. This was the first real thoughtful gift Steve was going to get Tony and it would mean a lot if it was good quality items.
“Nah I got a date of my own and I don’t want to have your sorry ass chasing off my Valentine with your sulking,” Sam replied easily making Steve laugh. His friend did know how to cheer him up a bit.
Bucky and Steve got to Steve’s room without a word spoken between them. It was odd since Bucky almost never stayed silent long enough to leave Steve in his own head so having him there but not talking was strangely haunting. So Steve began to babble instead. He needed to the silence to go away. He needed the noise of life around him even if that source came from him and Bucky. Still Bucky stayed quiet and listened. Steve began to hyperventilate thinking his friend thought badly of him now. That he thought he was no longer worth it. Maybe he made Buck feel like he was not good enough. Damn Steve was a bad friend.
There it was again. That vague reference to a hidden person he feels like he knows but cannot grasp to remember.
The angry man turned to rebuttal only to be faced by the deeply angered face of their prince. The man instantly bowed trying to explain himself calling papa Rhodes and all the men in the cart ‘thieves’ but it seemed that the prince did not buy any of his ridiculous excuses. A part of Tony preened and a part of him growled angrily. Tony did not need an alpha or even the prince to save him. He could have handled this situation on his own!
Tony looked at Steve's hand and back at Steve's face before shifting forward and moved out of the cage without so much as touching Steve's outstretched hand. Steve looked at his empty hand not really knowing what happened but he got Tony out of the cage which was good. The harpy was sitting next to him looking  at him warily. Steve wanted to take off those cuffs but he did not want to risk it within the town’s boundaries. People tend to be a little cowardly at the thought of a nonhuman in chains and some would outright try to kidnap them for their own. No, Steve could not risk it. He will have to wait until they leave town before those clunky, heavy cuffs can come off. To assure Tony’s safety.
The fight seemed like it would go on forever but soon enough the sabers retreated after they took down thirteen of their kind. Steve was breathing hard standing in place still feeling the rush to fight but the fight was over, for now.
Then came Happy. He stood up straight, placed his arms behind his back as he gave Tony an oath to get to the bottom of any and all sources no matter what. He promised to bring the Avengers distance communicators that Tony had bought from the panthers long ago and stashed in his secret lab.
It was that moment that Steve realized that he was in love with Tony. He had been this whole time, from the moment he had met him. Steve was hooked. And it broke him to even think about leaving Tony behind and continue as an Avenger without him.
“What time is it anyway?” Steve grumbled yawning. He tried to lie down again but Bucky wrapped his arm around his shoulder forcing him to stay up. Steve glared at his friend trying to burn his arm off his shoulder but does not move to take it away.
Tony was already halfway dressed and even as Pepper gave him nervous glances he was not going to stop now. “This is crazy,” Pepper commented moving away from the windowsill, “you are going to get yourself on the boat with him! Why did I agree to this!”
“He is talking about Tony Thor,” Nat cut in helpfully taking the burden away from Tony. It seemed hard for Tony to speak those words out loud. Tony smiled gratefully at her and she gave a small smile in return.
“I didn’t need a chance of good health and perfect life,” Steve growled, “I was satisfied with what I got because I had you. You were all I needed. All I wanted. I almost backed out because of how devastated I was to lose you! What if I had! Everything you did would have been for
“Yes,” Tony began to understand a little bit more of his situation but was still weary. Tony had convinced Pepper to join him in this program so that they could come back togeth-wait Pepper! Where’s Pepper? Tony looked around desperately. He leapt out of his bed in a hurry looking for his wife fighting off all the personal that came towards him. He needed to get to Pepper. She would be expecting him.
Bucky came back and handed him his travel bag looking worried and concerned. Steve understood. They all have come to enjoy Tony’s quiet company and liked having him around. They considered the harpy one of their own now and when one of them got sick the rest did everything in their power to get them better. Tony was no different to them now.
Rhodey pulled Tony's forehead to his and had whispered some loving words and telling him that they will be together again. Tony closed his eyes and let Rhodey's words wash over him. Steve could see the tears Tony finally let fall.
It was a bit bumpy this time around but Steve considered this mission a success. No one can blame him for knocking out the villager who made the horrible comment about Tony on his way back though. He was big and strong now he did not have to worry about being on the losing end ever again.
Being who he was, Tony did what he usually did in any situation, and tried to move and get a better assessment of where he was. The moment he began to squirm, the arms around his waist tightened and a tired grumbly voice spoke up behind him, “It’s Sunday sweetheart. You promised no getting up until past noon.”
“Okay boss,” Happy rasped out sounding tired but determined as he placed the bowl down on his lap, “I got lots to tell you.”
Just when Steve began to doubt himself and felt that he may have overstepped, Tony wrapped his fingers around the bag strap. Steve watched silently as Tony took the bag, rushed to his bed and began to instantly dig through it happily. It was a wonderful site to see Tony light up at each tool and beam happily at him. Though he slowly realized that he was rudely staring at the harpy as he enjoyed his gift. Steve scrambled and sat down looking away from Tony, face heating up and embarrassment set in.
And Steve dived into the pool and he was gone into the abyss of memories. He was going to be fine. He will be with Bucky again.
It was Rhodey’s sister who noticed them first. She paused in her work on the small part of the farm they still used to stare openly in their direction. As if she by instinct without turning away she patted her mother on the back. Mama Rhodes looked up annoyed about to berate her youngest daughter only to follow her sight to spot papa Rhodes. The sight of her fidgeting excitedly with tears in her eyes before rushing over to her husband and alpha warmed Tony’s heart. Papa Rhodes let go of his son to rush towards her with open arms taking her all in as she wrapped her arms around him in glee. Papa Rhodes twisted her in the air the best he could showering her in kisses and whispers of ‘I love you’.
a female voice shouted in his mind. She sounded desperate. And angry. Her words filled Steve with the urge to fight. He felt like he needed to throw a punch. Guess it was time to head to the fighting grounds. There must be some other recruits still up for a one-on-one fight.
Steve almost didn’t believe him but if Tony said they were good then he will take his word for it. He will, though, watch the group like a hawk until they prove themselves not to be a danger or threat to Tony or the rest of the team.
“Yeah I figured you would recognize them,” Tony said placing his open palm hands on Steve's folded thighs, “the gloves help me control the blasts and manage them the way I want. They concentrate the blasts to where I want them to go.”
“Let’s go to the diner we have reservations at and talk,” Steve just spoke quick noticing Tony begin to turn away. Tony stopped and turned to Steve looking at him with wide hopeful eyes. Then something shifted and Tony had his guard up again. This was going to be a fun night.
Tony just nodded with an encouraging smile on his face. Steve really wanted to keep that smile on Tony’s face. It was rare and even more so to have it directed at him. He really was a lost cause.
Steve stood up and smiled shyly as he stood alone over knocked out or groaning harpies. Everyone was too busy staring at Tony to really care.
Tony scooted up to Steve the moment Steve freed him from his grasp. Steve couldn't think with Tony trying to proposition him. And it was then that the reality crashed on top of Steve. It was hard not to see it now that he saw it. Tony was...Tony thought Steve was his
Tony actually laughed at Steve’s answer sliding into the other side of the booth the hostess led them to. The waitress came a few minutes later to take their order giving both Steve and Tony time to recollect themselves. Steve loved how easy it was to fall back into what they had but he needed to know why. Why Tony left him. It was a question that had bothered him for a long time.
Steve had a mission to finish. He was going to do it even if it cost him his life. Bucky deserves justice. Deserves to have Hydra burn to the ground.
Steve was looking to the ground when he heard a female british voice saying, “Gentlemen, I'm Agent Carter. I supervise all operations of this division,”
Truth was, Steve was a bit excited for this date. He knew it was always worth giving something a shot. Though the last time he was really serious about a relationship it didn’t end so well. Even the thought of them brought a pang to his chest. Steve knew he will always love them but it was probably time to actually move on.
Steve listened to Dum Dum as he brought out the rest of the items he had requested and explained how they work, what they were and what they were needed for. By the end of it, Dum Dum assured Steve that this was all that a traveling mechanic would ever need on the go. This was exciting and Steve hurried to put all the items Dum Dum got him carefully into the travel bag. After making sure the bag was not going to be too heavy for Tony to carry around, Steve asked Dum Dum the price of all this was.
Finally, the truck came to a halt and Steve heard noises as the driver talked to someone who seemed to have stopped them. Steve looked through the little flap to see nothing but plain grasslands and trees. It was an isolated place, his camp, and he felt a bit nervous. He never left New York in his life. This was new and he was essentially alone. A part of him wished he had stayed in New York but a larger part of him said that he needed to do this. He never really knew why but he just knew that he was meant to be a soldier. To fight in this war.
Tony needed to get out of this room. He needed to clear his mind and try to put what just occurred to the back of his mind. After refocusing on the world around him, Tony noticed Steve had just finished cleaning him up to his satisfaction and was pulling away to go get ready. In a desperate move, Tony grabbed Steve’s wrist and pulled him into a hot searing kiss before pulling back and giving Steve a smile.
“I think I saw him heading towards the lake,” Clint said stepping out of his newly made tent, “think he might be getting water or something.”
“Prince? Thor doesn’t need no bodyguard,” Clint glared back at Happy who gave Clint a challenging look. The rest looked around confused not knowing what Happy meant by the prince. No one-
Steve wore his nice blue button down shirt that showed off his body in all the right places. According to Sharon, it was his greatest buy. He paired it with simple black slacks, his nicest shoes and his only expensive accessory, a watch that his ex had bought him long ago.
The harpy had olive tanned skin, a handsome face, and the most beautiful golden brown eyes he has ever seen. His body looked ready to give up but those eyes, Steve could still see the fire burning in those eyes. The harpy looked ready to break but Steve knew that even with all the scars the harpy would not fold. It was truly breathtaking.
“You are just saying that because all your teammates are here! You don’t care what happens to Rhodey or Pepper! I need to save them! Let me go, Rogers!” Tony shouted putting all his efforts into trying to get out of Steve’s impossible grip.
Tony was still apprehensive and quite shy and although he had been given the option to leave and travel on his own, he stayed. Though Clint always jokes that it’s because Tony spots Steve’s sad puppy eyes and is feels too guilty to leave Steve behind but Steve thinks otherwise. Tony seemed to not fully be comfortable or relaxed around the team but he looks less calculating and scared. It was a good step towards getting Tony to feel like he was a part of the team. Steve just felt himself preening everytime Tony turned to him or walked up to him or came near him. He was so happy.
The sound of a tree branch close by cut off their conversation. Usually, if it were one of their own they would call out their name and let the rest know not to worry but this time...this time the crack was followed by absolute silence.
The first thing he sees when he opens his eyes is a white dull ceiling. It was odd that he could see every detail of all the different items in his immediate sight and process them at a speed he never could before. Guess they figured out how to revive him because he was pretty sure he died. This body was different. Not the same. He could tell because he did not have the small aches and pains he got from old age or the toll of  the years of superheroing. It was like he could not feel them at all.
Steve came back from his last missions dog tired but he didn't mind it. He will get a good bath in the small river running next to their camp later. Bucky immediately handed him a plate of food that they had made for dinner. His best friend raised an eyebrow at Steve but the blond didn't answer him. The only way to keep a secret surprise in this team was to keep it to himself. They all somehow found a way to ruin them without much effort.
“Why is that?” Steve glared at her. This conversation was starting to go south real fast, “is it because I am skinny? Or short? Or too sickly? Tell me what right do you have to tell me that I cannot fight for what I believe to be right.”
“I know, what would I do without you, but no,” Tony paused his face turning serious, “I know your mistress has an omega son about my age. I need you to borrow one of his dress robes for me!”
His commanding officer noticed right away at how good Steve was at reading the field and how fast he strategizes his next step. So on the side, the man took Steve under his wing and taught him about military maneuvers and basic strategy techniques. Steve seemed to soak it all up quick and adjusted his own strategies by figuring out what worked and what did not. He found it stimulating and fun and it helped him feel a bit useful.
“Tiring,” Steve shrugged still not giving anything away. Tony just quietly sat next to him holding a cup of what Steve figured was Clint's disgusting drink he tries to pass as coffee.
Steve turned to look at Tony trying to give him a reassuring look as he stepped towards him but the harpy just stood stock still. Tony grew more nervous as Steve approached him with the keys to shackles in plain visible sight. Tony watched his hands like a hawk ready to fight at any given chance.  Steve wrapped his fingers over Tony’s wrist pulling him towards him feeling Tony stiffen more than he was before as if waiting for something bad to happen. It was hard for Steve but he made sure not to make any sudden movements as he inserted the key into the lock and turned it as slowly as he could letting Tony follow his hands with his eyes.
He turned to look at himself in the full length mirror and he almost did not recognize himself. The robes were long and heavy as if reminding him of his task at all times.
Walking back to camp was hard and tiring. All he wanted to do was crash on his cot and sleep for a week. Still, he pushed on leading the saved troops to the army base camp knowing full well that he will either be seen as a hero or an idiot who got himself discharged from the military for going against orders.
“What did you just say? Did you just call Tony your pet?” the harpy growled and it seemed like he was angry for Tony not at him.
Steve wanted to wipe that sneer off the merchant’s face. So he forced himself to focus on something else and looked back at the harpy who looked at him with mistrust and anger. They shared the same eyes, Steve realized. He was once a slave and he knew that look very well. So Steve decided he was going to buy him if he could. “How much?” Steve asked hating himself for having to buy another person like this.
“Tell the rest of the team to come out and I will introduce you guys to the people I consider my family,” Tony said and a small pang of hurt coursed through Steve at those words. He wanted to be a part of that family but for Tony to use those words...these harpies must be very precious to Tony.
“You sleep there for the night,” Steve spoke though he was pretty sure Tony had made up his mind that he was, in fact, sleeping there whether Steve had an objection to it or not. He chuckled softly as Tony climbed under the covers enthusiastically with a small screech of happiness. Steve lay on the couch and soon fell asleep as well to the small sounds of Tony’s breathing.
“Isn’t your three-year anniversary soon?” Clint suggested after a beat. “Maybe your boy’s cooking up a surprise,” he said, and made a vulgar gesture that suggested what kind of surprise he was envisaging.
“Oh,” Steve said unenthusiastically, “well, we’re doing the best we can. Did you hear the wires might be back up soon?”
Natasha leaned over the counter to grip his resting forearm. Her red hair became backlit by the lights behind, gaining the appearance of a fiery halo. This sudden likeness to fire was of no comfort to Steve.
He trailed off, for, after reaching out to shake Tiberius awake, his hand had instead of drunken slackness met with stiff muscles.
On the riverbank, townsmen had already formed a long line that moved like a wave as men and women passed pails of water between them down from the river up into the towering flames. But the fire was too strong, their attempts too futile, and their pails too small. The bridge blazed for another minute in front of the town’s disbelieving eyes, until finally collapsing into the river, leaving only smoke curling in the air. The night turned dark again.
Steve bit his lip, swaying on the cusp of gathering enough courage to take the leap, when a voice shouted, “Sheriff!”
“You faking it is no excuse for how I acted,” Steve started hotly. “Bad memories or not I shouldn’t have pushed you like that—”
And in the instant that he clicked the torch on, his eyes raking the closed door behind him, he saw the outline of white-and-brown brogues at the end of the shelf; surprise made him turn and panic paralyzed him as he saw the ankles and trousers stretching horizontally behind the corner.
So, he snuck through the hall, and into the drawing room, studiously not looking at the dark spill on the floor.
“There now, Steve,” she purred. “Don’t you feel a lot better now that you’ve worked all those bottled emotions out?”
“Of course, but it is Tony we’re talking about. When has he ever been a functional part of society?”
When turned on his heels, Steve heard what he suspected to be a discreet victory dance; a shuffle that sounded like boots dancing against sandy ground; and he allowed Scott this moment of giddiness by not turning around to confirm it.
“Us Pyms can trace our wealth and lineage to Dutch aristocracy of the eighteenth century,” the first voice said, seemingly echoing around the gilded trims and details. “Not to mention your mother—a van Dyne!”
The room below seemed to be a combination of cellar and garage, and as such, was bare-walled and windowless. Though very cluttered and thoroughly utilized, the room somewhat resembled their family mausoleum on the unforgettable occasion that his parents’ bodies had been laid to rest inside sealed stone. There was a stack of rotors on a plugboard, and an engine Tony deduced to belong to his father’s Mercedes, due to the unique shape of the pimped-up exhaust manifold. Wrapped bunches of cables long enough to make the way to London and back, all bobbing in the breeze he had brought in with him, hung from hooks screwed deep into the cement wall.
The stiff leather of his new shoes kept creaking, and at the cellar stairs, he pulled them off. He turned the door handle silently and crept into the hall.
Scott looked from the station building to the tracks disappearing into the horizon. Then he lifted a stubborn jaw at Steve.
“A great man, for sure, but blind. At least that husband of his had the decency to leave, knowing as how we know he did it.”
“Despite the civil casualties, it was clear that Howard Stark had always been the intended target, suggesting it was done by radical opponents of his new direction in social justice. But to kill the whole family … what an unnecessary waste of life. But Anthony survived, did he not? The problem is, according to every practitioner of medicine and several other scientists, he
Yet, barely detectable over the sound of his heavy breathing, Steve’s ears registered a strange sizzle. His warning never left his abused throat; horror-struck and cursed by his only human reflexes, he was forced to watch as Tony’s propped arms buckled under him. And although the bad in the world had been conquered, although the good had prevailed, the day claimed its last victim when Tony sagged forward, quite lifeless, onto the foot of the church.
Still, Steve saw Happy hover as they withdrew indoors. They lead Jarvis to their desks, arranged so that there were room for five chairs in the middle. Showing an admirable presence of mind, Sam rushed to cover the fifth in a wool blanket for Jarvis who seated himself gratefully, leaving Sam, Clint, Bucky and Steve to squeeze side by side on the facing chairs.
Depleting the male voices, until only women and some of the older men were sitting and one side of the Town Court was practically empty. Finally, having entirely redone their knitted scarfs and hats three times each, even the women seemed unable to any more reasons to delay: they left the courtroom, disappearing into the wind-swept, snowy main street in troops.
“Hey, pal,” he cheered in a drawl. “What a small world we live in, right? Right? As for myself,” he went on, rather importantly, “I’m here to collect a big order for a — well, I don’t know if you heard that it’s a grand time for a knees-up in honour of, well…”
The flashlight fell from his numb fingers as he hastened to point the beam; it spun to the floor, its light dancing dizzyingly around the room as it clattered about and was extinguished; then the library door opened behind him: a pool of light fell on the floor … onto the unconscious body of Justin Hammer.
Now, both their attention turned to their captives. They seemed to be assessing them all, one by one. For a moment, nothing happened.
“No hard feelings, sonny,” he said with easy confidence to Natasha, reaching a hand towards her. “It’s nothing personal—”
“Correct. Mr. Strucker, perhaps counsel should be advised that the Sheriff is not the defendant in this action,” Coulson said calmly, but Strucker had drawn himself up, clutching his breast pocket, looking livid.
He touched Steve’s chest in awe, and Steve wondered how many more Pyms were going to take liberties as Scott’s eyes followed the shape of him. Then Scott seemed to shake himself out of it.
No promises for chapter 7, other than that I will not abandon this, ever. We will bring this story to finish line, whatever it takes lol
“Oh, you two got acquainted?” said Tony, who had maintained the same light tone throughout the conversation. “You know, then, that Obie organized to have you killed if I didn’t leave with Scarface and Monobrow?”
The man then leaned closer to his friend, as though to share something conspiratorial, unaware of Steve’s frozen, appalled presence.
“You know I like paying attention to your projects,” Steve defended. “I like pointing them out before you have the chance to announce them. But sometimes I wish I did not have to fear that you’ve, I don’t know, knocked down a
The shock of losing the bridge and their forge hung over the town in the days that followed. Urged by necessity, anyone capable of holding a tool had partaken in the project to build a one-man raft to move produce across river, but its modest mechanics had not held well against the unyielding force of the current—a fact which was part of the reason why their smith’s absence was met with much scorn. Steve still startled every morning upon seeing the blackened skeletons of the fire on his way to work where his deputies kept shooting worried glances behind his back.
“A letter for the Yard,” offered Steve, apropos of nothing, as Tony made his entry known. “It’s never good when they’re involved.”
Thor, who had just come from the backroom bringing a scent of a warm meal with him, paused on his way to greet Steve.
“Huh?” Tony said vaguely; he was still perched precariously on his stool, immersed in his newest project.
“Well, it’s just the two of us again,” said Tony, hands tucked in his pockets — but before the last words had left his lips, Everhart entered, leaving Tony to shoot her a reflexive glare.
He started to lead the way to the left wing with a calculated stroll. A silence spread between them in uneasy ripples. It wasn’t until they were past the landing that Rogers went for an attempt at pleasantry.
He heard a door close and a moment later the formal-clothed form of his butler had climbed down the blue-carpeted staircase into the hall, bearing a duster and a reproving expression.
“The old were falling apart, you see. Served me well for eight years, they did.” He gestured at a height from his knee to his shoulder and said, “Saw me barn grow from here to here during, and all.”
“If you’re going to steal him for the night, you’ll have to get in line,” he said, effectively ending the conversation.
“It is a fraud! Favoritism!” he bellowed, pointing at Steve. “First the mail is late! Now the water is so cold that in order to cross it, one has to turn himself into a human icicle, and you, Rogers, are purposefully withholding the prosecution because the culprit was a friend of yours! This is not justice! This dog
Something was going on. Three weeks ago—it felt like much more, but it had been three, lonely weeks—Tony had told him how much he suffered from having nothing to do. And tonight, for the first time in two years, Tony had come home drunk. What did these things mean?
“Ah!” cried Tony. “And that’s why you snooped around the study! They aren’t mine — well, technically speaking.”
The new light, although very small and cool, was much brighter than their old lamps; it dazzled Steve’s eyes even through the glass. It lit Tony’s face with a glow that accentuated the flush of his cheeks. Despite this, his pupils were blown.
“Not to worry,” Coulson had said. “It is merely a formality. We can’t make exceptions, not even for a man of your … pedigree.”
“We didn’t exactly share a social class,” Steve said dryly, and started to skim until he reached right column. Here, Steve’s eyes flied over the words: a short listing the injuries the body had sustained, including the description of the fatal wound, found during the autopsy of the deceased.
Tony sucked on his tongue, though the reminder somehow hurt less coming from the mouth of Barnes, than it had from the man still hovering tall behind Tony.
“I’m saying he could have gone on his own will before it came to that,” Bucky said. “He’s never been known for his skills at self-preservation.”
Tony did not answer straight away. Nevertheless, he felt the air between them thicken: Tony’s refusal to play into Tiberius’ goading was a refusal to allow him to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Tony could tell Tiberius took it as such.
After a while of sitting around the fire, Steve felt a soft press against his side and he looked down to see Tony’s head resting against his shoulder as he fell asleep by the campfire. Steve was tempted to comb his fingers through Tony’s feathers. He looked up instead and spotted both Sam and Bucky sitting across from him with knowing smirks on their faces. The fuckers. Steve wanted to wipe their looks off their faces. Instead he just felt his face heating up. Damn his pale complection.
The operation took months. They each had a role to play in this whole scheme. Sam and Bruce gained the common folk's trust through quick trade and smithing. Nat would work as a waiting lady for many of the noblemen to gather information that might slip through other's notice. Bucky and Clint took odd jobs that required their skills and created a reputation for themselves among the common folk. Thor and Steve stayed behind with Tony in their small hidden base camp gathering all the intel and figuring out their next moves.
“We were supposed to do this together,” Tony cried out, “that was the plan! What am I supposed to do now Rogers?”
“Good morning Mr. Stark,” a female voice spoke. Tony looked to the side and gasped. The person next to him was clearly not human and a part of him panicked that he has been taken hostage by aliens but he held it back. There was no use in panicking in this situation. If he were in danger he could figure out how to get out of here and back home. He always found a way back.
It was a stupid decision that lead him here. Really. It was. He knew, with almost absolute certainty, that the suit prototype he was wearing was not ready for prolonged use. But he still wore it. Still took it out for a spin. Now Tony Stark is stuck, wounded on an abandoned man-made island off the coast of somewhere, not sure how to proceed.
Tony’s mind screamed in confusion, hating how much he wanted it to be true. This was the man who had left him in Siberia; the same man who had slammed his shield down on him. Why did he still want him so badly?
“I remember buying that watch,” a familiar voice spoke up to his right. Steve turned his head so fast he felt a twinge of pain crawl up his neck as he looked into the other’s eyes. It was his ex-Tony, the man he still couldn’t really let go of.
“Hey,” Steve took Tony’s shaking hands into his own, “we need to calm down and get Happy out of here. I don’t know if somehow Stane knew about Happy’s betrayal was trying to get rid of him.”
Tony broke the glass covering his face to keep the glass shards from hitting him directly. He could have made something to open windows without the hassle but like he mentioned before it was the spurt of the moment to do this. Either way, the job was done and he was in.
His phone rang. Steve paused for a moment to assess the distinctive ring. He did not hesitate to answer in an instant worried, “hello? Is there something wrong? I could have sworn our appointment was in a month.”
Steve gave the signal and the Avengers attacked. Thor and Steve rushed in quick enough that the harpies didn't have time to react properly and they were taken down but the rest caught on quick and it was a full-on chaos. The civilian harpies rushed out of the way some leaving the throne room while others just watched from the corners. The fight was chaotic and messy but the Avengers had the upper hand. Stane tried to run but Clint fired an arrow which shot through Stane’s leg and into the stage.
“You like that don’t you? Being brought to the edge and then slowly tipped over to completion,” Steve said as he began to earnestly stroke Tony off. He kept his eyes locked with Tony. Tony blushed in response, feeling like he was about to boil over but he couldn’t look away. Steve kept Tony right where he wanted him.
“Remember no lethal shots,” Steve started pulling all his teammates’ attention to him, “only stunning or lightly injuring. Most of these harpies are not doing this of their own free will so let’s do them a favor and make sure we get them out of the way without any pain. Our target is Stane and any member of the council loyal to him. The harpy kind needs to be saved from the tyranny and horror of Stane and his regime and that is what we are going to do. We may be few in number but we have taken more of this kind of thugs for lesser reasons. Let’s save Tony’s people and give them back their freedoms and liberties that they lost.”
“We are a rag tag group,” Bucky turned his attention back to Tony, “we are all from different walks of life so you will fit right in.”
“Mr. Stark please come back to bed,” Anita, Tony’s mind supplied helpfully, insisted as she crouched next to him.
His father did not did not acknowledge him as he walked away towards Jarvis. Tony felt a small pang in his heart as he spotted a small smile form on Jarvis’s lips as he neared. He wished his own father could smile like that at him. The only time he saw anything close was when his father talked about Captain Freaking America. Man, Tony was only six but he could already tell that he did not like the man. He generally did not like anyone his father liked, so Captain America was quite high on his dislike list.
“It's not my problem little man! You should not even be here! How did you get passed the army's tests? You're the reason why I think we need better regulations on who gets in,” the man replied and Steve felt his anger begin to fester. Still, he reigned it in not really wanting to start of his military career on a fight.
“Steve,” Sam came up next to him ready to go with his battle armor already on, “talk to us man. We can’t do anything if you don’t let us in.”
“We got a long day ahead of us for travel. The city of Brook will be in our sights by sunset,” Steve informed Tony as he forced himself to get out of the comfortable spot he was in. He could still feel the warmth of Tony against his side and it was a wonderful feeling.
It was not hard to imagine that Steve was so happy and relieved at those words that he pulled Tony in for a kiss again whispering ‘I love you’ softly into those lips over and over again for what seemed like a long time.
Steve watched Tony stare seriously into Pepper’s eyes for a long time as he processed her words. Whenever the mention of Stane Tony seemed to go a little stiffer and his frown deepens just a little more. The vile harpy must have meant a great deal to Tony if the mention of his name caused such a reaction. Steve wanted to meet Stane and show him what real strength was and how to be in command of a group of people. To think of using cruelty and tyranny to try to gain power for the sake of power was sickening. The harpy kind did not deserve such treatment or hardship thrust upon them. If Steve had any say in what happens he readily has his shield in hand and ready to use to punch some vile harpies. He was an Avenger, they all were in his book, and as an Avenger they had an obligation to save every person they can and never to stop until they breathed their last breath.
“If not the Erskine trials then when you decided to apply to jobs that could lead you to a better life! It didn’t matter. Howard would have found a way to ruin you. And I couldn’t live with myself knowing that you couldn’t live your dream because you had chosen me. I...I didn’t want you to come to resent me for it,” Tony ended the last sentence in a whisper causing all Steve’s anger to flush away.
Tony watched Jarvis dip the cloth into the dirtying water with very tired eyes. He wanted to sleep but he knew he could not unless he was cleaned up. He had learned his lesson early to always make sure the injuries were treated. If they were not it could end with a hospital trip and those are never fun. He was running out of lies to tell the doctors when they would examine him. He almost confessed the truth to a doctor, which ended up getting him more lashes after he left the hospital. Though Tony never understood how doctors, who claimed to be educated, could believe the lies he tells. Tony always weaved them in a way that there was a chance of doubt but every single one of them just blew off the doubt.
Bucky came into the tent and told Steve that Sam found them another job. Tony placed his gloves in the bag and followed Steve out of the tent saying, “geez can't two men get some alone time in a tent?” Steve and the rest found themselves chuckling and for a moment Steve felt Tony's hand brush up against his.
Steve was buzzing in place but didn't dwell long enough since a moment later the elevator doors opened waiting for him to get out. He rushed out not giving people enough time to interact with him. He didn't care about them he cares about Tony.
Tony just blinked shocked and Steve just watched Tony's face turn beet red. It felt so good to see Tony smiling and studying all his tools and that he had been the one to bring that smile to Tony's face.
“Tony,” Steve breathed standing up straighter and shuffling his feet. The last time they had met was when he was still skinny 150 lbs asthmatic. Tony was one of the few real loves he felt and at thirty-five he has yet to come close to what he felt for the man standing a few feet away from him.
Steve was on his daily run. It was one of the few things he kept up over the hundreds of years he has been alive. It was odd to think about how old he was and how much he has changed over time. He was not the same man he was a hundred years ago let alone five but he still tried to be the best man he could be. But the stubbornness and bullheadedness was still there according to Bucky and Thor seems to think that is a part of his better qualities.
He really hoped that if he survived whatever this was, he will remember this dream. Because even though it would be a cruel reminder of what he will never have, it would also be something that was
Steve felt himself react to what he was sure to be Tony’s claws thrashing about. He moved without thinking and ran towards the assaulting harpies screaming and he heard a familiar roar next to him knowing that Thor had followed him into battle. They were got the harpies attention as they shifted just a bit to turn to look at Steve and Thor in both shock and defensiveness. They seemed to create a barrier between Tony and Steve without really letting Tony go from his spot and Steve did not like it at all. These bullying harpies were not going..to...hurt...wait.
The path back to town was a lot smoother. It seemed like the creatures and beasts learned their lesson from facing them the first time. Though some of them did find the guts to attack them but they took care of them easy enough.
“I know, but, hey,” said Tony. “I thought we agreed not to talk shop after hours. Wanna run that by me again?”
Steve’s own home, when he at last reached it around seven o’clock, offered long-overdue relief. The house, with its slanted roof and an extension added two years previously to shield their chickens from the elements, was already lit with a warm glow. It was all a blur to Steve, however, who was yawning rather prominently, and by the time he opened the door, his eyes were watering so greatly he had to blink twice in order to take in what he was seeing.
His question was answered, not by them but by shouting coming from behind a stack of crates. They all fell silent, crouching down behind the visual barrier.
Sorry it's been seven days, I was reading a really good fic and forgot I had to edit some parts of that Pym scene...
The boys of cloth called it the sanctuary of theology. If it were any more life-like, the angels would pluck theirs harps and sing to you. A tune that would make Mozart sound like a toddler with a fiddle.”
And yet … and yet … Tony walked restlessly to the sacks of flour and sat down on them, running a hand across his throat again. It wasn’t the isolation that bothered him; Tony was no stranger to solitude. He had been the only American in a boarding school once and been advanced beyond his age. That very same overshadowing had both gained and lost him several relationships along the years. He was used to exploitation and tricks; they were the unavoidable bedfellows of wealth and envy.
“Could Bruce back this up—scientifically, I mean,” Bucky asked the cell at large. “This miracle survival of a rotisserie man?”
Tony had known, but to hear it was another matter, and the confirmation sent a ripple of wariness through him. In the stifling, still warmth of the late afternoon, he shivered.
“As soon as your taillights disappear behind the tree line, I’ll go straight to bed, honest to God.”
“Everyone to the north of the village, but only half the people inside the house,” said Tony. “Good plan.”
,” Pierce mocked, and the coldness seeped back into his eyes. “Stane’s biggest weapon is Stark, is he not? If we get him off Stane’s hands, he loses his main bargaining tool, should the situation turn sour. I’ll take no more than three of you directly to where Tony Stark is kept.”
Tony turned to look at Rogers and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he had missed a step going downstairs.
“S-Stane keeps a hostage here,” Rumlow told swiftly. “Tony Stark is his name, the true heir to this company. He’s supposed to be dead.”
He kept his eyes on Steve’s but Steve saw what had prompted this sudden remark; Steve’s ring still adorned the finger on his left hand which was supporting his propped leg. He hid his hand as if to escape the subject this way.
They finally walked on, now passing the drawing room and, though he had only minutes ago colourfully cussed all curiosity out, Rhodey could not help the cursory glance he shot at the room.
Steve crossed his arms. Tony’s eyes darted to his biceps, and Steve noted with satisfaction that the kiss had not
“… I was young back then. I ran outside where there was quite the crowd, most treating the injured. Burns, fragment wounds. And the crater … right there, in front of the ball. We could not believe such thing would happen in America … not in Manhattan, not in daylight.”
“That’s what they all say,” he said, his tongue prickling. “I thought you would not be afraid to state differently. I’m very aware there’s a lot of things I can’t prevent. Here we are, at the brink of a second civil war, isolated and I’m miles away from solving either of those problems.”
The court continued its session with many mutters from the press of standees. All eyes followed from speaker to speaker. When Steve gave testimony of the accused smuggling ardent spirits containing expectorant without liquor license, the day had grown dark which each passing minute as the clouds outside darkened to navy. By the time Steve finished, it was impossible to distinguish if the blizzard was still going on or not.
“I was keeping watch on you, Tony. I called on you on the day of his scheduled demise. When I found the house empty, and I realized the fool had taken you with him, I thought I was ruined. But luckily, Howard’s idiocy had not yet run its course. He had sat you on the floor of the carriage where the structure was at its strongest, and you, miraculously, survived. I breathed again.
“The police?” Rogers observed thoughtfully. “Stern’s been rather noticeably mum about his whereabouts.  I think Stone suspects one of his friends and fears Stern is protecting them.”
“Tell me I’m not the only one getting the creeps,” said Natasha from where she was studying the shelves full of books and files at the right corner of the room.
“They never made you, Tony,” Stane growled, “not in the way that matters. I did. Let’s walk further.”
Later, after having caught the unlicensed liquor salesman, who was taken to the cells by Clint, Steve decided to walk to the church. There he followed its white picket fence and its worn painted surface until, under the stained-glass windows, he found what he was looking for: an oddly shaped, snow-capped post. Excited, he took off his hat, and swatted at the fence. Snow fell off and revealed what was underneath.
The woman, having been so promptly and directly spoken to, startled and retreated onto a display; as she and the saleswoman rushed to gather the scattered flowers, Tony plucked a bunch of lilies, slipped around the women and threw several notes on the register. Behind him, he heard a commotion as Hammer tried to follow but got his jacket caught on a decorative arrangement, and by the time he got his hem detached from the clutch of the gilded branch, Tony had already tugged the door open with force that rattled the OPEN sign, tugging his sunglasses higher up his nose.
Once Jarvis came to, it took several moments to overcome his state of agitation—and then several more to overcome Bruce’s declaration that his patient needed rest—but, at last, Bruce was persuaded to go but not before making sure Jarvis was to be kept in a reclined position for further questioning.
Steve jumped when he felt Bucky place a hand on his shoulder, towering concernedly over him. “You all right?”
Son of who? Were the worker’s parents of a poor background? Steve turned the paper around, but the sentence didn’t continue there. Steve scanned the desk: perhaps the rest of the letter had fallen off its ripped envelope. He peeked under the sheaves of paper, shook several documents and turned over an opened envelope, yet, the unfinished sentence was not carried on any paper or any other surface on the desk.
do it” Steve said bitterly and stopped talking when they had to break up in order to loop around the couple next to them.
Steve, now sat at the very edge of his seat, asked Fury’s turned back, “Am I allowed to share it with my men?”
“Tony, it’s us,” Steve said, and took careful steps toward him. “We’ve come to save you. You’re going to be fine. You’re safe.”
Only after it had clicked shut, did Fury step away from observing the street below. It was rare to see him in just shirtsleeves and a grey waistcoat, although he did not look any less sinister: the visible shoulder straps of his holsters guaranteed this.
Howard wanted Tony to run the company … Tony, not Obie. What had changed by the making of the will? There was something unsettling there, and Tony could not shake the feeling he was missing something vital…
But the rest of Bucky’s chatter, in a rather justifying tone, was drowned by his rising state of surprise as he identified the other rider right as they closed the intervening space. Next to the just-stirring thief, the horses came to a stop in a skid that sent dust and small pebbles everywhere.
“You do that, it won’t undo the damage done. People have looked between their fingers when you’ve let one or two slip out now and again, your belief that even the worst of men is entitled to a fair trial…but I won’t pretend this doesn’t shake our trust in you—and, therefore, this town’s trust in
With a delay, the ground under them gave an almighty lurch—all around them people were thrown off their balance—the metal columns rattling long after the sound stopped resonating off the walls.
“The head house,” Coulson told them, pointing at each square in turn. “Stane’s office, west wing. East lies the large industrial halls. There’s five of them. Each connected and accessible through fire doors.”
But Tony’s heart was beating rather fast; he was sure that Rogers was right. Who, out of all with access to the house, could have tampered with the latch? But why, then, had they not
Peter ran up and down the street, branch pointed like a gun and, as he passed them, they heard a muffled ‘pew, pew’ from behind the mask.
“You know what, I will,” said Tony. “Remember who you’re talking to.” He turned to face the garage. “Happy!”
“I think I’ll have Tony take a look at this,” he said, rising up and rolling the newsprint back into a neat twist.
“It’d be a relief, then, to hear Coulson knows a young and visionary engineer in Denver who’s agreed to come and design us a fireproof bridge at a reasonable prize?” asked Natasha.
Tony thought the subject had been closed, but after a silent car ride he was sorry to find Rhodey stealing glances at him over the stone lid bearing his mother’s name, and which now held a fresh bouquet of lilies, along with a slightly wilted vase of blush roses, brought no doubt by Jarvis the week before.
“Have you experienced any symptoms that have hindered your ability to do your work to your full potential?”
The notion struck to Steve as something he would seek from Tony as well, and this, above anything, won him over as the man finished heartfeltly, “But he is.
Happy looked satisfied; Tiberius let his cigarette drop and snuffed it onto the ground at Tony’s feet, but he had barely straightened when he was seized by the front of his wool lapels by Happy and forced towards the garage.
At the sight of the weapon, Steve sensed Natasha shift next to him and stepped pointedly between her and the men.
“Talk about devil’s luck,” cursed Bucky; it would be a while before the steam powered ploughs reached the summit. Too late, thought Steve, if they wanted to reach the San Francisco in time. How much time would elapse until they reached the city? How much longer would Tony be able to resist Stane? All Steve knew for sure was that Tony had never done what people wanted, and he was not sure if that would be in his favor or against in this case, making Steve all the more anxious to speed over the peaks on foot in he needed to. All his faith had been on the iron horse beneath him, still trembling idly.
He closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what the latch had looked like, but it was impossible … all Tony knew was that at the moment he had been close enough to see, and he had caught what else was in the room with him, all questions of
He moved towards the wardrobe again with a heavy chest. Since the fire, there had been only one spare jacket, which he had not worn save from that one night of weakness in this very room. Steve warred with himself: he pondered first, if it would be in bad taste to be seen wearing Tony’s last gift
“Thank you for your cooperation,” said Bucky and brought his fist upon Rumlow’s head, whose eyes rolled back and went limp.
“Twenty-one,” he said, feeling uncomfortably warm. It took a while before Strucker got a word in past the animated, mumbling crowd.
“I know we will,” said Bucky bracingly. “You know why? Because I bet he’s giving Stane hell. Besides you, he’s the most stubborn person I’ve ever met.”
“Exactly … what if Stane sent them after Tony to bully him into leaving … it’s not a coincidence that we, every person Tony called a friend,
“What a joker,” he said, throwing a look the elderly woman now clutching her wicker basket in a white-knuckled grip as if sharing a secret. “All bark, no bite, yeah.”
“I—I had no reason to look,” she said, sounding perplexed. “Didn’t you say there was a window involved or has the story changed already?
“Ma’am,” he greeted Ms. Hill who was recording figures near the door and walked by her to open further the door to surreptitiously glance inside.
A set of rushing footsteps and the scampering pitter-patter of nails followed, and Tony could just distinguish a canine reflection on the polished floor fleeting quickly past the door.
For a place he had been firmly denied entrance to, it was boring: the thing that best caught his attention was a perforated sheet Tony could not guess the use for.
“That uniform’s really caused you to escalate,” said Bucky. “There’s no time for one-man rescue mission.”
Tony, however, looked on the familiar faces of his friends not with recognition and relief but with a kind of growing horror, as if they were kidnappers or murderers; Steve wished he had gotten rid of the beard.
A thin figure stirred on it and rolled its head onto other shoulder … eyes opening in a skull of a face, and then it smiled.
Rogers gave Tony a cool, appraising look. Tony had the impression that the man was assessing whether it was beneficial opening hostilities this early on.
This time, Tony hesitated. He knew what hung on his decision. There was hardly any further reason for Obie to stay in England: now was the time to decide: Obie or an empty, unguarded house?
Relief pulsed through Steve’s body. As they passed gleaming wooden door after wooden door, each bearing a small plaque with a name, an occupation or its purpose upon it, the magnitude of the building compared to his initial, lone-gunslinger plan started to catch up on him. Steve was loath to admit, but Bucky had been right—he wouldn’t have gotten past the lobby,
“Anything to help,” Steve said as he sidestepped the swishing tail of the horse. “Sorry again, for the heifer.”
“Hey, I think I know you. Barnes, was it?” Tony said, and squinted at him. “Sorry, just trying to remember if I liked you or not.”
Hammer’s ever-present grin faded slowly. For a few moments something sinister seemed to cloud his eyes, but then the smile reappeared upon his face so suddenly it was rather alarming.
It seemed rather rhetorical, so Steve disregarded with a self-conscious smile. Behind him, Sam stepped pointedly in front of the thief’s face, tapping his boot onto the ground. The man grimaced.
“How ironic, Tony. You could have stayed hidden forever. I expected to find you somewhere alone and too proud to ask for help. But you did … you did … you have a weak heart that fell to the charms of a captain. A patriot!” Stane mocked, engaged and unaware said man was glowering at his back, gesturing at Bucky to shadow the two. “And now your little hero has run straight to your rescue. After I’m done with you, I’ll take care of your friends for good.”
Steve feigned ignorance which irritated Tony; he had always had little patience for willful stupidity.
Steve had never hated a man more than as he stood there, having been double-crossed, looking upon the men who had been so taken by Stane, they had abandoned the life they knew. How could such a man create so much loyalty? For one teetering second, Steve couldn’t help but feel disappointed. Part of him had wished to allow them to be held captive, if only to get a few minutes with Stane. Steve would have been very happy indeed to get his hands on him … and why couldn’t he?
[1] I did promise Friday, right? Split the chapter, though, 'cause it would have been 8K+ but you're getting the rest next week, same day, while I finish polishing ch. 6 into something presentable
A nurse passed by the bed on her way to the corner of the room. It was turning late. They were performing the last bandage change before nighttime. Tony gazed steadfastly at the woman. What exactly he had meant to make Steve feel, he didn’t know.
At Steve’s side, arms empty, Pym stopped. His eyes roved over Steve’s jacket; and he frowned. Stepping closer, he took the collar of it in his hands, followed the golden line of the buttons and rolled the fabric there between his fingers.
“You don’t mind Natasha asked Tony, do you?” asked Sam in a troubled voice, as they set off down the street. “I don’t know what’s going on with you two but—"
A hot, prickly swoop of betrayal swept through Steve’s body; how could they do this to him now? Under the watchful and somewhat judging eye of Ms. Hill, Steve gathered himself, and pounded his fist on the door to Fury’s office.
The temperature of the cell might have dropped several degrees along with the sobering subject. Bucky and Sam were angled towards each other, chairs swung around, whereas, behind them, Clint was looking at them avidly. Jarvis’ eyes appeared to be alarmedly swiveling backwards and forwards from one man to another.
seriously?” Rogers said harshly, knuckles white around his pen. “If I had a dead man turn up in my house, I’d refrain from making immature cracks—”
“So, I’m right?” Tony pressed, pushing away from the trunk, and to his surprise he was prevented from moving by Rogers’ hand clasping his arm. He looked down at it. He thought for a wild second that it was the first time he had been touched by Rogers, although they must have come to contact before —
“Right,” said Sam. “You’ve made your point, everyone’s met each other, and all is well in the world. Now, let’s move this reunion party someplace else—”
“There’s enough self-glorified vigilantes about without your input. The men you saw tonight? They’ve organized a neighbourhood watch. There’s hardly a cat that can cross the street without them knowing. They’ve terrorized half the county into sleepless nights. People are afraid that someday the gentry is going to kick down their door, point fingers and they can do nothing ab —
“Defense,” Coulson called for the last turn to speak, looking vexed at Bucky’s right side. Clearly, they worked him too hard. “Anything to add?”
“A dead-end,” replied Steve, folding the letter back, but at the word ‘dead’, something stirred in him; at the shape of the letter ‘y’ and its sharp downward tip. No matter what he tried, the memory eluded him. Was it a threat? Or an encouragement from an old friend to a bored Tony to embrace what he really needed: more than this life.
Fury’s grandfather clock chimed four times in the corner of the room while Steve wondered how Fury had known to take this matter up with Steve after his promise to Tony had become void, but now that conversation had been established, he had more pressing issues to address.
Evidently Rogers had no other suggestions. After squinting at Tony for a moment or two, Rogers rose, mirroring Tony, who did as he had suggested, with the horrible feeling of seeing off a ticking timebomb.
A hand grabbed his shoulder from behind and Steve’s hurt hand came to clutch it in reflex. The throbbing palm sent a searing twinge up his arm, and the hands on his shoulders used this moment of weakness to tug him out of the forge.
Rhodey, who had tiny droplets of water trapped in his buzz and brows, had arrived late and hoarse-voiced, for he had had to shoo off a throng of morbidly curious villagers gathered at the lodge gates, as if Tony’s house was the Chamber of Horrors at Tussaud’s.
Stane never saw the deadly block of steel coming, erratic as its descent was. The beam turned one last time by pure chance so that it came at him dead on like a spear from heaven—
Tony loved to build and if Steve could get enough money by the time they hit the city he could get Tony his own set of tools and material for him to make his own gadgets and trinkets. If making things eased Tony’s mind and helped him than Steve will get him whatever he needed. Working odd side jobs allowed him time to himself and to meet other people outside his friends. Steve always loved working solo after long group hauls and missions just to get away from the constant familiarity of those next to and around him.
“Don’t bullshit me, Tony,” Steve growled balling his hands into fists under the table, “I don’t believe you would leave us, leave me for money. I know you didn’t care about the money. We could have made our own way. I would have loved you whether you had a million dollars or just a penny to your name. Hell, you could take mine for all I cared.”
It took them an extra five days to get their plan ready and moving. Steve and Tony decided that it would be better not to wait until things settle down as to not give Stane a chance to gather himself and his story. On the sixth day, the Avengers made their move towards the castle. The plan was to meet Pepper at the servant quarters and she will lead them to the throne room where Stane usually hosts his parties and planning sessions. They made it to the small door on the far side of the castle. It was small enough that if Steve was not looking for it he would have missed it.
