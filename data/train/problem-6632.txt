Peter didn’t want to sound like a cry baby but he couldn’t help it. He was sick of Mama and Harley always ignoring him and spending the weekend trying to get his Dad’s attention. “Does he want Harley because he’s bigger?”
“Peter is right here! This is very inappropriate!”
Peter eventually stopped crying. He realized that he had been crying on Tony’s shoulder and at some point he started hugging them back. He let go of them, slightly embarrassed, and wiped his face.
He promptly grabbed Bucky’s hand and started dragging him towards the elevator, trying to get away before Steve could ask anymore questions.
“What do you mean by lay low?”
Once he got up to his floor, he found his dads waiting for him in the living room. Peter immediately flopped down on the couch between them and sighed knowing he could finally relax.
Peter rushed over and practically threw himself into her arms. He was relieved that it was someone he knew and someone he knew his dads trusted wholeheartedly.
Peter looked over at Tony, surprised.
Peter blushed in embarrassment. It didn’t occur to him he was so oblivious, even with his powers.
After class Peter tried to rush out of class first to avoid the crowd of people he knew would be looking for him. Unfortunately, he wasn’t fast enough. He was quickly surrounded by strangers wanting to talk to him. At this point, Peter felt like he was going to cry. It was too much for him.
On Peter’s last day of freedom, he got to spend the day doing pretty much whatever he wanted since his dads had work to do outside of the tower. They both felt really bad about it, but Peter assured them he would be okay. After all, the tower was the safest place in the city, and the other Avengers were still there.
“Anything?” Clint asked in a challenging tone.
“Well, yeah, but if you don’t want to we-”
“Good morning, Peter. Did you sleep well?”
“Love you too, Dad. Bye.”
The elevator opened and Tony announced his arrival, expecting Peter to greet him, but he wasn’t there.
“It’s alright. I understand, but now it’s time to start packing. Your dads are waiting for you.” Alex smiled.
“So have I, but I’ve always lived here.”
“Too late!”
“Peter, will you please tell us one thing about your dads?” Ned begged.
Ned sat down on the floor and Peter joined him. They sat quietly for a few minutes, just listening to the footsteps and distant conversations of other students.
Eventually, the elevator opened and Clint and Natasha walked in, arguing about something.
an asshole. You seemed cool so I thought ‘Why not hang out with this kid? He’s new and doesn’t know anybody. I know that feeling.’ I’m not dying to be your friend like the rest of the school, Peter. You act like a poor loner orphan kid, but really you’re just a privileged asshole with a big ego. I don’t need that in my life.” With that she turned in her seat and faced the front of the classroom.
“Hey, he’s right, Pete,” Steve jumped in, “It’s already nine. I know you’re having a good time, but you do have school tomorrow. Go get your stuff while we clean up.”
“Anything. You can tell me what you’re thinking about if you want, or we can talk about something totally different.”
“Well, we can’t just stand still out in the open. We’ll get caught.”
Alex smiled. “That’s great. I’ll go get him.”
“Who's next then?” He looked around at everyone.
“Do you like it here?” Ned asked him this time.
“Yes. Please call someone.”
“Oh, I was just looking for my shield,” he played along, “Have either of you seen it?”
“Are you the new student?” a voice from across the room suddenly questioned.
Peter groaned yet again. He knew what the answer was going to be, but he hoped that maybe his dads would take pity on him.
They both sat back down in their chairs, and reminded him that he didn't need to apologize.
recently.
Sam and Bucky rolled their eyes.
This room was better than any of the ones he had in a foster home. Peter already didn't want to leave and he just arrived.
Peter groaned but agreed. School was necessary and he knew it.
Tony smiled down at Peter and pulled him into a side hug. “If you want to work with me once you finish high school, then I’m all for it, but you unfortunately need to finish school. Your father and I both did.”
“Well, I think… it’s probably possible, considering he is a god.”
Peter continued to be eternally grateful for Wade’s presence when lunchtime came. He made sure they got the table in the back corner that Peter liked, and he turned away anyone who attempted to sit at the table without Peter’s permission. At this point, Wade had become Peter’s favorite person at Marvel High, not that he would ever say that to Wade’s face. Again, it would only make Wade more unbearable.
“Oh, it’s alright.”
“So, did Ned and Miles harass you with a million questions in chem?” MJ asked with a smirk, already knowing the answer.
Good things didn’t happen to Peter Parker.
you become Iron Man?”
“Surprise! I found a couple that wants to adopt you,” he told Peter with a smile, not knowing the news was the opposite of what Peter wanted.
He began to feel trapped in his room. He quickly hopped out of bed, and thought about where he could go.
“No, don’t apologize, Peter. I’m more than happy to help you when you need me. Are you feeling better now?”
Once they left the office, Steve grabbed Tony and hugged him.
He also decided that the fear of being alone was worse than his fear of loved ones dying. He was going to get answers about his family's and Gwen’s deaths, and he hoped that could finally put his fears to rest. Even if it didn’t, though, Peter was so tired of being alone, and he had actually found a few decent people at this school. He took a chance on Steve and Tony, and he could see that the universe had given him another chance, but it was quickly slipping away from him. His last leap of faith completely turned his life around for the better, so Peter didn’t want to lose this one.
Steve chuckled.
“Me too,” Carol replied as she kissed Maria’s cheek.
Peter stayed in that house until the summer started. Peter wished he could forget what happened in that house, but he knew he never would. He was glad to leave.
Steve smiled and hugged his husband tightly. It made him so happy to hear that Peter loved them. They of course loved him, too.
“We might be meeting our son tomorrow!” Steve sounded like he might explode because he was so happy.
“Fine, I guess. I get straight A’s.”
“Alright, well what does matter? What kind of kid do you want? I need to narrow it down somehow.”
“Oh god, what do I do? What do I do?” he whisper-shouted to himself.
“I’m sorry, Peter. I cannot tell you.”
Tony kissed Steve. “God, I love you.”
When Peter finally reached the Avengers Tower, he found the couch occupied by some of the Avengers, so he decided to head to his room instead. After his very long and stressful day, all he wanted was to be alone in a quiet place for a bit.
“I still want him, Steve.”
Tony sighed defeatedly. “Alright. You can go to public school. I'll do some research and find a good one. And you'll be starting as soon as possible.”
“Fine.”
“Well Peter has decided that you guys should look at his file before meeting him.”
Steve and Tony walked with him to his room. Peter headed straight for his bed.
He heard the sound of a door closing a moment later and he knew he was all alone now. He was kind of regretting not talking to Tony. The dream about his parents brought up a lot of unwanted and confusing emotions, but he had a hard time opening up to people, especially about his parents. He just felt terrible right now and he wished he could sleep.
Life was pretty much boring and routine for Peter. He still had nightmares and some days where he did need to drink the pain away or else he would hurt himself, but mostly it was just the same. Going to school, and switching foster homes every few months. He also figured at this point, since he was 15, he wasn’t going to be adopted. He was fine with that, he didn’t want to be adopted anyway. He would only end up disappointing whoever thought they wanted him. Plus Peter vowed to himself, he would never let himself love anyone ever again. He couldn’t be responsible for another death.
“School can’t be that bad. Make some friends so you have someone to talk to when your bored.”
Peter quickly intervened. “Wade, it’s okay. Chill.”
He slowly opened the door and walked into the huge room. He looked around in awe. There was a big bed, a desk with a computer that was no doubt made by Tony, a flat screen tv on the wall, and a book shelf filled with tons of books.
“Sorry,” Peter apologized, but clung to her for another minute. He needed his heart to relax and he needed a bit of human contact.
When Peter was dragged out of the van, he was taken into a lab. He recognized it. It was his parents’ old lab. He was strapped down to a table. He felt a needle go into his arm, and then he felt sleepy. When he woke up, he was on the porch of Gwen Stacy’s house. Gwen’s dad found him and asked him what happened. All Peter could think about was Gwen.

“With me and Daddy dying, well that’s not happening any time soon. There’s a weird thing in this world that means if you’re a caregiver or little, your life span is much longer than usual. I’m sure the doctor that’s checking Bucky will be explaining it though so you can ask him or her all your questions when we're in there but just know that Daddy and I aren’t going to be leaving you and Bucky. Got that?”
Thanos has been defeated and the world is set back to before, only with one difference, everyone now has a different classification that they go by and Peter is a little. That would have been fine if he hadn't woken up without any memories after Thanos. Follow Peter as he navigates through his strange new life, getting into mischief along the way with his sidekick plushie, Ironman!
“Okay Clint, I need you to strip naked for me.” He said, giving him a reassuring smile.

“Bad Dada!” Jamie shouted, pushing at his Dada to get away from him. He was not going to take his Dada abusing his big brother.
“Love you too baby.” Peter skipped into the kitchen and made his first post.
Bucky smirked, “Anytime doll. Can’t have our resident Omega’s honour being at risk.” At Steve’s growl, he laughed, “I’ll go get that water and snacks for you punk. You treat him right now.” With a small salute, Bucky was gone.
“Yeah Papa, that was a good try at being funny! Well done!” Peter’s support was probably worse than the teasing he would receive off his teammates for his bad sense of humour. Mostly because he was genuine in his support of his Papa.
“I know baby, look she’s almost done.” Bucky didn’t listen though and continued to wail.
Steve eyebrows creased at his son’s insecure words. “Peter, there’s no point in going by what society says you have to. If that were the case Dad would not be the eccentric billionaire that he is. All that matters is that you’re happy and you have a life that suits you. A lot of adults take naps as well. They just don’t have it at a set time. Uncle Bruce is always napping.”
“Right, let’s get you set up. Remember Tony. Once half the pasta is gone you can have the knot okay? You can also come as much as you want since technically it’s still my cock inside you.”
Steve parked up, sighing in relief when he saw a free space in the children and parents zone, he needed the extra space to get the kids out without waking them.
Steve rolled his eyes at the little boy but allowed for Tony to take him back. It was a common theme in their house, when one of them gave out to Peter he would go to the other and be extra affectionate with them. It seemed that getting his memory back wasn’t changing his overall little personality which was interesting. He was sure Tony had already come up with ten different theories as to why.
“Uh, you know Peter’s twitter is trending right?”
Clint poked his head out from the kitchen, “What’s up?” He asked, his mouth full of pasta.
He thought about crying but that really went against his whole idea on being big and not letting his emotions get the better of him. Hmm, this was going to take some thinking. He’d have to find a way to let them know without seeming littler than he was. He looked over at Jamie; he was already fast asleep with his blankey covering half his head. It only took ten minutes of driving for Peter to feel his eyes go heavy. This car must have some sort of rocking part for the seats because it felt like he was in a hammock. There was nothing he could do against the soothing back and forth movements of the car. He was tired anyway. This was not a nap in anyway. Peter consoled himself with that thought as he fell asleep.
To top it all off he was super popular as well but didn’t think Peter was lame at all.
He made his way over to where he knew his clothes were, cringing when he saw that the only clothes there were for littles. He tried to pick the least offensive to his eyes, going with a T-shirt that said ‘My Daddy is Ironman’. In fairness, he probably would have worn something like that in the other world. Next was a pair of sweatpants with little Captain America shields on them. Jeez, talk about self-promotion. The shields weren’t too obvious though so he took them out as well and started to work his clothes off him.
10 minutes later Peter was ready to start crying again. Why was getting undressed so difficult? He should have been able to do it fine but here he was with on strap of the overalls off and unable to undo the last one. He stopped himself from getting worked up. He knew it would do no good to get frustrated. Taking a deep breath he tried to wiggle it out again, nearly cheering when he
Long time I know! This chapter went in a way I didn't know It would but sure look that's half the fun. I was going to leave it on a cliff hanger but I hate when that's done when I'm reading a story so you're welcome 😂
“No thank you, Papa. I like school. Can we get food?” Peter just wanted to stop talking about this. He knew he’d end up crying.
Tony growled again but this time at Steve. “Not happy with you either. Stupid Alpha’s.” He muttered, glaring at Bucky because he couldn’t see Steve from the position he was in. He missed Steve’s look of confusion over his head.
Tony took a wipe out and began wiping the urine away. “No problem doc. We’d want to make it quick, Bucky doesn’t really have any control of himself.”

“I like it when you go all Papa bear. It’s cute. Now do you want to come over and help me with Peter’s profile or do you want to stand there and glare?”
“Maybe I should post it first on my twitter so they lose the shock of the ‘first picture!’?”
“You know you’re my favourite person right? Even more than your Mama and Papa? Even more than my friends. I love coming here because of you?” Harley asked, nearly choking on his cries.
“Daddy, is Bucky’s name James?”
“B-but you always laugh more with Harley and never spank him and joke more with him.” Peter listed off everything that was bothering him.
Life actually seemed pretty great for Peter right now. He wondered how long that would last. Something always went wrong. He guessed something would probably happen at school and he'd absolutely hate spending the next 3 years there.
Steve and Tony headed down to the lab and were very surprised by what they walked into. Peter was sitting on the edge of one of the work tables, swinging his legs back and forth, listening intently to Bruce explain his work. He seemed relaxed, interested, and genuinely happy. They stood silently watching for moment because this was the first time they had seen Peter so happy.
“Should I contact your fathers?” JARVIS asked suddenly.
Peter paused for a minute, still not sure if he was serious, but Wade’s hopefully eyes did not change.
“Do you not like me?” Ned asked suddenly.
The next day, Peter was disappointed to find that his dads still weren’t back from their mission, but Pepper tried her best to make up for it by making Peter anything he wanted for breakfast, and he chose pancakes. They ended up tasting great and surprisingly did cheer him up a bit.
Peter closed his eyes and took a deep breath to calm himself.
Peter could feel his panic getting worse and he knew he was about to have an anxiety attack. Luckily, he was saved by the person sitting beside him.
He seemed to like the idea. “Okay.”
“Oh, crap.”
“Look, I know you’re antisocial, but Peter, if you want to get adopted, you’ll have to talk to people and appear more friendly. People don’t want kids who barely speak to anyone.”
MJ raised a brow, letting a bit of curiosity slip out. “You’ve met the other Avengers?”
Tony tried to reassure Peter, “Well no need to worry. We argue a lot, mostly because Steve is sometimes still stuck in the 40s,” Steve scoffed, “but it's just us bickering. That's what we do.”
Peter couldn’t hide the shocked look on his face. What MJ had said came straight out of left field. He definitely didn’t think he was acting anything like a jerk.
He felt Tony put his arm on his shoulder. Peter sighed and looked back up at them. They looked worried. They looked like they really cared.
“Of course!”
The next day Peter was put into a foster home. Some man in a suit with a friendly smile, named Alex, explained to him what a foster home was while he drove him there. Peter stayed silent. He didn’t want to go to a foster home. He wanted to stay with Gwen and hug her forever.
Bucky turned around and shook Tony’s hand, giving him a genuine but slightly nervous smile. Tony couldn't blame him for being nervous. After all, who wants to meet their boyfriend’s ex-husband?
“Well, I hope he at least left his room. Do you think we’re bad parents for leaving him alone all day after just adopting him?”
With that, Wade returned to his seat beside Peter and continued eating lunch.
‘Well at least I won’t be bothered,’ he thought contently.
Tony pulled him into a side hug.
Tony chuckled to himself. “Too many.”
“Is he your personal bodyguard now, Peter?” There was only the slightest hint of annoyance in her voice.
Peter began to feel a bit defensive. “That’s not true.”
“Pick anything yet?”
“They're crazy, but you’ll get used to it,” Tony told him with a smile, “Alright, let's show you your room.”
Once he reached his floor, he walked down the hallway and up to his closed bedroom door. He could hear Sam and Bucky quietly arguing on the other side of the door for a minute before it opened. Steve stood in front of them with his arms crossed and serious expression on his face.
Peter relaxed slightly. “She just kept calling me a jerk because I was rude to her, Miles, and Ned because I don’t want to talk to them and be friends, which is ridiculous. Right?”
“So… Why don’t you see an actual therapist?” Peter asked again, not quite knowing how else to respond.
Clint scoffed. “No way in hell Thor can lift the Hulk. He’s huge! And Thor is like normal human sized.”
‘I was perfectly fine without any friends these last handful of years, so obviously everyone is wrong.’ He didn’t find himself quite as convincing as he wanted, though.
“Woah!” Peter ran up to the new suit and immediately began admiring it. Tony enjoyed seeing his son happy and excited.
“Peter, this is a good thing. They’re a great couple, I think you’d really like them, plus it’s really hard to find people that wanted to adopt kids like you.”
“Dude, I didn’t lose his shield. You did. Why are you making this out to be an ‘us’ situation?”
“It looks a lot cooler inside,” Tony teased.
When the tour ended and first period approached, Wade lead Peter back to his first period classroom to drop him off.
He promised himself he would start to be more careful and aware of his surroundings next time he went to change into his suit. He was just really happy to learn his secret was safe and he could go back to being Spider-Man. He had people to help.
“I don’t expect anything in return. I’m doing this out of the kindness of my heart.”
Peter listened to the story intently, though. He seemed genuinely interested in know more about his father and letting him vent.
“Uh, well, I don’t really have much to say. I mean they’re superheroes, don’t you already know like everything about them?”
“Please, shooting star, bring my mom home. Please.”
Repeatedly, Clint tried to get Bruce introduce “the big green guy” or “the jolly green giant” to Peter. Peter thought at one point, he would actually hulk out and punch Clint, but thankfully he didn't.
Tony leaned over and gave his son a quick hug before replying with, “Hi, Pete. How was your weekend?”
Steve turned bright red, and tried to stop Tony from answering.
“Okay, listen, I don’t like Wade, but he’s helping me out, so whatever. I’m not gonna tell him to back off,” MJ scoffed, “And I’m not being rude. I want to be left alone and I think everyone knows that. What’s your problem, huh? Why do you want to be friends so badly?”
“You don’t know that.”
“If he wants to go to public school, then we should let him. We want him to be comfortable at school. And we can always talk to the school to make sure his identity stays hidden.”
“Yes, sir.” JARVIS responded.
Tony considered how to approach the question. On one hand, he didn’t want to freak Peter out by being completely honest, but on the other hand, he knew the kid had experienced bad stuff as well, so honesty probably wouldn’t freak him out.
Peter smiled and followed them inside. “Wow, Tony was right.” He heard Tony chuckle.
“We’re just happy that you’re happy Peter. That’s all we’d ever want from you,” Tony admitted.
He was adopted. He had a family.
All he knew for sure was that he wanted to be alone.
“Hi, baby. You look a little suspicious. What are you up to?”
Sam rolled his eyes and groaned. “Of course he is.”
“Yeah. Goodnight, Peter,” Tony joined in.
“I’m sorry, Peter. I can’t bring them back. I wish I could, but I just can’t.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Is he staying for good this time Mama?”
He wondered if he could get uncle Happy to collect him without letting his parents know.
“Yes, boss. I’m sorry for scaring you, Peter.” Friday sounded sincere enough that she swayed Peter it seemed when he brought his head up from Tony’s neck and smiled up at one of Friday’s sensors.
Peter was more quietly clingy. He used his powers to his advantage and clutched onto Tony. There was no reasoning with him to let Tony go. Because of that, Tony had to bring him with him when he was using the bathroom or showering. Peter didn’t seem to mind at all and would just continue to cling to him.
“Peter, sick?” Bucky asked, still crying.
Omg, the last time I updated was July. Not cool of me. I. This chapter is more Clint based but I promise it's only this one to just establish some things so I don't have to explain them later. The next chapter will be focused more on Tony and Steve's point of view!
Peter being Peter though, it didn’t come out in conventional ways because he was just too pure-hearted for the typical kind of jealousy.
He had learned that the hard way when Bucky was still hiding his classification.
“I ask that you don’t ask any questions until I finish because a lot of it is explained as I go.” He looked between Bucky and Peter, waiting to get nods of confirmation off both of them before launching into what he knew.
“You can clean that up,” Sam said, in between bites before going back to his conversation with Natasha.
“Awesome! Let’s go get you changed.” Peter was placed standing beside the couch while Mama got up, he went to bring the bottle into the kitchen but Peter followed him. It was still too soon to be left by himself.
“Let’s go, sweetheart,” Steve said, taking Peter’s hand and walking to the elevator.
“Ah, gotcha. Your order will be here soon Mr Stark.” She smiled once more at the rest and left to hand the order in.
“Yeah, baby. You go too.”
“Steve. I-“ Tony couldn’t finish the sentence without choking up. Peter thought that while Tony loved him, he didn’t like him as much as Harley.
“Awh, Mama, do I have to? Papa lets me sit upfront with him.”
“Uh-huh.” Peter liked that he had a little brother; someone that looked up to him. Bucky did look up to him as well, which was awesome!”
Steve looked at his husband warily. “What are you going to do?”
Let me know what you think of this chapter, the end kind of got away from me and I am running on very little sleep so sorry if there are any grammatical issues that I can't see. Thanks for the response to this story so far. It's been cool! :)
let go of his Dad Peter was quick to stick himself to his side for his own cuddle while they walked, content now that he wasn’t being left out.
“Peter, take a breath and calm down for me. All you have to do is get the question out and then it’s done. Regardless of my answer, okay?”
Peter was not happy when he woke up for two reasons. One was that he was in a crib, and two was that he didn’t even feel himself being moved. He took a few minutes to look around the room once more before he made his move. Last time he ended up falling and hurting himself which brought his Mama. He didn’t need that this time. He was determined to show them he was big. First was figuring out how to pull his crib bars down. It shouldn’t be too hard. He saw his Mama doing it earlier. He was still a genius, regardless of him now being this so-called little. He sat up and studied the mechanism for a few minutes before he tried it. It took him three different tries but he managed to get it unhooked in the end. Yes! Now he just had to shuffle off of the bed, which brought him to his next predicament, he had a wet diaper. Ew.
“N-No Mama, She, She, She goes on the bold step for her age.” Tony chuckled, his boy had a heart of gold, trying to get Friday out of her spanking even when he got a fright because of her.
Tony smiled at him, one of his real smiles, that went the whole way to his eyes when he was truly happy. “Yeah, we do.”
Tony stared after her, contemplating. “I like her. She was polite, didn’t draw too much attention to the kids and didn’t make eyes at either of us. Did you happen to get her name?”
Steve grinned up at Clint. “I had this specially made for Tony. I have a rule that he can only come on my cock or not at all.” He unlocked the three little hinges on the box and stopped before opening it. “I want to both of us to have something to eat but Tony’s heat is more intense than I expected. With this, he gets to come as much as he wants and I’m free to move about so I can get some food into us without being out of commission with being tied together.”
Bucky looked back down at Tony. “Why would you be upset over that? It’s perfectly normal for Omega’s to be naked.”
“How is Harley? He seemed excited.”
Tony sighed. “Petey, Harley is like a big brother to him. We all consider him family and he is our family where it matters but the difference is that Harley has a Mom back in Tennessee that deals with his discipline and all the rules. That leaves me to be able to joke more as a friend with him than a Dad. I am your Dad though which means my first priority is your safety and happiness. That sometimes means that you’ll get in trouble with me quicker than Harley would. Harley is old enough to be afforded a bit of leeway with that stuff. You’re still young enough that I have to give you a bit more structure. Do you understand?” Tony took Peter’s shaking hands and began to rub some heat back into them.
Peter felt absolutely horrible and could feel his face go warm from embarrassment. He quickly made his way to his table in the back corner. Once there, he sat and ate his lunch alone, occasionally glancing over to the other table across the cafeteria. The feeling of regret and guilt grew stronger and stronger by the minute, though, until Peter could no longer eat.
“Hey, remember what you told me yesterday?” Tony asked, sensing Steve’s uneasiness about Peter’s background. “You told me that we’d figure this out and that there’s no need to worry.”
‘Hate me that much?’
“I just don’t really need any friends. It’s nothing personal.” Peter hoped that was enough to shut down the conversation. He really didn’t want to have to explain or talk about his past.
Steve laughed and shook his head. “Go set up the table you two,” he commanded.
He followed them to the elevator, and once he was inside, he began questioning Tony on what they did at the tower.
Peter wasn't quite sure what he wanted. On one hand, he felt like his last name was the last connection he had to his old family. On the other hand, he wanted to be connected to his new family.
,” Tony sarcastically responded for Peter, causing Steve to give him a disapproving look, and Peter to giggle.
Peter groaned, “Can't I just stay at home for a while?”
“You don't need any new clothes or school supplies or anything?” Steve leaned against the doorway.
“It is my fault! They all died because of me!” He started sobbing.
After dinner, Peter was ready to head off to his room again, but his fathers stopped him.
“Thank you so much.”
“It's hard for me to talk to people and make friends. Gwen was the only friend I ever had…”
Steve and Tony started asking Peter questions about himself. He mostly gave short, quiet responses, but occasionally they'd ask him something and he would ramble on for minutes, apologizing afterward. They reassured him that it was fine every time though.
Peter held the piece of paper in his hands. He was now officially named Peter Parker Rogers-Stark. It almost felt unreal. The whole situation almost felt unreal, too, but here he was, standing between his dads on the elevator up to their home at the top of the Avengers Tower.
Peter later met up with his fathers for dinner. He walked into the room with a noticeable smile on his face.
He was hopeful. Peter seemed to like them beyond the fact that they were heroes that he looked up to.
Tony took a deep breath and relaxed. “Yeah. You’re right. Sorry for freaking out there. This is new territory.”
Here’s something I know you’d love to hear, Captain America is super old now. Well, technically there’s a different Captain America now, but you know what I mean. I guess he decided to stay in the past, but now he’s actually like 100 or something. It’s kinda crazy.
“But Dad…” Peter whined.
“They don’t care about that, Peter. Come on. Will you please meet them? If you don’t agree to this, I might have to bring them down here to meet you.”
Peter glanced at his two best friends sitting across from him and sighed.
“Hi, honey, I’m home,” she announced as she walked into the room with open arms.
“Okay, I’m gonna see if I can track this person down, but in the meantime you should lay low. Worst case scenario: the photo leaks and you can pass it off as photoshop or something.”
Clint groaned, obviously feeling betrayed. Natasha smirked.
Peter began to wonder if he should be telling them stuff like that. Anyone could be listening and what if they tried to break into Tony’s lab because Peter had told him that’s where all the suits are?
They asked so many questions it made Peter’s head spin. He couldn’t even process everything they were asking. Luckily, the teacher decided to start the class shortly after Peter sat down, and today he lectured for the whole period, meaning everyone had to leave Peter alone, including Ned and Miles.
“What the hell, Pete? You nearly gave me a heart attack.” Tony sighed.
“Yeah. I mean I would feel a lot better if my dads came home tonight.”
The smiley face almost made Peter throw his phone across the room in a fit of rage. Someone knew his secret and was messing with him. It was joke to them, but it was Peter’s life. It made him extremely upset.
And that curveball was Steve and Tony Rogers-Stark.
Steve called back, “Yes!” before turning his attention back to Tony.
“And the rest of the Avengers!” Miles eagerly added.
Peter was amazed he survived meeting the other Avengers. He followed Tony and Steve down the hall. There were plenty of rooms, and he wondered what they were for.
“Thank you! I love you guys!” He cheered before running off to his room.
“Why do you need therapy? And why don’t you see an actual therapist?”
Clint could tell Peter was confused. He decided to share a bit more information. “Thor is definitely strong. Strong enough to lift anyone of us, maybe even all 5 of us if Banner isn’t feeling green, but do you think he’s strong enough to lift the Hulk?”
“Then you should as well,” Peter suggested
“Well for one, I haven’t even used some of them beyond testing.”
After a few laps of slow jogging, Peter suddenly felt a hand grab his arm and pull him under the bleachers. He panicked at first, and was preparing to yell for help when he saw Ned.
“I’m being a gentleman, Michelle.”
Then he fell asleep.
Peter was about to shove the person away, but he noticed it was Wade. For once, he was happy to see him. He guided him all the way to his chemistry class, making sure no one got too close. Peter repeatedly thanked him in his head, not willing to inflate Wade’s ego by actually thanking him aloud.
As soon as they entered his house, Peter began sobbing again. His Aunt held him in her arms until he calmed down.
“So, this is Pepper. She’s super smart, runs my company, she’s one of my best friends, and just an awesome person overall.”
“Good!”
“Name situation?” Peter was confused.
“Hey Kiddo,” Tony greeted while walking over to Peter and ruffling his hair. “We just wanted to tell you that we made it back.”
“Well-” Clint tried to answer, but Natasha covered his mouth.
“We live on this floor and the others live on a different floor, but they still hang out here despite the fact I gave them their own tv down there,” Tony shook his head.
He was handed a bunch information on a bunch of fancy private schools. He frowned slightly. If he was going to school, he wanted to go to public school.
Peter chuckled. It was obvious who wrote what. He actually really appreciated the note, too. His first day was kinda rough, but he knew he could relax with his dads once he got back home. He really loved his dads.
“Do you like it?” Steve asked after a minute of silence.
Tony and Steve looked at each other surprised. They hadn’t expected that, but they were happy nonetheless.
“Bossy.” Tony stuck out his tongue and waited for Peter to hand the tablet back to him.
Steve cleared his throat and looked over at his husband. “Uh, Tony, shouldn't we deal with the name situation before school?” He asked.
“Gross!” Peter exclaimed as he fell back onto his bed.
“Guess what, Peter? You’ve officially been adopted!” Alex shouted enthusiastically.
Dear Mr. Stark,
“Oh my god. You’re actually back?”
The beginning of October came and Peter continued to lose hope. He was convinced Steve and Tony changed their minds about him. And he was so convinced of this that when Alex showed up at his foster house one day, he automatically thought Alex was coming to tell him that Steve and Tony changed their minds. He braced himself for bad news, but he never got it.
“Well, what about your friends? Do you do any sports or are you in any clubs?”
Tony looked like he wanted to try some more convincing, but Steve interrupted.
“You don't have to. We may be superheroes to everyone, but really we're just normal people,” He paused and glanced at Tony and Clint, who were in a heated debate, “well, mostly normal people.”
Peter nodded. “Okay, yeah. I want to be adopted.” He smiled as Steve and Tony came over and gave him a big hug. They looked so happy.
“I gotta go now.”
Outside, there was blond haired teen leaning against the wall with an attitude that made it obvious he’d rather be anywhere else but here.
“And I’m glad I’m back. You’ve gotten so big since I last saw you,” he chuckled, “How old are you now?”
Peter was amazed. “That’s awesome!” he gushed.
“Both of you keep quiet or she’ll die,” the man with a gun threatened them.
“Well, we just wanted to say goodnight to you. So, goodnight,” Steve said.
“I’m glad you think I’m attractive, Peter, but I’m not jock,” Wade replied, still laughing slightly, “I’m what a cheesy high school movie would call an ‘outcast.”
“Calm down. I’m not mad.”
Peter was amazed he finally got to see JARVIS. Well not really see, but he really admired all of Tony’s inventions, especially his AI. He wondered if he could fool around with him later.
“I’ll be out in a few minutes!”
“Would you guys calm down? We have a guest,” Tony shouted towards them.
Tony immediately shot up with a bewildered look on his face. Once he saw that it was only his son, he visibly relaxed.
“Hey, what are you so nervous about?”
“Yeah. So there’s all that, but there’s also the whole story of how I became Iron Man.”
Peter laughed and leaned away from Steve only to have Tony kiss his other cheek.
Whenever Alex showed up, Peter knew he was being kicked out. He sighed and said nothing when he saw Alex on the front porch of the foster home he’d been in for barely a week.
“I know you didn’t do the homework because you’re new, but I don’t feel like talking to any of those idiots,” she explained.
Peter rolled over and reached for his backpack that was sitting on the floor. He dug through it for his phone. He left school rather suddenly and wanted to see if any of his friends had texted him.
Peter tried to answer, but all he ended up doing was making a muffled sound.
“Someone with eyes.”
This new family seemed nice at first. They didn’t have strict rules like the first 2 houses did, which Peter liked. He thought he would be fine staying in this house. At least he thought that until nighttime. Once it turned night, his new foster father snuck into his bed, and stole Peter’s innocence.
Peter hugged Pepper yet again.
“Of course! Come and sit. I have much to tell,” Thor said enthusiastically as he sat down on the floor.
Tony relaxed. “Alright. What’s up?”
“We wanted you to have a special homecoming,” Steve explained.
. Maybe everyone will be calm today.”
Then he turned to Tony and announced he was ready to leave. Steve turned toward Tony and stuck out his hand for a parting handshake, but Tony went in for a hug instead. Everyone seem shocked by that, Tony included, but he finally felt good about his relationship with Steve again. He got the closure he needed, and he had his best friend back. Life was good again.
Wade sighed. “Fiiiiiiiine. I’ll leave. But one day you’ll have to be nice to me because I’m gonna be Peter’s boyfriend.”
Peter stood up. “What do you mean?”
Oh his phone was a photo of him changing into his Spider-Man suit in an alley and a text saying “I know your secret, Peter Parker”.
The parents in the next house were just as bad as the first, but the kids were a lot nicer to him. The oldest kid there was 16. He gave Peter a lot of advice even though Peter barely spoke to him. One day he sat down on Peter’s bed and sighed.
“Hi. I’m Gwen Stacy,” she smiled and stuck out her hand for him to shake. He reached out and shook her hand.
“I’m Peter Rogers-Stark,” he said expecting a big reaction.
“Hi?” he replied, uneasy.
“What?! You can’t do that! Mental illness is a big red flag to people.”
“Oh, and don't stay up too late, kid. We've got your hearing in the morning,” Tony reminded him.
“Okay, back to talking about the robots. I’m done being emotional today,” Tony announced as he hopped off the table.
Peter heard some shuffling before the door shut and he was alone again.
“I’m serious, Peter. Unless you want everyone to figure out your identity, lay low.”
Ned released his arm. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to freak you out. It’s just the teacher doesn’t pay attention after the first 5 minutes of class, so you don't have to keep running.”
“I don't know.”
Steve saw him first and smiled.
“What?”
Peter couldn't stop laughing, and neither could Tony.
“He’s in Dr. Banner’s lab, sir.”
By the end of class, Peter was feeling more upset and confused than angry, but he decided to just ignore those feelings and move on with his life. He didn’t need or want any friends so there was no point in getting hung up about MJ.
Peter groaned. It was too early to be up, and
“Yeah, of course. He was my best friend and the love of my life. It still feels weird sleeping in my bed alone, and him not being there to make us breakfast every morning, but we divorced for a reason. It’s weird to hear about him dating, you know?”
“Me too,” he replied glancing at Steve, who smiled at him.
“I promise I’ll always be here for you. I’m never leaving you.”
Hey there! Sorry for the long wait, but here's the new chapter. I've been feeling great lately, so I hope I can post chapters every few weeks. We'll see though!
“Hey! I’m serious. Stick to a small time gig for now.”
“I do, too, Tony.”
“So, if you don’t help me find it, I’ll rat you out to Steve.”
Sam and Bucky were shocked to find Steve waiting for them. They quickly glanced at each other nervously before Bucky spoke up.
“Oh!” Pepper exclaimed, but nevertheless hugged him back, “Hello Peter.”
“Is he really a god? Do you know where he keeps his hammer?” Miles asked excitedly.
He nodded. Tony smiled and Steve knew he was planning the day in head already.
So they continued the game with everyone, even Natasha joined after insulting the game. While he watched, Peter learned that they all really liked to mess around with each other.
Monica looked up her mom with a huge smile on her face. “I made a wish on a shooting star that you’d come home, and you did! Except, I think you were the shooting star.”
Peter shrugged. It didn’t really matter if he liked this school; he was stuck here.
Steve and Tony looked at each other in shock.
“You know we don't want you to forget about your old family, right? They were a big part of your life and you don't have to feel like you need to erase them to be a part of this family. We love you, Peter,” Tony comforted.
Peter could definitely see they were in love. It was a very sweet moment.
Thank you for literally everything you’ve done for everyone. You’re truly a hero, Mr. Stark. You’ve saved countless lives and the entire universe. I know you’re resting now, which you totally deserve, but I hope you know how grateful I, and many others, are for your sacrifice. You are Earth’s best hero and I don’t know what we will do without you, but I and the other Avengers will certainly try.
Tony looked up from his tablet and greeted him as well.
“Remember when I took you to his office to visit Goose?”
“Leave him alone. You’re all bothering him. I’m sure he just wants to learn like the rest of us,” MJ harshly stated.
“I know. I'll do my best,” he promised, knowing it would be hell to stay here for however long it would be until he was adopted. He was willing to bear it, though, because he knew it would pay off. Soon he'd be living with Steve and Tony in the Avengers Tower and everything would be okay.
“Whatever. I don’t want to be adopted so it doesn’t matter.”
“A horror movie!” Clint shouted with a smug grin.
“They are currently in your bedroom,” the AI replied.
Just so you know, she and Pepper seem to be doing well. May and I go over there for dinner time to time. It’s really nice.
“You're not letting our son go flying around the city. What if he gets hurt?”
Peter smiled and hugged his dads. He knew that they truly meant those words.
“Then why do you make them?”
Peter managed to keep himself together while packing and on the car ride to the Avengers Tower, but once he got there and saw Steve and Tony, he lost it again. They immediately pulled him into a tight hug.
He quickly entered the classroom so he wouldn’t have to deal with the hordes of people in the hallway. He headed to his seat between Ned and Miles. He already knew they were gonna freak out on him, but at least he kind of knew them already, and they were nice to him yesterday.
So Peter had his life figured out, but, like always, life threw him a curveball.
He sat up and sighed. “Okay, fine. Today sucked because everyone found out who I was and would not stop surrounding me and trying to talk to me,” both Steve and Tony frowned at that, “I eventually had to go ask the principal for help which did kinda help. There wasn’t as many people coming up to me by the end of the day. Also I got annoyed by some of my… uh, acquaintances.”
“What did I just agree to?”
Peter chimed in, “Yeah, I can relate.”
“I know, I know. I’m just not thrilled about going back. Can I have another day to relax here before going back to school? Please?” He begged his dads.
“Hey Jarvis, what’s that?” He asked while pointing at the mystery machine.
“You sure we can't just-” Tony started.
Tony blushed slightly and took a sip from his glass to hide it, unsuccessfully though.
“I will get him in a suit one day, Rogers.”
Ned seemed a bit shocked by Peter’s response, but ended up nodding and leaving the conversation there. Peter was glad to finish gym class off quietly.
“‘We’? Again? I didn’t lose it, dumbass!”
He closed his eyes and took a deep breath to calm himself. He would still be anxious, but at least now he wasn't panicking.
“I love you too, Gwen. You’re my everything.”
Steve sighed and shook his head.
Peter shrugged. He honestly didn’t really care if he had any friends. He had two loving parents and a home. That’s all he ever really wanted in life.
When the next Monday came around, Peter was dreading going back to school. Steve struggled with getting Peter up, but eventually managed to coax him out of his room.
“I’m not sure where he keeps his shield. I haven’t actually seen it yet. And his suits are in his lab.”
“Not really. Everyone just seems over excited.”
“Sure.”
Tony debated telling him the truth for a few seconds.
After about a month, his foster family wanted him gone. Peter was happy to leave, only he wasn’t aware that if he were kicked out of this house, he’d just end up in another one.
“Peter, please stop torturing yourself. Let yourself be happy. Let yourself be a part of a family.”
“Tony, honey, calm down. We’ll be fine. We’ll figure it out,” Steve tried to comfort him.
“Uh... shouldn’t be working on the assignment?” He tried to steer the topic away from his personal life.
Peter was a bit overwhelmed but nodded. Natasha walked over calmly, and weirdly intimidatingly, and sat down next to Clint.
“Tony? Couldn't you build a Baymax?” Thor asked him halfway through the movie. He seemed pretty attached to Baymax at this point.
“I know. They’ll be home as soon as possible. I know they miss you and are worried about you, too, but, until they’re back, I will be here for you.”
“Nerd!” Clint shouted while stealing some of Natasha’s popcorn.
Peter nodded. “Goodnight.”
Peter groaned dramatically. The last thing he wanted to do was sit around while people needed his help.
Pepper smiled. “Well, you’re welcome then. It’s time to go to school, though, so here,” she handed Peter his lunch, “and have a wonderful day.”
Peter frowned. He saw how hopeful they both were. He didn't want to disappoint them, but he couldn't let them adopt him. It was too dangerous. He shook his head.
“I really want to go to public school, though.”
‘At least I don’t have to keep running.’
“You seem to be in good mood,” she commented when Peter sat down at his desk.
Tony smirked, “I know something you can do.”
She scoffed. “And you think that’s gonna make him fall for you?”
“It will take a blood sample, a full body scan, and a personality test, then it will analyze your DNA to see any genetic mutations that could cause you to be enhanced, and if that doesn’t turn up anything it will use the full body scan and personality test to assess you too. Hopefully we can get it to function with just the body scan in the future.”
“So, Peter, we need to talk about adopting you,” Steve stated.
“May, I need help. I don’t know what to do,” he admitted, letting a bit of worry slip out of him.
“I'm fine. I just wish she was still alive.”
He felt the bed dip down on either side of him and hand gently placed on his back. He sighed into the pillow before flipping over so he could both breathe and talk properly.
“I mean take a break from being Spider-Man for a couple days while we figure this out.”
‘Wow. They really want me.’
He got up and hugged her tightly. “Thank you, so, so much Gwen.”
He wasn’t quite sure what to refer to MJ, Miles, and Ned at first. The word received a odd look from both of his dads, but they quickly returned to concerned.
“They’re all normal human beings. They do human things. Except Thor. I’m pretty he’s an alien that looks like a human.”
He quickly texted back “Who is this?”
When MJ, Ned, and Miles made their way to the table, Peter was surprised that Wade actually physically stopped them from sitting down.
“Hey, if you can pick it up, you're basically a god, and, if you can't, well then you're like the rest of us,” Bruce pointed out to him.
The only way she felt connected to Carol was through the stars. She loved to stare off into the night sky and try to imagine where she was now. She knew Carol was on an important mission to find the Skrulls a home, but she didn’t think it would keep her away for so long.
Peter sighed and grabbed the handle. He tried to lift his arm. The hammer didn't budge. He gave up and sat back down.
After his dads left, Peter awkwardly sat alone in the living room watching tv. He had the freedom to do whatever, but he still felt like an outsider in his own home.
MJ stood up and grabbed Peter’s arm. They walked over to the teacher and she spoke for him. Peter was grateful for that. He wasn’t sure he’d have the courage to just ask the teacher to leave class like that. Luckily, the teacher was sympathetic and even let MJ go with him to the principal’s office.
Peter started to worry that their argument would escalate and he'd get in trouble for it. It's happened many times before. He sat silent and hoped they wouldn't get mad at him.
Peter sat alone, waiting at the back of the classroom until one girl, who seemed to be drowning out the rest of the world by focusing intensely on her book, sat down directly next to him. This surprised him since there were plenty of open seats throughout the room. Peter wondered if she had purposefully sat next to him or just wasn’t paying attention. She hadn’t acknowledged his presence at all, yet she purposefully chose the seat next to him.
Tony cut him off, “Of course I want a kid.”
That was not the answer Peter wanted. He wanted to hear that his dads were on their way home already, or at least soon. The thought of being alone all night in the tower sent him spiraling. His heart felt like it was beating out of his chest and it was becoming more difficult to breathe. He quickly headed for the living so he could sit.
‘I need to open up to my dads to truly “be better,’ Peter thought to himself.
“Yeah, really,” Sam replied, “You should grab it and head out for your mission. You don’t want to be late.”
Tony glanced at Steve for a second before returning to Peter.
“Don't you wanna put on pajamas or something?” Tony asked.
“I’m just trying to help you out. I don’t want you to end up like me. Once you get to be my age, no one wants to adopt you. I want you to be happy and have a family.”
“So how about we pick you up tomorrow morning?” Tony asked Peter.
“That’s fair,” Sam conceded.
“Dad, you okay?”
“So?”
Peter nodded, but Pepper’s words only slightly eased his anxiety. He hated knowing that there was a chance that his dads wouldn’t make it home alive. His past only amplified his fears more. Even worse was the thoughts of what would happen to him if his dads died - like would he go back to foster care? Would another Avenger adopt him? It made him feel sick to his stomach.
Peter sat alone in the back of the classroom at a random desk waiting for class to actually start. He looked around the classroom and watched as students slowly began to trickle in. A few glances were thrown his way due to the fact that he was someone new, but no one really seem interested in approaching him. Peter assumed that was because he usually gave off a ‘please don’t look at me or talk to me’ vibe. He didn’t mind the lack of attention, though. He preferred to be invisible for the most part.
Tony gave her a bittersweet smile. “I wish I could be selfish sometimes. I wish I could’ve given up the suit and stayed here with you and your mom. Have my family in the woods, away from everyone.”
Peter rested his head on the table and sighed. He was now staring at the wine bottle Tony and Pepper had been drinking earlier. He was tempted to steal it, take it back to his room, and down it, but he resisted. That was something he would do back when he was a foster kid with a horrible life. He had a family now and he wanted to be better.
“No! You’re still wrong!” Clint shouted in denial.
“Hey, I can tell your mind is going to a bad place right now. Talk to me.”
Tony saluted him before grabbing plates and heading to the table. Peter followed him with silverware, slightly giggling still.
Carol chuckled. “Maybe.”
“Just leave, Wade,” MJ demanded one last time.
“I am working, but I don’t mind you being down here. As long as you don’t blow anything up.”
“You don’t know anything that we don’t know?” Ned seemed confused by his response.
“Oh, hey dads.” He smiled and waved.
The next day at school, Peter was moping around. He was upset he had to take a break from being Spider-Man and helping people. He was going against his nature by laying low and he hated it.
Eventually everyone settled down and watched the movie. Peter felt relaxed now that everyone was focused on the movie. He also felt somewhat safe sitting between Steve and Tony.
By the end of the movie, Thor shed a few tears. Who knew he'd be the one to cry during a Disney movie?
“Trust me, I'm not interested.”
Peter felt touched that Steve called him “their son”.
“This is a safe place, Peter. I got the best security system out there. Plus, Captain freaking America lives here!” Tony tried to comfort Peter.
“You could go talk to the principal. He can probably do something.”
Monica immediately ran forward and threw herself into her mom’s arm. She also couldn’t help tearing up a bit. Carol hugged her tightly and placed a kiss on the top of her head.
Bucky sighed. “Fine. We borrowed it and lost it. I’m sorry Steve.”
Tony considered it. Peter knew he probably just wanted him to get the best education possible.
“No,” Peter replied simply. He could see himself possibly becoming friends with MJ, but they’ve only known each other for a day. He didn’t see himself becoming friends with Miles or Ned. They were just a bit too much for him, and Peter didn’t even want to think about becoming friends with Wade.
Monica released Carol and grabbed her blanket before heading for the front door.
“Morgan.” He smiled back at her.
“Okay, fine. I just want to be like you one day.”
“I told you I’m taking you down with me.”
“Well, you can start tomorrow if I go drop the paperwork off this afternoon.”
Surprisingly, Peter held it no problem; it almost felt like it was made of styrofoam or something. He turned it over and saw it was a 50 pound weight. Peter dropped the weight in shock and it landed on Thor’s foot.
“Dude, you are screwed.”
“Is something wrong?” He walked over to husband and grabbed his hands.
Peter dropped his bag on the floor and hopped onto the bed. He looked up at the ceiling and smiled. This was the first time he felt happy in a long time.
“Behave you two!” they heard his Aunt call after them. They giggled while running upstairs.
“I’ve been watching you - not in a creepy way - but I already know a lot about you, Peter.”
Tony had a less stressful time getting Peter out, simply plucking him from the car seat and putting into the buggy, while Peter slept soundly on.
Sitting like that gave Peter time to think a bit more on his situation here. He was still baffled as to why he was reacting this way. It was like when he got his spider powers and all his senses were dialled to 11. Now it seemed that his emotions were constantly out of control and there was no way to stop them. He didn’t even have it in him to not take the comfort that was offered to him. Realistically he should be able to control his emotions the more he was here but it was getting worse, not better. He shouldn’t be crying at raised voices. Even though he always hated when Tony was angry with him, it never reduced him to tears like this did. He wondered if he would be able to learn some discipline with it. Going by Bucky he wouldn’t though. The minute Mama and Papa challenged him on being a little Bucky broke down. Peter had seen him cry more in one day here than he ever did in his own world.
“Do you think Bucky will be upset with his results?” Steve asked quietly, knowing that Bucky was not going to take well to it at all. He was denying that he was a little outright, despite all the telling signs.
“Sure am darlin’. You and Clint will be able to give out about us together. You start his training yet?” He asked Steve as if Tony weren’t even there.
It got so bad last time that when Peter went to bed Tony had to go with him to bed and wasn’t able to move until the next morning.
Bruce put the blood in some solution, giving the vial a shake. Usually, when the test was done it would turn up a few different colours. The main ones were for Alpha, Beta and Omega though. Alpha was a gold colour, Beta a brown and Omega a light blue colour. There were a lot of sub-classifications such as Lesser Alpha which more of an orange than gold and Carer which was a pinkish colour. There were endless possibilities for the test but the one thing about it was that it never lied, so how Clint was able to get away with being classified as a Lesser Alpha instead of an Omega was beyond them. They all watched on as Bruce shook the vial, waiting to see which colour would seep into it. None of them was shocked when it turned an almost powder blue/ white colour. That was interesting, Bucky noted. It was the same colour as Tony’s which meant, like Tony he was a submissive Omega. Those were quite rare and it was nearly impossible that they’d have two on their team. Nearly as rare as having two Higher Alpha’s on the team, like him and Stevie. The Avengers was just a team full of exceptions it seemed.
Peter watched curiously as they said their goodbyes to the nice lady and went through another set of doors. It was nothing like he was expecting, memories of small doctor waiting rooms with one broken toy set in a corner were quickly swept away with the waiting room he was in now. It was just as big as the foyer with a lot of comfy looking chairs and the biggest play area he’s ever seen in a waiting room. It even had a slide! It looked a bit scary though so he was going to stay with Mama and Daddy, just for a bit. He saw Bucky looking around as well before turning to Mama and letting out an annoyed cry. It looked like he was done waiting.
Hey! This was a request. This was one of the stories that were locked because someone reported it. Hope you like this and let me know what you think!
“Okay well, the results show that he’s a young little. Probably around the 9-12 month mark. He shows some cognitive ability and is able to recognise people he cares about but he’s still young enough that seemingly simple tasks elude him when he’s little.”
Tony rolled his eyes at his overdramatic child. “It’s right here baby. Relax.” He said, handing Peter a deep bucket. They’d tried to get a smaller one so he wouldn’t get too many sweets but Peter saw right through them. It happened every year and everywhere Peter made Tony make him one in his lab with Peter overseeing him.
Steve grinned handing him back his phone Twitter already open.
Steve raised an eyebrow at Clint’s accusing tone. “Why would I say it was a replica if it wasn’t?” He asked, baffled by Clint’s outrage. Clint didn’t respond though and just glared at him. Steve shrugged, fine. He didn’t care about what Clint did or didn’t think. His main concern right now was Tony and his need. “You ready for it?” He spent the last five minutes that it took Clint to get the dildo explaining to Tony what he was going to do. Tony wasn’t very happy with it but he agreed nonetheless. At his nod he raised Tony off his cock, ignoring Clint’s stare and shoved the dildo in straight away, stopping right before the knot. Tony’s whole body spasmed with the changeover, making him cry out.
Peter sat down and grabbed his lunch from his bag. Steve had made it for him this morning, but apparently he had snuck a surprise note in there while Peter wasn’t looking.
Wade shrugged. “You’ll learn.”
“He wouldn't get hurt. Plus, I would be flying with him.”
“Ta-da!” Tony cheered as held a smartphone in his hand. Peter gave him a confused look. He sighed.
Morgan let out a quiet sob and few tears as she turned off the Iron Man helmet and removed it. She held to against her chest as she cried. It had been 9 years since she had last seen her father, and she couldn’t believe she had actually managed to bring him back in a sense. He was just as perfect and loving and funny as she remembered him, too.
“For closure. I know you and dad haven’t like actually talked to each other in 3 years. I know you miss him and he misses you. You guys can still be friends.”
Peter was in awe. He never thought something like this could exist.
“Probably as a form of therapy. I wouldn’t say it’s the healthiest, though.”
They reached the edge of the lake. Morgan bent down and dipped her fingertips in. The water was cool and felt nice the hot summer day.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I will,” Peter promised as he released Steve.
Wade smiled. “Well, hello Peter- What’s your last name?”
“Peter! Come here!”
“Getting up. We gotta spend time with Peter,” Steve said from across the room.
Tony, Thor, and Clint continued to argue what they should watch. Peter could guess this was a normal experience based on Natasha’s reaction. She rolled her eyes then got up to get popcorn.
“Well, I have no clue how long the adoption process takes, but we're gonna get started right away,” Steve told him.
Unfortunately, he wasn’t alone for very long. Peter only had a chance to lay on his bed for about a minute before his dads were knocking at his door wanting to talk about his day. Normally, he would appreciate that he had loving fathers that wanted to know how he was doing and about his life, but at that moment all Peter could do is groan and bury his face into one of his pillows.
Peter was scared that he would never want to leave once he went there. He knew it was dangerous. He couldn't risk the safety of Steve or Tony, or any of the other Avengers either.
“Is this Peter?” she excitedly asked Tony.
“We have to know if you want to be adopted by us, if you want us to be your fathers.” Tony added to the pressure.
“I’m Peter,” he replied plainly.
“Especially since you had to wait so long,” Tony finished.
As a reminder, I have a
Bucky glared back at Sam. “Because I know you’ve taken it before, too.”
Peter frowned. “Do you miss Dad?”
Peter dreaded the thought of private school, but he kind of liked the homeschooling option. He wouldn’t have to leave the tower and deal with people bothering him. He did wonder, though, if his dads would be the ones teaching him, but he figured they would likely hire someone else to teach him.
“You're going as soon as possible. We’ll get your supplies tomorrow, and we can take you clothes shopping as well if you want,” Tony offered.
Sorry for the long wait, but I hope the extra long chapter will make up for it.
“You were cool up until like Tuesday, and then you just started acting like a jerk. That’s just towards me. You’ve been a jerk from the beginning with Ned and Miles. What’s your problem, dude?”
Peter groaned. There was no way he was getting out of this. “Alright. Fine I’ll meet them, if you give them my file before the meeting. If they still want me after that, then I’ll meet them.”
too early to be so cheery. He pulled a blanket over his face and ignored his dad.
“Yeah, don’t you have powers that alert you when people are around?” MJ questioned, “I literally just stood there and took a picture of you. I wasn't even hiding.”
“Even you. I don’t know why you think you don’t, but humans need people to talk to.”
Peter sighed. Answering questions was better than waiting for an argument between MJ and Wade break out.
“But we’re in class,” Peter weakly argued. He didn’t know why he even remotely cared.
The last time Peter saw his parents was on the morning of his 5th birthday. They dropped him off at his Aunt May and Uncle Ben’s house. They kissed him on the cheek and promised they’d all celebrate his birthday after the came home from work.
Monica laid down on a soft blanket on her front lawn staring at the starry night sky. It was a peaceful, warm, summer night, but she was too upset to fully enjoy it. It had been nearly a year since she had last seen her mom and every day she grew less and less hopeful she would ever be coming home again.
“How will it work?”
“I guess I'll be next,” Thor answered.
“Sorry to interrupt,” Alex called out, “Peter, I just want to say that this will probably be the last time we see each other, so I’d like to wish you the best and remind you that you do deserve to be happy.”
It was a bit awkward, probably because they weren't sure what to do. Peter smiled, though. His parents would always say goodnight to him when he was a kid. He hadn't had that for a while.
(See the end of the chapter for
They both laid back down. Peter had begun to doze off when he heard a weird noise. He sat up and looked around the room. He noticed the window was open and he panicked. Suddenly a hand covered his mouth before he could scream.
“Awesome! Dad took me to movies and dinner, and he bought me a new lego kit for Ned and me to work on!”
“I’m sorry, Peter. I still cannot tell you.”
Sam turned to Bucky and punched his shoulder.
“Yes,” he answered, glancing at Wade to see his reaction.
“Thank you,” he whispered.
“What happened?” Tony asked just as concerned as Steve now.
Peter rolled his eyes and let a little laugh. “Yeah, definitely. I’ll text Dad.”
Peter was surprised by her attitude, but she seemed chill so he wouldn’t mind being friendly with her.
“Did he just say he loved us?” Steve asked in disbelief.
“Regardless, you need to be more careful. Next time, it could be someone with bad intentions taking pictures of you,” MJ warned.
“Oh, it's a girl this time?” Steve teased, still focused on cooking.
“Hey kid,” he looked up at Tony, “ we know what happened, and you should know that will never happen again.”
“Why don’t you go hang out with them then?” he snapped.
He shrugged in response.
“I’m sure you’ll like after you spend some more time here.” Ned seemed confident.
“Oh… this is bad.”
Peter gripped the doorknob tightly. He was still panicking and Tony Stark deciding to talk to him didn't help.
“Tony, you are not letting him fly in one of your suits.”
“You know, Peter, when I first I met you I just thought you were a bit shy and maybe had some trust issues, but now I know you’re
Peter was grateful for MJ’s help, but he did wonder why she cared so much about him. She didn’t seem like the kind of person to make friend easily, but she seemed to like Peter already. It was a bit confusing for Peter, but he decided not to question it. He thought it was kinda nice to have someone like MJ around.
Steve and Tony have been married for 3 years now and they loved every second of it. They were in love, they had a huge family, which were the rest of the Avengers, and their lives were great. Their lives were great, and Steve wanted to share that with someone else. He wanted a kid.
He would get kicked out of that house too after about 3 months. They couldn’t handle Peter’s nightmares, and Peter was sent off to another home.
“Thanks for the breakfast, Pepper. You’re the best.”
“Come on in.”
(See the end of the chapter for
During one of the conversations they were having, Peter remembered looking over at Steve. He was smiling at Tony. Peter also noticed that Tony would look over to Steve occasionally and return his smiles.
“Ah, shit!” Peter winced and rubbed his face before picking his phone up again.
“How do you know that?”
“I’m glad you’re proud. That makes me feel at least a little bit better about the time I’ve had to spend away from you.”
“If I really wanted to, I could build anything,” He stated.
“Damn it, Natasha!” Clint whined.
Peter didn't sleep long. Despite the fact that he felt safe in the tower, he was still plagued with nightmares and bad thoughts.
Check out
“Stuff.”
Peter shook his head in disbelief. “Well, uh, thanks but no thanks.”
‘How did I even end up in this situation?’
“Me too, kid.”
Love, Peter Parker.
“Is this Peter?” Thor asked, ignoring Clint.
“My mother was the best. I loved her so much. She was always there for me and she always loved me. That’s the kind of parent I want to be, but her death broke my heart.”
“Hey, got everything set up? Do you need anything?” Steve asked as he glanced around the room.
“Yes, because one, it's
“Not really. He’s just making sure people don’t crowd around me.”
Sorry I haven't posted in a while. Finals kicked my ass, but I'm back and will be catching up!
He ran up to each superhero and gave them a big hug, which they all happily returned.
Peter sat down beside and looked at the screen. It showed blueprints for Tony's newest suit.
“I don't have any friends, I don't do any sports, and I'm not in any clubs,” he responded simply.
“When do I start?” Peter hoped it wouldn’t be soon.
He began to cry, and Alex looked a bit worried. Peter was crying for so many reasons. He had a family, but he also had a family. Peter wasn’t sure he was ready for this.
5:36 am.
“Why?” Tony asked confused as to why his file even mattered.
“Yes.”
He quickly scrolled through his notifications until something caught his eye. It was a text from an unknown number. He opened it and dropped his phone on his face in shock.
Peter was about to yell at Wade, but luckily he walked away. Peter sighed in relief.
Peter sat alone on the couch listening to his own erratic breathing until suddenly Tony’s face popped up on the TV screen in front of him.
Peter was shocked by this. He hadn't given any thought to his name. He certainly didn't think his parents would ask him if he wanted it changed.
“I know, but we’re gonna be great dads. We’ll love our son and everything will be perfect.”
“Steve, what are you doing?” He called out frustrated, his eyes still shut. He was determined to continue sleeping once he had his husband back in his arms.
“Well, we will leave you alone for a bit. You can come find us when you want a tour. We also have some plans for after dinner,” Tony told him.
“Hey kid, come check this out,” He called out and patted a spot on the counter next to him.
By the time me they sat down to eat, Peter no longer felt nervous around them. He was too happy to worry about the consequences of getting too close to them, at least for now. He just wanted to enjoy the feeling of being part of family, even though they weren't really a family yet. It was something he hadn't felt for a long time.
Steve turned his head slightly and made a somewhat disappointed face. “Well, you might make friends in the future, and even if you don't, you can always text us. I may not look tech-savvy, but I can use a phone.”
“Why aren't there any public schools here?” he questioned.
Tony felt his heart melt a little. Peter let go Bucky and ran over to Steve, throwing his arms around him tightly. Steve gratefully returned the hug.
Tony looked slightly surprised. “You want a kid?”
Tony knew that Peter wasn’t in the best mood, so he decided to try to cheer him up. “Hey, Pete, you wanna help me work on something down in my workshop for a bit?”
Tony was surprised by how well the night was going. After settling down to eat, they had made it all the way past dessert without any more awkwardness. He and Steve were joking around just like before, and Tony actually liked Bucky. He had a bit of a hard exterior, but he was genuinely a nice, smart guy that Tony had no problems with being around his son.
“Peter-” He cut off Wade by standing up and walking towards the exit. He weirdly felt somewhat betrayed, but mostly angry.
“Why wouldn’t I have to worry about foster care?”
“What is it?” he asked as he walked over.
“Finally, here’s the kitchen,” Steve said as he lead them into the last room, “and this is my boyfriend, James, or I call him Bucky,” he added, pointing at the man with long, brown, messy hair tied into a bun standing by the stove.
“Fuck it,” Tony said.
“Truth or dare.”
Tony smiled at Steve excitement. “I love you, too.”
He picked up his bag and got in their car. He wasn't surprised that it was very expensive. Tony Stark was a billionaire after all.
“I can already tell you’re going to be smarter than me one day. You have the best of me and your mother. You’ll change the world in ways I could never even imagine.”
“He’s deaf and he just turned off his hearing aids because he can’t handle the truth.”
Suddenly, they both heard Pepper’s voice calling from the front porch. “Morgan? Dinner time!”
“Woah, kid,” he exclaimed as he turned around and saw Peter, “Calm down. Tell me what happened.”
Peter was very intimidated by him. He nodded.
“I met him first,” she responded without looking up.
New chapter coming soon!
“Shut up and watch the movie,” Natasha stopped him from starting another argument.
“Oh,” Peter added, “and you can meet his boyfriend, too. His name is Bucky. I know you’re curious,” he teased.
“This is where everyone hangs out, as you can see, they are a bit wild,” Steve chuckled.
“Thank you so much, for everything. I’ll miss you.” He released Alex and chuckled.
Peter dropped the slice of pizza he was currently eating and stared down at the table. He could feel himself beginning to spiral.
The third house is where Peter lost his innocence.
Peter groaned in response and began eating.
Steve nodded and headed for the elevator. On the ride up to his floor he wondered what excuse he was going to get from the pair.
“No,” she simply stated and glared at Clint. Clint decided not argue after she uncovered his mouth.
“I’m Michelle, but my friends call me MJ,” she casually introduced herself as she looked Peter up and down.
The police told Peter to get a bag of his things, and when he did, he drove Peter and Gwen over to Gwen’s house. They both sat silent on the couch while the police explained what happened to Gwen’s parents.
“Rise and shine, Peter.” Steve’s enthusiastic voice was almost painful to hear.
Peter frowned again. He really didn't like the thought of private school. All the kids were usually rich and stuck up, at least in his experience.
He stopped crying when they let go of him, but he was still very emotional. This was a big moment for him.
She sighed before looking at Tony again.
“Peter? Your father called me. I also brought dinner,” she called from the kitchen.
“You lost your shield? You’re not that old, Steve.” Tony chuckled.
“I have a feeling it will,” Tony responded and kissed Steve’s cheek.
When Peter woke up the next day, he was still dreading going to school, just less than the day before. He figured since nothing eventful happened yesterday, that he would just be the forgotten new kid like he wanted. He would only had to worry about his classes and socializing now.
“How do you know? If it weren't for me, they'd all be alive!” Peter shouted at Tony, tears filling his eyes.
“Of course not. How about you guys just ask next time?” he suggested.
Eventually Steve couldn't resist asking, “Peter, do you want us to adopt you?”
He was crawling around on the floor of his parents’ lab. He was about 3 years old at the time. His parents were running around the lab like they were looking for something, completely forgetting about Peter who was on the floor.
“I’m fine, Wade,” he replied making the annoyance in his voice clear. It didn’t phase Wade at all, though.
Peter wasn't sure what to say at this point. He couldn't bring himself to say no, but he was scared to say yes.
When sat down she immediately put her book down and turned to Wade. “Leave,” she firmly stated.
MJ crossed her arms and paused, seemingly deciding whether or not she wanted to even answer Peter’s questions.
“I had a family…” he whispered.
,” Tony looked over at Bruce, who rolled his eyes, “two, it's appropriate for our child, and three, I actually kinda like it.”
“Uh, ok. Truth or dare?” Peter figured it couldn't be that bad.
One day he would truly understand what actually happened to him.
They both sincerely hoped that Peter would have lifetime of happiness after all he had suffered at such a young age. He deserved it.
“I’m not sure. I guess I don’t want to tell that story to just anyone. It’s weird to spill your whole life story to a stranger, you know?” he admitted.
Bruce chuckled. “I’m not sure if your fathers would approve of that.”
“You sure seem like a jock,” Peter replied softly.
“Ass-what?” He blurted out before he could stop himself.
Wade stopped walking and slid in front of Peter, causing him to stop as well. He had a big cheesy grin on his face.
“I know you guys took my shield.”
“Really? Wasn’t she like the one person at this school you could stand? I know only put up with me.”
“It’s nice. I don’t know,” Peter replied honestly.
“You know what’s next right?”
Peter didn’t sleep that night. He lied away sobbing and wanting to die. He couldn’t bring himself to go to school in the morning even though Gwen was there. He hid under his bed when his foster parents came looking for him.
He shrugged. “Sure, she’s fine and whatever, but I don’t need any friends, so it doesn’t matter.”
“Hey there! I’m Miles and this Ned. What’s your name?” Miles asked cheerfully once Peter had joined them.
“Well that doesn’t mean you cannot train. You just need to start small.” Thor tossed his weight on the floor. It landed with a loud thump that Peter could feel from across the room. Thor went over to grab the smallest weight and handed it to Peter.
“Let’s just go now,” MJ suggested casually.
“So how's school, kid?” Tony asked him.
“Peter? Are you back?” Aunt May called from the kitchen.
Everyone was staring at him yet again, but this time no one approached him. He wasn’t sure why at first, until Ned and Miles launched into a very enthusiastic conversation with him the second he sat down.
Peter sighed in defeat, but set off for his bedroom.. He was having such a lovely night, he just didn’t want it to end.
By the time Peter got to gym class, the day felt like it had been dragging on forever. He was so ready to go home, but unfortunately he was being forced to run laps around the gym.
Peter screamed and started crying. The spider crawled away and his parents quickly got him out from under the table. His father held him while he assumed his mother went to go kill the spider.
“Thank you all so much,” Peter whispered while he teared up.
When they reached his classroom, Wade said a quick, “Stay safe,” before walking off. Peter didn’t even have a chance to say anything even if he wanted before Wade was gone.
in depth history of Asgard, Peter went on exploring the tower. He decided to head down to one of the labs. Peter loved science and technology, not that he really got the opportunity to explore that interest until now, so he was hoping to fool around a little. He hoped Tony wouldn’t mind.
She smirked. “Alright. Who tops?”
“Yeah. Oh, and I met Dad’s boyfriend.”
“Okay, do you think Thor could bench press the Hulk?”
Steve chuckled. “Now I feel like a real dad. I’ll have breakfast for you after you get ready.”
Peter walked into the room and nearly fainted. Iron Man and Captain America were sitting there. They were two of the Avengers, huge celebrities, and they were here, wanting to adopt him.
“What do you think? It's a new design I'm working on.”
“Would you like me to try calling one of your fathers?”
“It’s okay, MJ. I’m happy to know my secret is still safe.”
He woke up. He was in his bed, in his room. It was night time. He looked around, just to make sure he was actually in his room. Everything seemed normal.
“Oh.” Peter relaxed.
After she left, Tony turned to Peter. “So, whatcha doing up, kid?”
Sometime in the afternoon, Gwen knocked on his front door. She had a present in her hands. Peter let her inside and they ran off to go play his bedroom.
“I haven’t even done anything yet!” Wade defended himself.
“You okay, Pete?” Tony called out as they entered the room.
“Peter, I know you're freaking out right now, but I need to you to take a deep breath and calm down. You're fine,” Alex told him.
“Again, do I really need school?” Peter asked, “I could just stay here and you could teach me. And then I could work for you. I really wouldn’t even need school then.”
After the tour, Peter felt like he could no longer tell them not to adopt him even if he tried. He loved the tower, he thought Steve and Tony would be great parents, and he actually felt pretty safe here.
Peter glanced over a bit surprised. He wasn’t quite sure how to feel about the fact that MJ considered him a friend already, but she did just defend him a few minutes ago. He decided not to think too hard about it and focused his attention on class yet again.
At this point, Peter realised he just had to just go over and apologize to them. He knew if even if they were still upset, at least they would know he was sorry, and maybe they would consider forgiving him.
He looked up when he heard a car. He saw Tony and Steve walking towards him. They both looked happy. He stood up and shyly greeted them.
“Today sucked,” Peter replied plainly.
He didn’t hesitate. “Yes.”
“What?” Wade’s face showed genuine shock. Peter wondered how often he got turned down.
“That is a to secret invention of your fathers. I’m not allowed to say anything more,” the robotic voice from the ceiling replied.
“Alright, fine. I won’t tell you how to live your life. What did Michelle even say to you anyway?”
“Have you come to train?”
“Oh, really?”
First he opened her gift. It was a friendship bracelet that matched the she was wearing.
“Woah, calm down, Pete.” Steve placed a hand on his shoulder. Peter sighed and sat back down.
“No coming unless from your cock, I know, I know. The replica counts though, doesn’t it?” Tony asked, hopeful that he would have at least 2 ways he was able to come instead of just through Steve fucking him.
Steve and Tony sat together in silence for a minute before Steve’s hand snaked down and wrapped around Tony’s cock.
Let me know what you think of this chapter :)
“Well done baby, now let’s go get ready for trick or treating. Steve, c’mon.” Peter jumped up and ran into his parent's room, he couldn’t wait until everyone saw their costumes. He thought they were hilarious, Papa thought it was cute and Mama thought it was ridiculous. He was still dressing up though. That was why he gave him the title Mama. Only Mama’s would find it ridiculous and still do it anyway.
crying, normally he could withstand a lot more pain than that but right now his emotions were all over the place, it must be something got to do with just waking up alive again. It was the only explanation he had for why he was currently clutching his head and sobbing loudly. He tried his best to be quiet but it just hurt too much.
“Steve, can you clean Jamie up while I get cleaned up. This isn’t something I can just wait for. Fri, start the bath please.” Tony said, as he was walking out of the room, Jamie let out a wail of displeasure at seeing Mama walk away. Peter felt himself getting a bit teary as well as he watched Mama leave.
Peter struggled to think back, sorting through all the clashing memories he had of Aunt May and finally seeing a memory of her here. “She’s still my Aunt.”
“Don’t do it again. Buckle in and we’ll get going.” Peter went to do as told and then groaned when he saw it.
“Sure baby, let’s take a photo together and post it. Let me see what your caption is before it goes up though.”
Today was the first day that both boys went down for their naps in their own cribs and without much fuss. Both men were in the living room, just enjoying the peace of having no children hanging off them for the first time in nearly a week.
He was quite surprised that after his initial panic where he thought that Steve would take Tony away from him, he took to Steve so well. Of course, he still went to Tony for most of his cuddles and comfort, but he had shyly come up to Steve and let him scent him. It was something that Omega pups took comfort in.
Okay. So the car seat had 3 points in favour of the car seat. The only thing he had in the con section was that he was not little right this second so he should have to go into the horrible contraption. He just knew once he was buckled in the only way out would be if someone undid the harness for him. His Mama was a genius for a reason.
“Meany, Mama.” He lisped out from behind the pacifier he was nursing, glad one of the adults were on his side.
Peter supposed he was quite lucky. His Dad still had a freaking car seat in his. He said it wasn’t but Peter wasn’t stupid. It had a five-point harness that no matter what he tried he couldn’t figure out. He was just lucky that the Land Rover had high seats so the booster would do the job easily. Not wanting to complain anymore in case he got in trouble Peter quickly buckled himself in. If he didn’t Papa would just sit and wait until he did. Or worse, go around to his side and buckle him in.
Did mama offer the waitress a job?
Tony chuckled, “He sure does, we have to make sure he gets a lot of love as well though. I don’t want him feeling left out because Bucky is going to be smaller than him and need more attention.”
“Sure, just don’t do anything illegal and if you get into trouble make sure to call me straight away.”
They finally broke eye contact and looked at Peter.
Sam bit his lip at the excitable child. Tony and Steve looked a mix between resigned and embarrassed. “I think that they look very real as well. You’re going to clean up in trick or treating tonight. All of you.” He laughed. “Where’s your bucket, Pete? I think Nat has a surprise for you.”
“Was it willingly? I’ll beat up and Alpha that thinks he can go and mark you without your consent.”
Steve read out the tweets that people sent over him writing Peter’s tweet. Peter giggling with each one that he read.
Peter pumped his fist in the air. “Yes! See Mama, I bet if I go onto my twitter I’ll have a blue tick and everything!”
Bucky was not going to be happy one bit when he woke up, Peter distinctly remembered Mama saying that Daddy would carry him into the centre.
“I have something even better for you.” Peter looked around Mama as he strapped him back in. What was better than pancakes?
“Can we? I know it’s silly and I trust Bucky but…” He trailed off, not knowing how to explain. Luckily Steve didn’t need him to.
“He’ll be fine. He’ll be way more upset if I don’t bring him. I can deal with a little bit of jealousy. He’s not even jealous in a normal way, he just clings more.”
Nah, Happy would be straight on the phone to them and then he’d be in trouble for no reason.
“Tony, you’d better be on your best behaviour. I have no issue spanking you where I need to.” Tony nodded impatiently. Of course, he was going to be on his best behaviour, he had to see if Clint was okay. That was the main goal here.
Bruce took the gloves off an disposed of them in the trashcan, coming back to write more on the clipboard before looking at Clint and Bucky.
“Sorry, bambino. Had to do some damage control, we both know that your favourite uncle Bucky is going to fill half of that bucket for you.”
“Who was it? I’ll have them killed for touching you. Jarvis, who went near Steve?” Tony asked, glaring at Steve while Steve glared at Clint.
Hey! This chapter was actually quite difficult to write, I'm not sure why but it was. I'm not entirely happy with it as it reads weird to me. Please tell me what you think of this chapter! Comments and Kudos are as always appreciated :)
“Yeah, bud. You and I will spend all day tomorrow with each other having fun and Sunday. I’ll only be gone a few hours I’d say.” Harley reassured him. Peter nodded, maybe Harley wasn’t sick of him after all?
Harley wanting tips was smart, Tony would help him out as much as he could but he wasn’t going to tell him everything.
Steve ran a hand through his hair in frustration, the thoughts of his baby being so open to the public eye sent a cold sweat through his body. It went against everything in him to let Peter have a Twitter but he knew he couldn’t protect him forever. Tony was right.
“Clint?” Steve called from where he and Tony were in the living room, he could feel his knot finally going down and they really needed to eat but Tony looked ready to go again. Luckily Steve thought ahead and had something that should keep him going until after lunch.
“Mr Parker, if you don’t calm down, I’ll be forced to make a call.” He professor said finally, sick of Peter’s jitters. Peter calmed down straight away, trying his best not to glare at the man. Papa rang one day and told the school that Peter’s final warning was that they were going to make a call. It was a sure fire way of getting him to focus because if he didn’t heed the last warning and continued on then they would actually make the call and Peter would have a red bottom by the end of the day. Sometimes it was worth it. Not today though, today he could very likely get the privilege of sweets taken off him which would be devastating.
(See the end of the chapter for
Natasha stared at him for a long time, long enough that Peter glanced back at his parents who gave him a nod of encouragement.
He pulled back from Tony and gave his most serious look. It was adorable, “I’m the best boy Mama.”
Steve cut a look at Tony that sent him racing down to Peter’s room. Tony knew he was in the dog house with Steve. That was one protective Papa. He knocked quietly on Peter’s door and poked his head in when he didn’t receive an answer.
“What will I mind and what did you put protection on?” Steve asked as he walked in, rolling the sleeves of his shirt up as he came in. Peter lit up when he saw his Papa and jumped up running to him for a hug.
Tony brought his hands around to cover his bottom when he felt Clint and Natasha’s eyes wandering.
Clint could see why, Tony looked completely blissed out, hips moving back and forth, working the last of Steve’s knot. His legs were splayed wide open on either side of Steve, giving Clint a clear view of just how hard he was working the knot. “Sure thing Cap.” He nearly choked on his pasta when he opened what he now realised was a storage space and not just a decorative piece. Every type of sex toy imaginable was in this box that the lid on the inside labelled them as ‘Tony’s toys’. Steve was serious about this whole ‘Traditional Alpha’ route he was taking. He’d only heard about boxes like these mentioned on television. They were common in traditional households so that the Omega knew each room was equipped to deal with them should the need arise with their Alpha. Obviously, Steve was prepared to have Tony as his Omega because this had arrived at the tower a few months ago. There was dildo of all shapes and sizes, along with butt plugs, some of them had wires and remotes while some were of the old school variety. Anal beads, prostate massagers, a few different kinds of fleshlights, penis pumps, there was also chastity cages, why there was so many Clint couldn’t fathom, he only had one cock right? Along with different types of paddles and nipple clamps. Poor Tony, Steve was going to do a number on him with his training. He found the blue box quickly enough within the ottoman, everything else was put in loosely but neatly so it stood out. It was a long and wide box that had a good weight to it with three little-hinged locks and made Clint curious. Food could wait, he wanted to know what was in the box. He brought it over to Steve who was whispering quietly in Tony’s ear while playing with the come that was over Tony’s stomach always keeping his hand away from Tony’s angry looking cock.
“Okay, can I see Clint now?” He asked. It was like an itch, he had to see if he was okay.
“Jamie, you need to relax, you have an upset tummy. You need a bath and some quiet time, not all this.” Steve tried to reason with him as Jamie continued to struggle away pushing and slapping him, while Peter continued to cry.
Peter’s eyes sprung open at that. He was curious to see what questions people had for him. First, he had something important to do. He jumped up off the couch and gave his Dad a hug.
The longer it took to arrange the better in his opinion.
“Hmm, and why is Petey big brother and not little brother.”
Somehow Tony knew he’d be roped into it as well.
him to move. He tried to rock his hips but Steve stopped him with a laugh and when he went to touch his cock Steve slapped his hand away.
Slowly Steve reviled what he was hiding and Tony couldn’t help the startled breath he took. In Steve’s hand was a collar, it was thin but durable looking, made of black leather, with a D ring on the front, a tag hanging from it that declared him to be Steve’s. The clasp of the collar had a key hanging from it, meaning Tony wouldn’t be able to take it off without Steve’s permission. By Tony’s judgement, the collar would sit on his neck snuggly, right under Steve’s claiming bite. It would be just another way for Steve to stake his claim on his omega. Tony couldn’t help but feel a bit upset at the prospect of wearing, what was essentially, a dog collar. Steve must have seen his face fall because before Tony knew what was happening he was enveloped in Steve’s arms, soaking in the comfort he was given.
“Yeah, we’ll argue that another day. Right now though in you go. If nothing else it makes for a good bed.” Peter grumbled but did as was asked, sighing in comfort when he sank into it.
Clint’s muscles were too much like jelly for him to move so Bucky just picked him up and carried him to the chair.
“Here darling, you cuddle with blankey here and rest your eyes we’ll be there in no time okay?”
Bucky nodded, placing one on top of the other. He was only able to get four stacked up before he brought another block down to smash them all, giggling at the crashing noise it made.
“Friday, can you call Bucky and Bruce in please?” He asked as he undid the button and zipper of his jeans, letting his hard cock spring out. “Come here sweetheart.” He made sure the dildo was still suctioned to the chair before lifting Tony off it. He smiled as he heard his groan. Steve had found out fairly quickly that Tony hated the empty feeling during his heat. He wasted no time positioning himself so that he could slide straight into Tony to the hilt. He didn’t bother to fuck him too much, just enough to get his knot to lock them together. He wanted Tony to be aware of what was happening. He felt more than heard Tony’s dry orgasm as he writhed on Steve’s lap in pleasure. Clint was still looking on, extremely pale and shaking slightly. He opened his mouth to talk but was silenced with a look from Steve.
“No I’m not,” He argued, “You’ll keep getting bigger as well and we’ll just continue this forever until we’re both old men.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony glanced at Steve and nodded, he’d let him take this part.
“Okay, darling. We’ll sit down and I’ll take you.” Tony cooed, walking over to a set of four chairs around a small table. There were a few other people there as well but it wasn’t overly busy. No one paid them any attention.
“You know it,” Steve growled in Tony’s ear as he continued to jerk him, Bucky walked out of the room, laughing as he heard Tony continue to sass. Steve really had his work cut out for him.
“There are a few main rules. One is that when you're around Tony will be going around in only a shirt and nothing else. I wanted him naked at all times but he negotiated with me.”
It only took Steve to nod once and Tony was off like a shot, rushing into the living room. The sight that he came into made him stop in his tracks, unsure of what he was looking at for a minute until it all became clear. Clint was strapped down on a breeding bench with a fucking machine behind him, pounding him hard and fast. The whirring of the machine was loud in Tony’s ears and he couldn’t look away no matter how much he tried. He could see Clint’s cock underneath swinging back and forth, with a puddle of cum underneath him. Clint’s eyes were closed, his mouth slightly open as he continuously moaned his way through the fucking.
Tony dug Peter’s phone out of his pocket and handed it to the boy.
“Ah, there we go. I think he’s had enough now.” Bucky said happily, getting up to let Clint out. Not before he reached under and began to stroke Clint’s cock hard and fast, getting whines out of the omega. His cock must have been super sensitive after just coming and all he could do was whine and buck into the hand. Bucky must have been at it for at least ten minutes before Tony heard him.
“If he comes on the sofa you’re cleaning it,” Clint muttered seeing Tony’s cock hitting the cushion.
Steve shrugged, seeing the how comfortable Peter was in his skinny jeans and Ugg boots. Peter was happy, healthy and one of the kindest boys he’d ever met. Steve knew that he was being biased but as Captain America, he had met many kids.
He gave his Omega cock another pump and let go, bringing his hand back to hold just before his knot. He didn’t want Peter to come back to them tied. He was sure it would happen in the future but for day one he wasn’t going to traumatise his new son. He could feel himself coming and thrust harder, Tony was whining with every thrust and Steve felt for him. He had positioned them so that the side of the couch rubbed against his cock. He pushed into him on last time, giving his ass an appreciative smack as he came into Tony’s hole. He pulled out when his cum started to taper off and pushed Tony’s shirt up further. Letting the last drops, hit his back.
Tony had been notified by Friday that Peter was up and was talking to himself, saying that he would show them he was a big boy. Tony went and peaked in on him, grinning when he saw his little boy, bare-bottomed, trying to pull his sweatpants up his legs. He had left and told Friday to let them know if he needed help or was upset. Looks like he got the whole way to the living room before his big boy bravery failed him.
“Sorry, Clint but I was really tired after school and I can only save one person each time. I promise next time it’ll be you okay?”
Steve stopped the buggy to let Tony undo Peter’s straps and take him out, bouncing him in his arms when Peter dived for his neck.
Steve stood up and moved the both of them so that Tony was over the arm of the chair. He made sure he was comfortable before he began to ride him hard and fast, the slap of skin against skin making a loud noise in the room. All Tony could do was hang on for the ride. It was embarrassing enough with Bucky and Clint watching, he didn’t need them to see how turned on he was as well.
He looked over to his eldest that was cuddling his ironman plushie and also sucking on a pacifier. He continued to sway with Bucky as he addressed Peter.
Tony beamed up at him as Steve carried him into the kitchen where the rest of the team were having lunch. “Thank you, Alpha.” Steve really was the best.
“Yeah, the poor baby didn’t realise he was mumbling about how magical pacifiers were at helping him calm down and ‘maybe Mama will let me not sit in the cool spider-man car seat if I give him the pacifier?’ I was literally just standing there waiting for him to work up the courage to put it into my mouth and ask his question. It was precious.” He laughed.
Natasha smiled, sitting across from them. “Friday told me that they were over the worst of it, so I said I’d come up and check on how their parents are doing. You both look like you haven’t slept in a few months.” She said shrewdly. Neither man could argue with her. Even Tony, who was used to going on creative binges, was exhausted to the point of delirious.
That confused Steve even more. He’d made sure to never overstep with Peter before he and Tony were mated. He knew how overprotective an Omega could be over their pups.
“Papa and I monitor your twitter feed. Once the account is set up then I’m putting in some muted words and accounts that I don’t want you looking at and you’re not to take them off. Karen and Friday will be both monitoring that part of it. You also put it on your account bio that we’re monitoring it and you follow both of us.”
“Papa
Since then, whenever his Dad was in the car with him he had to sit in it.
Before the comments come in. No Peter does not have autism. Yes, it might be odd that he is treated younger but it is what it is, read it how you like. No, I do not think it is abusive or promoting abuse and no he does not have a mental illness. Yes, he does get corner time and spanked in this story, please read the tags. Thanks for taking the time to read this to anyone who is enjoying the story.
“Sure baby. You sit down beside Papa and I’ll make some dinner while the two of you answer the questions.”
Steve rolled his eyes at his son. “I know, I’m just the worst making sure you don’t die in a car accident. You’re weight and height go against you unfortunately and until Dad and I are happy that you’re big enough to sit without on the booster it is. Count yourself lucky, I could have collected you in Dad’s car.”
“Yes, sir,” Clint responded, unsure why the sir slipped out or why it felt so natural. By the quirk of Bucky’s lips, he said the right thing.
Tony and Steve just sat in silence for the first few minutes after Peter fell asleep, relishing in the silence after Bucky’s and Peter’s meltdowns. It was Steve that ended up breaking the silence.
“Pete, you really have to look before you run into rooms.” Tony rolled his eyes but opened his arms for the hug he knew Peter came for. Peter gladly went into his arms, squeezing his father tightly.
“’ Kay Mama, let’s get move on.” Tony had to bite back a smile, gosh his eldest was just the cutest when he parroted one of the adults.
Steve’s brow creased and he cracked open an eye.
“Okay, you’re my big boy, but you’re still my baby right?” Peter bit his lip. He really wanted to say yes because he loved being his Mama’s baby but at the same time, he remembered his old life when his Mama wasn’t his Mama.
Steve waited until he knew Peter was far enough away that he couldn’t hear and turned to Tony, pulling up his shirttails and taking hold of his hard cock giving it a few pumps until it was leaking pearly liquid.
“Oh sure. Definitely me and not you. You’d never boss anyone around, Mr CEO.”
Both winced when Steve walked by carrying a crying Peter in his arms, glaring at the two of them.
“Not sleepy,” Peter complained. He slept for ages today, he didn’t need any more sleep.
“You’re okay baby. It’s okay. Steve, will you get me a bottle for him. It’ll calm him down.” Steve nodded and rushed back into the kitchen, putting a bottle together in record time and handing the warm bottle to Tony who had settled with a crying Peter on the couch. Peter’s cries tapered off once he had the bottle in his mouth and was focussed on drinking it down instead of his fright.
Peter pulled Steve into the elevator. “Hi, Friday!” He said happily.
“Whoa, what’s wrong their little man? Do you not want to stay with your aunts and uncles? Not even uncle Rhodey?” Peter shook his head. No way. He was not leaving his Mama’s arms and that was final. He began to tremble when he thought that his Mama was going to put him down, and clutched onto him tighter. He couldn’t do this, not when his mind was all over the place and the only real thing he knew was that he loved his new Mama. He didn’t relax until he felt his Mama walking away from the noise of the common room.
“You can ride it the in the kitchen. You’re not allowed to take that knot though until at least half your plate of pasta is gone. Understood?” Tony nodded quickly, wanting to get to the kitchen as fast as possible so he could just get working on the knot. He needed it badly.
“You have loads of questions. You can answers as many as possible until dinner is ready and then no more phone for the evening okay?”
Then there was another point he had to give when he saw the Stark logo on it. He wasn’t 100 per cent sure but he would bet that Mama made it himself.
Tony hated that they weren’t softer, stating that Bucky and Peter deserved only the best. Knowing Tony he had a new model in his lab with a headrest of the littles.
Let me know what you think. Comments and kudos are always welcome :)
“Yeah, Where are we?” Peter usually slept for a bit longer and was completely disorientated from it.
“During your heat, it brought you relief to be filled and knotted. This week though, I’m going to train you to respond to my cock at all times. You’ll be spending a lot of this week riding my cock and focusing on staying hard at all times with me.”
“Good boy.” He heard his Mama murmur before a pacifier was placed in his mouth. It was the final push that Peter needed and he heard no more as he succumbed to his post food lethargy. He’d find out what was going on after a well-deserved nap he was sure.
“Oh hush, you’re getting your cookie.” Mr Stark said, breaking a bit off before taking his baby finger and placing it on Peter’s chin to open his mouth and pop the cookie into his mouth. Peter hummed happily eating the small bit of cookie, opening his mouth expectantly for the next bit when he was done. Mr Stark was prompt and gave it to him straight away, chatting with Black Widow while he fed Peter. It dawned on Peter as the last piece of the cookie was going into this mouth that he was being treated exactly like a young baby was. Why was he accepting this so easily? He should be fighting this or trying to figure out what happened, not just sit here and let them treat as if he was way younger than he was. He looked around at everyone else to see if they were finding this as unusual as he suddenly was. It wasn’t until he caught eyes with Mr Winter Solider and realised he wasn’t alone. Everyone else was acting like this was completely normal though which was strange, maybe Mr Winter Soldier had gone away when he did and was only back now?

Peter was sitting on the bed in his pyjamas, knees up against his chest, hair dripping with excess water and eyes red-rimmed.
. Luckily his Mama came back in and he instantly reached his arms out to be taken away from Daddy.
“Yes! Trick or treating!” He jumped out of the bed and took off down the hallway. “Mama c’mon!” He called as he ran, making Tony chuckle. For some reason Peter went between calling him Dad and Mama. He’d say it was a fifty, fifty divide on it but Tony found himself not caring too much about it. He had asked Peter about it once and the boy blushed a bright shade of red and shrugged.
“I guess I’m good for now.”
Tony ruffled Peter's hair as he downed the rest of his drink. He set the glass back down on the table and then headed towards the hallway.
He was trapped because this time he couldn’t run away and skip school like he would’ve done before. He had to actually face this uncertainty. Peter almost wished he was someone who loved attention because then he would be having the time of his life. Instead, he was fighting off a panic attack as he and the principal exited his office to go meet up with a student who was going to give him a tour of the school before his first class.
“Sorry, but it is your fault that I have to go to school,” Peter said while he and Tony started walking towards the kitchen. “I wanted to stay here and work with you.” Peter gave Tony a slight pout.
Peter knew she was right.
Finally, the period Peter had been dreading arrived; Lunch. He was dreading walking into the cafeteria and finding a place to eat. He didn’t exactly have any friends saving him a seat at their table. He was also worried about running into Wade. He wanted to avoid him like the plague.
Hey guys. So I created
“I got my stuff,” Peter called as he ran down the hallway and back to the dining room.
Steve and Tony sat on both sides of him on the couch. Natasha and Clint shared the love seat next to him. Thor and Bruce each sat on their own chairs.
He frowned. “No thanks,” he simply replied and flopped down onto his bed.
“He doesn’t even want to be adopted?” Steve almost felt heartbroken. He hadn’t even met the kid yet, but he was still upset.
“How are you, Petey?” Wade asked lovingly.
He grabbed Gwen’s hand and they walked into the livingroom. She screamed and Peter fell to his knees and began sobbing. His Aunt and Uncle were lying dead, and bloody on the floor. Gwen dropped down on her knees and hugged Peter. They both cried until police showed up. Someone had called the cops for them.
Peter smiled slightly. He looked over at Tony, who was clearly done arguing with Clint.
Peter’s next class was chemistry, and he was unfortunately paired up with 2 very talkative, overly-friendly boys to work on a lab assignment with.
Wade started laughing loudly, and this caused Peter to feel insecure. He wondered if Wade was just messing around with him like others had in the past.
Two quick questions. One, what should Peter call Steve and Tony? (Ex. Dad, Pops, Father, etc.) Two, who should else should I add for Peter to meet at his new school? I already have a few people planned like Deadpool, but I want to know who you guys think should be added. Thanks.
Peter eventually crawled under one of the tables in the lab, then froze when he saw a bright-colored spider on the ground in front of him. Peter wasn’t fond of spiders, but he wasn’t scared of them. He decided he would go crawl somewhere, but the spider had other plans. Before Peter could crawl out from under the table, the spider crawled up his arm. He shook his arm in an attempt to get the spider off of him, and that’s when the spider bit him.
“But what if I hurt them too?” Peter whispered so quietly Alex almost didn’t hear him.
“I know everything I need to know.”
“Okay, I get why you might not want to talk to them… but you have been kinda rude to them.”
As the object she no longer believed to be shooting star raced towards her, she stood up and quickly started backing away before it landed in front of her on her blanket.
“I promise I’ll never take it off!” he declared. She giggled.
When Peter arrived at school, he finally began to see the fallout of all of his previous actions. Wade was nowhere to be seen. He had backed off after lunch yesterday, but Peter thought he might come back the next day. He didn't. Things were worse in first period. MJ didn’t even look in his direction for the entire class. It was obvious she was still upset, and Peter felt incredibly guilty. Things were just as bad in chemistry. Ned and Miles didn’t spare him a glance either.
An excited smiled popped on Wade’s face as he silently cheered. Peter was a bit weirded out by Wade’s reaction. He had a hard time believing Wade was that excited about him being single.
“We know you love us, Peter,” Tony teased.
“Feeling better?”
“What’s the problem?” Bruce asked while walking over to Peter.
“Hey Peter,” Clint called out to him, “wanna play a game?”
Only they never came back.
“Knock yourself out, kid.” Steve smiled mischievously.
Peter willed himself to stop crying. He was happy, but he was also sad, and angry, and scared, and a million other things. It was too much to handle in one moment.
“Do you think this will be enough to convince him?” Steve asked.
‘How can I be sure I won’t hurt them?’
“I’m not so sure about that,” he commented before heading into room to finally retrieve his shield.
He patted the chair next to him. Peter sighed and collapsed into the chair. He pulled out his phone and opened the conversation with the unknown number before handing it to Tony. He watched nervously as Tony read the texts.
“Yeah,” Peter nodded and paused, “Hey, maybe you should come have dinner with us next weekend.”
He slowly walked in and found Tony, with his back to him, talking and drinking wine with some woman. She saw him and smiled.
Alex brought him back to reality. As he followed Alex down to his office, he felt anxiety spread through his body. He stopped walking, he couldn’t breathe.
Peter began to worry while his mind wandered on what would happen when he encountered people throughout the day. The tower was a safe place for him. He noticed paparazzi outside sometimes, but they couldn’t get in. And they were likely there before he was adopted. They also never gave him, Steve, and Tony trouble when they went out as a family because they left from a hidden area. Peter had no experience dealing with a situation like the one he was now in and that terrified him.
“Not impossible, just extremely unlikely,” Bruce told him.
“How many suits do you have?”
“Yeah.”
Steve put on his Captain America face and ignored the team’s laughter.
“Peter, you’ve had a rough past. Things are different now. You can be happy. You won’t hurt them, trust me. You just need to let yourself be happy.”
Morgan, along with Tony, stepped off their front porch and onto the grass. She began to guide them towards the lake that was beside their house. They both loved the lake.
“What are you doing?” he asked.
They all froze, except for Natasha who took this opportunity to grab the remote, then she hopped onto the couch with a smile.
“Hey where’s dad?” Peter asked after noticing only he and Steve seemed to be up already.
He fulfilled his Aunt’s wish. He made a friend. Peter expected to just talk to the girl in class so she wasn’t lonely, but over the course of the year, he actually began to like Gwen and they eventually became best friends. From that point on, they were inseparable.
“How can you have too many?” Peter asked sincerely while still admiring the suit in front of him.
Peter hugged his knees to his chest. Steve looked over at him.
Sorry for the delayed update. I try to update 1-2 times a week, but I just didn't have a lot of time this week.
“A friendship bracelet. It’s from someone special.”
Peter groaned yet again, not caring if his frustration was known.
“No need to apologize. We understand,” Steve responded giving Peter a warm smile.
‘Just let myself be happy.’
“Don't worry. We've already picked out some great schools,” Steve reassured.
Peter reached the main office where the principal was waiting to greet him. He was given his class schedule and the principal talked about how glad he was to have Captain America and Iron-Man’s son in his school. That caused Peter to wonder how many people knew exactly who he was and how they would react.
“No turning back now,” he joked and laughed. Peter rolled his eyes and smiled a little. Then Alex got serious and explained what Peter would need to know about being adopted.
Bruce looked at the result of the vial and wrote something on his sheet before looking back at Clint with a small smile. “Awesome. Let’s move onto the physical. Can you stand up for me?” He asked, raising a brow when Clint’s hand shot out to clutch onto Bucky. “Bucky can stay with you. He can even still hold you if you like. I just need you standing for one or two things.”
Bucky took the blanket greedily and shoved it between the headrest and his head, turning so he could shove his face into the blanket for comfort. It only took a few minutes of driving for Bucky to drift off, his little snores filling up the car. Peter wasn’t far behind him, all it took was giving him his iron man plushie and he was out for the count as well. It was lucky too. The drive was around 2 hours long. This was the best scenario he could have hoped for.
Peter listened while his Dad and Harley talked the whole way home, feeling slightly left out that they didn’t even bother to try and include him. Harley was telling a particular story where his friends convinced him to go down a super steep hill and he ended up falling. Dad gave out to him but Peter just thought that it made Harley even cooler than he already was. He decided to insert in himself into the conversation.
“Shh, there you go. Did you bang your head? Poor baby.” He heard the person holding him say. Peter’s brow creased in confusion, that sounded like Mr Stark. He wiggled in his arms, trying to feel the arc reactor and, yep. There it was. His wiggling got him a pat on his bottom and more shushing. It didn’t make sense though, why would Mr Stark be here? Holding him like this? The relief that he hadn’t been kidnapped was immense but he was still pretty confused as to why he was being treated like a baby.
“Actually Papa I’m suddenly not very hungry. I might just go take a shower.” Steve didn’t do much more than blink at him. Peter was always hungry so him saying he wasn’t was cause for alarm. Then add that he was willingly having a shower over a bath and Steve knew that Peter was feeling a lot worse than he let on. Steve decided to not force Peter to see them.
Peter swung his legs back and forth as he waited for his parents to get ready, laughing when Papa gave out about wearing Ugg boots.
He didn’t plan on falling asleep but the peace in the living room, the hum of the movie and his Papa’s solid body beside him made it easy to just nod off.
Peter shook his head while Mama wrapped him in a big fluffy towel and carrying him into his nursery.
An update I know. Crazy times. I'm heading to Scotland for the week so I said I'd put this out and post another update when I'm back.
Steve curled his arms around Tony, pulling him back so he could cuddle into him properly, brushing his lips against Tony’s neck, smiling when Tony unknowingly rocked back against him.
“Well, I know a part of Tony likes it anyway.” He teased. Tony was mortified, of course, his body would betray him. Trying to take his mind off of it he looked back over to Clint. It proved to be a stupid thing to do because just as he did he saw Clint clenching on the machine and more come falling to the ground.
Clint flushed as all eyes turned to him, he ducked his head to get away from the stares, Steve’s in particular.
“Boo.” He Papa said when his head was finally free, and tapped him on the nose.
Both took off at a quick walk to get to the terminal that Harley was going to meet them at and Peter had never been happier that he was holding his Dad’s hand. He would have definitely gotten lost without the added security.
Steve shook his head. “You both messed up big time. Enough that Peter can’t bear to face the two of you. What are you going to do about it?”
Oh yeah, they were definitely in trouble.
Bucky barked out a laugh, ran an affectionate hand through Tony’s hair while ignoring Steve’s warning growl. “I’ll get out of your way now. The rest of the team are asking about him so I wouldn’t stay cooped up in here too long or you’ll have a lot more visitors than me. Tony all you have to do is tell me if he’s not treating you right and I’ll sort the punk out for you, okay?”
The utter defeat in Peter’s tone broke Steve’s heart. He and his husband would be having very strong words tonight. Steve knew Peter sometimes had a hard time in school. He was younger and smarter than his class. The usually bred resentment. He was lucky he had good friends in MJ and Ned. His decathlon team were pretty protective of him as well.
) he became his Omega. The first ‘rule’ made Tony simultaneously hot and then cold. He wanted Tony naked at all times around the tower. Tony wasn’t a prude by any means but come on! When he pointed out that he worked with open flames a lot of the time, Steve conceded and said that he could wear one of his shirts. He was a saint really. He also said something about training but Tony had stopped listening and fled the room out of sheer embarrassment from the first one. He heard comments from Bruce and Clint about bashful Omegas. Him, bashful, as if!
“It’s even better when we’re in rut, isn’t it? Omega’s feel great then. When they’re begging for it and want nothing more than to please us. There’s nothing better than that feeling.” Steve continued, playing with Tony’s pebbled nipples, seeing Clint unconsciously bringing his hand up to his own chest.
Oh. Looks like Steve was right.
The men looked at each other, Tony smiling slightly, giving himself permission to enjoy this world a bit more. As Natasha summed it up perfectly, there wasn’t much more to say. Hence, they continued to sit in silence until Friday piped up, “Sir, Master Jamie is awake.”
“Yeah, we’ll be there to collect you at 4.30. Are you at the airport?- You sure you don’t want to use the private jet?- Okay, okay! Jeez, you’d think I wasn’t a billionaire or something.- Right, I’ll see you later today. I’m collecting Pete after school so he’ll be there as well. He’ll probably be half asleep though.- Okay, see you then.”
Steve settled back to watch Tony on the dildo, he looked amazing riding it. His tanned skin with a light sheen of sweat coating it, the movement of his subtle muscles in his arms and legs. His head thrown back, not caring about the audience he had. It was funny, he mused, that not even an hour ago he didn’t want to go around the tower naked and now he was sitting with the rest of his team not caring who was watching as he milked the fake cock.
