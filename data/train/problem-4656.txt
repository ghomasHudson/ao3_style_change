Dean holds up a hand. “C-c-can we t-t-talk ab-b-bout th-this when my b-b-brain's n-not t-t-tryin' to l-l-leak out through my ears? A-a-and th-this,” he gestures at his mouth, “isn’t a-a-acting up as m-m-much? Please.”
“You mentioned that you get why you and me—why Sam reacted the way he did and was then confused by his own reaction. And I’m not asking you to disclose private things that he’s told you, but I. I’d like to understand.”
Dean would probably tell him that he's acting like 'overcompensation city,' but securing a perimeter is just second nature by now. Or so he tells himself. Rationally, he knows that they're all far from helpless, but Castiel just wants them all to be safe, especially today.
"Is… Is it selfish that I still wished my Mom was here?" His voice is watery and his eyes are glassy, looking at Castiel almost pleadingly.
“The last I saw him he was lounging in a pool chair, updating the archives.” Cas watches him with a soft look in his eyes. “He’s alright, Dean. He seems a look more at peace since you two spoke.”
Jack's expression crumbles, and Castiel draws him in to hug him, rubbing his back and swaying them gently from side to side. It's what he's learned to do to comfort Dean, and it works with Jack too. Soon enough, the boy leans back and wipes his eyes and nose on his sleeve.
Cas smiles softly and shakes his head, but he also takes his hand off Dean's back, and Dean has to fight down the urge to grab it and put it back there.
The nice feelings fade away when he’s done brushing his teeth and walks back into the empty room. After shutting off the light, Dean tosses and turns for a while. It’s not that the bed isn’t comfortable, but that it lacks—well, it lacks Cas. Cas, and his stupid body heat and stupid solid weight and stupid beefy arms and stupid calming presence.
Dean only curls himself up tighter in response, and Castiel understands that this is one of those times when it’s important to let Dean hide himself, when everything that could be said would only overwhelm and anger him.
Dean’s fingers dig into the skin right under the scar left by the spear, but he manages to hold back and not hurt himself.
Dean grins at Castiel wolfishly, a twinkle in his eyes, and fondles the meat on the grill with the barbeque tongs. “Come to help me ha-ha-handle my
Since the weather is supposed to be dry and sunny, they’ve decided to buy a grill and host a barbecue outside. It was Dean’s idea, and Castiel is doubly relieved that Dean’s feeling better since he’s been looking forward to it so much.
He quickly goes over yesterday in his head while leaning against the counter sipping his coffee—they stocked up on groceries, drove back home, Dean cooked, took a shower before bed, then Cas came into his room and they talked a bit until Dean fell asleep.
“Sam’s just j-j-jealous he don’t sound l-l-like he g-g-gurgles grav-v-vel every m-m-mornin’. F-f-forget ‘bout him, Cas. Bes-s-sides, he a-a-ain’t here. ‘S just me, a-a-and I l-l-like your v-v-voice.”
Sam is handing out glow sticks to hang around their necks, and the mere sight of the things is enough to make Dean’s stomach churn with the memories they’re dragging to the surface. When Sam hands Dean’s glow stick to him, Dean fixes him with a stern look.
They have cuddled during the night and sometimes while Dean’s napped, but that has been about it. Now, he watches Dean sleep beside him and observes the bags under his eyes and the way his thick fingers look, loosely gripping the comforter beneath him.
Dean slumps further against the counter, huddles into his hoodie and licks sugary coffee residue off of his lips.
Dean completely ignores Castiel whining and snapping at him, steadfast in his determination to nurse him back to health. He changes the sheets when Castiel complains about them feeling tacky and runs him a bath when his back starts hurting again. In between caring for him and doing chores, Dean naps on the bed beside him with the TV playing in the background.
Dean nods and forces himself to blink open his eyes. Sam gives him a smile but his expression stays concerned. He moves to clap Dean on the back, then aborts the movement, probably remembering how Dean sometimes doesn't like to be touched right after these particular nightmares. Sam of all people must understand the terror of having control over your body taken away, of being stuffed down and forced to watch, voiceless and helpless. Dean doesn’t think he will ever be able to fully forgive himself for failing to protect Sam from that.
Maybe he can put some aside for Sammy to give to Eileen the next time they see each other in person, which Dean hopes will be soon. They’re cute together, so sue him. Besides, who wants flowers when they can have cookies, right?
, and turns halfway around to Cas, “You c-c-comin' with?” He doesn't bother hiding the hope in his voice.
A frown forms on Dean's face. "Sentim-m-mental?" he repeats. His expression is guarded but some fear bleeds through.
Their trip to the zoo is coming to an end, but Castiel thinks it was quite successful. It was a joy especially to watch Jack be so carefree and so excited about everything. They’ve taken a lot of photos today, and Castiel is looking forward to selecting some for the family album they’ve started. He knows it means a lot to Dean as well, to have physical proof of the happiness they have found at last.
Shifting on the bed, Dean takes a moment to marshal his thoughts, sort through his feelings. Let down the protective walls. There’s a loose thread in the comforter and he starts fiddling with it with his free hand while he talks.
Dean’s expression morphs into a pout and then turns into genuine upset. “Dun w-w-wanna. ‘S all da-da-dark. L-l-like with… l-l-like M-M-Michael.”
The food doesn't taste as much of molecules as it should, and Castiel refuses to think about what that implies.
The bunker is much livelier again but there’s also more boundaries—the living quarters and the kitchen are off limits. Everyone who comes in is allowed access to the war room, the library, and the infirmary. Dean had expected it to still irritate him—he’s protective and maybe a little bit territorial when it comes to his home—but hunters rarely get homes, and it does feel good to help shelter people. And even though Dean keeps himself to the sidelines and leaves the leading and organizing to Sam and Eileen, he’s still kept nicely busy—there’s always someone who shows up injured, or hungry, or in need of advice with a case.
After lunch the next day, Castiel is finally allowed to do some work again. There's research to be done for one of the hunters in Sam's network and Castiel relishes having something to do, even if he has to do it while tucked into bed.
. After repeating that mantra a couple times, he can breathe easier. Tension leaves him that he wasn’t even aware he was holding.
What happens next happens so fast Dean has no chance to dodge—Jack gets up from the table and then he’s hugging Dean.
Now, Dean sits back down beside Cas inside their shelter. Cas is reading a National Geographic article about one of those bizarro deep sea monsters—”Black sea devils are fascinating creatures, Dean”—so Dean helps himself to a beer and then watches the waves. There are some tiny, fluffy white clouds far away at the horizon. Other than that, the sky seems to flow directly into the ocean, they’re both so blue and calm. The waves are tiny and crowned with seafoam, and make such a soothing sound when they meet the sand of the shore.
They relocate to the kitchen. Surveying their options, Dean gets the rest of last week’s tomato soup out of the freezer and makes some grilled cheese to go along with it. It’s not exactly a lot of work, but Jack wants to help anyway. They stand shoulder to shoulder at the stove, and then sit down at the table to enjoy their spoils.
He’s half asleep when Cas tucks him in and actually lies down with him, letting Dean curl into his side. “I love you,” he says, and then chuckles when Dean tries to say it back and it comes out as more gibberish than actual words. “Sleep,” Dean hears him say, so he does just that.
Reaching for him, Cas stops him with a touch to his elbow. Their eyes meet. Cas is looking up at him from where he’s sitting at the table, but it’s Dean who feels small.
It's so nice that Dean must fall asleep at some point, because the next thing he's vaguely aware of is being lifted bridal style into someone's arms. And then his head is resting against Cas's chest, and Dean should really
Except then Cas would move his arm away. Dean would have to leave the warm, safe shelter of his body. Well, he would have to do that eventually anyway, but—maybe just another moment.
Dean didn't know what to say to that, especially since he could feel the way his cheeks and ears were flushing. Cas didn't seem to notice, busy studying the empty spot Dean had pointed the two recliners towards. "Is something missing from there?"
A while ago, Dean had started complaining about Castiel's clothes not being comfortable enough for cuddling and had not stopped until Castiel gave in. Now, he owns two pairs of hoodies and sweatpants and a couple of soft t-shirts, and has to admit that they are nice to lounge in.
After arranging the presents next to the cake, Castiel carefully lights the three candles on it. He hopes they got everything right, as he doesn't have much experience with birthdays. They'd celebrated Sam’s and Dean's this year, but Dean had been adamant that they wouldn't make too much of a fuss about his, uncomfortable with being the center of attention.
Maybe tomorrow, they can carve out some one-on-one time for themselves. Go for a drive, take a bath together. A day of very little talking, and a lot of touch.
Castiel had hoped that Dean would fall asleep either while they cuddled or later during the movie, but it’s past two in the morning and Dean is still awake. Dinner had been spaghetti and meatballs, with Castiel stealing the occasional bite from Dean’s plate. He couldn’t be faulted for it really—Dean makes a mean tomato sauce. And it is always far more fun sneaking bits from Dean than having his own plate.
For a second, it looks like Cas is going to answer him, but then a distraught look passes over his face and he turns his head away.
He kind of wants to scrap dinner. Jack and Sam are big boys, they know what to do with a frozen pizza.
Castiel wants to say yes, but he also doesn't want Dean to stay here alone. But then Eileen solves the problem for him, announcing, "You go ahead, I'll help with cleanup."
Cas is looking out the window at the stars again, and something in his expression activates Dean’s instinct to calm and soothe.
Dean frowns. “Well, ask 'er. She could-d-d join us.” He shovels more stew into his mouth. Man, that stuff is good. Next time he’s making Cas read him the menu before ordering.
He must have closed his eyes at some point, and when he open them again, Cas is still close.  Dean’s hands must have decided to move without asking him first, because they’re buried in Cas's navy suit jacket, holding tight.
Of course, Dean isn’t done teasing him. “Think we can find a mermaid while we’re at it? Been a while since I’ve had a hot threesome. Mmm.”
For a beat it looks like Cas is going to fight him, but then he deflates. Dean goes back to shoving chili fries into his mouth. When he looks out to the parking lot in search of the kid, he finds him leaning against Baby's side, head bowed.
“That was so much fun!” he says, brushing sand off his legs. Cas looks like he’s about to combust with pride, but Dean is distracted by just how much sand is on the kid.
“There,” Cas says, “I’ll bend it back when we’re done.” He strides through the opening and Dean follows, sending the others a smug look that earns him an exasperated eye-roll from Sam.
Castiel does trust Sam, so he takes the plushie with him to the register. After paying, Sam offers to hide it in his backpack, so Castiel can give it to Dean in private later.
If Cas was wondering what took him so long, he doesn’t show it. He’s got his legs stretched out, ankles crossed, and is once again watching the stars. Over half their bed is bathed in moonlight, and maybe it’s how soft that’s making everything look, or maybe it’s the quiet of the night or the privacy of their room, but something makes Dean brave enough to get on the bed and climb into Cas's lap and press kisses into his mouth.
Dean nods, despite how his face still feels too warm and the fact that he is, without a doubt, a clingy idiot. “What?” He tries to sound like he’s completely cool, but instead his voice comes out more like a squeak. “Me? Sure. C’mon, l-l-let’s get g-g-goin’.”
Cas's voice is raw with emotion, and Dean fists his hands into the back of his shirt. It’s not the first time Cas has told Dean this, but it still strikes Dean to his core, leaves him light-headed and wobbly-lipped and vulnerable.
Across from them, Sam and Eileen are openly holding hands on the table. Sometimes they let go to take a drink or to sign something that requires both hands, but then they always go right back to it.
“One t-t-time w-when Sam w-was l-l-like ten,” he starts. “He got inv-v-vited to this b-b-birthd-d-day p-party. W-we were a-a-al-l-lways th-the outs-s-siders in school s-so that d-d-didn’t h-h-happen a l-l-lot. Dad wasn’t th-th-there, so I brought h-him over to the h-h-house. I w-was just g-g-gonna drop him off a-a-and then c-c-come back l-l-later, b-but the parents asked if I w-w-wanted to stay t-too.” Dean pauses and rubs at his jaw in irritation.
It takes a while for him to become more coherent and realize he’s in the hospital. Most of his stay there is a blur, and he spends a lot of it sleeping. There was still some fluid in his lungs when he was admitted, and they had to get that out, and warm him up. He hit his arms and legs on the inside of the pool as he seized in the water, and while nothing’s broken he’s got some spectacular bruises.
"Dude," Sam says with a laugh when Castiel finds them in the Dean Cave playing Zelda, "you're like, glowing. You look drugged. You sure there wasn't a little something extra in your coffee?"
Confused, Castiel picks up the plushie that Dean seems to have been looking at. It's a koala wearing a hanky. The expression on its face is kind of funny but friendly and its fake fur is very soft.
Castiel takes that to mean it's a mix of both. He shifts his hand out from under Dean's so he can hold it in turn, giving it a reassuring squeeze.
“Just wanna make sure,” Dean says at length. He sounds sincere but also a little evasive. “You’d tell me if you weren’t, right?”
Eileen, Dean, and Jack go to play Uno in the library after dinner, while Sam and Castiel take care of the dishes.
As it is, Castiel is debating how to give Dean the out he seems to think he needs, when Dean abruptly gets up and stutters out something vague at no one in particular about checking that the kids aren't trashing his Cave.
When he’s wiped the water out of his eyes and is squinting against the sun, his hair sticking to his head uncomfortably, he sees Dean looking at him with amusement.
“Dean, it’s not your fault what he did. No one blames you.” Cas has told him this before. The others have too. “I promise you he’s gone,” Cas adds when Dean doesn’t say anything. “He’s gone and he can’t hurt anyone ever again.”
Castiel does. When Jack is busy with the next cookie, Castiel meets Dean’s eyes over his head and mouths a
Dean has relaxed his grip a little and now squeezes Cas's hand in a way he hopes translates as reassuring. Cas exhales a breath and is even smiling a little now. “Okay.”
Dean’s hands aren’t visibly shaking, but Castiel can still feel the way they tremble when Dean cups his face and steals a kiss while everyone else is busy with clean-up. There’s still a glaze over his eyes and dark shadows under them.
The moment they're back in their rooms, Dean peels out of his jeans and flannel and changes into sweats and a soft tee. Then he collapses on top of his bed with a groan. He drifts somewhere close to sleep while Sam putters around their room, doing fuck knows what. Dean would ask, but he's tired and not in the mood to get his head bitten off. Still, he cracks open an eye and makes a valid effort at kicking his brain into gear when Sam sits down on his bed across from Dean and says, in a really weird tone, “So uh, Eileen wants to help with the case. She should be in San Diego by the time we're there.”
“We're staying at the Kings Inn. It has a pool, and a hot tub. The reviews said the rooms are very clean and the beds comfortable. There's a Mexican restaurant and a diner called Waffle Spot on site.”
Dean smiles at him fondly, but it slips when he winces again. He blinks rapidly and then his gaze wanders aimlessly for a moment until it comes back to Castiel. His eyes are out of focus and he frowns, his grip on Castiel’s hand weakening.
Finally, Dean's voice decided to do its job again. "Haven't found a big enough TV yet. But once I do? It's gonna be epic." Sensing an opening, he added, "But you know what? Until then, we can put my TV in here. C'mon."
The expression on Dean's face changes from suspicious to mischievous. His eyes light up and a slow smile spreads on his face. "You d-did?" He asks, his voice soft and a little awed, like he's genuinely touched Castiel did something morally questionable for him.
He gets ready for bed, though he fully intends to wait up for Cas. Leaving the door ajar and the lamp on the bedside table on, he lies down and waits.
Dean kind of really wants another hug, but he's unsure if Cas wants that too. Cas may be his best friend, and Dean’s known him for years, but sometimes Cas can still be an enigma. Does he like it when Dean touches him or is it just something he's gotten used to? Does he long for Dean as much as Dean longs for him, even when they're in the same goddamn room?
The room is dark except for the bedside lamp Sam must have switched on when he woke up to Dean screaming. Well, Dean guesses he screamed, judging from the way his throat feels. Apparently it sounds even more disturbing with how his words shatter under distress now, so Dean is glad he rarely ever remembers that part.
“Can we go to SeaWorld while we're there?” There’s the soft sound of pages turning, like Jack is reading one of his pamphlets.
His head is still bowed over his notepad and he can’t see it, but Jack’s earnest inquiries have made a soft smile appear on Molly’s face, the first genuine one Dean’s seen on her.
For lack of anything better to do, he climbs into the backseat of the Impala and makes himself comfortable with the blanket that's stashed there. He watches the woods through the window, trying to enjoy the quiet instead of letting it unsettle him after hours of near-constant noise.
in a way that despite everything Dean’s faced in his life has his heart pound and the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. Then it lunges, and Dean shoves his fear aside and stands his ground.
It's not much, but Castiel hopes that it's just the beginning. That Jack will be encouraged to take photos on his own, to decide for himself which moments he wants to capture.
They stay like that for a while. Finally, Cas says, “Dean, when I heard your prayer… I knew something must have gone terribly wrong for you to be saying goodbye, and I… I was so scared. I didn’t want you to be alone and in pain when it… when it finally happened. And even though I knew you’d go to heaven, I really—I’d really like for you to have many more happy years on Earth first. So I need you to try and be more careful with yourself, Dean.”
The next time Dean wakes is when the mattress dips beside him and there’s the sound of someone taking off a coat and shoes. It’s still dark in the room, and Dean is momentarily confused by that but all that really registers is that Cas is back. Dean immediately abandons his pillow nest in favor of curling himself around Cas where he sits, an arm around Cas's waist so that Cas knows not to even think about leaving the bed again.
Smiling to himself—Dean really is an angry sleeper—Castiel uses the opportunity to clean up and polish his find in the bathroom sink. When he’s done, he’s filled with a sense of accomplishment but also realizes he’s nervous. But why? It’s just a whimsical gift, nothing more. Surely there’s no reason for him to feel like it means something more.
“Where’s Dean?” He must notice that Castiel’s truck is gone also, and answers his own question. “Oh, I understand. He is angry with you because he’s worried.”
When Sam and Eileen return from their walk along the beach—hand in hand and sharing private smiles—they all start packing up and getting ready to leave. They’re planning on returning the next day and Castiel hopes that the ocean will be just as calm again.
Dean does. He’s soaking wet by the end, but his mind is calm and his hands are steady. And Baby’s clean and gleaming inside and out.
Castiel leans away and captures Dean's hand. He laces their fingers together and feels the minute trembling in Dean's. Even if he was using picks, it must have been difficult for him to play with his hands as unsteady as this.
Dean frowns, trying to get his brain into gear. He’s had some truly great orgasms where the aftershocks lasted a while, but being so out of it he didn’t even notice someone moving him and cleaning him up?
There’s five of them, and they were built up right next to the entry to the garage in that way no one arriving or leaving could miss them. Sam and Eileen, who had been driving ahead of Castiel and Mary, have already stopped the Impala and gotten out to investigate.
“Maybe I could be persuaded,” Cas says, a twinkle of mischief in his eyes, crows-feet deepening, a slow smile tugging at his mouth because he's caught on now to the game they're playing.
Swallowing, Dean nods. “‘Kay.” He looks up at Cas. “You g-g-gotta t-t-take y-your own adv-v-vice, though. ‘C-c-can’t save ev-v-veryone’, right? A-a-and Cas, you k-k-killed the damn th-thing. You st-t-topped it. A-a-and for the people h-here? That d-d-does m-m-make a d-d-difference.”
Dean grimaces. There's not even bodies left behind they could bury, helping them mourn. No one except them and Molly will ever even know what really happened to them.
"Thanks. It, um. Was real nice. All of it. Like, the bath too." He's blushing. Why is he blushing? "You're like—really good at this." He feels like a babbling idiot but somehow he must have gotten his point across because Cas is all but glowing with pride. Cas used to doubt himself so much, so it's extra good to see.
It’s a sensor that detects possible convulsive seizures and sends alerts to the phones it’s paired with. It provides GPS too, and it’s waterproof, and there’s an App that—”
"What're you gonna do? You wanna watch something?" Dean's about to offer Cas his laptop, but Cas shakes his head.
After, they curled up on the loveseat in the Cave to watch the movie. Drowsy from dinner, Dean watched it through half-lidded eyes, one hand absently playing with the buttons on Castiel’s shirt.
It doesn't. Really, Dean was having a great time enjoying the intimacy of him and Cas in their bed and being touched with such care. But then he fell asleep and missed out on some of it and when he woke up Cas wasn't touching him anymore and was all the way at the other side of the room.
Dean smiles at her and opens his arms wide for a hug that he then tries his best not to melt into too much. Eileen doesn’t seem to mind though. She squeezes him, and then Dean draws back.
strong but also soft in all the right places, and he could pick Dean up or hold him down no problem and—and
Still a little grumpy, Castiel holds himself back from pointing out what a stupid question that is. Sam has been nothing but supportive and patient, and doesn't deserve to be the target of Castiel's ire.
Sam must not be back yet, because Dean hears knocking and then the door being opened with the card, probably by Jack. And then Dean's being put down and tucked into bed, as much as Cas knows how to tuck someone in. Dean really wants a goodnight kiss, but before he can decide whether to blow his cover or not, Cas has already moved away.
“How about you?” Sam asks, like he has no idea about how that’s Dean’s least favorite topic. “How are things going? I’ve been so busy, I feel like we haven’t really talked in weeks.”
Dean can't hold eye contact for too long, because there's, well, the road he's got to pay attention to. But their little private moment has given him a stupid little flutter in his chest, and something that was wound tight in there relaxes a little.
The moment Baby jolts to a halt on the shoulder, Dean fumbles the door open on his side, leans out and pukes all over the gravel. Since his stomach is empty it's just water and bile, but the sharp, disgusting taste still makes him cough and splutter. Cas's hand is between his shoulder blades, rubbing gently, while he keeps Dean from tumbling out of the car with the other. Dean pants and dry heaves for another minute, but apparently he has nothing else to throw up. Someone presses a bottle of lukewarm water into his hand, and he uses it to rinse out his mouth. The nausea is still going strong, his head feels like it's splitting open, and he just wants to be unconscious,
Okay, so maybe Dean had been a little naive about Mrs. Butters. But she made him Rice Krispie treats! And gave him that kickass nightgown! Dean’s going to wear it every night from now on. It’s so… snuggly. And soft.
“Yeah, just, uh. Took me b-b-by surprise is all-l-l. I’m not,” he adjust his hands on the wheel, fumbles for the right words. “It d-d-doesn’t bother me. Not really. Just, uh. Didn’t expect him to s-s-say
Cas sighs, because not only is he a dumbass he's also super dramatic, but he does start rubbing Dean's back so Dean instantly forgives him. Jesus, it's nice. Cas's hands are warm but not sweaty, and also they're so freaking
? D-dude, Cas, th-this is a-a-a t-t-two w-w-way str-r-reet, man.” He motions between them. “Y-you c-c-can’t j-j-just d-d-d—”  His agitation makes him block, again, and he has to take a couple deep breaths to calm and center himself. Sometimes it’s downright painful when he can’t get the words out. Cas takes his hand again, squeezing it.
It’s not until they’re in their room that it really registers with Dean how tired he is. Lying down and passing out for a while suddenly holds a lot more appeal than it did five minutes ago, especially once he catches sight of the bed and remembers how comfy it’s proven to be.
It’s still early the next time Dean blinks awake, the sunlight filtering through the curtains hazy and soft. His head is still cushioned on Cas's chest, which hasn’t happened all that often before. Cas usually moves him during the night so he can watch Netflix or read a book while Dean snoozes. A lot of the time, he’s gone by morning.
He can blame Michael all he wants, but Dean’s the one who said Yes. He’s the one who was too weak-willed to push Michael out, the one that didn’t even notice he was still possessed and was being spied on.
Castiel holds up his arm and Dean tucks into his side, head resting on his shoulder. When he drapes the blanket back over them, the edges of it swish over the prairie roses that are blooming on the hilltop, scattering a few petals at their feet.
There isn’t much left to be done, so Castiel just finishes scrubbing the counter and puts a few more items away, and then makes to follow Dean. Both Jack and Maggie are immersed in their task and in conversation, and don’t notice when Castiel crouches down beside Mary to whisper, “I might need your help later.”
Dean thinks about it but then shakes his head. "We've done what I wanted to do already.  What you wanna do?"
Feeling his face flush, Dean grumbles to himself about how stupid they all are. Why did Jack have to go and imprint on Cas and take after his tendency to just say whatever the fuck he thinks with zero regard to how embarrassing it is.
But he also wants to keep on being his family’s shield. To protect them in ways only he can. To take away their pain with just a touch.
When Dean exits the bathroom, he's already in sleep clothes. When he sees the nondescript paperbag sitting on his side of the bed, he frowns.
“Do you mean,” Cas says at length, sounding utterly confused and dismayed, “that every time I’ve touched you like this… you had a panic attack after?”
"When we were at a diner a while ago during a case," he starts at length, "Jack asked to have chocolate cake for dessert. And I was going to say no, because he's not supposed to eat so many sweets. But then Dean wanted a piece too, and when they both look at me like that…"
Cas reaches out, but instead of putting his fingers to Dean's forehead, he curls them around the edge of Dean's jaw. Dean goes very, very still.
Dean shrugs with one shoulder, of half a mind to wave away the concern. It’s still a battle, sometimes, to let others take care of him and not give in to that part of him that screams it should only ever be the other way around.
"Uh, yeah. Th-thanks." Dean doesn't lift his head, doesn't meet Castiel's eyes, doesn't clap him on the back. He just turns and leaves. It’s only now that Castiel realizes Dean never demanded
There were two sets of hands on him then, stroking his back, and soothing words meant to calm him down, but the tears were still dripping down his chin, relentless sobs making him gasp for air.
Even if he knew what to say, Dean couldn’t talk now. That’s okay though. If he’s crying a little, that’s okay too. He just lets his hand be held, and holds Cas’s too, and falls asleep where he’s at home.
They’re only a few miles away from Lebanon when Dean remembers that Wal-Mart is at the next exit and decides he doesn’t want take-out for dinner. Besides, they’ve been away for a week so the fridge will need restocking anyway.
for a chance to dirty the bath water with me,” he points out, closing his eyes and leaning further into Cas’s touch.
Sam looks at him like he just proposed they should go river dancing. “Why? There's four of us, I think that's more than enough for this case.” He chuckles a little like Dean is being really silly, but it doesn’t sound sincere.
Castiel lies beside him, stroking his back until he’s sure that Dean’s deeply asleep. Then he pulls a blanket over the both of them and reaches over to this bedside table for a book.
“I didn't say there was anything wrong with it.” Sam throws his phone on the bed beside him and starts digging through his bag in a way that tells Dean he isn't looking for anything except a way to end the conversation he started himself.
Sam lifts his eyebrows like he didn't expect Dean to admit that so fast. “So you aren't,” he states, and Dean has to exert a lot of effort not to throw something at his brother's head because he's getting seriously pissed off.
Cas’s expression of concern melts into one of joy, his eyes shining with pride. “It’s almost finished. I actually think tonight is the last time we’ll have to go to heaven for now. It’s…” Cas trails off, seeming to try and find the right words.
"I don't like soup," he grouses even as he grudgingly starts eating it. Dean ignores that too, turning on the TV and refilling Castiel's water glass at the sink.
When he starts to sing, making sure his voice is as deep as he can go, Dean melts into him like he’s finally found the comfort he’s been seeking.
"I know we've talked about it before but not in a while, so I hope it's alright with you that I—dammit!"
“Dean, you’re shaking.” Cas tries to maneuver Dean to get a look at him but Dean only clings tighter, hiding his face in Cas’s shoulder like a stupid kid. If Cas looks at him then he will see
Cas strokes his back for another couple minutes, but then his hand slows a stop. Dean’s about to make his displeasure with that known when Cas says, “I wish it could always be like this. I
But he and Cas aren’t married. Okay, maybe a little bit. But not officially. That’d be dumb anyway. What would they need to get officially married for? And what does is matter anyway what anyone calls them? It’s dumb to fret about this. Dean’s being dumb, again, and he’s going to stop it, right now.
Dean doesn’t see how that’s necessary but he pushes himself up and blearily looks around for the food.
Dean wants to ask Cas's opinion on why the kid wants to go with Dean instead of him or Sam, but his stomach chooses that moment to grumble its displeasure at him.
Castiel puts an arm around him and strokes up and down his side. “You’re very affectionate today,” he observes, though really Dean is generally quite cuddly when they’re in private. And often when they’re not in private too, like when they’re all watching a movie together in the Cave.
rips the thing off of Dean. Rolling onto his side, Dean starts coughing as breath rushes back into his lungs. He struggles to get his legs under him and then Sam is there, hauling him to his feet.
“I’ll see to him.” Cas meets Dean’s eyes, checking if Dean’s good for now, then gets off the ground.
Startled from his reverie, Dean looks up at Cas where he’s suddenly appeared at his side, then motions at the enclosure in front of him. “Just wanted to watch a little longer.”
Dean has taken a step towards him before he’s even realized what he’s doing. What the fuck, he can’t go to Cas right now. Dean looks like a mess. Like a crybaby who lost it over a sandwich.
“I won’t look,” Cas says, like he’s sensing Dean’s embarrassment. He keeps him steady, and then Dean’s sinking into the hot water with a groan of contentment, letting his head rest against the edge of the tub, closing his eyes. It’s not a bubble bath, but the water smells faintly and soothingly like sandalwood and something citrus-y. Cas lets him soak for a while, rummaging around in their room. When he comes back, he takes Dean’s toiletry kit off the shelf, and Dean makes grabby hands for his shampoo bottle.
“Well,” Cas explains as he effortlessly pushes the wheelchair up the ramp that leads to the capybara enclosure. His grace may not be what it once was anymore, but he’s still crazy strong. “They’re very social, and they adopt and care for any babies they’re given, no matter their species. Also, they greatly enjoy belly rubs and foot massages—”
Cas huffs a breath of laughter and strokes a hand down Dean’s spine. "You also hate it when I wake you up when that happens." He must feel Dean grimace because he adds, "I don't mind, Dean. I know you're an angry sleeper. And I told you it makes me happy when you ask for things you want."
Checking his watch, Sam says, “Almost time. I better get back.” Then he turns and makes his way through the snow back down the hill, where Jack and Eileen and the fireworks are waiting.
There’s drool under Dean’s cheek again but he doesn’t move, only closes his eyes again. Maybe that way, the moment won’t end. His brain isn’t really awake yet and it just feels so good being close to Cas and getting to be held like this.
It’s hard, but Dean manages. A part of him still expects to get yelled at or punched in the face when he leaves himself wide open and vulnerable like this.
Holding up his hands, Sam has the gall to smile. “Got it”, he says, sounding entirely too unconcerned. “No dying.”
“There’s no need to feel ashamed, Dean. Obviously you associate marriage with love, romance, and permanence, all of which you have been deprived of and consequently long for, so it only makes sense that—”
From one moment to the next, Castiel’s drained and exhausted husband is bouncing in his seat and flapping his hands in an expression of pure joy. Dean breaks a piece off the pie with two fingers, sticks them in his mouth, and moans.
His mood ever changing, Dean nudges Castiel’s shoulder with his, smirking. “You wanna get me shirtless, Cas?”
There's that prickle under his skin as Cas uses Grace to check Dean's system for viruses or whatever. All Dean can focus on is how warm Cas's fingers are and how one of them is pressing lightly against that sensitive spot behind Dean's ear.
Sam snorts and shakes his head at them with a smile. Eileen gives Castiel a thumbs up. Jack, who is either genuinely not understanding the innuendo or, more likely, pretending not to, starts telling them about the dream he had last night. (It involved racoons that were thieves but somehow also jedi knights at the same time. “Told ya n-n-not to watch Sam’s weird ne-ne-nerd movies with the, what w-w-was it? Freakin’ t-t-time-travelling ferrets.”)
to hug again, but enough is enough, he can’t keep demanding Cas giving him these things. His throat’s so tight he can’t even say thank you.
much. Apparently he’s not done crying about this crap though, so it comes out as a sob instead. But he’s safe here, Cas is holding him, and maybe it’s okay to be a little fucked up about all of this and need to cry it out.
They’ve been trying, on and off, to help Dean be at least able to read and write his own name again, but they haven’t had much success. It mostly results in frustration and headaches on Dean’s part, and him storming off at some point to hide his pain from them. It’s a stark contrast to how he acts about his stutter, which rarely seems to distress or concern him.
coming, rising up in all its ugliness. He wants it gone. It’s so shameful and disgusting, why can’t it just go away?
Taking Dean’s hand in his, Castiel reassures him, “We’ll put some water inside the shell for them. And then when they do dry, we’ll press them and put them inside our photo album for safe keeping.” Dean nods mutely, cheeks still flushed, and Castiel feels warmth spread through his core. Every time he realizes again that he’s in love with Dean, it’s this same indescribable feeling, like the sun shining on his face for the first time all over again. Like understanding that he has finally found a home.
Jack is watching the waves when Dean gets back. After plopping down next to him, Dean unceremoniously puts the cap on the kid’s head and holds his juice out to him.
It’s not exactly a super flattering picture, though he guesses without the context someone might look at it and think he just looks sleepy and soft.
Feeling dead tired yet too wired to sleep, Dean wanders around until his feet carry him down to the swimming pool.
The next day is about the same. He’s still stuck in bed and that irritates him to no end. The food is less of a problem at first, because Dean has cooked it and it tastes good and Castiel has missed actually tasting things. But as his grace recovers, things start to taste like molecules again, so in the end the food irritates him as well.
Ever since Dean herded Cas and Jack into the library and had them put their names down on the table— (“But Dean, that’s for your family.” - “Yeah, exactly.”)—something seems to have settled between him and Jack. He no longer looks at Dean as if desperate for something he can’t give a name to. Instead—
Dean still prefers to keep himself to the background when the hunters from the apocalypse world are concerned, though Castiel isn’t quite sure why. Dean seems careful not to accidentally undermine Sam's authority where they are concerned. It also wouldn’t surprise Castiel if the trauma of watching Sam die in the apocalypse world still strongly affected Dean.
“You’re fixing it,” Dean says. “The thing th-that’s been ups-s-setting me? That I, um, need-d-d? You’re fixing it alread-d-dy.” He nods to their hands.
He walks over to Dean, who's still bent over and apparently busy decorating his own cookies. Dean's giggling to himself and the mirth in his expression makes him look about two decades younger. When Castiel gets close enough to make out the shape of the cookies, he realizes why.
Realizing that he’s run out of excuses, and that Dean has a point in saying they’re alone right now, Castiel finally gives in.
“This is a very pretty Sword,” Michael said with their voice. He ran one of their hands down their chest and watched in the mirror, enjoying the way Dean recoiled and almost sank back into the water. Their hand brushed against their genitals and Dean wanted to throw up but couldn't. With cold detachment, Michael inspected their penis while Dean fought and fought and only managed to inhale water.
The water pressure in the shower is the opposite of memorable, but Dean knew that already and it's enough to wash the sweat off his skin. It doesn't do much for the pain, but nothing really does. Which means Dean's in for a miserable six to twelve hours.
He decidedly did not like the way they both hesitated. “We’re not sure yet,” Sam finally said. “But… your eyes flashed blue.”
"Alright, big boy, sh-sh-show us w-w-what you got." He says with a wink and a leer. And then with a fond eye roll at Castiel's confused expression, "G-g-get naked, dummy."
; it never could be, and I promise you here and now that I will never deny you physical affection. I may need some guidance sometimes, but that doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy what we’re doing.”
Then suddenly everybody was there, and Sammy was smiling so wide despite the teartracks on his cheeks. And they all acted like Dean was a toddler who just did the first steps thing, meanwhile Dean was still a little confused about everything and just wanted to drink his hot chocolate in peace.
“Tease,” Dean mock-complains, and then there’s yelling, and they both look down the hill just in time to see the first fireworks go off. Castiel barely has time to admire the golden and red sparks raining down before he’s grabbed by the tie and Dean is pressing their mouths together.
Cas looks perplexed. “Oh”, he says. “Jack was awake early and I wanted to check on him. He didn't feel like going back to sleep so I stayed with him.” Cas squints at him. “This is what upset you,” he says, uncertainly but too flatly for it to be a question.
Instead of replying right away, Sam hands him a piece of paper. "Rowena came through. We're still trying to get the dosage right so he doesn't build up a tolerance too fast. It's dulling the pain and helping him sleep."
Cas offers his hand to him in invitation. Hesitantly, Dean reaches back. Cas takes Dean’s hand in both of his and just holds it.
Castiel examines the guilt for a moment, and then lets it go. It's in the past, he's tried to atone, and he was different then.
Dean studies Sam for a moment. That tension from earlier is back in his jaw and he keeps fiddling with his phone. So, nervous, but also...angry? What the hell?
Dean scowls and makes sure to enter the mine shaft before him. Not that it did much good the last time they entered a place like this.
There's only a handful of photos inside yet—a copy of the one photo Jack has of Kelly, and a few snapshots Castiel has taken more or less unnoticed by the others. Dean and Jack eating chocolate cake in that diner, Sam and Jack and Eileen playing a video game. A shaky selfie Jack and Castiel took in the backseat of the Impala.
Instantly, Dean’s heart had jumped into his throat and got stuck there, heavy and hot like a heated stone. Mutely, he’d managed a tiny nod.
Dean has to suppress a smile. Now that they all have more down-time, Cas and Sam have started home-schooling Jack so he learns something besides hunting. Jack is like a sponge for knowledge, so when something eludes him he easily gets worked up about it. It reminds Dean a lot of Sammy as a kid.
Warm, hitched breaths puff wetly against Dean’s chest. At his back, he can feel the kid’s fingers tremble.
“Yes! He wanted to get an early start! Oh, right, I’m supposed to give you these.” Jack reaches over and puts Baby keys down beside Dean’s plate.
Dean’s speaking slower on top of enunciating extra carefully, his breathing carefully measured so he doesn’t run out of breath towards the end of his sentences. It reigns in his stutter somewhat, and gives Eileen a chance to read his lips despite the remaining disfluency.
“Alright.” Cas's breathing has noticeably picked up and the way his voice has gotten even rougher and deeper makes Dean shiver. Hesitantly, Cas slides his hands up Dean’s sides under his tee, “May I undress you?”
They share a moment of companionable silence, and then Sam draws a breath like he's steeling himself and says, “Dean, listen... I'm sorry about earlier. I didn't—”
“I’m never w-w-walking ag-g-gain. Anyw-w-where. I g-g-got my b-best girl t-to g-g-get me places, right B-B-Baby?”
Sam seems unconvinced and he’s still holding Dean’s stupid bowl. Cas is looking at Dean with worry. “Are you nauseous?” He asks, already reaching to touch Dean’s head with two fingers. “I can—”
“It’s f-f-fine,” Dean blurts out. “It’s. Yeah.” He clears his throat and chances a look around. Jack looks earnest as always and like he doesn’t get what’s so embarrassing. Eileen is squinting at them, but then Jack signs something to her and the confusion clears from her face and is replaced by amusement. Okay, time to make a graceful exit.
Dean pouts. And then he rolls his eyes and shoos them out of his kitchen, "Alright, alright, got it! Raincheck on movie night."
This early, Cas's voice is rough, his hair's a mess even though he didn't even sleep, and he doesn't look up from his phone at all.
“Sa-a-am-m-me,” he gets out, shakily, knowing he’d block if he tried to say more. It feels lacking, but Cas doesn’t seem to think so. He squeezes Dean tighter for a moment and then they just hold each other, gently rocking from side to side. The stars are blurring in front of Dean’s eyes so he closes them, lets himself lean on Cas until finally, the others call for them, and they have to break apart and come back to the here and now.
He manages to sneak out of the kitchen with his coffee before anyone can stop him, and then he hides in his room to drink it like some total jackass. He's half convinced Sam is going to come knocking at his door any minute to call him a coward, but it doesn't happen.
Dean’s hope soars when Cas offers him a gentle smile, so it takes a moment for him to register what Cas is saying. “I should get back to my research.”
That’s crybaby Dean talking though. It’s high time for getting-shit-done Dean to take over. To roll up his sleeves, put on his big boy pants, and—well, get shit done.
Cas goes back to the library, leaving Dean standing there feeling kind of useless and a little stupid.
"Dean, none of us care about that,” Castiel says, decisively. “Christmas won't happen without you. It wouldn't be the Winchester style if it was traditional anyway. No arguments."
Rolling his eyes in annoyance at the teasing, Sam throws his clothes towards the other shelter and then takes off running after the others. “You’re getting old!” Dean yells after him.
Dean pushes himself up into a sitting position, blinking dazedly. “‘M awake,” he croaks. “You can come in.”
Molly seems a little taken aback by Jack’s, well, Jack-ness, but then she takes it in stride, shaking both their hands and inviting them to sit opposite her. She’s got a half empty coffee mug in front of her. When the waitress comes over, Dean orders a coke, and Jack does the same.
Jack hastily escapes to his room to hide his present while Castiel walks on to the library. Sam is there with a couple of his hunters, but it looks like they’ve already wrapped up their meeting and are just hanging out now.
“Dean’s right,” Jack says, to Castiel’s utter relief. “Besides, if you guys get yourself captured, you’ll need someone here to save you.”
"It's the molecules. They… get in the way of the flavor. Sometimes more, sometimes less." Cas does keep eating the cookie though. "You're a very good cook, Dean. Everyone is saying so."
Cas hums in reply, making a show of contemplating what to do about it. And rationally Dean knows it's all in good fun, that Cas doesn't mean anything by it, except maybe he really does not want to kiss Dean right now, or be kissed. And Dean would respect that, but he can't help sounding a little hurt when he leans away and gripes, “F-f-fine, you don't w-w-wanna, I g-g-g-get it—”
When they’re back inside the shelter, Dean is visibly exhausted and immediately lies down and curls up on his side. Castiel is glad to see it though—Dean has gotten a lot better at letting himself have the rest he needs. Letting himself have what he needs in general.
in Dean wants to shove Sam away and cling to him tighter. And Dean is so tired of it. He really hopes that Sammy is right and Cas really is still willing to listen. Where Dean wanted to hide himself before, he’s starting to become desperate to be seen.
Outside the bunker, there's the barest hint of light at the horizon. Morning dew is clinging to the grass, and a few birds are making noise already.
“Where should we go next?” Cas asks when they’re all done with their ice cream and with watching the capys munch and nap.
Jack looks at him like that’s the deepest shit he’s ever heard. Dean rolls his eyes and claps him on the back. “C’mon, g-g-git. But take your sh-sh-shoes off f-f-first.”
Back in their room, he guides Dean to sit back down on the bed. He grabs a plastic bucket that he places in easy reach and fills a glass with water to be put on the nightstand. He helps Dean out of his pants and flannel while Dean blinks against what are probably black spots obstructing his vision.
Giving him a moment to sort himself out, Castiel keeps a grounding hand on his shoulder and checks in on the others. Jack is still snorkeling but Sam and Eileen are swimming towards the shore.
She starts to answer, then must see something in his expression because she stops and then asks, “With—?”, and inclines her head towards where Dean had walked out. When Castiel nods, the happiness in her eyes dims a little, but she says, “Of course. Thank you for asking.” They share a smile of silent understanding.
“You don't need to apologize,” Cas is saying. He gently touches Dean's forehead, rubs his thumb over Dean's temple. There's a heat behind Dean's eyes and he kind of wants to cry. “Is it getting worse?” Cas asks, and Dean nods mutely, keeps his eyes closed.
He pitches forward and pinches the bridge of his nose, tears running down his hand and dropping down onto the sand.
As he makes his way down the stairs, he feels relieved to be back home. The bunker is familiar, and safe, and he has missed the rest of his family.
In his periphery, he can see Dean nod. They’re both barefoot already and in their swim trunks, so they only have to take their shirts off. Castiel takes care with his capybara pin, putting his shirt down in such a way that he can see it’s still attached to the breast pocket.
She shrugs. “But It’s okay, I mean… I still got a job to do, and that’s protecting my friends out there. That keeps me going.”
Usually with them, it’s the other way around; Dean complaining about an ache in his neck or shoulders or back, and then becoming putty the moment Castiel puts his hands on him. It’s not that Dean’s never done this for him, but Castiel usually doesn’t get backaches, so it’s more been a kind of foreplay for them.
Uncomfortable with the praise, Dean tries to laugh it off. “Hey, I’m no Will Hunting but math I can do ok.”
Dean lies awake for a while around 3 am. They don’t talk—not with words, anyway. But their hands do—holding onto each other, drawing patterns onto the other’s skin. Even after Dean has fallen back asleep, every time Castiel shifts position Dean follows him. Castiel draws the thin blanket up higher over Dean’s back and moves his hand under Dean’s to still Dean’s searching fingers.
As he lies there, the thought sneaks up on him again that he misses sleeping. On the other hand, being able to sleep means
Dean grabs his box of cookie cutters that's he's been hiding under one of the empty shopping bags, shoulders past Castiel, and stalks out. Tense silence follows his departure.
When Dean finally draws back, Castiel remembers that he has yet to give him his present. Twisting around, he picks up the paper bag that he’d sat down on the bed and then puts it in Dean's lap.
Cas hums and briefly stops playing Candy Crush to text the others who are driving in Eileen’s car behind them.
Judging by the point of view, Cas took it while sitting outside on the balcony. In the picture, Dean's lying on his belly on their motel room bed, spread out diagonally like a starfish with one hand almost trailing on the floor. He's naked but the blanket is mostly covering his back and his butt. Early morning light is giving the picture a soft hue, and it would be flattering if Dean's mouth wasn't open and the fabric under his cheek wasn't visibly darkened with drool.
Dean shakes his head. “Everyone.” His vision is swimming in tears when he looks at Cas, but suddenly he needs to see Cas seeing him. “Every time someone… and I don’t want it to stop, and at the same time I wanna punch them until they let go. I’m not safe to be around, Cas.” There it is, finally, the truth. “You saw it happen. There’s something in me that just—and it comes out, and I—and I can’t stop it. I can’t stop it.” Dean’s still crying but now he’s also breathing hard and shaking with an anger he can’t quite explain.
When they finally let go, they both wipe at their eyes and give each other shy smiles. Cas turns the sound on the movie back on. He hovers his hand over Dean’s, asks with his eyes for permission. Dean knows he’ll regret it later, but he turns his hand over in invitation, lets Cas lace their fingers together.
He takes Cas's hand off his chest and briefly squeezes it. With his other hand, he motions to where Cas's phone is lying on the table, blinking with notifications.
“C-c-can I touch y-you? W-w-wanna,” he presses another kiss against Cas's mouth. “Wanna m-m-make you feel g-g-good.”
With the holidays approaching, the entire hunter network is on high alert, determined to make sure no one's Christmas will be ruined by the supernatural. Castiel thinks it all would be so much easier if people stopped celebrating it altogether since it isn't Jesus Christ's actual birthday anyway.
He sits there for a while torn between being angry at and worried about Sam. His back starts to protest being upright in any way but Dean's feeling too lonely and upset to go to sleep right now. He takes his key card and his phone and pads across the hallway over to room 19, not even bothering to put on shoes, because fuck that noise.
Dean ends the message and chucks his phone to the side. Then he thinks better of it and shoves it into his pants pocket where he can’t see it anymore and have it remind him of his idiocy. The kid is coming back from the bathroom and Dean quickly drains his coke and throws a couple bills on the table. He gets up so quickly he almost stumbles, and Jack looks at him with a frown.
Cas's eyes, when Dean finally meets them, are shining with something like excitement, like he’s found something that he thinks will make Dean happy, and that’s enough of a reason for him to want this, too. If he’s offering this, is must mean that he doesn’t think Dean’s being needy or stupid for wanting it, and that quietens Dean’s fears, makes him brave enough to say: “I—y-yeah. Yes.” It comes out a little breathless, and only once the words are out of his mouth does he realize how that sounded, what those words mean.
“They are indeed very comfortable,” Cas is saying, hands signing along effortlessly. “I think the only reason Dean got up at all was because he was ‘starving’.” He even does the stupid air quotes.
Sitting up as well, Castiel starts stroking Dean’s back as a compromise. “Do you still want to swim when the others come back? It’s calm today but it might not be tomorrow.”
Another stroke, another, and then Dean’s mouth goes slack and he chokes on a moan as he comes in long, hard pulses that white the room out for a moment. He floats on the pleasure for what feels like a long time, soothed into relaxation by the strong arms holding him up, sheltering him.
The hide-behind whirls on Cas, growl turning threatening, head drawn back like a snake about to attack. Darkness seems to ripple as its fur stands on end and Dean doesn’t wait to see if Cas's blow lands. The others follow his lead and a beat later they’ve got the thing surrounded and then Dean doesn’t have time to think anymore, just to react instinctively.
Struck with sudden inspiration, Castiel puts his find into the pocket of his swim trunks instead of showing it to Dean right away.
Together, they carried Dean's TV over. And originally, Dean had wanted to wait until his Cave was finished before watching movies there, but—who the fuck knew how much longer Cas was going to stay before leaving and probably going MIA again? And if Dean let Cas go back to research, he might not have another opportunity to spend some one on one time with him.
Dean wheels himself to his room but once he's transferred onto the bed and laid down on his belly, he decides to become a shapeless blob again. It's not that warm in the room and he's taken his robe off again so he starts to shiver. But then Cas drapes the blanket over his legs and starts rubbing Dean's back with his big warm hands.
Instantly, Dean had felt like he’d been dunked in ice water, like his heart had been put inside a vice. “Michael’s still—? He—”
“She said she’s made her peace with her life, and I respect that. It just reminded me… sometimes I think about living without my Grace.”
For a little over a week after getting back, after being home again and alone in his body, Dean hadn’t been able to talk at all. Everything was overwhelming and exhausting, and he communicated in nods and headshakes when he was present enough to hear and understand what someone was asking him in the first place. A lot of those first few days back, he’d just drifted, losing track of hours and days, mind far away.
Dean’s falling asleep, Castiel can tell. Tenderly, he keeps loving on him—kissing his mouth and his cheeks and stroking his hair—until Dean’s breathing has deepened with sleep.
When he’d found Cas in the Garden—or inside the Occultum, or on Neptune; Dean still didn’t completely understand where they had been, just that it hadn’t been the Empty, even though that was where Cas had said he’d go. When he’d found Cas—when he’d run to him, had reached for him, when he’d told him “Me too, Cas. Always”. They’d held each other tightly, they’d smiled at each other through tears, but they hadn’t kissed.
“Not th-the sa-a-ame,” he grouses, getting out from behind the wheel and walking around Baby’s front. He decides to be brave and to fuck what anyone might think, and grabs Cas's hand to hold it. They’re married now, so that means their honeymoon has started. No one can blame him for being a little touchy-feely. Or a lot, even. For like, the rest of forever.
“Cas...” Dean stops him with a hand on his arm, and then ducks down so quickly Castiel doesn’t fully realize what’s happening before Dean’s kissing him. It’s more of a peck, over so quickly that Castiel has no chance to reciprocate. Dean also mostly misses his mouth, and he ducks away immediately after, walking out with his shoulders up at his very red ears.
Beside him, Cas rolls his eyes even while he signs to Eileen what Dean said. “You get blood and who knows what else all over your car every other day but now you draw the line at a little sand.”
is the last thing Dean's able to think. Cas probably won't even hear it but Dean can't help himself.
“And Jack, I just—I just want him to be able to be a child sometimes. But I don’t know how. I can’t seem to make it happen.”
“Everyone’s fine, it’s been pretty quiet,” Sam says with a shrug and a smile, a carefully neutral expression on his face.
Upon seeing Castiel’s dismayed expression, Dean starts to shake his head and then stops and winces. “Nope. N-n-no. Your t-t-turn.”
touching Dean. It's a good thing Dean's wearing a tee and is also seriously tired, because otherwise he might just sport a chubby from this, and that would be really awkward with the kid in the room.
“Well, I d-d-don’t l-l-like t-to b-b-be touched without perm-m-mission, b-but you h-h-have it, so.” He shrugs. Something in his tone must suggest there were times when someone did not stop when he said no, and Cas is looking at him like he wants to ask about it, but Dean shakes his head. Not now.
Cas looks at him calmly. “I’m the only one who doesn’t have to sleep. And if whatever we are dealing with attacks at night, this an excellent opportunity to take a look around, maybe find out what it is.”
Maggie and Jack are sitting at the kitchen table that is completely covered in baking sheets and star-shaped cookies that they are decorating with icing and sprinkles. Dean is standing at the counter and seems immersed in his own project that Castiel can't see because Dean has built a barrier of kitchen utensils around it.
Dean is still asleep, so Castiel gently strokes his back through the shirt he’d draped over him in lieu of a blanket until he stirs. Blinking in disorientation, Dean immediately starts frowning in displeasure at having been woken.
Then Sam mentioned that their Mom was worried because Dean wasn’t answering her text messages, and Dean plugged in his phone for the first time in forever, only to be faced with the fact that he had a dozen messages and couldn’t read any of them. He stared at the words that no longer made sense to him until his eyes watered, frozen in fear because if this was gone that meant more things could be gone and he just hadn’t noticed yet.
She smiles at him and winks, and Castiel feels the last vestiges of his frustration drain away, replaced by warmth.
“Sure, kiddo,” Dean says, gruffly, head ducked over his plate and shoveling pasta into his mouth. Jack beams.
Sam stood up then, “I’ll go grab his blanket. And some juice,” and Dean had wanted to choke on his shame. But the weight and warmth of a blanket on his shoulders had been the only thing able to calm him down lately, making him feel anchored in his body and covered and sheltered.
“Feels l-l-like...l-l-like you don’t want me as b-bad as I w-w-want y-y-you.” There’s a headache pounding in his temples like his body wants him to cry but he isn’t letting it. Blinking his eyes rapidly, he tries to smile, but it comes out wobbly. “It’s stupid-d-d, I know.”
He's all the way dressed again already when he realizes that his flannel doesn't match his tee. It shouldn't fucking matter. Ain't like he's trying to impress anyone, right?
To anyone else, Dean's tense shoulders and the way his jaw is set might translate as anger, but Castiel can see the way he's curling over his chest and the wet shine to his eyes for what it is.
Dean has swung a leg over Castiel’s thighs and stroked his warm, oil-slickened hands up Castiel’s sore back. It feels so good, Castiel can’t help the way his eyes close and his muscles relax.
The ground seems to shake as someone gets up and walks away. Dean can open his eyes now, but it takes another moment for them to focus. He’s lying in the recovery position and his head is pillowed on something soft. Eileen comes into view.
Completely oblivious to Dean’s predicament, Cas takes his shirt the rest of the way off and then starts rummaging through his bag with a frown. “Changing my shirt,” he answers, absently. “It still smells like vomit.”
He shoved Sam away and grabbed the syringe out of Cas’s hands, but he wasn’t fast enough. Before he could even get it anywhere near his neck, Sam had taken hold of his arms.
In the bunker, only a handful of hunters remain in the war room, talking and resting, or perusing the library. They ask how the hunt went, and inform them that Jack, Maggie, and Dean are in the kitchen.
Almost hesitantly, Dean takes the koala out and lets the bag fall down onto the carpet. He stares at it for a long moment, his mind seeming far away. When he comes out of it, he blinks his eyes and casts a worried glance at Castiel. Carefully, Dean sets the koala down on his bedside table, and then doesn’t seem to know what to do with his hands. When he opens his mouth, his throat clicks but no words come out.
“Alright.” Letting go of Dean’s hand, Castiel gently takes a hold of Dean’s shoulders and helps him sit up. Dean leans on him for a moment, eyes squeezed shut and panting against Castiel’s neck, swallowing every few seconds.
There's fingers carding through his hair. Dean's lying on something that's warm and a little bit wet. His head feels fuzzy and there's a dull ache behind his eyes.
Dean pouts, and, when that isn’t effective, does his best pleading expression. It takes some patience on his part, but finally, Cas sighs in defeat and hands his phone over.
Startled out of his day dream—stupid heat, making him drowsy—Dean nods his agreement. Cas lets go of his hand, which Dean is less a fan of, but then Jack asks if he can push Dean. Eileen and Sam walk hand in hand to one side of them, Cas on the other. Despite the warm weather, Cas is wearing his stupid coat, and he’s looking through a pamphlet one of the zookeepers gave them earlier with a frown of concentration, and Dean couldn’t be fonder of him.
Abruptly, the pain and the images stopped. Dean was wrenched out of the memories and came up panting and confused. It took a moment for his eyes to focus, for his body to remember that maybe his heart shouldn’t be beating this hard, that maybe he needed to breathe. His throat hurt. Had he been screaming?
“Best husb-b-band ever!” he exclaims while shrugging into his robe, oblivious to how his words make Castiel feel like he’s once again been handed the sun to keep as his.
like i said in the beginning, i almost didn't post this fic at all because it fought me so hard. so if you enjoyed it, it would mean a lot to me if you could leave me a comment and
Staring at them, something catches in Dean’s throat. He’s not even sure he knows what Cas is saying, but he can’t be worthy of it, instinctively shying away.
Cas has put Dean’s abalone shell and his koala plushy on the table there, for Dean to decide later where he wants to put them. The flowers Dean got him have been dried and pressed to be put in their photo album later—the private one.
The next day, Dean had awkwardly apologized for his freak-out, not quite knowing what to say or how to even explain himself. He figured that it was over anyway—they had gotten most of the grace out, so that should mean no more seizures or whatever, right? And anyway, with the state of Jack’s soul up in the air, they had bigger fish to fry.
Cas just smiles at him, like he knows what it means too. And Dean doesn’t know what’s on his face but it makes Cas lean forward and then they’re kissing so gently, it almost hurts in way that Dean never believed he’d get to ever experience.
Sam chuckles lightly. "Alright, okay." Then his voice gets more serious. "You understand that saying you're gonna wait and then leaving
came for the first time after they’d kicked Chuck’s butt with Amara’s help and released his godly ‘spark’ or whatever into the world, rendering the position of God obsolete. In the resulting relief, in the joy of having Cas back with them, Dean had let his guard down. His family was finally safe and happy and at peace. It just fucking figured that all the crap in Dean’s mind that he’d been keeping a tight lid on before chose that moment to crawl its way to the surface like some nightmarish deep sea creature.
Fuck yes. Their tub is much bigger than even the one in the accessible motel room and there’s nothing better to soothe his body on days like this than relaxing in hot water. Except—
It’s when he watches a small swarm of fish underneath them that he sees it, half-buried in the sand.
Castiel opens his mouth but then pauses, frowns. He wants to say that Dean being moody sometimes isn’t anything out of the ordinary, but then he thinks. Dean’s been quiet, by turns clingy and distant. He’s been keeping to himself during group activities, claiming to be tired. Which made sense because he hasn’t been sleeping well, but now that Castiel looks back on the last couple of days, it feels like he has been missing something.
Dean wants to say that after all she’s been through, she probably can’t trust someone she doesn’t even know with something that private, but Cas is already talking again.
They bicker their way through filling up the cart and standing in line. Whenever they need more than just bread or beer from the mini mart in Lebanon, Dean comes here, so he knows most of the cashiers by now.
When he draws back from the hug, Cas checks him over, stroking a gentle hand over a band aid covering a bruise on Dean's arm. Then he looks up and searches Dean's eyes.
Cas must get that this is one of those moments where Dean feels too emotionally vulnerable to answer. He puts a comforting hand on Dean’s back and steps slightly forward where he’s standing beside Dean’s wheelchair, shielding him from everyone’s view.
“I d-d-don’t mean full o-o-on ret-t-tirem-m-ment, b-but. L-l-look, I’m d-d-done su-su-sugarc-c-oatin’ th-this shit,” he gestures at himself. “I’m n-n-not a-a-at a hund-d-dred perc-c-cent anym-m-more. Like mayb-b-be not e-e-even at a sixt-t-ty. A-a-and I’m not going-g-g to b-be ag-g-gain. Ev-v-ver.” It hurts having to admit that, tears rising to his eyes and his throat threatening to close up. He has to swallow a couple times before continuing.
“Cas… you’ll be there too?” Dean’s so choked up he barely recognizes his own voice, but he doesn’t even care.
Castiel dims the light, sheds his trenchcoat and blazer and his shoes, and lies down with him. He tugs the comforter over their legs and then strokes a hand down Dean’s arm that’s hiding his face.
His irritation must show on his face, because Dean huffs out a breath of laughter and reaches up to playfully attempt to smoothe Castiel’s frown away.
Dean hasn’t seen Cas all day. He was gone when Dean woke up in the morning, left at some point during the night to give Dean the “space” he’d asked for.
It’s okay during the day—well no, it’s not okay. Sam will clap Dean on the back or shoulder, Jack will brush against his arm when they’re standing side by side at the stove. And what used to feel so normal—good even—will feel like too much to handle.
Sam must read the signs of Dean closing himself off in self-defense correctly, because he continues even more softly.
Dean walks him calmly through the steps and they solve the problem together and then Jack tries the next one on his own. They’ve solved five problems out of ten and Dean’s showing Jack a trick how to solve them faster when they’re interrupted by the kid’s stomach growling.
Dean manages to doze fitfully until Sam's alarm goes off at six in the morning. He winces at the shrill noise and Sam is quick to shut it off.
Dean shakes his head. He looks at his watch for good measure and hopes he sounds convincing when he says, “Think I’ll go get dinner started.”
Disentangling himself from Cas, Dean got his first good look at him. Cas’s eyes were shining wetly and he looked ruffled and adorable and proud. He shot Dean a shy but happy smile, and Dean found himself mirroring it.
Mock-offended, Dean scowls at him. “Th-that’s one of th-the o-o-only s-s-songs I c-c-can still s-s-sing a-a-at l-l-least the chorus of with-thout soundin’ st-t-tupid. L-l-let me h-have th-that.”
"He also—he made me realize why Jack's birthday coming up is causing you so much stress." Now, Dean tenses all down his body. Castiel strokes his back soothingly with his thumb where he's still resting his hand. "And Dean, if it's too hard, you don't have to be there. We'll understand. But Sam thinks it will be good for you to be there, and I agree. It's—"
Dean’s muscles complain and his knees crack when he gets up. “Gimme a sec.” He cleans his hands at the sink but some grime remains under his fingernails, black and distracting. Dean frowns at it and then rips his gaze away and tells himself to get a grip.
Something closes off behind Sam's eyes and it makes alarm bells ring in Dean's head. “We're just friends, Dean.” He still sounds calm, but there's an undercurrent to his tone that lets Dean know he needs to back off, now.
Dean narrows his eyes at him, but they’re drawing moisture even in the half-dark of the room and it makes him look more upset than suspicious.
“Cas isn’t mad at you.” When Dean makes a disbelieving face, Sam adds, “Well yeah, he is, but.” He pauses. “Dean, do you remember that you prayed?”
There was a pressure holding him in place and he couldn’t escape. A bright light flashed in front of his eyes and then split apart into rapidly moving images.
“Dean?” Castiel tries to keep the alarm out of his voice, leaning forward and gripping Dean’s fingers tightly.
“You know I’m just ribbing you, right?” Sam is saying, still amused but softer now, fonder. “It’s good to see you—you know, nest. Enjoy stuff again.”
“Th-this g-g-good?” Dean asks once Cas lets him up for air, hand still slowly pumping Cas's dick, thumb teasing under the head.
