“What?”
Dejectedly, Cas nodded. “The idea of someone else is… repugnant.”
he begs, fingers digging into the arms of the chair, but Cas still doesn’t let him bounce on his dick like he’s desperate to, just slides the hand not holding onto him up along his front, slow burning drag from just above the base of his cock—knuckles that graze against his shaft and Dean wants to cry—all the way up to pinch and roll his nipples.
If you liked my fic, think about leaving a kudos, if you really, really liked my fic comments are definitely appreciated and help keep me writing. ;)
“Dean,” Cas's voice is pleading and sandpaper rough. His vocabulary when they do it this way always winds up limited to Dean, and yes, and wordless vocalizations.
Possessively, Cas deepened the kiss with sensual slides of his tongue into Dean’s mouth. Silky curls of their tongues, and then Dean was in his lap, grinding his hips down and forward. Hard where he was pressed up against Cas’s belly. A greedy burst of lust rocked Cas to his core at the proof of his effect on Dean. As if the smell of Dean’s arousal, the slick he’d already begun to leak, wasn’t intense enough. Cas's palms swept over Dean's back, he needed to touch as much of him as he could.
Dean straightened up and winked over his shoulder, lips tugging into a lopsided smile.
want you has never existed.”
Dean’s breath caught in his chest and stuttered out. He’d thought of it so much. So many different ways. But what he really wanted… “I… there’s this scene I couldn’t get out of my head. Where…” Dean’s face burned. “D’you really want me to say it? What if it’s too weird for the first time?”
Once he'd managed to make it into bed, he pulled up Dean's link and hit play on the first track: Ramble On. Eyes closed, he listened through song after song in the dark and gave each one his full attention. Somewhere between In The Light and Ten Years Gone, Cas decided Dean likely had a somewhat repressed romantic side. Gallows Pole and When The Levee Breaks made his chest ache a little. Eventually, he fell into a fitful sleep, still listening to Dean's songs.
Right. Yeah. Dean could… he knew how to get where he wanted to go from here. Cas’s gaze was heavy and hot as Dean rose and sauntered toward him. Biting his lip, Dean sank down to his knees between Cas’s parted thighs, running his hands up them, a firm caress that made Cas’s breath hitch. “Like this?”
“Dean,” there are so, so, so many things he wants to say to Dean, but he forces himself to pull back. “We need to let Sam and Jack know that we're both okay.”
he thought.
“The stuff you’re looking for’s probably in the back,” she informed him.
“Sam!” Dean exclaimed, voice hard, cutting him off. “I'll explain later, okay? I need to secure the shadowlight in the guard tower. I gotta do my job first.”
But hey, there was always the chance that Dean was among the very, very rare fae who didn't get matched… yeah right. Like Dean's luck had ever been
The tub was easily Dean's favorite part of the entire house. After months at a time spent grimy and disgusting during the war when resources were scarce and rest was a luxury, Dean loved the guarantee of a warm bath each day.
Dryly, Cas swallowed and offered him a half-smile that was way more confident than he felt. “Charlie wants to meet you. She said she wants to sit with us for a little bit at lunch tomorrow. We've been best friends since—”
Getting their clothes off is awkward and more than once someone gets elbowed or almost knocked over. By the time they're naked, Dean's breathless and so turned on that he's bursting with the need to make Cas feel good.
It took Cas longer to undress, Dean's eyes had adjusted to the dark and he could just make out his outline, hear the sound of fabric rustling.
“Use your words, baby,” Cas demands, reaching the edge of the bed. He crawls up onto the mattress between Dean's legs and runs his hands from Dean's ankles all the way up his thighs until he's thumbing the cut of his hips.
Dean crossed his own arms. “Look, I don’t really need you to believe me. I just need you to come up with something to trap a shadowlight. Can you do that?”
Dean seized up, his heartbeat thundering loud and fast in his ears. “Cas, ah,
to have a goddamn clue. Heat creeps up under his clenched jaw, his blood pressure climbs. To say that Castiel frustrates him is an understatement. A massive, massive understatement. Stupid blue-eyed, perfect-bodied, gorgeous, son of a bitch.
kingdom.”
His brows were drawn together in contemplation and he seemed conflicted. Dean wanted to ask what he was thinking about, but it wasn’t really his business. Dad and Bobby had been friends for a long time. They’d had a falling out years before Dean and Sam had taken off, for all Dean knew, though, they’d mended fences in the time he’d been gone. After a couple minutes, Bobby’s lips pressed into a firm line and he squared up his shoulders like he’d made a decision. He turned and Dean looked away, didn’t wanna get caught prying.
“Shit!” The teenager running toward him yelled, but he didn't stop. “You're not Dean! Oh fuck. Run!”
Cas is looking through him, not at him, and Dean’s temperature shoots up, his pulse along with it. “Be patient, boy,” his voice is unaffected, stern, and Dean wriggles a little in his lap with it. “Sit
“Yes, Dean … mmm …  ah,
That he could answer—he wasn’t an idiot. “Books. And stuff.”
At lunch though, Dean was definitely getting used to his presence. He'd stopped flinching every time Cas sat down at his table and he’d evolved from mainly one word answers to longer sentences. Sometimes whole paragraphs if Cas got him on the right subjects, like his car, Vonnegut, pie and it's clear superiority to cake. Cas's lips twitched up.
“Yeah. She collects people against their will and makes them her friends. It's sort of her thing,” Cas told him, only half-joking.
“You've practically had me in the palm of your hand from the moment we met. You
“You got anywhere you're planning on stayin’ while you're in town?” Cas raised an eyebrow, wordlessly communicating
“It passes the time, I suppose.” Balthazar answered. One of Cas’s eyebrows rose. “Not all of us are lucky enough to meet our soulmate in school. Some of us might never find them.”
see him as one. Perhaps Dean’s own insecurities got in the way as well, and if that’s the case, then Castiel will do everything he can to erase those insecurities.
Time to start putting you guys back together. <3
Sam let out a mock offended gasp, “He was
“I’m not—” Dean tilted his head a little, what was he gonna say, I’m not a dork? That was probably offensive or something. He wasn’t a total asshole. So he changed tack, “Actually, I’m looking for someone.”
It’s just sex. What could go wrong?
“There's a sample pack of lube in my jeans,” Cas replies.
he's being played. Adding insult to injury, Cas lets out this tiny whimper of a sound as he relaxes into the bed. “Mmm. Okay, I'll get up.”
The door's locking mechanism takes a moment to disengage and then he swings the door wide, eyes narrowed right down to slits. He gets one beat of time to feel a mix of scorn, hatred and fear when he sees Michael standing there in Dean's perfect body with the sunlight brightening his hair and eyes and bringing into sharp focus every freckle that Cas loves.
In his chest, Dean’s heart flipped over. He’d hidden himself in a place no one would think to look for him and Cas had found him anyway. How the hell did he
“Yeah, okay.”
Another crack, a flash of searing pain radiating outwards. Another, another, another. He was lost in the sensation of it, tears stinging at the corners of his eyes and throat scratchy from moaning.
that?” Jo asked, sounding a little rattled.
Dean's head tilted curiously. “Why?”
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean murmurs, “just like that, baby.”
Recklessly, Cas’s heart skipped, then sped up. A pleased glow that started off in his chest suffused his body. He didn’t understand how such a simple thing could evoke such an intense reaction in him, but it did. After he cleared his throat, he managed to get the smile on his face under some control.
Dean hesitated, and Cas’s heart sank like a lead weight. He forced his emotions back to normal fast enough that he hoped Dean didn’t catch the quick flash of hurt in his scent.
Dean smirked back and him and under his breath he mumbled, “Yeah, I'll bet you do.”
A minute later Dean walked up to him, brow furrowed, clearly confused about Cas's presence at his locker. He hadn't done this before, so Cas didn't blame him. He was gorgeous though, green eyes curious and lips pushed out in concentration like he was trying to figure out what was going on before he got there.
Let alone when you brought Cas’s perpetual five o’clock shadow and pink lips and intense blue eyes into the mix. Also. His muscular biceps, because yeah … they were out full force, straining against the sleeves of his shirt. There wasn’t really a way for Dean to recover gracefully from his staring. He blinked and noticed that Cas seemed just as struck silent as him.
“Right, sorry,” Dean chuckles and tells himself he doesn’t sound strained. Just focus on work, Dean. Just make it through this conversation. “Mr. Adler said he was sending you in. Why don’t you pull up a chair and we’ll get started.”
When he was close enough, Dean leapt into action, tossing the looped end of the rope over the shadowlight’s head and yanking it tight around its neck. A terrifying sound rumbled from its chest, a cross between a bellow and a growl that would never come from a horse-like creature of any kind. It reared up as the rope began to glow golden orange and Dean held tight.
Impatient, Dean tapped the toe of his boot on Sam's clean wooden floor, Baby pacing restlessly in front of him. “Why d’you look so shocked, Sammy? I mean, you pretty much guessed as much back there.”
And God, Dean feels him inhale, and then he lets out a soft little sigh. Dean's dick twitches, he’s so damn desperate, wanting Cas's mouth, wanting
“I’m not exactly what they call a ‘people person’.”
doing anything wrong?
“I'm—Cas, I …
“So pretty like this, Dean. Take it so good, don't you? You just can't get enough.”
His nose wrinkled, and his fists balled up at his sides. What the hell was a shadowlight doing in this realm?
The perfect curl of his fingers shuddered a shock of pleasure up Dean’s spine. “Holy fuck,” Dean gasped, eyes slamming tightly shut with how good it was.
The slow steady beat and familiar vocals soothed his jagged edges until Dean pulled into a parking space at school. He let the end of the song play out before he finally cut the engine and sighed into the quiet. He glanced at himself in the rearview and his mouth twisted with self-disgust. Green eyes stared accusingly at him, and then he looked away.
He trails his fingers over Cas's slippery rim, forcing a gasp from Cas's lips, and he's just gotta feel. Two of his fingers twist in easy, and Cas moans, arching into the press of them.  He's so damn hot inside that Dean's cock bobs. “You're always so tight for me, Cas. So fucking good.”
Sam mumbled under his breath and wandered off, probably to look for more books or something equally boring. Now that he knew Sam was safe, Dean was
*****
That sharp, darkly stubbled jaw, high cheekbones and those blue, blue eyes. Shoulders broad in a faded grey t-shirt that was snugly fitted, and once he’d helped Dean get to his feet on the floor, only a couple inches shorter than him. They still hadn’t said anything. Cas was looking at him with an intense scrutiny that Dean should’ve found uncomfortable, but instead he was looking at Cas exactly the same.
“Cas, you
The one thing Dean’s not willing to do is knock off the scent blockers at work, because that’d be all kinds of wrong. Castiel’s made his position on Dean clear and Dean’s not gonna try and alter it with biology. He just … he’s at a loss here. He can’t stop thinking about Castiel, can’t stop wanting him.
Reluctantly, Dean sets his mug in the sink and stares at Cas balefully, but there will be more time to spend together later today.
Cas leans down over him, tugging the wrist that doesn't have his watch on it behind Dean's back, holding it there between them. “Yes, you can, boy,” his voice is dark and hard, and Dean bucks back against him, so fucking aroused. “I know you can be good for me, Dean. How much longer?”
“But?” Dean pressed.
The click of the lube being uncapped sounded and Dean tried not to shamelessly rut against Cas’s thigh, but he was so turned on. Then slick fingers slipped beneath his panties, sliding under lace to tease at him, rubbing, circling, sparks of lust fizzing up at the contact.
Dean's smile was smug. “Duh, wouldn’t be wearing these for you if I didn’t.”
with him. There would be time to explore the many, many fantasies he’d spent so much time thinking of soon, hopefully.
's art that I forgot to write you guys a note.
After a few seconds of silence, Dean finally squared his shoulders.  “Um. Okay. I guess. Just for a little bit. I'm not—people are—”
DaydreamDestiel: In my excitement I forgot to add my notes.  Haha. But here they are:
He’s pulled out of his reminiscing by the creak of the screen door opening—he really oughta oil that. Cas steps out onto the porch, and smiles at him. “Hey, cowboy. You’re back early.”
It wasn't that Cas wanted to die, exactly. He didn't. He’d seen enough gruesome death to know there wasn't any glory in dying. He simply no longer had much of a reason to work so damn hard at staying alive. The only person he cared about in the whole world was gone now, and he hadn't spoken to another human being since he'd set out from Rapid City a week or so ago. Not that he wanted to. Other people were dangerous. They either wanted something from you, wanted to kill you, or wanted to make you care about them so you'd feel like shit when they died, and Cas was done with that last one in particular.
As usual, the walk to the shop was soothing. It helped him to mentally prepare for the potentially obnoxious and absolutely embarrassing conversation he was about to have with Balthazar. The chill in the air barely fazed him—might’ve had something to do with the way his cheeks were burning.
The front door creaked a little as Dean opened it, the bell hanging above chiming to signal a customer's arrival. Shelves as tall as Dean lined the walls, filled to the brim with everything from necklaces and armor to bottles of varying size and color. The floor was a rich brown wood that matched the shelves, and at the back of the room, near the door to the research area, was a locked desk where Sam kept his account records and silver coins.
Cas just smirks. “If you say so.”
Castiel noses along Dean’s jaw, then leans up until his lips brush against Dean’s ear. “After you fuck me exactly the way I tell you to.”
“Things to repair and adjust my crossbow. Some bolts that were left behind in the hunting section.” It didn't sound like a lie, but maybe this guy was a fluent liar.
“Dean, look at me,” Cas asks, and Dean blinks his eyes open, stares up into endless blue. “Did you mean it?”
He leans up and presses a gentle kiss to Dean’s lips, offering him a smile that Dean returns.
Cupping his cheek, Cas leans in and kisses him softly. “Stop panicking.”
Please be sure to send lots of love to
His stomach churned with guilt, his skin was too tight. He hadn’t meant to push Dean too far—but he had and he felt awful about it. Not because Dean had marked him, but because Dean was clearly torn up over it. When really, if Cas'd been a little less hungry it wouldn't've been so intense in the first place. Dean would’ve been able to control himself just fine and right now, things would’ve looked a hell of a lot less bleak.
Cas's hand slid up his back and curled in the top of Dean's hair, pulling his head back, the muscles of his neck taut. He bracketed Dean's body with his and sucked just under his ear, “You can do it, I have faith.”
He pulls Cas's chair out for him even though Cas fondly rolls his eyes. Then he goes and fetches the food. The candlelight, the conversation, and the fact that dinner turned out great makes Dean feel like he did good. Cas looks happy, but this is just the start of their night.
It takes Dean's brain a second to catch up with the sudden lack of sensation, and his eyes open to find Castiel staring at him with intense otherworldly blue eyes, smelling like a fucking wet dream—all omega arousal and honeyed-slick. Lust clenches hot in Dean's belly and a growl he can't help rumbles in his chest.
For a second, Dean stared at Cas, huge green eyes desperately panicked, and Cas could practically see his heart beating jackrabbit fast in his chest before he casted a glance around at all of the people who normally didn't notice him. All of those eyes on him all of a sudden, and Cas could tell Dean didn't have a clue what to do.
Cas winced, regretting the question. He shook his head. “Of him. I'm sorry,” he said. “Listen, I'm going to retrieve my bolt, and then I'll take you back to the library. Maybe we'll find your brother along the way.”
Dean’s smirk widened. “Hey, first of all, that was a classic, and second of all, you, Sammy, are a little snoop.”
Enjoy. <3
“Fuck,” Dean panted, eyes squeezed tight as his hips rolled forward against Cas’s rock solid grip. “Yeah, God, okay.” Dean’s eyes opened, all heat and want and
"So, air, huh?" Dean asked Sam.
His heartbeat picked up when his eyes focused on the face inches from his own. Warm, familiar blue. An intensely masculine scent made up of bergamot, spices and leather with a very faint trace of tobacco filled Dean’s senses and temporarily stunned him into silence. He
His fingers pressed hard into Cas’s back as the heat gathering at the base of his spine pulsed sharply outward. Shockwaves of pleasure lit up behind his closed eyes and he moaned helplessly through it.
Being pissed at someone who’d wrapped their truck around a tree a couple days ago was useless. Being sad about it was somehow worse, but underneath the leftover righteous anger he felt, there was a smidgen of regret that they’d never get to have any kind of closure. That Dad wasn’t going to get over his pride one day and make things right with them, because that chance was gone now. Maybe along the edges, there was guilt too, 'cause Dean had done this to their family.
He'd walked out.
Somehow he pulls together enough brain cells to get them on their sides, the messy blanket out from beneath them, and the clean sheet under it pulled up over their bodies before he passes out, still buried inside of Castiel, one arm curled around his waist and his nose in Castiel’s hair.
“Any day now, Cas,” Dean said. It was supposed to be a light joke, a push to get him to hurry up, but Dean's voice was too breathy, and Cas's hands just kept inching over Dean's skin.
Sam carefully didn’t ask how Dean was, or what they'd been doing, though his slightly wrinkled nose said he definitely had an idea. Instead he peered casually at Cas, “Hey, you still okay to help out tomorrow with the column and the steps?”
actively being a dick to him, Dean gets glimpses of his personality that he really likes. Castiel’s smart, witty, his work ethic is crazy awesome. If he wasn’t so dead set on disliking Dean, they’d probably get along. That’s the really shitty part of all of it.
“Yes,” Cas corrected as he guided Dean to stand in front of him. “Yes, sir.”
He couldn’t be trusted to have friends—or at the very least, he didn’t trust himself enough around other people to even consider making one. As far as Dean was concerned, no one else should trust him either. As much time as he spent wishing he was normal, the fact was, he never would be. He just wished his family would get that too. Maybe then they'd let go of any pipedreams they had that someday he'd be just like everyone else.
He rubbed a hand over his face, worn leather gloves catching on the stubble dotting his jaw. “I want a guard on it tonight, take shifts. It's dangerous even if it doesn't look like it. Shadowlights are crafty and sneaky, they'll use any weakness to their advantage. So no talking to it. Got that?” he asked her more harshly than he meant to.
They made another quick stop by the hardware store and lucked out on a shoulder strap for Sam. Then they took Cas to the motorcycles. Crotch rockets that Dean would've been embarrassed to ride a year ago, but now they offered the best maneuverability, and if they ran into monsters, they'd need that asset. He looked back at Cas. This was gonna be fun.
“Cas?” He didn't get out more than that before Cas's arms were snug around his shoulders and his face was tucked wetly into Dean's neck. A second later Sam was hugging him too, face pressing in on the other side of his neck, equally wet, and Dean had a minute of relief—just overwhelmingly glad that they were both okay, even if he was confused as hell.
Dean’s entire face went a dark pink, cheekbones and forehead, tips of his ears. And wasn’t that adorable and hot and
Thank God Dean came back.
His chest ached. Hollow. Empty. And he just
“Ah … Cas …
Dean's smirk blossomed into a grin, “Who said I was helping?”
Cas let out a frustrated groan. “That's—I think that's best.”

The rumble of the Impala as Dean drove into his school's parking lot didn't garner curious glances anymore. Two years of driving it meant everyone knew it was just him. And like most days, just him didn't warrant so much as a flick of their glances.
you.”
With a sob that was wrenched from deep in his chest, Dean had thrown himself forward through the fire, right into Dad's arms. He'd clung tightly while Dad rushed them out of his room and watched over his shoulder as the flames had spread out of control, licking up the walls and kissing the ceiling before he buried his face in Dad's neck and failed in his attempt not to cry.
The way Cas was looking at him right then, so warm and soft, had flutters starting up in Dean’s chest. He forced himself to glance away toward the shelves behind Cas to calm down, “So … wanna show me around?”
And then Dean's lips spread into a smile, and that's just it, Cas realizes, that
Sighing, Cas finally looks back up at him, painful honesty in his gaze. “Yes.”
So he'd bent over backwards trying to keep out of Zachariah's way, and had still managed to set him off on an irregular basis that meant every inch of his body had been continually attuned to his uncle whenever they'd been in the same room; hyper aware that anything he did could be the wrong thing.
The indulgent smile Cas gave him was patient, and Dean ached to kiss him. “I won’t judge. And if I happen to be uncomfortable with it, I’ll let you know and we can choose something else. I can assure you there’s very little you could say at this moment I wouldn’t agree to.”
Dean struggled for actual words, but no, yeah, those eyes were
It was shitty that Dean felt bad about this. There had to be a way to make him see that Cas was fine with it—at fault for it, actually. He took his socks off, climbed out of bed and padded naked to the bathroom while he tried to think about what he could do.
He complied though, and a primal alpha part of Cas was triumphant about it. Slowly, Dean pushed his jeans down over his hips and gave a little wriggle that sent them to his ankles. He stepped out of them and walked backward, closer to his bed. God, how many times had he fantasized about exactly this? Dean doing exactly what Cas wanted him to, Dean looking at him, turned on and waiting for him.
Cas’s cheeks heated, and his stupid heart fluttered irrationally in his chest. How was he ever supposed to make it through this in one piece?
“Dude!” Charlie's fist as it slammed into the meat of his bicep wasn't entirely unexpected. It still fucking hurt though. He scowled at her as he rubbed where she'd landed her punch. “You knew for months and you never told me! The hell, Cas?”
The stuff that Cas had sent him home with was pretty damn informative. The intro to BDSM one laid out some rules about consent and safewords, checking in, things like that. It had some brief summaries about what BDSM was. Apparently not that fifty shades of bullshit housewives everywhere were reading. The stuff in this pamphlet was all about trust, mutual pleasure, and enjoyment from all parties involved. Something about that released a little bit of tension in him that Dean hadn't noticed he was carrying.
Sam lets out a shuddering breath and Cas knows that it goes against every fibre of his being to run from a fight like this, to leave Cas behind, but the right thing wins out and Sam pulls along a distraught Jack.
Glancing at the microwave clock, Cas smiles softly to himself and pours a mug full of black coffee just as Dean's footsteps clomp down the stairs. They're a well oiled machine in the morning.
Dean looks torn, cheeks turning pink, and his head tilting as he clearly considers whether there's enough time to get away with it, but then he seems to settle on no, which is just as well. They have plans for tonight.
“Mmm. Thank you.”
“Good boy.” There was warmth in his voice again, which Dean filed away, already hopelessly addicted to those two little words and the way Cas said them.
The exception to that had been when he’d had the tattoo on his wrist done. That’d been a bitch to sit through, but he’d done it, anyway.
Cas glanced over at Sam with wide eyes. "Was that you? You
Untrustworthy, shape shifting liars was what they were. They almost never crossed over from their realm into this one, but there was definitely a shadowlight directly on the other side of the river from him. Dean's stomach churned, anger prickling heat along the back of his neck, disgust curling his lip.
(See the end of the chapter for
He forces himself to keep going, perfect hip bones that he’s planning to lick and suck at. Up over the glistening skin of his stomach, the cute freckle just above the dusky pink of his right nipple, the column of his neck, stubble Dean wants to graze his lips against, all the way to those goddamn blue eyes focusing on him with an expression caught somewhere between desire and disbelief.
Sinfully sexy, Dean shuddered all over, breath catching in his throat before he pulled Cas into a hard, biting kiss. “Yeah, that sounds—” Cas gently withdrew his fingers and smirked at the way Dean’s eyes went unfocused, “good.”
He left Dean on the couch with one last playful kiss, and then went to his room where he grabbed Dean some underwear and a pair of grey sweatpants from the freshly laundered basket of his clothes. They’d probably be just a little big on Dean, but they’d do.
Heat surged in his gut, arousal and desire fattened his cock. Cas pushed his hips down into his mattress and his breath pushed out on a low groan. Suddenly, he was too constricted in his clothes.
“Knot me,” Castiel says, calm as anything, like he didn’t just say the best damn words Dean’s ever heard in his entire life. Like Dean doesn’t suddenly have to struggle with keeping himself from blowing way too soon.
“Hey, Cas,” Sam said voice a little hoarse in a way that sickeningly tangled Dean’s stomach up.
The problem, of course, is all that tension between them—it’s distracting. And Dean starts to think that an even bigger problem than sleeping with his charge, might be
One little word and the kid grinned ear to ear, his mother smiling gratefully at Dean. Giving her a polite nod, he continued on his way to Sam's. Here and there a few people greeted him as he went. Most of them Dean knew by name; Shepherd's Bend was a small enough village, and the longer Dean was stationed there, the more he came to know its occupants.
Cas took his time, tracing over the curve of each cheek and letting Dean’s anticipation ratchet up. The crack of the first blow as it landed stung sharply, and Dean’s body jerked helplessly forward a little. Sensation deeper than Cas’s hand had been but still so damn good. He relaxed back, and another crack followed. Then another and another. Each blow that landed forced Dean’s stomach muscles to tighten, his ass to tense. The heat under his skin rose quickly to a burn.
He wandered around looking at the new items Sam had in stock while he waited for him to come out—he’d learned the hard way that he shouldn’t be allowed in an area that contained Sam’s work. Winding up with sparkly orange hair for two weeks was the kind of thing he only needed to go through once.

And oh boy, oh fuck, does he ever regret that a second later when he’s getting a lungful of toasted pecans, vanilla, caramel and the slightest hint of buttery pie crust. How the fuck can a person even
Desperately, Dean bunched a hand in the front of Cas’s shirt and yanked him closer. He tilted his head down and before he second guessed himself, he pressed his lips to Cas’s, hard. Dry at first until Cas parted his lips on a hushed growl and surged forward. His hand clutched at the hair on top of Dean’s head at exactly the same time as he sucked Dean’s bottom lip into his mouth.
“Look,” Dean said after Cas had gathered his stuff and thanked him for everything. “If you're plannin’ to explore the city or whatever, you should at least let me show you around.”
“We can't take him. Not like this. Take Jack, go out through the garage.”
If it helps at all, I broke myself too. T.T Feel free to cry with me in the comments.
“God, Cas. Ah,” he panted, pleasure and need in his voice like a physical touch along every one of Cas’s flayed raw nerves. “More—I need—Cas, please.”
The alarm on his watch goes off and Dean lets out a shuddering breath, fucking finally. Cas slides his hand up Dean's arm to his wrist and shuts it off. “Told you that you could do it. Now you just need to keep yourself from coming while I get you good and wet for me.”
Even weakened, unable to fight, shouldn't Cas have resisted
he moans, all long and high.
“Alright, Sammy! Let's get goin’.”
What if Cas actually tried to talk to him? With Dean's luck, he'd spontaneously light himself on friggin’ fire and burn down the whole damn school or something. Idly, he wondered if his parents would stop pressuring him to make friends then.
The time Dean stayed with Sam for three days because they'd both lost their tempers and been too stubborn to make up until they were both going out of their minds with how awful they’d felt. How Dean’d shown back up at their house with a dozen roses and an apology even though Castiel’d started the argument.
After that all he remembered was the cold of being outside in his pajamas while their house burned down—the flash of ambulance and firetruck lights, scratchy blankets wrapped around their shoulders and falling asleep in the middle of the chaos with a heavy, guilty heart.
The right side of the room was mostly toys; vibrators and dildos, plugs, various restraint systems too. His eyes lingered on a few things here and there, but he was too strung out to actually pick anything, and plus, he wasn't sure if he
“Did you hear…?” Castiel can’t help but ask, and he knows he sounds eager.
“Come here,” Cas directed, one hand held out for Dean.
“Hmmm,” Cas drew the sound out, like he was deliberating.
“You guys are gross,” Charlie announced, affection in her voice a contradiction to her words.
Slick precome pearled up at the tip and he spread it around with his thumb before he circled his palm over it in a slippery shock of sensation that curled his toes. He imagined it was Dean’s hand, nervous when he first circled his fingers, but quickly catching on once he realized it was pretty easy. He remembered the sensation of Dean’s swollen lips on his, the slide of his tongue.
Great. And now Cas wasn't even bothering to hold back. It took him a minute of laughter to calm down and wipe the tears that'd gathered at the corners of his eyes. “Dean, that's not—this is an
How does that even work?”
They’re both slippery with sweat, and Dean rubs his hand over the dip in Castiel’s spine, up the back of his neck, and fuck his he ever praying this trick works because his knot’s fit to burst and he can’t hold off much longer. Heat in his gut like pressurized magma, he squeezes his hand at the base of Castiel’s skull.
Sam was looking at him, pleading in his eyes, like he thought Dean could still save him, but if he did what she wanted, she was gonna use him to let out unspeakable evil. And Dean had a sinking feeling that she'd kill them all anyway, just to watch them bleed. It didn’t stop the part of him that wished he could just give her what she wanted, and they could let someone else deal with the aftermath.
“You know everyone in Sioux Falls?”
“How does it feel?” Cas asked, a low growl of a question—proof that he was every bit as affected as Dean.
“I…” Dean blinked a few times in rapid succession. The idea of Cas actually wanting him to stick around was sorta mind boggling. “If you wanna, I’m into giving it a shot. But Cas, I’m just a boring mid-thirties landscaper barely scraping by at my dad’s company. You’re obviously a successful author with a gorgeous house and a ton going for you. Which is much more
Dean ground his ass back against Cas—needed him to move. “Please, Cas. Fuck me.”
“I thought we could keep things simple tonight. You listed bondage as a yes. I brought bondage tape, would you like to try it?” At Dean’s nod he continued, “I was going to suggest just starting with that, but you had spanking underlined with a little note specifying an interest in trying paddles or floggers, and you’d also underlined being dominated, and dirty talk, along with a few other things.”
“Oh,” Cas said, then schooched back. Settling himself against the wall behind them, he tilted his head against it and looked at Dean through eyes that were half-shut. Sexy, Dean’s mind supplied. He looked sexy like that, the line of his throat and the sharpness of his jaw accentuated. Dean had to twist back almost uncomfortably to look at him. “Well, if it helps,” he waved his hand at Dean, “keep going.”
He pictured Dean bent over, ass up and back arched. Maybe he’d have little dimples above his ass that Cas could dip his tongue into before he moved further down. He'd start off slow, little flicks and circles of his tongue over the tightly furled rim of Dean's hole. The heady taste of him would make Cas moan as he slowly sank his tongue inside. Dean'd echo him with a high whimper that'd sound all wrecked and needy. His thighs would tremble and he'd shiver with every deep push of Cas's tongue, every curl of it.
“Easy to please, ain’t ya?” Dean grinned and brought the mugs over to the bed. “What’ll coffee get me?”
to stay rational. So he takes slow steps backward that Dean seems powerless to do anything but mimic, following after him.
Cas is everything Dean’s ever wanted, and he wouldn’t change a moment of their lives together. From the over the top way he’d admitted he was in love with Cas, to eloping the week before Cas had to leave for university, through those four long years where they’d switched off on visiting each other while Cas went through college.
Dean was cleaning his guns on the kitchen table in the fading orange sunlight that filtered in through the window. He was breathtaking at all times, but in the sunset he was devastating. Cas still wondered how someone like Dean had ever taken interest in the awkward broken shell of a man he felt like he was most days. But Dean looked at him, and Cas didn’t feel quite as hopeless as he had. His chest still ached whenever his thoughts strayed to his past, but he was getting good at burying it. His method of coping probably wasn’t the healthiest. Things just seemed less overwhelming that way.
Glancing up, Dean caught Cas’s eye as he returned, condom and lube in hand. He only held Dean’s gaze briefly before dropping his stare to Dean’s crotch. Chewing on his lip, Dean watched his reaction, the way his throat bobbed, and he slowed his approach, like he wanted to look at Dean for as long as possible before touching. That attention was liquid fire setting Dean ablaze with need.
It isn’t until Mr. Adler’s out of sight that Castiel finally lets a scowl curl his lips down, he keeps a tight lid on his scent, still unwilling to let anyone know just how much this bothers him. The last thing he needs is for people to start talking about how
. Cas fucked him perfect and deep, angling his hips just right so that he kept grazing that spot inside of Dean that sent bright pulses of pleasure chasing up his spine. So good that he was burning up with it, each slam of Cas's hips against the red-hot skin of his ass a torturous combination of pain and euphoria.
Preternaturally bright green eyes are focused intently on him. Dean's flushed cheeks and parted lips show his surprise, and all of Castiel's thoughts clamor for attention at once, but he can't focus on
After, when they collapsed together on the couch with Dean curled up on Cas, he let out a satisfied sigh. “Yeah,” he said, half-drunk with the mind-blowing orgasm he’d just had. “We’re absolutely doing that again. And again. For as long as you wanna.”
Cas watched his fingers disappearing in and out of Dean’s stretched tight hole, entranced. Finally, he wiped his face off a little on Dean's  inner thigh and shifted up onto his knees. He kept his fingers working inside of Dean, but he couldn’t hold himself back any longer—he wrapped a hand around his own aching cock. Relief zipped along his skin and up his back as he fisted himself. Easily, Cas could've come just like this, but he slowed himself. “Look at you,” he purred, “taking it so good for me. Tight, slick ass feels so good.”
“So why do you wanna help me?” His big eyes were evaluating Cas intelligently.
Cas laughed. “Got me there. How about I promise that
Almost immediately Sam texted him back the address, and a question about how he was doing. Dean thanked him for the address and told him that he was fine. It was mostly the truth anyway. He dropped his phone on the bed, and got up.
The last thing he recalls is fighting Michael to expel him. It's fuzzy ‘round the edges and there are holes in his memory, but he knows that they bitterly fought before Dean finally remembered how to expel an angel. It'd taken every damn last one of Dean's reserves, but he'd somehow won.
So, it's probably not surprising that this update is late. lol. If you're a longtime reader of mine, you likely already know to expect that. ^-^;; We're doing our best to get these out as fast as we can, but it looks like weekly was a little optimistic. Anyway, thanks for sticking with us, and I hope you enjoy the update.
“Yes?”
“Sounds good.”
Cas dropped and grabbed the gun from his boot. “Sam, we need to get over there!”
“Cas,” he gasped, needy and desperate already.
“You mean this?” Cas asked. “I liked it so much that I wanted to add to it. How many people can say they have their soulmate’s handprint on their body?”
Castiel fiddles with his tie as he sits in the back of the cab and makes stilted small talk with the beta driving the car. He’s working hard to control the pissed off feeling that curls in his stomach. It’s Friday night. He should be in his pj’s with a delivery pizza and cheesecake on his coffee-table while he binges whatever action/adventure show catches his attention.
Then he stood there under the hot water, and told himself to get it together. He’d known this trip was gonna bring up a lot of shit that he'd buried down deep, but he’d really thought he’d handle it better than he was. Not be at risk of falling completely apart on the first day back. He hated feeling weak like this, like he was proving Dad right.
When he eventually drifted down from the high of his climax, he grimaced at the mess he’d made. He kind of regretted that he hadn’t grabbed a tissue or even cupped his hand to catch his release. Now he was gonna have to find the energy to shower before work.
A flush of warmth and sharp, sharp lust rush through his body as Dean complies. Takes a step closer, then turns around. Lets Cas’s hand spread wide on his hip guide him down. The fat head of Cas’s cock presses bluntly against him where he’s wet and open, a drawn out moment of pressure before his body gives and Cas sinks inside him. Pulls him down and down and down until he’s shoved in as deep as he can go. Until Dean’s ass is flush with his hips. Dean pants for it like a two dollar whore, whimpers when Cas’s iron grip holds him there and doesn’t let him move.
“Cas,
“Shhh.” Cas's hand rubbing firmly over his back calmed him, “I'll take care of you, Dean. Just trust me.”
Anticipation a living breathing thing beneath his skin as Cas dips his fingers down under his waistband and finds out that he’s not wearing underwear. Fuck, the only sign Cas even notices is a subtle shift in the way the smoke is clouding up, making Dean dizzy.
Here he faltered, facade once more giving way to nerves. “I don't… I… um, I guess I hoped you’d be, y’know, interested. In me.”
By the time he was ready to call it quits for now, Dean had dusted and vacuumed (with the same goddamn broken vacuum) both his and Sam’s room. He’d opened the windows to air them out and then he’d extremely grudgingly donned a pair of thick rubber gloves and tackled the bathroom.
He hooked Dean’s legs around his waist and propped his weight on one forearm as he rolled his hips sensually, slow drags of his cock in and almost out of Dean. Goosebumps prickled up over Dean’s skin as Cas slid his hand up along the side of his neck, kissing him deep and tender with slow pushes of his tongue into Dean’s mouth that mimicked the way he was fucking him. Every nerve in Dean’s body was resonating with Cas’s movements.
Dean didn't let it bother him though, he just put his winter jacket on. A simple hand-me-down leather one from his dad. One perk of being a fire elemental was that he ran hot, and didn't get cold easily. Not that he was immune to winter temperatures, but he never really needed a puffy winter jacket like Sam did.
Cas was trying to soothe him—Dean knew that. On the edges of his awareness he heard Cas's wrecked voice pleading for Dean to stop.
“No,” Dean says with a smirk, “I'm just Dean.”
“Mmhmm.” She laughed. “Oh man, this is too good, I can’t.”
God, his boyfriend is a dork. An adorable, sweet, dork. “Promise. I swear to God if don't get fucked, I might actually lose my freakin’ mind.”
He doesn’t even try to make a show of it, doesn’t play that he’s got any restraint when it comes to Cas, just tears open Cas’s belt and unzips him, Pushes his boxers down along with his pants until they’re dragged halfway down his thighs, “Good?”
“Fuck, your mouth.
Sam was smaller than Cas and Cas was struggling to stay but Sam yelled as he tugged on on him. “Cas, we gotta get out!”
“Yeah,” Dean said, his own voice thick with emotion. “We’re gonna have a pup.”
is worth it.
“I… the last few nights I couldn’t sleep so I took some walks in the woods,” Dean started and Sam raised an eyebrow, leaning his hip against a shelf and crossing his arms. “I saw a shadowlight.”
The malicious glee in Mr. Adler’s eyes while he forces his face into a falsely sympathetic smile dashes any hope Castiel had, fury seethes in his stomach, and still Castiel manages to keep his scent and expression neutral.
Dean shot him a look that said are-you-fucking-kidding and Sam smirked, but he dropped it.
“I—yeah, sure.” Dean nervously chewed at his thumbnail. “So, um … what were you thinking of for tonight?”
He slides the head of his cock between Cas's cheeks, and guides it down with a hand wrapped around the base until it's right where they both want it. Then he pauses, and waits for it.
lots of love, and follow her on tumblr because her art is fantastic!
Lilith laughed again, somehow even crueler than before, unhinged. A shiver Dean couldn’t suppress rolled down his spine. “Half the planet, Dean? Try the
“Please, Cas, please. C’mon.” And then he was pressing inside, a slow thrust all the way in, Dean ground back against him, the rasp of Cas’s shirt sleeve over his sensitized burning skin lighting him up. “I need more.”
“Dean,” Cas’s voice, low with relief to his left. “There you are.”
Dean scrambles. He probably looks ridiculous with how eager he is, but he doesn't fucking
Two plates, a knife, bread, peanut butter and grape jelly—he spared a brief hope that Dean liked grape jelly because it was the only kind he had—he quickly assembled the sandwiches, put everything away and headed back into the living room with a plate in each hand, and a can of Coke under each arm.
Cas chuckles, and the tension in Dean's shoulders releases. “Hardly.”
Contentedly, Dean melted into the bed as Cas collapsed heavy over top of him with a breathless chuckle. He buried his face in Dean’s neck as their breathing slowed, skin sticking messily together, warmth between them that kept out the slight chill of the room.
“Come for me Dean,” Cas said, guttural, and Dean’s body seized up as he let go.
The air rushes out of Dean's lungs on a moan. Cas wore a plug. Cas got himself ready for this at some point before they left the house. He's gonna get to fuck his husband in his favorite car on their anniversary. It's like Christmas and his birthday and every other holiday rolled into one and Dean's
On the way back up, he had to tell himself not to run, because that would be supremely pathetic. He kept it to a brisk jog as a compromise, and it was still a struggle not to speed up.
“Mhm. Come sit,” Cas said, nodding in the direction of the living room. That had to be a good sign, right? Cas wanting to get more comfortable. At least Dean thought so until he was sitting on the couch alone, and Cas was leaning with his back against the french doors.
“Cas,” Dean whispered, overwhelmed with just how good Cas made him feel, body coiled tight.
Cas trembles beneath him, and Dean's whole body goes white hot. Sticky warmth spills over Dean's hand and drips down his wrist, and fuck, Cas came. Dean stops holding back.
Sam's store was closed up for the day, empty when Dean had arrived. Dusty footprints on the wood showed decent traffic in and out throughout the day, so Dean hoped he'd had time to work on finding something to trap a shadowlight.
Cas pushed away the very, very tempting image of Dean in his bed and all thoughts of phone sex or sexting. At least for now.
A girl no older than Sam with long brown hair and big brown eyes walked out of the shadows along the far wall with her hand on Sam's arm as she dragged him along. He looked a little banged up but okay. Sam's eyes focused fearfully on Dean. Rage sang along every nerve ending Dean had but it didn't matter because he couldn't touch his power.
She’s got a damn good point—they
He felt Dean's hesitation before he spoke. “I don't know. I mean… I don't feel bad that I killed all those people. I… I should, but I don't.” Almost absently, his thumb rubbed circles on the bare skin of Cas's back. “All I feel is relieved that they can't hurt you or Sam now.” He inhaled a shaky breath and blew it out. “Cas, I didn't hesitate. I didn't even flinch. I mean, for you or my family, the things I'm willin' to do or kill… it just… uh, it scares me.”
“Such a good omega, aren't you, Dean? Always so fucking wet for me. Want you to do something for me, okay, baby?”
“Cas, c’mon,” Dean groaned, legs already trembling, fingers white knuckling in the sheets, his hard cock leaking onto his stomach.
Brow furrowing, Sam frowned and ran his fingers over the rope. “I can't guarantee it'll work, but that's why I added in the iron dust. If the enchantment and mountain ash berry don't bind it's powers, the iron’ll get it to take off. It's a feature in all the myths I found. Seems like a pretty safe bet that that part’s true, at least.”
“Um … yes?” He hadn’t mean for it to come out like a question, but he was still a little off-balance.
“Fuck,” Dean whispered on a shaky exhale.
, Cas definitely liked the sound of that, Dean could tell by the way his hand dug into Dean’s asscheek. “Why don’t I start and you tell me if you want it harder or when to stop?”
Dad plated up the food and brought it over, small grin on his face that Dean did his best to ignore. The food smelled great and Dean squirted ketchup onto his eggs, then poured maple syrup over his sausages in a time honored tradition.
, who mentioned the song
So now Dean was sitting in his car in the school parking lot and dreading having to head inside. His stomach was still hot with humiliation and his head throbbed faintly. He’d been able to push it down for a couple days when he didn’t have to face Cas—face what he’d done to him.
Slowly, Cas guides Dean's legs back down to the bed, barely gives himself time to catch his breath before he carefully pulls out and slides back down Dean's body.
Cas smiled back, a tiny unsure one, but he motioned Dean inside. "Excellent. I was sorry to see him go, he's done such a fantastic job for me in the past. But time marches on."
Dean chuckled, full-throated and low. “Mmm. I'm sure. C'mon.” He guided Cas to the door, a few amused whoops following them out into the night air.
*****
Dean’s admission into The University of Kansas had been a big issue of contention between them at the time. Before Dean’d presented, Dad wouldn’t have batted his eyes twice at Dean’s ambitions, but after … after was why they hadn’t been home in ten years.
Relief flashed across Cas’s face and Dean realized he’d been nervous, kinda cute.
Sam’s amused voice came from just behind him, “You two need a minute?”
She looked flatly at him, clearly implying that was a stupid idea. It wasn't though; the peace between Dean's kingdom, Laurellia, and the northern kingdom of Stormridge might’ve been relatively new, but it
He'd had Sam's help designing this room when it'd become apparent Shepherd's Bend would be long term enough that he required his own housing. It wasn't big, but they'd made the most of it.
“Just let go for me. Trust me, Dean. Not gonna hurt anyone.” Cas bit a kiss into the curve of Dean's neck, just above his collar, and Dean arched under him with a guttural moan of his name that Cas felt all the way to his toes.
Dean whimpered. God help him, he whimpered high in his throat—a noise he never made outside of a heat—and Cas was already drawing it out of him. The low, silky-rough sound of Cas’s voice kept getting him hotter and hotter.
One of his hands smooths up Dean’s side, while his other perfect, soft, big hand curls around Dean’s diamond hard dick. He’s so wet that the slide of Cas’s fist is easy, tight and he arches into it, Cas going soft inside of him, and he’s so close it won’t take long—it never does like this. Not when Cas is whispering up into his ear, “Did so good, Dean. Fuck, you made me come so hard. Gonna be leaking out of you for days, won’t I, baby? You look so good like this. Already wanna fuck you again. Never wanted anyone as much as I want you, you know that?”
With that, he tugged the door open and entered. Huh. Not … quite what he expected. There weren’t any action figures or collectibles or anything, really, that qualified as a toy at first glance. His confusion must’ve showed on his face, because the woman smirked at him.
After a while, he finally decided maybe he should change the subject. Maybe this was too much for Cas. “So… it's almost winter, y’know. I think maybe you should stick around a while longer—so you don't freeze to death before—”
Frowning, Dean drops his gaze. “Obviously, Cas. I wouldn't just say somethin’ like that if I didn't.”
for always being such wonderful supporters & cheerleaders when I need you.
He wraps one hand around Cas’s forearm and pulls it down to wrap across his hips. Makes a pitiful little noise and clenches around Cas. There’s a soft little hiss behind him and Dean smirks for a second before a hand in his hair tugs his head back, pulls his neck taut. “Dean.”
Realization rocks Dean to his core, his stomach plummeting, “You're worried I'm temporary. That I'll outgrow you or some shit.”
“Wow. Cas Novak? Seriously?” Sam asked, this uncomfortably awed tone in his voice that definitely didn't belong there.
Dean's breath rushed out in woosh. “Yes, sir.”
After that, Cas slowly kissed his way down Dean’s body. Anticipation built up between them in steady waves the lower he got. Sucking little hot kisses along Dean’s waistband, a soft brush of Cas's cheek against the head of his cock setting off sparks behind Dean's eyes.
“You didn’t have to do that,” Dean said gruffly.
Cas brushed his lips against Dean’s wrist where skin met leather. Just a soft touch, but Dean shivered at it, skin sensitized. “First, I’m going to strip you down. Right here. I’m going to bind your arms together,” Cas informed him as he reached for the tape, “then I’m going to take you up to your room, put you on your bed. Face down, ass up. Presented like the perfect, pretty omega you are for me.”
The shadowlight’s gaze sharpened on Dean. There was a tense moment—every single hair on Dean’s skin standing on edge, and then all of the fight suddenly drained from the shadowlight like air rushing from its lungs.
When his pants finally started to feel uncomfortable, Cas lifted up a little and grinned down at Dean. Smugly he announced, “See, told you. Just like I said, you didn't hurt me.”
Except that it just kept getting worse with the more that he noticed about Dean. Then there was the whole soulmates, fated to be together thing. Which was another problem, because Cas didn’t really know what to do with that.
Unfortunately, Cas seemed to come to his senses and remember they were in public—at his workplace no less—and stepped back.
Cas's burst of laughter made Dean grin wider. He loved being the cause of it. “Not so much a performance evaluation as ensuring you enjoyed everything.”
Shaking his head slightly, Cas did as he was told, and revealed a photo. He picked it up to look at it, and Dean’s nerves erupted again as he studied Cas’s face for his reaction. It was a picture he’d taken this morning: a closeup of the positive pregnancy test in his hand, and Dean himself smiling in the background.
It was pitch black and Dean didn't bother lighting the lamp. He knew exactly where everything was, and he brought Cas carefully to his room, keeping the contact between them limited to their hands. He liked drawing things out. Liked it even more when he could goad a partner into taking what they wanted without ever having to express in words that that was exactly what
“Dean,” he pants, voice wrecked, fucking Dean just the way he likes it, pushing them both higher and higher.
Cas nodded, an exaggerated motion. “Right. Yes. That. Thank you.” After an awkward little wave, Cas retreated into the house. Dean stood there with his hands on his hips, smirking and looking after him for a moment before he got down to work.
pick something with Cas right there. Then again, lust heated up low in his belly when he pictured it, so maybe he could.
Cas's hand on his hip pushed him up the bed a little, making more space so that he could kneel up behind Dean. “I’m gonna make you feel so good, baby. Promise I'll fuck you hard now—but you need to hold on for me. I want you to wait until I come first, then I'll give you permission and you can come all over the sheets for me. Can you do that, Dean?”
for him. Fuck.
They don't say anything, Dean just walks over and takes his mug from Cas, pressing a gentle, lingering kiss to Cas's lips. It's not even sexual in nature, just comfort. This is where they both belong, and in the still of the morning, they let themselves enjoy a few stolen moments before they'll part again.
Sighing, Sam massaged the bridge of his nose with his finger and thumb. “I can't guarantee it'll work,” he qualified.
Wide and happy, Cas grinned at him. “Good. I thought about asking if you wanted to do it now, but I'm pretty sure your mom would kill me and then your dad would hide my body.”
His fingers tighten in Castiel’s hair, his hips stuttering helplessly. “Cas, I … fuck … I’m gonna—”
He stands there expectantly, probably waiting to see if Castiel will fall apart, but as if Castiel would ever give him the satisfaction. “Of course,” Castiel replies evenly.
A quick shower later, he dressed in his last clean pair of boxer-briefs, dark wash jeans and a white t-shirt. Down to his last pair of socks too, he noticed as he grabbed them from his bag. After he tugged on his white socks, he gathered his dirty clothes from the floor and made his way downstairs. He dumped the clothing into the washer to be put on later, and headed for the kitchen.
“Duh,” Dean says pulling off the dirt road and into the field in front of it. “But we know what's under that coat of paint, and that's all that matters.”
Dean's eyes are sparkling when he closes the door. “Nah, not too much. Not this time, Cas.”
“Hi, Dean,” he replied pointedly as he squinted at Charlie.
Change isn’t Dean’s strong suit, but there was really only so long he could suck up to Dick Roman and keep a hold on his dignity. So when Sandover had finally sent him an offer that was worth it, he’d quickly taken the opportunity to get outta dodge.
Today, though, he rushed through cleaning, drying off, and dressing. Quickly, he tugged on his off-white linen underwear, then his brown woolen pants, tying the front flap and waist. Stockings were next, and brown riding boots after that, he pulled them up to his knees and looped the button closures up his calves, securing them.
A lie or the truth? Which was worse when the truth would tear open old wounds for both of them. Seventeen years he'd kept it to himself, tried to pretend it was all some sort of dream, the product of a desperate mind, but there was Cas proving him wrong, making him dig up stuff that was better left buried.
Chuckling to himself at the theatrics, Dean followed.
shop.”
“Yeah?” Cas asked, voice low and rough, right before he slapped his open palm on Dean’s ass, just hard enough to really sting. “Liked that?”
“Me too,” Dean admitted on a slightly shaky breath as he licked his lips and reveled in the way Cas tracked the motion. A little frustrated groan from the back of Cas's throat made Dean smirk.
“Oh, they’re… uh, they’re yours. Of course. Sam brought them to me. I didn't mean to…”
“It’s nice,” Dean says of the office, turning back to face Mr. Adler.
The heat coming off your skin? All red and marked up with my handprints, I just can't wait. Can you?”
There was a beat where Dean appeared to be sizing him up, and then he said, “Yeah, sure. Why not? I kinda wanna see where you live anyway.”
Somehow, his embarrassment over the disaster that was spaghetti seemed to have faded with Dean’s good naturedness. He felt a little foolish, though, as he glanced over at the pot of gluey pasta he’d need to clean later. For now, he forced his gaze away from the mess, and did his best to ignore the lingering smell of burnt meat.
Dean sighs again, and pulls Cas closer. “Yeah, okay.” He kisses the side of Cas's neck and then pulls away. “Love you.”
Boring. “Losing me,” Dean announced, resting his hip against the desk. “Get to the point, how likely is it that this is gonna get my ass handed to me instead of binding the shadowlight?”
Softly, Cas’s hand slipped down to cradle Dean’s jaw and tilted his head up until their eyes met. A shock of serious blue, so beautiful that Dean was left breathless. “You can trust me.”
Up in his room Cas made good on his promise. He dropped his bag by the bed after he tossed a black leather paddle from inside of it onto the blanket. Then he helped Dean climb up on the mattress, arms bent in front of him, forehead pressed to his forearms and his ass in the air, legs spread. He was exposed, dripping wet, and trembling with impatience and longing. He tried not to think too much about how he must look like this, needy and waiting for Cas.
So it wasn't the fact that he was being watched, but a question of who was doing the watching. The who in this case, was Dean Winchester. Out of the corner of his eye he'd caught Dean glancing at him and away much more than usual today. It intrigued him even though it shouldn't. Just like he shouldn't know that it was Dean's birthday today, but he did. He knew so much more about Dean than he'd ever admit to.
He keeps it up for a while, teasing both of them with the idea of more before the need in his gut grows too big to deny. He withdraws his fingers and fumbles for the packet of lube he’d dropped on the seat.
“Earth to Cas,” Charlie sing-songed just as Dean glanced over at them.
Cas flooded the condom in violent euphoric pulses that drained him and left his balls aching. He sagged against Dean, sweaty forehead pressing to the back of his shoulder, and they stayed that way, gasping, slowly catching their breath.
Bright hot sparks of pleasure wracked Cas's body—the heat building inside of him flew outward in blazing pulses as he came, hard. Long, long moments of intense euphoria that greyed out his vision and buzzed in his ears.
A cool breeze sent a chill down his spine and ruffled his hair, and then to his left the distinct sound of hooves—cavalry—his mind instantly leapt to. No. It was a single horse, he quickly realized. His breath rushed out of him in a slow release.
Sam laughed.
sorry that the outcome of his desire to protect Dean had been that Dean’d ended up losing control when it was obvious to anyone who looked that Dean needed that semblance of complete control over himself. Cas wasn’t sure that even after he explained what’d gone wrong that Dean would accept the fact that he wasn’t responsible. At the very least, he was worried that Dean would retain blame for ‘hurting’ Cas.
“Yes,” Dean hissed, breath catching in the middle. “Fuck, yes.”
One turned into two, turned into a weekend spent bingeing, turned into staying in all week after work to soak up every single word. And shit. Cas was kinky. Or he had some extremely kinky fantasies anyway. Dean felt a little awkward jerking off to books Cas didn't know he was reading, but he didn't have a whole lot of shame when it came to jerk off fodder. Most of the people he'd thought of over the years had been people he'd never gotten the chance to bang, so… he figured this wasn't so different. It was a little harmless entertainment, and if he got an extra little thrill because Cas had typed this out with those long, elegant fingers, well… Dean brushed it off.
*****
Cas can't help it, he rolls his eyes and lets out a breathless sort of chuckle as relief relaxes his muscles. “How?”
He can still recall Dean's rough-gentle hands stroking over his cheeks and through his hair the first time Castiel had admitted just how much he missed him. The way he'd soothed him with soft words and made love to him slowly in their bed, reassuring Castiel that they'd always come back together.
And it seemed like they were making progress. So much so that he'd been thrilled Sam wanted to move to Shepherd's Bend. The village had been in sore need of a shop like his, and he'd get to see his brother again, what more could Dean have wanted?
In a flash, she closed the distance between them and wrapped her hand around his throat. There was absolutely nothing Dean could do. His hands gripped her wrist, fingers digging into her skin, and his legs dangled. She didn’t even flinch as his nails drew blood. She was so fucking strong. How was she that strong?
They were at the gate, gearing up for a run into the city when the growls and howling started. It seemed to be coming from all around them. Dean ordered people into defensive positions. It'd been weeks since the last attack on the camp. They hunted the woods to a good radius around here to keep the odds down. His dad and Uncle Bobby had worked to set up the camp, scrambling enough survivors together to make a go of it, to make it defensible. A lot of their army buddies had made their way here too, which meant they'd had a good chance. Some people were lost along the way, but the rest were thriving half-decently. Eeking out a living and Dean hoped there were more places like this out there somewhere. There had to be.
That did sound like Sam. There was a clatter from the back of the library over near the stairs. Dean darted a quick look back toward it, but his view was blocked by bookshelves. “Sammy, that you?”
He pushed his way through the sliding doors out front before either of the guys manning them had a chance to open them. No clue where he was going, but he couldn’t stay there right now. He ended up around the far side of the building, leaning on the wall. His head was tilted back against the white siding, cold evening air that made him shiver as he gulped in deep gasping breaths. He squeezed his eyes shut and tried to block everything out as his heart pounded too fast in his chest and bile rose in his throat.
He's sitting in Charlie's book store when it comes on the radio. The deep thump of the bass drum catches his attention as he's thumbing through a book he's read several times, but keeps coming back to. Good stories are like that, they nestle their way into your heart and pull you in over and over again.
Cas ground forward first, a tiny bit deeper, and Dean shivered, hot all over, sweat sticking him to the couch, and then Cas pulled back and slammed in. Again and again, powerful thrusts crushing Dean into the cushions, making his skin prickle and his cock ache. Until Dean was lost in sensation and pleasure and the feel of Cas inside him, Cas’s hands on him, in his hair, pulling, sliding down to rest against his throat. Every part of Dean was vibrating, glowing with how fucking hot Cas got him.
You got that? You take him and you run! Just like you said, remember? You promised me, Cas.”
“Make sense? Yeah, tell me about it, but you dumbasses were gonna get yourselves killed and … that wasn't an option. So,” Dean shrugs a shoulder, and his eyes are so
“I saw you looking at it,” Cas told him, another rush of warmth pulsed in Dean’s chest. “I thought you might like it for when we do this. When you wear it, we’ll be scening, and you’ll be mine. What I mean by that is that you’ll be expected to obey my orders. No touching yourself unless you ask permission and I grant it, and you don’t come without my permission. If you need to stop at any point, you can say your safeword and I’ll stop immediately. Do you want that?”
had kissed him. It seemed like kind of a big deal to him. Love songs and movies and poems were written about this sort of thing, and it’d been good—so, so good. Even if it wasn’t for fate and destiny and all that crap, he
Dean’s lips twitched up, pleased, and he set about pulling the sweatpants down and off. The cool air of Dean’s bedroom sent a shiver down Cas’s spine. “Guess I forgot to lend you underwear.”
Dean grimaced involuntarily and Bobby was only the second person to ask him that. Thankfully Cas cut in.
Dean’s grin broadened as he glanced over at Bobby Singer, best father-figure stand-in a couple of sorta pathetic kids could have. “Nah. We just call that being Sam.”
For some reason, Cas couldn’t stop looking over at Dean, probably because Dean kept glancing at him, too. And it wasn't something new or anything, Dean had always watched other people from the sidelines. Cas more than most. Just like Dean watched him, Cas, in turn, had always had an awareness of Dean that went a bit beyond simple curiosity. One that he could never quite put his finger on. He doubted that anyone else noticed Dean like he did, or really thought about him at all. Dean flitted through school like a ghost that no one else could see.
fuck. Oh fucking fuck. “God, Cas,” he groans it out in a rush of breath that he can’t control.
“Yeah, okay,” he says, voice wrecked, “But I want two egg rolls this time.”
So far he'd only caught glimpses, and never head on. Until now. Until he was staring at glowing blue eyes and wracking his brain for any recollection of lore that mentioned glowing vibrant blue eyes among the features of a pegasus.
Anticipation squirmed in Dean’s gut, quickly chased by desire. “Yes, yeah. Definitely.”
He’d made it to the last button, tugging the shirt free, when Cas tore his mouth away, ignoring the groan of protest Dean let out, and the way he tried to chase after him. One hand on Dean’s jaw was all it took to still him.
The elevator takes him to the main floor of the building, and like he’d been told, Mr. Adler’s there to greet him, and show him to his new desk. He gets the nickel tour and by the end of it Dean’s already sure he’s not gonna like Mr. Adler. The guy’s a dick. Uses his status and his scent to demean anyone he thinks is lower in the pecking order than him.
on board with this. “Fuck, Cas.”
Cas might have had a way with people thanks to his genetics and the inborn charm that that came with, but he never knew how to get anyone to stick around. Had never so much as
That morning he’d decided to start packing stuff away. He went out and bought some cardboard boxes for the things he wanted to keep, and some clear plastic bags for things he would to give away to goodwill. He’d just finished up in his old bedroom when his phone chimed with a text from Cas. It was an address, Cas’s place, Dean assumed, and it said there was a surprise waiting for him this afternoon if he was interested.
