“Can you touch yourself?” John asks, but Sherlock can’t even answer, much less do what John asks him to. His legs are wrapped around John’s hips, his fingers digging into John’s back, and he can’t move, he can’t do anything lest he should lose this perfect spot where everything feels blissfully good.
“Let me,” John said softly and took it from him, but he didn’t open it yet. Instead, he sought out Sherlock’s eyes, looking at him intently.
Sherlock hesitates for a second, wondering if it would be best to keep this to himself for now, then says, “I call it The Beekeeper’s Sonata.”
But then, just when John begins to feel his orgasm building, Sherlock stops, and when John opens his eyes, he finds Sherlock straddling him and getting ready to sink down on John’s cock.
John reaches for the bottle, trying to jostle Sherlock as little as possible, and holds it up for him as Sherlock drinks. Then he finds the chocolate bar and feeds little pieces of it to Sherlock who lets them melt on his tongue, because chewing apparently requires too much effort right now. John feels warm and comfortable and protective with a simmering undercurrent of low-level arousal, but more than anything he feels fiercely proud and grateful that he gets to have this, that Sherlock lets himself entirely lose control with him and then trusts John to take care of him after. He can’t imagine anything better.
And there it is again, reliable as clockwork when Irene’s name is mentioned: a flare of jealousy in John’s eyes, his muscles tensing. It’s so obvious now that Sherlock knows to look for it. How could have have missed it before?
Sherlock does his best to swallow as hot salty liquid hits the back of his throat but chokes despite his efforts. He lets go of John’s cock a little sooner than he would have liked to, stifling a cough, and he rests his head against John’s inner thigh, just for a while, just for a brief moment before John’s breathing quietens, while John is too high on endorphins to notice Sherlock taking comfort he has no right to.
John had to detach himself from Sherlock as he pulled his pants down, and his heated gaze on him made Sherlock suddenly feel exposed, his scarred, thin body, his flushed skin, chest with uneven patches of hair, his below-average cock… Unable to help himself, he turned to his side and curled up, hiding his groin from John’s view.
“Don’t” John tells him, and he gently pries Sherlock’s lip from between his teeth. “Don’t hold yourself back.”
He feels splayed open, laid bare, but for some reason it doesn’t make him feel vulnerable. The opposite, rather. He’s here, waiting for John’s verdict, waiting to hear whether John wants him or not, but he hasn’t given up control.
“Ah,” John says, like he’s been expecting Sherlock to bring it up at some point, and he looks down at his cup of tea.
“I mean – it’s completely fine with me if you want to wait, for whatever reason,” Sherlock hastens to add. “But I just wanted to ask if there’s anything about me you find… unappealing, or if there’s something I can do, or should do. I’d do anything you need me to.”
He showers and tries to focus on storing the latest case in his mind palace, not thinking about John and what he might want and what it might mean, and he certainly doesn’t think about why he’s suddenly decided it’s suitable to shave before bed, which had never been his habit.
to do was to boost John’s confidence by expressing his trust him, and at the same time set boundaries so that John wouldn’t have to worry Sherlock’s inaction would make him feel justified to continue doing things he didn’t want to do. But what he’s probably done instead is put all the responsibility more squarely on John’s shoulders.
This is the end of what Sherlock has been trying not to want for so long, then: John in a drunken stupor, asleep in his chair with his trousers open and his cock out, and Sherlock with a sore throat and tears prickling at the back of his eyes.
Sherlock spends a lot of time after his first session with her wondering what he really feels about John now, if he actually wants to see him again. The answers are less clear and less forthcoming than they were when he was far from London, far from John and everything was much less immediate and he didn’t know anything about John’s own feelings.
“Sorry, I’m fine,” Sherlock mumbles and tries to plaster a smile on his face. He doesn’t want Florian to feel bad or think he’s done something wrong when he’s been so good to Sherlock.
John grins at him. “You’re brilliant, do you know? I almost forgot about that. How about lube, then? We’ll
Fortunately, there is a seemingly ridiculous case involving an exclusive golf club reserved only for redheads, which finally proves interesting enough to distract them both from the tension between them. The case ends with a brief but rather fun chase across the golf course, then they have Chinese for dinner and when they come home, it feels like they’re back to normal.
John pressed a gentle kiss to his lips. “Just try to relax. Everything will be fine, we can stop at any time. If there’s anything you need, just tell me.”
It was a wrong thing to say – of course it was a wrong thing to say, there is no scenario where declaring his love for John Watson could possibly be the right thing to say – but it was wrong on a whole different level than Sherlock could have anticipated, Sherlock realises that more than clearly as he watches John’s reaction, panic and fear bubbling up in his stomach.  John’s not shocked or disgusted, as Sherlock expected – or more precisely, he
“Kiss me,” he said, and John did. Sherlock concentrated on kissing him the way John liked it, hoping the kiss would distract him from his nerves and prevent John from noticing. He pressed a hand to John’s groin to palm him through his boxers, and the way John hummed into his mouth at the sensation sent a thrill through him. John wanted him, desired him, and Sherlock could
Sherlock keens loudly, his voice not even human anymore as his hips cant off the bed in a desperate attempt to push his cock into John’s fist and impale himself further on John at the same time.
He barely makes it through the following day. His session with Dr Schneider helps and so does a run and spending an hour petting Minka, but none of it stops him from feeling absolutely terrible and even more lost than when he first came here. He has an appointment in the late afternoon with a hairdresser who comes in twice a week to cater to Haus Talblick residents, and he wants to cancel and curl up in bed instead or maybe lock himself in the music room with his violin, but in the end he makes himself go through it because his hair is starting to get really overgrown, for one, and he doesn’t want to succumb to the despair.
“Take it easy, don’t hurt yourself,” John tells him, and Sherlock slows down obediently, letting the slight burn dissipate. “How does that feel? Good?”
…? Never mind, what I mean to say is that what I read is one thing and how I want to live is another. I like to have sex once in a while – or several times a week, when I happen to have a beautiful insatiable neighbour --”
“If anything at all makes you uncomfortable, you tell me,” John says instead, in that impossible-to-resist, knee-melting voice. “This is non-negotiable. Whatever it is, I want to hear it. This rule overrides everything else. Is it clear?”
Sherlock could only moan in response. It did feel good – the sensitive underside of his cock slid against John’s skin deliciously and this way he had complete control over the intensity of the friction. He let his hips thrust forward in small movements that nevertheless sent powerful waves of pleasure through his body, one after another.
“You don’t have to keep apologising, I get that you didn’t mean to do that. But I need to know when things aren’t okay for you. I’d much rather stop than have you panicking.”
“Hey,” Florian says softly when Sherlock drops his key card. “I don’t have to go in if you don’t want me to. I had a great time today, but it’s fine if you don’t want anything more.”
Sherlock wants to protest, to point out that he’s perfectly capable of defending himself, but then he realises that he never
Sherlock’s pupils blow wide as John speaks, and he must know what John has in mind already – he knows that John is perfectly happy to have sex when neither of them has washed for two days, that there is really only one act John would require Sherlock to be clean for.
“I want you to fuck me,” Sherlock interrupts him, forcing the words out. Crude, but needs must. If he didn’t say it immediately, he’d chicken out again.
He finally stumbles into his room and collapses on the bed, shaking uncontrollably. He wishes he had never come here, never made this realisation. How is he supposed to live with this?
“John,” he breathes against John’s ear, a needy little sound, and John can feel his erection pressing to the small of his back. “Will you really—will you let me…?”
Taken all together, it’s just a few instances with relatively long periods of time between them, much less than what many people go through… but it’s enough to form a dark, terrifying,
“Molly’s cat is sick, so it’s me instead,” John says curtly, confirming Sherlock’s suspicion. “Why are you still in your pyjamas?”
, but if he’s to be in a relationship, with John in particular? That has to be safe. A place where he’s accepted and wanted. A safe haven. His home. A family – he and John and Rosie and Jack.
He pads to the kitchen as quickly as his worn out body lets him, but by the time he gets back Sherlock is shivering again and this time his eyes are wide with something like panic. John curses under his breath, berating himself for letting himself forget how out of it Sherlock can get after – how many orgasms exactly? – and how badly he needs John’s closeness afterwards.
“Lie on your front,” John told him and gently guided him to lie with his hips resting on a pillow, his legs spread wide. It was a bit disappointing – Sherlock had hoped they could do this face to face, he was sure he would feel calmer if he could hold on to John, but this was for John, and this way at least he was less likely to notice if Sherlock panicked.
John makes a pained little noise and kisses Sherlock, his lips firm but exquisitely gentle on Sherlock’s. Sherlock kisses back the best he knows how and it feels like drowning from the inside, like something long buried inside him is surging up, leaving him unmoored, drifting into a featureless landscape.
“Yes, we’d have to ask your Daddy if he agrees. But I’m sure he’d say yes because he loves you very much and he knows you’re a very smart young lady. Then we could do experiments together, wouldn’t that be fun?”
That, at least, is something he can understand. There is no need for his earlier confusion and panic anymore, and his mind is quiet and blank even as John forces his legs further apart and then pushes his upper body forward. Sherlock braces himself against the counter and stays still, not thinking about what’s going to happen, not anticipating, just… being. There is nothing else for him to do. He hears John’s laboured breathing, hears him unscrew the cap and let it clatter to the floor, the soft sound of thick liquid pouring through a narrow opening, the clang of the bottle being deposited on the counter next to his elbow. He keeps his gaze straight ahead, fixed on the line where the counter meets wall. There’s dust there, and crumbs, unidentifiable at this range but probably bread. He’s never given much attention to cleaning the kitchen aside from his scientific equipment, and Mrs Hudson can only do so much.
“There you go, that’s it,” John murmured to him. He kept one hand on Sherlock’s back and the other in his hear, enough to anchor him but not enough to overwhelm. Sherlock buried his face in John’s neck, moaning as he breathed him in and his hips stuttered forward with a little more fervour. “That’s right, you’re brilliant, I love you so much.”
Breath caught in Sherlock’s throat. He was so lucky. Here he was, with John Watson spread out under him, declaring he was
“Yeah, Sherlock,” John gasped, dragging his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, and his hips twitched on the mattress – Sherlock could tell he was restraining himself from thrusting up. Sherlock kissed down to John’s belly and nuzzled against it, enjoying the way its muscles rippled with each of John’s heavy breaths as Sherlock pulled his pants down, letting his erection spring free.
“John,” he begins on a Thursday afternoon, after they’ve returned from giving their statements at the Yard regarding a rather interesting locked-room murder, and are sitting at the kitchen table with cups of tea and biscuits. “There is a… matter I would like to discuss with you.”
And what would he even say to her? “Sorry, Molly, but could you please stay with Sherlock, he’s in a bad way because he had sex with a rent boy and that reminded him that who he actually wants to have sex with is—”
“Oh no. Rather the opposite. But she’s always been good at telling what people like, seemed safer to ask her rather than make my own judgement. It’s not really my area.”
into words is excruciating. It’s like reliving the whole ordeal all over again, but somehow even worse. Having to verbalise what John did and what Sherlock failed to do in response – stopping him – is worse than any sort of physical torture he endured in Serbia. He doesn’t realise he’s crying until Dr Schneider passes him a box of tissues.
Sherlock cries out at every thrust as he tugs at himself with rapid strokes, and John can’t take it anymore, his balls feel ready to burst. He drives into Sherlock hard and fast, the bed creaking with every slap of skin against skin.
He feels strangely empty when Robert pulls the toy out, and the prospect of being filled again is as appealing as it is terrifying. He eyes Robert’s cock, flushed and hard and huge in its nest of greying curls, and gulps.
After this conversation, Sherlock realises that he’s been stalling. He’s been focusing on the little bits of joy and contentment he’s managed to carve out for himself, dogs and bees, music and sex and every type of sweet baked goods available from Maggie’s shop, and it’s served him well, helped him feel more at ease in himself, in his body and in his life, but he’s long passed the point when it became routine, a pretext for not thinking about moving forward. It’s been good and helpful, this little respite, but it has to end. He can’t live the rest of his life like this just because it allows him the illusion that back in London, John Watson has turned back into the person Sherlock used to know and love. He’s been gone for four months – it’s time. He’s not ready to go back and definitely not ready to confront John, but like with the sex, this is as ready as he’ll ever be. He’s standing on his own feet now, he hasn’t had a craving for anything worse than sugar and caffeine in weeks, he’s secure in the knowledge that he
“No,” Molly says and suddenly looks extremely uncomfortable. “He’s… gone away, John. I don’t know where, but he left in a hurry and I don’t think he’ll be back anytime soon, because he asked me to dispose of any body parts he had in the fridge.” She gestures to a large travel cooler at her feet, her face pinched as if in pain.
that level of intimacy, to give himself to John so fully. And besides, he’s fairly sure that John’s worries about hurting Sherlock during sex had more to do with penetrative intercourse than anything they did last night, and Sherlock would like to fully assuage his fears as soon as possible. After how careful and tender John was with him last night, Sherlock doesn’t think there’s any reason for concern… he doesn’t even feel nervous. John will take care of him.
“Nothing on today, there was no point getting dressed,” he says and ducks his head, looking at the floor.
Sherlock never told her he’s gay, but it doesn’t surprise him that she’s guessed  Her shop is the only place in the village where he can get tea and scones or soup and a sandwich or even just a decent cup of coffee without making it himself (the local pub is only good for chips) so he ends up there quite often, plus they see each other at the shelter too. She’s quite observant, and it’s not like Sherlock’s been trying to hide it – he’s been looking at men quite openly. He’s always looked, of course, it’s what he does, but it’s different now. Before, men were just people and people were just variables. Now, it’s a kind of experiment on himself. He looks at each and every man he meets carefully, assesses his features and observes his own reactions to them. What he likes, what he dislikes, what he finds appealing, what puts him off.
Sherlock felt like he should object to being called adorable, but couldn’t really muster enough determination to say anything, not with John looking at him like that.
The thing is – it all feels a little bit like a date. It’s not, of course, and it’s probably just Sherlock’s lack of personal experience with the concept that makes him think that. But the truth is that they don’t usually make plans in advance to go out and spend time together – there are cases and spur-of-the-moment decisions, that’s all. They don’t gift each other expensive ballet tickets. John doesn’t come to pick Sherlock up, wearing a midnight blue suit (off the rack, but a reasonably good fit) that brings out his eyes, a whiff of cologne, his hair neatly combed. It’s… strange. But Sherlock tries not to pick at it, not to try deducing what’s behind it. He wants to enjoy this evening with John – a rare opportunity with neither a case nor Rosie. It feels too precious to ruin it by examining it like a piece of evidence.
It was perfect: utterly beautiful. Sherlock made a loose fist around John’s girth and stroked up and down tentatively. John hummed in appreciation and Sherlock tightened his grip and made his strokes firmer. He felt his focus sharpening, the world around fading away until all that was left was John’s flesh in his hand and John’s sighs of appreciation: “Fuck, Sherlock, you feel so good, so good, yeah…”
“I’d… I’d like to avoid any kind of penetration for now,” he said eventually, because that was clear. There was something deeply intimate about having a part John inside him, and he craved that level of intimacy but also knew he wasn’t quite ready for it yet. “It’s not that it’s unappealing, just… too intense.”
“It’s not that,” Sherlock said as he sat up and turned to look at John. “I just need to brush my teeth so that I can kiss you.” John looked so adorably sleep-rumpled that Sherlock almost regretted his decision, but needs must.
Sherlock looks at John’s distressed face, trying to come up with something to say that would alleviate John’s worries. Saying that he’s sure nothing like that will happen would just sound like a dismissal of John’s concerns, and he can’t, in good conscience, promise that he’d be able to stop John. He takes John’s hand in both of his and gently strokes John’s skin with his thumb as he thinks.
She shrugs one shoulder, smiling at him infuriatingly. “True, although I still had doubts whether you’d actually show up. But that’s not what I meant.” Her gaze drops to his throat. “I was referring to the fact that you either need to keep your scarf on, or invest in some better quality make-up.” She smirks at him, and Sherlock freezes as he vividly remembers Patrick’s lips latching onto his pulse point last night. He covered it up, but the make-up he stole from Mrs Hudson must have rubbed off on his collar. It takes all of his willpower not to touch the spot that suddenly seems to be burning and try to hide it, and he immediately loses some of his confidence.
“God, look at you,” John breathes hotly over Sherlock’s open lips. “So gorgeous, so responsive, I can’t get enough of you.”
Sherlock’s voice is hoarse by now, John’s name never leaving his lips as he rams his cock in at a brutal pace, the bed creaking under them and it feels like the entire world is shaking with the intensity of Sherlock’s thrusts.
“Did you see a client like that?” It wouldn’t be the first time Sherlock didn’t think getting dressed was necessary, but still. Sherlock’s level of personal grooming is often indicative of his state of mind. He’s clearly just had shower, but he doesn’t seem to have bothered to put on anything more than the dressing gown.
Something flickers in Molly’s eyes, but she nods. “That’s okay. I just – want you to know I’m here if you change your mind.”
“You obviously didn’t want us to know, we didn’t want to force it,” Sam says. “But maybe we should have told you, I’m sorry.”
John’s slick index finger pressed against the tight ring of muscle, teasing it lightly, and Sherlock’s entire body shuddered. He wanted it, he did, but it was so utterly overwhelming. He clutched the pillow tighter. For John. If John was with a woman, he wouldn’t have to go through this waste of time at all, so the least Sherlock could do was try not to make it last longer than necessary. He forced his pelvic muscles to relax.
“I’m wrong?” she repeats and for the first time she looks less than completely on top of everything. “This isn’t Dr Watson’s handiwork?” she asks, gesturing to Sherlock’s neck. It seems like the mere idea is beyond her comprehension.
When Robert withdraws his fingers Sherlock almost groans at the loss even as his nerves comes back full force – it’s clear what the next step is now. But he’s wrong, because the next thing he knows, Robert’s holding a prostate massager in his hand, slightly bigger than the one Sherlock owns.
It’s not like the thought’ has never occurred before, but it was always easy to push it way. Sherlock was dead. Then he wasn’t dead but John was getting married, and then John was married, and then his wife was dead and he was grieving. It was always easy to look the other way and not to examine the suspicion (and more than suspicion) that his feelings for Sherlock might not be entirely platonic.
The next morning brought a case of stolen gemstones. It was barely a six, but Sherlock found it a welcome change after the emotional strain of the previous days, and it felt extremely good to feel confident and in control again. John looked at him with love and admiration in his eyes, and it boosted Sherlock’s self-confidence like nothing else.
“That’s all right, keep your secrets.” She slides another scone on Sherlock’s plate even though he didn’t ask for it.
“I love you,” Sherlock whispers as he wraps his arms and legs around John. That’s an added bonus of Sherlock’s bouts of intense sexual need: he’s so out of his mind with want he lets things like that slip out much more easily than usual. “I love you.”
Sherlock nods. He doesn’t know if it’s the answer John wants, but he can’t possibly lie about this – he loves it.
“Love you,” John murmurs against Sherlock’s sweaty neck. Sherlock only hums in response, apparently too exhausted for anything more at the moment. But it’s only temporary, John knows. Sherlock will only need a while to recover his strength, and the night is still young.
he protests. “Kindness heals, John,” he murmurs, aware that he sounds like a cheap self-help book and not caring. “Letting others be kind to you and being kind to them in turn. Being kind to yourself. It saved me. I want to forgive you and be kind to you, and I would like the same from you.”
“That’s it,” John encourages him, pressing his foot harder against Sherlock’s erection, firm and hot and doubtless leaking copiously into his underwear by now. “Go on, get yourself off.”
“Oh,” is all he manages to say, feeling like he’s being crushed into powder by the shame weighing on his houlders. He can’t bear to look at Molly’s kind face, to stay here a second longer with someone who believes him to be Sherlock’s
Unable to wait any longer, John licks broadly from Sherlock’s perineum all the way up to his tailbone. Sherlock’s answering sigh is one of relief.
, he’s managed to land squarely in the other end of the pool. He never even considered that this could be wanted of him (stupid,
“I’m – trying to kiss you,” John says, his eyes tracking over Sherlock’s face. “But… perhaps I should ask first if it’s okay.”
“Do you want to be on your hands and knees? I think that’s easiest,” Robert suggests, stroking Sherlock’s hip in a soothing manner.
“I wanted some company and I… ended up here,” Sherlock says lamely. “I know I shouldn’t have, I should’ve texted at least…”
He’s so hard he’s leaking and his balls feel ready to burst; it’s driving him mad yet he knows he can’t touch himself, not with John there to see, but then suddenly he
“Oh, love,” John said, squeezing Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock kept his eyes resolutely down. “Nobody’s perfect the first time around – and I don’t just mean the first time ever, but the first time with a new partner. There’s a learning curve, but you’re the fastest learner I know. And… well. You know I’ve never been with a man before, so it’s new for me too.” He cleared his throat – clearly he wasn’t very comfortable with the topic either. “But we’ll muddle through together, we always do.”
“Hey, what’s wrong?” Florian asks with a small frown. Sherlock’s feelings must be showing on his face. “Are you all right?”
Perhaps a bit too much information, Sherlock thinks once the words are out of his mouth and John looks like his eyes are going to pop out of his head. Sherlock supposes he can’t blame him – after all, this is quite a big change from Sherlock’s years of celibacy.
The change of topic catches Sherlock off guard. His throat constricts, but he forces himself to speak. This is another thing they’d have to discuss at some point anyway. “Yes,” he says simply, because it’s the truth.  “All I ever did after I came back… was just a way to try to make up for all the pain I’d caused you. In a way, I was glad when you…” he lets John fill in the bits he’s unable to articulate, “because I felt like if only you hurt me enough, then we’d be even and I’d have… done my penance. Earned your forgiveness.” It’s unbearable, thinking about what he felt then, what he believed, especially when he knows these feelings aren’t all that far away. He blinks back tears.
It’s unexpected, but Sherlock’s happy to go along with it. He’s ready to do anything to make up for his failure – until John’s hand moves between Sherlock’s legs and squeezes.
“Yes, that’s it, touch yourself, make yourself feel good,” Robert encourages him, his voice strained with the effort of keeping his movements in check. He can’t be too comfortable, but Sherlock will make it up to him later. For now, he wraps his fingers around his straining cock and begins stroking himself with long, firm pulls, his back arching at the increase in pleasure, the dual stimulation pushing long, shuddering gasps out of his lungs.
Sherlock, however, waits barely long enough to get his breath back before he finds the – now nearly empty – bottle of lube.
by John so intensely that he won’t mind some hair-pulling or being called a cock slut. He couldn’t take from other men, which was what led him to his twelve-year-old period of celibacy, but John is different. Sherlock is sure it will be fine.
He needs to leave. He needs to go somewhere where a fix will be further away than a text to the right number. His last relapse wreaked havoc on him and he can’t let that happen, he doesn’t
“Yes, I do,” Sherlock said firmly, a little annoyed that he had to repeat it again. “But it’s… difficult for me.”
“Are you sure?” he asks. He wants to fuck Sherlock badly, but Sherlock’s bound to be oversensitive now and John couldn’t bear to cause him discomfort. Besides, he’s so turned on that just humping Sherlock’s hip is sure to cause a spectacular orgasm. “You don’t have to—“
He’s been experimenting on his own ever since Bristol, first with his fingers, then a slim beginner’s prostate massager he’s purchased. The beginnings were not bad, strictly speaking, but uncomfortable and made him feel awkward and embarrassed even though he was alone and no one would ever know how long he spent with just the tip of his little finger inside of himself, breathing fast and shallow. He was impatient and annoyed at his inability to just relax and do it, but he forced himself to give himself time, and eventually he got the hang of it and started to really enjoy himself and even progressed to a slightly larger toy. Prostate stimulation feels extremely good, he’s discovered, and even just having something inside of him, the stretch and fullness, is quite pleasurable with sufficient preparation and lubrication. He’s determined to experience it with a partner: normal, good sex, enjoyable for both parties. Or perhaps not even good – it may be awkward and messy and not entirely satisfying, but it will be safe and fully consensual and done out of mutual attraction and desire. He wants that. He
He pushes his hands underneath Sherlock’s shoulders and lowers himself down on his forearms carefully, until they are flush chest to chest, and Sherlock wraps his arms tighter around John’s back. This is perfect, they’re so close, closer than close. His mouth seeks out John’s and they kiss, hungry and messy, Sherlock opening his mouth wide and inviting John’s tongue in. John’s tongue in his mouth and John’s cock in his arse – just that knowledge is almost unbearably intense. He’s John’s, John has claimed him, he is completely, utterly John’s.
“It might feel a bit uncomfortable at first,” John said as he stroked Sherlock’s hip with one hand and the fingers of the other slipped between Sherlock’s arse cheeks, coated in cool lubricant, “but I promise I won’t hurt you. Just try to relax for me.”
“Sherlock, love, d’you need me to be on top…?” John offers, because he doesn’t think Sherlock can keep it up for much longer, but Sherlock shakes his head vehemently.
. John has barely a third of Sherlock’s cock in his mouth but even that is almost too much - the slick wet heat, John’s tongue and lips, licking and
“Fuck, Sherlock,” John panted, stilling Sherlock hips and putting way too much distance between their straining erections. “You’re gonna make me come in my pants like a teenager.”
, I promise you,” Sherlock says beseechingly, because the worst thing that could come out of this mess would be John blaming himself for anything – the point of the whole thing was to make him feel
And it didn’t really help that having had John’s erection pressed against his thigh or belly several times now, he had had to conclude that his previous guesstimates of John’s penis size when flaccid had entirely failed to predict how
were phenomenal,” John counters, as if lying on his back and letting himself be driven out of his mind with pleasure required some sort of special skill or effort from Sherlock.
“John,” Sherlock said hesitantly, not really sure what he wanted say. He hated John blaming himself, but he knew it was true that their sexual attempts would probably have gone better if penetration hadn’t been part of them.
“I’m fine,” Sherlock says quickly. It’s true, really – all through the proceedings he’s only been half-erect at best, his nerves and discomfort stifling any arousal he might otherwise have felt.
“By the way, when I stopped by the morgue, Molly was completely unfocused because apparently you gave her a spa weekend for her birthday. She couldn’t talk about anything else.”
. It’s not a thing John would say lightly – but it can’t be true, how could it be true? He can almost feel his brain grind to a halt at the cognitive dissonance of it.
, this way John’s thigh came right under Sherlock’s groin, his cock pressing into John’s skin. He gasped and lifted his pelvis a little to alleviate the pressure.
Maybe they could have this: have sex when John wants to, and just go on as always in the morning, as if nothing had happened. It’s not exactly what Sherlock would have liked, but what he would like is not the point. He’ll take anything John gives him, and this is more than he would ever have expected. It would only be temporary, of course. Just until John gets over Mary’s death properly and is able to begin a new relationship. Now he’s probably just feeling lonely, but too vulnerable still to look for someone new, and maybe that would still feel like infidelity to him – but Sherlock’s a friend, and a man, so he doesn’t count. Maybe that could work.
That’s all he does, though – looking. He could approach them, flirt, find out if the first stir of attraction could lead anywhere, but he doesn’t want to. He doesn’t need to. He’s been having semi-regular sex since shortly after he arrived to the village, and he feels no need to search for other partners.
Sherlock… just stands there. There’s sincerity written in every line of John’s face, but what he says does not align with what Sherlock knows to be true.
Then John’s hand that isn’t maintaining a firm grip on Sherlock’s hair drops down between their bodies and cups Sherlock through the thin fabric of his pyjama bottoms, squeezing roughly just when John’s lips leave Sherlock’s mouth and attach themselves instead to the side of his neck, and Sherlock’s whimpering yelp has nothing to be muffled against. His whole body’s shuddering uncontrollably, it’s too much too fast and it’s wrong, it’s wrong, John’s not gay and he wants neither Sherlock’s love nor his body, so why is he palming Sherlock’s erection through flimsy cotton, here in the kitchen moments after telling him he didn’t know what love was? It makes no sense, it makes no sense, it’s wrong and John will hate himself
He covers John with a blanket and places the Union Jack cushion under his head, then retreats to the bathroom to brush his teeth and wash away at the bitter taste of ejaculate. There is a chance that John won’t remember anything in the morning, but it’s a small one.
By the time John’s mouth returns to Sherlock’s hole after the third break, Sherlock’s moans are almost continuous, his mouth is hanging open in a desperate effort to get enough air into his lungs and there is a sheen of sweat covering his body. John knows it’s not going to take long now, and the knowledge makes him lap at Sherlock with more vigour than ever, thrusting his tongue inside him as hard and deep as it will go.
“Uh, I have a hand lotion?” he says, feeling himself blush at what must be an obvious giveaway of his inexperience.
“Since when?” Sherlock asks. He can’t believe this – they’ve known who he is all this time and he never realised?
That night, Sherlock dreams he’s tied up in a dungeon in Serbia, moaning in pain as a whip falls onto his raw back again and again while another man’s combat boots repeatedly hit his ribs and stomach. When he looks up at his torturer, he sees he has John’s face.
Sherlock’s knees go weak at that but pinned as he is between the counter and John’s body he has nowhere to fall and the shift of his weight only serves to align his hips with John’s. John groans and begins kissing Sherlock even more forcefully, pulling his head down by his hair for better access, and he rocks his pelvis forward, rubbing his clothed erection against Sherlock, who is by no means soft himself at this point, despite the bewilderment he’s still feeling. His head is spinning with it, guilt and fear and arousal and panic, he doesn’t understand but he yields to the onslaught like he would to the punches. He’s dreamt about this, after all (well, not
They stay quiet for a while, just breathing together, and for the first time that night Sherlock starts feeling like the world around him is real. Here he is, in John’s arms, sweat drying on his skin after what he thinks might actually be called love-making, John peppering kisses all over his face, and it’s real.
In the end, Sherlock asks Mrs Hudson to watch Rosie overnight - John protests that he can’t keep imposing on her like this and that wanting to have sex is certainly not a good enough reason, but he gives in quickly, clearly just as impatient as Sherlock. Mrs Hudson is have Rosie spend the night with her, and the pleased look she gives Sherlock makes it more than clear that she has no doubt about why exactly John will be spending the night – and that she approves.
John pulls away a little, just enough to be able to see Sherlock’s face, and he touches his chin, making him look at him.
“I,” Sherlock hesitates, unwilling to say anything that might make John reconsider his intentions, but at the same time needing to be honest. “Sexual activity involves more strong physical stimuli than I am able to adequately process while retaining enough capacity to act on them.”
“No,” John breathes, taking a step back from Sherlock. He looks suddenly panicked. “No! This is why I didn’t tell you, because now you feel like you’re obligated to forgive me but you’re not, you’re not and you shouldn’t, I don’t deserve ---”
He deduces things about some of those people and shares them with John if they’re interesting – and if there’s nothing interesting, he makes something up to make John laugh. John can mostly tell these days when Sherlock’s fibbing, but he laughs anyway, and that’s all that matters. They buy ice cream and sit on a bench to it (in peace, thankfully, as Rosie has fallen asleep in her pushchair) and he tells John about the case he solved the day before yesterday - a rather gruesome affair involving a pair of human ears mailed to an unsuspecting widow.
. Sherlock felt warm all over. He knew John loved him – John found talking about feelings so difficult that when he did there could be no doubt he meant it – but hearing him say it like that, along with assurances that Sherlock was enough the way he was… it was almost too much.
Sherlock slumps in his chair and John removes his foot carefully:  he’s so hard it feels like the slightest movement could set him off.
“Sherlock, look at me.” John said, and Sherlock forced himself to lift his head. John’s face was sad but earnest and brimming with so much love and affection it almost stopped Sherlock’s heart “You can. You can and you
He did it quickly, ignoring any discomfort he felt. His fingers were larger than John’s and having two of them inside him already made him feel uncomfortably full, but he forced himself to accept a third – John would be much wider. He wasn’t nearly as thorough as John would have been and he knew it would probably hurt when John entered him, but that didn’t matter: he had to be quick and efficient now, not give himself time to think about it too much and lose his nerve.
John presses his lips to Sherlock’s forehead once, twice, three times, sending a shiver down Sherlock’s spine.
They kiss languidly, and John presses himself against Sherlock’s masculine body like he wants to be there, he buries his face in Sherlock’s neck and breathes in the smell of his sweat that Sherlock hasn’t had time to wash away, and finally, Sherlock allows himself to do what he’s wanted to do for so long: he wraps his arms around John, and holds him. John lets himself be pulled close, his hands stoking up and down Sherlock’s back, first through his shirt, then under it.
John makes a low guttural sound and kisses Sherlock again, this time with a hunger that feels insatiable, thrusting his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth like it belongs to him – which it does, oh, it
He all but threw himself at John, needing desperately to be close, to be held, to bask in the reassurance that he wasn’t, after all, a complete failure. John staggered a little under Sherlock’s weight but he accepted him into his arms readily, shifting a bit so that he could lean against the backrest and pull Sherlock against his chest.
John lets the used wipes fall on the floor and cuddles up close to Sherlock. Sherlock’s hand are back on him immediately – how could he ever want to stop touching him?
Robert’s not someone who enjoys making other people embarrassed, so he says nothing, just kisses Sherlock very gently and pushes in a little deeper. Then there’s a long moment where they stay still and quiet, just breathing, being, waiting for Sherlock’s body to relax around the intrusion, for the incredible fullness to subside and melt into a need for more.
fuck, do that again, you marvel,” John can’t seem to stop talking, a string of profanities, moans and praise for Sherlock, but never anything Sherlock would rather not hear. He sucks harder. “Fuck yes! Keep doing that, Sherlock—
Robert stared at him some more, then took a cautious step forward and cupped Sherlock’s cheek. Sherlock’s heart thumped hard and his breath caught, but that didn’t surprise him at all anymore – he already knew he had ridiculously strong reactions to the simplest gestures of gentleness. And then Robert leaned down and kissed him, and that was it.
Once Sherlock had closed himself in the bathroom, he turned on all the taps on full to hide any noise he might make. The fact that John knew he was fingering himself was disconcerting enough – if he
to take care of yourself when all your friends go to considerable trouble every day for the sake of your health and well-being.”
It can never happen. Even if they somehow manage to reestablish their old level of trust and friendship, nothing has changed about the fact that John doesn’t want him like that. They might be able to hug one day, but that’s it. Everything else Sherlock will have to look for elsewhere, and that will have to be enough.
Immediately, John’s posture relaxes. He glances at Sherlock and scratches the back of his neck awkwardly. “Oh.”
“Yes,” Florian agrees, but when Sherlock turns his head to him he’s not looking at the falls or the view of the valley, but at Sherlock. He cups Sherlock’s cheek in one hand and Sherlock grips the railing tighter, afraid his knees might buckle at the tenderness of such a simple gesture.
, and he sits down slowly, gingerly, as if expecting Sherlock to shout at him that he has no right to sit in that chair anymore.
,” he curses, and it’s clear that this time it’s not in pain. The slim hope Sherlock had that John might not remember vanishes. He’ll have to face it, then, and he’s decided to do it now, when John’s weakened by the hangover and less likely to shout.
They lie facing each other, and John puts his hand in Sherlock’s hair the way Sherlock likes, his touch feather-light.
mean that you were in any way to blame, okay? You weren’t, it was my fault. So I’m just trying to make sure that I don’t accidentally – miss a step I need to take. I need to be sure that there isn’t anything left of that… of that monster in me.”
Then suddenly John stops kissing him and his hand disappears from Sherlock’s crotch, and Sherlock has a split second to be simultaneously relieved and disappointed, then John thrusts a bottle of olive oil in front of Sherlock’s face, so close Sherlock has to lean his head back to see it properly.
’ as Sherlock refers to it in his head). He knows that Dr Schneider has already managed to deduce a lot, he knows there’s no point in lying or hiding, but putting
“Fuck!” John swears, and despite his exhaustion he has to fight the urge to buck up. “Oh god, Sherlock.”
That’s what he usually does. But now that he knows that Sherlock’s available to him… he might make different plans.
He goes to his bedroom to get dressed. A part of him wishes to put on a crisp shirt, well-pressed trousers, a perfectly fitted jacket – now that John
it is. He assumed he’d have to endure this part, suffer through it before he could start enjoying it, but it turns out there’s nothing to be endured. It’s not pleasurable or even just comfortable and he’s lost his erection, but that’s no different from the first few times he tried pushing his little finger in. It’s fine. He’s fine.
“Yes.” Sherlock stands there looking at John, considering. He didn’t expect this. He didn’t expect to play this particular piece, and he didn’t expect John to come early enough to hear it, but now… Maybe it’s an opportunity he should use. “We were lovers,” he says before he can think better of it. He’s not sure why he’s telling John. To show John he’s not broken and capable of sexual relationships like anyone else, to see if John cares, see how he’ll react? All of the above, probably.
“What about your… um. The guy you’ve been seeing?” John asks when they separate a little, staying close to each other.
“That was – the hottest thing – that I’ve ever done,” John says between kisses. Sherlock barely manages to smile in response, he feels so wrung out, but he tries to pull himself together quickly – John is obviously very, very hard and Sherlock absolutely needs to do something about that. “I was worried I might be a bit rubbish at it, but it didn’t
“Could I see Rosie sometime?” Sherlock asks. It seems like the only possible way to maintain a tenuous link to John under the circumstances.
Sherlock doesn’t stay the night. He wouldn’t mind helping Terry make his flatmate jealous, but the idea of literally
those words combined with that look made Sherlock’s entire body flush and his knees go weak. He caught John’s mouth with his again, kissing him hard, eager to earn John’s praise again.
“Fuck, you’re so hot like this, d’you know?” John says as he wraps one arm around Sherlock’s chest and starts tugging at his cock. “So hot.” Sherlock lets out gasps and moans as his hips move frantically, grinding down against the toy, thrusting up inside John’s fist.
“What? Sherlock, that makes no sense. I don’t know what you think it is that no one would do for you for free but I can guarantee you it’s not true. Someone who loved you would care about what you like, they’d
“Yes. So Sam came up with this system where every act was a different city, and then he’d just ask me where I wanted to go,” Patrick grins at Sam with so much love in his eyes it takes Sherlock’s breath away.
“Thank you, too, John,” Sherlock says when he sits down next to him. It comes out a little stiff, but he wants to say it. “It’s been a nice evening.”
“Would you like us to take care of you?” he asks softly. Sherlock’s breath leaves him in a rush of relief.
Sherlock feels John shift behind him, feels a hand grip his hip like a vice, feels something slick and hot and
“I know it would be easier if I was… normal,” he says, and John’s heart twists. He knows there are still insecurities lodged deep within Sherlock’s soul, that he still worries he won’t be good enough for John. He’s gotten much better at accepting John’s love than he was at the beginning, but John knows that there’s still a long way to go.
Sherlock sits up straighter in his chair, his eyes boring into John’s. It’s time. “I had brunch with Irene this morning.”
Somehow, that makes John look even more miserable. Sherlock doesn’t understand where this is coming from. Is it some sort of misplaced sense of guilt for not returning Sherlock’s feelings? That’s absurd.
The conversation makes less and less sense the longer it goes on. John stares at him with wide eyes, and Sherlock says nothing, suddenly wrong-footed. He hesitates, unsure what to say.
John sighs, and nods his head. “Yeah, I know you would.” It doesn’t sound like it makes him particularly happy, however. He looks up and takes hold of Sherlock’s hand.
, and Sherlock can see now he was lucky that he got away with no worse after-effects than a few painful bowel movements. And throughout all of that, Sherlock did nothing. He was, in some messed-up way,
Somehow, he feels better having done that, having a place to go, a sort of purpose. He gets dressed, packs a suitcase. He makes a cup of tea and eats a Greek yoghurt with honey (he should probably stick to a soft diet for a few days; he’d rather not eat anything at all, really, but at least this way no one can accuse him of
From the top of the falls they walk down the other side to a narrow ledge that leads them close to the thunderous stream of falling water, tiny droplets hitting their faces when the wind blows their way. Sherlock looks over the railing and down the dizzying depth of the chasm. The endlessly moving but unchanging torrent together with the way the roar of water blocks out any other sounds create an illusion of a moment frozen out of time. Sherlock feels like he could stay here forever, in this strange sort of turbulent calm, and the rest of the world would stand still, that he could stand here until he felt like himself again, until he could face his life again… or until he decided to climb over the railing and jump.
“I can’t,” he mumbled into the darkness between his thighs and chest, and wasn’t it symbolic that this was he was talking to his limp penis?
The case took two days and there wasn’t much time to focus on anything else, but there was a strange new undercurrent between them now, the knowledge that soon, soon, they would make love. Sherlock certainly wasn’t planning on waiting, even though he knew he could. He wanted to give John what he deserved.
Sherlock jerks his head back fast enough to nearly give himself whiplash, a sudden flood of panic rising in his chest.
Robert nods, bites his lip. “I just want you to know that… if anything. Happened. I’ll come and punch him in the face.”
Afterwards, John insists they eat something. At first, Sherlock seems happy with that, sipping his tea at the kitchen table and recuperating as he watches John busying himself at the stove. When John puts a plate of scrambled eggs on toast in front of him he tucks in willingly enough, but he’s only eaten a few mouthfuls when John feels Sherlock’s bare toe stroking his ankle and calf under the table.
. He could do this: soft, sleepy rocking beneath the covers, with John kissing his neck and letting out little pleased hums and sighs. He was hard now but not insistently so, and he could easily ignore it in favour of focusing on how John’s body felt against his.
Sam and Patrick touch him with gentle hands and lips and tongues, careful and almost reverent, and Sherlock soon loses track of who is where and doing what. The only thing that matters is that he’s safe, with people who care about him enough to do this for him, give him the best approximation of what it feels like to be loved and cherished. He lets himself succumb to their gentle ministrations as he’s guided to the bedroom and spread out on the bed and every single inch of him is kissed and stroked and caressed. Eventually he ends up on his front, getting a sorely-needed back massage that lulls him into a strange state between sleepiness and arousal, and then whoever isn’t loosening his trapezius muscles trickles massage oil down his crack and starts fingering him open in the most teasing way imaginable, until Sherlock is trembling with want and humping the sheets. Then Patrick gathers him in his arms and Sam settles between Sherlock’s legs, swallowing him to the root while pushing two fingers inside, and its bliss.
“Oh, god, yes,” John said and got up. “Are you sure, though?” he asked as he walked to Sherlock and cupped his face in his palms.
Sherlock thinks fast, or perhaps he doesn’t think at all. He doesn’t know which act exactly John has in mind, but the general gist is clear: he wants sex, he wants it now, and he wants it from Sherlock (technically: he wants it from the only person currently available. Better not worry about details.) Obstacle: Sherlock’s undeniable maleness – an obvious reminder that he’s Sherlock, not Mary come back from the dead, or any other person John might conceivably want. There’s only one solution.
John will think it’s a case, but so what. They need to talk about this – Sherlock needs to know if he’s right, and if he is, he wants to hear John say the words.
John’s cock was huge, yes, but it seemed to fit perfectly into Sherlock’s hand. It was hot and hard and smooth and it meant John wanted him, he wanted Sherlock, and Sherlock couldn’t possibly not give John what he wanted.
That worries John. Sherlock seemed fine the last time John saw him, so he doesn’t think it’s drugs again, but he still climbs the stairs with a sense of trepidation.
but his mind balks at such an interpretation. Thinking about himself and John in such terms doesn’t seem right at all. John just chose a wrong way to express his entirely justified anger at Sherlock, that’s all there is, it must be.
“I don’t find it easy to say these things,” John continues, stepping closer to Sherlock. “But I should have told you at the start. I love you. I thought you must have… deduced that.”
He thinks about giving another chance to the dating app he downloaded a few weeks ago. He’s used it for two hookups so far – he slept with the first man but not with the second, whose level of personal hygiene turned out to be quite alarming at close range and it’s rather put Sherlock off trying to meet random people off the internet. He twiddles with his phone in his hand, considering his options. He’s not in the mood for a quick fuck with a stranger, that’s clear, but he’s not sure Patrick and Sam can give him what he wants, either. He remembers the first time he let Robert penetrate him. He was so caring and gentle and focused entirely on Sherlock. That’s what he needs right now. He wants to be made love to. And if that’s not possible, then at least something soft, gentle. And Patrick and Sam… they see Sherlock to have fun, not to care for him. They always make sure Sherlock enjoys himself and they’ve proved themselves to be very willing to accommodate Sherlock’s wishes, but what Sherlock wants now seems so much more…
Sherlock feels a shiver run down his spine. He isn’t even sure it’s flirting and not just run-of-the-mill hairdresser small talk, but it feels so good, and combined with Florian’s fingers on his scalp, it’s heavenly.
“Okay. But you can kiss me anyway, just so you know,” John said with an arched eyebrow, and then stretched languidly, as if to say
Sherlock has always known John is a very sexual man, but he never suspected how much. It’s so easy to turn John into a wanton, lust-driven creature: just tease his nipples with tongue and lips and fingers, stroke his cock through his pants, and John is writhing in pleasure under him, making delightful little noises that should by all rights be ridiculous but are in fact incredibly arousing, and make Sherlock fiercely proud that he’s the one who caused them.
Sherlock nods, unable to look away from John’s eyes now. His lovely, kind John – of course he doesn’t want to do anything that would hurt Sherlock. But it’s impossible – in Sherlock’s experience –it’s foolish to expect someone to exercise control without at the very least verbally degrading the person in their power, without at least some rough treatment. The knowledge that John wants to try is enough, though, even if it can’t work. He wants to be claimed,
Once they stood up, John straightened Sherlock’s dressing gown, tightening it around his waist. Sherlock felt foolish, essentially getting dressed by John, but also…
“You said his name,” Robert says, lowering his gaze as if he were the one with a reason to be ashamed. “A couple of times. While we were – you know.”
He settles between Sherlock’s legs, running his hands up and down Sherlock’s sides before finally bringing them to stoke his luscious arse.
Making a decision, he finishes his tea, says goodbye to Maggie and goes home where he takes a very, very thorough shower and then he marches over to Robert’s before he can lose his nerve.
“Okay,” he says again. “Whatever you want. You don’t mind if I take off mine, do you?” he adds with a cheeky grin and pulls his t-shirt over his head, showing off his hairless, toned chest. Sherlock runs his hands down Florian’s smooth pectorals and he suddenly feels profoundly, viscerally
“So,” Irene smiles dangerously once the waiter has gone, leaning forward a little. “That’s why you’ve finally deigned to meet me, is it? I’ve been wondering.”
“You look better than the last time I saw you,” he says lightly, trying to pretend that this isn’t one of the most significant conversations they’ve ever had.
“I don’t deserve you,” John whispers. “But I think I would be an even bigger idiot than usual if I didn’t take this chance. If you really want to give it. But we – we have to do everything you said, the therapy and everything, and we have to start that before we move forward, okay? So we’ll… still be just friends for now, and see if it works, and then if it does and we’re in a good place, we can… be something more.”
Sherlock nods, grateful that John suggested Molly rather than himself. “Yes. That would be… acceptable.”
His mind palace was quiet and calm. Redbeard ran to him and licked his face and Sherlock’s heartbeat slowed as he took a deep, steady breath.
Sherlock opens his eyes at that to look at John, and the open adoration and joy on John’s face send a different kind of pleasure through him.
“Patrick!” Sam shouts in the direction of the kitchen. “Christmas’s come early and it looks like we’ve been
“John,” he means to say, but what comes out is more a sob than a word. He knows, rationally, that he should be happy, and on some deep level he
“Morning,” he grins at Sherlock, and it stuns Sherlock into silence. He’d been preparing himself for another round of painful awkwardness, but this is not it. This is—just John. “I’m making a fry-up, and you’re going to have some,” he announces, and he sounds—okay.  Happy, almost. “No excuses.”
John clears his throat. He moves to stand by the kitchen counter on Sherlock’s right-hand side, less than two feet away from him. Sherlock tries not to tense as he searches for a saucepan.
“Mmm, morning,” John murmured against his nape, pulling Sherlock in even closer. Sherlock could tell the exact moment John realised what state he was in – he tensed, and immediately started to pull away.
Sherlock lets go of John chest and straightens, taking hold of John’s hips instead. John can feel him pull out almost completely and then push in, hard, with a deep growl.
The words are out of Sherlock’s mouth before he can think about them. The sudden silence rings loud in the flat, interrupted only by John’s sharp intake of breath as he stares at Sherlock, his nostrils flaring.
“Now you,” he says with a sense of purpose, and his slick hand closes around John’s cock, stroking up and down. John hums in pleasure and his eyes flutter closed. He’d hoped he’d get to fuck Sherlock one more time, but this is lovely too, relaxing on his back and letting Sherlock take care of him.
Sherlock feels himself blush even though she’s not strictly speaking right – the man in question isn’t young, he’s a good ten years older than Sherlock, and Sherlock’s not thinking about him as much as about what particular acts he’d like to engage in with him – which is, all things considered, even more reason to blush, because there’s no way he can tell a kindly lady who’s old enough to be his mother that he’s thinking about the receiving role in anal sex in very explicit detail.
“You?” John says, not understanding, and then it dawns on him. The only explication: the man must have been a therapist. Had Sherlock been feeling so bad he decided he needed a new therapist and John didn’t notice? Oh god.
“Fuck, Sherlock,” John groans as Sherlock begins stroking him, his eyes sliding shut. “That feels so good.” Emboldened, Sherlock gives it everything he has, making use of all of his limited experience and everything he’s read about, and it doesn’t take very long at all before John’s pulsing hotly in his hand, grunting out a stream of endearments and praise. Sherlock feels a wave of satisfaction wash over him as John sags in his arms, and he thinks idly that giving John an orgasm feels better than solving a difficult case. At least a nine.
“Okay,” John said thoughtfully. “What about this, then?” He shifted a little, pulled Sherlock in a little more and
John braces himself on his forearms and pushes in deeper. The fullness and intrusiveness of it makes Sherlock want to scream and scramble to get away, but he bites his lip and stays quiet, breathing through his nose in an attempt to regain control
“John – I’m—” he chokes out in warning, barely in time for John to let him slip out of his mouth before he starts to come, nearly sobbing in his release as John strokes him through it, drawing it out until Sherlock feels like he’s been turned inside out. He sags onto the mattress, panting in the aftershocks, and John crawls up to kiss him, letting him taste himself on John’s tongue.
“No?” John chuckled, but didn’t protest. He kissed Sherlock’s cheek and pulled him closer, and it was perfect. “I suppose if we end up glued together with come we’ll just have to shower together.”
The night of their first kiss, they stayed on the sofa well into the small hours of the morning, kissing and cuddling and talking. Despite John’s usual reticence regarding emotional matters, this time he really seemed to want to talk to Sherlock about how he felt, to explain how he had bottled up his same-sex attraction and feelings for Sherlock, until Sherlock’s confession of his love finally forced him to stop ignoring it. Sherlock listened, aware what a privilege it was for John to share his feelings with him like that. He couldn’t really relate – he’d known he was gay since before knew what gay meant and it was never something he felt in any way ashamed of; not because he had grown up in a particularly open-minded environment, but mostly because he didn’t feel his sexual orientation was in any way relevant: romantic entanglements were to be avoided in any case. He did understand, however, how much self-loathing could affect your life, and he did his best to be supportive and try to convince John there was no need for his lingering sense of guilt.
“I want to see that,” John growls. “I want to see you fuck yourself on those beautiful long fingers. Will you show me?”
Sherlock lifts a hand to the back of his head, touching his short hair self-consciously. He had Florian cut it short and dye it a rich auburn before he left Switzerland. People don’t
“I don’t know if you can believe it, after all that mess,” John continues gently. “But it’s true, it’s… sometimes it feels like the only true thing in the world. I’m so, so sorry it took me so long to be able to say it.”
Sherlock looks at him with wide eyes, a soft blush colouring his cheeks, and then he sighs softly and nods, an adorably earnest expression on his face.
Over the four months since that fateful day when Sherlock revealed his feelings, John started seeing a new therapist (a man this time – Paskal Dibra, 43, unmarried, originally from Macedonia, no chance of being a long-lost murderous relation of Sherlock’s). Mainly, the main theme of the therapy seems to be anger management – John’s told Sherlock as much, but Sherlock knows there’s something else, something John doesn’t want him to know about, something that made him choose a therapist whose office is inconveniently far both from John’s flat and the surgery. Sherlock has resisted the urge to look up all of Paskal’s past and present clients and find out what reasons they had to visit him to see if it would help him figure out John’s reasons. John is very obviously trying to be a better friend and Sherlock feels that, for the sake of fairness, he should be doing the same, so he’s trying to be more considerate of John’s privacy and not to poke his nose where he shouldn’t.
“Hello, beautiful,” John said as Sherlock joined him on the bed and cupped his face gently. “Everything okay?”
“There you are, beautiful,” John smiled at him as if Sherlock wasn’t being completely irrational, and kissed his lips. “You okay?”
“You’re doing great, Sherlock,” John said, and it suddenly felt like the world around them had come to a standstill. “There’s no rush. All right?”
“Okay, that’s… okay,” John stutters a little, and, gratifyingly, he lifts a hand to cup Sherlock’s face. “I just… I noticed that when things get more intense, you go a little… passive. And that’s
“Robert? Is everything all right?” Sherlock asks, suddenly anxious. There didn’t seem to be anything on Robert’s mind before. They discussed the segregation of the queen at length, then moved to the bedroom and had very good sex – or at least Sherlock thought so, but something about it must have caused Robert’s thoughtfulness. Maybe he’s getting bored of Sherlock. Maybe Sherlock has imposed on his lone wolf lifestyle for too long and the sex they have can no longer make up for it.
But he doesn’t say any of it, because he can tell that if he interrupted now, Sherlock would never continue.
“I was about to come,” John explains. “But you did such a great job preparing yourself earlier, I don’t want that to go to waste.”
“No,” John says with a small, rueful quirk of the lips. “I’m – bisexual. And this is the first time I’ve actually said it out loud to anyone. Well, aside from…”
It’s the exact same thing that Sherlock had done to himself many times and yet it feels so different.
What has John done for him in return? Blamed him for Mary’s death, written him a truly horrible letter that John can’t bear to remember in too much detail without wanting to throw up, hit him while he was dying of kidney failure, been utterly insensitive to his feelings.
Sherlock might well refuse to see him, and John could hardly blame him. There’s no excuse for what he’s done, for how he’s treated Sherlock. But he must at least try and apologise, if Sherlock lets him. Then he’ll remove himself from Sherlock’s life once and for all, so he can’t hurt him anymore.
“What do you want me to say?” Should he apologise for his inadequacies? He’s never been good at apologising.
Sherlock leans in to kiss him and, without actively deciding to do it, he starts laughing. Happiness bubbles up in him, pure, unadulterated joy he has no way of containing and that needs to be expressed. He laughs until John joins him, and then they laugh together.
He waits for Sherlock to settle between his legs as he was before. His breathing’s ragged, cock rock hard and wet, and John doesn’t want to drag it out anymore. He slathers the toy with lube and then presses the tip against Sherlock’s opening, Sherlock’s legs falling wide open in invitation.
Sherlock hisses and pushes back against John. John grunts as he is sheathed in tight heat, slightly different from what he’s used to – Sherlock is relaxed post-orgasm but still tighter than when John opens him up with his fingers, and the velvety warmth that envelops him is almost too much.
Sherlock is simultaneously disappointed and relieved – it would be nice not to have to go alone, he supposes, but on the other hand, there’s a good chance he would be way too embarrassed to attempt to flirt with anyone in front of Molly.
, not a persona he projects. It’s a superficial kind of appreciation, yes, but he’d like it to be real at least, if this is the best he can get. And he’d like... He winces internally at how pathetic his needs are, but the Dr Schneider that now lives permanently in his mind palace reminds him that he should acknowledge and accept them. He’d like it if his partners were willing to give him a little… non-sexual affection afterwards, the way Florian did, and he supposes this kind of thing isn’t exactly what people go looking for in a gay bar. He’s not naive enough to expect anyone to actually like him, not on any deeper level (and even if they did, it’s not like he would be able to reciprocate), he knows that any hugs or caresses would be just as meaningless as the sex, but… it would mean something to him. Florian’s attentions made him feel
. At the same time, however, he had promised to tell John if something was wrong, which would be incredibly counterproductive, but he knew he wouldn’t be able to go so directly against John’s wishes.
confident about getting what they want, if what they want happens to be penetration. And so he finds himself drawn to a young guy who lowers his gaze when Sherlock catches him looking, but a moment later his eyes are back on Sherlock as if drawn by a magnet. He’s shorter than Sherlock but not as short as… never mind, slim and muscular, with meticulous grooming habits and well-fitting clothes. Clearly a PhD student in a humanities field, a regular, living close enough to have walked here. His eyes crinkle when he smiles. He’ll do.
“I know, love.” John is painfully hard – somehow, Sherlock lying next to him utterly wrung out from fucking John’s brains out is even more of a turn on than the act itself. He badly needs to get off, but he doesn’t think he’ll have enough strength for it for the next few days.
? Did Sherlock think no one would be gentle with him simply for the privilege of being with him? And then, a much more horrifying thought suggests itself, and John knows he’s right even before he asks, but he has to ask, he has to.
, Sherlock has wanted this for so long, to have John in his arms, finally, touching him, kissing him—
Pretty much everything that John revealed to him came as a surprise. He knew that John still harboured resentment about Sherlock’s faked death, despite the forgiveness Sherlock had forced out of him, and he knew that John’s desire for a domestic life was something he forced himself into rather than something he actually wanted, but he didn’t realise to what extent the two were linked. That John wanted to resume their old live but simultaneously didn’t want to give into that desire because of how Sherlock had hurt him. Sherlock’s betrayal was clearly,
He stays with Mrs Hudson for a quarter of an hour, chatting a bit about Rosie and Mrs Hudson’s car troubles, and then excuses himself to go visit Sherlock.
He could feel he was drenched in sweat and there didn’t seem to be enough air to breathe. John had three fingers inside him now, pushing them in and out in measured thrusts, rubbing Sherlock’s prostate every single time. Sherlock was harder than he’d ever been in his life, he was so hard it almost hurt and he could feel himself leaking on the pillow underneath his hips as he rutted against it in an involuntary movement he couldn’t stop. He needed friction, needed relief, needed
“John, please,” Sherlock says through gritted teeth, closing his eyes. “Can we just drop it? I’ll be fine, it’s a privilege to be your friend and I—”
Instead, John uses his hold on Sherlock’s shirt to pull his neck and head down, and crashes their mouths together.
“No,” John says and steps closer to Sherlock, takes his face in his hands. “It was incredibly hot. And I think - it’s a sign I’ve kept us waiting long enough. We wasted so much time, before, because of me. I don’t want to wait anymore.”
There was no way Sherlock could avoid failing John, was there? Either he wouldn’t manage to go through with it, or he would, but if then John found out how Sherlock had felt about it, he would be incredibly disappointed. John would never willingly have sex with someone who was less than 100% certain they wanted it.
John shakes his head, uncompromising. “Eat, you need your strength. I don’t want you to pass out while you’re fucking me.”
“Sherlock. I want that. God, I want that. I love you. You’re the only person who’s ever made me happy, of course I want to be with you, and I want to do everything in my power to make you happy. I just don’t know if it’s a good idea. You know that… well. Same-sex attraction is... a trigger for me. I can’t risk hurting you again.”
“I’m sorry,” he managed to get out before he had to scramble out of bed and run for the bathroom, his legs nearly giving out under him.
“Lube?” Florian asks breathily as his erection slides next to Sherlock’s, and it takes Sherlock a moment to muster enough brainpower to parse out what Florian means.
What are they doing right now? Cleaning up after lunch, maybe, having coffee together, sitting in companionable silence as each of them does his own thing. Sherlock has no right to intrude on their domesticity – he leeches on their privacy as it is. They invite him, yes, but they don’t know that the sex is only a part of why he comes, that he watches voraciously for all the little ways that show how much they love and care for each other, touches and looks and gestures that they’re probably not even aware of, little glimpses of a healthy, loving relationship that are the next best thing to having one himself. How could he possibly ask them for anything more?
He goes to the bathroom to clean himself up, trying to wash the embarrassment off his skin. This is really not how he thought his first orgasm in John’s presence would go.
John stares at him. Sherlock’s shoulders sag and his gaze drops back down. John has never felt more wrong-footed in his life. He’s wondered, of course, but Adler was the only person he’d ever seen Sherlock show any interest in. If not her, then who?
“You heard me.” Sherlock’s not going to repeat it, it was hard enough to say it once. He’s still not used to this sort of vocabulary, and definitely not out of the bedroom.
Sherlock strokes up and down John’s shaft a couple of times, trying to memorise the feel of it, before lowering his head and touching his lips to it.
Their food arrives. Sherlock looks down at his plate of fluffy pancakes, but he has no appetite anymore.
“Show me,” he commands, and Sherlock, despite his obvious need to come, doesn’t protest at all and climbs out of bed on shaky legs to rummage through his chest of drawers. John smirks to himself as he watches Sherlock’s sweaty, trembling form take out shoe-sized box – he knows that Sherlock is utterly powerless against that tone of voice.
“I don’t know what to do,” he says out loud. Jack looks up at him quizzically from where he’s lying on the rug, but when Sherlock doesn’t do anything interesting he goes back to chewing his toy.
When he emerges from his bedroom, John’s standing awkwardly in the kitchen as if unsure if he’s allowed to sit down (which makes no sense, since he clearly felt comfortable enough to open Sherlock’s bottle of wine). The lines around his mouth and eyes appear deeper than they were a few hours ago, and he seems unable to look at Sherlock. Is this pity? Sherlock doesn’t know if he’ll be able to bear it if it’s pity.
“Dada?” Rosie asks, looking up at Sherlock with interest. She’s so intelligent, already able to pick up words she knows in the flow of conversation.
When it’s finally over he can do nothing but lie there and pant, his mind utterly blank, his body wrung out. He doesn’t even manage a wince when John slips out of him. When he finally recovers enough to open his eyes, he finds John lying on his side, an arm folded underneath his head, looking at him with the most tender, adoring smile Sherlock has ever seen. Before he knows it he’s smiling back, and they spend an indeterminable amount of time like that, not saying anything, just looking at each other and grinning like fools. Sherlock’s heart feels full to bursting.
The faint confidence Sherlock felt in the morning progressively dissipated as the day went on. This was his last chance. One failure could perhaps be tolerated, but two would be unacceptable. Sherlock wasn’t nearly good enough for John as it was and if on top of it he couldn’t even give him sex, why should John stay with him? John was incredibly attractive, he’d have no trouble finding someone else, someone capable of meeting his needs. Sherlock couldn’t let that happen.
Sherlock nods, heat rising in his cheeks. Sam crouches at his feet, places one hand on Sherlock’s knee and finds Sherlock’s downcast eyes.
“Can I… Can I hug you?” John asks, his thumb still stroking over Sherlock’s cheekbone. “I’d like to hug you.”
and he couldn’t get any of it. His cock was sliding against wet cotton and it was not enough John’s fingers were driving into him and it was too much and his only points of contact with John were the fingers inside him and the hand on his hip and the lube made ugly squelching noises and John was murmuring incomprehensible words and Sherlock was moaning, loud desperate keening sounds, and he couldn’t breathe, his heart was hammering, he was going to hyperventilate and have a panic attack unless he stopped it, he had to stop it, he couldn’t ruin this for John, he couldn’t he couldn’t he couldn’t—
“Take care of yourself,” Molly tells him when they break apart, Sherlock blinking back moisture that seems to have gathered in his eyes.
Irene inclines her head to the side, narrowing her eyes slightly, clearly trying to figure out the reasons behind Sherlock’s questions. “That you were afraid of making yourself vulnerable and would only sleep with someone you trusted completely. That deep down, you were a hopeless romantic and would only give your body to the one who already had your heart, and it was obvious who
“What? You went into your mind palace while we were having sex?! Why?” John was going to be angry. Of course he was. Sherlock had just absolutely ruined their first time, hadn’t he?
“Yes,” Sherlock says immediately, because it looks like John is biting back tears and Sherlock wants it to stop, but then he realises that’s probably exactly what John told him not to do. He tries to imagine ever denying John anything, but he can’t. After how much he’d hurt John in the past, how could he not want to give John everything? But he doesn’t want John to ever look like he does now, so he’ll do his best. “That is,” he says, “I’ll… try.”
“Sorry! I didn’t mean to startle you. Um, is Sherlock here?” he asks, but he already has a feeling that he isn’t – there seems to be something missing from the flat.
Robert steps closer, frowning a little as he searches Sherlock’s face. “But you know we don’t have to do that. I don’t care if we never do that.”
“It’s all right if you can’t,” John assures him, because the key to Sherlock’s pleasure is making sure he doesn’t feel pressured. “I can make you come in other ways. But I think you can. You’re halfway there already, aren’t you, just from the thought of it.”
He let go of John and scrambled to his hands and knees, grateful that at least this way his face would be hidden from John’s view. The anticipation would be over soon, in just a few moments John would push in and then he would be
“Sherlock,” John said and touched Sherlock’s chin lightly to make Sherlock look up at him. “I love you. I promise I’ll take better care of you next time, but I need you to tell me if something’s wrong. Anything at all. Can you do that? Will you tell me?” John’s eyes were earnest, his tone gentle but uncompromising. Sherlock couldn’t refuse him anything.
