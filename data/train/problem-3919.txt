“See ya later, Cas,” and he gave a cheery wave as he left.
Castiel was wildly panting in a way Dean had never heard him do, as a deranged animal might. They staggered towards Room 11, and as they arrived, the last feather fell. Feathers and down lay ankle deep around them, as Dean pulled him through the door and lay him face down on the bed.
“That is how families are supposed to be,” Castiel said. “I thought that’s how the people of Haven and I were, but it turns out we’re not really family at all.”
“Tonight, I got to be in the room when a baby was born,” Dean said proudly.
Dean shrugged airily. Cas gave a reminiscent, a very, “I just got laid,” smile.
“No,” Dean said, as if it was obvious. “If that were true, I’d be married already.”
“There’s a table, a table with a map, a kitchen, and a, there’s a dungeon.”
“Nosirree, you didn’t buy ‘a single’ chicken. Your voice sure sounds funny. You got a thousant chickens for 20 bucks which is the deal of the century and I’m a little steamt but otherwise I’d be out it all, so I guess I’ll take what the good Lord brings me.”
There was an obviously unhappy pause. Castiel exhaled through his nostrils and shifted against the upholstery. Finally he said, “If I was worthy I would have been upheld by angels,” Castiel said.
Cas smiled. “Then it’s what turns into love. Before he knew who I was, before anything, I was a guy ruining his evening because he was scared to leave me alone. He saved my life. I woke up choking and he saved me. He’s been nothing but sweet to me. Fuck you. I’m going to talk to Anna and change the locks.”
“That damned moose,” Dean muttered.
Dean’s freckles disappeared into a sea of shining pink. “No.”
“Feel like getting a haircut today?” Dean asked.
Carefully, smirking at the suggestive sucking sound the tube of Astroglide makes, he adds more lube to his fingers, and with a circular motion, gently slides his pinky finger into Cas.
“I have no idea what that means,” Castiel said.
Dean cut to the chase. “I’ll work Sunday. And whatever extra time is needed, within the week.”
“We should get a nice greasy breakfast.”
want to stop?”
“Because I like you,” Dean said, through his food.
!) into the delivery room. They were perplexed and unhappy that there was to
Now that he was lying down, Castiel was able to speak. Dean shook his head as he realized what Castiel was saying. “It’s a magico-physical manifestation caused by my dirty grace.”
“Why did you administer drugs to me?” I asked, thinking it seemed like a reasonable question, given that I was feeling bodiless, and confused.
“Okay. But I warned you.”
“Like he’ll pay to have me killed?”
His voice was softer, and patient. “I was there. You told me that you loved me, you said the most, the most beautiful and amazing things… and you were gone before I could tell you how much I loved you.”
Cas told his two staffers he was now officially gone for the day, and that whatever they had observed, civility had returned to their conversation. They looked dubious and his customer said, “Is this some kind of mob thing?” and after a startled silence Cas said, with awful sarcasm, “I’m so terribly sorry you can’t tell what the body language of a lover’s quarrel looks like.”
“Of course,” Benny said in that soft Cajun accent. “He’ll figure that part out for himself.”
The man stretched his arms up, briefly simulating an angel falling. Sand, remnants of previous falls, twinkled like glitter as it shed from his arms and shoulders. He ran down the log and then fell into the sand. Almost instantly he got up, said, “How invigorating!” in a pleased voice, and then he puked in a continuous stream like a sideways-blowing geyser for eight seconds, by Dean’s count. He was an EMT, he couldn’t help it; even drunk, he tracked a total stranger’s vitals. Dean burst into a slow clap as he moved toward the man.
“I can’t hurt you more than your childhood did,” Cas said, almost shrugging. “I don’t want to re-traumatize you, either. You don’t think you deserve anything good. You’ll fight for other people to have it - you told me you put that long-armed brother of yours through Stanford,” Cas said in an aside, “But happiness isn’t your bag.”
Castiel reached into the cupboard and brought a box over to Dean. It had a yellow sticky-note on it, which read, in Sam’s strong, small handwriting, “I would love it if one morning a week, at least, you could eat something that actually l o w e r s your cholesterol.”
“Because God in His infinite wisdom chose for me to wait until I could do it with you,” Cas said.
To leave his possibly-dying best friend to do research back in the bunker seemed like a fucking terrible decision, even if it was a fine afternoon stretching into the evening, and a comfortable temperature to be outdoors. Dean lay down next to Castiel and put his hand between his shoulder blades. Castiel didn’t waken, but he whimpered, and not really understanding what he was doing, Dean started kneading Castiel’s wings, sliding his fingers from next to his back up to the weird finger-type bones he had at the top of his wings, smoothing and pressing and massaging. Once in a while Castiel sighed, but not in a pained way, so Dean kept working.
“Practice.”
, Cas thought.
Dean had heard a lot of astonishing things that day but this was too much. “What?”
“As long as you’re only tempted,” Castiel said, and put his shot glass down in front of Dean.
“You do?” Dean said. He looked weird for a second, and then laughed. “Do tell.”
“I never do, until you explain it,” Dean said, in a coaxing voice. Fuck, those wings are awesome, he thought, a half-smile accompanying his admiration.
“You don’t understand,” Dean said, his face stark with the need to
“Oh, Dean,” Cas said, his heart in his eyes and a tiny thread of caution in his voice.
It was a little thing, just his houseguest getting up and doing stuff in the kitchen, but he was wearing Dean’s clothes, and Castiel making tea while wearing Dean’s clothes did something weird to his innards.
With a straight face, Cas said, “Downstairs. There are also half a dozen classic pinball games, four different consoles loaded to the rafters with games - the ex’s idea, not mine, please believe me - a couple of cars you might like to drool on, an endless pool, yet another swimming pool which I’m seriously thinking of filling in with a fish pond, and bunches of other little bits of wretched excess you might find entertaining.”
“Gabe says that if I don’t have sex with you as soon as possible you’ll lose interest and I’ll have to go live with him.”
Dean talked about his love of simple things like food and pie and rock music from the 70s and Dr Sexy and, had he mentioned pizza yet; his fight to find some kind of exercise which would allow him to eat whatever the hell he wanted (“Hour and a half workout, every other day. I fuckin’ hate it and I’d fuckin die without it, so there you go.”) He talked about his fucked up childhood but only in very, very general terms, and they kept right on talking until they pulled up at Cas’s place. It was well after dark by that point; they’d set out around three, but with all the stops, they’d made a three hour run into seven hours.
“He asked me,” the man said. This time Dean wanted to kiss that owlish look off his face, and managed to remember over his drunken lust that the guy had just finished upchucking a fuckton of shitty open-bar-alcohol.
“I guess,” Dean said, shrugging.
/// /// ///
Castiel looked at Dean, who shut up. Gabe wasn’t saying anything either, but his lips were compressed and he still looked sort of guilty.
“In new creation. The bond we now share is part of the structure of the universe, and all of the universes. We made something beautiful from something broken; we made a new order from disobedience; we knew to cherish innocence because it had been stolen from us; we learned to love when we thought we were unworthy. Our experiences were wildly different. I don’t even belong in this iteration of the multiverse.”
“Where do you live?”
“Well, start with Google and Wikipedia,” Dean said.
Cas’s voice was dry. “I know which I’d prefer. Are you gay?”
“It’s not a marriage!” Castiel said, obviously flustered.
“Last night I dreamed that I was cast down into hell,” Cas said. Dean shivered from head to foot. The motion did not go unnoticed by the other two men. “I fell for what seemed like a very long time, into a pit. Smoking red chains grew from the wall like vines and I knew I was going to be a prisoner forever, tormented with my sin.”
Lying together, afterward, Cas says, "I was reading that long-term couples just get better and better at pleasing each other sexually, and that they're just as happy with their sex lives in their eighties as they were in their thirties, sometimes even happier."
“Yeah.”
“That bad,” Dean said.
“Well, it’s sure how a lot of babies get made,” Dean said.
“Anything. You know I’ll do anything to help.”
“Now don’t you go getting religious on me, she’s named after her grandmother,” Dean said. He realized he was practically bellowing, and thought of his neighbours, and how it was Oh! Dark Thirty and so he added, much more quietly, “Let’s get inside.”
germs! You’re about to find out why!” Dean grinned. “It’s just one shot. One teeny shot.” They were actually doubles. He poured them out a drink apiece.
Cas smiled.
He took a breath and made the mistake of saying what was in his heart, “You asshole! I wanna marry Cas!”
“I can’t return to Haven. I have been expelled, because I am a freak who is an abomination to the Lord,” as if this was an acceptable explanation for his trouble.
Castiel noticed the stack of pancakes and bacon and the carafe of coffee and, still looking at the note, sat down to devour his breakfast. In his exhaustion, he had slept, all unknowing, as Dean cooked it, only a few yards away.
“Why do you have to stay?”
“What the fuck is wrong with you two?” she yelled. “Stop it this minute.”
Dean didn’t disagree. “Like I said, a wonderful husband.”
how I know that. She’s done all the latest research on trans people, polyamory friendly, up to date on her vaccinations, blah blah blah,” and Castiel bit his lip and then he gave up and laughed.
“We hope.”
“What’s the good news?”

“Oh,” Castiel said.
Dean backed up emotionally as well as physically. “I did what anyone would do.” His words sounded stupid to his own ears.
“No,” Castiel said, “I really don’t want that.”
For half an hour, occasionally repeating old moves, sometimes coming up with new ones, Dean applies everything he knew about pleasuring his partner. At the end Cas convulses for about twenty seconds, making almost a squeaking noise which resolves into a low groan, and then Dean very carefully pulls out his finger and says, “You having a good time?”
Dean said, “I’m sure attracted to you. I was before I dreamed about you, and I still am.”
Dean kissed him quiet. Then, fixing Cas with a warning glance, he called his brother.
This was no ordinary log; it was the root end of a mature cedar tree, three yards high at one end and looking like somebody big from the Lord of the Rings movies had just chucked it onto the beach, after braining somebody equally enormous with it. It was big and long and round and devoid of lower branches, and it sloped gently down to the sand, all things that made it a challenge for someone this drunk.
“Oh.”
After he turned on his side, unspeaking, away from Cas. Cas mopped up what he could reach and rested his arm across Dean and thought he might have pulled off being deliriously happy two days in a row, so that probably meant seven years of bad luck, like breaking a mirror… god, Dean felt so damned good, lying next to him….
Man vs. Machine - machine penetration and “sex machines like you’ve never seen!”
“We are not!” Dean said. He dragged Cas up the stairs into his office, glared at the three men looking up at them, and smashed down the blinds with an angry gesture.
“You’re mine,” Dean said. “I’ll do anything you ask me.” He set his jaw.
Then Sam had married Eileen, and he was tetherless. He’d always been a little wild. The brothers fought, always away from Sam’s growing family.
“You stare at me like you hate me. I thought I was your closest friend and you won’t even … you don’t want to look at me. I must have done something terribly disappointing and no matter how hard I try to come up with the reason, I… Dean, just tell me. I’ll be okay.”
“You think I don’t enjoy fooling around in your butt?” Dean asks, serious but teasing.
At the time, Dean had intuited that Michael having a key no longer worked for Cas. He moved in a pink and tan blur while Michael squawked like a frightened bird and stepped ineffectually backward. Dean seized him, got his keys off him while rubbing his dick on the bottom of his suit jacket and pant leg, let go of Michael and tossed the keys to Cas, while Michael, stunned into silence punctuated by his huffy, hostile breathing, glared at both of them in turns.
Customers told him that, through Dean, he’d given them relief from pain and anxiety and writer’s block and other personal and private matters they’d rather not mention.
“He’s the town character,” Sue said.
“You’ve been not very subliminally begging me to fuck you for the last two hours, and then you say things like
“What? so’s we can get dragged through the shit along with you?” Dean asked in disbelief. “Maybe you can work on your
Dean chuckled. “And there I am, on the church steps.”
Castiel: You have an amazing circle of friends and family. They are all people who love you. You should see their faces when they talk about you.
“I’m gonna be late for work!” Dean pleaded, and something about his tone made Cas relent. “Can you wait long enough to let me sign out and then follow you in my car?”
Castiel: He does like being right.
That dried him up. He started thinking about what he’d come for. He was praying to God, he reminded himself, to support his efforts to straighten out his life, be a good enough person to find a good partner, and quit shooting himself in the foot when anything nice happened to him. He was praying to God for the strength to not be a jealous asshole about Sam’s happiness. He was also here to ask God for a sign. ’Should I stay here or move to California to be with Sam and Jess and the fourteen kids they plan to have, or what?’
“Not really. It was good to be able to help a friend,” Castiel said. He was trying to sound casual.
“Are you crazy? I’m the man who bought a thousand chickens without noticing! Why the hell would you want to date me!”
“I want to show you Saturn someday,” Castiel grouched.
“Done,” Dean said.
He sighed. “Please don’t grab hold of me without warning, it’s liable to get you a shot to the head; I’m antsy that way.”
“I don’t know how long I’ll be here.”
“Dean!” Cas called breathlessly, and dragged Dean away. As soon as they were out of earshot and in the cab, Cas laughed and then held his head.
“Don’t come near me, I gotta go home and shower,” Dean said.
And Gabe had that figured out almost immediately.
Dean: Being deranged and all.
“I should probably check out of my hotel first.”
“You seemed a lot more sober than me.”
“You could marry a woman
“Got what straight between you,” Castiel said. You could bounce a basketball off that lower lip. It was so cute Dean wanted to yeet Gabe into the front walkway straight over the railing, forget the prick ever existed and just kiss Castiel senseless.
Castiel thought that he could pick the perfect length to snap things off.
Castiel looked dubious.
“’kay,” Dean said, and Castiel apparently gave up trying to gently instil table manners in his host, and turned his attention to his own food.
There was a little halt in time, before they crashed into each other, only to back away to get their shirts off. They sloppy-kissed while dragging each other slowly up the bed, rolling each other over in a cross between a puppy brawl and a full-on demonstration of hominid dominance. They both collected some bruises.
“Why are you so drunk,” Dean said in the flattest tone he could manage. Could be gay, could be ace and autistic and unused to alcohol, could be so fucking cute that Dean was intrigued and trying not to act like it.
“You’re a legit businessman, and I’m just a man ho,” Dean shrugged.
“Holy shit. Maybe holy water? Balm of Gilead? Should you even be in the bunker?” Dean asked helplessly.
“Don’t say that about yourself,” Castiel said. “I don’t think you are, anyway,” he added.
Dean flinched as he spoke. Cas did not understand what he had said to dismay or offend Dean, so he stopped.
Alastair had a heart attack after he was transferred to jail on various charges, including fraud and kidnapping, and died without a will, so the lawyers had a field day and the feds had to put together a task force to deal with the tangle of land and buildings he’d owned so as to disburse funds to his victims.
Dean grinned and occasionally laughed aloud as his strong hands and thumbs found new pleasure points on Castiel’s feet and the moans went up and down in tone and volume.
Dean: What the hell dude I have every intention of dating you but your hub ded less than a yr ago & I’m not intrested in a rebound.
“Who is your love?” Dean said. He sounded upset.
He refused to cry. He wasn’t going to give up. Dean needed him as much as he needed Dean, and he’d come back. He had stupid thoughts, one being that he could probably hire a private detective to find Dean, but that would be a waste of money and Dean was going to call him anyway.
“Fuck that noise, I’ma Hugh Hefner the fuck outta this and wear a really nice bathrobe.” He pointed to the back of the door and peeled his clothes off before shouldered his way into the fluffy beige bathrobe hanging there.
“Lucky Lee,” Castiel breathed. They were kissing again. Dean pulled back first and said, “The bath,” and broke away to the bathroom, Castiel trailing him.
“Nope, still alive,” Gabe said with mock sympathy. “I’m sure his sister’s not sorry, although I’m sure me being dead would work better for you.”
He hung up and thought,
“Well, if it’s unprecedented, how do know you’re gonna die?” Dean asked, with what he thought was calm logic.
“More like yourself,” Dean supplied. He leaned forward and kissed Cas. After about two minutes they pulled themselves apart. Cas looked awestruck. It was very cute.
“I suppose now we both look like assholes to your employees.”
Castiel: Called it.
“This is all very disturbing to me,” the priest said after a while. “Satan often tempts the unsophisticated by exposing them to the idea of spiritual warfare and then pitting them against a demon they can’t withstand. These dreams represent temptation. You are both being tempted away from your true purpose.”
“What?” Dean said. Castiel extended a finger and said, “Her! that’s my aunt Naomi! she’s on the board of trustees at her church!”
“That’s honest work,” Dean said.
“No, my brother was having a rough time the year between college and grad school and Pam used a combination of embodied CBT and programmed meditation on him. Don’t ask me what any of that means, and she’s sort of like a witch, she never does the same thing for any patient twice.”
“Dean,” Bobby said. He’d been listening in, obviously; Dean hadn’t even noticed him.
“Yeah,” Castiel says faintly after a second. “Please don’t stop, ah, anything.”
Dean: Cas?
“I’m an artificial intelligence,” I said. Not having a real body suddenly made more sense. But how I could have come to this?
Castiel stood. “I don’t want to break your furniture,” he said.
“Mm aw oh. Yeah, more lube. Oh.” Dean didn’t say another sentence for twenty minutes.
Cas heard the inhalation as a mechanical rasp. “I’m a sex worker.”
A normal day included coffee, working out, a shower with a carefully choreographed routine including his teeth and hair and toes and armpits, donning long sleeved tan overalls with “Bobby’s Garage” embroidered on the pocket, and driving to said garage in his black ‘67 Impala, stock but for the tape deck and the air-conditioning, and the decades of love and care the obsessive men of his family had lavished on a car who already had a personality and was probably achieving sentience as the odometer crept upward.
“Soy cheese?” Sam called back.
“I don’t know if it’s a major life change or not but I’m sure tired of not knowing your name.” He stuck his hand out and said, “Dean,” and startled, the other man took it and said, “Castiel,” and they shook. Dean smiled. “Well, that’s one thing off my list. Cas-tee-el.”
been alone. He closed his eyes, allowed himself to wince, and then turned around with a bright fake smile.
“‘kay,” Dean said. “See you at home tonight then.”
“I’m enjoying the lack of responsibility, and the even more welcome absence of people trying to kill me,” Gabe said. “I don’t mind saying the food’s as good or better than anything I could get at a modest hotel, the money for which I do not currently have.”
Bobby had gotten diabetes, and then he’d gotten nerve damage, and then he’d had part of his foot amputated, and now he was morose and lonely and watching life amble away and leave him in the weeds.
“I’m in an unbeliever’s house. This is a door into the pit of Hell,” Castiel said conversationally. Imitating Dean, he took his shoes off.
“Your brother punched you?” Cas said in disbelief.
sus,” Dean said tipping his head back as if he really was appealing to the Son of God. “So you’re dead, basically.” Cas was looking at Gabe with total pity and shaking his head.
Castiel: You want some assurance I’m serious.
“Dibs on the cars and the pinballs.”
Dean realized he did not have his story straight. And he would never get the story straight as long as he was having a low-key panic attack about Cas disappearing out the door.
After he came completely awake, he tried to remember if he’d ever had a dream like that in his life.
Dean let him have it with the finger gun. “Exactamundo.”
“And I could not be who I am. Father Al was angry with me for not coming to this conclusion earlier.”
Dean thought about getting down on one knee, and mentally blew past that part. “Castiel, will you marry me, so we can at least visit each other in hospital?”
“Parts of it were really fun. And he understood certain things about me, stuff on a kind of basic level, when you don’t talk.”
“I’m sorry, I’ve forgotten your name already,” Dr. Novak said.
“Okay,” Cas said. “Park anywhere.”
Dean: That’s good to know.
“Sammy knows I’m weird and loves me anyway, that’s what family does.”
fight was try to warm my hands up in his armpits. Got a couple of awesome shots in to his ribs, but I got a concussion for my trouble. I’m man enough to admit I got beat.”
“You’re his angel-in-law, fucking well better not lie to him by omission! Sammy and me, we’ve been clowns at this rodeo for a long, long time, and we get in trouble when we don’t tell each other shit, every – goddamned – time. So, I’m sorry if secrecy doesn’t meet with your agenda or with Jimmy’s Catholic guilt, but Sammy’s getting told as soon as he comes in the door.”
Dean shrugged. He was half-snapped himself, having abandoned his own baby brother’s wedding reception after a quick check to see if he might be walking distance from a place he might partake of some anonymous outdoor sex.
Dean: Dirty floors make me anxious.
Castiel: In all of our interactions besides this one I suppose you’ve never done or said anything that could be construed as weird.
When I was able to walk again, and still slowly regaining my strength, I asked Dean to walk with me outside. For a minute he didn’t want to - he didn’t seem to want to be around me at all, most days - and then grudgingly he agreed.
They smiled at each other, soft, slow smiles.
Cas wants to fuck him from behind, another surprise, and Dean trembles as the head of Castiel’s cock trails lube and pre-cum all around his asshole. He relaxes, and burning hot angel cock slides into his ass. He puts his forehead down onto the bed and moans rhythmically as Castiel slams home. He isn’t being particularly gentle, and within a few minutes, clinging to Dean like a drowning man, he comes, whispering, "Dean," once against the back of his neck as he does, wrapping his arms around his torso and collapsing against him.
“You taught me something very important, just in these past few days. Whether or not I go to heaven, the only time I have the ability to change things on this earth for myself and other people is while I’m alive, and it’s a brief and scary life, a lot of the time. As long as I know that I can move forward, and make friends, and put Haven in its proper place in my life, I’ll have the strength to keep helping others. You gave that to me. And look at you, how you give of yourself to other people! I’ve never heard in my life of a woman inviting her brother-in-law into her delivery room. If she feels that safe with you, what kind of man must you be? I’d guess generous and loving.”
“So I’m a rent boy, bringing you low.”
“What the hell are you talking about?” Dean said.
“Sure,” Dean said, waving a hand.
The cold fog blew off like a hurricane had come through. “Yeah,” Dean managed, before Castiel was kissing him with a hint of coffee and maple.
“I wouldn’t,” Cas said. “But you’re either the world’s best liar or you genuinely care about the outcome.”
The Feminine Side - skin care, makeup, clothes, food and everything glamor, aimed at male-identified people wanting to explore smashing the gender binary in private and in public
to him.
Cas frowned, but it was meant to be comical. “I think I’d prefer to keep everything in the master suite - we’ve got everything we want in there. Stocked bar, reheatable meals, two person soaker-jacuzzi, sauna —“
After Dean pulled out his sticky note, Cas said, “Are you buying marijuana for all of your friends now?”
Dean returned to his point. “I haven’t told Sam, and given that he’s liable to leave at any moment if a childhood friend or relative can come through for him - who isn’t Gabe, I personally will stab Gabe in the neck and call it self defence, if he tries to convince Castiel to leave with him - I didn’t see much point. ‘Yeah, hey, Sam, there was this cool guy here for a couple of weeks, too bad you missed ‘im.”
At the last second he pulls out and comes in six jets, all across Castiel's chest and belly, into his pubic hair. Dean leans over for an upside down kiss, and then finds some tissue.
Castiel: I’m terribly sorry. When you put it like that I sound deranged.
Castiel was calm and kind. “I can’t give you money. I can listen, that’s all.”
“How about, ‘As soon as possible,’?” Dean suggested.
Castiel’s eyes suddenly met his, and Dean felt his breath catch. They were so honest, so earnest, and held so many questions in their depths.
“What?” Dean asked, truly startled.
“Far enough away that if people weep it’s not uncomfortable for them,” the man replied.
“Right.” There was a long pause. “Boyfriend.”
Both he and Garth were taken aback by Dean’s guilty expression. “It’s just until he can get established, he’s got some… issues. He’s just getting free from a cult,” Dean explained.
“I don’t remember any Eileen,” I said. “And the bunker is, the bunker is – there’s a big squeaky door.”
“I do okay,” Dean said. They both looked off into the distance and said nothing for a while.
“You’re kidding.”
There was a little gulp in his voice. Well, that explained Castiel’s quiet droopiness. Poor guy had been crying.
“Relax,” Dean said. “This is a place where you can scratch your balls in peace.”
“I keep forgetting you’re like Rip Van Winkle,” Dean said.
“This is all Jimmy’s doing!” Castiel protested. Jimmy made a disparaging noise in the background. “And we may be able to trick Heaven into sneaking me in with Jimmy’s soul. I mean, I wouldn’t have a physical presence in Heaven but at least I’d be there with you.”
“I’ll take that as a yes,” Cas said. “No, I’m not letting you get into your car until we talk.”
painted in old-fashioned lettering on the hanging sign, above the phone number.
“Dean!”
Gabe considered Dean’s red face and appeared to tell the truth. “He said it seemed a shame that someone who’d been missing for twenty years should get the money when I was alive and needed it right now, and for two grand he handed it over.”
“I know I’d fucking hate them, and they’d fucking hate me… okay, we’re at the Sally Ann. I know they aren’t nice to trans and gay people but I don’t have a lot of choice here for secondhand stores. They close in an hour,” Dean said, “So make sure you get into the change rooms in plenty of time.”
“If you two don’t stop talking like the other one’s not here, I’m going to lock you both in the dungeon, but far enough apart that you’ll get bondmate sickness.”
Freaky Fridays - subscriber requests and private cam sessions!”
“To losing your whiskey virginity!” Dean toasted, and downed his with aplomb. Castiel scowled at Dean, and still scowling, upended the shot glass and started wheezing, and after Dean clapped him on the back said, in a choked voice, “Will anyone care if I have two?”
“What?” Castiel put his hand up to his hair and said in a mortified voice, “Is it really that bad by today’s standards?”
“Winchester!” Castiel said, trying to warn him off, as Dean approached him. Dean shrugged and ignored him. “C’mon up, we’ll get you back to our room.”
Castiel kept his voice mild. “I understand he’s quite good looking.”
“I am definitely your friend,” Sam said, and his voice was almost overwhelming in its dear familiarity. I felt like I was getting a hug. Maybe there were more people I knew. How did I know Sam? Was my name really Cas? Everything felt wrong and right at the same time.
“Did you write in your story of how you got here?”
“If you drink more I’ll be tempted to kiss you again.”
“I’m not going to leave this,” Castiel said.
“Minimal devotion to the details of the rites was paid,” Castiel said, returning to his normally bland style.
I asked Rowena, and she said she couldn’t help me.
“Keep him out of the press, too,” Michael said.
“You are not a total bastard! You’re –” Dean shut up. Castiel was grinning again. “If you were a total bastard you wouldn’t have donated your time.”
“Well, you need ID if you’re going to do much in this life, thanks to the government, so let’s start at the beginning. Where were you born?”
Dean said, “That’s fantastic news…. but you still need to get ID.”
“Might I be so bold as to enquire,” Dr. Novak said in that calm, gentle, deep voice, “As to how you became the owner of a thousand chickens?”
“Castielllllll! Which fake ID do you want to use?”
“Earl Grey.”
“But I want to – ” and here there was a very long pause, “top,” Castiel whispered.
He woke to the familiar hiss of an emergency worker’s radio, and realized, as the flashlight in his face fucking near blinded him, and as the cop sang a familiar refrain, that they were being rousted for sleeping on the beach at 3 am.
By unspoken mutual agreement, they quit talking about dating and quit prodding each other with sex talk. Castiel hated that Dean was right. He wasn’t supposed to be dating. He wasn’t ready, although he longed for physical contact in a way that shook him and saddened him and woke him up stiff as a tree.
“Yeah, that’ll keep you on the straight and narrow,” Dean said, and closed the door behind him.
“No, Dean,” and Dean flinched a little.
Dean: Jesus God no it is not, I wash the couch covers 2xmo.
Dean stroked the dashboard tenderly. “Don’t listen to the mean man, Baby, you’ve got all the flash you need in your shiny chrome. And speaking of Baby, I’ll tell you why I was passing by just now. I just got back from where my bro and sis-in-law had a baby, and I am now an
“I’m so sorry I made your brother mad at you!” Cas said.
“I don’t want you to have sex with me and then regret it.”
“For my brother,” Dean clarified. “I got a thousand chickens for twenty bucks!”
“I’ll be home at 5:30. Is there anything I can help you with before I head out?” Dean asked.
“If you send me a dick pic, I’ll send you a dick pic and then we’ll be even,” Cas said.
“But it’s all good,” Cas said. “I’ve met the most wonderful man.”
“Well, maybe you can avoid having that opinion, out loud, around me and my friends,” Dean said, allowing himself to be annoyed without telling Castiel what to think. “This is us.” He parked and clicked off the ignition.
“I stopped remembering you were rich while you were pounding me in the ass,” Dean said apologetically.
“I’ll admit I was hopeful but Jimmy wouldn’t share your passwords,” Gabe said, flashing a brief and pointed smile.
“Uh, uh, hi, Doc, I got an emergency, a vet emergency,” Dean stammered.
“So Sam knows all about this guy,” Benny said.
Castiel: I feel like I’m at the top of this conversation again. Why would you threaten to send me a dick pic? In my experience men just do it.
“So, molt here,” Dean shrugged.
“What part of the food budget do you want to sacrifice for tux rental, and how much weight do you want to rearrange before we get measured for said tuxes?” Cas replied. “The way I see it, you’re going to want to spend more money on the reception than on the wedding.”
“You won’t be able to deal with me being rich, and you won’t believe I’m literally getting rid of it as fast as I ethically can, as stupid as that sounds. My personal responsibilities at the moment include helping to run businesses which are income sources supporting almost two thousand people. I’m able to have a good time, but I’m stealing time from my true responsibilities to be with you because, frankly, I can’t fucking help it.”
Dean: It wasn’t nearly as much fun to be on the receiving end of that.
“You think you’ve lost them.”
Dean: This should be interesting.
“Hey Cas.”
“I feel seen,” Dean said with terrible sarcasm. In a rather different voice, he said, “I went for this deal because I wanted you to stay. You are good for my mental and physical health. I would die for you, cheerfully. You are the best friend I ever had. I did this so you wouldn’t leave. Asking me if I want you to leave is just killing me, man, don’t do it. I know Jimmy’s in there, but I don’t want to interact with him until I’ve had a chance to talk to Sam.”
He was certainly broad-minded enough to stand up with Cas and Dean during their Vegas wedding, which had an honour guard of exotic dancers, one of whom did a pole dancing routine while smoking a joint (even Gabe was pop-eyed, watching that), and the whole thing was captured on video by drones. “And before you ask,” Dean said, “I’m not putting this on the cam site!”
“Which hopefully will be many years from now,” Dean said. He tried to sound calm without veering off into condescending.
“Well, donate yours, and join me for dinner on Friday,” Castiel said persuasively.
“I mean, holy shit,” Dean said, in a quiet, worried way. He took another deep breath, almost shaking like a dog for the briefest time. He recollected that he was being a host. There was no way he could verbally deal with the hate Castiel so casually mentioned, so he concentrated on being hospitable. “Your towel and washcloth are here, your toothbrush is here,” and he pulled a new one out of the cupboard, “And here’s a new comb, sheesh! I’m a pack rat, now that I’ve got my own place. You can use this soap and this shampoo and take as long as you like. I’ll set some clothes just inside the door for you in a couple of minutes. I’m going to work on soup.”
After a few moments, Castiel put his hands up and pushed gently on Dean’s chest.
“Castiel Novak,” Castiel said.
“What makes you think I’m not already?”
“Well, so did you, culture-wise,” Dean said. He spent an amusing few minutes getting Castiel up to speed on his laptop, made sure he had notes, and gave him his friend Charlie’s number; if anyone could handle having a total stranger/computer noob calling her on Dean’s say-so, it was her. Castiel was a quick study and said, “I think I’ll look at what happened in the world while I was at Haven. Thank you so much for helping me.”
When they cautiously opened the bathroom door, Gabe was not eavesdropping. They shared a look of surprise. Dean poked his head all the way through the door and Gabe was sitting with his back to them, headphones on, a Fallen Order start-up menu silently being manipulated across Dean’s massive television screen.
“Yeah, Sammy, picture my surprise when I’m going on my honeymoon cruise and turns out some creeper’s been lying in bed with me. Well, since Jimmy the creeper seems to have an opinion on everything without necessarily wanting to share it, I thought I’d open up the floor.”
Dean immediately stopped being disappointed, since this was a brother and not a boyfriend.
“You do, but we can’t find them,” Rowena said. “We know you hid a copy of your own memories inside a sliver of grace, but not where, and it seems you aren’t currently aware of it either.”
Dean was not expecting that. “Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy,” Dean said rapidly, and after ditching his shoes, he came into the kitchen like a teenager on a mission to raid a fridge. “Smells amazing. Now I want you to kiss me, and ask me how my day was.”
He caught Dean staring at him, and smiled. Dean’s innards did another little shift, and he paid more attention to his food.
Cas laughed aloud. “This is just a test!” he said, still laughing. “No, of course not. You don’t have to. You don’t need to say it. Not if you don’t feel it. You embody it, that’s all. The way you hold me, kiss me, pass me pepper, bring me coffee, disagree with me, throw popcorn at me, throw your arm around me – “
a man,” Castiel said. “But maybe they won’t marry
“You’re throwing me around in public without really hurting me, of course I’m enjoying it,” Dean said sarcastically.
There was an awkward pause as Dean remembered that Castiel probably had been crying. He hastily stumbled into saying something, hoping it would help.
“You damned near killed him,” Dean said, his voice deep and loud. Jimmy flinched.
Cas has disappeared under the covers and his feet are up close to the pillow.
“You never got paid?” Dean asked, astonished.
Dean’s smile broadened. “You’re named after an angel?”
“Failing to mention that by that point Jimmy was yelling in my ear.”
Dean: l8r
“I want you to do whatever gives you the most pleasure. I want to lick your beautiful asshole and then stretch you out with a nice big dildo and then I want to fuck you until you feel me melt inside your belly.”
“Oh, I don’t think I need to worry about that for much longer,” Castiel replied.
Dean lowered his voice. “Are you in grief counselling, or a self-help group?”
“Testy,” Gabe frowned. “I’ve already run through Castiel’s inheritance.”
With the last of my strength, I brushed his lips with mine and said, “That’s how, assbutt. Now, I need to go back to the bunker and lie down, this instant, I’m about to fall down.” It wasn’t a long walk, and I leaned on him hard, because I had to.
He called his aunt Naomi back first, at Dean’s strong recommendation (actually it was more like a command) and she was pleased when she’d heard Gabriel had re-established contact and furious when she learned what he’d contacted Castiel about.
It didn’t happen quite as Dean planned. Sam arrived and Castiel’s eyes narrowed. After a second, Dean knew why. It was subtle, in fact almost undetectable, but both of them smelled Rowena’s perfume in the backwash of Sam’s passing. Castiel and Dean traded knowing glances as Sam started a laundry and ducked into the shower.
“Who are you?” the man said in a deep voice, that shook a few times. Under the dome light he looked to be in his thirties, quite tanned, and worn by worry, or work. “Where are you taking me?” He opened the water bottle with fumbling hands, and drank thirstily, never taking his eyes from Dean.
Dean said, “I really love you a lot, you know.”
“Goddamnit, you are not going to ghost me!” Cas yelled, and chased Dean out of the store while his employees and customer watched open-mouthed. Dean, realizing that Cas was gaining too fast to allow him safe entry to his car, put up his hands and said, “Not the face, please.”
“Sam, aren’t you happy for me?”
“You like that better than just about anything, doncha?” Dean says, voice low and sexy.
Dean had just come in his pants.
Cas got busy. He learned early that closer to the root Dean preferred a hand. He loved a thumb on his taint while Cas’s fingers swirled in his loose and lovely ass; every part of Cas’s ingenious hands and expertly pumping mouth was put to the test. Dean’s come tasted almost coppery and he groaned with the last of the spasms, belly tightening one last time as he arched his back.
Breakfast was long behind him as Dean bustled through the door, eager to learn whether his houseguest had trashed his apartment.
“You know Dean?”
“Can I rub your feet?” Castiel asked, gesturing to Dean’s feet.
Castiel groaned, “I think I tore a muscle.”
“He in the habit of coming to your place of business and goin’ off like a rooster on a fencepost?”
“No, I -“ Dean said, gasping a little, “I was just thinking that I should probably quit drinking.”
“So what’s the occasion?” Dean inquired, fighting the temptation to vault the counter (
Despairing of sounding casual, as he saw Novak Clinic come up on his phone, Dean opted for being brief. “‘Lo,” he said.
Castiel didn’t wait; he was emotionally and physically wrung-out.
“Who’s here?” a woman said as she walked into the room. “What was the bang?”
Cas was not worried.
“Not until you know what you’re committing to,” Cas said. He chuckled, then turned a little and put his hand on the wall. “If you fly with me, you are committing to be my bonded nest companion for the rest of our lives.”
“Please don’t talk like this,” Castiel begged. “Stop being childish and for my sake attempt to be civil.”
with Cas he hates actually
“Your brother already thinks the worst of me.”
Dean was still surprised, but answered the question. “No, just subscribers. With all the stuff happening to banking for sex workers I’ve had to get really creative about keeping things legal.”
“No,” he said.
The man stiffened. “I’m not crazy!” Then he seemed cowed, for some reason, and slumped in his seat a little. Apologetically, he said, “I was told that I would be abused for being set apart by God.”
Gabe looked solemn. “Maybe it had something to do with the sweet, sweet time I made with someone’s er close relative,” Gabe said.
“There’s always more angst coming,” I signed back. Sam snorted and Dean looked annoyed because I was signing way too fast for him. “But he says he loves me.”
There was a stunned silence. “You recognize me?”
“See that you do,” Dean said, acknowledging it. He took a bite of the meatloaf and laughed and groaned at the same time. “Fantastic,” he said with his mouth full.
“It wasn’t,” Dean said, shaking his head and making a wry face. “I don’t find nightmares about my mother burning to death sexy.”
“But you so often do amuse the crap out of me. It’s one of the reasons I like having you around. I just don’t think I could ever get tired of it.”
He’d held her hand (with her permission, of course) and encouraged her. Once, she’d winked at him. It had been amazing. Sam loved him so much he had wanted to share his child’s birth and Eileen was cool enough that she’d let him, and it had been, without question, one of the peak experiences of his life.
“I’m - I don’t know what to - to even ask!” Dean stumbled. He moved closer to the counter, drawn in by the man’s steady gaze and faint, professional smile, and halted where he could still see the boards full of the names of different varieties. The man’s name tag read CAS. His eyes were abnormally blue; Dean assumed they were coloured contact lenses.
“Um,” Dean’s voice said. “No drugs. Some major spell-work and one fuck of a team effort, but you, uh, you don’t actually have a physical body at the moment. You’re sort of a … you’re an AI, until we reunite you with your body, which is, uh, sleeping right now.”
, ‘scuse me,” Dean muttered.
Very slowly, tears formed in Castiel’s eyes. They overflowed once, and Dean said, “Aw jeez, sweetheart, why are you sad?”
“Lord knows what that man will do next – but rescuing chickens does seem like a Dean thing to do.”
“Oh peachy, more body swapping wacky fun,” Dean said.
“Well, you weren’t at
“We can fix that,” Cas said. “Or perhaps dress the wound.” He walked over to where Dean, irresolute, still stood by his car, and kissed him. Not hard, not long, but definitely announcing that Cas had ‘cut Dean out of the herd’.
Dean warned him that Crowley was likely to do everything possible to make him feel shitty, that Dean had lied to him or withheld something, just to piss him off or hurt him and through him, Dean.
“Have a good day at work,” Castiel said, and kissed him again.
Dean: So basically you mad cause me gettin high, coating myself in lube and going to town reminded you how lonely you are so you thought you’d bust into your 1/2
“What?”
“Yeah,” Dean said, reaching the plates down and grabbing some forks. Castiel looked at him, and he got out knives as well. Dean wanted to know how he did that, when most of the time he came off so meek and mild.
“I thought that’s what we were,” Dean said quietly.
It was why he was here. He’d been thoughtful, afterwards, remembering how happy and at peace he’d felt during the service. After, when he’d had a few weeks to brood as Sam and Jess moved states and honeymooned, he felt insane with jealousy and angry that Sam was settled and he was not. He felt irritation at himself for being like a foolish adolescent with his green-eyed, jealous pet monster, as if Sam’s current happiness was somehow a poor reflection on him, or indeed anything to do with him, or how he’d help raise him; he was convinced that he’d never experience anything like Sam’s happiness, because he was too scared and too lazy to look for it.
Their usual evening text orgy started like this —
“Don’t you have a honeymoon to fly to?” Dean asked hoarsely. His mouth felt like a desiccated pit toilet and his eyelids were sandy flaps of canvas.
They went upstairs. Dean fitted his hand into Cas’s as they stood next to each other, and he waited with fear and amusement for what Cas would say.
She wasn’t here to help or hinder right now, whether she was on speed dial or not. He found his flashlight and looked for Castiel. Dean heard a groan, a heartstopping noise that made it sound like he was crazed with pain, and he finally located him in a corner of the library. There was a fluttering noise, but he didn’t rise. He seemed surrounded by shadows, and Dean’s heart started to hammer. What had gotten into the bunker that could hurt Castiel?
“Dean, come here. Kiss me. I wasn’t kidding. I’ll date you until you walk away.”
“Are we flirting?”
“I’m not pretending anything.”
“He was a superb tactician, at times,” Castiel said.
“I had nothing to do with that, Eileen did everything including the graphic design and I don’t want anyone to forget that,” Dean said furiously, and Castiel outraged him by another soft laugh. It was very gentle, not a mean laugh at all, more like an ‘aren’t you wonderful’ laugh. Castiel continued, “Anybody as kind-hearted as you needs a total bastard like me in his life.”
“Not if I go back to being completely silent as far as you and Sam are concerned, and never driving.”
If he hadn’t had Baby, his vintage Impala, to cradle him, and keep him firmly in the here and now, he might have floated all the way up to the clouds to hang out with the angels, he was so happy.
“What are you doing in a dump like this?” Ash asked. He recognized the name, and that he was local, and loaded, but otherwise was at a loss.
Apparently telling a woman that you can ‘fix’ why she feels that, in her words ‘you’re not that into sex with me’ is : ‘inflammatory’, ‘insulting’ and ‘a classic example of how hard it is to have a mature conversation about anything, including sex, with you’.
“Nobody intends to watch porn,” Dean said. “It just sorta happens.”
“Amen,” Castiel said. He bobbed his head once and then ate neatly, and fast.
“The worst part of today is that with Gabe being here I won’t be able to work on the journal you gave me,” Castiel said fretfully. “I feel like I have to keep at it until it’s done.”
“You were a client?” Cas asked.
Castiel made a noise.
“Almost tripping over your dick when I slung you around,” Cas said, snotty as fuck, and Dean’s expression was clear, as he looked gratified. “You like it. I just have to be very, very careful. I understand.”
“You’re convinced I will.”
“Tell me about your sex work.”
Then he yelled, “The mixtape, where’s the mixtape?”
“Do you really think I’m a power bottom?”
Dean shrugged. “Better him than me.”
Castiel: Sorry lost it there for a second can’t text if you can’t see.
“You would look awesome,” Cas promised.
Castiel’s nose wrinkled. “Perhaps you should wash your face first?” At Dean’s snort, he said, “Dean, you’re a barbarian.”
“I would love to meet her.”
.” The man’s eyes, a remarkable golden brown, were narrowed in anger.
“Are you - are you upset with me in some way?” Castiel asked. “You’re staring.”
“You met him two days ago! He doesn’t love you!”
“You didn’t get to be a gay teenager with the other gay teenagers, and I did, so our experiences are different,” Dean said, trying to keep his voice sympathetic. “It doesn’t make you less hot.”
“I am. I am a very hard worker, I just never got a chance to do what
“So this is it, we’re going to start dating properly.”
Dean’s voice cracked as he turned his bedside lamp on. “I’m Winchester, remember? Not the original?” He never stopped moving the wing oil around, though.
Castiel grinned. “I’m glad we can disagree,” he said.
There was a long pause.
“I don’t know,” Sam said levelly. “I wasn’t there. I was just there afterward, when we were living with having lost you, because you sacrificed yourself for us.”
Garth started giggling at this point. “Dean, you know this all sounds like you’ve gone completely buggo,” he said in a friendly, calm voice, after he stifled his amusement.
There was a pause.
There was a taut silence, which Dean tried and failed to fill with something,
“Not today,” Castiel said. He buried his face in Dean’s neck and whispered, “I won’t fuck you today,” and ground into him in slow ovals of sexual torment, shifting his pelvis and his thighs as if Dean were exercise equipment. It was ludicrous. This guy couldn’t possibly be a virgin. Dean heard himself gasp when Castiel demonstrated that he could kiss Dean very effectively, speed up the grinding and gently scratch at the fabric over one nipple all at the same time.
“I don’t have sex there. Well, not with anyone else but me,” Dean amended. “So it’s set up for one person to manage. Sam helped.”
“It is a ceremonial flight to mark the special trust, friendship and healing that is an everflowing bond between us.”
“As long as
“I didn’t mean that as a prank,” Dean said, offended.
“Are you always this gushy and romantic?”
Dean felt acutely embarrassed. He’d just opened up on this guy and dumped on him without the courtesy of introducing himself. He could feel his father’s ghostly slaps against the back of his head. “Dean Winchester,” Dean said.
“There’s a blankie,” the man said, and giggled. “Which is good, for I musht - must I say! lie down.”
“Not what I asked, Dean.”
Dean: Cas you still there that was out of line.
Gabe didn’t leave for two months. He stuck to the program and found a job and moved out. Gabe testified against the loan sharks, even after death threats. He quit gambling, and opened a candy store with two sets of counters, one for kids and one for adults, and the store won design awards, and he paid back all his loans within five years. Franchisees lined up to get a piece of the “
“Yeah, sorry. I mean, you may not want me to call you that.”
“I’m the guy Cas is banging, and I want y’all to stop yelling at him or you’re gonna catch hands.”
“I bet I don’t,” Dean scoffed. “I run a very high tech business; the drone set-ups alone are a thousand bucks a pop.”
Happy endings all around.
Castiel: About receiving ends.
“Shit,” Dean said, backing away with eyes wide. “I - yeah, follow me,” and he got into his car like an automaton.
I frowned. “If you love me, why are you being so hateful to me?”
Dean closed the door of his room and wished Cas luck.
“I, uh, I made a bid thinking I was getting a chicken.”
They watched TV. Trying to get Castiel caught up with current trends in TV shows gave Dean a headache, until he figured out that the Great British Baking Show was probably exactly the right speed.
“Work helps,” Cas said. He sounded like he had no fight left in him at all.
Dean giggled guiltily, hearing about it later. Months after, he bought Inias earplugs and a sleep mask for Christmas, and openly wondered if there was any surviving surveillance footage of Cas during their epic ‘Meet Puke’. Inias woodenly said, “Do you want me to try to locate that, sir?” and frowned as Cas and Dean looked at each other and Cas said, “The vase in the hotel.”
Castiel was dignified. “I can wear used, and you’re still being generous.”
“Not ratholes, chicken coops,” Dean said. He ran the tip of his tongue over an inch of the top of Cas’s left ear, and Cas trembled down to his socks.
His wings seemed to crumple. He shook himself a little and then folded them up so he was no longer in any danger of touching Dean.
Dean had been hearing variants of this his whole life, and avoided answering by saying,“Castiel’s too long. Cas is better.”
“What? No! What - are you high? You want to kiss me in a church fucking parking lot?”
, Dean thought. “I didn’t want to make it all about me.”
“I won’t be when I die,” Cas promised.
“And you’re okay with that.”
I wasn’t interested in her interestingly phrased, but not very effective, assurances. “What do you want with me? Wasn’t I dead, or asleep? I remember something about being - it was very
“I cleared my schedule,” Castiel said.
get going there’s no telling how much and how hard you can hurl.”
“Where the hell did you get all this stuff?”
Dean: Sometimes the only way you can measure a wall is to lean a ladder up against it.
Dean’s voice reached into the bottom of his register and scraped along the ground for a while. “Either way my drinking will always be the perfect break up excuse.”
To Castiel, he whispered, “Okay, I trust you. But as long as
“He was in a cult called Haven, which apparently has compounds all over the western US and started in Oregon.”
“Oh boy,” Dean said.
“I’ll come to your work, won’t take a minute.”
“Because, my honeybee of sunshine -” Dean said, and the pet name had a tiny edge, “He’s a bitter, evil, tortured, vengeful guy who always believes he’s the wronged party. So you need to know exactly what happened.”
Castiel: I hope you’ve learned a valuable lesson.
“Sure, but he won’t go for it unless we wear flower crowns,” Dean said apologetically.
“You’re thinking of major life changes,” the man said. He looked away. “So am I.”
“Nope,” Dean said. “You get better looking when you drink.”
Dean dragged the man to his car and got him into the passenger side about the time he came to. Dean handed him a water bottle and said, “Do up your seatbelt.”
“It’s for us,” Dean said. “There’s the world, and there’s us.”
Castiel rose and fetched another mug, asked his cousin how he took it, and put it in front of him. They sat down, Castiel frowning at Dean as he rolled his eyes.
“Is that my name?” I heard myself ask.
One sunny Wednesday, he went to pick up insomnia gummies for Sam (
For the next half hour, the two of them poked around the internet, with Dean ‘driving’, until finally Dean opened a church website and Castiel said excitedly,“Oh, my goodness!”
“I made dinner, there’s pot roast in the slow cooker,” Castiel said invitingly.
He disconnected. “Can you believe it they’re threatening to sue me for leaving the reception.”
“C’mere, you,” he said to Castiel, who followed him into the bathroom and watched him close the door with a question in his eyes.
Castiel: Before you ask he was great in bed.
noise,” Dean said, rounding on him. “In fact, I’m being a fucking idiot letting you do this, but I’m throwing you in the deep end for a reason. If you can’t be good with
to get on the phone and round up every chicken crate he can, and the biggest truck to transport them. If he’s serious about chickens he’ll know people.”
“What? No, she’s fine.”
“I don’t understand how I can feel this bad and still move,” Cas admitted. He started to find his clothes, moving like a human-sloth hybrid.
“I’m going to hang out with you until you don’t want to hang out with me any more,” Cas said.
He had not. He decided to go back to the church after work, to talk to the priest.
They were on the bed, half naked, trying to show off their kissing skills. Nothing on earth had ever felt like this to Dean. He was always the boss of a sexual encounter, in total control. Cas palmed his dick through his pants with one hand and caressed his scalp with the other and Dean exclaimed and grabbed onto him harder.
Smiling internally, Dean said, “Dean Winchester, my place. You are going to have a shower, a change of clothes and a meal, and then we’ll figure out where you’re going next.” He flicked his gaze over the man’s face. “You got a name?”
“You okay with us wearing chicken costumes? I mean, how we met was so romantic.”
“Hydrate?”
“No more destination honeymoons for me,” Dean said. “You know I hate to fly.”
“I wish you hadn’t said that,” the man said resentfully. He rolled over, barked twice, and wiped his mouth after the spray. He lay back down. Dean decided to keep an eye on him; he was too impaired to leave alone.
Dean smiled and shook his head.
“Yeah, Cas.” He didn’t bother with the rest of his name, and it was a relief to lose it in the mists of ‘ten minutes ago’. “All of these books are mine.”
“Oh,” Castiel said. He panted for a second, his eyes out of focus.
“There’s something else.”
“Do I get to tell people we’re engaged?”
“Yeah,” Sam said. He signed, “We get it,” and Eileen made a face and laughed. Sam put an arm around her and they cuddled. Eileen was beaming at me.
Cas was whispering in his ear again, no doubt believing that Gabe was doing his best to eavesdrop. “Did you need that as much as I did?”
The wet towels helped Castiel cool off. His breathing was now moderately fast and shallow. “Winchester, I understand what’s wrong now. The wings are not complete. They are being blocked from finishing the molt.”
“Oh,” Dean said into the pillow.
Castiel took his qualms out and shared them with the class.
Castiel: You date men and women.
“What the hell,” Dean said flatly. “I ain’t Christ. I ain’t even Christ-like. In fact, I’d have to say that damned near every adult male I know – with the exception of my Dad – is closer to being Christ-like than me.”
“I don’t know what to say, Winchester.”
There was a bearded man sitting in the living room when Dean, moving slowly and cautiously, came in. He was wearing a wildly orange, unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt and skater shorts, and reading what looked like a textbook. His eyes bugged out his head, and he dropped the book with a loud clunk.
“I’m not cursing at you,” Dean said, controlling his voice, “I’m beginning to get a picture of the folks you used to live with, and I’m hatin’ it, just hatin’ it.”
Dean: Okay princess put the phone down before I send you a dick pic.
“I have a small inheritance from my uncle’s estate! She says that the last time she looked in on the account, it should be enough for schooling; you said I’d need to do that to make my way and I’ve been thinking about it.”
For someone with so little experience, Castiel sure knows how to ring Dean's chimes.
Dean turned toward Castiel. “Do you have a preference about what to thaw for dinner tomorrow night, or do you want to get takeout?”
Dean said, “How can a dick be ‘admirable’? It’s not like it helps little old ladies cross the street.”
“Now what?” Cas said.
“So, do you own this joint,” Dean said, asking a question without ever making a sound of enquiry. He got out of bed, stark naked, and approached Michael, who showed immediate and quite justified alarm. It was all Cas could do not to laugh.
Dean was still shaking his head at Cas’s stricken expression when he realized he was blocking traffic, and laughing to himself, when Cas parked in the driveway of a small house, and waved to Dean to park behind him.
“You’re going to think I was lying to you. You’re going to hate me,” Dean said. Cas thought he sounded like he might weep.
Castiel watched him with a small frown.
“Yours is admirable.”
After a minute or so, Dean realized that Castiel was mocking the Servant and he started to laugh. This wound Castiel up, and he started flinging his arms around and exaggeratedly pulling out the final syllables of words, and finally, after a truly terrible and mostly incomprehensible impromptu sermon about the evils of modernism and the perils of socialism, they were both on the floor, laughing their asses off. Cas had this high, breathy chuckle that made Dean never want to stop laughing.
He sighed. “‘Cause I didn’t ask you first. If I had, you’d have said, ‘no thanks!’ and then I wouldn’t be – ” and then Dean realized that talking to Castiel about it was a bad idea, so he tried to tie the conversation off. “I didn’t get your consent, so I shouldn’t have tried to kiss you,” Dean said abruptly.
It was a little after lunch, which he had skipped, when Dean’s phone vibrated. He didn’t recognize the number, and answered anyway.
“You are so,” Cas said, like a little kid. He was ignoring his ex, and the new husband, who were screaming into the phone that he’d wrecked everything.
“Yeah,” Dean said jokingly. “If we’re going to start the day off with a bang, maybe that’s not the one we want.”
“Why would he do that?” Castiel said.
Dean, who could control neither his breathing nor his erection, slid his hands down Castiel’s back and pulled gently on his ass. “What do you feel comfortable doing?” He brought his hands back up to rest chastely on the small of Castiel’s back.
Dean: Yeah sorry Cas someone came to the door and then I had to hit the head.
Dean interrupted him. “Easy peasy, we do an exorcism,” he said.
“My mother was very angry with them when she cut contact. It was unpleasant,” Castiel said.
Dean was on his knees already.
“Are you a degenerate gambler, like Aunt Naomi said?”
“Everything okay with baby Mary?” Benny asked sympathetically, as Dean paced. He and Garth had been watching Dean stumble around ‘the goldfish bowl’, which is what they called Dean’s office, trying to work off his nerves.
Dean, as graceful as any geisha who ever conducted a tea ceremony, poured out another one with a tender smile.
Castiel: I have no idea what you’re talking about.
“As you wish. I must tell you that unless you help me with one last thing, I will be quite sick for a while - I don’t know how long - I certainly won’t be able to hunt with you.”
The wings, now bald, were pink and grey in a sort of broad camouflage pattern, or like the skin of a pig, maybe. An angel-piggy? That made Dean shake his head at himself. His wings had brushed against Dean’s clothing and face as he’d had struggled to stay upright, so he knew they were dense and muscular, and radiating heat.
“You told me you were lovers and he was an asshole to you.”
Somebody in P-town started calling him Dr. Frog, which he absolutely hated, so it stuck. He kind of did look like a frog. He and Dean had ‘dated’ twice (hooked up more than that) and Dean didn’t exactly hate him because the sex had been way hotter than he expected, but Ferg was a manipulative and bitter man with a grievance against his mother in particular and the world in general that made you wonder if he only got into veterinary medicine to give him an excuse to cut into something alive. Which was a horrible thing to think but plausible as hell once you met the guy. And then there was the whole ‘did he or didn’t he roofie me’ thing. He was still having trouble dealing with that so he did the best thing he could, he completely shoved it away, until he tried to date again.
“Shh!” Castiel said his nose wrinkling.
“We could wear chicken costumes,” Cas said.
“I would have flown him to Saturn, but he was angry and tired and wanted to go home,” Castiel said. “I admit it, I was disappointed.” Sam’s face as he realized Castiel was describing the behaviour of a toddler was priceless.
It served him right for not checking the website first. He’d driven ten minutes for this, with the sunset in his eyes the whole way, only to pull on the front door handle, and find the church locked. The doors were solid. There were no windows to peek through. Dean sagged a little, and then thought, with relief, that at least no one had witnessed him yanking on the door to so little effect.
Cas and Dean did not, in fact, wear flower crowns. They choreographed a piece to go with the ‘hold me kiss me’ song and, wearing matching blue tuxes with black sequinned lapels, they rolled it out at their wedding as their first dance. They danced part of it like a sword dance – with poultry crooks. The kids screamed in amusement and the pictures were, as Dean said afterward, “Simply epic.”
Go to the Magic Wall of Books, pick something out and read it!
“I live in Arlington.”
“My god,” Dean breathed when he had enough air for the job.
“Sounds like regret,” Castiel said. He didn’t exactly sound offended, but as if he might be wondering why Dean regretted it.
“I could pray with you,” he said. He sat next to Dean, and Dean experienced a moment of panic.
“Seriously?”
Dean: I’d like to date you but grief is hard and kinda all-consuming and it’s a tough thing to share a person with.
“I try to pay attention,” Castiel said. “What you were doing felt wonderful.”
“Thanks for getting
“Try it with butter and maple syrup, it’s really good,” Castiel promised.
“I’ll be counting how many peas you eat,” Castiel said sternly, in what appeared to be another low-key attempt at humor.
Dean, expecting to hear Cas start spouting theology, was astonished when instead, Cas said, “If I tried to kiss you, would you punch me?”
Dean barked a laugh. “Not yet,” he said, looking around appreciatively. The store was immaculate, although the pungent smell of weed was impossible to ignore. “What would be the perfect variety for ’just got home from work and don’t want to lose my motivation for cooking and dishes and laundry before I collapse in front of the TV?”
“Dean. I know it’s a big concession, thank you.”
“Stand aside, Hubs, you can’t protect him forever,” Dean said.
“Don’t worry, the setup ain’t exactly artificial, but it ain’t exactly real-time, either. You’re safe, even if it feels weird.”
“I could bread and bake them. Normally I’d make salad to go with it but I didn’t see any ingredients.”
Castiel: Dean.
Castiel looked blank for a second. “Jimmy says he’s Team Rowena,” Castiel said.
“Dean, don’t joke about it.”
“Well,” Castiel said primly, “That’s good to know, although I don’t like you saying bad things about Gabe’s mom. Is it okay if Gabe stays overnight and leaves in the morning?”
“You think I’m hot.” Castiel spoke with such grave innocence that Dean felt like his underwear was being torched.
Castiel: That’s the sexiest thing you’ve said so far.
“What about you!?” Castiel asked, almost belligerently. “Would you be a wonderful husband?”
Sam’s cheekbones went pink. “I’m not – involved with Rowena.”
Castiel was hesitant. “Can you show me… the internet?”
Dean: Are you ready to take it to the next level?
that look promised a ‘serious conversation about Castiel’, later. Castiel asked Gabe if he wanted to talk about Gamblers Anonymous, and Gabe said no, and then he looked at Dean and said, with a touch of his normal flair, “Well, I ain’t an alcoholic! Would it be too much to ask for a drink?”
“Yeah, but don’t worry, you’ll always be my friend.”
“But it perhaps concerns Castiel,” the priest said.
“Anyway, I have news,” Castiel said. “While you were out, the phone rang, so I answered it, and it was Naomi. She told me that the refugee family she took in prevented an armed man from entering her home. They stole his gun and his car and his phone, shot holes in his shoes and made him walk home. He was looking for you and intends to shoot you dead, although Horacio and Hilario let him know that wasn’t a smart idea.”
He tried not to drool but Gabe caught something on his face, obviously, because his smirk went from unusually vacant to being a little more tight, and less obvious. Dammit.
“How’d it go?”
“We were making a lot of noise ourselves, you know, panting, grunting, moaning,” Dean said suggestively.
“Is this foreplay?” Dean murmured.
Again, he felt suffused with warmth and love, even as they hurtled through the galaxy together.
“That’s what he says.”
It took about fifteen minutes for Dean to run through everything he remembered. Castiel said, when it was over, in a carefully neutral tone of voice, “But it sounds like he assaulted you. And possibly drugged you.”
“Sam! Sam!” Cas yelled. “I think he may be serious.”
Dean’s smile was tight. “You’re just busting my balls. Do you want me to say it?”
He pulls his pinky out and with the same slow, swirly motion, replaces it with his index finger. With the natural curve of his finger, pointing toward Cas’ back, he starts the movement he mentally refers to as “The Impala Windshield Wiper”, a steady back and forth motion parallel to the base of Cas’s spine, through about forty-five degrees of travel, back and forth, slow and gentle and tender. Cas pushes against his finger and moans with almost every stroke.
“Dean, you’re a man, and you have needs.”
“Don’t worry, I will be.” Gabe seemed to think the conversation was over, and got out of the car.
He took a breath. “And you? How do you think the dream fits into your life?”
The angel woke up.
“Is that what alcohol does, make more impulses?” Castiel said. “I don’t think that’s good in the long term.”
“May I speak to you privately?” Dean said.
“Not for lack of trying,” Dean said. Lisa was the closest he’d managed it, and he’d almost died of boredom - outside the bedroom, because Lisa had insane skills - before she called him on his shit and arranged his departure. Not his finest hour, he owned to himself.
There was a man who looked like he’d been brought to life from a Punch and Judy puppet show, yelling at Cas in the store.
I’m at work but I’ll poke my head in at lunch.
“That’s not what I meant,” Dean whispered. He could hear Castiel getting ready to stand up and tried not to sound too needy as he said, “I meant – lie down with me.”
Dean nearly spat his out his coffee.
“You’re bi?”
“Business casual, very nice,” Dean said, nodding.
Dean winked at Cas.
“Aw, sweet
“He’s still engaging with us,” Dean pleaded.
“How is it, having a new family member?” Castiel asked.
Sam was on the highway, headed north, as part of his ongoing mission to be the den mom to every other hunter between Minnesota and the Mexican border. He needed the time alone; losing more comrades to Michael – and then losing Jack – had left him grieving and wild with anger at himself and his circumstances.
“Give me the bad news first.”
“Your hand feels – comforting,” Castiel said.
Dean had been more or less living with Castiel for four months. They had never said anything about love to each other and some days hardly spoke except regarding their household. The sex was still spectacular, and frequent enough to make certain parts of their bodies, like their pubic bones and knees, continuously sore.
“A bigger concession,” Dean said, his voice rising in volume, “than me trying to not freak the fuck out after you springing on me that some dude living in a corner of your head wants to bone me? And that this means you hand over control of the vessel but you’re watching on Pornhub live for the duration?” Dean coughed and laughed at the same time. “I mean, how the fuck would any of that work, let alone stay a secret, what with Sam and Rowena poking around and asking me if I’m okay all the fucking time.”
“I don’t understand that reference,” Castiel said. “Should I look it up?”
“I have to avoid bruising,” Dean said snootily.
“Wow,” Dean said, a smile blossoming on his face. “That sounds…. I never downsized after Sammy moved out; you can have your own room.”
“Still not what I asked, Dean. Do you want me to repeat –”
Dean’s expression froze and slowly morphed into a pained smile.
“Bankruptcy.”
Cas waved her off with a very forced smile, and once again had to manhandle Dean away from the door.
“You’ll only save some of them, and most of the people who take them will be lying when they say they want them for pets, so most of them are going to get eaten, one way or another,” the vet said implacably.
When they sat down at the kitchen table, Cas said, “I have good news and I have bad news.”
“Do you always put your friends first?” Cas asked. It was almost flirtatious, but Dean didn’t take it as a compliment.
“Fine.” Aristocratic annoyance made itself known in Rowena’s voice. “I’ll only be able to revive the AI a few more times, so if you can’t sort it, we’re getting close to the end.”
“Really, there’s two guest houses,” Dean said.
Dean felt overwhelmed. He swallowed, trying to understand what was happening, and realizing that all he could do was trust his angel.
Cas sounded dubious, and then cheerful. “If you say so. What’s the forecast for an overdose of dick?”
“Your soul makes you bigger on the inside than even God could say for sure,” Castiel thought, and they paused in their headlong flight to stare up at a beautiful nebula.
“I’d like you to carefully consider my proposition before you find make your final decision with respect to the funds,” Gabriel said, at least according to Castiel.
Dean chuckled again. “Well, thank God for that. So you’re homeless?”
“Well?”
Gabe’s mischievous face grew even more sly. “More respect than you showed me, slobbering all over my cousin this morning. ‘Traumatized’ is pretty much the only possible way to characterize how I –“
Castiel spent a lot of time volunteering with the other strays from Haven, getting them set up in their own lives now that the Servant wasn’t forcing them to work like brutes.
Castiel made a little noise and fainted, clunk, on the couch.
“Bowling alley,” Dean said.
“It sounds like a girl’s name either way,” Cas said. “Excuse me,” he said, and he puked into a waist-high decorative vase, very neatly. It was like watching a cat sick up. There was no way in fucking hell he was developing a puke fetish, it was Cas who was so intriguing. Dean sighed, picked the vase up, took it to the horrified desk clerk and said, “Put it on room 421, whatever the cleaning charge is.”
“You have a roommate? Guess you were so excited about Mary you forgot to mention it,” Benny said.
“I’ll need a spouse before I get any of those,” Dean said. He realized that he was fishing for Dr. Novak’s marital status, and didn’t want to sound like it, so he pushed the conversation back to his precipitous entrance into the exciting world of poultry management. “How do I get the crates? Where do I take the chickens? Can they be rescued?” Dean asked.
“He’s loaded.”
“I can’t really wait. I’m so wound right now that I almost want to ask you to cuff me so I can’t play with myself.”
Dean said, “I’ll be on my cell.”
A lot of people (basically, all of Eileen’s relatives, who, being on another continent, weren’t getting much of a vote) thought it was nuts that she was letting her brother-in-law (general consensus:
To Cas’s gasping astonishment, this activated two drones, which rose, hovered four feet above the floor, and started to stream video, as he could now see from a monitor.
“We have healed each other. I have healed you with touch, as you did just now.”
“Technically it’s a salvage operation or auto wreckers,” Cas said. “Not a dump.”
I said the first thing that came into my mind, and I was not polite. “I do not want to be your friend.”
Castiel: It’s normal for me to be lonely my husband just died but why the hell are you alone?
Sam and Eileen, having other concerns, didn’t ask too many questions, but Sam had plenty after he dropped by Dean’s apartment for an Eileen-sanctioned break to grab a quick beer, and met Castiel for the first time. Castiel had been so nervous, and so afraid of causing Sam offence, that he did everything but call Sam, ‘sir’.
“I would like to apologize without reservation for anything I said to cause offense,” Jimmy said. “I was forward and invasive to your privacy and I gave Castiel terrible advice.”
Dean, entranced, watched the man attempt to walk along the top of a beached log.
“Your reputation has been saved, hallelujah. Now, let’s plan our real wedding and really give Sam something to cry about.”
Dean got home at 5:30 with his ass dragging at the thought of having to rustle up a meal for two. A mouthwatering ‘dinner’s ready’ aroma brought him upright at the door.
Castiel gave him a look, just one look, and Dean sniped back, “I didn’t say, ‘stop working on my feet’.” Castiel smiled a little and smoothed his thumbs gently over the soles of Dean’s feet.
“What?” Dean said, his empty stomach lurching. “I bought one chicken. A chicken. A single chicken.”
“If he’s still here tomorrow, I’ll be reconsidering pacifism,” Castiel said.
car, Dean, and you can leave in it, if you prefer,” Cas said, not casually, but calmly. “I paid for a meal, nothing more.” He looked back over his shoulder, narrowly avoided batting his eyes at Dean and said, with an archly histrionic sigh, “I didn’t think we were going to be breaking up quite this fast, especially since I never got the chance to rim you and, Dean, I was so looking forward to it,” at which point Dean made a little whiny exhalation that could have meant anything from enthusiasm to disgust.
“Seattle.”
“I can’t help who my parents were,” Cas said. “I’m giving the money away as fast as I can.”
“I know you crave the company of women,” Castiel said. He sounded sympathetic.
Dean got him breathing properly before the man could get really scared at the close call. He spluttered for a moment, and then coughed occasionally, leaning into Dean’s arms for support. “Where am I?” the man said fearfully. He coughed fitfully again, tried to stand and did such a shitty job of it that he decided in the end to lie down.
They talked for hours; Dean fell asleep on the sofa like he belonged there. Castiel watched him do it. He got a pillow under his head and threw a sheet over him – it was too hot for anything else – and went to bed, his mind just whirling.
“Doesn’t really matter what I think, Dean,” Cas said. His face, looking up, was a mask of deviltry. “What matters is that you take it for as long and as hard as I give it to you.”
Her eyes widened. “Seriously? He’s gonna need crates,” Sue said.
a family without the cheap physical stuff, unless you’re paying for in vitro fertilization,” Cas said patiently.
“Needs I willingly sacrifice - well, most of the time, I’m still jerking off as required - to be with you.”
Dean slapped his hands on his knees, like he was getting ready to go. “If you want to tell me this dream was from Satan, I’m going to beg to differ and wish you a good evening.” He rose.
Castiel was at work while Dean handed over the last of the chickens - he’d volunteered his yard, not his time. The woman who loaned the mobile coops to Castiel came back for them and Dean helped her get everything into the truck, with help from the boys.
“Cas, you worry too much for someone so good-looking,” Dean teased. “Besides, I’m a ‘meatatarian’.”
