“Are you alright, John?” It came with furrowed eyebrows. John nodded, trying to catch his breath.
Something in the air, or about how good a mood he was in just gave John the courage to speak about his feelings.
“Uh… all right?” John said slowly, a little overwhelmed. “Right now?”
Sherlock spun around and grabbed John’s arm, yanking him back. He leaned down and connected their lips, wrapping his arms around John as tightly as was possible.
“No looking!” John yelled, smacking Sherlock’s hand when he tried to reach for the mirror. “I’m not done yet!”
“Hello,” the person greeted. Once they were closer John could see that it was Sherlock, with impeccable makeup and curls that seemed a little out of control. They suited him even more in person, John saw. (He hadn’t thought that that was possible.)
He felt crushed; the first time he’d allowed himself to have feelings for someone.
When the man finally walked away, John walked into the kitchen and made his favorite tea, unable to wipe the smile from his face.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and pointed at a bottle.
And Sherlock did something he’d never thought would be a result of this ordeal: he smiled. He smiled, and wrote back to the person.
“I know,” John sighed.
“Well,” John said, standing up. He could feel his phone vibrating a mile a minute. “That was fun. Now, I’m going to call my sister and explain to her what just happened before she sends the police.”
“What do you think, my dear Watson?“ Sherlock’s eyes seemed to glimmer in the sunlight as he pushed the door open forcefully, leading them both into the dimly lit café.
It was nice. Really. Sherlock would turn on some vinyl record and then curl himself around John’s body. Maybe he’d want to talk about some article he read concerning some sort of scientific discovery, or just listen to the music. It wasn’t uncommon for him to fall asleep, either. John didn’t mind; Sherlock barely got enough sleep as it is, who was he to refuse it? Besides. It was kind of nice to have something familiar next to him as the moon rose and the stars revealed themselves.
He had never wanted this life, this home, this mind. Yet here he was, with sore eyes and a stiff back, in an over-perfumed room with too-heavy clothes.
Sherlock nearly died when John’s lips pressed against his.
And when he got home, Sherlock, instead of his usual sitting and thinking, was at the open window, coaxing a melody out of his violin.
Both of their phones began vibrating nonstop as John grinned at the camera and Sherlock sat speechless.
At first, he’d thought the message on the wall could have been from Sherlock, but that was just his mind letting him fantasize. First off, Sherlock’s handwriting was different than that of the note. It was messy, as if his mind moved too fast for his hand (which it did) and he couldn’t be bothered to care (which he couldn’t).
But oh, the shock of remembering came in the morning when he rolled over and saw Sherlock’s bright eyes inches from his own. The latter smiled, either not noticing or not caring about the surprised expression on John’s face.
“And today I’m going to be doing Sherlock’s makeup,” John blurted, giving Sherlock a reassuring smile that he hoped said
John found himself looking at dark eyes and darker eyelashes. A stray curl had fallen in between them. He was conscious of the firm grip the boy’s gloved hand had on his own.
“There’s some in the drawer,” Sherlock said, tapping his feet. “Come on, I haven’t got all day! I’ve got to meet Lestrade in fifteen minutes.”
they dying down, plaguing him less and less?
His head snapped up as he heard the muffled running and shouting through the thin wall that stood to his left. He turned to go back the way he came, moving quickly.
John stared at nothing in particular, trying to process the person who was Sherlock Holmes.
He felt John’s hands move to his hair, where they knotted themselves into his locks. He felt a flush paint itself from his ears to the tip of his nose, but didn’t want to pull away. Ever.
"Well go on then," Sherlock's tongue went numb and his stomach felt tight and fuzzy and tumbly and so many other horrid things as he carefully tore open the paper, the box smelling so wonderfully of John. He gasped, pulling off the lid and revealing the contents.
oh dear, how do I explain...I've been so busy with studying for exams I haven't had any time to write, and this chapter is SO tiny I'm so sorry. I want you all to know I have not given up! This story should be done in about 5 more chapters I hope to get done over half-term and possibly winter break as well. I love you all so very much, kisses and love for your support cuties xxx
he told himself belatedly. He ought to be panicking. She was not what she appeared to be.
"How clever my opponents are."
Sherlock leaned forward and picked her up, wincing a little bit.
"Of course," John says. He looks down. His voice is insincere. "Enough for a lifetime. Far too much."
"Um," John half-smiles, the expression bleeding into a wince. "Now, I apparently play a role for a while. There will be an accident? Or something. They were working through the details last night. I have some practice planning fake funerals, so—"
"Earth goes round the sun," John said, stretching out his leg to toe at the box. "Got that, now?"
Mycroft speaks with Alex Garrideb.
The door opens, then shuts. Silence remains in their wake.
When he closed his eyes he was back in the morgue at St Caedwalla's. Sherlock was on the slab, slack-faced and grey-skinned. His eyes were closed.
"John?" Sherlock's voice. Concerned.
"Wiggins."
He'd taken the train back to London, laden down with bags and gifts and toddler, his back aching and his head pounding and a sick mounting sense of worry in his gut.
"You're not convinced," Sherlock says. He stops walking, crouches down to examine the ground.
"Yes," he said. "So I see."
Rosie had just turned two years old when John finally sold his little place in the suburbs and returned to Baker Street.
John glanced up from the menus, made a shooing motion with his hand. Ah. It appeared that he'd committed to watching a film or—he paused, looked at the screen—a television series.
John presses his lips together, glances at the road, then looks back at Mary.
John sighed, took his own carton to his chair, sat down.
The only thing certain was that he'd need to die.
"You can't just—look, just take a breath, mate. You can't just rush through it."
"Yes, fine," Sherlock said, impatient now. "Child has a dog. Dog gets old and dies. Child is distraught but eventually grows up and moves on. Sad story. We've all heard it before."
Sherlock reluctantly clicked away, checked the outgoing messages (nothing of interest), and the deleted messages (spam, advertisements, and one borderline incoherent email from John's sister). There was nothing to, from, or concerning anyone named Evan Bell.
"Where are you going?"
have been different.
"No," John said. "No, that's—"
"It's possible the killer isn't someone who's been personally offended by the groom at all," Sherlock said. He stared at the wall over John's shoulder, his face at once thoughtful and closed off. "Maybe he's not taking revenge for ill treatment. Maybe thinks he's helping."
"John—" Sherlock started.
"Oh," he said. His voice caught. "That's—good. Good."
She is sitting cross-legged on the sofa, balancing her laptop. She has been browsing job postings. Again.
Well, John supposed it was a night for belated revelations.
Harry gave him a strange look. "An unruly passenger."
"For God's sake, it's not as if we've had a surplus of wedding murders," Sherlock said.
"Um," she said. She looked down at her hands. "It's difficult to explain."
"Sorry," she said. "Just—call me when you can talk, all right?"
He looked at the first file. And then the second, and then the third.
He stood up, looked outside. Could see nothing through the beaded moisture on the fogged glass.
John turned towards him. His face had gone pale.
"What does that have to do with the boyfriend?"
"Well, not really," Janine said. She pouted a bit.
"And ruin the surprise?"
His voice shakes. His hand shakes. He reaches for the bottle.
"Why don't you have a favourite case?"
"I would think you'd consider that a perk."
There was a young woman standing at the edge of the police tape, watching them.
Sherlock is overly conscious of the sound of John's breathing, the gentle whistle of air through his nose. He takes his phone out of his pocket, looks at the time. Nearly midnight, now. The darkness and artificial blue lights have thrown off his internal clock.
John watched them, irritation crawling up his spine.
He registers Mary's panic too late, drags his attention away from Moriarty as Anderson's RV veers too far to the right, tires briefly skidding off the pavement, and then fishtails madly in front of them. John jerks the steering wheel hard, too hard, overcorrecting and sending them careening into the corn.
"I sincerely doubt you've planned a murder," Sherlock said, "which would be my definition of
He finds an inn on the outskirts of Tavistock. It is a small, cosy building, if a bit run down. Warm light glows in the windows. When he steps out of the car the night air is clear and smells faintly of livestock. A dog barks from somewhere in the deepening shadows. He decides the inn will do. It is nothing at all like the Cross Keys.
"He's a ghost," Sherlock said, looking back at John's laptop. "Someone who should be dead to John, but isn't. A former patient, or friend, or—" he trailed off, uncertain and
"Is this—" he pulled back with some difficulty, looked down at Sherlock, wide-eyed and stunned in his bed, his
come back, and so that didn't count.
" he spit the word, hating the way it sounded, hating the way it felt. He stood up, fists clenched, breathing hard. "Stop telling me how understandable it all is. It's not. It's not understandable."
Voicemail.
John breathed out, shifted Rosie against his hip.
"So he says." John shifted in his chair, scratched at the back of his neck.
"Tell him I'm sorry, yeah?" John closed his eyes, pinched his nose. Breathed. Thought about Sherlock's face, bruised and open and searching. "If you could just—"
"How. Badly. Injured."
And then Sherlock
He’d pictured his homecoming, had calculated a number of ways it might have gone. None of those ways had involved John being anything less than happy. None of those ways had involved John asking for someone else’s hand in marriage. None of those ways had involved John walking away.
"I wanted him dead," he said, looking at the orange smear on her cheek. His own voice startled him, too loud in the silence that had fallen between them. "I didn't, not really, you know. But in that moment. I. I just wanted it to be over."
"Sherlock," John said, alarmed now. He stood up, spine creaking. "Sherlock, you still there?"
They were eight miles out of Dartmoor when the Land Rover gave a great shuddering heave and fishtailed.
"You're not—" he said, his face heating. He willed himself to shut up, but was vaguely horrified to see that his mouth kept on running. "You're not actually falling for this, are you? This act? Because that's all it is. An act. And he's fooled you before—"
Sherlock looked up sharply. Lestrade, by the tread, but he always knocked (beholden to unnecessary societal conventions about politeness), always spent the requisite amount of time nattering with Mrs Hudson, never used his key unless it was a life or death situation.
Janine had hailed a taxi, stood waiting for them with the door open and a rather smug smile on her face.
John thought, but did not say out loud.
John is silent for a long time. His chest lifts and falls with steady, comforting breaths underneath Sherlock's head. His heartbeat thumps in Sherlock's ear.
"I think you do."
It had been covered over, and someone had laid down wood boards, but the wood had rotted through. It had given way under his weight.
"Girlfriend?" The surprise in Sherlock's voice seemed at once mocking and genuine.
She looks startled, but recovers with admirable speed. "Um. Well—yes, actually. Signed the papers three months ago, but we were separated for a bit before that. Sorry, but, is that relevant?"
"Um," John says, after a pause. He is wincing, now, as if it pains him to speak. "If you could—if you could possibly not mention—"
How many times now had he shut that door behind him, thinking it was the last?
He'd been tentative with her at first. Uncertain. But he'd taken to her. And she to him.
had shriveled and died there on the stairs.
Sherlock's blood on a morgue floor, those sad and haunted eyes.
Sherlock had nodded. His lips pressed in an uncertain, tentative smile. "Of course." He paused, and John cursed the video's low resolution, because he was not quite able to glean anything from Sherlock's eyes. "Good night, John. And—good luck. With your interview."
anymore, it all stopped. I was empty without it, without something to drive me. When you weren't there anymore, I was—um—I was a lot of things." He steels his face, looks off at the horizon. "Sad. Confused. Guilty. Angry, too, yeah. But the effect you'd had on me it—it didn't just disappear when you were gone. So I was able to keep going. Find work, eventually. And then I met Mary, and—"
He couldn't really say the same for himself.
and had thought:
There was a furtive movement in the corner of the room and John snapped his head up, squinted through the gloom. Moonlight glinted off of unkempt sandy hair and he winced, looked away. When he looked back, Evan Bell was still there.
Allie went on crumbling her scone, an absent motion. "Um. About two years now, I suppose. Since he and his father moved in."
"Can't you tell?"
"Look, something’s come up," he said, cutting her off. "I'm not going to be able to make it tonight. Sorry. For the short notice. I hope it's not too inconvenient."
"Ah," Sherlock says, as if that has cleared everything up.
"You didn't follow?"
"Clearly you have no intention of punching me."
"Caught in unexpected rainstorm, umbrella required."
His father had picked him up, walked towards the car, and Sherlock had watched over his shoulder as the box of puppies receded behind them, farther and farther and farther away—
"Lovely cottage," he'd said.
He regrets a lot of things.
"Well, it's really my blog, isn't it?"
Well. It hadn't been a day worth celebrating, really.
He does not want to leave. He has never wanted to leave.
"You can't approach them as yourself, you'll give the whole thing away. No one's going to attempt to murder me if they think I'm in the middle of an investigation."
"You. You want to retire." All at once, Sherlock felt like laughing.
He shut his eyes.
John thought, as Sherlock clapped his hands together and said, "Drinks!"
"John Watson," says the Abominable Brother. His grip is firm, strong. He has small hands. Surgeon's hands. There is a callus on his right index finger.
"I have made sacrifices," Mycroft had said. "Out of duty. For the sake of my country."
"There's an inheritance involved. Big one. Makes this all a bit messy."
was exactly what Rosie would say to him, seven years later, after he'd accompanied her to Wiggins' funeral.
he thought.
He turned to look at her, took in the tense pinch of her mouth, the line between her eyes, the stiff shoulders. The way the knuckles of her right hand had gone white where she gripped her wine glass.
Rosie dropped her ball, looked at him. Grinned.
"More trouble than it was worth."
Sherlock had breathed in, had studied his brother's face. Nodded. "Well. I hope it was a decent price. Bit embarrassing to be underbid."
Mary dozes against the window. Her hands are folded loosely in her lap, sunlight glinting off of the pretty diamond solitaire he'd given her.
They made plans to leave London behind in September.
She laughed, a sharp startled sound.
It was easy, in the end. It often was.
John had taken a deep breath, waited.
John shook his head, amused. He went on rubbing Sherlock's back, absorbing the warmth of his skin through the thin t-shirt. He did not know how he'd spent so many years resisting the urge to touch, to hold, to claim.
John will not seek this out on his own. Not now, not after everything that has happened. He is not particularly skilled at identifying his own needs. Never has been. It was one of the very first things Sherlock deduced about him, a theory he'd proven right when John had abandoned his cane to sprint behind him across rooftops.
"John," she said. She'd softened, slightly. Her eyes were damp. "Listen to me. Don't—"
The next two hours passed slowly. He'd receive the occasional notification of a call request, read his way through the patient's provided list of symptoms, and then open up a window and dial the patient for a face-to-face video consult.
"Sorry," John said. He shut his eyes, shook his head, breathed out hard through his nose. Opened his eyes. "I'm sorry. Sher—" his voice caught on Sherlock's name. He took another breath, began again. "Sorry. This was a mistake. I shouldn't have—I'll just—go."
"Just—" John said, after he'd caught his breath. "You really can't die on me, now. I'm going to need your brother's help with this one. Not keen on going to prison, yeah? Not for him."
person she might have saved them both and yet—
John laughs, his entire body jerking in Sherlock's arms. He shakes his head, his face pressing into the front of Sherlock's coat. After a moment, he pulls back. Sherlock releases him immediately, not wanting to overstay his welcome.
John drops his hands.
"Oh. Yes. Buccaneer."
been expecting John to laugh.
"All right," John said, and stood up.
Rosie was up in Sherlock's chair, watching, enthralled.
If asked, John would say he tried. But he did not try. Not really. He knows that. It is something he has to live with, if he is indeed going to live. Sherlock had needed him, and John had called him a machine. Sherlock had been a desperate voice on the other end of the line, and John could not talk him down.
He rang the bell. After a moment, he rang it again. And again. Firm, impatient stabs of his finger.
He slams on the brakes and they lurch to a stop, breathing hard.
"I don't think there is anything to say," he said, defeated. "It just—is what it is."
that you'll have to go."
At ten o'clock, Mrs Hudson came up with a tray of nibbles and a bottle of champagne. He shouted her out of the room, then slumped into his chair feeling uncomfortably regretful.
It does not matter. He is already dead.
"You know his name," she said, patient, a little amused.
"I'm a bit parched."
Mary had printed a phone number. Her handwriting was neat. She'd signed her name with a bit of a flourish, adding a little smiley face underneath.
"Yeah, well, nobody's perfect. But you might as well come along."
Sherlock stared back, stared
Sherlock see-sawed his hand in the air. "Usually."
"Spot. Come on," Sherlock said. He gave a firmer tug on the leash, and Trevor reluctantly picked up the sandwich in his formidable jaws, went with him.
John shook his head. "Just—he dragged you out here, all the way from Sussex. Inconvenient, yeah? Might have been easier to go with someone more. Um. Local."
The act of simply holding the pill—considering placing it on his tongue and swallowing it down, of playing the odds—sends an electric jolt down his spine that is hard to resist.
"She's off at university, hardly
"I don't think that I—" John laughs, an unhappy sound, and shifts in his seat.
"How do you know?" Sherlock pressed.
John had stood. Sherlock moved aside to let him through the door, which he shut halfway behind him.
He drank his beer. Made pleasant, encouraging faces as Jeanette talked about her day. Wondered what Sherlock Holmes was up to.
He lifts the lid, studies the dark screen, the weird keyboard with its bright red EXECUTE button where the enter key should be.
And yet they'd shown up, the pair of them in hideous Christmas jumpers, Mary carrying a loaf of fresh-baked bread. Her own recipe. And it had been uneasy and awkward at first, in his time away he'd forgotten how to simply
There was a difference, John knew, between arranging someone's death and being the one to pull the trigger. Pete had managed to stay fairly removed from his messy handiwork until now. Even when he'd shoved Vincent St Clair down the stairs, he hadn't followed him down to have a closer look.
John let his hands drop from Sherlock's shoulders, wrapped his arms around Sherlock's waist inside the warm cocoon of his coat instead, pulled him close. He was tall and angular, sharp hips and elbows. His heart thundered wildly against his ribs.
John pressed his hand hard against his mouth. Breathed in through his nose.
Sherlock had crossed the room towards one of the large industrial refrigerators, stooped to examine the contents. John peered around him.
"I'm not funny," Sherlock said. "I'm very serious." He slurred the last 's', the word trailing off as he dropped his head back onto his arms.
"Oh," Sherlock says, and he is slightly breathless. He smiles. His lips are kiss-swollen. It is a good look for him, John thinks.
No response came.
"Oh you're not bad," she said, and she laughed again. "Fine, keep the phone. For the last two years I'd assumed it was as dead as the man who last had it in his possession. Clearly I was mistaken on both counts."
Attempting to replace Mary would be a fool's errand. Mary was quite unique. Remarkable and skilled and very, very dangerous. Impulsive. Witty. (Bit hasty with her trigger finger, but everyone has their flaws.) Even if he could find someone comparable, John would likely balk at being deliberately set up with another assassin. He'd not been particularly keen on that bit the first time around.
He'd made his peace with Irene Adler. He had. It was—well, he was never going to
The box remains where he left it.
"He needs your help," John said. "You might be the only person who can help him now."
"You agreed to keep it professional," Sarah says, and she offers him a tentative smile. "I was a bit relieved, honestly. Workplace relationships are never really the best idea. I would know."
Surely his address was no great secret. If Jim-not-actually-from-IT had been willing to pose as a cabbie to ambush him, there was nothing keeping him from making another attempt at John's flat.
Honeymoon.
"I fell in," he said to the wall.
The medic shrugged, left him be.
"Right, okay."
"What?" John asked, pausing as he slid the key into the lock. The bag crinkled as he shifted it on his hip.
She shook her head, clearly befuddled. "And that...made it all right that Sarah had dumped you?"
"Sad?"
When he returned to the sofa, he looked at his phone.
"No more messages," Molly said. "I won't do that again. I won't."
There was a photo with the text, blurry, out of focus. Sherlock, holding up something that looked like an old piece of parchment. He wore the endearingly half-stunned look he tended to get whenever someone turned a camera on him.
The scraped skin on his knuckles is real, and it stings when he puts his hands under hot water.
Sherlock let his feet drop back to the floor.
She stopped. Waited.
John looked at the screen. Raised his brows. Waited.
Sherlock cut his eyes towards the rumpled little bed against the wall, sheets askew where he'd kicked himself to his feet after his nap. Looked back at John. Raised his brows.
"All right," Sherlock said, watching him warily.
"I know what you're trying to do," he said. He did not open his eyes.
One of John's hands drifted up to cup the back of Sherlock's head, fingers twining in the overlong curls that hung over his nape. There was a deep affection in that touch. Slow. Reverent.
He hated that, somehow, John had become an essential part of
John stared at her for a moment, feeling very slow and very stupid. The entire conversation seemed surreal, improbable. "You—know someone in the Serbian Cabinet of Ministers."
"Yes," John says. He is surprised at how hot the anger still burns. "But he only wins if he gets there first. All the sponsorships in the world aren't going to help him if the—" he nearly chokes on the name, "—Storm Spider doesn't fly."
It is not fair. It's a childish thought, but one that he has been unable to shake since that day. It is not fair, what happened to Sherlock. He had loved his work above all else, and Moriarty had taken that from him.
Sherlock sat up. He'd shrugged off his coat and suit jacket, was down to just his shirtsleeves.
"Where were you when you were twenty-one?"
Sherlock pressed, and nudged, and shoved, and John found himself arranged on his side in the cramped space, facing the front seats. Sherlock was behind him, his back against the seatrests, his front—his front pressed all along John's back.
Across from him, John's chair stood empty, caught in a shaft of shifting sunlight. The fabric was comfortably faded and worn in all the places John had touched.
"Congratulations," John said. It emerged sharp-edged, brittle. He tipped his glass in their direction. "To the happy couple."
The sun rose. Climbed high into the sky.
"Why?" Sherlock asked.
John started up the stairs, Sherlock at his heels.
There was another burst of sound behind Lestrade. He was walking, likely seeking someplace quiet to talk.
"I'm not surprised." Sherlock turned and struck off through the tall grass back in the direction they had come, damp leaves squelching beneath his shoes. It was an unpleasant feeling, and he picked up his pace.
he'd wanted to say, but instead he'd looked up at John standing stiff-backed and uncomfortable in the doorway, had choked the unwelcome words down. John had not wanted to stay. John no longer believed him responsible for Mary's death, but that did not mean that John wanted anything more to do with him.
"Yeah," Lestrade said, laughing. He took a healthy swig of his own beer. "All right. Well done. But where was she
"Do you mind waiting for me in your office? There are a few things I want to go over, but—"
Sherlock had listened to his steps on the stairs—forceful, hasty, not allowing himself time to rethink his decision—and had flinched a bit at the slam of the door.
John has fallen deeply asleep.
Joe Straker, he is told, returned home as expected after a long day working with the horses. He and his wife sat down for a meal of curried mutton (Joe's favourite). As was his custom, after finishing his meal, Joe took the leftovers out to the barn to share with the night watchman. He then returned home.
He had spent the first seven years of his life rather heavily indulged, the sole focus of his parents’ love and attention. He’d not been keen on change.
Then Moriarty appeared on the scene. And suddenly all of John's worries—his dream, his inappropriate behavior, his unwanted and inconvenient attraction to Sherlock—didn't seem very important at all.
"Why are you even
"Is this—"
"I'm off, then," John said, unable to look at them. He went to Sherlock's chair, picked up Rosie. Held her against his chest.
"Well," John said. "You're supposed to be dead. I imagine most things are surprising after that."
He holds up his hands, slows his approach. "Easy, boy," he says. "I don't mean any harm."
The old woman takes a halting step forward, stops. Shakes her head. Backs up. Turns away.
"John," he said, and his voice emerged trembling, urgent. He ploughed on. "It has occurred to me that—perhaps—" he stopped, breathed out. Tried again. "You're interviewing for a positon in Bristol. If that's what you truly want, then—um. Disregard this. But if it's not—on the off chance that you're there because you think that there are certain—things. Things that I should have said a long time ago and never did, then—well. That's my failing. And you should know. Well, there are a lot of things you should know. But most importantly, you should know that. That I—would like you to stay. Here. With me." He cleared his throat, looked up at the ceiling. "Forever, in case that wasn't clear."
Sherlock had made a soft, derisive noise, but his expression did not change.
"—don't observe, yeah. Got that. Thanks," John sighed, shifted slightly, his arm tightening around Sherlock and bringing a delightful wave of heat with it. "Are you—seriously, Sherlock—are you all right?"
"Wiggins," Sherlock said.
"I don't," Sherlock says. "Never mind." He stands, smooths his suit jacket, joins John in the kitchen. Looks at the bag on the table.
"Go on," John said, pulling back the blankets on the little twin bed.
He'd smiled.
"We're here because we care. About you. And we'll be here as long as you need. You do—you
He brought with him the sharp smell of the outdoors, of London air, exhaust and smoke. London itself seemed to exhale from the fibres of his greatcoat.
There was a man standing up near the back of the church.
"She shot me," John said. She had been holding a gun. A real gun. Of that, he was certain.
John's lips, soft and firm and damp against his. He could taste John's breath, wanted to inhale him, to draw him in and never release another breath of his own.
gone.
"Oh, what am I even saying," John mutters, shifting in his seat, suddenly uncomfortable. "Your idea of
Sherlock does not look up at the ship. Instead he watches the light play across John's face. John is beautiful in the shifting shadows. He does not look tired, or sad, or unhappy. He is just John, staring up at the twisted wreckage with something like wonder in his eyes.
Sherlock smiled. "Knew you'd say yes."
Her expression is a little dubious. He can't blame her—the steel barrel resting in the bed of Sherlock's ancient truck is visually uninspiring. There is nothing fancy about it, nothing high-tech or glossy or sleek. It certainly does not
he said. He thought about Pete and his relaxed, charming smile. He had been eager to escape that first lesson, but it had not turned out as bad as he'd feared. He hadn't minded, in the end. Of course, he had no intention of ever going back, but—
"John—" Sherlock started.
Well. It was Christmas Eve, and they were, apparently having
Sherlock had realised uncomfortably that
"Right," John said. He was breathing hard.
John's cheeks have, inexplicably, flushed up red. He rubs the back of his neck with his hand, a nervous gesture. "Harry said. That—she said you had a bit of a close call."
Well, it was only going to get worse if he delayed further. He took his phone out of his pocket, snapped a few pictures. Made a silly face to catch her attention, and she stopped trying to drool all over the hat and instead grinned at him.
"I was thinking the Thursday before the wedding. That'll give you plenty of time to recover from the inevitable hangover."
"I need information."
Perhaps he hadn't been distracted. Perhaps he'd been aware of a presence in the flat, but had chosen not to acknowledge it.
A foolish oversight, that was all. He should have seen it coming. And, of course, it likely wouldn't have happened at all if John had been—
"No," he says. "Just getting away from London for a bit."
"It's not babysitting," Molly said, pressing her lips together so hard they turned white. "I mean.
There had been a long stretch of silence, and then his phone had begun to ring. Sherlock had dialed him on Facetime.
The voice startled him. It was deep and sounded surprisingly close, as if the man were right on top of the microphone. "Wait."
"Easy.
He wanted to be something worth smiling at.
He wonders if John regrets turning down Julia's dinner invitation.
"What?"
"She's reckless. Impulsive. Short-sighted. Not the right temperament for what you're asking."
by MI6, wouldn't you be a bit more frightened?"
—and Sherlock's eyes fly open in the claustrophobic quiet darkness of his own bedroom. His limbs are trembling and cold. His face is wet.
Sherlock watches the woman watching John. She smiles at Rosie (good). Her eyes flick towards his left hand (newly bare of his wedding ring, a promising sign). She touches her own face, brushing at an imaginary strand of hair (common flirtation technique).
"No, you absolute cock," John said, and smiled, because that was a bit easier. It was how they had always been, insult and affection in turn. He breathed out, let his fingers toy with Sherlock's sleeve. "Let me finish. I'm sorry that I—that I didn't get to wake up with you this morning. Would have liked to. That's all."
"Right," John said. He unclenched his fist, took another look around the room. Couples. It was all couples. As if this wasn't humiliating enough, now he'd be sticking out like a great sore thumb. An obvious third wheel. A tag along.
"Do you remember Redbeard?"
Sherlock stopped speaking. Turned to look at John, his face expectant. Patient.
It was a bit cramped, he thought, but it would do. The walls were white and smelled of fresh paint. There was not a scrap of wallpaper in sight.
He looked at the wall, at the carefully framed periodic table and insect sketches. Shut his eyes again with a groan.
"You'll be returning to London after graduation," he said. It was not a question.
Lestrade shook his head, smiled. He took a step forward, went ahead with clapping Sherlock on the shoulder. It was a hearty thump, a far more robust greeting than the situation called for.
"Not me," John said. "I mean. You already said—well—obviously—that wouldn't have worked. But. I mean, maybe Molly could have—"
Sherlock looks back steadily, unblinking.
John stared at him, his face blank. "You want me here."
blank, at the thought of John in danger, and that was without adding an additional component to their relationship.
"Thrilling. May I remind you what happened the last time you attempted such an endeavor?"
it's chaos," Sherlock objected. "You just throw everything in a pile and hope for the best."
"The last few years have instilled a sort of natural caution," Sherlock said. Then he smiled, a small, crooked thing. "I had to be sure you weren't a complete idiot."
John laughed.
Arthur Bell studied him for a moment, turned away, went to the window. The weak sunlight illuminated his face through the dirty glass. "It's snowing," he said. "The road will be impassable in a few hours."
The staff of the London Aquarium are very fond of their sharks. They do not view them as mindless predatory monsters, and they do not wish for their patrons to view them that way either.
"A case, you need a case. What was the last one you took?"
exactly, but I'm. Well. Glad we met."
Sally is already gathering up her maps.
He withdrew his hand, slowly, without switching on the lamp. Stood very still, let his eyes adjust to the darkness. The moon was bright through the little window.
things like that. He wouldn't see the point of making a vow if he wasn't going to keep it, would he? Not Sherlock.
"Most of them avoid it," she concedes. "Except when absolutely necessary. And particularly at night."
"John," Lazarus said.
"What are you on about?" Lestrade said. His voice was tinged with alarm. "Who might be dead? John?"
me so long?"
Not worrying sounded pretty good, John thought. He shut his eyes. The warmth pulled him under.
John sets Rosie's little backpack down on the ground against the wall, goes through the door into the kitchen. Places the takeaway bag on the worn scuffed tabletop.
was fine. I just wasn't—"
He rode the tube home, shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers, lips pressed together, rigid and tense and filled with anxious rising dread, because Sherlock had been home in their flat all day, and by now he must know that John had been in his room, and—
"If the lady wants a private dance, the lady gets a private dance," John said. He was getting tired of smiling. He reached out, took Molly's hand, kissed it.
The woman stared at him.
"Ah," John said. He laughed, a little self-consciously, and scratched at the back of his neck. "So you do remember."
Tears, Sherlock realised. John was crying. He was quiet about it, muffling his hitching breath against the back of his hand. He stared down at the ground, as if trying to make himself disappear. As if he were ashamed.
And Sherlock had frozen, because when he'd said
He shut the door, turned back. Looked at the small bookshelf by the door. There were no photographs. He could not remember if John had ever kept photographs, before.
"Yes, all right, you've clearly made up your mind," Sherlock told Rosie when her footsteps creaked on the landing just outside the sitting room. "You were right, I was wrong, blah blah blah. Now. Your father is under the impression that the appropriate next step is to engage in some sort of lengthy
"Yes, well," Sherlock looked down. "As I said. Miscalculation."
Sherlock's lips were on his, clumsy and desperate and damp. Sherlock's hands were cupping his face, long fingers cold against his skin.
He looked up at the ceiling, studied the light fixtures. Nothing seemed out of place. Being crushed by chandelier would be overly theatrical, he decided. And worryingly imprecise. There'd been very little risk of collateral damage in the other cases, with the exception of the very first.
John clears his throat. "Which one?"
Sherlock smiled.
Molly had said.
There was a rustle, and something in the shadows moved. Or possibly moved. It was hard to tell. John sighed and reached out to close the window.
"Dunno," he said, finally. "Just. That's where it all began, yeah?"
They walked further.
"What, exactly, did he do for me, Molly? Dive headfirst into a pile of drugs? Somehow I don't think that was much of a sacrifice."
"Bonjour, le belle neveu des Maîtres!"
"That's not- no, that's not alright, no!" Sherlock tightened his eyes and she set the product down, running her hand through his drying fluff.
Sherlock stood awkwardly off to the side of the crowd of girls gathered. It was cool and breezy as they waited by a large car park of lorries, the girls giggling and waving at the soldiers on the other side of the grassy center of the compound. He only looked at his shoes.
"You don't think- there's something wrong with me? sometimes I wonder...if I'm broken or something" Lestrade's brows scrunched together and he bit his lip. Sherlock kept his eyes on his twiddling fingers.
Sherlock sniffled, his chest tight and his cheeks soaked with tears.
Twap!
." Sherlock smirked, curls flopping back across the leather armrest.
"Go on and get dressed, young man, and I mean it, Knight Grand Cross if you're not careful" She turned and moved away, the puppies nipping and lapping at Sherlock's naked ankles.
"I think he's beautiful," Elanor said finally, as if it were a judicial decree. She received some nods of affirmation before they were all interrupted by a sharp whistle, everyone scattering into formation, facing front. Sherlock followed their example and took his place at the end, watching nervously as a large, older woman with her hair pushed up tightly under her hat, a riffle slung over her shoulder and a sharp green uniform stood before them, looking them over. Sherlock gawked at the sight of it, was he going to shoot a gun? The thought sent an excited and nervous shiver down his back.
"Sherlock? Almost done?" Daddy called from the sitting room, and Sherlock dropped the tin in a fit of nervousness.
"Sherlock! Christ, Sherlock!" He fell to his knees next to his mate, pulling him up and putting a hand to his forehead, "You're burning up, darling," Sherlock clenched his fist around the empty vial, groaning at sharp pains in his stumach. John pulled his lover into his arms, navigating him to the bed, but stopping when he saw the back of Sherlock's trousers.
"Sorry, couldn't resist," John grinned and tutted, "eyes closed!"
"Here, I'll take him upstairs," Greg said kindly, swinging Sherlock's arm around his shoulder, guiding him up from the ornate dinner chair and helping him to walk.
“I’m sorry, sir.” John shuddered, he’d never heard Sherlock call anybody sir. It was a delicious word in that deep velvety baritone.
which was code for
"What the
"You don't understand? Well, let me lay it out for you," John seethed, hand grasping Sherlock's hair, pulling his head back and snarling, "You think you're clever enough to go behind my back, which you are not. You will not undermine
"Yes, well, I know Mycroft enough to know that the PM's got nothing to do with it, tell me, Holmes, whisked out of University?" Sherlock resisted the urge to deny all knowledge of Mycroft's existence but held his tongue. His newfound freedom could only take him so far, and telling off his new boss(?) was not a proper start.
"Sher-Sherlock, calm down, he's too angry to mean what he says-" Greg's eyes flickered between the opposing brothers.
"NO!" Sherlock cried, bleary cheeks glistening with tears, "No hospitals, no doctors, just you," John's eyes widened, but he tested Sherlock's pulse by reflex, it was a bit quick.
Watson was ignoring the cigar-invested conversation of the group he was standing with, transfixed by the creature in the corner. It was his birthday, but he looked like he'd rather be dead then be here with a bunch of old toffs. John couldn't agree more. He swallowed a last sip of whiskey and excused himself, giving himself a bit of a pep talk before approaching him.
"Who?"
John was about to make his way into the top when a white ball of fur ran through his ankles, yowling and scratching at his trousers. Jesus Christ! He almost took a tumble before gathering himself, only to meet the rest of the parade, Mrs. H calling after the creature and Sherlock following, eyes wild and blazing emerald.
You always were so weak and soft,"
Sherlock sucked in a breath and bit his lip, rubbing his forehead against his forearm, tears filling his eyes, rubbing them across his skin and trying to think of something else, anything else.
"Right, you heard him, Constable, let them through,"
"Yes, bites, saliva too," Sherlock mumbled, crouching to look closer at the bites, examing one with his fingers, silvery cat-eyes flickering with earnest.
and slipped into a deep sleep.
John smirked and raised his eyebrows. "And which one would you have me open?" Sherlock blushed furiously, slipping down off John's lap and moving towards the tree slowly, plucking a dark box from beneath the pile of gifts, presenting it to daddy. He slowly pulled the end of the ribbon, eyes raking over Sherlock relentlessly, Sherlock's skin glowing crimson beneath his thin silk shirt.
9 May 1939
"You will not visit me, Sherlock, that's an order," The omega flinched at his husband's tone, biting at his still scabbed lip, hugging his knees to his chest around the phone. His bondbite was flaring up again, the bloody thing, and he itched at it offhandedly. "I won't have you seeing me all broken down,"
"I'm sorry, but you cannot sit here and say that I am not being forced into this, because I am. You know what happens here, you know the laws. And don't say that you love me when you only love my body- because I assure you, it's not worth the effort."
Greg laughed. But it was a sad laugh that settled between them.
that filled him. Feral, animalistic tremors and sounds he couldn't control. He shivered and cried into the pathetic empty cell. "help me," He whispered deflated, "please."
Right? He was nothing without John. He was. He was pathetic, and lucky that John even looked at him at all. John was perfect. John wouldn't lie like this, hell! He hadn't even told John he'd joined up! Lying, sneaking around, manipulating. What sort of ungrateful little bitch was he?
"I know, Isn't it marvelous," John grinned, eyes still shut, and Sherlock stood awkwardly for a moment, the sweet luring smell of
Mycroft gasped, quite suddenly ripped from his thoughts as his phone rang with intensity, practically shaking the desk it was so insistent.
The air was cool and damp, drifting in through the windows as Greg lie sleeping, his back lit with a large square of silver moonlight. His husband's fingers gently stroked across his flank, tracing the patterns within the consolations of freckles.
“Good to see you too,” He shook her hand, “Happy birthday,” From behind her he caught a glimpse of one of the Dora Malanje and he stuttered. Something about them always made him freeze. He was a bit confused to see them. The King’s guard wouldn’t be protecting her for no reason. “And perhaps, congratulations?”
Sherlock was
"I'm coming in, Sherlock," Martin wasn't very strong- elderly, and an omega, but the scent of an omega child in distress filled him with strength as he shoved his weight onto the door, the lock snapping and the door swinging open on it's hinges. The sight that awaited him was sickening, and Martin gagged at the crimson blood that covered Sherlock from the waist down. The scissors slipped from Sherlock's fingers, clanking against the porcelain, dripping with blood. Martin rushed to his side, eyes wide and unbelieving as he took Sherlock's pulse. Weak, but there. The scissors, the blood, the mirror, it wasn't hard to deduce what Sherlock had tried to do. Martin pulled him from the tub, bridal style, calling for help before looking down at the unconscious child in his arms. He tucked a stray curl behind Sherlock's ears, tears running down the older omega's cheeks.
A lot of their days were spent like this, John worked a few shifts during the week at the clinic, and Sherlock helped Lestrade now and then, and they had plenty of time together. A mad rush to not be in a rush. There was nowhere in the world Sherlock would rather be than in the arms of his husband, golden strong and safe John.
"Take my picture then, the shutter's right here," John guided his fingers around the front to the button and smiled into the two lensed front.
"Oh, yes, Martin," Mycroft smiled tersely at the older servant, "Could you look in on Sherlock, I think he's due for, his, well you know," Mycroft coughed, uncomfortable speaking openly about omega issues. Martin nodded and looked concernedly up the staircase.
“You had a big day today, huh?” Sherlock nodded. John reached to the other side of the sofa and plucked up Melly the Bee. He deposited her into Sherlock’s arms, who immediately squeezed her tight and giggled, a sweet little sound in his deep velvety voice. John carried Sherlock to bed, tucking him in tightly under the duvet.
"I need your help, actually," He ran a hand through his silky soft curls, "Are there scissors in the kitchen?"
“That’s good baby,” He carded through his hair as they cuddled. Sherlock popped his eyes over daddy’s shoulder.
"Good, send it right over, and get to sleep,"
"Do you want to dance, darling?"
"Something's wrong with you, Holmes, tell me." The Commander said, her voice still solid and unyielding, and her shoulders broad. Sherlock swallowed and looked up, her eyes were soft and her jaw was firm.
He raced up the stairs and into his flatmates room, neat and tidy and it smelled like John. Like wool and whiskey and pine and marmalade. He wasn’t supposed to be in here, John would be stroppy. Sherlock did not like it when John was angry, upset, sad, it all was wrong, wrong that the greatest man alive should be angry. But he needed to be in here, just until John came back. His eyes flickered around John’s possessions. Photographs of John in his uniform on the side table. Jumpers lined up in the closet. A box under the bed. Sherlock bit his lip, glancing over his shoulder before kneeling and pulling the box out and opening it.

"Sherlock. I have to, when I'm called, I have to go." Sherlock let go and turned to look out the window, arms crossed, looking at his shoes. "It's bigger than just me."
little boy, Sherlock, I only want you to be safe.” Sherlock nodded in understanding, splashing some bubbles around.
"And what exactly are you looking at?"
Mycroft had me promoted now that I have a safe stuffy job far from the front, the bastard"
“We need to meet again.” Strange said finally. Ross scoffed.
"Sir, I can drive, I can fix this car, I can carry things, let me help." The Captain stared at him, assessing, and Sherlock steeled his nerve, biting down on his lower lip and staring right back, his eyes glittering with flecks of green, a single curl drooping onto his forehead.

Sherlock smiled, a soft childish smile that radiated from inside. He curled his head further into the warm, broad chest of his alpha as they listened to the wireless. Some serial that John enjoyed, Sherlock didn't really care. His book lay shut by his feet as they cuddled, a tangle of limbs on the sofa. There was a knock at the door but Sherlock kept his nose pressed into the dark warm musk of
"You're not an idiot, Sherlock, not in the slightest, and there's no reason to worry, you'll have Mrs. H once you've moved in,"
"Well go on, then, I've got a sick omega here,"
"Important enough for this? I thought you were lovely just the way you are,"
"God Sherlock,
He fought and struggled, his hair around his head in a halo under the dark water, his life jacket knocking him about and he flailed his limbs to find something, anything to grab onto. His heart was racing his his mind was fuzzy as held his breath, spots of green and purple in his eyes. There was a tug on his ankles, holding him down, and he kicked with all his might, barely looking through the darkness to see Janine, and in a moment of panic, he kicked her away with a brutal heel to her nose. She didn't come back up after that.
"No," Sherlock whispered, soft and coarse and just on the edge of breaking, "John doesn't know."
At Paddington, John bought a newspaper, and Sherlock stood on the platform, hands tucked into his pockets, watching the people that milled about the station. A businessman shuffled past him, tipping his hat. Sometimes Sherlock could pass for a beta, but not with his hair grown out like this, down past his ears.
"Greg said your things will be all moved in by the time we get back," Sherlock nodded and fluttered his eyelashes. "Right, now let's go, darling"
He rushed up the staircase, into his quite empty room, slipping onto his belly and crawling under his bed, rattling open that floorboard and pulling out his case. It's contents had since been altered. It now held as much money as he could scrape together without Mycroft noticing, a bottle of Alpha cologne, and a list of phone numbers with two names.
“Did you even wear a coat, Sherlock?” John growled, voice low and dangerous, and Sherlock shook his head. “Right. Take off your clothes and get  in the bath.” Sherlock whimpered, “Now, Sherlock.”
“How old are you, Sherlock?” Sherlock looked down nervously.
"300,000," Murray said, taking the binoculars from John.
14 June 1940
“You can call me John if you’d like, little one,” John brushed his fingers across Sherlock’s cheek, admiring those cheekbones. He leaned in and whispered “But I prefer Daddy,”
“You could say that.” Ross was about to interrupt and make this man explain himself when Shuri shouted about the party.

"Th-thank you, sir,"
Sherlock grinned, "G'night Jawn,"
"How can I go to fight, knowing he's here, unbonded?" John smirked sadly.
definitely something he wanted to show off, but nodded obediently. He was shivering uncontrollably, his whole body floating. John’s touch was grounding, the only thing he could cling to as his thoughts drifted from him. He was empty, so helplessly beautifully empty, his mind palace washed clean and pure. He came to in the bath, surrounded by bubbles, calming hands washing him, cleansing him of all these horrible thoughts. He shakily breathed in the scent of
"I'm busy!" Sherlock called, lying on his tummy, nose burrowed deep into one of his stolen books.
That was all he ever wanted to be.
"Yes, I-I'm fine, I'm coming right down," He mumbled, tucking his hands in his pockets. Greg tutted and grasped him by the shoulders, looking him in the eyes, before pulling him into a tight embrace, "you'll be alright, sunshine,"
Mycroft sighed, looking out across the dining room, "He may need to go to Sherinford, should things escalate, London is a bit of a target."
just a tiny lil update while I get my research together for the next chapter!! Historical AU's are the best and simultaneously the worst.
"You knew, and you still did those fucking experiments?" Sherlock wept, his shoulders shuddering, his fingers still tight around John's rolled up sleeves.
"Yes, Sherlock?"

"And I'm not leaving my work, John," Sherlock said seriously as he pulled himself off the knot, John's flaccid cock slipping freely and his hole tightening back closed.
“N-never, never got to pick a tree before daddy,” He whispered dolefully, his heart achingly heavy in his chest. Christmas meant a stuffy posh outfit and church and mummy and daddy fighting and he always ended up alone in his room, presents opened and tucked into his closet by the maid. He whimpered and John shushed him gently, pulling him into his lap. Sherlock’s curls brushed against his face and his nostrils filled with Sherlock’s sweet minty smell.
Sherlock eyed John, who was sprawled out, quite asleep and let out a good snort before stirring, flopping over onto his tummy and huffing. Sherlock looked back down to the letter, reading the return adress.
*muah* hope you're as disgusted with this society as I am
comments and suggestions always appreciated!
He let out his breath and looked himself in the mirror. He looked, different. Older than before.
The reminder of cool metal against his skin was like a balm, and he took any opportunity to forget his shame. He pulled his hands away and examined it, that little silver snake encircling his finger. How such things ever came to be, he didn't understand, how one could so desperately dread something, and yet find themselves content in the same proposition.
"Get out of my house. Now." Mycroft seethed, flashing his own set of teeth, snarling at Victor, stepping between him and Greg. "And don't come near my family. ever. again."
“You sure?” Sherlock’s eyes glowed with seriousness, his whole being itching for this tree. Lone, forgotten,
He looked up, shaking his hair out and turning his head around, before he could realize the sound was coming from the other window-
John was unbelievably strong.
"It's not really a
“Glad to hear that,” He stole a kiss just behind Sherlock’s ear. Sherlock shivered.
Sherlock puckered his lips and nudged him and John's eyes flickered with understanding.
"Oh,"
"It's cold, John," He whispered, "I feel ridiculous,"
“Cantrelle Risotto for me, Aubergine Parmasean for the young man, but we’ll start with brie.” The waiter nodded and scurried along. Sherlock wasn’t sure about John ordering for him, but it was very sweet and gentlemanly.
He was an angel, eyes fluttered closed, mouth open slightly, face soft and pure and holy in the moonlight. John leaned forward and kissed delicately up his tummy and chest, lapping away the stray beads of sweat. He dipped his head to nuzzle his beautiful omega.
"And a lovely little brother, and a good friend."
"I've decided not to be an omega anymore." He announced, stomping a little foot on the floor in a gesture of seriousness. Mycroft bit back a chuckle and cocked an eyebrow at this silly proclamation.
*whispers* p.s. i maybe might add a christmas morning chapter maybe idk tell me what u think okay bye love you
"Alright, I'll send him right over," Mycroft smirked, and Sherlock could hear the dripping of sarcasm and contempt. Sherlock was pathetic, it didn't matter what Mycroft thought anymore. Soon he was alone again, the sounds of partying continuing to thump through the floorboards. His mouth was completely dry, his tongue fat and numb. His omega was begging him to stay in the closet, stay safe, too many smells, too many people. He whimpered and ducked his head once more, eyes brimming with tears. Fuck this! Fuck his bloody stupid instincts and his bloody stupid gender. Whimpering and whining in the hall closet begging for his alpha? What a pathetic load of rubbish he was. Just a toy to be used and thrown away.
"We'll see if we can stop on our way home. We've still got a few more hours until we get to Monaco, darling, do you want some tea?"
"Good boy, Sherlock, oh you're so good, you're so good,"
"Stop that, Sherlock, don't think so much and be yourself."
"Enigma!" Mycroft hissed, nibbling at his lip once it had been said. Sherlock furrowed his brows and drew the phone to his ear once more, his interest very much rekindled.
He roughly replaced his tongue with two fingers, Sherlock squealing at the sudden intrusion, bucking his backwards against the rough callused skin that stretched at his sopping entrance, his cock begging for attention.
"You're almost there, darling," John growled, fighting to control himself. "Up and over, darling," He tapped Sherlock's thigh and the omega immediately obeyed, flipping onto his stomach. He tugged off his own trousers and took Sherlock's wrists into his hands, placing them to either side of his head. "Stay," He growled, and Sherlock whimpered, squirming, but obediently keeping his hands placed right where John had said. John tugged up on his hips, pulling him to his hands and knees, pressing a line of kisses down his spine, before he pressed his mouth to Sherlock's entrance, slurping at his fluids, tongue just barely tracing his rim- the muscle weakening and trembling as John indluged.
Sherlock's lips turned into a shy smile and he wrapped his arms around John’s neck, tucking his nose into his shirt and whispered, “I love you, daddy,”
, and the thrill sent fire through his veins. John growled and deepened the kiss, hands resting on Sherlock's hips. John pulled away, tucking his hands in his pockets and grinning.
, only because
"Oh yes, quite good. You're such a good boy for me, darling," John whispered, thumb brushing across Sherlock's sharp hipbone.
“So clever darling,” He pressed his first finger in slow this time, stretching ever-so-gently, slowly letting Sherlock adjust. He squirmed and flexed beneath him, whimpering. “Shh, deep breaths, Sherlock, we’re almost to the good part.” Sherlock gripped at the fairy lights around his wrists, burrowing his head into the bed covers as daddy stretched him further. “That’s it, little one, you’ve got it,” A single tear dampened his blindfold as Sherlock did his best to relax.The smell of peppermint was cooling, mixing with the warm scent of
"Oh, of that I'm quite sure,"
"You're alright, Sherlock, everyone is so very proud of you, sport," Rudy smiled and wiped away his tears, pulling him to his wobbly feet and wrapping Sherlock's arm around his own. placing calm and affirming hands over Sherlock's, guiding him down the aisle. Unconventional maybe, a presenting omega usually entered alone, but nobody seemed to mind as the older beta man gently brought Sherlock to his brother. Sherlock whimpered, eyes flickering around the church, quite embarrassed. He made eye contact with a tan, blonde boy, Mycroft's age, who smiled at him and gave him an encouraging thumbs up. Sherlock blushed and continued until he made it to the small stool that was waiting for him. Rudy pat his hand and let him go, quickly finding his seat once again. The organ stopped it's tune and silence fell. Sherlock nervously knelt, the stool creaking beneath his knees, just like Martin had said, but instead of bowing his head he looked fearfully up to his older brother, nose snotty and tears still drying on his cheeks. Mycroft gave him a firm nod as the priest began the ceremony.
Then, the worst came. He sat back onto the carpet, only to hear his trousers make an appalling squealch beneath him. He gasped, hands grasping down around his bum. He was soaking! He must've peed himself, he figured, stripping off his trousers and pants to give to Nanny to wash. But it wasn't urine. It was clear, whitish sticky stuff, it was seeping from his bum and running in rivers down his legs. Sherlock was petrified at this new symptom of his condition.
"But you can't! You can't know that! I'm-" Sherlock whimpered, curling himself inward inside of John's grasp, "
It had started out quite ordinary, you see.
"You didn't do anything wrong."
"Where're you going?" Greg growled, subconsciously squaring his shoulders and crossing his arms, gaurding the hallway.
"Right, now go on then," Sherlock dithered for a moment before going, each step down the stairs feeling ominous.
"If he needs to go north, he can go to my sisters, in Scotland"
"But I'm comfy, John," He mumbled, nuzzling at the collar of John's jacket. John shook his head and stood, stretching his arms a bit before holding his hand out for Sherlock, who groaned, but took it anyways. They stepped out along with another couple, and Sherlock immediately recoiled from the sun.
Mrs. Hudson set a cloth over the bowl and set it in the fridge. "Oh, what's this?" She pulled out the jars in which he was storing some toes he'd swiped from Molly. Sherlock grinned as Mrs. Hudson screamed and ran, his smile weak. John would've been curious about his experiments, maybe, chastised him playfully and kissed his forehead. He closed his eyes. Just
anyways, warnings for smuttiness, and a/b/o smuttiness can often feel dubcon, and it is, slightly, so just a warning, cuties, ilysm
"I'm fine."
"I don't understand!" Sherlock whined, throwing his head back, "Do you have a death wish or something? They'll send you to Poland, to Germany,
"Till death us do part," The vicar beamed and John pulled out the second ring, turning over Sherlock's palm and placing the larger band there. The omega looked up, eyes full of confusion, but John gave him a nod, holding his own hand out. Sherlock looked worried but slipped the ring on John's finger, wrists still bound.
John," Sherlock's voice broke, high and breathy and full of need and love, "You fixed me."
do you know what the chances of you surviving that are?!"
"Shh, go to sleep, princess,"
"Dr. Watson, please," He raised his hands to calm the blond seething alpha, "if not your sister, you'll need to appoint someone else to inherit Sherlock,"
"No, Sherlock, I don't need to justify anything to you. You are
He switched the slides and his bond ached again, he slapped a hand over his neck and whined, a pitiful, biological response that came through his nose in a high pitched sound of desperation. Alphas were so lucky, he thought as he groaned, a rut wasn't specific. Anything that breathed was free game when their precious knots were involved. Whereas Sherlock, well his body craved only John, his alpha, his mate.
just some fluff...literally
Alan's face wrinkled in distaste at this, and Sherlock's eyebrows raised, "Good for you, but surely you
"You mean about-"
"You're forgiven, Sherlock, punishment is over," John paused, fluffing Sherlock's hair a bit. The submissive sniffled and butted his head into the touch. John pointed with a nod to the bedroom. "Go on, pup, you need to rest now." Sherlock looked up, eyes drying, nose running a bit.
"J-Jawn, I-" His eyes rolled back, "Good god, John, please more, please,"
What were they going to do with him?
"Ich brauche es! Bitte! B-bitte!" (It hurts! p-please!) The german turned, trudging through the thick grass, looking both ways before slinging his riffle over his shoulder.
Sherlock bit his lip and nodded, looking up at John with wide eyes, “Jawn?” John continued typing his blog, painfully pecking the keys one at a time.
“Daddy! You’re home!” Sherlock squealed, eyes wide as he glanced at the packages on the table. “Presents?” John laughed and tousled his hair.
"What's that got to do with me?" Mummy scowled.
"The train," Sherlock said, squaring his shoulders, and Moran smiled, pulling him up and nodding.
Silence.
"Sherlock, this is bigger than me! I've sworn allegiance to my country, to my King, and that comes before anything. Even you. Now stop being such a child!"
Sherlock dressed as John showered, his favourite blue pan-collared shirt and black trousers, blue socks and black wingtips, tying the delicate laces with shivering fingers, his tummy wrenching in pain. He clenched his teeth and laboured through. Mycroft had sent his vanity from his old room, and it's feminine floral design looked so out of place, it's large oval mirror almost mocking him and his washed out skin. He sat at the stool and set about his routine, placing a few dots of sunscreen on his skin, combing through his curls and trying to make them look decent.
"You'll understand in the coming days, I really must go now, the next train leaves in an hour."
Mycroft had hit him. Slapped him across the face. It didn't hurt so bad, but the humiliation left him wobbly and ashamed. Mycroft hadn't ever, hit him, like that before- like a disobedient child.
Sherlock, you're so perfect," John thundered as his hips began to cant, thick muscular hands wrapped around Sherlock's hips, bruises sure to form there in the morning. Sherlock was beyond words at this point, his shoulders shaking with silent sobs, cheeks stained with tears of relief. Completely torn apart and shaking. The Alpha grinned, licking his lips as he his eyes raked over Sherlock's pert little nipples and miles of porcelain skin.
"Yes, Sherlock, of course. You can always ask for
"You promise?" Sherlock whispered.
“You’kay, darling?”
"I am no longer under your thumb, Mycroft, now go! Get out!" Sherlock shouted, snarling, his omega completely in control. A stranger in his nest, an alpha in his nest. His bond bite was throbbing, even if it was his brother. Sherlock didn't consider him family, so neither did his omega. Mycroft's frown deepened when he smelled Sherlock's defense, a foul concoction of pheromones designed to repel dangers. He stood, coughing and covering his horrendous nose with his handkerchief, remembering a few things from his school days.
"Love, are you alright?" Sherlock only nodded, but John could sense something was wrong. The omega turned, eyes wide and frightened.
"John, is it?"Mycroft leered, biting his cheek and depositing the phone back on it's table.
He did as he was ordered, fingers trailing down his smooth skin, across his clavicle, his diaphragm, his pectorals.
“Sherlock,” He groaned, “How did you get on the roof of our building at-” He glanced at the clock, “6:30 in the ruddy morning?” Sherlock smiled shyly.
"My, stop this. He's family, of course you'll see him."
sorry this chapter is so bloody short! thank you for reading <3
"Thought we might pack up your stuff today, that way it's already at John's when you guys come home from holiday," Sherlock scrunched his eyebrows at that and flopped his head the other direction, knees tucked up under his armpits. Greg only smiled and rubbed a hand across his shoulders. "Don't get too excited," Sherlock smirked and sat up a bit.
"On your knees, princess," He grumbled and Sherlock's knees hit the floor with a thump, looking up with wide, glowing blue eyes. His fingers shook as he fiddled with John's belt, pulling it open and getting his zipper down and freeing his pulsing cock. He suckled at the head of it, watching John's reaction's intently, before John tangled his fingers into his curls and tugged him forward, forcing himself down Sherlock's throat. Sherlock's eyes flew wide as the tip hit the back of his throat, but he adjusted, nostrils flaring, hallowing his cheeks and sucking like his life depended on it. John threw his head back, fingers laced through Sherlock's hair, fucking those sweet plush lips.
"What am I gonna do, John?" The omega whispered, his voice timid and small and John's skin paled.

"Sherlock!" He cried, holding his handkerchief to his nose, coughing and finding his husband at the windows, struggling to get the latch open. "Jesus Sherlock, are you trying to burn the flat down?" John cried, pulling his gasping lover to the floor, sitting him down on the rug where there was less smoke before attending the windows. Sherlock's hair was mustled, and he too looked rather done-in himself, wearing an apron over his button down.
"I cheated on him,"
"You mean, I won't have to get married? You'll protect me?"
"Mm..Oh God...Jawn, you socialist," Sherlock whimpered, eyes shut tight as John wrenched his wrist, a wave of pleasure rolling down his spine as he curled his back, eyes shut tight. Sherlock shuddered, body spasming as he came, sagging in relief and ecstasy, tummy and chest covered in sticky cream, and he fluttered his eyelashes and gave John a sloppy kiss.
"Stop, just stop this. Don't touch me, no more than necessary, I don't want to touch you." Sherlock snapped, the lie sinking deep in his chest.
also fun fact if you inject a bunny with pregnant urine they go into heat. i hope my dad never sees my search history lol
*crumples into a ball*
“Anything you have to say, hm? Acting like a whore in front of my work friends, embarrassing me?” Daddy said harshly, arms crossed, keeping his distance and looking down at Sherlock with a dominant glare. Sherlock couldn’t hide his tears anymore, he burst open like a cracked dam and it all came bubbling out.
Sherlock nervously stood in the washroom, staring at his reflection, fidgeting nervously. He was, quite naked, save for his knickers and the red strappy harness that dug lightly into his chest, back and around his thighs. Around his neck was a matching red collar lined with silver jingle bells. His wrists and ankles had red leather cuffs as well, each with a silver bell. His hair was fluffy and his curls fell in loose ringlets of chocolate around his forehead. He slipped on the antler headband and blushed. He turned a bit, looking at his own arse, and the fluffy white tail attached to his harness right above it. He eyed the door nervously before fishing his eyeliner pencil, mascara and the tiny tin of blush from the bathroom cabinet. He applied the mascara carefully, he was likely to poke his eye out with all this shivering. He popped the cap off the eyeliner and drew on some freckles on his cheeks, flushing with embarrassment at his own childishness. He glanced down at the rouge and looked himself in the eyes. Fuck it. He could do to have a little bit more fun. It
"Good lad." Lestrade smirked and clapped his shoulder before grinning, his brown eyes glowing.
"Right. Well, John asked me to be his best man yesterday, so I don't have anything ready," Greg blushed before wrapping his arm around Sherlock's shoulders, "but what can I say but how much I love these two people, especially my favouritest little brother," Greg tousled Sherlock's hair, his flower crown slipping down over his head. The omega blushed and grinned.
"But he's not a
"Just here," John pointed to the turn, but Sherlock was so out of it, all he could think about was the itchy burn of his sweaty blanket sticking to his back and his neck. He whined and tried to tug it off, but John tutted and kept it around him. "We're almost there, Sherlock, just relax," John had to admit, he needed to relax as well. His Alpha was going insane.
"It's important."
"He's not here, he sent a car." Sherlock swallowed the tears that were burning in his throat. All that time, he was in here being tortured and Mycroft was
"Lucky?" He furrowed his brows and huffed, hands gripping his tummy, "It
"But you won't have to go! I won't lose you!"
"Mycroft please, please, help me, make it stop, make it STOP! It hurts, Mycroft," Sherlock whispered as the slot opened and a strong lure of alpha pheromones filled his nostrils, "please, you, you smell good, please stay," Mycroft sighed. Sherlock was still quite too young to understand scenting, mating, bonding, any of it. He probably didn't even know what a secondary gender
necessary damage
"But, he's so,
hanging his head between his shoulders and trembling as John filled him to the brim, burst after burst of fluid, he felt as though he could feel it sloshing inside of him. The Alpha leaned in, breath hot on Sherlock's moistened skin, sucking up a gulp of omega's delicious scent. His canines gleamed as he suddenly bit down on his sensitive neck, the taste of copper on his tongue. Sherlock wailed, his eyes watering and his heart clenching as a strange and ethereal feeling flowed down every vein in a thudding beat of
Last week had been hell. Mykie had called it
Sherlock gasped when he saw his reflection. His ears felt naked, his curls cropped up tighter and neater, over his collar and above his ears. He looked, manly, almost. As if his gangling frame and feminine features could hide his secondary. Mrs. Hudson was in the sitting room, sweeping up the evidence of his beautiful locks to toss. He ran his fingers through his hair, his hands coming up empty. He swallowed thickly, turning his face back and forth, leaning over the sink. He let out his held breath and let his forehead rest on the cool glass of the mirror, a little cloud of fog beneath his nose.
"Yes, love, quite extraordinary," John whispered, placing his hand on Sherlock's knee, and Sherlock flushed, leaning his cheek against John's shoulder and breathing in deep.
"Oh, yes, I've heard about him, that's for sure," Louise raised her eyebrow inquizitively, "You know how the Alphas get with them," She bit back a laugh and sipped her tea.
"You're an idiot," Sherlock growled
, Mrs. Hudson is right downstairs, and my experiments aren't finished, besides your radio programme starts in fifteen minutes-Jawn!" Sherlock cried as John seamlessly unbuttoned his trousers and dropped them and his pants around his ankles. Sherlock crossed his legs and rolled his eyes. "Why do you always want this at such inconvenient times!"
"Definitely,"
"Yes, I know darling, I know, you don't want to sleep, it's so wretched isn't it, daughter mine," She whined as he wiped her nose with the sleeve of his dressing gown, pale blue eyes shimmering with unfallen tears. Mycroft only cooed, bouncing a bit and rubbing her soft warm back through her nightgown. "Shh, it's alright, I understand darling, let's go back to the nursery and have a chat about it," Mycroft settled her on his hip and yawned as they made their way to her room. He settled himself into the rocking chair and pat her back as she hiccuped the last of her sobs. He peeked an eye over to her, sighing when he found her wide awake, staring back at him stubbornly.
"That's natural."
“In Wakanda?” He choked out, face flushing. That was beyond an honor, to be invited a second time.
he shook his head and curled into daddy, his tears melting away into the warmth and safety of John’s arms. “That’s it, baby, now let’s get your kit” John hoisted Sherlock up and onto his hip, his soaked cheekbones resting on his shoulder. John picked out trousers and a nice button-down and placed Sherlock down to dress him. The pale boy shook his head and whined. He pointed to one of John’s jumpers, doe-eyes wide and pleading. John chuckled and obliged, pulling the cream knit wool over Sherlock’s head, his curls bouncing out the top. John wrapped a coat around his shoulders and guided his fingers into gloves, pulling a knit hat over his curls, adjusting his fringes in the front. It was quite chilly out, and he couldn’t risk his boy catching cold.
An involuntary breathy cry erupted out of Sherlock's nose as the belt found it's target, a fiery current running down every nerve ending in his body.
"But, but what about your job, you'll stay won't you?" His eyes were wide, pleading. He couldn't lose Esther. She was his
“Sherlock, why’re you doing this?” Sherlock sputtered, his eyes slowly rising to meet John’s- whole and shimmering cosmic green and blue. He bit down on his plush bottom lip, breathing hitched. He looked down quickly, his cheeks flushing red. He held up the collar, head down, lifting it to John.
Oh that goes without saying, sweetheart.” John smiled and pet Sherlock’s nape, planting a kiss on the crown of his head.
?" She poked his side and Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Sherlock awoke slowly, soft warm light filtering through windows. He fluttered his eyes open and sat up dreamily. He didn’t remember at first where he was- but memories of the night before came quickly, he was surrounded by the sweet smell of
"I-" Sherlock breathed, suddenly devoid of oxygen. He couldn't breathe. Fuck. He moved to speak, but his tongue wouldn't budge, his mouth numb and his lungs empty, his body trembling. The commander gasped, holding his shoulders as he went down, his knees slicing into the gravel and his whole body falling forward as he desperately tried to breathe.
"No, Sherlock, we don't appologize for safewords. You know that. Now sleep, baby, Doctor's orders." Sherlock nodded softly, already nodding off a bit.
"I'm sorry, you're done already?"
"Jawn, we are not fucking twenty nine times in one night. That's medically imposible."
"Best of luck, it's just that way," She gave him a pitied expression and Sherlock's tummy tightened as he followed her gaze. He swallowed and nodded, tipping his head and walking quickly, shoes crunching the gravel beneath him, approaching the garage nervously.
"Oh, darling, I don't think we need think about children just yet," John chuckled, sipping his tea.
"A bit."
There wasn't even cake. Just drinks and hors d'oeuvre, and
"This is my train, Mrs. H, wish me luck!" She only smiled sadly and pat his face.
"Gregory, I need to speak with you,"
“Sherlock, I don’t know about this,” John sat in his chair, but Sherlock did not move. “Look at me, Sherlock.” The younger man obeyed instantly, eyes deep and sorrowful. John cleared his throat, “look, Sherlock, I don’t take this lightly, you’re not like the others,”
If only John knew.
"I'm not tired, Mycroft!" Sherlock hissed, covering the mouthpiece of the phone, but Mycroft only raised his eyebrows and outstretched his hand. "I have to go, John, goodbye." Sherlock hung up, tossing the phone back into it's cradle, and shoving the whole thing towards Mycroft.
"m'alright" Sherlock mumbled, rubbing a spot on the floor with his shoe, arms crossed, cheeks flaring crimson. "How are you?"
"Mr. Holmes!" Mrs. Hudson cried, holding her frying pan over her head and gasping. "Really boys, you act like children!" She pulled Sherlock by his shirt and deposited him in the kitchen, and turned to the elder brother and gave him a withering stare.
(See the end of the chapter for
"oh, thank you, she's been crying all afternoon, this is Emilia, and that is William," Sherlock's eyes twinkled and Esther smiled a bit. Emilia reached a tiny fist out and grabbed at Sherlock's face, teeny little fingers tracing his chin. Sherlock smiled and bobbed up and down, Esther briefly kissing Emilia's forehead before rushing off to the kitchen to put the kettle on. Sherlock furrowed his brows at the slight limp in her step, and now that he looked carefully, hand shaped bruises wrapped around her arms, tiny thumb print marks on the sides of her neck. Sherlock watched as William introduced Greg to his bear, meeting the policeman's eyes. He swallowed and turned to the tiny, dark kitchen, eyeing the mould that grew in the dank, mildewy corners.
fought, you were brave. Braver than me, braver than any of us. If I wasn't-" Sherlock bit his lip and tucked his nose down, tears rushing down his cheeks. Jesus, why was he being so fucking emotional?
"I-" Sherlock bit his lip, the thought of telling this man to bugger off was suddenly not so appealing. Maybe this one's different...he is awful pretty...
“Get on with it, baby, murderers to catch,” Sherlock smiled and nodded.
"And you're sure they're up to it? Didn't you just get two new volunteers?" He gave her a look and Louise wasn't having it.
"Sherlock! Christ!" John cried and Sherlock grinned. "Oh my gawd, they're real," He got down on his knees and pet Willow's ears, her floofy little tail shaking as she hopped up on his knee to kiss his chin and face, "Oi! Not my ears!" John blushed as he was attacked with puppy love. "Sherlock! Where's your sheet?" John whisper-shouted, in that wretched habit of his to state clear facts out loud, "What if someone sees you?"
"Now, Dr. Watson is coming for tea next week. End of story."
“Thank you, thank you Master,” Sherlock rubbed his cheek against John’s calf, nuzzling against John's hand that he had dropped to pet him. John giggled before tearing off a piece of his toast, giving it to Sherlock, who tucked in it without hesitation, licking every bit off  John's hand, swallowing quickly. John smiled and continued until the toast was gone, ruffling Sherlock's hair and patting him gently. Sherlock rested his chin on John’s thigh, letting the sounds of John’s horrendous typing and the thrum of his heartbeat calm his mind. “May I work on my experiments, sir?” John looked down surprised at Sherlock’s manners.
She was about to respond, when there was a knock at the door, and Janine furrowed her brows, patting Sherlock's knee before standing and opening it. Vanecia stood, dressed to the nines her civilian kit, a red and white polka dot blouse and red skirt, with a single strand of pearls around her neck, grinning with big white teeth.
“Can’t tell you.” Sherlock mumbled, leaning into daddy’s arm, legs dangling over the side of daddy’s lap. John laughed and nodded.
"Shame, crying shame," He licked his lips and watched her, just a bit too much, and sniffed. A beta, but sweet and fresh like clover. He paused and looked out over the sea before following her down the metal stairs to the portside exit, his ring slipping between his callused fingers and remaining in his pocket.
"I'll go with you, make sure you don't get lost." Victor laughed and tucked his hands into his pockets. There was a terse silence.
The phone was almost instantaneously in Gregory's ear, Mycroft's eyes wide, lip almost surely chewed through.
Sherlock gasped as his skin was drizzled in the salty mist of the ocean, a hand over his eyes to look over the beach, queues of soilders towards the water, the pier also crammed full of bodies, waiting for a vessel.
Comander Mortimer smiled as she refreshed her cuppa, sipping at the disgusting regulation tea and bracing her nostrils, giving the blond Captain a glance.
Courting. A flash of a dusty medical journal in Mycroft's study came to mind.
“N-no thank you, excuse me,” Sherlock stepped forward but the man put his other arm down and flashed a sly smile. Sherlock could feel his heart thumping in his chest, his palms sweating, and he swallowed. He tried to analyze the best plan but his mind was frozen. Frozen solid, even as the man leaned in and whispered, breath hot in his ears.
Sherlock seethed, eyes clamped shut.
"You two behave yourselves, and I'll see if the food's ready," She got up and shuffled away, and Gregory's smile slid from his features as he rubbed his hands through his greying hair. There was a silence and Greg knocked back another glass of scotch, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand and holding back tears. Their first Christmas as a family, and Emelia wasn't even here. Mycroft stood, his shoes shining in the firelight as he approached his weary husband, wrapping a hand over his shoulders and pressing a kiss to the crown of his head.
"Aftermath," Sherlock whispered as a firm hand found it's way back to his waist, his own hand just naturally finding it's place on an army green shoulder, their hands clasped together as John began to lead.
"Do you trust me?"
"Good lad, now go fetch me some shoes, they're over there," He gestured to the armoire, and Sherlock hurried off as John pulled on his vest and tugged on trousers. Sherlock didn't even realized he'd followed an order until he held the shoes and socks in his hands, looking down at them in horror.
Sometimes Sherlock was afraid he might disappear. That AlphaJohn would take over and never let go. Dark eyes and snarling teeth and bruising hands and discipline.
"You're happy, aren't you John?" Sherlock murmured nervously and the older man barked out a laugh.
"Alright," he said sweetly, lips turned into a smile, and Mycroft nodded curtly, sitting up against the headboard and pressing the palms of his hands to his eyes.
"He's dead, Mrs. Hudson."
His husband was busily writing something, a letter, using a book as a table on his leg, scribbling with a fountain pen. John bit his lip at his tan shorts and blazer, his neat collar and tie, small cap resting on John's bedside table. His hair, once like waves of inky water, now cropped and neat beside his ears, still a complete floof. Different. Not bad, just, different.
," He whispered into those precious soft, sopping wet curls, tucking them behind his lover's ears. Sherlock fell limp against him, and John pulled them on their sides, the knot still pulsing, binding them together, their bodies still hot and slick with sweat. John kissed along Sherlock's freckled pale shoulders, breathing in warm breaths, the thin, delicate boy so wonderfully claimed.
." He whispered, his feet moving beneath him of their own volition, his nostrils twitching and his eyes watering. In a haze of confusion he shoved past bodies, until his eyes suddenly saw him.
touching the vein that went straight to his heart.
He traced his fingers along the rusty links of metal, flaking with white paint, thinking of 1833.
“S-so s-sorry da-addy, so sorry, please, daddy, I’ll be good, I won’t be rotten anymore, please, I’m so rotten, I’m s-so sorry, didn’t mean to, sir, didn’t mean to- to- to break the rules, sir, got scared daddy, couldn’t f-find you, please don’t kick me out, I’m so so sorry,” He blubbered and covered his face with his hands, shaking violently. He stilled instantly as daddy ran fingers through his hair, pulling Sherlock closer, petting him softly.
. Strong and kind and brave and
Martin sighed and he pulled the purity belt from it's case. Sherlock cocked his head as Martin knelt and helped him to step into it, the older man blushing furiously as he fixed the metal pieces in place around Sherlock's newly blossoming omega biology. "That's cold!" Sherlock closed his bony knees, placing his hands on Martin's shoulders and watching as the straps were buckled closed. "What is this for? it's
"I'd like to see you try," Sherlock stood and scooped up his pile of clothes before begrudgingly bowing his head. The Queen only smirked as she pulled him close for a kiss. Sherlock's eyes rolled into the back of his head as he returned it.
Sherlock swallowed nervously, fixing his scarf into his hair, pulling a single curl out to rest on his forehead, adjusting his jacket sleeves. The cottage was not what he expected- mossy, craggling stone, with a sagging black roof that ached under the weight of years of heavy rain. The stone path was littered with abandoned toys, and Sherlock smiled and picked up a small bear with musty brown fur and black button eyes. Greg didn't seem bothered by the state of the house, so Sherlock stiffened his upper lip and went on, knocking at the door, flinching at the sound of a wailing child. There was scuttling before the door swung open.

"Captain Watson! Sir, it's freezing out here, there's whiskey inside!" Came the shout from the portside door, the fading sounds of drunken carol singing filtering out into the frigid night, and Captain John Watson shook his head, leaning on the rails and watching the stars.
"I'll go get your cases, love," Sherlock didn't respond. He let himself sit atop this duvet that smelled like
tunes!
"John's not here," Janine pet his hair, "But we're going home, love, just take a deep breath and we'll be home soon," Sherlock nodded mutely, but he really could. It was as if John was right there, he clenched his hands to keep himself form grasping for his Alpha.
Sherlock had resigned to sitting on the plush sofa that was probably a thousand years old and smoking. A bit of a nasty habit for an omega, they say, but fuck them. A snappy dressed Greg made eye contact from across the room, excusing himself and bustling through the flood of black tie and cocktail dresses. He approached and put hands in his pockets before biting his cheek and giving Sherlock a look.
"Sherlock! What the hell are you doing?!" Mycroft shouted as he stepped out onto the gravel, towards the garage to arrange a car for Greggory. His incorragable little brother was filthy, rosy cheeks smeared with some inky substance (petrol?), galoshes thickly stained with sodden dirt, curls caked in mud. A pair of icy sharp blue eyes looked up with that sweet smile of old days. Sherlock waved from across the drive, laughing with the chauffer. The wonders of the internal combustion engine were
Sherlock couldn't hold himself back anymore, couldn't hold back the sobs that wracked through him. He clutched for his daddy, desperate to feel his warmth, the safety in those arms. He whispered, pleading, voice small and sweet, "daddy."
