"Yes. But...you knew that, didn't you?" Cas folded his hands slowly in front of him on the table and held his breath to stop the tears from welling up in his eyes.
“When you were drawn to it so quickly, I saw significance in that. It occurred to me that our paths crossing might contain much more meaning than I had initially guessed.” Castiel got quiet and Dean saw him clasp his hands together, almost nervously.
Three minutes later, Dean was inviting Cas in for that drink he had decided against, and Cas was agreeing, and Dean was freaking out. Maybe Cas didn’t even drink alcohol. He decided to pull out everything he had and put it on the kitchen table: whiskey, vodka, a bottle of white wine, and some beer.
Dean's mouth crashed hungrily back against full, swollen lips and he almost forgot to breathe as he became intent on milking more of those tiny, gorgeous whimpers out of Cas that escaped with every stroke of his hand.
"Because I had to know first. I had to know if he loved me, too. And everything just happened so...fast. When I got back, I mean."
“Our souls”, Cas said quietly, staring at the fiery light as it hovered between them, casting a twilight ambience across their faces. “It is as I thought.”
“I got my ch -” Cas stepped through the front door and stopped to look at the dining table directly to the left.
Dean's heart sped up and he could hear it pounding in his ears. He wondered if Cas could hear it, too.
Against his better judgement, Cas moved to comfort Lisa. He felt sorry for her, and he knew that what was happening wasn't fair. He couldn't imagine how hard this must be. He pulled her gently away from the car, and into a hug, hoping she couldn't hear his pounding heart. She accepted the hug gratefully, burying her face in his shirt, wrapping her arms around his waist.
Dean started to move away, just to grab soap, and Cas followed him, burying his head in Dean's chest, his hands running up his strong back and pressing their bodies back together again. He was grateful that Dean seemed to understand his need to be close. He wrapped Cas up in his arms, planting a kiss in his hair, standing still again as the water ran warmly between them.
He reflected on the way that Dean had so willingly helped him last night. It felt good to be cared for by someone who didn't feel like they owed him anything. Dean was kind for kindness' sake and Cas didn't experience that a lot.
Gabriel studied his brother's face, watching the blush creep up from his neck to his ears. He couldn't help but smirk. This was the best news he may have ever heard in his life.
Gabriel was mortified. Cas didn’t know he had done porn while he was trying to pay his bills in med school. He shook his head as subtly as he could to try and shush his cousin before Cas asked questions, but it was too late.
He didn’t want to unload his personal baggage onto Dean yet. And if he was still here when Dean woke up, he would have to say something. He definitely didn’t know how to act the right way for someone who should be grieving the loss of their father. Cas didn’t feel a damn thing and he didn’t think he could fake it.
Cas didn't intend to stop, his lips set deliciously, tongue pulsing just right, and Dean was paralyzed by the sensation of Cas' finger pressing right behind his balls, his other hand applying pressure to the smallest part of Dean's cock that wasn't in his mouth.
Dean wasn't going to let Cas take an Uber home. The defeat on that man's face when his boss called to fire him was unbearable to watch. A dark shadow seemed to pass over Cas' expression and hover there, and Dean was actually afraid for a moment. This obviously wasn't the first time Cas had experienced something like this. It was as though he had expected it to happen. As if moments like this were just part of life for him.
"I...made us a picnic", Cas finally said. He gave Dean a small smile, knowing that he would know what to do.
Cas was grinning now. He handed the water back to Dean and tucked his face shyly into his pillow. Dean dove back in behind him and resumed his earlier position, pulling Cas into him and burying his nose in his neck.
"Oh, you did? I always did like Lisa. Thought for sure she was the one. This new girl must be pretty special if -"
He rolled back towards Dean again, burying his face in his neck and planting small kisses behind his ear. He smiled softly when he felt goosebumps forming on Dean's back. Dean mumbled quietly before his eyes fluttered open and he rolled on to his back, pulling Cas on top of him gently and cradling his face in his hands, letting the world come in to focus.
"Sam tells me you're actually quite good with your sketches - I would love to see them sometime. I have a studio in the artists' quarter while I’m in town, if you ever feel so inclined to stop by for a drink and some good conversation - I’m always happy to give honest feedback on your work." He glanced at Dean meaningfully, a small smile playing at the corner of his mouth.
Upon further investigation of the set up, he saw that Sam and Eileen (probably Eileen mostly) had left snacks, and Sam had left a note:
"I... actually got fired last night. And my car broke down, as you know. And I'm definitely not going to make rent this month, so I might be back to living in my car again for a while."
When Castiel realized that Dean was about to slide off of the table, he jumped down to catch him. But Dean was heavier than he had thought, and they fell together into a heap, Castiel on top of him rather than cushioning his fall.
His dad's voice reverberated through his mind, and it made him angry that his first recalled memory was such a bittersweet one.
was. Whether it was fate or God or complete coincidence, everything that was happening was happening at a time when he desperately needed a fresh start. Thinking for the millionth time that falling in love with Cas could be his salvation warmed him to the core, because in spite of himself, he was sure he was falling in love. That’s why all of these details about life and the future were suddenly interesting to him. In the past he had always just been going through the motions, but now he was excited when he thought about it. He just had to get through this weekend and he could really slam the door in the face of all the bullshit. He wanted to start the rest of his life and being real with John was the last obstacle that stood in his way. He let Cas’s face take up residence in his mind again as he put more road behind him, pulling strength from it.
Cas watched Dean’s eyebrows almost disappear into his hairline when he poked his head out the door and saw the two of them standing in the driveway together. Cas moved away abruptly, feeling guilty.
“Cheers?” Dean said searchingly. If he was reading Cas right, he had just rendered him speechless in the best possible way. That had been his intention, but he had carried this “surprise” with him for months and had thought about it way too much until it gave him anxiety. He had waffled on whether to propose it as a job for Cas to love, or a place that they could call home one day. After yesterday though, he knew the answer. He glanced down at his left hand again to look at his ring, and still couldn’t believe this was all real. He was also holding the key to the cottage in his hand alongside the key to the rental house, and held them out so that when Cas sat up to take the wine, they were the first things he saw.
He wasn't sure why it surprised him so much that Cas kissed him back so willingly, or that the soft, exploratory kiss quickly became more urgent as their lips slid together effortlessly.
As soon as the last light began to disappear from the sky that evening, Dean announced his departure to several of the house staff before alighting in his smallest carriage with childlike excitement, bound for Jack’s crossing in the artists’ quarter.
“Home is wherever I’m with you, Cas. After I went for a drive yesterday and talked to Sammy, I finally realized that. For my whole life, I’ve had Sam, but he’s starting his own life now. The next part of the adventure that I want to have is with you. Whether we live at the bunker...or in the Impala...or at the rental house...or here. I don’t care. I don’t care as long as it’s you and me.”
The questions flowed out of them both as they tried to interrupt each other, and they kept getting louder with their inquiries until they both started laughing.
"I can’t figure out quite what’s missing. I’ve been contemplating, but I haven’t put my finger on it yet.” He didn’t want the stranger to know that he intended to possibly purchase the work, should there be potential competition for it. So he tried to act as though he was relatively disinterested in it for the moment.
Dean could feel Cas’ eyelashes leaving butterfly kisses on his cheeks, and his warm breath tickling behind his ear when he whispered those hopeful words. Dean leaned back to meet his lips for a kiss that he knew they both desperately needed, but Cas pulled away.
"You are incredible." Cas's voice was raspy and hoarse, his eyes lust blown. Dean stared at him for a minute, drinking in the gorgeous man trembling above him, before he stood and covered Cas's neck with affectionate kisses.
“Dean. Watch out. Watch out!” In one motion, Cas pulled his pants back on as he sat up, and shielded Dean with his body from a cloud of violent black smoke that seemed to appear suddenly out of the wall. Flames licked at them from out of the smoke, and Dean ducked in to Castiel, closing his eyes tight. He was sure that this was hallucination from the magic cigar, but it seemed so real. He had never seen...or heard...anything like this. A guttural scream seemed to come from the depths of the smoke, and the room smelled like Dean imagined Hell might smell. And when he ventured to open his eyes for a moment, one of the demons from his drawings was hulking over them. Smoky, rancid saliva dripped from its mouth right into Castiel’s...
“Yeah. I...want to say I have strong feelings about it. Is it really terrible that I don’t? I don’t feel anything.” Gabriel stared at the table when he said it.
When he returned to the kitchen, he heard the Impala pulling out of the driveway and his heart sank. Dean's sandwich and untouched beer sat on the table. Cas understood why Dean had such a defensive reaction to his question, although he was hoping that as their relationship grew, so would Dean’s ability to talk about things that made him uncomfortable without getting angry.
There was a long silence on the other end of the phone and something told Sam to remain quiet while Dean sorted through his thoughts.
Cas returned after a moment with a smile, and Dean heard a familiar song playing. It caused butterflies to erupt in his stomach as Cas took his hands and pulled him away from the bar. Dean couldn’t look away from those familiar eyes anymore - they were filled with intention, and he let her guide his hands slowly to her waist. This Cas had a lot more confidence than Jimmy Cas had. She placed her own hands on Dean’s shoulders and swayed slowly, trying to find a rhythm.
“I…” he was lost for words. The woman was studying him, and he was suddenly aware of how this might look. He backed away to set his coffee on the hutch near the door and started fumbling to fasten the buttons on his shirt.
Cas always appreciated Sam's thoughtful and direct nature. He never felt judged or uncomfortable in Sam's presence, and he was happy to have him here now to talk about Dean. He had always loved Sam so much, like a brother, and was going to miss him.
When he got in his car a wave of guilt washed over him, but he made himself drive away before he changed his mind.
“Mhmm, sure” Castiel responded in a very noncommittal tone. He looked at Dean and handed him the mysterious cigar. Dean took it.
"He did. I came out at Thanksgiving after what happened with Gabriel and Balthazar. It was the only way I could think of to hurt him. I never saw Chuck again after that Thanksgiving."
"I am...most enthused by your commitment to appreciating the art, my Lord," the mysterious gentleman said as he arrived next to Dean.
Their energy became carnal as they climaxed together, their eyes shut tight, trying not to be too loud while rapidly rutting into each other, heads in each others' shoulders to muffle their moans. They weren't even using their hands anymore by the end, relying solely on the friction from rubbing together to prolong the sensation from their orgasms as they came down, hanging on to each other for dear life.
Sam was strolling down the hallway of the bunker towards his bedroom when he heard Dean. Was he praying to Cas again? He caught his brother doing that a lot in the past few days. It had been nearly a week since The Empty had taken Cas from them, and Dean rarely spoke now except to talk to his invisible angel when he thought he was alone.
“Just me. I found you, and I covered it. We don’t need any of this showing up in the Society Papers. If we’re going to get you well and find you a wife, we need your slate to be clean. I don’t know what you have gotten yourself into Dean, but I want to help you. Let me help you fix it? Please?”
"If you will oblige me. I do actually have a pressing matter I would like to discuss. It could also affect Eileen in fact, and so perhaps this is as good a time as any to address what's on my mind."
“No...I mean...besides drinking sherry?” Castiel produced a small cigar-like item from his shirt pocket as well as a match.
"So what's this pressing business you want to discuss?" Sam asked, pouring them each a generous glass of sherry in the tea room.
“I...wasn’t supposed to, Dean. I was supposed to try and kill you, too, once we had mended the veil. But after I saw you the first time, I began to question my mission.”
“It’s going to be ok. You can wait. Let Cas have his night...and perhaps we can still try and enjoy ours?”
Cas was overwhelmed by the way his body responded to Dean when he came out of nowhere with that kiss. It made him realize that he had never actually experienced true, desperate desire before. He couldn't even remember the last time he had gotten off, or even wanted to.
Cas pushed up against Dean encouragingly when Dean hesitated,  groaning as Dean recovered and pulled Cas's pants down just enough to free his erection. He started stroking him with expert hands and Cas whimpered, thrusting up excitedly in to Dean's grip, his breath hitching and his eyes rolling back in his head as he tried to curb his desire to come so soon. Dean saw the effect he was having and pulled away to give Cas time to recover. The effects of the drugs were heightening all of their emotions even more than before, and Dean wanted to make this last as long as he could.
Dean loved the way Cas looked down as a small blush traveled to his ears and he bit his lip again. It was perfect.
Realizing his other hand was still on Cas's softening cock, he removed it and slowly pulled the borrowed sweatpants off of him so they bunched around his ankles on the floor. He didn't know where his sudden confidence came from, but he found himself kneeling, kissing and licking his way through the mess. He started with Cas's thighs, then he traveled along the overly sensitive tip of his cock with his tongue. Cas jumped slightly at the sensation, but didn’t pull away. Instead, he threaded his fingers through Dean's hair, tugging it so he could pull Dean's head back to face upwards.
The small yellow cottage looked like something straight out of a painting, with a small pergola built off the side and white shutters on the front windows. Sweeping prairie rose up behind it, and in the distance he could see beehives and a sea of yellow dandelions and sunflowers. A windmill and a small red barn bordered the property to the right, and the adjacent property was completely obscured by a line of large trees. He felt like he had just walked into a children’s story book. His mind hummed with appreciation, and in the moment he couldn’t have been happier to be human so that he could feel all of this in every fiber of his body and soul. He felt like he belonged here somehow, and wondered if Dean could possibly know how much this meant to him. He must, if he had arranged this. Cas realized then that Dean knew him better than he had ever realized.
"Oh. Well...I'm...gay?" He didn't mean for it to sound like a question, but he had never said it out loud before and it felt weird; but good weird.
As if he could read Dean's mind, Sam drew up beside him, looking as if he was preparing for a day in the gardens with Eileen again.
Sam folded his hands and stared hard at the table, trying not to let the tears escape that he felt collecting in the corners of his eyes. He suddenly felt trapped and helpless. This was a huge burden for him to bear alone, and it would indeed be his alone once Cas was gone tomorrow.
Sam had Eileen now, and somehow he knew if he talked to Sam about his revelations and his decision, that Sam would be angry at first - he would fight him - but then he would accept it. And Sam would be able to live the type of life that neither of them ever dared to think that they could have once he was gone.
“Hey Dean? I can’t find -” Cas wandered into the room in a towel and stopped dead when he saw Sam. “Nevermind.” He turned around and disappeared back out of view. Sam waited to chuckle until he thought Cas was out of earshot.
It seemed like it took an hour before the house came into view. It looked the same: old white farmhouse with peeling paint, the window in the upper front bedroom, top right pane, was still broken from when Cas had accidentally hit a baseball through it when he was 9. There were boards over it now, but the evidence of the incident remained.
It was a weird excuse, but Dean was too distracted by Cas's discomfort to press the issue. Instead he grabbed one of Cas’s hands, and it was as he had thought - he was so cold – Cas hadn’t come fully prepared for the weather. He needed more than just a coat.
, Dean thought, and he felt heated then, his pants tightening involuntarily. He walked around Castiel as he flushed, undoing the remaining buttons himself, trying to immerse himself in shadow as he sat on the table, placing his sketchbook purposefully in his lap.
Dean started to worry when Cas didn’t pick up his phone. They were supposed to meet at the Winter Festival in Lebanon, and Cas wasn’t in their meeting spot on time. Dean bounced on his heels, trying to fight against the cold winter wind that was gusting across the open field outside of the festival grounds.
After Dean had unlocked Baby's rear doors, he pulled blankets out of the trunk and slid in beside Cas, who was sitting in the center seat, hands folded, staring at the dashboard.
"Did you hear me, dad? His name is Castiel. Lisa left me because we weren't right together. Because I'm gay." There it was. Out there just like that, after keeping it secret for years. Dean’s hear hammered hard in his chest as he watched his dad carefully. The emotions in John’s eyes shifted so much that Dean couldn’t keep up.
"I just felt bad leaving things this morning. You blew my mind, Dean. No one has touched me like that before. I want to make you feel like that, too."
"I'm sorry. This is weird, isn't it? I just...I keep thinking about you..." Cas stuttered anxiously. Dean put his hands on Cas's arms and pulled him in, kissing him on the forehead, letting his lips travel lightly over his eyelashes...his nose...and finally his lips again, all the while gently moving his fingers to intertwine with Cas's and guiding them around his waist.
Excuse any errors in structure and grammar on this one. I wrote it fast while the inspiration was fresh in my mind.
"Is this what you want? To take it slow?" He  purred huskily, looking up to see Dean's head thrown back, his body shaking, his legs trembling as though they would give out at any second.
"This isn't the end of the road you know, Sam. There's still plenty of adventure left for us, no matter what we decide to do next."
When they got there, Dean slid Cas gently on to the bed. He slid Cas’s shirt over his head, discarding it on the floor and pushing him back in to the soft down comforter. He brushed his fingers lightly over Cas’s  arms and his chest, trailing them down to his hips, following the path of his hands with soft kisses that Cas responded to with desirous whimpers. He squirmed and raised his hips to allow Dean to unbutton and remove his pants, which joined the pile on the floor with his shirt.
The silence thickened as they sat in the car, neither of them saying a word for a long time. Gabriel wasn’t sure what he was supposed to feel. The knowledge that his dad just died hovered there like a bad joke, and he started to feel guilty at his complete lack of emotion.
"It would have ruined the surprise." Cas smiled softly. "Do you want to go inside? I've got dinner to go with the pie, too." Cas's suggestion was a welcomed olive branch.
He spied the note almost immediately; a piece of computer paper with neat handwriting in black Sharpie:
They stood in silence like that for another minute, the snow swirling around them, and Dean looked intently at Cas, his eyes shifting up and down Cas’s face as he contemplated the situation, enjoying the closeness, trying to figure out his next move.
The delight on his son's face made Cas weak in the knees. He immediately knelt down to open his arms as the screen door slammed and Jack rushed to him.
“I told you I had a lead on a case. It got a bit more involved than I thought. I should be back in 20 minutes?”
Cas didn't want to feel this way right now - defeated and once again trying to keep the pieces of his recently mended heart together. It was so unfair.
Castiel lowered his head and gave Dean a sidelong glance to see how he would react. Dean could tell Castiel was looking at him and suddenly felt as if the room was stifling all over again, and he shifted uncomfortably.
"Still a bitch. But she's tolerable. I just keep getting reminded why I never come back to this place. What a shithole, huh?"
"I'll be back in a minute, Charlie." Charlie nodded. They were the only ones at the diner - it was still early for lunch - so Dean didn't feel bad.
He also spied a bottle of whiskey on the dining room table when he walked past into the kitchen, and wondered how often Cas started drinking in the middle of the afternoon.
Finally they reached a break in the trees and Cas found himself standing next to Dean in a starlit clearing. Ten feet in front of them was a drop off that led down to a valley shrouded in shadow, with only the tree tops below illuminated by the shining light from the sky.
"About halfway. You've been out. I haven't actually seen you sleep for years. Whatever that "something" was sure relaxed you, Cas. Do you want to tell me his name yet?"
“God you’re beautiful,” Dean said. His breath hitched and his voice was surprisingly gravelly as his eyes drank in Cas’s body. He moved to straddle Cas as he slipped off his own shirt, debating on what to do next. Half of him wanted to release all of the sexual tension that had built up between them hard and fast; he wanted to fuck this gorgeous man as soon as possible until they were both slick with sweat and exhausted and too spent to move. But the other half of him wanted this to be slow and sensual. He imagined them exploring and kissing every inch of each other before having sex, and the thought made him groan with pent up longing. He was surprised at how natural it felt to be with Cas, and how badly he wanted this...
When Dean touched him, his body responded rapidly...hungrily. Something inside of him woke up, and every restraint within him snapped. He panicked at first, but his mind started to feel more and more at ease with every touch of Dean's rough, gorgeous hands on him. He whimpered with lust and longing and let himself go - let himself feel. It was fucking perfect. He had never been this aroused nor come so hard. When Dean knelt to clean him up, it was almost more than he could handle. He yanked Dean's head back, needing to see him...to be near him. And those lingering kisses from Dean's lips...dear God. He was pretty sure he was willing to go to hell for this.
"Is he just a rebound for you? A way to get over Lisa? To explore your sexuality more? What? I need to know."
Ben nodded, and Dean went to the hall closet and pulled a box of Lucky Charms and a box of Fruit Loops out from behind the bath towels. He hid them for the times Lisa wasn't home for breakfast and left Dean in charge. Ben wasn't allowed to have sweetened cereal, so it had been their secret. Dean always enjoyed picking out new boxes at the store - it was fun to have special moments with Ben that belonged to just them.
Dean counted the points silently and recorded them on his scorecard, which happened to be the back of the pad of notes that Sam had been keeping for a vamp case that he was planning on taking this week. When Sam saw it, a slow realization drifted like poison through his mind: that was it. That was the case...their last case. He held his breath and tried not to let his mind go back down the "what if" rabbit hole again. Not yet. He took Eileen's hand and guided her out of the room as he remained lost in thought.
“I will stay for a few days, but I’m not making any promises after that. Can you wrap my arm back up? Who else has seen this?” Dean motioned to the handprint on his arm.
When John had disappeared back up the hill and into the cabin, Sam fixed Dean with a meaningful look.
Dean continued chatting with Ben when Lisa went outside to get his bag, but he was distracted when Cas followed her. And then they were out there for way too long. When he went to check on them, he found them in an intimate embrace, and he wasn’t entirely sure how to handle it. His stomach fell into his feet at the thought that Lisa had told Cas anything about their relationship and why it ended. He didn’t think Lisa would have opened up that much to a complete stranger, but then again...he wasn’t really sure of much right now.
Balthazar pulled up to the pickup zone at the hospital a short time later and Gabriel jumped in with a huge smile on his face.
"That wake was...unbearable." Cas tried to change the subject for a minute. As happy as he was that he connected with Dean, the evening's events at the funeral home weighed on him. "I wanted to feel something when I saw dad. Anything at all...sadness, happiness, anger...take your pick. But I felt...nothing. What does that mean?"
“This is your heaven, Dean. It’s whatever you want it to be.” He smiled, and Dean didn’t think he had ever seen a more beautiful smile.
Sam was re-wrapping Dean’s arm expertly, and Dean had never appreciated Sam’s loyalty more in his entire life. He knew there wasn’t anything he wouldn’t do for Sam; his tall, sensitive younger brother. And he knew that Sam would also do anything for him. It made him wonder if Sam might take an interest in the title and the lands and the responsibility of carrying on the Winchester family name. He decided to consider it for a day or two before bringing it up; could he ask Sam to do that? Dean only knew that from this day forward, he would no longer be able to carry out his responsibility to the Winchester name in the way that was expected of him without bringing them to ruin. And there was nothing in the world that would make him feel more like a failure than destroying the reputation of his successful and prestigious family lineage for selfish reasons.
Dean wanted to push Cas up against the wall and kiss him more than he had ever wanted to do anything in his life. Cas was the perfect combination of sexy and cute, and his vulnerability kicked Dean’s protective instinct into high gear. He didn’t even know this Naomi person and he already wanted to kick her ass. But he supposed at the moment the best he could do was keep Cas from getting fired.
"I...don't know", Cas said, furrowing his eyebrows in thought. He glanced affectionately at Dean, blinking slowly, and grabbed his hand under the table.
"Jesus Cas, you're going to kill me. You don't know what you do to me. What happened to just spooning?" He threw the blanket back so he could watch. His cock in Cas's mouth was the hottest thing he had ever seen. It was tentative and he could tell Cas was nervous. He resolved to talk him through it, so he didn't panic, and let him know it was OK to stop if it got uncomfortable.
Cas hadn't ever done this to someone else before, so he touched Dean the way he would usually touch himself, satisfied that it seemed to be having the intended effect. It was simultaneously exciting and terrifying to sense Dean coming apart so easily, his cock growing increasingly harder with every touch, the sounds that escaped him becoming more urgent as he muffled them in Cas's shoulder.
“Dean…” Cas felt numb. He lay on his back on the flannel blanket, staring up at the sunflowers and breathing in the perfect fall air. Dean’s face appeared above him after several seconds followed by a glass of wine.
"Its ok. I want you, Cas", he whispered, "I want you so much it hurts. I've wanted you for a long time, but I didn't know it - not really. Not until you said it. Not until you told me you loved me and then I couldn't have you anymore. It's been killing me. I thought you were gone for good this time and I wasn't sure most days that I could keep on living without you. All I've done is replay that moment in my mind over and over again."
"Cas. You're...beautiful. So fucking beautiful. Can I...?" Dean reached out to touch the raven black feathers of Cas's wings. Cas nodded, bringing his shining blue eyes up to meet Dean's bright green ones, forgetting his discomfort when he saw the love and awe there. The moment was euphoric for them both as they allowed themselves to
Once dressed, he found himself sitting at Dean's dining room table while Lisa finished cooking breakfast. Dean had changed into what he assumed was his "uniform" for his job - a black t-shirt, distressed, oil-stained jeans and steel-toe boots. It was so sexy that he had to train his attention elsewhere. He focused on the happy banter between Dean and Ben, and the humming he heard coming from the kitchen accompanied by the sound of bacon frying and the clatter of dishes being taken out of a cupboard. It all provided for a soothing ambience and it brought him comfort.
"See you soon," Jack said with a wink. His words were a faraway echo even as the last syllable left his lips, and Castiel found himself standing in a dark roadhouse parking lot in the middle of the night.
After Lisa and Ben left, Dean enjoyed a moment of comfortable silence with Hannah. When Jack came to sit on her lap, he saw Cas again. And he almost asked. But he didn't. If Hannah wanted to share about Jack's dad, she could have.
"I want to live here. With you. If you'll still have me. I don't deserve you, but I can't live without you, either."
And then when he closed his eyes for just a second, Cas was kissing him. Gently…hesitantly…it was warm, and Dean pulled Cas in by the ridiculous reindeer scarf, smiling into the kiss as it deepened and contentment flooded through him.
"Fuck you, Lucifer", he slurred. He struggled weakly against Cas, but Cas held him tight, knowing that his body heat was helping to warm Dean inside of his coat - he would have to work on sobering him up next, but he was taking it a moment at a time.
"I'm rooting for you, Cas. Let me know how lunch goes." He watched his brother start making his way towards the garage, and then pause.
"No. Just hearing your voice made my night better. And tomorrow will be bearable knowing I get to see you soon."
. This was going to get him nowhere. He inhaled sharply, knowing he didn't want Cas to stop, even though it ruined his intended purpose for coming out here.
He fidgeted nervously and took one cautious step after another, until he was hovering right above Dean, his beautiful, broken hunter. He slid his back down the wall until he was seated very close beside him.
Cas  looked up and saw them both drinking coffee, staring at him. Gabriel looked like he definitely hadn’t slept, and Balthazar looked surprised.
“Are you sure?” He asked hesitantly. “I don’t want to inconvenience you any more than I already have.”
Dean had closed his eyes again, aware that Cas had placed one hand on his chest and one on his forehead, and he heard him start to speak in his strange language. And as he spoke, Dean felt a strong charge travel through his body, as if he had been struck by lightning. He cried out in shock, grabbing Cas’s forearms with his hands, holding on to him, unsure whether to fight back or succumb.
As they reached Baby, Cas stopped. He was wrestling with the idea of telling Dean everything until Dean turned around and looked at him...
“You should marry first, brother. You are the eldest, and it is expected of you. What would the society papers say if I were to marry before you? People would talk.”
"In and out. He...has some demons he's trying to exorcise. Lots of baggage. I don't want Jack to see that. He knows he's welcome in Jack's life once he can stop drinking so much and hold down a stable job. I'm always rooting for him. Jack has him on a pedestal and misses him every day."
“I - suppose so. It’s so late...but she usually stays up past midnight working, so OK. Let’s do it.” Cas nodded decisively and finished off the whiskey in his glass before standing up and discarding the empty cup with a determined thud on the table. He looked back over his shoulder and smiled at Dean as he made his way to the door.
He saw Balthazar and Gabriel exchange glances. Balthazar winked secretly and Gabriel looked happy for a second.
"Never have. But if I was ever going to change my mind, it would be now. Everything that's happened in the last few days is too bizarre."
He focused on his breathing again as he exited the Impala, and he swore Dean’s eyes followed him. When he glanced back, he found that he was correct. He smiled a little at that and headed back towards the house with a little bit of confidence in his step.
"Which one?" Cas asked, even though he already knew. His heart beat loudly, and he was short of breath as he waited for a response, glancing sideways at Dean, hands fidgeting nervously in his lap.
“Stop it, Dean. I just came in to let you know that Eileen looks...absolutely beautiful, Sam” Cas said quietly. “Today is so special. And...Jack is here, too.”
"Woah woah...that's my job." Dean turned Cas around and undid the last two buttons on his shirt before slipping it off. His body was covered with goosebumps as Dean explored him with light caresses.
Dean pulled Cas to the floor, pinning his arms above his head, kissing him roughly. He started with his mouth, and worked his way down Cas’s now familiar body, just as beautiful as he remembered, tearing away the rest of the fabric that still remained between them. But he was surprised when Cas stopped him suddenly, pulling him back up so they were face to face.
"As long as that's dinner, and you're dessert, it could be perfect." Dean pushed up against Cas from behind, tempted to slip his hand below his waistband, but stopping himself because there was a five-year-old in the next room. Instead, he settled on whispering in Cas's ear.
“I...heard Dean praying for me to come back. I thought this was the right decision. Did I...do something wrong?”
"I know. And maybe grief was the wrong term. Let's call it an exorcism of that part of your life instead? I only had to meet Chuck once for five minutes to know how your lives went when you were young. You need to go to that funeral so you can experience healing. Purge that place and those people from your life and don't look back. And punch Raph in the fucking face for me too, OK?”
"It's a small room, Cas. And it just so happens that my favorite brother and my best friend are hooking up and I want to know details. I think I'm liking the idea more and more, now that I see how fond you are of each other.
“You’re having a rough night, aren’t you, Cas? I actually can relate. I’ve had a pretty shitty day myself. Come in for a drink while your phone charges? We can wallow in self-pity together.”
Cas's ability to keep his life together had gotten increasingly worse over the last handful of years after he got Hannah pregnant, and as hard as he tried to fix things, he kept taking one step forward and two steps back. Gabriel was scared if Cas didn't start finding ways to heal soon, he wasn't going to make it.
He had a lot of time to think on his drive north once Sam fell asleep. Their conversation had been exactly what he needed and he was happy to have the time now to mull everything over. A lot of his thoughts had become repetitive lately as he tried to paint himself a picture of what the future might look like if Cas stayed in his life, but he enjoyed thinking about it.
He busied himself with preparation to go to work, trying not to think too much about Cas. But a feeling of foreboding rooted itself in his mind and refused to budge.
“I…” he was lost for words. He blushed deeply, forgetting how to speak, and he looked at the ground.
Even under the dim red glow of the bar lights, Dean could tell that Cas was blushing, and he was sure that his face was just as red as he thought about what those words meant. He tried to come up with a retort to ease the tension that was building between them, but he stayed silent and stared at the floor until their drinks arrived.
Dean might have blushed. He handed the pajama pants to Cas. "Bathroom is that way." He pointed across the living room to the hallway and Cas followed his directions, wandering slowly away.
“If you like.” Cas gave him a wink as he sank back into the nest of blankets he had made on the couch, and Dean stared blankly at him, mouth slightly ajar. He was tempted to try and peel himself out of his chair so he could sit next to Cas. Instead, knowing how ungraceful he would look if he did that, he averted his attention to the coffee. He breathed in the heavenly smell and took that glorious first sip. It was always his favorite part of the day, and this morning it tasted extra good.
There was also the complex matter of the way Dean had felt when Cas had fallen asleep on his shoulder last week while they were watching Lord of the Rings. Instead of moving away, he hadn’t been able to stop himself from bringing an arm around his friend’s shoulders and pulling him in, and he might have even kissed the top of his head.
Dean was secretly happy that Cas had answered the door looking sexy as hell this morning. It would give Lisa something to chew on while she went to an out of state interview. Since she left  under the assumption that he might do better in a same sex relationship, let her think he had already moved on. Payback could be a bitch.
"What do you think of this one?" The man asked, studying the blue green watercolor with sincerity. His voice was deep and even.
Anna nodded and slid drinks towards them as they sat at the counter. It was a dark bar, which Gabriel had always liked. Especially when he was younger and could come here at any hour and it never felt too early. He didn’t think Cas knew how much time he had actually spent here before he left for college. His aunt served him whatever he wanted, even when he was underage. He only really ever went home in high school to check on his little brother. There was never any love in that house towards him and he coped by staying away.
"Jack? I'm going to be back when mommy is home, OK? And then maybe you can show me all of your new things?"
Dean didn't know what to say, so instead he turned the water off and grabbed the fluffier of the two towels to wrap Cas in. He chuckled at the fact that the towel stopped right at his hips.
“I will, but not right now, Cas. OK? You’ve had a couple of drinks already, and you have enough going through your head as it is right now.”
“Are you ok, brother?” Sam had returned with more sherry and handed a glass to Dean, who drank it down quickly and continued to try and slow his heart.
He called him. He couldn't help it. He wanted to hear his voice. He was disappointed that it went to voicemail, but he left a message as he walked home.
He hung up, unsatisfied. He supposed Cas and Gabe were at the funeral and hoped for a call back later.
Dean stood up abruptly. He didn't say anything at all - he just laced his fingers behind his head and turned away from everyone at the table, striding angrily to the other side of the room, staring at the wall. Everyone watched him, afraid of what might happen next.
Sam was curious about what was up with his brother after their phone call the previous day. After years of denial, Dean had abruptly decided to face his biggest fear head on. He went from stubbornly ignoring his identity to being at war with everything that was in the way of it, and Sam had to know the whole story. It couldn't just be because of what happened with Lisa. No way. There was more to it. And if he had indeed met someone...when the hell had he found time for that?
"Oh, no, it's fine. Sorry, I wasn't expecting it, that's all." Dean laughed and reached out a hand to the woman. "I'm Dean."
“Thank you, Dean. That’s...very kind,” he heard himself say. “Can I ask you one more favor?” He thought he saw Dean’s body tense for a moment but chose to ignore it.
“Hey Cas? Are you ok?” Cas was staring at him, fork halfway to his plate, unmoving. When he heard Dean’s voice, he snapped out of his momentary reverie to open the arugula and return to the present. Dean watched with heady anticipation for Cas’s review of his first homemade breakfast. He was mildly alarmed when Cas’s initial reaction was to start crying. “What? What is it? What’s wrong?”
“Shut up.” Dean gave Sam a goofy half smile before gulping down the entire glass of water and immediately refilling it. "You son of a bitch. You planned all of this," he said. "We need to talk. Cas told me everything."
“Cas. I have to tell him. But...I can’t tell him tonight. Shit. I can’t ruin his night. Anna says the wake will be tomorrow afternoon. I can wait to tell him until tomorrow. That will be ok right? That will be enough time. It’s only a couple hours away.” He ran his hands nervously through his hair, feeling overwhelmed suddenly.
Dean's heart hurt a little as he returned to the couch, wondering if he should just let Cas sleep the way he was. But if he woke up in a strange place...the least Dean could do was make it feel more like he had been invited by giving him a blanket?
"Give me one day," Cas pleaded, "just one - please. And I want to be human - I need to feel...everything. Let me say a proper goodbye." He steadied his gaze, locking eyes with his beautiful son - with the new God. He swelled with pride underneath the pain, and it was a welcomed feeling - a moment of relief.
“I didn’t want to live without you. I actually didn’t think I could. I wasn’t healing because maybe I didn’t want to.”
Hannah nodded. “I agree. So nice to meet you, Dean. Maybe we should try and meet up again sometime? Have coffee or something?”
When he emerged from the shower, he saw that Dean had brought his clothes in for him. How had it only been 12 hours since he wore that suit, hyperventilating in his car as it blew up, suspecting with dread that he would lose his job and everything else in his life?
“Um...do you want me to take a quick look at your car? I’m - a mechanic,” he said. "It looks like maybe your radiator is leaking and your engine overheated - might be an easy temp fix at least?”
"In a few more days." Jack said regretfully. "But it's ok, Castiel - I have plans for him. For us. It's going to be ok."
Cas nodded, unable to respond. He felt like the wind had been knocked out of him and he blinked rapidly as Dean started the Impala up again and gripped the steering wheel tight, intent on making it back to the bunker in record time.
“You keep saying that. But you’re a nice guy. I can tell." Dean glanced at Cas with a serious expression. "Letting you lose your job is the last thing I wanna do."
His eyes were watery. Hannah was watching them with curiosity. Lisa went to gather Ben up and found herself feeling satisfied with how things were going. She watched Dean hug Ben tightly and promise him another “guys night” soon. It made her happy to think that things might still work out OK, despite everything.
Dean slowly twined their fingers together and Cas appreciated the roughness of Dean's skin mixed with the softness of his touch. He wasn’t sure he would ever have another moment that would compare to this one. He found himself almost unable to breathe.
"Yeah, well. What happened with Cas was...unexpected. All of a sudden, he was on my doorstep after our poker game. His car broke down outside of my house. He was so defeated, like...this one thing was gonna break him."
Dean’s whole body buzzed with desire as they reconnected. It was easy to find a rhythm once they got past the initial hesitation, and he couldn’t help but start exploring gently under Cas’s shirt, feeling him shudder at the touch and lose his breath.
"Will you let me take you to lunch today, Castiel?" He finally moved away slowly, their eyes connecting.
As the song changed over, Dean gave Cas his hand back and placed his own back on the steering wheel. But almost immediately, Cas leaned across the center console and rested his hand softly on Dean’s thigh. It made him blush hard at first, and he stared intently at the floor.
“Cas? I want you to see what I see.” He spoke softly into her mouth and brought her hands up to his temples. “Read my mind - please.” He brushed his thumbs under her eyes, clearing away the tears that fell as she entered into the reflective pool of his mind to see what he wanted her to see...
"What the fuck, Cas? You picked a Hell of a night to come and find me." He chuckled gruffly as he brushed gravel and snow off of his pants and stood up. He offered his hand to Cas to help him off the ground before setting off towards the Impala.
Gabriel never stopped thinking about the fact that Cas was getting cozy with Dean. He still wasn't sure how he felt about them together. He loved them both, but to him they were like fire and gasoline. He saw something in Cas's eyes when he talked about Dean today though. He thought it was hope. So maybe...just maybe...they could be good for each other. Balthazar sure thought so, and Balth was a wise soul.
They drove in silence for over an hour. Cas didn't ask where they were going - Dean seemed to know right where he wanted them to be when they said goodbye. His heart pounded hard as the rumble of the Impala filled his ears like a familiar song. Eventually Dean pulled the Impala off of the main road and drove down a small, tree lined lane that led to a dead end. Cas looked at him; Dean had his jaw set firmly, deep in thought, as they reached the end of the road.
Dean moved towards her, wordlessly, and pulled her in, placing her hands on his face again. “I want you to know. Your vessel doesn’t matter. I just want you. Just you. When I lost you, I knew it. I’ve felt it for a long time. I’m sorry that you had to come back like this to feel confident enough to show me that you feel it, too. I’m sorry that...I don’t know. I’m...” Dean failed to finish his thought, frustrated that it had come to this.
Sam had been particularly delighted at Dean’s sudden interest in spending so much extra time with him in the afternoon, and even went so far as to cancel his social call with Eileen to spend time with his brother. Dean thought that it was a good test of Eileen’s character to see her deal with the last minute disappointment, and he respected the way that she handled it with grace. He even told Sam to marry her, at which Sam became silent and then argumentative.
Cas responded by wrapping his tongue around Dean's cock, and Dean started moving his hand in time to his mouth and tongue, careful not to get overly excited again.
There was no stopping the intense orgasm that gripped Dean’s entire body as Cas filled him up again, thrusting deep, listening to Dean moan his name deliciously. And Cas stroked him as he came, almost coming apart himself simply at the sight of Dean riding him, his hands gripping Cas's thighs behind him as though they were his lifeline, every muscle taught and quivering.
"No, I wanted to give Sammy some alone time with Eileen," Dean said with a wink. "Planned on sleeping in Baby tonight. Is that alright with you?" He turned around and looked down his nose at Cas, a smile twitching at the corner of his mouth, his green eyes burning a hole into Cas's soul.
Cas sat on the edge of his bed, glancing at the fortune cookie in his hand and then out the window into the backyard, where Dean was mowing the lawn. He felt a pang of sadness at the thought that they would be leaving this place in a few days forever. It had really become their place - the place where this whole relationship really started. He wasn't sure how he felt about going back to the bunker now, where there had always been so much tension and anger between them. This new place was their happy place. Something that belonged to just them and no one else.
"That's the other reason you can't stay, Castiel. Dean's fate is sealed. If you stay, you will die, too. A human death. And I need you to come back with restored grace. Not dead."
He woke up when they hit the dirt road leading to their dad's cabin in Northern Minnesota. It was late- almost 10pm.
he thought. And in the meantime Cas had to remind himself that Dean needed consistency and he needed his family and things that were familiar, and that's why going back to the bunker was so appealing. Cas wanted to be all of those things for him; he was confident that he could be. But what if they couldn't agree on this? Cas didn't think he could live in the bunker for long after experiencing his new life with Dean over the past six months. He could do without the monotony of their daily schedules, but there was something special about having a place of their own to live in. He sighed deeply and rubbed his hands across his face. He definitely needed to talk to Sam now and figure out what to do, because he was feeling lost.
Dean watched his face, trying to get a read on what Castiel was thinking, but continued to be amazed at the way that Castiel’s expression rarely gave anything away. He was so...melancholy? Sad? Reserved? Dean wasn’t sure, but it was one of the things that he found so alluring. He had never been so drawn to anyone before; especially not another man. But he was powerless to stop it. Castiel made him feel safe. Euphoric, too, and excited. And with all the burdens of life, Dean knew he wanted this studio and this man to be his escape. Whether it was a friendship, or...something else. He knew he wanted some sort of relationship with him. It was the “something else” that he wasn’t sure about. It made him squirm in discomfort, but also with desire…
When they made it home after dinner, Dean got Ben ready for bed and under the covers by 8. He had considered letting him stay up to watch a movie, but Lisa would be unhappy if she found out he was up past his bedtime again. Dean and Ben had spent too many nights in the past watching movies and cartoons together way past when Ben should have been asleep. He didn't need any more reasons for Lisa to resent him right now.
"OK, fine. I'll stop asking." Gabriel looked harassed and a small silence followed his failure to procure details from Cas.
“Cas - off. Take this off.” The nickname rolled off of Dean's tongue so naturally. He liked it. He tugged at Cas's shirt, pulling it over his head and covering his chest with rough kisses as he breathed him in, his fingers roving down to Cas’s hips, where he faltered briefly.
Dean drifted in and out of consciousness once he was tucked safely in to a vacant room at the Inn, finding himself enveloped in nightmares where the smoke demon visited him and burned him from the inside out. His level of physical pain was beyond excruciating.  And when he was awake, he heard very little beyond vague whisperings from his bedside about his worsened condition.
“I know. I...please come with me? I feel like if I don’t go I’m going to feel like I have unfinished business or something. And I can’t go alone. I need you.”
“Thanks again for doing this, Dean. You don’t know how grateful I am. Really.” Cas watched Dean move around to get behind the wheel of the Impala after he shut Cas's door.
It was Dean’s turn to blush now. “The smoke demon...found a moment of weakness at the studio when we were together, didn’t it?”
“Do you want to talk about this?” Sam asked gently. He could sense that Dean was struggling to make sense of what was happening, and he had a deep desire to comfort and reassure his older brother. He had never seen Dean break before, and it was startling. He only wished he knew what he could do or say to ease his pain.
“Overdressing.” He looked at Dean’s coat and nodded, pointing. “You don’t have to be fancy around here. What you’re wearing now is even still...perhaps…” Castiel jumped down from the table again and sauntered over, getting extremely close to Dean, and started to unbutton his waistcoat. For a moment, Dean let him, but when Castiel looked up and made eye contact with him at such close proximity, he drew away.
"Yeah, I remember." Cas squeezed Gabriel’s arm, hoping he would stop, and breathed a sigh of relief when he did.
"Did you...get me a new bumblebee mug, Dean?" He looked sleepily at his fiancé, wondering when Dean had gotten so extra sweet.
Finally Cas couldn’t take the silence anymore and pushed the tape in to the deck, turned up the volume, and closed his eyes as he relaxed back against the seat. The familiar sound of Styx filled the Impala, and he willed himself to get lost in the music. It was torture to have so many human emotions coursing through him.
"I know I don't thank you enough for letting me help Cas when he needs me. It's a lot, and you're a Saint. I love you." Gabriel felt inspired by Cas's thank you in the driveway and felt that he should pay it forward.
Cas turned the radio up to full volume in Gabriel's car and sang along with "All out of Love". He knew it was obnoxiously off key, and he didn't even care. Naomi’s dry-cleaning flapped haphazardly out the rear window, and he didn't care about that, either.
“I could say the same. We weren’t expecting you for a while. How was your night?” Balthazar took a slow sip of coffee, staring expectantly.
"I don't know, like a half hour?" Dean said, wrinkling his eyebrows in an annoyed, brotherly way and looking up at Sam.
He could only nod his head yes. There were no words for a moment like this. And then Cas was pulling out a silver blue ring from his pocket. In the right light it looked like it glowed just the tiniest bit. Cas slid the band on to Dean's ring finger and breathed deeply. "Angel grace," he said to break the silence, when he saw Dean inspecting the glow coming from the band.
"Sure, yeah." Dean made a mental note, and as soon as Hannah and Jack said goodbye and were out of sight down the driveway, Dean plugged "Angel of Thursday" into his search engine.
The two of them stood in a smothering embrace for a moment longer before Dean entered the room, skidding to a halt at the entrance to the foyer, staring with frantic eyes at his phone.
"Hey. Can you say something? Anything?" He watched Cas's chest jump from small hiccups and wanted to gather him up in an awkwardly long hug, but he felt like maybe that was overstepping. He sighed with relief when Cas finally moved his hand from his face and looked at Dean with
Cas picked up his coat and followed Dean. He got all the way to the door before remembering that his charger was in the car. “Dean, I need to grab my charger. Can I have my keys?”
“Cas, we need to talk about winter. I don’t want you to be cold and to get sick.” Dean took one of the coffees that Cas offered him before proceeding to pull a winter hat out of the bag and promptly shoved it over Cas’s  wet, disheveled hair. The booth that he found the winter accessories at had a sale on Christmas items, and the hat was ridiculous; black and white with knitted reindeer on it and an oversized pom pom. But it was what he could find, and so it would do.
Dean kept his eyes focused on the road for several more minutes with Cas’s hand resting softly on him before he couldn’t stand it anymore, and he pulled Baby to the side of the road, fixing Cas with an intentional stare. "C'mere", he said in a husky tone. He leaned across the car and kissed Cas gently, running his fingers along his angel's jaw and down his neck. His hands stopped at the knot of Cas’s loose tie, and Dean pulled him in by it, intensifying the kiss for a moment longer until they were both breathless. Cas didn't want it to end; he leaned in to Dean, exploring the inside of his velvet soft lips with his tongue, holding on to him tightly, tempted to crawl across the seat in to his lap. He whimpered softly, not quite sure what to do next, looking for direction from Dean.
“Yeah,” Dean said unconvincingly. He didn’t look up. He was kneeling at the side of the bed, staring at the comforter, his hands folded in front of him.
Dean excused himself to take a quick shower and changed into clean jeans and a flannel shirt. He also changed the bedding on his bed as an afterthought before heading back to the kitchen.
Cas trembled as he looked up, daring for a second to glance up into those green eyes that he had gotten lost in so long ago…
Cas stood in the doorway of the dimly lit roadhouse for a moment longer in silence before turning and walking out briskly without another word.
, Cas thought. And he found a small wave of confidence from somewhere deep down to nudge Dean's face away from his shoulder, and held it in his hands, their foreheads almost touching.
"So, you had some sort of mental break? Why are you smiling when you say all that?" Gabriel looked at him suspiciously.
"He sure does," Gabriel responded, sighing heavily and putting one of Cas's heavy arms over his shoulder.
Dean recalled Sam inquiring about what was going on, but he couldn’t form any coherent sentences. His heart hurt and he couldn't feel anything. Maybe John was there, too...he didn’t know for sure. All he could do was vomit. And then he passed out with a loud ringing in his ears and didn't remember anything after that.
"Sam, Dean is going to die on your next hunt." The confession just came out. Cas couldn't stop it. But he felt immediate relief upon sharing the burden of this truth with Sam. If anyone would know what to do...
Gabriel contemplated for a moment before nodding his head and squeezing Balthazar’s hand more tightly.
“Dean? What’s wrong? What happened?” He studied his brother and saw panic. He followed Dean’s gaze towards a beautiful woman in a tan trench coat, with a blue ribbon in her hair. The woman seemed to be in shock. “What the Hell…?” Sam looked between the two of them and it didn’t take a genius to put two and two together.
Gabriel’s phone chimed with the sound of an incoming text message and he opened it, all the happiness he had felt before suddenly disappearing.
Cas met Dean's glass halfway, and the sharp clink of the glasses was almost deafening as they sat in silence, both thinking about the heaviness of their impending circumstances.
Sam backed away from the bathroom door lightning fast, making a face and sprinting back to the living room to recover. They did it.
Cas stopped in front of Dean and did that little head tilt thing that was usually kind of cute, but this time the gesture was accompanied by a slight eye twitch, and Dean immediately wished he could take back what he had said. Cas had never looked at him quite like that before. It was unnerving.
Sam actually thought that this time, Dean might make his relationship with Lisa work. But here he was again, hauling the collapsible poker table out of his trunk alongside a bottle of whiskey. He hated humoring Dean this way, helping him by enabling all of his worst habits, but he knew Dean would do all of it anyway, with or without him. At least with him there, Sam could haul him into bed later if it came down to it and not have to go find him in the parking lot of a bar somewhere.
“This isn’t our usual spot. We live closer to downtown, but the playground near us is closed at the moment. I came to this one once before when Jack was over here visiting his dad, and we liked it.”
"Yeah!" Ben smiled and looked at Cas. "Do you like burgers, Cas? Dean takes me for burgers when I help him at work." He beamed excitedly.
Even Dean was scared of the way Sam sounded. He had stood up and knocked his chair over when he made the threat, and now all 6'4" of him was looming over John, casting a shadow across his back.
"It looks like you can see into forever, doesn't it? Like you could almost see heaven from here?" Dean said, looking up at the sky and breaking the silence between them. "This is where I've come every night since I lost you, Cas. Sometimes I bring a bottle, and sometimes I don't. I wish I had been here last night when you found me, instead of at that roadhouse; this is a much better place to say I love you, isn't it?"
As he pulled away from the house, he saw Sam appear on the front steps, and was sure he gave a wink and a thumbs up before disappearing behind the lamplight reflecting off of the cobblestone street.
Cas pushed them up in to a seated position and guided Dean up on to his knees. Dean looked down and realized for the first time that all of his scars were gone. He was as good as new. Except for the hand print on his arm; he could still see and
He didn't know how long they stood under the warm shower water before Cas finally pushed away, fixing Dean with his wide blue eyes.
Sam felt a giant weight lift from his chest. He had been watching Dean and Cas fall in love with each other for years and it had gotten harder and harder to watch them dance around their feelings. It was a relief when Cas had come to him and Jack three months prior and admitted he was in love with Dean, even though it was because it was a matter of life or death for him to tell someone. After the confession was out there, Sam and Jack helped Cas break his deal with The Empty (easy peasy) and helped come up with a reason for Dean and Cas to live together short term, which wasn't really difficult. Sam was happy to use wedding planning as an excuse. The goal of the temporary living arrangement was to have Dean realize it was time to upgrade his relationship status with his best friend. If being roommates with Cas for 6 months didn't do the trick, then maybe nothing would.
Cas stared at her without comment. He knew what she was saying. He tried to hide the way he trembled when he thought about how Dean's eyes had lingered on his body this morning.
He smoothed Dean's hair back from his clammy, cold forehead and held him tight, covering him with a blanket to try and make him as comfortable as possible.
He could sense that Dean heard Naomi by the look on his face, but he chose to reiterate the result of the exchange anyway. “I just got fired.”
"Not yet. And I know what you want. Be right back." Jack strode to the side of the red dining room where a swinging door led him out of sight, and he promptly came back with 2 to go cups of coffee - one black, and one with cream and sugar. Cas studied Jack for a moment, not knowing what to say. He wondered how much Jack had seen of his reunion with Dean, and stared at the floor in silence. He was happy when Jack spoke first:
Luckily, the house immediately to his right had a light on. He sat in silence for a moment to collect himself before stepping out into the cool night air and wandering up the driveway, feeling embarrassed before he even got to the front walk.
"How was your shower?" Sam smirked at him. He could tell Dean was going to say something sarcastic until Cas appeared and rendered him speechless.
"I...want to spend eternity with you. Even after forever has come and gone." Eileen watched the words bring a smile to Sam's face, and he slid the ring on her left hand and hugged her tight for a second time. They cried together for a moment before Sam descended down from the countertop, kissing Eileen softly, and wandered off to fetch Dean and Cas.
The physical connection helped him to confirm that this was all real - that this was Cas. He barely dared to breathe, in case the moment should pass and he would be left in the cold darkness alone again. Both men stared at each other in breathless silence until Cas shyly grabbed Dean's hand and held it against his cheek. The cold had momentarily become unimportant. The world stopped. Time stopped. Nothing at all mattered but this, and his heart beat loudly in his chest.
"I'm going to bed, boys." John looked at the ground as he made his way up to the cabin and disappeared inside.
"Love the garden", he said passively as he walked in to the house. He set everything at the table in the dining room and sat down, staring at the ceiling, knee bouncing uncomfortably. When several minutes had gone by and he was still alone, he decided to pop the champagne and pour it out into three coffee cups to pass the time.
Cas came soon after, back arched high off the bed, slick with sweat, eyes blown with lust. He rode it out until Dean finally collapsed onto his chest, burying his face in Cas's neck and trailing butterfly kisses across his jaw. They both focused on steadying their breathing and their trembling bodies, and neither of them spoke as they absorbed the intimacy of the moment, listening to each other's hearts beat at a million miles an hour.
"He had to leave early. But he’ll be coming back sometime. I bet he’ll want to hang out with you when he does."
After the plates were cleared and the bill was paid - Dean always left Charlie a generous tip - the trio stood to leave. The diner had started filling up at the noon hour, so Dean waved to Charlie from across the room as they exited, mouthing a silent “thank you” and getting a knowing smile in return.
“But...tell me. Which of my works did you like the most?” He was sincerely curious, and had never been given the opportunity to talk to anyone about it.
Dean's head was resting on Cas's neck now, and Cas had to fight against the urge to kiss his forehead. He settled for running his hand over Dean's cheek to try and wake him.
Dean opened his eyes and found himself alert. And upon focusing on the room, he indeed saw Castiel standing at the door, wearing his tan overcoat, hair disheveled, talking softly with Donna. Castiel glanced over to Dean’s bed then, and strode quickly across the room to kneel beside him.
“Surprise…?” Sam shrugged, spreading his hands out and motioning towards the gathering of smiling people standing nearby. Everyone had seen the kiss, and they were all silent, not wanting to ruin the moment.
In the middle of the night, he had woken up and saw that Dean fell asleep in the recliner. He couldn’t remember having ever seen such a perfect face before. It made his heart flutter a little bit. He found a blanket in the hall closet and covered Dean with it, and was happy to see that he was still there this morning, as gorgeous as ever.
"Showering," he said, and nodded in a knowing way, giving Eileen a playful wink and rolling his eyes. Eileen's eyes widened at this news and she giggled before sitting down and propping a leg up against the kitchen table.
Castiel almost looked like he would laugh, but in his mysterious way, he managed to convey his amusement without doing or saying much at all.
He got a chuckle out of Dean, which had been his intention. He wanted to lighten things up. The conversation got heavy fast.
“Sammy!” Dean nearly tackled Sam to the pavement with his aggressive hug. Sam was unbalanced with the weight of the poker table and stumbled backward ungracefully. Dean steadied him and intercepted the heavy table, lugging it into the living room.
“Anything you want to talk about?” Hannah pulled Dean out of his thoughts. She must have noticed that he was smiling to himself.
“Let’s go inside - sounds like we need to replace some light bulbs,” Dean laughed, smiling his charming half smile and helping his angel up after him.
“Drop my dry-cleaning off tomorrow when your car is fixed. Then go to the office and collect your personal belongings. This is strike three. You’re fired.” Naomi hung up and Cas pulled the phone away from his ear as the loud “click” echoed on the other end of the line.
“They can’t. It’s one of the things that I had to do when I went away. I had to get them to see. And they were forgiving. You are safe from them. They are just as curious as I am to see what this anomaly means.”
Dean thought, standing in the breezeway at the front of the main house later that afternoon, staring vacantly towards the stables where his best horse was kept. He knew in a couple of days he would depart, regardless of his physical state, and he made the decision that today would be the right time to talk to Sam about their future.
And then the bedroom door was opening, and Dean was walking away. He turned for a moment to look back. "There are towels in the hall closet if you want to clean up more. Shower's yours." He winked and Cas heard the water in the bathroom running as Dean did his own damage control before returning to Ben and Lisa.
“Because it’s Friday”, Sam said quickly and winked at Cas as he backed towards the front door. Cas scowled at him as he left.
“Cas,” Dean whispered. He began to stare absently at the tile. Sam could see Dean’s breath hitching in his throat as he took labored breaths. And then...he turned away quickly and disappeared, avoiding eye contact altogether.
“I’m so happy you decided to join me. Come, let’s get you set up.” He motioned towards a table in the back of the room, and Dean followed him, wiping his palms on his hands nervously as the warmth from the room started to set in, amplifying his nervousness.
"Heaven. Double word score." Cas looked up proudly and glanced around the room, waiting for affirmation that this was a good move.
He watched Cas working on what was evidently a pie crust - he could tell that’s what it was now that it was being shaped into the base of a tin. Cas’s dark hair fell across his face, and he bit his lip while he worked, softly humming and smiling to himself. Dean held his breath, trying not to think about all the things that he wanted to do to Cas's body right now. He was happy the music had stopped so he could have an actual conversation with the chef.
He contemplated kissing Cas's cheek on his way by - he really wanted to - but Ben was still sitting at the table, and it didn't feel quite right, so he gave him a small smile instead and squeezed his arm.
When he returned, he smiled sheepishly at Dean as he sat down, and tried to think of a way to make himself feel less awkward. He noticed the blanket underneath him was made out of vintage band t-shirts.
“Gabriel?" Cas's tentative voice interrupted his thoughts. "I left Dean’s this morning and wrote him a note. We don’t even have each others’ phone numbers. I'm fucking pathetic.”
Dean pulled away abruptly to see Sam standing in the doorway to the closest building. And it wasn’t just Sam…it was everyone that he cared about, all filtering through the front doors towards them at once. Mary was there, and Donna, Jodi, Charlie, Garth, Kevin, Claire...
"Let's not confuse Cas here", Dean said. He looked across the board adoringly at Cas, who was preparing to make his second word.
He could sense that Dean was watching him intently, and he was startled when he suddenly felt a soft hand on his shoulder. He glanced up, not able to hide the surprise he felt by the gesture. It had been so long since anyone had touched him with any sort of affection, and it felt good. He absorbed the warmth of the touch desperately, bringing his hand up to rest on top of Dean’s.
Dean didn't know how to respond. Her description hit a little too close to home and talking about it was obviously making Hannah feel sad.
“Good for you! It’s about time you find someone - I was starting to worry you were going to be married to your job forever. You take that shit way too seriously.”
Dean couldn't be quiet when he felt himself spill forcefully into Cas' throat. Over and over. Mind blown, body convulsing with the ecstasy that coursed through every part of him.
"Cas, do you live here now? With Dean? Instead of my mom and me?" It was an innocent question, but it made Cas’s heart hurt.
"Yeah. Maybe I will."  Cas found himself grinning at the idea. He recalled that Thanksgiving when Raphael had answered the door and spit on Gabriel when he saw he had brought his boyfriend - it was impressive how quickly Gabriel reacted and stopped Balthazar from lunging at Raph, rather than fighting back. Gabriel hadn't wanted to go at all, but Balthazar struggled to understand how it could be so bad until he saw it for himself. It got worse when Chuck had appeared in the background a moment later, face red.
Cas stood in silence, letting this new knowledge sink it. "You can't try and save him, Castiel. It's his destiny. He decided he wanted to die when The Empty took you. He won't live through his next hunt with Sam."
Cas looked down and pulled a small vial of electric blue smoke out from under his shirt, tied around his neck with a black cord.  “No, I didn’t. I extracted this earlier this morning. What did he say?” Cas gave a hopeful sideways glance towards Sam, who had started frying the bacon and was cracking eggs into a small bowl.
Cas took his time in the bathroom. He looked at the pajama pants. He smelled laundry detergent and dryer sheets, but also...maybe the faint scent of cologne. It was nice. He didn't hesitate to take off his uncomfortable slacks and trade them for soft cotton. They were a little tight, but overall heavenly. Maybe it was because it had been a long day in uncomfortable slacks, but maybe it was also because they belonged to Dean.
When they got to the restaurant, Gabriel smiled wide when Balthazar noticed he had reserved them the table where they sat on their first date.
Both adults watched as Ben and Jack became fast friends, and Ben demonstrated how to “skip” on the monkey bars. Hannah laughed when Jack accomplished the feat, but just barely. His arms were significantly shorter than Ben’s and it seemed as though he would be torn in half with the effort.
"That's really what your first fight was about?" He asked, trying to keep the amusement out of his voice.
After work, Dean, Bobby, and Ben went for burgers at Charlie's diner again. Ben had been talking about Cas all day. So  over dinner, Bobby asked for the scoop. Dean sent Ben to find a coloring book so he wouldn’t hear the conversation.
The moment was slightly awkward while Cas allowed Dean to put the mittens onto his numb hands, but he was feeling warmer already, and he wondered if it was just the hat and mittens, or if it was something else…but he shoved the thought aside and let Dean dress him. He was pretty sure that he was being laughed at, but he didn’t care. There was tenderness in this gesture, and he could sense it. The rest didn’t matter.
"Yeah, sure." He figured that today wasn't the day to ask Cas about his drinking habits and wouldn't mind a small drink himself to take the edge off. He was nervous.
“No. Just in heaven, still being repaired. He was just ash, Dean. It takes a while to re-build something that’s been burned.” There was an awkward silence for a moment before Cas found the courage to speak again: “How long have I been gone?”
"Sorry buddy, I didn't bring anything. Didn't think we would be staying long." Dean shrugged resignedly and felt guilty.
Sam pulled into the driveway at Dean and Cas’s rental house. The Impala was in the driveway with the passenger door open, but there was no one in it. There were pallets of flowers and bags of dirt sitting in the yard as though someone had meant to plant them but had forgotten. He frowned; maybe they had just gotten home and were coming back outside? Sam sat idling in his car a few minutes longer before deciding to go in. He was here to say hi, and maybe suggest dinner. He wanted to see how things were going between Dean and Cas since his conversation with his brother the day before - he was a little bit worried that the two of them had been fighting so much.
“Cas? Are you ok? What…?” In the moment his satisfaction was replaced with concern. He crawled up to sit beside Cas's head, cradling him in his lap and brushing his hair back from his face, unable to take his gaze away from
Dean was grateful that he had not used the book for his earlier “practice” sketches. He had filled several books with ideas and terribly executed human figures before he found a rhythm that he felt was worthy of this prized book from his mother, and it was now almost full with strictly Supernatural depictions. He focused most of his efforts on angels, but he also drew many of the demons that he often saw in his dreams as well. He knew that it would be frowned upon to create such deliberate depictions of evil, but the idea of angels and demons and there being a balance in good and evil in all of God’s creations fascinated him. He only wished that he had someone to share his notions with, and he hoped that Castiel might be the person who understood him. He certainly seemed to be worldly and open minded.
“Hello? Hello...Cas?” Cas snapped back to the present when he heard Naomi’s voice on the other end of the phone.
"Dean?! DEAN." John grabbed Dean, scooping him up as though he were a child, and held him close to his chest.
Dean obeyed, and he could feel a small pulse move through his palm when Cas entwined their fingers together, and the pulse omitted a small, blue green light.
When he checked the time, he noticed it was perfect for making it to Bobby's to meet Ben and Dean for lunch.
He moved his face close to Dean's, intent on kissing through it, but the best they did was bring their lips close together, panting, breathing each other in.
John kept talking as he stood, carrying Dean's limp body to his car. Sam rushed to grab some of the items that John had been listing off: Water. Food. Blankets. Ice packs...he couldn't really think clearly. He tried not to panic. He knew he had to be the adult here. John just had to drive; to get them to their destination. Sam would sit in the back with Dean, stabilizing his head in his lap...consoling him if he woke up.
"What was that about?" Eileen had been sitting across the table from Sam in the bunker library while he talked and could tell he was feeling stressed.
Gabriel rolled his eyes at her. He was sure Cas didn't want that much information, and he tried to re-direct the conversation to be more appropriate.
“Baby smells like peanut butter and the steering wheel is sticky. You can’t eat those goddamn sandwiches in the car! In fact, don’t EAT in the car
"You're going to feed me and blow my mind in the bedroom? Cas...I think I might love you." A smile twitched at the corners of Dean's mouth before he kissed Cas again, trying to adjust his erection into a more comfortable position, but it was impossible. Instead, he pulled Cas in by his suit coat until their bodies were aligned, and rutted against him, knowing it wouldn't bring him the relief he craved, but he needed it just the same.
“I’m sorry...I should have asked before I started treating your kitchen like it was my own.” Cas blushed when he said it, obviously reading Dean’s silence as discomfort.
“It’s not that, it’s just...it’s not you.” Dean closed the distance between them until their faces were close. Cas held her breath, letting Dean move into her space to study this new version of his best friend.
When Gabriel looked at him, his eyes were shiny. He had balled his hands into fists and his mouth was set in a strained line.  Cas leaned in to hug him tight.
Dean’s mind was suddenly a jumbled mess. Seeing Cas at all after assuming he was gone for good was shocking enough. Seeing him like this was making his mind short circuit. He couldn’t decide if he was intrigued or appalled by the new choice of vessel.
Dean headed out to the street and dismissed the Uber, giving the driver a tip for his trouble. Just what Cas needed right now...a poor Uber review when he didn't have a car and just lost his job.
“Sam. I’m the oldest son. Father and mother are gone. It is up to me to run the household and make sure that you and Claire are looked after and that the estate is maintained. I don’t have time to engage in such frivolity as drawing and make it part of a lifestyle. And you would do well to keep your observations about my skill to yourself. I don’t want all of London to know that I have a tendency for artistic hobbies. As far as everyone is concerned, I engage in trade, and finance, and hunting. Is that understood? I have a reputation to uphold.”
When he got to Hannah's door, he lost a little of the confidence that he had harnessed earlier, but he didn't let it stop him from knocking.
John still wasn’t speaking. Dean hoped that his father would get angry so they could at least yell at each other, or start a punching match, even. He knew he could take John Winchester. He'd been able to since high school. He knew he was stronger.
“Can you say something, Cas? You’re making me nervous now.” As the words left his mouth, Cas threw his arms around Dean’s neck and hugged him, following it up with another new kind of first kiss. He wasn’t sure what to call this one yet. But just like all of the other first kisses that they had shared, this one was unique. Entirely mind blowing. Absolutely perfect. When he pulled away, he raised his glass and breathlessly responded with the only word he could muster: “Cheers.”
He remembered the first day he had spent with Eileen being intimate and it still made his heart race to think about it. They hadn't left his room for anything except snacks and glasses of water for two days, and it had been the most mind blowing two days of his life. He was pretty sure that he had walked into Dean and Cas's first day together, by the looks of things. He took a deep breath before he opened the car door, looking towards heaven and praying to Jack that this wasn't going to get any more awkward than it already was.
Sam watched his father become inconsolable. The panic that crept into his face was unbearable to watch.
Dean returned his thoughts to the present to reward Cas's sleepy, exploratory kisses with light caresses up and down his back before rolling his body upwards into him, eyes closed tightly, surrendering unapologetically to his new, insatiable desire to be close to his angel.
Dean could swear that Castiel winked at him, but he couldn’t be sure. All he could do was stare into his blue eyes. It was suddenly torturing him to look at Castiel, and he didn’t know what to do with himself. He thought maybe he should get closer to the floor so he could lay on it; his head was spinning.
Dean nodded and  proceeded to open Baby's passenger side door. He stood up slowly and wandered back towards the house. He was going to have to figure out a way to make all of this up to Cas. His mind was already frantically reviewing options, but he was coming up empty.
“The artists’ quarter. At Jack’s crossing. You couldn’t miss it - it’s the only unmarked building there. I’m having a soiree there on Friday evening if you want to come by. Just a few friends. And some art, of course.”
He watched Castiel take out a large roll of pencils, chalk and charcoal and scatter them on the table, before hopping up and seating himself next to the expansive collection of drawing materials. He patted the table next to him and made eye contact with Dean, indicating that he should join him. Dean obliged, but not before taking off his overcoat and rolling up the sleeves of his own shirt.
"What did you fight about?" Sam was truly curious - Dean had never admitted to fighting with Castiel before.
“It’s not your fault, Gabriel. And you’re right - we should go. Mostly because dad would hate it that we’re there. Michael and Raphael will hate it, too. I'll go just to piss them off.”
“Oh, so you don’t have any interest in him, then? He’s pretty to look at. I guess I wouldn’t blame you.” There was resentment in Lisa’s tone, and more than a little sarcasm...maybe jealousy?
“Sorry, Balth. I was just remembering Thanksgiving. I still wish Gabriel would have let you kill Raph that day. I will certainly punch him for you if the opportunity arises. You can count on it.”
Dean had started moving closer to him now, finding his hand and gently twining their fingers together, and then it was like the dream, but real...Dean ran his free hand lightly along Cas’s jaw, but instead of kissing him, he hovered close and paused. Cas lost his breath in anticipation, his heart pounding in his ears. Then Dean pulled away, giving him a small smile and a playful side eye.
His breathing became shallow when Castiel kissed him behind his ear...sucking the soft skin there and kissing his way down to Dean's chest slowly. Dean moaned breathlessly as he slid his hands shakily up Castiel’s back, caressing his broad shoulders, and moving his fingers softly up and down Castiel’s spine, causing goosebumps to form everywhere he touched. Dean grew bold enough to pull Castiel's hips into him roughly, feeling excitement at how hard they both were as they connected, rutting against each other unapologetically until they lost their balance and fell over again.
"You have. Now get up! I'm making us breakfast." He smiled cheerily and strolled out of the room, hands in his pockets, looking like a giddy child. Cas couldn't help but smile again as he got up and took his coffee with him into the bathroom. He turned on the shower and looked down, realizing he would have to take care of the latest problem Dean had created before he did anything else. He rolled his eyes to himself and affectionately cursed his new fiancé for driving him so crazy all the time. He also wondered where they were going on this surprise excursion today. Suddenly he was just as excited as Dean about the surprise.
“Not sure yet. I think we’ll go in and have a drink while we wait for you and fill you in on the details when you get here.”
"Are you OK spending another day at the shop with me and Bobby?" He asked, almost positive that Ben would be ecstatic about it.
He tried not to get too melty about it, but then Cas appeared, and Dean blinked rapidly at the sight: hair an absolute disaster, tight sweatpants riding low on his hips, white dress shirt on,  but open...
Why did that sound like a goodbye? The panic that rose up in his chest left him numb - even more numb than he felt before when his father had rejected him. He couldn't move. The next message was from Balthazar. He felt like throwing up before he even listened to it.
“No, I don’t think so. It just happened - you have to process this in your own way. And your situation is different, too. You don’t have a relationship with him anymore.”
"I want you so bad, Cas." He tried to keep his breath steady, which was hard with Cas's body flush against his.
Two more days passed where Dean could not leave his chambers. He requested only Sam to change the dressings in order to maintain his secret, although it looked as though the scars from his burns may end up being permanent, and many of them weren’t healing as quickly as Sam would have liked. He was growing frustrated.
Thankfully, the next half an hour successfully put his racing mind at ease after he relaxed in to the playlist from the mix tape. He didn’t think he had heard this mix before, but of course every selection was
“What’s the occasion?” Balthazar asked warmly. Gabriel loved it that underneath all that stoicism, his boyfriend was a hopeless romantic and loved small gestures like this.
He knew he needed to go to his apartment and he was dreading it. He was on his last leg with his landlord and now he couldn't pay the rent. He had half a mind to pack up and leave without notice, before that red eviction sign appeared on his door.
"I don't care what dad thinks this time, Sam. I think...I think I'm ready to tell him. About me. For real. I thought about what you said last night, and the truth is, I am afraid of dad. But I need to get past that. It's time."
"Don't take more than you're comfortable with. You can use your hands, too." Dean carded his hands through Cas's hair, completely lost in the sight of his angel's gorgeous mouth on him. The sensation of Cas's tongue running softly over the sensitive vein on the underside of his cock made his breath hitch. He felt warm saliva coat him, and when Cas added his hand, Dean moaned unapologetically.
