“Nicely done, Dr. Holmes,” John jokes, eyes bright and amused again. “Now all we need is a bandage and you’ll be doing my job. I don’t think I’d be very good at yours though.”
* Will Sherlock change his mind about sentiment and whatnot again? (God, just the thought is exhausting, no?)
“Sorry,” Greg cringes. Sherlock rakes his hands through his curls and turns to the GM in abject frustration.
Hudders is tickled pink. Mycroft meddles. John confesses. Sherlock learns.
Much love always, Jane
Their eyes are locked on one another. The human eye can say so much without words. John’s are open and honest, conveying his every emotion so articulately. But there is also something that remains so clearly hidden, just beneath the surface. What Sherlock wouldn’t give to know what it is.
“That’s going to help you relax?” John laughs. His flatmate does not respond, but gives him a look that says ‘I wouldn’t ask if it won’t help.’ John shakes his head and toes off his shoes. “Okay, okay. Don’t question the genius.”
And there you have it. I hope you all enjoyed reading it. I certainly had a great time writing it. I know, I know what you're thinking. John, you're an idiot. Why is John such an idiot? (shrug) He's trying to remember his life, his love, the glorious man at his side who has helped him from the moment he awoke. That kind of mental effort and confusion can take a lot out of a person and make them take ten steps back sometimes instead of moving forward. Idiots in love... Idiots in love.
I should have said this before, but I apologize for any errors in spelling and whatnot. I edit myself and sometimes I see what I expect and miss things. I hope you're all enjoying it!
Much love to all and happy reading. Jane
Get ready for some major feels.
Warmth shoots through all the parts of Sherlock’s body at the term of endearment. He wants to say something in return, but cannot determine what and eventually puts the notion aside when they hear sirens nearing the building. Instead, he smiles at John and helps prop up his head. Soon fire and medics will be in the flat digging them out. Sherlock finally allows himself a sigh of relief. He sits down next to John and talks to him until the medics are ready to put him on a stretcher.
“I’m not rushing to anything. It makes perfect sense. The bastard wants to win and will do whatever it takes to do it.”
“What? I didn’t catch that,” he straightens again and glares at the taller man. “Oh, are you angry because I had the balls to call you out? I don’t know how the others can ignore it like they do. Are you so important to the team that it doesn’t matter?”
What an interesting dinner! The boys are certainly getting closer, aren't they? But what does that mean?
“Accountant. Recently subscribed to a conspiracy theory that the company he works for is secretly financing an investigation into the death of John Lennon, who he believes is still alive and hiding somewhere in Yorkshire,” Sherlock stated as his feet took a step forward and back to the rhythm. He pulled John in a bit so they were closer when John gave him a stunned look. “There is no investigation, of course, and Lennon is most certainly dead. Not so in the mind of our friend with the beard, which he grew for his lover.”
**Section 3 begins with a very short account of rape. If that is a trigger, just start reading at the dialogue I have underlined. This section is also rife with depiction of violence and torture. Tread carefully.**
Anyway, thank you all again and forever. I love ya.
“Don’t be so sure about that, Jim,” he says smoothly. “Unlike you, I never fail.”
I can’t help falling in love with you
Up in the club with my homies, trying to get a lil’ V-I
Sherlock sits up and studies John carefully. The words from his dreams echo in his ears and are soon joined by Moriarty’s actual words. His threats toward John still cut cold in his heart. He doesn’t want to say a word, but how can he not? How can he keep this from John with so much at stake? He swallows hard, licking his lips.
“I’ve seen you too,” John continued, finding his usual confidence again. “You’re very good.”
“Molly agrees with me, you know.”
Also, I LOVE this sex scene. :D
Sherlock toes out of his shoes and pads into the bedroom where his bags still sit on the bed. He should shower after the day of traveling and practice, but it is late enough that he cannot bring himself to do it. His only desires are to change and fall into the covers. However, there is one thing he wants to do more. Sherlock sets the wine glass on a side table and unzips his rather large bag. He slips his violin case from it carefully and runs a hand over its smooth surface. Playing helps him relax, clears his mind of most things, like flights. He places it on the bed and turns his attention to the garment bag next to it. He takes out the suits and hangs them in the wardrobe. They are a bit wrinkled, but it is nothing his morning shower won’t fix. He has another sip of wine while changing into dark blue pajamas and then pulls on his favorite dressing gown of cobalt blue satin. The color actually reminds him of John’s eyes. He quickly shakes his head to free himself of that thought. Jesus, he’s like a lovesick adolescent.
Things go awry at Angelo's.
Mycroft and Molly have done it again. Will Sherlock ever forgive either of them?
“You’re a doctor,” Sherlock began to say. His words were slow and careful. John gave him a warm smile and started swaying again. He let go of Sherlock’s wrist to slide a light hand to his waist and Sherlock obliged by moving closer and resting his own hand on John’s shoulder. John nodded in encouragement for him to continue. Sherlock eyed him with apprehension as he opened his mouth to speak.
**Depictions of violence in the last section. Tread carefully.**
4. Another epic tale, AU, or a shorter story?
I also forgot to thank my beautiful, wonderful beta, MyBreadAndButter. You have helped me hone my craft more than you know and no, I do not always do it just to please you. I like how it can help me paint a clearer picture of the characters, what they're doing, and what they're thinking. (She knows what I mean.)
“Did you grow up in London?”
“Merry Christmas, John.” Sherlock’s mouth turns upward at the corners as he looks over John’s face. The silence stretches into a minute, approaching awkward, especially since Sherlock’s smile has faltered and he now wears an expression of unease. “John, there’s something I need to tell you too.”
“You are impetuous and driven,” Mrs. Hudson’s tone and expression are stern. Greg can’t help but think of his mother’s face during what she used to call Come to Jesus moments. “It is what makes you the best coach I have ever seen. But sometimes you’re an asshole.”
“Then you won’t mind filling us in,” the stone-faced sergeant tells him, crossing his arms over his chest.
“Do it again,” Greg interrupts, “and tell me what you find. In the meantime, we have to watch everyone and everything at our bouts. If they’re trying to take us out, they’ll try again.”
Thanks, and sorry for the spoilers.
Much, much love, Jane
In one swift motion, Sherlock pulls the flare gun tucked in his waistband from behind his back and fires it at Moran. It whizzes past his right ear and flies far off over the lake where it explodes, alerting every other boat in sight to the trouble. It also sets off a chain reaction on The Crown.
Angst ensues.
“Whatever I need to solve a case,” he answered simply.
So...stick around for the end of the case and its aftermath. It's a pleasure to entertain you and thank you again for all your support. It means so very much to me.
“Of course,” Sherlock’s lip quirks up. ”Thank you, Sergeant. Your timing was impeccable.”
If your body matches what your eyes can do
“Are those gnomes?”
Tune in next time! Same bat time, same bat channel.
Feel strongly that I missed an essential question here? Feel free to post and let us all know what it is. I've always believed in expression. Express, not repress. Repression festers and leads to rotting of the soul. No good, no good. One day will find you smoking at a cafe and saying, "My ass is twitching. You people make my ass twitch."
“I appreciate it,” is all he says.
“On the contrary, John,” Sherlock leaned his head in and gazed directly into John’s eyes with his pair of intense, calculating ones. “I not only see, but observe. I use this place not only for the pleasure of dancing and the delight of Greg’s company, but also to hone my skills. I observe the patterns, the evidence, and draw conclusions. I am never wrong.”
John puts his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders and pushes him back until he bumps into the door to his condo. Sherlock looks at him with an expression of annoyance and he hopes
Thanks again to you all and happy reading. Chapter 8 should be out soon.
I can't wait to see what you all think. Oooooo!! This is exciting! I'm tingling with excitement. :D
“You’re happy with your life. You have Molly and derby and all of us. But think how great it could be if you’d just take a chance,” Greg pauses to let the words sink in. “You were alone when Victor hurt you, but you aren’t anymore. We’re family and it’s not just shit Mrs. Hudson touts when she’s had an herbal soother.”
Let my love open the door
“Sherlock, there is absolutely no proof that Moriarty has anything to do with this,” he lifts his hand in placation when Sherlock opens his mouth to protest. Against his better judgement, Sherlock remains quiet to hear the doctor out. “I’m not saying I don’t trust your judgement. He is definitely a suspect. I just don’t want you to convince yourself that we should only focus on him is all. It could easily be someone else, anyone else at this point.”
“They really give you a wide berth, don’t they?” John’s smile snuck back over his lips.
Damn, it was hard to come up with lyrics for this one.
John talks to Greg about Sherlock's nightmares.
*Coming down to dinner, yeah? Waiting on you and The Woman.*
“Sentiment?” John furrows his brow.
I know there are more questions, but all I'm going to say is Mycroft!! WAT???
Our next chapter will be back on the island. I want to post tomorrow, but we'll see how it goes.
Hello, Everyone!! I'm back again and full of beans! I think I'm going to say that every time I return from the depths of my writing desk. It's such a fun line.
(See the end of the chapter for
...And stick around for the next chapter. I'm trying to get them out a bit faster after the long dry spell.
So-ho, where does this leave us? Mary working with Moriarty and now, what? Taking over his role or acting out on her own? Sherlock and John in the know and watching her every move? They are particularly dangerous to villains when they see eye to eye, you know. Mycroft has finally turned up something useful with maybe more to come? Perhaps he's finally getting used to what's had him so distracted of late and things will stop slipping through the cracks.
Jim Moriarty was standing at the bar with Moran and talking to Greg. John stepped away from Sherlock as though he had been caught at something and turned to face the bar fully. He watched for a moment as Jim laughed at something Greg said and then once more when Moran added a word or two. It clicked in John’s mind: a decision. His life would be forever changed.
Yikes, friends! So many questions and many more I didn't mention. Gah!
“Not them! The sisters! The human sisters. The elder shut out the younger at a very young age. It’s the story of their reconciliation.”
“You won’t,” John answered, face open but decisive. He gave Sherlock’s wrists a squeeze. “Please.”
Absolutely. Bone. Dry.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What do you mean?” Greg asks. When Sherlock only stares back pointedly, the smile on Greg’s face fades.
“We saw a match on TV once.”
“Hello, Mary,” John walks around the desk to face her properly. “What can I do for you?”
“I am NOT frightened or even concerned. Moriarty WILL NOT succeed. I won’t let him.”
“He’s cute. I just couldn’t resist,” she shrugs, unapologetically.
“And?” Budreau prompts him in a disinterested tone.
John puffed out a breath of annoyance as his eyes ran the length of the floor like laser beams tracking prey. Though his focus was razor sharp, it was still a challenge to find any one person amid the countless bodies crammed together in the space, but the man he was looking for was very hard to miss. He was very distinctive in his look and manner. He always put on a show for John’s benefit or was getting into a fight that he never started, as he often declared in a, frankly, obnoxious tone to everyone within five feet. John huffed again. The man he was looking for was decidedly not there and never had been, in spite of his promise.
Gosh, it's harder to think of questions tonight. Moriarty's dead. Magnussen's dead. Mary's dead. Janine is locked away.
“Can you be more specific?” John laughed, but looked anyway in the direction Sherlock pointed with his head. “There are quite a few.”
you trust me?” John asks slowly, voice rife with hesitation.
Love always, Jane
“Extra blankets are on a shelf in the closet,” he explains. John’s gaze follows his hand and then Sherlock as he turns to walk toward another door. “This is the bathroom. Go ahead and use the towels and washcloth hanging on the rack.”
Sherlock stares with somber eyes as Moriarty laughs hoarsely. A soft breeze ruffles his curls as he looks straight ahead and then angles his head down to look away from Moriarty. Water splashes against the side of the boat and the sirens grow louder.
“I’m flattered,” she laughed and then took on a more serious tone. “There’s nothing wrong with letting someone else in, you know.”
I just want to remind you of a couple of terms:
As you may have guessed, it's not over yet and persistence is still key. I love you all and hope you stick with me. We'll get through this together.
“I learned to watch and listen to everything over my years in medicine,” John shrugs, ducking his head at the praise.
Greg and Sherlock make a discovery and save the life of someone they know.
“Looking forward to it, dear.”
I hope you all like it. No spoilers, so...
I thought I'd take a moment to remind you all of how I said this Part might go into extended chapters. Well, I was wrong.  It all broke down into ten after all and I will be posting chapter ten, the last chapter tomorrow. Da da daaaaaa!! I hope you all like it. Until then, friends, feel free to tell me how you feel and what you think. I love you all.
But you’re just in my way.
Don't panic. All will be answered in time.
Well, y'all, I'll keep editing and we'll see where this next case takes the boys. It's bigger than they think and will test them in ways no one would expect. How's that for a teaser? LOL. The DP questions here would simply be frustrated exclamations. "What? What the fuck is THAT supposed to mean?! Test them in ways... Why don't you just say Sherlock gets lost in a corn maze and John is thrown head-first off a motorcycle? I mean, jesus, that's a much better teaser." And Deadpool would shuffle away, still making sarcastic remarks as a car flies by and knocks over a fire hydrant, water shooting up in the air and raining back down on him while he pays no mind.
“You’re very tired, aren’t you?” Sherlock interrupts forcefully. His voice is gentle and he ghosts his fingers over John’s hand. Where John first looked hurt, he now looks calm. He extends his fingers to touch Sherlock and the detective takes his hand. “I’ll stay until you fall asleep and I will be back tomorrow. As soon as I get Rosie to school, I promise.”
* Will the boys EVER have any peace? I mean, they have off and on, but real extended peace?!?
What do John and Sherlock have to argue about? Two men so deeply in love and close to their wedding date. What could they possibly have to argue about? ... Perhaps a certain consulting detective who hasn't necessarily done all of his groomly duties?
“I...got married.”
“They do, yes,” the corners of Sherlock’s mouth quirked up.
I’m the girl you’d die for
His grey eyes pop open and immediately focus on the door to his suite. He stills the bow, but does not move it from where it hovers over the strings. He waits a beat or two as if there were rests in the piece and then hears it again. Two quiet knocks on his door. Sherlock glances at the clock by the flat screen. Midnight.
“John,” he says gently. The doctor looks up at him in surprise, his eyes sparkling and wet. Sherlock furrows his brow. “John?”
BAHAHAHAHA! If you've seen DP, you know what that means. Tee hee. As another aside, but to all of you, my 5 year old loves DP because he loves unicorns just like she does. Hahahahaha! Crying! (And no, she has never seen the movie. She only knows what I tell her and has seen his pic and merch EVERYWHERE. And she knows how much Mommy loves him.  ;D  )
He goes through everything that took place and in as much detail as he can. Sherlock cringes when John gets to the fire escape and alley. The bastard came so close to finding John there and would have surely killed him where he stood. No place to run. Sherlock does not interrupt, forcing back his fear and worry for John.
Thank you again for all of your support. I love you all and you all keep me right. :)
This is the sound of my soul
His leg bounces restlessly on the seat, the only outlet for his agitation.
John pushes past Sherlock roughly and has his hand on the doorknob before he stops cold. He spins around quickly with an accusatory finger pointing right in Sherlock’s face. If the man wasn’t furious before, he is now. Sherlock glares down at John with a scowl on his face that sends ice shooting through John’s veins.
“No,” Sherlock replies after a moment. “Not his style. We lived in an upscale apartment downtown. It was right where he needed to be, both for his work and social life.”
4. Speaking of our duo, will they grow ever closer now that they are working the derby racket AND trying to solve this mystery together? (If you know me, and you do, you already know the answer to that question too.)
“Mycroft? Why haven’t I seen him?”
3) John is very obviously confused, caught between feeling his love for Sherlock and not knowing what the hell it is. IS HE GOING TO FIGURE IT OUT? IN THIS LIFETIME? Because Goddammit, Jane, how much can the heart take?
Okay, now no spoilers.
“If you insist upon besmirching my choice of film, I’ll thank you to leave.“
“Why can’t he, Sherlock?” he asks with a sly look in his eye. Sherlock stares a moment longer and then shakes his head dismissively, resuming the pacing. “He’s a great guy.”
As the song continued, the other dancers and the club with its lights and noise fell away. Suddenly, John and Sherlock were the only two people for miles around. It was just them and the music. They danced and danced and the song seemed to go on forever. John turned to face Sherlock, their bodies still close together and hips moving as one. John looked into those grey eyes, sparkling and bright, and completely lost himself in them. They were not the eyes of a stranger he had just met or someone he had seen from across the club, but those of a friend. A friend he had known for years and who knew John as well as he knew himself. Those eyes filled John with comfort and a longing to go to that restaurant Sherlock had suggested, leaving Jim behind for good. Of all the time John had spent with Jim, he could not think of a single one when he saw this much in his eyes.
“Okay,” John stumbled over his own thoughts, trying to comprehend, “but how can you know all that from just…”
I truly enjoyed the last few chapters of sex and chatting and love, and I hope (know) all of you did too. But now that the Empress of Evil has returned, pray that John and Sherlock make it out of this one okay. And remember...we're nearing the end of this great tale.
“For Rock City,” Groot says solemnly.
“There’s no need to worry about getting her home,” John says suddenly. “Mycroft is going to help her. He’s already arranged it and he’ll help her get settled at home. Since you’re out of town and all. Apparently, he’s taken quite a shine to her.”
get out.”
“I bet Clara was pissed off.”
“You don’t want to change anything about it though,” he stopped and studied John with great interest, the skin beneath his eyes contracting in thought and recognition. “You have a boyfriend and for some time, in fact, but you don’t live together by design. You were close once. Now you can count the number of times he’s been to your flat in the last six months on both hands. You have been to his more, though still not often and you never to stay the night. You have not been intimate for at least a year, but still enjoy spending time together as friends and you’ve wondered if that might not be the better route,” Sherlock sounded as though he could not stop himself if he tried now and John felt a little hot under the collar. The mad genius was definitely going to explain how he knew all of this.
Oh my god, friends, am I using my powers for good? Am I?? I don't even know what to say about this one and I don't want to give anything away, like I haven't already. Ha!
lust after a friend’s boyfriend the way he did after Sherlock, but there were Sherlock’s arms lifting and swaying, lowering slowly and gracefully. Then his undulating hips and his ass, that gorgeous, plush ass in perfectly fitted jeans, swishing and thrusting to the beat. God, it was like watching pornography and now Sherlock was here, right in front of John and not at all with Greg and asking John to dance with him. It was unbelievable, and John was about to say no. Why the fuck would he say no? Why when part of him had secretly hoped for this exact scenario to occur one day?
Read on, Macduff.
“Bloody hell.” John’s eyes are black with desire and wide with surprise. Sherlock can’t help but chuckle. He takes another breath before answering, suddenly wanting to slow the pace and make this night last forever.
(See the end of the chapter for
John’s jaw drops. Whatever he might want to say, although he has no idea what it would be, simply will not come. John is struck completely silent with shock. He stares into Sherlock’s imploring grey eyes and wonders what possessed him to even think such a thing. Why would he take Rosie from her home and her father? What kind of monster must Sherlock think him?
He pauses in both word and action. The two men lock eyes in a very serious gaze.
“Billy Wiggins was poisoned,” John finally says. Greg’s jaw drops again and he stumbles back a step, resting his backside on the desk for balance and knocking over a pencil holder in the process. “That’s why he retired. He told Molly after he left and he told me too. About a week after I started.”
They spend another hour or so in easy conversation before bidding one another good night and going to their rooms.
John’s eyes widened.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock decides quickly that may not have been the best thing to say, but he has no idea what he should have said instead. He clears his throat and gestures to the closet door.

I've had a suggestion for anyone having notification troubles. Apparently, you can subscribe to me as an author and you'll get notifications about any works I post without fail. If you have simply bookmarked my series or one of its Parts, you may not receive notice of new chapters if the system goes wonky. However, I'm assured that subscribing to me JaneOfCakes will result in notice of all postings. I hope it works for those who are interested and try it. Thank you for sharing your vast knowledge of AO3 with me, Pat.
Good god! How much can poor John take? If he and Sarah aren't both BAMFs, I don't know who is.
I'm in one of my moods again, so I'm going to ask some of those sassy questions.
“My name is Sherlock Holmes and this is Dr. John Watson,” he informs everyone in a firm, commanding tone. “He needs medical attention immediately.”
“Bringing me back to where it all began. You do have a…theatrical mind.”
Sherlock’s eyes lit up, making them sparkle a decidedly silver sheen and a brilliant smile spread across his full lips. He offered a hand and John took it, allowing himself to be led onto the floor. As they found a place within the other bodies around them, piano chords rang out through the club and a pure tone began to sing lyrics so ironic that John could not help but smile.
He resolutely pushes the thought from his mind when a hand wriggles free and the ropes behind his back come loose. He moves his arms quickly and bends down to reach his ankles, but stops midway when another sharp surge of pain radiates from the wound and paralyses his body. Releasing a few more bubbles with a stifled cry, John grits his teeth and squints down at his ankles. Still sinking fast, the light of the surface all but gone, John can barely see them. He tries again, slower this time and just reaches his knees before the pain is too great. He straightens and touches the wound under his shirt with tentative fingers, another spike of pain. The water all around gets darker and darker, and a few more precious bubbles escape his lips. John’s chest is on fire with the need for air. It won’t be long before he sucks in a breath of water and a steady flow of silent obscenity is his response.
“I’m going around!” Groot shouts.
“John?”
Sherlock fans: Will he find Moriarty before he comes for John again?
If you say that you are mine, I’ll be here ‘til the end of time, but you gotta let me know.
There is a long pause while they simply stare at each other. A thousand words seem to pass through the air between them. Words of thanks and confession and love and Sherlock wonders if John finally knows, but says nothing. Neither does John, until:
5. What will Sherlock make of this most recent attempt? Hmmm. At least John isn't wearing only boxers and a tee. Or is that a bad thing? A good thing? A hot thing. MM, YEAH.
“You,” the tallest officer commands with a nod at Greg, “get in the boat and keep your hands where I can see them. Slowly.”
“Sherlock, we have worked together for a long time. All of us, and we’re used to your flights of fancy. You know I could care less if you act like a spoiled school boy from time to time because, ultimately, you truly do respect everyone associated with this team,” Mrs. Hudson takes a small step back, allowing the man a little breathing room. “But you will not behave this way straight out of the gate. John has done nothing to deserve your suspicion and his credentials are impeccable. Just trust me.”
“I have not,” Greg said flatly. John pursued his lips and looked away, giving a slight nod as his only confirmation.
All of these questions and more will be answered in the coming chapters. I'm so excited to share them with you!! :D
“Saving her is reason enough to eliminate you,” Sherlock finishes for him as it begins to snap into place. John must believe the same because he is already nodding. “It’s Moriarty. It has to be.”
That said, I'll leave you to it...
3. If he doesn't, how will big brother Greg keep him in line?
Has Molly finally stopped listening to Mycroft?
“No,” John says suddenly.
I do. Mwahahahahaha!
John comes home.
The look they share takes on new life, a new purpose that they both feel down to their bones. A connection, a common bond, and Sherlock makes up his mind in a split second. John Watson must stay in his condo tonight.
“I didn’t miss much,” John amends and takes a quick drink of water. His eyes are shifty and he looks away pointedly. That is absolutely not what he was going to say and Sherlock knows it. And John knows he knows it.
5. Why are they such idiots?
John turns his back on the smug bastard and stomps toward the door, only to stop and spin around to face him again when he hears the man’s reply.
4) Who's next on Moriarty's hit list? Can John and Sherlock foil his plans, or is one of them next?
“Eileen,” he says tersely.
John doesn’t move. His gaze is focused on those soft grey eyes. Soft now in spite of the raised voices and insults. He can see so many emotions within them and he is intrigued. He can’t stop himself from looking and seeing, just seeing. Anger, regret, curiosity, respect, friendliness and interest, and lingering behind it all, panic? And just like that, John’s mood, the air in the room, everything changes. Lifts. The anger leaks out of John’s body and pools on the floor around his feet.
“How do you know it’d take me an hour?” John asked, feeling his mood lighten.
“That’s brilliant!” he exclaimed, clapping the taller man on the shoulder and beaming at him with bright eyes, their depths growing even more blue with his merriment. “It sounds amazing.”
The remainder of the Christmas holiday goes without incident. As the new year approaches, John tries to put Christmas eve out of his mind and move on. If having Sherlock as his friend, his best friend, is the only way he can have him, John will gladly accept. However, his brain has other ideas as Christmas is still front and center in his thoughts. He has barely kept himself from mentioning it to Sherlock in the days that followed AND it has not escaped his notice that Sherlock seems to have no interest in discussing it. It is New Year’s Eve, only seven days later and John feels as if he is going mad.
John glanced up and down the street, letting a car pass and then jogging across the traffic lanes. He splashed through a puddle or two on the way. Droplets sprayed through the air and caught the light of the streetlamps like sparkling diamonds in the night sky. In mere seconds, he stood in front of Sherlock with a grin still on his face as the detective scanned his soaked form with an air of disapproval. John knew he would not ask how it happened, knowing he had deduced it all already.
John purses his lips and widens his eyes in exasperation, moving his body away from his flatmate’s. This is definitely NOT how he wanted their first night sharing a bed to go.
“Yeah,” John glances at the tall man. “Why is that so strange?”
“I know how this must look,” John interrupts, but the seething man cuts him off.
John fans: Is John going to be okay?
After a minute or so, John places the glass on the table and leans back in his chair casually. Sherlock cannot explain it, but he feels totally at ease with this man. He narrows his eyes and leans back in his own chair to suss out why.
“Yes. He’s known John for years. Charles was his advisor in medical school.”
“Quite a bit, I’m sure,” she replies, eyes quickly roving over his body. “I need you.”
“It was a mistake. I’m sorry. It won’t happen again.”
Much love, Jane
(See the end of the chapter for
“All of the above,” Sherlock said simply and John laughed heartily, his head ducking in even closer to Sherlock’s.
“Fine.”
Will John really be okay again or has Moriarty gotten into his head permanently?
“So what do you think, Doctor?” he asks cheekily. “Do I need to find a needle and thread?”
Will he get some kind of message to Sherlock?
You’ll have to tune in next week to see if chapter 13 turns out to be or lucky 13.
Love, Jane
“She shared her suspicions with you.”
This was a fun chapter to write. I thoroughly enjoyed making Greg get a little more drunk with each shot. He's still making sense, but his words start to be just a bit out of order and make a little less sense. Picturing Rupert this way gave me the giggles every time. I also loved writing the more touching dialogue in the latter half. I know romance may not be some people's cup of tea, but I love it, especially between these two idiots. So precious.
“Of course.”
“Piss off, Moran,” John barked, standing to his full height and entering the man’s personal space. Moran had a good six inches on him, but John did not give a shit. He never liked Moran. Part of John had always wanted to punch the sneer of a smile off his face, but he had avoided the temptation. John might just make an exception tonight.
Almost time to leave the hospital.
He rises from his seat on the ambulance bumper next to John to stoop before him. He takes the doctor’s chilled hands in his own warm ones and fixes his gaze on John. They each look into the other’s eyes, searching and asking. Sherlock leans in close and kisses John’s lips lightly. Resting their foreheads together as though they are one, he inhales deeply. John’s air, his breath, he is safe.
“I’m sorry,” he says simply. His big brain cannot come up with anything better or more eloquent than the truth. “I shouldn’t have done that.”
“Well, he didn’t really invite me,” John says with some embarrassment and a hand cupping the back of his neck.
They all raise their hands collectively in a gesture of power, their faces already in triumph as if by the power of Greyskull, they have the power! Their hands drop with the kind of assertiveness held only by a true badass who knows
Anyway, we still have lingering questions! DA DA DAAAAAAA
“I trust gut feelings. It’s what helped lead me to you. The team,” he corrects quickly when Sherlock’s eyes meet his and this time they are startled. “This man, what did he look like?”
“Sherlock,” she begins in a motherly, but stern tone, “surely you trust me to make sure nothing like Anderson ever happens again.”
“I was devastated. And I felt incredibly stupid.”
“A couple of hours.”
John bites his lower lip and shakes away those thoughts. This is no time to get distracted by desire, especially when John is this confused. What he feels, what he wants is so much more than the physical. John wants Sherlock’s mind and soul. He wants to know everything, feel everything. He wants to share Sherlock’s life. John can already feel Sherlock with him, even when he is nowhere near, like he is a part of him. John feels him down into his bones. It’s like nothing he has ever felt before and it is breath-taking.
John’s chest opened and it felt like all the force of Sherlock’s feelings rushed in, like when an anime character is enveloped with light and energy.
“It’s a statement on the human condition.”
Sherlock nods against John’s shoulder and tries to avoid looking him in the eye as he schools his expression, making sure his eyes reveal nothing when they meet John’s. He desperately wants to let out a long sigh and tell the truth, but how can he? How can he tell the beautiful man before him what Moriarty wants to do to him? Hurt him…fuck him.
John opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came out. There were so many things John wanted to say and could give voice to none. The words just hung there in his mind and refused to become the sentences he needed.
Until next time. Much love, Jane
There you go. I hope you enjoy it!
. John could tip his head forward mere millimeters and his mouth would be on Sherlock’s soft cupid’s bow. God, it would be life-altering. Lips so soft, so perfect, and they would move with John’s. He knew they would.
“Something like that. I was an assistant coach because I hadn’t coached formally before, and I was so young. No one was about to give me my own team,” Sherlock corrects. “Mrs. Hudson took a big chance making me head coach at 28.”
“And then when I was a freshman in high school, the P.E. teacher told me derby was a sport exclusively for women.”
Hello, friends! First, I have two apologies. I never did get back to the end notes on the last chapter AND I'm sorry this one took so long to come out. It's been a weird week (eye roll). You don't want to know. I'll try to get the next two out faster. I think there will still be 10 chapters in this Part, but I'll let you know if it changes.
John was enjoying himself so thoroughly, he almost did not notice Sherlock slowly closing the gap between them. It was not a huge shift of the space between them. Sherlock was not suddenly up in his business, grinding against his leg, but he was closer nonetheless. The tips of John’s ears prickled with heat and not just from the dancing. His whole body was hot with it. A burning deep inside of him, just like the feeling low in his stomach was not so much from nervousness as it was from anticipation of what was yet to come. Would Sherlock inch even closer? Did John want him to? Goddamn right he did.
“I visit her too,” Greg shrugs at the unasked question.
So, when we last left our boys they were snuggling and cute in Sherlock’s bed. Awwww. Prior to this bliss, however, John had resigned verbally to Greg and tried to do the same with Sherlock, but the stubborn coach would have none of it. John was soon confessing all that had happened in Baltimore after the team had left. They went home and began to hash out a strategy.
I'm so sorry, my friends, that this has been so long in coming. I was on a very long holiday and while I planned to edit/post in the evenings, it did not come to fruition. I hope you can all forgive me. I do think this chapter was worth waiting for. It certainly makes me smile. Apologies for any type-o's. I don't think I caught them all.
But I will say this. It's one hell of a chapter.
Moriarty fans (if any exist :D ): Just where the fuck is Jim anyway?
Sherlock tilts his head because the man sitting on the couch next to him is absolutely the most amazing sight he has ever seen. He places his water bottle on the coffee table, drawing John’s attention to the violin and bow.
“I look forward to it, John,” he smiles. John smiles back almost like a shy school boy and they share a quiet laugh.
“Right,” John replies stiffly. “Let’s get out of here.”
I love you all and love to keep on entertaining you and hearing from you. You're the best and your support means so much to me. Things are getting a little tricky with me right now. My emotions are all over the place. Posting is truly one of my most treasured joys. Thank you all.
“Legendary?” John laughs. “How do you figure that?”
John eyes the incredible man across the table as he elegantly slides a fork from between his plush lips and chews. John wonders at the feeling that blooms in his chest, all warmth and comfort.
“Sherlock, what…”
Forever, until my life is through
2. Will there be another attempt on Molly's life? (I can't help but smirk here. You knew I'd bring Mycroft into this somehow.)
“What’s her name?”
“In tandem with Moriarty’s activities?”
“Good night, John.”
Or maybe she just feels she and John share something special after their time on the island. And her motivation is perfectly innocent. Yes, that's it. After all, John's a wonderful person and everyone would be happy to spend time with him. Sherlock's right about that. Oh, but Sherlock was jealous before and now Mary is in their midst. And he's already so suspicious of her. "As far as he's concerned, this woman is a case." Anybody notice how he refers to her as "The Woman" now? Hmmmmm.
“Then don’t,” he said sharply, meeting Greg’s eyes again. “All right. Just leave it.”
What the hell, Jane? Is it really a mystery? At the roller derby? Oh, wait. Does it turn out that Molly really is suffering from some kind of delusion? I mean, Sherlock isn't even a detective. John isn't his partner. They barely even know each other. They aren't even married. They're not even divorced!
(See the end of the chapter for
“Alone?” John asked mischievously and Sherlock snorted, obviously quite amused.
Much love always, Jane
Until now.
“Yeah, I suppose that makes sense,” he concedes reluctantly, “but I don’t have my wallet for a hotel. I don’t even have any clothes.”
2. As I was saying earlier, will they be interrupted?
“How can you say that? Moriarty has tried to kill you three times in the last few months and hasn’t succeeded because he hasn’t wanted to. He’s come so damn close, Sherlock, and he isn’t going to stop until he’s finished what he started.”
How will John survive?
“I was about to ask you that,” Sherlock answers with a small smile.
John is fed up with Jim's shenanigans after the catapult and goes to Mycroft for help, much to his chagrin.
“I’ll work on finding those sweatpants,” he says in lieu of a real response.
Jim's game comes to an end.
Another snuggly chapter with our adorable lovers. Once again, the idea of John being so comfortable and feeling so safe with Sherlock is the idea behind why they were able to have sex. It also supports my belief, and I hope yours too, that these two men are made for each other.  *sigh* I love them so. This was an all relationship and healing chapter and I loved writing it. I hope you all loved reading it.
“Oh, lots of things,” he puffs out a breath. “How to see things other people don’t see. The things they tell you with their clothes and mannerisms. Deduction. Mysteries. How to make a mind palace.”
6. Why doesn't this fic warn readers that it's slowburn torture? Haha! Did you notice? I added it. I am much too clever for you naughty people. Heehee.
flirting. He is simply engaging him in perfectly normal conversation.
Billy’s expression darkens and he nods slowly.
I wanted to say that I've been told AO3's notification system might be acting a bit wonky. Some readers aren't being informed of new chapters and, since I have no idea how to fix that, I think all I can do is encourage you all to keep an eye out for new chapters. I'll definitely be posting them. If it goes over a week with no news of updates, go ahead and check because I probably did post.
1. When is Sherlock going to stop fighting with himself and just fess up? For fuck's sake!
Sherlock releases a harsh breath through his nose as he turns to the side and motions for a stretcher. Every skater in the stadium, on and off the track, is down on one knee in solidarity. Smacks is biting her lip hard enough to draw blood. She holds her breath and then inhales sharply as John continues examining her leg while he asks questions. She bites back a cry and squirms, which only seems to increase her pain.
Sherlock put on his scarf and coat and he opened the door. That his trousers were still pooled at his ankles was beside the point...
he's grown used to thank yous that aren't, thank yous that ignore what he just did by asking him to do more, but that's not what he gets now.
I wouldn't miss this for the world!
Kind of.
So Sherlock said, "Was it enough for your essay on human sexuality? That in the first wet dream I remember I was a queen bee on her mating flight?"
And so it begins.
They just let him get on with things...
Sherlock drops an apple. It's the only green one in the batch. He feels briefly bad about that. Now the man won't have any green apples.
One more whisper, only this one was kind of spooky, maybe a little bit evil. "You want to know a thing you can do to get back at him? I did it to my sister once and she hasn't come into my room for a
Sherlock then chatters about how that grey-dusted fuzz feels against his flushed nipples and his neck, how it makes the one pebble up and the other tickle.
Eventually they got around to saying something.
Sherlock disappears. Greg slumps forward, under the illusion he's had a narrow escape...
Afterward he holds Sherlock close against his chest. It's been a long day spent saving the world and they need to rest before it starts up all over again. So John pets Sherlock and whispers, "Must sleep, Sherlock. Must sleep."
London is no battlefield but when John Watson sees one man in a fireman's carry over another's gore-red shoulder his response is immediate: Stop the bleeding.
Sherlock Holmes didn't mean to snort derisively, but that snuff of air drawn sharply
Sherlock felt a small thrill in his nethers. He actually thought those words.
detective. Right away that man went and said a few fateful words as he walked into John's tiny office. Those words were these:
you could work for the fucking pope but I'm still not giving you the god damn skull."
The view from on top of the hill is wide and lovely during the day, showing you a broad swathe of south London, but it's at night when the city shows to its glittering advantage.
And saw which side won.

A crinkle of a turned page by John's ear.
He pissed again, flashed a post-case grin in the mirror, bounced on his toes. He strode into the bedroom, hands on his hips. Another case closed! Another foe vanquished! Another—
what he's about to do. Crawling to safety is what Sherlock Holmes did last month after he got hit in the head with a pipe and couldn't
"Saying a thing doesn't make it true."
The man doesn't know he's banging his head against the window, John's sure of that. John's less sure of himself as he comes alongside the stranger and says in what he hopes is a pleasant voice, "Bad day?"
Sometimes John likes waiting. He can rest then. When there's nothing happening there's nothing against which to rail.
Which was
"No you weren't."
The pub owner answers him again, but Sherlock Holmes doesn't hear her this time either. Doesn't matter, he's already told the woman which employee absconded with the holiday receipts, where the pilfered gin is, and that her girlfriend isn't gay.
It didn't make them bad, it made them human.
"Just a small favour? Please?"
And just like that Sherlock likes it.
Eighty seven minutes later the drugged child was removed from what would have been his tomb, three feet below that tell-tale heart.
"Your son knows how to read already?" said James Watson.
"My mum wore glasses when I was a kid, got contact lenses later, but until she did I always went with her to pick out new frames. She called these sorts of places—" John gestured to the one thousand frames around them, "Imagination rooms. Isn't that wonderful? Maybe you can just think of it that way. Each pair of eyeglass frames is like a new disguise."
For those purple shirts of sex and perhaps Sherlock's fanciest lingerie, this dry cleaner would be the closest to their home as it's just across the street and a bit to the right. I have decided that this dry cleaner has seen many, many interesting things in the windows of 221B because she's up extra early to be available to the before-work crowd, while John and Sherlock are sometimes up extra late. Doing frisky things near the sitting room windows…
All of this was super-okay-fine with John who is a low-key man and who has, since childhood, got off one thousand percent on Sherlock needing him.
Another text the next day.
When they arrive in London neither is met at the airport, and for approximately ten seconds both are sure this is over.
Sherlock stepped close to the shiny, shiny mirror in the very white optometry show room and he scowled. Ha! And there it was, the expression that made the violent voluble and the tremulous talkative. Would the scowl still work if he wore glasses?
Sherlock looks him over carefully. Fights the urge to step away. He feels sure they're not generally this…large. Or maybe they are. Frankly he hasn't ever been this close to one, or if he has he didn't really look. They've never had any relation to The Work, so why would he?
"That's not the same as saying men don't do that."
"Yes, well she still wants to dance with you. You can tell by the little swaying motions and the fact that she
They don't say a word, John Watson and Sherlock Holmes. Instead Dr. Watson puts pressure on the single stab wound and the artery above it, while Sherlock calls for an ambulance, his hand never leaving his wounded brother's face.
John had heard about this Holmes guy, a poncy git if the stories were true, a mouthy man who'd second-guess every diagnosis, argue the placement of a plaster. The thing is, when John asked why the man was in hospital so often his idiot colleagues couldn't tell him.
No, no…he steps right on up to the other side of Sherlock's table, leans over, and
They shook.
John frowns. "Hu?"
And in the process of all that going and all that shouting, John Watson disappeared.
Fortunately Sherlock Holmes doesn't understand appropriate and he's even less familiar with polite, so when John lets him go, when John starts to step away, Sherlock wraps his arms around the man's shoulders and, sweetly, strangely, he rocks John and whispers, "Shhh."
Another flick, another, and with each one John moaned, "Sher…lock, Sher…lock," and when he pushed his hand down between his legs and started humping, that's when wonderful became
And it's there, in the nominal quiet, that John feels suddenly awkward, full of second guesses, and he knows he should let the man go but there's a problem with that, a really big problem.
"It hurts, it hurts," he kept saying, clutching his hand to his chest, hot tears running down his cheeks.
"What do you—"
When the most recent tutor quit, citing his ten pound weight gain, Altamont had despaired.
"Because from what I can see
Meanwhile, at the other end of the supermarket aisle the dark-haired four-year-old beg-shouting at volume is every inch a Holmes, so he clearly belongs to Maureen Vernet Holmes. Maureen's second son was right now holding a spiky bit of over-priced produce hollering, "Yeth mummy, yeth! Dwagon fwoot! We can get it becauth it roarth!"

Molly Hooper's House, West London
The plainest of plain filter coffees in his hand, Sherlock Holmes blinked benignly at the psychology student, the son of the daughter of Mrs. Hudson's sister and a boy Sherlock was 'helping' by answer questions for the young man's college essay. Sherlock was not strictly doing this out of the kindness of his heart.
There are six regular posters to
Greg Lestrade thought he'd help.
It wasn't that the other children on the playground had said anything mean. No, they hadn't said one single thing at all, and that was the
Quiet and a couple dozen feet from the angry man, John paced. Another corner, another tap of his toe.

It's not something John does often in actual fact, but sometimes, when Sherlock's worked too hard or not hard enough, when he's depressed or the joints of his soul are out of true, John'll wake himself early and he'll creep down beneath the duvet, then slowly and carefully he'll lick and suck until Sherlock's cock stirs itself awake, hard, wet.
"Okay, great. So let's get loose first, then I'll tell you my name and you tell me yours, then we'll go shout at Mike, yeah?"
Except when the loonies rang up. Or loony, because he just had one, a deep-voiced git who wanted pints of blood, or eyes, or left thumbs for Christ's sake.
Then John waited until they had been talking for a half hour, until they had made each other laugh again, and until the woman at the table behind their table had left before he finally leaned over and whispered, "Did you really have a dream where you were…you know…and then you…you know?"
"—know domineering and attention-seeking when I'm standing—"
Sherlock shut up with a grunt, went to his knees beside the doctor. "What?"
boy. And he's got them.
The game has no set hours because Mycroft keeps to no clock. While London sleeps, Sydney, Shanghai, and New York scheme and then too does Mycroft. So it isn't odd for Sherlock to again pick up his brother's trail as he glides down the Duke of York Memorial steps near midnight, and it isn't odd for Mycroft to see Sherlock's shadow shifting near those wide and lonesome stairs.
By the end of every lesson Altamont was peering round the nearest corner, holding a bottle of paracetamol. He always shared.
"No!"
John Watson, the man upon the sofa's other end, paused in sipping his skinny mocha latte. He looked at the grumpy stranger. He cut right to the chase: "You counted their kisses."
Then it's just one man left standing, the away man.
Except he does.
. Who knows, maybe when it was rainy Sherlock would have walked the two minutes from his flat to go visit Mr. B…
There were at least three scientific fallacies in that, but Sherlock didn't point out even one. Instead he leaned forward again. John met him halfway and they had their third kiss. Then their fourth.
as loud as he possibly could and for good measure threw two empty cola cans and a rock, striking home with all three. He was rewarded when the black hair went away.
"Look, I'm not going to argue with you but—"
Sherlock Holmes stands at a dusty window and stares out at tarmac, grass, and aeroplanes all faded in the Kabul sun.
It was fine actually, tutors could be arranged to come while Mycroft was at school.
Because Sherlock Holmes will not define himself as gay. Or straight. Or asexual, bisexual, or any mixture, animal, vegetable, mineral. He…he's a Schrödinger's box of sexuality, neither opened nor closed, in a state of forever being anything, everything, or nothing and, and, and
John rolled onto his belly, "Just remembering what you told me about bear hearts."
John looks weepy again. He stares at his hands. "I didn't mean t'. I didn't."
"Because you let me help. It's good you know, helping."
I have no idea if this place sells lube or jam or sex aids, so if I don't know and I took the photo then probably very few of your readers will know. So have the boys pick up any old thing you want from this newsagent and convenience store! Maybe the shopkeeper is sweet on John, maybe she stocks obscure medical periodicals for him. Sherlock is so
What Sherlock loved especially this morning was the jeans that had made their way in a bunch to the foot of the bed. He barely remembered kicking them off last night, falling into bed half-drunk and giddy. Right now they were a perfect mound of soft roughness between his legs, so Sherlock humped and squirmed and huffed.
They stayed in that over-bright shop all night. It was their first date. If you count the cat nap it was also their second.
In the end, the good detective survived his poisoning, courtesy of Dr. Watson.
Oh so delicately John presses into Holmes' stupidly stunning suprasternal notch, and wiggles his finger. Holmes' deeply-relieved sigh travels right on up John's arm, through his chest. And down.
"Says the fool who apparently can't hold on to a simple
Sherlock buys them sandwiches which contain a filling neither can identify but it tastes of fish and smells like pineapple.
"And he asked me to lead the waltz."
"John, are you crying?"
John looked up and up and was busy not discussing things with his nose now, because he sniffed loudly, then giggled and said, "You smell like
But John didn't. John doesn't. Because he learned fast that if he wrote letters to the men and women he left behind they'd contain nothing but the breathless refrain:
when he did the first best thing he ever did, according to the John two years hence. Sherlock leaned over the small table and whispered so softly John had to come close, close enough to feel warm-as-summer breath against his skin. "Then again, I suppose mating for hours and hours…with…with one single drone…I suppose that's a lot more romantic." Then Sherlock smiled.
…and then there he was, all straight-backed and small and smiling. And unequivocally, plainly, obviously
Sherlock loved sucking John's cock. Sometimes what he loved best was feeling John twist beneath his hands, a warm-body squirm that made Sherlock emphatically feel John's presence, blood-warm and real in their bed.
There's no rhyme or reason to it, but sometimes Mycroft's at the shop and he
John presses his finger in the exact middle of Sherlock's pectorals and–
"I will bet you a hundred bloody quid I can."
Sherlock's grin grew. "What," he said, on this the first day of his new life, "is your name?"
The boy with the pretty name blink-blinks and then switches teary-defensive for stern-determined, poking his lispy tongue around in his mouth until he seems satisfied it will do his bidding.
John Watson's brain kind of explodes. With curiosity. About stuff. Because he has been so, so, so bored. So very bored. But this boy clearly knows some things.
Sherlock slowly takes and shakes it.
So John grabs his new friend's small hand and he pulls him off the bench and he waves to his mum and to the boy's dad and he points at all the park flowers surrounding this little cafe and when mummy and Sherlock's daddy nod their permission he pulls his new friend toward them and he says a crapload of stuff super fast.
that film!"
Still, now that he's up close, just about touching it, he's surprised at its delicacy, its warmth, its beauty.
"You are…a god damn…" Sherlock's already scowling, turning to look out an over-bright window. "…genius."
He doesn't hear the driver.
A sensitive boy who can see hurt and sadness in another, will soon learn to hide those things in himself when he's called
odd to both is an unrecognised laugh and then the speed at which a shadow becomes a stranger with a grudge and a knife. Between the two Holmeses the assassination attempt is over before it begins.
The two doctors caught up briefly, made plans for dinner. By the time Sherlock's 'moment' was over, John was long gone.
He's deduced the writer is a man and that he comes on Sunday and Thursday nights.
alongside Sherlock. He further insists Sherlock had no reticence at shoving him—and his bleeding face—in front of the doorman to get them into the tenants-only building.
"You said there'd be time to—"
The man acts like Sherlock.
facing that way and that's when it happens.
He didn't want their help
The fifth and sixth kissers each smelt of eggnog, which made John giggle, and he was sure both were men (one was). The seventh definitely was and the eighth and ninth kisses were both from the tall, pretty, black woman who'd been chatting him up earlier.
Three hours and four times that many giggling fits later, John said, "—and you're just lucky I backed you up when it was the man's
"DI…what? Come again? No, I know what chicken feathers are, what the hell is a Fresnel lens? Oh, that's no problem, I've already said they can have everything they ask for. No I'm not angry."
The small man, Dr. John Watson, glanced around the hotel banquet room suspiciously.
"—next to it."
No, that's not right.
Dawn was blushing through the curtains when the chill got to be too much for Sherlock's toes. He woke again, yawned again, got up to pee again. All that beer last night had helped close the football fraud case, but it hadn't done much for Sherlock's bladder.
These two things led to a couple other things: Sherlock immediately trusted the boy and so Sherlock answered him.

"Are you going to take your pain meds?"
John tugged his thin white lab coat tighter, adjusted the stethoscope at his neck. "It's a

"I know you can hear me."
"You'll finish at least thirty percent faster."
It continues to happen like this:

As his brain frantically retrieves olfactory facts for which he has no use, Sherlock Holmes presses a fist to his chest and for a long moment he does not breathe.
a six-and-a-half warranted the risk of permanent disability, but Sherlock was not a giver-upper about things on which he should emphatically give up, and so Sherlock used his deepest, soothingest voice to calm Mr. Sexy—uh, Mr. Stroppy down, but that just made the tiny man more sweary for some reason and so everyone shut up and got back into the car and everything was good for an entire eleven seconds while a preoccupied John drove resolutely toward a parked car.
"You should use both hands."
Sherlock agreed that this was so.
he mutters
"—well hello there."
Physically Tesco is about one minute from 221B Baker Street, with a small M&S being about two minutes. Up the road about twice as far is a Sainsbury's, while I've no clue where Waitrose is in regards to the boys.
Not on the bike though.
"My name's John," John says, wiping his nose on the back of his hand and sitting down on the little bridge, small feet hanging over the water but not touching.
It takes Sherlock three seconds to realise John is waiting for an answer. Sherlock nods.
"I mean, I want to make it easier for you to

Sherlock sighed, his sorrow entirely too large for his skinny frame.
This memorial is a wall of plaques remembering women, men, and children who gave their lives to save others. Many of the people are siblings who died saving a sister or a brother, or young people who put themselves in harm's way so another would live and in that act they themselves died.
John seems to think about his answer, then shrugs. "Sorry. I didn't mean to test you." Before Sherlock can say anything, John does. "Okay, I did. But I have one more."
What Sherlock Holmes said at first was nothing. And then Sherlock geared up to say a whole range of things, things that would have begun with doctor, army, and invalided, and ended with psychosomatic, oversexualised, repressed tendency toward alcoholism, and short, because when Sherlock feels stupid he opens his mouth and
That would have been that except it wasn't. Once two objects are in orbit around each other it takes something quite dramatic to break them apart.
John never did learn that his mother went to see Mr. Reder, tearing so many strips off him that Reder ducked his head and apologised every time he saw her afterward. Even twenty years later.
Finally John turned, could still only see in peripheral vision…a black curl? He wanted to holler at the man behind him And?
John reeled back. "You didn't get to…to…to see it?"
Sherlock paused in the delicate handling of his client's privates. He allowed his brows to raise.
Sherlock hooted. They'd been so busy the last two weeks he hadn't even had a chance to do the thing with the slices of nasal cartilage. Well, he knew exactly how

John Watson was worse.

"I think it was your recommendation that clinched it, Mike."
Yes. Well. About that it turned out Al Holmes was a liar.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. "Always."

The man closed his mouth on words unsaid, and nearly smiled.
John Watson was not going to argue. Not now. About this. John
But first it was lucky for Altamont Holmes.
Sherlock's about to do the expected: offer a marginal nod and turn away, when the small man does the unexpected: He plucks up a little round soup container and puts it in Sherlock's trembling hands.
"You soar my soul," murmured the smitten DI.
"Ristretto!"
Sherlock looked at the short stranger with his short blond hair. He was immediately impressed by a couple things. The boy was very smart because he'd naturally stood in the tree's shadow, as perfectly invisible to Mycroft a dozen yard away as was Sherlock. He was also impressed by the boy's expression, which had every necessary nuance of
And then everything starts being awkward.
"But they really don't."
The last half of the sentence is crossed out and added beneath:
I know it's not the fault of my records, which are meticulous as ever: back garden, 28º north, 45.3º west, well behind Hooper's hyacinth border, left of the snail planter.
with those big hands of yours."
The two start…something…in those comments. Sherlock pretends he's ignoring it. Pretends he always checks his comments twice an hour. He pretends he doesn't look up "that funky cafe near Waterloo station; you know, the one with the French clock outside?" And he pretends a case brought him to that same cafe the day the two men meet.
Cheery, solicitous, courteous he was everywhere.
"It's my patella and believe me it's fine."
And somewhere in those months between then and now Sherlock Holmes became something he would never stop being: He became John Watson's biggest fan.
John leans forward and whispers, "Incredible."
He looked through old wrought iron at the two men in the distance. Faintly he heard the words idiot, moron, army, and cheese.
Biscuits!
John looked the tall, pretty bloke over slowly, grinned, licked his lips. "My very ex-girlfriend."
John stood, started to say something, then changed his mind about what he was going to say. He gestured at the abandoned Borgiolis. "Your shoes."
Sherlock's shaky with it, with the need, and it makes him loose-limbed, his muscles already going post-coital soft as he pants at each begged-for push. John's a little bit amazed how much he feels with the head of his cock, how he feels it slicking against the tight-wrinkled skin of Sherlock's balls, how with it he can feel Sherlock jerking himself.
Some tones of voice halt even those disinclined to obedience. Even when slurred John Watson’s was such a voice.

Currently made up of mostly growth-spurt arms, Sherlock threw himself forward and used those lengthy limbs to smack all the flowers out of John's hands. He then step-tripped backward and started to cry.
"Oh so very much no."
Sherlock, hands rising to cup John's face, could not be reached for comment.
for a reason—and helped John get a library card. Then together the little boys borrowed ten books on knot making. Within four weeks of knowing each other both family homes contained dozens of decorative ropeworks, including monkey fists, ocean plaits, and sailor's knots. Within six Sherlock knew how to climb trees. Before twelve weeks was out John had learned to read. And for the next sixteen months the little boys were inseparable.
John holds Sherlock tighter and rocks him gently, "Tell me why you're sick sweetie, do you know? Can you tell me?"
Again he's amazed at the size, and again Sherlock murmurs something complimentary and the blond-haired man grins wider, and says, "Would you like a ride?"
Sherlock doesn't reach for the man's extended hand. Instead he stares at John's shoes, then his ears, then out the window. "You didn't know."
is probably where they buy the lube. Also I’m sure I went to a Boots that stocked vibrators. And not the kind that soothes sore muscles.
Apparently proximity wasn't necessary for continued conversation however, for the man added, "Though not all men find prostate stimulation stimulating of course."
Mr Holmes tightens his fist round the squishy faux fruit in his hand. The machine purrs its happiness at the renewed flow of fluids.
Anyway, now I'm lost somewhere in Wandsworth because all the street signs use some sort of indecipherable Celtic font, I can't find the driving college, and I feel it's unfair for John to expect me to wander aimlessly. That is why I'm sitting here with my coffee and a muffin and in a minute I'll tell the barista I know she's having an affair with the town librarian. I'm sure this will lead to a lively conversation and that I can then— [Sherlock, we've talked about this.]
"It's very hot," John said and held it further out so Sherlock could feel. Sherlock did, touching quite gingerly. He peered close, tongue out the corner of his mouth, and said, "It was a bee, wasn't it?"
Dance with a man long enough, your hand on his shoulder or arm or hip and, if you're quiet like John Watson, if you're observant like Sherlock Holmes, over time you'll see things, learn things.
And yet…
"Finishing faster is the whole point, yes?"
This concludes our short little tour of Regent's Park as it relates to 221B. If you want a super large map of the Park, so you can get the names of places right, here is
John nodded, fingered a pair of ugly black spectacles. "I could help," he said. "With the eyeglass frames. If you want."
it. He narrows his eyes at it.
John opened his mouth to say something but what Sherlock had said was a little bit true so he closed it again.
Best graduation party
"Hello."
Sherlock's eyes drift closed on the exhale and he counts the heartbeats thrumming away beneath their hands.
Four people glance at John.
Sherlock is a Schrödinger's box of sexuality, neither opened nor closed, in a state of forever being anything, everything, or nothing.
So while John undid his jeans, Sherlock undid John's shirt, and when John started to wank, Sherlock started to lick wetly at John's nipples, then sucked the moisture away noisily, only to leave even more spit behind when he was done.
Maiko Sato Mayfair Jr. (yes, a woman can be junior, something Maiko still explains with more good grace than her friends think reasonable) nodded at her prospective client.
I have seen but not observed! I must accept that at twelve my night vision isn't what it used to be, for I now notice the prints look remarkably like young Miss Munchkin's more delicate paws. If she thinks digging up my scientific research again will get me to reconsider her as a sidekick, I'll just say that kitten–
I also haven't noticed any particular jam flavour favoured in the UK, it seems strawberry, apricot, marmalade, and all the typical flavours you find in the US are popular here as well. You can get jam for super-cheap in the large supermarkets, literally 25 pence for a normal-sized jar. Lemon curd is usually there too.
"Fucking queer pansy."
Sherlock took a deep breath and at last committed to this stranger, plopping his butt onto the lawn. It was here that the universe, which has always and
"Tell me."
of them."
Life-changing words.
(Um, right. Well. Let's just let John calm down and I'll tell you that this shop is a tiny bit further along Marylebone than the M&S. Call it a two minute walk from 221B at the most. Possibly a lot less if you're fueled by rage and there is sewage in your favourite brogues.)
—the rocket launched.
All right then. I still have more lined up for
London…he can see for miles in every direction it seems, and this woman, so excited, standing on tip-toe to see over exactly nothing…well.
"That's…great," Sherlock says because he can't think of anything else to say, which is good because it gives John something to say. "So you, uh, you want a ride on my bike then?"
They wait a bit more. Then they both have the same genius idea at the same time.
A dark-haired little boy who seems too long in some places and much too big in others, will learn to reflexively respond when kids shout, "Hey bobble head!"
Lurking and listening for ten long minutes, Sherlock heard nothing. Not a single footfall, not one shifted tea mug.
Though he really didn't have the temperament for it, Cesare would have made a good therapist. Because Cesare realised something lovely was happening just then, and that something didn't include him. He also realised that if he made a break for it now, they probably wouldn't notice.
John grunts, "Hu?"
When he's had a good day there's no one who's a bigger fan. Those days you'll hear Sherlock praise himself for stunning deductions, spotting obscure clues, or for phrases turned just so.
John adored them.
"What have you noticed?"
"I hope you didn't bully the four-year-old so unprofessionally."
Strike that.
Honey!
This turned out to be lucky for Madeleine Hamlyn Watson, John Hamish Watson, and Sherlock Holmes, in that order.
"Can I do it again?"
"They don't exist John."
John Watson went dead still. Sherlock grinned, certain he'd shown the little—
Having said that, right now NSY is where it's been for nearly half a century so here's what's close to it, here are the things Greg Lestrade sees and, one hopes, enjoys. Like a sandwich at Gregg's, or a stroll in the park with the British government.

John leaned away, to make room for his incredulity, and said, "Who the hell
"You fancy me and I fancy you and people who fancy each other do the kissing thing..."
"You're talking too fatht John!"
John Watson goes to his knees under that bar, right down there where the fetid water's collected from the broken bar sink, right there where rubbish no one ever sweeps up crusts in the corners, and with steady hands he touches the bartender's forehead, the pulse in his neck. He peels back an eyelid and John can see in those wild skittering eyes that the man wants to push him away, that he reads all the signs of John's help as potential hurt, and when the man half-succeeds, scooting backward with heels scraping against the filthy floor, John gets behind him and sits down hard, so that the man shoves himself backward and into John's open arms.
There's another part of John that's still bigger than his self-pity and that's his god damn
"That's it."
The driving instructor, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, had frankly had it up to the proverbial
A looker from the look of things—curly hair, fine cheekbones, a sensual mouth—but definitely, certainly, emphatically
And right there and right then two idiots start falling in love, because Sherlock Holmes looks at John Watson, lefty bisexual doctor biker who plays snooker, and he starts giggling like the hormone-addled mad. For the first time though not the last John Watson follows his lead.
"I've never heard John Watson decline a date with a beautiful woman."
Now, every few years, one of them remembers something from that first time they met. Every few years, usually when they're lazily spooned in bed at night, staring at the rain on the bedroom windowpane, one will say, "Remember…?"
John had a hard time finding work after Afghanistan.
And almost immediately John Watson responds. And responds. And
The three main schools, each less than a minute from Montague Street are: University of London (UL) where John Watson "in the year 1878...took my degree of Doctor of Medicine" as he says in
Sherlock's stiff-backed silence said more than words. Mike chuffed out a breath, nodded at nothing. "Well it was good, the McCann case. Everyone at Bart's was glad to help.
The small man across from Maiko Sato Mayfair sat in his chair so stiffly he appeared bound to it.
upon the occasion of her birth.
Wait…
The first time was forgettable.
It did not take a deductive genius, therefore, to understand that the man on his knees—which Sherlock was not to ask about—thought it was Sherlock who looked very nice.
British Museum is perhaps the most famous resident of Bloomsbury (yes, it's named after the famous writers' group) and Montague Street runs right along the museum's east side.
Plus Mycroft looks so good in dusk light.
By the punch bowl Gregory Lestrade was deep in conversation with a St. Bart's toxicologist. Off under one of the ridiculously bright lights Bengamen Haddad was showing off the ring his wife had bought him for his birthday. And Dimmock—John still didn't know the man's Christian name—was sidling up to the buffet and pretending this was not his fourth go at the Christmas biscuits.
finger at him. John then reached to and undid his own belt. "The last time
I like to think of every day as a chance to learn something new, don't you?
John looks away from the blond man who, yes, was openly staring now.
Yet John Watson's many things, and one of them is dutiful. Which is why, on this long autumn day every November, the captain and doctor does his duty: He visits a London cemetery—never the same one; it would be impossible to know the resting place of each of those he served with, cared for, or simply once knew—and John puts a poppy wreath on the saddest grave.
"Pressure's her thing. Dom, sub, oh that's for confused children. But a deadline, a ticking clock, the need to hurry, to do it now or not do it? That's what gets her going."
To be sure, John was as drunk as every other man at that outdoor table, but none of the others had twice served under a doctor constitutionally unable to remember the names of anyone, and so called everyone—
Sherlock's eyes did that thing again, the opening wide thing. People didn't usually offer to help him. So yes, he wanted that. Very much so.
Sherlock wants to say things right now. A dozen things about helping, about trying to help and how they
Not that Sherlock would say that to the man himself, because Sherlock is in this biker bar as a preliminary for a case, one that'll be far more 'intriguing' than Lestrade's sewer strangler. That this case has required the purchase of shiny latex trousers and seven inch heels is beside the point, and
The point is gay bikers. Or straight bikers. Or actually one biker that could also be anything, everything, or nothing, there were no checkboxes for what the man seems to be, except jaw-dropping.
John kind of liked the job, but he knew something was missing. He just didn't know what.
but Sherlock heard them anyway.
One person in the crowd is the small, uniformed man Sherlock convinced to dance with Greg. Even with a ball-gowned woman between them Sherlock can smell the rare scotch that was the price the man asked for his matchmaking aid.
the wingman, never the bride.
John Watson had walked all the way across the park in order to pose this question to this intriguing stranger, because John Watson kind of has a thing for covert ops and boy did the kid hiding behind the tree look like he was doing something cool and covert.
John started to say something, but the tall man handed him a box, flicked out coat tails, and settled on a bench, imperious. John went to his knees in front of him, as if this were the most natural thing in the world.
If Sherlock's lesson took place in the back garden the tutor inevitably found Altamont's thin face peering alertly from the window overlooking the picnic tables on which books were spread.
But right now John was kind of woozy with his disbelief so he whispered, "Your brother should be sorry."
"Cats, 64 days!"
"Then there's your careful shave, the tuck of your shirt, the expensive wine but the cheap cheese: You have a date with…your boss?…which means
"No it's…it's…"
Immediately the man settles.
Lower."
It just figured that they only figured themselves out after John joined the army.
Really it was the rocks.
Confused at the other boy's confusion, Sherlock waved a noodley arm at the waterfowl and was maybe about to start crying again.
He may not have a living one, but Sherlock thinks that probably qualifies the young woman as a friend, though they spoke just one time when she was alive.
Then a friend of a friend had suggested Madeleine Hamlyn Watson. Within five minutes of their phone conversation Madeleine had agreed to tutor the youngest Holmes. When then warned that her new charge was inclined to flit and fly from topic to topic Madeleine said the fateful words that would change the life of John Watson and Sherlock Holmes forever.
It only takes Sherlock two seconds this time. He nods again.
John's hips slowed as Sherlock got louder and with the dreamy certitude of a man who knows what his man likes, John took hold of his own legs and spread them wider.
"They don't."
"I know! But Mycroft doesn't! He says it's stupid and derivative and scientifically inaccurate and since I'm studying for my GCSEs I wasn't supposed to even be at the cinema and so he told on me and daddy came to fetch me."

Ha. John Watson was not going to be
The moment the man realises John's not interested his interest evaporates. He sits down hard, scowling. "This isn't half as easy as I thought."
The moment they start waltzing the DI wishes he hadn't drunk so much. He didn't think he was going to do anything but wear a suit and sit about telling Sherlock what to do, for once. "I'm Greg, John. Uh, no, just Greg. Lestrade. I'm Greg Lestrade."

For some reason John checked that other guy again but he was still texting, so clearly this curly-headed stranger was addressing
Mike laughed, led them both to a bench. "Getting a lot of cases then?"

In among all this is also the massive and scary-looking
A sensitive little boy who tries to give another boy a big bunch of Valentine's Day carnations will learn that his teacher thinks that's wrong when the man tells him, "No John, no. Take those back. Boys don't give other boys flowers, that's not okay."
Seven years older than Sherlock, Mycroft was taller, smarter, more stubborn and, most grievous of all, he thought it was wrong that Sherlock had gone to the cinema to see—
It isn't the response Sherlock expects when he returns two days later. Neither is his own reply.
This time he'd shown up at the morgue in person, demanding John's skull. Well not John's
"Tell me," John whispered, biting the salt-sweet skin of Sherlock's neck.
Which is why Sherlock sometimes comes to Abney Park cemetery, slow-wanders its muddy paths, stops in front of an old monument—one made new with the addition of the young woman's ashes—and he shows his gratitude to her with a moment's pause and a silent
"Your hand is on my penis."
If you want to write about Sherlock's life before John, and would like to know a bit about Montague Street, I hope this chapter offers a bit of aid. Be sure to look
At this point the cells in John's body are moving so quickly he can almost feel his fingernails growing and his wisdom teeth coming in. He vibrates at Sherlock to share these facts and Sherlock does a thing.
And so everything went back to normal, where normal is broadly defined as Sherlock being brilliant and annoying, Lestrade being long-suffering and grateful, and winter turning into spring turning into summer turning into a very lovely autumn evening.
"Heeeeey there, y'know what? You're right and I'm sorry, sincerely. I don't know hardly anything about ropes or knots. My, uh, my sister taught me some of that years ago and I guess it was me making stuff up. That doesn't matter though, what matters is we wanna get loose, yeah?"
If asked later—and he wasn't in any condition to answer if he
Broadly speaking, there are four main supermarkets here and in order of cheapest to pricey they are: Tesco, Sainsbury's, with a tie between Waitrose and Marks & Spencer (called M&S). Want a good ready-made meal? M&S or Waitrose. Cheap and easy and grab-it-on-the-way home? Tesco, because they are pretty much everywhere.
This was because Sherlock had shot up tall since his twelfth birthday and all that

The thing to do with fools is ignore them, and so at first everyone does, tourist, trader, and the man motionless in their midst.
"Well I learned from
Back then need was expressed in the innocence of hand-holding and knowledge sharing. Today it was expressed by offering his body to a husband that had stayed up too late, over-caffeinated himself stupid, and knew that "an orgasm stimulates the release of melatonin, oxytocin, and vasopressin and should calm me down" something-something "before Lestrade" something "any moment."
But John Watson's praise? To that Sherlock has not responded once.
The stranger doesn't even pause. He steps right on up, reaches for a bottle of wine.
Understand this: John's been discharged from the army for less than seven weeks. He was in hospital and then physical therapy for ten weeks previous. Before that he was busy being deployed to an Afghan hot-spot and getting shot. Add these up and John's not had sex with anything beyond his own hand for over six months. At this point the good Dr. Watson was ready to mislay his heterosexuality and cough up a lung if it meant Mr. Pretty kept patting his back.
John nods, pulls into himself in a way no one ever sees because no one sees the doctor who saves them, not really. And it's fine, it's all fine, John understands that people need plausible deniability of their own fragility.
Now Sherlock had no clue what to do.
Once lost, forever found.
The interesting thing this time was the lost boy.
"You're unemployed and sleeping on your sister's lilo. You don't have one hundred pounds to lose."
"I'm sorry," Sherlock said. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry," he said again and he kept saying it and they let him keep saying it and saying it until he ran out of pain to fuel him, then ran out of arrogance to protect him, until he could finally
"I'm John. I turned this many yesterday."
Baker Street. The other two of which I'm aware are around the corner on Marylebone Road (mar-lee-bone). Actually this is a two-for-one photo as the Boots Pharmacy beside the station is also their closest big pharmacy.
This was the third studio he'd come to and he'd have gone to a fourth and a fifth until he didn't see someone slyly narrow their eyes, until he didn't notice a flaring of nostrils as if something smelled bad, until he found a place that didn't care he was the best man at the wedding of two men.

John knows when people will hear. Yet even when he knows they won't, sometimes he talks anyway because sometimes it's he who needs to hear what he has to say.
have satisfactory sex."
The man who remains, the one with the faint flush, looks at John Watson and realises three things. John Watson has been here the whole time. He's heard everything. And certainly he thinks Sherlock Holmes is a dick.
Not only
it's not okay. Knowing why makes it real.
Because it hurt.
John drew a deep, gasping breath, lifted his head, and on a hysterical keening exhale said, "Oh god I must really love you to have said yes to this."
The park often sees city workers taking their lunch on the benches there, but it is never really a busy place, so it's easy to take your time and to see what it is that makes this place so special. And that is this:
So it
Sherlock didn't wait for a reply, instead getting onto the flat roof and walking over to the little kid who was even

I would really like to get back to the, to the snogging, as you call it."
Another beep soon calls John to another donor's couch. There he fusses over the machine while making polite conversation. It's a slow morning, with just three donors and John the only one on the floor. Becca's on her break, Tariku won't be in until the lunch surge, and–
"Because I'm not looking. If I was looking I would admit I'm looking."
He was a little disappointed.
There's a small part inside John, a small, much-older part inside him that's thinking
For Sherlock Holmes, before there was Baker Street, there was Montague Street. Says the good detective in
he starts dating again.
What they care about is… "Push, pu-pu-push John. Oh!"
and that's about the time Sherlock told John to remove his hands from the wheel and that's when all the tussling started and the swearing, the fogging and the failing too, and by the time John finally took his foot off the brake and the stalled car lurched and hit the other car
"Get the wet shoes off as soon as you can, you'll warm up faster."
Sherlock Holmes looks up, at the man between whose thighs this beauty stands. Again he's amazed at the size, and again Sherlock murmurs something complimentary and the blond-haired man grins wider, and says, "Would you like a ride?"
"Fffuuuuck off!"
"What?"
But Sherlock doesn't look up and John doesn't come back and so Sherlock reaches for a fresh pile of napkins and Sherlock writes and writes some more and then, chin to chest, he goes to the card catalogue and puts a note into every one of the four dozen drawers and a pretty patron nearby says something witty but he doesn't look up, Sherlock doesn't look up, he goes to the pub window and he counts his breaths and he doesn't look up.
Sherlock grinned, like a child given a sweet.
"Who are doctors."
"Come back."
Hooper is calling me in for dinner. Ordinarily I'd finish my vital work for my brain rebels at stagnation, but tonight it's Devon crab as we enjoy another episode of Murdoch Mysteries.
to his brother's expected
So it's not the man's body or bad jokes that draw Sherlock. To be honest he's not sure what he's seeing when he stares, but Sherlock knows he'll keep doing it until the man makes him stop.
John frowns. He doesn't recognise the number. He deletes the message.
(really John?) [Yes, really Sherlock] I may or may not have got our hire car up onto two wheels as we chased a suspect down by the wharf. I consider it ironic that this upset John, since he can't even drive a car on four.
In the dark Sherlock nodded. In the dark John wriggled his wrist until he could feel…there it was, a trailing edge of rope. He clutched as much of it as he could with his fingertips and gently tugged.
Which means that the short-haired biker (
"—left and right atrium and left and right ventricles."
Sherlock opens his mouth to relay what he thinks of shadows and justices when Greg, tipsy and happy about it, talks right over him, "Now see here, I didn't ask to come to your brother's black-tie embassy do.
"Asian!"
and you really must watch where you sit.
There are six regular posters to The Science of Deduction forum. Most leave comments nitpicking Sherlock's methods or conclusions, his morals or his manners. Of course Sherlock replies to these. In detail. The day they're posted.
"I am not releasing the mother-fucking wheel."
"Lower!"
John Watson leans close, whispers, "So…can you do me a favour, just a small one?"
Still and all, John's about to say something along the lines of, "Thanks a lot but no…" because John's still not ready to acknowledge certain personal things, but you know what? Mike has pretty much had it.
Sherlock's mouth falls open. He's been watching the wrong man. He got it wrong.
So since that would happen to everybody, obviously it wasn't John's fault when getting bored happened to him.
"You shut it. I don't like his type."
you down."
Still, on his way home from the library Mycroft picked up a cinema magazine with that ridiculous space pirate on the cover. How Sherlock thought she was—never mind. It was a peace offering, he didn't
That first kiss was ridiculously soft, which made John think it was a man trying to kiss the way he thought a woman would. He was wrong. And right. It was a woman trying to kiss the way she thought a man would kiss if he was trying to pretend he was a woman (yes, she was overthinking it).
What John doesn't know is how to stop trying. Because if he doesn't ask the coffee shop barista out, or chat up the woman queuing behind him, or get the number of his psychiatrist's secretary
“Caring is not an advantage?” John asks with a frown. Sherlock looks at him as he lets his head turn down, releasing a sad sigh. The detective takes a hand off one of John’s and tips the man’s chin up with two fingers, their eyes meeting in a moment of unguarded silence.
“I’ll phone you as soon as I know anything concrete,” he promises.
Sherlock has a talk with Mycroft.
Two hours later and they are still on the couch, giggling and snorting merrily. Not drunk, as each has only had one glass of wine, but certainly very jovial. Sherlock has a twinkle in his eye as he looks at John because a laughing John Watson is truly a sight to behold. The coach is leaning back on the couch again with his legs stretched out on the coffee table. His head is turned to face John, who still sits sideways with his arm resting on the back of the couch. They are close enough that John’s fingers touch Sherlock’s bicep and his damned stomach flips periodically with the knowledge of it. While Sherlock still finds it frustrating, he knows for an absolute fact that he would love to feel that touch again and again, every day and night. He wishes that touch meant what he wants it to mean.

“Not really. It happened every few bouts. Sometimes five in between, sometimes ten. Derby is like hockey, Dr. Watson. There are a lot of bouts.”
Sherlock blinks, now utterly confounded. He is about to ask John what the hell he is talking about when he finally notices what John is wearing. Sherlock typically sees everything one has to tell in a glimpse, but the combination of the doctor’s odd behavior and the effect John has on him in general, much as Sherlock hates to admit it, renders his powers of observation moot. Finally observing everything John has to tell, Sherlock finds himself astounded and more than a little confused.
“It hurts here?” John asks with raised brows and she nods.
“It was a dream,” he mumbles. “Just a dream.”
“Don’t I know it.”
John left him up there alone with those jackals. What have they done? Is Sherlock in the water too? They’ll never find him. Greg must have been under The Crown watching for John to go over or he wouldn’t have found him either. John had not sunk far before darkness overtook him.
“Then why, may I ask, was he at the conference? Trolling for new victims?”
Sorry, friends, that's all I can say without giving too much away.
4. Which song lyrics will be featured in the next chapter, I wonder? Any guesses? No, they are not all from Queen, but they do always pertain to the chapter in some way.
John moved away from them and turned to look across the dance floor. Sherlock was gone. John turned his body to face the mass of people fully, a pang of alarm shuddering through his body. His eyes darted around the club, but found nothing. Finally, his focus settled on the door just in time to see a long, swooshing coat topped with a head of gorgeous curls swoop out into the night air. Sherlock must have stashed the coat somewhere before introducing himself to John. John’s heart clenched painful in his chest like a piece of it had been wrenched out. Sherlock had left and John would never see him again if he did not hunt the man down right now.
“We had just beaten the Demons badly. It wasn’t for the championship or even a play-off bout, but Moriarty was pissed off,” Sherlock had said with a growing grin. “He made some disparaging remarks about Molly and I…”
“I don’t believe in coincidences.”
‘Cause I lived my life believin’ all love is blind
Hello, friends. This was a shorter chapter than usual, but worry not, some of the upcoming ones are going to be pretty long. I also think there might be more than ten after all. It all depends on how they break down. I hope all of you are still enjoying this. After all, we're finally getting to the REALLY good parts. The proposal and cool cases and hot sexytimes and who knows what's in store?
“It’s been over a long time, yeah,” John said definitively. Jim’s expression changed instantly. He pressed his thin lips together and inhaled deeply, a long centering breath. He glanced down for a moment and gave a slight nod of resignation.
“They never arrive together and one waits for the other in a different, inconspicuous place each time,” Sherlock continued. “She gives him a hotel key card each time so she doesn’t have to bring a handbag. They leave together and always in the same direction, presumably to said hotel. There is a pale ring around the third finger of her left hand where the rest of her skin is tanned. She never takes off the bracelet she wears and it has a single charm that is actually the heart-shaped pendant from a child’s necklace.”
John opens his mouth to protest, but can’t refute Sherlock’s point without contradicting himself and Sherlock’s devilish smile says he knows it. Some part of him wants to argue just because the man looks so smug. Another part is very intrigued by the mate thing and wants to find out more about what that means to Sherlock. Instead of pursuing either topic, he narrows his eyes and simply maintains his gaze as if in a standoff or staring contest.
OMG! I love this chapter, but it was so hard to write and edit. There's so much emotion - sorrow, panic, fear - and I feel all of it right along with my characters. And then when Sherlock proposes, there's this huge release!
“How could you possibly know all that?” he cocked a brow and tucked his chin, pulling away from Sherlock slightly for a better look at him. “You’re having me on. You just made that up.”
“Cyanide.”
Sherlock’s eyes snap open when a loud bang reaches his ears. He is lying on the over-sized sage green couch in the condo’s living room. Sherlock bought it knowing he would spend hours on it within his mind palace, likely falling asleep on it most nights. He frowns mightily when he hears the bang again.
I apologize to anyone who feels the underlining disrupts the reading experience, but I want to be cognizant of any readers who might be disturbed by this subject.
“What?” John splutters. The mood is entirely broken and John blinks in confusion. He watches as Sherlock shifts his weight uncomfortably, not to looking directly at him, and putting even more distance between them.
“No, I don’t think she does,” John replies with a knowing look. “You forget I’ve met with all the staffers. Paul Dimmock, Daniel and Craig, Greg - they all say it.”
Trouble at Molly's lab.
He pulled a now stunned Sherlock in so their heads were close together. Their faces only inches apart, John eyed the man with an almost childlike excitement.

2) A little off topic, bu I'm listening to Beyonce's Dance with Me right now and is it wrong that I'm putting Sherlock and John into the scenario it paints? If you don't know what I mean, watch the video. I dare you not to think of them. The question is, which one do you see dancing?
“Anesthesia by alcohol, Doctor? How primitive.”
“Fuck me,” HardOn breathes an astonished whisper. “That shoulda been me.”
“It’s amazing. And the team is phenomenal. I’ve only seen scrimmages so far, and I’m just learning the rules, but they are really good. They communicate so well with all these signals that look like they’re just shaking out a kink or something.”
That said, here it is. Chapter 13. The follow-up to John rushing out of Sherlock's hotel room after a hot night, but rude awakening. A friend asked me last night why I don't add more tags that truly reflect the nature of the story. To my credit, I did add slow burn. However, I have neglected little gems like torture, evil, rude (in some cases, fucking rude). So here's the poll: To add or Not to add? What do you all think?
Later, John has a surprise for Sherlock.... A little less conversation, a little more action.
John sits up again and takes a deep breath. With his teeth biting at his lower lip, he lowers himself down slowly and then turns onto his side carefully. It’s the most goddamn erotic thing Sherlock has seen in his life. Bending his good arm and supporting his head on one hand, John looks up at Sherlock. He gives him a pained and hesitant smile.
Sherlock’s eyes pop open wide and he doesn’t even try to hide his surprise. Most people would need a fact like that to be pointed out and not draw the conclusion from just ordinary conversation.
John is speechless for a full ten seconds. Any longer than that and Sherlock would have thought he had done something wrong. John takes another step closer to buy himself some time while he searches his mind for a reply worthy of Sherlock’s declaration. It is still so hard to believe this wondrous man would ever be interested in John the way he so clearly is.
“No, it’s not bad,” John swallows deliberately. “They’re just flesh wounds.”
John is on his way back to Detroit to hand in his resignation. No good can come of this.
“You can’t go back there,” Sherlock tells him abruptly. John’s fixes a glare on him, anger burning dangerously beneath his skin and tinting his cheeks. His mouth is a thin line. He watches Sherlock, biting the inside of his cheek. The coach diplomatically backpedals before John has a chance to speak. “Not tonight anyway. Not until the police look over your apartment and interview the neighbors.”
“He won’t succeed, John. I give you my word.”
“I know the perfect place”
And now what you've all been waiting for...
“And?”
Speaking of which, I think you'll be agreeing by the end of this one. It’s a pretty good chapter, if I do say so myself. I was breathless when I finished editing. Someone on Tumblr is already commenting on it. How can people read it so quickly?? I guess I really am a notoriously slow reader. Anyway, enjoy!
Hello, friends. Not action-packed, but necessary for the next step. The image of Sherlock shelling peas came to me one day and I HAD to write it into the story. It was too hilarious and adorable a thought to just abandon. But I didn't feel he would necessarily do it willingly. Hence, John using Sherlock's own manacles. Tee hee hee.
“Don’t go.”
“You bet your ass,” Hella replies, holding out her hand in the center of their circle. Everyone, including Sherlock, covers her hand and each of theirs in turn.
“Hm, what?” John’s deep blue eyes come into focus. He is still staring at Sherlock, but now the man is staring back with a brow cocked in confusion. “Sorry, what?”
Mycroft summons his brother.
“Dental samples,” Sherlock supplies as he sets them on the sink. “I don’t discard things that could be useful. I’ll get you a comb while I look for the sweatpants.”
Clearing his mind to focus on the here and now, Sherlock rises from the couch and walks briskly to the foyer as another pound to his front door sounds through the hall. He leans in close and peers into the spy hole to see John Watson’s head and torso. Sherlock steps back, his mind confused by the man’s presence and his stomach already doing those annoying flips.
“I’m not going to break his heart. I won’t hurt him.”
Two men place a stretcher next to the fallen skater and unbuckle its straps.
“Is this really necessary, Sergeant Budreau?” he reads the name tag beneath the man’s badge. “We are not armed and have made clear our full cooperation.”
“Are you familiar with reflexology?” he asks in a deep voice that warms the base of John’s spine.
John searches his eyes. Sherlock can tell he is trying to chase away the worry from his own dark blue gaze. It might have worked if anyone else was looking into his eyes, but not Sherlock.:
“Good night, John,” he whips the door closed and collapses against it, heaving a great sigh. Tipping his head back until it rests against the door, Sherlock’s gaze drifts up and focuses on the ceiling.
When we last left our intrepid duo, the villainous Justin Giles had kidnapped Sherlock by mistake and dumped him in a flooded out cove. Will John and company get to him in time??
* When will these two get a moment's peace so they can just solve a normal case? (Jesus, Jane, settle down!)
“Your leg. It’s also injured.”
“D’you think they are connected?” Greg asks them. They look at him and then one another. Neither looks completely certain, as if each wants to say yes, but just cannot be sure. They need more data, as Sherlock would say.
Wait and see, my friends. Wait and see. But, for now, more peaceful fluff.
Heh heh. You all knew John was on the hit list after what happened with Billy, yikes! A man dressed in black lurking in his flat, waiting to kill him? That's a few steps up from poisoning. And how about our John, eh? Even without the military background, he has mad skillz. But can he do it a second time? Can he do the same for Sherlock once he gets to his condo? Wait, wait! I'm getting ahead of myself, which can mean only one thing. Question time!
“Don’t tell them you said that,” Sherlock chuckles darkly.
Love, Jane
“That’s it,” Greg shrugs.
“Trolls. Right,” John nods. “And they’re friends of that blonde fellow, yeah?”
“Hear, hear,” The Woman declares. Every skater echoes her words and they all down a shot. Sherlock taps his empty glass on the table thoughtfully.
“Yeah, that’s Jim all right,” John laughed again. “My other half.”
Why had he left like that? People say John is brilliant and Sherlock is very much his intellectual equal, if not more so. His ability to strategize and calculate is amazing, and John still wants to learn more about his mind palace. Surely he deduced John’s inability to love as soon as he learned of Claire. John had told him. He told him he didn’t love her, couldn’t love her. Couple that with the stories of his other relationships and Sherlock would know that a relationship with John is the worst mistake he could ever make. John’s breath leaves him in a rush. He simply cannot bear the thought. He wants to
“That is what I’m suggesting, yes,” Sherlock confirmed, all seriousness and formality as though it was a business transaction. John felt a sudden tingling wave of anticipation envelope his body and he nearly shivered from the unexpected pleasure of it. He tried to keep the smile from being so wide as to give away his every thought, but knew he failed completely. To his delight, Sherlock mirrored his emotions as soon as he saw them on John’s face.
3. If/when Sherlock does find John, how is he going to stop whatever Moriarty has planned?
The words echo through John’s mind as he moves his hands to the waistband of weights. He finds the knots, impossible to release, just as his internal monologue reaches the height of foul language. John shakes his head once in frustration and desperation. The burn of his chest is threatening to become all-consuming when he must focus all of his concentration on the ropes and the weights. He is about to close his eyes in an attempt to close everything else out when a sudden shaft of light appears before him, stealing his attention away. He watches curiously as the light draws near and when he sees its source, John blows out a large puff of air, nearly all he has left, in surprise. He is staring into a round mask that covers the very worried brown eyes of a scuba-clad Greg Lestrade.
Sorry, can't say more without giving away.
What the actual fuck, Mycroft?! Am I right??
Sherlock’s criminally full lips quirked and his eyes warmed at the challenge, revealing shining flecks of green. For the next few minutes, Sherlock selected the most interesting subjects from the people around them and revealed the various secrets of their lives. Most were fairly normal with a few stranger outliers. It was all fantastic as far as John was concerned. From the boring Tesco clerk who snuck crisps and biscuits while stocking the shelves to the florist who taught her parrot to say ‘fuck you’ to troublesome costumers, John soaked in every word like a sponge.
“Mrs. Hudson’s number is on your mobile if you need anything,” he tells him.” She is more than willing to help.”
Hello, friends! I hope this chapter finds you all safe and well. I'm sorry I didn't get it out earlier in the week after the last short and suspenseful chapter. The editing gods would not cooperated with me until last night and this morning. One promise I can keep is that chapter 7 is definitely a long one to make up for the last with a lot of good interaction between  our two leading men. I don't think I've made a secret of this, but I love dialogue. I try to give enough description so you know what's going on and where they are, but I'll never write the wonderfully poetic prose other Johnlockers make into an art. Hm. Not really sure why I decided to share that bit of information. Must be feeling introspective. You caught me in more the philosophy mindset instead of my usual Deadpool. Haha.
“Are you… Sherlock, are you jealous?” He smiles when Sherlock sneers.
“My what?”
While we're talking about future chapters, you might have noticed that this Part has been shortened from ten chapters to seven. It finally happened. I usually guess at the beginning how many chapters a Part will break down to, and I usually underestimate or am spot on. Well, this time the Part isn't as long as I thought. So there is but one chapter left. Just one. I'm about to edit it a second time and when I read through the first time, it was lovely. Just lovely. I giggled, I cried, I'm giving too much away. :O
(See the end of the chapter for
But enough about that, the bout with the Ravens is finally upon us! Instead of my usual snarky teasing, I know how disappointed you are (Ha!), I wanted to define a few terms again and explain one or two things.
“Is that what you…” he stops and shakes his head ever so slightly. His brows lower into a thoughtful crease. His features become deadly serious, but soft and understanding as well. “Don’t apologize, Sherlock.”
“Yes,” John answers with a short laugh. Billy raises his brows. John presses his lips together and looks at the old man. He has an almost mischievous glint in his eye. Should John tell him what he really thinks?
I say it all the time, but I love each and every one of you and appreciate your support. Please keep reading and loving. Hearing from you means so much to me. A big shout out to my very own AGPatton for declaring the last chapter her new favorite. I got a little misty-eyed when I read that.
A certain consulting detective enters the picture.
Once again, their intrepid server appears to derail the conversation. Fortunately, more of his other tables are full now and he gives them their salads relatively quickly. They each unroll utensils from napkins and begin to eat. As Sherlock closes his mouth around a honey mustard-laden tomato, John looks at him again with the barest hint of a smile.
“No, no. Just try to relax.”
“Yes, I know,” Sherlock’s lips curled upward as his eyes studied, no read John’s face. John felt like this clever man could read his entire life with a simple glance, much less the current scrutiny. John stared like a moron as his mind caught up with the situation at hand and he closed his eyes in regret. He had just spluttered the most idiotic introduction to a man who already knew his name. God, he was so stupid.
I think I've said this before, but it is still true today. I am completely and totally blown away by the response to this story. I appreciate your support so much. It makes weeks like this one - hell, like the last two or three - bearable. You all give me reason to keep writing. i love how many lives this story has touched and I love each and every one of you for all the love you have given me.
Our next chapter takes us back to our detective and his cohorts. I plan to post it sometime over the long holiday weekend. Hope to see you all around.
"They’re certainly more interesting than this!”
“No,” Sherlock replies thoughtfully. “He’s a sociopath.”
“Think nothing of it. Jim can be a real dick when he wants to be,” John reassured him with a friendly smile. “Takes a while to warm up to him.”
“Jesus, Sherlock,” Greg’s voice is full of shocked disbelief. “Do you think Harry will be targeted again?”
“Hm, I’m more concerned about this,” he bends to look closer at a dark bruise on her ribs just under her left breast.
“I’m sure Martha took that into consideration when she hired him, Sherlock. No one wants another situation like Anderson. We can thank him for opening all our eyes, the bastard.”
keeping secrets from him. This is his team and these two idiots are part of it. He cannot manage shit if he doesn’t have all the facts.
“Yeah, a bit,” John chuckles and jokes. “Thanks for noticing.”
“I was,” the coach answers. “For too long it seems. My apologies.”
And poor Mycroft, right? I think it's safe to say that I haven't been entirely fair to him. Always distancing him from everyone else and from his own feelings, so cold and calculating. I've hinted at his emotions and we all know he cares deeply for Sherlock. Why else would he devote himself to Sherlock's protection? But here, we finally see a bit of his perspective. We finally see that he understands how important it is that John and Sherlock be together, how perfect they are for each other. Not only does their little domestic sadden him, but he must be terribly conflicted knowing that he will be complicit in John's eventual capture.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I make sure he leaves this place once in a while and he makes sure I sleep on occasion,” Sherlock smirked, holding a pretzel between his index and middle fingers.
Jammer - the skater who skates around the track and aims to pass all of the blockers on the opposite team. A point is scored for each opposing team blocker the jammer passes.
Sherlock’s lips quirk up at the corners. He looks down again at the candle flickering on the table between them.
What does this mean? Where is Sherlock?
“How bad?” Sherlock can’t keep his voice from trembling, his genuine fear for Smacks threatening to surface.
“Holy shit,” Greg says bluntly. He closes his eyes for a moment, trying to wrap his head around it all.
“Oh, how could you possibly know that?” John laughs.
“There you are,” John beams. “They were about to send out a search party and believe me when I say they would’ve carried you out here kicking and screaming. It was all I could do to hold them back.”
“Okay. I’ll tell you. You’re the one who told me about it in the first place,” John’s hands twitch again and he grumbles in frustration. He wants to lean forward, to whisper to Sherlock conspiratorially, but cannot. The detective leans close for him and cocks his ear a bit. At first, John’s eyes pop open wider and the corners of his mouth turn up, just a little. Then his eyes are full of endearment and trust. It is a face, a feeling Sherlock thought he might never see or feel again for the whole of his life.
Sherlock. At least that is what Sherlock wants to believe.
Sorry, friends, no spoilers.
I thought our duo needed a little more down time before being pulled into something dangerous again. Plus, Mycroft needed this chance to make sure John is still the John we all know and love.
A little bliss at 221B, along with a little row.
Until next time, my friends.
Sherlock turns to mirror his position. Draping his left arm across the top of the back, his fingers are close enough for him to touch John’s elbow with his fingertips. A soft brush of affection, of love. Sherlock wiggles his fingers slowly, but does not get close enough to actually touch John. Oh, how he longs to.
John stands behind him and stares in disbelief. What would Mycroft have to say to affect Sherlock so dramatically? The man does the opposite of everything his elder brother tells him just for spite. What could possibly send him full circle from kissing John to turning his back? John sets his jaw and wrinkles his brow, determined to find out and he knows just the person to ask.
John blinked when he felt Sherlock’s hands rest heavily on his shoulders. The man was still swaying in perfect time with John, who must have been on auto-pilot, but wore a look of mild concern on his face. Sherlock tilted his head as if to ask “You okay?”. John grinned sheepishly and nodded as the music swelled one last time. Both men, as well as everyone on the floor, threw their hands up and sang.
“Does this hurt?” he presses gently.
“Okay,” John’s tongue darts across his lips and it is all Sherlock can do not to look at them, not to even glance. “What suspicions?”
Rosie started primary school this year. She spent the whole ride back to Baker Street telling Sherlock all about her first day and ran up to her room the moment they were home to do it all over again for her photos of John that cover her chest of drawers. Sherlock cried that night after she was asleep. When the weekend came, Rosie and Sherlock made the trek to John’s bedside and she told him yet again. She included other details of the week and showed him all of her drawings and projects. Sherlock nearly cried again, feeling an overwhelming guilt at his decision to bring her for visits on only weekends now that her days were full of school. Fortunately, Rosie did not make a fuss when he told her. She has always been a very reasonable and thoughtful child, nothing like Sherlock when he was a boy. He decided long ago it must be a reflection of John’s personality.
Unfortunately, John does not have time to savor Sherlock’s voice or his words. A few sentences in and he notices their guide slowly moving in on Sherlock. Irritation wells up within him and John immediately has the impulse to touch Sherlock. Stake some sort of claim with a touch that is just intimate enough to say ‘Back off. He’s mine.’. Something that will definitely tell her to get the fuck away from Sherlock.
“You’re right. Of course, you’re right,” he nods with a small smile. “Thank you.”
“At Christmas, when I was eight, our parents gave us skates. We couldn’t wait until spring,” he smiles at the memory. “We’d put them on sometimes just to feel the weight of them on our feet and that pull at our legs. We would stand in our bedrooms and balance on one foot, then the other. We’d walk around the room on our toe stops,” he looks at John and leans forward over his salad as though telling a secret. “We had to do it quietly so our parents wouldn’t find out we had them on inside the house. It really was a great way to master footwork without even realizing.”
“Something’s on your mind, John.” Sherlock begins, beating him to the punch. “You were walking home with great purpose. What is it?” He flashes sharp eyes at the doctor and asks warily. “It’s not about the bathtub, is it?”
Sherlock feels numb. He watches John reach for the doorknob and then something in his mind explodes. His hand juts out abruptly and he touches John’s arm.
This much is true.
“You’re alone.”
His gaze slides along John’s torso and stops on the exposed skin. He can just see a smattering of light curls that disappear into the boxer shorts. He blinks and shifts his eyes to the wound quickly, hoping John did not notice.
“No.”
“As my mate…”
Hold onto your butts.
Mycroft fans: Will he resume trying to undermine John and Sherlock's relationship?
“That’s good. The record stands,” John replies. “Janine was fretting on the way here.”
“What we talked about before,” he clarifies. “To date. If you are amenable, that is.”
“No,” Sherlock answers, looking sideways at John. “Greg wanted to talk and we were both booked up all day. I hitched a ride in so we could talk on the way.”
“Riley,” the sergeant addresses him in a short, clipped tone.
Doesn't matter anyway
Sherlock grabs the remote and jabs at the pause button. He turns a thoroughly annoyed glare at his little doctor and speaks crisply.
Greg teases and grins at Sherlock’s irritation, even as he pretends to ignore him. He watches the man he has worked with so long and has come to call a friend, trying not to chuckle at his grumblings. And then, quickly dropping all pretense and fixing Sherlock with a serious gaze, he goes for the jugular.
“As long as you’re not having a quickie, I’d say I agree,” Greg laughs. Sherlock closes his eyes in resignation and, as if he can see him, Greg’s chortling ceases. “Oh, shit. You’re not on speaker?”
Sherlock’s face quickly morphs into one of indignation.
Thank you all again for the love and support, especially at times like these when it's longer between postings. I love you all. Jane
Okay, I slipped into a little of my Deadpool side there at the end. I know you won't mind. You all know me, which doesn't necessarily bode well for John and Sherlock. Yikes! They have truly gotten themselves stuck in a mess like a june bug in molasses, and that's thick molasses too.
I'd like to thank my always stylish and wonderful beta, MyBreadAndButter, who keeps me on my toes and sometimes adds to my stress. She's like Barbara Streisand... like buttah! Bwahahahaha! Okay, that's my worst joke so far. Sorry, sorry, I can't help myself. How does Deadpool feel about Barbara? I mean, we all know he loves Wham! *sigh* I think I'm going to crank up some streaming Wham! and give it a listen. So many "good" songs, and George Michael is haunting me. Don't ask.
Until then, keep your pants dry, your dreams wet and keep you stick on the ice. We're all in this together.
“You’re on speaker now, Greg. You said you want to review the plan,” Sherlock prompts, impatience clear in his voice.
“You said you met Angelo when you came back to Detroit,” John begins, “so you lived here before.”
“Uh-huh, and why is that?” John raises his brows expectantly.
“Does Greg know at least?”
“Sherlock!” she tuts, but she is smiling
“Jesus,” John runs a hand through his hair and lets out a long breath, “someone else should know. Greg or Mrs. Hudson. Someone should be watching out for more accidents. Molly can’t do it while she’s on the track.”
Thanks again for all of your love and support. I'm always open to comments and suggests. They are my bread and butter.
Our sleuth and his blogger go home.
There is a moment of silence while he considers the coach’s demeanor curiously.
Sherlock’s eyes widened and he blew out a quiet breath that drifted over John’s lips. He was so close. His face was almost touching Sherlock’s. His lips were
I also want to send a shout out to a certain Britcom from which I borrowed the conversation at the beginning of the chapter. Couldn't resist, couldn't resist. You know John is going to introduce Sherlock to that one at some point. How could he not?
As my precious Pat said long ago, I am a master of evil. Truly the Empress of Evil. I still need that on a t-shirt, btw.
“It really isn’t,” John scowled, directing his glare to his boyfriend. No, not boyfriend. That was not what he wanted.
Had his tone been hopeful, curious, dismayed? John can hear the words exactly, but cannot put an emotion to them. He tries not to talk himself into anything, recalling Sherlock’s assertion that he does not have all the data, but really only succeeds in talking himself out of things. He sighs as he watches warm-ups. It is going to be a long night.
So what’s in store for them now? We shall see...    ALSO, mind the rating and tag changes.
Sherlock glances at John and then averts his gaze to the ceiling, disgusted with himself for behaving so irrationally. He sneers and waves it off dismissively.
They lie down in one another’s arms. Sherlock, lost in thought, and John, determined to find out what’s wrong. He knows Sherlock is lying. Sherlock is troubled and it’s about Moriarty. Something he doesn’t want John to know. A threat, most likely, but it isn’t his own safety that Sherlock’s worried about and John is pretty sure he knows who it really is.
4. Is Sherlock on the hitlist and, if so, when will the attacker come for him?
The words are out of Sherlock’s mouth before he can stop them. He closes his eyes slowly, scolding himself. He has no idea how to explain that one away and just hopes John does not interpret it the way it sounded. Against his better judgement, Sherlock chances a look at the doctor. Instead of anger or utter confusion, John wears a brilliant smile without a hint of guile.
He is about to walk up the small wooden staircase at its entrance when he becomes aware of a presence to his right. He turns quickly and comes face to face with a hesitant Sherlock Holmes, shifting his feet and looking at John with a face full of uncertainty.
“More to Greg’s point,” Sherlock finally speaks again, “what guarantee do we have that this Watson won’t show the same disregard for ethics that Anderson did?”
“We always use the same company,” Sherlock answers, “and we always request Lawrence. He chauffeured us around my first time here and every one since.”
“No. Absolutely not. I’ve already told you too much.”
John looks at Sherlock and is damned if the coach doesn’t look like he knows every thought in John’s head. Sherlock could probably see it all plain as day as it flickered over his features. John huffs to himself in fond exasperation before making a small bow, befitting of Poe himself.
“John and I spent the rest of the conference together,” Mrs. Hudson is saying when Sherlock tables his thoughts and returns to the conversation. “It was one of the best conferences I’ve attended, I must say. He is very genuine and honest, and very friendly. I think you will both like him once you meet him.”

Jim glanced at Moran as he nodded in agreement. John stared straight ahead, not even seeing them anymore. His own words ringing in his ears. ‘Already moved on’. John had to keep a certain consulting detective from moving on and that meant he needed to get the fuck out of here now.
“You’re serious,” he says in disbelief. “You know everything in a glance and you can’t see that he’s into you?”
And now, on a personal note...I want to thank my new, and official, beta MyBreadAndButter for all of her hard work and advice. She has helped make this chapter and the last the best they can be. She stresses my out, but also makes me think about my characters in all new ways and I love it. She is truly my bread and butter. What? You didn't think I'd make a lame joke about that? Do you know me at all? 😂 Yep. Had to throw that in too. You know, I protest the fact that there is no Deadpool emoji. I want a Deadpool emoji. Am I right?
“That’s…” John began as every part of his face brightened with delight, “unbelievable.”
Anyway, Jim is dead. I think we can all breathe a sigh of relief. Of course...Moran is still out there.
“Sherlock, my boy, why have you been away so long?” he laughs. “I thought this was the off-season, yeah?”
Take my hand
(See the end of the chapter for
Will he test positive?
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?” he asks, confusion clear on his face.
John collapses to his knees immediately and Sherlock drops to his own in front of John. Leaning forward, he cups John’s face in his hands and presses their lips together in a kiss that reawakens John’s spirit. He slides his fatigued arms around Sherlock’s waist and holds on. When Sherlock breaks the kiss, he continues peppering John’s mouth with small kisses as words fall from his lips like rain.
“Can Teddy and Buzzy come too?”
* Yeah, but Jane, still...What's the deal with the apples? They're super creepy and they must mean something.
The air around them crackles with electricity and oh, Jesus, he wants to kiss John. It would be so easy. Just lean down, angle his neck, close the gap. Sherlock knows full well John’s lips would be soft, perfect. John is perfect. He does not bore Sherlock, has never bored him, could never bore him. John is funny and intriguing, honest and mysterious. Sherlock loves it all. He could easily spend a night or week or month or forever with John and never know exactly what would happen like he does in anyone else’s company. People are idiots. John is brilliant.
Sherlock looks at him with admiration as John’s hand slowly strokes up and down Sherlock’s back beneath the covers, his fingertips grazing that supple ass when his hand is low.
“I’m looking out for you, you fucking prick,” John calls to his back angrily. “You won’t.”
“John?”
Love, Jane
“The timing checks out,” John continues. “It happened on the track.”
It is Christmas eve. John and Sherlock have just finished opening presents from one another, deciding it best since they have invited friends for a party the following afternoon. The evening is comfortable and warm. The flat, lit by only the fire and twinkle lights is cozy, almost misty. John sits in his chair across from Sherlock, looking at the open book Sherlock has just given him. It is a mystery novel and one that John has wanted to read for some time, but had gone out of print. The man has connections and really does know him too well. He glances up at the curly head across the rug, face hidden behind a chemistry book Sherlock has had his eye on for over a month. Is this the moment? The moment he tells Sherlock he would love nothing more than to spend his life with him doing more than catching criminals and sharing laughs?
And then John realizes he has been staring at Sherlock for way too long. He blinks and looks away, puffs out a nervous breath.
Hello, everyone! I know it's been a while AGAIN, but I've had a hard time editing this one. At long last, it is finished and I am excited to see what you all think of it. On a side note, it's been a shit week and posting this chapter makes me feel better - like I've managed to accomplish something. I hope you all enjoy it.
Since KC is only one point off the patriots right now and I'm in a playful mood, I'm going to go DP style. Let's see how it works...
“But now?” Sherlock prompts him. He shouldn’t, but cannot help himself. John is the most interesting man he has ever met.
“I beg your pardon,” the coach is somewhere between fury and incredulity.
“There’s nothing I’d love more, but it’s already so late and getting the ladies through an airport is like herding cats,” John laughs when Sherlock cracks a smile. “That’s what you Americans call it, yeah?”
To that end, I am not opposed to the idea and I am still editing, but the story is what it is. I wrote it the way I wanted and with what felt right at the time. If I think something is missing as I edit, I will change it, but I make no promises. I appreciate everyone's comments and suggestions, I truly do. Just promise me that whatever direction I take, you will not question the depth of John's love for Sherlock. He most assuredly loves him with all his heart and soul. If you want to think of it in terms of the show (i.e. The Fall), John would absolutely die for Sherlock if it meant protecting him from harm. Need proof? Go back to chapters 1 and 2. He already died for him once. Oops. Did I say once? ONLY once?
“My dad was diagnosed with cancer my last year of medical school and died just after I graduated. With mum it was an auto accident,” he looks at Sherlock and smiles again. “That, and boredom eventually drove me to America and hockey. Anything else you want to know? Or do you know it all now between Mrs. Hudson and your deductions, which I still find amazing, by the way. You have to tell me how you do it.”
"I thought it was an accident, that someone made a mistake. They didn't. They got it perfectly." John squatted, laid his fist over the inlay.
Yes, well, the clear solution is that there's an ice cream mafia and they're running a racket.
That cloud gaze scudded fast over faces, deducing, judging—
So there's that seed planted long ago too, the swearing, though there's more things beside.
Knuckles white as salt, foot lead-heavy on the brake, John Hamish Watson did not release the mother-fucking wheel.
And a bright, strange little boy who's learned so many lessons about being different and alone, well some time in his seventh year he'll learn he can protect something even littler than he. So when a blonde boy keeps hitting ducks with flowers, Sherlock finds he has the nervous courage to
"Hey, you're in the way."
It wasn't after that session, nor the one following that Sherlock lingered, but the time after
…and John said yes, sure, and then oh really, and they went and they ate, and they talked. Oh how they talked.
Countless times John's seen this silent cry for comfort: Hospitalised children clutching unfamiliar nurses, old men and women in care homes reaching out to any passerby. People die from this sort of starvation, John knows that, it kills as sure as accident or disease.
Oh, and the big man standing motionless in the middle of the room? Gaze judgmental and posture imperious? Not one hot

"Ex-military, single, doctor but not practicing, you're broke and—"
"It's an LGBT group."
"Actually," Sherlock said, his voice a full octave lower than the one he was using three minutes previous, "I was wondering—"

you and why should they? John's learnt that people expect short guys to be belligerent, that they're sure all surgeons are arseholes, and as of today he's learnt that four beers and a shot are apparently more than enough to make him drunk enough to not really notice when some idiots tie two chairs together, then tie him and another guy to them thinking they're
So John Watson went to the source.
The giggles aren't always an aphrodisiac but sometimes they are.
got Sherlock horny.
Sure enough it wasn't even five minutes before he saw a wood ladder nailed to the side of a single-storey nail salon, and with just a glance at mummy Sherlock ran to it, and clambered up, up, up.
The man Sherlock turns to face is short, serious-looking, and gesturing to the bartender. "Wallace…uh, he told me you're the one who, who was…" The man frowns. "These were…you never answered…" He hands Sherlock a small stack of cocktail napkins.
The genius who notices the furled-up edge on a plaster, the stopped watch on a wrist, the stain on the knot of a tightly-tied tie, does not for the next five minutes notice when they stop so a child can pet Mike; doesn't feel it when a low-lying branch brushes across his forehead; doesn't see the Queen's Guard contingent of twelve plumed soldiers ride by on their own fine mounts.
Rapt. Fascinated. And something wonderful: Before Sherlock had intruded with grim reality, John Watson had been randy as hell.
From a Runaway Horse
The beauty of the gig is that it's well-paid, a few times a month, and John's pretty sure he's getting pretty good at reading people. It should come in handy when he starts dating again.
"You do it."
"Shut up John."), shook it with the sober solemnity of a diplomat about to negotiate a disarmament treaty. "I'm Sherlock Holmes."
"I don't know what to do with that information."
Sherlock talks to himself often. He answers, too. What you'll hear him say depends on when you eavesdrop.
This is lovely when he brings me honeyed tea if I sneeze (I never tell him it's from giving my herbal soother a good little sniff before lighting up) it's less good when he's in a hurry to meet Himself, and doesn't hear a single word I say.

"Shut up Mycroft."
"What!" Lestrade closed his eyes in contrition. He micronapped for three seconds. He woke in time to hear PC Ahuja murmuring soothing sounds to the new constable. She must have taken the phone.
"What are you doing?"
Sherlock means never to return to the pub.
This one was cranky, sober, and entirely too tall. "No, because I'm
The short man is right behind him now. Sherlock fumbles more apples. The woman wonders if her phone is getting all the audio.

And for all the years after that, they lived happily ever after.
And there, among a thousand disguises, John Watson and Sherlock Holmes began falling in love. They'd spend the rest of their forever there, decrepitude be damned.
Tongue suddenly busy lick-licking his lips, John crossed his legs, placed the bear across them, and John Watson proceeded to perform safety pin surgery.

John closed his mouth because all the breathing he was doing was making him light-headed.
"What?" John blinks, looks up at a man suddenly looming. "I'm sorry, I didn't hear—"
Sherlock pulls the duvet to their chins, then wriggles a long arm out as his husband settles. He brushes his palm over John's fresh crew-cut.
For a moment it seemed that Sherlock was opening his mouth wider in preparation to say something but no, he was just opening his mouth wider so he could pant a little easier.
"No, no...n—there!
"I was in the—"
He frowned, pretty sure that that was only supposed to happen after kissing things and other things. Then he remembered he was drunk and therefore probably listing to the left again and so he took hold of the wall very casually with both hands.
St. Thomas' hospital is also closer to 221B than St. Bart's, but only just a bit. Though again the journey to this hospital is more interesting, what with the need to go through downtown London and cross the River Thames.
Sherlock's brows lofted high. He stepped close. "Oh really?"
"Give him some of his own back."
Greg, heart thrumming, a little bit giggles as Mycroft Holmes takes his hand.

When they arrived at seven sharp, John asked the good doctor to stay for a cuppa, but Michael Stamford's no fool. He doesn't need a stethoscope to know when two hearts are beating fast.

Yes? Good. Now what I say is…would you like to have coffee?"
The reply is immediate.

John Watson doesn't wait, simply reaches for Sherlock's hand, murmurs, "Hold tight," pulls and swings behind his guest.
John's intention had been to finally get his driving licence because apparently, his sister said, that's what grown-ups do. But when he met his driving instructor in a mostly-empty parking lot, well John hated the man on sight.

(And where Atlin is about to finish her BA!) University College London (UCL) is also right there, as is the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS).
John floats himself up to an empty table, where none of the glassware from a party of eight has been cleared away.
Hearing these few highly unusual words in a sinful baritone so surprised the good doctor that he reflexively turned to gape at the man who'd purred them. His movement was so sudden his coffee cup swirled round and round on its saucer in a sort of ballet. John watched it do this in the slow-motion way of one who has enough time to realise something bad is going to happen but does not have time to stop the badness.
"And I don't like your breath, but I'm nice to you just the same."
So row
John steps close, his hand settling over one with long fingers. And gently, gently they tell one another…
Sherlock's never understood the rare commenters who wander briefly onto his blog praising him, calling themselves 'fans.' He always ignores them, certain that hidden in their words are jokes in which he is the punchline.
It took Sherlock a good three seconds to realise any of this. When he did, he sat up and demurely placed a hand over the pretty tent in his trousers. He listed left, took hold of the table edge so as to stop listing left. "Why did you do that?"
Sneering at the shoe as if it were someone else's opinion, Sherlock said, "Then no, if I were that woman I would not wear these. Wrong colour, the heel's too low, and they're positively

and a house-warming gift.
John Watson stopped facing forward, looked at Mr. Chatterbox. "Why are you—"
Wordlessly they sat side-by-side in the now-empty car, ready to make the tedious journey back toward their missed stations and they didn't know it yet, they wouldn't know it for weeks, but from this day forward neither would move far from the other. No, neither would ever go very far away.
Always at a loss over
Standing in the tobacconist's glass-walled humidor, Sherlock opens his mouth wider, takes a ragged breath, then does it again, again, againagainagain
I am sure mileage on all of this information varies, I'm just sharing what I've experienced in my three years living here. If you have questions, do let me know, but you can also make up the most special tea or jam or honey you like! There are more than these four supermarkets, they just happen to be the chains most often seen in London. I'm certain you could find all kinds of lovely, rare things in other shops so feel free to invent!
Patient in view, John turned his attentions. "Hello Mr. Holmes, I'm Dr. John Watson. How're you feeling?"
He's an active man, is Sherlock, but here he reacts, answers and only rarely asks.
"No you didn't."
Prets are everywhere in London. No seriously, they are all over the place everywhere and so often within sight of one another you will stand on a corner and gape. In Trafalgar Square you can stand in a certain spot and see three of them. This one is about 30 seconds from 221B, on west side of Baker Street, like their flat. Like all Prets it serves hot soups, coffees of every kinds, great sandwiches, various hot wraps, and croissants. Also, like all Prets, their staff are always happy. I don't know if someone put something in the drinks or the corporation has superb management (I'm going with this latter guess), but the staff are invariably kind and sometimes they give you a free latte or cappuccino or tea because you made them smile.
