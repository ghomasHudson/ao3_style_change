Dean’s eyes shot open and he tried to lift his head, to apologize.  Something.  But Castiel’s hand was there quickly, holding him down gently, but firmly.
“Huh.”  Dean licked his lips.  “I have to say, this totally doesn’t sound like the guy I met.  He . . . shit.  Never would have figured him for a prankster.”  Not that it was a bad thing to be one but . . . he liked Gabriel as this shy, reserved person.  He’d found him irresistible last night; doubly so when he experienced how irritating James was.  He had to give Gabriel credit for dealing with such a flirty, objectionable person.
"Fuck that shit," Dean snapped.  He flushed again when Castiel’s eyes swung to him in surprise.  "Fuck, Cas; you think the only reason I wanted you around was your damn halo?"
Dean squirmed, trying to back away, grunting when he only bumped into the car behind him.  “Cas, don’t push me,” he warned.  Fear.  It surged through the air, thick and sour.  Had Dean been a fairy like Castiel, his wings would be sickly green and limp.
Which he did.  Often.  Every morning, Castiel would cross his storefront and catch the scent of Dean’s aftershave.  The smell of the Impala that had permeated his leather jacket.  It was only worse at his home.  New wards had appeared almost overnight, carefully hidden but designed to keep anyone but him from crossing the threshold.  He had to wonder if Dean even slept.  Part of him was annoyed at the man’s insufferable attitude.  He threw Castiel away but insisted on haunting his every step?  Had he the temperament, he’d have cornered the man and told him off completely.
an idiot.”  He slammed his head into the headrest, whining at the sudden pain.  “Why’d you do that to me?” he moaned.
He looked good.  Then again, he always looked good.  Seeing him, though, didn’t make Dean weak like he’d feared.  Instead, his nerves ratcheted up and he scowled at Castiel, noting how the man went stiff in reaction.  “Well?  Sit,” he snapped.
Quiet once more, Castiel held out a piece of the cake between his fingers, lifting an eyebrow.  “Would you like some?”
Dean took two steps forward, putting him quite close to Castiel.  “Was what?” he asked.  Could it be that
he decided as he scooped her up wandering into the living room to join Castiel on the couch.  Bad decisions for sure but . . . why did it feel like home the more he made them?
He tried to focus on the flashing images above him.  Tried not to look at Castiel.  His nerves were tight as a violin’s strings.  So much so that he jumped when Castiel chuckled.
They crept through the rest of the tunnel, barely risking breathing as they neared its end.  At an iron grate, Benny held up a hand and toyed with the door.  He crouched down, pulling out a set of lockpicks and the old gate sprung open with a flick.  As old as it was, it protested the slow push and Castiel winced with each creak.
Balthazar sighed and leaned back, head resting on the back of his chair.  “And to think, we Brits consider ourselves dramatic.”  He sat up again, waving a hand.  “Sit your arse down, you fool.  Tell me what you know.”
Dean didn’t answer right away.  Maybe he was right.  Maybe Dean needed to leave if something of this magnitude could be hidden.  From what Castiel hinted at, it sounded like the elder Novak didn’t live nearby and wouldn’t necessarily be a continued presence.  Still, if Dean had to hide in a year or so simply because the man popped in for a visit, it wouldn’t sit well with him.  Nor should it.
“All right.”  He stopped, squinting at Castiel.  The other man returned the incredulous look with a warm grin.  "Uh, Sierra?“ Dean prodded.
If only he would.  Dean’s cock ached and he spread his legs as much as he could on the narrow couch, hoping to get the point across.  He wanted it.  Wanted it so fucking bad at this point.  He wondered how Castiel moved.  Was it hard and violent?  Or would he slide into Dean with slow, measured thrusts?  Send Dean into spasms of pleasure with rolling hips.  Would he tug on Dean’s dick or would he let him beg in agony as pleasure swirled with pain?
His weight heavy against Castiel, Dean pushed up a bit, leaning on his elbows.  He grinned, hand cupping Castiel’s right shoulder, fingers running gently along sensitive skin.  “You do that a lot.  The singing, I mean.”
“Sure, sure.  Go . . . raid.”  After Kevin clicked off, Dean stared at his phone.  So.  Gabe was short?  He eyed the scrap of paper by his register that
“Well, yes.”  He took the check with a nod and stuffed a few bills inside, before handing it off to the waiter.  He began shoveling his half-eaten dinner into one of the to-go boxes, gesturing for Dean to do the same.  “If this will make you comfortable, Dean, I see no reason not to.”
Benny grinned.  “Trade secrets, brother.”  He winked and stepped back, sweeping his arm out.  “Boys?”
Castiel stared in confusion at the restaurant’s menu across from him.  Nose wrinkling he asked, “Pardon?”
Who could say at this point?  Certainly not Castiel.  Not when he maintained the annoying radio silence.
Dean hadn’t left his cabin yet.  Why he seemed to have decided to stay.  The fairies wouldn’t have let him.  Nor would the other denizens of the forest.  The curiosity burning in him wouldn’t stay quiet.
there was someone who caught your eye.”  She turned back to the camera with a flip of dark hair.  “I’m sure the viewers at home would love to see you settle down, Dean.”
it rejection but neither did he fully understand Castiel’s motivation.  Not exactly arrogant of him to know that Castiel wanted him.  The man had said as much.  But at this point, he had a hard time believing it.
He hung up the phone, tucking it into his pants pocket and turned to the oven.  Pulling it open, his mouth watered at the melted cheese and fresh scents of basil and red meat sauce.  “Dean,” he called quietly.  “You’re welcome to join me in the kitchen.”  He turned, stiffening when he saw Dean leaning in the entryway.  Smiling nervously, he set the pan of lasagna on a trivet and murmured, “I’ll let it set for few more minutes.  Though, I admit I get impatient with lasagna.”
Wrapped up in a thick blanket, the bags under his eyes dark as pitch, Castiel sniffled and then coughed, body shaking at the force of it.  ”This cannot be illness,” he rasped.  ”This must be the onset of death.”
you disappoint me.”  His tone softened, dropping nearly to a whisper.  “Not when you’re exactly what I want.”
Dean refused to consider anything for a week.  Childish, maybe, but it wasn’t as though anyone could blame him.  Though, he hated doing it.  He missed even
sign had been taken down a week or so ago.  He smiled.  “Oh!  That’s a pleasant surprise.  Most folks here have been having to drive to Salem for repairs.  It’s good to know we’ll have a mechanic again.”
good about my life.  I feared he’d destroy it like he did so much of my childhood.”  He took a breath, facing Dean.  “I hurt you, I know that.”  He dropped his gaze and added in a pained whisper, “I
Impressed, Castiel held the gun down at his hip.  He raised his eyebrows, looking at Benny silently.  The other man grinned and shrugged, pointing to the door they’d been guarding.  He nodded, wishing he hadn’t.  The room tilted and he wobbled, the floor rushing up on him.  He didn’t quite make it there since Benny’s arm had wrapped around his chest, halting his fall.
“Y-yeah,” Dean managed, eyes glazed.  “P-promise.”  He grinned suddenly.  “Unless you got some cool shit in your house.”
His stubbornness waned and his hands loosened.  If Dean wouldn’t hear him, what point was there in arguing?  He bit his lip, muffling the mournful trill.  Another breath, shakier than before.  “If I push, it won’t matter; will it?”
remotely pressuring.  He talked, he smiled, he laughed but he didn’t touch Dean.  Well, not much more than a fleeting caress of fingers or a warm kiss to the cheek.  Twice, he’d stroked Dean’s hair and to Dean’s absolute horror, he’d whimpered and leaned into it.
Castiel glanced at him and then away, then back again.  He blushed to find Balthazar … leering at him.  He swallowed and shrugged.  ”Tension is a part of the job, isn’t it?  I’m sure you face such things.”
An idea began to bubble in Dean’s head.  He’d probably have to close the shop for the day.  But, if it fixed things with Castiel, who cared?  Chewing on his bottom lip, Dean made a decision.  “Can you give me this Bal’s phone?  I think I know what I can do.”
the matter closed when I regained what was mine.”  He chuckled.  “You’re rather dim, even for an American.”
“Do not apologize for their . . . abuse,” Castiel remarked.  His hand was cool and soft on Dean’s chin as he coaxed Dean to look his way.  He offered up that same sad smile he’d been seeing over the last two weeks.  “Do you understand how badly I want you?  To see you naked?  To touch you?”
Dean winced.  “Yeah, I know.  Old habit, I guess.  I take Baby everywhere.”  He snorted faintly, running a hand through his hair, glancing once at Castiel as he did.  “Would –
Castiel blinked.  “I . . . I don’t know.  I’ve not thought on it, actually.”  He shrugged.  “I’m not beholden to him in any way.  My schooling had been taking care of with a trust from my mother’s father.  Everything I own I’ve earned through my own skill.”  Another shrug, weaker this time.  “I don’t know,” he repeated.  “It doesn’t lessen that fear, however.”
“Yeah, but . . .” he leaned in, kissing the bandage carefully.  “I’m sorry, okay?  I never wanted that to happen.”  He looked up, eyes wide.  “I mean that.”  Still kneeling, he swept his arms around Castiel’s midriff, pulling him in, nuzzling his stomach above his half-removed jeans.  “I didn’t want you involved,” he whispered.
Castiel untangled their fingers, still shaking.  He didn’t miss the look of confusion on Dean’s face as he did.  He swallowed uneasily.  “Dean . . . I need to . . . think.”  For once, he needed to have a clear head.  Things had moved so fast he wasn’t sure which way was up at this point.
“Fine,” he muttered, already formulating his plan.  It was likely the owner was just some money-grubber who’d fibbed to Gabriel in an effort to draw in business.  Alt-bookstores did serve a rather limited clientele.
”  Castiel had never seen anyone so anchored to their past like Dean in that moment.  He wasn’t even certain he could break Dean of that, though he would try.  “You came here for a reason.  You said you wanted to . . . leave it all behind.  This brother of yours, you wanted to walk away from him.  You told me you were
guy who’ll blow his mind.”  He shrugged, biting his lip again, making certain that Castiel’s eyes were on him.  “Or, you know, get him to blow his
Pam’s lips quirked into another smirk.  “That’s right.  You recently came out as bisexual, didn’t you, Dean?”
to make this up to you.”  He looked downward again.  “My words are not enough to sway you, I know that.  Simply tell me what I must do and I’ll do it.”
Remembering the savage crack of the man’s neck, he tried not to take satisfaction in that.  “Uh, yes.”
Until one had led him to Oregon and Grovelock.  He’d put down a new shtriga outside Salem and had passed through Grovelock, noting the quiet streets and pleasant atmosphere.  And while he’d only meant to stop off for gas before moving on, there was no mistaking the signs of the supernatural.  He’d been around Benny enough to know a vampire the second he saw one.  The woman at the gas station was undeniably a blood-sucker.  But, to his trained eye, she appeared more startled by Dean than aggressive.  Frightened, given how quickly she’d handed over change.
Inside he stared, blinking.  Why were his lights on?  And the window … open?  As the bathroom door creaked open, he dropped to one knee and pulled out his gun, snarling, “Another step and I can’t guarantee I won’t kill you.”
Shy.  Smiling so shyly.  Dean met his eyes easily but he looked nearly as flush as Castiel felt.  “I meant it, Cas.  I’m not . . . I’ve spent so much cash at your truck just to talk to you.”  He looked away for a second and cleared his throat.  “I guess, I’m still a stranger though.  So, you know . . . no pressure.”
He didn’t know why, but Dean had always been drawn to the quieter ones.  Finding out what made them tick.  What they liked, what they didn’t.  Somehow, those guys were always
“What?”  Castiel moved his fingers along the marks on Dean’s wrist, touch gentle and warm.  “Why on Earth would you apologize to me?”  His fingertips were light and smooth, stroking the abraded skin slowly.  “Is this why you triggered with those cuffs?”
Dean chuckled, though it sounded weak and broken.  He moved back across the room and kissed Castiel’s forehead, hand warm and rough against Castiel’s neck.  “I know that, Cas.  Believe me.”  He sighed, dropping his hand.  “Just . . . get some sleep.  I’ll see you later.”  He said nothing else as he paced away, collecting his clothing as he went.
broken after all?  His unease seemed to bleed out and he slumped in his chair, rubbing his face.  “Yeah, I get it.  I just . . . kind of . . . I thought maybe you’d be a Dom for me,” he blurted.
it.  That feeling of possession.  Of being bound.  Hadn’t felt it in a long time, though.  Not after it had become a punishment.  A way to remind him his place.  His gaze landed on a set of red-and-black cuffs and Castiel chuckled.
Unable to speak, he shifted his hips, hoping to get the message across.  Given the tightening of Dean’s hands and the sudden absence of cock, he wondered if Dean had misunderstood.  But then Dean plunged in again, jolting his body forward.  Before he could recover, Dean drew out again and pumped into him, pleasure bursting out in shivering sparks.
I did a skip on last week but should probably be able to avoid that until this is finished.  However long that might take.  :D  But we'll see.
“Kinda dramatic, Cas,” Dean taunted uneasily.  He’d so easily thought Castiel’s affection would have withered after his demand.  If anything, it seemed to have increased.  As did Dean’s own desire to feel it.  And with it, the fear that it might end someday.  Someday soon, given Dean’s track record.
“Careful,” he cautioned as he took a seat.  “I don’t need to clean up fairy puke.”  He frowned.  “Can you guys puke?”
He nodded again.  “I’m aware,” he said finally, feeling Dean’s green eyes bore into the side of his head.  “I know what I’m asking, Balthazar.  I’ve no right to it, but still … I’m asking for help.”
Though far from sober, Dean swallowed, guilt flooding his green eyes.  “Cas . . . I . . . I couldn’t . . .”
Castiel eyed his upturned umbrella like the traitor it was.  “I’m terribly sorry, sir,” he mumbled.  “I wasn’t paying attention and now . . . I’ve probably damaged your virility.”
He glanced back, finding Dean watching him, no hint of humor on his face.  While his lust ebbed somewhat, he sighed.  “I . . . the color, the light?  It’s a . . . signal.  Meant as a . . . mating call,” he added in a mumble.  “The . . . er, um . . . the . . .” he waved a hand weakly, his face completely aflame with the embarrassment of it all.  “Well, you understand.”
“I don’t know what I want,” Dean admitted, turned around, his appetite completely destroyed.  He felt nervous in this quiet place.  The light clink of silverware against plates.  The hushed conversation.  He felt like crawling out of his skin he was so out of place.
Castiel woke up with a groan and two Bennys hovering over him.  Grimacing, he felt behind his head, touching the bruise.  “That fucker,” he growled, taking Benny’s hand and sitting up.  Bad idea; his head swam and he nearly pitched over.  Taking a few heavy breaths, he eventually pushed into a standing position, his hand flat against the wall.  “Where’d he go?” he demanded, eyes shut.
Lifting his head, Dean licked his lips, still silent, a faint grin on his face.  He moved his hand as he leaned in for a kiss, taking hold of Castiel’s cock as their lips met.  He chuckled when Castiel’s fingers dug into his shoulders and his back arched off the bed.  Growled when Castiel’s legs wrapped around his waist, trapping his hand between them.
Grumbling, Castiel almost buried his head in his blanket.  ”I had heard of it, yes.  It never made sense, though.”
Mrs. Havers collected her groceries and turned to Annabelle.  “I’d watch it, though.  He’s got an air about him.  I’m sure he’s a perfectly good mechanic but he seems . . . uninterested?  I spoke to him as he left today and he sure didn’t seem very chatty.”
“No!”  He winced again.  “No, I’m fine.  I swear.  I’m just . . . it’s odd,” he admitted.  He sat back, the seat creaking under him.
He halted, wondering if he should send Balthazar away.  Especially since his cousin would likely force him to go through with admitting to Dean who he was.  “God, this day is just getting worse by the second,” he mumbled.  He pulled open the door, wondering what recrimination Balthazar had in store for him.  At the sight of who was beyond the entryway, Castiel’s eyes widened in fear and he hurried to slam it shut.
Seeing a vampire in such a prominent position had roused his curiosity.  A bit of snooping and he’d found the cabin off the logging road, essentially abandoned.  Not hard to see why given the energies that surrounded the space.  Easy to move in at that point.  Buying the auto shop was a logical step.  He'd long ago learned how to manipulate finances so falsifying documents for the loan had been a snap.
want anything to do with him.  Maybe . . . maybe this was all a fool’s desperate errand on his part.  His inability to let go and walk away.
“Furthermore,” he went on, his voice softening, “you should know something of me.”  He looked at Dean, smiling calmly.  Inside, he wanted to screech and run, knowing he couldn’t take this back the moment he let it out.  “I’m a fairy, Dean.”  He expected Dean to panic or deny it.  Some argument to erupt.  What he didn’t expect was the twisted smile the man gave him.
“You . . . actually made a dick cake,” Dean snickered.  Jesus Christ; a goddamn dick cake.  Humor bubbled in his gut and he snorted, struggling to contain it.  He looked at Castiel, recognizing warmth and relief in those eyes.  “You said . . . did you spend all night on this?”
he admitted.  Fine.  The stress would just mess him up, anyway.  Might as well get back to being Castiel’s ‘
Feeling as composed as he could be, he leaned down and picked up his phone, startled to see a message on it.  He unlocked the phone and found a text from Castiel.
Dean reclaimed the pad and tucked it away behind the counter.  “Yeah, I get that.  This day and age, especially.  Can’t even shit without someone writing a blog post about it.”  He leaned over the counter, slipping off his glasses as he did.  Dean pinched the bridge of his nose and yawned before replacing his glasses.  “Look, Gabe, he doesn’t have to do anything but show up and sign some books.  If I have to, I’ll pay for him to come here.”
Castiel’s answering smile was one of warm encouragement.  “It is a fitting word, my pet.  Any time I am too much for you or you are unsettled, please don’t hesitate to use it.”
Sam took a shaky breath.  “I want you to have good things, Dean.  I want you to be happy.  If you’re happy single, that’s fine.  But if someone
And dating.  Oh, he dated all right.  Though, he never attempted pushing things to The Next Level™.  That would often mean trying to figure out if his partner was ready for the same and second-guessing himself every five seconds.  Not stress he really needed or wanted.  No harm in just having fun with a guy or gal now and again.  Keep things strictly no-strings.
Picking up his mug again, his neighbor remarked, “A bit late in the winter to sleep so, er, sparsely dressed.”  He avoiding looking at Dean, his cheeks warm as he sipped his mug.
Dean looked at him then, his eyes wide.  If he said so, Castiel would stop.  He knew that now.  “N-no, sir,” he murmured.  He recognized arousal and triumph in Castiel’s eyes.  He watched, stunned, as Castiel kept his gaze even with Dean’s, plush lips falling once more to his scars.
“I’m with you on that,” his neighbor remarked.  He smiled softly at Dean’s sharp look.  “I’m a bit of an insomniac lately.”  He held up his mug.  “Hence the tea.”
fucked up with Michael in some way but to hear Castiel tell it, all this sat on Michael’s shoulders.  Still, the fact that Castiel seemed capable?  It could very well be that Dean himself flipped the switch on Doms.  Turned them uncaring and unfeeling.
Trailing after Castiel like a lost pup.  Making lame jokes and watching them fall flat.  Grinning and winking and earning little more than a confused squint in return.
The delightful laughter made Dean grin.  “Nerd, am I?”  Castiel snickered.  “There may be something to that.”  He eyed Dean carefully.  “But perhaps you understand why I claim to know what I’m talking about, hm?”
Kneeling over Dean now, his knees awkwardly perched around the man’s hips, Castiel craned his neck to look outside.  There was a plume of blue-white smoke behind them.  He felt his stomach turn.  “Any injuries?”
After a week of trying – and failing – to find the perfect gift for his no-longer-a-bachelor brother, Dean gave up and decided to go his normal prankster route.  What better place to do so than a sex shop?  He hadn’t been inside one for a good long while.  He still had a few toys he’d use now and again but the racier stuff he’d left behind when he’d left Michael.  Still, didn’t mean he couldn’t annoy Sam with some tasteless, embarrassing gift tonight for his bachelor party.
Dean slumped in his seat, cover his face with this hands.  “Fucking Christ,” he muttered.  “Maybe this was a bad idea,” he said.
at me.  Which really wasn’t fair.  He should have looked away.  Or looked gross.  Or been a woman.”  He sat with a thump on Balthazar’s couch, mechanically taking the glass of liquid his cousin offered.  “So much easier if he’d been a woman.  Asshole,” he spat, taking a sip.  He gagged.  “Jesus!  It’s ten in the morning, Bal!”
So he and Castiel were more alike than he’d thought.  Both had resistant fathers.  Had hidden their truth to a sickening degree.  Yet, Castiel was a grown man.  On his own.  Away from his father.  That didn’t mean he had to regress so quickly, did it?  One of the first things he’d admired about Castiel had been his grounded nature.  His maturity.  This all flew in the face of that.
The supposed guy in charge.  Not the crazy writer.  How depressing.  And confusing.  He really hated having to remember that part.
Wrinkling his nose, Dean shook his head.  “Not that.”  He rolled his eyes, stomping his feet and hoping he didn’t get frostbite over this.  “What’d you take?  E?  Meth?”  He peered at the man.  “You one of those whackjobs who washes his toilet with a toothbrush?”
?  Two brothers.  A disastrous, violent pair of hunters.  He never knew their first names.  Only that hated surname.
Castiel shut his eyes, his hands shaking as he continued to clench them.  “Because . . . I feared him knowing
Dean needed so much more.  He needed hands on his skin.  That connection that only came from intimacy and the physical.  It didn’t need to be sex; not yet, anyway.  But without that touch, he drifted feeling lost in this so-called relationship.  He felt empty without it.  Bereft.  For all the man’s assurances of
They’d arranged meet at the restaurant in separate cars and Dean drove too fast to the Italian bistro, fidgeting in his seat as he did.  He arrived early, turning his music up loud to drown out the ugly thoughts in his head.  By now, his brain spun like a damn tilt-a-whirl, coming up with every dark scenario he could conceive of.  All of them ending with Castiel refusing to take him as a sub.  The moment he spied Castiel’s unruly hair, he snapped off the ignition and bolted from the car, trotting across the parking lot to the man’s side.
Castiel sipped from his coffee, finding it all too easy to understand.  Men like Alastair understood vulnerability and how to exploit it.  For all his brash ego, Dean was just as susceptible.  “So rather than get out and buy this land of yours, you feel stuck?”
The former angel pulled away abruptly, turning his head to cough.  He sniffed and turned back, smiling in apology.  ”Forgive me.”
kill a man.  Shot to death with no clear answer.  Though it ached in his chest to do so, Castiel read on, his fingers trembling with each turned page.
He didn’t even know what had happened.  From what he remembered, Dean had been fast asleep on the floor.  He hadn’t even heard him move in the night!  Just his damn luck.
Dean stood back further, trying to make himself appear invisible.  Maybe Castiel hadn’t mentioned a new partner yet.  That uneasiness could be understandable then.  Or, like a lot of men, he hid his sexuality.  Best that Dean stayed quiet and hope the visit would be a short one.
For a graduate student, on the last leg of his doctorate, Castiel had developed something of a habit in terms of studying and preparation of papers.  It usually amounted to holing himself up in his apartment, in boxers and a tshirt with a gallon of coffee on hand and his entire assignment spread around him like a paper tornado.
Balthazar signed the receipt and stood, grabbing his jacket.  ”Of course,” he purred.  He winked at Castiel and tugged on his arm.  ”Mustn’t keep our loved ones waiting, hm?”
with him. He’d felt used and cheap.  Unclean.  In the beginning, it had been about shared power.  Delight and pleasure.  But over time, it had all soured into something he’d been ashamed of.  He didn’t want that again.  He wanted to submit, he did.  But he wanted to submit to someone who’d be just as eager to take him apart.  Turn him inside out.
“Fine,” Dean relented, taking a seat behind Castiel’s desk.  Far away from the man.  What worried him, honestly, was how he
Sputtering into his drink, Castiel coughed violently, face red and eyes watering.  Dean half-rose, honestly concerned, when Castiel slipped out of his bench seat.  He wiped his mouth, licking his lips as he struggled not to look at Dean.  “I . . . I should . . . home.  Home!  I . . . left . . . shower!  Left the shower on!”
Castiel scurried around his home, throwing things into a suitcase.  He couldn’t stay here at the moment.  He’d just . . . he’d gotten what he wanted only it wasn’t what it was supposed to be.  Even faced with that, he still couldn’t admit the truth to Dean.  Dean deserved the truth.  He deserved a man who wasn’t so cowardly that he’d lie about who he was just because an attractive bookseller smiled at him.
“My what?”  Dean looked behind him, laughing as he returned to Castiel.  “Oh, you mean Jess?”  He jerked a thumb over his shoulder and Castiel followed the gesture.  At a picnic table not far away sat the blonde woman and another man.  And two little girls.  Something about that sparked familiarity for Castiel.
He’d worn them plenty with Michael.  Ankle cuffs even.  He was used the feel of tight leather, the unique scent.  Once, he’d
Castiel pressed his hands to Dean’s chest, rising and falling faster and faster as he chased that delightful thrill.  He yelped when Dean pulled him down, crushing him to his chest and rose up on his heels, slamming up into Castiel with force.  He shuddered against Dean, his leaking cock trapped between their bodies, Dean’s breath a harsh pant in his ears.
that.  And Dean hadn’t acted strangely toward him even with as brief as their contact had been.  Dean knew about Michael and hadn’t changed his view on him.  He shut his eyes and turned back to his cousin, nodding once.  “Okay,” he breathed.
He tugged hard on Dean’s hair, his hips driving up, seeking pressure.  The sensitive skin of his dick brushed Dean’s tight stomach as he moved.  He moaned, heels digging into the bed.  Oh, why had they waited?  It felt so beautiful and terrible.  The sweetest torture.  He gasped when Dean’s hand slipped from his tender nipple, running down his side to squeeze his hip.
In answer, Dean pushed up and away, the heat of his body gone in an instant.  He hovered over Castiel, face and chest flush, eyes dark.  He tilted his head, squinting.  “You’re glowing.”
Castiel glanced at him.  He looked human.  Dressed in modern clothing with brown hair and beautiful green eyes.  It was the eyes that most captured Castiel.  They were wide and deep.  Honest.  He believed every word Dean was telling him, odd as it all was.
he’d met was the real Castiel.  Both Gabriel and Balthazar hinted that to be the case but Dean couldn’t be sure.  Not when he’d had the briefest of exposure to the man.
“Hmm.”  Dean’s lips quirked and he grabbed one of Castiel’s hands, tugging off the glove.  At the sight of his reddened skin, the humor vanished in a blink and he held him gingerly, as though afraid of causing more pain.  “Cas!  Why didn’t you tell me?”
Yeah, so maybe Dean had learned long ago not to overstep or overextend in terms of life.  To take what was reachable and go no further.  Be content with the status quo.
”  He sighed.  “I stepped over the line with the kiss and I know that.  And I’m sorry.  I meant to confront you about who you were and I . . . got carried away.”
“No?”  Castiel looked around but no one had returned to the carpark.  He supposed he could bolt back to Balthazar and Gabriel but frankly, he was too intrigued and confused to move.  “You seem to have me at a disadvantage,” he murmured.
And immediately shoved it down.  No, he wouldn’t go that route.  He couldn’t set himself up to believing in the concept of even a year down the road.  Sure, they had a
He looked again at Singer’s note before shoving it into his pants’ pocket.  Maybe he’d take a look at the land in Kansas, after all.  Sight-seeing never hurt anyone, right?  He tried his damnedest to tamp down on the hope that welled up at the idea.
Not looking up, Dean continued to poke at his food.  “Driving,” he stated.  The Impala was the best stress-reliever he owned.  Something about her roar and the windows down.  The road stretching out before him.  He could get lost in her tiny universe.
He dropped down onto the couch, body quivering with aftershocks, whimpering once when Dean slipped from of his well-used ass.  He didn’t fight Dean’s gentle fingers passing over his skin.  The warm washcloth that scraped his sensitive skin free of come and sweat.  Body pliant, he went with Dean’s direction when the man returned, sprawling on the couch and gathering Castiel up against him.
They met for lunch like Dean requested and Castiel caught him, more than once, tensing at the eyes that drifted their way.  Familiar, curious eyes.  He’d sensed no ill-will from the townsfolk; merely observation.  In an effort to assuage the man, he’d reached across the table to touch Dean’s hand, only to find the fingers trembling, clenched tight.  Dean had jerked away then, tucking his hands under the table, playing it off as though nothing had happened.
Other than his brother, Bobby and his family, and Charlie, Dean didn’t often receive that kind of attention.  Not really.  Maybe negative, especially when dealing with asshole customers.  But palpable concern was new to him.  And frankly, he still didn’t know quite how to process it.  Part of him wanted to sag in relief and the rest wanted to run and demand differently.  It left him reeling if he thought on it too long.
?”  He shook his head.  “No, you had a visceral reaction to something unpleasant.”  Another warm, soft smile.  “You can still be a sub for a Dom; I just believe that cuffs are not something you should engage in.”
He turned off the phone then, unsure if he could take any new messages or attempts to reach him.  Maybe he was being dramatic with all this.  After all, it really all boiled down to books and his stubborn attraction to a bookseller.  He didn’t need to make a production out of everything, did he?
“Wait.”  Castiel rose from his chair, coming to Dean’s side, one cool hand resting against his wrist.  He peered into Dean’s eyes, the worry as clear as the week before.  “Dean, do you think I’m reprimanding you?”
Despite his tension, Dean grinned broadly.  ”I don’t know about necessary,” he chirped.  ”Fun?  Oh, yeah.”  His humor faded quickly, however.  ”But … yeah.  Sam.  I haven’t talked to Sam since I started this whole gig.  He’s kind of why.”
He looked at Castiel then.  That clear honesty he’d known for the last four years.  That same damn look that always dragged him back deep into this never-ending crush.  His cheeks grew hotter and he bit his bottom lip.  “You, uh, you sure?”
He turned his head a touch, meeting the man’s eyes.  Bright, brilliant green.  Warm with humor and lust.  But genuine.  Castiel offered up a weak smile in response.
Gabriel?” Dean asked.  He pursed his lips, eyes narrowed behind his glasses.  “Frankly, given the way you were on email, I totally expected a car salesman.”  His eyes passed over Castiel a second time.  “Glad I was wrong.”
Worried now, Sam rasped, “I didn’t find anything.  Not really.  Some suspicious bank stuff but that’s it.”  He rubbed the back of his neck, not looking at Dean.  “I thought I’d find some kind of arrest record.  Assault . . . that sort of thing.  Nothing.”
Castiel swatted the man’s hands away.  “Dean!  Quit fighting me on this!”  He cradled Dean’s face, skin cold and wet under the constant rain.  “Don’t you understand?  You don’t have to do this all alone.  You can have a home here.  With me.”  He smiled weakly.  “The two of us.  Together.  Please, understand that it’s all I want from you.  Just you.  Here.”  He swallowed rainwater, feeling tears fall.  “I told you my door was open to you; it still is.”
The other man gaped for a moment before smiling.  ”Castiel Novak,” he murmured, his voice deep and warm.  He squeezed Dean’s hand.  ”I must thank you, however; due to this route, my legs are stronger than they’ve ever been.”
He looked pointedly at Castiel then, pleased to see stunned bewilderment on the man’s face.  Castiel pointed to himself slowly, eyebrows raised.  When Dean nodded, he dropped his hand and continued to stare, frozen in place.
Dean didn’t know the guy’s name.  He referred to him – in head only because he’s not crazy, dammit – as his Commuter Angel.  Always dressed neat as a pin.  Very stern looking with those sharp blue eyes.  Which made the scruffiness of his jaw a bit weird but damn attractive.  Deep, dark voice.  The kind of voice that made honest men sin like there was nothing left in the world.
“Yeah, I kinda am,” Dean murmured, looking away.  When he faced Castiel again, his humor had tempered, leaving that strange sadness that clung to the man.  Unaware, Dean tapped the counter between them.  “Is six okay?”
Blushing from wine and Dean’s grin, Castiel mused, “I’d like that.”  He set his glass down and toyed with his fingers.  “So.  From your comment, I take it you didn’t really intend to end up here in Grovelock?”
Dean’s knees trembled and he reached up to embrace Castiel when another knock came.  He blinked, struggling to draw himself out of his haze.  Dammit, he could still taste Castiel on his lips.  Whoever the fuck had interrupted them had better be on fire.
” sign had been switched, facing out.  Even though it was a Wednesday at two in the afternoon.  Frowning, he tried the door, further confused to find it open.  “Cas?” he called out.
The man had the most intense green eyes he’d ever seen.  The hood of his raincoat had fallen back after Castiel’s unfortunate assault and his light brown hair very quickly flattened against his head.  It left the man looking youthful and thankfully, given the continuing grin, amused.  The lifted eyebrow indicated some question of response from Castiel yet, he couldn’t cease staring.
nerve.  He plucked his jacket from his chair and started humming, amused at how easily Gabriel had come undone.
“Agent Novak,” Balthazar called, a bit too loudly, “we’re having trouble with the door lock here.  Wait by the van.”
“What, I can’t be in a good mood?”  Dean smacked the back of his hand against his brother’s chest.  He knew
Half-asleep, Dean marveled at Castiel’s actions.  There was nothing inherently sexual about what he did.  He didn’t suck on Dean’s fingers lewdly.  Didn’t force Dean’s hand against his dick.  He did nothing but massage skin gently.  Sweet caresses.  Genuine affection.  The concern and care Castiel always showed him, now all the more visceral.
Worse yet, he’d been forced to use the window twice, searing his skin more deeply than he had that night a month ago.  Though, as far as he was concerned, it had been worth it.  By the time he’d left, well after two in the morning, Dean slept calmly, curled up on the threadbare couch in his living room, no longer shaking and sweating.  After a two hours of sleep, Castiel was exhausted but strangely content.
Much as he hated to admit it, Balthazar was right.  If he failed in this or if it got back to Assistant Director Singer, Castiel was finished as an agent.  And if Balthazar decided the threat wasn’t worth it, he was finished now.  But, this was Dean.  Thief or not, Dean was … well, weirdly, Castiel considered him a friend.  Even if he was on the other side of the law.  And the threats against him weren’t something a thief of his caliber should ever have run across.
Blinking, Castiel glanced at Dean, surprised to see the man hunched over defensively.  He frowned slightly.  Odd reaction.  Of course it was for a collar.  His entire job here in London had fast turned into an obligation to arrest Dean.  And, if this Alastair was as much trouble as Dean seemed to hint at, why not two birds with one stone?
Castiel stiffened, making certain to keep his eyes forward.  He didn’t want proof that he’d messed up.  He’d
Dean was clad only in a towel, skin still damp and hair flat.  His green eyes shone bright in the low light of the room.  “I want you to go,” he rasped.
With his curiosity sated regarding James, Dean realized there was really only one thing left for him to do before the signing:  Learn anything and everything about one Gabriel Milton.
Keeping one eye as discretely on the oncoming cars as he could, he turned and joined Balthazar and Dean.  The detective inspector slipped him the key to Dean’s cuffs, giving him a wink similar to Dean’s in the process.  “You may want to hold onto that.  In case you’ve misplaced yours?”
Frowning as he exited the car, Castiel muttered, “Don’t pull anything.  You’re supposed to be me, remember?”
Dean cleared his throat.  “Okay, I’ll admit, when I figured out you were lying, I was pissed.”  Castiel flinched when Dean touched the hand still on the doorknob.  “My brother’s intern knows Gabe.  He told me about him and it didn’t match you.  At all.”  He coughed again.  “So, I called the number and Gabe admitted who you really are.”
“Dude, you never get randomly hard at work?”  He laughed when Castiel groaned and dropped his head to the couch.  “Seriously.  This is the first time I’ve ever had sex back here.”  Castiel looked up then, just in time to watch Dean saunter back to Castiel’s side, his cock hard and red, tip enticingly wet.  He stroked himself once, eyes rolling up.  “Fucking hell.”  He shuddered.  “Cas, I can’t wait to get inside you.”
Dean frowned.  Another date?  Really?  Then why the change in protocol?  He shifted nervously, his feet tapping on the one patch of hardwood floor in his office.  “Uh, yeah.  No problem.”  Seemed to be a weird request.  But then again, this was Castiel.  He did things so unconventionally, yet, a strange sense of comfort and familiarity followed everything he did.  He never did anything without motive.  And the softness of his voice did little to hide the iron under it all.
He’d chat with Dean now and again.  Offer up a faint, sly smile to some comment.  But neither he, nor Dean, offered up much in the way of names.  He didn’t know why.  Dean was usually first to blurt out his life story when he saw a hot person.  Life story usually equated to fun times in the bed so why the hell not?
Stroking his jaw, Castiel hushed him softly.  “I’m here, Dean.”  He leaned up, kissing him, tongue teasing those lovely lips.  He smirked a bit when he tasted mint toothpaste rather than the previous night’s poor decisions.  He let his head fall back to the pillow and smiled.  “And I will always be here.”
Castiel smiled, reaching into the car to brush his fingertips along Dean’s wrist.  “I don’t think it’s out of line at all.”  On the contrary.  More time with Dean had managed to become his number one goal since the night before.
“Writer,” the man replied.  He held out a hand.  “Um, I should introduce myself.  I’ve seen you around but –“ he broke off, face red again.  “Anyway.  My name is Castiel Novak.”
to finish.  I do apologize for the wait but at least the series is finished and Cas has his dream man.  :D  I do hope it was worth the wait!
“He isn’t an idiot,” Castiel retorted.  Ignoring the fact that he himself was referring to Dean as such just a scant second ago, he scowled, staring blindly ahead.
pay this kind of attention to him.  He sighed when Castiel lifted his left arm, wrapping it around Dean’s shoulders, his right thumb still gently rubbing Dean’s wrist.
Frozen, Dean stared.  Pinstriped pants.  Very nice.  Soft fabric.  He’d have to ask where Commuter Angel bought his slacks when he managed to dig his face out of the man’s dick.  And no mistaking where his chin sat.  He could
Wait.  The apologies.  That was it, wasn’t it?  Dean felt guilt over this?  What on earth did he have to feel guilty for?  Castiel had given himself freely to one he loved.  Why couldn’t Dean understand that?
Castiel threw his phone on the couch, falling off his easy chair onto the floor, face smooshed into the plush carpet.  “Fu-uck,” he muttered.  He should get up and call Dean.  Apologize for Balthazar’s antics and see if the signing was still salvageable.  Though, he could use it as a way to
The werewolf lunged, colliding with the barrier Dean had set up.  He scrabbled at the air, howling and snarling, spit flying.  “She was
Castiel didn’t stop the sad trill, noting that Dean flinched when he did.  He crossed the distance between them, placing both hands on Dean’s chest.  He took a strange measure of relief that Dean’s heart was pounding nearly in tandem with his.  “I don’t care,” he murmured.  He touched Dean’s reddened cheek, forcing the man to face him.  “I truly don’t care.”
Scowling, Dean did just that.  He waited for taunts or more slams but was surprised with a quiet, “Oh, hey; that might work.”  Gabriel rattled off Balthazar’s number and Dean scribbled it onto a torn sheet of paper.
To his relief, one thing had improved since the drive-in; Castiel touched him more.  Longer touches.  Lingering.  Something Dean was all too eager for.  The other night, it had been all he could do to not chase after Castiel when the man had pulled away and headed into his home.  He’d wanted so much more.  Wanted Castiel to push him to the ground.  Bite his lip.  Use him.  Do
He tried to laugh but it cracked and tasted sour in his mouth.  “O-oh, yeah.  I . . . um . . . see . . . did . . . did you mean to give me your number?” he asked, immediately regretting the question.  He winced.
but you sure as shit didn’t need to kick me to the curb like that.”  He jabbed a finger in the empty air between them.  “You wanna know something?” he snarled, “In that moment, you made me think you were worse than Michael.”  Panic welled in his gut and he turned, presenting his back to Castiel.  Eyes squeezed shut, he admitted, “At least, with him, I knew where I stood.”
The proprietor ran his slender fingers along the red-and-black leather that now nestled against Dean’s wrist.  ”See?” he murmured.  ”Very well crafted.  Cushioned.  Perfect for … whatever you intend.”  His blue eyes were dark and warm.  Sultry, if Dean had to put a name to it.  ”Are they a surprise for your girlfriend?  Boyfriend?”
But how could he fix this?  It was clear that Castiel wasn’t about to answer his phone calls or texts.  And he could
he had at the moment with the other man.  Even if it was only temporary.  He sighed and picked up the room’s phone, dialing the take-away place he’d used the first night.
Oh.  So they would have sex?  The constant back and forth threw Dean completely off and he froze, unable to process the request.
He scurried toward a bush, sitting down on the damp barkdust as he tried to contemplate his next move.  He must have flown farther off track earlier than he’d thought given Dean’s car rumbled up the drive a short time later.  He shuffled under the detritus, burying all but his head in earth and bits of bark.
to Mr. Winchester.  Regardless of his reaction.  Promise me that?”  He softened.  “You can’t hide in fear of negativity, Castiel.  You will need to face that.”
Castiel shrugged.  “The decorations, yes.  The rest?”  Another lift of his shoulders.  “Time passes rather quickly when you’re tired.”
Dean scrubbed at his mouth with the back of his hand, lips puffy and swollen.  He grinned again, looking nearly drunk.  “You want to come in my ass, Cas?”  He licked his lips then, climbing to his feet.  Dean peeled off his briefs, his cock standing erect.  He ran a heavy hand slow along his cock, eyelids fluttering.  “This what you thought about in that shower?  Did you think about fucking me?”  He thumbed the slit of his dick, whimpering.  “I did.  This morning.  Thought about you making me come.”
The man merely smiled and squirted lotion in his hand before setting his palms against Dean’s back.  The contact made him sigh, the sound shaky and nearly punched out of him.  Warm and slick, Castiel pressed the heels of his hands into Dean’s ribs, the pressure just this side of pain.  Dean’s eyes fell shut as the news droned on and he savored the repetitive motions of Castiel’s hands.
And when Castiel turned to him, grin softening to a secret smile, it struck him:  Dean was hopelessly, stupidly, hormonally in love.
“Hm.  Until we are blue in the face,” Castiel retorted, though his lips quirked in amusement.  “Believe me, Dean; you’ll appreciate this.  It may seem tedious but it’s best we speak about such things before one of us does something the other isn’t comfortable with.”
He turned then, surprised.  Castiel appeared truly flummoxed by the comment.  He laughed softly.  “Well, yeah.  I mean, once I’m dead and gone, fuck it.  The only reason you’re here is because I was still
from the prisons of hell.  Maybe he could find it again, here with Castiel.  Maybe he could undo the damage he’d done to others with his bull-headed nature.
His body jostled when Dean chuckled.  The man’s other arm lay on his shoulder and Dean squeezed him once.  “You a cat, Cas?”
you.”  He pulled back, lips bruised.  The grief was beginning to fade from his eyes, their color once more bold and bright.  “Sorry, but, I think I’m keeping you,” he teased.
Dean’s green eyes flicked to him and away as he toyed with the stem of his glass.  “Changed a lot of stuff, actually.  Had this –“ he waved his hand “—preset idea of how things should be.  It didn’t really . . . pan out for me.  So, here I am.  In Bumfucknowhere.”  He snickered.  “Drinking wine.”
“Dean, did you know, I’m under a death warrant from my people.”  He could read Dean’s confusion as his other hand dropped from Castiel’s arm but he pressed on.  “I spent too much time with humans as a youth.  Curiosity was my downfall.  They thought me traitor to our kind.”  He dropped his hand from Dean’s cheek, stepping back.  “My king still trapped human children now and again.  He thought, if I became an ally of the local humans, I’d end his fun.”
was why Dean wasn’t going to his own wedding any time soon.  Being gob-smacked in love with your sound guy was kind of a problem.  He’d known Castiel ever since he’d gotten this job six years ago, but never in that time had he sussed out if Castiel was gay or bi.  The man was dry and seemingly lacking in humor but more than once, he caught a sly grin on the man’s face when he managed to get one over on someone.
Unable to think of a reply, Dean just pulled on his leather jacket, looking up as he looped his scarf around his neck.  Then froze.  And did
“Uh, wha?”  He grinned suddenly, teeth flashing in the low light.  “Never mind; it’s all good, Cas.”  He faced forward, sweeping his light along the ground.  “Just think, in a few short hours, you’ll be rid of me.”
Realizing he meant more than the celluloid, Dean nodded.  “Uh, yeah.  It was . . . different.”  He looked up then, finding brilliant blue.
Confused, Castiel looked up.  Balthazar handed him a sheet of paper.  It looked like a house listing.  No, a commercial listing.  Recently sold.  Held a retail garage.  His face burned as he looked up.
Terrible taste in clothes, though.”  He bit his lip to keep from snickering as he watched Castiel try in vain to get out from under all the cords currently wrapped around his arm.
Fidgeting, Dean crumpled up his burger wrapper.  Okay to want things?  Naw, the things he wanted he couldn’t have.  What he
Fork hanging from his mouth, Dean glared at him.  ”Not simple,” he growled.  He swallowed, licking sauce from his lips, eyes sharp points of color.  ”You wanna know why I can’t be caught?  Why I can’t stay in one place?”
Dean stared at him.  That opened a whole can of worms Dean didn’t want to look into.  Why would he have made an exception for Dean?  That seemed so damn odd.  He bit the inside of his cheek, forcing himself to focus.  “Just easier to ignore them that way, huh?”
The man scowled at Castiel again.  “You managed to break the goddamn contract.  You aren’t supposed to give the damn thing away.”
care for Dean.  Wanted to know more of him and to spend all his waking hours with him, if Dean wanted.  He decided then and there that he didn’t care if Dean truly had been a hunter.  It didn’t matter.  Dean Jefferson lived
“Oh!  Oh!  Uh . . . this is James.  Bartlett.  James Bartlett.  He writes books.”  He winced and rubbed his forehead.  “But you knew that,” he muttered.  He sighed and turned to James.  “James, this is Dean Winchester, owner of
He sighed, realizing he’d made his job a little more difficult.  Under the horrible storm, he squatted down and began dragging Dean’s limp body back into the cabin.  Given the man’s muddy state, he opted to strip Dean in the entryway, leaving soiled clothing in a soggy pile.  Huffing and wheezing, he lumbered his way through the cabin, Dean little more than a lead weight in his hands.
Castiel sighed, and flew a bit higher, pressing his hands to the top of Dean’s head.  He layered a calming spell on the man, feeling the tension ease and Dean’s breathing slow and deepen.  He fluttered down, finding Dean’s eyes shut, his head lolling.
Dead tired, dressed only in boxer shorts, Dean seriously contemplated letting himself burn alive rather than actually leave the building.  As the strobe lights continued, he sighed and trudged up the stairs, knowing he had no chance of heading back to his own apartment for a robe at the least.
That was the other odd thing.  Castiel had that warm, bright home in town but had insisted on moving to Dean’s drafty cabin, even after he’d pointed out that it sat on the border of his king’s land.  That had to be dangerous for Castiel.  Not that he’d ever go into depth on it.
Annoyed now, Dean moaned, “Quit swearing and tell me what the fuck is going on!”  Christ.  This sounded terrible, whatever it was.  Dean was being lied to by
“Cas,” Dean began, voice soft.  “You . . . you’re better than me.  Just . . . forget I’m here, okay?  I won’t even shop at your store.  I’ll go out of town.  I swear.”  Another crooked smile.  “It’ll be better this way; I promise.”
The other man nodded, frowning lightly.  “Neither have I.  Certainly doesn’t look local.”  He tilted the vessel.  “Greek maybe?”  He made a noise.  “Almost Roman looking; tile-work is a bit odd though.”
"You, uh, are the only one who’s actually arrested him; yes?" Balthazar murmured.  He was grinning again, his eyebrows lifted high, fingers drumming against the photo of Dean winking.
He forced a smile.  “Yeah, I have a lot of your fans here in town or nearby.  I mean, if it’s really a hassle, we don’t need to but I know there are a great number who’d love to meet you.”
“I . . . I mean if you’re busy.  It’s not . . . we can do something else.  Like, meet for drinks?  Or . . . or coffee?  We . . . could stop by for a quick chat?”
That startled the demon.  He blinked and then looked out the window.  “Uh, dunno,” he admitted.  He looked at his hands.  “Thing is, never thought I’d get free.  So … got no backup plan,” he admitted.
He jerked when the water shut off.  He sat up, cross-legged, plucking at the old quilt on Dean’s bed.  He’d been so confident this morning.  So ready to show Dean he had nothing to fear.  But it might not be enough.  Dean might only be looking for the best way to end it forever.  These fears of his were long-learned and deep-seated.  Ingrained by time and repeated experience.  Castiel might not have a chance to break its hold on Dean.  He didn’t look up when the door opened, only reacting when he felt the bed shift.
But how could he be here in Grovelock if he’d been collected?  Confused, Castiel flipped through several more pages; more demonic lore.  Then a short sentence.
about Dean’s desire to sub.  And this sure as shit wasn’t the way his brother was going to find out.  Nope.  Dean would haul himself out of this fucked up mess like always.  Go home and drink.  Or something.
Dean got more than one odd look from the firemen for his loopy grin but at that point, he couldn’t drum up enough fucks to care.
Finally, James seemed willing to give up his game, sitting back in his chair with an aggrieved sigh.  “If I must,
She grinned and returned the gesture.  “Done slaving over a stove.  I thought you taught your brother how to cook?”  She winked at Sam.  “He’s absolutely useless in a kitchen.”
Castiel walked around him, careful to keep the man in his sights.  “About being a hunter, yes.  Not about being . . .
The casual swears and the averted gaze spoke of Dean’s uneasiness.  Taking a deep breath, Castiel threw his head back again, hands fisted at his side.  “Do you want me to curse you, Dean?  Walk away and reject you?”
Still, it didn’t change what he felt for Dean.  He loved the man.  Shadows or not.  Dean had been nothing but kind to him.  As
He didn’t see Dean the next day until noon but the man carried with him a shy, secretive smile when he came into the hardware store.  He pointed at Castiel’s gloved hands and mused, “You cold?”
Dean waves a hand.  What was he saying?  Oh, right.  Hot guy.  He jabs a finger toward Pretty Voice.  "You should know," he starts, swaying a bit as he steps away from Pretty Voice, "I'm
Startled by the venom in Balthazar’s voice, Castiel sat back, blinking.  ”I see,” he murmured.  Unable to help his curiosity, he asked, “How does this … leak not know about Benny?”
Castiel laughed uneasily.  “Oh, yes.  I’ve been a bit . . . out of sorts today.  Apologies.”  He’d known Mr. Wallace ever since he took a mortal form.  The elderly werewolf was nothing like the legends his people spoke of.  The few times he did transform, Castiel often found him dozing in his own garden, nestled among the protection charms until morning.  He had to wonder what it was his people feared in their kind.
He licked his lips and looked over his shoulder then, finding Dean watching him, the concern almost a physical caress.  The man smiled at him and winked before turning back to face the murmuring crowd.
Heart thundering, Dean pressed his palms into his desk.  “See, this guy?  He’s pretty much my best friend.  Dorky as hell, though.”  Castiel tilted his head, frowning now in confusion.
of condemnation he heard in Dean’s tone.  The self-hate palpable like a storm.  “I’m not about to condemn you for your profession.  Perhaps I should,” he shrugged.  “I won’t.”
had created the supposed horrors that the Winchesters embodied.  How this man – John – was adamant his sons would become hunters.  That they would tear the world in the name of revenge.
Christ, Dean knew?  About Michael and Castiel’s stupidity?  He rubbed his eyes, wondering if he could still leave.  Just bolt out the door and never come back.  He’d made plenty of money with his previous books.  He could completely recede from life and just live in his house until it fell around his ears.
Not listening, Castiel began straightening up the kitchen, scraping old food in the garbage and cleaning stains and God knew what else from glasses and plates.  More than once, Dean tried to yank a plate from his hand but he merely turned and glared.  Eventually, Dean gave up, moving away and slumping off to the living room.
Try as he might, he couldn’t help but speed home.  He’d fully expected his dick to wilt by that time but whether from disuse or Castiel’s thrilling touches, he remained rock hard the entire way.  He hurried into the house, not bothering with the lights as he slammed the deadbolt home.  He trotted to his bedroom and stripped before crossing the threshold, almost sobbing with relief as his cock sprang up.
Green eyes fluttered.  “Duh, idiot.”  Again that odd red-black flash.  “Do you have any idea what you did?”
Dean could feel his cheeks warm at the direct look Castiel gave him.  He shrugged and turned away, rubbing his neck.  ”If I wanted the actual number, yeah.  But I was just checkin’ to make sure you weren’t burnin' up.”  He focused on the kitchen cabinets, trying to ignore the continued staring he could
Swallowing, Castiel bit out, “Because you would have killed me the first night I visited your cabin.”
Dean managed to catch Kevin on a lunch break, though given the man’s harried tone, he likely didn’t have long.  “Kevin Tran?” he prodded.
Castiel parked the car at the curb, smiling a bit.  This seemed to be the place.  Barely a block from a new housing complex.  Big open space.  Large, old garage.  There was a giant “SOLD” emblazoned on the realty sign.  And a black classic sat in front of building and another, newer, car waited beside it.
Then, one Sunday, his coffee maker broke.  With nothing else in the apartment, he gathered up his work and scurried to the closest twenty-four-hour coffee shop.  There were a great number of undergrads half asleep over textbooks and laptops but Castiel managed to snag a low couch in the far corner with a massive, low table before it, suitable for homework spreading.
“No,” he muttered.  He made good money writing the same thing over and over again so it was hard to truly complain about it.  His books sold all over the world at this point.  Even if the stories were fairly similar.  There was a market for gay erotica regardless of the variety.
Again the anger.  Dean snorted and went on.  ”Yeah, Sam.  ’course you know about Sam.”  He smirked.  ”You’re a bit obsessed with me, Cas,” he chided.
It went on like that for another hour.  Simple talk about cars and movies Dean had seen.  He found that Castiel wasn’t much for the box office but he assured Dean that he’d join him soon for something explosive and loud.  Castiel shared his love of reading with Dean, launching into a glowing review for some dramatic book he’d just finished and Dean couldn’t help but smile at Castiel’s affection for it.
Dean said nothing, only clenched his jaw and turned back to the Impala.  Slow was bad, though.  Slow meant . . . well, he wasn’t really sure what it meant.  Wasn’t sure why it was
“Gorgeous,” the man mused.  He shifted the to-go bag to his other hand as he pulled open the door, looking toward Dean and grinning.  “I mean that, Dean.  It’s a beautiful car.”
Merely preparing myself.”  He met Dean’s gaze and blushed.  “I still don’t know if I’m what they wanted but –“
“Told him what?”  Castiel squinted at his cousin.  He hadn’t even told Balthazar his plan; what on earth had he told Dean?
Castiel yelped when Dean turned on him, both hands fisted on his collar.  He winced as the movement pulled at his injuries but shook Castiel once.  ”Who the
Dean frowned.  “Huh.  Wouldn’t have guessed that.”  He sipped at his wine.  “Guess it takes all kinds.”
made Castiel hard just by having a damn orgasm!  More addictive than any drug or alcohol and he couldn’t be sure he’d be able to give it up at this point.
His brother might be obnoxious but he was still his brother.  Smiling sadly, he shook his head.  “No, I’m fine.  It . . . it’s fine.”  Hard to explain how disappointed he was.  But then, why’d he ever think a man like Dean would be single?  He’d probably had a mate of some kind since puberty, given his looks.
Sighing, Castiel squinted at Sydney.  “I doubt he’s a hunter.  You’re just nervous because he’s new and young.  Which is understandable.  But he isn’t a hunter.”
As he became acclimated to sight and sound again, Castiel realized he lay prone in a hospital bed with machines beeping and tubes trailing from him.  He lifted his hand and glared at the IV in the back of it.
"You aren’t fine," Castiel returned, staring at him pointedly.  "This brother of yours.  Let me call him.  You’re in no shape to drive."
He was going to do something dastardly to Pam’s car after all this.  Hands balled into fists against his thighs, he forced out, “Nope.  Still pretty much . . . single.”  Jesus.  He felt like he’d been thrown onto a shitty dating show.
Shrugging, Castiel pulled their food out, handing one to Dean.  “They’re pants.  It’s why I have a dry cleaner.”  He winked at Dean and handed him a plastic fork.  “This is much better, Dean.  It’s quite lovely out here.”
I have too many stories.  TOO MANY STORIES.  I'll get to them all, eventually.  I was just in a writing funk for about a month.  *shrugs*
The man nodded.  ”Yup.  Amelia’s Benny’s wife.  He stopped by that first night to pick something up from her.  He does that every night but I usually stay in the car.  But dammit … you had to be sitting there so I
“Hey, Cas?” Dean purred, leaning in and sucking with gentle pressure on Castiel’s neck.  “I want you on a bed.  All splayed out.  But, I don’t think I can wait.”  He blew on the damp skin and Castiel whimpered, fingers digging into Dean’s t-shirt at his waist.  “I got a couch in the back.  A nice one.  Think we can make use of it?”
“Sex.  In a car,” Dean enunciated.  Or tried to.  Probably sounded more like “seshinca” than anything remotely close to English.  He had added a ridiculous eyebrow wiggle to get the point across.  Charm.  Or something.
“Oh, for …” Dean groaned.  His hand came up swiftly but Castiel was ready, dodging out of the way, snickering when Dean only managed to slap himself in the head.
Castiel could just see his car.  Not that far.  Yet, it seemed interminable at this rate.  ”What’s that, Dean?” he asked, hoping to humor the man.
Dean’s breath left in a pop of air and he blurted, “I should have called earlier; I’m sorry!”  His hand clenched spastically atop the arm of his chair and he jiggled his foot, waiting for the agreement.  He’d always been told to contact Michael at 10:05 every morning if he hadn’t spent the night with the man.  To the minute.  For all of Castiel’s assurances, he
“Would . . . shall I call James in?” he asked, half-heartedly.  He still remembered how Dean said he liked
what a homophobic upbringing felt like.  But even then, Dean hadn’t blown his boyfriends off like they were nothing.  He’d play the part of “just a bro” but never ignored them.  Show disdain.
"How long what?" Castiel asked, leaning on the hostess’ podium, earning a dark look from her in the process.  He was too tired to care, though.  "Dean, you’re not making sense."
He rubbed his forehead as he sighed and shifted, leaning his head back against the wall.  He couldn’t figure out why but it almost
he though, strutting his way to Commuter Angel’s side.  He didn’t really hear the commotion behind him he was so intent on his destination.  About a foot from his crush’s side, he heard a bellowed, “
Dean waited until the door closed before turning back to the Impala.  He slid inside, digging his fingers into his thighs.  Not until he was home.  He couldn’t come until he was home.
him.  Something frightened him but the idea of self-direction hardly entered it.  He’d left his brother for much the same reason, Castiel didn’t doubt.  Dean had referred to himself as poison.  Dean felt he himself was the threat.  And the idea that the man would push him away rather than take what he offered because of his own shattered self-worth cut at Castiel deeply.
“That’s a point for me, Cas,” he murmured as the door shut behind Castiel.  He reached into his wallet and pulled out a few bills to cover their drinks.  He whistled to himself as he left, already concocting Stage Two of his plan.
Dean’s eyes dilated, a thin, shining band of green as he sagged where he knelt.  “I . . . made a name.  Made deals with demons.  Died.  Went to Hell.  Broke the world.  Lied.  Murdered.  Stole.  Ain’t nothing . . . good about me.”  His voice came over like gravel, as though each word had to be yanked from his throat.  He shook violently, leaning heavily against Castiel’s hand where it still lay against his cheek, even as Castiel sang low and quiet.  “Sam’s right.  I’m selfish.  Gonna . . . get you killed.  Because . . . I can’t . . . I’m not good.”  He heaved suddenly, eyes shutting.  “Fucking Winchester.  Ain’t nothin’ good in that name any longer.”
He had Bobby to thank for that.  The call had come in just after they’d finished offing a poltergeist that had infested a rare book room.  Dean had nearly ignored the call given how tired he was but a sixth sense had prompted him to answer.  Thank fuck he had.  It was rare that Bobby sent an SOS when on a hunt with Rufus.  Which meant they’d barely waved goodbye to the bookseller before they were on the road again.
He could.  He could let this go, let Dean have his machismo and get on with his life.  Instead, he stormed into Dean’s personal space, watching him stiffen.  “I refuse,” he hissed.  One thing the stories never mentioned; the stubborn nature of a fairy.  Perhaps Castiel was making a mistake but he loved Dean.  And he had seen the man grow calmer over the last two months.  Last night, however, had thrown him completely.
Sam scrolled his phone and pointed.  “Looks like a place about ten miles ahead.  Don’t worry; I’ll get it to go.”
Castiel licked his lips, tasting salt.  He scrubbed at his eyes and sighed.  Lies didn’t matter any longer.  So why not just let it all out?  “I didn’t tell you who I was because . . . I didn’t . . . I didn’t think I’d live up to your expectations.  You were so . . . enthusiastic.”  Standing in his hallway in socked feet, he felt like a teenager about to be scolded.  “I
He pushed the man and rolled him, tucking his own jacket underneath his head as he did.  He winced at the blood along Dean’s arm.  Could be good, could be bad.  He pulled away fabric and swiped at Dean’s skin, looking for the bullet hole.
Dean sipped at his coffee, continuing to read his paper.  ”Mmhmm.  So tell me, o dead one, throat hurt?”
Which would likely mean leaving Castiel completely behind.  Maybe BDSM altogether.  At this point, he couldn’t deny that he had the shittiest luck these days with Doms.  Maybe that sort of life hadn’t been meant for him.  But fuck!  Even now, remembering that first night of commands, the way his body had unraveled simply
Castiel opened his mouth to respond when his phone rang.  He moved to the kitchen and picked up the cell he’d left on the bar counter.  Before he’d managed a hello, a rough voice snapped, “The hunter’s there, isn’t he?”
what he was supposedly thinking when Dean himself couldn’t even really figure it out.  It rankled but also, weirdly, thrilled him.  Neither Michael nor Azazel cared enough to find out about
Castiel wanted to say something.  Anything.  To curse Dean.  To scream at him.  To beg for answers.  But the words all crowded in his throat, sharp and terrible.  Made all the more worse by the desire and desperate love that still churned his heart.  He met Dean’s eyes, seconds before squeezing his own shut.  He said nothing, merely ran for Dean’s door, slipping out into the rain, hearing the man stumbling after him, shouting his name.  It all turned to buzzing nonsense as his car fishtailed down the wet, gravel road, the storm raging around him.
That latter bit definitely left his stomach twisting.  The Scottish gang leader was smart and deadly; and if Dean ended up on his radar, Castiel wasn’t all too certain he’d make it in time.
Dean looked up, almost guiltily when Castiel came closer.  He snapped the small item shut and tossed it toward the couch.  It bounced over the cushions before falling to the floor with a slap.
Sydney shifted the canvas bag of tools and new gloves and shrugged.  “He . . . seems fine.  I mean, he doesn’t act any different.”  He looked around him, however, before leaning in.  “I can smell despair, though.  It’s eating at him.”
Which had to be why he’d gone nearly to the nines in dressing for Sam’s party.  Nice slacks, waistcoat and crisp white shirt.  Dark blue tie.  Like a job interview . . . or a funeral.  Thankfully, most everyone else had dressed rather well and Dean blended in quickly.  Over the course of the evening, the house filled with family and friends, music playing and lights bright and cheery.  He found Castiel easily – like a boner beacon or something – and spent most of the night making comments under his breath as his brother managed to become more and more inebriated.
Castiel stared at the wall.  “Cast you aside, you mean?”  He faced Dean, skin pale and drawn.  “I can’t be sure,” he admitted, the words drawn out slow and quiet.  “I want to claim that I never would.  But when I am around that man, something in me breaks.”  Castiel began to pace again, slower this time.  “That I would do this to you, after all you’ve suffered,” he mumbled, more to himself than to Dean.  He ceased moving, fingers to his lips.  “You’re right,” he whispered.  “I am quite a bit worse than Michael.”
of me,” he breathed, stunned.  He blinked rapidly, wounded and in awe.  “You fear me.”  He backed away then, trying to comprehend what he’d felt.  What in all the earth did Dean have to fear from him?  He was an outcast fairy.  His magic was little more than parlor tricks given his constant human state.  Lillian had warned him of that.  The longer he wore her charm, the more human he’d become.
He turned back to his book, reading on, losing track of time as the rain continued and the minutes ticked by.  The next time he glanced at his watch, he was dismayed to see it was nearly one in the morning.  And … he hadn’t seen his officer.
wrong.  He only hoped he could repair things quickly.  “Uh, Gabe, look; I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean to push.  I thought . . . I thought you were . . .” he didn’t get far before Castiel was talking again.
He opened his eyes slowly, avoiding looking down at his over-excited crotch.  “Um, thanks.  I mean that,” he answered honestly.  He didn’t even know how that could be possible given that his heartbeat sounded like a freight train in his ears and he didn’t think he’d breathed in the last minute.
you there.”  He met Dean’s eyes then.  “Will you do this for me, pet?”  He tilted his head slightly.  “Remember, if you don’t wish to, merely text me
he finished, amused.  Since relinquishing his grace fully and accepting life as a human, Castiel had been experiencing
Dean nodded, grinning.  He leaned forward, hands clasped and chewed on his lip slightly, almost snickering when he caught the sudden intake of breath.  Kink number one hit, clearly.  He worked his lip a few seconds more before answering, amused at how Castiel couldn’t seem to stop watching the action.
To his surprise, the other man yanked free, stumbling and colliding with the closed door.  “I’m sorry,” he whispered.  “I’m so sorry.”  He gave Dean one last, broken look before shoving open the door and pelting down the sidewalk.
“Jesus,” Dean breathed.  “Why are you so fucking stupid?” he growled.  He jabbed Castiel in the chest.  “I told you not to read that fucking thing!”
Castiel’s head throbbed and his vision blurred but he managed to remain in a crouch and edge his way down the hall, pausing when Benny did the same.  The hallway, unlike the garage, had little light and both guards had yet to turn their direction.  Gritting his teeth, Castiel rose from his crouch, knees popping and back aching.  Fuck, he might finally be too old for this crap.
,” he retorted.  He regretted it almost instantly given how quickly Dean’s gleeful smirk faded.  He almost took it back when Benny interrupted, thrusting small flashlights into their hands.
But Dean was a pro.  He knew how to handle unwelcome advances.  He balled up his desperation and dismay into a wee hard stone that would sit in his gut and fester until it became an ulcer.  And he could be Castiel’s
Unmindful of Castiel’s turmoil, Dean swiped his hands on his jeans.  “Hey, you want some coffee?” Dean asked.  Without waiting for a response, he turned, heading into the back half of the building.  In a small kitchen, he gestured to the elaborate coffee setup on the only counter.  He smiled somewhat shyly.  “Nothing too fancy, but I have a bit of a vice.”
He caught the brief clench of Castiel’s jaw but didn’t wait long enough for the taunt to register further before wrenching the door open.  Scraping his way through, he slammed it shut behind him, taking a bit of perverse pleasure in how the window inset rattled in protest.  Humiliated and disgusted, he tromped to his car, ignoring the rain that had begun to fall.  Even so, he strained his ears to listen for a response.  Some kind of excuse or explanation.
It couldn’t be his imagination that he read suspicion in those once friendly eyes.  But the look passed and Dean nodded.  “Outskirts.  Old logging road?”
Dean waved a hand.  ”Naw, man.  I’m good.  Just … yeah.  Good.”  He stepped around Castiel, heading for the front of the store.  He didn’t make it far before Castiel grabbed him by the shoulder.
“Gorgeous.”  He reached behind him, stripping his t-shirt off with one pull.  Hair fluffed up, he looked back up at Castiel.  “Beautiful.”  His fingers danced along the tight skin of Castiel’s hip.  With the shirt gone, Castiel
Little shit had been in his hotel room.  And by the empty bottles, managed to ring up a cool hundred in unallowable expenses.
tell when I’m actually drunk.”  He reached out and yanked the keys from Castiel’s slack hand.  ”But damn; you made me wait for this one.”
Confused, Castiel furrowed his brow.  He looked at Benny, crouched beside him, seeing the same befuddlement.  Crowley spoke as though he and Alastair were partners, not rivals.  So why had Alastair sent Dean after those coins?
“Cas, you don’t have to be all careful with me,” he said finally, rolling his eyes.  “I’m not a goddamn china doll.”
They shared another brief, promising kiss at the door before Castiel waved him off, watching until the car’s taillights faded.
Four months after meeting Dean for the first time, he had the man’s lunch nearly ready when he heard Dean chime, “Two, Cas.”
“I mean, that’s just it!” Sam gestured with his fork in exasperation.  “You make jokes.  You sit there and think, ‘
Sniffing with feigned annoyance, Castiel pulled his hands free from Dean’s grip.  He tugged his glove back on and mused, “
Castiel tilted his head, squinting.  “You don’t dirty this place up, Dean.”  He reached out without thinking, stroking Dean’s wrist.  “I think, honestly, that you belong here.  So . . . I’m happy your dart led you here.”  He squeezed the man’s wrist once more, dropping his gaze and turning back to the lasagna.  “Um, should be good now,” he hedged, digging through his drawers for a spatula.  When Dean was still quiet, he looked up to see shock and even fear on the man’s face.  “Dean?” he asked, keeping his voice low.
Not wasting time, Castiel stomped up to Dean and grabbed him by the coat collar, dragging him into a kiss.  Dean was stiff against him, tense and wary.  But he melted quickly, returning the kiss eagerly, arms sliding around Castiel’s waist.  It didn’t last long, however.
Uh, uh.  No fucking way Dean was going to tuck tail and give Castiel a way out.  No, he deserved a goddamn answer for that insult.  “If we don’t talk about it
Soaking wet, his pants ruined, Dean couldn’t have been happier.  He pulled one of the man’s hands down, sliding his own into the rough palm.  ”I’m Dean.  Dean Winchester.  Have to say, I kind of like the new scenery.”
Dean blew out a quick breath, grinning weakly.  “Sorry.  Been a while since I’ve done this thing.  I won’t lie, Cas; I’m a bit of a . . . I guess
?  Still confused, Castiel looked over his shoulder, spying the back of Balthazar’s head as he sipped from his glass.  Brow furrowed more, he nudged, “Do you by chance mean Balthazar?”  He still hadn’t figured out who the man was.  Familiar, but he wasn’t clear on
Too much.  Or not enough.  His skin felt tight and loose, burning and cold with each passing moment.  He was eternally grateful for the bracelet he wore, his magic tightly controlled even as Dean did his best to unravel him.  Regardless of the binding, he could see his skin glow faintly, soft and warm, pulsing like his racing heart.
Which was true but that didn’t mean Castiel could do it himself.  He shook his head.  “Balthazar, I can’t.  I can’t ruin my image by being . . . me.”  He sat with a thump.  “If I show up as
Dinner went well.  Castiel had made baked ziti and Dean though he might die from how good it tasted.  They talked about work and Dean finally brought up Sam and his upcoming wedding.  Castiel listened intently, asking questions but never made a nudge about the wedding itself.  If he thought that
He tweaked Dean’s ear, smirking at the yelp.  ”You also owe me about a hundred pounds for digging into my mini-bar.  Therefore, you’re not to leave my sight until this
Castiel inclined his head, squinting.  Maybe.  But, maybe not.  He purred and trilled, shaking his head.  No, regardless of what happened, he
His brother opened his mouth to protest but snapped it shut quickly.  Looking defeated, he nodded.  “Yeah, fine.  Okay.  I’m still putting you down for plus one, though.  So find a plus one, dammit,” he added with a grin.
Director Larson shrugged.  “I’ve got enough information from Benny and Balthazar; I say we’re good.”  He pulled out a small sucker and unwrapped it, jamming it in his mouth.  “Anything more than that is overkill, Novak.”
He couldn’t move, though.  Completely and totally stuck, even with the chill of the rain making him shiver.  Now, Castiel was well aware of his rather . . . awkward day-to-day behavior.  If he could trip on bare flooring, he would.  If there was gum on the sidewalk, he stepped in it.  And now, apparently, he assaulted people with shitty umbrellas.
Sydney was young.  In terms of vampires, anyway.  Maybe a decade turned?  He’d fled his sire’s abuse, taking haven here with the two sister vampires, Ashanti and Miam.  That had been less than six months ago.  Surely, Sydney’s fear had led him to this.
He enjoyed it far and above his work behind a desk.  He kept busy, was out of doors, spent more time with his brother and . . . well, there was
" Dean whined.  "I can’t … seriously?"  He wriggled violently, growling.  "What if I have to piss?!"
to … introduce myself but … not like this.”  He moaned again.  ”I’ll pay the dry cleaning; I promise.”
Brain rebooted, Dean grinned, tightening his grip on Castiel.  He nuzzled the man’s nose and replied, “Merry Christmas, Cas.”
Once there, he pounded on the door, calling Dean’s name.  Unlike in his fairy form, the surface of the wood didn’t hurt as much when he appeared as a human.  He might need to ask Lillian about that.  But, it was likely further proof of how far he’d fallen from fairydom.
That caught his attention.  Castiel paused in his work, looking up.  Even in the shadows, Dean could see Castiel’s eyes darken in sympathy.  “Because I want you happy, Dean.  If you’re happy, then I’m happy.”  He closed up the box and set it aside, grabbing the spare one and Dean’s plate, repeating the actions.  “I swear,” he muttered, “if I ever meet either of these men, I’ll remind them what a Dom is.”  He glanced up at Dean, smiling faintly.  “I don’t know how else to make you understand, Dean, then to simply
"I can’t tell you, Cas.  You’re going to have to let me go, though.  I’m supposed to check in with him ever week.  My deadline’s in a few hours."  He laughed weakly.  "I shouldn’t have come here.  But … this last job was expressly stated.  Had to get those jewels to him.  But then Crowley got me before I could make the drop."  He lifted both hands, rubbing his face.  "I fucked up bad, Cas.  And now Sam’s gonna pay."
Castiel, strangely, followed, kneeling beside him, still holding his unbuckled wrist.  The concern hadn’t faded; if anything, it’d only increased.  ”Dean.  Please.  I hadn’t intended to harm you.”  He sighed, rubbing Dean’s wrist gently.  ”Forgive me.  I overstepped.  Please, wait here.”
"You are also a thief and you broke into an Interpol agent’s room after stealing from a notorious gang leader."  He sniffed, inwardly amused by Dean’s petulance.  "At the very least, I should send you straight to headquarters without a second thought."
Darting through the opening, he sped toward Dean’s home, knowing he wouldn’t be there for a few hours at best.  It gave him plenty of time to snoop and hopefully learn something more of Dean and his brother.  He might have walked out of Dean’s shop that day but he hadn’t given up yet.  The man was so damnably inscrutable, however.  Kept things close and tight and never let a thing slip.  Well, no more.  Castiel would not allow it.  He’d make Dean understand that he wasn’t a victim in this.  That Dean’s presence no more harmed him than the hours slipping by in a day.
come back to the office until you’ve a good, long, shag.”  As Castiel stood unsteadily, he held up a finger.  “Remember.  Brother.  Preferably with a tight ass.  Or even a neighbor.”
Dean would have thought his elation regarding the ramped-up nature of his relationship with Castiel would have faded by the next day, overtaken by the same stomach-churning anxiety he’d been beset with since Day One.  It didn’t, though.  The passionate pleasure lingered in his blood clear until dinner with Sam and Jess on Sunday.  His weekend, for once, remained relatively easy and enjoyable; he couldn’t even remember the last time that had happened.  Maybe there was something to Castiel’s pleas of
Castiel frowned and gestured to Dean.  “Dean?” he prodded.  “Please, follow me.”  He was dressed similar to the week before; clean, tight jeans, this time, a light gray Henley given the turn to cooler weather.
Castiel groaned and covered his face.  It wasn’t quite that, for certain.  Troubles for sure but Dean was nothing more than a thorn in his side.  Attractive, but still a thorn.  He couldn’t very well tell Balthazar that he was flustered because his jewel thief liked to leave him saucy notes and bicker with him.
shit.  Castiel laughed weakly.  “I’m, uh, kind of poor at correspondence, I admit.”  He cleared his throat, mindful of Dean’s green eyes following his movements.  “Er, are you sure you want Bartlett here?  He can be . . . underwhelming.”
The pair were silent as they ate, Dean almost bouncing in his seat in amused joy and Castiel willing with every atom of his body to bring his erection to a more manageable level.  As their forks slid across the plates, Dean rose suddenly, still licking pie from his lips.  “My turn,” he chimed, grabbing Castiel’s empty plate before he could protest.  “Least I can do, Cas.”
Castiel sniffed again, still smiling.  After a moment, the smile shifted to a frown.  ”Wait.  Aren’t viruses contagious?”
“Hrm?”  Castiel was dizzy.  He couldn’t quite follow what Dean was saying.  He licked his lips, so close.  So damn close to this man.  It would probably taste divine to kiss him.  He could just imagine; Dean would be warm and sweet.  Probably taste like honey.  Maybe he’d crush Castiel to his chest, grab his ass.  Grind against him.  He whimpered a little, his imagination running on overdrive.
was the guy claiming to be Gabriel?  Why the hell would he have lied to Dean?  Frustration surged and he clenched his fist.  That was it, he was going to cancel this damn thing and rip this
The noise Castiel made might have been English but his brain refused to translate it.  Instead, his entire being turned all focus on the warm strength gripping his ass.  The litany of ‘
Castiel lifted a hand and he blanched, noting the faint golden glow seeping from his skin.  He blushed again, looking away.  “Um, weakness.”
He looked over to find Dean still smirking and Balthazar leaning in to whisper something that just made the man wink in his direction.
And he knew, if anyone heard him say that, they’d think the wrong thing — which might actually be the
He offered Castiel a brief smile before turning to the house.  Dean bit his lip as his fingers shook but he managed to get the key in the door and the door opened without dropping them.  He nearly shut the door behind him in reflex, remembering at the last second to wait for Castiel.
I apologize for taking so long on this.  Completely unintended but I'm having a bit of a smut block as of late.  D:  Hopefully, it's a good ending to a goofball story.
He made it to his car before he realized there were eyes on him.  He made no effort to hide his inspection, however.  The town was small enough that anyone who dared had to have a reason for such perusal.  However, he found nothing out of the ordinary.  He shrugged off the odd feeling and headed for home.
That must have been it, then.  The angel who’d healed Sam, hidden away inside him.  It was that which had caused their falling out.  Broke the Winchester brothers completely.  The entries barely referred to Sam going forward.  Just bits of information from Dean’s point of view as he moved around.
Castiel learned a great deal.  Dean’s one great love, the one possession he’d not been able to leave behind, had been the black classic he drove.  A 1967 Chevy Impala, apparently.  Castiel didn’t know much about cars beyond making sure they turned on.  But he could see Dean
Thank god it was too cold for him to get an embarrassing stiffie.  Besides, he could barely feel his dick at this point.
That … that might actually work.  Castiel glanced at Dean and found the same grudging acceptance on the man’s face.  ”Why didn’t you tell us at the station?”
Castiel opened his mouth and shut it, frown deepening.  Finally, he murmured, “No.  You seem to, however.”
Thank God Dean held onto him because Castiel was no longer certain he had the power to remain upright.  He leaned into Dean, back arching as he trembled.  Dean’s hands skated warm and rough down his chest and abdomen, ghosting over his aching cock.  “Please,” he begged, his hips thrusting.  “Please, Dean!”
“Cas, ya’re not s’pposed to care,” he slurred.  He blinked rapidly, wrapping his fingers around Castiel’s wrist.  Eyes sliding shut, he turned his head, lips pressing against Castiel’s palm.  “I miss this skin,” he sighed.  “I’m . . . I’m not s’pposed to . . . but . . . I want to touch you again.”  He breathed out shakily.  “Fuck,” he groaned, “I want you so bad.”
?  Dean swallowed the revulsion he felt well up in his chest.  He couldn’t even imagine how it felt, at eighteen, to get cut down like that.  So brutal.  He drew up his legs, sitting cross-legged.  Elbows on his knees, he held his chin in his hands and mumbled, “What happened?”
Against Castiel’s demanding mouth, Dean muttered, “I’m clean now, dammit.”  He groaned when Castiel’s hand slid down from his shirtfront to palm the hot bulge between his legs.  ”
"Uh, yeah."  He pushed the door open and staggered, his shirt a sticky mess of blood and fabric.  "Um, about Crowley?  Looks like I didn’t move fast enough," he mumbled.  He blinked wildly and held up his other hand.  "Also, I’m going to pass out."
Gabriel grinned sharply, eyes hard.  “Good to know.”  He softened as he looked at Castiel.  “Go have fun, Cassie.”
Ah.  He’d heard the name but never had interacted with the director.  Probably a shortcoming on his part.  Castiel nodded, waving a hand for the man to come closer.  His debriefing, probably.  Great.  Insult to injury.  Or something like that.  Who cared; his side hurt and he wanted to punch someone.  Preferably Dean.
Shutting off the spray, he grabbed a clean towel and wrapped it around his hips, stepping out of the bathroom cautiously, expecting more taunts from that lovely bastard.
Every stinkin’ thing he admitted to his friend.  He's still a bit drunk and thankfully not working but he remembers it
He didn’t think it’d hurt that much to hear Castiel dismiss his worries like that.  He grabbed the catalog from Castiel, only to have the man snatch it back almost frantically.  “The hell it is!”  He leaned on the counter.  “You stood there and called me your
It’s why his auto body shop wasn’t national; the stress would have been too much.  But local and semi-regional?  Not so bad.  Having two other shops in nearby states with his name had become his badge of pride.  But any more than that, he’d probably lose his mind and his hair.
skeevy, which is really unfair.  He’s . . . oh, God; he’s gorgeous.  Tattoos.  Glasses.”  He waved trembling fingers in front of Balthazar.  “Tattoos!  I mean, who does that?”  Swallowing, he hurried on.  “I
“W-wait.  You . . . you should have my cell instead,” Castiel interrupted.  He dug out a faded receipt and scribbled his number on the back.  “I’m not in the office that much these days,” he lied.  Dean’s fingers were warm and firm when they took the crumpled paper.
he’d agreed to wait until the signing.  It unnerved him that Castiel refused to answer any texts from him or return any calls.  Stayed completely silent.  Dean didn’t
Benny sighed and turned around.  “All right.  This way.  It’s your only way in without getting’ your head clean taken off.”  He paused glancing between both Castiel and Dean.  “Crowley doesn’t use this garage but it still connects underground to his place.  Just watch yourselves.”
Castiel flicked him in the back of the head.  “Some of us have dry skin, Dean.”  He snickered.  “Why do I think that is why
Crooning and purring, Castiel shook off one of Dean’s hands, touching the same cheek he’d struck before.  “I love you,” he whispered.  “And . . . you needn’t love me back.  I just . . . I want you to know what I know.”  That realization hurt, though.  That Dean might
Castiel latched onto the subject change with relief.  “Oh, yes!  I’m making a lasagna for dinner.  I neglected to have anything on hand, however.  Do you like lasagna, Dean?”  He hadn’t meant to ask that.  He really hadn’t it.  But Dean’s green eyes were more a distraction than his smile and firm muscles.  Damn everything.  Castiel was completely smitten.
Castiel tried not to keep his eyes on the two cars heading their way but it was difficult.  Mainly because it gave him something else to focus on giving the rude, shit-eating grin plastered on Dean’s face.  He scowled at the thief and grumbled, “Is there something you need to say?”
To his dismay – and delight – he found a text message from Dean, inviting him to the bookstore to go over the actual setup for the signing on Monday.  No comment about his hasty escape.  Or the kiss.  Just a brief, though friendly, note.
Swallowing, Castiel still wouldn’t meet his eyes.  “I lied to you.  Why . . . why do you even care what I feel?”
Fuck, what was wrong with him?  Why couldn’t he just enjoy the physical like a normal person?  Take the commands like a normal sub?  Why’d his fucking head have to get involved all the time?  Bad things would follow.  They always did.  He shoved it all aside, looking up as the door knob turned.
“It’s . . . complicated,” he said finally.  It wasn’t as if he and Castiel were permanent.  He was just a fixer-upper for the guy.  After Dean was properly retrained, Castiel would be gone and Dean could find a Dom who’d make him . . . useful.  Or something.  Though, the idea of Castiel being gone left a sour churn in his stomach.
Benny looked over his shoulder, eyes landing on the gun.  “Never said that,” he mused.  “I only said he don’t use it any longer.”  He grinned.  “It’s still sealed off; gonna take some work to get past the block.”  He dug though his pants, coming up with a set of keys and a small USB stick.  “Takes these two keys; we’ll get through it.”  He turned away then, pushing and pulling harder at the busted door.
Castiel chuckled as he lifted the lid off a pot of pasta.  “Perhaps.  You seem to enjoy it as well,” he replied in return, eyes dark and sly.
Frustrated, Castiel snapped, “Why do you keep apologizing!”  He could feel the tears burning and beginning to spill.  He wiped at them angrily, stomping away from the door.  “I
Castiel could feel the earth opening up underneath him.  Ideally, he should slam the door and immediately see about moving but he’d given up at this point.  Strange how hearing the truth only brought a sense of sickening relief.  Instead, he pulled the door open further and stepped back, staring sightless at the wall.  “Might as well come in, then,” he muttered.
“Please, please!” he gasped, clawing at Dean’s shoulders.  The crest built like a tidal surge, threatening to choke to his air.  Dean’s hips slapped against his ass and he sobbed, biting down on Dean’s shoulder as his body shook with impending orgasm.  With a choked scream, he stiffened, teeth sinking deeper into Dean’s shoulder as he came, nearly breaking the skin in his frenzy.  In answer, Dean growled, gripping his ass tight and pumping into him, coming hard and fast.
Castiel tilted his head.  ”Why touch my forehead like that?  Isn’t there an apparatus that should be used to measure my internal temperature?”
Castiel covered his eyes for a moment.  “Forgive me.  I don’t mean it the way you think.”  He smiled, though clearly embarrassed.  “I would like to give you a massage.  You seem very tense.”
“Bal might turn your nuts into Christmas ornaments when he hears what you did,” Gabriel commented gleefully.  “Guy’s kind of a creep but Cassie’s his only living relative.”  He laughed then.  “Damn, should get that on film.”
The comment made no sense.  Castiel frowned, his fright lessening.  What on earth did he mean by that?  Mind spinning, he couldn’t formulate a clear enough thought.  Though it all swirled around him, confusing and frightening, he was almost certain he heard true sorrow in that man’s voice.  Dismay, regret, and a thousand other things that cut and wounded Castiel’s fairy soul.  And that terrible, spine-shaking urge to pull Dean to him.  Make it all disappear.
Castiel grinned faintly.  “Of course, sir.”  He hung up the call and scrolled through his phone, setting off the GPS.  He didn’t know how well it would reach out of the rock around him but give he’d been able to call out, he stood a good chance.  He tucked the phone away and reached for his gun, belatedly realizing Dean had stolen it.
Those wide, wonderful eyes.  Freckles that stood out on rapidly chilling skin.  Hair that was likely feather-soft when dry.  Even hunched as he was, Castiel could tell the man was tall.  Probably near Castiel’s height if not more.  Stocky and bowlegged.
Once seated, Balthazar folded his hands, leaning his chin on them as he glanced at the menu.  ”A man like you really shouldn’t be so tense, Agent,” he purred.
Castiel swallowed, reaching up to touch Dean’s lips with his fingers.  “Why, though?  I’ve lied to you.  So many times.”  He dropped his hand and his gaze.  “Balthazar warned me that he told you about Michael.  So you see, I’m not exactly a
“No, he’s . . . out.  Kind of like me.”  Dean stopped moving and folded his arms over his chest.  “He’s not . . . I mean, we’re not really a
Dean gripped the inside of his thigh, squeezing hard, imagining it Castiel’s hand on his cock.  He shut his eyes tight, horrified and turned on.  Fuck, what a
Castiel pressed his thumb into a particularly stubborn knot on his shoulder and Dean moaned softly, blushing at the noise.  “S-sorry,” he muttered.  He planted his face back into the couch cushion, hoping it hadn’t ruined things.
He was saved from an immediate answer by a knock on his door.  Trudging down the hall, he called out, “Who is it?”
had he been thinking telling Dean he was Gabriel?  That . . . that wasn’t even remotely close to reality.  He was barely
“I gave Michael and Azazel permission,” he pointed out.  Maybe.  He was beginning to wonder, in all honesty.  The longer he was around Castiel the more he realized things between he and his prior Doms were dubious at best.  Azazel had taken advantage of a young, immature kid.  Michael and just . . . taken advantage.  Though, Dean could have walked at any time.  He’d stayed.  So, maybe he liked it?  His stomach pitched at the idea and he swallowed, shoving that guilt and worry deep.
“Can we move on?” Crowley asked, clearly annoyed.  “I’m quite tired of dealing with this man and would like to get back to business as usual.”
but he refrained, singing softly instead.  He cut off with a squeak and blush when he caught Dean chuckling.
On the drive home, he tried to think of a plausible reason to contact Dean later in the afternoon.  It wouldn’t be unheard of for a publisher to meet with a bookseller over, say, dinner and drinks?  He winced, realizing how weak that sounded.
Castiel demanded.  Wanted such a stoic man to unwrap him and bare him to the world.  Leave him aching and screaming with pleasure.  And it
if he wanted to.  So, maybe, it was just Castiel he didn’t want?  If Dean truly didn’t want him, Castiel would walk away.  But while there was any chance the man cared for him but was merely
“I hope that’s all right,” he murmured, poking at his salad.  “It’s just . . . you’re more than welcome to handle the town’s setup but . . . I need to let the, er, powers that be handle the rest.”  He shoved a forkful of lettuce into his mouth and chewed, pointedly looking away from Dean in the process.
Brow furrowed, anger flared again in Castiel’s face but it lessened quickly.  Instead, fear stole the color from his face and his eyes turned dull.  The life in them gone so sudden, Dean took a step back in response.
His delight tempered when Dean’s hand squeezed his ass, thick fingers toying with his hole.  “Please,” he breathed.  “I’ve missed you.
After another minute or two of panic, he managed to compose himself and hurried on to the market.  He picked up his ingredients, the urge to buy sickeningly sweet treats brought on by his nervousness.  Any time he did anything that doubled his anxiety, it was all he could do
A short chapter; ideally, I should have tacked it on to the first chapter.  But anyway, SHENANIGANS.
Knowing that and knowing that Castiel probably dated men with more letters behind their name than the alphabet, Dean tucked his boyish crush to the back of his head and opted to just ogle the guy the few times he’d end up seeing him.  Because there was
