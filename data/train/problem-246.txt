They walked onwards for a few more minutes, and he took the time to admire the gleam in her eyes, long lost since her pregnancy and she had to stop working, unable to have seen it first hand, Sherlock in her most basic element, like watching an artist lift a brush, the promise of the crime scene left her moving gracefully, and he had the strongest urge to pull her into a nearby alley and have at it, to hell with the Work, but he couldn’t stop her, not now at least
Only a handful of chapters to go
This case, like so many others, led them into a sticky situation where both their lives were at stake. Nothing new, nothing he couldn’t handle
“I was so certain I could duplicate it!” She yelled for the third time, moving in quick, fast paces in front of her couch before dramatically dropping onto it, as if her bones became jelly and could no longer hold the weight of her massive intellect.
His fingers eagerly explored their fabric and a swell of pride filled his chest to feel how aroused she was becoming, before hooking to the band and pulling softly, hesitant and uncertain of how far she was willing to allow him
“Really uncle, must you insist on the use of nicknames no one actually enjoys?”
“It’s just Morning Sickness, it’ll pass” she huffed, standing tall once again and shoving her hands in her pockets, confident stance for someone who was turning a shade just darker than the body on the floor
“Lestrade has to stop calling us in for child’s play” she complained, flinging the cloth back at him and dramatically dropping onto the sofa, one foot held up in the air “my feet won’t recover from this”
Donovan shook her head, but even John could see the wheels turning it her mind as she handed back Junior
Because Sherlock bloody Holmes was NOT feeling him up for her own enjoyment, she certainly WASN’T trying to cover him in gooseflesh as his stubborn cock twitched with every light feel of nails
Sherlock traded her suit for a loose fit vest top with the UK flag faded on it, tiny black leather short shorts, and fishnet tights with boots that he swore she stole from a stripper, reaching up to her knees, making her look like she was in her mind 20s instead of thirties, crazy curly hair straightened into grungy waves of black, eyeliner smeared under her eyes and a fake nose ring shinnying on her nostril
After almost a minute of heavy breathing he pushed back once again, refusing to look at her as he stomped his way up the stairs and slammed the door shut behind him
The first time it happened, he was mortified
The adrenaline perhaps, or maybe she was just growing tired of this little dance.

“Who’s the father?!” Sally asked, complete shock written all over her face, gaping as if the fact someone actually wanted to be with Sherlock was completely ludicrous. If he hadn’t been so stunned himself, John would’ve found her reaction insulting
“Hardly” Sherlock smirked, turning back to the body lying across the ground, and proceeding to study the corpse
“God, no!” He sighed, defeated, falling back into his chair across from her and running his uninjured hand over his face in frustration
“Sheryl, please…”
“Yeah…yeah I’m fine…Sherlock…Sherlock!” he called, attempting to calm her down, but the second she left his sight his leg buckled and nearly gave out from under him
The toaster caught fire –SH
“You are already aware of what I am capable of, Dr. Watson” He said, turning to start walking away, his wrist twirling idly to swing his umbrella back and forth “Voicing such matters hardly seems necessary”
I'm never on here so hmu on my
His heart began to pound when her lips parted just slightly, the plump bottom flesh pulling away from a perfect cupid’s bow, a sliver of pink darting in between, a quick, subtle slide of her tongue to moisten her lips, and John’s eyes dropping to her mouth before flickering back up to meet her gaze, surprised to find she left her emotions completely bare, eyes giving away everything for once with no defensive glimmer in sight.
Naturally, he jumped at the chance to meet with the ‘Sherlock’ Mike went on about; happy to discuss living arrangements. At least, this way, he could stay in London. As long this Sherlock didn’t kill people, or had a habit of bring women (or men, whichever he preferred) home at odd hours, he was as good a flatmate as anyone in his book.
“You…you want to name him after me…?”
“You’ve been drinking” she half said, half groaned as her hands fisted tightly in his dirty jumper, feeling his teeth digging in in a way that both hurt and yet felt wonderful, excitement pooling in her stomach
“No” Sally’s voice was strong, having grown tougher in the years that’d passed, though her eyes held no glimpse of the hatred they once did when she looked at Sherlock
“You want a divorce?” the panic, though poorly hidden (stupid John, assuming he could hide anything from her) was so obvious in his tone that her heart wrenched
It started off small, a brush of the pad of his thumb over the polished silver, checking to see if it was there, and the slightly huffed sigh when he saw it was indeed
“Of course” Sherlock replied, eyes roaming judgmentally over the crowd of small children, all laughing and screaming and being so agonizingly ordinary at the first day of school
Normally it took a good triple murder to get her that happy
She glanced down at where he gestured, her eyes immediately falling to the small litter of scars on the crock of her elbow, if not for their location they’d look like nothing more than marks often left behind after a nasty case of the chicken pox
(I changed URLs again but I'm gonna stick with this one, at least for a lil longer, promise)
She waited patiently, rare enough, standing in the middle of the room by the body until she had everyone’s attention
Her lips were everywhere, his ears, jaw, neck, and all he could do was bite back a moan and grip her slender waist tightly in his hands
‘Engaged
Sherlock Holmes, the Sherlock Holmes, was rattled down to her bones
He held up his hand, stopping her, knowing full well what the man could have done to Sherlock while she was tied up, and nodded, seeing her point, “Alright” he said, “We’ll have to take it easy because of your injuries but I’ll do what I can”
It was like she wasn’t there, her mind far off and unaware of her surroundings, the glazed over eyes and emotionless expression torn his heart into little pieces
“Sherlock!” She repeated
John, as pissed off as he was, still made his way over to follow her, sticking by her side
Some things never change, and to anyone who didn’t know Sherlock the way he did, they’d assume she was one of them
Then the topic reached its destination, old friends catching up leading to a potential flatmate who apparently seemed to be just as awkward and difficult as he was
Sherlock didn’t move from where she had sprawled out across the bed, fingers pressed together under her chin, the sides of the pillow cradling her head, working like makeshift earplugs to drown out the happy mumblings of her family beyond the bedroom doors

John, we’re out of milk –SH
And Sherlock would never understand that
“Are you…are you playing match maker?” John asked, surprised
She leaned back in her seat, crossing her arms. Wasn’t what she was expecting, a personal question perhaps, something involving her love life, or lack there of, sexual history and such, but to bring up Donovan at a time like this…
She breathed out an annoyed sighed
She wore a mask of indifference as the soft kicking presumed, but she couldn’t stop the small smile that formed on the corners of her lips when John broke out into an astonished grin, like he’d never felt anything like it before, as if every time he felt it was for the first time, and he could never get tired of it
“The wire, tedious as it was to hide under this” she waved down at herself “Is fully functioning and in place. John has already arranged reservations and selected the seat closest to the subject without arousing suspicion. I will be joining him shortly.”

“Yeah, she is”
Sorry it's so short, I'll try to update again sooner rather than later, but I've been kinda busy running my online stores and shit to raise money since I'm gonna be moving soon (by soon I mean a year but never to early to start saving)
Guilt, she realized, was the main emotion of the month
(See the end of the chapter for
When she arrived at Baker St, she began unbuttoning her top, not bothering to announce her presences to someone who seemed indifferent to it
“Sherlock…” he breathed into the coarse hair tickling his nose, musky, and earthy, and just so SHERLOCK, a scent he never could find, the under layer hidden beneath her hair products and deodorant, pure and comforting and HOME
He settled against her, yawning softly. The tuffs of dark black hair and pale skin reminded John so much of Sherlock, and he covered his mouth with his free hand to choke back the sob that threatened to leave him
He blinked at that, and she could see all the assumptions and scenarios playing through his head, read it in the far off look in his eyes and the slight tension finding it’s way in his stance
His heart skipped a beat as he was carried away from Sherlock to be cleaned and immediately brought back, and Sherlock opened her arms to accept him graciously
That, said so casually with an air of indifference shook him more than if Mycroft had actually threatened him. Because he knew oh so well exactly what could happen if he so much as stepped out of whatever line Mycroft had drawn revolving his little sister
She sighed, and headed back into her room
“My cousin’s are hardly the most appropriate people, prone to gossip, they’d rather speak of others lives than their own”
“John” she breathed, and he could’ve come from the sound itself if he wasn’t careful
Chapter two has been updated to include a drawing of Sherlock in John's pants and a vest top, if anyone wanted to see it
for the Google Doc link
“Who was that?” John asked with a yawn, lingering just outside the kitchen in a loosely tied dressing gown
“It’s not going to disappear” she said, her accusing tone causing him to raise an questioning eyebrow at her, stopping his left thumb from twirling the ring while it rested on his armrest, his right hand lowering the book in it loosely to his lap
Adjusting her body slightly, she lifted, sinking back down and giving a groan at the feelings washing over her, repeating the action again and again; building a steady rhythm
John wasn’t sure Mycroft was talking to him anymore, or if he was just thinking out loud
But it seemed, that the risk was finally looking worth it.
He coughed into his hand in an attempt to hide it
“Okay, so let me get this straight”
“As many times as fucking necessary to get it through your stubborn head!” he yelled, his fists balling at his sides “You can’t keep doing that, Sherlock!”
“Sherlock” she corrected, making no move to step into the man’s embrace
“Oh, no…I…”
“Will you ever tell me about it?” John asked, speaking after almost an entire day of silence, finally getting to whatever was weighing on his mind and she looked up from her microscope, cocking a brow and waiting for him to clarify.
John drained his glass. “As it seems we’re doing confidences then yes, I love him, quite simply… always have.”
A hundred miles down the road, Sherlock still hadn’t said a word. John had found some fairly upbeat music to keep him going until he suddenly felt the tiredness hit him like a wall, so when he saw the sign for services, he pulled in for a coffee and to quickly check his messages. The surgery wasn’t very happy with him, which reminded him of the old days, but Rosie had behaved for Mrs Hudson and that was the main thing.
Sherlock groaned, “it’s bad enough with Mrs Hudson decking the halls; I don’t need you to start.”
Back at his own flat he surveyed his house plants. “Don’t even think about it,” he said menacingly. Their leaves trembled.
“Mrs Hudson why this incessant ringing? You could have just come up.”
John did as he was told, but the truth was that he neither felt nor looked at ease. How much of this was simply because he and Sherlock were not a well-matched pair and how much due to the range of complex emotions caused by the proximity to his friend (which was both too close for comfort and not close enough for waltzing), was hard to tell. But it was made significantly worse by the fact that John, the shorter of the two and the beginner, was leading while Sherlock, who was much more experienced, was totally unused to being led.
“John…” Sherlock breathed the name almost reverently, “you are still a conductor of light.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Mrs Hudson’s face fell, “it’s just a piece of fun, and that is something that is certainly in short supply around here.
There was no grand return, no reception committee. Just one of the British Government’s ubiquitous black Jaguars waiting on the tarmac at Brize Norton, complete with its anonymous driver, his courtesy transport to London. For two bits Sherlock would have stuck a finger up at the nearest surveillance camera and made his own way home. But he had no money, no phone and anyway he ached all over; the thought of hitching or being jostled on the train was untenable.
“That a yes then?”
“Visiting hours are between 1400- and 1800-hours Monday to Friday, I’m afraid you’ll have to come back tomorrow.”
“Don’t worry darling, it is just your git of a godfather interfering in daddy’s business, and daddy quite rightly has had enough” Turning to Sherlock, John said sharply “I will write my own poetry thank you very much, and the last person I would turn to for courtship advice is a self-confessed sociopath. Now look after Rosie for me”
“That’s not what people normally say”
Sherlock was pleased to see that the food was good but the portions not overlarge and began to relax. He generally despised small talk but found that John was easily the exception. He even managed to laugh at John’s story of the fight to the death on the dodgems he and his companions had indulged in earlier, in which John had emerged the victor and where they had all been subsequently banned for life from Wilvercombe’s funfair. He even managed to respond to John’s enquiries about his day, entertaining the doctor with descriptions of various clients.
“Today we move from I to we, Dinah, take this ring as a symbol of my decision to join my life with yours until death should part us.”
“Why not? She is a most intriguing woman, intelligent, beautiful, funny. A woman of great poise and courage, I find her excellent company. She is alone in London, her fiancé is out of town, why shouldn’t I spend time with her? I’m not doing any harm.”
“You believe the drawings are in some way connected with this?”
“There was someone once, I thought perhaps he was interested, that maybe he was making an approach, but I wasn’t ready, and then he denied it. Denied it a great deal in fact.”
Crowley’s face took on a self-satisfied expression, “I might be able to help you there.” He announced with great aplomb, “I’ll give you a clue.”
“He’s made a lot of changes.”
“John Watson’s has a fiancée? Oh, Sherly won’t like that, won’t like that at all… and what a fiancée! ”
Fortunately, Mrs Hudson was always pleased to see them, she popped the kettle on and insisted that John had time for a cup of tea while he was there. John went and sat down with Rosie in the sitting room where the six o’clock news was on the television.
“The door was on the latch Mrs Hudson, so I hope you don’t mind me coming straight in.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ve brought your washbag and a change of clothes.” Mary said, dropping the holdall and sitting down on the side of the bed unoccupied by Sherlock, “I’ll watch him for a bit, if you want to take a shower.”
“Really?” John moved his head so he could kiss Sherlock on the mouth. “Now where would be the fun in that?”
Getting the hang of it, Sherlock made a mental request for access to some interesting body parts from Bart’s and stirred again.
John stared at Sherlock and raised an inquisitive eyebrow; it wasn’t like the detective to be sensitive to the moment. The police officers quietened down, lamenting the loss of a free drink.
“Shut it!” John said sharply but Bill went on.
Moriarty looked up, “Ooo, snake, so easy to skin… Hello handsome, how kind of you to call.”
Despite the references to Billy Kincaid and Gavin, designed to give John the opposite impression, Sherlock does in fact know what a ‘best man’ is. There was a case a few years ago that concerned an impoverished peer, a Russian heiress and St George’s, Hanover Square.
“Do call me Dinah.” She insisted, “I was at home recovering from surgery. It was poor timing; our tour should have ended the week before but then an extra date was added, and we were not in the position to cancel.”
Mycroft sighed, “I have been aware of that since she first crossed Dr Watson’s path a year ago, though quite who she is has eluded me, despite the fact I put my best team on it. ”
“Wassup?” John mumbled as he lifted Rosie into her high chair. “Oh, don’t tell me you’re in court this morning? What happened last night? Lestrade said everything was fine”
“Do you think he meant it?” John asked after a moment.
) and discusses wedding dates with your landlady; the others crowd round, and you join in.
The only sour note was when Carlo, the butler, appeared carrying a small, rectangular box, wide but only a couple of inches deep.
“What are you doing?” Greg asked.
Kind regards
“Opposite side, with the Carters, Sophie and Steve, and little Archie.”
“But that was not what they had in mind at all; it seemed that Jo’s older sister was keen to foster the child, but her husband needed persuading… a financial incentive. It was difficult, my family had very little money, my uncle was still in possession of the title and Holderness Hall and the little capital that went with it. However, it was 1989 and the markets were beginning to recover from the crash two years earlier, I had made a few investments at the time and I was able to raise a sum which satisfied Reuben Hayes.
Sherlock led the way to the marriage room, where Mrs Hudson, Rosie, Molly and Simon were already seated listening to a string quartet. Of Sherlock’s parents there was no sign which John thought was probably understandable, there was no sign of the British Government either, which was not.
“Tell us something we don’t know,” Aziraphale replied, but Mycroft pursed his lips and looked thoughtful before repeating the words slowly under his breath.
“She asks too much of me,” Harry wails.
“I’m not being funny. I want more, if you do too, then let’s get married.”
“It was fun, teaching the dear boy how to enjoy himself, going to concerts and the like, now I suppose he has everything he wants at home. Such a shame, I had quite a number of excursions planned. Sherlock used to call it my bucket list.”
Sherlock gave a spectacular eye roll but Mrs Hudson carried on anyway. “Sherlock was just helping me stir my Christmas puddings and didn’t know what to wish for so I suggested a locked room murder, and here you are. That’s the fastest I’ve ever known a wish come true. Just wait till I tell Marie next door.”
“I don’t know, one of your colleagues might have found the bullet hole in the window frame,” Sherlock managed to combine the optimum degree of politeness and pessimism in his comment.
The Physick Garden, Royal College of Physicians, sometime in the summer
John started to gather his clothes in preparation for getting dressed. Sherlock watched appreciatively.
Sherlock didn’t need asking twice. “I’ve spent a lot of time in London, Sutherland & Co. on the Tottenham Court Road is something of an institution, it has been there since the 1900s. I hadn’t realised that it had changed hands. Looking at the records from Companies House, Sutherland & Co. seemed to have been in decline even before Thomas died but this escalated after his death. He left the business to his wife, but it seems her heart wasn’t in it and although she married James Windibank who was a buyer for the firm, he also lacked the business acumen to make a go of the place. Added to that, they did not own the property only the lease, which was due for renewal in 2004 and the Windibanks did not have the wherewithal to cover it. It was most fortuitous that Old Aunt Edna died and they came into the house in Lyon Place. Mrs Windibank sold up, below the asking price for a quick sale and they all moved into Lyon Place where we can assume they live quite comfortably on Miss Sutherland’s money. She certainly seems to be the only one with any form of income.
“Well I’ll be blowed.” Steve said in disbelief.
Sherlock went to speak but John had had enough, “I’ve never met him so I can’t be sure but from what I have heard last night and this morning I am pretty certain that Patrick Hilton was a lonely, unhappy man who only really came alive when he met and fell in love with Richard Cubitt, no wonder he wanted to die when he did. I get that, I really do, because when you died I felt the same. Now drink that up and let’s get out of here.”
When principalities plot...
Sherlock darted into the kitchen and reappeared swiftly with two glasses of scotch, John sat down and took the offered glass, he smelt it immediately, it was the
Crowley felt a little guilty at the deception and agreed to help Aziraphale plan his campaign, it was the least he could do.
“You know where you’re going,” Sherlock asked.
“He’s eight years old, it was cold, it was the middle of the night. I imagine they gave him a drink, hot chocolate or something similar laced with a sleeping tablet. It wouldn’t have taken much to keep him under until they got back to the Lodge, even if they did have to detour up the Lower Gill Moor.”
John thought to himself.
“Would it have killed you?”
Mary did not give Mycroft the satisfaction of acknowledging the implied threat in his comment, of course she was aware.
Much as I love him, for a world's only consulting detective Sherlock does seem to get a lot wrong.
“No, that’s Keynesian economics. You are in a place where coffee is required but the options for purchasing are few, therefore they can charge what they like, and make it as tasteless as they like, within reason.”
Sherlock, however, is inconsolable “She hurt herself on my watch - one minute she was chattering away to teddy, the next she’s in the kitchen with a bump the size of an egg. I don’t understand how she got out of her playpen”
“The honours?”
, magician and mentalist, married him too. His illusions had stunned the world, with their scale and complexity until in a tragic accident, his act and his life had been cut short when a gun had misfired and an illusion featuring a magic bullet had gone horribly wrong.
John wasn’t convinced, he’d never met Frieda or any of her crowd but it didn’t seem the kind of place a human rights lawyer would chose for her birthday bash.
The hunch of the shoulders was something of a giveaway, as were the faintly pink rimmed eyes and the callouses on the forefinger of the right hand but it was the tie that clinched it.
John noticed Sherlock’s eyes light up as Dinah walked towards him, breathtakingly beautiful in ice-blue lace. John nudged him forward to meet his bride, and they stood together, with Dinah’s p.a. who had escorted her in on her left.
With the truck’s raised suspension Sherlock realised he had a marvellous vantage point to view the surrounding landscape and said so. Sherlock instantly knew he had made a mistake; Steve it appeared was a man of few words, except when it came to the truck. After the complete low down on the truck’s spec from the 124mm suspension lift to the rocky terrain tyres specially imported from Italy, Sherlock soon knew more than he ever wanted to about customising a Land Rover.
Molly had had an enormous crush on Sherlock for years that was true, but ironically, the phone call from Sherringford was the final nail in its coffin.
“On the contrary, that was a necessity for a case, you know the details. Whatever my actions with Janine, they have no bearing on my relationship with Dinah.”
“Seriously?” John argued in disbelief “You seriously think that James Wilder is harmless?”
The soldier sat and watched the stranger and marvelled at his stillness, at his beauty and the way he had saved his life twice already; he thought he would be happy just to sit in the man’s presence for the rest of his life.
A detour.
Sherlock didn’t ask what he meant, “Some kind of highly concentrated opiate, possibly mixed with something else. Adaptable enough to be injected and also to appear as confectioners’ sugar.”
Meanwhile...
Lestrade laughed and Sherlock took that as his cue to leave to fetch his coat.
Sherlock scoffed a little, “You seem very sure?”
The mention of the police animated the Duke, who came to Dr Huxtable’s rescue by saying in a deep, sonorous voice which boomed out like a dinner-gong.
"Journeys end in lovers' meeting"
Crowley was rarely discombobulated, but after over two hundred years of visiting Aziraphale in his bookshop the change was making him quite giddy. He had never been so glad to be wearing shades.
“Baker Street is roughly over there.” Greg pointed in a northernly direction. “I don’t want to miss the fireworks.”
Greg tried to reach John on his mobile, but as he guessed John was at the surgery, so he left a series of voicemails with the name and telephone number of the tailor, and other frantic instructions. Greg did not contact Sherlock; he was in no mood to speak to a Holmes.
Back at his flat, Crowley started work on a scheme of his own. For six thousand years Crowley had been a firm believer in getting humans to do the donkey work for him, he fired the starting gun, and humanity did the rest. As a result, Crowley’s conditioned laziness made him look for a way to scupper Dr Watson’s wedding plans without having to put in too much donkey work himself, the answer was glaringly obvious and required the co-operation, voluntary or not, of the third point on the love triangle. Mary Morstan, the bride to be.
“John! It was the gardener…” Grabbing his husband by the hand “Come on John, we’ve a killer to apprehend”
The two men retraced their steps back to the main building, the cloisters were well lit, and the lights shone down from the occupied rooms around the quad but Sherlock was aware of the darkness closing in just beyond the school walls, however further delay was intolerable.
“Not your brother.” John noted Greg’s uneasiness and didn’t blame him.
“Yes”
******
“Seriously?” Lestrade looked dubious. “But the lock was all blocked up with rust.”
Shortly after Sherlock’s suicide Dr John Watson made an appearance at the City of London Magistrates Court where he pleaded guilty to assaulting a police officer contrary to section 89 of the Police Act 1996 and was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment suspended for two years and ordered to carry out two hundred hours community service.
Sherlock explained again about the client, and his suspicions.
“Seven” Sherlock answered indignantly, “I finish work at seven.”
It took three trips for John, Rosie and the various accoutrements that accompanied a small child everywhere to get upstairs, John’s things to his room and Rosie’s to the nursery. But finally they got to sit down with a cup of tea, Sherlock in his chair and John in his with Rosie in her playpen between them. Sherlock had to admit Mark had done a good job on the flat, there were lights on the mantle, tinsel on the bison and the replacement skull was sporting a Santa hat. There was holly and ivy and even mistletoe, everything tasteful and understated, just about the limit to what he and John could tolerate, and for the first time Sherlock saw the point of Christmas.
John is investigating a mystery. Over the past few days a number of items have gone walkabout from 221B. So much was destroyed either by fire or water that it is hard to keep tabs on everything but he knows the replacement Union Jack cushion is missing. This morning, after he caught two of Mycroft’s gofers dismantling Sherlock’s bedroom, John decided he needed to discover what’s going on.
“He is with his mother, and the Family Liaison Officer. He is as well as can be expected, there will be some trauma to deal with no doubt, but he is young, and we will do everything in our power to help him to recover.”
Sherlock had fed and washed Rosie, she had had a story and played with Teddy, she had had another story and examined a tiny piece of Teddy’s fur under the microscope. She had tried to steal Sherlock’s phone and cried loudly when denied it. Finally Sherlock had given in and had sat her down in front of Peppa Pig for the sake of peace and quiet. Really she could do with a walk, but he was reluctant to leave the flat and miss John’s return.
******
“You didn’t have to kill her!” John shouts angrily.
John moved till he was standing quite close to Sherlock, close enough to touch. “Seal with a kiss?”
“I did dear, twice but you were dead to the world. I can’t keep running up and down those stairs, not with my hip. I need your help.”
Crowley was adamant.
“I have the reputation of my school to think of, and there is still the matter of the missing science master, what part, if any, he played in this.”
John burst out laughing, Sherlock scowled, and dropped his hands. John looked shame faced and apologised.
“I’m afraid I must leave you young people to it. No don’t think you have to come with me, it’s only just gone nine. I have two weddings one after the other tomorrow and I really need to check the paperwork is in the right order, I live in dread that one day someone will go home with the wrong bride.”
“Maybe he didn’t before,” Mary replied, “But it would appear he does now. Who do you think he’s talking to on the phone in there?”
Crowley nodded his encouragement but deep down he couldn’t help being sceptical.
“It is just the job for you. You are tall, slim, stylish, marvellous cheekbones…” Aziraphale felt his face grow hot and stopped talking abruptly.
Anything to avoid being bored.
He hadn’t seen Mycroft since the day Mummy had verbally eviscerated her eldest son, completing his humiliation by calling Sherlock the ‘grown up’ while his father had sat, damp eyed, silently agreeing with everything she said. And now they were supposed to play happy families at lunch together before the parents went off to America for Christmas.
“Don’t worry, we’ll have you back in the Smoke within a week” the Chief Constable assured Greg, slapping him on the back. “I am sure your fiancée is more than capable of tying up the loose ends while you’re away. From my experience, us men only get in the way of the organising.”
Immediately his beloved pulled John into his arms and kissed him firmly on the mouth.
“For a supposedly major Christian festival it seems to have absorbed a significant number of pagan saturnalia such as kissing under the mistletoe. Which is a rather odd association for an obligate hemiparasitic plant in the order of Santalales. The tradition is Greek…”
“The paramedic stated the bullet that hit Patrick was still lodged in the brain.”
“It’s up to you but if you’ll take my advice, you’ll wait for Dr Watson to come to you.”
Sherlock had spent the day oscillating between the two most recent crime scenes in Battersea and Camberwell until suddenly, at four o’clock he had sent two texts to an anonymous number and received a hand delivered note via one of his homeless network before haring off to a show down with a serial killer on Clapham Common.
The night wore on, drink was taken, the food eaten, Sherlock decided that poppy seed cake was grossly overrated.
Back home, Sherlock disposes of the liver in the microwave and the spleen in the fridge; he isn’t tidying, just keeping busy.
Three months, six days and seventeen hours and John Watson is finally on leave.
“Better”
“What?”
Rosie seemed much happier now she was downstairs and part of the action. Sherlock sat down on the couch with Rosie on his lap, and she nestled into him, eyes beginning to droop. John, once he had taken something from one of the bags under the tree came and sat with them. He insinuated an arm around Sherlock’s back and gently, so not to disturb Rosie drew him closer, leaving his left hand free to turn the pages of the book he was holding. It was an illustrated copy of
Sherlock snarled and postured when Mycroft gave him the Underground case but inwardly he acknowledged that nothing would help him restore some semblance of normality to his life more than The Work.
Her own flat suffered only minimum damage. The windows were blown out and the ceilings have had to be replastered and oh… the dust! However, not unlike Martha Hudson, these buildings were built to last. If they survived the Blitz, they could survive any old patience bomb or whatyoucallit that Sherlock’s psychotic sister could throw at them.
“Well, you would,” John muttered to himself, jogging a little to keep up.
“And the others, the scraps I found”
Not anymore.
“I am afraid Miss Sutherland, you must acknowledge the whole thing was a fraud, and forget that a person called Ian B Moody ever entered your life.”
“Shall we go?”, John turned to the waiter and indicated for the bill, which he insisted on paying, saying, “You’re still out of pocket for sending Mary Sutherland home.”
It would perhaps have been tolerable if John had been intending to stay close to Baker Street, but he was adamant he could not afford to rent in central London.  Sherlock had duly increased his private cases in order to maximise his earnings, but John was far too independent (proud) to accept financial help from his friend. Sherlock was also convinced that Mary had had money, her globetrotting adventures indicated this beyond doubt, but where she had squirrelled it away was a mystery. Even Mycroft had been unable to track it down.
“Because I wanted to, always have, still do”
“This is going to be so much fun!” Smith says as he introduces Sherlock to his daughter Faith. Sherlock recoils, reality splits, a scalpel is drawn, a fight ensues and John does Smith’s dirty work for him.
Sherringford - The Governor's Office
The pursuit almost ends in disaster, the warehouse floor is rotten, the lift shaft unsafe, it’s only when the back-up forces arrive that they are out of danger.
Rosie went down quickly and was asleep by the time their Chinese arrived. Sherlock had built up the fire and the room was warm and cosy. John poured himself a beer and then served up their food leaving Sherlock in charge of the DVD. Sherlock settled in his chair, while John opted for the couch for a better view of the television. He saw Sherlock was toying with his food but noted that some was being eaten so said nothing.
John supposed that Sherlock might have started smoking again, perhaps the prospect of his wedding night was making him nervous. John quickly shook his head to banish that thought, it was not an image he wanted to conjure with. As he did so, a different image flashed into his head. Sherlock had a very smart vintage Dupont lighter, he had had it for years, gift from a grateful client. John could swear he had seen that lighter on Sherlock’s desk when they had left Baker Street earlier.
Although these days John rarely struggles for survival in the sands of Afghanistan, his sub-conscious often takes him back to Bart’s, or Sherrinford, as he is forced to watch, without reprieve, his friend sacrifice his life for others.
Sweeping the uneaten breakfast and the scraps of paper into the bin he made his way out of Baker Street. Hailing a taxi he wondered if he should broach the subject of John’s poems with Molly. She was somewhat more knowledgeable in the affairs of the heart than he. But once he was in the cab he decided against this course of action, John was a very private man, and the repercussions of discussing his love life with Molly would be dire, far worse than any skipped meal.
“I think I will, I have nothing else on at present, and it is so difficult not smoking. It would give me a change of scene; I would have to stay over.”
John waited a good fifteen minutes for Greg to come to the phone, but the faint hope that the officer was not in fact in the hotel but rather on the overnight train to Euston was dissipated by the sound of Greg’s voice. If John had thought that he was down, then Greg was a whole new ball game.
Having  beaten the machine to the jackpot twice, Sherlock became aware of the increasingly hostile stare of the Pool Hall owner on him and, deciding there was nothing to be learnt from the soldiers that was worth risking an altercation for, Sherlock gathered up his winnings and left.
Sherlock disagreed. “No more than the next ten years I would have thought.”
The third man, also a soldier and a medic, Sherlock presumed that much, had obviously used the interval to wander down the promenade towards the pier and seemed reluctant to return, resulting in his friends becoming that more determined to make him, shouting his name in the street and threatening to tell someone called Lucy that he’d ‘chickened out’.
Crowley, the terror of traffic wardens faced defeat, there was only one thing he could think of it.
“Passable.”
Another trip to Accident and Emergency and a Marriage Proposal of a sort
Sherlock gave a start and put down his mug of tea with a bump. “I need to speak to Dinah.”
Sherlock tried again, unsuccessfully.
Sherlock obviously expected John to agree, and seemed put out when his friend said nothing, so he continued.
“We need to get out.”
“The electricity is off,” Sherlock’s voice emerged out of the gloom. “So is the Wi-Fi and I can’t charge my phone.”
John dressed quickly and efficiently, although not altogether comfortably, then leaned over and kissed Sherlock briefly on the lips.
“HQ.”  Crowley shouted without looking back.
“Is that a recent change?”
“I have discovered that this was part of a plot by James and his Uncle Reuben Hayes to extort money from my wife, the Duchess. They spirited away the boy and made a demand for a considerable yet not impossible sum of money from me, or rather from Arthur’s mother to guarantee the safe return of our son. They already had a bank account set up in the Cayman Islands for the very purpose. My wife, as you see was distraught and came rushing back to England to deal with the kidnappers, not knowing whom they might be. But I had a strong suspicion that James was behind the abduction. He wanted money, and with my wife and I in the early stages of divorce proceedings James knew there was even less chance that he would benefit from any endowment from me. But from his perspective Natasha had more than enough to spare, the demand was a mere drop in the ocean to her. He told me so when I confronted him with my suspicions.

Where did that leave him, he wasn’t cut out for single parenthood, hell he wasn’t entirely sure he was cut out for any kind of parenthood.
“No, I guess not. Quite the opposite, in fact, in the past.”
“Really?” Aziraphale’s eyes lit up and he smiled, but almost immediately his face fell again, “You would hate it, it isn’t the kind of music you like, your be-bop.”
Kind regards
The bathroom although not large was also blessed with two doors, and John pulled the second one open expecting to find an airing cupboard. What he found instead took his breath away and again he found tears threatening to fall, for behind the door was a perfect child’s bedroom, decked out in mint and cream and neatly furnished with a cot, a little chest of drawers and a night stand. Round the walls ran a frieze of Noah's Ark.
Sherlock reluctantly confessed that he had not done anything as mundane as to google Patrick so John busied himself at the laptop while Sherlock turned his attention back to the conundrum of the figures on the black board.
John decided he was hallucinating as the hoody of the second man fell back revealing the dark curls and gaunt features of Sherlock Holmes, running so fast that he was practically tripping over his own  feet and so that when he reached John he had to grab him by the arms to avoid crashing into him.
“A new case then, good to be busy. So how can I help? Is it something medical?”
“Ah, yes, Watson, of course.”
For an instant, Mycroft dropped his guard. “Sherlock, methought I was enamour'd of an ass.”
Sherlock rang off and went to have shower, then dressed in the clothes he had brought with him in expectation of this event – jeans, t-shirt, hoodie and trainers. He noted that the jeans, which predated his fall were, despite the recent efforts of Mrs Hudson, still too large round the waist and had to be secured with his belt. He topped the ensemble with a waterproof jacket but decided against taking John’s gun which he locked in his suitcase. He pocketed his phone and a few other requisites for a morning’s detecting and made his way outside.
The email contained an attachment of a child’s drawing and notification that unless he heard differently the sender would be with Sherlock by eleven the next morning.
Mrs Hudson was cooking up a storm; there was pastry and baking tins all over the kitchen. She had called Sherlock down twice already, once to take the lid off a jar of cloves, and then again to ask if he had any icing sugar. Now she needed him to run to Tesco’s.
A few days later - Leinster Gardens
“So,” Crowley asked, hopefully, “what else is on your list?”
John shuddered again. Sherlock squeezed his arm and went on.
Again thanks to Ariane DeVere for hints on the dialogue
“Up until now,” Mr Cheekbones replies.
most common surname in the world at present, while the name Dinah is somewhat out of favour these days, I imagine there are a number of Dinah Shepherds in existence.”
“For someone who was swearing undying devotion four hours ago she has made a very quick recovery,” John observed after they had gone. “Did you know that was going to happen?”
Sherlock offered him a seat, and John, who was curious about the client, while wondering if there would be time for the dancing lessons to continue that morning, sat in the chair he still regarded as his own.
Sherlock gave Lestrade a squinty eyed look as  a result of this speech, and even John could tell it had the air of a press release.
Aziraphale made a despairing sound, “I was supposed to bring them together not drive a wedge between them, and now my poor boy is in even more of a pickle than before. It is far worse than when the Adler person was playing her mind games, and even when Moriarty was at his zenith.”
“What?”
Sherlock pointed at the tyre tracks at his feet. “They’ve not been here since the Spring; the ground is still wet.”
“We’ve had a discussion,” Sally announced, “and we have decided that as officially we are off the clock at ten, and as you missed out on a stag do being sent on this wild goose chase and as we are stuck here for at least a couple more days and there is nothing anyone can do about that, we thought you could have your stag do here, complete with stags” She waved her hand in the general direction of the mounted heads on the wall. “so, this is what we are going to do, you are going to get yourself on the outside of the full Scottish, complete with Lorne sausage and haggis, plus a nip of whiskey on your porridge.
The moment Sherlock stepped into 221b he knew something was different. He shrugged off his coat and placed it on the hook and went through to the sitting room. The chairs were pushed pack and the rug rolled up, and Mrs Hudson’s iPod was playing softly. John was dressed in a familiar plaid shirt that brought out the blue of his eyes, and his smartest trousers, freshly showered and shaved, looking more handsome that Sherlock could believe. He held out his arms to Sherlock and smiled.
Mr and Mrs Holmes kindly suggested Martha and Rosie might like to go home with them after the wedding and Mrs Hudson agreed thinking it would be nice for her ‘married ones’ to have Baker Street to themselves for a few days.
“Did you…”
******
“Hoch,” Dinah said immediately, under her breath, though Sherlock was close enough to hear her.
Mr King said there was and under his direction a constable went off to move the cars. Once this was accomplished Mr King set off, although it was only just gone five, saying that like all farmers the Elriges were early risers and would be up and about once he got there.
Sherlock ended with a flourish and took another pastry from John’s plate.
John had questions, Mycroft Holmes answered them succinctly and without sugaring the pill. He gave John a brief resumé of Mary Morstan’s career to date, without revealing her real name or her present whereabouts.
Honestly, you would think that today of all days, they’d put a sock in it, especially with the genuine domestic drama being quietly played out in the sitting room.
Take a life full of consequence, and life of interminable drudgery, add a life threatening addiction to danger and lifelong aversion to boredom and eventually you’ll end up with one death too many.
John who had lived with Sherlock for two years, knew that this was not in fact true. Sherlock did fall asleep, often through exhaustion, during cases, however this was not likely to be one of those occasions.
He poured himself a scotch and wandered around the flat. Now that he knew that Mary was gone it was apparent that her things were missing. He was amazed at what appeared to have been the calm efficiency of her packing. Everything appeared to have gone, from her box of tampons in the bathroom cabinet to the half-read paperback on the bedside table. Books, clothes, toiletries, shoes, all gone.
******
“You’re welcome.”
“Why would I be anything else… despite our differences I considered your life was still too precious to be forfeited if I had the power to prevent it. Sherlock was far better equipped to deal with the likes of Dinah Shepherd.
Some months later.
“I would prefer to start immediately, if you could direct me to Dr Watson’s rooms.”
Sherlock would have claimed that he knew London like the back of his hand. Since his return from his exile, he had made it his business to reacquaint himself with the city, and the changes that had happened while he was away. Even so, Sherlock became aware that he was unfamiliar with this part of town; he wondered if Mr Fell’s mystery might have more sinister overtones, and if he should have brought John after all.
“Well it is thanks to you that we have a true picture of what happened here tonight, in all its tragic detail. Will you be going back to London right away? Only there will be a matter of statements.”
John caught Simon asked him, “Could you see that Mrs Hudson and Rosie get home? I have a feeling we are going to be here for some time.”
******
“We’re going surfing?” John said in disbelief, it was hardly the weather and neither of them were appropriately dressed, but who knew what this mad creature would think of next.
“Two days ago there was a note from Eddie left for me at Elrige’s, saying to come at one this morning while the husband was asleep and he would meet me at the end window, which I did. It wasn’t what I expected, Eddie even offered me money to go away, which made me mad and I caught at him through the window, meaning to pull him outside. Just as I was struggling with Eddie the husband rushed in with his revolver in his hand. Eddie had lost his balance and was on the floor leaving the two of us face to face. I drew Elrige’s gun, more to scare him off so I could get away. But he ﬁred and missed me, and I fired at almost the same instant and it hit home. I made away across the garden, and as I went I glanced behind me and saw Eddie shut the window, yet now you say he’s gravely ill?”
John paused, he was panting slightly, he had meant it, this heart to heart stuff was exhausting. He finally looked at Sherlock, the detective was looking dazed but on reflection John had seen him worse. Then he smiled, his genuine, just for John smile.
“Lots of things are intangible; it doesn’t make them less real, courage for example, hope or… love”
“What? When? Is it my heart?”
Sherlock shrugged, “You’re not here to contact your father?”
Mycroft followed Lestrade’s line of vision, “or the controlled explosion!”
"Yes, Mr Windibank is my stepfather,” Mary replied to Sherlock’s questions now without sounding surprised. “I cannot bring myself to call him father, as he is only five years and two months older than myself."
“Remember, Mary Morstan is no saint,” Moriarty called after him.
“John…” Sherlock whispered, but he too made no attempt to move.
“There’s a train to Norwich from Liverpool Street at eleven-thirty tonight which if we left now we could probably catch, the problem is that there’s no connection to take us to North Walsham until five-thirty tomorrow morning. We would need to hire a car once we got there, and I’m not sure how practical that would be at one-thirty in the morning otherwise we end up hanging around the station for four hours in the middle of the night. If we are going to have to hire a car it would make sense to hire one here and drive the whole way. It shouldn’t take more than” John consulted his phone again “three hours at the most, this time on a Sunday night.”
“John!” A scrawny darker man in a hoody, called his name before running and overtaking the first boy.
“I had become so bound up with Moriarty that I had forgotten.” Sherlock said.
“What don’t you understand? How service stations can charge over four quid for a cup of luke warm milky froth and call it coffee?”
“Mummy?”
******
“I have already tried that, Crowley, but to no avail. I fear that Ms Morstan is cleverer than Dr Watson’s usual choice of girlfriend, and rather than giving him a hard time for going on cases she tends to join them. As a result, there is very little opportunity for Sherlock to spend time with his friend alone, and at the end of the day it is Dr Watson and Mary Morstan who go home together.
“I’m not crashing; I can’t help it if I’m there having a farewell drink with my baby brother."
“Why so?”
Greg looked shocked, “What? Dinah is a tour de force, John, you don’t stand in her way, when she wants something she just goes right on and gets it. I just can’t believe that she’s settling for me.”
“He’s the reason my poor Sherlock is in the pickle he’s in.” Aziraphale sounded almost tetchy.
******
You say nothing, to no-one, because what would destroy you, what would finish what Moriarty began and the Serbians continued, would be for anyone to know your secret.
“It really is a lovely room; we like to think of it as our Honeymoon Suite. It has an en suite, and a mini bar, tea and coffee making facilities, even a trouser press, and the most beautiful view of the Valley in the hotel…”
The phone started up again, Sherlock sighed, his own fault for putting the wretched thing on charge when he had got in yesterday evening. Reluctantly Sherlock opened his eyes, blinked, and surveyed his surroundings. The recently refurbished Baker Street sitting room, complete with the furniture with rounded edges designed to accommodate a small child who seldom visited still took him by surprise every time. He supposed eventually he would get used to it. He might even start to clutter the place up again, not point preserving its pristine state for an event that would never happen.
Sherlock looked again at the map, utterly convinced that the key to John’s disappearance, and the boy’s lay on the Holderness estate. However, he could not test that theory until morning, until then he would continue his investigations online.
“Sherlock and I were supposed to dine at the Savoy that evening, but all I got was a curt little text saying he was indisposed and not a word since. He is not answering the door or returning my calls. I have spoken to Mrs Hudson, that is his landlady, all she can tell me is that he is playing sad music and letting his tea get cold. I am at my wit’s end.”
There was no road to speak of, not even bare patches of earth or ruts to indicate where vehicles might have traversed the moors before. Steve explained again, “the Duke doesn’t permit green lane driving.”
Sherlock went first. “Dinah, the moment I met you, I knew you were the only woman I could ever marry; I promise to be the man that I see now in your eyes, today, tomorrow, and for always.
Dinah was marvellously unfazed by his news, though what she threatened to do to the Chief Constable if he didn’t get back on time was gratifying. His most pressing concern, after abandoning his fiancée for a week, was John’s suit, but Dinah said she would sort everything with the tailor.
On the plus side there were six of one kind which by rights should represent E, and four of another which should in theory be T, or possibly A, but the frequency of letters could be thrown out by irregularities such as proper nouns; and what were those little boxes about? Sherlock scowled at the print outs of the two photographs, despite the second message, he still didn’t have enough data.
Back at Baker Street, John gently carried Rosie up the stairs and placed her in the ‘big girl’s bed’ that had been introduced to her room a few months before. John still felt the occasional pang as he placed his sleeping daughter in it, although he noticed today that it did not seem quite so big for her as it had when they first bought it.
She was brought back from her musing by the sound of Antonia sneezing loudly and then doing something with her handkerchief. Mary immediately thought it might be signal but there didn’t seem to be any response. When she looked Antonia’s way again, the woman was dabbing her eyes.
The officer hesitated so Sherlock continued, “Will it help you know that my name is Sherlock Holmes and this is my friend and associate Dr John Watson, Richard Hilton-Cubitt was a client of mine and we have travelled here tonight in the hope of preventing what I suspect has occurred.”
“You do know what that entails?”
Re: New message
Sherlock cannot compute, he blinks rapidly, his face hot; there was more to the dream than taking John’s pulse. He has to ask.
John ignored Sherlock’s final comment. “But it must have taken them hours. Where was Arthur all that time?”
“That was the most ridiculous thing I have ever done,” the soldier said.
, Lestrade thought as he walked up the path to the rendezvous point to meet Donovan,
“He is not one of us, but he has done a bit of work for our side in the past, a lot of work in fact and I rather think we owe him a return favour.
But Sherlock cannot remember and with the rising waters Redbeard is lost to him, though the body that is recovered is John’s.
John felt uncomfortable, and started to apologise for the lack of contact but Sherlock shut him up, unconsciously echoing Mrs Hudson, “Well you are here now.”
“I don’t anticipate leaving the flat, unless I am called upon for a case.” He said after a while, “However I believe that will be unlikely as Hopkins is still tying up the loose ends of the Chigwell corpse and Lestrade is off duty tonight and is intending to spend the evening in the pub…ah I see. He has requested your company.”
“Everything all right between you?” Lestrade ventured to ask.
“Trust Sherlock to get the wrong end of the stick…, still a Christmas wedding, I’m happy for them.”
“Miss Sutherland,” John began, “Mr Holmes has looked into the disappearance of your fiancé Ian Moody and come to a different conclusion. Perhaps you had better sit down.”
Dr Huxtable took out his own mobile phone, an antiquated Nokia, peered at it and dialled, a brief conversation ensued, and it appeared there had indeed been a letter.
This was followed some twelve months later with the announcement in
“My phone,” answered the soldier, “it belonged to my sister and is the most valuable thing I own.” So, the stranger took the phone, read the inscription, put it in his pocket and then grabbed the soldier by the hand and led him out of the room. Together they shinned down drainpipes, scrambled across roof tops, and scuttled along alleyways until they came to the stronghold of a fabulously wealthy Duke who had once called the stranger a ‘freak’. The stranger picked the locks while John overpowered the guards, then they went in and helped themselves to as much gold as they could fit in a barrow that they stole from a shed for the purpose.
, and then the line went dead.
“I thought it wise…”
“Well… you know.”
“Not far. I asked the receptionist where the best place to eat in Wilvercombe, she said the restaurant of the Hotel Resplendent, so I’ve booked at table there.”
******
“Would you notice if it had been moved?”
The incredulity of Sherlock’s expression and threat of the blinking starting up again, prompted John to answer quickly.
“What reasons?”
“I need your help.”
Mary swung round, but she had left her handbag where she dropped it when she had been handed the bouquet, even now she could see Antonia had picked it up and was holding it. She could still try to make a run for it, but at the back of the shop she was the furthest from the door and no doubt Mycroft had the place covered. Anyway, she was wise enough to know when her cover was well and truly blown.
“We are all going to die sooner or later, in your case it will be sooner because you won’t see a doctor. If you want to avoid dying for as long as possible, I suggest you make an appointment for the moment you get home.” Sherlock heard a noise and looked up, “Although, as it happens you are in luck. Here comes a doctor now.”
“I may not have known him very long, I won’t ask how you know that… but I knew from the first time we corresponded that Ian was a good, kind person and more than that he was my soulmate, we were destined to be together and besides…” Here Mary lowered her voice and became conspiratorial, “he contacted me on the morning of the wedding and implored me to swear that I would always be true to him; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was promised to him, and that he would claim his promise sooner or later. It seemed a strange thing for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since makes me think he had a premonition that something would happen to prevent our marriage.”
******
The celebrant took them aside to sign the register, while the string quartet knocked out something that sounded a little like Mozart. John signed his name beneath Sherlock’s as witness, and the p.a did the same. The signature was unreadable, and John still didn’t know the man’s name.
“Oh John, and Rosie too, how lovely. Come in do.” she added, hip forgotten, as she stooped to pluck Rosie from her pushchair so John could fold it up. “I’m afraid you’ve just missed Sherlock, he went out in a tizz about half an hour ago… I’ll put the kettle on and you can tell me everything you’ve been up to while you wait for him.”
(Immediately after chapter 27 and referencing chapter 1)
The soldier thought for a moment, as he had very little of value that hadn’t already been sold by Harry to fund her drinking habit. “My dog tags,” he said at last. The stranger took the dog tags, and then he said.
He made his peace Mrs Hudson, narrowly avoided being brained by a saucepan and received a tearful hug which was just as painful. He spent time with Lestrade, Molly, his parents and even Philip Anderson. He allowed Mycroft to orchestrate the official announcement of his resurrection and waited patiently in his old chair in Baker Street for John to arrive.
Alice greeted Sherlock and John warmly in notable contrast to her reception of the Inspector. She showed Sherlock and Somersby into a small study with a desk and a computer, but John, as he had been primed by Sherlock followed Alice into the kitchen.
“Of course, we couldn’t risk a genuine celebrant. He was desperate for the role; you know how he loves dressing up. He wanted a beard, but I thought it might remind you of his Captain Birdseye.”
John tries to argue “Moriarty’s back. We have a case! We have a real-life problem right now”
“Actually, Mrs Hudson, would you mind looking after Stefan for me while I go and see Sherlock. I can hear that he’s in.”
Greg came back from the bar with their drinks and took a long draft. John licked his lips, took a deep breath and launched.
The cabin the
They continued what they had practiced before until Sherlock was satisfied John was more or less keeping up.
“I will.”
“Who did assist your husband for that performance?” Sherlock continued.
Sherlock reserves a special level of acrimony for his older brother, and delights in displaying it to great effect, though in truth he is more annoyed with himself at getting caught than with his brother for incarcerating him, and that is saying something.
As if on cue a thin wail emerged from the baby monitor – John scowled
Sherlock changed into his own pyjamas, settled a cushion behind his head and lay down on John’s sofa with the blanket over his knees.  He fired up John’s laptop to check his emails, he still had the matter of the Ferrers Documents to work on, and he was monitoring the progress of the Abergavenny murder trial. He sent a couple of texts to Lestrade and an email to the barrister who was handling the Abergavenny defence. But worn out not only by the case, but also by reliving his exile, after an hour or so he turned out the light and slept.
“Holmes? Did you say Holmes?”
“It was taking your advice that got me in this mess in the first place.” Sherlock snapped back. “Now, where is it?”
None came, instead Sherlock put on his widest smile, opened his arms, and said.
“It’s ok, you don’t have to say anything.”
John can’t articulate the reason, the instantaneous connection between two souls, ridiculous really but unforgettable.
A vow once broken can never be repaired.
“Perhaps I should give up. Let human nature run its course, not try to alter the future.”
), Should I invest in Northern Rock? (
John is exasperated with his friend, the idiot.
“How do you know that?”
“Mr Holmes?”
“Of course, you will, one for all and all for one.” Sherlock looked blank, “Never mind, here’s our cab.”
Sherlock looked again out of the study windows, the stormy sky and the inhospitable moor in the distance. “Perhaps you won’t have to.”
“No, I suppose not…” Steve answered slowly, unsure what Sherlock was getting at, but Danny cottoned on immediately.
“Very well, I will continue to work on the messages I think it is very likely that I will be able to contact you shortly to throw some light upon your case.”
Antonia kept her covered, while Mr Fell locked the shop, and Mycroft Holmes addressed her like a public meeting.
It suddenly occurred to Sherlock what was off with the messages, if they were meant for Patrick Hilton-Cubitt, then surely one of the words must be his name. But the only seven letter word repeated one of the characters, and the name Patrick had no repetitions. Was he ever known as Pat or may be Paddy? He made a mental note to find out.
“Cut that,” John laughed, “tell me something you can’t know.”
Sherlock had absolutely no intention of doing any such thing, but nodded anyway, distracted by the sights and sounds of the school… John’s home.
“So I was thinking what if we come over tomorrow afternoon and bring what we need with us, we could stay for a few days” John sounded uncertain, not of the request, Sherlock deduced, but of its reception.
Sherlock looked at his feet for a long time, as if he had never seen feet before. When still he didn’t answer Molly urged him, “Phone them Sherlock, or go and see them. Love is precious and life is short.”

and John with Rosie, arms outstretched coming forward to greet her Papa.
Take a woman with too much to hide, another with nothing to lose, add a man who will outlive God trying to have the last word and you have the all the ingredients for a tragedy.
“You have his photograph!” Sherlock exclaimed.
John reluctantly extricated himself from Sherlock’s tentacle hold and slipped on his pyjamas and dressing gown went to see to his daughter.
Sherlock appeared fifteen minutes later, washed and shaved and his hair tamed, the vulnerability John had seen while he was sleeping completely vanished. Sherlock shrugged his coat on and wrapped his scarf around his neck. John bit his tongue not to ask where he was going, if Sherlock wanted to be all mysterious with his coat and his cheekbones again then he could be. But John felt something akin to a blow to the gut when Sherlock stopped at the top of the stairs and said.
“Yes, he’s always like that” Mike supplies.
Except one possible exception.
Chris looked close to tears and Sherlock, alarmed, drew the consultation swiftly to a close.
Mary interpreted this as relating to the invitation, “perhaps it’s a bit soon, but I thought it would be nice for Sherlock to have a friend of his own at the reception, especially as Mike’s working abroad.”
Sherlock took it, picked up a clean knife from the table and slit it open. He lay the page down flat where John could see it, and then took the letter Mary Sutherland had left with him and placed it next to it. She had done exactly as Sherlock had requested and had typed ‘the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog’ in upper and lower case plus a set of numerals and punctuation. Sherlock resisted a satisfied gloat as he swiftly perused the two pages and their envelopes.
“I’m sorry I lost my temper, I suppose you were trying in your half-cocked way to help”
Danny went on. “Outsiders always think that the estate is a deserted wilderness but it’s not, unless a body was buried it wouldn’t be long before someone found it. This might all be the Duke’s private land, but the footpaths and bridlepaths are open, there are always ramblers and riders even in November, if the weather is good, which it has been. Then there were the shoots, that’s a dozen guns, plus loaders, beaters and dogs all over the Home Beat yesterday, and the same again on the Gillow Beat the day before, to say nothing of the caterers and servers. Then Jack brought the Home Farm sheep down from Ness Moor to Lower Penn yesterday, he and Pippa and the dogs were up and down all day.”
******
Greg visibly relaxed, “Yes, she’s not worried about that, Dinah has her own career and leads a very busy life. That’s one of the reasons she wants to get married before Christmas, while she has a break in her schedule.”
Sherlock could tell that Dr Huxtable was dying to interrogate them himself, but his good manners prevailed, particularly when John staggered forward, just a little.
“Then yes”
Once they reached the corner of Lyon Place where Sherlock stopped and addressed John and Mary, “I’m sorry Miss Sutherland, Dr Watson but here I am afraid I must leave you.”
Crowley would have been outraged on his angel’s behalf if he hadn’t been so delighted. “I thought it was all going so well… gourmet dining, virtuoso performances, dancing…”
Inside wasn’t much better. It might have been generously described as having retro charm, if you liked the 1970s and could stand the smell of mildew. The back room claimed an aquatic theme, though John suspected the water running down the walls was incidental rather than deliberate.
John eyed the table from behind a strategically placed menu. “Mother, step-father and son?”
“I didn’t say anything about the estate’s finances.” Steve protested.
Crowley dropped Aziraphale at his shop but didn’t go in; he had a plan formulating in his head and he wanted to get to it, plus he was still rather wary of the pollen.
“I’ve known him years.” She countered “He won’t even remember the conversation.”
“No Miss Sutherland, what I am saying is the hoaxer sent you a picture of a handsome American actor called Brad Pitt. I’m sorry, this is further proof that Ian does not exist.” John’s voice was firm but kind, and it was perhaps this, rather than Sherlock’s more dictatorial tone that finally convinced Mary of the truth.
) struck him from behind and everything went dark.
They had reached the house and Sherlock’s reply had to wait for Rosie to be collected which seemed to involve far too much unnecessary chatter in his opinion, including introducing Sherlock as a trusted person for future information.
John didn’t bother asking Sherlock how he knew this. “You don’t mind keeping an eye on Rosie? I won’t go until she’s asleep.”
“You see over the previous few years James had begun to ask questions, about who would inherit the estate when I died. It is not exactly easy to explain male-line primogeniture, but I did my best, told him about Charles Beverley, and his sons, Alistair and Patrick. James didn’t take this well at all; all teenagers think that life is unfair and to James, the thought that the estate should pass to these complete strangers when he was living on my doorstep, the only son of my only brother, was an outrage. In his view he should himself have been heir of all my estates, and he deeply resented those social laws which made it impossible.
Instead when John and Rosie made it downstairs they found Sherlock already there, suited and booted, nervously alert, and with his hands held stiffly behind his back.
Sherlock ignored John's wittering, he had geared himself up for his speech “John…”
Sherlock laughed, “So it is you now that has the gift of prophesy?”
“Good, then I suggest we take a turn about the Embankment Gardens and I’ll have Sidney meet us at the other side.”
Somewhere between now and 1895
John went over to the blackboard for a closer look, “I see what you mean, but the only name I can think of is Harvey and you already have the H in HERE.”
“We’re not setting off then. Only usually when there’s a case, we don’t tend to hang about.” This last sentence was not completely accurate, there had been plenty of cases that involved ‘hanging about’ but this was generally done by John on his own.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Truly, you would rather do that… with me, than marry the Queen and have all the power and pomp that goes with it?”
With a heavy heart, and the absence of anything else to go on, Sherlock said, “Lead on then.”
John was not at all pleased with sight that greeted him when he entered the room, though he couldn’t put his finger on why. Dinah was curled up on one of the sofas, wearing one of those silky lounge suits he associated with 1930s movie stars, feet bare, her shoes discarded on the floor in front of her. Sherlock was sprawled in an armchair opposite, dressed in his usual Spencer Hart, with his ridiculously tight purple shirt completing the ensemble, he seemed to be sitting at just the right angle to display the long lines of his body, from the plane of his forehead to the tips of his feet, at the best advantage. On the coffee table between them stood the remains of a Savoy Hotel’s renowned ‘afternoon tea’, complete with an almost empty bottle of champagne still in the ice bucket.
Sherlock suggested that Chris escort Mary the short distance home, while he and John waited for him on a bench outside the pub. Chris and Mary agreed to this eagerly and they headed off.
“But you’re not gay; you say so at every opportunity”
“It’s snowed, heavily, all night.”
Sherlock thought that idea had possibilities, until he calculated just how many tourists Wilvercombe hosted in the summer.
“What?”
Just as this longing was becoming unbearable, Molly yawned, “I’m sorry, its been a long day, too much food on top of too much booze. I think we’d better make tracks.”
“You could phone Sherlock, see if he is free tonight.”
Short chapter as very busy day today and I want to get ahead for three longer chapters coming up
“I went to the police, they weren’t very helpful. They said did I know anyone in Wilvercombe and the only person I could think of was The Great Nostradamo, although I suppose that isn’t his real name.”
Sherlock smiled and snuggled in closer to his John. “There was never anything for you to be jealous about... I was always true to you in my fashion.”
“We never did finish that dance!”
“Yes, he asked especially”
John looked bashful and changed the subject “If you don’t mind giving Rosie her bath, I’ll get changed and organise a takeaway. Then I thought we might carry on with
“It’s a miracle, that’s what it is Mr Holmes, a miracle”
, the sentiment is stuck in his head, unworthy of the rational mind but remarkably persistent. Sherlock smiles, the British Museum, right on his doorstep.
Sherlock returns the unsuccessful Toby to his master with the instruction to “Try harder, next time”.
“Come in Inspector, he’s in my kitchen. It seems he’s fallen out with the telephone today.”
There was something underneath him, something soft and scratchy, a rug or sack of some kind and John wondered how it had got there, and why it had been left with him. But he was grateful for the small protection it gave him from the cold stone.
Sherlock is a mixture of curiosity and dread.
“Oh, she wouldn’t, would she? Tell me she wouldn’t.”
A couple of minutes later Sherlock was back on the phone to Hilton-Cubitt, the photograph open on his laptop in front of him.
“What makes you say that?” Steve asked.
Ruth Taylor was an excellent addition to the party, with a surprisingly wicked sense of humour, and the ability to gently engage everyone in conversation including the somewhat overwhelmed Mary Sutherland and the morose Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock toyed with his fish and chips (good, but not a patch on the chippy in Wilvercombe) and listened to Ruth and Mary, they seemed to be discussing someone called Brad Pitt. Sherlock vaguely remembered hearing that name recently but decided he was unlikely to learn anything useful so had begun to tune out when he caught Ruth saying.
John watched with a mixture of incredulity and amazement the coverage of Sherlock’s return to the land of the living, and London, before settling on anger as his primary emotion. He did not attempt to contact his former friend and sincerely hoped that Sherlock would have the good sense not to try to contact him.
It was a statement, but the soldier took it as an invitation.
, and turned his attention back to the man’s palm.
Crowley and Aziraphale had repaired to the backroom of the
“However, I would like to propose a third option, one which you might be interested to hear…”
They were quiet after that; the Headmaster having achieved the desired outcome of his journey to London, and having consumed most of Mrs Hudson’s excellent packed lunch, his exhaustion caught up with him and he dozed while Sherlock scoured the internet on his phone for background to the case.
“I know, but my money will go a lot further there than here.”
John is silent.
Undertaking a relationship with the ‘British Government’ was something of logistic nightmare. Add the complication that the other half of the affaire was a senior officer in the Metropolitan Police Force and the nightmare assumed epic proportions.
May 2002, John read out loud.
“We can hear Rosie in her bedroom while we are sitting here.”
“They’re all over the Peaks, there’s the spectacular show caves, like the Heights of Abraham, or Poole’s Cavern, big tourist attractions, then there’s the lesser known ones like Doves Hole. Then there’s places like Ragged Shaw, on private land that the general public don’t know about.”
A woman’s voice with a soft Norfolk burr. “Mrs King”
Abandoned, John headed down to the crowded dance floor, crowded, not least because it was the size of a handkerchief. He’d been there an hour or more, he’d lost track of the time, dancing and checking out the talent, when he heard Harry calling his name.
Once there, the hole already prepared, Sherlock takes the precious box, lines it with a familiar plaid shirt and soft jumper and finally places his still beating heart inside.
John was not entirely sure what was going on, Sherlock never willingly took part in social events let alone instigated them. However, he had known Sherlock long enough not to miss a cue when he saw one.
“Not all Molly dear, it’s so lovely to see you, you’ve been quite a stranger… and who’s this young man?”
Aziraphale’s voice trailed off,
Crowley stood up, stretched, walked round to where the angel was sitting, unfolded a wing and placed it gently round his angel’s shoulders.
John was just about to say he might pop in once he had finished his chores when Sherlock, drawn from his lair no doubt by the sound of pouring, appeared in the kitchen. He bent to give Rosie the briefest of pecks on the top of her head and sat down reaching for the teapot as he did so.
The man looks nonplussed, “You’re going? I’d rather thought we’d end the night in bed.”
“I said quiet”
Somewhere between Edgware Road and Paddington the train ground to a halt, some of the passengers groaned while those who were more used to the tube just carried on listening to whatever was on their iPod, or reading the paper, or just staring aimlessly into space.
“Then you’re unattached, just like me?”
“What I don’t understand is, if this doctor is so perfect, why Sherlock didn’t snap him up already?”
“Do Mummy and Father know?”
“The coverage of your return from the dead, so to speak, was a subject of much discussion in the staff room. Without it I would have been unaware of your association with the missing master.”
There was nothing for it, it was too early to call Dinah, even a helicopter wouldn’t get him out of here today. He rolled over and went back to sleep.
“I thought you might appreciate some lunch,” She whispered conspiratorially, “There’s a few sandwiches and a pot of tea in the kitchen. I don’t mind watching him if you want a break.”
Another long one - in which John finally catches up with Sherlock
“Or the bun’s in the oven.” Crowley quipped and then rather wished he hadn’t when he saw Aziraphale’s horrified expression.
“What about her ladyship?”
******
“You didn’t speak to them, or ask them what they meant?”
Antonia started to make excuses, but Janine would have none of it, “Mary won’t mind, she’s lovely, we were all new girls in the city once, we have to stick together.”
John is a saint
Mycroft looked up, “I’m sorry, asked you what?”
He could do with a scotch…
When Sherlock emerged from his bedroom, they all gasped, he was wearing a suit of a very dark grey so that it was almost black, identical to the one John had on, with a white shirt and of all things, a lilac tie. John couldn't remember having seen Sherlock in a tie since his own wedding. John raised an interrogative eyebrow; Sherlock had the grace to blushed and confessed.
“Grief!” Crowley exclaimed, when the angel finally let him get a word in edgeways. “It sounds like one calamity after another for this human, a perfect storm.”
Sherlock interrupted, “It is a house in Lyon Place?”
John takes the opportunity to visit the haunts of his student days, Bart’s, St Sepulchre’s, the pubs at Smithfield market, before wandering up High Holborn to Russell Square pausing for coffee on the way.
“He said ‘Howzit’, like he always did to Paul.”
Fridays John generally finished at the surgery at noon and collected Rosie early from the child minder before going back to his soulless flat in the suburbs and getting on with the jobs that awaited him there. But for some reason today he found he couldn’t face another afternoon of washing and cleaning with only Rosie for company so instead of turning for home, he crossed the road and headed off in the direction of the underground.
Sherlock went on, now in full flow, “the correspondence from Ian Moody is what you would expect from a novelist of Mrs Etherege’s type so I believe it is she who drafts the suitably flowery love letters, the kind guaranteed to spark the interest of her naïve young secretary. She sends them round to Mrs Windibank, probably by one of her staff. You read in that article she had difficulty in keeping staff, which means that she has employees aside from Mary Sutherland. Mary’s mother was a secretary when she married Thomas Sutherland, and in fact she taught her daughter the skill, it would be simple for her to type up what Mrs Etherege had written.”
“Shit! Wasn’t there somewhere I was meant to be?”
“My who?” Sherlock sat up, surprised.
“Yesterday morning, Lord Saltire did not appear at breakfast, his bed had not been slept in, and a set of clothes were missing. I organised a search of the school and I was certain that the boy was not in the building.  At first, we thought he might have found a way out of his room via the window; although it is on the second floor there is a strong growth of ivy on the outside wall, it would easily have supported his weight. It was impossible he could have left the school though any of the main doors which are locked and alarmed overnight.”
and was halfway through
John went back up the stairs to his room, quietly so as not to wake Rosie and slowly so that he could tap out a text to Greg.
John leans forward and gently kisses him on the lips. Sherlock's heart pounds and the green lights on the monitor reflect his turmoil.
“Will that be all?” Anthea asks
Mary took the letter from inside her blouse, her romantic tendencies had resulted in her keeping the letter close to her heart and when she handed it to Sherlock it was warm which he found rather distasteful. The letter was brief, explaining that he (Ian) had been called away on a secret mission, and asking that Mary swear on her father’s grave that she would be true to him forever.
“Tomorrow evening, I’m taking Dinah to see
“Just think about it Aziraphale, there will always be something to look forward to, always new things to discover.”
“Who you thought I was .... is the man who I want to be”.
“Time to turn in I think Mrs H, heavy day tomorrow.”
“So not just any honey, no…let me guess… the famous Clara?”
******
Aziraphale was immutable.
John surreptitiously watched the group for a while longer. Now that Sherlock had clarified the reasons behind their behaviour it was all so glaringly obvious. The way the woman related to the younger man was obviously that of a lover, while the older man looked as if her wanted to throttle them both. As the night wore on, the woman became even more attentive to the younger man, who smirked at his prospective stepson when he knew his fiancée wasn’t looking. When they left, she was holding his hand with an air of defiance while her son trailed sullenly behind.
Sherlock shook his head. “I’ll know when I find it.”
“Not a quick job round here, though we can keep an eye out for any disturbance in the ground. But I’m with Danny” Steve said, “my money would be on the Rocky Shaw, assuming they were locals, it’s a straight run from here. His Grace doesn’t allow caving on his land,” Steve explained to Sherlock. “A body could go undiscovered for years.”
“That’s all right then.” John said with an air of finality, “Twelve days, doesn’t give us much time to get things organised.”
The rest of the morning passed quietly. John was relieved that he had managed all his shopping, even his gift for Sherlock, well before Christmas Eve. He had only one thing he really wanted to achieve today, and with Sherlock still in bed, this was the ideal time to attempt it. Two uniformed officers from Paddington Green police station came round and took his statement. But he had already conferred with Sherlock as to exactly what would be said.
Really this was finished, but I couldn't resist a little epilogue.
As it turned out there was no explosion, controlled or otherwise. Lestrade, in what seemed like retribution for the previous quiet week was suddenly ludicrously busy with a suspected kidnapping gone wrong and all thoughts of the text message vanished from his mind. When Sherlock finally deigned to take a look, Lestrade found him Johnless and subdued.
He knocked on the door of 221A and called out to Mrs Hudson. “I’m expecting a parcel; if the person who delivers it won’t take it upstairs leave it in the hallway. Don’t try to lift it yourself.”
“Was anything else of Dr Watson’s missing?”
“Oh no, Marie is bringing Poppy and Skye, it will be fine.”
Steve glanced at Danny and then sighed, “I suppose you’re old enough to know the Holderness secrets now.” He switched off the engine and then turning back to Sherlock said.
Sherlock had had time for the numerous deductions that had been swirling around his head since Abe Garvey’s arrival to settle; now they came into play as he addressed the American. “You might indeed have loved each other very much but Eddie Hilton left America because he had to get away from you and the sordid closeted life you imposed on him. He chose to make a clean break and his marriage was result of that, not the cause.
Feeling like he was trespassing, John wandered over to the sitting room wall where Sherlock had his planning for the wedding set out like a military campaign. There had been battles fought in world war two that hadn’t been plotted with such meticulous detail. John noticed that more dates had been marked off the calendar, and more items crossed off the list, the day was getting nearer. Perhaps he should get round to booking the honeymoon this weekend, after all.
“Indeed, it does Love.”
Chris and Mary proceeded to engage in an animated conversation regarding old books and bindings, while Ruth talked to John about his holiday and mutual acquaintances and Sherlock looked on, until she suddenly glanced at her watch and said.
Aziraphale and Crowley had applied themselves to concocting a case that would be plausible, and of sufficient interest for the great Sherlock Holmes to be prepared to take it on. Aziraphale had ruled out murder, kidnapping or arson, Crowley had dismissed any financial crime as too tedious for words, and Aziraphale agreed that Sherlock would probably view it in the same way. It would have to be theft. Aziraphale remembered an interesting crime from Paris in the 1800s that he thought he could adapt; Crowley had already decided he would pose as the client’s stalker/relative to keep an eye on the proceedings but for the time being he kept that to himself. The next step was for Aziraphale to engage the services of a consulting detective.
******
Sherlock and John pay a call
“Mrs Edna Flugrath, she wasn’t a real aunt, she was a cousin of sorts of my father, she was always very kind to me.”
“Tell me,” Stefan asked the smiling Molly, happy that she seemed so much happier than when they had arrived, “What are you so pleased looking about?”
Mangussen hears the sound of a helicopter over ahead, signalling an excellent conclusion to the evening’s entertainment. Distracted he doesn’t notice the detective remove the gun from John’s pocket. Ironically, he’s still gloating as the bullet enters his brain.
Sherlock groaned but John wasn’t fooled.
“A few years, the nineteen fift…” Aziraphale clamped his mouth shut swiftly, while Sherlock looked at curiously, “some time in the early noughties,” he finished, trying to look nonchalant. He glanced at Sherlock and immediately knew he hadn’t got away with it, but fortunately Sherlock said nothing.
John glanced at the ceiling wondering if Mycroft had some sonic device that he had beamed into the room above to produce the required interruption.
Sherlock clung to it as a life raft. Still does.
******
“I am afraid we are being forced to make a social call," Sherlock's voice dripped with distain, "we are going to congratulate Lestrade on his forthcoming nuptials.”
“If only you would consider a useful occupation” Mycroft’s days of wishing his brother would join him in The Service are long gone, such a liability
Another pause, another false reprieve, it appeared negotiations were no longer on the table.
“Except his parents kicked up a fuss, said that their son was a deeply religious man, would never have committed suicide. That’s when the Guv got involved, especially when the rags took up the story and speculated he was guilty after all… oh hello John.”
“No!” Sherlock said again.
Like much of Wilvercombe the Hotel Resplendent was past its heyday although it was bearing up better than most of the resort and the restaurant was still very grand, although not particularly busy. They were shown to their table by an officious waiter whose comment about Sherlock’s lack of tie was aborted by a whisper to the ear from the clairvoyant. He brought the menu and took their drinks order without further to-do.
He feels… different, which is nonsense of course, there can be no material difference wrought from three hours fumbling in the dark.
His uncle nodded in agreement.
“I suspect that is highly unlikely seeing that he’s been dealing with hotel customers for the past five years. Get him processed and I’ll be with you in an hour. Black, two sugars.”
John hadn’t thought much about the implications, he’d gathered he would be expected to do his share of night feeds and dirty nappies, but he also knew he was never going to be the primary care giver; they would never be able to afford the mortgage on Mary’s salary. Or perhaps they might have, who knew what she had squirrelled away from her previous occupation?
“No can do, the CCTV’s a nonstarter, too dark to make anything out. The nerds are working on it now but they’re not optimistic. There was activity in this corridor two days ago but they’ve only shadows to go on.”
“That is the problem which we are now about to solve,” Sherlock replied. “You remember, Inspector Martin, when the Kings said that they could smell gunpowder quite strongly in the hallway as well as the study.”
Molly turned to Sherlock “I thought Greg was supposed to be coming”
Sherlock cracked open one eye, “Have no fear Mycroft, even as we speak, I am on the case.”
“Good God no,” Sherlock shuddered, and they all laughed. “He’s in Brussels until Tuesday but he wouldn’t come anyway.”
A life extinguished can never be revived.
“Since I was a child, why?”
The day wore on without improvement or variety to the extent Sherlock began to seriously to consider how much longer he could keep the job up and if perhaps there might be some way of getting the real Great Nostradamo paroled. It didn’t help that it seemed that every client was obsessed with relationships which were never Sherlock’s strong suit and so between and if he was honest, during consultations, his thoughts inevitably drifted back to Dr Watson. He had said he would pick him up at eight and he, Sherlock, wasn’t to be late.
She left the room for a few minutes and presently returned with a small picture in a silver frame. Sherlock glanced at it before handing it to John who examined it more closely, even moving to the window to see it in better light.
“After Sherringford, he was so keen for us to move back to Baker Street, involved me in all the renovations, was so conscientious making the place safe for Rosie, I did wonder if there might be something but he’s never said a word.”
“Yes,” Sherlock snapped. “Any reason why it shouldn’t be?”
Sherlock brief considered the inspector’s case “All right, mildly interesting, give me the address, I’ll meet you there.”
“Thank you.”
John tries to shut her up, “Listen, I can’t talk long, shut up a minute.”
“I know, she texted me”
Reluctantly John went up the seventeen stairs to the first floor; he paused momentarily outside the closed door to flat B before taking the next flight to the landing where his old room was situated.
“And I take it the body is fresh?”
“But something has changed?”
Mycroft offered Crowley a chair and had the waiter bring the sixteen-year-old malt and another glass, and then said to Aziraphale, dryly.
“Since when did you get to be the person who makes tea?” John asked, no trace of sleep in his voice. “You made me three cups of tea yesterday, that’s three more than in the whole two years we lived together.”
Do the police really still raid gay bars? John wonders but he can already hear the sound of running, dogs barking and voices raised. He decides not to wait to find out.
For Sherlock, his torture at the hands of Serbians has left more than physical scars though generally it is Musgrave Hall that disturbs his dreams.
At last with Rosie in her stroller, occupied with her surroundings, they headed for the park and a sheltered bench, once seated Sherlock had as much of John’s attention as he could hope for.
The fortune telling side of things came naturally enough, a few well-placed deductions seemed to do the trick, and the average enquiry barely stretched his capacity. It was conveying the message that took the effort, requiring a level of interpersonal ability that had always eluded Sherlock. However, after his initial consultations had ended either in tears, threats or even, on one memorable occasion, a narrowly ducked left hook, Sherlock had developed a formula whereby he thought one thing and said the opposite… it seemed to work, certainly the sittings now seemed less inclined to end in hysterics.
The unconscionable level of idiocy in the people who surround him.
“What do you mean?”
“I’m with you, you know that.” Murray repeats to comfort his friend, relieved when John quietens and sleep claims him.
“Intervened? How? Locked me up, thrown away the key?”
“You did this?” He asked distractedly, all the while scanning the passing countryside.
It was a mild night, and the walk pleasant. As befits a city that never sleeps, the streets were busy. The Playhouse was disgorging the evening’s audience, while the queue to get into
I watched the montage at the end of The Final Problem last night to try to work out some kind of timeline for this fic - it is impossible so please accept this approximation of the course of events.
A noise, an animal somewhere, in pain, that was what woke Sherlock from his own troubled sleep. There is was again, coming from the direction of John’s bedroom. Sherlock recognised it then for what it was. He had heard it before, at Baker Street.
Sherlock opened his mouth to give his usual reply – but that reminded him too much of the old Sherlock. If his client thought he was an angel, then he would be an angel.
“That’s Greg, he’ll hardly know anyone, put him with Molly and Mrs H.”
“What were you thinking of Crowley?” the angel asked for the fourth time.
“Apis mellifera are susceptible to a wide range of pathogens, including a broad set of viruses. I have recently been reading an excellent work by a professor of epidemiology in the United States who had trialled the use of a compound made from wood-rotting fungi to treat the most harmful of viruses to attack the honeybee. Did you know John, that in trial it reduced the incidence of deformed wing virus by over eighty percent and had the most positive impact…”
“It didn’t put me off, but it did put me in my place.”
“Why are you here then, if you are not stopping?”
“Pity, I rather think I wouldn’t mind playing games with you.” Moriarty gave his sweetest smile.
“G Lestrade?”
John couldn’t help smiling to himself. He was tempted to reply
While Mary and John sat down, Sherlock remained standing, leaning slightly against the mantlepiece and listening as John, without mentioning any names, carefully outlined the scale of the deception that had been played upon her.
“Because they could” Sherlock replied simply “Because they get their kicks out of exercising power over unsuspecting victims.”
Sherlock swung round to look at John. "Eddie that’s it, this word here must be Eddie, and these two characters D and I.”
The two men got back into the truck and Danny remounted his bike. Sherlock surveyed the roads ahead, while they had both described it as a crossroads, it hardly merited the name. The lane to the left was even narrower than the one they were on, and on the right, the signpost read ‘Private Road - Ash End Farm only’, leaving forward as the most obvious route to take. Without saying anything, Steve appeared to agree as he carried straight on. Sherlock continued to monitor Danny’s progress through the wing mirror but as the road straightened out and the truck picked up speed, he turned to Steve and said.
They both laughed at this, then Mycroft asked, “Night cap?”
“I knew from his first letter that we were meant for each other, we had so much in common. We had both lost our parents, well I still had Mother, but you know what I mean. We shared the same interests, the same beliefs, the same hobbies, we seemed to think alike on everything. He even had a typewriter, only he had a Remington and I had an Olivetti but apart from that we were completely simpatico.
By the time John and Rosie arrived around three in the afternoon Sherlock had 221b more or less ready for them. He had enlisted the help of Josie, one of his formerly homeless network who, despite, or perhaps because of having served time for breaking and entering, was a fairly competent carpenter to install stair gates, fit child proof locks to the kitchen cupboards, and put up a couple of shelves. (Sherlock would have done the latter himself but he was on a tight schedule). Various substances had been banished for the interim to the safety of 221c, although Sherlock hoped to restore some of them once negotiations with John were complete. He still didn’t like the sound of a few days and didn’t want to do anything that might jeopardise his future happiness.
Sherlock had been arguing with Mr. Kim over the obvious fact that he kept the good tuna hidden in the back when he’d first seen the stranger across the market. The man had been standing next to the rows of sea bass talking and laughing with one of the local fishermen. His face lighting up as he laughed, crinkling small lines around his eyes. Sherlock wasn’t sure he’d ever seen that color blue before. He wasn’t very tall, but he wasn’t short either, if pressed for an answer Sherlock would say that the man was of average height for the typical British male.
The moment Mycroft looked into her arms, the moment he saw that little pink bundle move and squirm Mycroft new he was done for. And the moment a tiny hand tightened around his finger Mycroft Holmes decided that perhaps there was room for one more person in his circle of necessary people after all.
It had been two years since he’d become the sous chef at The Rabbit Whole and 3 years since he’d known Greg. Greg had managed what no one else other than Harry had done: he’d become John’s only friend. It wasn’t that John didn’t want friends or that people didn’t like him, quiet the opposite, people seemed to take an instant liking to him, it was just that John had never felt the need to really connect with any of them for more than just a passing moment. Not until Greg.
This morning he’d dreamt of a milk and honey cake with with honeycomb candy. He grimaced as he rolled over on his side and felt the sheets ruined from this morning’s little indulgence under him. Very well then. He’d bake the cake and be done once and for all with John Watson.
Sherlock's heart skipped a beat, he knew he was starring but there was no helping it. Not when John was this close. John's palm was warm against his, small callouses sending shivers up his arm. His grip was strong and steady, muscles flexing slightly on his forearm which was lightly dusted with sun kissed blonde hair. It reminded Sherlock of a freestone peach.
Short chapter, next one will be from Sherlock's POV. Also I rather like the idea of a French speaking Greg =]. Comments are always welcomed! Thank you for reading!
?” The words felt foreign spilling out of his lips, his voice sounded far and away, surely not his own.  “hmmmm” was the only answer he got from his father who suddenly found a spot on the ceiling very interesting.
It was heaven.
“Hmmmm, suppose I could pop up by the market and procure some” Sherlock had answered in a distracted manner.
John's mouth came off Sherlock's cock with a wet "
"Sherlock, didn't you say you need help at the market?"
He'd know those eyes anywhere. But by god he's dreamt of his lips day and night for months now.
"Oi! What's gotten into him?" Anderson whispered conspiratorially.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock's stomach did a small summersault as he felt John's body press against his, feeling John's chest against his back. John's hand cradled his wrist and slowly lifted it to his mouth. John's warm breath sending spidery tingles up Sherlock's arm while strong fingers wrapped around his lower forearm to hold him in place.
"I do, on my way there now. Thought I'd take Mike up on his offer and stop by, see what all the buzz is about".
He’d gotten into a row (yet again) with Anderson over the price of the lemon pies currently being served. Sherlock had proceeded to spent the vast majority of the after dinner rush cooped up in the kitchen “experimenting” with new recipes. Which really was just  a way of saying he’d stayed there in hopes that tonight was the night Anderson got fed up and quit. No such luck. Anderson seemed to be impervious to Sherlocks’s distain.
Something in Sherlock's chest that he didn't know was there relaxed and swelled with quiet bliss at John's words. "I'd like nothing more"
) opinion. He could hear his mother’s voice, humming through the open windows while the curtains puffed into the the room like clouds in the planes of the great Argentine Andes. Mycroft suspected that it was no coincidence that his father’s study was directly in front of his mother’s garden and if he was being honest, the notion of it wasn’t completely appalling, tho he would never admit to it.
Certainly he had heard wrong, yes, that was the most logical explanation.
. Dear god, this is what he was doing wasn’t it? He was pining after a perfect stranger. NO! This simply wouldn’t do! He would go home, take a nice shower (cold, thank you very much) and forget about the stranger. He would most definitely not think about how he had looked in his uniform or how there had been a tiny bit of sauce on his golden tanned neck. Nope, he wouldn’t.
It all started with a simple wish.
They always did this, on Saturday mornings John would wake up early, just as the sky was bleeding orange into the clouds and the morning was still stirring up. While the night slowly bleed away into warm daylight and the sound of the waves crashing on the cliff behind their home were the only sounds that made their way up his window. John would slowly paddle to Harry’s room and crawl into bed next to her. He’d stay there for a few moments, listening to her slow and deep breathing, feeling safe, feeling like he was home and no harm could ever come to him there. Not as long as he was next to his big sister who alway always always came to help him, no matter how big the other kids were of how hard they hit. Harry always screamed and hit back till they left John alone, then she’d rub her knuckles on his head and call him a hard head. And she’d laugh while she did it, hight bubbling laughs that made the corners of her eyes crinkle, tugging him toward home, toward mom.
If John had ever been asked to describe what a lighting strike felt like, he’d say that it felt like looking into those eyes for the first time.
Just as Sherlock thinks there can’t possible be anything sexier about this complete stranger walking toward him, “
"Don't, I like it... I like to hear you" John whispered into Sherlock's ear. He hesitated for a second before lifting his left hand to cup Sherlock's jaw guiding him to his lips. Sherlock shivered as the kiss turned desperate, rocking his hips into John's hand letting him feel how desperate he'd become, how hard he was for him. The friction was almost too much and not enough. They pawed at each other like horny teenagers. "God you're beautiful"
"Yessss..." Sherlock moaned "Oh God, that's.. uhhhmmmggg" Sherlock seemed to forget how to speak as John began to slowly ease in and out of him. He continued to lick and sock him through two fingers till Sherlock was a babbling mess and his own cock was so hard it hurt. If he wasn't careful this would all be over too quickly. He carefully removed his fingers much to Sherlock's whining and gave his full and leaking cock one last kiss before crawling up between Sherlock's thighs and plucking one of the small plastic wrappers from the box.
John was grinning now "You think I'm handsome"
And just like that the moment breaks and the other man is gone.
Please Please if you feel like saying hi in the comments don't hesitate! Nothing makes me happier than seeing and respiring to them!
In the end he’d given up and walked back home.
Hope you enjoy!
Our boys finally get together! Smut ensues :)
The smell of books swirled around the room encasing him in a wonderful bubble of calmness. Something about the stacks of books, carefully lined up to the ceiling, mixed with the rich smell of mahogany always brought forth feelings of comfort and even something closely resembling happiness. Mycroft took a deep slow breath, Mrs. Smythe had cleaned today, the wood smelled strongly of polish and the rich Persian rug felt plush and fluffy underneath him as he dug his bare toes through it.
"Li... Limes"
” observations. Although he hand’t seen the harm in letting her know that her boyfriend had taken a liking to liberating her rings and pawning them off, it had been a kindness really. He’d began to think if it was possible to get them back when something his father said made his train of thought come to a screeching halt.
And oh how suddenly Sherlock wanted to pat that hair, to ruffle it with his fingers and run his fingernails down John’s scalp. To hear pleased little noises scape those plush pink lips as his hands followed the curve of this man’s head down. Down to the base of his neck...
And to his complete astonishment and surprise Sherlock winked. Yes, playing it cool and detached was the best course of action. There was no need to let this perfect stranger know he had any effect on him. No. Mysterious and aloof was the way to go. After all, the theatric streak of things was never lost on a Holmes and Sherlock saw no need to brake the family trait now.
“Hmmm” Mike replied as he proceeded to stuff his face.
John is covered in sugar when out of the blue he sees the last thing he expected to ever see: the man who would turn his world upside down.
A soft prayer whispered between tears in a cold, humid closet that was as dark as a pool of old blood. “wishes are very powerful, you know” his mom had told him once. “Wishes come true only if you pour your entire soul into them, then there is nothing that will stop them from coming true”. Seven year old John had only laughed at his mom while she told him about the magical powers of wishes looking over her shoulder and flipping a pancake high in the air. He’d known, rather, he’d felt that Harry  was sitting at the bottom of the stairs listening and  looking at their mom with wonder in her eyes. He’d always known where Harry was at all times, even if they were far apart, and he’d always know.
“And some nice fresh tuna for the Sashimi we’re serving this week, we’re running low”
Greg had taught him more about cooking than what he had learned at school, he’d taken him under his wing just as he had started working at the restaurant. Together they had worked their way up, Greg as the new executive chef and John as his sous chef. They were great in the kitchen and the fact that they were great friends was an added bonus that John was grateful for. If Greg and his fantastic French accent had a way of making all the girls in his path weak at the knees and John’s stomach flutter every time he looked his way had nothing to do with it.
And everything stops and John feels like he’s been asleep till this very instant, like he’s been waiting for this moment his whole life.
Sherlock certainly wasn’t thinking of John Watson as he walked toward the fish marked late last night or rather early this morning. He hadn’t certainly thought about the possibility of running into him when he’d turned the corner and decided to cut through the loading docks. And oh God, who was he kidding, after months of imagining what John’s voice sounded like, what his face really looked like up close it had been a near thing not to run toward him in that sugar cloud.
"Oh God" Sherlock almost chocked on the words, grabbing at John's t-shirt. "Naked, now!" John nearly fell off the bed while trying to take his jeans and pants off. Sherlock was perfect underneath all those clothes with seemingly endless white skin that John found delicious to the touch and almost impossible not to kiss. Sherlock found John's body to be everything he had come to dream and more. Compact muscles that flexed with every movement, a small scar on his abdomen where his appendix had been removed, and old rugby scar on his left shoulder and a very hard and pink cock that set Sherlock's groin on fire.
John Watson has absolutely no idea that Sherlock is standing a mere twenty feet away, looking straight at him. Sherlock seems to have forgotten how to speak, how to walk, how to breathe. If anyone had asked him what his name was at that exact same moment Sherlock is sure he would’ve simply combusted on the spot.
"Jesus! John, please!" John swallowed Sherlock back into his throat with a pleased groan as he pushed the cap of the bottle open and squeezed some of the velvety clear liquid into his right hand and reached between Sherlock's thighs, circling a lubbed finger around the tight ring of muscles. He was about let go of Sherlock to ask if he was ready when suddenly he felt Sherlock bear down at the same time that the motion made his finger slip all the way in, past the tightness of his entrance.
Father’s study was one of the best rooms in the house, in his humble (
"Come back to mine?" John manages in between kisses.
"It's..." Sherlock is breathing as if he's just learned to, shallow shaky little puffs making his belly quiver with each exertion, tensing and relaxing. "It's been a while since I was...since I did this with anyone" Sherlock whispers closing his eyes, embarrassed, letting his head drop back against the door with a soft thud even as he seeks to grind down on John's leg. "S'okay love. I've got you, it's been a while for me too". Sherlock's blush deepens at the endearment and those beautiful seaglass eyes widen and darken with lust.
He’d stay there, next to Harry’s warmth till she’d flip her leg over and shove him off the bed only to race downstairs to eat the first pancake. Saturdays were by far John’s favorite day of the week. Saturdays meant waking up the sound of ocean waves and the smell of warm pancakes in the air.  Mom always made pancakes when she was the happiest. Pancakes on Saturday morning meant warm apple pies after dinner while their Dad held their mom by the waist and told them about his week in the fishing boat in between his mom's soft smiles that looked a lot like Harry's did. John never saw his mom as happy as she was when they were all there, together, having dinner and eating pie with the windows open and the smell of the ocean mixed apples and summer and magic.
“Yeah?”
He made a vow, after all. He swore it.
Blue. A sea of blue. With not much to see inside of it. Not now. Not ever again. Broken glass. The once sky blue of those eyes in front of him now broken to pieces with such proximity. Precious stones. Sapphires with faces of colours. There’s teal and indigo, warm and welcoming. But no… now most of it all has turned an icy arctic. Lifeless. Beaten. Dead.
“Please don’t go blinking on me again. It’s scary”
His fingertips are on Sherlock’s temple. He catches a tuft between them. A stray one. All alone in the pale expanse of Sherlock’s forehead. He finds it soft. Softer than he could have ever imagined. His sense of touch is overloaded with need. The need to remember… To block his imaginings of years and years, just so he could cherish the real moment, the real memory now that he has one. His heart skips a bit. Slow with palpable sadness. He’s afraid. He can’t lose him. Not now. Not again.
He is no longer floating. He is sinking, slowly, in the pool of black ink, that feels heavy like lead. His eyes are open as the liquid void flows over them.
“Obviously”
Rosie hiccups again and wails weakly, disturbed by it.
Rosie is quiet now but her little face is smudged with tears. When Sherlock lowers her on the baby changer unit, she clings on his dressing gown with significant strength, crumpling the silk in her small fists. John leans in to kiss her cheek, smooth the tears away and he is too close to Sherlock, almost cheek to cheek, moving with speed. Colliding.
Voice tight with strain. Painting pieces of a puzzle. Sherlock does not want to guess or deduce. He wants John’s words.
Is it for Rosie’s good to be taken by social services? When she’s not opening up to almost anyone? When she needs constant encouragement? Because John can’t imagine the social services would give her to Harry in any case. Not that she would be a better choice than a home. So, she’d be in a home. Alone. Among strangers. How the hell does Harry think she’s helping exactly?
How many times he has to wake up... how many things he has to realise, before...
Sherlock’s giggle brings John back to the present, clear as water stream, sparkling in the sun. The battle they’ve been watching has just ended and the contestants speak humorously with the judges and coach.
A pointed look. He wasn’t. He wasn’t sure. Especially, when it became clear. John’s presence was enough for Sherlock never to reach for her, ask for her, show her any affection. John’s presence was enough for his daughter to be silent as the grave and steal glances towards the consulting detective but never reach with her grabby hands like that first day. Rosie wasn’t happy here. Sherlock wasn’t happy here.
). Honeybee, too (why would she miss someone she has barely known?). Their worlds will keep spinning. They will forget (and replace). His world has come to a screeching halt and exploded, and now there is only particles floating in the space of his mind, echoing when they clash. He’s only a junkie, anyway. (Freak). Still looks like one. (Will never not carry the marks). He can lie here for as long as he wants, nothing will come of it.
“Ah…” John breathes in this newfound freedom. In their achieved openness that can only now grow.
“Please, little love?” John tries but she keeps her lips firmly shut.
‘Hush’
“So?”
“N-no. No”
Sherlock’s fingers brush over the cloth, letting John acclimatize to the touch that is not a touch yet. When there is no reaction he lets his palm lie atop and envelop John’s smaller one and pulls. The skin is warm beneath a layer of chill from the cold London air. Sherlock’s palm is clammy. John does not resist, his fingers frozen-numb letting go, lets Sherlock’s hand guide his. Sherlock lowers their hands to John’s side. Then lets go. He pulls back. John does not move, his other hand still in his hair. The hand Sherlock just freed has curled into a fist but is otherwise quiet.
He lets the silence win, but it’s not empty anymore. It’s companionable. Easy. He is still holding his wrist tight.
His phone buzzes. He remembers what he had been expecting and fishes for it hurriedly, his pulse galloping in his throat.
Sherlock cradles the washed Honeybee in his arms. Dressed in fresh-smelling clothes, she is now kicking her feet playfully, to keep her father from fitting small blue socks on her tiny feet.
The clatter from the bathroom continues. Rosie twitches, agitated. She’s careful when she looks at him, a little frown over her small nose.
Nappy change and morning bottle all done, she nestled into his arms, eyelids droopy with exhaustion. At least her temperature was lower, thirty-seven point three. Sherlock could only hope it would stay low, and not peak again. Every time her small body was wracked by a sneeze or a coughing fit, he ached with the frailty of her, with how delicate she was, all hidden away in his arms in search of comfort, and warmth. He held her head in the cup of his palm, guiding her to rest it over his heart, hoping this could calm her even now.
John takes a breath.
makes Sherlock cringe in disgust. No. No it’s better like this. It has always been better like this.
“Is there… Anything else you’d like?”
When the song ends, he feels bleeding and raw, cut open for the world to see but luckily for him, only Sherlock’s eyes are watching, sparkling through his shattering world with such joy that it draws John up and up and up through waves and white-water, against any current until he can breathe again.
“Nothing?” John frowns.
of January. His birthday. All because Sherlock Holmes was too trusting and too blind to see the truth. All because Sherlock believes in John Watson. The noble soldier. Always.
It had been such a long time since last he thought of himself as John’s friend. And he had not considered himself likely to experience John’s friendship again, given what had happened over the last eight months -and possibly since before that, too. But now… Now… It was such a bewildering, mismatched thought among the jumbled-up patchwork of things he had established as set in stone for so long. It was so simple that it was the most intricate thing, so impossible it shone all the clearer, so wanted it seemed like it’d been here all along, so unattainable it couldn’t fit into his mind.
Sherlock nods. They are both sweating. The building is not too warm, to avoid any spread of diseases, being an environment lots of children pass by, but their walking on the February cold outside has made them feel the considerable change in the atmosphere sharper than it actually is.
And what threatens John is the word. The notion. The world’s notion of the word. The world’s notion of who John is, every time he could accidentally be seen as
John makes to stand and inspect the situation properly. Sherlock all but shrieks -or did he?- and curls his body to a tight ball.
They wait for the train at the platform. John herds them to what at first looks like a quiet spot, which is still swarming with people a little while after. Honeybee stills and falls entirely silent. Sherlock's foot is twitching. He wants to curl up and hide away. Nothing to it.
They sober up. Fixing gazes at the flames. John watches the edge of one log becoming ash, dissolving into a pile of black charcoal. Empty. Dead. But able to be resurrected. If used right. Like a phoenix.
He’s… angry?
Burn it.
“How-how did you-…?” He whispers.
“How did you stop?” he breathes. Hoping she can’t hear.
Sherlock is looking at him as if one of the eyeballs he used to keep in the fridge returned to haunt him on two legs. But he didn’t say no. He did not send him away. John was the man who had beaten him to death. Who would have. And the man who now asked permission to nurse him back to health. And his plea would be granted materialisation. It was almost too easy. Perhaps these good omens will dissipate if he concentrates on them too much. He turns on his heel, letting Sherlock follow at his own pace.
“And I want to ask you if… If you would want us too
And then they even out, and settle against each other, John’s lips opening a little against his, and every nerve, down his spine, to his fingers and toes tingles with a firefly’s twinkle. John’s hands frame his face as if turning a sunflower to the light so as not to ruffle its petals.
Sherlock breathes, lips parted, and smiles back. John is captivated. It’s instant. The sun flickering over ebony curls, shining. Sherlock nods. The doctor/therapist’s office is just five to ten minutes away from the tube station on foot. Sherlock’s gloved fingers come up to fumble with his newly acquired scarf. There’s tenderness in the way he relaxes after pressing the soft threads closer to his skin.
“I-I helped you that time.” He tries, swallowing hard. “I never repeated any of the shite
He should have blown himself to bits back then.
It had been Mycroft’s impasse. The entire flat had to be emptied and swept clean before Sherlock was allowed to move back in. Sherlock had agreed that some restoration was required; he had turned the kitchen into a meth lab, after all. But while he was recovering, Mycroft assumed full responsibility and authority over the entire process. Sherlock’s opinion on what to keep had not been required at any point. In the end, it turned out that everything, lab equipment, books, case files, even mantelpiece decorations, had been cleared away. In many cases, only the furniture was left behind. Upon returning to 221B and finding a beautifully polished husk, Sherlock had assumed Mycroft would enlighten him with some explanations, at least. Preferably, first of all, why Sherlock was only left with a handful of clothes, a laptop, and his phone. And a frozen bank account, with only a new Debit Card for expenses and a, he was informed, monthly allowance for it. But no explanations were given, since his brother had not graced him with a visit, text, or call since the evening of January 5
Sherlock’s face is crumbling.
The start of a hopeful smile tugs at John’s lips.
. Someone needs to hold her, and the only one available at the moment is himself. Which means… Sherlock could hold Honeybee.
He did not want anything John did not feel. Anything that was just a means of self-punishment.
. Images. From back then. Images John will never be able to erase. Those are the memories screaming at him now to push, stay, talk, be fucking strong for once.
Sherlock’s head tilts to the side with confusion.
“I- I thought I was at the bottom. I saw you. Right there. At the bottom too. Reaching for me and all I wanted was to respond even if I didn’t know how and I still had this… this rage inside me. I always did. My walls were up but… I wanted to reach back. So much.
“In fact, I was wondering if you’re up for today? Noon?”
‘I love him.’
“That’s the one thing. That’s on Mondays. I also… enrolled in a seminar. For anger management. Every Thursday at 5, after work. And I renewed a gym membership. It’s close to here. They have a program, for veterans, initially, but they accept some referrals too. It’s to diffuse anger and stress through exercise -or some other fancy wording” He stops to catch his breath. “Point is… This thing will have the chance to be out of me”
“It takes time. I know.” He feels the edges of his lips tug up again, just a little.
He returned six months too late. To find that the ashes he had left behind had been scattered by the East wind, and that nothing new had sprang from the ground beneath them.
“I’m alright.”
Mrs. Hudson mumbles something like “Alright, dear”, and focuses on soothing Rosie, bouncing her carefully on her good hip.
John had bent over the sink, head hanging, palms gripping had enough to crack it. He was shaking. Sherlock’s shoulders had fallen, his back straightened. Fear had gripped tight around his diaphragm and squeezed.
It’s then that John’s gaze shifts. It is then he notices.
Rosie reaches up for him.
“Okay. Alright. That’s fine.”
“What could she be hiding?”
His chest opened up free at the pride he suddenly felt pooling in. Pride in himself. For once. Even for just a tiny moment.
“So... slept well?” He repeats, nervousness effectively reined in with a simple utterance of his name by that brilliant mouth.
“Every day?”
“He looks a bit plumper! You’ve been feeding him up, John, haven’t you?”
“I don’t like talking about it”, John grunts, holding the plate tilted for Honeybee as she tries to scoop up the last of the potato mash from the edge of the shallow plate. “There’s only so much fake pity I can stomach, you know?”, he laughs, but it sounds as if he has bitten into a lemon.
They talked little. Sherlock’s eyes travelling from his food to John and back. The other man would smile at him, tiredly, but his eyes would crinkle softly at the edges, after the way of his true smiles -which Sherlock knew so well, but whose memory had faded, turned foggy and distant. ‘When was the last time?’
For the speech therapist appointment. Drowsiness evaporates at the thought, worry taking its place.
John’s fingers work deftly. One last pull and his shoulders are free from the weight of the carrier and his daughter. He pulls her out, gentle and slow, not caring if the carrier will fall on his feet, not caring about the world anymore. She pushes against his chest, expecting him to pull her in for a hug, which she doesn’t want. She needs space. A safe space.
They had just finished dinner. John was washing the dishes in the sink, Sherlock gathering Rosie’s toys from the living room. Now he raises his eyes and their gazes lock from across the room.
“So what? You never really cared to contradict them either.”
Sherlock opens his mouth to protest, but is silenced when John actually takes a hold of both his legs and repositions them over his thighs. “There”, he seems very satisfied with himself. “Stubborn git”.
Ten days of Sherlock barely breathing when John walked into the room. Pursing lips, acting normal, hiding.
“Please. It hurts”
There is nothing. Nothing in the world that could change the feelings pouring from their eyes when they look at each other then. And John has never felt anything like it.
“Wha- What happened?”
“I owe you an apology -but trivialities are scarcely of any use now. I understand my behaviour two nights ago was immature and irresponsible. It is something you should not be subjected to, especially now, given the burdens you carry. Your requirements for recovery cannot possibly be met while I am sharing your space”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank you.” He manages and turns to Sherlock with a sharp exhale. “Alright?”
His hand is shaking and the flashes of memory that make his heart burn and his body crumble with guilt are not utterly gone. The key is somehow by miracle fitting into the lock. His feet following straight lines are another paradox he doesn’t know how to explain. Maybe they don’t. He leans against the wall, feels trails of wetness over his cheeks but can’t wipe it away. A palm is pressed against his left shoulder. A hiss leaves his lips between clenched teeth.
“Mm?” Sherlock almost doesn’t acknowledge him, lost in thought.
He hesitated. He had been relaxed when they started, but…
“No trouble at all, Dr Watson. Actually, since this is your daughter, we better not confuse the little girl too much. If we’re going to have regular meetings, I will get to know her and you too, but let’s establish this. May I call you by your first names? It will be easier for us, but her most of all. You can call me however you like and Rosie can call me however she likes too as we go on. Doctor Chloe or just Chloe or Miss or anything, I’m okay with most.”
“We’re so empty it’s spooky. I really preferred the toes in the microwave to… this”, John indicates the barren bookshelves, desk, kitchen. Sherlock’s heart swells. “We can start with this for now, if you want it”, John adds, gesturing to the tome.
John is the one who helps Honeybee eat, and he cleans her up afterwards before he rushes to get dressed for work.
It’s better.
He is floating.
“Oh, Rosie, darling…” John’s lips rested over the sunny curls.
The water keeps running and running and John hasn’t noticed.
“It’s good to see you, John.”
“Uh… nno.” There’s a frown in Sherlock’s voice.
Warnings (as always present in general form in the tags but repeated here for the particular chapter): panic attack, depression bout.
“Booba?” A tiny little daring whisper. A tiny little palm extended, tiny little finger poking at Lestrade’s cheek and withdrawing with a whine, looking up at John with clouded eyes.
John’s shoulders tense. Here it comes again. He feels they are going in circles. She has nothing better to do than to crush his newfound confidence of being able to be a father. She has nothing than words. Threats that will never come to fruition. Why can’t she take one ‘no’ and be done with it? Why does she need to control someone’s life to feel herself accomplished?
He lets her play for a little more before going about that schedule. As he watches her eat –and try to feed him, yet again- he remembers John’s wistful glances toward her as he was preparing to leave for his therapist appointment. Honeybee had fallen asleep a little after he had brought her upstairs from Mrs. Hudson’s, so the two had not had much time to interact –and during the little time Honeybee had been awake, she had been both reluctant and eager to be near John, the mood shifting with his every word, gesture, change in the pitch of his voice. Even though neither Sherlock nor John would mention it, they both knew she was weary of another angry outburst from her father. And those stolen, wounded glances of John towards her before he left bore all his painful knowledge of this.
She whines, not pleased at all. He hums a tune, letting his fingers run over her little torso, which slowly has been losing some of her roundness. Her eyes are open now and she’s nibbling her elephant’s favourite ear. Her eyes are so teasing, taunting him with her secrets. He’s pretty sure she does that look on purpose. She knows exactly why and how and when and she’s perfect at it, because all John wants to do now is get her a thousand pink elephants.
Please don’t have a tantrum honeybee, not now, please, please- Her wailing was not loud as much as it was heart-wrenchingly sad. And nothing would work on her, not even his humming her favourite lullaby, cradling her in his arms, talking to her. Nothing. But why? What was wrong? What has
“No. Right. You wouldn’t”
“John.”
In the kitchen, he switches on the cooker hood light. It’s a comforting, warm orange. He basks in it, for some moments, closing his eyes. Then settles on the kitchen table, looking toward the sitting room. The curtains are drawn, not letting streetlight in, so the outline of the furniture is only barely there, another layer of shadow.
“Hm?!” Sherlock’s eyes shoot up.
Oh, Molly. Only if you knew…
They walk down the few steps to the street, and Sherlock huddles in the warmth of his coat against the morning chill.
“Nah, it’s alright.” He rubs his index on his jumper, settling. “In fact, I probably needed this sooner rather than later.” A nervous chuckle.
John’s breath catches. His fingers twitch, his hand goes limp, fighting to escape Sherlock’s grip.  Sherlock does not relent, but brushes over John’s other hand instead, where it is still locked around the silver tufts as harshly as their entwined hands on the raven curls. “It hurts”, Sherlock says again, pulling John’s wrist. “Stop”.
Sherlock jerks back to reality. John's eyes flutter toward him, spare a moment on some unspecified point on his face, and then withdraw again, a pair of startled birds. Sherlock fights the urge to nibble on his lower lip.  "Good morning", he murmurs slowly, and takes a step back and to the side.
Since Honeybee was staying with her father in the upstairs bedroom, something needed to be done for the stairs. It was Hudders that pointed it out.
Now, there are no shadows, no deeply in thought expression. The features are sharper even, accentuated by the almost non-existent diet, the jawline fuzzy from the auburn over-growing stubble, the shoulders slightly fallen, teeth biting on the inside of his lips. John can almost feel them dig into his own, foggy metaphors from last night sure to make their existence known into his subconscious.
“It was- It was my fault. That.” The admission doesn’t hurt as John expected it to. He feels lighter. “For a few months. Up to two months ago. She didn’t have a constant parenting figure or caretaker. That’s when she…” Still, his throat is clogged up. He looks over at Rosie, rubbing against Sherlock’s knee to hide from Chloe’s gaze every time the Doctor looks on and smiles, but it’s more bashful than fearful now. Sherlock’s eyes seek his and John lets them meet.
“Do you have any explicit indication that it doesn’t?”
“Okay… How about…” With his free hand, John cups his face, just as lightly as before. “This okay?”
She stretches a hand to Sherlock. John bites his lip, tries to ignore, to focus on his phone. He can’t unstrap her in the middle of the street. This is a residential area but even so… His heart is beating wild at the thought. The looks. The judgement. Her eyes. Her hurt. Her whines. All her signs that something is wrong. Asking him to change, to adapt, to help her. More. Too little. Too much. More. She needs more. She needs what he can’t give.
“Thanks.” He managed. Grainy. Sandpaper.
Sherlock turns to place a pan full of scrambled eggs on the table, a spatula held between his teeth. He takes it out and licks his lips before giving John a small shrug.
“Won’t happen again.” John deadpans. He’s aching from the inside. If it were to happen again, he would find a way to stop it once and for all. No matter what.
“And why is that?” Lower lip almost stuck forward, the expression of a petulant child. John is incredulous.
“No. No. We can’t” Final. Definite. It’s impossible. It’s
A message to stay away.
Forget. Forget. Forget, damn it!
am not good for you”
“Well, I comforted her.”
He can’t block it out. The rage. At himself. He is quite obviously unworthy of acceptance. Guilty. They find him guilty. He can’t possibly expect for his attempts to matter. He cannot matter. For anyone. Any step towards reciprocation would eventually lead to rejection. His care is not enough. His feelings -unannounced, hidden- can never be enough. He
“Already settled. We have enough food for a battalion in the fridge”
It takes a little while, but John steps closer. Takes a seat opposite him and reaches for his mug. His left hand is steady.
Cutting. Words eloquently thought of and strategically placed, falling into pieces as John’s whole world does.
little flower, taking a midday nap. John’s hours don’t agree too much with hers but he means to amend that the soonest possible.
“Mm… I think it’s done its work.” He redirects his attention and so Sherlock’s also. “Let’s put a dressing on, shall we?”
‘Y-yeah…’
Sherlock pours water into the mugs, lets the teabags steep. Adds milk and some sugar to John’s, keeps his plain. He places the mugs on the kitchen table and takes a seat, blowing on his tea to cool it.
not about
“I don’t know what breed it is, my sweet. I’m sorry.”
His head tilts. He pushes a plate to Sherlock.
Sherlock reaches, his fingers coiling around it. John lets him. Rosie is not going to stay quiet for long after all. Not that quiet is what John wants. It’s his next nightmare on the list. He just wants, needs, hopes for calm. Just calm. Why can’t he help her be calm? John’s fear starts becoming a reality. Of her crying, exposing his incompetence, labelling him. Stupid. It’s stupid. He’s stupid. He shouldn’t think or feel like that. He should focus on her. On her needs. Instead of what he is lacking. He’s not meant to be a father. A proper one. But he can learn. Can’t he? He has learnt over the past years. Has tried. Has given up. He can try again. His failure is not a given. He recognises his wrongs. He can fix them. He is trying.
“John?”
“Thank you.” John mouths, breath ghosting over the top of Rosie’s head.
“Hello?”
Besides, Sherlock has accepted John is permanently lost to him (remember?). John was noble enough to save him from Culverton. But not even he could be noble enough to feel Sherlock mattered more than that (no one could be). He did not visit him in the hospital again, for Christmas or New Year’s (why would anyone want to see a drug addict in the throes of withdrawal, anyway). When Sherlock was allowed to return home, John had agreed to have a ‘shift’ in the meagre troop of people who would come to see Sherlock for the first few days to make sure he was doing okay (and was not tempted by the sweeties), but Sherlock does not know how this was arranged, or by whom -or how and why John had agreed (most probably because there was no one else to fill a gap in the schedule).
It all boils down to a very simple fact; there is a stronger fix he needs. A stronger drug. But it’s the one he is no allowed to have, one for which years of half-measures and substitutes have done nothing. He might as well admit defeat;
“She’s our little Rosie.” He interrupts.
Both his daughter and an open-mouthed posh consulting detective turn to him in surprise and John keeps giggling, walking towards them.
The world tilts on its axis and John’s eyes water. He brings a hand to his mouth, muffling whatever was about to come out of his lips. His little Rose stands proudly in front of their fridge, a wide smile on her face, playful tufts falling over her temples. Her gaze so direct, straight to the camera of Sherlock’s phone -or more accurately, on Sherlock- that John has to steady himself on his examination bed. She’s happy and her small drawing that might seem so childish, amateur and clumsy to anyone else, is a masterpiece on her father’s eyes.
John hums and points at a man fifty yards away, changing the subject, wanting to keep Sherlock talking in that sweet way he does when Rosie is listening, using multiple words or expressions with the same meaning, so she’ll get the childish gist of it all however she wishes and won’t ever feel left out. He’s like a proud sycamore tree animated by heavy wind, it’s one and only love. Tall and strong, at the mercy of the weather’s wishes for when he could have his lover back, ready to be made to dance.
“Of me? Leaving?”
“She’s not happy at all that I’m here”, John says, in an ironic tone. “That I am here with you”. This time his tone is serious. Sherlock tilts his head to the side. “She called you things”.
But if only that was the case, well, Sherlock’s attributes had not shifted in the least. Ergo, it must be John’s stance that had. The mess they were both in, somehow, made John Watson feel responsible for him. Responsible as a doctor for his patient, a patient he had left maimed after surgery by procedure mistake.
“Forty-eight hours sober, then?” She knew he wouldn’t go to anyone else to help him.
‘How can it be true?’
“Good. Why are you questioning it?”
“Just. One.”
Sherlock walks with his spine straightened sharply, as if he wanted to slice through the air around him, stride sure-footed, chin slightly raised. He must. For John. For Honeybee. He wants to appear strong and proud at their side. He doesn't want them to be ashamed to be escorted by him. John is already doing him a great honour by taking him with them.
“You okay?” Deep, calming purple. Sherlock considers this as he pretends to consider his baguette.
John scrutinises his face; his expression has turned to one of utmost concentration. He’s there, right there, two feet away, and yet it seems as if there’s an ocean between them he can’t cross.
“Oh. That’s… Wow. Thank you”
“Can you breathe?”
“John-”
"Thought we could use the walk", John adds.
He adores her, but nonetheless lets out a sigh of relief when she is downstairs again -and finds that John has done the same.
“Well. Three’s company. Or however the saying goes”, Sherlock shrugs with a small smile.
“What are you doing?” Sherlock lowers himself beside him, eyes narrowed. Rosie’s bag, a thump, as he places it on the floor.
‘Well, he’s you -rather, you’re him. You’re the one supposed to figure it out’
Thank you for reading.
“Yeah. I mean… You’re okay with … This?”
. Rosie will never hear a single shaming or hateful comment from him. Towards anyone. John will not let her life be like his. Harry is wrong. He’s the man, the soldier that whatever power he has, always considers twice before using it. He can be the man he wants to be, the man Sherlock believes him to be. Harry is wrong. He can be a father. A proper one.
John was kneeling before him, gaze lowered, shoulders squared. Apologizing. Asking for forgiveness. Laying his heart bare, like a lamb offering its head to the sacrificial table, trusting it in Sherlock's hands. Sherlock had never been given a heart before.
And the images. Haunted and screeching in his mind like an old door.
“Your fucking love confession of a blog is enough for me.”
‘More like needy like hell.’
Sherlock cranes his head, only to see that Honeybee has landed on her father’s stomach with her knees, hopping up and down and babbling away, a mile a minute.
“John, I need-”
“Alright. Um, coming right back.”
The microwave. Right. He should get that.
John’s heart is hammering inside his chest. He feels he’s been sitting there forever. His leg has gone numb. Sherlock is breathing. Even and slow. Too even. Too slow. John almost can’t feel it. He gets up and walks around the bed, sitting in front of the bundled-up figure. Nothing moves.
