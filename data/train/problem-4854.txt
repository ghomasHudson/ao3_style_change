Castiel glanced down at the one he currently held, rose quartz, and knew it was used to lower tension and anxiety. A small smile spread across his lips. His first session he couldn’t say a word and now he was talking about
“I…” Dean’s voice cracked, nerves getting the better of him. He cleared his throat and began again. “Yes, I’m Castiel’s true mate.”
Dean and Sam shared a look, a grin spreading across their faces before turning back to the trickster. “You’re on,” Sam replied as his grin grew. “And you two are going down!”
“Moi, behave?” Gabriel shook his head as he plucked a pumpkin Reese’s cup out of the glass skull bowl on the dresser. “You are askin’ far too much of me.” He sighed and dropped the wrapper at his feet, munching on the chocolatey peanut buttery deliciousness. “But,” Gabriel shrugged one shoulder, “I like Samsquach, so I’ll give him a pass.”
Dean moved over to the cabinets and opened the first set. “Want me to set the table?”
“But,” she talked over Dean, meeting Castiel’s gaze, “I want you both to be safe and realize that you can say no. You do not have to do anything you’re not ready for,
“Interested in cars?” Dean asked as he straightened up, reaching for a rag to wipe his hands clean. He closed the distance between them, stepping in between Cas’ legs and laying his hands over his mate’s shoulders. “I’ll teach you anything you want to know. It will be a little while before she’s ready for any of that, but I bet we could ask Bobby. He’ll let us know when he’s got a car that needs an oil change or tire rotation.”
Jody reached for the wine refilling her glass. “I thought for
“Very impressive.” Lucifer eyed Castiel a moment longer before licking his lips and spinning back around. “Coming up on the left are the medical labs, and the pharmacy.”
“Not at all,” the Omega whispered. Dean nodded and pulled his hand away slowly, wiping the remaining ointment off on one of the spare antiseptic wipes. “You were very gentle,” Castiel carefully turned to face Dean, “thank you.”
“Mine!” The alpha breathed in deeply, a growl rumbling up from his chest. “Gonna fuck you so hard you’ll feel it for days.”
With one last glare at the framework he was working on, he turned to start working on the engine instead. As he was picking through the tool box, he heard someone coming through the garage and looked up to see Castiel walking towards him with a smile.
“Alright,” he said with a sigh when Cas was settled, albeit stiffly, beside him. Dean had a moment to wonder if the Omega was still pissed off at him, but figured he wouldn’t have come over here in the first place or smelt so calm if he was. Dean scratched at the back of his neck, realizing that he’d picked up on Cas’ scent the moment he’d come over, and filed that away for things to pick apart later.
Dean rolled his eyes and stared at Bobby’s hat. He wondered if he could count every loose thread surrounding the worn holes on the brim… He clicked his tongue, glancing up to see Bobby still watching him, patient as ever.
“I’m working on it, Dean,” Sam remarked, not looking up from his laptop. Ketch continued reading his tome, not bothering with an answer.
Dean swallowed hard and nodded once before leaning into Ellen’s side, resting his head against her shoulder. He heard her hum softly as she wrapped her arm around him, pulling him in close for a hug.
“You wanna bet,” Dean bristled. “Baby would leave your Darlin’ in the dust.”
Ellen took a sip of her coffee, shaking her head. “Are we allowed to kill them? If we kill them, we don’t have to worry about grandbabies.” She eyed Bobby as he took a bite and glanced up at him. “Save that far corner for me, or I’ll be killing you, too.”
“Do you think it will really help?” Castiel asked with tired eyes. “Because with how I feel right now, I’m not sure I will make it through the rest of the school day. And I can’t miss finals.”
“Finn,” Castiel chuckled as he scooted over making room for his pet. The sea lion barked happily when he was able to lay his head in the Omega’s lap. Castiel shook his head fondly and patted his head.
Laughter rang out from the thicket along with the taunt, “Come and get me, Alpha!”
As Castiel continued to survey his surroundings he noticed quite a few stores. One that specialized in slope gear and warm clothing, another that sold a variety of sweets and other treats, there was even a specialty coffee shop.
“Here’s to us.” Dean winked and lifted his bottle, clinking them together and taking a sip. They ate the rest of their meal chatting about various things from work and about the cat until Dean brought up the subject of the ad.
know was that if Dean had known all along? If he’d hid a secret that involved Castiel from him? He better have a really good reason of why. Even then, Castiel found himself realizing that he couldn’t think of one good reason at all. Dean had always said he’d be honest, would answer any of Castiel’s questions, spent hours explaining things to him. Dean couldn't have known, because if he did? How could Castiel ever trust him again?
“Thank you,” Castiel sniffled as he gently set the book down and leaned over the table pulling Gabriel into a hug,“thank you so much.”
“Yeah, right,” the Alpha scoffed. “Like I’m going to believe anything you say.” He sat up to get further away from the creature, but his movements were clumsy, it felt as if his legs were bound. The Alpha’s eyes trailed down his body and he let out a blood curdling scream when his gaze met his bottom half.
“Oh shit, Cassie,” Gabriel whispered, plopping back down into his seat and staring at Castiel as if he were seeing him for the first time. “I half thought my foster parents were on crack, honestly. But…” He shook his head, still staring, and fell silent.
“Ahhhh, Samshine, don’t be like that,” Gabriel mock pouted. “You know you love me.”
“I love you, Alpha,” Ellen whispered, sliding to her feet and finding her mate’s lips. “Don’t spend the day worrying about us; we’ll be just fine.”
“Yeah, he does.” Dean’s eyes locked on Castiel’s as he spoke. “There’s nothing my omega can’t handle.”
Dean jumped as Ellen moved up behind him, her hand gently pressing between his shoulder blades. “Why don’t you help me clean up the leftovers? Gabriel’s parents will be here soon, and Bobby will bring Ash and Charlie home. Then you can go and show Castiel his gift.”
The Omega smiled brightly as Dean’s lips closed around his fingers and took the chili soaked bite of peanut butter sandwich from him.
“Yeah, please.” Castiel smiled at Andrea.
“Well, as much as she’s my baby, she’s only got a small part of my heart,” Dean replied, smirking as he leaned in to give Castiel another kiss. “Are you saying you miss me, sweetheart?”
“Oh man, well,” Castiel said, clearing his throat, “I’ll probably answer to it.”
An animalistic growl tore its way from Dean’s throat as he lunged forward and mounted his Omega. His cock rutted between Cas’ wet ass cheeks before catching on his rim, popping past the tight ring of muscle and sliding in in one smooth, rough thrust. Cas keened and mewled beneath him as Dean ravaged his body, the sound of skin meeting skin, grunts and groans, filling the room along with the thick scent of mating pheromones. Together, they were drunk on it, the perfect atmosphere to bring them together once more.
“You wouldn’t
“Wow!” Gabe whistled, looking between the Winchesters. “You two wasted no time.”
“It just takes practice.” The Omega reached up and patted his mate on the cheek. “I can teach you.” Cas picked up his plate and nodded to Dean’s plate, “I’m going to heat mine up in the microwave, do you want me to do the same with yours?”
Dean took a sip of his beer. He really hoped the cat was too smart to fall for a bag of dollar store treats. Seriously? Ketch couldn’t even spring for the good stuff! Dean knew for a fact the dude had money, he also knew he was as cheap as they came. The one and only time Dean had done landscaping for the man, Ketch had spent the entire time hitting on Jo and trying to talk Dean down to half the price.
,” Lucifer flinched as he quickly fixed his blunder. Alpha Singer wanted to be called Bobby, not Sir.
“Since it’s a mating knot I’m guessing a couple of hours,” Dean replied, equally as breathless as he moved them onto their sides, hissing when Cas’ rim tugged on his sensitive knot. He tried to shift them from the wet area on the bed so they wouldn’t get cold, and he reached behind him blindly for where the comforter had been shoved.
“No and no,” Castiel replied nodding his head to each no. “Now we done?”
“And now we wait.” Dean flopped down on the edge of his bed, motioning for Castiel to join him. The omega sat down beside him, and Dean clinked his beer bottle against Castiel’s. “Good job today, partner.”
“Alright, Sammy!” Dean flipped open the pouch on his utility belt, pulled out the envelope, and passed it over to him. “Open ‘er up and let’s get to work.”
“Great,” Castiel murmured as he scuffed the toe of his shoe on the porch, trying to delay the inevitable. His eyes widened as Dean brought his hand up and knocked on the door.
beat us.” He shot Cas a wink. “Ain’t that right Cassie?”
“Lead the way,” Castiel wrapped his arm around Dean’s waist, “my Omega.”
“No need, the lady at the front desk was extremely helpful.” He held up a key card and Castiel blinked at him with a furrowed brow. “Once I showed her my badge and expressed he was wanted for questioning she not only told me he was staying in the honeymoon cabin but gave the key card to get in it as well, said if he wasn’t there we could just go on in and wait for him to return.”
, to be with
“Yes,” Bess nodded enthusiastically, “it was
“Yeah, yeah.” Cas rolled his eyes, ignoring the smudge on his nose and going back to work.
Ellen smiled as she looked over the kitchen table, all of the kids already sitting down and eating. It was impressive that they’d all been up at the agreed time of 8 o’clock, but the fact they were all dressed and sitting down to eat was a downright miracle. She winked at Jo over Dean’s head and picked up a large thermos of coffee.
“Will you marry me, Dean?” Castiel asked as he took his Alpha’s hand in his. “Marry me, mate me, claim me, breed me. I want it all with you.” Castiel smiled as he watched Dean’s eyes widen. “What do you say, Alpha? Do you want to spend the rest of your life with me?”
The Alpha looked down at Castiel, an unspoken question in his crimson eyes. Castiel’s golden ones met his and he nodded, answering the unasked question. “I’m ready, Dean.” He reached up and cupped his Alpha’s jaw. “I’m yours.”
“Yes,” the four of them answered in unison.
“Dean, Castiel,” Jody said delicately gaining their attention, “you both really should finish eating.” She grinned giving them a wink. “You’re gonna need your strength for later.”
. He struggled for a moment, trying to find something to say, anything at all to fill the silence that would soon become awkward if he didn’t.
he was going to be able to say no.
“Oh boy,” Ellen placed both her hands on the counter and blew out a deep breath, “when one of you kids say that, it's usually something
’, played on repeat in the primal part of Dean’s brain as he rumbled a loud growl and crashed their lips together roughly, closing the miniscule space between their bodies. The sharp tang of blood drove Dean’s inner Alpha and Castiel’s inner Omega wild with want. Looking back, this was always how it was meant to be, and they waited far too long. Their inner beasts demanded freedom, to do as they were born to do, and they submitted to their control as they kissed, bit, and scratched until they were breathless, gasping, and needing more.
Dean peered over his shoulder to look down at the phone. “Enchanted Coffee and Teas.” Dean snorted. “And what's another word for enchanted?”
“So,” Castiel began as he placed a handful of weeds off to the side. “No work for you today?”
“You’re both ridiculous,” Dean said and stuck his tongue out as the cat turned around and showed him his butt.
“I kinda already did, when I got yours.” Dean admitted with a shy grin as he took Castiel’s hand in his as ran his finger along the band. “It’s just like yours except it has sapphires instead of emeralds, and instead of forever yours being in Enochian it’s in Latin.”
The sheriff came over and looked the two of them over. “You boys ain’t gonna get far in those city shoes.”
“More, God please, more Dean!” Cas groaned as the Alpha’s tongue struck his prostate. “Come on, Alpha! Mount me, claim me, make me yours.”
“I run four miles every morning, Dean.” Castiel quirked a brow at him. “Maybe if you’d join me, like I’ve been asking for years, a few flights of stairs wouldn’t put you out of commission.”
“Here Cap’n,” Cas replied with a smirk as he passed the coin to Dean before accepting his hand and help to stand back up.
Rowena studied the Alpha closely for a moment before muttering, “You really do love my nephew, don’t you?”
Lucifer smiled back and nodded before returning to his own journal before him on the bed. For a moment, Castiel wondered what his brother wrote about -- then realizing he wouldn’t want Lucifer to read his private thoughts, he shut the idea away and moved to the door.
“Oh my God,” Cas’ eyes landed on the dining room and his brows shot up, “are you feeding an army, Dean?”
Dean looked over his shoulder for a moment, watching as Castiel disappeared around the corner. For a moment, he wondered what it would be like if he was able to walk Cas to his class, holding his hand the entire way.
“They’re family.” Castiel grinned, his shoulders shaking with laughter.
Castiel dropped to his knees before the chair, pulling Dean’s hands down and making the Alpha’s knee drop back down. “You’re not understanding me, Dean.”
. Come here, Alpha.”
“It started out just the way everything went today, but then you,” he poked Dean in the chest. “Got the bright idea of exploring on our own.”
“Fuck, Dean, I want you so goddamn bad. You smell like heaven, you feel amazing.” Castiel punctuated the words with a roll of his hips. “You always feel amazing, baby.”
“What?” Dean barked, efficiently changing the subject. “Is it a crime now to want to protect people?! You never had a problem with it before we found the bunker. Hell, Sammy, we used to live on the road.” The alpha snatched his duffel from the floor and tossed it angrily onto the bed. “I’m gonna grab my stuff from the bathroom, you best be ready to leave when I am or you're hitchhiking to Iowa.”
“Don’t know.” Gabe shrugged. “That all depends on William here.” He looked over at the spirit. “What do you want first, William?”
“Hey guys,” the Alpha raised his hand and gave a small wave. Just by those few words, and the way he carried himself as he addressed the group, Castiel could tell the man had an air of confidence and dominance about him. The murmurs among the group died down and everyone looked towards the newcomer. “Happy Halloween, boils and ghouls. I’m Luc and I’m going to be your tour guide for today. Looks like we are still a few people short, but that’s okay.” He glanced at the clock on the wall. “They still have ten minutes, so you guys just continue chatting and getting to know your fellow tour mates.”
Worrisome Things like—what if this doesn’t work? What if the connection with the incubus doesn’t break? What if he doesn’t get the chance to tell Castiel how he really feels? That last one scared Dean most of all.
“What? I don’t
“Apparently you remembered too, Dean-o.” Gabriel slapped him on the shoulder. “You big ol’ romantic Alpha you.”
“No problem,” Dean replied as he watched as the Omega drank half the bottle before holding it out. Dean took the drink and replaced the lid, setting the bottle on the side table. “So,” the Alpha shifted on the couch to where he was facing Castiel, “are you ready for me to give you a once over so I can make sure you’re not hurt?”
“Everything okay?” Sam asked after a moment, watching Castiel twist the ankle of his jeans between his fingers.
“Witches, I hate witches! They’re always spewing their bodily fluids everywhere,” Dean hissed as he looked over at Cas. “It’s creepy and downright unsanitary.”
Dean swallowed the roll before answering. “It’s amazing.” He glanced over his shoulder at his mate who was smiling at something his father had just said to him, then back to Rowena with a look of pure adoration in his eyes. “Everything about it is
“I know, I know,” Gabriel sighed as he patted the pups head. “It stinks in here.”
you, Alpha.”
“Shhhhh,” Dean hushed his mate as he gripped Castiel’s waist and fucked into him harder with an impish grin. “Don’t want anyone to hear us, do you?”
“It sounds like people singing.” Castiel reached over and grabbed Dean’s hand. “Listen.”
Jo nodded and looked completely serious as she pulled her feet back and sat normally on the seat, Lucifer scooting all the way over to her side. “Um,” she said slowly, glancing down at his mouth, “how do we do it?”
“I was just saying that once Ketch and I get settled in we will come over to your room since you guys have more sitting space. That is, if it's okay with you.” Castiel tilted his head to the side as he studied Dean. “Your scent again, it smells like… well I can’t quite pinpoint the emotion. Are you really sure you’re alright?”
“I don’t know,” Castiel’s fingers twitched, wanting to reach for the book. “This text isn’t approved by Father Metatron. I probably shouldn’t.”
“Damn right they’re good, I made them.” Cas playfully bragged as he crammed the rest of his cookie into his mouth. “Oh, and that surprise in my bag may or may not be a variety of mini
“Wow! Cas,” Dean whispered in awe as he glanced up at her face. “She looks just like the picture of Mary Lee I saw online.”
ridiculous, Dean.”
“Here you go.” The Omega had been ready, wallet in hand and opened to the place that held his license.
“No where near as good as you.” Dean winked and smirked at Cas. “But I think I could go a few laps without breaking my ass.”
Castiel closed his journal and ran his fingertips across the cover as he mumbled, “We had sex because we wanted to.” He reached over and laced his fingers in between Dean’s giving his Alpha a small smile before meeting Ellen’s eyes. “Because we love each other and because we were ready. I’m sorry if either of you feel we did something wrong.”
shift. I spilled a whole tray of beers on someone, dropped six trays filled with food, and as I was serving one table, the spaghetti on the tray slid off and covered the man at the table behind me. Once that happened, the owner called me to the kitchen and instantly fired me…” He shook his head again as he smiled at Dean. “The owner was my older brother, Gabriel. You know you suck when your
Dean let out a low whistle. “He makes the best damn pies in all of New Harmony. Quite the Trickster though.” Castiel looked to the side, meeting Dean’s eyes. The Alpha looked contemplative, brows furrowed. “Bothers? Seriously?” Dean hummed, giving him a strange look. “Really?”
“That was way
Castiel’s eyes met the Alpha’s and his lips twitched before his smile grew wider. “I assure you we are both capable of smiling.” Castiel reached for another flower as he whispered, “We just haven’t had much to smile about lately.”
“You know it,” Castiel responded sarcastically as he eyed the welcome center, the place the tickets had instructed to go upon arrival.
“Yours, El. I’m on your side, the side of our
Castiel sighed blissfully as he rested his forehead against Dean’s. Out of the corner of his eye he saw his ruined clothing and let out a low groan. “My clothes are beyond a doubt destroyed.”
“Yeah, yeah, I know,” Dean sing-songed, “I’m the best big brother ever.”
Now as a college student, rather than trick or treating it was frat parties and apparently, still, those ridiculous costumes. Why did he continue to agree to this year after year? Oh yeah, his true mate
“I have a Master’s in Business Administration, but I haven’t found anything here as of yet. As for what I’m doing in New Harmony? Well...” Castiel sighed deeply as he reached out, wrapping his fingers around the glass stem of the candle holder. He twisted it around as he stared into the flame.
in the morning.
“Beautiful,” Dean repeated, sliding his hands up Cas’ legs, pushing his thighs apart slowly. Castiel moaned softly, a fresh wave of slick leaking from his hole. Dean met his eyes once, then moved forward, sucking his mate’s cock down in one smooth motion.
“The only thing I asked him to do was to make the ring cursed. That way I could use my ‘cursed or not’ line.” Dean smirked, “that is
“Gabe.” The Archangel turned to Sam when he heard his name. “Before you go do that, you need to stop at the last clue site and change the riddle to lead to the school gym instead of out here.”
“God, yes! Now,” Dean held out his hand, “put that ring on me and make it official.”
Dean shuffled his feet and glanced up, the Omega’s eyes fully golden as he stared Dean down. “I should have told you,” he whispered, shaking his head. “I… I was afraid to.”
He knew the Omega’s nightly ritual by heart now, had it ingrained in his mind from the countless nights spent observing. Which was how Dean immediately knew something was different. Instead of stripping down and sliding into his sweatpants like he did every single night, the Omega began to pace the length of his room. Dean leaned forward, tip of his nose brushing the cool glass of the window, and watched.
“The malachite stone,” Rowena began as she shifted in the sand, getting comfortable. “It means love, happiness, and communication, all the key elements to a successful mateship.”
“Lucifer,” Cas hissed as he jumped up and ran over to his brother’s cot, mindful of how loud his footsteps were as he crossed the small space between them.
Dean raised an eyebrow and met the cat’s sharp gaze. “You’re welcome,” he said, smirking as the cat twitched it’s tail in what he figured was thanks. “Next time you see someone like her? Do everyone a favor - me, yourself, and your dad in there - and just go through that damn cat door. No one wants someone like
“What are you two still doing here?” Triton’s voice thundered as he glanced from Rowena to Dean. “I said I wanted to speak to my son in private.” His Majesty swam closer, pausing in front of Dean and studying him with narrowed appraising eyes. It took everything in Dean not to flinch. “What business would
“You won't be able to feel them,” Castiel shook his head laughing. “We have internal gills. They are located around where you were touching just on the inside of our throat.”
“My Prince,” Inias bowed and waited further instructions.
forget--  nor did he want to. They would learn from it.
Home.
“Yeah,” Dean bobbed his head as he grabbed Castiel’s mug and the carafe. “There was good reason for that to.”
“I’m going to have to talk to him,” he whispered, his stomach flipping at the prospect. “I’ll have to tell him everything. Why I got drunk, why I’m here, the
“Ummm.” Castiel held up the drink and took a sip. “Thank you, it's very good.”
Dean’s eyes blinked open.
“I’ll take care of the sandwiches,” Ellen said, giving him a final squeeze before stepping back. “Why don’t you go apologize to your brother? By the time you all come down, lunch will be ready for everyone.”
“Keep up, Castiel! Remember, tonight is not the night to be alone
“All done,” Rowena replied cheerily. “Oh!” She reached for the three necklaces on the dais and handed them to Dean. “For your family. They are our family now, and welcome in Atlantis anytime. We would love to meet them.” She leaned into him, “I want to see them at your mating ceremony, and I’m sure it will be soon.”
“Hey,” Mick whispered as he carefully approached the Omega as if he were a spooked animal that would bolt at any given moment.
“Alright,” Dean pulled his wallet out and pulled out five one-hundred dollar bills and held them out to the Omega.
“Dean-o,” Gabriel rolled his eyes and continued in his best deadpanned tone. “Your bedroom smells like this is where sex came to die.” The sea lion barked in agreement, before sending one last glimpse, and a couple petulant barks at the mates, before darting from the room.
Castiel let out a shaky breath as he left the bathroom. He slowly walked down the hallway, making his way back to the living room and to his True Mate who was waiting. Hell, they had so much to talk about... He didn’t know where they would start.
.” He popped a curly fry in his mouth, chewing it up before continuing, “The Winchesters, hunting illnesses, saving lives. The family business.”
Lucifer turned his head around, leaning his arm over the seat. “I can help you study, Cas! I am loving organic chemistry.”
Triton regarded the pair for a moment before he spoke. “Tell me how you knew Dean was your true mate.”
Cas shrugged. “I’m not the kind to beat around the bush.”
His stale breath is dreadful and will knock you dead!
Dean let out a content sigh as the aroma of the sweet yet spicy pumpkin pie filled his senses like a siren's song. As the Alpha was debating digging in to it and just baking another for tomorrow, his cell phone rang. Dean snatched it off the counter. He grinned when he saw it was his little brother calling and all thoughts of devouring the pumpkin pie were momentarily forgotten as he answered.
Dean tore his eyes away from Ellen, unable to look her in the eyes as he battled with both excitement and embarrassment. He cleared his throat, shifting on his feet. “I… Ellen, I just want to help him. Please, let me help him. I can control myself, I promise.”
“Castiel,” Lucifer gasped as he moved forward. “What are you doing?”
Dean snorted and shook his head. “How about we make things a little more interesting?”
“But,” Castiel furrowed his brows, “they are back home, under our tree.”
Swinging over the back of the tree root, Dean retched, tears springing to his eyes as his stomach revolted.
Dean moaned as he slammed in deep and ground his hips, fingernails cutting in his mate’s skin and leaving behind deep crescent shaped marks on Cas’ hips. He shivered as the Omega’s hole tightened and spasmed around his knot, milking it as it swelled to completion.
getting to read His true words, His teachings, without the filter and spin Father Metatron put over them. It has made me realize how blessed I truly am.”
“Hey, Aunt Ro, have you seen Cassie?” Gabriel called out as he swam into the room, pausing in his movement as he caught sight of the trio at the table. His eyes narrowed as they landed on the strange Alpha sitting far too close to Castiel. “Who the hell are you?” Gabriel barked out as he scented the air, his next words coming out in a growl, “And why the hell do you smell like my little brother?”
it had felt.
“Oh, yeah,” Sam nodded, “dude totally wants to hook up with you.”
“Jesus, Sammy, what are you doing?” Dean glared at him, sitting down heavily on the bed and effectively on Sam’s outstretched legs.
“Yeah.” Sam nodded as he picked up the photo to study it closer. “I thought it was just the state of the body due to the elements. Were
The slap of skin on skin seemed loud in the otherwise silent room. Cas’ hand tightened on Dean’s hip as his other continued to stroke the Omega’s cock. Dean cried out beneath him as he fucked himself back onto the Alpha’s thick cock then forward into the tight tunnel of his mate’s slick fist.
“Sounds like a plan. Hey, Cas?” Dean wrapped his arm around his mate’s shoulder his inner Alpha preening when Castiel snuggled closer. “Since we have some time to kill can I ask you a question?” When he felt his mate nod against his chest he continued, “How can Merfolk see so well at night, in the dark of the sea?”
more.
“Not quite,” Dean snorted into his mug as he side eyed Castiel with a smirk and mumbled, “but we did spend the night in a cave.”
Castiel huffed, “I think your omega has no idea what
They ate in companionable silence for a while before Dean broke it. “So,” he cleared his throat and glanced across the table at Cas, “you ready to start the whole ‘getting to know each other’ portion of the first date?”
“It’s hard to explain,” Castiel moved to the edge of the window bench and leaned forward, whispering an apology when it roused Finn from a deep slumber.
“That I do understand.” Lucifer nodded as they picked up the pace. “Heats can be rather painful. The cramps and aches and pains can be down right unbearable at times...” He glanced over and met her eyes. “During my first one I really thought I was dying.”
He paused by the tree next to Cas and threw his head back, howling at the moon before turning his attention back to the Omega with a fierce but playful smirk.
“You guys just leave that to moi.” Gabriel winked as he popped a blue raspberry jolly rancher in his mouth. “I will have the place ready to go before you guys can say ‘Happy Halloween’ three times fast.”
“Yes, they are,” Castiel responded as he looked over his shoulder at Sam and Dean.
He was totally on board with smelling freshly baked peach pie for the rest of his life.
good for you.”
Rowena swam over to Gabriel as Dean and Castiel each placed a drop of the potion where she had instructed. She wrapped her eldest nephew into a hug and whispered in his ear. “Keep them both safe.”
“How come?” Dean asked as he straightened back up, giving his full attention to his mate.
Dean snorted as he eyed the assortment. He matched her smirk as he reached past Gabriel, grabbing a California roll, and popping it in his mouth. “Mmm,” he moaned as he chewed.
mate. All the qualities you just named make you a wonderful Alpha.” Castiel removed his hand and placed it back in his lap as he continued talking. “You’re hardworking, you make the
“Please,” the Omega mewled as he pushed his ass back into his mate’s large hands. “So wet, all for you, Alpha.”
“I’ve got these, Dean. Why don’t you grab the sheets?” she smiled gently at him and Dean felt his stomach twist.
The Omega snorted at the Alpha’s protective streak. “I’m sure I can manage on my own,” he replied dryly.
Dean shook his head and cleared his throat. “I, uhm, well I-” he stammered and the Omega’s smirk grew.
“I was shocked that Luc would say such things to me. At first I felt shame and those ugly feelings about Omega’s being wrong reared their ugly head. Well, until,” a small smile graced his lips, “until Dean stood up for me. Then I realized if I wouldn’t have been an Omega I wouldn’t have been Dean’s True Mate. And that got me thinking about the Bible Gabriel gave me and how we all are made the way God wants us to be. So,” he shrugged, “I reminded myself I am the way I am because that’s how God wanted me to be.”
“Not quite right?” Sam finished as he took his brother's side, eyes dropping to the smashed glass.
“What the shit, Charlie?!”
The Omega’s blue eyes slid up from the page and met Dean’s. “It sounds like it could be fun, Alpha.” He returned the smile and placed his finger between the pages to mark his spot. “So does staying here tonight and relaxing.”
“Thanks for taking me up on my offer, Cas. There’s no one else I’d rather be sitting here with.”
“I quickly removed my necklace and refastened it around your throat. Then I pressed my hand,” Castiel reached up again and placed his palm against the pearl, “here. And I said, please save him. I wish to save my mate.”
On West Main Street, Gabe and Sam started at one end with Cas and Dean on the other. When they met in the middle, there hung Roger Jones with his black femur bone. Sam was able to reach it and pull the magnetic bone down so they could read the clue tied with the orange string. At his feet was the jack-o-lantern and Cas stooped down to dig through it until he held the blue coin in his hand. He stood back up and passed it off to Gabe as they all listened to Dean read the next riddle.
“Way ahead of you.” Ketch pulled a vial of shimmering silver liquid out of his jacket pocket. “Early this morning, while you two were, you know,” the alpha waved his hand, “I was meeting with my witchy contact in this area. This,” he held the potion up, “it will mask Castiel’s mated scent for three hours. Oh and,” he pulled out another vial of liquid and met Castiel’s eyes, this one mimicking the color flirt. “Since the venom no longer has any effect on you, pour this in your drink and your lips will change, gradually darkening over time, and it will give your eyes that glassy tint. Even if your mated scent is muted, but your lips don’t change color, and your eyes don’t glaze over, that would be a red flag to the incubus. One more,” he pulled out one final vial, this one orange, “this is the antidote to the flirt potion, you drink it and bam, your lips and eyes are back to normal.” Ketch grinned as he looked at the others. “So we’re all set.”
“Well,” Gabe glanced from where the spirit stood then over to the others, “don’t gotta tell me twice.” He snapped his fingers, transporting the group outside by Cas’ car.
and flesh and blood and bones are fryin’.
Over the next five years, Dean made good on his promise to show Castiel all the wonders the world had to offer. Castiel spent time, not only enjoying, but also photographing and chronicling their trips to add to the Atlantis library when they returned. Their leave-taking this time had been a bit more emotional—everyone knew it would be longer in between visits.
“Okay!” Cas beamed. “Gimme, gimme,” the Omega was practically vibrating in his seat as he made grabby hands towards the gift.
“Ketch.” Castiel rolled his eyes and poked his partner in his side. “Make yourself useful and go get our bags from the trunk.”
“Fuck, I’m so close,” Dean moaned into Castiel’s mouth as he moved his hips at the same flow of his Omega’s hand.
“Just because it’s not midnight… doesn’t mean I can’t kiss you now,” Dean whispered.
Retrieve your next clue at Heaven’s gate.
He set the cup down and reached over, placing his hand on the Omega’s. “I woke up late this morning. I didn’t have time to make coffee because I had a shipment coming in and had to rush in time to beat the truck here.”
Still, it felt weird not to be heading out to where they were at and sharing the workload with them. Maybe he could catch up on some payroll…
“Thank you, Eileen,” Dean signed as he spoke.
“Maybe just a little.” Dean admitted as his thumb stroked his Omega’s sharp jawline. “But only because you get all cuddly.”
Dean chuckled as he pulled out their chairs, taking the basket from his mate and setting it in the center as Cas took his seat. He served them both generous slices of lasagna and leaned over to kiss Cas once again before sitting down.
Dean nodded but made Castiel sit down anyways, as he closed the scrapbook and put it away. The Alpha grinned again and looked over his shoulder. “I put the article about Crowley in there.”
In fact, it sent a playful shiver down Dean's spine as the music changed, and he watched as Castiel’s azure eyes closed, his knees bent as he slid down Ketch’s frontside like a stripper. A very hot, muscular stripper who’s embracing the wrong guy.
“I saw them,” Dean nodded as he thought of the cookies in question. They were homemade sugar cookies, cut into the shapes of candy canes and stars. But not a single one of them resembled a star or candy cane, they looked more like misshapen blobs in Dean’s opinion. And the icing? The icing appeared gritty and lumpy. God only knows what they tasted like. He’d definitely dodged a bullet there, not that he’d tell Castiel that though. “They looked amazing. I really wish I’d gotten to try one.”
Dean chuckled and kissed him again, reaching down to take his hand and thread their fingers together. “I smell bacon,” Dean commented as he tugged him forward. “Jo’ll eat it all if we don’t get down there.”
The Omega gasped as Dean’s cock hit that special spot inside of him sending waves of pure euphoria throughout his body, lighting him up like a Christmas tree and causing slick to spurt around the Alpha’s thick cock. Cas’ hands clenched and unclenched against Dean’s shoulders as the Alpha picked up the pace.
“Sheriff Williamson, Deputy Bradford,” Sam nodded, “we’ll be in touch.”
Castiel put the movie in the Blu-ray player and flopped down on the couch beside the Alpha. “You know what, Dean?”
“Okay,” she scribbled it down on her paper before looking back up at them, “and what’s your team name?”
If you need protection they’ll give you a hand.
Dean relaxed back into his seat. Like this, with his mate’s hand in his own and only the
Bobby and Ellen Singer fell in love and mated in their twenties, close to Bobby's True Mate Mary Winchester and her mate, John. Together, the Singers had a daughter, Joanna, but due to complications, we unable to have any other children. They filled the need to have more children, knowing they could help kids in various situations, by becoming Foster Parents and have fostered many kids over the years and through Joanna's life. When Mary died, John took it hard and after a few challenging years, the Singers decided to convince him to let the Winchester Boys, Sam and Dean, stay at their house while John focused on his work.
But... will those Alphas deserve to meet that kind of fate? And what about all those who came before, the ones his fellow Omega Sirens had sang into an early resting place? There were both good and bad land Alphas, just as there were good and bad Mer-Alphas. Castiel knew both counts from personal experience.
“C’mon baby,” Dean reached around and took a hold of Cas’ rock hard cock. “I want you to come for me.”
mad. It’s a figure of speech, you know?”
Castiel raised an eyebrow and Dean half expected some type of comment about the Spanish Inquisition. But, Castiel simply declared, “I can do that,” and sat back to wait for Dean as he disappeared down the hallway.
“Well what about you?” Castiel asked as he leaned into Dean’s touch. “And how long will we be like…” Castiel trailed off as he looked down at their joined bodies, “this?”
“Just so you know,” the Archangel winked at Sam and barked out an evil sounding laugh, “I’m coming up with
Castiel frowned as he looked back to the desk. Did Dean really expect that poor decrepit desk to support their weight? By the amount of dust on it the thing has been neglected for years. The Omega cringed when he noticed how the wood on the desktop was cracked and sticking up at odd angles. No way was his bare ass touching that desk. Not only was it unsanitary, but splinters! Before the desk gave way and collapsed under their weight, he would surely get a fair amount of splinters.
, been too busy pining after you. Unless you…” The alpha trailed off.
“Really?” Dean asked eagerly as he reached for the box, pulling it closer to him.
sized candy bars. Oh! Speaking of candy!” Gabriel grabbed the plastic pumpkin and shook it. “Who wants goodies? Most of the candy bars are fun sized, like me!”
“Really,” Castiel snuggled closer, “four times wasn’t enough, you want to go again?”
“I want you to
might even give us a discount, it’s not like they have any other customers!”
Dean forced himself to laugh, looking down at his desk. There were so many things he
more fun, because he ran off to bat at those, letting Dean go back to his work.
“Yes,” Castiel nodded trying his best to stifle a laugh. “You still have a penis, Dean.”
knot the Omega was finding pleasure with, not some silicone substitute; and instead of fucking the tight tunnel of his fist, his cock should be buried and knotted in the hot heat of Cas’ body.
As the Omega was bringing the plates back to the island he caught Dean eating the ice cream straight out of the container
Castiel took his arm, “There will be more food than you’ve ever seen, but first,” he propelled him forward, “we need to introduce you to father, so he doesn’t think we are keeping you from him.” The Siren gave Dean a small smile, “He can get suspicious over the tiniest things sometimes. So, better now than later.”
Doctor Shurley nodded for a moment, then broke out into a wide smile. “I have to be honest with you, Castiel. I am both amazed and proud of your progress. Pulling from the sources available to you -- the people you care about, the Bible Gabriel gave you -- were great tools at your disposal and I’m glad you utilized them in that way. Are you still reading passages from the Bible before you go to sleep at night?”
Castiel nodded as Ketch reached into his blazer pocket and pulled out the vial of silvery liquid, passing it to his partner. The omega unscrewed the small silver cap and was getting ready to drink it when he felt hands on his.
“Dean Michael, are you honestly going to sit there and tell me the two of you didn’t have sex?” Ellen whispered harshly, watching as Dean swallowed his words, his face immediately turning a bright shade of red. “You realize that I could smell what happened in that room the moment I walked by the doorway, right?”
After goodbyes were said and plans were made to meet up for breakfast in the morning Dean shut and locked the door. The alpha turned and met his mate’s heated gaze. “Just you and me now,” Dean rumbled as Castiel pressed flush against him, knocking him back against the door.
They burrowed into the sand and Dean pulled Castiel flush against his body. The Omega smiled and pressed a kiss to Dean’s lips. Castiel purred and nuzzled his mate’s jaw before fluttering his eyes at him alluringly. Dean chuckled softly and shook his head, telling his mate his bewitching wiles were not gonna work on him. Castiel pooched his lip out and Dean nipped it, promising him that they would be together soon, once they received his father’s approval. The Omega smiled and whispered his agreement and as he snuggled against Dean’s chest, his heart swelled with love and admiration. His Alpha had a willing Omega but had said no because he wanted to get his father’s blessing, and Castiel respected him for that. With a few more chaste kisses the mates fell asleep tangled together, their tails entwined.
“Assholes,” Dean grumbled as Castiel shifted them to where they were laying on their side.
Dean snorted and leaned against the railing, shaking his head. “You honestly think you’re going to win over an animal lover like Cas by buying dogs for a one time use? What are you going to do with
“Come on then,” Dean said as he lifted the rake and gave it a shake, the leaves falling off from it and sending the cat into a frenzy as he chased them in a circle. “Chase the leaves blowing in the wind, don’t get under the rake, silly!”
Castiel was elated, ecstatic! Hell, he was on cloud fuckin’
“Mmhm, oh, no doubt.” Dean nodded his agreement, before smirking and rubbing his hands together. “But I’m much more interested in the ghastly characters that grace it now.”
“That wasn’t exactly the kiss I wanted,” Dean grumbled as he smiled over at his giggling mate. “That song Cas,
“I’d love to.” The Omega laced his fingers through Dean’s and bumped his shoulder against his mate’s. “Lead the way, Alpha.”
Castiel let out a soft gasp as Dean’s tongue darted out and ran across his bottom lip, craving entrance. The Omega parted his lips and Dean’s tongue dipped into his mouth, curling around his. The Alpha pulled him closer as he deepened the kiss, turning his head to the side and carding his fingers through Castiel’s hair before resting his hands on the back of his neck.
Dean let out a contented hum as he looked around the shore, sighing softly when he thought about the many nights he spent out here looking for Castiel.
“You made me lasagna?” Dean rumbled against the back his mate’s neck, kissing him gently before turning him around and finding his lips. “Have I told you lately, that I love you?”
“Are the nightmares still coming regularly? I know that you’re thinking about starting birth control, and Ellen has told me you’ve been open to taking Tylenol as needed for pain. I’m not trying to overwhelm you, but I am wondering if Melatonin would help you sleep more sound and therefore, keep the dreams away. It’s an over the counter hormonal supplement that your body produces, so it would only be a bump in your natural aid to help you sleep. Would that be something that interested you?”
“Okay, I’ll start, since this all begins with me.” Rowena sighed as she shifted in her seat. “A little over a year ago I cast a spell.” She folded her hands on the table. “One to find Castiel’s true mate.”
“Yeah,” Lisa nodded in agreement, “it’s not like we don’t have plenty of time. Night’s still young! It’s not even midnight yet.”
A small smile broke out across his lips when he realized where he ended up, the rocky caves at the edge of his property. He wasn’t surprised though, this spot called to his inner Alpha as much as the little cottage had. The waters were relatively still, small waves lapped up onto the shore as Dean bent down and picked up a stone, he rubbed it between his thumb and forefinger the rock smooth from years of wear in the ocean. Dean drew his arm back before swinging forward with a little flick of his wrist, he watched as the rock flitted across the surface before sinking into the dark water.
“Thank you,” Castiel whispered as Dean shook one pill out into his hand. He looked down at it then back up at the Alpha. “You wouldn’t happen to have a bottle of water in your backpack, would you?”
In his haze of daydreaming about all the things he was going to do to his Omega, all the ways he was going to bring him pleasure, have him scream his name, sink his teeth into his milky white throat, the table had been cleared of dinner. The pies Dean had made were brought out along with dessert plates, silverware, two carafes of coffee, and another bottle of wine.
“Dean turned to Castiel and told him, ‘Don’t tell me how to do my damn job man’.” Gabriel blew out this low whistle. “My baby bro
Sam blinked. “Are those my text books?”
Alpha!” Cas shouted, lust drunk on his mate. “Fuck me! I need you! Need your knot, Alpha!”
had met Lisa he could tell the woman had been harboring a crush on Dean for some time. The subtle flirting was irritating, and in Castiel’s opinion disrespectful as hell. While Dean was most definitely off the market, bitten and claimed by his true mate. It seemed to only make him more of a challenge for her. For good measure, and maybe a bit out of spite, Castiel leaned over and planted a chaste kiss to the mating mark on the side of Dean’s neck for all to see.
“Dean!” Castiel gasped in surprise at the sudden change in position.
“How does breathing underwater work?” The Alpha took in a deep breath and released it. “It feels almost the same. A little heavier, maybe?” He looked down at Castiel, “Does that make sense?”
Ketch blew out a low whistle. “Soul mates are extremely rare." He took a drink of his beer before continuing, “Anything else?”
“I killed my Omega, my pups. How can you say I’m a go-”
Dean smiled back and leaned up, meeting Castiel’s lips in a sweet kiss. It was soft, unhurried, and full of so much love. Castiel let out a soft sigh after the kiss ended and he laid his head on Dean’s chest, listening to his alpha’s heart beat, and breathing in the earthy scent of pine and cinnamon as they waited out Dean’s knot. The alpha ran his hand up and down Castiel’s back as they stared out the window, both lost in thought.
kicking my ass.”
“Neither am I,” Castiel furrowed his brows, “especially Chemistry.” He looked up at Dean with wide blue eyes. “Can you help me study for it?”
Andrea playfully punched Benny in the arm and Dean gaped at him. Dean’s shocked look quickly turned into a leer. “Alpha on Alpha action!” He waggled his brows at Andrea. “Think they’d let us watch?”
“My inner alpha got a little too excited,” Dean pressed a kiss to his nose. “My knot’s still full and going strong.”
Alright, then. Dean rolled his eyes and looked back into Cas and Luc’s bedroom, clearing his throat. “I… was wondering if we could… talk.”
As Castiel rounded the front of the car, Dean reached out and took his hand, lacing their fingers together as they headed the short distance towards the center.
He watched.
What he did catch of the Omegas and unpresented children that were rescued from Hanston, was that they were so… quiet. They were always shown with their heads down, hands in their laps, watching their feet where they walked and only answering or looking up when they were spoken to. They also only wore white, which Dean suspected was a cult-rule thing or something. He made sure Ellen had gotten a few dark-colored band tees and dark jeans for the boys, and had thrown in a few of his old flannels, too.
Castiel felt himself blush and he looked down, unable to argue or deny it. He’d been a nervous wreck all day.
“As I told Dean, it reads your intentions.” Rowena began to explain. “You go to the surface with the want in your heart to be on land, your tail turns to legs. You enter the water wanting to come home, your legs turn to tail once again.”
“You’re so cute when you sulk,” Castiel cooed as he pressed a kiss to his mate’s sternum.
Dean didn’t know who took all the air out of the room, but suddenly he was standing toe to toe with Cas and finding it hard to breathe. The Omega’s eyes were rimmed golden, glowing in the dark, and he was sure his own eyes were doing the same. He reached forward, resting one hand against Cas’ hip, the other coming up to touch his face.
take the blue coin, that’s your team’s coin. We want to play fair, right?”
“You’re welcome.” Cas’ inner Omega preened at his mate’s compliment. “How was your day?” he asked before taking a bite from his slice of cheesy bread.
The mated pair ignored the Archangel and Castiel smiled at his mate as he nodded. “That can
“Well, I don’t know!” Castiel shrugged. “Sex
“You honestly expect me to believe you didn’t know what day it was, Cas?” Dean asked, now clenching his hands at his side and searching his mate’s eyes. “You expect me to… to…”
“You wound me,” Lucifer crooned as he placed his hands over his heart. “And here I was hoping we could catch up,” the Alpha purred as he gave Cas a lecherous once over. “If you know what I mean.”
“On the plus side... if you did,” the Archangel smirked against his younger siblings cheek, “the things such a junker no one would be able to tell.”
“I love you too,” Castiel nodded as tears ran down his cheeks. “So, yes, of course, Dean Winchester, I will marry you.”
“Well then,” Bobby clapped his hands together. “Let’s eat.”
Dean nodded his head and laughed, kissing him back more soundly before taking a step back. “If you’re not too careful, we might end up doing round two right now.”
sudden change of topics.
The woman glanced up from her computer, her eyes widening as she took in their appearance and nose wrinkling as their aroused scents assaulted her senses. “Excuse me?”
“Definitely,” Castiel confirmed as Dean held out a bite of pie for him.
Dean eyed the hand warily for a moment before nodding and taking it in his own. “Yeah, okay. No hard feelings. I’m a big brother too, so I understand where you're coming from.”
mug Sam had gotten her the year they married. He smiled as he placed his mug under the Keurig, thinking about the new mug he’d just ordered Jo for her upcoming birthday,
“Oh,” Castiel whispered, his cheeks the shade of a tomato now. “So that
“Uh, just… Dean.” He cleared his throat, waiting for Castiel to glance up and meet his eyes. “Just Dean, please.”
“I...” Castiel nodded as he reached for a pillow and clutched it to his chest. “Yes, you’re right brother, no matter what happens that will be enough.”
“Yes,” Castiel nodded, “that, and to get another one of your special drinks. It was quite tasty.”
“Dean,” Castiel moaned as he twisted in the nest.
“That's archaic,” Dean growled. “No one does Match Matings for Omegas anymore.”
“You can’t tell me what I can and can’t do,” Castiel snarled as he shoved Dean back and stood up. “Move! Get the hell out of my way right now.”
“No thanks,” Castiel snarled as he clutched the incubus’ throat. The omega’s Angel Blade slid out from the sleeve of his trench coat and he gripped the hilt tight. He spared Grayson one final look as he declared, “As you said, you’re a monster, besides I already have the perfect alpha.” Castiel rammed the blade into the incubus’ heart, the light flickered out of his eyes and his body turned to ash.
“Gabriel,” Castiel growled, “I’m trying to drive here! I do not wish to wreck my car.”
“Fill me,” Castiel begged with a roll of his hips.
Castiel took a deep breath once he reached for Dean’s door knob, not even bothering to knock as he swung it open.
“Fuck yes, much better,” Dean groaned as his cock bobbed hard and heavy between his legs, dripping precum.
Lucifer smiled at him softly and they leaned back against the whitewashed wall, silent in the other’s embrace. Castiel didn’t want to ask what His will would be now that there was no family to go to, no one left to help. He wondered where Father Metatron and the other Apostles were now, what would happen to them and the families they’d built.
Dean leaned in and captured his Omega’s lips, savoring the mix of his mate with the sweet treat.
Rowena rolled her eyes as she laughed and placed the tray down. “So,” she took a drink of wine, “what do you think of Atlantis so far?”
Dean thought as he met Castiel’s eyes and plastered on what he hoped was a reassuring and not a I’m-freaking-the-fuck-out smile.
. He just knew she was going to love it. Dean popped a Cafe Escapes milk chocolate hot cocoa K-cup in place before hitting the large cup button and waiting for the water to heat.
“Dean,” Triton sighed and waited until the Alpha met his eyes. “As badly as I want to intervene I can’t. This is a mating challenge and Atlantian law states it’s settled by the Alphas in the dispute.”
Dean’s smile grew as he walked up behind Castiel and wrapped his arms around his mate’s waist, resting his head on Castiel’s shoulder as his eyes traveled the length of the island. A large bone-in spiral ham sat in the middle, golden from the brown sugar glaze and covered with pineapple rings and cherries. Various side dishes surrounded it; a huge bowl of homemade mashed potatoes and a gravy boat filled to the brim, fresh green beans, corn on the cob, hash brown casserole, and a basket of crescent rolls. All their favorites. Then there were the pies,
The bell rang overhead, cutting off Gabriel mid-sentence. He rolled his eyes, grabbing the edge of his tray. “Duty calls, I suppose.” He chuckled and winked at Castiel. “Though, this bell is a hell of a lot better than the chiming one we had at the Playground. I’ll see you tomorrow at lunch, okay?”
“Handmade gifts are always the way to go,” Shurley agreed, smiling at Castiel’s enthusiasm. “It sounds like it was quite a process to make. And you got to spend some time with your foster Father, Bobby? How was that?”
Cas grinned at Dean when the Alpha joined him at the table. “Looks amazing!”
scary,” Gabriel added as he continued to bop in place.
Slick gushed from the Omega as he picked up his pace, his sweet aroma amping up the Alpha’s arousal, and Dean could feel his knot begin to swell with the need to claim. “Fuck, Cas,” he moaned as his blossoming knot popped in and out with a wet squelch.
Castiel’s eyes widened and Dean felt his cheeks flame up. “I, uh, thought I would tell you, because…” He stopped, clearing his throat again and looking away.
Dean was drawn from his musings by the Omega in his arms staring up at him. Was Castiel talking to him?
sex life!” Dean grabbed the iPod and turned the music up. “Let’s party! Benny, toss me and Cas another beer. Hell, after that story, Sammy can have one more.”
“I’m sorry, Ellen,” Dean whispered after a moment, giving her a squeeze. “I will tell him, I promise. I just… I want him to be feeling okay when we talk, have some privacy. I’ll make sure he knows he can ask you or Bobby questions, too, if he needs to… but I didn’t feel like right now was the right time.”
“Oh no,” Jo shook her head, “I don’t need anything.” She leaned against the door jamb as she spoke. “I just came up here to tell you guys mom would like to talk to you both downstairs before she starts dinner. Now that I have successfully delivered her message,” Jo pushed off from the door, “I’m gonna go play video games with Sam and Dean. See ya,” she called out as she flounced down the hallway.
Ellen waited a moment, then shook her head again. “Exactly, Dean. We all want Castiel to get through this as painless as possible, and Lucifer and I are doing what we can to help him. You need to go back to bed and-”
Ellen nodded, leaning forward to press her lips to her mate’s cheek. “I want to help them, Bobby.” Ellen let out a slow breath, shaking her head slowly. She pulled back slightly to meet her mate’s eyes. “I think we can help them.”
“First off I just want to say how sorry I am if you feel I deceived you in any way,” Castiel turned on the couch to better face Dean, “but I felt this was the best way for me to find a mate. People can be so fake to your face, but as a cat?” He gave Dean a calculating look. “I got to see the real them right away.”
“What?” The Alpha furrowed his brow and glanced into the living room then back to his mate trying to figure out what he’d been looking at.
“Yup.” Dean nodded. “That’s me.”
“Alpha,” Castiel chastised as he took another step back, putting more distance between them. “No way are we going to fuck in this dank room at a freaky Sanatorium.”
“That’s not what this is, not at all.” Dean placed his beer on the coffee table and turned to face Castiel. “Even if things hadn’t happened like they did and we weren’t True Mates, Gabe would’ve mentioned you at the diner. Hell, I go there and eat lunch every day, so you and your degree would’ve come up and I would’ve given him my card to have you call me. I promise,” he placed his hand on Castiel’s knee and met his deep blue eyes, “I’m not offering this job to you out of pity or because you’re my True Mate. I’m offering it to you because you’re qualified, hell, with your degree you’re over qualified, and it could be just until you find something else. Plus,” he gave Castiel a small joking smirk, “Jo is shit at running the business side of the practice. I’m afraid she may bankrupt us.”
omega, so give me the goddamn water and back off!”
“I…” Dean started, swallowing hard and looking down at his hands. “I mean…”
Crowley’s eyes widened as if the thought of Castiel hearing him hadn’t even crossed his mind. He quickly schooled his features and turned to face Dean. “At least some of us are Alpha enough to
Dean growled in triumph as his tongue swept in tasting his mate as they traced the contours of each other’s mouths. They kissed as the sea lapped up around them, Finn splashed and barked in the background. They parted only to scent mark, or to pepper kisses along each other’s jawlines and throats.
No matter what was going on with the boys in their house, they would handle whatever came their way and they would do it together.
As Castiel shifted to sit up, Dean held out his hand to Ketch. “I got this.”
“Yeah,” Dean nodded. “But, I wouldn’t totally be giving it up.” At Castiel’s confused look he continued, “I was thinking about turning the bunker into a field base, like what Bobby did but on a larger scale.” The alpha ran his fingers through Castiel’s hair as he continued telling him about his plan. “I’d have a variety of phones set up, each for a different bureau for when a hunter needs verification from the local law enforcement. I’d also search for cases and reach out to the hunters in that area.”
“Bed,” Castiel whispered as he rose off Dean’s lap on shaky legs.
,” Castiel hummed as he swiveled his hips dirtily.
. “I don’t know what that means, but it doesn’t sound like a very good thing, Sam. The Devil is the father of lies, a darkness that you would not want to trifle with.”
Cas growled as he stood up, blowing out the candles and marching up the steps to find his mate and figure out what the fuck that had been about. He thought Dean would be happy, would hug and kiss him. No, he had the nerve to think Cas was joking? As if he would ever joke about something like that.
“Oh my God,” Sam groaned, “can’t you just-”He waved his hand in the air in front of him, hoping the words would materialize and save him from having to
“I got you baby.” Dean pushed up on his haunches and ran his hands down his mate’s chest, stopping at his pebbled nipples pinching them in between his thumb and forefinger, drawing a pleased groan from his Omega’s lips. “I know
“Fuck, shit,” Castiel cursed as he stumbled over a rock, barely righting himself before he face planted. “Why didn’t you bring one of the lanterns, Dean?”
“Checking in?” the lady asked as Ketch and Castiel walked up to the counter, Dean and Sam hanging back, leaning against the wall by the door.
“Bossy,” Dean growled and nipped at his mate’s ass cheek before pressing Cas down onto his stomach, spreading his legs wider as he continued to hold the panties to the side and wiggled his tongue back into his Omega’s hole, scooping out more of his mate’s essence.
Dean nodded, meeting Mick’s eyes and nodding again. He wasn’t interested in getting into a fight. He let his eyes roll over Cas once more, his heart clenching when they passed over the scarred area of his throat, the skin reddened and much larger than Dean’s bite once had been.
The Alpha was in a trance as he continued to sniff the air, following his nose to find the insatiable scent. When he entered the dining room, where the aroma was the strongest, all eyes were suddenly on him. Dean breathed in as deep as his lungs would allow him and as he exhaled slowly, his gaze snapped to the handsome man sitting next to Sam. The delicious bouquet wasn’t coming from some drink, it was coming from -- Dean sniffed again, realizing the man beside Sam was an Omega, meaning he had to be his brother’s best friend slash dormmate, Castiel.
“Don’t mention it,” Rowena smirked as Dean rose and swam towards the gates. “Oh and Dean,” she waited until he turned.
He didn’t grace her emoji meltdown with a response, and instead turned his phone off and put it on the counter behind him. As he turned around again, Castiel was standing with his hands full of things from the fridge and a sheepish expression on his face.
funny.”
“Where’s the free candy?” Gabriel sing-songed, teeth clicking on a jolly rancher in his mouth.
“I didn’t.” At Dean confused look, Cas took a hold of the Alpha’s hand and placed it over his heart. “My inner Omega, it just knew. I’ve known since the moment I laid eyes on you that you were
, he mused as the skater released his hold and lowered his leg before making another lap around the ice. On the man’s second pass by, Dean was hit by the most mouth watering smell. His knees buckled and he gripped the tree to stay upright.
He felt the itch underneath his skin now, knew he would be calling up his rehab buddy Charlie to talk her ear off until the sun had risen, and ached for the bottle in his backseat.
“Awww, Baby,” Dean crooned as he ran his hands through his mate’s hair before cradling his face. “I promise I won’t pick anything to frightening.”
Gabe nodded his understanding.
as his inner Alpha coined him. The nickname became something secret, holding a sense of familiarity, of ownership. No one else called the boy that, not that Dean had ever heard, it was
“I'm coming, I’m coming, hold your seahorses, Castiel.” Came the muffled response from the other side of the door.
“Do you guys want to hear the story or not?” Crowley demanded, a silence falling over the group. “Because in order to hear a story, you all need to shut your traps!” He narrowed his eyes at the others who all smiled sheepishly back at him. “And you gents,” he pointed at Dean and Castiel, “have been playing tonsil hockey for God knows how long now. You’re setting the wrong type of mood. Then there’s poor ol’ Moose… he’s the only one sitting here patiently waiting to hear all about the cursed tree he etched his name in to.”
“Honestly?” Dean asked as he surveyed the man.
“Are you mad at me?” Lucifer whispered, holding his breath as he listened. It didn’t seem like anyone else was listening, small side conversations going on around them in hushed voices as everyone settled.
He pushed off the wall and walked to the center of the room. “One legend states that tuberculosis claimed one patient per hour during the height of the epidemic and that doctors used the tunnel to remove the dead as to not upset the living. Because the doctors believed the patients mental health was just as important as their physical health.”
“Good,” Dean mumbled as he pressed another kiss against Cas’ neck. “Well,
pretty damn good.”
Dean half listened to the conversations being held around him as he ate, not really even tasting the food, just going through the motions. Once dinner was over he would be that much closer to claiming his Omega. But he’s sure the dinner is delicious, he made it after all.
Once they reached the clearing, Castiel pushed back the willow branches and sat down on the large gnarled root before glancing up at Dean, who was standing there wringing his hands together. The scent of anxious Alpha filled the small space and it burned Catiel’s nostrils. Despite his anger, his fingers twitched at his sides, he wanted so badly to reach out and comfort Dean. That just made him even more angry, the fact he couldn’t even be mad properly. He knew giving in to anger was a sin but at this moment he was ashamed to say he didn’t care. This, whatever it was between them, was taking that away from him and he was pissed about it.
“I’m on it!” Gabe saluted and bent down to rifle through the pumpkin. It didn’t take long before the Archangel was standing back up and dropping the blue coin into the velvet pouch.
“Soooo,” Castiel drawled as he met Gabriel’s eyes which was a near impossible feat with how he was practically vibrating. “Pretty much like any other day?”
“Unfortunately,” Castiel blew out an over exaggerated sigh. “We are.”
Cas held his hand out and Gabe passed him the cellphone so he could snap a picture of it. Once the Omega had given the phone back, he read the riddle.
He tapped his finger against the screen, thinking. What the hell was he even supposed to look up?
Castiel stepped inside the bedroom and his breath caught, it was stunning. The deer antler chandelier that hung over the elegant king size wrought iron bed, gave the room a soft romantic glow. Multiple floor to ceiling windows that followed the peak of the house granted them a magnificent view of the snowy mountain tops from any point in the room. The frigid outside was warmed by the cozy blue and red plaid draperies, and the soft tones of the honeyed pine.
“Its at Happy Paws Pet Shop. When we were trying to figure out where the Vampire’s nest was, I questioned one of the associates there - the girl whose boyfriend went missing.” Cas shook himself free from his brother’s grip and continued, “Outside the store there were two trees side by side, and a large web connected them. There was a bunch of tiny spiders throughout the web and a huge one dead center.”
,” Sam huffed, “
“Everything about him,
“We did, and he did.” Dean mumbled as he tossed a broken shell to the side. “And then Castiel and I talked and he wanted me to take some time by myself to really mull everything over.”
Dean tried to pay attention, but found himself shifting his seat slightly to the right and closer to Cas until he could stick his leg a little out into the aisle. As their teacher went over the rules for their midterm -- the same rules they went over with every test -- Castiel responded in kind and stuck his leg out as well, their feet pressed together. Dean smiled, the small presence of Cas being right there with him never failed to make his day.
I know I am!!!!
“Come on, Sammy, Ketch,” Dean barked as he paced the room. “How do we get the incubi venom out of Cas’ system?”
“Father, stop it!” Castiel cried out as he shoved the trident away from Dean and moved his body in front of his mate. “You want a good reason?” He glared at his father, “How about he’s my true mate, the one Alpha meant only for me, the one mother wanted me to find happiness with, the same happiness she had with you.”
“Yeah,” Castiel nodded as he took the phone. He stood there for a moment watching his alpha walk up to the front desk before turning towards the sitting room. It was packed, so logically that was the best place to start. Castiel took one last look at the picture before pocketing the phone and making his way over to the large group of people gathered around the fireplace.
Dean held up his hand stopping his brother from talking any further.
“I’m glad they did,” Dean whispered, watching Cas’ eyebrow raise. “Your life is more important than me, Cas. I’m glad they removed it. It allowed you to move on, to move forward. I’m sure that Mick is a much better mate than I ever would’ve been.” Dean gave what he hoped was a reassuring smile and resisted the urge to rub his forearms, pressing his wrists harder into his knee instead. “You two look good together.”
“I feel like I’m missing something,” Sam said as he looked from Dean to Gabriel then back to Dean.
It was just a dream.
As she swam into the room, Finn flitted past her and launched himself in Castiel’s arms. The Omega smiled and ran his hand down the slope of his pet’s back. Finn had been especially clingy ever since Dean and Castiel had decided to spend some time on land. The sea lion followed them everywhere, and at night wiggled between them in the nest. It was as if Finn
Jo smiled wide and accepted the help up, dumping their collected acorns out and waving her hand forward. “I obviously can’t choose a good spot, next one is your pick. Lead the way!”
She smiled softly, “I can bewitch any necklace you two want. But,” her features hardened to a look of seriousness. “If you two choose that route you have to promise me that you will bring Castiel home often, that you won’t let him get caught up in the wonders of land living and forget about
“Hey! Jerk.” Dean kicked him in the leg. “It’s not funny.”
They wrestled over picking up the books, both trying as hard as they could to maintain the upper hand while staying quiet. Ellen coming in would mean the end of both their lives. Sam managed to get two of the books and clambor back onto his bed, holding them hostage under his butt until Dean sighed in defeat and joined him.
He squinted up at Dean as he replied, “The equivalent of a liquor store.”
“Yeah,” Castiel’s smile lit up the room as he said, “I feel the same way about you, Dean.”
“Well,” Dean smirked as he let go of Castiel’s hand and tapped the mating mark on his mate’s neck. “Kinda thought this already meant I had you locked down, that I get to keep you forever.”
HAPPY HALLOWEEN BOILS & GHOULS!
The dogs whined as they continued to meander around the expanse of Dean’s backyard. Crowley huffed and threw his hands up. “I paid hundreds of bloody dollars for you mutts! Do your damn job and find that cat.” He turned to Dean and quirked a brow. “Is he here, Dean? Is that damn cat here with you?”
“Wait,” Ketch reached up and held Castiel’s chin, “you got a little something." The alpha rubbed his thumb across the corner of Castiel’s lip before popping it into his mouth. “Mmm, ketchup.”
He watched as the crab bustled away before looking up at the castle. His eyes landed on Castiel’s window and he couldn’t fight the smile that spread across his face knowing his mate was there, was waiting for him.
“Goddamn, son of a bitch, cocksucker!” Dean roared as he squeezed the glass in his hand until it shattered.
“No, you don’t get to come in here in the middle of the night, steal my… my biology and geometry textbooks? Dean, what are you doing? Are you feeling okay?” Sam reached up, pressing his hand to Dean’s forehead. Dean fumbled back, trying to push him off, only managing to drop all three books on both of their feet.
“You like the thought of that don’t you, Alpha.” Castiel purred relishing in the fact that tomorrow there would be fingertip shaped bruises branding him. “You’d love for Lucifer to see this wouldn’t you? Show him that no other Alpha could please me like you.”
“Good to know.” The Alpha relaxed in his chair, enjoying the feeling of connection with his mate. He sighed contently. “So where’s this shop of yours located, so I can stop in sometime.”
“Then what about Sam?” Castiel whispered as he ran his fingers back through his Alpha’s hair. “He and Jess have just started a life together. Don’t you want to be there to witness all their joys, like birthdays and anniversaries? When they have children, are you going to be okay missing all that? And Bobby,” Castiel continued, “what about him? You said he was getting up in age and that you wished you could see him more. Living down here that won’t be possible.”
He knocked once, but heard nothing coming from inside. The cat stood beside him, looking up at him with a cocked head.
“So I see they gave you the same info they gave us.” Ketch snapped the file shut. “What did you gents make of it?”
the others like that?” he asked as he flipped to examine all the other autopsy photos. “They are,” he confirmed before Castiel had a chance to answer. Sam slid the file to the middle of the table for the others to see. “But why? How did you know from the coloring of the lips we are dealing with an incubus?”
“Four pies?” Sam quirked a brow at his brother, “Really, Dean?”
