eat way too many burgers and fries.
“Of course you want to check on Bucky, we understand.”
“Yeah no, it’s no big deal, the planes are going back and forth all the time for Pepper anyway. Also, you’re probably going to help save the world in the near future Scott, you don’t need to worry about money. No one on the team does.” He does a little hand flip like he’s telling Scott he can go ahead and order the porterhouse.
“Yes, I will! Thank you Mr. Stark, and you, Mr. America… er, Mr. Rogers? Wait no, there’s already a Mr. Rogers…”
Tony’s nostrils flare and he reaches out to grab a fist full of hair at the base of Steve’s head and pulls him forward.
Tony forces himself to listen to what Steve is saying, even though, again,
He’d always figured it was his body trying to desperately conserve the little energy he had, but it was the one thing he liked about his pre-serum body. When he was out, he was out.
Tony balks. “What do you mean least surprising?! I was with Pepper five months ago! Five months ago Steve and I almost killed each other! Don’t do that thing you do where you act like you knew when you didn’t.” Tony is pointing at the screen, playfully accusatory.
Tony wants this, more than he can fathom given he’s only just been made aware it’s possible.
“Scoot up a little, rest your head on the pillow. I want you to watch me get ready for you.”
Steve is about to protest further, but Tony interrupts. He can’t really hear what Steve has to say right now. He can’t hear Steve try to explain why he didn’t tell him sooner. He is liable to say something really scathing… or really pathetic if he has to talk to Steve about... he is not fucking dealing with this right now.
Six weeks post-snap Thor is almost recovered, and he is preparing to join the Guardians of the Galaxy in whatever adventures they find in space. Thor would be happy to stay longer, but Quill and the others are getting anxious to leave.
Whenever Steve is in the room she automatically runs up to him, barking for him to play with her or scratch her ears. Steve is almost always happy to oblige, and on the rare occasion he is trying to do something important (finding the channel with talking the Sponge in the Pineapple is important!), her helpless whines and dejected lowered tail make him give in soon enough.
“Oh my god Tony, I’m so sorry. Oh my god…”
Steve moan-cries into Tony’s mouth. Pressing his mouth closer to get more of Tony’s lips, and his ass out to get more friction on Tony’s finger.
“Yep, I had Friday order one and it should be waiting for you in the penthouse’s delivery box. You and me are going to need to be in constant contact, sending files, reviewing strategy, exchanging dick pics. I’d give you a Stark Pad but I know you ‘don’t see the point because it’s just a bigger, harder to hold smart phone.’”
Everyone around the table agrees, though Sam does say “But really, do the webs come
“And here is the blood sample we have on file from Tony from last year.” The second screen comes up.
The kids are in bed and so are Tony and Steve. Tony can’t believe they go to bed around 10 pm these days, but that’s always the case when they have the kids. Pepper has been dating someone for the last couple of months, so Steve and Tony are taking the kids more than half the time when the need arises. The jury is still out as far as Tony is concerned, but Steve likes the guy.
Friday says nothing in return, and Tony hops up on the exam table, excited as can be. He’s just realized he has his socks on and throws them onto the clothing pile on the chair when a light knock sounds on the other side of the door.
They have both been so patient, he doesn’t want to wait any more.
“Come on Auntie, let’s see what crumbs are laying around it the kitchen for you.”
Steve slips off his slacks and folds them over a nearby chair, leaving him in just his boxers and t-shirt before pulling back the covers and getting in. He slides over to the side without the Stark pad (which he assumes is the side Tony prefers), and leaves the duvet pulled back, resting his head up on his hand, arm bent at the elbow. After a beat he pats the empty space next to him indicating for Tony to join him.
Steve lets out a low moan, he can almost forget why they are doing this. His worry about Tony floating away as his balls tighten and he edges closer.
This part is set post Chapter 110: Time away from the world
Speaking of, he rakes his eyes over Steve and sees he is
He doesn’t understand why. Why now? The war, losing Bucky, going down into the ice and losing Peggy, New York, finding Bucky again, Sokovia… after each one, night after night he was able to escape into calm nothingness.
His mind is betraying him, and he hates it. He tells himself he hates it.
Steve is actually the one that thinks it’s a great idea first. Tony has been talking about stepping back in the day-to-day Avenging, and so the timing couldn’t be better. Steve has always wanted to be a father, and if in this arrangement he isn’t “dad” he figures he would at least be like… like a stepparent? And the idea of a mini-Tony running around, he just can’t think of anything better.
This fic and others to follow is an off-shoot of the AMAZING epistolary fic “1796 Broadway,” where ‘Captain America respectfully requests that all complaints be addressed to him in writing.’ I really admire what the authors are doing, and the slow build they are creating is so so lovely… that said, my brain won’t shut up after each post with “what now???” so this is an answer to that.
Steve turns his head away from the wall to look behind him and see Tony kneeling again. Steve can't remember Tony ever kneeling in his dreams but it is quite the sight...
Steve leaves the bathroom in a bit of a daze. He makes his way across the penthouse to what he assumes is the bedroom, enters and takes a deep calming breath. It’s a large room, and the bed is huge. Seeing the bed sets his mind in motion, he focuses. He’s going to concentrate on giving Tony what he wants, give him the focused care he’s given Steve so freely all evening.
Tony zooms in closer on Steve’s face, which is now looking directly up at the camera.
That making sure Steve was getting what he needs, keeping the lines of communication open, would be exhausting. It turns out he truly just wants to do the work it comes to Steve. He wants to know what’s bothering him, and he wants to help him with it. And if he can’t help, he wants to be there to just listen.
Tony gets up to make popcorn and responds to Peter.
“Uhg, I’m going to kill Rhodey. Yes, okay! But let’s be clear, I was
This is the longest thing I've written in a long time, please let me know if anything is unclear or rushed 😁
And Bruce knows that if in some weird alternate universe if Nat came to Tony asking if
Steve firmly grips Tony's ass and clears his throat. “If you’re comfortable, I’d like to try another technique. It’s a bit unorthodox…” Steve doesn’t wait for an answer before lowering his mouth to Tony’s eager hole. He swipes at it, laving it with saliva. He doesn’t move, speaking directly into the tender skin “This technique isn’t technically allowed, as it’s still experimental. They only do it in Europe.”
He gets to work running the cloth over Steve’s lower back and glutes. He presses the cloth back and forth, the little beads providing a mini-deep tissue massage. He then lets the spray do its work washing the soap away. Next he pours more soap directly into the top of Steve’s ass-crack. Steve shifts slightly at the cool sensation as it drips down down down.
He has to pause and close his eyes.
He turns to Tony. “And you’re obviously showing physical changes. So if you’re not purposely trying to alter yourself we need to figure out what the hell is happening.”
Tony’s gasping, and flushed, and he is the most beautiful thing Steve has ever seen. He licks his lips and tilts his head to the side before saying “Steve – I didn’t… I didn’t say that so we would—“ he looks down at where their bodies are inches from connecting and sighs pressing against Steve with his hands to get Steve’s body off of him. “Fuck. We’re taking it slow, right?”
Tony squeezes him back, hard, and says “I think I’m gonna insist on it.”
Scott is crazy-pumped to be an Avenger. But only two weeks in he might die from embarrassment. Steve is right there with him.
It’s cute and a little heart-breaking the look of soft surprise Steve gets whenever anyone readily accepts their relationship. Tony isn’t naive, he knows there will be some negative reactions if and when they go public, but for now he relishes every positive one that helps pull Steve further and further from the time he grew up in.
Tony every night, knowing that in the morning he won’t be there. He hasn’t called. Will probably never call.
Scott blinks. “Oh.”
Nat’s head falls back and she looks up to the sky and sighs. She holsters her gun. “Here we go…” she says.
He knows it’s not over yet.
Per the plan, Steve will
Finally. Tony leaps up and flings his shirt off, “Race you!”
“Keep your hands on the hammer.” He says easily, conversationally like he’s asking Steve to pass a slice of pizza.
In the morning when Tony goes into the bathroom to brush his teeth, JARVIS quietly addresses Steve with the utmost discretion in his voice:
Steve nods. “Okay good, we can proceed and I’ll work to avoid that area... for now.” As he says it the thrusting resumes. The same regular pattern from before.
Steve’s cheeks go pink. That’s right, Peter doesn’t know.
They need to talk.
think this was definitetly the right call.
Natasha spares them a glance from teaching the dog to ‘play dead,’ saying “He’s fine, he just needs sleep.” LASS-E dramatically clutches at her chest with a rounded metallic paw and lets out a pathetic whimper.
He pulls back, smiling, “I’m glad they knew each other.” And he is. He realizes he hasn’t thought about Peggy in some time. And that the old hollow pain he used to feel when he did is gone.
“I just… I need to talk to him. Is he here?”
Tony invites Shuri and Nebula to the compound for that sleepover. They do science, and eat ice cream and wear avocado honey face masks (Nebula – “Terran customs are disgusting”). They snuggle in to watch a movie (Tony picked Clueless, thinking it might help both Shuri – who grew up in Wakanda, and Nebula – who grew up being tortured by a megalomaniac, familiarize themselves with some basic  American Earth culture. Plus the guy that plays Josh looks
Pepper gets that face she gets when she thinks Tony isn’t understanding her. “That’s not what I-“
Steve opens his eyes to see Tony looking down. Gazing at his hands running over Steve, the head of his cock appearing and disappearing faster and faster as Tony works him.
Steve is… worshipping him.
After a beat Steve says, “The procedure isn’t over, but we can’t take a break if you’d like.”
Tony feels the tension release from Steve’s body as he works his way through his hair and reaches the base of his head.
“Alright Mr. Stark, you’re going to need to stay just like that for a little while. Then I’ll be back soon and we will proceed.”
Turns out a lot of The Plan is "let's see how things go."
“Okay, let’s get married.” continues Steve.
He settles on leaving a note for Sam where he knows he won’t see it until the next day. This is too important, Tony… the team is too important, and Steve can’t wait any longer.
Tony motions to the various parts of the shower that changed/moved with his command. “So, the shelves are obviously everything we need to get clean. The baskets on the bottom are usually for when I want to do a little ah, self-care. I haven’t used anything in them with anyone else. In fact, this shower has pretty much seen only solo missions, like, for years. Not sure if that puts you at ease, I don’t want to get us off-course by talking about exes, but yeah, it’s not everyone’s thing and it’s
“I’m not laughing because this isn’t serious. It is. And I know you’re just concerned. But… I don’t know how to make you understand Pepper. We fit. He understands the hero gig. He knows me, and all my flaws and wants me anyway, or even because of them? I don't know. We’re a team. A literal team, and a figurative one."
Bruce dissolves into giggles and everyone else dog piles into the center of the room to wrestle with the best robotic dog ever.
Steve smiles and kisses his temple. “That too.”
Tony knows Whirl-turd is still out there, but he takes a second to pull Steve to him, almost crushing him under the strength of the armor and his own fear.
Steve thought the biggest change after getting the go-ahead from Bruce would be their sex life. But this whole thing seems like it has finally caught up with Tony. While they’re having just as much sex as they ever did (if not more, and once again without condoms), a shift in their relationship takes place that Steve did not anticipate.
“Here we go. This will start slow, but toward the end the medicine will need to be injected as deep as possible, and I’ll need to speed up, okay?"
They kiss and stumble together through the living room, on to the bedroom. Groping and laughing along the way, giddy with the knowledge they no longer have to hide. Steve realizes with a start that he can sleep here tonight in the suite, with Tony, if that’s what Tony wants.
Tony is light-headed with power, holding Steve hostage between the two fingers jammed in his ass and the tight grip he has on the base of his cock.
“I know. I know” says Tony, but he’s still sliding toward Steve on his knees, and now there’s less than a foot between them.
(See the end of the chapter for
Huh. “I’m not sure that’s my thing…” says Tony.
“I’m an open book!” says Tony.
If he makes love to Becky, that’s what it will be… and right now he just can’t be certain that’s really where his heart is at. Once he talks with Tony, he’ll at least know where they stand, and whether he can see himself taking that step.
Fuck maybe he misread everything.
Okay, it’s official. Someone if fucking with him. Tony refuses to believe that there is a reality where Pepper Pots loves him and leaves him, and that in the same universe Captain Fucking America wants him but is apparently taken by some secret girlfriend. Or boyfriend. Tony doesn’t know who Steve is seeing. Maybe it’s an alien of unknown gender. There are no surprises left.
“Tony, uh, look you need to come down to the lab.” says Bruce.
Steve rubs the worry line forming between Tony’s brows. “It’s really okay, I knew what I was signing up for. Honestly, I figured I’d be a lab rat for the rest of my life, but look at us now.” He smiles and Tony relaxes.
“Wow! Wait, Mr. Stark did you say you’re
Scott settled his Cassie visitation with Maggie amicably. They decided it will gradually increase over time so he can ease into the role and also pursue The Avengers stuff. It’s going to take some time with the lawyers to get it all official, but for now they are good with him taking her at least for overnights a couple times a month. In the future they may change it to Friday-Sundays, and then who knows.
“Oh, umm, sorry, if that’s… if that’s too much. Too soon?” Steve suddenly wishes he wasn’t so close to Tony, looking him right in the eye… god they've only been together six weeks, and they were apart of a month of that. Tony must think it's too soon.
Ah, it never gets old having Steve call him that.
A blue beam of light delivers their opponents from what looks like a giant donut of a spaceship.
Steve doesn’t need to take his hand, but he does. Just slides it big and warm into Tony’s own like it’s the most natural thing in the world.
“Hmm that
After several moments the door doesn’t open. He didn’t think it would, but he thought maybe it would trip some alarm, trigger some notification. He waits but nothing happens.
Anything else flits out of Steves mind. This is everything.
to cheer up his royal cyclops here, you ass!” Rocket nods his head at Thor.
Tony, please let me come!”
Bruce is wrapping the entire hand in gauze now, and with a final snip it’s covered. Tony gets up and breezes by Steve, who still hasn’t said anything. Tony hasn’t looked him in the eye and doesn’t plan to.
Unfortunately, by the time Tony realizes what a perfect opportunity this is, Steve has already left for his morning run.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Relax, relax, I was just upgrading it” says Rocket.
know about who I have
“So yeah, I’d say you’re pretty crazy man. But like I said, I think it will work for you guys.”
God Steve doesn’t know how to say the right thing. He paws kind of pathetically at Tony’s chest in apology. Tony’s chest, which is covered in scar tissue, which Steve is just noticing for the first time... God, has he even paid any attention to Tony this whole time, or was he too focused on himself, on having Tony meet
“Fine.” Her tone is clipped, but she looks resigned.
“I’m going to place your feet in the stirrups, keep scooting down until your posterior is at the very edge of the table.” says Steve as he slides his fingers out of Tony and moves the pillow out of Tony's way.
“Be right there. Friday, end call.”
Steve can’t wait anymore either. He grasps the plug’s flat handle, turning it slowly, experimentally. The glitter swirls around, like a galaxy of stars.
The platform Tony is standing on aligns them perfectly. He pushes forward slowly, conscious that even though Tony has been stretched he needs to be careful.
“Then,” Tony goes on, “we can discuss what you want to do. I have a lot of ideas Steve. A
“I told you, you’d die for that.” He sneers, pushing the axe deeper and then ripping it from his chest. Thanos' purple blood spraying across the Wakadan landscape.
What they wrote about in Japan, well… He looks down at his hand, a soothing cooling sensation dulling the underlying throb of pain.
His temple throbs as he considers that Steve probably hasn’t been half as tortured these past months as he has. Maybe he’s been sitting in his little hide-outs, surrounded by his like-minded cronies bemoaning how long it’s taking selfish Tony to come around to his point of view.
I am also curious for how this reads for people who haven't read '1796 Broadway' (and for those who have, I guess, haha!). I once again want to really thank the authors for being so open about allowing ancillary works; I love this Steve and Tony, and look forward to reading the "real" conclusion as it plays out :)
Another hologram of the iconic tourist “I heart New York” t-shirt appears over the countdown clock. “Umm, yeah, what’s that?” asks Peter.
regret. And that’s that I didn’t trust you. Not people. Not the world’s governments. I thought I trusted you, but when it mattered I let you down. I should have trusted you with the truth. I should have trusted that you would never really let anyone take away our ability to protect people.”
He wants this thing with Steve to thrive, and if he’s learned anything he knows that means they need to balance each other. They need to have give and take. Challenge each other, give in to one another.
. Taking his ass and raising it up while holding his mouth and tongue in place stiffly above him. Up and down. Lifting most of Tony’s body up to his mouth over and over. Tony’s pelvis is being moved like a buffet platter Steve is licking clean. He moves Tony in little circles to swirl him around and around.
Fuck, Tony knows he should say something else, something to reassure Steve that he won’t hurt him, that it’s okay… but Tony’s too lost in arousal at the thought of Steve hurting him, or trying not to hurt him, or fuck he doesn’t know.
Hopefully the re-existance of Morgan is a pleasant surprise (with bonus Steves!baby, name TBD haha). I know this is a lot of fluff, but eh, that was sort of the point of this fic, total wish fulfillment. I really tried to fix as much as I possibly could, but no matter what there just wasn't a way to save Gamora... It's up to the reader if they believe if Thor's wish brought Loki back. I say yes, because Gamora's fate was tied to the soul stone but I'd like to think the infinity stones could bring back someone who just died. Also RIP Thor's arm. My thinking was that since Thor basically made three huge wishes at once, that's why it damaged him so badly. Poor Thor, a fake eye and a fake arm now haha.
Dr. Strange looks serious, but hopeful. “Over 53,000.”
“Sure Boss, over the last eight months you two have had sex within my observable range 369 times, an average of 1.57 times a day. Steve was the “top” 48.6 percent of the time, Tony was the “top” 31.9 percent of the time. The other 19.5 percent which resulted in orgasm were oral sex acts which were split fairly evenly for who received and who performed the oral stim-“
(See the end of the chapter for
One day a couple months after LASS-E’s introduction when he and Tony are finally settling in to watch Indiana Jones, she comes up to him as usual and puts her paws up on his lap.
Hunter: It's not as bad now since most of the worst board members are gone, thanks to the Pride fiasco last summer. However, I don't think needing to prepare for an alien invasion was ever part of your duties at Stark Industries. It is less stressful.
This is a timeline this story is using. I am working off the assumption that the battle of New York happen no earlier than late 2011. The events of the agents of shield season three finale/Civil War happened late April early May 2016. Tony and Steve start speaking to each other again in May 2016. Certain early events from Spider-Man: Homecoming occurred in August before school started. In this universe, everything else takes place in September 2016.
BITC: It wasn’t intentional. Benji said it was a voice recognition typo.
“I will try, but she may want to speak to you directly," Ana replied.
Venom: I’ve been told that I’m not leaving medical without you. When will you be back?
Me: You’re good at it though. And at least this way you have something to look forward to.
“As long as I stay sober, it matures when I turn 25," Flash tells the group.
"I do too, but we’ll see each other soon. Mumbai for the wedding in a few weeks and then Malta for Christmas. It won’t be as bad as last time."
Blue phone: Please don’t
Me: Dr. Suarez is actually functioning as Tony’s therapist right now. My role is as a life counselor or sobriety companion.
May: You were going to say occasional hookups with Phil.
"You know I’m not going to leave just because we can’t have sex?" Steve asked seriously.
Friday:@WHiHOfficial_JWest either someone is overcompensating for their tiny dick or jealous that V Potts has the career you wish you had.
For the sake of clarity, the “me” in this conversation is Laura.
MayMQ: That's good.
Counselor Laura: That still confuses me greatly. You're right, I'll go invite Clint to the meeting. We are ordering pizza. That should entice him if the brownies are not enough.
“Because you’re right,” Tony smiled at those words.
We are back in the “Tony and Steve had their ship together” timeline. I know you want to see if Tony Stark-Potts gets back to Laura, lost in 2023, but I did promise you a Daisy check-in. Remember that due to me misreading MJ’s last name originally, I came up with the brilliant idea to make her Daisy’s cousin and I kept running with it.
Me: I’m not that busy with Steve, mostly because of medical restrictions and he’s such a Boy Scout that he made me respond.
Steve: I think you may be right. Maybe you should try to get into her phone. You are the Director of Shield.
“Why were we the ones left behind?” Steve voiced the question that he’s been thinking about for a while.
Purple Princess: A lot.
BITC: I still can’t believe she’s letting me go to Europe
Ana Jr.: I believe she was more upset about you inviting him to a wedding that was attacked by terrorists.
Tony Potts: So, it was Hydra, not Russia?
Venom: Look, this is one of those situations where if the guy you want can’t be with you, you want him to be with the best person possible. In this case, that’s MJ. Of course, this meant me dating the idiot to get over you, which was a mistake.
“Ok.”
HSBF: Well, none of us have traveled through time yet so, I would say being an Avenger is less stressful.
HSBF: Actually it says that they are the Super Human, Inhuman, Enhanced Human Liaison Division.
“Where is it?” Because if they knew where it is, they could grab it and use it.
Why did Tony feel like Steve wasn’t saying something? Like maybe Steve already met that person he was in love with. And maybe, just maybe, if there are some universal constants, Tony could be that person. Oh great, now Friday’s playing the Backstreet Boys song Chances. (Every member but Brian survived the snap because it really was that random.) Friday really has it out for him. If she starts playing Siberia, he’s donating her to the nearest community college.
May: I respect that.
“Hey, if you can do it, you can say it.”
“He’s one of those Inhuman freaks,” Evil puppy number five said. It was about that time that Romanoff knocked him out. That was probably for the best because Tony was 30 seconds from at least shooting the guy in the leg.
Me: Okay, probably you and the Princess are going to keep the world from ending and I’m here to help.
“I know. I don’t want to think about his time with Hydra.” Tony places an arm around Steve.
Me: I don’t like that name.
Tony: Night, Honey Bunny, even though it’s totally morning where you are.
Counselor Laura: This is our second separation. Third, if you count when he sent me divorce papers when he went to go after Ross. I’m willing to tell you about it eventually as long as you don’t keep avoiding me. But not right now; I have a Stark to diffuse.
Me: Exactly. Also Ross made the mistake of employing some of Sharon’s ex-teammates in his operation now that the agency soon to be new Shield is no longer under his thumb.
Cuddle Bunny: Tony are you there???
To be continued
Cuddle fiancé: I could have told you that after she kicked me in the shin. If I wasn’t a super-soldier, she would’ve broken something.
Me: That's not even surprising. This will be going into the river.
"Thanks." Tony gave half a smile. "Was there a point when you actually wanted to kill me?"
I am not
Me: Have you seen anything besides your hotel room?
“I'm good at lying to myself, but even I have my limits," Tony laughed.
HSBF: I think that bridge has been burned from what I understand.
“Was this when he lost his eye?” Steve asked.
Xxxxxx
Me: No, she did her own dirty work. It helped that she hired her sister as the caterer and her brother-in-law’s friend or something is an emergency room physician at the trauma center closest to the banquet. That way if the plan failed spectacularly, he could just choke me with a pillow. I’m not sure if his arrest actually made the news. Snookums is trying to keep it quiet.
Anthony: She also did not like my suggestion of her going to therapy.
The new consultant: I guess this is the point in this conversation where I offer my condolences for the ex-boyfriend.
Me: Yes. Anthony could put a circuit board together at four but I think his father resented him for that. When he was nine he lost his mother figure and therefore was sent off to boarding school. He hated it because he thought it meant his father didn’t love him, but it kept him away from bullies and possibly Hydra assassins.
Cuddle fiancé: Natasha just told me we’re going to the Playground now. May radioed her and changed our route.
Venom: I fainted on [redacted] and Afia.
Me: I needed a moment and a distraction to deal with my handler coming back from the dead, which is why I’m not going to comment on your avoidance.
“Or, best friends just know this stuff. There are very few secrets I can keep from Platypus and Pepper Pot.” Tony put an arm around him. “I’m still shocked that I kept the fact I was dying a secret from everybody.”
Me: So you made those crazy videos to protect me and the company?
Cuddle fiancé: I understand how this can be difficult. I fought against actual aliens yesterday, and I’m not even sure I believe half of what was in the readout of yesterday’s meeting. You didn’t mention the thing about the hammer.
Me: I need a drink. This is just too much to process at once.
Me: See, occasionally it becomes obvious that I really do have a genius level IQ.
"You have commitments too.” Melinda tells him. “I think Stark needs you around more. Especially if he keeps adopting young superheroes. You help ground him to some degree."
The new consultant: I think he knows you are a choice.
“You don’t know if that’s what she’s going to choose? Have you talked to Kamala about what you’re planning?
Purple Arrow: Fuck.
“I prefer not to Karen. I hate watching him leave because I’m afraid one day he won’t come back.” He thought about May Parker. About her losing her husband just days before Thanksgiving. He doesn’t want to think about that.
(See the end of the chapter for
I went to high school with somebody who now owns Alias Investigations. I’ll see if she’s willing to take the case.
Me: There’s no ventilator. He was on oxygen but there was never any ventilator. I think the real reason why they still have him sedated is the director thinks he will sign himself out AMA as soon as he’s conscious again, especially considering what happened before his bodyguard could get back there.
Me: No, because nothing I say is going to bring her son back. Making a scholarship in his name is just a slap in the face. So, it’s best to just keep my distance.
HSBF: I doubt that. Also, why you?
“Actually, his favorite coping mechanism is se…” Steve started to say sex but caught himself, but probably not soon enough because Natasha was smirking.
Purple Princess: Because your mom would never think you would voluntarily go there.
Me: Director Snookums is not happy because his people figured it out first, but they’re not public yet so it would just cause problems. They’re also a spy organization. So this sort of thing is FBI jurisdiction, probably. Yo-yo was on the ferry though to assist.
But despite all that baggage on both of our sides, and I know Tony had his own ghost to contend with, I kept writing. Even when it hurt, even when it’s painful, I kept writing because we can’t be like this. The world can’t afford our man and Captain America at each other’s throats. The bad guys won last time because of it. We destroyed each other or nearly did. If we do that, then who will be around the next time aliens invade New York or apparently, Utah.
“Basement, although my garage was in the basement. I guess technically, it was true. How did you even know about that?” Tony asked, surprised.
Tony: And sunglasses.
Anthony: So now they’re down to a Colombian national codename Yo-Yo with super speed and a pacifist with the ability to melt bullets. He would’ve been really helpful last year. Too bad he didn’t get his powers until after my massive fuck up.
To: Pepper_Pot
Cuddle Bunny: You’re not crazy. You’re probably just in need of therapy, but Sam says the same about me.
Anthony: Not really. But if I don’t say something to you, than I have to work on this in therapy and I’d rather talk to you.
Counselor Laura: Yes. What did you think happened? A bullet to the skull?
Tony Potts: That is such a better costume. Friday, sweetheart, do you think you can do something with that image?
This chapter takes place about two days after the last one. It’s mid July 2016 in this story.
“That’s all I ask for.”
“You’ll do a lot to be with the ones you love.” He tells her.
Nomad: Because I want the first time we do anything together to be in person. I don’t want to just imagine what kissing you would be like, I want to know how your tongue feels against mine. I want to know what you taste like before I fantasize about it. I want to know what your hand feels like against my skin before you talk me into getting off.
HSBF: I don't think I would ever be a super villain.
Me: I’ll ask her and Mary to confirm that.
“I hope we don’t actually have to face the end of the world,” Steve cuddled in a little closer.
Me: Good to know you got the new TV. Did they show Agent 13 as being the one dragging him out in handcuffs? She really enjoyed that. That’s my new moment of Zen.
Tosha: Because widows understand each other. Not that she was married to Fitz, they just created a marriage license to keep Alister the asshole from cashing in on all the James Leopold patents. They were engaged before he died anyway.
Me: That can’t happen until the Accords are renegotiated and re-ratified. Whoever ends up in charge will just be an acting until that happens. The Watchdog attacks made a lot of world governments realize the flaws in the Accords and they’re willing to go back to the negotiating table.
OK, you know about Howard catching me having private time with your propaganda poster. I don’t think it’s possible for any moment in my life to get more embarrassing than that. It was pretty mortifying. And considering I have a sex tape that people still watch, that’s saying something.
Pepper pot: I’m an expert at this point in deciphering the drunk ramblings of a genius inventor. It’s been a couple years, but I might be able to help. You could have Friday send them to me.
Blue phone: Are you still in DC?
Me: Because Mace is as fake as the muscles in his suit and an icer didn’t work because of what was in my system. It’s fine. I’m okay now.
“I still think it’s better to wake her up, especially with Yo-Yo, Daisy, and Mack gone.”
Me: You also love blueberry pancakes.
Continuity note: Remember when I said I would explain how this story diverges from the main timeline in 1955. Some of that explanation will happen in this chapter. This chapter contains heavy spoilers for the first half of AOS season seven, especially episode 7.4. I’m just glad that the show has aired on Disney+ in the UK by this point. It is also on Netflix in the US.
Venom: No, I don’t scare that easily.
: This refers to the daughter of Laura Barton, Dr. Stark’s sober companion.
Laura is making me do this exercise again. I don’t know what good it’s going to do. Although maybe I’m a little less angry at you, mostly because I know you’re not with Steve. The fact that you’re not living happily ever after with the guy, but are in fact taking responsibility for what you did helps. I’m not going to say it brings me closure, but it makes things easier to deal with.
Me: Which will help with our open and honest communication. And I understand why you didn’t tell me the truth. But I kind of knew. The international community may have been caught off guard but I wasn’t.
Cuddle bunny: Clint thought it was too easy. It was arranged? So, if things went south, we would be able to respond in the aftermath?
“Actually, both of us have originating classification authorities and can classify any piece of information without consulting the Director, the Deputy Director or senior Agent Coulson, which is what I did in this case,” Fitz argued. Leo really wished she would leave the room at this point. Simmons was making her furious face. He knew that face too well.
Tony: OK, we are just going to hold onto that memory as we try to get through the rest of this list or this section because we are so not going past question 24 tonight.
Blue phone: It didn't seem polite. After I realized that half the things said about you in the SHIELD files were not true, I decided I should probably talk to you.
Me: Probably.
Me: I’m not even surprised.
“You have a nice ass. It's America's ass." Remarked Tony.
“No, it did not.”
Agent 13: Of course Stark made friends with the tech division.
Would you be OK if I considered Melinda family even though she’s my ex-girlfriend? She still understands things that a lot of people don’t. Although, thanks to Talbot now knowing my connection to you, I can’t really email her.
Tony: Agent America?
Nomad: And that explains why you have the person you pay to change the light bulbs at the tower wear a safety harness.
“We can still go to the beach. We should do something outside of the room together. What I’m trying to say is if we actually left the room, then Piper would have just waited until breakfast to tell us to text your friend.” Steve remarked.
The random text showing up on my screen is creepy. Send an actual text message or something else next time.
Me: I’m not surprised. You didn't arrest her, did you?
HSBF: More than one occasion, actually.
Cuddle bunny: I doubt her name is really Agent Scary. Also, you drink too much coffee.
“There’s so much I have left to teach you about this wonderful world.” Tony said kissing Steve one more time before leading him into the hallway to get his bags.
Tony: Maybe not. But 48 hours after her dad is arrested is probably not the time to start those conversations. Even Benjamin thinks her reaction is kind of understandable. He told me when he texted me yesterday. Also, apparently his BFF got detention for allegedly watching my sex tape when he was helping.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You are all fabulous. This is the final set of the get well card/messages. Sorry, no illustrations this time. However card one was a handwritten note attached to an ostentatiously large bouquet of edible arrangements. The get out of the doghouse choice of General Talbot, after that time he accidentally thought his wife was a Hydra agent in disguise. (Yes, this happened in canon.)
“But what about the people who died by suicide after the snap? Do we bring them back? Or Carol’s wife. They didn’t even get together until after the snap.” Due to some prodding by Deke and Simmons. Tony has no idea what actually happened. “And then three years later, she died of cancer. Do we bring her back too? Can we? Should we? I don’t know the answers to these questions.”
Me: Probably not, but that’s mostly because somebody may have posted the videos that you did for the Captain America fitness challenge on the Internet. It’s going viral. How did you get talked into doing those videos? Was blackmail involved? Peter watched that in gym class last week.
Nomad: So the Director is going to overlook anything you did that violated the Accords.
Person that cares about my boss: Do you know what’s in the file?
“However, time travel has consequences even if it seems like all sunshine and roses in Laura’s timeline. Except Flash and Peter might be dating." Tony shivered a little at the thought.
“I don’t think it can be considered classified information if neither the director or Agent Coulson know about it,” Simmons nearly yelled.
Me: Spider mom feels better about the whole situation now. Although, I still see lots of couples' therapy in their future.
Tony: Unfortunately, I’m currently having lunch with the money people and I kind of want to cry. This has to be punishment for not doing the New York Times interview. I knew PR Jane would have her vengeance somehow.
Skye quake: I figured you would want pictures of this since you’ve been pushing so hard. Philip tells me everything. Please see multiple images of May and Coulson finally making out attached.
“I’m not even going to go there. Did you actually send an apology floral arrangement?” Steve asked.
Counselor Laura: I will try texting first but let him know I’ll talk to him in a minute.
Red phone: Pepper used to be that voice, but she's not here anymore. And Rhodey has other things to deal with because of my stellar decision-making skills.
Nomad: Karen said that they were two different people.
TMNS: He took detention versus telling one of the teachers what he was doing in the computer lab last night. It probably didn’t help somebody was playing your sex tape on the computer right before Ned took over. It was in the browser history.
Blue phone: I thought by now you were aware I never actually dated Sharon nor am I planning to.
Anthony: I even sold off most of the former Avenger floors. I’m only keeping the new penthouse with guest rooms, Laura’s apartment, and another apartment for my live-in assistant. Of course, because Happy and Elena can’t get along, Yo-Yo has moved into one of my guest rooms.
Me: Good on you. Also, why?
Me: And their extended family.
“How could anybody have blackmail on you back then? Before the Instagram oops incident. It’s also hard to blackmail somebody with something that’s already out there.”
Tony: Actually, I feel like Deke would like for you to text him some work stuff. Friday could send it to him. Although with the way the time windows works, it's actually better on our side. We have like two more days before we're going to be able to connect again. However, only a few hours have passed on their side.
Football Hunter: So I guess we should talk about the football game or the girlfriend?
Me: To prevent enhanced person internment camps. I am surprised the good Senator hasn’t already proposed that.
Tony: Also, I wanted to give Mr. and Mrs. Purple Arrow some privacy. They’re still working some things out. I would have brought the kids with me, but they have school.
“Not bad, maybe just not something you want to hear and Tony wanted to make sure you have emotional support.” Which explains why Tony was somewhat okay with Sam coming along.
This chapter takes place only an hour or two after the last one. I apologize to those reading this story and not watching Agents of Shield. This one might be extra confusing. Some of the events are adapted from AOS episode 4.6 and 4.7 of the Ghost Rider arc.
Tony: But each of those things have a dark side.
Blue phone: Wrong. My favorite color is lavender and my favorite movie is Inside Out.
Me: Vast quantities of alcohol. That's not an option. It’s a lot harder to be honest when you are sober.
Congratulations to everyone who guessed that the last chapter was from the perspective of Clint’s cell phone. There may be a few more interludes along the way.
“And her last boyfriend dumped her for a toddler Starlet.”
To be continued.
May: Clint and Natasha are working on the list. We got the coordinates from Nebula this morning regarding several stones. That arrived just before I left. We are debating whether we should go to Norway now or wait until after the meeting to get specifics from Thor regarding the Tesseract.
BITC: I understand. Is this related to the reports of the exploding hammer? Apparently, the Norwegian government has a leak.
Steve: Is Laura conscious yet? Does Bruce know why she lost consciousness?
Thank you to everybody who has read or reviewed the last conversation. You’re all wonderful.
Me: It’s kind of hard to tell. Also, since he was already turning into a giant monster like inhuman that likes to kill other inhumans/enhanced persons before he was killed, she’s probably been grieving for a while.
To be continued
Melinda: This is true. I hope that you’re eventually able to keep your foot out of your mouth long enough to give me a reason to sign the divorce papers someday.
“Or if she knows she won’t tell us,” Clint added.
Nomad: I’m not arguing that, but maybe it’s good for you to talk things out with Laura and Rhodey.
“So interestingly enough, the next question is we‘re supposed to share an embarrassing moment with each other. You go first,
“That would be useful because I have some questions about your notes. However, there are some other things we need clarification on.” Shuri said before turning things over to Afia.
Me: We will try. We will be back at the Playground in a few hours. We’re bringing cake.
Anthony love: When we are not briefing the president. How do you feel about redirecting to the Playground? I feel like I can use some backup, and we kinda need a distraction.  Unfortunately, Mack and Yo-Yo are helping Sharon with a little something in San Francisco, so that leaves you.
I miss that Bucky. It was us against the world, when we were growing up. I feel like I want to talk to him about what’s going on in my life but I can’t because of what Hydra did to him. That smart woman I mentioned earlier, she’s taking care of him. I hope she has a breakthrough soon and maybe James will wake up. Maybe he already has because it’s not like it’s safe for me to get updates from her.
PS: I’m sure he didn’t tell you but he’s on medical restriction for the next few weeks. No Iron Man and no sexual activities. At least with you being in another country, one of these restrictions will be observed. If he behaves that restriction might be lifted before Johannesburg.
Tony Potts: A little. May and Steve are getting a divorce. They say it will happen when we undo everything. I think it’s going to end regardless, even if we fail miserably. There’s this little part of me that is happy about Steve being single. I feel awful that May’s giving me the green light to climb her soon-to-be ex-husband like a tree.
Tony: Again, things I don’t want to know about. Maybe we can talk about Benjamin. I think he should get his internship back.
Red phone: Then the Watchdogs, a.k.a. that group that tossed red paint on you last summer because you’re an ‘abomination’, blew up a federal building with my father’s tech that even he thought was too dangerous.
Girl Friday: That would be because this afternoon, Laura was kidnapped from the Avenger compound by someone that sort of looks like her husband, but with crazy hair and more tattoos. We initially thought he was a shapeshifting alien, but it turns out he was Clint from another timeline from about five years in the future.
HSBF: We’ll talk about it again after Johannesburg. So were things that bad with Pepper?
Tony told me last week that you wanted to speak with me. I wasn’t ready to talk to you. I made some excuse about it being too dangerous, but we both know better. If you or your bosses wanted me back, I would be in that white cage on your new Quinjet right now. I got a very close look yesterday when I met your formally dead best friend who you were in love with, but never told. Considering he only threatened to send my body back to the Arctic if I hurt Tony, I assume he doesn’t know about what happened when you thought he was dead. Does he even know that you’re in love with him? You should tell him. After this mess with Tony, keeping secrets does no one any good.
Counselor Laura: I think I know the answer to this, but how did Tony and Steve’s engagement end? Were they ever engaged or even dating? Did they even start speaking to each other again after the Siberia fiasco?
Tony: That means you are disrupting Yo-Yo’s sleep, or her fun boyfriend time. No wonder she was cranky.
Time sent: 11/12/2016 23:01:12
Venom: Why didn’t you tell me the truth?  Did you not tell me the truth because you were afraid I was going to tell the entire Flash Mob about it? Because you know I wouldn’t do that. Especially after you kept the truth about my ridiculously fucked up family and the fact that I’m gay to yourself. You haven’t even told your BFF.
“Talking can be a little overrated.”
Nomad: She did not threaten to kill me again.
We are on Avenger channels. Deputy Secretary of State James Rhodes’s code name is D. Which is actually a common nickname for the Deputy Secretary of State.
Friday: You’re boyfriends. You are dating. Why do you both keep ignoring this possibility?
Me: I wouldn't say god awful taste. I'm not that horrible, now that I’ve stopped making weapons of mass destruction. Okay there was that murder bot snafu, but we mostly dealt with it. Okay, maybe you’re right.
Me: This is probably revenge for nominating him for this job. He only took the job because he loves his country, but is afraid of the government.
Warning: Discussions of past child abuse.
Me: I don’t even think most people know mom‘s maiden name. Or how paranoid Howard was. Or the fact that that was the name I used when I was at smart kid boarding school and MIT.
Genius Princess: He shouldn't be. I would prefer to sit this out myself.
Venom: Also, who came up with my codename? I don’t like Venom. Why on earth did they decide to refer to me as Venom in this system?
“That does help in some ways, but it makes things worse. Like why couldn’t they be us? Why did it take seven years to really even try to talk to each other.”
“That wasn’t just me protecting Bucky. That was me protecting you. You wouldn’t be able to live with yourself if you actually killed him.” Tony can hear the sincerity in Steve’s words.
For those of you who did not watch season five of Agents of Shield, the Blues is a nickname for the Kree that enslaved people at the Lighthouse.
Me: For some reason, I don’t believe you. If you would’ve called me earlier, I would’ve told you about the decision to give the credit to the Avenger initiative and not Shield. Technically, Agents Rodriguez and May have been detailed to the Initiative and I’m planning for Agent Leopold to also join.
Tony: Would you believe I did so because your child that draws the future told me too?
“Of course, this is really about you getting laid.” Natasha said with an annoyed sigh.
Agent 13: I had to read all the Cuddle Bunny messages because my former employers were sadists. Although it wasn't until recently that I found out Melinda was real and not something created to throw Ross off. Not only that, but she did my paperwork when I joined Shield.
Me: It’s OK.
Counselor Laura: As we work on getting everyone here emotionally healthy, we start working on how to get me back to my timeline. Which means you come down and tell me what you know.
I don’t even know why Steve is still here. I may have casually mentioned in conversation about preferring a night wedding due to super villains being less likely to attacked and he kind of just smiled and argued that he didn’t want a wedding that late. That might be where the paparazzi are getting ideas about a possible marriage proposal or from the fact I may have already got a ring. I thought I was discreet but I’m not that good at discretion. You’re aware.
Red spider: Quake’s a big girl; she can handle herself.
Tony: So, I assume Friday didn't forward you Laura’s text messages live when she was chatting with the good timeline? How kind of her.
Me: Then I’ll get pictures of you in a baseball cap.
“He wants us to make sure his boyfriend doesn’t kill himself.” Wanda said, placing the device in his hand.
Tony: Yes. Not a lot of people know that Steve Rogers worked at a gay bar to put himself through art school. Stefan Carter also paid for college by working at various gay clubs. I guess that’s another parallel. This may be where Stefan and Steve started to get the activism bug.
“And how many times did Steve touch Tony?” Laura asked.
Me: The next best candidates are the recently powered Jeffrey the PR guru followed by your ex and that’s only because we have good blackmail information on him to keep him in check.
Red phone: Even so, I bet there are still moments when you want to punch me in the teeth, which is fine because I kind of feel the same way about you sometimes.
The Mechanic: Have you talked to Pepper Pot recently? I saw that the media is mostly talking about me again but I’m concerned.
“The world was never black and white, not even in the 40s.”
“Or they are just not openly hostile, which is still significantly better than Happy was five hours ago. Wanda’s family, now that’s a whole another category of complicated,” Tony remarked.
Friday: Mister Stark is on a call with Director Rhodes. They’re currently deciding if Shield, the ATCU, or the FBI should lead the investigation into criminals using weapons created using alien based technology. Since Shield has not been publicly announced, it will most likely be the FBI.
Me: I’m fine. Leo fixed it before it could do to me what it did to the others.
Nomad: You already knew about this?
Tony: 100% sincere. I should definitely start with those flowers. I’m better at apologizing with things than with words. I think it something I unfortunately got from Howard. So you know I’m going to try not to do it if I can help it. Maybe I’ll work on my apology letter during the accounts meeting in an hour.
HSBF: Glad to be of service.
Me: I feel like that would be too much like a sex tape.
Red phone: More fine print from the accords. They’re saying it’s because they want to see if I’m fit to be the leader of the new Avenger team, but really I think they’re just using this as another means to get information because I still haven’t cracked yet. After several rounds of interrogation.
Tony: Puerto Rico with mom to visit the extended family. Also one of his cousins may have just gone through Tergenesis, so Rio is checking it out with Davis and Piper. Which means New Orleans will just be on its own until closer to Mardi Gras.
Anthony love: Flaming head can’t take over?
Me: Which is sad because I really would like to call my boyfriend Captain Sexy Pants. You have the sexiest pants anywhere. You also look good in a shirt that is at least a size too small. I really want to set my tailor loose on you.
To be continued
Happy Bear: Do you love him?
Chief mechanic: I didn’t have a sex life when we were at MIT. I was too young. Also, Sharon’s mom scared everyone away because she was a very protective pseudo-cousin.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all fantastic.
Of course, this is an MCU story, so you know what that means. (Except for AOS 5.22 and Endgame but those were the ends of the story, and this is just the beginning.)
I have a new partner because Rhodey has a brand-new job and maybe subconsciously I am still a little pissed off at Vision for paralyzing my BFF. Yo-Yo is cool, at least now that we understand each other. Basically, we are both members of the 'our family members were killed in cold blood' club. That sort of thing helps cut through a lot of cultural and socioeconomic differences.
HSBF: Because you didn’t get to be.
Red phone: True.
Me: We all do things we don't want to keep those we love safe. I'm taking care of something. When it's done I'll be back.
Anthony love: I’m not surprised. I’ll have Mace and Burroughs work on the cover-up press guidance. According to the Fitzsimmons grandchild, she was Hydra. A Hydra operative that wanted to prevent Thanos from destroying the world, but still Hydra.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You are all absolutely lovely.
Cuddle Bunny: How did therapy go?
MJ: Why did you just type that?
HSBF: Too well. Although I feel like trouble finds us.
Person my boss is in love with: Just make sure he’s not alone when you tell him.
Me: However, in the end it worked out for the best. You have Tony now.
Steve: I don’t think that’s entirely it. I saw her looking at her phone before she passed out and I think that’s why she passed out. I think we need to look at her phone to really know what happened.
“I usually refer to that whole episode as the uncivil avenger toddler squabble. Apparently, my other self calls it something similar.”
Love: Let me guess, the Colonel takes his name out of the running and you go free?
Me: Sometimes in the lab I do start singing along with the music. It depends on the song. I’m sure Friday has video.
Me: That’s always good. Tried any new restaurants? Did any shopping? I should probably let you know that my tailor is making you something for the wedding.
Steve: Or they’ll be upset that she was raised for the last five years by a lapsed Catholic and his nonreligious wife.
Me: I would make a joke about your multitasking abilities, but pre-algebra awaits. Talk to you later, Gummy Bear.
Blue phone: Melinda definitely fell in the FWB category. I respected her, but she was really sad and lonely and kept everyone at arm’s length. She left the military after a mission gone badly for a civilian job in HR, her marriage fell apart because of it, and her best friend died on a mission right before I moved in. Actually he died during the battle of New York.
Football Hunter: That shouldn’t surprise you. Since he is like the boss.
“So, you do everything a six-year-old tells you to do?” MJ asked.
Anthony: Well apparently if we just let the FBI deal with it, the alien tech that was stolen right out from under the government’s nose would not have malfunctioned. [Insert eye roll here.] Wait, how do you even know about that?
Nomad: What have they been doing?
“Stuff like that is why May had Phil cremated.”
Tony: I’m in charge of putting a bunch of fail safes in there to keep it from being misused by, and I quote, “deadly emotion-seeking robots bent on becoming human who don’t understand the concept of no.”
Me: The happy life you were planning with Peggy on those cold war infested nights or somebody to share your life with now as it is in reality?
Again, Happy doesn’t respond, he just looks at her for a moment. Maybe there’s more truth there than he wants to knowledge even to himself.
“Yes, especially if May or Yo-Yo were accidentally exposed.”
Tony: I know. That’s what I have Director Bear for.
Me: That whole thing is a mess.
Football Hunter: I’m just trying to be helpful. I think you would be less stressed if you had a good shag. I would offer, but I’m not sure if you would say yes.
“That doesn’t matter. We should’ve talked things out. We should have never got to Siberia.” Tony said as he grabbed the phone and called room service. Steve wasn’t quite sure what his boyfriend was ordering, but there was a lot of it and he trusted Tony’s judgment when it came to food.
Jemma: It wasn’t the same choice. I didn’t love Will.
Avenger Friday: Ms. Robin told me not to. She said you needed to talk things out first.
Cuddle Bunny: I’m so glad you’re finally realizing that.
“Neither one of you is broken. Also, Dr. Leopold isn’t trying to change his past. That’s not possible, he’s trying to change our future. He still has to deal with his own ghosts,” Shuri explained.
Just so you know, I'm not a complete masochist. I did take his name off of my medical power of attorney and I removed him from the Friday protocol. And you know, it hurt more to take his name off than yours. Which should have told me something right then. Afterwards, I proceeded to work my way through most of the liquor collection at the upstate facility. That's when I drunk texted him.
Football Hunter: Yes so awful, your Simmons didn’t go through the portal with you. Maybe she’ll come rescue you or maybe you’ll meet someone else. A little payback for her screwing hog face on the planet of the dead. You should hook up with someone while you’re here.
Me: Can I wait till I’m back in New York in a few days to explain?
Me: So if you don’t want me to be your counselor, how do you want me to help you?
Tony: Which is understandable. Ross will be gone soon but some of the names being whispered about are not good. Someone mentioned Norman Osborn as a possible successor if POTUS gets a second term.
Finally, this is probably the longest chapter in this story. It goes over 5000 words. I don’t think you mind, though, since it’s Steve and Tony working through some stuff. I guess this is an appropriate post for Steve’s 103rd birthday.
Tony: When you’re rich and have a sex tape, people do some crazy things to get your attention. Finding naked strangers in my bedroom was kind of a thing during the 90s and early 2000‘s. I’ve put that piece of code into Jarvis and it carried over to Friday. I probably should modify it to people who tried to attack me. It might be more useful now.
FRIDAY: I will not confirm nor deny your hypothesis.
Anthony: You need to look extra edible. I want you in something that will make me want to climb you like a tree. Which won’t be that hard.
Nomad: Well, it definitely wasn’t lovemaking. Yes, unfortunately. This all happened during my first month in DC, when the guy was still chief of staff for Senator Christopher Ward before the Senator went crazy and killed his family. I’ve made better choices since then.
From: Tony_Carbonell-Rogers
Me: Okay. It’s possible. I will talked to Dr. Suarez. Maybe we can bring up the possibility of going public in a few months in a session with Benjamin. I will also try to get him to talk about his uncle.
CoulsonPJ: Try not to strangle Stark.
“Anybody who dates Tony Stark is going to have to deal with that.”
Me: But Friday always looks out for your best interest.
Melinda: They’ve been engaged longer than we’ve been married.
Me: Yes, although she’s going to send it to Jane first. I hope that she was so freaked out that she’ll change her mind and actually publish the thing.
Me: No, I don't think that. I had this professor in undergrad who said that who you were five years ago doesn't exist anymore. The only version of you that really exists at this moment is who you are now because everything you’ve dealt with in the interim has fundamentally changed who you are.
Nomad: What happened to her?
Agent Johnson: Then, where the fuck am I?
Tony: That wouldn’t be hard. The guy they had play me seriously looked nothing like me. OK, so who am I?
May: I’m not sure. Although I did find out that I am her SO in the other timeline. That came out over dinner yesterday.
Red phone: The fine print will always get you.
“They are two different people,” Karen responded, and Tony sighed.
Tony: No. I’m going to, at the very least, need to vent about how horrible my assistant interviews are going or the fact that Agent Agent is going to be here all week.
Tony: Because when the alien invasion /possibly world ending apocalypse happens, they want you on their side.
Me: They did target practice. The good news is the virtual shield works really well.
So this chapter is different than what I had outlined originally. The plan was either to do an in-person conversation between Leo and the Princess or go directly into a text messaging conversation with Lauren the other timeline. However, I did the initial draft of this chapter the day after the death of Chadwick Boseman. (Yes, the lag time is ridiculous right now). That made me want to do a chapter between the Princess and her big brother instead. Writing is how I deal with things. See my story, the Denial Phase, and most of my Dear Spock universe for proof.
Rogers: I think that counts as being resolved.
Tony: It’s Tony Potts-Stark.
Skye quake: Sort of, by accident. They’re kissing. I’m so happy they’re kissing.
Nomad: I apologized for you saying my name when having sex with her.
Tony: Yes. Also as sexy as I think that shield is, I realized that the design is kind of a waste of very rare materials that you can do so much with. The communication beads are awesome. Also the use of the nanotech fiber is brilliant. I’ve been dealing with tech envy for most of the day.
May: Pepper’s lawyers are along with representatives from the Wakandan government. The situation is complex.
To: MJ_Watson
Maybe they were hoping that being in close proximity with each other, they would just fuse back together again. Somebody has been watching too much bad science fiction.
“I’m really the wrong person to have this conversation with because I never actually did an undercover assignment over a month." Melinda says changing the subject.
Director Snookums: That's good because I don't want you hanging out with her owner. Seriously, what did I do to have to babysit two mad scientists?
Now more than four months removed from the situation and on a lot of medication that no longer consists of a fifth of bourbon a day, I realized that I would've regretted that. The Winter Soldier was a weapon brainwashed into the service of Hydra. There was no consent there. There’s no autonomy. No control over his actions. He was a weapon of Hydra and my anger should be focused on making sure every last part of that organization is burnt to the ground with the earth salted over.
“I’m not sure if I’m ready. I am enjoying this life.”
Me: Please don’t do anything illegal.
Tony: And I’m regretting that because we probably could’ve hooked up earlier. I’m regretting all the lost time I could’ve spent with your mouth.
Anthony: Since I mentioned Weird Al earlier, is UHF on your list? It's a weird cult classic from the 80s.
Me: He has a few more scars and one less appendage, but the DNA scan that I had Friday run matches what I have on file. Genetically, he is a Coulson at least.
“I will make sure of that boss,” Friday responded.
Subject: I’m glad you were able to talk to your mom.
Therapist Laura: No, she showed me messages to her, the ones where you have somehow convinced yourself that you’re culpable for Howard Stark’s murder because you were unable to keep your friend from falling off the train. Coupled with reports of your near death experience and the fact that Nomad seems to mostly concern himself with rescuing victims of kidnapping, I’m concerned.
Agent Laura: OK, Suarez and I came up with it, but Tony went along and managed to make the President see our point of view. We’re trying to demilitarize and rethink what the agency can do.
You shouldn’t be afraid to tell me that you have a boyfriend. I knew about Artie for a while. Almost since the beginning. We shared an apartment for how long? I saw the bite marks. You bruised like a peach back then.
Tony: I will probably do the same thing for Christmas in Malta. Unless I bring a bunch of shield agents with me. It depends on where we are with the Accords by then.
Anthony love: Baby, nothing makes sense right now. Honestly, I don’t believe half the stuff Deke told me. I tuned out half of what he told me and then told him to write it in a report. Ana, has he done that yet?
Nomad: So, are you ready to talk to me again? It’s been four days. I’m not mad that you called out my name while having sex with someone else, I don’t think I have a right to be. Although that does explain why Ms. Potts started giving me really strange looks.
Anthony: Agreed. The misogyny came out loud and clear in those 100 characters. I don’t really care about what he says about me, but Pepper doesn’t deserve this. Pepper didn’t even have sex with me until months after she became CEO.
You’re in DC trying to protect everyone and you don’t have to but you do. I admire and respect that about you. I thought you were selfish before, maybe because I read a little too much of the S.H.I.E.L.D. dossier or saw one too many things about you in the news, but you’re not that person. You wouldn’t have been by my side during the battle of New York, if you were who I thought you were.
“Okay, I love it here. The oven thingy perfectly reheats a breakfast sandwich in 90 seconds. I made yours too.” Flash said as he walked over to the kitchen counter to see MJ, who was now crying. MJ crying just scares the hell out of him. She’s not a crier.
Blue phone: All practical applications.
Me: What happened last night or rather this morning was off the books. In addition to telling me to be extra careful, they wanted to know if I’ve been in contact with Skye-quake-22 again. Apparently Scary and Agent see her as their work child which may be why she ran away from home after her boyfriend died for all of our sins.
Love: Do you trust the new Shield? Nick is not there anymore?
From: The Mechanic
HSBF: That's a plus.
HSBF: But it wasn’t really liberated?
“You should. For this to work, we should talk to each other, not just online, but in person. When we have the opportunity, like now."
TMNS: Understandable. You still didn’t deserve to be hurt like that.
Tony: And how old were you again when you lost your virginity?
Blue phone: I shouldn’t be surprised. What other areas do you have a PhD in?
The Mechanic: And now I’m okay with Talbot being the new National Security Advisor. Definitely an improvement over a Vice President that tries to kill you, and of course Ross. Not that it would be hard. Although please tell me that the Homeland Security lady doesn’t end up anywhere in the cabinet. I really should’ve paid more attention to reports about the new cabinet.
Counselor Laura: I understand. Also, as long as I'm here in 2023, I'm changing the contact to Tony Potts.
Me: I think we had this conversation before about you being a good role model.
Me: I mean, when you get back to the hotel room.
Red phone: I have PhDs in mechanical engineering, mathematics, computer engineering, chemistry, and Computer science. I also have Masters Degrees in business, biology, and history. And for the one that will surprise everyone, I have a Bachelor’s of Art in music.
TMNS: We’re on our way to the Lighthouse because, apparently, we're not allowed to go to the compound per Ms. Marvel’s cousin.
Nomad: But there’s probably a lot of good things in your genes, as well.
Anthony: Not with the new senator that hates me because apparently, I’m personally responsible for her mother dying during the battle of New York. I know that rage. I understand that rage. That rage almost led to a giant fuck up in Siberia.
“You're bisexual, though, so it wouldn't just be a beard thing. Sure, you're in a marriage with benefits relationship, but sex is still one of the benefits." Tony said, half-joking.
Me: Have you already RSVPed for the March 25 ceremony? I’m a bridesmaid.
Nomad: Sam isn’t just in it for the cool tech. None of us are. I think your relationship with Clint is more complicated than that. He got us a cake. It said, congratulations for finally getting your head out of your ass.
“It’s possible you develop coping strategies,” Tony suggested.
Captain tight pants: Of course you did.
“Really? What about that story you told me about Bali 2006?” Steve actually smirked at him.
“Friday, could you continue explaining.” Steve prompted, otherwise they were going to get very sidetracked.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely fabulous. It’s time for more Tony and Steve from the bad timeline. They are so hopeless, but maybe they’ll figure it out eventually. If it happened in one timeline, it could happen in another, right? We shall see. But progress has been made because Steve changed Tony’s name in his address book.
HSBF: What happened?
The new consultant: Afia is happy to be his daughter. She’s a person. She just came into the world a little differently.
Tony: You, as part of your cover identity. Although Daisy plans to be hands-on with the Campbell Foundation. Rio as well because there’s only so many times she can patch up Spider Senior and Bulletproof Pacifist’s boo-boos before she needs a challenge. Hunter will be helping as well because he needs a cover identity, so the Russian government doesn't find out who he actually is. There was an incident last year.
Anthony: I’ll make time for you. Also, apparently, the good Senator is anti-alien because her mom died during New York. So that’s another fuck up that we are all paying for.
Me: However for my boyfriend to be able to contact Clint would be weird. They never met and only a secret Avenger would have that information.
The Mechanic: The Boyfriend believes that the best hands are our own. I personally don’t trust my own hands. But I trust yours. Of the two of us, you were always the better decision-maker.
StarkAE: Good Plan. Where Is Spidey now?
I think [redacted] has a crush on Friday. Should I be concerned? They talk a lot more than he does to Karen. I know you got rid of the Coulson AI because he asked, but I kind of like Karen a little better. She’s okay with me talking about MJ. Not that I talk about MJ a lot but she is cool. You know what I’m going to end this conversation before you take away my email privileges.
Steve: I will take that as the spy version of “yes, I knew but wasn’t allowed to tell you.”
Cousin quake: Your too much like me before I joined shield. Although we all know it would’ve been Ned.
HSBF: How did the flight go?
Before she could ask how she ended up in a world where Steve married someone who is not Tony, she heard her phone ping. Laura quickly moved to the side of the room to look at her phone in peace. Steve was too busy calming his wife down to pay attention to her.
The new consultant: Now I think my cousin might be in Asgard to get you help?
FRIDAY: Do you realize that you referred to him as your boyfriend in an earlier text message?
Anthony: Oh, they are hampering. Not as bad as they would have with Mr. PR being in charge. But things are better because the current Director is the guy who told his superior officers to fuck off when told to stop looking for me in Afghanistan.
May: Steve deserves to be happy.
Morgan’s dad: You may be right. Hey princess, why can't I access the Deke files?
Tony Potts: How many attempts? You said there were seven for Uncle Daniel.
“Question three is ‘before making a phone call, do you ever rehearse what you're going to say?’"
Me: Despite the fact that this connection is super encrypted, I’m a little afraid to acknowledge the current status of my really complicated relationship with Steve Rogers. You told your BFF you had superpowers. I’m a little worried about this ending up on your Twitter account.
Red phone: Nothing I said could've been that improbable or did I warn you about not eating fish because it could give you random superpowers?
Tony: You have no idea how hard it was to work in that clause.
I have been in this strange place for 22 hours and 18 minutes, according to Avenger Friday. That’s about the only thing she’s allowed to tell me now. May has ordered her not to tell me anything else due to her last major revelation causing me to lose consciousness.
TMNS: Flash just told me that you know why he is totally 100% not interested in MJ.
Cuddle Bunny: I just hope that neither the UN nor any state see them as mere weapons.
“Good and I’m going to try to make it as easy on you as possible.” The director said with half a smirk.
“What happened to you?” May asked curious and concerned.
Anthony love: Not really. Seriously why would my other self make him the new head of R&D or whatever after having a kid?
This is almost an easy question, compared to everything else. If it wasn’t for love I don’t think I would be where I am right now. I don’t know if I would’ve survived this new time without people that love me. At the same time, my love for the people I knew before kept me holding on to the past for a long time. Thankfully, you gave me a reason to let go and move forward.
Nomad: 2, He said you were more qualified to handle this since you have a preteen. I don't get why he said that.
Me: I just love saying outgoing Secretary. I’m terrified of who’s going to be stepping into the position next.
Sincerely, May Riley-Parker
Me: I can’t tell you that. Although, the time difference is now worse. I will try not to get shot again.
The new consultant: Exactly. Now we just need to get him to read the books about polyandry.
HSBF: How can they already have homework?
Anthony love: Please explain how Hydra managed to get in league with a group called the Confederacy. That seems like a potential Hydra ally.
Tony: That would not be my aim. Okay, now I wouldn’t have been going for that because I see the flaws in the Accords as is. And the Watchdogs are still out there regardless of everything. But I feel like maybe if we laid all our cards on the table before hand, things would’ve been better. At least nobody would’ve ended up in the Raft.
“Well, it was hard not to pay attention after Mary started yelling at you. Especially with the super hearing.”
HSBF: Just a little narcissistic.
To be continued.
Red phone: I’m thinking prostitution. It is the world’s oldest profession. You were cute even before your muscles got muscles.
Nomad: Should I be concerned?
Cuddle Bunny: I’m okay.
“Some of which have been bad.”
HSBF: No remote suits either.
Tony: You’re going to have to find a specialist because you’re probably going to need one for Thor as well.
Morgan’s dad: Now you’re talking. Your brownies are better than hunters cookies but don’t tell him that.
“Exactly.”
Captain tight pants: I know
“Fiancé actually," Steve said as he placed his phone in his pocket. He also made sure to let James see the ring. It was a simple band with diamonds inlaid. Although the inscription inside, 'love always, Tony’ was his favorite part.
“This is totally why I prefer AI assistance. But occasionally, you need people.” Tony leaned over to kiss Steve at that moment, “Sometimes, people can be good.”
Love always,
Friday: Of course, Agent Barton.
Nomad: They were trying to protect you.
Jemma: I drink too much to be pregnant. Even with us, I'm not even sure if we could handle a child.
Purple arrow: Also, not surprising. Is Stark’s daughter-in-law with you?
Me: No comment.
Football Hunter: Both valid responses when you see the woman who forced you to have sex with her in a virtual prison and then went off the deep end when you said no in the real world. Have I apologized yet for my other selves’ love floppy joke? I’m never good at gauging the room.
“I’ll try. Clint will probably run away from me again, but I'll try." Laura said with a sigh.
Tony: Also, Robin would probably kick him in the nuts if he got rid of her best friend.
“22 times, including removing cookie crumbs from Steve’s mouth twice.” The AI answered.
Anthony: I can’t wait.
Blue phone: I think I should just be happy that you just didn’t assume that I was a virgin like everyone else.
“Note to self, incorporate something like that in my wedding vows to you,” Tony joked, Steve thought.
I’m going to behave and not put anything from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier for at least a month. However, I have thoughts. I will say, Tony managed to fix things a lot more than he thought he did. Apparently, he fixed more things than I thought he did. More to come as we go forward
Me: You don’t need it. You got this. See you in a couple of days. Love you.
“Or what’s the most ethical way to bring back half the life in the universe.” Steve has also been thinking about that since their conversation that morning.
To be continued
Xxxxx
Love: Well, Twitter is saying that Tony is lying on his deathbed and the shareholders are holding a candlelight vigil. Allegedly, he was suffocated by a paramedic. The image of Pepper crying as she was leaving the hospital really sold it. Okay, the fact that she punched out the reporter really sold it. I had to tranquilize Nomad a second time because of that, after he made my other eye black and blue.
Me: Talk to your James. He’s your best friend and you shouldn’t keep this from him. Also telling him doesn’t necessarily mean the end of the project. There might be a way to keep the research going.
HSBF: I’m here whenever you need me.
Me: What on purpose?
Tony: Hey, I can do holographic interfaces. It’s just that I want your phone to be almost inconspicuous.
Tony Potts: So good news, I had lunch with Capt. Tight Pants. It did not end in bloodshed or one of us running out of the room crying.
HSBF: What about the Bulletproof Pacifist? Have you been hanging out with him?
“You’re the one who disrupted my experiment. I’m not the person you know back at the lighthouse. A lot has happened in the last 5 1/2 years. Like me having to take care of the wife you abandoned Just so you can shack up with Hunter." Deke screamed.
Counselor Laura: So, do you feel less like taking a drink now?
Blue phone: But it didn’t stick. Wait, you said that they were friends. Was Coulson her dead friend?
“I never understood why it was so random.” Tony wondered out loud. “From a math perspective, I get it, but from a human perspective, I don’t.”
Me: So, this is considered an emergency now?
Person my boss is in love with: What really happened to Ana Jarvis?
“Yes.”
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely wonderful.
“We could have if you would’ve woke up the first time I tried 25 minutes ago,” Steve remarked.
Okay, now I miss Tasha even more. I just want to come home.
Me: That’s understandable, especially because we’ve had so many close calls. I am really hoping you don’t get shot again. Here’s hoping the Royal genius did her thing.
Person my boss is in love with: Friday, can you please send me a picture of Tony and Lila together?
Kitty brother: That is not our path. Things have changed. I doubt that we will be battling Thanos as you remove an infinity stone from Vision’s head.
Tony: I can’t wait to look in our wastebasket when I get home. I love your artwork.
“No, I think they actually like you.”
Red phone: Does it still feel like that some days?
“Someday, when I'm not driving, I want your full relationship history, but I don't think you're ready to tell me that yet.” Tony has lots of questions.
Me: Or can you wait that long to decide?
In addition, the monolith dropped off in my lab to have been studying for the last two days does seem to be capable of generating trans-dimensional portals, thus leading credence to the story. Currently I am trying to determine how the monoliths create portals.
“Not at the cost of losing you.” Fitz argued.
Me: Of course he won’t. He never talks about anything not since his uncle Ben died. He did love the ninja turtles growing up. Let’s go with that.
Me: Fine, although I wouldn't have to resort to sexting if I could actually be in the same country as Cuddle Bunny without a SWAT team being dispatched. Is there anything you can do about that? I’m even afraid to meet him on the island because you might not track me there, but Ross would.
Me: And it would be worse if the world knew that the satellite explosion that took out dozens of satellites was actually a warhead being safely detonated because it contained a gas that would’ve turned most of Europe into primitive superpowered zombies or something similar. I was a little too stunned to completely pay attention to everything going on in the briefing.
CoulsonPJ: Ross keeps remarking that Stark is dating a Chris Evans look alike, but thankfully hasn’t put everything together yet, according to our DOS contact. Although after the package announcement in 15 minutes, I’m sure he’ll have other things to worry about.
Ana 2018: Dir. Stark-Rogers was distracted and did not activate the childproofing protocol for those files until Lily accessed the files. Access locks have firmly been put in place, and she is unable to watch again.
Although this is labeled as an interlude, it does start with an actual in person conversation because that was added later when I realized we haven’t had enough Tony Steve lately interaction. Also, because it was added later. The first part did not go for the beta process.
Nomad: Jesus. What is wrong with some people?
Me: I will. Farewell, Sugarplum. Love you.
Blue phone: Yes.
Nomad: You did say that you were happier in the school with your intellectual peers.
Purple arrow: They blamed the cocaine. I can’t wait until they find out Asgardians don’t do orientations.
This was another chapter written during the WandaVision episodes. They made me want to work on the story, even though I probably should have worked on my Star Trek stories. I’m finishing off the next batch of Star Trek stories before working on the next batch of chapters for the story. Which I’m going to be working on during what if. That’s going to be fun.
“That’s why the Princess told Dr. Suarez the truth. That’s why she wants to keep you here for observations, even though you’re no longer in the containment room.”
HSBF: Yes. So there really was a mission?
Red phone: Your math is correct.
Steve: Not everybody gets married for the reasons we did.
Red phone: Lately, it hasn’t been.
“It can provide you with better solutions.” Tony finished for Steve.
Blue phone: I am not entirely sure you would make a very good diplomat.
: Sergeant James Buchanan "Bucky" Barnes a.k.a. the Winter Soldier a.k.a. Bucky Barnes a.k.a. White Wolf (as the children are referring to him). Murdered Stark’s parents in 1991 due to being brainwashed and tortured by Hydra. Before kidnapping and torture was best friend to Steve Rogers since childhood. He is currently doing well on his treatment regimen, including therapy. He is starting to share anecdotes about his childhood with the Captain. Contrary to what Steve believes, James always knew of Steve’s relationship with Artie.
The new consultant: Okay, I can see how that alone would warrant a presidential meeting.
The Boy in the Chair: And why is he throwing up?
Nomad: Did she say that before or after the last appearance almost got you killed?
Counselor Laura: Definitely, although I'm not sure if things will work the way we think they are. We don't know when the purple ass hole grabbed some of the stones. The Thanos in my timeline may already have some. Yes, you guys can help us keep him from getting more, but you might need to get some stones from other places to complete your gauntlet.
HSBF: If I can’t count New York you can’t either.
Always yours, Cuddle Bunny
Tony: Good. What about Scott?
CoulsonPJ: You think everybody's going to recognize Stefan?
Me: Right now, my favorite board member, Perez is chatting among her fellow members convincing them to replace me with James Leopold. Monday after the stock market will do its thing and you know it will do its thing, she will make the suggestion that I retire and let Dr. Leopold take my place.
Nomad: I understand
“That’s good.” Why did she feel like there was more to it than that?
Me: Probably, and most likely another reason why Agent was told to hand in his resignation.
Nomad: His wife was in charge of the event. Maybe even the Foundation. Tony wasn't clear.
Monkey Lover 2: Much better thoughts. Although I still want to know about the alibi, you can tell me that when I get home.
“I am the AI Mr. Stark created to run Peter’s suit,” The AI explained.
BITC: I would never voluntarily sleep in the same room as Thompson, let alone bed. What was he working on?
To be continued
StarkAE: You know you would’ve done the same thing.
“Actually Leo was dropped off in his bed and he waited a few months before even contacting me so I’ve only been not relaying the situation to you since July,” Fitz replied.
Time sent: 9/1/2016 16:42:12
Purple Arrow: You already mentioned. Get back to your own timeline and send the stones here to start building our own gauntlet as we prevent your purple monster from doing to you what he did to us.
Counselor Laura: I thought you didn’t want to know?
Tony: Remember, I told you that I was going to a playoff soccer match with Monkey Lover and the supposedly reformed doctor who made mind controlled zombies last spring?
Morgan’s dad: Isn’t that usually the job of my Head of R&D. Who incidentally hasn’t checked-in in about two days?  Despite his save the world sabbatical, I still expect to see him playing on my server. Is there something you need to tell me?
Me: How did none of this stuff come out during the confirmation hearings?
The Mechanic: Wait, what?
Me: 6. It’s been over since Halloween. Haven’t you realized by now that my best skill is pretending everything is normal when it’s not? It’s why the ATCU is hating interrogating me.
“So far has any of your other friends reacted badly to you having a boyfriend?”
So to make up for the ridiculously long stretches of the story from everybody else’s perspective, we have more in person Tony/Steve interaction. This conversation takes place a few hours after the last one. It’s midmorning in Johannesburg.
Me: The thing covered in peanut sauce was probably fried in sunflower oil which means this wasn’t his fault. Thankfully, Ms. Potts keeps an EpiPen on her due to her strawberry allergy. However, Tony, Ms. Potts and Agent May are on their way to the hospital.
CoulsonPJ: Outside of Stark apparently showing up, how did your conversation with Stefan go?
Cuddle fiancé: The truth
Love: Because Phil always has a plan B so he doesn’t have to negotiate with assholes.
"Yes you can tell her how tough it is to babysit my boyfriend and she can tell you how hard it is to babysit my boyfriend's ex-girlfriend's daughter."
Red phone: I’m just going to go along with that epic subject change for the sake of avoidance, I mean, peace.
Nomad: That time, yes.
Anthony love: So apparently there’s an even worse future out there. Cracked earth, inhuman slave trade, and humans on the brink of extinction, thanks to the Kree. Did you meet any Kree yesterday?
Chief mechanic: Yes, I fucking can be angry about somebody trying to turn a dead Vision into a weapon no matter what timeline it happens in.
The Mechanic: Common sense prevails.
Me: No. Actually, they’re here because somebody has to make sure Happy doesn’t try to punch you. Not that it would hurt you.
Me: I’m marginally less mad at you.
Nomad: You're the guy who cares. You’re the guy who sees things 10 steps ahead. You’re the one who is looking at the big picture.
HSBF: Do I want to know?
Me: I have a reason. Several actually. I'm not running away. I am taking care of my problems directly. Unlike some people who are waiting for their rich boyfriend's lawyers to sort things out.
“I am not surprised. We should probably avoid water due to both of our issues. I haven’t tried restraints since Afghanistan because that wasn’t something Pepper Pot was into, so I don’t know if I could do it or not. And I have too many daddy issues for that type of role-play. Although, most other scenarios are still a possibility but no costumes because daddy issues and I sort of walked into his kink closet when I was four and I am still a little disturbed by it.”
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all wonderful. I’m sorry for the wait between chapters. It’s been so long we now know that AOS is getting another season, even if it won’t premiere until after Avengers 4. Real life was evil and due to the circumstances, I had to switch betas at least temporarily. Ursula was kind enough to do this chapter and the next one so I could start updating again.
Iron Dad: Even then, I tell you more than most people outside your father and the inner circle. For example, I’m not preventing Ana from giving you Stark pads full of the alternate history of the darkest timeline.
“I don’t know. Maybe the universe knew we could set things right again. Strange said something like that to me before disappearing.” He told Steve.
D FitzSimmons: I feel like telling you about Bobo and Hunter in this timeline is definitely going to lead to you being further in the bottle. If such a thing were even possible at this point.  I don't want that at all. I don’t want you in pain.
“I want to be here.” He really does.
Steve: This is true.
"Which has me nervous enough to wish that I could drink wine for something other than the taste." Steve said, pointing to the glass of wine on the table from lunch.
Please note that I am unable to upload the chapter to fanfiction.net at the moment. As soon as I’m able to I will upload the chapter there but I think a lot of you read stories on both sides.
Me: Ross did not count on Coulson’s team finding me first.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if Ross was suggested to be Secretary of State by the guy who ordered Manhattan to be bombed. Hydra would want to keep the world unstable,” Steve argued.
Boss: I’m not lying. Agent Melinda May formally Garner did work in HR at Shield before helicarriers ended up in the Potomac.
Me: Yes, but I was so busy trying to keep Spider Brat from dying that bad guys got away except for the one that got crushed by a car. He’s in the ICU under armed guards.
Director May Rogers: I agree. I’m tired of Steve using me to avoid his Tony feelings. They’re exhausting.
Anthony: I also get my own share of marriage proposals and nude pictures. Along with a lot of paternity suits, but those are extra ridiculous now that I no longer have a sperm count. Those are also filtered out. Actually they should've filtered yours out of your fan mail as well I have had my people going through the Avengers mail since the beginning.
“No, but you are my Leo.” Jemma placed an arm around him and this time, thankfully, he didn’t pull away. “We were friends long before we were lovers and we can be friends again. I want to be your friend.”
“Okay, what are the other things you like about me?” Steve asked between bites of his churro.
Tony: I am not having flashbacks of your brainwashed and crazy BFF snapping my mother’s neck. I’m personally a little shocked about that.
HSBF: I'm sorry.
P Parker: We were, but because the Mumbai agreement was ratified yesterday, the president called him in. I think they wanted to get the pardon out of the way, so they could get to wedding planning. Although I don’t believe they are doing the wedding on April 28 anymore.
Me: This is so embarrassing. I am really glad you are Captain Prude. Although you could’ve told me we are providing a 16-year-old with a really skewed romantic education. Did she at least fix the encryption?
Venom: We still need to talk about him being Spider-Man first. Which won’t be that hard since we're going to be sharing a room at the Lighthouse as soon as I’m freed from medical. Which will apparently happen once the all-hands meeting is over on deck 52.
May: When will our Simmons be leaving for treatment? She needs to be somewhere else if she really wants to make progress. She will also need to detox.
Anthony: One of my favorite things to do growing up was just to hang out with her. No expectations. She just liked spending time with me. I missed it when she was gone, even after I got shipped off to boarding school.
It helps that you’re watching over Tony. I feel like I should apologize for half the ridiculous things he asked of you while you two were wherever you were. No, I haven’t told him that much about our relationship. It’s private.
Welcome to the “bad choices were made” timeline. Always keep your hands and feet inside the car.
Purple Princess 2018: I thought it was a good idea at the time. I was a baby AI.
“The princess genius figured out how to undo the Hydra programming without wiping out everything else.”
Anthony love: So please hurry up and text me back. Because I do not want to deal with a pissed-off Agent May. I’m not 100% sure she’d ever forgiven Leo for icing her to prevent her from using the big book of evil everything.
As for Football Hunter, that is Lance Hunter. For those of you not watching Agents of SHIELD, think the 616 Clint version of Hawkeye, complete with complicated marriage to Mockingbird, but more British. Lance Hunter was last seen in season 3 being disavowed by Shield to avoid an international incident with Russia. Actually, the last time he was seen was in season five, when he rescued Leo Fitz from a secure government facility that doesn’t exist on paper. That hasn’t happened yet in this timeline. Right? We shall see.
Me: Friday sent you that song, didn’t she? Her music choices keep getting more absurd.
HSBF: I thought you said things were better?
Sorry, I can’t do anything about the brother. 13 is a weird age, and he’s probably not going to come out of it for a while. Hopefully, the stupidity will wear off sooner rather than later. If I could, I would send the other kids to Malta as well. However, I know them too well at this point. Also, at least one of them has field training. The other one has been trained by Pepper which can be just as lethal. Anyway, I’ll be back soon.
Purple arrow 2018: Things are better with Phil. We've talked a lot, especially since the separation. He's on your side, by the way. He thinks I'm a fucking moron for leaving, and he's right. I was stupid; I shouldn't have left.
TMNS: Can we just leave it at that you’re on my list of people I care about?
Me: So what do you think of the rooms? How are the views?
Counselor Laura from 2023: I thought things were better between you two. Which kid? Do you think you would remember to send a text message if one of your kids were missing?
Me: Good news, Benji now has decent blackmail material on that Flash fan boy. I think I mentioned this earlier.
Steve: We always do better when we are together.
Purple Arrow: You already mentioned that most of the notes are missing, and what you do have is not understandable. Really Stark can’t understand it?
Me: Maybe in your timeline, he didn’t get out of the truck before what you are looking for tried to eat him?
Nomad: Are you joking?
Red phone: Maybe Barton is the only one who can do a relationship with a civilian. I can't.
Tony: Yes, it’s that important that I would have woken you up in the middle of the night if I realized it was the middle of the night. I still thought you were only about seven hours ahead.
Anyway, I wish you good health and a speedy recovery. Robert.
Me: She also brought Agent Agent with her for our little slumber party.
“They are not right for each other.” He argued.
Me: I remember you saying something about almost going on a date with him after a Russia mission.
Nomad: I'm really sorry you had to read all those messages. None of the sex stuff was true. Anthony just made that up to make it too uncomfortable for people to read.
“Your Highness, I didn’t realize you were there. You also brought reinforcements. In the form of a teenager. Why is there a teenager here?” Simmons asked confused. “The other teenager, not you Your Highness.”
Me: Mostly for doing it just after Peggy's funeral. And I didn’t sleep with Jackie. I’m not that big of a slut.
Counselor Laura: Maybe. Friday did just show me what happened yesterday and I’m now even more concerned. I also want to smack my husband upside the head and remind him to stay in one piece because his babies want him back.
Purple Arrow: Not necessarily sanctioned ones.
I realize that I made some bad choices. Not agreeing to the ideal of the Accords because in theory, I think they’re necessary. I don’t always like rules and oversight, but sometimes they can be helpful.
Purple arrow 2023: That is something I will always help you with.
Captain tight pants: You can tell them to F off. Not all of us are Tony Stark.
I am waiting until the next chapter to explain how Loki and Black Widow fall into the continuity of the story. I want to give everybody time to watch before I explain or start throwing the word variance around.
Nomad: You neglected to mention that.
Pepper pot: How can it be worse?
As Hunter walks into the West Coast facility with the Princess and the newest member of the team walking behind him, he sees Leo and Simmons fighting over a backpack. Leo stopped when he noticed the three of them.
Counselor Laura: It feels that way. Look, we need you at the meeting this time. We know that you were with Simmons while she was working on her plan. You can tell us what she was working on.
HSBF: You need a new board of directors.
Blue phone: I know you’re the one who drew that because it was too technical even if the color scheme is very muted for you
Me: That’s an interesting way to put it. I prefer mind controlled zombies.
OK, I think you’re right getting the Director involved. Maybe, he can come up with a national security reason for why we can’t even give the New York Times a fake version of this interview. I’m willing to do it for Benji but I’d rather not if there’s a way out of it. Also, of course you were smart enough to figure out how to answer number 25 in an email because you’re a lot smarter than me.
It is now time to spend some time with the more functional couple in the story. Not that it would be hard to be more functional than Tony and Steve because I don’t think they actually acknowledge that they’re dating yet. If they have, they've obviously haven't told the other one yet.
Anthony: Because there's months’ worth of content there. Dr. Fitz and Dr. Simmons are kind of obsessed with the show. The next time I am forced to be at the Playground, I'll ask them to make you a starter list. If I stay well behaved, it will probably be a while before I get back there. Unless Senator Hateful has another mood swing.
Me: I’ll be on your side.
Me: So glad that you trust me.
If you read this chapter after watching Infinity War, did it make you cry? It made me cry.
“I know the Steve of your time is with Tony. I saw a picture of them kissing at Christmas on your phone.” Steve tells her, and she can see a hint of sadness in his eyes. She knows that look because she sees it every time Steve Stark Rogers is forced to part from Tony Stark Rogers.
Me: Because you ask this time.
Captain Tight Pants: I'm not mad that she moved on. I'm glad that she found somebody. From Jackie's stories, Peggy’s husband was a good man. Evidently, I met him once. According to Jackie, I saved his life.
Nomad: Probably. That’s not the only thing you’re worried about, is it?
Girl Friday: I don’t think that’s fair. [Six more pouting face emojis] I’m an Avenger. I should know these things. I’m going to check on Peter. I now must deliver a Stark pad to him and the not-a-boyfriend.
Melinda: I need to go. Laura’s waking up.
The new consultant: That explains why we brought groceries in addition to pizza and bagels. Good pizza. Your favorite white pizza with sausage. You're going to have to explain the family awkwardness when I get there.
Counselor Laura: I can’t tell you most of it because it’s classified, but Flash and Peter are sort of friends now.
Me: At the very least they were obsessed with keeping me from getting married, to Cuddle Bunny anyway. Thankfully, the Supreme Court took care of that.
“Tony calls her Ms. Marvel. Quake saved her family from the Watchdogs  and then they had to be relocated.” Steve tells him.
Chief Monkey Lover: Is there a reason why I can’t access anything regarding Simmons? Along with Deke’s report from yesterday. Ana told me he wrote one.
Tony: Yet.
Steve: I know. I’m just starting to realize how problematic it will be bringing people back after 5 ½ years. Where are the Khans even going to live? We sold their house. We put the money in a trust.
“I just want everyone to know that you’re mine.” He said falling beside him.
Warning: Discussion of past sexual assault and mental illness
"You scare me when you babble like this,” Steve remarked.
This conversation takes place a few hours after the last one.
Hunter: That’s good. Did you tell her?
Nomad: So in this particular case, how did the bad guy die if neither one of you pulled the trigger?
Tony: Pepper does. It's five years, and I'm still not used to the non-Happy driver. So I try not to use the service even though Sasha is lovely. But I will float the idea by Pepper. Then you can ask your daughter if she is OK with that.
Me: It never does. It’s too much in our blood.
Monkey Lover 2: My mum?
HSBF: So maybe it’s a good thing that you’re taking care of him.
SimmonsJA: Thank you. Although I was referring to everything Ross related. Friday sent us the video of what happened in Siberia. Don’t worry, we did not show it to the Director because we have some common sense.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all so fabulous.
D Fitzsimmons: According to the wizard, I didn't go 5 1/2 years into my past. The past that I landed in is another timeline created by Bobo getting thrown back in time and making a dam. Which again shouldn't surprise me because I thought I was going to get blown up by the monolith landing here.
“I feel stupid for not realizing you guys were not together for the last five years. I should’ve seen it.” Steve was currently sporting his wounded puppy dog expression.
Tosha: That was nearly 8 years ago. I’m over it.
Purple Arrow: I wish we were not in this position.
Also, even though I'm the boss, apparently we have an all-hands at 2 PM. This means I am still not going to get to spend any quality time with my Fiancé yet. I’ve barely managed to get any kissing in.
“We really need to work with Robin about not telling certain people certain things.” Shuri sighed.
Tony: But because this was essentially an excuse for a booty call with my new boyfriend it would have been awkward. You know I adore her, so I’m not going to subject her to us being completely in love with each other. Your bite marks have already healed, but I have multiple hickeys.
Anthony: That’s complete bullshit.
HSBF: How many videos were uploaded?
Blue phone: Are you drunk again?
HSBF: I heard about her helping with Laura. I’m glad she won’t have to read anymore messages like that.
Anthony: So now they have half a team and we have half a team.
Nomad: I did care a lot about her. I thought we would get to build something together after.
(See the end of the chapter for
Nomad: It’s been less than 24 hours since we last talked.
“We would’ve been told.”
Blue phone: Badly.
Tony Potts: That's not going to happen to you because we are going to play keep away with the stones. The fewer he has, the easier it will be for your Avengers to take care of him.
Nomad: That's not good. Pepper has a right to be upset with me. I hurt you.
Love: Fucking Bastards. I want to shove an arrow up his ass. I also want to get Corey that video game he wanted, but you told me I’m not allowed to reward bad behavior.
Melinda: Its best not to. She is also now an LMD named Afia. Apparently, it means a daughter born on Friday. To help us she needed a physical form. Apparently, Leo has been working on this plan for weeks.
May: It’s good that you’re still working on your degree. I know the Laura here always wanted to go back to school but could never find the time.
Chief mechanic: Ross ended up president after the snap because everybody else in the line of succession got snapped. It was a bad few years until they were able to do elections again in 2022.
Also, I actually worked in one of my crazy typos into the story because it made an amusing joke. See if you can spot it.
Tony Potts: I look forward to dealing with that if I ever get a boyfriend.
Nomad: Yes I do.
Me: The most popular theory is that Mrs. Windom-West holds the same very anti inhuman beliefs as her spouse and did not want to be part of a charity that actually supports inhuman rights. Instead of resigning like a sane person, she believed that my demise would keep that from happening. Or maybe that was what her husband thought. They’re still trying to figure that part out.
Venom: I’m not. I am actually trying to get Parker to get his head out of his ass. It’s exhausting.
Me: Can? That's a different question entirely.
Purple Princess: This is the other reason why we're on the Avenger channel right now. Only one of you has diplomatic immunity.
Anthony love: You know what just hurry home so I can explain all the stuff in person and maybe we can have stress release sex. That would be nice.
Me: And so much more really.
“Like they need more sugar.” Tony mumbled to himself, but Steve could still hear him.
“Your tears or theirs?” Steve asked.
Blue phone: One package of raw sugar per 4 ounces. No cream unless it is real 1% milk.
The Melinda May from the “bad life choices timeline” will also be referred to as May-Rogers and sometimes just Mrs. Rogers or Melinda. I just realized I now have three Mays in this story. Why do I hate myself? Will there be a fourth? I am not telling yet, but I will try to be as clear as possible with which May I’m referring to and will try very hard not to write something where I am referring to all of them at the same time. I’m not that much of a masochist.
MJ: Also, apparently, Loki and the CCO of Stark industries just disappeared from the streets of New York. James Leopold is also now trending.
HSBF: I could see how that would be a problem. I didn’t hate your dad, but I always felt that he had more money than sense.
HSBF: Makes sense.
The Big Boss: He said he would be done tonight.
Anthony love: Some of the dirt about my now dead number two made it on to the Internet. They believe she died in a car crash yesterday, but some of the stuff about how she treated Ruby is now trending on Twitter. That’s bad on its own. I’m regretting NYC child services getting involved because they still don’t like me very well.
“Things are already not looking very good for her. The Russia thing would just be the cherry on top. I love that she’s going down so spectacularly, even if I’m not in the country to see it. This gets me off almost as much as you,” Tony said pulling Steve over to him for one of those earth shattering, can’t really think, type kisses that Steve was way too good at. It probably has something to do with the fact that Steve doesn’t need to breathe as much as everyone else.
“Malta?” Steve asked.
Pepper pot: You know you could have sent me a text message first to let me know that you were taking our nanny away for Avenger business
Anthony: No, you’re not. Happy may not be ready to move on, but I am so moving on to you. I can’t wait to see you look all sexy in a suit. Maybe something by Tom Ford. Thankfully, I have your uniform measurements on file.
Me: I’m doing good. Staying busy on various projects.
May: It’s a start. Although it won’t help if Thanos can still get all the stones.
Blue phone: I'm just being realistic
StarkAE: Which is kind of a downside when I‘m trying to leave a hickey on Sugarplum. But in this case it will probably keep Aunt Mama Bear from eviscerating us all.
Me: Actually it’s kind of more than that. When Wanda was mind fucking us, before she was on our side, she made me have a vision of you dying in my arms. It is part of the reason why I thought Ultron would be a good idea. I can’t lose you and I make some really fucked of choices when presented with that possibility.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, you’re not.”
"Good to know you had another plan. Anyway, I made recordings for all the important people in my life. Sort of a last confession. I made one for Pepper, but I made one for you too.” Tony acknowledged
Anthony: Queens and his aunt along with Pepper pot and the boy toy.
“Shit! I didn’t know. Okay, they are definitely coming to Thanksgiving at the compound. We’re also doing something fun on black Friday. Can we do paintball at the compound?”
Anthony: Not until you got your new costume anyway.
Monkey lover 2: I am grateful. I couldn’t get through this without you.
“But he figured it out anyway?” Steve asked.
Tony: I would really hate for Robin’s prediction of becoming Morgan’s sister to come true because you and Mrs. May-Rogers got lost in the stream of time. The kids have already lost enough parents, and Morgan is only as good as she is because of Pepper. I’m an absolute mess.
Pepper pot: What?
Tony Potts: Maybe not. I could totally screw up in new ways.
“I’m not your Dr. Radcliffe. I am actually your friend. I’ve also been raised to respect objects like the book. I know better than to read it. In addition, I know what I’m doing and this is going to work. I’m going to go prepare Afia,” The Princess said leaving them alone.
Me: I’m trying to pay attention. This is the most interesting wedding I’ve been to.
Cuddle fiancé: You go on telling yourself that. Nat says we will be at the Playground in 40 minutes.
Me: In this country. But in some of the other countries that you’ve been in recently, it could be a problem. Actually you going against assholes solo who like to kidnap innocent kids already makes you a big target. You’re worried about me getting picked up by Ross’s flunkies and I’m worried about you getting killed because you pissed off the wrong guy.
HSBF: I hope all is going well for you. Since we’re staying somewhere with a kitchen and have two extra people, Sam made his grandma‘s mac & cheese. He had to sub some of the ingredients but it was nice to have a home-cooked meal.
Me: Are we acknowledging that I bought you a ring?
HSBF: Sometimes I worry about you. Remember teenagers could be reading this.
“The boss said to keep an eye on you.” Davis responded.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely fabulous.
Nomad: I'm glad that you're better.
“Not really. I really hope that Peter, Kemal, and Lily bear don’t see that." Steve really didn’t want to see it either.
TMNS: He found out accidentally. I haven’t told anybody the truth.
Purple arrow: No one buys it.
Purple arrow: So, my other self took out Ross? I’m surprised I haven’t done that yet. I should’ve done it when I dealt with the Watchdogs.
Time sent: 8/27/2016 12:35:11
Tony Potts: So, have you talked to you're not a husband yet? The sooner we get any information he has, the sooner we can begin Operation: Infinite Keep Away.
Steve: But we would’ve just had another reason for Laura to lose consciousness.
“OK,” Steve mumbled as he took the seat next to her bed.
After reading the text messages, Laura was 100% sure who was writing, but decided that she should write the person back. Therefore, she started to type.
Anthony love: So today or maybe yesterday at this point, on the day that happens to coincide with when Fitz bounced back to our timeline, two people from that timeline came to our timeline. One who, according to multiple DNA tests is the grandchild of the Fitzsimmons is stuck here. The other is Clint, who managed to take his sort of wife back to his timeline.
Boss: No. I want someone from that motley crew to be able to get a hold of me when Cuddle Bunny does stupid shit. He has the self-preservation skills of a slug.
S Carter: I think I have a lead on Purple Arrow.
"I realize that now. At the very least I have Monkey Lover wanting to help me. I feel like it's his life mission to prevent an apocalypse. I wanted to bring him but apparently he has to spend some quality time with Dr. Suarez which is good because I worry about the kid sometimes."
Anthony: Stefan is 35 so it's not that much of a problem, especially because, thank God I don’t look 46 which is a small miracle considering all the drugs I did during the 90s. I did not deal well with my parents or Jarvis dying at all.
Me: No, you’re not. But thanks for saying it. It’s okay that you found love with someone else. And I know you’re worried, but mom always said that her friend Tony was a stubborn bastard so I think he will pull through. I’ll make sure somebody updates you from the hospital.
D FitzSimmons: I don’t want to hear what Bobo one is telling him. Yes, I gave Daisy over to the blues. Do I regret that now that I no longer live in a dystopic hellscape? Yes. In the dystopic hellscape, it was a necessary evil. Well, that dystopic hellscape. I lived through a few.
Blue phone: I thought you were already told you had to see a therapist, otherwise Colonel Rhodes was going to send you to the crazy spa. What is the crazy spa exactly? I assume rehab.
TMNS: I don’t know because I haven’t even told the boy in the chair that I’m demisexual queer romantic.
Cuddle Bunny: So how are you going to deal with him?
Red phone: The fact that you’re acknowledging my Howard issues just warms my heart. However, Agent Scary is glaring at me so I have to go.
This conversation takes place immediately after the preceding text message conversation.
Agent L. Barton: Even an OD would have been helpful.
Me: That is true.
Tony: I am surprised Avenger Friday hasn’t alerted you to my presence yet.
Me: Which was true even when it was you.
Purple arrow 2018: I know. I've been reading through the reports. I actually spent all night going through them. I'm not sure my other self's presence would have made a difference. I just throw arrows.
Friday: You need to read it anyway
Me: I knew only speaking to each other in Spanish at board meetings would pay off. Perez is also the only one who is not an absolute asshole. She is our token good member. Why didn’t we kick out all of Obadiah’s cronies?
Anthony: It was a good suggestion. Hate like that will get you killed eventually. I only survive Siberia by your grace.
After they got to Malta and Piper cleaned up Steve’s wounds, the couple mostly stayed in the master bedroom on the property. The only break was two nights ago when they had dinner together with the other secret Avengers and tried to talk about what each side needed from a new Accords. Surprisingly, that went better than Steve thought it could which meant nobody ended up covered in bruises and there was no property damage. That was all he could hope for, at this point.
“Because after a night of political schmoozing, we made out like teenagers and I had to take two showers. Otherwise I would’ve done something else I did as a teenager.”
To: Riley_Parker
Monkey Lover 2: I think my baby brother has a closer relationship with Tony. Before we just occasionally emailed and messaged each other semi-anonymously until the Framework happened. This time around, he keeps checking up on me and invites my counterpart to dinner a lot. I’m not sure my baby brother as you put it would have decided to take Radcliffe’s side over his girlfriend because he was so desperate for a father figure because he has Tony Stark filling that role.
Red phone: If you hadn’t become Captain America, what would you have done instead?
Tony: And she did so again in person after the fainting. And I forgave her and speaking of forgiveness, the president is willing to pardon you.
Captain tight pants: I hope they find somebody.
The Mechanic: Jeffrey brought out charts?
Anthony: OK, they don’t have the arms dealer himself to interrogate because they're probably still scraping him off the floor of a random warehouse in Baltimore, but they have all the other bad guys. Really it’s a win-win for everyone. They found the Shield agent that was liberating tech because apparently he believed in the Watchdogs’ philosophy and felt Shield wasn’t doing enough.
Counselor Laura: I try not to question my Tony and Steve's relationship. Which from this point forward, I will refer to as the Stark-Rogers.  It's too headache-inducing.
I had lunch with Ms. Watson earlier and went over my contract with the Avengers Initiative. I can’t believe you’re paying me almost triple my current salary. And that’s not including the housing and a tutor for [Redacted]. You don’t have to do that, but I appreciated.
PS: Apparently your efforts with the cookies were futile. There’s a giant box from your aunt sitting in my foyer. Could you send me her email address so I can send her a thank you email?
“Okay, next question.” Tony really hopes they move to safer ground.
“Okay, the next question is ridiculous," Steve said, avoiding his question. Again Tony let it go because they still had a while before they got to Manhattan.
“Oh God, I hate this thing,” Tony said as soon as he read the next question. “Do you want to talk about our screwed-up childhoods? Because I don’t want to talk about our screwed-up childhoods. Your dad was an abusive piece of shit. My father was just not there because he was too busy with SI, shield, and everything else.” Along with whatever booze was on-premises, but he doesn’t have the energy to get into Howard’s alcoholism.
He was trying to finish up his present for Tony before the man left and Steve was pretty sure from the bits and pieces of the emergency board meeting that he overheard that was going to be sooner rather than later. He was really looking forward to being with Tony until Wednesday, but that’s not the type of life they have.
StarkAE: That’s all I ask.
“You were.”
SimmonsJA: Well that’s easy to agree on. I’m glad that I only have to liaison with the assistant secretary of OES. I think I may strangle the man if I had to see him in person. But what about the more important issues like the man who murdered your parents.
Me: I’m not going back to Shield. I’m not even that happy that you somehow convinced Linda to join.
When will you be back from DC? Connor is being an emotionless prick. I know mom is stuck in another timeline, but that’s no excuse. You should know we made contact with her this morning. I got to speak with her. She’s safe. Which is good.
Me: Good to know I won the pool but why are you not having this conversation with your counselor friend?
Ursula
The New Consultant: I know. Although I didn’t hear about the necklace part.
“That’s not good.” Steve tells Tony.
Cuddle bunny: Do you agree with her?
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely fabulous. You are probably expecting more in person conversations between Tony and Steve, but every time they are in a room together right now, there hasn’t been a lot of conversing. After four years, the sexual tension has to get out somehow. But it’s now Monday in Mumbai and Tony’s SI meetings give them the perfect time to actually have a conversation or two.
This conversation takes place about a day after the last one. See, we won’t be spending nine or 10 conversations on the same day. Tony is in a meeting which means he is text messaging Steve again. It’s been so long I had to go back and look to see what conversation we were on.
Monkey lover 2: You broke up again?
Tony: Baker just choked on his $200 champagne. I hope the paparazzi that snuck in got pictures. I want that to be my new home screen.
Okay, it’s not good that they now have their own domestic branch of Watchdogs to deal with. But I feel like they will do something about it. More than the US did before the pre-election blackouts and Senator Hateful’s arrest.
Tony: That was brave.
HSBF: Maybe we should reduce how often we are communicating with each other by adopting something similar to what Laura does.
From: Pepper_pot
Nomad: I’m not answering that question.
“I guess you would consider Artie that," Steve explained. “We were close friends, maybe more than that. He was the first person I had sex with, at least. I was barely a teenager. But the times didn't allow for us to really be together. He died not that long before I was defrosted. Thankfully he found a life partner, though, which I'm happy about. He was a comic book artist named Grant Roth. He even kinda looks like me, so I guess Roth had a type.” Tony snickered at that. He also made a mental note to look up this Grant Roth.  “That wasn't something I thought either of us would find back then.”
Anthony: Hell no. Which makes me feel even worse about the way I reacted.
Please note, this is not everything that Steve sent Tony in the last chapter. Remember from the last conversation that there were lots of sketches of the Brooklyn Bridge, snow, and trains involved. Below are some of the highlights. There is significantly less nudity than last time but everything really mean something to Steve and tells a part of our story.
“Friday play my lab mix number two.”
Counselor Laura 2013: I don’t know if you need to go that far. Talk to her grandson. I think he would know better than I would. Although we haven’t been telling her anything about Leo. I’ve been afraid to.
TMNS: Okay.
"Then you wouldn't be able to afford multiple suites at a five-star hotel and all day spa service." Natasha remarked.
Steve and Tony work through some things. The penthouse has a rug that really ties the room together... Yeah let's be honest this chapter is just porn.
Tony can’t remember the last time he got eight hours of sleep.
Shit, they really need to head down to meet the rest of the team. Steve touches his ear.
After the team has been at the compound for two weeks, Steve and Tony decide it's time to tell everyone about their relationship. Steve wants to call a meeting.
Steve is actively sobbing in pleasure now. It’s so beautiful, Tony can’t contain his own moan as he pistons his tongue hard in and out of Steve. If they had more time he would love to go slow, tease him, savor the taste and feel of him. But that’s not what Steve needs now.
Tony and Steve reunited in Japan, where Tony is still recovering from a post-Pepper-break-up-binge/car accident. Tony has asked Steve to go to Hawaii with him for some R & R and hula girl fun (*cough*). Steve has a girlfriend he has not told Tony about.
I was re-watching Infinity War, and Rhodey is really welcoming to Steve and the rest when they show up at the compound. He has this sort of "long time no see" vibe, so I figure it's realistic enough that he'd be cool with Steve, especially if Tony has been waxing poetic about him for weeks haha.
. What if he's just been humoring Steve and his freakish cock... Hadn’t Tony just said Option 1 was a good one? He probably doesn't even want to do anything more and is just trying to go to sleep. He’s such an idiot.
He groans uncontrollably. It feels so good. Oh god.
“We’re
Tony gives him one more squeeze and goes to take his usual seat by Steve. Maybe it’s out of respect for Scotts awkward crush, but they don’t touch much, just sit together and watch the movie, arms brushing. When it’s over and Tony and Steve head off to bed, Steve gives his a friendly punch in the arm as he goes by.
They’ve sequestered themselves in the suite since the news broke, just laying around and blocking out everything else (the whole team seems to suddenly have a renewed interest in teasing them, though they’ve known about them since shortly after the reunification). When Tony tries to apologize all he can get out is “I know the timing sucks, but I thought you were dead, or dying, so… I regret nothing.”
Sam grumbles. “The kid with the webs?”
Tony groans and gets up to put on some pants.
“Steve! Et tu? I can’t believe I’m dating the uninitiated. Movie night is
But here they are.
He puts Tony’s bags in the biggest room on the second floor with the deck overlooking the beach and places his one duffle bag in a room down the hall (which also has a view of the beach, but no deck). After he’s put his clothes away he heads for Tony’s room and knocks on the door.
“Steve… I, I don’t know I just didn’t want to.”
Tony gasps as Steve scrapes the sensitive area lightly with a thumbnail, and he can feel himself getting hard. He wonders if Steve will acknowledge it.
Bruce occupies himself with gathering up soiled gauze and dressings, and sterilizing his equipment. Steve doesn’t say anything, but he doesn’t leave either. He focuses on cleaning, silently hoping that Steve will follow Tony’s lead and exit the lab. It’s not that he isn’t sympathetic to the Captain’s situation… which he really knows more about than he should thanks to Nat.
Tony can’t even respond, he’s half hard again and braces against the stirrups to thrust his ass at Steve is a silent plea.
“Yes boss, it’s really strong wind. The nano-tech appears to be especially sensitive to it.”
Mainly shower sex. Also Tony and Pepper have lunch.
“You’re being very compliant with the rules all of a sudden” he teases; still not sure if he’s actually glad.
Tony doesn’t really love the idea of rewarding Steve putting him off, but at this point he’s too excited to care what sort of message this sends. He’s just slipped the plug all the way in, and is breathing deep to adjust when a vid-screen call comes in from Pepper.
Tony is sure this whole thing has been an attempt to butter The Avengers up to do another calendar with the proceeds going to the Maria Stark Foundation (of which Pepper is the vice chair). The one they did six months ago flew off the shelves, namely because almost every Avenger that graced it’s pages was at
“So... that's the bed.” finishes Tony, clearing his throat a bit.
Scott chuckles and Steve gives Sam a raised eyebrow. Tony checks his watch; Vision and Nat stare blankly.
Steve can see Tony is actually considering it, so given that this all seems to be Tony getting Steve’s consent beyond a reasonable doubt, he decides to play a little dirty. He licks his lips and carefully slides his hands over Tony’s hips to hold himself steady as he leans forward, tilting his head back and to the side.
Tony looks at him fondly and Steve isn’t used to it. Having Tony’s full undivided attention, it’s like, stepping out into the sun after being stuck inside all day. It’s blinding.
Tony rewards him by pressing in further, stretching him,  opening him up more. “What does 'not much' mean?”
So, I think there's more to explore here (what does this mean for Tony's health moving forward? What does this mean for him and Steve? What will Bruce's tests show? Is Tony super strong now? Is this permanent?).
Wanda speaks first, “Natasha and I talk. I wondered why you were so different upon your return. Later I asked Viz about it too and he confirmed that Tony has always had, what do you call it, “The hots” for Steve?” She smiles and takes a drink of her sparkling water.
After a while he clears his throat. He’d like to stay here just like this, but his knees are already starting to complain (stupid fancy thin rug that isn’t even that soft). And although Steve has super-soldier knees, he’s been on them a lot longer and probably wouldn’t mind getting up.
He yells with the effort, trying again and again, but nothing happens. When he looks up at Thor he’s gone, replaced by Tony in the armor.
When they enter the kitchen Vision and Wanda are hovering over the stove and Nat and Sam are at the table in the open-concept dining area (looking very much like vultures, waiting for Viz and Wanda to finish with the kill).
As to the note at the beginning of this chapter: I don't think I'm actually done with this story. This will probably become a series where I do more in this universe since we time-jumped so much at the end. Especially the timeframe where the team is reunited before Thanos shows up... or the time of peace after.
Steve pulls off his second boot and sock, then his pants and his briefs in one swift movement, tossing it all to the side towards the elevator. Impatient.
a plan, but he knows he needs one. He needs to talk to Hope and Luis too.
He’s already almost outside, no one has had a chance to confirm that’s the plan, but it is now.
“I woke up from the ice and they didn’t remember or care to remember what people are capable of. I thought SHIELD did, I thought there was a way for us to move forward... But then it turned out SHIELD was a lie too... I've read about the last 70 years I missed in black and white, and it‘s there over and over again. When you give an inch, when you lay down at the beginning because it’s easier, we all lose. I couldn’t do it. It’s not some terrible alien threat I’m worried about. Its people. Regular people, governments, our own team members standing by and doing nothing.”
He swallows, hoping to jar Tony out of his rage with his own abasement. He’s not thinking anymore, just acting on instinct.
Tony’s exhaustion from their first round disappears as he moves down the table, eyeing the stirrups.
They can ride Steve’s motorcycle and go to the zoo, and if it isn’t exactly what he
It's Tony's turn to roll his eyes, “Steve, Stevie, my all-America cherub, if you’ve learned anything about me over the last couple of days, I hope it’s that I will never, ever turn down a shower with you. And secondly, you’re insane if you think you’re
“That’s hard to know, we don’t exactly keep track…” Steve says, remaining stoic.
Tony turns to him as he says “Water level 6” but falters as he sees Steve’s face. Yeah, Steve knows he looks like a deer in headlights, but… this isn’t exactly what he thought he was getting into with “let’s take a shower.” Steve has showered with plenty of guys. The war, training at Shield, exercising, the gym… it’s pretty common. But he guesses when Tony Stark invites you to shower and take care of your hard-on, a quick scrubbing and hand job was probably never on the menu…
Rhodey shrugs in response. “I think Pepper spent a lot of time trying to convince you to be something different than you are. And convincing herself that you were different than you are. It wasn’t always a bad thing, she wants you to be a responsible, careful, realistic person, like her. But what you
He’d better skedaddle, they’re probably having some sort of important Avengers team leadership meeting or something-
team matter. It’s well, personal.”
Tony stands up and begins to pace. Steve has noticed he tends to do that when he's thinking.
He’s blushing, again. He’s never blushed so much in his whole life, even when he had to deal with those USO girls on tour.
Steve opens his eyes, still looking a little dazed and moves to the center of the bench. Now that there’s room Tony lifts one leg up on one side of him, then swings the other up to straddle Steve’s lap. The bench is deep enough that Tony has room to slide down comfortably onto Steve’s lap and wrap his arms around his neck.
“Jesus Steve, do have any idea how hard I had to hold it together in there? Hearing about how good your cum is for me? How it’s making me better?”
“Steve, Steve, yes, please, take it out of me, I need you in its place. Please, it’s been so long, been fucking myself silly with dildos, need you.”
He tenses all over, which reminds him there’s a huge butt plug in his ass. He closes his eyes to focus, willing himself to say the right thing. He opens them and looks Pepper in the eye.
to see.”
Steve sighs and comes over to where Bruce is meaninglessly arranging plant protein slides, resting his elbows on the blank stainless steel counter about a foot away. Alright, it looks like this is happening… at least he will probably have the jump on Natasha in terms of intell on the situation (which rarely happens).
“We’re running a bit behind, we’ll meet you there.” he says into the comm before shutting it off. As a rule he doesn’t like to use the comms for non-Avengers related communications. But he also doesn’t like to spend the evening sitting awkwardly in a crowded dance venue hard as nails.
heard Pepper say the word fuck. He’s pretty sure she has said the word, like, maybe if she was alone and stubbed her toe? But around Tony, not even once.
Steve comes three times and they barely make it to the venue in time. Wanda glares at them as they settle into their seats as the Center’s lights dim.
They don’t see Scott for two days, and when he’s back everyone pretends nothing happened.
Steve who has moved to take Tony’s foot out of the stirrup, pauses. Tony’s foot is held suspended in the air as Steve just stares at him, eyes wide.
“I like the bed” says Steve.
Steve tries to tell him, “But you’re not… it doesn’t feel right that I’m getting off and you’re not. I get that maybe you don’t
Steve is still on his knees, leaning heavily against Tony’s hip, mind reeling.
<<Six unread messages>>
Drawstring undone, his thumbs slide down and out beneath the top edge of Tony’s pants, dipping them down just enough to expose a strip of tan skin and smattering of dark hair. He wants to give Tony control; he wants to tell him how good he wants to be for him.
“That’s good” says Tony soothingly as he slides the finger out and then in again, in and out. In and out.
Steve>> Tony has a plan, its good. Great even. I’ll have a full debrief for the team in a few days. I…
Steve goes to town. The table is endlessly useful, keeping Tony open and exposed and at the exact right level. Steve loses track of how long he thrusts his tongue into Tony, but finally Tony is fully hard again and is crying out with every stroke.
think?” he’s still laughing, and he realizes that Pepper is starting to look annoyed.
Thanos arrives, casually walking in through a cloudy grey portal.
He lets out a little gasp as Steve looms over him, running his hands slowly over his knees up to his thighs, still so gentle.
He can’t believe he asked to see the bed; no wonder Tony keeps pushing… he’s practically paving the way for him. And that’s the crux of it, isn’t it? He kind of wants Tony to push. Well, no he really wants him to. And he doesn’t. He still doesn’t know what he wants and they are going into Tony’s bedroom.
“What? You’re going away? For how long?” Tony feels slightly panicked and he doesn’t know why. Realistically he knows Steve won’t actually leave him. This is just part of what he’s devised for the scene… it’s kind of a brilliant move, since getting left waiting by doctors seems to be about half their job. But Tony is feeling more exposed than he thought he would, and he doesn't want Steve to go.
He should probably have a Vibranium-level Stark-card made for Steve so he can come back here whenever he wants.
Steve goes on, clear-eyed and sure. “I can’t regret taking a stand, Tony. It’s who I am. But I know what I did wrong, what I
“Tony, you and Dr. Strange go get Wanda and Scott. If we’re lucky Sam has already worked with Wong to get them to the sanctum. Dr. Strange, while you’re there explain the plan to them in full. Tony, blast the plan to the rest of the team on all channels, make sure everyone knows Vision needs to be kept in containment. Maybe T'Challa would be willing to protect him in Wakanda? War machine and anyone else we can spare should stay with him in case Thanos' army makes a separate play for the mind stone.”
So, Cap has a girlfriend. Who wears earrings. This is what Tony knows about her.
Jesus, he needs a drink.
Steve huffs, “Tony for Pete’s sake…”
The beams don’t hurt, much, but as time goes on their shots increase in intensity from a static shock to a mild taser. They also become more agile and faster.
Out steps what Tony can only mentally classify as an Asian-fusion dandy…
Nat nods.
Both Peter and Scott exclaim at the same moment “It’s just like the lightsaber training remotes in Star Wars!”
“Sure, whatever you say, Ne-
“How long?” her voice is steely.
Please let me know if there is anything off here, it's been quite a while since I've seen either Ant Man! I did some googling 🤔
“What’s that, gorgeous?” Tony practically slurs, a warm smile hung on his mouth.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony’s eye glaze over a little. “Option 3 – is that you show me what you just learned. You open up my ass the way I just did for you… though you’ll need to use three fingers at least, god you’re so big Steve… then you fuck me, taking whatever you want from me. Win-win, I’ll get your cum in me, one way or the other, in my ass or in my mouth…”
Natasha laughs.
Steve owns Tony.
Tony makes a strangled noise. “Fine! But you’ll regret it when we are starting round three and Vision pops his head through the wall to ask what’s for dinner!”
Tony’s look shifts from blank shock to something akin to being star-struck as Steve talks. And suddenly Steve panics because there is still so much to say, and Tony is edging toward him.
Steve kisses his lips, almost chastely. “I said, thank you for today. And all the days since the tower. I hope you know how amazing you’ve been. How happy you make me.” He moves to straddle Tony’s hips fully, sitting lightly on his upper thighs, careful not to put his full weight down.
He debates how crazy it would be for Steve to find him dressed to the nines in his best suit at midnight, by himself, in an empty tower.
“Shh, okay Steve, I’m going to make you come. You’ve done so well. You’re so perfect.” Tony kneels back down behind Steve’s prone form, sliding his fingers out of Steve’s ass but keeping two fingers and a thumb tight at the base of his erection. Steve is so thick his fingers don’t even meet his thumb around its circumference. Jesus, Tony want’s that inside him.
Sam chimes in, “Not even after you were back. I knew after you were gone 24 hours. You didn’t check in Steve! You
"Hi Mr. Stark, I’m Dr. Rogers, how are you today?” Steve asks, busing himself by looking down at the clipboard through his wire-frame glasses.
“Yeah, well I
Mortifying. Arousing. Torturous.
Steve’s face crumples, and he nods reluctantly. Bruce is right, he really should be thinking about Becky right now too…
It’s almost midnight by the time he makes it to the tower. He looks up to see the Avenger's  A is no longer positioned at the top… from what Clint told him he thought it might be gone, but he hoped it wouldn't be. It feels like the end, such a tangible symbol of the team they used to be, taken down like it was never there.
Tony almost squawks, but holds it in. Steve has lifted him fully off the bed, supporting him with his arms at Tony’s back and ass. They’re still connected, Steve flush against him. Tony looks at Steve’s face to see it unyielding in concentration. Tony goes to lean forward, to wrap his arms around Steve, and drop his legs down but Steve stops him.
God, this man. He doesn’t want to leave.
Tony looks away from the table for a moment to gather himself. Steve puts his hand on his shoulder and gently rubs soothing circles. A brilliant warmth spreads through him at the knowledge that he doesn’t need to worry if anyone thinks the gesture is too familiar.
