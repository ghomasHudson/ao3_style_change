The words sound harder for Dean to admit than he thought they would. “You would expect certain things of me…or things between us would change.  And now look at me!  I’m here whining because I don’t want you to do your fucking job.”
Castiel falls back on the bed and closes his eyes.  Frustration takes over.  It seems to be the predominant emotion in the bunker the past few months.
He can sense the angel’s shoulders begin to fall as he collapses on the corner of my bed. “You’ve never felt the brokenness that I am experiencing, Dean.”
An hour later, Sam and Dean are ladling soup into bowls and grabbing fistfuls of bread, all while trying to balance their beers too; they head to the living room to watch a game.  Cas sits with them, quiet, sipping one of Dean’s beers.  He didn’t want to eat tonight.  This football game isn’t as exciting as the baseball game they watched a couple months back, and so it’s not enough to keep Dean’s mind occupied from thoughts of Cas.
He pushes open the door, thankful for the heated interior of the store. As he’s knocking the snow off his boots, he hears someone greet him to his left, and waves his hand in reply. Already unsure of himself for being in here, he’s not about to go asking a bunch of questions to some clerk.
“I’m Special Agent Watts and this is my partner Special Agent Wood.” Dean stops the shock from showing on his face at Cas’s calm introduction by looking down at his badge as he pulls it out.
Cas squints his eyes so Dean forces himself to look down as his fumbles with his hands. “Okay?” He sounds skeptical but Dean ignores that and turns away.
Dean has only ever known life on the road.  Going to shoddy bars, and the occasional club when he was younger, sated his needs as well as he thought his needs could be sated.  Being young and curious was something he figured was normal, he’d known other kids to experiment when he got the chance to befriend some for long enough.  He just thought maybe he hadn’t gotten it out of his system yet.  Small town bars and college clubs weren’t exactly the best places to test the waters.
In reality, Dean knows that Cas being an angel isn’t a guarantee that he won’t die, but, dammit, if it isn’t the best insurance possible for Cas, he doesn’t know what else would be.
Dean lets out the breath he didn’t realize he was holding. “Yeah, Cas, we can talk about starting that.”
An hour later, they walk out of his house and Dean immediately calls Sam, “Well, it wasn’t him, Sam.  He’s dead.”
Dean wants to leave the room and throw up.  But he’s rooted to the spot and his throat feels swollen shut. He just nods again. His hands have dug themselves into his sweatshirt pockets— nails cutting into his palms.
It would be so much safer.  It would mean less hunts, the more hunters that know about them.  It wouldn’t be that hard to get the signal out, they already know so many people in the business.  With all of the lore and research and information so readily available in the bunker, it’s actually a crime that they aren’t sharing it with the rest of the hunting world.  It would be about damn time that there was an actual network started too; Cas would fucking love being in charge of the whole strategy of running the thing.
“I no longer wish to be connected to Heaven,” Cas interrupts, his voice strong and soft.  Dean knows there’s more to it, but the hard line of Cas’s mouth tells him that the angel won’t say anything more.
Constantly travelling with John Winchester wasn’t exactly the most apt situation either.  It seemed John didn’t care about Dean’s emotional needs.  Was Dean fed?  Was he healthy? Was he safe?  Could he hunt?  That’s what mattered to John, that’s as far as his paternal instincts went.
Dean’s emotions are plain on his face.  He wants to apologize to Cas, he wants to say that it’s okay, that he’s being stupid.  Cas knows this because he knows the hunter well enough by now.  But Dean just sighs as he continues to look at Cas.
After the third commercial break starts, Dean decides he should stand and clean the dishes, or at least take them to the kitchen.  Once Cas understands what the hunter is doing, he tries to help, but Dean shoos him away, stating, “It’s not a lot, Cas, I’ll get in done in no time. Don’t worry.”
He finally looked up at Dean.  Immediately pulling back and stepping away.  Dean slumped to the floor, eyes wide as he gawked at Castiel.  He wasn’t even angry.  He was terrified.  The fear Castiel saw behind his eyes, that made him let go, would be a sight he would never forget.  He never thought he’d be one to strike fear into Dean’s heart, not after everything they’d already been through.
It’s just short of pouring rain by the they make it back out, running to the Impala and haphazardly throwing bags into the trunk, hoping they’re wedged in securely enough between the duffle bags.
“He’s was...he was stabbed.” As sharp as Cas’s mind is, he can’t help but give into the fuzziness that is pressing in on his memory.  The nurse pushes Cas’s hands out of the way so that she can assess the damage. “He needs a blood transfusion,” he states obviously.
Cas thinks about how Sam did not have a recording pertaining to this situation.  He has no brotherly advice to turn to in this time of desperation.
Dean gets dressed in today’s clothes; he grabs Cas’s tie from under the pillow when Sam isn’t looking and rolls it up in his dirty shirt, shoving it to the bottom of the duffle bag.
does he want to, he wants every bit of it he can get his hands on.  He wants to wrap himself in it so completely that it all becomes the defining whole of him.
Something changed in him when he reconnected with his grace.  It didn’t have the same overwhelming desire to function for Heaven as it once did.  Granted, the desire had been waning for years, but he had never really been able to shake it completely.  His grace still wanted to follow Heaven’s order, even if his will could overcome it.  But when he got it back, only an echo of that desire remained, a memory.  His grace no longer felt pulled to function for the Greater Purpose.  His grace felt his own to control.  Castiel cannot explain it and he honestly does want an answer as to why.
But Sam already gave him the big grandiose speech about how Dean “will come around” and “once he realizes this is not a bad thing” then “everything will be alright” and “I know you can handle this, Cas” because “you’re Cas and you know Dean just as well as I do.”  It was not a comforting or reassuring speech at all.  Whenever he brings up Dean to Sam, Sam will indulge him for a short time before stating, “Dean’s a grown man, Cas, he’s going to be okay.  He’s got you there for him.”
At that final realization, everything comes to a head, and Dean feels it in his hands before anything else.  The way they cramp up and his wrists twist, then his toes curl, then his legs thrash, and suddenly everything is too hot to touch.  Cas is too hot to touch.  He cums, gasping as his hands burn into the angel’s hips and his lips burn across Cas’s mouth.
“Dean, I don’t understand why you would get my grace back then not take advantage of all the powers I once again possess.  You were always eager before to call upon me when convenient.” His eyes bore into the other’s, as if drilling for the answers.
Every time he tells Cas he cares or doesn’t know how to live without him, the words spark both fear and need inside of him.  Sometimes he feels every utterance of devotion to Cas only makes it more destructive if something were to happen to Cas.  Other times, Dean can actually see a life full of happiness with Cas every time he speaks his adoration.
An image of Cas and Dean laying on the couch actually watching a damn movie flashes across Castiel’s mind.
The door opens as Cas slides back in the room, clutching two bottles of bourbon in the less injured of his arms. Dean sits up, extending his hand, and Cas knows to give him a bottle. Dean closes his eyes as he takes more than a couple swigs from the bottle before his throat tightens too much to continue. Cas has almost finished his bottle in the same time.
“This way,” Cas directs, leading Dean along the back sidewalk.  He turns down another alley, walks through a store, and they exit near another stage, but this one is empty so there’s far less people around. They walk along the street for ten more minutes, a pregnant silence shared between the two.  Dean doesn’t mind it though, for some reason it’s almost comfortable.
He needs to leave now, the light from smiting would alert someone to his presence if all of the noise he was making did not.  With shaking hands, Cas tucks his blade back into his pocket, and finds himself back in the almost empty waiting room.
“I’m an angel,” Cas smiles gleefully.  Dean looks confused, so Cas continues, “I could have willed us and the bags into the car with nothing more than a thought,” he laughs, as if it’s one of the most hilarious things he’s said.  He turns his face to the sky, marveling at the beauty of nature in the raw.
Cas slowly lies down, Dean following him, throwing a leg over his waist to straddle the angel’s hips.  He feels the hardness of Cas’s erection below his but ignores it in favor of the lips pressing to his. Fingers dance along the hem of Dean’s shirt, finally pulling it up enough to slide around his back, nails tracing the dip of his spine, over and over.  He’s breathless, gasping into Cas’s mouth now.  Castiel sighs in return.
From then on, if Castiel is in the library or a storage room or wherever, Dean will walk up behind him.  He’ll kiss his shoulder or squeeze his neck briefly, and Castiel knows.  It isn’t an often occurrence but it certainly isn’t rare either, so Castiel goes with it.  Every time, he tells himself he’ll finally sum up the courage to mention Sam to Dean, some adrenaline high taking over.  But when the time comes, when Dean is spread on top of him on the floor or when they are tracing patterns on each other’s arms next to each other bed, Castiel can’t find his voice.
By the time Dean’s out of the shower and dressed, shoving clothes back into his duffel, Sam walks back in looking too chipper for nine in the morning. He places the coffees he picked up on the table and once he takes off his coat he pulls the pastries out of the pockets.
Dean’s internal clock wakes him up at eight, which is actually seven back at the Bunker. Cas isn’t in the room but he’s not worried about it.  Sammy, on the other hand, is staring at him when he sits up. “What?” he grumbles, rubbing his face. He immediately notices Cas’s tie still in his other hand, and shoves it under the pillow.
“Why won’t you teach me?” Castiel practically yelled into Dean’s chest, feeling like a child both because of the Winchesters’ treatment of him and his outbreak. “Why can’t I hunt with you again?  Why aren’t you hunting?  I’m ready, Dean, I’ve been ready!” Enochian pushed through his lips, a curse aimed at the heavens for not making this easier on him.
He rolls off Cas now, nervousness and uncertainty taking center stage as he thinks about what he’s said.
He definitely hears the bitchface this time. “Fucking make this right, Dean.” A beat of silence. “And sober the hell up.” The line clicks and Dean is left alone again.
The smoke wafting out from under the lid of the pan brings Dean back to reality. He turns the burgers over before replacing the top.
The waitress sets down their lunches with a smile and the normal, “Here you go, boys, anything else I can get y’all?”
Dean’s mouth falls open slightly, for some reason he is shocked by this news even though he knew Castiel didn’t have
Dean ends up choosing a dark stain for the wood and leaving the engraving untouched. He draws out the Enochian for Cas’s name, slow and precise so they don’t fuck it up, and then writes
Dean’s laying across the back seats of the Impala as Cas drives them back to the bunker.   Cas decides to listen to another one of Sam’s recordings, hoping maybe they hold the answer to the questions he doesn’t know how to ask.
“Stop acting like you know what’s best for me!  I’m allowed to act however I want— Team Free Will and all!” Irony drips from his voice, but he doesn’t care.
“I am not a car, Dean.” He thinks it was an attempt at a joke, but his body isn’t able to respond to humor while looking at the battered vessel of Castiel sagging in front of him. He lets Dean guide him to the kitchen to start patching him up.
While throwing his clothes in the washer, the tie at the bottom of his duffel stirs something in Dean’s chest that feels like what he felt the first time he and Lisa cooked dinner together.  Something light lifting him, chasing the chill that settled in him last night when Cas left. He rolls up the slip of cloth, tucking it in his back pocket, making a decision.
“I did not think Dean Winchester would be a lightweight,” Cas laughs, his voice full of carbonation.
Dean asks a couple more questions about the case, to make sure it’s finished, then tells Cas he’s going to catch a few more hours of sleep before they slip out, the exhaustion becoming too much.  Cas nods, telling Dean he’ll have everything ready to go when they need to leave.
Dean feels the need to be the one who cooks, especially since it was one of the only ways he could surely take care of Sam growing up.  It’s not that he doesn’t enjoy Cas’s basic recipes, but that his sense of responsibility far outways many of his wants in his life.  Cas has been trying to help Dean realize that he doesn’t need to do everything himself, and that handing off some of the responsibility is not showing weakness or carelessness.  He’s been hoping that letting Dean know he is willing to help gives Dean the opportunity to choose to let him.
or counting salt rounds.  And you suck at covering up the smell in the car.” Sam’s laughing again, loving the chance to finally have this go at Dean.
“You don’t owe them a damn thing, Cas!” Dean affirms for the fifth time in as many minutes. “Not a damn thing!
Dean dashes to the kitchen, praying to find some oil.  In his haste he forgets both the fact that he uses canola oil to cook all the time (
The latest victim was from New York City, was just here for a short time visiting, as she and her husband took care of his sick mother.  She had gone out to get groceries and had never come back.  Her husband assumed, at first, she had just gone to the store a couple towns over “to clear her head,” and didn’t think anything was wrong until she didn’t come home before nightfall.
And Dean explains to Cas, “I think, I think the alcohol prompted something in you, and so did finally using up the last of that borrowed grace… You were fine right after I left you, nursing your hangover by getting drunk.  I thought you were going to be fine; I was just going to leave you to get drunk, pass out, sleep it off.  Repeat it maybe.  But then—” Dean stops and looks out his window, forcing himself to remember the truth. “Then, after Sam and I came back from a trip upstairs...you had destroyed the Bunker. There were tables overturned and walls were smashed to pieces, one of the tunnels had caved in…”
The girl’s face brightens up and she leads him to a table in the back. It’s full of vintage and antique looking materials, some stuff locked in the glass casing above the table. She goes on to explain that this is the kind of equipment and tools used in the past for letter writing, documentations, and book making.  She shows him the tools and beeswax mixture that were used in the middle ages for sealing letters. He asks her to take a set up to the counter while he looks for one last thing.
When Dean went to check on him the next morning, Cas was facing the wall, yelling, pulling at his hair.  Dean tried to open the door to get in, but the moment he did, Cas whipped around and started hurling Enochian swears at the hunter, from what he could guess.  And so Dean didn’t try to open the door again. He hung around outside, passing food and alcohol through the hatch to his friend, every day feeling more desperately that he should be in the room saving Cas.  But he wasn’t, he was outside hunting for a grace that might not even still exist.  But he couldn’t think about that.  Instead he watched over Cas from a distance, a twisted thought of himself as a guardian angel ran through his mind.
. “We thought someone had broken in— stole stuff from The Men of Letters— but then Sam heard you in that room, Cas.” Dean finally looks at Cas.
The one from Sam first.  An iPod. “So you’re not subjected to Dean’s music any more than you have to be,” he jokes.
But Cas finally understood when he caught the expression on Dean’s face one day they were working a case in upstate New York.  Dean was fighting so hard with himself, he wanted so badly to let Cas touch him when they were in some bar, three drinks in their system, but the anxiety quelling inside Dean was palpable.  He wanted to, but society said he couldn’t, society was telling him he should ‘man up’ and ‘act like a man.’  And it hit Cas, in that moment he was able to relate absolutely to the fear of doing what was considered wrong, what was considered abominable, no matter how
Paige comes back and informs him Mr. Johnson can engrave the journal for him as well. She pulls out another form for him to fill out, scratching out the title and writing
“The people who lived on this floor must have been the ones who were turned to zombies, whereas the ones on the floors below us we either tests, sacrifices, or I guess some could be zombies too.”
Dean wraps an arm around Cas’s chest, holding him close. “Anything you want, angel.” He readjusts his hips, fucking up into Cas now.
“I need help,” Cas breathes, still searching for wounds to heal. “I need help,” he repeats, louder this time, less shaky, as the doors to the vestibule slide open.
The buzz of his cell yanks him from his momentary bliss.  Dean pulls Cas closer as he hugs his chest and places a chaste kiss on his neck.  He hopes his apology soaks into Cas and that he’ll understand.  He rolls over and grabs his phone.
“You should be able to pick them up in three to five day’s time— we’ll call you.” She’s unwrapping the journal from the bag.
.  He approaches the body, intent on ripping its limbs off, but changes tactic when he sees the rit zien’s own blade glinting just feet away.
Dean realizes he’s been holding his brush under the running water for entirely too long before he turns the tap off and answers, “Oh, yeah, what did Cas say?” The brush is in his mouth now, so at least he doesn’t have to speak.
“You good?” he murmurs, dripping some of the oil on his fingers and placing the bottle near Cas’s hip.  Cas makes an affirmative sound, pushing his ass back just a little bit. “Here, put the pillow under your hips,” Dean says, helping Cas do so. “And don’t fucking move.” Cas snorts.
They clean up and the three of them end up side by side on the couch. A couple days before they set up six foot Christmas tree they found discarded on someone’s driveway. Cas and Sam decorated it with strings of empty shell casings and salt rounds and hung some of the coasters Sam collects from bars.  Cas perched a glass star on top that he specifically went out and bought, it hangs crookedly now. They sit in front of the tree now, Dean laughing at the ramshackle decorations but liking it none the less.
Dean reaches both hands across wood surface, palms up in a now familiar gesture.  They don’t do this often; the last time Cas projected their thoughts was the night before they caught the rit zien, several months ago now.  The angel stares down at the once-white bandages covering Dean’s hands.  After a long moment, (where Dean is scared he isn’t going to) Cas grabs his wrists, Dean’s fingers curling in return.  They both take a deep breath.
This gift from Sam seems like something he would give to Cas if he knew how he felt.  But how can that be when Cas didn’t even come to this realization until after Sam had given him these recordings?
It makes him think of how raw Dean is, the tenderness of his soul completely overcome with his emotions.  He thinks he’s fooling himself when he drinks himself to unconsciousness or finds a lonely girl at a bar to fornicate.  Dean thinks he’s better than his emotions but Castiel knows him too well and he know his sentiments are what make him.  They give Castiel hope though, something he’s given up on yet still desperately clings to.
Once Cas sinks all the way down, he braces himself, hands framing Dean’s head. He rolls his hips again. Dean’s positive he feels his stomach drop out.  Hips roll again. Dean moans, pulling at Cas, lips searching.  Hips just keep grinding down, steadier than his own heartbeat.  He grabs Cas’s ass to help facilitate the thrusts.  Precum leaks onto Dean’s stomach as Cas’s cock rubs between their bellies.
“I do not know if I am what you are looking for.” Castiel turns slowly, gauging whether he is able to leave or not.
“Yeah, well, it’d be nice if you actually said it for once, Dean,” he says coolly.  The anger that’s been knocking around inside Cas is fighting it’s way out, slowly bleeding out of him, too tired to continue fighting.
The body crumples in a heap, and Cas flings it up into the air, relishing in the sound of the bones cracking as it hits the asphalt.
Dean’s frustration with these kids finally gets the better of him, and when they saunter off to buy another round of beers, Dean makes a decision. “Cas, buddy, let me show you how to hold the stick right.” He’d been gripping almost the end of the stick the entire game, and he hadn’t been leaning over nearly enough to properly align his sight with the shot.
“Because you always cheat, dude!  Next time we play with the same darts— so you can’t fucking unbalance mine.” They both laugh.
He folds the paper up, placing it on top of his jacket. “I know we do but it doesn’t hurt to know what the town is thinking when we go in.” Finally, he eats, spearing his salad with a fork.
It’s a strange feeling, this exhaustion, this strain on the human senses Castiel still hasn’t gotten used to.  He can feel his grace flaring deep within him, wanting to break free and do it’s duty, heal his vessel, stop the consumption of his energy and revitalize him.  But he forces it down, still marveling at all the physical sensations he misses when it’s at full force.
“Well, actually, no one is convinced of that, except me,” she assures hurriedly.  I have asked the others to vote whether or not they think you’re able to lead once they hear what you say.” She turns to face Castiel directly now, she touches his shoulder briefly. “Please, Castiel, say you will help us.  Say you direct us in ending Metatron once and for all.”
He wants so badly to hold them, push his fingers between the feathers, feel the hot-cold of the grace on his skin.  But he can’t, not right now, at least.
“The guy’s been living with us for how long?  Since April?  He should have more stuff. Even if it’s just junk. Like liquor bottles or leaves he’s collected from trees.  Objects from hunts or something.  I mean, Cas has interests, he should show them, shouldn’t he?”
“Cas and I went to his place, but when we got there the door was open. We walked inside and it looked like another fucking blood ritual.”
. He takes a deep breath and asks, “You don’t have anything with beeswax, do you?” He noticed the sets for wax seals at one table.
“No, Dean, no arguing.  You listened to me this time, the least I can do it travel with you how you want.” Cas’s eyes light up. “Though it is archaic.”
Cas doesn’t get up as quickly as Dean does, so he’s the one heading to the kitchen for their drinks.
Cas wants to reach out and comfort Dean but he feels rooted to the spot, Dean’s words rendering him motionless.
The dirty mirror distorts his reflection, which is actually for the better, he doesn’t want to see the craziness of his eyes right now, the flush on his cheeks.
Several thoughts run through Dean’s mind at once.  He’s surprisingly smug about how good he’s become at sucking cock—
After Dean finishes telling the story he tries and fails to get Cas to talk to him. Eventually he just gives up and turns the music back up, Def Leppard rolling out the windows. Yet he only seems to hear the shame and desperation radiating off of Cas.
The last year is plain evidence that Cas knows how to hunt as a regular hunter, but that sure as hell doesn’t mean Dean will accept it as an answer to Cas wanting humanity over angelic abilities.
“Cas, we need to get you mended up,” Dean tells him, pushing the sheets off and throwing on his clothes from yesterday. “C’mon, I’ve got a kit somewhere, I can put you back together in a second.”
Why when he so eagerly wanted to start hunting as soon as he got his grace back but the brothers said no.  They all stayed in the Bunker for days, idly sitting, waiting.  The two would jump behind corners when Castiel noticed them watching him.  They would unnecessarily follow him from room to room, playing it off like they too had to do whatever he was doing: research, eat, relax on the couch, go sit in that windowed room.  Castiel should have known something has wrong from the get go, but he brushed it off.
“Yeah?” Dean wills himself to look at his face.  He’s not even sweating.  Dean’s drenched, not sure if it was the dancing or his own nerves that did it, probably both.
He looks down at his hands still flat on the counter, a slight sting still resonating from the earlier slap.  Ash embedded under his nails from the fire they set for their last case; the creases of his knuckles permanently stained with motor grease; rough callouses catching on the surface; and he knows they’d be riddled with scars if not for Cas.  Cas’s hands don’t look anything like Dean’s, they should never have to.  Being human is nothing but dirty and dangerous.
For months Castiel stays locked in this room, Dean ordering him to stay put so he doesn’t cause any more turmoil.  Sam and Dean have been searching for the answer to his missing grace ever since Dean got up and left, months of research, interrogations, and messy visits to Heaven.  Sometimes Dean comes by and Castiel can hear him sitting on the other side of the door after he’s passed him food and alcohol.  He sits and drinks with his friend but he rarely says anything.  It has been Sam who informs Castiel of any headway they make in the hunt for the missing grace.  He came by about a week ago to tell Castiel they were close to something, after talking to the elder angels (the archangels weren’t lying after all); they just needed to go back once Metatron gave into his interrogations, he couldn’t hold out forever.
Dean didn’t know he was still able to feel fear like this, after everything he’s been through. Some sick part of him actually enjoys it, reminds him he is still human, after all.
Castiel’s heart starts racing, and he’s suddenly scared. “Where is it?” he finally chokes out, feeling the tug of his grace,
Cas found several cases, so that leads to the Winchesters splitting after they go back to the bunker to regroup.  Sam heads towards Nashville for a case that sounds like an angry spirit and Dean drives down to New Mexico to see about a demon, with Cas saying he’ll stay at the bunker to hold down the fort.  This new dynamic that Cas has created through all his extensive research throws Dean through a loop.  Sure, the demon was easy enough to track, capture, and question— it was reckless enough in its cause— before exorcising it.  But coming back to the empty motel room for the second night in a row feels wrong, knowing him and Sam are on good terms yet not together resonates weird in his gut. Cas made an excellent argument that even Sam couldn’t object to at least trying.  The angel would stay at the bunker, as their source of research and to answer the phones, while the brothers took on separate but not too difficult of cases, where they would be only a call or a
“Yeah.” Dean’s heart finally hits a steady rhythm. “Let me know if you need any help, Cas and I are almost done here.  We could be there by tomorrow evening if you need us.”
Now Dean sits in a back table explaining the finer points of hustling pool to Cas, who seems to understand.
“Fine, man, you’re equal.  Cas, you’re equal, okay?” Dean reassures him cautiously.  He has to talk to Cas later.  He needs Cas to understand why they’re so careful with him.
Hannah pauses a moment before saying, “We want you to lead the attack.”  She pauses again to let what she said sink in. “Some of us here have already led attempted attacks, but those all failed.  We need someone more skilled and experienced to lead the next attack if we wish it to be as swift and resolute as we need it, to stop Metatron once and for all.”
What happens in the hours leading up to Cas's induction back into humanity?  [When did he even first make that decision?]
Another pull on his hips and Dean climbs on top of him, their skin finally touching. More of that light Cas is emitting leaks into Dean through their chests.  It takes every bit of strength Dean has not to give over completely and fall to pieces on top of Cas.  He instead tries to focus on the constant undulation of Cas’s hips in response to his, the delicious pressure and friction.
Instead, he ends up staring at the television thinking about Cas.  About the way he rubs their jaws together, their stubble catching; or how he’s run his fingers through his hair more often lately; and the time he spends kissing down his chest and torso, his lower stomach peppered with bruises the shape of Cas’s mouth.
The two walk out of the coffee shop, two coffees and half a dozen donuts to split between them.  The hunter is thankful that Cas remains quiet the rest of the ride, slowly chewing his donuts, taking time to wipe his fingers clean before grabbing the next.
. He stands up straighter, waiting until the last moment to pull his hand away from Cas, his fingers dragging.
“I mean, obviously I had no solid evidence, and it’s not like I could ask you. You’d flat out deny it, don’t even lie. And I shouldn’t have to ask Cas.”
They’re only interrupted once, for a nurse to check his charts and stats, to see that everything is progressing as it should be.
He untangles himself as fast as possible from the being he is holding. “Alright, Cas.” He tries very hard to ignore both his ragged breathing and the tilt Cas’s head is taking on. “It’s— we should really hit the hay— we need to go talk to that mom again, in the…” Dean trails off as Cas steps closer to him, mouth parted in an obscene shape.
“He lost a lot of blood, but we were able to get him the transfusion he needed,” she informs, then goes silent for a minute. “I’ve been working here twenty-three years and I thought I’d seen it all...but…  By some miracle, we were unable to find the source of the bleeding, as if his body healed itself from the damage.  All we needed to do before the transfusion was sew him up.  A miracle…,” she whispers to herself more than to Cas.
Cas collapses in the chair, no longer able to hold himself up, hold himself together. “Dean,” he half sobs, hands still shaking.
Somewhere in between Dean explaining their race around the lazy river and teaching Sam how to properly dive that day, speaking gets easier. His chest doesn’t feel locked. Cas’s presence next to him, his warmth, makes his stomach knot, but not uncomfortably.  While watching the sink drain the last of the suds, there are navy eyes watching Dean, he can feel them.  He barely looks up before feels the hand in the middle of his back, turning him.  His eyes fall closed, either from the heavy buzz of the alcohol or feeling the heat radiating from the hand. Dean votes the former.
He shakes his head, trying to clear it, but it only disorients him more. His hips stutter to a stop moments later.  He groans one final time. Grabbing Cas’s cheeks, he forces his tongue in his mouth, slow and filthy, trying to convey god knows what emotions he’s feeling right now.
Cas reaches into Dean’s pocket, pulling out the key and his tie, forgotten in the midst of dancing.  Cas drapes it over his shoulders as he unlocks the door.  Sam is sleeping in the closer bed, and Dean curses him for taking that one because now it means he has to stumble even further.  Cas helps drunk-Dean make his way to the bed without running into something or knocking anything over.  He pulls the sheets back then tries to help ease him down but he shifts his weight and falls like a mess into the bed.  He rolls over onto his stomach, not even bothering to kick his boots off. He brings his hands up to grab the pillow and realizes Cas’s tie is gripped in his hand.  He forgets about the pillow and quickly falls asleep.
“Cas,” he whispers, and the angel feels the excitement radiating from his body though he gives nothing away physically. “We got it back.”
A feeling in his gut kind of likes the idea of committing himself though.  Too bad he feels like puking at the thought.
It hits Dean all at once, like a fucking brick wall.  Everything he’s been not thinking about and refusing to let himself feel for the past months (let's be honest, years) comes bursting to the surface.
Dean pulls the trunk shut and runs the cart to the caroul a few spots down; Cas is still standing by the back bumper when he returns.
“Hey, man.” Cas stares too intently as Dean approaches the group of college kids. “I heard you and your buddy were scrounging for a game,” he slurs, his voice too loud. “My friend and I—” Dean tilts his head in the angel’s direction, “we just, just got paid and we’re looking to kick some ass.” He smiles crookedly, and Cas wishes they were closer, touching…
He sets his jaw, walking towards them. “I am not as helpless as you two keep thinking.” His hands rise, to grab their shoulders, to ‘zap’ them back to the Bunker.
Strong arms pull Dean down until his whole body’s pressed to Cas’s, legs tangled. Dean closes his eyes and just breathes in Cas’s scent,
He can barely hear the breathy grunts as Dean struggles to keep his body working as it continues to lose blood.  Cas can’t panic, he can’t lose focus.
Dean finds the strength to stand, his legs shaking.  He doesn’t bother finishing his shower before turning it off.  He wraps himself in his robe, wraps his knuckles in a towel, grabs a bottle of whiskey from the fridge, and falls onto the couch.
Dean coughs again. “You weren’t thinking about sausage biscuits.” He gestures to the list then flips his turn signal on.
Cas smiles when Dean’s mouth falls open against his t-shirt, his snoring quieter now.  He places his headphones back in and starts the second recording.
Then he notices the centerpiece of the bloody Pollock scene, an alligator carcass spread on a table.
Cas is looking down at the book, shame radiating from his body, his shoulders carrying the brunt of that pain. “No, I don’t remember.”
Cas muffles his laugh in Dean’s shoulder. “I think I clearly want to watch a movie,” he laughs again, pressing his hips to Dean’s.
Cas laughs in return, thanking him, turning the box over in his hands. Sam moves to the chair, reading the manuscript again, trying to give them as much privacy as he can while still staying in the room.
“Alright, boys, we’re going to Louisiana,” Dean announces, walking into the kitchen as Sam eats lunch and Cas stirs his coffee. “Been some hushed news about zombies. Local reports keep playing it off as overzealous Evil Dead fans but my gut tells me otherwise.”
It’s been pretty quiet between them, even considering how much of that time Dean has spent in and out of consciousness.  Every time Cas went to open his mouth in the motel room, an apology was ready to spring forth; Dean didn’t want to hear it, so he would press his mouth the Cas’s.  Neither one of them really knew what was the right thing to say in this situation.
them there. After running around the town all day collecting retellings of the story, it sounds like they have a rougarou on their hands.  While Sam’s calling about some more information from the coroner’s office, Dean flicks through the channels on the surprisingly flat screen television in their motel room. He doesn’t find anything as interesting as watching Cas edit
The same woman who threw her files comes up next to Cas, looking him in the eye. “Can you tell us what happened, sir?”
Dean is truly shocked at himself for being able to say something so vulnerably honest to Cas.  But after only being able to think about Cas’s safety since the beginning of this situation, it really shouldn’t be a surprise.
Dean still won’t look back at him. “You already left me how many times?  What’s one more time?” Dean knows he’s entirely unfair in saying so, maybe even outright wrong, but he’s too scared to care right now.  He’ll apologize later when Cas decides to keep his grace.
Suddenly his heartbeat distracts him.  It’s still pounding too fast.  His heart rarely deviates from the standard seventy beats per minute.  It’s going at least one hundred beats per minute now, and though he knows that’s still average, it’s fascinating to see how his vessel’s body changes when his grace isn’t a barrier between it and its humanity.
She goes on to ask a flurry of questions about Dean’s health and habits, making sure nothing interferes at they try to save him.  Alison, she tells him, guides him to the waiting room.  She pushes a clipboard into his hands and tells him to start filling out what information he can while they wait for an update.  Then she leaves him, promising to come check in later when she has new information.
“Anything, angel, anything…” He grabs Cas’s wrist, placing his hand back on the headboard. Pulling out his cock of Cas was the very bottom thing on the list of what Dean wanted to do, but watching as it slides out of Cas…
“I do sleep now Dean, I’ve been sleeping for months.” It sounds so pathetic once admitted. “I had to walk into the Bunker last night, I only was able to get as far as outside of Lebanon before it was snuffed completely.”  His soul yearns for the power of another grace; he can feel himself becoming addicted, like those humans and their narcotics.
Dean grunts in response, seemingly annoyed at being coddled, but drains the entire cup of water before he even opens the pill bottle. “I don’t know what the fuck this is, man.  I do not get sick like this.”
“Cas...you wanna come sit with me while I eat?” Dean asks from the other side of the door. “Or, you could eat too.  If you want.” He hesitates. “I made enough.”
Cas sits with his lo mein in hand as he types another keyword into the police database, looking for any other crimes that might relate to the current case even if it’s not a missing person’s.
Dean chuckles, thinking about how weird it was to see Cas dancing in the beginning last night, his uncoordinated feet and untimed hips. “Yeah, dude is weird.”
Dean’s one hand is still on Cas’s belly, fingers scratching at the hair trailing downwards, and his other hand grips Cas’s shoulder for leverage. He opens his eyes and looks down, their bodies moving towards each other bit by unbearable bit,
That was when Castiel was a soldier though, when he was a good son.  He has since changed.  Both Winchesters played such a huge role in shaping not only humanity but the angel.  Sam taught him to never give up.  Dean taught him it was okay to not be a the son his father expected him to be.  Castiel knows he is no longer an Angel of the Lord, and that he is now a rebel.  And he’d choose being a rebel any day.
The discomfort he felt earlier that day at the thought of finishing Sam’s recordings presses against his ribs.  The realization of desiring humanity to the point of permanently discarding his grace also weighs on him.  Dean’s own mortality and the risks of their jobs is overwhelming, catches his breath sometimes.  Everything feels solid, an actual physical weight that’s holding him down.
Even working cases has become something akin to foreign when they leave the Bunker.  Castiel learned not to bring cases to Dean after he turned down his first suggestion of checking out a ghost in Iowa.  Dean shrugged and said, “Someone else will deal with that.”  Dean’s motivation for cases began to stem from his own determination to distract himself; he had to read through headlines every day, he had to find the case, he had to research it before leaving, he had to drive them there, he had to ask all the questions, and he find out all the answers.  He either through himself into the case or into Castiel.
that his hand stalls.  Cas’s rough moans remind him to keep jacking him; he slowly pulls up Cas’s cock, knowing he’s going to be rewarded with more precum flowing over his fingers as he
“Dean, please, your face— your face—” He can’t continue, not with the way Dean’s pulling on his cock.
“Cas and I—” Dean literally has no clue how to say what he needs to say. Sam is willing to talk right now, and so is some part of Dean, so he should just get it over with. If he waits any longer, it’ll only going to get worse.
“He said it wasn’t the music making you drink.” He accidentally swallows some toothpaste and tries to hide his coughing. “Something about the scene of the crimes being too much for you.  Are you getting a weak stomach, Dean?” Sam teases, joining his brother in the bathroom.
They all walk to the mouth of the alleyway to take our separate ways but are blocked by a screaming crowd.  Dean almost panics, automatically thinking danger.  Then notices the dancing and the laughing and the huge stage a block away. A festival.
Cas yelps when Dean pinches his nipple and rolls back on top of him, pinning him in place. “Take that back!  Take that back, you bastard!” Dean pinches Cas’s nipple, eliciting another surprised sound. “Take it back!” he laughs, out of breath.
Dean softens slightly but not enough to not be angry with Cas. “Cas, dude, we’ve been looking for that for a long time, isn’t it time to give up?” It’s heartless, he knows, but he’s so exhausted with hunting that it doesn’t even matter that Cas’s grace isn’t a monster to be hunted.
He looks at Dean, with his squinting eyes, and answers, “This is what you do to numb yourself, if I am not mistaken.”
The kid gets the initial strike but he doesn’t sink any balls.  Cas takes a long time to study the table before settling on an aim for three in the corner.  He hesitates a second, leaning down slightly more before his quick hit to the cue ball. It sinks but so does the cue ball. The college kids laugh, but Dean pats Cas on the back when he comes to stand by him.  The kid then lines the cue ball up, aims for the nine, and it teeters before dropping into the side pocket.  He sinks the fourteen as well before missing when he tries to put the twelve in the corner pocket.  Cas takes aim at two and it sinks.  Cas aims at seven and it sinks.  Cas aims at four and it sinks.  Cas aims at one, five, six and they sink.  He indicates to the corner pocket for the eight ball.  Dean holds his breath.  The eights rolls gracefully into the corner pocket and Dean grabs Cas to pull him into a hug.
.  And yet, it shocked him to see Cas’s broad shoulders, hard chest, and the subtlety of his muscular build under that almost-tan skin.  Dean had thought about this plenty, thought about seeing Cas’s body (no matter how vehemently he would deny it if ever asked), but now that it’s right in front of him— Dean actually needs a moment to compose himself.
Sam found Cas in the windowed room but still didn’t want to startle him. Dean came up behind his brother, alert with a gun still in his hands.  He saw Cas and immediately lowered it, not paying attention, and it banged against the wall.  Cas instantly turned on the brothers, from whatever useless spell he was currently working on. He launched at them, screaming in Enochian, his angel blade at the ready.  Sam shoved Dean out of the way and slammed the door on Cas. Dean pleaded that they had to help Cas; Sam was trying to be practical.  He was armed and not himself, there’s no telling what Cas would do to them if he thought they were interfering with his spells.  So they waited it out; Dean paced back and forth in front of the door and Sam tried to clean up the mess in the corridors. Hours later, Dean looked in when he heard a strangled gasp and saw just in time that Cas was crumbling to the ground. Dean wrenched open the door, flinging himself down next to Cas, prepared to perform CPR or mouth to mouth or whatever in order to save the angel.  Sam checked, his pulse was still even, probably more even than when he was awake. He just passed out.
He looks up, Cas’s eyes are so dark Dean sees himself reflected back; irresponsibly, he wants to get closer.
Dean finally finds his voice. “No, Sam, it’s in the damn bathroom, where it always is.” He inches out of the kitchen slowly, not sure if Sam saw he was buck naked or not.
(He might have said in passing one night that he wanted to see Cas’s wings, not the shadows, but his wings.  Cas kissed him, replying it would be too much for Dean to handle.  All of that raw energy exposed at once would be too much grace for a human to witness.  Dean sighed, mumbling that he would be able to handle it if it meant seeing them. Cas distracted him from asking more about them by biting his neck.)
The first victim was a teacher with an apple pie life.  She loved her job and her family, the only bump in her life had been when she was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, but everyone assured Dean that she even took that in stride.  She prayed every day and apparently she was “finding solace from her disease in her relationship with the Lord.”
“You know what I mean. This reaper is just going to move on to some other town and some other crossroads demon if we don’t stop it. So hurry up, we gotta go before it realizes its friend is missing.”
He reassures, “I’m not going to leave, Dean, not again.” Cas seems to sense the desperation and fear Dean’s been trying to hold at bay.  Cas softens a little bit.
The door was still cracked open, so Cas doesn’t hear Dean enter as he pushes it the rest of the way.
He collapses on the bed; it smells like Cas, like damp air and the night sky.  But it only makes him think of loneliness, without Cas there to stave off his oncoming depression.  He curls up on his side, grasping at the comforter as it it will hold him together.  He can’t fucking fall apart because of this.
“We’re in New Orleans and you get drunk at a jazz festival, how predictable,” he scoffs, buttoning his shirt.
His phone chimes with another weather report from the town they’re headed for and he thumbs it off. “I could go on the supply run while you get stuff packed here,” he suggests, turning to face Dean as he reads the report.
“We didn’t say you were, Cas.” Sam is exasperated, already tired of this conversation because he’s had it with his brother so many times. “We just need you to understand, in this line of work, this life, it works out much better if you are on a team.”
This denial only works for as long as Dean keeps his eyes shut.  If he opens them, then everything will be real, and he’ll have to think about it.  Right now, since his eyes are closed, he can ignore the feeling bubbling in his gut telling him this is wrong.  He can enjoy the feeling of Cas’s body against his, the way his arms are circling him, his hands fisting in his shirt, the electric smell of Cas’s skin that overwhelms him because he’s so close.
But Castiel wanted so badly for everything to go back to normal that he swept all the worried glances and quieted conversations when he walked in the room under the rug.  He convinced himself the sooner he got back to hunting full time, the sooner everything would be okay again.
It’s the first time they’ve done anything remotely romantic in Sam’s presence, thankfully Dean doesn’t puke.
capable of battling monsters and defending myself.  I didn’t need you to baby me, Dean.  And I certainly don’t need you telling me what to do right now.” He kicks a chair just as Dean had.
Three beers later for Dean, two for Sam, and none for Cas, all three men are yelling at the screen as the ref doesn’t call another foul seconds before the opposing team makes a home run.
Not sure how much time has passed, Dean sits back up when he starts to fall asleep.  Not in here, not tonight.  He’s not that pathetic.
Tearing away at the newspaper reveals a small wooden box, he slowly opens it. “Dammit, Sam,” Dean whispers, wiping his eyes as he picks up the amulet from inside.
He doesn’t reply because no matter if he says he has or he hasn’t it won’t be the answer Cas wants. He needs his grace, not Dean’s sympathy.
“C’mon, Cas, we don’t have to talk about this now.” Dean’s not sure he did the right thing telling Cas now.
, Cas realizes. “No, Dean, I was not referencing your penis,” he deadpans. “I was talking about your height in general, you should know just because you’re short— ”
.  He’ll convince Cas to keep his grace, he will.  It only makes sense for Cas to stay an angel.  He can’t have a rational desire to be human.  No one would willingly choose the life that Dean lives.
, a high noise in the back of his throat. Dean wants to laugh but too much lust runs through him for it to be funny, instead his cock jumping at the sound. “I’ll be right back, Cas.”
Where he would normally pull Dean back against his chest, tonight he curls himself into Dean’s arms, burying his nose in Dean’s collarbone.
He is certain he can hear his brother’s bitchface even through the phone. “Don’t avoid my question, Dean—
Dean doesn’t know how to tell Cas he’s too good for anything Earth has to offer.  Cas comes from a place so undiluted, the world down here will only tarnish him.  He is so pure, still able to see the positive in every situation, still hopeful when there is no light on the horizon.  The entirety of Heaven, Earth, Hell, and everything in between have been on the verge of collapsing ever since Dean broke that first seal.  But Cas has never given up, even if he said he has, because Cas doesn’t know how to not hope.
“Good to see you know how to attend a baseball cookout, but you don’t need to use the same toppings as Dean.” Dean’s jaw clenches. “Look, see, try the jalapenos, okay, I swear you’ll like them.” Sam’s eyes glint with mischief.
Cas looks up, almost-surprise coloring his face.  He coughs into his shoulder. “I know I do, Dean.”  He takes a deep breath then, lets it out slowly. “There is still more we need to discuss about the entirety of my becoming mortal, not just the change in our job titles.” Cas turns Dean’s hands over, rubbing his thumbs over the back of them.
It’s quiet for a long time after that; both men thinking, churning over thoughts in their own minds.  Eventually, Dean starts to get twitchy, unsure now.  He begins to rethink everything he’s said, wonder if this was even the right approach to this conversation.  He has to keep Cas safe, that has to be justification enough, right?  Cas can take care of himself, he knows that, but anything could happen and he can’t chance that.  He just can’t.
His nails bite into his own palm as the note crumples in his hand, bringing him back to the present.
Cas finds the book he was looking for and the two head out to the tunnel where the Impala’s parked.  Dean sees the title as he slides into his seat,
, but in a good way and he tries not to think about it. "I have been trying to understand since before Purgatory.  Since...I rescued you from heaven, from Zachariah."
“They promised this was the last they would ask of me if I won this battle with them,” he confesses, trying to reason with Dean.
“I don’t know what to say…” Dean’s stomach drops, he doesn’t feel like he’s going to puke now.  He just feels empty. “Other than— I already fucking knew, jerk.” Sam lets out a laugh that sounds like he’s been holding in entirely too long.
Sam shakes his shoulders, loosening up some; Dean still feels a charge running through him. “And?” he asks.
“You don’t understand.” Cas harshly punctures the darkness with his words. “You’ve never had the power of the universe coursing through you all to be taken away in an instant.” He’s angry but Dean’s pushing out the sympathy in him; he’s pushing it out so he doesn’t have to deal with the thought of wanting to get up and hug Cas. “You will resurrect Sam however many times you need to but the moment I want help finding my grace you lose motivation.”
“He said he knows you don’t like ‘zapping.’  Besides, you can help me leaf through these files.  There’s at least eighty I haven’t gone through yet.” The piles Sam’s already separated look to have twice as many envelopes as the ones he hasn’t.
“Then when you had to deal with coming out of Purgatory without him, how you thought you’d left him.  Dean, you thought you’d let him down entirely, and again, something inside you changed. You haven’t drunk like that since, not to the extent you were when you thought, once again, you’d lost Cas.
The water flowing from the tap helps Dean focus, the steady rhythm and splashing remind him of a hunt his dad had from a long time ago.  John had a case near Cincinnati one summer, so he let Dean take Sammy to the waterpark there.  They got there a couple hours before the park even opened, that excited. So they sat outside on the curb, in nothing but their swim trunks, planning their route of attack for the slides with an discarded map they found on a bench.  Once the park finally opened, dozens of families lined up behind them, they rushed to the top of the tallest slide, almost forgetting to leave their towels on some chairs near the lazy river.  Neither one of them had been to a water park before, but they’d been to a couple Six Flags, and thought it wouldn’t be much different from the roller coasters.  They hadn’t been warned of the water slide wedgie tendency; they quickly learned.
Dean grabs Cas’s wrists tighter, willing himself not to pull away.  He can’t, not right now, he needs to say everything first.
There’s a murmur throughout the group as Hannah narrows her eyes at him. “Metatron has escaped and we have been trying to recapture him for years.” This shocks Castiel, but not enough for a response; he figured something only this diabolical would have the angels calling out to him. “Have you not been listening to the cries of our brethren?  At all?” she asks, offended. “Have you ignored the onslaught of pleas we’ve been calling to you as we fight this battle— some of us not making it through?”
One time in particular, while Sam was out picking up dinner, and he was finishing up his fighting training with Dean, Castiel had had enough.  Dean had been going easy on him the entire time, worry behind his eyes ever since Castiel had mentioned something about a sigil he noticed carved into the hallway.  As they were finishing up— on Dean’s command because Castiel didn’t feel done yet— Castiel pushed Dean against the edge of one of the workout machines.  Dean’s back pressed against the steel frame while Castiel pushed against his chest.
Dean’s expression changes, analyzing now. “Hey, Cas...” He tries to sit up but Cas pushes a hand to his shoulder to keep him down. “I’m going to be fine, I always am,” he reassures, head back on the pillow.
Dean pushes himself up, the effort to do so draining his energy.  He holds his head between his hands and he tries to wake up more.
Dean knew, he obviously knew, but still it startled him to see Cas’s half-naked body. He wasn’t expecting the usual, the small shoulders, round breasts, narrow waist.
Cas searches for the medication he bought for Dean, placing it on the nightstand next to the cough drops and glass of water he put there not long after Dean fell asleep.  He thinks about withholding the takeout until Dean swallows another dose of pills and about a liter of water.
Just as Cas leans forward to start filling out the paperwork, Dean’s eyes open.  Cas jumps, pushing himself out of the chair and coming to stand by Dean.
All he’s been able to think about these past days, with Cas gone, is how to make their life safer for Cas.  What the fuck could he possible do to make hunting
Something is stopping Dean from looking Cas in the eye. “When?” he croaks, his voice softer than he thought it would be.
Cas is still standing next to the bed, staring at Dean, calculating their morning out.  Dean scoots over, his knee knocking against Cas’s leg as he swings his feet over the side.  He rubs his neck a few more times before standing up, his hand brushing Cas’s as he passes.
Then he pounds his fists against the brick wall, the masonry shuddering under the force of it, his blood staining the wall.  His anger is too great for the limitations of the vessel; he can’t shake the ground with his fury, he can’t set fire fire to the earth in his despair.  He has to settle for the force his vessel can handle.
“Yeah, it must be the voodoo that’s making the zombies then.” He’s switched into his work mode, and it’s the only way he’s able to stay focused, by completely blocking out everything that isn’t information to progress this case, and that includes the way Cas tilts his head.
“What?” Cas bites, frustrated and confused. His eyes lose the softness that flashed briefly when he said Dean’s name.
There lifestyle, the knowledge they are privy to, it’s fucking annoying.  Because Dean doesn’t know every which way their lives could change, it’s an every changing number with them.  They could be gone tomorrow, it could take decades before they’re finally forever six feet under— hell, they could be sitting on a fucking decaying radioactive substance right now and slowly killing themselves just by living here.  He doesn’t know.  And it scares the shit out of him to know end.  That’s been the hardest part of this whole job since he could remember.
Fun fact: my friend Erin (my beta) and I bought tickets to go to PittCon this summer!! I might be mildly (read: utterly) freaking out over the idea that I get to meet the actors!
“I’ll go look into the neighbor, you two can go check on the property owner,” Sam suggests, gathering the files and organizing them into his bag. “I’ll go drop these back off at the police station before though.”
Castiel pushes the laptop onto the tiny side table and lays back down, putting as much space between him and Dean as he can.  The other man’s chest rises and falls slowly, becoming a point of focus for Castiel as he remembers,
“What?” Dean sounds scandalized. “Let me see.” Cas rolls off, but keeps his arm draped over Dean’s stomach.
Dean barely accepts the pills before he’s turning away and having a coughing fit into his fists.  His chest is still heaving as he turns around to chase the pills with the juice Cas brought.
And so Castiel raised his hands in front of him, a silent surrender, as he backed out of the room.  He didn’t eat dinner that night.
“Alright, I’ll go to the police station, once I drop our bags off at the motel,” Sam interrupts his brother before he has a chance to start, “you two can head to the crime scenes.  There’s a couple, so try and get to them all today.”
Cas only gets as far as that recording before Dean blearily opens his eyes and presses his face into his chest.  Dean quickly turns over and starts coughing into his elbow, kicking the sheets away.
The angel’s eyes break from Dean’s as he glances down at the table. “To be completely honest, I’ve been thinking about it for a while now…”
He groans quietly, hoping Cas takes that as an answer.  He’s staring at the hunter intently as Dean finally looks up from the spine of the book he’s trying to translate. “I told you, I don’t like when I get ‘zapped,’ it just isn’t my favorite way to travel, feels too much like flying.
“Oh, no, buddy, I told you last time I didn’t like that.” His face contorts with queasiness as he thinks back.
Stepping back into the shower, now naked and reaching for the shampoo, Cas comments, “We’ll pick up more medication and cough drops at Walmart.”
With that said, Dean strains to turn them over.  Cas on his back now, arches into Dean’s hand as he again grips his cock. The hunter’s other arm wraps under the angel, still stretching to claw at his back.  He has an idea why Cas enjoys it but he’ll ask about that later. Now, in this exact moment, Dean turns his rapt attention to Castiel’s cock, a mere foot from his face. He wraps just his index and thumb around the base and starts a slow pull to the top.  The reaction is immediate, Cas’s legs shake and his hips come off the bed.
“We’ll find your grace.” And he means it. Because if he doesn’t then Cas would know and that would mean he would leave again. “You don’t have to go.”
Castiel folds his arms over his chest. “And you came to the conclusion that I was the most befitting candidate?”
“I want to know how long...how long you’ve been— when you realized.” Cas scrubs his hands over his face. “I don’t know what I’m trying to say.  Never mind.” He collapses onto his bed.
Cas thumbs through the first file. “Again, no real connection.  Even serial killers show some preference for who they choose as victims: same background, same age, same watering hole,” he notes, using one of Dean’s trademark terms.  He notices Dean’s small smile at that.
He hears Dean end the phone call and forces himself out of the bathroom.  With barely a glance in Dean’s direction, he flips the lights off and crawls into bed.
As much as Sam likes to say he’s healthy (“No, no, see, I can add avocado because it’s a fruit, same with tomatoes and pickles.  And mayonnaise doesn’t have any trans fat, so it can’t be that bad for you.  Three cheeses just means more calcium.  And, look, I’m adding lettuce, so it’s almost a salad.”), he’s still a hunter and a Winchester. That means burgers cannot be avoided forever.
Dean wants to kiss Cas, but he can’t stop staring at the man— the angel— in front of him.  Cas has been around since before time, when matter was still decompressing at an alarming rate in the universe, and he’s here now.  After every single thing they have both done, to the world and to each other, somehow the universe allowed for them to both be here in this moment.
“I’m going to go make dinner,” he says, pushing himself off the bed. “I’ll let you know when I’m done.” He closes the door as he leaves.
Cas hooks his fingers around Dean’s waist, pulling him closer. Dean cards his fingers through Cas’s hair, loving the expression that comes over his face as his eyes flutter shut and his face turns upwards.
Suddenly Cas’s anger is reflected right back at him. “You damn well know why we had to do that Cas!  It was for your own good!”
Dean catches his bag too, trying not to think of Cas’s tie in it or that his shirt has one more button open than usual. “Dude, how were we supposed to know if something went wrong?”
“Be careful—” Dean burps, and stumbles in the process, “— or next time I’ll make sure you’re the drunk one.”
She swings around to face his, mad. “You can address me as Detective Labeaux,” she huffs. “And the whole damned building is a crime scene.  I don’t have to babysit you two, do I?”
“Castiel.  You are being summoned immediately,” is his only warning before the distantly familiar feeling behind his navel yanks him off balance.
Cas deepens the kiss, trying to bring Dean into him— or the other way around?— Dean can’t really tell.  There’s a slow hand moving over Dean’s body, taking its time tracing his collarbone and weaving between his ribs, it stops to press flat against his lower abdomen, and then it gently wraps around Dean’s cock.  The hunter wraps his arms around Cas’s head, trying to pull him closer.
Cas is once two fingers are buried to the knuckle. Right now he really can’t imagine his cock fitting in Cas, but—
It’s been a couple months since he came back from Heaven, with new scars carved into his grace.  The first week or so was simple enough, he’d been so exhausted and run thin that he was physically unable to think about the battle, repressing almost everything but what he let himself tell Dean.  Now though, he spends every moment awake, scared that if he succumbs to sleep he’ll have to relive the death of Hannah and the rest of his murdered brethren.
He is slow to respond. “I thought maybe the elders would take more pity on me if they thought I wasn’t able to sustain myself without a vessel, and see how badly I do need my grace returned.” He doesn’t wince or gasp the entire time Dean stitches up his wounds.
This case has him wound up and frustrated, and he can’t pinpoint why.  His entire being shakes with unease as his thinks of the missing people that are probably suffering at this very moment.
Dean wipes his hand off on the blanket behind him— briefly noting he’ll toss it off the bed before he falls asleep— then cups Castiel’s neck. Dean slowly traces his fingers over his shoulder, counts every rib as his fingers travel downwards, squeezes his hip briefly; then his hand reverses the journey.  This continues a few more times before Cas grabs his wrist. He brings it above Dean’s head, gently rolling them until he’s now lying half on top of Dean, his left leg hooked over Dean’s right.
He is doing laundry while Dean showers before they watch a movie.  Never mind the fact that they just got back from the movies.  Also, never mind the fact that they sat in the back row of the empty theater and made out like a couple of teenagers the whole time.  Dean wants to watch another movie and Castiel wouldn’t mind sucking more bruises into Dean’s shoulder before the night is over.
“Okay, man, I get it.” The hunter can’t suppress another gag as the two pass the bags of bloody viscera.  A man’s mangled face looms in a bag the medics didn’t zip all the way. “Can you not smell that shit?” Dean asks Cas, noticing his face is too soft for the smells in this hallway. Two EMTs carry out another body bag and lay it down in line.
“There’s a baseball game on tonight— Sam’s team is playing— it’s not a big game, but it’s a reason to drink beer and eat burgers none the less.”
“There is a total of seventeen different human’s bodily remains found at the various crime scenes.  One of the detectives said at least thirty-nine different people have been confirmed missing, with another eleven possibly missing.  Nine total, but deceased, bodies accounted for.” He riddles off these facts with minimal emotion, his face just as monotonous as his voice.
“I want to be fully human again.  Because no matter how contorted my grace is, it is still a grace.  I will always have a connection to Heaven that I feel I no longer deserve because I no longer want it.  Heaven is no longer a defining aspect of who I am as a being.”
He helps Cas sit against the wall and then goes to lie in the middle of the floor himself, staring up at the window. The only window in the entire Bunker. He forces himself not to look at Cas, but that only works until he hears him pick up the bottle and take a long swallow from it. It’s empty when he pulls it away from his lips. His lips shine with the remnants of the liquor before he licks it away.
They go on with the rest of their day, silence thick between them, waiting for the moment to break it and start one hell of a conversation.
“What?” Dean guffaws at this, his hand coming up to cup Cas’s neck. “Man, oh man, buddy, you are full of tricks.”
“And I care about him.”  Dean’s definitely going to puke.  He pulls Baby over to the shoulder of the road, punching on her hazard lights.  Pushing open the door, he hangs his head out the side waiting for the bile to come up.  The rush of icy air hits him hard.
He loved her, undoubtedly.  Her and Ben were two of the greatest things to ever happen to him, he would never be able to deny that.  She knew who he was, she saw him for who he truly was, and loved him anyways.  Dean couldn’t let that go.  He couldn’t not try to give her everything she had given him. He let himself feel, for the first time in a long time, when he fell apart in her arms every night for the first few weeks.  He let her see how vulnerable and absolutely broken he was.  Sure, she would never be able to bring Sam back or empathize with Dean, but she was compassionate and determined to take care of him.
He sees his shadow move as it stands up and leaves, back to the kitchen to get more alcohol. The door shutting behind him is Dean’s queue to sigh loudly.
And then they’re kissing.  Dean doesn’t know who started it or when, but all he can think about is the taste of Cas’s mouth.
The brothers find out, once they have the reaper in a trap, that a gang of demons controlled him. Working to build an army of souls, these demons planned to rebel against Crowley and rule Hell themselves. “Yeah, right,” Dean mutters at the nonsense, “as if that would actually happen.”
Both brothers turn to stare at Cas, amazed at his trash talk.  Then they bust out laughing.  Dean opens up two more beers, handing one to Cas with a loose smile on his face.
Looking in the mirror again confirms both that the hickey is gone and that Dean’s pupils are certainly not dilated
“And now Hamon has agreed to help me.  There’s a spell, not much unlike a ceremony, that would allow for my grace to completely detach from my soul with little ill effect.  Because even when I was human before, my soul still yearned for what my grace had to give, it knew it was was missing something.  With this spell, it would no longer feel the connection.  Hamon said he would alert me when he has everything he needs for this spell, and that I can decide to complete it when I am ready.”
Finally his grace hones in on the source of the bleeding, and he presses his palms to his chest and stomach, pulsing his power through Dean’s veins.  His hands continue to scan Dean’s body, but there’s just too many wounds.  He’s going to bleed out, he’s already lost too much blood.  Castiel can’t replenish his blood.
He finds himself grinding into Castiel’s thigh, the hair there an unusual feeling but also arousing. Still focused on Cas’s cock, dripping with precum now that Dean is pumping it as hard as his limited movement will allow him.  The fluid trickles down over Cas’s stomach, and Dean finds enough courage to follow the trail with his tongue before sucking a bruise into Cas’s lower stomach right there. His eyes never leave the hardening member.
If it were that easy, if it were that simple, Dean would have stopped being scared long ago.  But the ever-growing knot of doubt and terror only twists itself tighter in his chest. He can’t rid his mind of the idea that at some point, it doesn’t matter when because it’ll happen no matter what, that he will screw this up.  Or it’ll screw itself up.  Because nothing good ever happens to the Winchesters, nothing lasting at least.  He won’t allow himself happiness because he’s so sure he would break under the pain to follow when everything comes crashing down.
He doesn’t want to remember the days when Cas was locked up, for his own good, but he has to for Cas’s sake.
When they first arrived, Cas hacked his way into the local police station’s server and started researching about the missing people that originally drew them to this case.  They all disappeared from within the same few blocks of each other, in a part of town that was less than pleasant but never had any true trouble.  Until people started to spread rumors about a supposed serial killer that has taken these victims.
“And you didn’t think to tell us before you went out?” Sam asks, catching his bag. “What if something had happened, Cas?”
Dean laughs. “Shit, Cas.” He smiles at Cas, relief evident in his eyes. “We can call Charlie up ASAP and get you some ID and a social and all that.  She’ll make sure that we’d be each other’s next of kin and all that, don’t worry,” he reassures, pulling into the Walmart parking lot.
The long awaited chapter that is part final chapter and part epilogue.  Little snippets into what their new day to day is like.
They finish up the remaining objects, planning on taking them back to the storage room at the bunker.  Sam suggests a pub across the street, since Dean doesn’t want to drive Baby anywhere right now. Once seated, Dean orders wings and whiskey and Sam settles for chowder.  Soon they’re both convinced to try the
He can’t go another four days without knowing where Cas is, if he’s okay, if he’s safe.  And if that means talking with Cas about what he actually thinks, then so be it.  This argument is no longer about making Cas stay an angel, it’s about making sure Cas stays safe.
Once at the front counter, she pulls out a shallow box, the inside lined with velvet.  About two dozen pens lie in the slots, a little label each of them noting the material they’re made from. One reads
“You know exactly how many mistakes I’ve made,” Dean bursts. He takes a ragged breath to steady himself; it doesn’t work. “You fucking know how much I’ve hurt you.  I can’t fucking do that to you again, not after everything.”
Dean wants to chuck his phone across the room; to have control over something as simple as talking or not would be nice. “Just a fucking fight, Sam.  Shit happens.”
Sam knows how much Dean appreciates the bunker but he doesn’t think he’ll ever know the extent. The domestics of the whole environment remind Dean of Mom or Lisa and Ben, part of him still holding on to those slices of normality he had for such a short time. Having a fully stocked kitchen or his own room, luxuries he never before had as a hunter, make him ache for a boring life that he never considered.
The panic settles itself comfortably in Dean’s chest, relaxing more and more the longer he doesn’t say anything.
“No, I meant it reminds me of planes, the jerkiness and speed of your ‘zapping.’ I just don’t like it, okay.”
“Yeah, yeah, I’m comin’,” he almost slurs, pushing himself into a sitting position.  Cas reaches out a hand, ready to help Dean out of the car. “I can do this, Cas,” he says gently, “I’m not incapacitated yet.”
The Winchesters finish the box and stand, ready to brace themselves against the New Orleans crowds once again.
“How did you even get your body messed up while in heaven?” he asks, measuring a length of string for sutures. “I thought you didn’t need vessels up there.”
The kids approach the table again, beers in hand.  Dean and Cas both immediately stand, Dean now effectively blushing behind the glass of whiskey he’s drinking.
He’s too angry and definitely too damned tired to deal with Cas dropping in whenever he feels like it. He doesn’t care how busy he is or what the hell he does when he’s not with them, but he should at least call Dean back. “What the hell, Cas?” he muttes into the pillow, not even bothering to move, let alone sit up to face him.
After a moment, “Is there anything else you’d like to know now?” Cas asks, stretching under Dean, his hands pressing to the headboard and back arching.
repeats in Dean’s head almost three times before it finally makes sense.  Cas then grips his hair, hard, demanding him to continue, pulling Dean out of his stupor.
“Look, Cas, it wasn’t your fault, Sam and I both know that.  You have to understand that too.” He realizes how angry Cas is with himself before even knowing the whole story.
He knew he’d talk to Dean about everything one day, even talk about the two of them, but now that the conversation is here…  He’s dragging the words out of Dean; Dean fighting back tooth and nail, trying to keep his hardened exterior in place, all his defenses coming up.  Cas didn’t want it to happen this way at all, with Dean and him spitting hostility between each other.  He wanted Dean to finally feel safe talking about this, and right now he knows Dean is unmeasurably scared.  But Cas needs to hear it, he needs to hear Dean say it.
“Well, Sammy, you’re making an exception tonight.” Dean pulls the burgers off the stove. “I daresay these are the best burgers even I could ask for.” He dips his head in a shallow bow.
Sorry this took so long!  I started working at this firm in Austin and now I have a bunch of time to write again!  Yay~  Anywho, this hasn't been beta'd yet, so it's not perfect, but I will repost it once it is beta'd.  Enjoy!
Remembering back to all the times he and Dean were intimate, are especially telling of the depth of Dean’s fear.  In the beginning, the moment they stopped touching, Dean would curl in on himself and try to force any lingering emotions as far down as possible.  Cas was beyond frustration then.  He knew Dean was experiencing a myriad of emotions that he was not ready to face yet, he knew Dean’s past and that he would react according to that.  Cas was unable to understand it completely because he could not empathize.
Later that night, Dean’s in the motel bed, on the phone with Sam, while Cas stares at his reflection in the mirror.  He knows he’s been in here much longer than necessary, and Dean must have noticed, but he can’t tear himself away from the haunting image in front of him.
The kids confer for a minute, a couple of them turning out pockets. “Okay.” The best player of the group stands forward, laying the two hundred on the table Dean’s leaning against. “But just me and him.” He nods at Cas.
There’s confusion in the hunter’s eyes when he looks away but when he looks back it’s been replaced with something close to humor. “Are you talking about my dick, Cas?  ‘Cause if you are, trust me, I know there ain’t anything insignificant about it,” he laughs.  Dean rolls on his back and shakes his hips, laughing harder now.
Both hearts beat harder than they have all night, and Dean’s pretty sure this is the hardest his heart
“I’m gonna go get myself some lunch,” Dean interrupts.  At the counter he orders two po’boys and a beer, and waits while watching the muted television.  The journalist looks like she’s interviewing one of the band members who came to perform this week. “Where’s Cas?” he asks, sitting down back at Sam’s table with food.
“Can you just mail it to me?  My brother and I are leaving now, we were just in Denver for business.” Sam’s gone back over to the books, catching on that Dean didn’t want to talk right now.
The rit zien’s vessel lays sprawled in a lump not ten feet from them, Cas’s angel blade still protruding from it’s chest; it’s no longer a threat.
Sam wastes no time ripping into the wrappings.  Cas got him an old angel’s manuscript, detailing the fighting techniques of angel garrisons, complete with pictures of their armour and diagrams of strategies.  He thanks Cas profusely, turning the pages slowly.  The he rips into Dean’s; Dean had found an old letter Bobby had written to their dad tucked in the back of his journal months ago.  It details the ten months they spent with Bobby when they were young; how good Sam was doing in school, how Dean could rival himself as a mechanic, how Sam would not stop talking at dinner about some girl in his class, how Dean spent most weekends fishing on the lake, and so on. Sam read the whole thing three times before turning to his brother.
Around five hundred thirty the hunter hears a bowl scrape across the table right before it clinks against his mug.  There’s a bowl of cereal and a retreating angel as he looks up. Cas comes back with his own mug and the milk jug for Dean.  He doesn’t look at Dean—
“Cas, buddy.” Dean shakes his head. “You are losing it,” he laughs, but pulling Cas in my his collar and kissing him anyways.
Dean swallows hard. “I’m sorry, man. Cas, I thought you knew. I thought you fucking knew why I had to keep you in there— I had to keep you safe.”
“We should split up and at least visit the rest of the crime scenes, see if there’s any information there.”
As soon as they made it to the motel, only forty minutes later than they wanted, Dean flopped himself onto the bed and told Cas to wake him up when the Chinese food got there.
Dean’s immediate reaction when Cas walks through the door is wrap him in a hug.  He can feel how stiff Cas is, his frustrations still so close to the surface.  But he won’t let go, can’t let go, terrified Cas is going to leave again.
Dean can’t remember the last time his nerves felt as raw as right now. “Cas, how long did we fucking look for your grace?  This shit all of us went through to get that back!  And now you’ve had it just over a year and you want to rip it out again?”
“Cas,” he grunts out between kisses, “Cas, get us back to the motel.” It’s as much a plea as a demand.
The angel knows exactly what Dean wants; his briefs are gone when he blinks. A long and low hiss leaves his mouth through gritted teeth.  Cock on cock stills his hips as he focuses solely on Cas’s sliding back and forth over his, the heads catching briefly with each thrust.  Then a hand glides across the bend of Cas’s hip, and Dean has both cocks in his fist, jerking at the overwhelming sensation.  It’s so much hotter than he thought it’d be. He squeezes harder when he reaches the heads, and Cas’s arms buckle with the pleasure of it.  Still supported on his elbows, he keeps thrusting though, urging Dean on with bites on his shoulder that will leave marks later. Dean raises his other hand to spit on it but instead Cas grabs his wrist, pulling it around his back.
Cas is too close in the tiny restroom, which suddenly heated a few degrees when he entered. Dean can’t take it anymore. He grabs the lapels of the angel’s jacket and brings their bodies together, brings their faces together. He knows he looks angry.  Cas’s breath hitches but his expression remains unchanged.  Hopefully Cas interprets this as a drunk and angry Dean that doesn't want another guy in the bathroom with him and they can leave the bar all together.
“This,” Cas’s voice comes out deeper than usual.  He’s in the doorframe of what looks to be the laundry room.
Tonight, Dean is going to be honest even if it kills him.  Even if he won’t be able to convince Cas to stay an angel, he can at least admit to Cas why he doesn’t want him to be mortal.
It takes them at least another two hours to sort through all the files, the sun is starting to set now and it’s definitely cooled down.
It was a quick and dirty case in rural Missouri.  A few djinn were feeding on the small town population.  Unfortunately, it had taken months for the news of the staggering death toll in the one-stop-light-town to gain any sort of media attention and near a dozen people had already been murdered.  Dean lets out what seems like every ounce of his frustration and anger on the three djinn hauled up in an abandoned horse barn on the south side of the town.  He guts them, rips them to shreds, makes sure not to leave until their blood is cold.  Afterwards, once Cas stows his angel blade, he walks up to an exhausted Dean.  He takes the man’s face between his hands and pours some grace between their bond to fade the fatigue and heal any physical damage.  They stay in their motel room for one more night, Dean curled away from Cas as the angel strokes his back.
Dean hasn’t asked Cas to heal him, even though one surge of his grace through Dean’s body would mean that virus dead and gone within seconds.  A part of Cas, that seems to keep growing (has been ever since he decided to stay in the bunker), is glad that Dean is allowing Cas this small act.  Dean is letting Cas heal him in all the ways any other human would, a slow and tedious process, but it shows the depth of his affection anyways.  Cas lets Dean kiss him between coughing fits and sneezes, and if that doesn’t prove how willing he is to be here, he doesn’t know what will.  He laughs at the absurdity of his thought process, but looks over and Dean and smiles again.
, they both think, the thought bouncing between them, each time it becomes more believable.  Feeling Cas’s solid presence right there under him, a reminder that the angel is a— if not
He pulls away enough to press a kiss to the underside of Dean’s jaw, before burrowing himself back into the safety and warmth of Dean’s body.
It’s still strange taking as much time in the bathroom as he needs, not worried about having to share one with Sammy anymore. Being able to fully look at himself, or not look at himself, in the mirror. His eyes trace over his body, still riddled with scars no matter how many times Cas heals him. The burn of his handprint is still stark against his skin after all these years.
Cas nods and leads the way to Joshua’s.  Not surprisingly, it’s just around the corner from the apartments they visited earlier.
Cas stands awkwardly, trying to remember how Dean’s shoulders were more relaxed when walking as he pretended to be drunk.
Cas grabs one wrist with the other hand, playing with an old bracelet of Dean’s he’s taken to wearing.
Dean wakes up early, Cas’s lips demanding as they make out, before Dean insists on getting up to make breakfast.
“I just thought, while we were there, I mean that—” Cas takes a deep breath; Dean can almost physically feel the sigh. “Honestly, before everything happened, I thought I’d be able to talk to you about it.”  Cas finally turns around, pulling at his tie angrily. “But then I made you leave without me and then fucking Naomi and—”
man born on January 24th, 1979 as opposed to all the others born that day.  As opposed to any others born throughout the history of the human race.  He would never be able to explain to Dean how he had to only watch as his family was ripped apart, initially and every time after, and knowing that it was going to happen before it did.  Half of him is too coward to admit it and the other half unwilling to reveal that information because of the pain it would cause.
He forces Cas’s pants down but before he can remove the underwear, Cas moans hotly into his neck.  A visible shake renders Dean’s body immobile as he hovers above Cas, waiting for the overwhelming sensation to pass.  Using this temporary pause to his advantage, the angel flips them both and gets to work on Dean’s pants. His nails drag down Dean’s thighs as he does so, snapping him back to reality.
Dean finally looks up at this; he didn’t find the answer at the end, only a blank page, with a yellowing water stain. “But…?”
He leans against the table next to Dean, ducking his head and waiting for Dean to look up.  The hunter shakes his head and does so, his knee starting to bounce.
“What crawled up your ass and died?” Sam mumbles around another yawn as Dean hurries back to Cas’s room.
“I like when you’re here,” Cas whispers.  Cas must sense Dean’s confusion because he continues, “You always try not to think about us when we’re together, it scares you too much.  But, just so you know, I like having you here, mind, body, and all.”
— fuck Castiel open, nice and slow, he’s not nearly as nervous or unsure about it as he thought he’d be.  Dean’s flat out excited, and not just because it’s been almost a year since he’s properly fucked anyone.  He’s so fucking thrilled to do this with
They haven’t kissed like this before, Dean thinks, feeling guilty. Cas deserves these kinds of kisses all the time.  It’s a slow slide of lips, almost too soft, only enough pressure to promise more to follow. Cas’s breath starts to hitch in uneven intervals and Dean takes that to mean
Dean catches his reflection in the rearview mirror, the confusion and desperation all too obvious in his eyes.  He immediately recalls last night’s activities, the hairs on his neck automatically standing on end.
my intent was good.  As it has always been!  If you no longer have time or respect for me, then tell me to leave, do not fool me into thinking I am wanted here.”
And before Cas even realizes what might result because of that, Dean is already moving off of him.  Dean sits up and throws his legs over the side of the bed so he can pull his jeans back on.  Castiel sits up, leaning back on his elbows, experiencing thorough emotional whiplash.
“Alright, lets go see what Sam has found.” Dean takes the quickest route possible out of the building, relishing in the fresh but humid air outside.
It starts early, around six o’clock the hunter wakes up and kisses an already wide-eyed Cas next to him.  Their mouths almost lazy against one another’s as their fingers trail over sleep-warm skin.  Seven o’clock rolls around, the sun just starting to stream through the tiny window in the motel bathroom, drawing a streak that finally reaches across the foot of their bed; they decide it’s time to get up and leave.
“Why are you so opposed to doing things the angel way?” Cas asks over his shoulder, startling Dean, who almost hits his head on the hood.
His hair’s a fucking mess, he can barely hold himself together, and his body— not to mention the entirety of his being— is weak.
plays as Dean researches a cursed skull from an ancient Indonesian tribe but he can’t think about anything besides
Dean tries to continue researching the case, but Cas’s plate from lunch sits on the table distracting him.  After thirty minutes, no longer able to focus at all, he heads to shower.
“Scra— scratch my shoulder blade,” he huffs out, before biting slowly into Dean’s neck. It’s an odd request to say the least but Dean complies, dragging his nails over the structure.
He’s pushed further away when more professionals come to help.  A group of ER doctors and nurses situate Dean’s body on a gurney.
“Don’t speak much, okay, you can be the quiet-drunk.  You just follow my lead, okay?  We’ll leave them high and dry once they match my two hundred deal, got it?” Cas nods in affirmation, his prop beer in his hands.  Dean downs the rest of his whiskey in one gulp. He claps Cas on the shoulder as he stands, aiming a wink at him.
.  His blade clatters to the floor as he pulls the vessel up by its shoulders, throwing it across the alley.
“Do you, uh, do you remember why you had to stay locked in that room while Sam and I looked for your grace?”
Sam was the one who had to transfer Cas from room to shower to room to toilet to room. Every time Dean got too close, Cas would throw himself and his obscenities (sometimes English curses slipping in between the Enochian ones) at the hunter.  He did the same to Sam, but at least the younger brother could handle the rage. Whereas Dean, would crumple under the anger even though he knew it was not personal.  So Dean sat outside the door, trying his best to protect Cas the only way he could.
Dean’s lips are burning. “I was thinking we could fire up the grill, figuratively, kinda have a cookout, there’s a game on tonight.”  Sometimes Dean doesn’t realize how desperately he craves domesticity.
“With their bare hands.” He pauses. “So, yeah…  I began looking into self sacrificing stuff.  Turns out there’s a local legend about a witch who killed her victims by having them commit suicide while she watched.”
“Yeah, angel, yeah, like that.  Beautiful. Like that, c’mon, so good for me, baby, so good on my cock.”
.  Then Cas grabs the side of his head, pulling them together, and pressing his lips softly to Dean’s temple. “Thank you.”
Cas now looks out the window, despite the blinds blocking it.  “You know how we suspected it was the owner of the properties, Joshua James-Patterson?” Sam and Dean wait for an answer, and Cas continues when they don’t reply, “Well, that body we found in his house last night, was actually not his.  It was another victim’s, this time a decoy though, to throw us off.  Early this morning, before you woke, I found the real Joshua, who was indeed the one committing the sacrifices and practicing voodoo. I took care of him. Thus, now all his spells are reversed and there will be no more zombies or sacrificial murders.” He gets up from the table, still not looking at either one of them.
Just as he turns around, Cas opens the door to the room, holding a box of what can only be donuts and a carrier of coffees. “I got you two breakfast. We can leave when you’re done.”
“You act as if this is some favor I’m doing for them, as if I’m repaying a debt.  I’m doing this because I have to— because I want to.  I’m still an angel, Dean, I’m still a soldier.  I’m still able to help them, so that’s what I’m going to do.  I’ve won battles in the past, this is the same thing, I’m going to aid them in this struggle for freedom.” Cas sounds like a piece of outdated war propaganda.
If Dean thinks the sigh he just released doesn’t sound close to a sob, then he’s lying to himself.  He screws his eyes shut, hoping that will be enough to keep the emotions he’s feeling—
Dean pushes his box aside and moves to shut the laptop.  Cas stops him, but does move it to the side.
The expected lips don’t expectedly fall on his own but rather on the bolt of his jaw, soft as they graze down his neck.
Dean finishes chewing on the bite he took. “He didn’t wait for me?” He puts as little emotion into that sentence as possible.
“Yeah, well, it’s always ‘one last time,’ Cas.  They’re never going to stop bothering you if you just keep saying yes to every one of their pleas.  You don’t have to always solve their problems, you have your own life to live.  Besides, c’mon, you know we’ve got a case to handle anyways.  You can’t let me take on a pack of vamps by myself.”
“I’ve been thinking about removing my grace since the angels called upon me to help fight Metatron,” Cas starts. “Not because I wanted no powers as an excuse to not help them, but because for the first time I did not feel the ever-binding duty to help Heaven.  Since my beginning, my one purpose was to act as a function for Heaven, to follow out orders from those above me, and eventually to direct those below me.  I was to aid Heaven in any and all ways, such as was the purpose of all angels.  Even those who have betrayed, only do so because their grace has been damaged to the point that they truly believe they are helping Heaven.
— and Cas locks eyes with him as he stretches his lips around his cock, swallowing him whole in one slow, fluid motion.
“Woah, pal,” Dean warns, a laugh bursting from his lips. “I ain’t the one with all these lines on my face.” He rolls towards Cas, feeling the wing shift above him as he does, and lays half on top of him.  He traces the lines of Cas’s face with his thumb.
“Thirty dollar deal?” The kid asks, and Dean pulls out his wad of cash, making sure the kid sees that it’s value.
“He went to check the rest of the crime scenes.  He said it’d be faster if he did it his way, since he won’t have to navigate the crowds.”
” Dean reiterates, practically yelling it.  He kicks the chair in front of him and slams his hands down again.  He starts to pace around the war room. “You don’t have to do this!  This isn’t your problem anymore!”
“Castiel, wait, please,” this time it is Hamon who speaks.  Castiel does not turn around, he only slows down. “I have not forgotten the debt I owe you.  That is why I came here…  I ask you now, Castiel, on the behalf of this garrison, please, consider leading us against Metatron.  We will not ask anymore of you after this task is completed.  Please, Castiel, one last victory.”
Dean turns his face into the pillow, groaning, his face even hotter now.  Cas wraps his arms around him, pulling and turning him until their eyes stare into each other’s.  Neither says anything, Dean still too embarrassed, Cas looking awestruck.  Cas noses at Dean’s hairline, his smile radiating onto Dean’s skin.
Neither him or Dean mentioned the situation again, they continued their routine and Castiel didn’t argue, even if it was boring or repetitive.  Because he did not want to see that expression on Dean’s face again.
Sam calls him as he’s heading to bed.  Whispering into the phone, he confirms where Cas is, “What the fuck did you do to make Cas show up on my door shit-faced and pass out before even crossing the threshold?” He’s not whispering by the end, clearly angry.
“I had come to you the night before severely injured because I’d been reckless in heaven. you didn’t want to have to monitor me while hunting, it’s understandable.”
Dean wants to give him time to think, so he pulls back, but before he can let go, Cas pulls his hands closer.
.  He’s scared more than anything else right now, but he can’t admit that.  The thought of losing Cas doesn’t just sting, it destroys.  He feels himself caving in.  It’s selfish, but Dean can’t live without the comfort of knowing Cas is safer with his grace.
Cas ignores it for the first couple minutes, not understanding where his thoughts are, not knowing how he could possibly answer.
“After being an angel and having spent time as a human, I know I’m capable of living without a grace.”
Sam looks at Dean with an expression he’s never seen before.  He should stop now before he says too much.
“Don’t act so surprised, Dean.” He looks over his shoulder. “I have been avidly hunting for several months now.  I know a thing or two.”
Dean shakes his head and thanks her, closing the journal. As he picks up the burger, Sam’s still reading the article. Knocking on the newspaper like a door, it crumbles a bit under his force and Sam’s face appears. “Dude, we already know it’s a reaper, you don’t have to read anymore.”
Hannah shifts her eyes, making eye contact with a few other angels.  They have been nearly silent the entire time, not one of them even attempting to speak to Castiel.
“Sure, I’ll just ‘poof’ right out of the bunker right after I promise to suck your dick.  No, I didn’t realize you wanted that.  I was too busy doing angel things to care about your blue balls.” Cas hears the drawer to Dean’s dresser scrape open angrily. “Oh?  Were you expecting to have sex with me after your shower?” Cas stands in the doorway to Dean’s room, amused as he listens and watches Dean ready himself for bed. “I’m an angel, I do important angel-y things— that involve me leaving right before we do important sexy things— like fuck.” Dean punctuates the words by throwing back the covers on his bed.
Cas sits up, planting his hands on either side of Dean’s head, grinding harder at this angle.  Dean lifts his head to look down at their torsos.
“Let’s just leave him here until we find the rest of the demons.” Sam looks up from his quick researching. “Then maybe we’ll come back for him.” Dean closes the door to the cellar and they leave the abandoned building.
So four years later and I finally decided to finish this.  I guess thanks Supernatural finale for being what it was and spurring some creativity out of me.
“Okay, now you can pick a stain for the wood, and whether or not you want the engraving stained, colored, or left plain.” She pulls out two sheets showing the different stains and colors.
Dean’s eyes are still closed, but even if they were open, Cas wouldn’t notice because his eyes are trained on the spot on Dean’s chest that is stuttering up and down as he continues to breathe.
Dean bends to spit in the sink, hiding his relief from Sam. “Bite me, Sammy.” He claps him on the shoulder as he passes.
“That’s it.” Cas stares directly in his eyes, and for the first time in months Dean has to look away because he’s scared. “I don’t know when exactly, but I don’t want to wait forever.”
It’s not like Dean could ever completely forget the hunter life when making up a backstory for some girl in a bar.  Behind his tales of detailing expensive cars or being a stuntman for movies, the current case was not forgotten.  No matter how far he tried to separate himself those nights, he couldn’t, not fully. A hunter to the bone, as John would say. Dean knew that he’d forget that poor girl’s name by the next morning, deserting her bed while his heart was still pounding and his legs were still soft.  He couldn’t actually like the girl, not when he knew in a few hours he’d leave and reenter the world of hunting.  The demons never really left, literally or figuratively.
“Do you not like human food anymore, dude?” Dean asks, as the angel passes the box to Sam without taking one.  Sometimes he would sporadically eat with them these last few months, mostly burgers and desserts though.
Cas turns on his stomach, and Dean can feel the shadow of Cas’s wing draping over him, a now familiar feeling, as the buzz of energy presses on him, keeping him close and safe.
“You’d be surprised what strength helplessness can give to some souls,” the reaper counters from inside the trap. Sam is looking up ways to banish a reaper right now, but they’ll probably just kill him. They still have an extra angel blade in the trunk.
“One more round, assholes!” the kid interjects. “Double or fuckin’ nothing’ and we play pairs again, dammit.” He’s the most drunk of his friends.
It both excites and terrifies Dean.  But with Cas thrusting his cock deeper into his mouth, as Dean grips his hips, Dean can’t actually think of why he’s scared.  All he can think is
He’s been trying for so long to deal with this himself, to not burden Dean with the worry of his own mental health.
Cas pitches forward, again locking his mouth with Dean’s.  Dean’s mouth spills dozens of more filthy words out as he just continues fucking Cas.
Then, the longer they were together, especially after Dean admitted to Sam the nature of their relationship, Dean would steal himself little moments of joy.  Whether it be pulling Cas up against him out back of a bar, grabbing Cas’s hand while driving, or not shying away when Cas told him how
“Alison said I should give you the news? I’m Doctor Halloway,”she introduces, taking in Cas’s stained apparel.
“I was just...,” Dean clears his throat and tries again, “I was looking at this one.” He points to the customizable one.
Eventually, Cas started showing signs of leveling out.  Once, when Dean slid his lunch into the room, Cas grabbed his wrist and started whispering nonsense.  Dean tried his best to comfort him with hushed noises in response. The next time Cas ran his fingers over Dean’s palm as alcohol was passed under the door.  Then he stroked the hairs on Dean’s forearm as breakfast was served.  And like that, the touches and the compassion started to come back to Cas as the weeks wore on. In between all the misleading searches and dead ends when hunting for his grace, Dean could still find hope in the fact that Cas was improving.  He started speaking again, English that now made sense, that Dean could understand even if he didn’t know the source.  Cas was quoting books and documents,
They’re on the road for an hour before Sam speaks up again. “Why’d you get Cas a present? You haven’t gotten him any Christmas presents before.”
— he’s focused on the laptop he pulled up in front of him.  A few more minutes of deep breathing, and Dean thinks he can take on this bowl of cereal.
And the last couple days before Dean and Sam left on their final trip— the one that would end in finding Cas’s grace— Dean would listen to Cas speaking coherently. He seemed to be thinking aloud but not knowing it.  Just quiet whispers about his grace and heaven and Dean and Sam.  Hushed prayers thanking Dean…
And their lips are pressed together again with a heat that would rival Hell. Hands are everywhere as both men try to pull each other closer.  Dean settles with wrapping his arms around Cas’s neck, angling Cas’s head so he can press his tongue deeper into his mouth.  He’s delirious with the thought of having some part of him in the angel. In return, Cas’s hands are around Dean’s waist, his fingers running up and down his spine, sometimes clawing at the muscles there.  Eventually those fingers find their way under Dean’s t-shirt as he’s nibbling along Cas’ bottom lip.
Asking the question grounds him and subdues his panicked thoughts before they start to manifest. He thinks he knows the answer but he wants to know for sure.
“No, not you, Dean. Humans. How do humans live knowing they are so powerless in this world? I can feel myself seeping out, breaking down, I can feel my powers dulling every second.”
The laptop screen goes dark as Castiel’s mind folds in on itself as he ruminates over the breakdown he had months back.  There were complete days of darkness, he remembers that much, but he just assumed it was the alcohol.  Faint hollows of emotions echo through him as the memories flutter back.  Not everything, more like shadows.  He remembers the encompassing feelings of dread, shame, anger, and desperation as he was made to wait.  Knowing secondhand what he did to Dean and Sam’s home is completely different from remembering it.  Secondhand was almost worse, he imagined well beyond what Dean told him, simply assuming Dean would water it down, easing the story into Castiel’s thoughts.  He didn’t though, he was completely truthful when telling Castiel.  And, Castiel realizes then,
The microwave beeps, and Cas pulls the plastic container out, sitting it on the table, before putting his own container in.  Dean perks his head at the smell of the teriyaki beef and sits himself at the table, immediately digging in, starving since he hasn’t eaten since breakfast.
He pulls out his phone, Sam’s number lighting the screen. “What’s up, Sammy?” he asks, instantly noticing his voice is an octave higher than usual.
“Dammit, I would have thought it was him, considering the connection.” He sighs. “I’m almost done here.  I’m going to head to the coroner’s office after this, she said I could stop by to grab copies of her files and go over them with her.”
“So hard for me, so ready for me,” he whispers, watching Cas’s mouth go slack as his licks a stripe on the underside of his erection. He sucks the head in between his lips, and feels more than hears Cas moan at the heat around his cock.
Dean takes in his surroundings and his current condition before speaking, “I guess we should have called Charlie a couple days ago, huh?”
They’ve had this argument plenty of times before.  Each concerned more about the other’s safety than their own, each more willing to fight if it means the other doesn’t have to.  Cases where there’s a monster with a vendetta against angels, where Dean has to threaten Cas with a ring of holy fire before going out on his own to gank the bastard.  Or a particularly evil demon, who lets slip he was in Alistair’s inner circle, and Cas has to hold Dean back from recklessly attacking.  Every case seems to be another tick on their list, eventually adding up to the point where even Dean can’t ignore how much they mean to each other.
He passes his thumb over the head again, this time listening to Cas groan as he jerks away from the sensation.  Dean repeats, with a smirk on his lips, wondering how long he can keep Cas on this edge.
“You have to tell me,” he intones, yet anger and desperation fills the car. The angel turns the music down and Dean’s startled by this almost-terroristic act.
.  And his breathing is finally not only gasping.  Dean’s body is fascinating as well.  The blush occurs sometimes, like right now his chest and neck are flushed the color of sunsets from the Hadean eon, pink and blue and orange and magenta and gold and beige all at once.  The freckles that Castiel counted once but hadn’t told Dean because he knew the reaction would not be the one he was hoping for.  The stubble growing on his cheeks, a welcome scratch as Castiel’s mouth lazily licks across his jaw.  All these marks that make Dean the man he is even though other humans have them too.
Dean’s almost positive this is just a phase for Cas, who is still reeling from the battle with Metatron that was only a few months ago.  The angel still has not forgiven himself for Hannah’s death, thinking somehow he could have saved her.  He has woken more than once to find Castiel leaning over his journal or his face too close to the laptop screen as he tries to forget the pain by throwing himself into their work.  It would take fifteen minutes of talking before Cas would concede to laying back down with him.
The angel knows he should be angrier with Dean, furious that he is being used as some placeholder during his emotional turmoil.  But, taking one out of the Winchesters’ book, he ignores the obvious.  Meaning he lets himself be happy with the fact that Dean is even still willing to continue whatever it is between them.
It is a Thursday morning when Sam leaves the bunker for good; when Dean barely comes out of his room in time to hug goodbye.
“That’s a new one.  We used to only be able to do names, and we’d have to send them out of town for that. Now Mr. Johnson has his own engraving set and he can pretty much do anything,” she tells him. “What did you have in mind?”
“But I don’t know how to survive without—” slips from his mouth before he stops himself.  He kicks a cabinet out of frustration.
Sam’s adjusting his tie in the mirror, getting ready to go back to the police station, Dean assumes. “He said he was getting breakfast to celebrate.”
He ignores the way the angel’s warm body slots into his.  He can’t think about it.  The weight of Cas’s frame pulled against his is not the physical contact he’s been craving. It’s not satisfying. Listening to Cas’s breathing doesn’t calm his anxieties. It doesn’t relax him.
It is the first Thursday evening in February when Sam breaks the news to his brother; when Dean throws harsh words right back at him.
Cas hums in response, focusing on Dean’s fingers against his back, curling around his shoulder blades and pressing along his spine.
Sex still comes easy though.  The first time after Sam left, two weeks or so, Dean comes up behind Cas as he is sitting in the library, editing a book on demon physiology, and kneads his shoulders, not the first touch since Sam left but definitely one of the more intimate.  He is talking about dinner, a neutral topic, but Castiel isn’t listening, instead focusing on properly adding to the possession habits of South American demons.  Then Dean’s hands slide around to Castiel’s chest, tugging at the tie and popping a few buttons open so his hands can roam inside the shirt.  Castiel can’t focus on the habits anymore.  He leans back into the touch and tilts his head into it when Dean bends to kiss his temple.  Soon, Castiel finds himself standing and turning in Dean’s arms, pulling the other man closer.  The resulting sex leaves them both bent over the table, panting into the wood, sweating on the books and papers.
“Dean.” He reaches out, cupping his hand to Dean’s jaw. “You seem to think I have placed you upon a pedestal for how you should act in concern to our relationship.  While, yes, I might wish things played out differently sometimes, I wouldn’t change anything about us.  I expect no more from you than you are willing to give.”
Sam puts down the display letter opener he picked up from the counter, and looks at Dean again.  Paige begins to ramble about how they’ve never done it before but that she is sure Mr. Johnson would be able to.  She offers to call him up and ask.
While it may feel like a lie, Cas knows in his heart it’s not.  Even if he gets angry at Dean for never wanting to talk about their continuing relationship, he certainly doesn’t expect any less.  He knows Dean does better with a clap on the shoulder and a beer being passed than with words, so even this much of an exchange between them is a stepping stone.  He wants Dean, so if that means having to coax the man’s emotions out of him bit by bit, then that’s what he has to do.
Cas doesn’t really know how to say it, to tell Dean he wants to be a bigger part of the important things in Dean’s life without scaring Dean (he already knows he’s incredibly important to Dean).  He knows it’s not that Dean wouldn’t want it, but Dean is still growing enormously in terms of his emotions and ability to process them.  He never does too well with change or the unexpected.  The permanence of Cas in his life still seems to surprise him more mornings than not.  He’ll look at Cas softly, taking in everything he can, when he thinks Cas won’t notice; but of course Cas notices, he relishes in it.
At least Cas is out of the windowed room now and the hunter can seclude himself again. Sometimes it looks like Cas is about to follow him into the room but he takes a turn down another hallway right before he opens the door.  And then Dean is alone.
-I can tell my writing style has changed over the years (clearly influenced by time and exposure to other styles of writing), and I keep debating publishing this whole story over again as a single chapter fic with updated styles and aforementioned characters included. Not sure though; we'll see what the future holds.
Once Sam dresses in his FBI outfit, they all gather next to the table; Dean feelsanxious at the thought of traveling through time and space, Sam seems glad to leave the Bunker for the first time in a week, and Cas looks almost excited to have control over this bit of the hunt. He puts a hand on each Winchester’s shoulder without saying a word— and the contents of Dean’s stomach are still sloshing around as they appear in an alley.
As they’re unpacking the car in the carport, Sam asks from under the trunk of the Impala, “So...can I ask what you were doing naked in the kitchen a few weeks ago?” So Sam
“Yes, that is what I was thinking as well,” Cas agrees, confirming Dean’s suspicion about the zombies that lead them here in the first place.
Dean grumbles in his general direction, rubbing his temples as he beelines for the coffeepot.  At least his brother is decent enough to make a coffee for both of them. His head hurts too much to think about bending down to retrieve the sugar from under the counter, so he takes his coffee black and slumps over the cup once he sits at the table. He counts his breaths, trying to slow them.
“But, I mean, seriously.  Just the way you look at him sometimes, like the sun shines out his ass or something.” Sam makes a disgusted face. “Or how sometimes when you think I’m busy or too enthralled with something else, you’ll take him to the side, and you’ll just talk about stuff.  Not stuff about the case we’re working or any potential cases, but just...normal conversation. Like if he’d want to help you make dinner when we got back to the bunker or if he’d want to go to a Zeppelin concert with us if we were ever in the right place at the right time.”
“Do you remember in Purgatory...how we couldn’t build a fire?  So we wouldn’t be hunted any faster,” Cas asks, when Dean follows him into his room.
Dean dips his head and pulls at his collar self-consciously. “About me?” he asks after clearing his throat.
He has already lost Cas more times that he’s willing to think about. How many nights did he drink himself to sleep trying to drown out the loss then?  And that was before any of
The hunter can tell he is being stared at intently. “I remember you distinctly telling me, not but a few hours ago, that I still had a lot to learn in the way of hunting Winchester-style.”
Dean takes a moment to watch the shadow of Cas’s wings sweep across the bed as he hauls himself into a sitting position.  Cas looks over his shoulder back at him, a raised eyebrow asking
The gurney passes through a door, and everyone’s in a smaller room as they begin assessing Dean more closely.
By seven-thirty they are on the road, only two hundred miles separating them from the bunker.  The hole they trapped the rougarou in is probably still warm with leftover ashes.  The dashboard clock reads eleven-twenty when Dean parks the Impala in the carport.  Just after noon, and both men are sitting in the library, lunch sits between them, waiting to be finished.
Dean has no words for what he’s feeling and wouldn’t begin to have enough to tell Cas what he should.
He jots a couple notes down and they head up to the third and final floor, where there’s less commotion.  Must mean there’s less of a crime scene up here.
“Dean,” Sam laughs, “go fucking finish your game of pool, if you’re not too drunk. You sound like an asshole right now.”
Thank you everyone for reading, seriously, y'all are amazing and wonderful and I don't even know what else, you're just that spectacular!
A tense couple minutes follows before Cas huffs in frustration.  He picks up the pot he threw and puts it on the counter before walking down the hall.
Cas straightens up, holding his head higher. “I suspect there’s angel involvement with the Lincoln case.  I feel it is only right that I go there.”
“Castiel, you are needed presently,” reverberates inside his head.  He pauses for a moment, shakes his head in an all-too-human impulse, and resumes folding jeans.  It’s not the first time he’s heard the call of Heaven, he’s been evading the requests ever since his grace regained full ability and power a few months after he got it back.
The next thing the angel knows, Dean is kneeling beside him, cupping the back of his neck as a smile stretches his face in a way Cas hasn’t seen in too long.
“I have a confession.” Cas is still sitting at the table, suddenly interested in the pattern on the paper cup.
The rest of the night begins blurring together.  Their hips turned towards each other but barely touching, Cas’s movements still delicate compared to Dean’s.  His leg slips between Cas’s thighs every now and again, before he steps back, indicating he’s going to get a drink.  He finishes off three more glasses of bourbon, and his hips are in control now. Cas is closer to Dean this time, their bodies finally moving in sync, but Dean’s too nervous to look into his eyes.
The music gets louder as the song continues, Dean can’t hear anything but the singer’s voice from the stereos and he’s grateful.  It means he doesn’t have to try and have a conversation with Cas. The song switches to something with a heavier drum.  Finally, Dean gathers enough courage, or maybe the bourbon finally kicked in, and turns to Cas, his hips and shoulders still in time with the song.  Cas’s awkwardly standing next to him still, bobbing his head slightly, off from the beat of the music.  Dean sighs.  Cas notices the staring and turns to him.  Dean grabs his tie and pulls him closer; Cas stumbles against him, catching himself on the hunter’s shoulder. Once Dean’s undone his tie, he shoves it into his back pocket.  He undoes the top couple buttons of Cas’s shirt, spreading it to reveal his collarbones.
Dean looks up, his eyes begging Cas not to make him say whatever it is he is going to say next.  Cas doesn’t give in, his arms still crossed; he tilts his head, still waiting.
“And, I mean, c’mon,” Sam says, arching an eyebrow at him, “The way you fought for his grace, the way would wouldn’t give up on him.  At one point, even I thought he was a lost cause, he was not in his right mind and we felt nowhere close to finding his grace. But you wouldn’t give up on him, you would never stop fighting for him.  And, I mean, really, the way you would sit outside that door pining for him most days.” Sam snorts. “It was pathetic, dude, you were completely lost in him.”
At this, Castiel turns and begins to stride away, gathering his grace so he can return to the bunker.
“Sometimes at night, you’d press yourself into me.  You thought I was asleep— and I used to think you were too. Some reflex to finding warmth on those cold nights.  But you’d keep doing it, even when it got hot, on those sweltering nights.  Still, I’d stir awake to find your back pressed to my chest or your chest against my shoulder.”
It’s not that Cas doesn’t know how to give Dean time or space or just sit there when he’s having a bad day.  But those days when his shame hits the tipping point or his guilt overrides any other emotion or his memories are remembered too sharply, Cas can’t empathize with.  Some human emotions still fly over his head, not able to comprehend the shame that comes with actions, desires, or thoughts.  Sure he feels his own guilt for the mistakes he’s made in the grand scheme of trying to fix Heaven and Earth, the mistakes involving Dean’s trust, but never has he been ashamed to feel for Dean the way he does.  He wasn’t there for a large portion of Dean’s life, the most defining years, he was stuck in Heaven watching over but never interfering.  He likes to think that if he interacted sooner, Dean would not have to experience a fraction of the fear or self-consciousness he now feels day to day, sometimes overwhelming him.
“Cas. Cas, dude, I told you, neither Sam or I cares what you did.  It's behind us now, you moping about it isn’t going to change the fact that it happened.” It’s then that Dean actually realizes he grabbed Cas’s hand. And is still holding it.
“I was entrusted to watch the human race for millenias; I know without a shadow of a doubt I would not hesitate to spend the rest of my remaining days on Earth.”
He nudges Sam out of the way, to fix my own tie. Dean quirks my eyebrow at him, a silent question he understands.
He sits quietly, still thinking about the feather, pressing his knee solidly against Cas’s, trying to think of something to say.  Nothing seems right, no words mean enough. Spending Christmas with Cas and Sam, no apocalypse looming over their heads, is more than Dean could have wished for.
Dean tries to stay calm as his entire body ignites.  He is entirely consumed. Between his legs, his dick throbs so much it aches as he lets Cas set the pace.  He has to lean his forehead between Cas’s shoulder blades and close his eyes, so he doesn’t completely lose it right now.
Dean stirs awake just as the recording finishes, and Cas turns off the device, putting it down so he can turn around and look at Dean.
●	The Mark of Cain subplot is thrown out the window (this has nothing to do with how it was a horrible, poorly planned, careless plot by the writers, with a less than ideal solution)
“Soup. Lisa used to make it when Bed had a big exam at school.”  Dean looks up at Cas but he can’t read the expression in his eyes.
Dean doesn’t make a sound but he bites his jaw, overwhelmed.  He knows exactly what it is without ever seeing one before.
Angrily, the angel flips on to his back, cursing the ceiling and heavens above him.  His grace slowly finds its way to his surface, licking at the edges of his vessel searching to heal.
He scratches at his jaw, over two week’s worth of stubble taken up home there.  He can’t meet his own eyes right now, but if that bags under them are any sort of indicator, he’s dead.
he won’t be able to control himself. Cas impatiently fucks back, making the most debauched sound yet as he starts a steady grind on Dean’s fingers. Dean, on the other hand, is in shock, gripping tight to Cas’s thigh as he’s watching his other hand move in time with Cas’s ass.
Half an hour of no speaking, of Cas soaking himself in his shame, and Dean can’t take it anymore.  He punches the stereo off again and grabs Cas’s hand, pulling it onto his thigh. This capture’s the angel’s attention instantly.
He opens his mouth to speak but doesn’t, and licks his lips before he finally replies, “I’ll wait outside.”  That’s not what he was originally going to say but the angel is glad that he will wait.
The angel is staring at their connection, still resting on Dean’s thigh. “I will make it up to you, Dean.” It’s a whisper.  A promise.
The pot crashes into the wall as Cas throws it across the room, hollow echoes ringing as it falls to the ground.  Dean can’t remember the last time he’s seen Cas— there’s just no other word for it— livid.
. Cas stands as calm as usual next to Dean, surveying the display of donuts next to the counter. He doesn’t seem any different from yesterday, like nothing happened last night.  Like it wasn’t a big deal.
Dean coughs again, the truth seeming to erode his throat in its efforts to escape his lips. “Uh, Cas.  Cas, Sam and I were scared.” He doesn’t want to say why but he has to. “Scared of you.”
“Cas, stop,” Dean breathes, his throat raw like he’s been screaming. “Stop.”  He can’t look Cas in the eye, instead focusing on the spot he knows the Enochian is tattooed on his ribs.
Cas leads the way back to the motel, and in Dean’s stupor he swears he’s taking the long way there.  The angel will stop sometimes and look up at the sky, to let the hunter catch up to him or catch his breath. Navigating the roads and sidewalks from the motel was hard enough with the crowds, but now that it’s later and there are less people, a drunken Dean finds it just as difficult.
Cas laughs, Dean’s insistence comes off hilariously as he crouches naked over top Cas. “Yeah, the shortest Winchester I know!”
One day Castiel would have to answer to Heaven, he always knew it.  He just doesn’t expect it to be so soon.
“The other angels,” he breathes, sounding as if he woke up, but Dean knows he didn’t sleep. “I went higher in heaven, looking for angels who might have knowledge of how to translate
“Dean?” The hunter flips the page in the book, trying to hold onto reality. “I want to remove my grace.”  Another page, and another, and another…  He keeps flipping pages, as if he’ll find the answer to Cas’s
of this is your fault— how many times do I have to remind you?  Metatron was going to find a way to seal off Heaven no matter what!  And you already tried to help those dicks once!  They turned their backs on you once they realized you didn’t have the answers they were looking for!  You don’t owe them
"That doesn't even matter." Cas looks weary well beyond this conversation. "I tried to understand, Dean, this thing we are doing." Dean's stomach twists at the use of
Another victim was some electrician that just got laid off his job for drug abuse.  He lived with his daughter as he was supposedly going through AA and rehab, trying to get his life back together so that his wife would let him back in the house.  He had never missed a meeting, determined to get better, so that’s when they knew something was wrong.
He trips over cables connecting to a stage, barely registering the sidewalk coming closer to his face.  He never hits it. Cas has his arm around his waist and slings Dean’s over his own shoulders.
“You can’t work in the field anymore then.”  Dean knows it’s a low blow but it’s the only argument he can think of at this point.  His brain is shutting down, quick; panic setting in.  It’s fight or flight time, and his body’s forgetting everything but how to argue with Cas.
Dean starts before Cas can even really begin, “Don’t start that, Cas, okay.  This—” he gestures to his body in the hospital bed— “is what I signed up for.  I’m a hunter, this is what the job entails, nothing more than what I’m used to.  I’ve had far worse from far eviler.  Don’t you try and blame yourself for this.  You can’t save me from everything, Cas, though god knows you try.” Cas works his jaw furiously, trying to figure out what to say. “Don’t say anything, Cas, okay?  You don’t need to.” Dean reaches up to grasp Cas’s hand on his shoulder, looking down at it for a moment. “You didn’t fill out any of that paperwork yet, did you?”
Dean’s not sure what makes him do it, but once he spots the stationary shop on the corner, he’s getting out and walking towards it.
“I swear, you only drink that light shit to piss me off,” Dean laughs. Trying to forget about everything that’s been making his stomach somersault the past hour.  And beer and football will most certainly help with that.
And just like that, the rest of the day progresses in unexpected normalcy. Cas heads directly to the library when they get back to the bunker, muttering something about new cases. That leaves Dean to get stuff ready for tonight.  They left Lincoln later than he expected, having to track the mother down at her job. So now there’s only an hour left before the game starts and Sam should be arriving around that time, with the beer Dean requested.
He does this to everyone he’s ever know.  He pushes and pushes and pushes until they’re gone and there’s no resisting force because they
Dean can feel Cas’s squinted eyes boring through him. “What aren’t you telling me, Dean?” he asks, his voice rough like gravel.
One night he’s lying under the window as Dean did when he first brought him here.  Staring up at the stars, looking for the ones he visited so long ago.
Forcefully, he grabs the skull between his heads, and despite knowing it will have no effect now, flares his grace.
By the time Cas pulls up to the bunker’s carport, he has one recording left.  Both excitement and anxiety pool in his stomach as he thinks of Sam’s insight, advice, and comfort coming to an end.
though.  In the middle of the night, Sam fast asleep in the next bed, while Cas is online researching on the edge of Dean’s bed, the hunter shoves his cold toes under the angel’s thigh.  Cas tells them about the cases he found the previous night, but Sam notes they should stay focused on this case and Dean has to agree.  Cas gives Dean a perturbed glare as he walks out of the motel room. The rougarou is camped in an abandoned barn next to a chicken farm and he’s easy enough to corner and burn. Cas throws Dean another glance as they’re walking away from the smoke, and the hunter gives in, asking if Sam wants to take a look at those cases now.
