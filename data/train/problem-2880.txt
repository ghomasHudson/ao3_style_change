Castiel climbs further up the ladder until Dean can feel his breath on his lower back. "Cas," Dean warns. "What are you doing?" Castiel chuckles, moving his hands further up Dean's legs, feeling the outline of his muscles out of curiosity for how they tense the higher he reaches. "What do you want me to do Dean?" He purrs.
. The angel leans over him purposely avoiding touching him just teasing him with the infinite 'what ifs' as he hooks his finger under the collar of Dean's shirt, pulling it down and pressing a slow and gentle kiss to his collarbone. Dean gasps, his hands trying to move only to realize he's being held down. "Cas? Wha-" The angel avoids the question instead choosing to place his tie in Deans' mouth to stop him from speaking.
"Hell if I know..." Sam frowns deep in thought, his forehead creasing as he looks over the photos. Dean puts Sam's phone back on to the table staring at it trying to piece this case together.
He doesn't recognise the voice and doesn't dare to look over the shelving. The voice acts like a siren tempting him to show himself as the angel's grace dominates the room, trying to suffocate him.
"Dean what's going on?" Sam stands up from where he was sat on his bed as Dean walks through the motel door. His brother rolls his eyes, not bothering to slow his stride across the room. "Dude since when did you become my wife?" Dean reaches under the bed, grabbing at thin air until his hand connects with the handles of his duffel and he throws it on top of his bed. Sam crosses his arms over his chest frowning, as Dean smirks to himself at how Sam just proved his point of acting like a nagging wife. Sam must realise what Dean's thinking because he quickly unfolds his arms and throws Dean a very stern bitch face. "Samantha, I've told you," Dean sighs. "We're going to Bobby's."
After the initial shock of Castiel revealing his true identity, everyone around them jumps into action making themselves look busy as they run around aimlessly picking up pieces of paper and typing numbers into phones. Until eventually it's just Castiel and Dean. "Dude your boner is showing."
Throwing him onto the floor as his restless tossing and turning sends him over the edge of his small motel bed. The sudden impact stuns him for a moment, the transition from nightmare to reality too abrupt for his mind to process. Dean automatically reaches for a weapon but falls back into reality before he can close his hands around one.
Dean glances up at Bobby through his eyelashes in order to gauge his reaction but Bobby's face has gone blank. He quickly looks away thinking of a way to take his question back when Bobby's hand rests on his shoulder. Dean tries not to flinch too hard at the contact when Bobby squeezes his shoulder and he finally looks up. "Boy, there is
In one practised move he pulls the flask of holy oil out of his pocket, flipping the lid back and throwing it forwards. His hand reaches out, his grace curving the direction of the flask. The flask spins in a circle around Uriel's feet, the liquid pouring out. A flash of panic shows on Uriel's face as the click of Bobby's lighter sounds from behind him. Dean uses his grace to pin the angel on the spot and then Bobby throws it forwards and the oil enlights. The flames curve around him before fully setting ablaze casting an orange hue around the room.
The whole crowd cheers and screams throwing one dollar bills on to the stage. Dean rolls his hips until he has turned sideways towards the row of men. He grabs the first dancer to his right and starts grinding against him and slides his hands over the man's chest, gaining an even bigger reaction from the crowd.
They reach the double-doors at the end of the corridor without an incident. Dean keeps his eyes trained on the floor like Castiel had told him to as nurses hurriedly move around the ward with a serene purposefulness. He pulls his eyes from the highly polished floor for only a second to catch a glimpse of the hallway that stretches beyond, cut into tiny squares by the thin wire in the window panels.
"Your brother's not with you." The redhead says it as if she's only just realised that there isn't another body in the room and watches Dean suspiciously. "Where is he?" She asks, glowering down at him. Dean scowls at her for mentioning Sam and automatically looks around himself to check on his brother even though he's not in the room. If they know about him and Sam then they know Sam's going to be on his way, if not here already, and that completely removes any element of surprise from Dean's escape plan. Sam barging in on his own without a plan is never going to happen, he may be Deans brother but he sure as hell doesn't have Deans idiotic mindset, so if the witches are waiting for his brother then at least it will give him some more time. A shrill of anxiety crawls up Dean's spine at the thought of Sam being ambushed but he quickly pushes it down and throws on his best grin.
He leaned over and lightly lapped it up with his tongue. Cas bucked up, trying to enter Dean’s warm moist mouth, and his hands came down to grip Dean’s short hair. Dean savored Cas’s flavor for a second before wanting more but he also wanted to see the reaction in Cas’s eyes when he did.
They called it an early night and headed home but Dean made Cas swing by and pick up Alfie. Alfie got the bed while Cas and Dean took turns keeping the nightmares away. Dean managed to make Cas take the couch and rest for a little while which made Cas fall asleep. Dean left him there and took over the nightmare watch, knowing Cas had to work while Dean could sleep after Alfie went to school.
The sheriff and others who had gathered around all smirked or just shook their heads, knowing that Dean was right. Dean laid it on a little thicker as he warned easily, “I’m not helping you dig this either. Got some seriously bruised ribs from that night and I seriously doubt I should be doing something that strenuous with them.”
Why Dean was checking Cas out now, he had no idea. Dean never really looked at Cas that way because he still was not gay. But he watched the women all turn their eyes toward Cas as he entered the room and Dean could definitely tell that Cas was probably what they considered attractive. Dean was nowhere close to gay but he knew that Cas was definite competition for Dean.
Cas stared at Dean during the recital then switched to Alfie at the end. He could tell Alfie was about to lose it. The problem was that Cas wasn’t even sure about what he saw and he obviously missed some. “When the hell did you get thrown into a wall, Dean?”
“Talk,” Dean ordered, knowing somehow that it was Cas. “Don’t tell me that you miss me already. Who knew you were so needy?”
“Which means,” Dean interpreted dryly, “he said that you followed in his footsteps and took the dare to enter the old witch’s house. Now he’s bringing you home. The folks will smell the alcohol well enough, or not, as the case may be.”
Dean shook his head and snapped out of it. “I’m good. You can’t use me to get out of this, short stuff,” Dean warned with amusement.
Dean shot his eyes back over to Cas and couldn’t help noticing Cas’s groin swelling again. Dean smiled widely and commented, “You know, with the limited room we already have, you don’t need to get any bigger.” Cas grinned widely as his cock filled more under Dean’s interested stare. Dean gave a put upon sigh and grumbled playfully, “Guess I have to something about that, huh? You know, since you won’t.” Dean ignored the fact that his own cock had woken back up and was now swelling too.
“Let you drive my truck, looking like that? Yeah, right, what are you drinking?” Cas snarked lightly. “In fact, you have to ride in the back, Pig Pen. I’ll drop you off so that you can rest your ribs after you shower. We still have a game to win tomorrow, remember? And some of the guys want to practice tonight so move your ass, pretty boy.”
“I mean,” Cas moaned and thrashed as Dean kept pumping and twisting Cas’s cock slowly. “What we are doing. . . shouldn’t it feel . . . weird, or, you know, wrong? You know, strange? Oh, God. Yeah, De, like that. Oh, God, yes.”
Dean knew the moment Cas appeared behind him, though he hadn’t moved a muscle. He closed his eyes and took another deep breath, and then turned around. Cas was standing there, a few feet away, just as he had been a million times before. He was wearing blue jeans and a black hoodie. It seemed finally he’d retired the trench coat. Dean’s mouth ran dry.
“Hello Dean.” Cas said, and Dean’s body was moving before he knew what was happening. He grabbed Cas tight and pulled him close, burying his face in his neck. He felt Cas’ hands wrap around his waist, and they took a moment to just stand there together.
“Took it upon yourself to die two weeks after I saved you?” Cas finished. He’d said it almost playfully, but Dean could hear frustration in his voice as well.
They stayed wrapped up in each other for a while longer, it could've been minutes or years. Dean wasn’t counting. He finally stepped back and grabbed Cas’ hand, pulling him towards the side of the Roadhouse where Bobby had told him Baby was parked. And then there she was, looking the same as she always had, and Dean felt his heart swell again. He thought he couldn’t love Cas anymore than he did, but he’s been wrong before.
He made it around the front of the building and stopped short. He recognized it as Harvelle’s Roadhouse, and sitting in a rocking chair on the wooden porch was Bobby. He had a beer in his hand and looked healthier than Dean ever remembered him looking. Bobby looked over at him and smiled.
The first thing Dean noticed was the warmth of the sun on his face. His eyes were closed, his mind still trying to shake off the brief blackness of
“It wasn’t on purpose. You know that.” Dean said. Cas’ mouth slid into a smile and Dean’s heart expanded with it.
“Can you stay? Will you stay there with me?” Dean asked. He was done not asking for what he wanted. The time for hesitancy had long passed. But even still, he felt like he was laying his heart bare, handing it over to Cas, asking him to take care of it.
“Oh,” he said, his hand on the door handle. Dean looked up at him. “Your Baby’s parked around the side. Cas did his best to remake it from memory. It’s a damn good copy if you ask me.” And then he stepped inside.
Eventually they pulled back, both of them gasping for air, although a voice in the back of Dean’s mind told him they didn’t need it anymore. Cas rested his forehead against Dean’s and met his eyes with a smile that glowed brighter than the sun. Dean was sure that if he wasn’t already dead that smile would’ve killed him on the spot. He couldn’t do anything but smile back.
“Heya, Dean. Come sit. Have a beer.” Bobby said with a smile, nodding at the empty chair next to him. Dean was still trying to place all this in his memory but he just couldn’t. Something in him registered that maybe this wasn’t a memory after all. Dean sat down and the chair and another beer appeared out of thin air next to him on the table.
“Jack did some remodeling. It was the second thing he did when he took over. No more being stuck in memories. No more loops. Jack knew this place had just been a shinier version of hell for a long time, so he fixed it. He visits sometimes.” Bobby said, and Dean felt pride swell in his chest. He’d known Jack was good. He’d known Jack would do right by humanity, even if he was “hands-off” as he promised he’d be.
“How?” Dean asked, looking over at Bobby. He had an idea, but it seemed too good to be true. Bobby grinned again.
“You know it is, kid. You have to feel it.” Bobby replied. And he was right. Dean did feel the peace of this place. The divineness seeping out of everything.
that he could probably recognize him anywhere. Dean had spent so long ignoring what that meant for him. But, he’d had had a lot of time to think after Cas died, and had finally come to the conclusion that he’d been very stupid for a very long time. Now he had the chance to fix it.
. He remembered dying. Remembered Sam staying with him until the end. Remembered the nail in his back. He didn’t feel sad or angry about it, although maybe he should. He’d fought angels and demons and God himself, but a wrong step and a rusty nail was what had gotten him in the end. There had to be a joke in there somewhere. Still, he wasn’t upset about dying, it was just something that happened, and now he was here.
“Yes, I know that. Doesn’t mean I can’t still give you shit for it.” Cas teased, and Dean thought it couldn’t get any better than this. He would be content to just stand here and talk to Cas for the rest of eternity. But there was something he needed to say.
“Come on. Let’s drive. I wanna see the rest of heaven.” He said and climbed in. Cas opened the passenger door and slid in next to him. Dean grabbed his hand, tangling their fingers together and pressing his lips to the back of Cas’ hand. The car started with a mere thought and Dean pulled out onto the dirt road.
Cas’ eyes brightened, “If you want me to, I’ll stay. Anything Dean, anything you want I’ll give you. Forever.”
“You asshole,” Dean said finally, his voice slightly hysterical. He pulled back to look at Cas. “How dare you die on me like that. You were just gone and I-”
“Heaven don’t work like that anymore,” Bobby said with a grin. “This isn’t a memory. It’s a whole new world up here now. Everyone you’ve ever loved will show up here eventually. You’re free up here to live out eternity however you want to.”
“But I do, Cas.” Dean said firmly. “Listen to me. I panicked when you said that. Death was literally knocking at the door and then you were saying goodbye like you meant it this time. Then you said you loved me and I was trying to get my mind around that. Around how an
“I don’t remember this memory, though. I was never here in this place with you.” Dean said, taking a drink of the beer. The familiarity of the bitterness sliding down his throat made him feel 16 years old again.
, Cas, could love me, the guy who regularly gets drunk on gas station beer and can’t seem to stop fucking things up. And then you were gone and I couldn’t-” He stopped and took a deep breath.
“I didn’t know what to do after that. I sat around the bunker for days, trying to think of what I would say to you if I got one more chance.” Dean stepped closer and laid a hand on Cas’ cheek. Cas’ eyes widened and Dean let a small smile slip through.
Dean let that sink in for a moment. Free wasn’t really something he’d ever considered himself to be. There had always been someone he was supposed to be fighting or protecting. Something he was supposed to be doing. He hadn’t truly been free in a very long time, if ever. He took another drink.
He opened his eyes to see where here was. He stood on a dirt road surrounded by forest. He could see mountains in the distance. The air was clear and fresh and he took a deep breath, feeling his lungs expand. He tried to place what memory this was, what memory heaven thought happy enough to drop him into for eternity, but he couldn't. Maybe dying and getting resurrected so many times before had messed with his memory. He wouldn’t be surprised. He turned around, and found he was standing behind a wooden building. He really didn’t remember this happening in his life. He moved toward the front of the building, surprised to find the stiffness of his joints that had come with age and fighting monsters for a living was gone. He felt better than he had for years. He knew heaven was supposed to be an escape from pain and suffering, but he had never really considered joint pain to be on the no entry list.
. And he’d helped build this place. If Dean focused hard enough, he thought he could almost feel Cas in the energy of everything here. He’d spent so long tuned into Cas’
“That’s … um. That’s good.” Dean said, trying not to meet Bobby’s eyes. He guessed that Bobby probably knew, but he wasn’t quite ready to face that head on yet. Bobby let out a short laugh.
“You know I designed this part of heaven for you.” Cas said quietly. His nose brushed Dean’s and Dean’s eyes fluttered closed.
"You?" Dean says just shy of hysterical looking over at his brother. "Didn't you say I would have to have sex with this person! Well, I'm sorry Sam but I'm not recreating one of those freaky fanfictions." Sam's upper lip curls in disgust and he waves his hand in the air. "No! We're not recreating anything! Anyway, I don't think it's me." Sam yells quickly to stop his brother from going any further.
"John knew about angels?" Bobby shrugs. "He knew enough to keep you safe. The less you know the less likely you are to seek them out." He says pointedly. Dean ducks his head. Bobby's properly right, Bobby's always right, he'd go searching for the supernatural the moment he heard about them. Unlike John who continued life like normal. He wonders how the hell his dad did it.
He hears his brother giggle downstairs and the thought alone makes him drop the pen in his hand. Dean looks to the door. He could...
"You know?" Dean barely manages to get the words out and once they're in the air he wants to take them back. Bobby knows about John, about how he treated Dean. The constant abuse, the hidden beatings, Dean's body aching with bruises. Bobby's arms wrap slightly tighter around him and he sighs.
To say Castiel was pissed off would be an understatement. If the swift right hook he serves Dean is anything to go by then he is just over the edge of furious. Sam had decided to call the angel in hope of getting healed quickly and painlessly but by the looks of things he has more chance of catching bullets before he gets Castiel's attention. Sam watches in amusement as Dean tries to plead with him about whether or not he deserved to be punched in the face but the younger brother doesn't get involved. Being soccer punched by an angel would probably obliterate him at this point.
Bobby pulls away from the hug to get a better look at Dean, still gripping his shoulders with a comforting hold. "Where'd you think boy? I've been searching for you and your brother ever since I heard you got in that accident."
Bobby hands over the gun with care, arranging Dean's hands so that he is holding it properly. Bobby pulls his hands into position, high on the grip. "First, always use your dominant hand, best stability, better aim." Dean twitches his last two fingers around the base of the grip his ring finger resting on the trigger. Bobby manhandles his hands again. "Shooting finger should never be on the trigger unless you're aiming and going to shoot." He grumbles. "Index, middle, ring and pinky, on the other hand, should be around the base and your other hand. There. Now you have balance." He nudges the end of the gun. "Loosen your grip a bit, it needs to be firm but don't be afraid of it."
Flashes of blood-stained faces, screams, and broken bones batter his mind. The memory of being trapped inside a car for hours on end without being able to move, hanging onto the edge of life. The taste of copper floods his mouth and if he closes his eyes for a second too long he's back there under the weight of his dead parent.
After seeing and being repeatedly hugged by everyone in the room Dean ends up back where he started, standing next to Sam the only difference being this time he's leaning against a bar and has a beer in his hand. "Dude I'm pretty sure my face is going to start cracking if I keep this up any longer." Dean slumps against the bar massaging his jaw as it practically crumbles in his efforts to speak. Sam grins at his brother noticing his worn out expression. "Oh, so you're having fun?" Sam chuckles when Dean lets out a puff of air as an attempt to laugh.
Jimmy smirks lifting Dean's top and kneeling down still rubbing his hand up and down the length of Dean's cock. He trails kisses down Dean's stomach gently licking the base of his penis. Dean shudders gripping the man's hair, it's stiff and difficult to get a good hold of.
He locks his eyes on the dead, black holes in the demons head and jabs his palm under her chin. She reels back, releasing her grip. Dean half turns and half steps back, toward the door, a fluid quarter circle, but before he can make to run towards it two demons move towards him, faster than he's moving, ready to grab him.
Castiel places himself on to the slippery bar stool with its glazed and sleek outline. His position shifts uncomfortably against the wobbly seat.
Not again, he can't be abandoned again. Not now. The fear sits on him like a pillow over his mouth and nose. Enough air gets by it, allowing his body to keep functioning, but it's crippling all the same. His grace is screaming at him now, trying to get out, his legs go weak, his stomach lurches.
He stumbles down the corridor, searching his pockets for his phone as tripping up gets pretty old after the first ten times and tries to navigate his way down the corridor when he hears some familiar voices.
Bobby tuts as he walks over to them, pulling his jacket on. "We better get going, it's gonna be a long drive." Ellen laughs, rolling her eyes.
He knew this day couldn't go the way he and Lisa had wanted it to, something always went wrong. Dean sighs, trying to catch Sams attention but Sam avoids him, glancing around the room instead.
"Sam, I'm fine, let's just go!" Dean opens the door and walks out to throw the duffels into the Impala. Sam sighs and stands up from his seat, walking over to the bookcase near Bobby's desk and picking up the keys to the Impala just as Dean walks back through the door. "Keys." Dean holds out his hand and Sam shakes his head. "No way, if you want this case then I'm driving." He dangles the keys on his index finger and they rattle together harshly, forcing Dean to swallow down his argument and instead scowl and stomp back outside with a murmur of, "Hurry up." to his younger brother.
"What the hell?" He shouts stepping forwards with an accusing tone. "You ask me for help but refuse to give me one thing! If you can heal me then you can heal Sam as well." Dean turns his back on the light, brushing his hand through his hair and resisting the urge to pull it. He spins around on his heels and crosses his arms over his chest. "You will help him! Or-or I'm not helping you."
Castiel's hand grasps his wrist the moment he stands, preventing him from taking another step. "Dean." His face has been schooled into a neutral expression and if anything that just breaks Dean's heart further. It's not the same as before the betrayal he felt towards Castiel at least he actually had something to blame Castiel for, a reason that Castiel was at fault. But this time he can't blame him because Castiel has done nothing wrong, it's Dean. "Dean it's okay." Dean tries to pull away but it's useless. He doesn't try very hard.
Apparently, the tourism is at an all-time low today, which Sam assumes is because of the deaths, so the queue is short, which means fewer people and easier ways to sneak off from the tour so at least their job is a bit more straightforward. Although Dean doubts the people around them are the type to do a full up investigation if two strangers were to wander off from the tour, it's just easier to decreases the number of witnesses they have to lie too if the plan goes sideways.
Sighing, Bobby stands and walks over to the kitchen counter pulling out a knife. "Bobby, what are you-?" Bobby shushes him with a wave of his hand and grabs the edge of a picture hanging on the wall, lifting it from its hook and placing it on the floor. Behind the picture reveals a sigil that looks like a compass and an upside-down 'G'. Dean's eyes widen at the sight as he can see stains of red that have dripped down the wall and quickly realises its blood.
Dean rubs his forehead and pulls a face as he pushes the blanket away from him. "Dude, what the hell happened?" His voice is scratchy like it hasn't been used in weeks and he swallows to get rid of the dry taste. Sam passes him a glass of water and watches him as he drinks the cup in a few quick sips. When Dean passes the cup back to his brother Sam noticeably relaxes before tensing again and responding irritably. "You were almost killed, remember?" Dean stares at Sam -Almost killed?- Oh yeah witches, before nodding. "Yeah, yeah I remember. How did you get me here anyway?" Sam's eyes flicker behind the bed and Dean follows it past the puke green carpet to a grey recliner that's been covered with a beige trench coat and suit jacket in between the two bed's. "Cas?"
"Then... why have you come here? It wasn't just to see us." Dean tears his eyes away from Castiel's to look at Jo but he doesn't miss the flash of hurt that crosses her face. He knows that hurt isn't just because he didn't come just to visit her. He sees it reappear when she looks at Castiel. He knows it because it's exactly how he felt looking at Castiel and that woman.
Dean fails to cover up the shiver that shakes his body at the warm breath on his back as Castiel's hands make their way further up Dean's body. They barely skim over Dean's clothed nipples but the simple spark of contact has his hips jerking forwards with a muffled moan. Even while he's trying to hide it his moan still echoes vibrating off the walls and back to Castiel. Castiel smirks. "Excited are we Dean?" Dean tries to slap Castiel's hands away and the man easily obliges instead moving his hands to massage at the muscle of Dean's ass. "Cas," He hisses, tensing under the touch. "Stop-ah!" He jumps as teeth sink into the flesh of his thigh. Castiel's breath lingers in the space between his legs, sending splinter like pleasure to his groin.
Dean purses his lips. "What do you mean gone? Where'd he go?" Bobby shrugs as he pulls out a chair and sits down. "Pulled a disappearing act on me. He ditched the truck and left the guns in the trunk without leaving a note or a text, I can't even get a reply out of him now." Dean glances at Castiel hoping for some kind of explanation. "Is it possible he just got cold feet? I don't know maybe didn't wanna get caught with a load of guns?"
Sam groans in frustration and scrubs a hand over his face. Dean knows what's coming next, of the 'I-know-things-are-difficult-so-lets-talk' voice, now it's part two: 'I-didn't-mean-to-say-that'. "Sam just stop. It's not happening. We're finishing this case and moving on." Dean scowls at his brother, taking a long swig of beer as he turns his glare to nothing in particular.
Sam can't contain the sigh that leaves him as he sits down in the booth and he doesn't contain his surprise when Castiel sits down beside him. He frowns. "Cas? You alright?" Sam asks hesitantly. Castiel barely even glances at him and mumbles a quick, "Yes." before going back to staring at the table.
Sam follows his lead and leaps into action grabbing the closest weapon to him. Dean dodges an oncoming attack and stumbles as he once again thrusts his knife into the throat of another werewolf. He immediately picks himself up with little grace and rips his knife out of the neck of the wolf, flipping it around in his hand and holding it in a fierce grip. He hears two shots then a third and sees the wolves go down one by one from Sams side of the room. A sudden gush of pain jolts throughout Deans body as he's once again thrown to the side. Another broken bone.
"Nice party trick Cas." He says dryly. "What is it now? Have you come to lie to me again?" He asks. "Try to finish me off once and for all?"
Castiel looks affronted his eyebrows raising in surprise and Dean finally feels satisfaction as the angel shows an expression other than stoic. "No, Dean please-" Dean shakes his head.
It's been at least half an hour of Castiel ignoring the world around him and Deans boredom has been building with every second. Two days ago they returned to Bobby's and they've done nothing but research and Dean has barely even grasped the basics of his grace. Every time Castiel so much as looks at him his grace reacts and he can't control it. Dean bites the inside of his cheek, his fork tapping against his plate.
"Sorry." He murmurs and moves to check if Sam's in the hallway. When there's no sign of him Dean moves back and aims at the werewolf. "Honestly, you're doing me a favour. I'm dead anyway." He pulls the trigger.
"Which means-" He grunts as he stretches his arm out straining to reach the lump. The wall presses against his face and chest, he sucks in a deep breath and his hand slips forwards enough to grab onto the lump and pull it from the leg. Dean leans back scanning the object in his hand. It's a thin strip of wood, rounded at the top cut from a different type of wood and forced inside the leg. Everyone in the room leans forwards their curiosity getting the better of them but not wanting to disturb the atmosphere of the room. Dean spins the wood in his hand until he notices an ever so faint carving in the side reading 'Down'.
In seconds the bliss evaporates and adrenaline floods his system. He feels as if his heart will explode and his eyes are wide with fear. His heart pumps and beats like it's trying to escape. Anxiety and fear grab him by the tongue and dry his mouth.
"I won't be the one to kill him. If he doesn't die you're stuck like this. Fighting the beast inside until you lose control and it locks you in your subconscious." Dean freezes. "I bet you're wondering why you can't control your grace. Why you can't control the need to expel violence. You see your grace will amplify your soul. And your soul is dark and damaged."
Dean barely swallows down his anger and embarrassment. He and Castiel watch each other, neither one moving. Bobby must be starting dinner downstairs he can hear the clatter of pans coming from the kitchen. "Dean we need to talk about what happened in that diner."
Bobby nods at him, giving him the go-ahead. Dean hesitates. "Don't anticipate the shot." He says. "Only focus on aiming and technique." Dean breathes in slowly, aiming. He pulls the trigger. The first shot echoes across the wide landscape like the sound of lightning hitting the ground. The bullet slices through the air missing the target by at least ten inches as it lands in a tree just behind. Dean frowns. Bobby slaps him on the back with a smile. "Not bad," He nods. "Better than your dad was." Dean's eyes widen. "Dad knew how to shoot?"
Dean smirked wryly at the generous offer, wondering what he’d ever done to deserve that. “We’ll see. You never told me what was up. You know. Why you’re calling?”
“Thank you,” Cas says, his voice pitched low and sincere. He seems grateful for the reassuring contact, but his eyes are already sliding back towards Dean. “We’ll see you then.”
Dean tugs petulantly on Sam’s jacket, breathing starting to get more difficult. Punctured lung? Maybe. If it was collapsed, he’s pretty sure he’d know. “Hey. Hey, asshole,
Dean gulps, his brain finally catching up with him. “I, uh. I love you. This morning was— and, uh, last night—”
Cas doesn’t say anything back, so the conversation dies again. They just sit in silence, drinking their coffee and eating Dean’s pancakes. Well, Cas does most of the eating, actually, and isn’t that a fucking weird way for their usual dynamic to flip on its head. Dean’s pretty sure his appetite left the building somewhere between thinking Cas coming back was a dream and realizing he was probably dangerously short on Grace, and it hasn’t come back. There are too many things swirling around in his head for him to be hungry right now.
because it was a wild goose chase and I couldn’t take any more dead ends. I’ve been taking care of my dog, and going on hunts with Sam, and acting like everything’s hunky-fucking-dory when all I wanted to do most days was crawl into my bed and
“Yes,” Cas says, his voice flat and sleep-rough, watching Dean. He has a pillow crease on his cheek.
Okay. Okay, he’s gonna have to do damage control, but it’s… it won’t be a walk in the park. Especially after what he said. He doesn’t remember exactly what it was, but shock and blood loss had loosened his lips. He’s pretty sure it was something along the lines of, “Hey, it’s okay, I don’t really mind dying.” Which isn’t gonna be easy to smooth over.
with all the emotions ripping through him. Cas goes absolutely still, staring at him with eyes the size of dinner plates. “I sat on the floor in that goddamn room and cried for an
“Not Superman, huh?” Sam says, his face hard. “Then you don’t have to worry about kryptonite, do you?”
“You’re in danger,” he says urgently. Sam, Bobby, and Dean turn to look at him. “Crowley will send more demons. It might take him a few hours, but you need to get away from here. It’s not safe.”
It’s already mid-afternoon. His time is running out and he needs to make a decision, one way or the other.
Dean must… black out a little? Does weed do that to you? Because one moment he’s beside Cas and the next he’s in his lap. He’s not, uh. He’s not complaining, though.
Cas laughs softly and Dean looks over at him, grinning. He’s… he looks good. Cuddled up in a hoodie, his head tipped back so he can see the sky. He looks… calm. Happy.
“Right,” Sam bites out nastily, “well, I guess I can’t stop you from going by yourself, but I’m not taking you on any, and no one else will either. Because you’re not
Dean’s laughing as he thumps Cas soundly on the back, and Cas shoots him a displeased look as he wipes at his streaming eyes. “I don’t think I like that,” he says, and his voice is even rougher than usual. It scrapes pleasantly over Dean, drawing a tiny shiver out of him.
Charlie makes a soft noise in the back of her throat that could be assent or could be something else entirely. Dean doesn’t bother trying to parse what it means. His head hurts.
Cracking his eyelids open adds a whole ‘nother world of dimension to that last one, and the weak, greyish light of morning that’s trickling through his window leaves him feeling scraped out. Hollow. He runs a hand over his face, groaning softly as the déjà vu from a hundred mornings he’s woken up feeling exactly like this washes over him, and glances over at the old alarm clock, squinting painfully at the red numbers.
“How are you here?” Sam’s voice sounds strange in the night air, and he swallows. “Either of you? Jack, you said… you said you weren’t coming back. Ever.” Then he stiffens, concern crashing over him like a bucket of cold water. “Wait, is something wrong? Are you alright?”
Cas sinks down onto the couch like his knees have turned to water. He’s staring at Dean, so lost and shell-shocked and out of his depth that he’s as transparent as glass.
Cas doesn’t really look like he believes that. Dean sighs. “Look, man. It’s no picnic. It feels shitty. But I’ve had people look down on me for worse, and if anyone tries anything I know I can knock ‘em flat before they get two words out. Seriously, I’m fine.”
He still can’t help but hope that Cas’ answering smile — a little shy, a lot muted excitement — is because it’s Dean he gets to dance with.
It’s not that he doesn’t want Dean; hilariously, that’s the one thing Dean doesn’t doubt anymore. He still
“Dean?” Cas asks, because even tipsy he notices. He always notices. Dean grunts noncommittally, his eyes glued to the shoulder seam of Cas’ shirt. Cas stands still, and they’re not even dancing, they’re just standing here in the middle of a crowd of strangers, wrapped up in each other’s arms,
Cas shoots him a last, grateful look and then walks towards the living room, already dialling Claire’s number. He knew Dean’s passcode. Didn’t even hesitate.
or some bullshit. But there’s nothing wrong. I just want to get better and get back to hunting. Is that really so bad?”
Sam pauses as that sinks in, taking another drink to cover how little he likes it. Dean smirks, just a little, and finishes up his glass. He pours another one immediately. “I’m gonna keep drinking, so if you wanna get some coherent answers, you’d better pick up the pace.”
— right here, right now — feels more right than anything else he has done in the interminable, lonely months since he watched Dean rake leaves in Lisa Braeden’s yard. Right or wrong, blessing or blasphemy— he doesn’t care. Dean could punch him, could beat him bloody, and Cas wouldn’t raise a finger against him. He would deserve it. He— he wants to make things right. He’ll do whatever penance Dean asks of him. Anything.
He doesn’t move at all when the door creaks open behind him, doesn’t look over when Sam appears in his peripheral.
Dean’s brain is still out to lunch on emotions, though, so he’s not even that hopeful about that. He presses two fingers to the side of Cas’ neck instead: no pulse. His chest isn’t moving either. But that doesn’t mean anything. Angels don’t
Dean wanders over, a bag of chips in hand. He peers at the bear. “Jesus, Valentine’s Day shit already? It’s not even February yet.”
Once Sam’s safely in his room, and Dean’s safely in his, then he breaks out his godsend sleeping pills and passes out until the next morning. And then he does it all again.
They don’t even have their suitcases with them in the room yet. (“No one goes on vacation with their stuff in a couple of duffle bags, Dean. Just go with it.”) No, a
there’s a spark of anger in Sam’s eyes, in the way his mouth tightens at the corners. “I don’t know. You could talk to someone, that’s a start. I’m not gonna
Sam says exasperatedly. “You’ve been off all day. More off than usual, I mean, and this isn’t the first time. You think I can’t tell? God, Dean, you… if you don’t want to talk to me, fine. That’s
But lying here on his back in the tender light of morning, barely breathing so he doesn’t dislodge the hand Cas has resting on his chest, he gets it. He understands the urge to watch over someone. And he wishes now that he’d been a little less angry about telling Cas off about it, back when he used to wake up to an unwanted sentinel standing guard in the corner of whatever room he was in.
But his body is moving on autopilot, and he finds himself stepping into position with Cas even though he’s slowly working himself into a freak-out. Cas is— Cas is leading, one hand resting on the small of Dean’s back and the other clasped in his. Dean puts his free hand on Cas’ shoulder, but he’s in a weird kind of limbo, stiff and awkward while simultaneously wanting nothing more than to relax into the light pressure of Cas’ hand, to sway just a little too close and let their cheeks brush like it’s an accident.
The reality of what just happened starts to sink in, though, and Dean’s heart rate speeds up. And not in a good way. In a decidedly bad, ‘oh shit’ kinda way. He gulps.
Sam reaches out and rests a hand on Cas’ arm. “Alright. We’ll… we’ll come back tomorrow. I’ll text Dean.”
He brings the whole Valentine’s ad thing up again, though. He starts trying to explain, out of the blue, why it’d be weird for Cas to put something in there about him, and it quickly turns into the conversational equivalent of a car wreck. Sam couldn’t look away if he tried. Cas squints at Dean in confusion as he fumbles his way towards a convoluted point, flustered stuttering and erratic hand-waving everywhere. When his increasingly incoherent rambling finally peters off into an awkward, embarrassed silence, Cas abruptly changes the subject to ask Sam about a slight discrepancy between the witness’ stories. Dean, in the chair in the corner, crosses his arms and slumps down in his seat. The tips of his ears are red.
He picks up the pill bottle, staring down at the little white disc sitting forlornly inside. He’s… he’s so done with all of this. Either he takes this tonight to buy himself one more night of oblivion and the killer pseudo-hangover that comes with it, or he sucks it up and flushes this little fucker down the drain. He’s gonna have to deal with the host of nightmares his brain’s been saving up eventually, so what’s one more night of freedom? Might as well stop being a coward and just get it over with.
why. Raphael wants to free Michael and Lucifer, and I’m not strong enough to oppose him on my own, Dean. I’m trying to
Dean sets his jaw, heat gathering high on his cheekbones. “Don’t think just because we’re on the same side I won’t punch you in the fucking teeth.”
“If you’d like,” Lucifer rumbles, reaching out to brush his fingers against Dean’s. “I’m more than amenable.”
He looks up from the paper, taking his drink from the barista. “Thanks. Uh, would you mind if I took this?” he asks, giving the paper a little waggle. “I can pay for it.”
Dean snorts weakly, dropping his hand from his face. He doesn’t meet Cas’ eyes. “No, I’m definitely a jackass. And I dunno if that’s— if that’s the smart choice, man.” He stops for a moment, struggling. “Maybe… I think I’d deserve it, if you wanted— if you wanted to leave,” he finishes in a whisper.
They stand there, staring into each other’s eyes. And Dean doesn’t think Cas has the first idea where to go from here either.
Sam gets to his feet with a huff and pushes his hair out of his face. “Yeah, well, you almost died. I think I’m entitled.” He walks over to the door, but pauses there and looks over his shoulder. Dean pretends he doesn’t notice.
Dean raises an eyebrow. “You like this thing? It’s a gimmick, Cas. The capitalist machine pullin’ you in.”
“No. It’s a Tuesday, dude,” Dean says, looking at him oddly. “I know you think I’ve got a problem, but damn. I don’t have
Dean’s feeling kinda floaty. Like his head is three sizes too big, attached to his body by a looooong string. That’s probably the shock. And the piece of rebar he’s got rearranging his insides? It doesn’t even
“I’m here,” Cas says again, his voice resonant with tired amusement. “But. Inside, please? I’d like to sit down.”
Cas shifts and his shoulder blade brushes against Dean’s fingers. “Three couples in the last three months. They were all celebrating their anniversaries, and they all stayed on the upper two floors of the hotel. No couples on either of the lower two floors were targeted, even though there were others present when each of the sightings took place. Initially, Sam thought it was a ghost, but after some thought we decided that wasn’t possible…”
“Already have,” Dean slurs with a faint, sad grin, ignoring the stricken look on Sam’s face. “This is it, man. Was… was gonna tell you how great you are. But you’re too busy talkin’ on the
“Nah,” he drawls. “I’ve got better things to do with my mouth. And,” he says with a smirk as he tips his head to show off one of his many (many, many) hickeys, “so does he. So I’d make myself scarce, if I were you. I wouldn’t want us to scar your delicate sensibilities.”
He’s upright in half a second flat, cold, clammy fear swamping him like a tidal wave. Cas is— oh god, did he— did he
Dean stops. His shoulders are hunched protectively against whatever he saw in Cas’ face. “No. We’re… we’re gonna find a way to do this.
The carefully defined parameters of their relationship had changed, and it was like walking into your house to find that all the furniture had been rearranged while you were out. You recognize all of it but you don’t have the first clue where anything is, and your familiar spaces have turned strange and confusing.
Dean sighs, then scowls. “That weed is no longer on the table. Go get your own. I’m not sharing anymore because you’re a traitor.”
But Cas’ hand is warm on his neck, his fingers firm. Dean slumps further and further into Cas’ chest as the minutes drag on, slowly breathing him in: the muted scent of that lavender soap he discovered a couple months back, and under that the soft, indescribable smell of his skin. He disagrees, but Dean still swears he smells a little like a thunderstorm: like ozone and the air before rain. Like something otherworldly.
Sam must’ve watched every single crime drama on Netflix. Cas has taken up, oddly enough, wood carving, and he’d mentioned something about wanting to try knitting.
He’s handing Cas his mangoes when he realizes that the bear is probably just the first instance of many, many future interrogations about the intricacies of Valentine’s Day. This’ll be Cas’ first one since he Fell, and he’s probably gonna have a shitload of questions. Most of which Sam knows he’s probably gonna end up answering. Dean’s been good about humouring Cas’ curiosity up to this point,
“Hey, there were extenuating circumstances at play, there.” ‘Extenuating circumstances’ being that a girl hit on Cas while they were at the bar, and as a result Dean did roughly six shots in ten minutes. Cas thinks it’s because Sam dared him to. Sam isn’t allowed to think anything. “And I wasn’t
“Yeah?” It comes out a little breathless, and Dean hopes to god that Cas didn’t pick up on it. “Crashing a party, huh. Real rebellious teen of you, buddy.”
“I don’t need you to be mine,” Cas says gently, his arms loosening a little. “I just need you to be happy.”
“I mean, yeah, I guess. It’s just kinda something people do. Love makes you do stupid stuff, Cas, up to and including buying your girlfriend a shitty stuffed bear. Believe me.”
The second joint he rolls is serviceable; kinda lumpy and a little weird, but solid. Just to prove he can do it, he rolls one more, and he allows himself a proud grin at the result. There. He just needed a little practice.
Dean gulps half the glass in one go, toasting Sam with a mocking tilt of his head before he does. Sam can see what he’s trying to do: he’s trying to goad Sam into commenting on the drinking so he can blow up and storm off. Sam stays as impassive as a brick wall.
He ruffles Miracle’s ears and presses a quick kiss to Charlie’s temple before beating a hasty retreat to his room. Just in time, too: he’s only just shut his own door when the creak of the front one squeals through the cabin.
and deliberately puts his book down on the table. He doesn’t seem embarrassed, but he isn’t looking at Dean, either. “It’s a Valentine’s Day message board. You pay a small fee to have a message of your choosing appear in the February 14th issue of the Lebanon Herald.”
Then Dean remembers that other thing he said. The three-word one. And suddenly those five make a lot more sense.
But he knows, knows it right down to his bones, that if he had the chance? If someone gave him the opportunity? There’s not much he wouldn’t give to get his one back.
he snarls in disgust, “isn’t gonna help. Not that we’d even be able to find a shrink out there who’d take me. It’s not gonna help, Sam, because—”
Meanwhile, Cas is working himself up into one of his blazing angelic furies in the face of Dean’s mute shock. “I know you don’t reciprocate. I’ve made my peace with that. But I have hidden this for far too long, and I am finished. I’m done, Dean. I love you and I will not be ashamed of it.”
The rain has stopped. Morning sun spills through the kitchen window, lighting up the room. Lighting up Cas. And nature must be getting into irony, because in the warm glow he looks even more like an angel than he usually does.
Dean doesn’t scowl. She doesn’t deserve that. “There’s nothing to talk about,” he says firmly as they start walking again. “Sam wants me to pour my damn heart out to someone and… I dunno,
Sam continues to stew in sullen, scruffy-cheeked silence as the nurse helps Dean put on a nasal cannula and then takes him through some breathing exercises, to make sure he’s not gonna forget how to work his lungs now that there’s no machine doing it for him. Dean obeys, grudgingly. But he’s fine.
From there, it’s only a matter of time until he lists to the side, sealing his fate as his head hits the pillow.
The unseen birds singing their little hearts out, the distant hum of cars passing on the road, that squirrel scampering around the base of the tree over there. Life. The greater good, if you want to get sappy about it.
Sam pays for his stuff and leaves Dean to finish picking out his junk food, strolling out to the car and sliding into the passenger seat. It’s still pretty cool out, and he’s glad he remembered to wear a heavier jacket. He’d thought he was gonna have to remind Cas, but Dean had already gotten him all set up with one of his coats before they left.
Then Michael shrugs, and the echo of what could have been collapses into so much ash. “But I’m glad it wasn’t you.”
Dean brushes off his brother's stubbornness and throws his duffel into the impala's trunk. "I'm not hiding anything, Sam." At first, Dean thinks Sam is going to argue with him but Dean catches a glimpse of the duffel in Sam's hand and knows he's already won. With a sigh, Sam throws his own duffel into the trunk and throws Dean the room key. "Fine, don't tell me, but I'm picking the music," Sam smirks and climbs into the passenger seat. Dean rolls his eyes and shuts the impala's trunk.
Castiel contemplates the idea and the fact that if he loses he'd theoretically be under Dean's control. "Deal?" He doesn't know anything about this person it could be a bad idea. However, when Dean sits up extending his hand towards Castiel and watches him with those enticingly green eyes he can't help but reach out. "Okay deal."
The light stops its slow melodic humming in exchange for a low almost growling sound. Even the brightness seems to dim and Dean unconsciously steps back. He can't help the anxiety that grows in his chest he doesn't know what this light is, he only has a name from this creature and a request to go searching for something he doesn't have any idea how to find.
Dean's chest tightens at the thought. He's ruined everything. Dean gently pushes Castiel's hand away from him, holding onto his wrist as his arm drops by his side. "I'm sorry," Dean mumbles before releasing the angel's wrist, throwing his bag over his shoulder and walking out the door.
Dean exhales, inhales again, inches his arms under him and pushes himself up onto his hands and knees. His head swims. He feels his stomach tighten and gags down the urge to throw up, which hurt his ribs some more. He stays that way for a bit, on his hands and knees with his head hanging. He crawls over, gets ahold of one of the chairs and slowly gets himself upright. Everything blurs for a minute, then comes back into focus again. He inhales some more and feels a little steadier. A hand rests on his shoulder. "Are you okay?"
Castiel watches him and shrugs, attempting to be nonchalant. "Okay, then Dean I would like to eat food with you and 'hang out'."
"I'm on any minute now so I hope you're staying to watch," Dean whispers in Castiel's ear nipping it gently as he spoke. By this point, Castiel is bright red biting his bottom lip trying not to lean into Dean's soft lips.
Castiel looks at him in slight panic at the mention of an injury but Dean waves him off. "The grace must have healed it in my sleep." Dean grins as he lifts his arm up and rotates it over his head and back down, a movement he hadn't been able to do since he was thirteen. The angel however looks even more troubled as if Dean had grown back a new limb in front of him. Dean rolls his eyes. "What now?" He whines. "It's only temporary. I can at least use it to heal my crappy broken bones."
Sam quickly turns back around, holding his brother by the arms out of fear for him reaching for the gun Sam knows he has hidden beneath his shirt. "Dean!" Sam tries to think of a valid excuse anything that will make Dean actually think. Then it hits him. Gluttony. He pushes Dean to get his attention. "You haven't finished your food." Sam watches as Dean seems to contemplate the food. The anger in his eyes being replaced with a spark of recognition as the curse fights over which urge to follow. Dean flinches, taking a step away from both Castiel and the leftover food. "Shit," He curses, holding his head as his face scrunches up in pain. Until suddenly his whole body straightens and the spark in his eyes returns. "Sam get the food, Jake go to the car." Dean sets his jaw and walks past Sam. Sam does as he's told and quickly packs the food away as Jake watches with a furrowed brow. "What the hell?" He asks, standing up. Sam glances over his shoulder to where Dean is walking out the door with Castiel luckily not covered in blood. "I'll explain later."
Crowley holds his hands up, gesturing to himself. "Well darling I could tell you but I don't think you'd be up to the challenge." He sneers. Both Castiel and Dean scowl at the demon. "Answer the question." Castiel orders tiredly. He shifts on the bed his weight dipping the mattress and forcing Dean to slide closer, their thighs touching ever so slightly, the touch setting fire to Dean's skin. Crowley sighs. "Simple. I'm here to see how my closest and dearest friend is doing?" He stretches his arms, flexing his fingers and picking at his suit sleeve. "And I may also be here to collect my...compensation."
Uriel scoffs and Dean's fists curl by his side. "Is that what Castiel has been telling you?" The accusation behind his words is enough for Dean's mouth to snap shut. The angel's words are scathing, dripping with sarcasm as if Dean is so naive and below him. "We're soldiers." Uriel's head raises an inch higher so that he's looking down at Dean with his nose pointed up. "We were designed to protect heaven not a bunch of evolved apes."
Dean breathes. His body is loose with relief; his unsaid words linger sourly in the back of his mouth. He’s happy, he’s so fucking happy he thinks he might just explode from it, and he wants to crawl into a hole and die because he’s such a yellow coward.
Eventually, he thinks he gets the picture. He’s reasonably certain she’s saying she was trying to turn one of them into a chick.
“Yeah,” Dean says after a long pause. He sounds so very, very tired, and his eyes shift restlessly around the room: the floor. The wall. Bobby, for a short second. (Anywhere but at Cas.) “Yeah, I’ve got this. Go.”
Cas’ stubble is rough against his thumbs, the skin of his neck soft and warm under Dean’s palms. It takes Cas a few heart-stopping seconds to kiss him back, but when he does... Dean can’t remember the last time he was this happy.
Sam stews in silence for a second. “Jerk. Rusalki are related to fairies, so iron. But I think if you can talk to her, you should be able to sort this out peacefully.”
He’s just taken another hit when the obnoxious creak of the metal hatch opening squeals out into the night, and he whips around to see a head poking through, the light from inside spilling out in a warm glow.
Sam grits his teeth. He feels like an enabler, this is— but Dean won’t talk unless he’s at least got a chance at getting drunk enough to forget. So Sam pours him another couple fingers and swallows down his protests.
Dean is looking at him like he’s never seen him before in his life. He’s tense, as if he’s just encountered a new threat, and his eyes—
as he rolls the lap table over the bed, putting the glass in Dean’s reach. He hasn’t gotten around to lecturing Dean yet: there’ve been too many people around, and honestly, Dean’s been too out of it. That’s the thing about hospitals — they’ve got the good drugs. But now that his breathing tube’s out, and the doctors have assured Sam that he’s more or less stable...
“I don’t know what you want me to say.” He can hear the faint, pleading note in his own voice, and he sees the way Dean’s shoulders tense at it. “I’m trying to do what’s right. The angels can’t handle free will; they need a leader. Raphael wants to destroy the world. Crowley is too powerful to ignore. I’m trying to make sure none of these things becomes a larger problem than we can handle.”
Lucifer was working for Chuck. (Of course he was.) He tried to betray them. (Of course he did.) He and Michael fought. (Of course they did.)
He doesn’t know how or when it happened, or even what did it in the end. Just that it is. He can guess, sure; he’s tried a couple of times. But all
He takes a step forward, a flicker of that same desperate fear from the barn where Dean almost kicked it for good edging in next to his anger. “Don’t you ever do that to me again. Don’t make me watch you die, don’t make me lose you. Not now. Not again.”
Dean,” Cas says harshly, desperately ignoring Dean’s last words. “None of you can. Do you know where to find a store of power large enough to let me beat Raphael? Do you have a weapon stashed away that I can use? No. I didn’t think so.”
Dean sucks in a shaky breath, loud in the silence of the night. Slowly, he starts to descend the steps, his movements reminding Sam of a sleepwalker’s: jerky and uncoordinated, his boots scuffing against the wood.
Silently, Dean reaches down and gathers Cas into his arms. He’s not sure if he’ll be able to stand, but he manages it. Just. Sam has a hand outstretched towards him, and Dean doesn’t know whether it’s an attempt to stop him or if he’s trying to make sure Dean doesn’t stumble under Cas’ weight.
that vamp get a hold of you. You’re reckless, you have even less of a self-preservation instinct than usual, and it’s going to get you killed. Which I’m starting to think is the
Lucifer ignores him and perches on the tabletop right next to where Dean is sitting, resting his hands on his thighs.
Dean only gets one foot on the floor before Cas wraps a hand around his bicep and yanks him back down. He narrowly avoids making a very embarrassing noise and lies there, completely still, with his heart thundering in his ears. Cas hasn’t let go of his arm.
Sam looks over at him in shock; Dean still hasn’t lowered his gun. He hasn’t lowered his gun, but he— he said it.
“Sure, good idea. I wanted to tweak that a little anyways. Can you run down to the store and get some bacon, a baguette, and, uh... whipping cream for me? I’ve got a pie in the oven already, I’ve gotta keep an eye on it.”
“Coffee’s in the pot,” he manages, staring down at his pan. The rest of these’ll need to be flipped soon. They’re starting to get the telltale little bubbles in the top.
undeserved as it is. Sick as he feels for accepting it. “Superman going to the dark side,” he says, mimicking the joking tone he’s often heard Dean use when applying a reference. “I’m still just Castiel.”
Magda steps forward just before they’re about to leave, her hands clasped in front of her. “Please,” she says, looking between them, “may I give you a blessink? For your troubles.”
it will, he can feel the disappointment and loss and grief pressed up against his heart like the point of a knife, like a sword of Damocles waiting to fall—
A line forms between Cas’ eyebrows, and under his anger he’s obviously hurt. Dean sees it, and part of him is losing his mind because what is he
“I still don’t think you’re coping,” Sam says eventually. “For a while there, I thought maybe you were starting to…” He shakes his head. “But you’re really not.”
But whatever Charlie says must work, because Sam doesn’t try to bother him. Dean listens through all of Springsteen’s greatest hits before taking off his headphones, and when he peeks out his window Charlie’s car is gone from the drive. Sam hasn’t knocked, hasn’t stuck his head in, hasn’t even texted.
Dean hangs up on Sam’s obnoxious laughter and leans back in his chair, rubbing his eyes. “Hey, Cas,” he calls. “Wanna get room service?”
The last thing he’s aware of before everything fades out is the hopeless, bitter tang of defeat spreading across his tongue.
Dean drops his hand from his eyes with a shaky exhale. He sits up, turning so he can look Cas in the eye. “I want to, though. You know that, right? I want this. I want you.”
He swipes the accept button with a thumb that feels like a too-full sausage. His head is spinning. “Cas?” He asks as metal bands snake around his lungs, crushing the air out of him.
Uncaring of what it’ll do to him if he’s wrong, Dean rips the door of Sam’s room open and stumbles inside, Cas’ name rising up in his throat.
Finally, he sighs, forcing the words out like he’s pulling teeth. “Since I Fell, things have been... different. I’m going to die one day. That was always a possibility, but the odds of that day coming sooner rather than later are much higher now than they were when I was an angel.”
In the end, everything works out fine. Cas talks the rusalka down from whatever it was she was planning on doing while Dean wrestles his way into some jeans and the most casual shirt he has, and then they switch off on monster-sitting duty so Cas can get dressed.
He closes the bathroom door behind him; wouldn’t do to have Sam popping up like an overgrown daisy while he’s trying to flush his drugs down the can. He opens the bottle with a violent twist and dumps the pill into his palm, then extends his hand over the toilet. He’s going to do this.
those? Who nails random rusty-ass metal spikes up like that in the first place?) And maybe he knew that charging that mountain of a vamp head-on was never going to work out in his favour. But it’s not like he threw himself onto the thing like a disgraced samurai. He didn’t
Then he looks up, and Dean lurches back into motion. He crosses to the table, deposits the plates, and sits down, reaching out to flip the paper towel off the bacon.
Buying time before he had to face his latest colossal screw up, he moved quietly to the kitchen to get his own cup of coffee and some of the dry toast that was left out for him. He ate a piece numbly, brushing the crumbs into the sink. He heard a noise behind him and swung around to catch a very guilty looking Cas.
“Also, drunk? Or, high, maybe? Thought I smelled pot out there. Secondhand smoke is a really bitch, I hear, along with all that crap?” Dean retorted lightly but he could tell that Cas didn’t buy it.
Cas countered easily, “What makes you think I tell you everything? He’s a good friend. I called him in for the game Saturday, not that it’s any of your business.”
Dean sighed and closed his eyes, wanting to just feel. He let the pleasure filled feeling of Cas caressing his cock take over but he answered absentmindedly anyway, “Don’t know that it was an actual thought before today. Before that, it was just instances, like enjoying the warmth when our hands touched. That always felt good. You look great without a shirt on. Really built, you know. But the kissing contests . . . God, that might have been . . . watching you . . .  Wondering . . .” Dean trailed off with a shudder.
He wanted to be with someone he actually knew. Someone he connected with. Someone it was easier he could really believe cared. He felt that here.
“Good, good. Heard they partied at the old bat’s place. Hope they learned their lesson this time. Someone should have burned that place down long time ago. ‘Course word has it that someone tried but it didn’t burn. She was spooky enough when we were kids. Still say that’s what happened to that missing girl last year,” McDonald reminisced.
“Because I can tell that you’re drunk off your ass, man, and I don’t want you killing yourself in a wreck. Think of your baby,” Cas growled.
Cas answered easily, “Just wanted to a look and help out if you needed it.” Then Cas turned to the other man and introduced, “Dad, this is Dean. Dean, my dad, Lyle Cummings.”
Being with Cas wasn’t the same but, at the same time, it was because Dean was able to relax and let go. Not worry about reputations, being tough, being, well, the image that Dean had made for himself. And the best part was that Cas let him.
Dean slapped Cas lightly on his back as he moved around him to show the sheriff the grave. He had only gone a couple of steps before Lyle demanded irritably, “Why the hell would you shot at a ghost with those kids in there?”
He snarked mentally before he answered his own sarcasm with the knowledge that he had actually known that really well.
Cas swore Dean was trying to make him lose his ever-loving mind, or suck it out of him through his cock. Shit, Dean’s mouth sucked so long and hard, like he was savoring the taste, while his hand gripped and pulled at Cas. But those two things had nothing on that magic tongue of his.
After a moment of no response, he turned his head to see if Cas had passed out. He saw Cas staring at something. He followed Cas’s eyes and saw them watching his resting hand. He smiled slightly and tested a theory. He slid his hand down and into the waist band of his jeans then rested it there. Cas swallowed hard, having followed Dean’s hand to where it now rested, before he glanced up to find Dean’s eyes on him.
Cas motioned him in before demanding, “Didn’t anyone teach you kids how to close a damn door. What were you? Born in a barn?” The kids glanced away with shamed faces.
Dean’s silky tongue stroked Cas’s entire length, swirled around his crown, thrusted into the top slit before circling around to the beginning repeatedly. Cas had a hard time keeping his eyes from rolling into the back of his head, and possibly out of it, then he felt his entire length swallowed down Dean’s throat. He knew this was something that he had to watch happening.
Cas’s loud laughter was heard through the phone while Kelly stammered with embarrassment and Alfie hissed out, “Seriously, dude? What the hell?”
He packed everything away, took some more Tylenol then headed back to Cas’s place, feeling better now that he’d at least done something useful while he was here. He didn’t know where the need to justify his time came from, probably his father, but now he could really relax and enjoy what time he had here.
Cas frowned in confusion at the new topic as he looked up from his shot. “Flo? You mean, from the night that I met you, Flo?” At Dean’s nod, Cas cocked his head curiously then clarified, “Make what up to her?”
“Fell into a freakin’ snake nest. Think I got them all, though,” Dean commented wryly. “Plus, can’t really answer when I couldn’t really hear anything, you know?”
Dean’s phone vibrated within his pocket. He pulled it out and checked it but saw that it was only a text message. He sighed and put the phone away for later. If it was a text, it wasn’t immediately important.
“No, please,” Dean whispered, trying to keep what was left of his pride and not beg. “I just needed . . . wanted . . .”
Cas let Dean’s cock go with a loud pop which caused a pleasure filled shudder to travel the length of Dean’s body. Dean groaned over the loss then felt Cas lick up one side of his shaft and down the other. Cas’s mouth moved to his balls to play there briefly before heading back up. The whole time Cas’s hand stroked and pumped him.
Cas wiggled an eyebrow at Dean who smirked back. “It’s really simple. A certain lady of our past acquaintance ruled that I was the better kisser. Pretty boy here seems to think that she had different motive. So the rules are simple. We both get to kiss you ladies and you tell us who’s better.”
did it and I just want to know why the hell you didn’t take help with you. You are injured and she could have . . .” Alfie trailed off unpleasantly.
“Nah, I protected it. Probably got a couple of new ones but no big. Felt good to do that. Haven’t done that since Sam . . .,” Dean started out happily then trailed off with a note of sorrow.
The bartender smiled big. “Yeah, he is at that. You must be Dean. I’m Ted, bartender here.” Ted offered his hand and Dean shook it. “Cas said that he’d be here in about thirty. He’s finishing up a car.  Can I get you something while you wait?”
Before Cas could respond, he felt Dean slide down his body and Dean’s mouth captured his cock. The pleasure that had filled Cas at Dean’s endearment of ‘baby’ was nothing compared to having his cock swallowed up without a warning. Cas slammed his head lightly against the wall to keep from coming immediately down Dean’s throat.
Ignoring his mind and just focusing on the pleasure he felt, Dean pulled up again while he watched the effects of what he was doing to Cas. Cas groaned lustily, thrusting his hips up at Dean. Dean glanced at Cas’s face briefly before he refocused his attention on what he wanted but he wondered huskily, “What, Casy?”
“Fine, Cas. Just resting. Don’t mind me. Feel free to lay into the teeny boppers at will,” Dean snarked softly.
“You’re such a girl,” Dean snarked lightly as he let his hand slide down Cas’s torso, enjoying the contact. Contact with someone he knew cared about. He needed that so much and Cas’s skin was soft and warm. Cas’s muscles spasmed slightly as his hand passed over them.
Cas shook himself and adlibbed quickly, “Just check to make sure that bruise didn’t get any bigger from sparring.”
Cas leaned forward and ran his tongue lightly over Dean’s bottom lip, tasting the salty wetness that Cas had put there. Dean’s tongue came out to trace over the same path when Cas’s lips swooped down to sample those lush lips to the fullest. Cas captured Dean’s tongue in the process, sucking it into his mouth like a captured prisoner.
Dean grinned cockily, “You should know by now that appearances can be very deceiving. Get in, short stuff, before they leave us behind.” Kyle returned the grin and hurried over to the other side of his car.
Dean frowned slightly then suggested, “I know it’s the middle of the week but you could always try a sleepover or something. Might help you pass the night.”
Dean finished with his shower, dried off then wrapped a towel around him. He headed out of the bathroom and ran into Cas coming into the bedroom. Cas followed him out and told him, “I ordered pizza. It should be here soon. There’s money on the shelf by the door.”
Yeah, it was a huge turn on, having so much raw strength quivering under him. Dean vaguely wondered yet again where the hell these thoughts were coming from but didn’t care as he sucked down Cas’s cock again. He drank down more of the liquid oozing from Cas’s leaking cock, loving the flavor. It tasted so . . . Cas.
“Did Amber have blonde hair and blue eyes? Like Kelly?” Dean prodded gently. The father nodded solemnly which caused Dean to sigh. “According to what the ghost said to Kelly, the woman her husband replaced her with looked just like them. Petite, blonde, young, blue eyes. That’s why . . . “
Dean quirked a crooked grin. “Of course, I want a burger. Then after the house, we need to run some plays. Then tonight we can go to Mel’s see who picks up the most chicks. By the way, where are my boots?”
Cas’s forehead crinkled slightly with concern before he admitted, “Not really but it’s hard to stop him when he gets a notion. You know?”
He slammed his phone closed and ran his hand through his hair before cursing under his breath. He moved to throw his phone but thought before of it then set it on the table beside him. He put his head in his hands with his shoulders slumped. He felt like such a freakin’ girl.
Cas glanced at him for a long moment before turning to the girls that were exchanging looks. “You really need to be a lot clearer when you ask questions like that.”
“Said I was too straight-laced for her tastes because I wouldn’t . . .” Cas trailed off, wondering again why he was telling Dean all of this.
Cas snickered at the sight then elaborated, “Dude, we just gave each other blow jobs so I think it’s safe to sleep together now. You know. As in the same bed. Which is definitely much more comfortable than the couch.”
After that first round, both men decided to take one at a time so that they could watch each other for obvious signs of cheating. The contest rules were for kissing only, although they could have an arm around the lady for hugging purposes. No other forms of contact were allowed since this was a kissing contest and they were turning the women on enough as it was.
Dean chuckled softly in response while he cursed softly under his breath. He was torn between amusement and pain. It seemed no matter what was going on, Cas always managed to amuse him.
“Nothing much. Just have a football game against some really big jerks that I want to beat into the ground. We’re a man down because of a groin injury which personally I think is more because of his wife who could definitely use some SlimFast, like a ton of it. Know what I mean?” Cas snarked playfully.
Dean grabbed his sawed off shotgun and stuck it into his smaller duffel, along with holy water, salt rounds and salt, before he pulled the duffel it out of the trunk and shouldered it. He turned to Cas and suggested conspiratorially, “Well, let’s go. If nothing else, we can maybe play a prank on them, right?” Dean wiggled his eyebrows conspiratorially.
“Man, I definitely need to try that then. That’s my favorite movie,” Dean admitted easily, feeling the tension in his shoulders and neck release at the conversation. He uncocked his gun in reaction then put the safety back on. He put the gun away then got up and stumbled to the bathroom. He felt the sudden need to clean his cuts, like he was trained to do.
“I was just trying to make you feel better about losing your money,” Dean lied easily, as always. “I get first dibs on the shower, though.”
He sighed as his hand’s encountered a dainty bracelet, knowing it was probably Amber’s or some other victim’s as they tried to escape the ghost. He kept searching the area as the men worked above him. He finished his search, dropping everything he found into his right hand jacket pocket, about the time Cas called down again.
Dean smirked sardonically, “You got it.” He accepted the blanket then laid back down and was asleep soon after.
Dean grimaced slightly before he dismissed, “In the house but no biggie. It only sounded bad because it was right next to you, half-pint.” Alfie looked like he wanted to argue but Dean shut him down. “No hospital. Just need some Tylenol and rest. I’m good.” Dean shot his eyes over to meet Cas’s in the mirror before he added firmly, “Seriously, dude. Still up for the game, too. No worries.”
