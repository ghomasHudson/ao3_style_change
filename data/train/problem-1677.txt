but he knows John is just as bad and hates them just as much, so as his last friendly deed he will do this and make it easy on John. Let him know he is valid for wanting to get as far away from Sherlock as possible. If Sherlock could run away from himself he would too. “I will of course help in any way you need, if you want my help that is. And I will make sure Mycroft is at your disposal as well, should you need him.”
With that thought, he felt himself sober up enough that he managed to walk from Baker Street to the underground without stumbling again. The tube ride felt long, although it really wasn’t anymore than fifteen minutes. John passed the time by looking at the other passengers. There was a group of young looking mothers, all gossiping and sharing baby advice. The introverts that sat in the back and had their eyes glued to their books and phones. There were students sitting in the back blaring their music. There was Sherlock.
“That really worked? Gregson never found out it was bull?” John finds it hard to believe. He had only met Gregson once or twice in passing but she had seemed sharp enough.
The conversation delves into a comfortable silence that neither of them mind. They just walk down the lit up park path, arms brushing and fingers occasionally caressing, both lost in their own separate trains of thought. Mindy is the one to eventually break it, halting their unhurried lazy stride and turning to John. The moon is just coming out and the pale light is shining in her eyes as she stares at him.
“John…” She started, “I know it’s hard to move on. Sherlock was a big part of your life,” he grumbled slightly at this but she ignored it and continued on. “He will always mean a lot to you. Nothing can ever take away what he was to you but if you ever want to move on, properly move on and heal yourself you need to start separating yourself from the memories of him.” He couldn’t hold back the scoff that seemed to tear itself out of his throat.
John chuckles as he listens to Greg go on with his anecdote. He orders another pint which leads to another and another and
He picks it up and takes it with him, along with a small wooden box from his end table and takes it to Sherlock’s room. He sits down on the bed and lays everything out before him. The gun, and later all its pieces, in a neat line and all the cleaning supplies and oils he uses on it. He goes slow, softly scrubbing and wiping, caressing the cold metal as he cleans it. It feels familiar and therapeutic and John feels himself unwinding, slowly but surely. He had done this everyday when he had been fresh out of the army. He would sit in that God-awful bedsit with only the grey walls and his gun as company. John had thought that had been the end for him; the end of the road. He had been oh-so-pleasantly surprised when that hadn’t been true. Somehow his drab grey life had been brought back to violent technicolor, all because of one man. John had thought that would be it. He’d live out the rest of his life in Baker Street with Sherlock going on cases and adventures until their old age. Now that was all gone. Crashed and burnt. Now John was right back where he started. He almost wishes he had just ended it at the bedsit. Finished himself off early. The he wouldn’t know
Without really thinking about it, John crawled into the ridiculously soft bed and wrapped himself in the smooth high thread count sheets Sherlock was so fond of. He buried his face into the fluffed up pillow and allowed himself to breath in the scent of expensive shampoo and something else he had only ever been able to describe as Sherlock. Sherlock’s scent had long since faded from the rest of the flat, even his bedding was beginning to lose the comforting fragrance John had only ever associated with his friend. The scent smelt like home. Of warmth and familiarity. John dreaded the day when the smell would eventually fade from every corner of the flat and would effectively take away the last real piece of Sherlock he had. His last true piece of comfort. Of home. Those thoughts however did nothing to dissipate the aching pit of nausea and grief weighing down his stomach, so for just a moment he pushed all the sad, spiteful and angry thoughts aside and just allowed himself to breathe in the comforting smell. As he relaxed a bit he even indulged himself in the fantasy that when he opened his eyes and got up to get ready everything would be back to normal and Sherlock would be there for real.
John realized it was strange to compare Sherlock, whom he’d never been in a romantic relationship with to a girl that was hitting on him but it was just a natural reflex at this point.
“When he… God. When he told you to do that to yourself,” he gestured frantically towards Sherlocks bandage covered hands and place his head into his open palms. “It should have been me to do that. I should have gotten hurt, not you. You had already done so much. You were already so hurt. I’m a cop, Sherlock! My job is to protect people and when it came down to it all I did was watch. I failed you and I’m… I’m sorry.”
John nodded, though he knew no one could see him, and hmmed in agreement. The clinic was notorious for being understaffed. Sarah seemed to have awful luck with finding employees and the turn over rate was startling. “
“Sherlock? I really don’t know… what?” Poor John. He’s trying so hard to be a good friend even after Sherlock has proved to be so unqualified for such affections.
John felt a fierce tug of fondness on his heart as he realized how much Mrs. Hudson had really been looking out for him. The poor woman was sure to be going through her own grief and yet she still made time to help him when he couldn’t even realize she was doing it – much less thank her for it. He really should go visit her later. He had been so reluctant to lately, knowing that he couldn’t handle her chatterbox way of speaking or her sweet well-meaning questions on his well-being but he suddenly felt as if it were the least he could do.
He wished he could tell Sherlock everything that he missed and loved about him, say the things he had always been too afraid to say (was still afraid to say), but even more than that he wished he could take back everything he
“I better be going I think. I should really be checking up on Anderson and Donovan and I’m sure the two of you could use some time alone.” Sherlocks insides froze. What did he mean by that? Why would they need time alone? Maybe John had told Greg earlier about his plans to move out and after that awful display Sherlock just made the DI figured John wanted to get it out as soon as possible.
John gasps sharp and tight as he comes hard in his own hand. The orgasm hits him like a wave and makes his limbs feel tingly, and when the shame hits, he’s almost prepared.
They drove for around thirty minutes, and Sherlock spent that time calculating how long it would take for someone to notice he was missing. He estimated it would take around twelve hours for anyone to notice something was amiss. John was used to him disappearing all night to investigate a case but would begin to feel uneasy when Sherlock didn’t arrive home in the morning and would probably contact Lestrade after he tried calling and texting only to get no response. So, considering all that and the amount of time it would actually take to track them down (and this was really only if they used Mycroft’s CCTV recordings) it would be around twelve hours before he was found. He didn’t like that number very much. A lot could happen in twelve hours after all.
It feels good to hear. Of course he’s not dead. He’s right here, pressed up against him right where he should be. He’s right here and it was just a bad dream.
“Then what are you?” John swallows and feels his body straighten, unconsciously going into a soldiers rest. He needs all the armour he can get for this conversation.
“I don’t have options Lestrade,” he meant it to sound like his usual impatient voice but what with the dizziness and his sudden shortness of breath it came out weak and like a bad parody of his usual self. “I have an option, one alternative which is too let John take it instead and quite frankly he’d make a horrible blind person.”
First step, he decided, was a shower. He reeked of hangover and though he hadn’t seen himself yet he knew he must look like crap. So, shower it is. Then he could get some cleaning done. He left the washer to do it’s thing and started for the shower. He turned the water on, making it a tad cooler than he normally would as his skin was feeling more tender than usual due to the hangover (and the orgasm though he is
“What are you doing today? Do you have any plans to get out of your flat?” Ella redirected the conversation. John went back to being silent. He wasn’t sure if he wanted to tell her about Mindy. He knew it would get her off his back about ‘moving on’ and ‘meeting new people’ but he didn’t want to mention it because then he would have to tell her when it inevitably fell through. And John had no doubt it would fall through. He had never been good at keeping in touch with people before he had met Sherlock and lately he had reached an all new low at it. But considering his only options at the moment were talking about it and redirecting the conversation somewhere less painful or not talking about it and sitting here for another thirty minutes while Ella continues to ask more and more probing questions he felt himself somewhat backed into a corner.
“So- sorry.” He pants out, still feeling the exertion from his orgasm. “Want me to return the favour?” He starts smirking before he realizes that Mindy isn’t. In fact, she is frowning and looking thoroughly miserable.
And John would, because Sherlock would never steer him wrong. John copied his fantasy self and pressed his middle finger that wasn’t wrapped tight around his cock, right into the soft flesh of his perineum and gave it a little wiggle. All at once stars explode behind his eyes and he has to bite his lip to keep the sounds in.
He eyed the little bottle of cologne he had splurged on a while ago and considered. Well, if a celebratory dinner with a pretty girl wasn’t an excuse to use a little then what was? He picked up the dark green cylinder and held it in front of him, pushing down the compressor he sprayed it modestly in the air and walked into it. The smell of pine and spice filled his nose and he felt the cinnamon tinged aroma cling to his skin and clothes, the artificial perfume colliding with his own scent and fusing together to create something intoxicating.
She’d seemed to have a personal vendetta against the younger man that night and apparently made it her mission to make the dinner as uncomfortable as possible.
His eyes found their way to John’s who was already staring back, the blue eyes held a soldiers determination, still testing the ropes that held him, and the weight of his gaze held nothing but faith that Sherlock would pass whatever kind of test this was with flying colours, but also promised death to anyone in the room not on their side.
He settled, right knee in between John’s legs, noticeably not touching anything too sensitive, and John reached up to give him an almost chaste kiss.
He’d brushed it off then, caught off guard. But staring blankly up at his ceiling, weeks after the fact, he let himself fully admit it. For the first time in his and Sherlock’s partnership, he’d truly felt jealous, like he’d been replaced. Looking at the two veritable geniuses mentally sparring with their perfect hair and perfect cheekbones had reminded John of what he wasn’t. Irene Adler was Sherlock’s equal, and John, well… wasn’t.
“So beautiful,” John breathed, pushing his finger slowly inside the hole. Just a little, moving it in and out. The man squirmed more under his hand. “Talk to me, Sherlock,” John continued to massage the opening, “Is this okay?”
Sherlock’s head tilted back, breathing in and out loudly. John’s breath hissed out through his teeth as he pushed farther in.
Brushing his teeth, he found himself searching for something in his reflection that might prove Sherlock could want him. Instead, he found bags under his eyes, greying hair, and a softness around the middle. He spat into the sink. He wasn’t ugly, but he certainly was no model. Not tall and posh like Sherlock. Or dangerously beautiful like a certain Woman he typically tried to avoid thinking about.
Suddenly John was struck by the memory of intertwining those fingers with his own, holding them above the man’s head as John rutted down onto Sherlock, Sherlock moaning into his mouth with each thrust-
“In the army, that’s what we call ‘running away,’” John smirked, “Though you’d make a good soldier with that attitude.”
, John looked away quickly. “Morning,” he said as casually as he could manage. He didn’t trust himself to say more.
Before he knew it, they were through Sherlock’s doorway, and John felt himself pause. Again, the memory of them falling into John’s bed, drunk, desperate, flooded his brain. Of course John didn’t regret it, how could he possibly? But he wished now that they had taken their time a little. They had been, both of them, anxious. Afraid. John hadn’t gotten the chance to really see Sherlock, to appreciate this beautiful man who, somehow, wanted him back.
“Wait, Sherlock,” John moved away slightly, urging Sherlock’s head up as he let John’s penis fall out of his mouth.
“Do you have-” John began to ask, but Sherlock interrupted him, already knowing what John was going to say, and leaned over to search through his drawers. A few seconds later, he triumphantly returned with a little bottle of lube. But after handing it to John, he looked a little lost, unsure of what he should be doing.
“Yeah, maybe just face the other way, stomach down,” John said. Sherlock nodded, moving to comply, but his eyes looked a little panicky. “Hey,” John touched Sherlock’s back, and Sherlock resumed a sitting position. “You ok?” He stroked his back lightly.
He began thrusting in, out, with incredible restraint, two hands on Sherlock’s hips. He remembered Sherlock’s leaking cock, spat into his hand, and began to stroke. Sherlock’s hips bucked as he cried out, and John began to move a little faster. With every thrust, Sherlock’s hair became more and more unkept, surrounding his head like a dark halo, fringe beginning to stick to his sweaty forehead.
“Yes, yes, I-” Sherlock hissed, and he spasmed, coming with a deep groan, John could feel Sherlock’s cum on his stomach and chest.
Sherlock was looking at John queerly now, probably deducing his train of thought. Maybe they’d have that conversation later.
Now that he thought about it, had John ever said that out loud before, admitted that he had shagged a bloke once? He couldn’t recall a single person he’d had the guts to admit it to, not even Harry. Okay, maybe some internal issues to be worked out there.
John shook his head. No, he was not going to encourage his morning wood. He sat for a few minutes, listening to the various nefarious kitchen noises, trying to decide what to do. Trying to deduce why Sherlock had left his bed so soon after entering it.
“I don’t understand why you would… want me. When you could have,” Sherlock gestured vaguely with their joined hands, “Anyone else.”
John knew now why he had no evidence from the night before concerning his flatmate’s heart. In the dark, drunk off of wine and whiskey, they had barely spoken. One simple touch had lit the flame, and it was merely seconds before they had stumbled onto John’s bed, kissing, wanting. John hadn’t even thought to turn on the lights, what for?
“No, it’s good, it’s too good,” John reassured him quickly, guiding Sherlock up to kiss him. Christ, he could taste himself in Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock looked confused.
Maybe John was expecting too much of him. Maybe Sherlock was just impatient, not one for lie-ins. Sherlock knew how long John was prone to sleep, which was not much really, but compared to Sherlock, everyone slept like the dead. Anyway, given the time, he’d have to know that John was awake by now.
John turned, but Sherlock had subtly resumed his position, refocused on other things not visible to the naked eye. This time, John didn’t just take a quick glance. He let himself observe, deduce, gather evidence. He smirked as the kettle suddenly whistled and the detective started, jumping a little before resuming his indifferent stare.
, this was bliss. Everything about this was infinitely better than last night. Just the fact that he could see Sherlock clearly, eyes dark, lips stretched, cheeks flushed, was enough to fuel John’s fantasies for the rest of his life. It was superior to every shameful scenario his mind had ever concocted. No matter how much he had tried not to think about sex with Sherlock, the thoughts would come, and he’d have to bat them away like flies.
No, he’d have taken a hundred uncomfortable erotic dreams over one where he believed Sherlock might actually love him back.
John’s anxiety began to turn to bitterness as he filled the kettle and placed it on the burner. Why was Sherlock here, in their common living space, if he had wanted so badly to get away from John this morning? Why couldn’t he be a decent bloke who could let him down gently, look him in the eyes and stammer platitudes such as “It’s not anything you did,” or “I just don’t want you to get hurt.” He tried to picture Sherlock saying those things and almost smiled. God knows John had said shit like that enough times, though he suspected it never really made any of the women feel better. Still, the golden rule, right?
After the third finger, Sherlock was getting impatient. He turned a little to look back at John, his eyes impossibly dark. “So? Are you going to fuck me, or not?”
The toaster popped, and John realized he had never even put the bread in. He let out an exasperated breath, then something caught his eye. In the reflection of the application’s steel, John could see the outline of Sherlock. Though the image was a little fuzzy, John could definitely tell, Sherlock was not looking at his microscope. His head was turned, and he was looking in John’s direction. No, not just in his direction, he was looking
“Shit,” John cursed, fucking Sherlock with abandon now, feeling his cock ready to explode. Another thrust and, “
He wasn’t even getting blown, yet seeing this man smelling him in his most vulnerable spot, almost reverently, eyes closed, John felt himself get completely hard. He put his hand in Sherlock’s hair, running his fingers through it as Sherlock sucked on a ball.
“Now you’ll think twice about leaving me alone in bed, yeah? Wouldn’t want to miss exciting moments like this,” John joked, breaking the silence. Sherlock chuckled, and John could feel it all through his chest.
Maybe it was his imagination, but he could swear the shuffling in the kitchen came to a stop as John opened the door and began to walk down the stairs. Regardless, he beelined for the toilet, a welcome diversion from his worst insecurities who were no doubt waiting to swallow him up in the next room. Besides, he desperately needed to take a piss.
John pushed the thought away. But now that he was sober and squinting in the morning light, everything he knew argued for the side of self-doubt.
Sherlock nodded slowly, reaching up to cover John’s hand with his own. “Alright.” After a moment, he moved to a kneeling position, arms bracing him.
Sherlock opened his mouth, perhaps to break the tension with a humorous comment to decrease the intensity. Or maybe to assure John he wasn’t much worth looking at. Or to call John an illogical fool. Whatever the words might have been, Sherlock refrained. Instead, he closed his eyes and let his forehead rest on John’s, who mirrored him. Together, they let out a breath they hadn’t realized they had been holding.
The bitterness faded into resignation as John opened the door of the fridge to grab some bread and butter. Maybe it was better this way, keeping the status quo. John could suffer in silence. He’d already been doing that anyway, he was a professional at this point. Sherlock could keep his dignity or perceived logical purity, and acquaintances could keep mistaking them for something they were not. The daily routine.
“Fuck,” John didn’t need to be told twice. He added another finger, stretching the rim and, every once in a while, caressing Sherlock’s prostate. Sherlock was now thrusting back in a slow rhythm, John watched his fingers slide in and out with more and more ease.
“You’re bloody gorgeous,” John mumbled into Sherlock’s back. He could feel Sherlock breathing quickly underneath his mouth. “Relax a little, alright? Breathe.”
He pulled away. Sherlock’s eyes, closed during the kiss, opened slowly. John smiled. “Just getting a good look at you,” he said finally, “in the light. I… didn’t get a chance to yesterday.”
“And even if I hadn’t been completely indifferent to her, physically, how could I have felt romantically towards her while I was in completely in love with you?”
Sherlock pouted, and John laughed, moving his hand to Sherlock’s cheek. “Thank you for telling me. If you really want us to do this, I want you to enjoy it. We can take it slow. Honestly, it’s been a while for me as well,” John admitted.
-“ he didn’t get a chance to chastise himself any further because John was suddenly rushing forward and plonking the coffees on the end table, almost spilling them but not seeming to care as he sat down carefully yet anxiously on the side of Sherlocks bed. Sherlock tensed under his friends gaze, wishing he could burrow under the covers and hide from him, hide from the conversation he knew would be coming.
This time John doesn’t freeze. He bolts to his bedroom, throws on some clothes that don’t reek of semen and alcohol and gargles with Listerine, not having time to properly brush his teeth. Breakfast is obviously out of the question and John grabs nothing but a water bottle as he storms out of the flat and onto the bustling London street.
A third of a bottle later and John couldn’t even remember why he had ever been depressed. He couldn’t remember anything at all.
“I want this job and I promise this won’t happen again. I – I don’t even know what to say about this morning.” He admits honestly. He’s never been a good liar and he knows he couldn’t pull it off now.
Before Sherlock left, John would have denied that the two of them had shared anything other than a strong platonic bond, though now he knew better. Before he felt ashamed of what being in a romantic relationship with another man would say about him but now he knew that his relationship with Sherlock was the best thing that had ever happened to him. They hadn’t been romantic, but they could have been. Should have been. Everyone else around them had seen how perfect they would have been, except for them. John couldn’t go back and change those things but he could hold his head high now and finally show his real feelings for once in his life.
“I’ll check in again tomorrow. Uh, bye.” He waved before exiting the room. As soon as the door shut John let out a long pained sigh and sat once again on the edge of Sherlock’s bed.
Moving on he checked the next text, which was from Harry. He outright deleted that one not having the energy to deal with her right now. She had never been a large fan of Sherlock in the first place (surprise surprise) and everything she said either came off as offensive or shallow. Her and Sherlock had only ever met the once and they had immediately butted heads, and surprisingly it wasn’t Sherlock that started it.
It’s a rather extravagant bouquet of red roses followed along with a slim card with elegant scrawl across it. A pretty nurse named Louise brings it in with her bright pink lips pulled into a repulsively genuine smile.
His stomach lurches at the sound of that voice and yet it succeeds in pushing him to continue his self-mutilation. He honestly doesn’t even properly remember starting on the next hand. If he thought he had been dizzy after just the cutting that didn’t even compare to how he was feeling now. The whole room seemed to be lurching from side to side and was making him feel rather nauseous. He couldn’t tell if the wooziness was from blood loss or extreme pain but he suspected it was a mixture of both. Through the foggy haze that is his brain he can feel that both of his hands are now in equal amounts of anguish and Moriarty is walking up behind him. He feels rough hands land on his burnt shoulders and he cringes away only to be pulled back; if his mouth had been free of his gag he knows he would have yelped.
“What is it?” John takes a little longer, as though trying to gather his thoughts up. Sherlock felt himself become queasier and queasier the longer the silence stretched on.
He is filled to the brim with self-disgust so rapidly, he momentarily feels nauseous. He is a complete bastard. Who the fuck calls out the name of their dead best friend mid-blowjob? Him, apparently. Now he understands why Mindy is trying to bolt. Who wouldn’t? She must think he’s gone completely mad.
Wouldn’t that be just like him; to feel nothing as he dies. It would suit him perfectly. Like a bad joke with no punch line. His life being the bad joke that is.
He takes five bites and after that he’s not so much eating it as he is playing with it. He tries to take a sixth bite but it doesn’t even make it to his mouth. John drops the fork in defeat before grabbing some plastic wrap to put over the remains of his meager meal.
“Anyhow, to make it up to me come down to the pub with me tonight.” John was about to refuse, give some half-assed excuse about how he was just too busy with other things, but honestly, a little time out of the flat might do him some good just about now.
And Sherlock himself? He was shivering a bit from the blood cooling on his skin and his cuts stung but he was fine. Completely fine. He’d had far worse injuries than this; it wasn’t anything he couldn’t handle.
The thing that ends up bringing him out of his mental rampage is his phone. The sound is loud and makes him groan out several expletives that would have made a sailor blush as he snatches his phone from where he had tossed it aside the night before. As soon as he sees the caller ID his stomach
“Suicide.” It hurts to say. Mindy inhales sharply. John thinks this may be the first time he’s said that word out loud since it’s happened. It feels… Well, not good but maybe relieving in a way. “You may have seen it in the papers actually, it was, uh, rather heavily reported on.” She quirks an eyebrow at him, not quite knowing what he’s getting at until he continues. “His name was Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes.” She brings her hands to her mouth as the information seems to click in her head.
Sarah snorts and it sounds crueler than John remembers her. “I know what to say; don’t drink the equivalent of a liquor store on a work night.” Her tone is disapproving and all knowing and John is suddenly hit with how very
A scared voice resounded from the back of his mind and tried to cover up that thought but John didn’t have the patience for that voice anymore. The one his father had put there that popped up whenever he had a not-so-straight thought. Back when he was first seeing Ella on a frequent basis she had explained it as something called internalized homophobia. He had hated that at first, thought it was a load of bollocks. He wasn’t homophobic, the very thought of hating someone for such a shallow reason made him instantly feel anger and guilt and yet as he thought about it more and more it made a lot of sense. Growing up with a dad like he had, who had lost it every time he did something that seemed the least bit queer, it was a tad hard not to get some of that in your own head. Yet he found that the programmed reaction to deny any queer or debatably homosexual feelings had been slowly fading from him ever since Sherlock… left. He found that he really couldn’t deny it with a weak outburst of ‘
When he finally awoke Sherlock was surrounded by the smell of antiseptic and clean sheets. His brain felt foggy. Like his cranium had been stuffed with cotton and clouds. It was for this reason that it took him a full minute before he realized he was in a hospital and another minute to remember
“Don’t say that you’re fine!” It was the first time that John had raised his voice since Sherlock had woken up in hospital. Sherlock hated when John got angry but he considered himself lucky that he hadn’t lost his temper much earlier, considering.
At some point they leave the restaurant and relocate to the nearby park. As they’re leaving they have a small tiff about who’s going to pay, both of them insisting on being the one to do it. John does eventually win though, saying that since he was a late arse he may as well foot the bill. She smiles and gives in, making a joke about how she’ll be sure to arrive late next time so he can’t argue. It’s getting later now, the sun just beginning to dip in the sky and John is on an anecdote about Sherlock’s odd habits.
He sped up and damn near cried at the feeling. It was electric. Hot wet heat was filling him up, rising in his body
“Here, let me take that…” Sherlock tried to resist as John took the bin away from him but he was tired and sore and his muscles were quite done with cooperating with his demands, so John barely had to tug hard at all to get the bin out of his grasp. John placed the vomit filled bucket next to his bed and grabbed something on the bedside table. “Try and drink some of this.” John handed him a new cup of water and he reluctantly drank some. He swished a bit in his mouth and spit it out back into the bin before downing the rest. On the bright side his mouth now tasted of nothing but vomit. He didn’t taste Jim Moriarty any longer.
“Did you know I never even knew when his birthday was?” John asks lazily as the alcohol kicks it up a notch.
He realized that his breathing had gotten much heavier, he tried to swallow back some of his fear. This was going to be painful. This wasn’t just a few superficial cuts that looked far worse than they were.
Carefully, John gave Sherlocks hand a light squeeze and a small reassuring smile, “Everything’s fine. We’re on our way to hospital now so just rest a bit. It’s all fine,” he wasn’t sure if the repeated reassurances were for him or John himself but he didn’t think about it to hard as he let his eyes fall shut finally let the black dots take over completely.
“You look awful.” Sherlock could blame his lack of tact on the drugs currently being pumped into his system but he was never really one for tact, drugs or no. Greg however seemed about as unbothered by it as he is of most of the inappropriate things Sherlock does and just let out a surprised snort, his face evening out a bit in amusement.
, John tells him. He nuzzles his head into the taller man’s neck wanting to get more of that warm rich scent. God, why had they never done this before?
At the time Sherlock had looked desperate. John wonders if he would have let John play with him. Sherlock had been so restless, pacing up and down the pool, waving that gun around like a toy. John could have put that energy to much better use.
John did none of these things and only nodded in understanding. He didn’t seem at all distressed about the hospital issued drug use either.
“Look at me.” John demanded but Sherlock shook his head in refusal. This was a hard enough conversation without having to see John’s face during it. To see what his best friend was feeling. That would surely be too much for his heart to take.
“Not long. A few hours. Five tops. You were going in and out for a while but you probably don’t remember the first few times you woke up. You kept falling back under in a matter of seconds,” he glances over at the dark haired man before looking back down to his lap and continuing. “They stitched up your, uh, your cuts, and did some kind of surgery on your shoulders before bandaging them up. Gave you a sedative, that sort of thing. Pretty sure they were waiting for you to be conscious to do anything more drastic. John and I already gave our statements to the cops, though they’ll still need one from you…” he looked back up at Sherlock to gauge his reaction but Sherlock was already off again. His fuzzed up brain finally reminded him that John was no where in sight which was unusual. Sherlock did expect some sort of negative reaction from John, he had a temper and wasn’t very good at hiding it and Sherlock had done something even more outrageous than usual (which was really saying something) but he had at least expected John to be there when he woke up. He felt a cold weight drop in his stomach. An uneasy feeling spread through him a nagging voice in his head was mocking him.
He took another swig of whiskey and delighted in the burning sensation it made as it slid down his throat. The flat was completely silent and it was slowly driving him mad. He had tried watching some stupid show on the telly but that idea had been immediately shot down when he couldn’t stop imagining Sherlock’s commentary on everything. He always acted annoyed with his flatmate whenever he would deduce the ending of the movie or which character was next to die in Game of Thrones but really he had always found it overwhelmingly endearing. He wished he had told him that. He wished he had told him how much he loved listening to him prattle on about how the show had gotten which details wrong. He wished he had told him how much he adored listening to him play the violin.
after that. After what he did to you.” John was clenching his teeth again and his fists were clenched. This, Sherlock knew, was his inner soldier coming out. The man that had invaded Afghanistan and had ‘bad days’ where he wasn’t just healing his fellow soldiers but adding to the body count. This was the man that had shot that cabbie through a window the first night they had met. The restless adrenaline junkie that had instantly connected with Sherlock. He felt choked up at seeing John like this, so caring and kind and protective (why protective? He should be disgusted) that he had to change the subject. He had to run away.
“This is bloody mad even for you.” Ah, and there was Anderson. Sherlock was somewhat impressed to see he was no longer sniveling and snotty though he was still shaking like a leaf and his eyes were bloodshot and swollen.
He unwittingly found himself thinking back to how he had pictured John when he was on his knees in front of Moriarty. He had always fantasized about that sort of relationship between the two of them, though he rarely admitted it to himself much less to anyone else. It had never been easy for him to form connections with other people yet when he met John he knew it was different. As flatmates they had a rather domestic relationship. More so then common male friends over the age of thirty, Sherlock realized. They had a sort of calm fluidity around each other and it was all too easy to picture their days of tea and toast, domestics and banter and comfortable silence mixed with kisses and tender touches. Longing looks and whispered promises. Sherlock knew this wouldn’t become a reality. He didn’t have high hopes before he had fileted and roasted himself in front of John and three members of Scotland Yard but now he knew his fantasies would stay just that. Fantasies. Perhaps John would forgive him and they could build their normalcy back up to resemble what they had before all this. They could go back to being flatmates and partners. Sherlock would be fine with that. More than fine. He would be happy to go back to that, just knowing he had John in his life would be enough.
cock, he had no doubt his libido was back to working order. He didn’t know if it was going to last but it was definitely here now. There was no denying that.
“Great!” It came out louder than she had meant it to and her face lit up a bright pink. “Sorry…” she apologized, still looking extremely bashful. Normally John would have found that cute, endearing even, yet now he just felt tired and he wanted to go home and curl up in his bed with his Browning tucked tight against his chest. “But that sounds great. Is it all right if we exchange numbers? Or I can just give you mine if you’d like.” She was definitely accommodating. She also seemed thoughtful and sweet.
The pavement was hard and cold as John ran across it, his bare feet seemed to find every jagged rock there was and he could feel the blood squelching between his toes. He wasn’t sure why he was barefoot but he knew it didn’t matter. Nothing mattered except finding whatever he was looking for. He didn’t know what he was looking for either; he just knew he
He makes it on time to work, in any case. Sarah nods approvingly and she is much nicer to him then she had been the day before but John knows he is nowhere close to making amends for the day before. He’s still got a long way to go to proving himself.
John stopped talking. Sherlock had always told him that and it was so true wasn’t it? If he had just opened his eyes and not just looked but actually
“Yeah, right. Sure.” His left hand had started shaking again and forgetting about trying to keep a front up in Ella’s presence he clenched it tight
anything. I’m informing. We were all worried Sherlock. What that bastard did to you...” Lestrade growled but wasn’t able to finish his thought before Sherlock interrupted, not particularly wanting to go there just yet.
“Yes.” He lied. He doesn’t want to put any of John’s hackles up but he is not okay. He feels violated and vulnerable sitting in a hospital bed where Moriarty could have easy access to him whenever he felt the desire. Mycroft has security installed all around the hospital of course and even Lestrade has arranged for a certain level of security and serveillance as well but in the end it’s all useless. With the kind of resources a man like Moriarty has he would have no problem getting a contact in the hospital to sneak him in. Hell, he could even just bribe one of the workers, that’s probably how he got the flowers in through security in the first place. Sherlock feels a shiver go through his body. It’s an unpleasant thing, to realize how vulnerable you are. John, ever attentive and thoughtful John, catches sight of Sherlock momentary weakness and plonks himself down beside Sherlock’s battered body, twisted his torso slightly so he can more comfortably grasp Sherlock’s torn up hand. His touch feels gentle and the feeling of John’s calloused hand covering his is monumentally comforting. The feel of John’s small strong hand covering his is starting to become beautifully familiar.
“Of course you won’t.” Mrs. Hudson deadpans. “Sherlock wasn’t the type of person you come across every time you do the shopping! He was special. But that doesn’t mean you won’t eventually meet someone else special. They just won’t be Sherlock’s kind of special.” John smiles at her.
“Just, please Sherlock, honestly how are you? And don’t try to sell me that bloody ‘fine’ bullshit. There’s no way you could be
“When… When you said his name…” Her face is red and her voice is scratchy. “I knew it had gone too far then. I – I think it finally hit me that you don’t need some no-name journalist to write an article about you. I think before I was telling myself it was all with good intentions, you know? I was doing it to help you and the publics memory of Sherlock. But when that happened… I just felt like I was manipulating you. I didn’t realize how, well how much he had meant to you. I didn’t know, John.” She hold onto his gaze, stressing her point with her eyes. “I just didn’t know.”
As he’s leaving the room it takes everything in him to fight the impulse to grab the gun and properly play out his fantasy.
of yours.” Her voice is flabbergasted as she giggles out ‘woman’ and John feels that same exasperation flow through him like it used to every time she would give him grief over a new girlfriend or whether he needed a ‘second bedroom’ after all. He’s exasperated and he’s sure that he’ll be made fun of lots throughout the rest of the afternoon but he shoves that aside, sits down and lets his landlady pour him another cuppa.
“How do you know the papers weren't telling the truth?” John obviously knows everything in the papers was complete horse shit, but few others believed it. There were others, don’t get him wrong, The majority of them being people who had met Sherlock personally, people he had helped, but others – the people who hadn’t met him, who had never seen how he was, they rarely believed any different from what the news told them.
Before he knew it he was standing in front of Baker Street, right outside of Speedy’s café. He looked through the window and saw Mrs. Hudson talking to some older bloke. John felt a small bit of relief as he stepped through the doorway to Baker Street that he wouldn’t be running into his landlady. He was exhausted and emotionally drained. He had already been so horrible to her since Sherlock had left, snapping at her or ignoring her and he couldn’t take the guilt if he lost his temper with the well-meaning woman today.
“Don’t worry about Moriarty getting anywhere near your flat either. Sally and a team of officers are already over there keeping watch over the place in case he decides to pop by for a visit.” Lestrade reassured them, though Sherlock merely scoffed.
“It’s fine. More than fine really. I’m glad you felt you could talk to me. I, well, I would really like to talk more. Hearing about your detective friend was interesting and my brother will be positively thrilled when I tell him I went on a date with
“First off, let’s just get this ridiculous idea right out of the way. I am not moving out.” Sherlock released a shaky breath he hadn’t even known he’d been holding. “I have no intention of moving out of Baker Street. Not ever really. I don’t know where you got that idea from but it’s rubbish. Complete rubbish.” John sat back down on the bed now, all traces of anger clearly snuffed out by now. “Secondly, you are not repulsive. Not even close. You could never do anything to make me think otherwise. Why would you even think that?”
“Now, just so you know, it actually took me a considerable amount of time to work out what I wanted this last round to be. It is after all based around your favourite pet so it had to be considerably rougher than the past rounds,” Moriarty cryptically explained as he walked behind Anderson, Sally and Lestrade just to stop at John and put his hands on his rigid shoulders, giving the soldier a tight squeeze. “But not just that, I also wanted it to be more meaningful, too show Dr. Watson here just how much you care,” he spat the last word as if it were a curse. “So I tried to come up with something that you cared about more than the good doctor,” Sherlock was having a hard time focusing on his words now which seemed to be slurring together, “And then the answer hit me. Quite obvious really, you clearly don’t have much concern for your life! That much is obvious! Your tolerance for pain is rather impressively high as well so you wouldn’t even hesitate to put yourself through the wringer for good ol’ John, but I know something you do care about. Something you use daily, something you need to easily accomplish anything!” he lowered his head a tad to look as if he were whispering into Johns ear though he said it loudly enough everyone in the room could hear, “Figure it out yet?” he stood up abruptly and let a wide grin slither onto his face, it showed far too many teeth and for some reason that detail in particular unnerved Sherlock. “Your eyes!” Sherlock felt his stomach drop as he realized what it was he was expected to do with the razor and for the first time since he had been kidnapped he felt true terror flush through him. “SO! Here are your options Sherlock dear! You wither scratch your gorgeous little eyes out with that razor blade or you give the razor to my helper over there,” he pointed to thug one, “and he takes Dr. Watsons eyes instead! What’ll it be?” In his chair John was thrashing and making as much noise as he could with the gag still firmly planted in his mouth. His eyes were desperately searching Sherlocks as if he were trying to communicate whatever he wanted to say through eye contact alone. “Here, I’ll let you phone a friend.” Moriarty said amicably as he slipped Johns gag off and behind him Sherlock felt someone (most likely thug two) take his own gag out. John spoke before Sherlock even had a chance to take a proper breath.
“Whether you know someone or not you are in no way responsible for their actions John. You couldn’t have known what was going to happen that day.”
deserved to be stuck with him as a partner. He would break up with himself if he could. “But I like you a lot. You – you’ve helped me so much. Been so kind and sweet, you deserve better than me.” John stops. He planned to say more though he didn’t know exactly what yet, but the look on her face stopped him. She looked gutted. Sad. Her eyes were redder than usual and looked irritated from crying. John was more confused then ever. Even when he tried to fix things, to do everything right he still managed to fuck everything up.
, much less ignore something as interesting as what Moriarty had offered. No, he couldn’t have done anything to change Sherlock’s reactions but he could have changed his own. He had made so many mistakes. He wasn’t there for Sherlock as much as he should have been. If he had just been there for him, if he had just let him know how much he really mattered John might still have his best friend.
John felt his face pale and he went quiet. God, he couldn’t even go through one dinner without Sherlock implanting himself in his head, could he? Everything seemed to be a Sherlock-trigger word. What was he even doing here? He knew this wasn’t going anywhere. It couldn’t. Because John was in love with his best friend, not some kind, beautiful girl who invited him to Greek restaurants.
“Hey. Starting without me?” Greg greeted and raised an eyebrow at the near empty glass clutched in John’s hand.
The first one was from Greg asking him round for a drink and company to watch the latest footie game at his place this upcoming Saturday.
“Something came up. An emergency. I’ll explain it better later. In the meantime I can be at the clinic in twenty minutes.” It’s a stretch. He knows it and Sarah, who knows how far Baker Street is from the clinic, knows it but she’s desperate and they both know that too.
“I look forward to seeing you again, John Watson.” She pulls away and without looking at him again goes to leave. After he watches her walk away and starts making the trek back to Baker Street he feels light in a way he hasn’t felt in four and a half months.
“That’s great.” She leaned in slightly, looking at him with what seemed like genuine interest but was most probably just a mask she had finely honed to seem more sincere during her therapy sessions. After all the more comfortable a person was the more likely they were too spill all their deepest thoughts to you. “Where did you go?”
John thought that the first text message would be the last he’d hear from Mindy, and it’s for that reason that he finds himself being surprised when he hears the phone ring and he see’s Mindy’s name displayed on the small screen. On instinct he goes to answer but stops himself just in time. If he ignored her text he should ignore her phone call.
if it’s true or not.” Mindy sits back in her chair and smiles at him again. Her face is still flushed and she still looks a bit shy and nervous but she seems more confident now.
“Of course. Obvious really. Want some water?” Sherlock nodded as eagerly as his sore body would allow. He was rather anxious to get the taste of manly musk and blood out of his mouth and moved to lift himself up a bit but hissed through his teeth as the skin on his back stretched even further.
He thinks of darker times. Times when it hadn’t just been lemon and gun powder dominating his smell but the sinister sharp scent of chlorine. He closes his eyes and he can see it now.
Apparently all that ended up being rather useless though. The van lurched to an abrupt halt and Sherlock felt his body slam into the side of the van, his hands tied behind his back and unable to steady himself. The doors were yanked open and two set’s of strong arms pulled him out and back onto the ground. They half-dragged and half-walked him to wherever they were taking him and he felt an involuntary smile appear on his face as he noticed one was limping and the other was sniffling, no doubt trying to stop any more blood from dribbling out of his nose. Before they got to their final destination however they stopped and took a moment to place a gag in his mouth and a heavy burlap sack over his head. Sherlock nearly laughed at the cliché.
Sarah’s voice is tight and flustered and John can picture how over worked she must be. Sarah could barely find employees to fill the slots, much less have someone come in an emergency which means she’d had to take care of all the patients herself. John couldn’t believe how quickly he had managed to fuck everything in his life up so fast.
Moriarty let out a clearly exaggerated moan as Sherlocks tongue brushed over the sensitive slit “Ah! I knew those lips would look fantastic wrapped around a cock.” Moriarty was correct in his implication that this wasn’t Sherlocks first blowjob. He had given several, mostly in Uni, and he had been told on multiple occasions that his technique was rather good. He was thankful for that now. If he tried his hardest he may be able to finish this in under ten minutes. Without any further delay he leaned forward and put as much of the shaft into his mouth as he could. He would periodically apply a strong suction and then follow it up with a swirl of his tongue following the veins and patterns on the tight skin. Jim moaned again though this time it wasn’t exaggerated. Sherlock tried to ignore the sound of his voice; it made everything so much worse. He tried to imagine that it was someone else he currently had in his mouth, maybe a nameless man he picked up in a bar or one of his flings from Uni, but guiltily his mind instead supplied an image of a short sturdy blond man wearing a disgusting wool jumper and nothing else, moaning as Sherlock took him deeper and deeper. His face actually heated up at the thought and he was suddenly extremely thankful his whole body was in such excruciating pain. The only thing worse than having to give you worst enemy a blowjob would be to get hard yourself while doing it, even if you were imagining someone else. The image of John in front of him instead of this awful man made him work even harder moving his tongue everywhere it could reach and bobbing up and down with just the barest graze of teeth, no more than a tickle. He paused slightly as a hand came to rest on his head and begin playing lightly with his curls. He wished Moriarty wouldn’t be so gentle, he wished that he would yank his hair and just fuck his face. It would be over so much quicker and would be so much less humiliating. The gentle and delicate, almost caring, touches made it even easier to imagine it was the kind army doctor in front of him as well, and Sherlock really couldn’t decide if that was a good thing or not.
He’d been completely celibate since Sherlock left and even before that he had been dating much less. John couldn’t even remember the last time somebody had touched him, and without realizing it he had become absolutely touch-starved. The feel of another persons hands kneading and scratching and caressing him was making his blood sing in his veins, and it all seemed to be flowing down to the same area.
that? John had stuck with him through a lot, even Greg had faithfully stuck with him through all of his overdoses and stints in rehab when they had met but Sherlock knew better than anyone that everyone had a breaking point. He had spent his whole life testing people’s breaking points, be it his parents, nanny’s, teachers or short-lived friendships Sherlock had always pushed everyone he knew to their breaking point. It was positively ridiculous of him to think that he wouldn’t bring John and Lestrade to their breaking points as well. It was practically inevitable.
He knows exactly what he needs, he’s just nervous to make the first step. It seems big to go back to work. He doesn’t know how he’ll react or if it will prove to be too much for him to take but he’s running out of his savings, which were already meager to begin with.
“No kidding?” Greg asks incredulously. “Hmph, come to think of it I never knew either. Seems weird really. He’s the kind of bloke that seems to do everything he can to get attention, I figured his birthday would be his favourite day of the year.”
John had personally never had an opinion. Before he hadn’t had a particularly large preference over the tube or cabs but he usually opted for the tube since it was far cheaper. Now he took the tube for a completely different reason.
John’s breath rushed in as a tiny gasp. He had never seen Sherlock cry, never anything close to it. Really, Sherlock’s emotions seemed to be limited to exhilaration and peevishness most of the time. Not this. A profound sadness filled him, as he realized just how much Sherlock must keep from, despite being Sherlock’s closest friend. How lonely that must be. How overwhelming. He instinctively reached out to take the thin shoulders gently in his hands, to prove solidarity in a decided masculine way.
John loosened his grip on Sherlock, slowly, and moved back until he was holding Sherlock’s shoulders at arm’s length. He tried to read Sherlock’s face, but his eyes were still unfocused, now pointed at the floor between John’s knees. But John noticed they were just a little sharper now. There was a ghost of an angry draw to his eyebrows. Perhaps he was starting to feel like his usual self? Hopefully. John’s mouth was dry, but he felt like he should say something. “So, ah… So you were in here because your emotions were heightened, and from the day we had I shouldn’t wonder, and…Ah fuck, this hasn’t helped, has it?” He let go of Sherlock gently, respectfully.
“Hmm,” Sherlock rumbled, the vibrations traveling into John’s chest. It was at once very comforting and deeply arousing…John snapped out of that line of thought, trying to concentrate only on Sherlock’s answer: “Deeply tired, I suppose. Calm. And also like I’m recovering from some sort of illness. It should be terrible, but it just…is.”
Sherlock didn’t have the wherewithal to understand the implications. He couldn’t even focus fully on John’s words. That wasn’t good. Focus. Fucking focus! John must have noticed the shift, because his next words were firmly stated short sentences. Walk to your chair, face it. Hands on the arm rests. Forearms on the arm rests, bend at the waist. Spread your feet. John’s voice was the only thing that still felt important until he felt John’s hand descend on his naked back.
Sherlock had been still and silent the entire cab ride home. His face had been held in a very careful, cool mask as his eyes stared straight out the window, not even tracking motion on the way past. As John led the way up the stairs to their flat, Sherlock’s mind was still buzzing with thoughts and emotions that had been with him all evening, worse now than ever and still rising. He was drowning in them, and yet as he tried to regain control over himself he realized that he couldn’t understand what was in his mind. He seemed to be keeping his thoughts from himself, blocking them out and shoving them out of sight. This was what John had been trying to tell him about, Sherlock realized. He had been suppressing things for a long time now, and now that he was trying to own them, he found that he lacked all the tools necessary.
John believed Sherlock when he said that nothing would come of the knife. He took a deep breath and looked into himself, taking stock of his mental and physical symptoms. The knife had certainly heightened his awareness of everything around him, every detailed sharpened to an almost-uncomfortable clarity. His body had tensed up as it readied a defense, and as he forced his muscles to relax, there was a special ‘playing with fire’ sort of rush to it. John knew that by relaxing, he was slowing his potential reaction time should anything happen with the knife. But he trusted Sherlock, and the knife was on the other side of the room anyway. He felt himself slip into that thick, addicting, heady arousal that can come from facing danger head on.
John tried to simply absorb what he was hearing, without judgement or too much emotion. He spoke up to clarify, “And…and hurting yourself does that, does it?” This time there was no vocal answer from Sherlock. Instead of words, he simply let out a sigh and relaxed a bit more, at this point relying completely on John to hold him up.
“This isn’t about to be a lesson about coping skills, Sherlock,” John was saying. “I’m not trying to change your emotions or what feels like the truth to you. This is just the pain that you’re obviously desperate for.”
John’s exhausted body sprang to action, his arm already reaching for the tissue box next to the bed before his mind could decipher what Sherlock had said. He snatched a tissue and delivered it just in time before Sherlock’s hand and head whipped back down violently. The detective groaned as his whole body hunched in on itself, shuddering. John watched, fascinated, as he spiked the tissue into the bin next to the bed, and then collapsed across John’s legs as if his strings had been cut. His cheek rested on John’s thigh, harsh breaths stirring the sparse leg hair.
John stiffened a bit, but accepted the apology. “Thank you. I think you’re right on all counts, Sherlock. I think you have a lot of work to do, but I believe you’ll honestly work at it now.” He bent down and gave Sherlock a kiss, brief but with no reservations. “Go to bed now.”
That explanation was defeated by Sherlock’s calmly stated response, “You either need to do that again, or leave now and forget what you saw.” John’s thought process shot apart in a million different directions. He began to panic almost immediately, his mind flailing for the right response, when a fear of losing Sherlock forever lose to the surface. That clinched it and before John knew what he had decided, he had struck Sherlock across the other cheek.
John went methodically over Sherlock’s neck and shoulders, much as Sherlock had done to his feet, until he was satisfied. He forced his hands to leave Sherlock’s skin, much as he didn’t want to, and he sat back once more into the plush couch back. It was his job to maintain boundaries still, and that was something John took very seriously. For his part, Sherlock took the end of the massage with dignity and acceptance, simply shrugging his shoulders back into his robe and then leaning his head gently against the inside of John’s knee.
John waited (how long? Three seconds? Thirty?) before bringing his palm against Sherlock’s other cheek. Harder. Sherlock couldn’t have held in his moan of “haaah” if he had tried. Both impact sites were already flushing, warm and tingling and almost itchy. And it fucking hurt. The blows then came steadily, roughly five seconds apart.
John didn’t expect to feel so dwarfed by the long body that climbed up over his, long limbs draping across and around him. Sherlock’s cheek found a new home against John’s chest. Feeling a little silly, John dropped a kiss to the top of his head. So what if he felt a little small? He also felt cherished, and protected.
John was startled by his own thoughts reprimanding him as he watched Sherlock stretch: Oh my God, don’t look at his body. He’s naked. His arse is turning red because I hit him, I hurt Sherlock. But of course John was looking at Sherlock’s body. He couldn’t stop himself. He couldn’t help but notice that yes, what he had noticed about Sherlock earlier was an erection. And then Sherlock had turned the water off, and turned to face him. John blurted out, “Is sex always tied up in this?” A blush began creeping over his cheeks as he tried to recover, “I mean, your…I just…”
It was funny, the two men hadn’t addressed what had transpired between them, and yet there was nothing uncomfortable about that silence. In fact, they had been acting more comfortable with each other. The air was cleared, and that had been good enough for now. Every evening they had settled down in the living room together, sometimes in their own chairs with the fire going, and sometimes on the same couch with their thighs touching. One night, they had ended up under the same blanket. There was a happy, comfortable progression taking place, if very slowly.
“And you neglected to clue me in, breaking your promise to me, and instead went off to cut yourself up.”
He opened his mouth to beg for mercy, but instead what he pleaded for was “More, John, oh god please more.” Once the words were out, Sherlock realized that he meant it. Even as he wished desperately for respite, he craved more, harder, faster, everything. Anything.
Sherlock gasped, but showed no signs of struggle as the impact site blanched, then slowly filled in with pink. Emboldened, John rained down five more hard blows all at once, until the accumulated pain spilled over Sherlock’s threshold and he finally cried out wordlessly. This sudden sound startled John, and he was hit all at once with a sober kind of guilt. Oh God, he thought, I’m hitting Sherlock. I’m causing him physical pain. On purpose. Horrified, John pulled away from Sherlock and began to speak, “I…Uh, Sherlock, I- “
The word failure rang through Sherlock’s head. It strengthened his sense of shame, his embarrassment and the feeling of being trapped. It got louder and louder and he tried to ignore it but his chest was getting tighter and-
Beyond embarrassment or the feeling of failure, Sherlock realized that he now in this moment felt understood. He felt seen and accepted by John, he felt safe and taken care of. Usually there would have been a sense of deep shame, of burdening John with this so soon after the last event, but there were facts to examine. The facts told Sherlock that this had been what he failed to do yesterday. Because of his failure to follow protocol put in place for his own safety, John had punished Sherlock. John’s actions told Sherlock, much as he was hesitant to believe, that this is what John wanted Sherlock to do. He wanted Sherlock to turn to him in times of need. This was deeply uncomfortable to Sherlock, as he had prided himself on being more or less independent since childhood and he was startled to find himself relying on anyone. He felt uncertain, to be sure, but was surprised and relieved to find that he did not feel guilty by turning to John.
“John,” Oh shit, that sounded like he was in trouble. “After all that you’ve learned about me recently, I would hope that you feel comfortable in asking for what you really like. My asking was really a formality, I don’t see why you couldn’t just ask for an element of danger.” His voice had been so flippant. John was fucking baffled. Or…maybe he wasn’t. Huh. The clarity sort of seeped over John, feeling truer than words ever could. Sherlock was peering into his eyes, but John didn’t have an answer beyond biting his lower lip and meeting that gaze.
Sherlock tried to focus on the structure of John’s ligaments and muscles, on the form of the bones that propelled the doctor through his daily life. There was a sense of order here, and it was calming to get lost in naming the anatomical parts while cataloging the small shifts and noises coming from John. Sherlock knew he was keeping his Captain-esque composure up for Sherlock’s sake, and he appreciated it. He appreciated the affection of the gentle head massage as well. Sherlock could still feel it, the overwhelming and vague force that had been there when he woke up. The foreboding feeling that had been at once familiar and yet unexamined and unknown, and therefore terrifying. Sherlock Holmes did not run from such things, he faced them head on stubbornly and bravely. But he had failed when he tried that approach before with this particular beast. It clouded his judgement, he knew that. And now John knew that as well. They were both aware that Sherlock was here, at John’s feet, because it had showed up again and Sherlock had not sought his own release but had run to John for structure and protection.
My goodness, I've been going THROUGH it. 2018, huh? What a year. You can probably tell from the content shift that I'm personally in a much healthier place. This work continues to be a very personal reflection, and honestly I'm not sure if I'll continue it. Maybe a fun lil epilogue story. Really, like when I first posted part one, I suppose it'll be up to the response. Hopefully if this resonates with you, you can find some reassurance and understanding in this series. Love ya, mwuah
Sherlock gasped roughly as John abruptly tightened his grip on Sherlock’s curls, keeping the tension up until Sherlock’s fingers started moving again. He hadn’t realized he had stopped. John let up on his hold and sat back in the couch, leaving Sherlock to carefully and lovingly replace the slipper on the foot he found himself embarrassingly compelled to kiss. He resisted the urge. As Sherlock repeated the process on John’s other foot, this time sans head massage, he found himself sobering up in a way. John’s intervention had jolted him from his thoughts and Sherlock put effort into maintaining that newfound clear-headedness.
Only one sound was different from the rest, spoken so softly that John wasn't sure if he was meant to hear it.
Sherlock seemed confused but did as he was told, snuggling his back up to the couch between John’s legs, crossing his own long legs. His arse stung when he put his body weight on it, but orders were orders. When John slid one of his slippered feet into Sherlock’s lap, sole side up, Sherlock patiently waited until he received further instructions. He didn’t have long to wait. “Use the lotion, Sherlock, I rather fancy a foot rub.”
“Fuuuuck, Sherlock…” John was overwhelmed by sensation for a moment, his entire world narrowed to just that light touch. Then Sherlock grazed his lips back and forth, spreading the slick precome. His lips became shiny with it, which looked absolutely sinful. John closed his eyes to properly burn that image forever into his memory. Two weeks ago, this would have been impossible to imagine. Now, impossible to forget. John felt Sherlock’s mouth slowly, so slowly, slide over him, taking him in. John’s breath stuttered in. Fuck.
Upon finding himself alone at last in a deserted bathroom and safely in the largest stall, Sherlock brought out the case of razor blades he hadn’t known why he grabbed that morning. It was in his hand and he was staring at it when John had burst into the bathroom, calling his name. Sherlock had felt a flare of anger, and snapped, “What?” John had seemed to hesitate at the aggression, perhaps second-guessing himself. There was a sound of shifting clothing as Sherlock realized that John was stooping to see where he was in the stall. Fuck. He was nowhere near the toilet, and facing the wrong way.
Something very like defiance flashed in Sherlock’s eyes at the prospect of a challenge, leaving behind an intent sort of heat. Wordlessly, he finally unfolded his body from itself and set to work unbuckling John’s belt. John had to briefly squeeze his eyes shut against the rush of blood to his groin, urgently instructing himself that now was not the time to get excited. Not yet. He felt the belt slide out from around his body and opened his eyes again in time to watch Sherlock take the belt from his trousers entirely, double it over on itself, and extend it back toward John. His eyes never left John’s face. Clearly, Sherlock felt that he had risen to the challenge, and was now issuing John a challenge in return.
”I…” Sherlock hesitated, then gasped as John struck him again. He locked eyes with his reflection, seeming to issue a challenge to himself as he blurted out, “I am allowed to feel pain.” He quickly averted his eyes from his own gaze, as if afraid of finding judgement there. John shifted his stance behind Sherlock, caressing the belt up and down his bare back for a moment.
Sherlock’s hand remained where it was as he responded in a small voice, “I don’t want to, John. I mean, I do, but…I’m so torn.” His voice wavered a bit as he added, “I need you to help me, please.”
Confusion and anger exploded in John before he got control over them, carefully wrestled back behind his tight façade. He knew that showing too much of what he was feeling would overwhelm Sherlock, push him into a corner. But God, how could Sherlock have put him in this situation? If some anger showed, perhaps that was good. He needed to know. But John had watched the struggle on Sherlock’s face, and there had been no malice in his answer, no aggression. Just a statement of truth, without backing down and hiding from it. At least he was being truthful now. And that look in Sherlock’s eyes. Once the cold mask had fallen away, John could see the plea evident in his eyes. It was like Sherlock was being consumed, lost in it.
”Sherlock,” John intoned in a stern voice, “Open your eyes.” When his order was followed, he clarified, “Look at yourself, Sherlock. You’re being hit with a belt, and you’re trying not to show pain. You do know that’s ridiculous, don’t you?” He brought the belt hard against Sherlock’s arse again, watching in the mirror as his eyes flinched but stayed open. “I know that this hurts, Sherlock, I’m causing that on purpose. You don’t have to put on a brave face for me, I know what you’re feeling! I’m the one doing it to you, remember?”
Before Sherlock could even ask, John explained, “Sherlock, I…I want to do this. For you. And I think maybe for myself, too? Oh hell, I don’t know what I’m feeling, Sherlock. I just…Can we just leave it like this for tonight?” He drew his arms tighter around Sherlock. “I like being close to you, I know that. Later tonight I’ll go for a walk and figure things out on my end, but I like helping you. I like…I like keeping you safe. Even from yourself.” John laughed a little at that as if to soften it, but both men knew the hard truth of the matter.
“I have hurt myself in the field.” The tone was terse, but John didn’t take it personally. He knew it was a difficult thing to say out loud. Fuck, though, to think that Sherlock had ever been in such pain that he couldn’t even wait for the relative privacy of his own home…Had John been with him on these occasions? Had he missed it? Fuck. John’s heart ached intensely.
John had meant it as a joke to lighten the mood, but Sherlock immediately replied with a flat, “Among other things.”
“This is what’s going to happen, Sherlock. You’re going to pick one of the emotions that overwhelmed you today, and you’re going to walk me through what happened when you felt it.” Sherlock’s eyes widened, but he didn’t say anything. “I’ll be here, just listening. I want you to know that you can say anything to me, ok? Anything. I won’t run.”
John gently ran his fingertips over Sherlock’s ear, continuing the movement to infiltrate Sherlock’s thick, dark hair. He was careful to keep the movement casual and soft, until he reached the nape of Sherlock’s neck. John’s hand sprang like a trap, grabbing a handful of the beautiful hair that he had wanted to touch for so long (Wait, really? That was news to John…Or rather, it wasn’t, was it?) and tightening his fist around it. The moan forced from Sherlock’s throat jolted down John’s spine, and he forced himself to focus.
Sherlock took in a long, deep breath, then gave a soft sigh before closing his eyes. “I was frustrated today,” he began slowly, seeming to weigh his words more than usual. John noted with pride that Sherlock’s voice was only slightly guarded, and noticeably steadier than John would have expected under these circumstances. As silent praise and encouragement, he moved his hands up Sherlock’s head until he could gently massage his temples with his thumbs. The tiny circular movements seemed to ease some of the tightness in the detective’s brow as he continued.
John lifted his eyes to meet Sherlock’s, but the taller man tore his hand out of John’s grip and took a step back, arms wrapping protectively around himself. He repeated himself, “Get out,” although there was no force behind the words this time. They were spoken softly, as Sherlock’s gaze rapidly became glued to the tile floor of the bathroom. His gaze became unfocused, taking in everything but seeing nothing.
John was terrified. Give him an active battleground with wounded to attend to any day over this. That, he would be familiar with. This, on the other hand, was completely new territory with no rules of combat. If this were combat, what would the next move be? The answer came to him: recon. Gather information. That was going to be difficult, and take tact. John desperately did not want to spook Sherlock. He had never seen Sherlock like this before, and didn’t want to make it worse.
John felt instantly emboldened by Sherlock’s response. He gripped a bit tighter with both hands, one holding his detective in place and the other stimulating him. All of John’s movements were at a moderate pace, maddeningly so, but the saving grace was the strength hinted at by his firm grip. There was a carefully controlled power there, one that Sherlock at once respected and wanted to pry at, hoping to have it unleashed on himself. Before Sherlock could begin to devise a plan to provoke just that, John released his grip on all that thick hair and broke their kiss, immediately returning to the spot on Sherlock’s neck where he had bitten perhaps a bit too hard. There was already an angry red mark there, one that would almost certainly become a bruise. In for a penny, John mused to himself before biting down again on the same spot.
Sherlock’s stomach dropped as he looked with new sobriety on his actions earlier. Why the fuck had he grabbed the case of razor blades? Why the fuck hadn’t he said anything, anything at all to John? Not for the first time, Sherlock felt afraid of his past actions. They weren’t as logical as they had felt at the time. Now he could see the reality, why? Because of pain? Because he had orgasmed? Did he really need John just to be able to see clearly? That thought was utterly terrifying, and unacceptable. It made him feel helpless. He felt a new kind of tremble in his body, not the weakness of climax or the instinctual urges to escape this pain. It was fear. Quieter than he meant to by far, Sherlock managed to breathe out, “John?”
As soon as they had cleared the threshold, Sherlock slammed the door shut and crowded John against it with such force that the back of John’s head bounced off the door. He laughed softly in surprise but embraced the situation he found himself in, melting into the kisses that Sherlock pressed urgently into his lips. The faint throb from the back of his head felt like a trophy, earned and cherished. It was all John could do to return the kisses as Sherlock undressed him with a speed and precision that suggested that he had been forming a battle plan while they had been on the couch. John smiled against those dear lips. Brilliant.
“Alright. Well, I agree that this sort of thing won’t work in the field. We’ll work out some other protocol, yeah? I’m not sure what it will be yet, but I’ll be there with you. All you need to do is clue me in, and we’ll face it then and there, together. I promise.”
Sighing in gentle relief, the detective carefully removed the slipper from John’s foot, placing it respectfully next to himself on the floor and rubbing some lotion between his hands to warm it before smoothing it onto the sole of John’s foot. John’s lips quirked as he suppressed any ticklish reaction he might have. He was glad that Sherlock couldn’t see his face in this moment. Once Sherlock’s deft fingers moved with a little more confidence John let his hand drift to Sherlock’s scalp, rewarding and comforting with a light massage of his own. He was careful not to distract Sherlock’s efforts, however. He knew how delicate things still were at this early, uncertain time.
John waited, but no further response came. He was at once encouraged by Sherlock talking and frustrated by the vague words. “But…why, though? What does hurting yourself accomplish?” He hated hearing those words out loud, hated that he had to ask that question of his closest friend.
Sherlock did look up then, catching John’s gaze for a moment. There was a carefully controlled desperation in his eyes. John’s gut clenched for a moment, hating to see his dear detective in any kind of pain…But Sherlock needed him to be strong. So he would be. He stayed still and quiet, waiting until Sherlock spread his palms briefly in surrender and rasped out something that sounded like, “Please just be in charge of me for a while.”
“It,” Sherlock began, in the same small voice. Then he stopped, and inhaled slowly. It was maddening. He let it out, and tried again in a voice just a bit stronger. “It’s complicated. I believe it’s best explained like a reset button. For my brain.” His voice was deadpan and cold, and just a little bored. It was closer to the Sherlock John knew and…loved, he supposed. In a friend’s way. “For emotions, especially. Useless things, anyway…They get in the way and distract me, and it’s overwhelming. I have to get away from that, in order to think.”
”John-“ The protest was interrupted by a whimper as the belt landed again. “Expecting myself to feel nothing is harmful.” Another blow, again repeating where it had just been. Sherlock’s voice began to waiver, but his eye contact with his reflection had remained firm and challenging despite the tears beginning to form. He finished dutifully, “To myself and others.”
”Knowing your own boundaries, even as they change, is so important.” John slowly moved his hands down to Sherlock’s hips once more, guiding him to turn and face John. Sherlock’s eyes were open and vulnerable, and shining trails down his cheeks betrayed him. John took that darling face between his hands again and drew Sherlock down for a kiss. It was the gentlest kiss that John could deliver, trying to communicate with the slow, soft pressure what tenderness and care was reserved just for him, if only he would allow it. Sherlock returned the kiss with a tight sort of desperation, making a sad sound against John’s lips before schooling himself into a more sedate pace.
Seeming to respond favorably to the military brusqueness, Sherlock tried to nod in response. Being reminded that he couldn’t move his head sent a new rush of blood to his already-throbbing cock. Perhaps John felt this sensation too, because he simultaneously leaned in to gently kiss Sherlock’s captive mouth and reached down with his other hand to wrap his fingers around Sherlock’s cock, meaning to be gentle but radiating possessiveness instead. The sudden touch wrenched a surprised whimper from Sherlock, muffled by John’s lips, and his hands shot to the damp hem of his dress shirt, desperate for something to hold. Afraid that John would doubt his own boldness, Sherlock slowly rolled his hips once, his breath hitching as every sensitive inch of him dragged along John’s hand.
One long-fingered hand grasped John’s chin delicately, and he let Sherlock move his head to the side until he was looking at the knife, still across the room on the dresser. When a smaller rush of adrenaline arrived, John was ready for it, riding it into that heightened state with more excitement than he had expected. Okay…This was good. This was really good. His cock was suddenly full again, more so than before. Fucking Sherlock…Sometimes it paid off to have a boyfriend who can (not actually) read your mind.
Pride swelled up inside of John before he could temper it, reminding himself to be very gentle with these beginning stages. Relapse was a very real possibility, and John didn’t want to set either of them up for failure. “Sherlock, that’s a good sign, that’s the proper way of feeling emotions and then letting them go. I don’t mean to sound condescending-“ Alright, but it was a bit like giving him a taste of his own medicine, wasn’t it- “but I do want to stress that this is what’s healthy and normal. You feel them, you learn from them, and then you let them float off.”
And yet, John was here, staring at him in a manner of authority. Sherlock realized that they were in the flat, the door to the hall shut and bolted already. He shifted his body posture to loosely mimic John’s, crossing his arms and widening his stance just a bit. Now was the time to determine how to handle this- trust John and face consequences, or stand up for himself. But if he tried to defend his actions, what would he even say? Before he could lay out any line of defense, John took a step toward him.
Sherlock, however, didn’t seem to notice the bump in the conversation. “Exactly,” he remarked dryly. He seemed to find a sort of bravery to elaborate, and his voice hardened a bit as he explained, “I know that I can’t fucking trust myself. Obviously. I can, generally, trust other people’s morals to control their actions. In essence, to keep me safe while I get what I need.”
Satisfied, he nodded and whispered, “I believe you,” before swinging the belt up and across Sherlock’s arse at a velocity that while not outright painful certainly would feel shocking. Sherlock’s eyes snapped closed and his mouth set into a thin line, but otherwise didn’t respond. Even his fingers remained arched gently over the countertop instead of clawed against it, carefully not showing distress. John swung the belt three more times in rapid succession, a little harder each time. The loud sounds, a cross between a smack and a thud,  filled the small bathroom, and was a bit overwhelming if John was perfectly honest with himself. Sherlock still didn’t respond.
“I…” Sherlock hesitated, then forced himself on, “I don’t get to choose, John. It’s how my body reacts sometimes, I did warn you.” He felt his shoulders hunch in slightly, trying to shrink into something that couldn’t be perceived as combative.
Instantly swallowed up in sensations, John marveled at the softness of Sherlock’s lips. Those lips were gently returning his pressure, giving and receiving small kisses…Slow and hesitant at first, no lingering contact. Gradually, the pace quickened until brief kisses blended into each other into longer, more passionate kisses. The breathing of both men became faster. John aggressively moved closer to Sherlock, who remained wonderfully pliant and vulnerable. Breaking away from Sherlock’s mouth, John immediately dove for Sherlock’s long, pale neck, kissing and nipping at it possessively. There was a sense of ownership growing in John’s mind along the lines of, if I can claim him, I can protect him. I can keep him safe…from himself.
Sherlock gasped as he was moved quickly, but his body remained pliant. He caught himself with straight arms against the porcelain of the tub floor as he was lowered. Water from the shower, still running warm, played with his hair and ran gently down one side of his face. The front of Sherlock’s hip bones had hit the side of the tub, and he was acutely aware of a small, sharp pain caused by the force to his recent cut. His pants had been loosely arranged around his hips to begin with, and now with all this movement…they were around his knees, puddled on the tile floor. When John had first entered the bathroom, Sherlock had felt vulnerable and exposed. Now, he realized, that had been nothing.
Eight more minutes went by before Sherlock called out an answer in annoyance when the contestant seemed stuck. John chuckled at the sudden but dear interruption, and unconsciously gave the detective’s damp hair a few pets. He realized what he was doing and paused for a moment, taking in Sherlock’s reaction to the physical affection, but if anything, the head on his shoulder leaned a little harder. John smiled to himself and continued the gentle stroking. The curls were starting to dry and become defined at this point, and he was careful not to break their spirals. It reminded John of that first night in the bathroom. He had stroked Sherlock’s hair then, too, and hadn’t they both seemed to enjoy it then, too? John tucked that bit of information away, savoring the silky, bouncy feeling of the curls as he initiated verbal contact.
He felt the warmth of Sherlock’s mouth leave his body, replaced by rough, warm breaths. John lifted his head to see Sherlock’s face, pinched a bit in concentration, about three inches from his too-sensitive skin. Sherlock had picked up the pace on his own body, and his breath came out even rougher. Maybe a little pained. Fucking Jesus fucking Christ…Watching the pace become punishing, John had the presence of mind to worry if Sherlock was going too hard and too fast with no lube.
Doing as he was told, Sherlock walked nude through the flat to his bedroom. He felt exposed in a way that he never did naked, and he wasn’t sure what to make of it. Did he have to make anything out of it tonight? Honestly, all Sherlock wanted now was sleep. He felt used up, utterly exhausted. One last stop before bed, though: Sherlock stopped in front of his mirror and looked over his shoulder at his reflection, admiring the proof of John’s care across his skin. The colors standing out against the pale canvass were beautiful to him, even as it still throbbed and stung. Every blow to his backside had been given to save him from himself, to snap him back to reality. Who else would do that for him but John? Who else would he want to? Who would he let see him like this? No, now that he had tasted this with John, nothing else would do.
John knew that the afterglow had to come to an end sometime, but he was still a bit disappointed when Sherlock drew a breath in, then spoke in a voice very close to normal.
Sherlock sighed. “What happens when this situation arises in the field? We can’t just drop everything and lock ourselves in a closet for a quick flog and shag session, let alone a full therapy session.”
“Don’t,” came John’s terse reply immediately. “Just don’t, don’t fucking joke, Sherlock!” His voice gained volume with each word, yelling the other’s name. “This is not something you joke about! This is…” His voice lowered as he hesitated, “This is…”
“Ahh,” Sherlock moaned, sounding frustrated, “It hurts, John.” Sherlock’s eyes had moved to John’s face reflected in the mirror, and there was a naked sort of pleading in them. All at once he seemed to be encouraging John, and asking for encouragement in return. He wanted to be allowed to acknowledge things, he wanted to be praised for it instead of rejected. John read his expression in a moment and nodded curtly to Sherlock’s reflection.
Damn. John Watson, on the verge of sleep, had just reminded himself that he had not brushed his teeth before bed. Damn, damn, damn! He tried to tell himself that it didn’t really matter, not one night, but the soldier in him screamed against this breach of protocol. Even one night was unacceptable, a falter in personal hygiene was unbecoming of a military man! John sighed heavily into his pillow, knowing that this issue wouldn’t settle in his mind until he just bit the bullet and did the damn thing. He groaned loudly and shoved himself up and out of bed. His vision was just a bit blurry from being pushed into a pillow only moments before, but that was no matter. He could, and often did, find his way to the bathroom in the dark.
John didn’t even notice Sherlock’s weight because his mind was racing. Taking in the information, weighing different options, trying to formulate what his next words would be. Without fully thinking out the next strategy, John let words flow from his mind freely. He just had an urgent need to keep communication going, and was as surprised as Sherlock was to hear himself ask, “Does it have to be you?”
Sherlock stood up and let the blanket fall to the floor, suddenly nude and radiating confidence. It was a stark contrast from the silent form who had been cocooned in the blanket just minutes before, and honestly, it was shockingly attractive. The sudden rush of blood to John’s cock staggered him for a moment before he realized that Sherlock had grabbed his hand. Sherlock pulled his captive behind him, striding purposefully toward his own bedroom, and John was bemusedly content to let himself be dragged.
It had been a long, frustrating day (and half the night, to be honest) of chasing dead-ends in their current case. Endless cab rides, talking to nothing but unhelpful people, and truly horrible Chinese food to top it all off. John’s feet ached as he pulled off his shoes on his way to bedroom, limping in a way he didn’t like to notice. It was only because of the excessive amount of walking that day, he assured himself. A damned lot of walking. Not liking the way that dark mood hung on his shoulders, John ever-the-soldier Watson addressed himself firmly: let the frustrating, horrid, exhausting case go for tonight. Sleep now.
Third, right on the heels of the others, came the thought of ‘He’s got a razor blade.’ This was accompanied by a feeling of being punched in the gut. John didn’t understand yet, but he had enough information, in just a few seconds, to be on high alert. And afraid. And then the final piece of information: There was a series of thin lines of scabbing on the inside of Sherlock’s left hipbone. And a few scars, impossibly white against the paleness of Sherlock’s skin. And a fresh cut, in line with the others, an angry red line with just a hint of movement as a tiny amount of blood seeped to the surface. John’s doctor/soldier-mind identified it as shallow and minor, an automatic triage process. John’s John-mind, however, stopped dead. His body stilled, imitating Sherlock, and his breathing seemed to lock up.
sick he is of people acting like they know all about him. He feels his gut clench painfully and sweat prickle his hairline and eyebrow. He feels like he’s going to throw up any minute but he
“Option one, as you know, is to take that little razor blade and use it to scratch your eyes out, which I admit isn’t entirely appealing. Option two is to hand the blade over to the big fella next to you and he’ll take Dr. Watsons eyes instead and option three,” he pointed down to the patch of ground in front of him. “Get on your knees, crawl over here, and show daddy some love,” his smile after he was finished speaking was nothing short of lecherous and Sherlock felt equal parts disgust and rage fill him. Rage at Moriarty for managing to humiliate him so completely and disgust at both Moriarty for deciding on an option so foul and himself for playing right into the consulting criminals hands.
“Well, good.” John nods. “I - thank you. For answering me honestly. And for what you did earlier. It didn’t go unappreciated. And for what it’s worth, I swear that the next time we see Moriarty I’m going to bloody
“Yeah, he got here same time as us, nosy git. Immediately made sure you got this room.” John said this with a twist of amusement.
With a last breath of encouragement he peeled himself of the cozy chair and padded slowly towards the bathroom. He splashed his face with some icy cold water, hoping to make his body feel slightly more invigorated and less like a walking corpse. He hadn’t had  a proper sleep in weeks and it showed all throughout his body. His clothes were loose from having lost a significant amount of weight and he hadn’t shaved in a long time. He looked haggard. He sighed. God, what did a pretty young thing like Mindy even see in a dried up old thing like him? He looked at himself in the mirror and decided he should really change before he left. He was hardly dressed in date attire and with his utter lack of self-care lately he could use all the help he could get. He left the bathroom and headed to his own bedroom but found himself pausing outside of Sherlock’s room. He stopped and just stared for a moment at Sherlock’s closed door.
“Mind if we get a bit more water?” John asked politely and held the empty cup out for the boy to take. The nurse nodded and flipped his black fringe out of his eyes as he took the cup.
Hey there! Wow. Finally. I know this took forever to update but the procrastination bug got ahold of me, lol. I really hope you find the comfort part of this fic satisfying. It took me forever to write but I'm really happy with how it turned out. Thanks so much to everyone who read it or left kudos or comments! Every time I get one of those it makes my day :)
to hear me talk about him much. Except for nosy gits who want to know if the papers are true or not. Or reporters who want to
“You’re bloody sick in the head.” Johns voice was full of so much venom and rage it nearly made Sherlock flinch even though it wasn’t directed towards him.
He sincerely hoped he had remembered to buy more ibuprofen, Lord knows he needed it now. He looked in the cupboards and it turned out he had thankfully managed to buy two new packets from Tesco his last shopping trip (though he’d already gone through about half the first pack).
“You were dealt a completely crap situation and went through all that shit to protect us, and I’m sorry. I’m sorry you went through that and I’m sorry I didn’t do anything to help you. I should have done more, done
“Of course I did,” Sherlock looked at John like he was talking nonsense, a well-worn look. “Who else would I,
, what a sight he was then, creamy thighs spread, arse exposed. John’s horny brain wanted nothing more than to push into that plush arse and thrust. He knew of course that wouldn’t be good for anyone though, and instead ran his hands up and down Sherlock’s sides, kissing his spine.
“Alright,” John removed his fingers, Sherlock inhaled sharply. He shifted, arse up, and John rose on his knees a little to get into position.
Now half naked, John sat up on his elbows to watch Sherlock because he’d be damned if he missed a second of this. Sherlock’s eyes roved over John’s body, unabashed in his appreciation. John had never felt so desired in his entire life. For that moment, he forgot about his eyebags and grey hair and soft belly.
Sherlock moved to tilt John’s face up to meet his. His eyes glinted mischievously, but without malice. Without really meaning to, their lips met, and they kissed once, long and deep. Still, they didn’t move apart.
. Bracing himself on his forearms, he captured Sherlock’s lips, the man moaned into his mouth as he kissed back.
Two things he noticed right away: something suspicious boiling on the stove, and Sherlock, seated at the table, bent over his microscope. He didn’t look up, didn’t acknowledge John’s presence in the least, just turned the little knobs with his ridiculously long fingers.
One sleepless night after the incidents with Irene Adler, he’d found the Woman’s words echoing through his ears.
Collapsing on the other man, he buried his head in Sherlock’s collarbone as the aftershocks came and went. Hands were caressing his back, running through his hair.
Sherlock pouted then, probably about to accuse John of performing a social nicety, a meaningless platitude. Meanwhile, John wanted nothing more than to kiss those impossibly soft lips again, hear those keen moans. He licked his own lips without meaning to and Sherlock’s eyes darted there, then up to his eyes. This time, he held John’s stare. John felt the familiar, somehow comforting, sensation of being analyzed.
“Yes. Maybe. I’m…” he took a breath, “to be perfectly honest, John, I haven’t done,” vague hand gesture, “this before.”
That man was looking at him strangely now, and John realized he had been staring a little. Examining every inch of Sherlock, taking it in. His soft frown, his porcelain skin, his piercing eyes. Beautiful.
John then was overcome with an urge to touch. He let the urge rule him for once, reaching to cup Sherlock’s right cheek. “You think I’m not? I’m bloody terrified right now.” The other man’s eyes fluttered closed as John made contact, head tilting slightly to lean into him. This was all too much for John’s incredibly human heart.
When he felt like he could breath again, he slowly eased himself out of Sherlock’s arse, knowing the sheets were going to be filthy after this, not giving a single damn.
He poured the steaming water into two mugs. He put the mugs on the table. He pulled out the chair right next to Sherlock, the creak the loudest thing he’d ever heard in his life, and sat down, facing the other man. Sherlock’s eyes flicked over to him, then back to his “work.”
Sherlock obeyed. John climbed over him, and they were face to face. Sherlock was blushing again. The soft morning light caressed Sherlock’s features, making him look young and innocent, yet older and wiser beyond his years, a beautiful product of his painful past. John kissed his forehead, his left eye, his right. Sherlock’s arms slowly came to embrace John by the waist, and then they were kissing. It was slow, deliberate, it was everything.
But better those than the tender, pining thoughts he had whenever the lamplight illuminated the laugh lines around Sherlock’s eyes. Or when Sherlock took a second to make sure John was alright after a physical altercation. Or when Sherlock knew by the tenor of John’s footsteps up the stairs when the clinic had been particularly tough, so he would start the kettle boiling for tea before John even got through the front door. Moments that John saw what he considered to be the “real” Sherlock, not the man in the papers or at the Yard, made it particularly tough to ignore his own feelings. Even worse, these moments tried to trick him into believing that Sherlock could maybe reciprocate.
John grinned. “Sherlock Holmes admitting he isn’t an expert on something? I’ll have to alert the papers.”
Then, Sherlock was demanding John’s mouth, kissing him with an intensity he had never felt before, John’s system felt as if it would short circuit any second. But John held on, fingers seeking out the ties to Sherlock’s robe, pushing the damned thing off his broad shoulders.
“Yes,” Sherlock hissed, and then, John was completely seated inside Sherlock. “John,” he moaned lengthily. “
Large hands ran up and down John’s thighs, and Sherlock lowered his head as John unconsciously held his breath. A wet, warm tongue was now licking a stripe up John’s length, from root to tip, and he felt his breath come quicker. Sherlock sucked at the tip of his cock experimentally, and John shuddered. Then, in true Sherlock style, he did something a little unexpected; he buried his nose in John’s wiry hair at the base of his cock and breathed in deeply, hands contracting around John’s thighs.
A faint nose came from the kitchen, pots and pans being moved from the stovetop to the sink. This wasn’t remarkable either. John woke up to seemingly innocent noises that came from the kitchen most mornings.
Sherlock complied, attempting to slow his breaths as John popped the lid of the lube, putting some on his fingers. He kissed down Sherlock’s back, down to the small of it, then just above his hole. He replaced his lips with a slick finger, stroking up and down the rim, feeling how tight it was. Sherlock began to squirm a little, and John steadied him with a hand on his right hip.
Tilting his head, he looked up at Sherlock, who was… smiling. Not that Sherlock never smiled, but John had never seen the man so quietly content. He pulled John close, and John sighed, wrapping his arms around Sherlock as well. They lay like that, tangled up in each other, for a minute or two. John could feel Sherlock’s every breath, could hear his heartbeat slow down to pump at its natural rhythm. This, he decided, was truly bliss.
“Tea?” John tentatively turned his head in the direction of his flatmate, who nodded. John made himself look away. Sherlock, as usual, was a study in neutrality. John couldn’t tell what the man was thinking, be it love, hate, or indifference. Well, two could (attempt) to play that game. John turned on the left burner, doing his best to ignore both the other occupant of the stove and the other occupant of the flat.
“Well, on that we agree,” Sherlock frowned but John continued, “That I don’t understand why you would want me either, you git.”
“Oh, Christ,” John cursed again as Sherlock swirled his tongue around the head. Sherlock moaned around his cock, and
They then laid without speaking, listening to the sounds of the city outside, the quiet inhales and exhales, the beats of each other’s hearts. Sherlock’s slow breathing began to lull John to sleep. His eyes started to close involuntarily, and though he didn’t want to miss a moment of this, he felt himself dozing off.
But now, with his hand in his friend’s hair and the morning light warm upon his back, John wasn’t trying to push his inner romantic away. It was hard enough trying not to get pushed over the edge with Sherlock sucking and licking his cock into oblivion.
Then John accidentally met Sherlock’s hips with his own. Their lengths brushed against each other, and the men gasped.
“Fuck,” John said involuntarily. Sherlock’s fingers dug into John’s thighs in response and then he, meeting John’s eyes, slowly took in a good length of John’s cock into his mouth.
He rubbed his eyes, turning to look at the unoccupied pillow next to him. There was still a little indentation where another’s head had been less than an hour ago, or maybe several hours ago. John couldn’t be sure, deducing wasn’t his job. He reached out to feel the bedsheet- no, it was cold. That must mean… what did that mean?
Sherlock huffed indignantly as John laughed, coaxing Sherlock’s pout into a small smile with a quick kiss.
had felt. They hadn’t even spoken about it, it had just… happened. He’d felt as if he couldn’t stop, even for a moment, because then it might never happen. He’d felt as if a great weight had been lifted from his chest and shed onto the floor, like his jacket and trousers. He’d felt as if a dam inside himself had finally broken, and he was now washed up on the shore.
Rubbing his eyes again, John tried to ignore the memories that were now flying through his mind like moths to a light. The feeling of soft, well-kept hair in between his fingers. The image of a tall silhouette shedding clothes against the city lights. The sounds, dear god, the sounds of both of them gasping and panting, the sheets rustling, the wet strokes of rough hands on tender skin.
“Is that so?” Sherlock’s eyes raked through John. He swallowed, making a note to himself to take advantage of that possible military kink another day.
Sherlock grunted in response, continuing to examine his slide. Charming as always. John walked to the cupboard, pulling out an almost-empty box of tea.
Maybe Sherlock hadn’t seen it, hadn’t deduced it, he had been just as plastered as John. If he had known what John was thinking, would he have stayed?
This, in itself, wasn’t remarkable. John woke up to an empty bed most mornings these days. But this particular morning, he had half expected to wake up and turn over, sleepy and content, to see…
Sherlock, the horny thing, went straight for John’s trousers, hooking his thumbs around the waistband and pulling them halfway down John’s arse before they reached the edge of the bed and John half-fell onto the mattress, Sherlock following. He straddled John’s thighs, trapping him with his arms, kissing him relentlessly. Finally, he broke away. As John caught his breath, Sherlock returned to his previous task, making quick work of John’s trousers and pants, coming to a kneel on the floor in between his legs.
“Alright,” John let it slide, “So I might be the idiot. But if you had no idea how I felt about you until today, and you’re the genius, how was I supposed to deduce how you felt? You know I’m even worse than you are at hiding things.”
