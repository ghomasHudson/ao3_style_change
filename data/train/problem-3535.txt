He heard the gasp of his mother above the sound, peeking over his shoulder to find his brother next to his mom with three guards behind them.
Shaking his head at the thought, he brought himself back to reality so he could focus.
“To be honest, I got nothing,”
"F-fuck!" Cried the man, falling to his knees with the blade sticking out of his shoulder.
“Your habits recently,” Sam started, pausing to run a hand through his hair before continuing. “It seems a bit excessive. More so than usual,”
He felt a small smack to his ass causing him to bite his lips, letting his head hang when another followed closely behind.
"C'mon Cas, you love me," Dean answered, pulling the blankets back just enough to meet Cas' sleepy blues.
"Ah, it's well deserved. You were able to make such a complicated order." The statement was directed at his companion who was still focused on her phone.
"Cas," Dean groaned out, his back protesting from the impact, as he slowly sat up.
The mysterious man, from what he could see, cocked his head to the side as if unsure of what he just heard.
"I question that," Cas replied, rolling away from Dean.
Hands gripping his shoulders as he toyed with kissing and licking, enjoying the man below as he writhed in pleasure at the attention.
"Heh, you know, Castiel. He likes you," Lucifer said, teeth bloodied, a trail of blood coming out of his nose.
There is also MINOR MINISCULE Character Death. I assure you, you will agree with this person's death.
“For what?”
"I know, and there's nothing we can do about," Dean called out, walking over to the bag of goodies on the table across the room.
“Turn around,” Castiel spoke low, letting go to let the man move. “Against the seat,” he pointed towards the opposite spot. Dean moved quickly, leaning his front on the cushions leaving his back end exposed.
Dean’s attention wandered away, the blushing deepening.
“I know it’s not. I’m just skeptical about there being an actual living being trapped in something for centuries.”
His body twitched.
Surprisingly, Meg was quiet. When he stood, he realized why. In the doorway stood the familiar green-eyed man. He was holding the door open, a man stood on the outside with an umbrella opened above him, now that’s some fancy shit.
"I've never sung it solo, so bear with me." Castiel hummed his understanding. Dean cleared his throat and began.
Castiel reached over to turn the radio. Music filled the car as they continued on their journey. Jack may be parent-less, but he wasn't without family. Hopefully a few saved souls would help the nephilim feel more accomplished.
Jack pondered the statement before asking another. “Are you older or younger than Castiel?”
Castiel gave a small wave back. “I will. Promise. And say hi to Sam for me!” Castiel stayed where he stood, listening as Dean climbed into the Impala and started the engine before backing out of the gravel driveway.
At some point, Dean reaches over and sets his hand on Cas's leg, and they drive like that until the tape runs out.
“There’s a cat on my back.”
"Will you stay with me tonight?" Dean breathes into the silence of the room, and beneath him, Cas tenses. "Not like--" he adds quickly, and he squeezes Cas's shoulder. "Not like that."
"Seems like we've said enough." He doesn't watch Cas react to that, doesn't watch as Cas looks up from his book, wounded, but maybe more than anything, pitying.
kind of moment, where they stare at each other and take in the fact that they live on opposite sides of the country, and how sometimes that really, really sucks, before Dean can't take it anymore.
Dean barely has the chance to form the word yes before Cas kisses him again. When he pulls Dean off the door and starts leading him to the bedroom, Dean can only cling to his coat, hands fisting in the fabric. Cas's stride is sure, steady, even, and Dean has to concentrate a little bit to keep up, which is hard to do with Cas's hand in his hair now, nails faintly pressing into his scalp.
"Asking Cas for you."
"Not Sam," is all he offers back, and he returns his attention to his phone.
“’Night,” Dean calls after him. He leans over to put Castiel’s present under the tree, when he notices the one Bobby left for Castiel. He’d turned the wrapping paper over to the blank side, and instead of “Happy Birthday Jesus,” he wrote “Feliz Cumpleaños Jesus.”
Castiel's hair is insane, sticking up different directions, when it isn't matted to his forehead, and his eyes are a dark blue, which Dean thinks is more a result of sex than a trick of the light. His smile is warm and soft when he reaches a hand up to touch the line of Dean's jaw, and then the corner of his mouth twitches wryly.
Their hands brush in the popcorn bowl, and Dean looks up like he's been struck to find Cas staring back at him, their hands frozen, popcorn kernels sticking to their fingers. Dean gives a small, self-conscious smile, and then makes his retreat; he crosses his arms over his chest, even, resolutely turns back to the screen, and realizes he has absolutely no idea what's going on. He pretends like he's intently focused on it though, even as he notices Cas moving beside him.
"To be honest, neither do I."
vague, then they have to get all uncomfortably literal and direct. That is definitely
"Speaking of time for girlfriends..." Sam sucks in a breath, and Dean leans against Castiel's dining room table, needing the balance. "Jess invited me to her place for Thanksgiving."
it, likes Castiel's kisses and his cooking and his house, likes doing his work there, likes having someone he can call up and hang out with and talk to. Dean doesn't find it difficult to make friends, but his definition of friendship rarely involves intimacy; he just doesn't go there. Castiel is different, though; he pulls Dean in and keeps him still, keeps him steady.
Where are they now: Spanish grad student Dean edition.
Cas is giving Dean another chance, one he doesn't deserve, but Dean's ready for it this time, he thinks.
“You ought to be more careful,” Castiel starts, but Dean barely lets him finish, raising a hand to cut him off. This time he see the ghost over Castiel’s shoulder, and he nudges him out of the way, shooting him into a wispy haze; he turns his attention back to Castiel, a nerve in his jaw twitching. Castiel hasn’t spoken to him in a
"You wanna clue me in here?" His voice is tight, brimming with restraint, watching Cas's every move as he sighs and hesitates, the fork hovering over the plate, before he continues eating.
"Jimmy wore a lot of layers. It's cumbersome sometimes," he says, and then digs out a pair of pajama pants.
"Cas..."
"You didn't want to talk last night." Dean can barely get out his smug response before Cas is stepping toward him, some of that same fire from last night returning.
But the roaring in Dean's ears cuts out most of what Castiel's saying, and he steps forward, his eyes darkening.
"All this time, you've been lying to me? You've been dating him?"
It helps too, maybe, that Benny's gay, something he figured out after he had a daughter, a failed marriage, and an alcohol problem. Dean hasn't had a lot of queer friends before, really, none that he let himself get close to. Dean's glad to say that Benny remains a steady, reliable rock during this pandemic because Dean's finding that his patience is running thin for a lot of other things.
Sam is so hilariously close to the mark that Dean breathes a soft, slightly hysterical laugh that has Sam's eyes narrowing behind him.
"No," Sam says quickly. Dean's thankful Sam can't see him wince. "No, that isn't it. It's, um. Well, it's something I want to ask you about -- um. About Jess."
"I didn't expect anything," Castiel says quietly, tearing his eyes away from Dean trying to make this right because Castiel hates to see Dean fail. "I meant it when I said that I knew I couldn't -- that just the saying of it would be enough. Please, Dean, don't..." He's not sure what he's asking for, so he stops, stops himself before he outright lies because he so desperately wants Dean to correct him. But Castiel is tired of hopefulness.
Dean nods a beat too long, holds Castiel's a beat too long, until he lets go finally.
He and Bobby don't break eye contact for another few seconds, and Dean can almost physically feel Bobby take the implication from him, roll it around in his mind, and come to his conclusion. He can almost
"Idjits," he mutters, coming into the kitchen now and waving Dean away from the oven. "Move. Looks like we're having breakfast here."
Cas slides across the seat until he's close enough that Dean can smell his shampoo again, but he stops before they touch; his eyes are on Dean's face, on his lips, and Dean feels them part. Cas leans in then, and Dean cups his face, and they're kissing in his car, the front porch light casting them in yellow shadow as their mouths press together, hot and wanting.
He's smiling a little too by the time he finally turns away, once Cas's eyes soften again into the warm thing they were when Dean first stepped out.
Please disregard the last few messages.
“You ought to stop rolling in catnip fields,” Castiel chides, and Anna puts her nose against Dean’s face again, but she finds Dean’s forehead, which his more acceptable than his freaking nostril, and he sighs and complains until she satisfies herself and jumps down. The alternative was sitting up and losing his Castiel pillow, losing the fingers in his hair. He reaches up and wipes his sleeve over his face.
"What'd you miss most about me?" Dean grins widely, and Castiel rolls his eyes more dramatically this time as he pushes Dean off him and stands up to clean away their food.
, he's thinking about Word Reference while he's balls-deep in Castiel -- and half because his brain derails the second Castiel's voice grinds out those words in a perfect accent, somewhere underneath all the sex.
"I look forward to the day your brother and I can tease you endlessly," he mutters, with a ghost of a smile in his tone.
Still dripping, Dean drapes his towel over his neck and works open the door to their latest motel room. It’s roughly 234 degrees outside, though—and he wouldn’t admit this to anyone—his perception of what’s hot has changed, since the Pit. Still, this motel has a pool that at least looks like it’s been in the vicinity of the proper cleaning materials, so Sam and Dean went for a swim and crossed their fingers they wouldn’t get meningitis.
, that he's fallen asleep curled up here with Cas against him, breathing rhythmically beside him, head still on his shoulder. There's a burst of panic then, but Cas must sense it because he picks his head up, blinking slowly, and Dean is frozen again under his gaze, caught, again.
Dean practically has a master's in swaggering, and he makes his way through the computer room, aware of the eyes on him and the laughter from the students who get the joke. He doesn't look at anyone as he enters the lounge, and he tries to walk as "mysteriously" as possible over to the food table, crammed in the corner. It's a really bad time for a Ke$ha song to get stuck in his head, but the party really hasn't started, clearly, until now.
, though Dean’s glad for a chance to cool off. Sam holds his arms out questioningly, and Dean waves a hand at him, dismissing.
"Don Félix," he corrects. "He's way more badass."
Well... Here we are again, I guess! Truly didn't anticipate writing another update to this fic so soon, but I felt a moral obligation, considering Dean Winchester is canonically bi(lingual). The previous one was admittedly a bit rushed; when I sat down to write this one, I wasn't prepared for how much I needed to say about this Dean, but then I also wasn't prepared for how I'd feel hearing Dean say "y yo a ti." So, here's a more thorough examination of the life of Dean Winchester, settled high school teacher, out bisexual.
“You don’t want to get into this with me, Cas.”
"It's not them, is it?" Castiel asks, voice hushed. "It's us. It's this -- it's because you 'aren't gay.'"
Probably he's never cared so much about an election before in his entire life, but his entire life has changed a lot in the last few years. It took him five years in grad school before he realized that the unhappiness he felt wasn't just a sense of inadequacy; he truly was unhappy with the scholarship, the research, the toxic atmosphere that was academia. His first clue was his first theory class, which he hated. And then came the increasing demands on his writing, and it got to the point that he could barely read a page without his chest tightening, without being back in the chair for his PhD comps, being quizzed and, frankly, failing. He'd had to retake those, and it wasn't an experience he relished.
“No, of course not.” He shrugs his shoulders, suddenly feeling guilty.
, and Dean's just never let himself open this door -- to Cas, to men in general, and on a grander scheme, to anyone really, not even Lisa, though he'd tried and almost succeeded there.
"Is the reason you vehemently wish away my existence whenever you speak with your brother solely because I'm male, or do you also think he'll take a violent dislike to me?"
The bell rings for the start of break, and Dean stops twirling in his chair. He slips his mask over his ears and pulls his coat on, grabs up his coffee, and heads down the hall for his new morning ritual, one that he might actually miss over the holiday.
But it's good, too. He
. There's just too much right about them for Dean to let the wrongs take over.
He starts pulling Dean against him now, and Dean follows, resisting the urge to find it weird to fit himself against Cas's side, to put his arm over his chest and tangle their legs together.
"Morning." Sam seems almost smug as he turns back to the breakfast he's cooking, and Dean isn't sure his feet are touching the floor as he approaches him. "Sleep well?" There's a sing-song note in his voice that Dean's pretty positive he hates.
"Yeah, nope. Maybe you don't need sleep, but you at least need to cut yourself a break for a few hours. Watch some trash TV. You know, relax. You've had a hell of a go of it."
Rolling his eyes, he starts up the car, nearly absorbing the calming rumble of the Impala’s engine, and he grips her steering wheel, something that never fails to make him feel a little more in control.
, Dean, por favor."
For about five seconds, Dean's delirious with happiness because his plan had worked, and he'd annoyed Bobby into asking him about his texts, which is pretty hilarious, all things considered. After those five seconds, though, he remembers what the plan was all about, and the smugness drains away. He shrugs, self-conscious suddenly, and slides his phone into his pocket.
“I hope you are right,” he says finally, lowly, and Fluttershy pats his shoulder.
Cas isn't much of a dancer except for when Dean groans and rolls his eyes; then he suddenly wants to keep Dean on the dance floor while he bounces around to "Wannabe."
When he pulls up at the bar, the sun is out, the parking lot's full; Dean hasn't really seen this place in the sunlight, and it's more innocuous now in the way that bars always seem to be before the sun sets. Steeling himself, he makes his way inside, eyes sweeping the room for Cas. He finds him at the bar, smiling, wearing a button-down and jeans, as Corey leans over to talk to him. At the bell, Corey looks up and immediately frowns.
"If you want to talk about Golden Age sometime... or not," Castiel's grin twitches into place again and Dean's stomach gives a little flip, "then I'd be happy to help."
"At the moment, I don't have any of those things. There's the patient."
"Yup. But I can't tell you. It's a secret." He winks at her and watches her blush and giggle. Oh yeah, he's going to Hell. At least he won't come off completely gay. "What about you? You got a costume?"
"Nah. I like my conquests to be room temperature at least. That's where Félix and I differ. I've got standards."
"I believe that you are. I'm close to forgiving you, but you're ruining it by talking." He glances at his list, nods, and turns back to Dean, where the conviction in his eyes wavers. "I'm not having this conversation in the library. I told you I'll call; I will."
"Okay, we order out."
“All I’m saying is—”
"Anyway," he says thickly, pressing on, "Bobby had us move in with him, but his stipulation was that I had to go to college. Probably under any other circumstance I would've said fuck no," Dean says, huffing a humorless laugh, "but he caught me at a weak moment."
When they part, Castiel is surprised to find his heart beating fast in his chest, his pulse racing. Dean takes his hand in his own and smiles, almost shy. For a moment, he seems on the verge of saying something monumental, but when he opens his mouth to speak all he says is, “Let’s eat.”
There's a ghost of a smile on Cas's face as he looks up at Dean.
This time, Sam frowns. “Are you saying it’s not okay?” There’s a threat in Sam’s voice that Dean definitely notices.
Sam does let it drop, thank God, but Dean's brain doesn't.
What he should be doing is paying attention to his professor talking about
They perch themselves on the bricks between Dean's table and the kids', and they take their masks off, and Cas and Kevin start getting acquainted while Dean starts eating his lunch.
"Dean--nothing has to change," Cas starts, but Dean cuts him off.
change things, Cas.
jabs from Sammy and Bobby since he started getting into all this literature stuff. If his dad hadn't died, then he probably wouldn't be here at all, would probably still be back at Bobby's garage, speaking slang Spanish with the other mechanics.
“I hope you regain the ability to speak in full sentences when it comes time for comps.”
Dean takes another pull of his beer, drinking deep, tasting nothing. Sam is right; they don't have many people left anymore, though things seem stable, for now. Dean could start setting down roots, but listen, he's tired. He's set down too many roots only to have them torn up again, watched too many people die; no, he doesn't really want to start over. Dean is wrong, but he doesn't know if he can make it right. Finally, he grabs the Impala's keys.
His chuckle fades away as Sam throws Castiel another of his soft, soothing, victim smiles. Dean hates those too. Castiel doesn’t need to be coddled like that. He’s
"Not particularly." He picks up his coffee cup and takes a long drink while Dean is stuck trying to figure out how to bridge this gap that he built in the first place. Dean counts to twenty this time, rubs his hand over his face, breathes in through his nose and exhales through his mouth, and he tries again.
"Sure. For you, Sammy, I've got
“Just be glad you weren’t there when one of us had to stitch up our own arm,” Dean comments with a smile, able to joke about that now, if only to see Castiel’s eyebrows lift in an emotion he can’t name. Is he impressed, grossed out, or saddened? Maybe all three, Dean decides, as he cleans up their emergency med kit. When he turns around, Sam is easing his shirt on, and Castiel looks on, perplexed, but yeah—definitely a little saddened. Dean clenches his jaw.
"I hear ya, brother."
There’s no question that he’s being
"When I said that I loved you?" It's amazing sometimes how gentle Cas can look when Dean also knows exactly what he's capable of, the power that hums just beneath the surface.
"I didn't agree to that!"
when they break for food that Charlie touches him on the arm.
Their eyes meet and there it is again -- that undeniable
He doesn't realize Cas is watching him until Cas gives a shuddery kind of breath, and Dean looks up at him. He shivers slightly then, the kitchen suddenly cold again against his back, and Cas frowns.
to get back all the way across the country, because Dean
The fact that Dean doesn’t react with a visceral reaction to run is actually the only answer he needs, but Dean doesn’t say anything; can’t, not yet. He only swallows thickly and breaks their gaze as the wheel starts moving again. He can see (but he’d rather not) the whole fair stretched out before them, but the anxiety rolling in his gut isn’t wholly related to being so far from the ground.
is the moment he's going to wake up. But Cas finishes cleaning himself with the napkins and turns to Dean, and Dean watches as he methodically cleans him up, even helping Dean back into his pants.
made for this kind of gathering; too many people shoved into one place, talking over each other, with most of those conversations being awkward as hell. Dean fills his plate slowly, attempting to look busy so as to avoid any unnecessary conversation for the time being. Last time he was here, he wound up discussing various types of cheese with a chaired professor, and it's an experience he'd rather not repeat.
"Would you like to see the new shipment that just came in?"
This moment is fragile, and Dean's afraid of it, afraid of what he'll do with it. He works his mouth and then forces words out this time.
It's only a few minutes before Castiel texts back.
"No, I gotta..." He hates himself even as he starts to say it. "I should really... get back." To what? To an empty bunker? To a world that's mostly moved on without him?
"You're right where I want you," Cas murmurs into Dean's ear.
“Take these off," Michael whispered into his ear.
“Sam wants to start a weekly game night.”
Michael was right, of course, he was. He took another deep breath and slowly let it out. "Okay. Right. You're right."
A woosh of air signaled that the nephilim had fled the scene. He wandered uselessly towards the spot Jack had disappeared from. “Jack!”
Dean exhalled, leaning forward to rest his head on Castiel’s shoulder. He shifted his head to accommodate Dean’s and glanced towards the front door to find Sam standing there, his brow raised in a questioning smirk. Castiel couldn’t help but smile.
"How old are you?"
His eyebrows shot up. "An alpha’s worth?!" Castiel stood abruptly and stormed over to the clearing.
“My mother.” A voice said behind them.
“I didn’t mean to make him cry! I told you this was a bad idea!”
"Taken? What do you mean?"
Dean nodded in understanding, the rubber band that had been pulling loosened a bit. Castiel was nearby and he needed to talk to the alpha immediately. He turned to face his brother one last time before all hell would break loose.
“Seven. Eight. Nine…”
“Fine, we have a potential hunt in Nebraska anyways.” Dean and Sam share a look before he continues. “If anything goes wrong Cas, anything at all, you call us and we'll deal with it.”
Let me know what you think in the comments or visit me on tumblr and shoot me a message!
“Mrowr”
“Cas?”
“I can feel her!” Jack exclaimed, eyes roaming the new area.
“Cas?”
“Why would such a young soul stay at their own grave?” Lailah asked.
“All done.”
"And the pups?" Cas asked, his body continuing to tense up.
A flash of memories came through at Leilah’s comment. Being scared and overwhelmed. Feeling vulnerable and exposed. Being human hadn’t been easy, especially in the very beginning. He was a being as old as time and yet, having his grace forced from him, being thrown to earth, he had never felt more young. Like a new life just born into a world that didn’t want him. A world that was unforgiving and gave very little sympathy to those that didn’t understand. He had felt weak at the time, but now, looking back, he realized just how strong he had really been.
“I assure you, Ishim, everything is going to be fine. It’s just a little less food.” Castiel looked beyond Ishim’s shoulder to his pregnant omega, Lilly. Castiel didn’t like that she looked away, as she always seemed to do. It made him feel uneasy.
Michael stepped into his space. Castiel deliberately lifted his gaze from Michael’s chest to his mouth and noticed the confident grin, present as ever, on his plump pink lips. Would those lips soon be wrapped around him? They looked so full, perfect for something like that. Did he
"Dean, I didn't say anything because I wasn't sure what was real. I-I needed to solve my crap before I threw you into it."
"It's Castiel," Sam said as he grabbed Dean's arm and led him down the hallway and past the nurse. “We need you there, quick.”
Castiel took in a breath as he approached. "Mother's."
He opened his eyes and glanced down at his now perfectly bandaged hand before looking back up at Dean. He noticed how close they were sitting, one of Deans legs between Castiel’s and his other outside one of them. Dean’s hands wandered over, one to Castiel’s leg and the other to his thigh, thumbs gently sliding back and forth over both of them.
The third demon kicked at Castiel's legs causing him to fall. He quickly rolled backwards and jumped up with just enough time to grab the demon by the shoulders at it charged and throw it across the yard.
The apha took in a shaky breath, "My pups. Claire and Jack. They've been taken."
Anyways, the plot thickens! Enjoy!
Everything felt amazing. With each soft swipe of fingers over the head of his cock, arousal coiled deep in his groin. His cock continued to twitch as Michael played with it; he hadn’t grabbed it, he just used soft touches and gentle brushes along the vein underneath. Every breath and gasp that passed his lips seemed too loud in the small space, Michael’s touch threatened to overwhelm his senses. He was finally relaxing into the arousal, succumbing to the desire stirring within him.
"What do you say," Sam started as they continued on their mission for decorations, "I bring over Scrabble and we start a game night once a week?"
Dean finally managed to swallow the bite in his mouth before howling and slamming his hand on the table. Castiel chuckled as he quietly reminded Dean to be careful before he smashed the glass on their new patio table.
Amelia shifted Claire in her hold and stepped closer to him. “Of course she does. But so do you.” Castiel sighed. “You’re the only one of us without a mate.” She pressed on, using her eyes to gesture towards the direction Inias had disappeared to. “Perhaps it’s time.”
Castiel closed his eyes and tipped his head back as Michael's hands started to roam gently across his stomach again. One hand slowly dipped down to his boxer briefs, his fingers teasing the waistband. Castiel held in the groan that threatened to pass his lips.
“Huh.” He humphed in realization. “In a way, I suppose they did.”
"Cas!"
“It’s a beautiful night tonight.”
Castiel pulled Dean into his chest tighter. He didn't remember the last time he felt as happy as he did with Dean. Not since Balthazar, at least. Being with Dean was the happiest he had felt ever since that awful night. Sweat started to bead at his forehead and he sighed, his fingers lightly grazing Dean's shoulder. With them both being awake now, his rut was making itself known more. Though, he was surprised just how calm it was still being.
The need was consuming him, making him dizzy. Sweat was pouring off of him. His muscles were tense. His knot was growing. He wasn’t hungry for food, he was hungry for his omega. But the omega needed something from him. A memory. Why?
“Well, actually that's what I wanted to talk to you all about.”
"Come on, alpha. You need to finish eating before your rage takes over." Castiel sighed, his smile still on his lips. "Don't give me that sass." Dean chuckled, kissing his forehead before pushing up on his shoulders.
Castiel felt a piece of fabric fall over his lap.
Dean placed a hand on Castiel’s arm and squeezed in reassurance. "Cas-"
Castiel frowned, his heart still beating wildly in his chest. "Why do people always say that?"
See you in Part 2!
"Already feel so good." Castiel breathed, his mouth moving of its own accord.
Dean’s eyes were always green, but now they had a gold ring around the pupil. His alpha knew what it meant, but what little self control he still had pushed the alpha back. He could follow a simple order. "Okay."
“Alpha, please remember.” The omega reached up and cupped his hand over Castiel’s cheek.
“So I look at Joe, honestly not believing what I’m seeing…” Dean opens his mouth to laugh but can’t due to the massive bite of burger still half chewed in his mouth, ”...and I said, ‘but you killed the engine right?’. I kid you not, the kid just stared at me like I was a ghost.”
“Uh, nothing that I can remember.” He lied. Jack didn’t need to know about his odd dreams, especially when they revolved around him being dead. There was no telling how he would react.
Castiel looked up and met his gaze. The rubber band that had been loosening relaxed all in one go. Dean released all the air from his lungs that he hadn't even been aware he was holding back. Cas was alive. Cas was safe.
Before he knew what he was doing, Castiel was crossing the clearing in quick long strides. The sound of humming slipped through his chants of
Warning in the End Notes
Dean blinked a few times before clearing his throat and closing his outreached hand. "Yea, uh, I just wanted to talk to you." Dean wiped his hand against his pants, "If that's alright?"
“How do emotions make humans strong?” Jack asked, eyes screwed into confused contemplation. “Emotions seem overwhelming, a sort of blindfold to the senses. How can that be good?”
"I was wondering about that.” Dean stated, his fingers drawing figure eights through Castiel’s chest hair now. “I've only been with a few alphas in rut, but they seemed to always be in this sort of rage the whole time."
The omega stood up and turned around. “Then I trust you.”
Castiel swallowed.
"Amelia estimates an alpha’s worth."
Cas jumped up, Milo jumping out of his lap with a wine. "Dean, please." Dean was halfway to the house when Cas felt tears well up. "Stop."
“Fuck.” The omega moaned, his hips pressing back against his alpha. Castiel smiled. He began pounding into his omega, grunting with wild abandon. He slipped his hand back towards his omega’s cock again and gripped it tight.
“I still think the tree is leaning to the right.” Dean said, his head tilted trying to figure out the tree.
“Why are you here, scum.” Lailah practically growled.
Ishim’s habanero scent lingered while his fingers rubbed the salt and pepper stubble on his chin. After a moment of contemplation, he nodded and sighed. “Fine. But I’m still not happy.”
The distant hum of rain falling against the dome echoed through the hut. It was a peaceful silence. Birds stayed quiet, rodents weren't scurrying through the bushes, and being alone in their new prison meant there wasn't anyone milling about outside. Castiel shifted his right arm over his head to try and block the sunlight streaming in through the back window. Dean hummed and shuffled a bit before resting back against Castiel's side. As gruff as the omega tried to be, when he allowed his inner self through Castiel noticed just how much Dean required touch. It was a thin line they were walking in how intimate they should be with one another, but he hoped Dean wouldn't hide from him again.
"I don't know if I believe you, Sam."
Trailing behind the other two as Jack continued to ask questions to Lailah, he tried some much needed meditation. Taking a breath, he allowed his vessel the chance to take in all the universe had. The energy from the sun as it beat down on his exposed skin. The breeze from the sky as it cooled the warming skin. The sound of the lake as it washed up against the rocks. The crunching of the rocks and dirt under their feet as they made their way towards their destination. The blending smells of grass, trees, and the algae that washed up against the rocks below.
“Thank you.” She met his eyes with a small smile. In that moment he allowed himself to believe that maybe, just maybe, things between him and heaven could be resolved.
Castiel felt strange, as if he was floating just outside his own body. He needed to feed his inner alpha, but he also wanted to address the powerful memory he had just experienced. It had been years since he’d last allowed himself to think about his mom.
“Hey, are you with me?” Dean asked, a hand running over Castiel's thigh.
….I know
Castiel's optimism was short-lived. By midday, he was feeling the inevitable rage seeping through his consciousness. His skin constantly damp, his heart rate pulsing rapidly in his chest, his mind consistently chanting
Castiel sat up straighter, feeling bold. He could do this. With a deep breath, he motioned for Michael to continue.
“Mrowr.” “Mrowr.” Turning his head, he met the blueish green eyes of the cat he had adopted. Something in the cats eyes told him that everything was going to be okay; if only he could allow himself to believe it.
“Alpha, please.” The omega whimpered in his ear. Castiel was on a mission. He kicked open the front door and hurried over to the small cot. Careful, he placed the omega down. “You promised.” He whimpered.
"How are you feeling?"
"So a youngin." Castiel joked.
“My mate is nervous, alpha. What are you going to do about this?”
Dean groaned into his shoulder. “If you had waited 5 more minutes you would have been.”
"To be an angel again."
The last thing he wanted to do was let an emotional nephilim out into the world, but she was right. They needed to find the soul before anything else happened.
"How?"
The angels all died and it’s your fault
Trying to force down the panic, he slumped back in his chair. The burning logs, that he couldn’t actually see anymore, became fascinating. They had to be. He could outsmart the panic attack, if he could focus on the texture of the logs...
"I know."
He didn’t know what to say. This was the most time he had spent with another angel in a long time. He was nervous at first, knowing the angels really didn’t like him around anymore, but he was pleasantly surprised by Lailah. She was a little rough around the edges but he knew, deep down, that she was kind. The events over the last 10 years made all the angels toughen up, do things they never would have before the apocalypse. Yes, many of them were soldiers, but Lailah wasn’t always. If memory served him correct, she had always been an observer. Watching and reporting, that was all. The fall, Amara, Lucifer, Michael, it changed everything for everyone.
"I-" there was something Dean was missing, he could feel it. His instinct was to not give any more hope than necessary. For their sake, and for his. If he couldn't deliver on a promise, he'd never forgive himself.
His inner alpha relaxed. There was a heaviness building in his chest that both he and his inner alpha felt. Castiel imagined them resting in the dirt with them, howling along with the words as they sank into the safety of vanilla and cinnamon.
“For what?” He asked, confused by her for the millionth time that day.
Your weekly reminder that this is NOT beta'd so all mistakes are my own!
“Everything, Sam.” Dean rolled his eyes in irritation, “Just tell me the plan.”
I hope you liked this chapter. Like I said before, I'm not completely happy, but I got close in the end.
Castiel nodded. "Yes."
Michael reached his other hand down and traced his fingers over Castiel’s balls and against the skin just behind them. He started rapidly massaging his fingers into his perineum.
He remembered his first rut in that cage. The first time he felt utterly helpless, dirty, and feral. The blood that pumped through his body; the need to either kill the man in front of him or fuck him senseless just for some relief. Then the humiliation of masturbating in a cell with upwards of thirty other alphas and omegas. Castiel cried for days from lack of a mate, and the inability to find relief. He remembered the alpha Benjamin had taken pity on him and held him close in the corner of the cage. His soft voice whispered words of fake endearment as he slowly stroked him to the relief he desperately needed while the others had created a barrier for him, something they all did willingly after those first few days.
She turned back to her mother. “Take care of Lynn, Ed, Marie, and Lizzy. They need you even though they pretend they don’t.” They both chuckled, holding back more tears.
"Why? Is something wrong?" Dean frowned once again.
Sam had been right there. He was standing next to Jack when it had happened.
Without warning, Michael’s fingers disappeared, and Castiel couldn't help the whimper that escaped him. "Breathe, man, you gotta breathe."
The memories did remind him of his dream, though. Dream him had been human, powerless and maybe even scared. Heaven had been gone and the angels were all extinct. A shiver ran through him at the thought. To be the only angel on Earth, and to then also be human? It was a good thing it was just a dream.
“Does it make me a bad person to not be sad about his death…”Jack's voice quieted, as if he was ashamed of his question, “that I killed him?”
Michael's fingers were so soft and gentle, slowly trailing up and down his shaft. It caused arousal to flare through him. Part of him was begging for more, and his lips twitched with the need to beg, while another wanted to slip into the slowly building anxiety attack. Why did he want this so bad? Why was he so aroused and wanting? It was all too much, yet not even close to enough. He sucked in a deep breath and closed his eyes tight, unable to watch anymore.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What?!" Dr. Adler sprinted out of the room.  He stalked up to Dean and grabbed his chin to force it to the side. Dean groaned and snarled from the force. "You've got to be kidding me!" He released Dean's face and stepped back. "You'll give it up for any old knot won't you, bitch?
Castiel took a deep breath and nodded to confirm his Snapchat handle. He kept his eyes trained on the guy's grey plaid shirt, too nervous about maintaining eye contact. Part of him wished he had used a different handle, but it was too late now.
His phone buzzes on the counter, and he flips it open.
Dean's glad it's over and wonders, maybe--maybe that was worse than Cas trying to put this into words.
It'd been easy, until now, because it'd been so fast; he and Castiel were skating along the surface of their sexual tension, and then suddenly there was kissing and tostones and their life stories, and Castiel was just
“Well.” He shakes his head, and Dean can see the ghost of a smile creeping over his face as he looks away, trying to hide it from Dean. “Make sure he’s asleep, then. It’s a damn good thing he’s a heavy sleeper.”
“Dean—”
"I know," Dean says, trying to pull away, but Sam grips him tighter; he tries again to jerk away, but Sam's hold is tight. He forgets, sometimes, how strong Sam can be, when he wants to be. Sam gives him a look, a serious kind of therapist look, a you-should-know-better look, and frowns at him.
"Uh?" Dean asks as Cas pulls on a flannel, and he shrugs, looking down at himself.
“About what?”
"I bet you know something about soul shakin'," Dean says, half-delirious, half-confident that it's a suave thing to say, and Cas tilts his head, smiling with one side of his mouth.
He drops the hands from his eyes so that he can look over at him, stretched out in Dean's bed. Castiel is such a weird mix of put-together and scattered, that sort of absent-minded professor that Dean's always found a little amusing because it means Castiel's hair is always a fucking mess, but his handwriting is neat and cramped and he's probably the best goddamn teacher Dean's ever met.
Castiel lets Sam and Dean tease each other the whole way out of the parking lot; he waits until they reach the highway before he says the thing that nearly makes Dean swerve off the road.
"Exactly. My mom was hoping I'd be born on Tuesday -- she had an appointment to have her labor induced then, actually, but I came early. My later obsession with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was tainted by the knowledge that I could've been Raphael."
Eventually, Dean's going to wind up buying out the whole shop. He's aware of this.
And that just closes Dean's trap. Castiel chuckles again, pulling another book from the shelf.
" Castiel greets smoothly as he settles in, balancing a conference tote bag between his feet.
"Can you at least tell me what period?" Castiel asks, tilting his head.
"Dean... I could watch over you." In the past, Dean has never liked that option, but that doesn't mean that Castiel doesn't still want to and probably still will later on in the night, once Dean's asleep. What he's expecting is a quick rebuff, but instead Dean takes an unsteady breath.
He leans his head back against the couch, shuts his eyes, and waves his hands in time to the beat, resisting the urge to hum since Castiel is still asleep because Castiel is a normal person, or at least no longer a grad student. One of his earbuds slips out of his ear, but he doesn't stop drumming to fix it.
I take it back. I'm definitely not paying you for the car. Gabriel won't shut up about my belt, and that's your fault.
He moves, thrusts into Castiel, shallow to start with; Castiel hisses out a yes between his teeth and starts full-out
, when really it does so much more. In a way, it's the ultimate
and that's when Dean's mouth goes dry because he can't do this. He
It feels so normal to cruise through lines of cars at the speed of a snail on espresso, when just a few weeks ago, he and Sam managed to lock Michael and Lucifer (and yeah, their half brother, so that kind of sucks) into a cage in Hell. He’s still not even sure how they managed to pull it off, but he wouldn’t have doubted divine intervention, not after Bobby and Castiel were brought back too.
Belatedly he realizes what this might look like, two guys on a Ferris wheel, and he wishes Sam were here because a third wheel would eliminate any incorrect assumptions. He tries not to think too much of it, and turns to try to make small talk with Castiel, when he notices Castiel staring just past him. Over his shoulder, Dean spots a teenage couple, his arms wrapped around her, hands on her appreciable ass, with her head tucked into the crook of his neck.
"Cas, come on. Don't you take holidays off from forcing me to get over my whatever-you-call-it."
"Is that Cas?" he asks Dean, who tries to get around him, but Sam grabs his shoulder. "Dean--that's
The door opens, and Cas starts pocketing the key, but Dean is already on him, mouth on the back of his neck as he hurries Cas through the door and lets it close behind him. Cas turns in his arms, breathless, and Dean finds his mouth again and pins him against the wall, until finally Cas tries to start leading them up the stairs. Upsettingly, this means they have to pull away from each other. Dean's lips are flushed; his heart is beating hard, loud, fast, and he's still afraid of what will happen when this bubble bursts, afraid that Cas will try to say something once they start heading upstairs.
He could be more annoyed at Sam making this into some educational thing, except Castiel seems to enjoy learning some of these things, so whatever, but he can only stand it so long. As they wander out of that building and Sam starts looking at his map again, Dean smacks it out of his hand.
"No, that's fine. I should go soon actually." Dean musters his most winning smile.
"Grading. Second drafts of the compositions." He presses his lips together and finds Castiel's eyes on him, but they quickly dart away again, shifting to just beyond Dean's shoulder as the bus rolls up.
Dean watches Castiel and wrestles with himself, but the struggle's brief; he'd already decided this back on Castiel's couch with the smell of tostones heavy in the air.
"Yeah, man. What's up?"
"I see." Suddenly, Castiel is beside him, but he's looking at the options, his eyes moving quickly. "'Up' in what way? Sensation? Size?" He lifts an eyebrow at Dean. "Both?"
After that, though, it was easier to forget all that, all those urges, because -- well -- Dad went on a hunt and didn't come back. There was hardly any time for flirting, for sex, for
Instead he pushes himself up, leaving the infectious heat of Cas's body, and starts undoing his shirt. Cas blinks rapidly before he catches up to what's happening, and he sits up, almost too abruptly, almost clunking their foreheads together. He shrugs out of his shirt, then looks to Dean, and there's a question there, yeah, but Dean can't help but feel like he's taking notes, just taking the time to do his research, learn how this goes, so that next time--
He doesn't, though. He doesn't go out to a bar and instead drinks at home, like healthy people do, just him and that expansive, quiet bunker, until he runs out of whiskey. And beer. And he's staring at the empty bottle, his knuckles leaning on the table, and his heart is pounding maybe just a little too hard and his thoughts going too fast for him to be able to process any of them.
"Something funny I missed out on?"
"I'll be in my office if you'd like to get lunch later," he says and waits for Dean's nod before he turns around, his overcoat swaying out behind him as he leaves the office.
He pulls Cas into the backseat of the Impala once it's just the two of them, mumbling about how it isn't really a drive-in until you makeout in the backseat, but once they're back there, they wind up just sitting, Cas in Dean's arms, music playing on the radio. The stars are more visible now that the lights are all out, and it's peaceful, restful.
It was one thing to reconcile everything with Charlie; it's another to figure out just what exactly he's going to do about it. He can say that he -- yeah -- he wants to fit Cas back into his life, maybe wants a little more than that, but really underneath it all, all he wants is Cas back in the bunker. He wants to walk into the kitchen and find Cas fiddling with the coffee pot. He wants to stumble out of his room in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and find Cas reading and spend an extra twenty minutes having a midnight snack with him. He wants to figure out what to do with this slice of eternity with Cas.
Honestly, that isn't something he's admitted to many people. Sam, in a vague way; Bobby, in a desperate, self-loathing way. He's had time to reconcile these things in the time since his dad died the summer after Dean graduated high school, and he spent a year scraping a life together for himself and Sam, though Bobby helped. He isn't sure what's drawing it out now, except for this unnamable comfort, this connection that buzzes and hums like an electric fence between himself and Castiel.
"And now you're here," Cas says slowly, voice gravelly and strangely light.
As he sits in the bunker, trying to figure out if he's about to do this, he wonders about how Cas has belonged to him this whole time, even though Dean always felt like he was losing him to Heaven and angel bullshit and that Cas was always one stiff breeze away from blowing away from him for good. It didn't help that he kept dying either. And so Dean pushed; Dean didn't stop him when Cas walked out. It was going to happen anyway, right? And if he'd really wanted, he would've stayed. So he thought then.
It isn’t like he can tell anyone about it, but sometimes he feels like he’s suffocating. He’s stared down ghosts, he’s seen dead bodies, but something about bumping into crowds in small, humid hallways makes something tighten in his chest that he didn’t even know was there. Maybe he’s just around death so much that life seems unreachable, untouchable.
“Well, that’s a step in the right direction,” Dean says, though he wishes Castiel had picked another of Dean’s objections to act on, and he checks the AC.
"Thank God."
The timing is too good, but it can't be -- why wouldn't he say anything?
"Uh, nothing." Dean shuffles his bag onto his shoulder and closes his hand around his keys. "I'm on the way out the door, though. What do you need, Sam?"
"Hey, put me on speaker. Let me talk to Cas."
He doesn't turn around to face Castiel, but his hands ball into fists at his sides, more out of an effort to keep himself from storming away than anything else.
Dean rolls his eyes and sits on the couch again; Anna jumps away from his feet and watches him warily until he’s seated, and she takes the opportunity to jump on him again, her little paws slipping on Dean’s legs until they find purchase.
Dean swallows thickly and stares down at that hand, feeling an incredible weight falling on his shoulders. He’d only recently managed to cast off the last one, so this feels pretty unfair, and he only stares at Castiel’s hand.
Castiel's smiling warmly over his wine glass, and Dean's stomach is churning with uncertainty, but he keeps his mind focused on the same-old, same-old discussion of his students.
“You aren’t my
. If Dean's going to have a huge breakthrough about his big gay crisis, or whatever, he'd rather it be on his own terms, preferably with a power ballad in the background, maybe in front of dramatic scenery. He didn't really want it handed it to him along with his ass in his kitchen with the scent of cooling sausage hanging heavy in the air.
"Got more beer?" Sam asks from the doorway, and Cas blinks, but otherwise doesn't show any upset over the whole situation, at least until he hears the tightness in Dean's voice.
He settles back on his pillow and Castiel stirs beside him, making a noise of complaint that distracts Dean with its surprising adorableness before his phone buzzes again.
"I don't know if I can get used to this," Dean says finally, honestly, and he wonders how that frank admission could be allowed here when it hurts him to say it.
He stares harder at Sam, then he squeezes his eyes shut and shakes his head, but when he opens them, Sam still looks smug, the little bastard, which means Dean heard what he said correctly.
... that, and then after a while, it just didn't seem like it was in the cards for me either way."
They should be in bed, but they're slumped together on the couch. Cas's lips are against the top of his ear, and his fingers are tracing small circles on Dean's shoulder. Mostly, Dean's trying not to groan continuously about being so full he almost hurts, but he can tell that Cas is up there thinking.
that he'd done it. He'd fought his way in, tore through the Empty, pulled Cas from the nothingness, watched him come back to himself; he'd been so sure he'd pulled Cas out, like Cas did for him, like he owed it to him to do, like he's repaid the debt he's been carrying around for years.
It's odd. He's both surprised and entirely not; he's elated, and filled with dread. He closes the book and sets it aside, but otherwise doesn't move as Dean pulls up, gets out of the car.
“How about the animals?” Sam suggests, looking down at the map in their hands. They gave one to Castiel, but he just holds it loosely; Dean notices he’s looking at Dean’s though, and Dean imperceptibly turns it enough that he can see better.
Sam looks up, nodding, a stupid grin on his face.
Blinking, confused, Castiel nods, though he doesn't move away. He feels a little cheated, like he was given a glimpse of something that was just as quickly taken away from him again.
"Oh, the babies are doing good. Cas just had an ear infection, but he's getting better." He pauses. "And you, Dean? Have you found your normal?"
Dean's voice his quiet, his grumpiness passing, and he ignores whatever reaction Sam might have to that. He lets the sink drain and scoops up a handful of utensils to put away. Sam seems to take the cue that his brother needs a time-out from his emotions, and he starts putting dishes away, even though he really has no reason to know where they go. Dean only has four cupboards, though. It's not too hard to figure out.
"Can you say it without stuttering?"
"But I was still taking Spanish, and I was up to the major classes. My advisor said I should give it a shot, stick with it, see if I liked the lit classes better than math. No one was more surprised than I was when I did." He rolls his eyes and glances over when he feels rather than hears Castiel laugh softly, something tender and gentle in his eyes that Dean quickly works to ignore. "All those years Bobby kept getting after me to read, and here I am. Oh, you should've seen his face when I told him."
"You made all this yourself?" Castiel asks, taking another forkful of mashed potatoes.
"Cas..." Sam's disbelief is evident, and Castiel looks over at him, trying to evaluate his reaction. Perturbed, perhaps, but relieved. "I can't believe it. We didn't think it worked."
"No phones," he murmurs, nosing at him, and above him, Cas sighs, fond but irritated.
“I’m glad, and I hope you are hungry. I may have gone slightly overboard in the preparation of tonight’s meal.”
The bell rings as Dean steps inside, bright and welcoming, and his eyes sweep the aisles quickly for any signs of Cas. Somewhere back there after his fourth or fifth visit, he'd stopped with the pretense of his full name. Cas knows what size plug Dean is currently taking up his ass and that he's curious about prostate stuff, so the "tiel" just feels too formal at this point.
He yawns, and he guesses it's time to sleep, either because he's tired or because some part of him wants to sleep; he's found that it's kind of a tossup, really, and he looks over uncertainly at Cas.
Dean peels his own jacket off and drops it on the floor. God, it's been so long since he did this, since he felt something beneath his fingertips so decidedly...
"You're here late," Castiel remarks, coming up to a stop in front of Dean, who pulls his office door shut behind him and hitches his bag higher on his shoulder.
, but Cas did it anyway. And there it is now, reaching through the blackness as Sam and Cas hug beside him. This feeling is better; this feeling is easier, and he allows the anger to spread out, to fill him up, as he watches Cas be so easy, so light as he steps away from Sam and looks to Dean again, eyes full of a fondness that makes Dean ache.
Most of them didn't leave his heart racing, though, not like this.
It isn't much, but Dean chuckles and presses his hands to his face, taking a deep breath. Okay. Porn, beer, then bed. Fuck the compositions.
It's the wrong thing to say, but Dean rolls his eyes. "Oh, has he?" he asks, bitter, and he rubs his eyes.
liked, even, let alone what Cas liked, let alone what he liked to do
Cas's cock twitches underneath his palm, and his hips jerk when Dean brushes his thumb over the head, and Dean tries to do the things that he likes, but like, the mirror version of them, until Cas is gasping and clutching at Dean's shoulder, so he must be doing something right, at least. He thinks, as he watches Cas open his eyes, unfocused and dizzyingly blue as they stare at nothing, at everything, at molecules maybe over Dean's shoulder, that he's okay with learning how to get better at this.
He rises slowly, feeling Castiel's eyes on him the whole way, and he takes a small step closer, setting his hands on his hips.
No one else mentions anything. He doesn't expect them to, and maybe it's better that way. Would he even like having a party? What would he even
"You know what's sad?" Dean asks as he pulls away. "I don't either."
Hmm... is it someone from Retablo de maravillas?
The next time Sam calls, Dean's out to eat with Castiel, and his phone vibrates in his pocket while the waiter finishes taking their orders.
-angel. I think that means I can whine all I like."
"Sammy -- " he starts, but Sam holds up a hand.
"Look alive, Winchester. I've got a question."
When he wakes up in the morning and remembers his embarrassingly academic revelation, he can't actually find much fault with it.
It occurs to him then, that night, that the next time they go down this road, it's going to be different. It isn't going to be sex--not that it ever was just that, but now they're both going into it eyes open, and Dean has to recognize that this is going to be some kind of act of love. That shouldn't change anything, but it does.
“I’ve had worse,” Sam assures Castiel, and Dean looks up at him, a little startled at the tone in his voice. It’s a little like the tone he takes when he’s trying to soothe Dean about getting hurt, and he doesn’t know what to think about that. Instead he sets his jaw and starts stitching, telling Sam to brace himself.
Their last night together is Sam’s graduation night, with the realization that Sammy’s leaving him soon weighing heavily on his shoulders. It’s different that night—slower, gentler, an unspoken acknowledgment of the goodbye. When they leave, Dean knows he isn’t really leaving something significant behind, but it feels like it anyway.
"Why?"
Dean tries to feel like he’s putting miles between himself and Chris once they get in the car and drive, but he doesn’t quite succeed.
He slips his phone into his pocket and starts for the elevator, since it deposits him in the back hallway of the department. The hallway's deserted, and he slinks up to the door to the computer room. Since this room hooks onto the lounge, they've turned both into party rooms, but the food's in the lounge so there aren't many people over here. He doesn't think about how the combination lock on this door could foil his entire plan -- after all, Don Félix de Montemayor would hardly be a badass if he struggled with temperamental doorknobs -- but it yields to him, miraculously, and he pulls the door open.
"Of course. If you have a camera, I -- "
Before Dean has a chance to turn the hose around in his hand, though, Cas's hand is on his waist, and there's another on Dean's face, and Cas is kissing him, so maybe the transfer of the hose was part of his plan, in the end. Dean's frozen; the kitchen is starting to feel uncomfortably cold through his very wet clothes, but Cas's hands are warm, his lips warmer as he pulls Dean in against him, confident and strong, at least until Dean's frozen for just a beat too long. Then he starts to pull away, gets far enough to separate their mouths, to look from Dean's lips to his eyes and back again.
Not unless you want me to punch you in the face.
Obviously, they've talked about Dean's experiences with this or that; they've talked about things Dean's curious about, things he hasn't had a chance to try and isn't sure he'd like, but he's at a stage in his life when he just sorta wants to try it all, sample the dude buffet that he's only had a few nibbles of so far. Obviously, Dean knows that Cas knows a lot about this stuff, but somehow, they've never managed to talk about Cas's experiences--with any of it, with anyone. Dean only has a vague impression that he's not straight, but only through things Cas has half-said; and he could always just like pegging, Dean has reminded himself so often that it stopped being a reminder and almost became a weird sort of half-fantasy. Anyway.
before I graduate, and heard about you and thought, maybe this would help me find… confidence? I don't know. Does that make me strange?"
Let me know what you think in the comments or visit me on tumblr and shoot me a message!
"No."
Cas sniffed again but stood a little taller. "That's a big promise, Dean."
Dean looked him in the eyes and just stayed there. He wasn’t sure what exactly Dean was trying to find, whether it was an answer to the mess in the kitchen or how the once angel wasn’t capable of wrapping his own hand. Castiel, though, found sympathy in his green eyes as they searched. He’d grown to understand human emotion better and better as the years dragged on, or better yet he had grown to understand Dean’s emotions better and better. Ninety percent of the time he spent with other humans was with only Dean so he wasn’t quite up to par with other humans, but he was up to par with the hunter. Right now, he didn’t like the sympathy been thrown at him. He was a human, not a child.
“This is where the energy was leading you?” Castiel asked just to be sure.
His human life home.
Castiel smiled through his quivering chin and tears rolling down his cheeks. The pressure in his chest was familiar, but in a different way. He wasn’t panicking this time, he was happy. Dean had told him he loved him before, but not like that. He understood what the human custom was with rings, and while he didn’t want to assume, he was almost positive about what Dean was about to ask him.
Castiel shook his head. "Don't mistake nostalgia for my grace as being resentment towards you, Dean. It wasn't your fault that I lost my grace and it's not your fault that I'm grieving it's loss."
“Castiel!”
Castiel frowned, "of course, Dean." He pat the ground beside him. "You never have to ask."
“You want to take Jack on your missions?” Dean asked as he finally stepped around Sam and joined the rest of them in the hallway. His tone already laced with disagreement and Castiel sighed, rolling his eyes. This clearly wasn't going to go as he had hoped.
"What?"
Dean cleared his throat, grabbing both Sam and his attention. “Guys, I know talking about Jack is hard but…”
"I know you've escaped before, Dean."
“And she asked you to come here, right?” Tanya nodded again with a gasp.
Castiel took the bowl from her hands with a real smile. "We've been through this, Hannah." He said soft but firm. "I'm not the head alpha. You don't need to bring me my food. I can fetch it myself."
Castiel sobbed, "I can't. I can't."
“But I didn’t, right?” Dean stopped a half a step away from Cas. “I’m here in one piece.”
Waiting till he heard the creak from the bottom step signaling Dean had reached the downstairs, he wandered into the bathroom. The light was blinding when he flipped the switch, squinting his eyes in an attempt to block the light as he shut and locked the bathroom door. The longer he was awake, the longer he knew it would take to fall back asleep. It was only logical that falling asleep would send him back. Every time he fell asleep he experienced the other world, this had to be no different.
Michael’s hands continued to move reassuringly over his thighs before he sighed. "We're gonna stop for a sec, okay?"
Castiel stood slowly, feeling awkward. Michael regarded him carefully before gesturing at his chest. "Take off your clothes, but leave your underwear on." Castiel stalled long enough to grab Michael’s attention. "You okay?"
Let me know what you think in the comments or visit me on tumblr!
“They said they grabbed you, fighting the whole way. That doesn't sound like an angel that intentionally killed thousands of their own kind.”
The nephilim had wanted to jump right into their mission but Castiel had refused his pleas. He had noticed how Jack would periodically rest against the car door and knew the nephilim must have lied about sleeping well the night before. Souls were unpredictable and he didn't want Jack getting hurt because he was too tired to focus. Since the motel was only a few miles away from the soul sighting, they stopped, Jack only surrendering after Castiel mentioned wanting to do research before hand anyways.
Michael stood up from the chair, then pushed it to the side. He crowded into Castiel’s space, leaving mere inches between them. With a soft voice, he murmured, "Turn around."
Dean touched this own neck self-consciously and covered the bite mark. "That’s the least of our problems."
“As old as time itself.” She retorted, a slight annoyance in her tone.
"Your bite," Castiel gestured to Dean's neck, "it's already starting to heal." Dean caught a scent of disappointment leaking through Cas’s scent.
"And from the looks of it," the nurse continued, "he never knotted the bitch either."
Castiel grinned at Amelia but didn't miss the tension in her arms. His daughter's tiny fingers were wrapped around the cross that hung from her mother's neck --something she’d been doing since birth-- while she fed. “You should sit, mother." He said. "No need to strain unnecessarily.”
I couldn't quite make it a full week. Here's chapter three! Dean and Cas get to know each other a little bit more. In the...biblical sense ;)
Ever since the battle with Lucifer, Jack had been having a hard time sleeping. Most nights he found himself perched next to the young nephilims bed at night, ready to block out any nightmares that may pop up. Jack never mentioned not being okay with it, so he continued to do so. Well, that was when he wasn't sleeping himself, apparently.
"By downing an entire bottle of pills?" Dean asked incredulously.
“I have to check on Duma. I will see you all at dinner, alright?”
“I'm sorry, Castiel.” She said, releasing his arm.
Castiel smiled softly. “I doubt Inias is anywhere close to being ready for a mate.”
Castiel squinted. “Yes we helped, but not all of us were good for the humans, Lailah.”
--------------
Just like the first time, Michael removed himself from him. While Castiel was still trying to catch his breath, Michael leaned against him, causing him to cry out at the sudden physical contact.
He closed his eyes and sighed. If worse came to worse, he could just wipe her memory. Giving in, he let go of Jack’s shoulder and nodded.
“Thank you, for healing me earlier.” She said, shoulders slightly more relaxed than they had been. “Perhaps when all this is over, finding the souls, we could work together.”
Castiel wrapped his free arm around the omegas neck, gripped his chin, and pulled him back just enough to steal a deep filthy kiss. The omegas back arched beautifully, both hands still planted on the bed while Castiel kissed and pounded into him. His knot was throbbing at the base and he was inching closer and closer to no return. His omega was going to feel it for days. He'd make sure of it.
There was something wrong, he was sure of it. Angels simply didn’t dream and, even if they did, they never dreamt as intensely and vividly as he had been. Ever since he had awoken, there was a heavy buzzing under his skin. As if the dream world was trying to come forward and force itself onto him. As if the human him was still there, a real being living through him in this other world. No, the real world. Human him was just a dream, even if a part of him was having a hard time believing it.
He sighed. “I’m not sure.”
Castiel learns a terrible truth.
“Oh.” Castiel nodded absently. He hadn’t expected an offer like that from Lailah or from any angel.
“Don’t say it.”
He couldn’t say it.
"No," The nurse interrupted. "That fucking mut couldn't do one thing right."
Dean sighed, but nodded. “Alright.” He stood up and pulled Castiel into a hug. “Just promise you'll call me if you start to feel it happening again, okay? I can be here in 10 minutes.”
"Okay. I think I understand now."
The closer they got to the tracks, the more a faint buzzing started to vibrate against his grace. “Yes, I can feel it calling out. The signal isn’t strong though.”
Castiel quietly gasped.
The closer he got, the more he recognized the song being hummed.
"Pleasepleasepleaseplease." His need for release grew stronger and stronger until he was teetering on the edge of orgasm. Castiel could feel sweat dripping all over his face as he bucked his hips and thrust into Michael's tight fist relentlessly.
Castiel braced himself and inclined his head in the affirmative. He had come for a reason; he had sought out Michael specifically to have some sort of sexual encounter before he graduated a completely inexperienced virgin.
Castiel sighed. "I just…," he paused and looked down at the underwear, now covering his modesty. How could he explain?
“We are?”
Castiel felt Dean drag his fingers down towards the center of his stomach. "Twenty-eight."
“So, you remember the grill?”
That was unexpected.
There was some shuffling at the door before a man came busting in. "Did it work? Is he-"
“Shut up bitch.”
“Castiel.” Lailah grabbed his attention, pointing at the cemetery that came into view. He noticed a car was there now, parked next to the headstone of the missing soul. Why would a human be out so late?
The sun was setting now, the sky cast in a beautiful hue of orange and purple. Castiel would have taken the time to enjoy it if he wasn’t heavy with a growing fear and agitation. They hadn’t found the soul or Jack yet. With their luck the soul had probably already become a ghost.
Castiel regarded Sam. "Would he like them?"
Michael's hand wrapped around Castiel’s cock again; only this time, there was nothing soft or slow about it. Michael gripped him tight and pumped him like his life depended on it. Castiel shouted out as his climax quickly rushed to the surface.
Dean rolled his eyes in forced agreement. “Yea, well, haven't you done enough? I mean if it wasn't for you, Heaven wouldn't even exist right now.”
Castiel raised his eyebrows and nodded with a smirk. The nephilim was more observant than he thought. “Yes, that’s your grace, well the essence of you, that is reacting to the human souls presence.”
“Jack!” Castiel shouted at the nephilim as smoke rose from where his hand laid on her arm.
It was only a few seconds before Castiel could feel the omegas cock and channel throb. Cum coated his hand while more slick dripped down his cock and thighs. He fucked the omega through it, inching closer to his own climax.
“Emotions. Free will.”
Jack glanced at the clock and shrugged. “About 20 minutes ago.”
“Hey!” Dean turned to see a guard slowly making their way towards them. “Obey, mutt!”
Castiel grabbed a couple beers out of the fridge while Dean filled his plate with another burger and brat (his third plate). Once they were both happy with what they had, they went back outside.
Dean glanced around and didn't see anyone. He forced them to stop before they got too close to the group of guards. Sam’s visor was still down, but he tried to reach his eyes anyways. "I do trust you, Sam. I do. But this ain't your plan, it's theirs."
The nephilim was over a year old already, but there was so much he never got to experience; His first year filled with fighting and death and hatred and war, things a young child should never have to experience. He was glad the nephilim was able to find peace in small moments like this one. If he was destined to have Lucifer as a father, then Castiel was glad Kelly ended up being his mother; Her gentle spirit allowing the nephilim to feel things Lucifer was never capable of.
I hope you enjoy!
“Like the battle with Raphael?”
“About him being a nephilim?” Sam cut him off, “No. I just said that he was a kid with a messed up past.” Castiel nodded at nothing since Sam wasn’t looking at him. “Talking about him helped a lot.”
Cas closed his eyes and shook his head. "It's all my fault-"
“I do.” He said with honesty. “I miss the heaven from before the fighting, the apocalypse. When all my garrison had to do was watch over humanity and protect them from unknown threats…”
“He honestly hadn’t even thought to kill the engine,” Sam continued, “he just let it keep bouncing around until I ran over and did it myself. Bill was furious, and you know how calm Bill can be.”
Let me know what you think in the comments or visit me on tumblr!
Castiel huffed through a growl. Deep in his subconscious he remembered. A promise he'd made. He wasn't supposed to knot the omega. But why? Why deny the privilege, the utopia, of being knotted?
One of the omegas that had been clinging to Cas stepped up next to them. Her long dark hair flowed over her exposed shoulders and her eyes were wide with something Dean couldn't put his finger on. Her scent was wild, but being as they just met, he wasn't going to try and decipher the different notes.
“Of course I do.” He hissed as the new pain slowly started to ebb away into the old throbbing pain.
*****
Castiel gasped and pressed down, arching up high against his tiptoes and gritted, "Michael!" through his clenched teeth.
"Three days, Dean."
Dean found himself relaxing in the rotting meat scent of rage that filled the small space. His alpha was upset at the mere thought of him being hurt and he did his best to stop his inner omega from preening. “Hey, alpha, it’s okay,” Dean soothed quickly, hands up as he stepped closer. “I’m okay. I made it here. It’s going to be okay.”
Let me know what you think in the comments or visit me on tumblr and shoot me a message!
“Unless…” She started, looking up at him. “You don’t plan on coming back to heaven.”
Dean whimpered and shook as the nurse pulled the tube out roughly and plopped it down on the counter next to the table. "Call Dr. Adler," He commanded the guard outside.
After a few minutes they pulled apart, each wiping their faces.
"I know"
"Dean-"
A single drop of sweat cascaded behind his ear. His rut was on its way, maybe by nightfall. Castiel didn't want to deal with another rut. The scentless still looked for him to provide more pups, and he hated himself for having given in three times -- two of which created Claire and Jack. He had never wanted to mate with any of them in the first place. It had been merely a business transaction made out of desperation.
He sighed and shook his head before looking away at the counter. “I want to be…” Dean dropped his hand and set his empty paper plate down on the counter. “...i just….it’s hard today.”
He nodded. “When they released me, I had given up out of fear. I knew that what was planned was wrong, but their ways can be... persuasive. I fell back in line and just followed orders blindly. When it came to the final moments before Lucifer was released, I was re awoken. Heaven didn’t care what happened to humanity, our charges, but the Winchesters did. I had a choice. Allow humanity to fall at the hands of heaven, or fight back.”
Castiel took the opportunity to walk up again. “We really do need to get you back, Haley. You don’t want to be stuck as a spirit.” Haley nodded this time, unwilling to fight. Castiel was grateful for the change in heart. He was terrified that she would fight back or that something would go wrong. Castiel stepped back, allowing them their last goodbyes.
“Haley! My precious baby!” Jack/Haley started crying too.
**********----------**********
The feel of the bed dipping next to him had him opening his eyes. The room was brighter now with the sun fully up. If Castiel had to guess, it was probably 5 or 6 in the morning.
Dean nodded. "Yea, Cas. I'm fine." He could see redness in Castiel's eyes, but not the rut kind of redness. The alpha had been crying. "Are you? What happened?"
Dean squinted, "well yea Cas, I said everyone. That includes pups."
----<><><><><><><><>----
“I’m sorry it took me so long to realize, or maybe I already realized and it just never clicked, but,” Dean paused, took a deep breath, and met Castiel’s gaze. “I need you, Cas.”
Sam picked at the plastic on his chairs armrest. “Dean mentioned your panic attacks.”
Please enjoy Part 2 of Day 2!
Kelly nodded a “Yes, alpha” before she turned to grab Amelia’s mate, James, attention. He usually helped with rations as some of the other alpha’s didn’t appreciate orders on what they could and couldn’t eat by an omega. How anyone could still be that archaic was beyond him.
"You're going to save them?" She asked earnestly.
Lailah frowned. “That can’t be right. The first incident was on the ferry then the second there.” She said pointing back to where they had just been. “The soul wouldn’t turn around, it would keep moving forward.” She looked to Castiel for confirmation but he just shrugged. He wasn’t sure what to make of the situation.
"Good," Michael smirked and waved his hand towards him. "Go ahead, then."
Minutes, maybe even hours, went by before Dean finally spoke.
Out of frustration, he took the steps too fast and tripped, slamming his non covered toes into the next stair. He yelled out in pain, hopping up the remaining step. The frustration from the day and the now very human pain throbbing in his foot sent his anger into overdrive. Curling his fingers while he spun on one foot, he drew back and threw his fist into the back door; shards of wood exploding into the home as his fist went through it. He grunted as his body kept moving forward from the momentum and he ended up shoulder deep in his door. The surprise caught him off guard and his shoulders relaxed, a new pain slowly trickling up his forearm. Tilting his head forward, he pressed his head against the door and took a deep breath. He would say “what could be worse” but he already knew the answer to that question.
Dean’s arms gave out and he collapsed against the table. Tears welled in Dean's eyes as relief flooded through him. He wasn't with pup. Cas kept his promise and Dean no longer had to worry about raising a pup in the sex torture dungeon he’d found himself in. Couldn’t do one thing right?
Castiel looked up at the nephilim, taking in the fact that he was actually standing there in front of him. He was freshly showered, a toothbrush hanging from his mouth. There were bags under his eyes, proof that the nephilim wasn’t getting any proper sleep, but he still looked wide awake. If anything he looked excited.
Castiel turned to face him and reached forward but retracted his hand almost immediately. Dean froze. He wanted Cas to touch him, but also didn't. Things between them were going to be more complicated than he realized.
Another was coming from his right, begging for help. For his help. It too was warm, almost hot. Reaching out to try and take him. He wanted to be taken, to be led somewhere, taking his decision for him. It was familiar, the voice, but he couldn't quite place it.
(See the end of the chapter for
Well, this chapter was quite a struggle. I'm so so so sorry for taking so long to get this chapter up. There was something about this chapter that I just couldn't figure out and I;m glad I waited because the scene I added made me feel SOO much better.
He’d been uncertain, of course he had been. If he wanted to continue his work out here in Willow River, however, he needed a Familiar. Any casting that required energy beyond his own personal store was unreliable at best. At worst, a disaster. Energies pulled from the world around them without filtering through a Familiar had a tendency to act in unpredictable ways. It had hampered Castiel’s magic greatly to be without. He had been able to borrow Charlie, for emergencies, but that was not a sustainable solution.
Dean stroked his thumb against the pulsepoint in Cas’ wrist. “I know, Cas. I know. I just… I couldn’t live with not doing anything. I don’t think you could, either.”
“You do realize I’m getting your base emotions and nowhere do you feel actual disgust.” Cas refilled his glass. “Was Sam named for your grandfather? An interesting choice, given your mother’s history with Samuel Campbell.”
“I appreciate it.”
“I’d recommend leaving that for Cas,” Charlie helpfully suggested.
“I enjoy peach cobbler, is what I enjoy. You have some of that in your settlement?”
Charlie glanced off towards Walt, who stood over near the Water gate, arms crossed and glaring at Dean. “I don’t know that’s such a great idea.”
Dean was still quiet by the time they returned to camp that night, overwhelmed by the sheer scope and immensity of corruption on the other side of the Great River. He didn't find many things daunting. He figured he could conquer just about anything with a smile and a can-do attitude, but this? Healing the corruption felt like it would be an impossible task.
“City boy, aren’t you,” she said, affectionate amusement in her tone. “It’s the waste from the process. Has some nutrients still in there, so we don’t just discard it. Bobby knows where the buckets are.”
Dean pushed a book aside to give himself room to lean on the table and look down at the drawing. There was enough preservation magic imbued in the pages that the ink was still dark, but the writing was cramped and spidery. Dean snorted. “Way to be a cliché with the handwriting. Did Witches used to take classes on how to cause eye strain for future generations? What was it believed to contain, and what does it actually do?”
Haley/Jack turned towards Castiel and Lailah. “With their help. They know how to get me back.”
The omega stayed a moment longer before he retreated to his hut. Castiel would visit him later, as promised. It had been far too long since he’d gotten to spend his rut in the company of another male. He couldn’t be happier it would be spent with Inias.
“Your daughter, Haley, she came to you in a dream, right?” Jack asked.
Castiel awoke with a start, sweat dripping down his forehead as he sat up in his bed. It took him a few seconds before he registered the room he was in. Brick walls, a small dresser to his right and a small desk just ahead? He was in the bunker, specifically the room the brothers had given to him for when he was bored and they were sleeping. Shifting in the bed, he smacked his lips and tongue. A strange taste was in his mouth and he cringed at it. There was something familiar about the taste, if he could just pinpoint what it was.
He chuckled at Castiel before opening the door wider. "Come on in, man. Don't need you passing out in the hallway." Castiel’s eyes snapped to the man, he panicked, then quickly shuffled inside. "Don't worry if you do. Wouldn't be the first time." He added as Castiel squeezed between the man and the doorframe.
None of this will ever be okay.
Castiel stopped. Sam was right, he shouldn’t say it.
Dean took his hand back and wiped both on his pants."No, I'm sorry. I'm not trying to make you feel bad. Sam was right, I shouldn't have said anything." He stood up and started to walk away.
Dean shrugged as best he could being on his side. "Older than me."
Sam looked around again. Dean glanced and saw a nurse standing not too far away, facing away. “Come on, we should hurry." Sam whispered.
“This way.”
"The guards." She started. "They brought less food than usual."
“For hiding. For not helping heaven like I could have.” She said, eyes cast down at the ground in remorse.
Amelia chuckled, her eyes warm. “I sit all day. Plus, feeding Claire certainly comes with perks." She lifted and flexed an arm. "I’ve more muscle now than I’ve ever had before.”
She whimpered and pulled back as Castiel attempted to touch and heal it. “He did something to me so I can’t heal myself!”
He didn't need the Winchester's permission, he just liked keeping them informed. Tracking down human souls that had fallen from heaven was imperative to repairing heaven permanently. It wouldn't be too hard, what could go wrong?
“Yes, but in the same way you consider the brothers?”
“And you are?” Castiel asked, already knowing the answer.
Castiel threw his head back into the mattress and laughed. Really truly laughed. "Oh, really? You don't think you're being a little vain?"
Dean laughed a groan as he plopped down onto the couch. “Oh man, you guys aren’t gonna play Scrabble are you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel clenched his jaw. “For how long?”
That voice. He knew that voice. That voice would be ingrained in his memories for the rest of his life. He slowly turned around and took in the person standing before him. She was just as he remembered. Long flowing red hair, hazel eyes, soft smile. He remembered her being much taller, but then again he was only a pup when she had died. His heart raced in his chest as she reached out, her hand cupping his face.
"Who's that?" Someone gasped, pointing at him.
Micheal hummed and scratched Castiel’s belly lightly. The sensation helped Castiel relax enough to sigh and adjust his stance to be more comfortable. He was still shaking but far less than he had been a moment ago.
Dean cocked an eyebrow. "Will I...?"
Still unable to open his eyes, he felt hands slide up and down his thighs, offering comfort that only made him tense up more. "S-sorry."
Michael rolled his head from side to side. "Well, I wouldn't exactly call this sex, but no, they don't." Castiel sagged in the chair.
Michael was smiling at him. "You're doing so well for your first time."
So, Dean is figuring out what the scent bond means to him. Was it a good idea that he eavesdropped on his and Inias's argument? Think he'll ever actually talk to Cas about it?
Sufficiently soaked, Castiel moved his hand back to the omega’s cock and took hold. His omega thrusted his hips forward and groaned deep. A shiver made its way down Castiel’s spine at the sound. His cock slid along the omegas perineum as he pressed forward. The omega gasped and dropped his head down.
He could hear someone whimpering now. Flicking his eyes behind Dean, he saw Sam standing there, eyes fixed on him, but not crying. He looked back at Dean and saw that he too was not crying.
The demon tightened it's gripped and raised him up onto his knees. Someone screamed in front of him. A glance to the left showed one of the other demons had grabbed Jack and was throwing him across the yard into another gravestone. He tried to yell Jacks name but the grip around his neck was too tight. The demon that had him started to chant in enochian. He recognized the spell immediately. It was the same chant that Alistair had tried to use to banish him all those years ago. How had a low level demon like this one gotten that spell?
Castiel squeezed his eyes shut willing that voice to go away. Today was going to be and had already been, hard enough. Dreaming about and hearing his voice? That was something he could do without.
. Dean wanted to be concerned, worry about that tiny voice, but he was more worried about whether he'd see the alpha again. The alpha that had taken care of him. The alpha that had almost died for him. The alpha that was currently growing further and further away as he was pushed ahead of Dean. The escape plan, as far as Dean was concerned, required him being brought to Castiel’s pack. They did everything Sam asked, and now all they could do was pray the fake bite was believable.
Castiel's eyebrows shot up as Dean turned his gaze down and away. "Oh, Dean, hey." He reached out and placed a hand along Dean's cheek, coaxing Dean to look at him. The last thing he wanted was for Dean to think he didn't want to be with him. Dean didn't move, but he allowed Castiel to keep his hand on his cheek.
"I was asking Claire what time she needed us to be there," he says flatly, and Dean
Dean snorts and spins his chair around; he plucks the pen from his mouth and points it at Andy. "The answer to that question is a resounding no. I guess it's sort of like our hazing ritual. Just bullshit your way through it and you'll be fine."
"It was his choice," Dean lies.
, as well as actually get around to reading the thing. Actually, those are both things he should have started or completed by now, but he's far from a model grad student. He needs to shape himself up into one soon enough though because in a week he's taking exams in his courses, two mock-comps exams. Everyone he runs into in the department seems to have a stress cloud buzzing around their head like Charlie Brown's messy friend Pigpen, and Dean can't even stand to sit in his office anymore.
"Goodbye, Dean." He steps back, and Dean hesitates a moment longer before he decides that he doesn't belong here anymore. The early morning is cold when he steps out, the chill stealing through him as he makes his way to the car.
By the time the clock either says six or eight, Dean can’t even be bothered to squint at it because Castiel is riding him with way too much energy for a freshly deflowered virgin, but he said he wanted to try it, and, well, Dean was too magnanimous to say no. Dean’s the one who cries out this time, his hips jerking up against Castiel.
?” Castiel’s face flickers in response to Dean’s rather unbelieving question and his shoulders lift in a barely-there shrug.
“Maybe it’s true what they say about pets and their owners. She wants to put her tongue all over you just as much as I do.”
There's the briefest, barest flicker of a smile, and then Castiel's hand cups his neck and pulls him in for a kiss that's all pent-up desire, and it's pretty obvious that Castiel's throwing everything to the wind. Dean meets his intensity, parts Castiel's lips with his tongue, licks into his mouth; when he tugs lightly at Castiel's hair, he elicits a small, muffled noise, and Dean becomes obsessed with hearing it again.
Dean blinks and shifts his weight on his feet. "Right. I guess I did." So, seems like this isn't going very well. Maybe he'll have to cross this place off his list again.
Castiel half-turns with a half-smile. "Friends. I'd like that."
"Now," Castiel hisses, canting his hips up, and Dean has to compensate for how he nearly groans from the whole display.
The two angels followed close behind, both curious to see what would happen next.
“Yeah? I thought for sure you were going to fight me on that.”
Dean's pulse thumped heavily in neck. They hadn’t done that last time. Had Cas not pulled out quick enough? Was he? Bile started to rise in his throat. He couldn't be pregnant, he just couldn't. Not here. Not like this.
"I thought you were happy being human?"
Red. Everything was red
“Remember.”
“Haley?” Tanya scoffed, stepping back a bit. “A-are you a medium?”
Michael winked, and Castiel blushed. "Don't apologize; it's fine." Michael studied him for a moment before clapping his hands against his thighs. "You want water? Soda?"
Castiel opened his eyes with a squint, the afternoon sun beating down on his face. He groaned, shoving his face down into the pillow.
Strange
Haley Koviet
“No.” He shook his head. “It’s kind of like I can sense how many times she’s been here. Some are strong and some are weak. I think she’s been traveling back and forth.”
“Let’s split up and look.” Lailah suggested. Jack and Castiel nodded in agreement before heading off in different directions.
He had to look away at that. What could he say? He wasn't okay, but he wasn't not okay enough to make Dean worry. Right?
"Alpha?"
Castiel stood, the two omega females still clinging to him. Dean pushed down the wave of jealousy bubbling up. They were probably Cas’s pup's mother's. Cas had said he prefered male omegas so It was fine. Everything was fine. Dean took a moment to wonder why he even cared. They weren't mates or anything.
“For what?”
Dean shuffled on his feet. The emotions rolling off Cas were making him almost dizzy. He placed a hand on his stomach to try and tame the flips his stomach was doing. When he looked up, Castiel's eyes were blown wide.
"Please please please."
They had been wandering through the gravestones for a few hours, Castiel reading the names and dates on each one. Neither of them had found anything of interest and Lailah was getting tense. She wanted to go back to the tracks, he knew that, but Jack had followed the souls energy to this spot. Hopefully they’d find something before she felt the trip a complete waste.
The omega lifted his head as Castiel continued to pound into him. His knot was starting to catch at every push providing the perfect amount of friction, but his omega needed to come first. The omegas cock was hard in Castiel's fist and he could feel the heat emanating off his omegas sweat-soaked skin.
Burden. Burden. Burden. Burden. Burden.
Dean squeezed him tighter. "I don't know yet, but I'm going to do everything I can to get them back to you. All of them.” Dean stepped out of Castiel’s grasp. He placed his hands on either side of the alpha’s face and brushed a few tears away with his thumbs. He was giving the alpha false hope, but Dean still planned to deliver as best he could.
Sam shook his head. Dean nodded before pushing his chair back and standing as well. “I’ll come with you. Sam, you want another burger or brat?” Sam shook his head again, his eyes still studying Castiel.
Castiel frowned, feeling as if the conversation had been disappointing to the nephilim. As if he had missed something Jack had been asking. “Your mother would be proud of you.” Jack looked down into lap before looking away through his window.
Castiel shook his head. "I was trying to go back to sleep."
Or visit me on twitter!
Castiel, for some unknown reason, believed him wholeheartedly.
"The plan. It's practically fail-proof." Sam pushed him to keep moving as more doctors, nurses, and guards rounded the hallway.
“Cas is leaving?” He heard Dean ask from behind Sam.
Castiel opened his eyes and got to his feet, eager to keep going. Michael was already standing, his fingers twisting in a signal for him to turn around. Castiel did as he was told and turned his back to Michael. Like before, Michael pressed up behind him, his hands, now covered in lube, slipped across Castiel’s stomach. One hand trailed up and pinched his nipple. Castiel gasped and tilted his head back again, resting it against the side of Michael's head. Sparks of pleasure shot straight to his dick from the added stimulation.
“What’s Friday night?” Dean asked as he pulled them both to the old couch.
"Can I ask…," Michael paused and looked him in the eyes. "Why did you wanna do this with me if you're a virgin?"
“Agreed.”
“The energy is extremely strong here.” Jack stated, crouching down to touch a wilting flower that was in a vase attached to the side. “She comes here often.”
Deep down, Castiel knew he wanted to do this, he wanted it more than anything, but another part of him was terrified. He'd never done anything like this before. No handjobs, blowjobs, or even heavy petting. Nothing. Here, with Michael, this moment was going to be his first sexual encounter with another person, and he had no idea what to expect. Sure he'd watched porn--lots of porn--but standing here, half-naked in front of a gorgeous stranger, was nothing like the videos he'd seen; not even the ones Balthazaar had made him watch.
"How's your heat?" Castiel asked with a grin.
Okay, so I figured I'd just post this one also since it was done and I've only been obsessed with this chapter since I first imagined it over a year ago. The remaining chapters are all written, so i wouldn't be surprised if the remaining chapters get posted by Sunday lol
With that, Dean finally leaned back in his chair and stood just before giving Castiel a smirk he had learned to understand to mean ‘we’ll continue this later’.
Anyways, again, apologies for the late update. I hope you enjoy this chapter!
With an eye roll, she shook her head. “Fine.”
The autumn sun beat down on them as they made their way down the side road. There were no sidewalks where they were, only a shallow shoulder that dropped down into the rocks where the lake washed up. Train tracks laid just above, as if a haven for anyone who tumbled down, saving them from falling into the rocks and lake below. Every few minutes a car would pass by from either direction, none of them giving the odd trio a thought, but leaving a gust of wind behind to rustle at his coat.
“Yes.” Lailah frowned. “I could sense you when you got to town. You can help me!”
Castiel turned to see Inias-- the scrawny male omega of their village-- walking towards him. His long brown hair hid his pale face away and made him seem meek and fragile, falling into the stereotypical male omega body build. Although Inias was twenty-seven years old, he passed as a teen. The loincloth he wore only supported how thin and bony he was. Before, Castiel's type was usually men of his build and height, but, ever since Inias had joined them a few months back, he found he couldn't stay away from the boy. He wasn’t sure what it was exactly, but the omega had a way about him that drew him in. Maybe one day he'd figure it out, but for now, he'd just enjoy the omegas company.
Castiel opened his eyes as Michael pulled away from him. He watched Michael move around him to sit on the couch. Michael slid to the edge of his seat and watched while Castiel slowly slipped his underwear down. The warm air of the room drifted across his newly exposed skin. Michael's stare, combined with his own nakedness, sent a wave of tingles through his body. To be standing, completely naked, in front of a fully clothed stranger, was a feat Castiel had never thought of as being significant till now. It made him surprisingly confident and helped to calm him. Soon enough, the gorgeous man in front of him would be touching him and bringing him somewhere he'd only ever brought himself.
Then who was crying?
“Castiel!”
"Alpha what's going on?"
Sam slowly turned his head towards him now. “Wh-what?”
Enjoy!
Dean's heart rate picked up again the closer Cas got. He could feel himself leaning forward towards the alpha and had to actively stop his feet from moving. They hadn't mated. He was being ridiculous.
Castiel wriggled in the chair as, once again, Michael’s hand wrapped around his throbbing cock. He whimpered and settled back against Michael’s body. Michael massaged and teased and drove Castiel absolutely insane. For a while, he would just pump, then he'd squeeze and twist at his head, then he'd let go and swipe a finger down his over-sensitive vein. Sparks shot through his limbs with every touch, lighting up his senses. He felt more alive than he'd ever felt before. It was as if Michael knew precisely where Castiel wanted to be touched without needing to be told. He was a fucking mind reader.
"And?" He attempted to keep his emotions light as not to overwhelm his omega’s.
He reached up to rub his eyes, the feeling of wetness very much present. When he pulled his hand away, a small puddle was now there. “Odd.”
"You’re doing so good.”
Dean turned to look at him. “Yea?”
There was a tremor in Castiel's hands as he started to remove his hoodie. Michael's eyes stayed locked on him. He watched as Castiel pulled the hoodie up and over his head, folded it, and laid it at the end of the futon. The hunger in Michael’s eyes made him even more anxious. He tried to go slow, toying with the hem of his shirt for a few moments to buy him some time to regain his composure. Eventually, he knew that he'd have to drop his pants, and they'd get down to business.
(See the end of the chapter for
It had been months since he’d last seen his little brother. Some nights he could still hear Sam’s shouts as they were both dragged away from each other in the looted gas station. Dean started to struggle but one look from Sam told him to relax. He could do that. He could relax. But Sammy. It was Sammy.
“Killed him.” Sam finished. Castiel looked over at sam. He saw the anger mixed with sadness battling in his facial expressions.
Dialogue is my nemesis, I SWEAR. It's shorter than usual, but I had to stop where I did. Things are going to get CRAZY next chapter, so prepare yourselves!
“You don’t think it needs ornaments or something?” Dean questioned. “There’s probably some stuff from our old gear that-”
He felt a little better now that he was showered and dressed sipping his coffee as Dean pulled his work boots on. It was something they did every morning Dean had to work. Castiel would get up with him, they'd both shower, sometimes together and sometimes not, he'd make coffee as Dean put his work stuff on and then they'd kiss goodbye as Castiel would hand over Dean's thermos. Once Dean would leave he'd take a second cup to the back porch until he felt awake enough to attack the day.
Castiel settled close against Dean, their shoulders touching. “It looks perfect.”
"I don't understand," Castiel said as he stopped to frown at the shelves of outdoor lights, "icicles don't emit light."
Taking another deep breath, he sighed giving a small nod. “Yea.”
"Shh. You've been such a good boy for me."
Castiel sighed. “I think we should start our search at the last known location. There may be something there that could help us find where the soul is headed.”
Castiel froze. “No Knotting.”
He reached out his hand and gripped Dean's calf, his thumb running circles into his shin. “Thank you, Dean.”
Lailah sighed heavily. Finally deciding to relieve her from the onslaught of questions, he placed a hand on Jack's shoulder, having the nephilim slow to his own pace and leave Lailah to lead.
“One. Two. Three....”
"I have orders to take him to his alpha's pack,” Sam stated. “They're mated."
The more Castiel talked, the easier he found it was to let it all out. Dean made them both sandwiches while every detail he remembered came spilling out. From finding Jack alive, to the drive, to the graveyard and the demons. The similar thread being sleep in both versions. That each time he woke up, no matter what version he was in, it felt like it was real and the other was fake. He gave up everything, and felt like weights had been lifted from his shoulders.
"What IS the plan?" Dean whispered as the further down they got, the more guards suddenly appeared.
“It’s definitely a soul.” Lailah stated, pushing past a branch as they cleared the tree line.
"So most virgins don't pay for sex?" He’d feared that would be the case.
Dean made a good point. He had forgotten how much Sam had also been hurting, had forgotten that he wasn’t alone. Maybe talking about it, as much as he didn’t want to, was actually the right thing to do?
__________
Jack tilted his head back and sighed. The strange energy that was around Jack suddenly grew, spanning out across his entire body. Castiel started to grow panicked.
"How?"
Jack must have accepted the lie because he started nodding before finishing brushing his teeth.
Castiel tilted his head as he followed him down. “How did you know?”
Red tinted Dean’s cheeks. He reached behind to rub the back of his neck. Castiel found it cute. "Umm. I'm not much of a singer, Cas."
Castiel did as he was told, grabbing the chair and twisting it to straddle the seat. Michael's hands wrapped around Castiel’s torso and rolled him back until the chair stopped when it hit the couch. Castiel wrapped his feet around the base to keep it from moving while Michael settled behind him, his hands roaming Castiel's chest.
He took a deep breath. “No, Jack. It doesn't make you a bad person.” Castiel's mouth moved as he tried to keep going but couldn't find the right words to say. His own bias wanted to praise Jack on having saved the world by killing the devil, but no matter what, Lucifer had been Jack's father, present or not. Jack continued to watch as Castiel struggled to find words.
Castiel slowly shook his head. He could feel his inner alpha fighting his way forward demanding attention. In one second he wanted to run from Dean, in the next he wanted to throw him across the picnic table and show him what a real alpha was capable of. He had to be careful, let the omega know. He had to.
They both turned back forward, continuing towards the cemetery.
Castiel frowned. "About what?"
“Oh.”
She kneeled next to the rock he was on and offered him the bowl with her arms outstretched before her. Her long brown hair was matted to her forehead and her ratted thin cloth top drooped on her chest from sweat. Hannah's usual flowery scent was weaker, overwhelmed by the fear she always felt since they arrived. Hannah was an excellent omega and she deserved much better than their current circumstances. They all did.
Castiel visibly and emotionally relaxed, his head dropping to his chest. "Oh, thank god."
“Good omega.” Castiel cooed. His omega whined once more and his resolve dissipated. With a quick swipe of a finger along the omegas taint, Castiel gripped his own cock and pressed in. They moaned in unison as Castiel pressed in and pulled out, slowly at first but gaining speed as they went.
"Don’t apologize," Michael corrects, but not unkindly.
"Gee, you make it sound so simple, Sam." Dean grit out.
“No, you don’t understand.” She begged, light flickering faster. “She’s going to be here, I know it. I have to see her, please!”
He paused, a shiver crawling up his vessels spine as he turned towards the nephilim running up behind him. Shock hit him as he realized Jack was alive. Hadn't Jack died? How could he be here smiling right in front of him?
The nephilim stood on the grass near the ferry, eyes wide in awe as the ramps opened up and the cars drove off. He was radiating pure energy, excited for a chance to drift across the lake. They inched closer as the last line of cars began to board, walking on themselves through the pedestrian ramp. The driver perched up above waved them on, smiling as Jack enthusiastically waved back. He had a way with the humans that the angel would truly never understand. The ferry began to roar as it closed the last ramp, slowly pulling away from the shore and heading across on the cables attached at each end.
A rubber band was pulling and pulling, growing taught while a small voice in the back of his mind repeated
The sound of Jack shuffling in his bed caused Castiel to turn towards him. The nephilim's eyes were squeezed shut as his head moved side to side in distress. He was having another nightmare.
The last thing Castiel remembered was Michael’s hands gripping his waist as he slipped into darkness.
Dean frowned. "Cas, that's what I'm here for! That's what-" Dean paused and shuffled his feet, "-what people like us do. They talk it out."
Slowly extracting his arm from the door, the pain from his toe still throbbing, he surveyed the damage. Lines of pink and red scratches covered his arm, small beads of blood scattered along almost every one. His hand was the the worst. Blood coated his hand from the much larger cuts, a small piece of wood protruding from it. He whimpered as he carefully gripped the piece and slowly pulled it out, more blood pooling in behind it. Using his good hand, he opened the door and headed inside. A rag that was left on the counter from the laundry caught his eye and he grabbed it, wrapping it around his bleeding hand as he made his way upstairs towards the master bath. He was sure Dean had a medical kit around somewhere.
I’m crying?
"Great. Go ahead and stand up."
The omega smiled. “Yes. You remember.” He pulled his hand back and sat up. “Please don’t forget.”
*****
Sam nodded a smile at them both before heading out, the door clicking shut softly behind him.
"One they've never made over the past few years." Castiel nodded at Kelly in agreement.
“I... “ Castiel started, swallowing as he made himself try to speak. “...I had promised Kelly that I would take care of her son. Him dying...I…” He paused, those all too familiar human emotions building in his chest.
Castiel didn’t take his eyes off the fire. “The woman you talked with.”
Castiel sighed as Dean ran the cold cloth over his skin, cleaning up the now dried cum on his chest. His skin felt alive as the sensations from the cold water and the cloth moved over his body, as if these feelings alone were going to piece him back together.
How could he figure out what was wrong?
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean swallowed back his tears and said, “I can’t believe you’re here.”
Castiel narrowed his eyes at Dean, a witty retort sitting on the tip of his tongue. Deciding to just accept what he got, he turned towards Jack and nodded for him to follow back down the hallway. “I'll keep in touch.”
Castiel shook his head, blinking as he became aware of his surroundings. Dean was standing right in front of him, one hand on Castiel's left cheek. “W-what?”
Castiel huffed. “It's my duty to…”
Castiel took a deep breath and knocked. His heart rate sped up as he listened for movement behind the door. With each passing second that he heard nothing, his anxiety skyrocketed. He was thrumming with the need to bolt and never look back. Unfortunately, or not, before he could make a move, the door latch clicked. He swallowed hard as the door slowly opened, then froze as his eyes swept over the man in front of him. He was tall, but not much taller than himself. His light brown hair was cut short on the sides with longer locks at the top that were perfectly coiffed. He was clean-shaven and had the most mesmerizing green eyes Castiel had ever seen.
“Omega.” Castiel whispered gruffly. He was out of his seat in an instant, grabbing the omega and lifting him up bridal style. “Mine.
“Thanks, Castiel. Lets go!”
"Take off your shoes and have a seat." Michael's voice snapped him back to reality.
There it was, the big question. Castiel had to look away to answer him. "I guess I’ve never really been interested in sex before, and I've never been in a relationship long enough to feel comfortable doing anything. I wanted to try
Shaking his head he tried to focus on the more obvious problem, the fact that he had dreamt. Never in his million years had he ever dreamt, so why now? And why so vivid? He could almost smell the lingering scent of dream Dean's body spray. There was also that feeling in his limbs, the same feeling he had when his dream self had fallen asleep. Plus, there was that lingering coffee taste in his mouth.
Michael’s praise and continued stimulation against his perineum drove Castiel to insanity. Distantly, he was almost certain he was crying, but all he cared about was whether Michael would let him come this time or not.
"Could you look at me, please?" Michael asked.
“I would bet you a million bucks the kid doesn’t show monday.” Sam grinned at his brother, Dean still shaking his head with laughter.
Castiel instantly found himself surrounded by darkness. He jolted at the sudden change in environment, looking around frantically. With his mouth wide open, he started to hyperventilate. There was nothing. No light. No nothing.
Castiel reached out his hand. He placed it over Dean’s own and frowned. "Please?"
Tanya immediately threw her arms around Jack/Haley and cried again. Castiel didn’t like this at all.
Sam eyed his neck. “You understood the mates part, obviously. What else do you need filling in on?” Sam cast his eyes down the hallways again.
Castiel nodded in agreement as they headed back down the winding back road. “There’s no telling where he went. I already checked the motel room and did a search through most of the town.” When he found the nephilim, they were definitely going to have a talk about the flying off.
It made sense. Separate them from their packs and do experiments on them? Why else would they seperate them as they had? Although, why had they captured them at all? Sure the nationalists believed humans like him were feral and dangerous, but he never ever imagined they’d do something like this. Or maybe he had known and just refused to see it. Balthazar had been trying to get him to go to marches and protests for Alpha and Omega rights, but he never did. He hadn’t seen the point at the time. Some people were just going to hate him and people like him and no amount of marching would have changed that. At least that’s what he had thought then. Being captured and thrown into a dome as a prisoner changed his views just a little bit. He wished with all his heart he could go back in time and listen to Balthazaar and join the protests and march in the streets with an Alpha flag in his hands. He was a human fucking being and deserved to be treated as one.
Dean's hand slowly traveled up Castiel's chest as he continued to nuzzle against Castiel’s scent gland. His fingers played with the small bit of hair Castiel had there. "Having trouble keeping up, old man?"
“Cas-” Dean interrupted, “just let me finish.”
"Hold back… just a little longer."
“Yea yea yea, protect humanity and crap we know.” He glared at Dean as the hunter waved his hands in defeat.
I am so sorry that it keeps taking me so long to update this fic!
Castiel felt like he was floating. Michael’s hand slowed, and Castiel whimpered as he started to settle down. Once his ass was back on the chair, his vision began to blur. He felt very lightheaded.
"I know." Castiel had contemplated whether he was ace or not, but as the years went on, and his curiosity grew, he realized he couldn't decide unless he experimented at least once.
“Time we won't get back.” Lailah grumbled
Glancing at the clock on the night stand between their beds, it read 8:27 am. He had been asleep for about 8 hours and he could feel it in his vessels body. It had been a very long time since he had slept for that long.
Cas’s shoulders tensed as he chewed on his lip. If Dean hadn’t been watching his every move, he would have missed the way Cas swayed into his space just a fraction of an inch before backing off. “That you are.”
Lying back, he decided to give his own vessel some rest. Of course he didn't require sleep, but he'd learned that allowing his vessel rest did make missions slightly easier. Closing his eyes, he sighed, hoping morning would come a little bit faster.
“Is everything okay?”
Let me know what you think! :)
Dean held the alpha tight as he fell apart. The anguish and pain surrounding him brought tears to his own eyes. "It's gonna be okay, Cas. I promise. We'll get Jack and we'll get Claire."
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel’s heart began to race. “No, Dean-”
*****
Castiel sighed, sitting down on the bed across from the nephilims. He wished he could do more for Jack than just ease his nightmares. He'd been through enough as a new soul, with losing his mother, being trapped in another world with strangers, then being tasked with killing his father. He was only a year old. Castiel didn't remember his first year very well, but he knew he never had come close to dealing with the things Jack had.
“Good morning, Sam.” Jack greeted.
“He’s right, Sam.”
A hand that was lightly slapping his face pulled him back. Sounds, touch, emotions, they all slammed him back into reality. Dean was kneeling in front of him, two hands cradling his face.
Castiel looked out the window of the new back door Dean had replaced while he was in the hospital. It didn’t quite match the rest of the house, but according to Dean it would once they finished the renovations Dean kept talking about. The snow was falling slowly through the back porch lights and, from what he could see of the backyard, had been for a while.
"Is everything alright?" Castiel asked.
“Dean,” Castiel interrupted, “It’s perfect the way it is.” The eldest hunter shrugged. “Our first christmas tree.”
Castiel shook his head to rid the scene that was still playing in his head, licked his lips, and toed his shoes off by the door. Michael pulled his desk chair out and sat on it backward, legs spread, as he waited for Castiel to take a seat on the futon. Knees bent to his chest, he squirmed a bit as he sat on the low-slung couch, but stopped when he heard Michael quietly chuckling.
“Please. Tanya begged. “Just a couple minutes, I promise.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Thank you, Inias." Castiel said softly as he rubbed his thumb along Inias's cheek.
Dean does some internal digging and attends the omega meeting
“Lailah.” She didn’t look up at him. “God asked us to watch over them. To…”
Amelia looked to Kelly, who sighed and looked towards the guard’s entry door. The door was barely visible through the surrounding trees, a perfect hiding spot from their watchful eyes. "The guards delivered our rations."
Tanya immediately started crying, folding over, hands over her face. “Oh my god.”
Castiel finally looked away at the fire. He couldn’t quite make sense of the feelings fluttering around in his gut, but he knew they weren’t good.
“Castiel!”
He looked up to see Hannah walking towards him, a makeshift bowl in her hands and a frown on her lips. It wasn't unusual to see the omega down, a fact he wished he could change and had tried. Hannah desperately wanted a pup, but it never seemed to work out. Since she had been taken away after her last heat, he knew they still checked her for pups. It made his skin crawl.
“I don't feel upset. My mother didn't trust him, you didn't trust him, Sam and Dean never trusted him. He was…. bad.”
So what did you think? Let me know in the comments or in my tumblr
Castiel pulled the hoodie tighter over his head as he glanced down the dormitory hallway one more time. It was mid-day, so there wasn’t anyone around, thankfully, but there was still a chance someone could see him walk into the room. He inspected the text on his phone to double-check that he had the right room number. ‘Room 401’ glared back at him and, when he looked up, a gold ‘401’ placard was affixed to the door.
“You know…” Sam started. He watched the younger man shift in his chair before shrugging off whatever was bothering him. “I started seeing this...therapist, for hunters.”
Ishim was a pain in Castiel’s side. Anytime the guards did anything different, no matter how big or small, Ishim was on his case. The alpha just didn’t know how to let go of control, a personality trait that got many packs back in the day in trouble.
“No!” Jack turned, grabbing Lailahs arm. His eyes glowed yellow.
Jack nodded. “Yes. It’s even stronger now too.”
“What if it’s like that? What if you just need to talk about it and then it will slowly go away?”
Sitting down, Castiel looked up at the horizon just visible through the line of trees at the edge of the property. The sun was just starting to finally set, casting the scattered clouds in an orange-ish, purple-ish hue. If he didn’t know better he’d say the sky was actually a beautiful painting, one made just for them by their missing friend.
“He didn’t mean it, Lailah. He doesn’t have control….”
Carefully, Dean studied his hand. “Did you clean the wounds at all?”
“And I killed him.” Castiel held his breath as he waited for Jack to continue. “I didn't know him, not like I know Sam or Dean, or you. He hurt people, and angels, and I stopped him.”
Castiel get's a peek behind the curtain
“Hello, Castiel. I’m hoping you’re done sleeping now?”
"Promise."
ENJOY
Jack, no Haley, nodded reaching out for her mom’s hands. “Yes, it’s me. Oh my god! It worked!”
Duma, his pack's makeshift nurse, was settled furthest from the guard door, just south of the fire pit. She mainly kept to herself unless making her rounds to huts with pregnant omegas or those in heats or ruts that had a rough time. Their dome didn't have much for supplies, but Duma had managed to find some herbs and plants scattered around the area. The creek that ran through the west side of the dome came in useful to her for mixing her handcrafted remedies, but the rest of them avoided that water. They had only needed to get sick once before they rationed out the water bottles. It very quickly became a more logical choice.
Stepping through the trees, a line of cars boarding a ferry came into view. “There.” Jack stated, a large smile on his face.
The guard was getting closer, shouting for Dean to obey. Sam raised his hand to halt the guard and looked back down to Dean.
The sound of Dean’s boots racing up the steps told him he was panicking.
Keeping his eyes closed, Castiel drew in a deep breath through his nose, and held it before slowly releasing out. Milo purred at his feet in the grass, enjoying the warm sunspot that bled through the tree branches. He wasn't using his claws on Castiel's foot, but he certainly wasn't not using his claws. The little shit. The two of them had their routine and it warmed Castiel's heart that he had a tiny friend to share his emotional journey with.
There's a million in one reasons why this chapter took over a month to get out, but I won't bore you with specifics. Real life can be a bitch and sometimes no matter how badly I wanted to get back to these boys, I just couldn't feel it. Thankfully I managed to climb out of the slump and finish this!
“I don't know.” Castiel shook his head. “One moment I was drinking my coffee and the next I was having a panic attack.”
"-And I know that it was the anniversary of Jack's death and all," Dean huffed, "but that-" Dean turned to look at Castiel, but Castiel turned away. He couldn't make himself meet Dean's gaze, "-why didn't you talk to me?"
*******
“You chose to fight back.”
"It's okay," Michael said. "I will never judge you for having reservations, but I can't help you if you don't tell me what's going on."
Milo sat and stared at him, displeasure evident in the tiny cats black and white face. Amused, Castiel chuckled and reached over to grab his cell off the nightstand, the now lit up screen revealing it was 12:34pm. The lock screen photo caught his eye and he couldn't help but smile. It was a photo of Dean and Sam in the backyard. He couldn't remember when the photo was taken and he frowned at the lack of memory, but what he did know was it had been far too long since Sam had been over. So long that he didn't even remember the last time he'd seen Sam. It was unfortunate that tonight would be the one to break the pattern.
Coffee!
"Good boy.” Michael squeezed his tip to coax even more come out of his spent cock. “You did so good."
“If it hasn’t already.” Castiel supplied.
"Well, hello there," the man, who he assumed was Impala_67, drawled. He stood with one arm propped up against the half-open door as he looked Castiel up and down.
Dean was aware of people watching him. It made the hairs on the back of his neck rise. He didn’t like being the center of attention like this, even if he understood, under the circumstances. He was probably the first new face in weeks if not months. Of course they were curious.
It was only then that Cas realized how close they were to each other, and how few clothes they each wore. That knowledge became more acute as he struggled to sit up and Dean reached an arm around him to offer assistance.
Castiel reviewed the list, then headed off to start with his purchases. He’d put off doing the shopping until after Dean arrived, mostly because he didn’t see a need to be storing the items himself. Security wouldn’t have been a problem; a simple spell protected his belongings from would-be thieves.
Dean chuckled. “Always the fierce little hawk.”
Dean made a face.
It would appear Balthazar was just as scant with the information he gave to Dean as he was with what he sent to Castiel. “Gabriel, yes. He and his Familiar Charlie are the other pair we will be working with.”
“Surprisingly, yes.” Cas strode off in the direction Dean had been pointing.
The copper tang of blood hung heavy in the air.
Gabe turned and threw the mug of tea into the back of the fireplace, where it shattered. The liquid immediately evaporated when it hit the embers.
He could worry about her surprising strength once they were away from here. The sheer power it took to override his blood bond with Dean was terrifying -- but he couldn't afford to devote any energy to worrying about that now. Time enough for that later, when they were safely away. He continued pulling Dean, angling to break her line of sight. They were two steps from being out of sight when a loud roar to his immediate right startled him.
“I never asked, specifically, but I don’t believe either Nora or Charlie tracked that way.” Cas felt the usual melancholy when he thought of Nora. “Nora would fly overhead and look for areas of dead or sickly vegetation. You would have to ask Charlie but she likely does what you do, only on a more instinctual level.”
Witch — was pure enchantment. He was getting as sappy as Sam inside his own mind, and he didn’t even care. Having Cas was everything.
“Cas! Cas. Hey. Take it easy. I’ve got ya.”
“Yes, ma’am.”
Not long. Not long, and Dean could shift, really stretch his legs out. He kept looking out towards the west, not concentrating on the actual here and now. “You have everything in hand, Cas?” he asked, glancing towards the Witch. Castiel worked with dexterity and competence, clearly well familiar with the routine.
“Be right there!” Charlie called as well, sounding far more cheerful. She bounded down the stairs, coming over to wrap her arms around Cas in a hug. “You’re the best.”
He didn’t jump back quickly enough. He twisted just enough that claws raked across his ribs rather than gouging into the soft flesh of his stomach. A second swipe as he fell backwards caught his thigh. Pain seared through him. He fought to stay aware, but the charm meant to stave off corruption relied on his own life force. Dean’s answering roar was the last thing he heard before he dropped into unconsciousness.
Cas plated for the two of them, and called upstairs. “Breakfast is ready! If you want it warm, come down.”
By the time the four of them entered the Saloon, most of the rest of the residents of Willow River had already gathered.
Dean looked around. “I like the flowers. Your work?”
“Dean. Did you expect I would learn you left and simply let you go on your own?” His tone was sharper than intended, influenced by his own worry for the Familiar. Dean didn’t take offense, though. Their bond allowed him to feel that it was worry driving the words instead of true anger.
“Don’t you know it.”
The first attack came just as Cas finished scribing the last sigil on the door of the homestead. It was a coyote this time, lean and emaciated, throwing itself against the wards as the black veins crawled over its ribs. Dean shuddered. “I hate that this is happening to them,” he said. “I want this over. This has to stop.”
Cas nodded. “I have since come to learn that is the more commonly accepted method. However, that is not the way things were done in our household.”
Dean lowered himself, slotting between Cas’ legs. Having Cas warm and alive under his fingertips was going a long way towards muting the memory of the Witch falling, bloody and unconscious.
He was, quite simply, stunning.
Dean sensed what Cas intended a moment before Cas tensed his muscles and rolled the two of them over.  Dean relaxed into it, not fighting as Cas rearranged them until he was now above. It was Dean’s turn to arch into the touch as Cas let go his hips and deftly flicked open the buttons of Dean’s pants.
-oOo-
“Yes, right. Of course.” Something they should have thought of before heading out, actually. But this was a new situation to navigate for them both. Castiel hitched Smoky to a nearby branch and moved enough away to find a clear bit of ground. He pulled a knife out of his belt and pushed his sleeve up enough to expose his wrist. Dean did the same.
He pushed his hat up and wiped his sleeve across his forehead, leaning back against the logs. A pair of scouts walked past — Roy and Walt Ellington, he identified them. He’d been here long enough that he knew most everyone by name, even the scouts who weren’t around much. “Afternoon,” he greeted them.
Charlie flicked an acorn at him. “You know he wouldn’t trigger them.”
After a moment’s silence, Bobby cleared his throat and started speaking. “All right then. Tell us everything you remember about the place you found her, and that encounter,” he directed. “And get yourselves something to drink. This is going to take some time.”
Dean opened the door firmly. He was the perfect candidate for this Witch. Whoever he was. Or she.
The clearing was empty. “No. No, no, no, no, no.” Dean carefully set Cas down and took a look around. The horse was long gone, the broken hobble and a few scattered supplies the only evidence this was the correct spot. He must have gotten spooked by something and took off. He gripped his hair and let out one more shouted “No!”
Dean shuddered. This was it. This was the gamble they took. He lowered his head.
Dean moved around, looking at things, reaching for items but stopping before he actually picked them up. “Thought you invited me up here to get drunk and forget about that nightmare for a little while. Not start strategizing against it.”
Cas watched Dean and Gabe bicker while Dean adeptly shifted the pronghorn around to expose the belly, popping out a single sharp claw and using it to slice open the carcass. “So you’re saying you use your magic skills to lord it over the others.”
“No. It isn’t. He seems to be settling in well enough, but I agree with your assessment. I believe he’ll be happy to explore and gain more familiarity with the area.”
“Come on. I’ll show you.” Gabe led them the rest of the way to the pink and white house – which definitely stood out amongst all of the others, which were mostly either natural wood or white-washed with a limestone mix. They went inside the house. It was rectangular, with a steep narrow staircase on one side leading up to the second floor. Magical energies hummed pleasant and welcoming beneath his feet, tasting strongly of wildflowers with a fainter notes of more cultivated roses — hints of Cas’ previous Familiar woven through the house.
Dean ran his hand through his hair. “So what exactly is it that you’ve been doing out here? Your cousin wasn’t really all that specific.”
It might almost be beautiful, if Dean were capable of looking at the scene without the overlay of corruption. There were areas of healthier ground where the trees grew tall and lush, creating islands of emerald green dotted along the cracked black and gray rock. Some grasses clung to the ground, spiraled out from the tree lines.
“It’s to our benefit now that they did not listen,” Cas responded.
“A crude method of communication that Gabriel and I developed some time ago,” Cas replied. “Gabriel holds a matching set. Each stone is paired with one of Gabe’s.”
Guilt and worry poured through the bond before Dean was able to clamp down on it. Cas looked up sharply, his own worry pushed through to the forefront.
When the meeting devolved into repetitions of previous arguments with nothing new being added, Dean slipped out of the saloon and headed home, stepping into his room and closing the door behind himself. He opened the shutter of the witchlight lantern Cas had given him, bathing the room in a soft light.
It wasn’t long at all before Cas joined him on foot, stopping by his side, lightly placing a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “Where is this smell coming from?”
Dean answered.
The difference between the east bank and the west bank of the river was startling. This was not just death, but an open seeping wound. Dean tightened his grip on Cas and took in a careful breath. It took every bit of strength in him not to fall ill.
Cas shot him a look. “In case you hadn’t noticed, there’s not a lot of need for distinguishing one saloon from another.”
Dean’s spirits soared as he moved through the grasslands past the river. After yesterday’s storm everything felt fresh and clean. The ground was springy rather than hard, the scent of grass pleasant. Here and there he caught a flicker of movement from various prey. Being bonded with Cas meant that those flickers weren’t as distracting as when he was solo. That was different. On the whole, he found that he retained far more of his human intellect now, while losing none of the abilities of his shifted form. If anything those abilities were sharper. He could more easily sift through the various scents, his vision could focus farther and more sharply, he could hear better, and both his speed and endurance were enhanced.
Why wasn't Cas awake yet? He should be awake by now. Maybe it was too much, too soon. He'd nearly exhausted his magical reserves in healing Bobby, and then pursued Dean long before he'd replenished himself. Dean swallowed hard against a surge of guilt. He should have stayed back in Willow River, rather than storming off after the bear. He should have realized Cas would never let him go alone. This was all his fault. If Cas didn't wake up soon... or ever?
“New thing we learned this morning. Not even Ellen can stop Dean when he has his mind set on something. Donna is saddling Smoky for you, and Ellen is getting together some provisions for the road. We’re hoping you have better luck in turning him right back around, but preparing for the worst just in case.”
“Doesn’t really matter.” Gabe waved a hand dismissively, sniffing at the same time.
“So you’re a Campbell through the maternal line.”
Cas moved over to Gabe, giving his brother a brief hug and pat on the shoulders. “Has anything of note happened while I was gone?”
“Now Castiel,” Garth said as he began to fold the blanket up. “I know you’re tired and all, and I wouldn’t be bothering you after such an intensive healing. Some voted not to bother you. Ellen put her foot down and pointed out you would be even more of a grumpy gus if when you finally woke up you found no one had told you.”
The description he had received of Dean Winchester was frustratingly brief. Mid-twenties, fit, shifter form suitable for frontier work. It was barely more information than that yes, he meets criteria stated in the ‘Wanted’ advertisement. The length of time it took correspondence to make a round trip, however, would mean that the Familiar himself would arrive before Balthazar’s reply to a demand for more information. He suspected his cousin believed himself to be amusing with the brevity of information provided. Though he did not expect a reply in a timely manner, he spent a good hour of his time here at the settlement penning a response that was in turns grateful for conducting the interviewing and scathing for the dearth of detail in the report of hire.
“This is about being happy to be alive,” Cas agreed. He met Dean’s gaze steadily. “It is also about letting go of fear. Dean Winchester, you deserve to know how much you have come to mean to me. It is selfish to keep that from you on the chance I am not quite as important to you.”
“I have those dime novels for you, Bobby.” Cas told him. “I did not want to leave them in with the other supplies where they might get ripped or damaged in other ways. I couldn’t find any of the Doc Everston series but did find a tidy supply of Dangerous Desperados…” he finally trailed off when he caught that Bobby was trying to shush him.
“So. Everyone… I’d like you to meet Sam Winchester. My brother. Sam, this is… everyone.”
“And he can speak for himself,” Dean pointed out. “Yeah. I’ll admit that wasn’t necessarily my smartest move. But… I really would like to clean up before we talk.”
“Samuel is a frequent name in the Campbell history. It’s complicated. I know that much. She’s never really explained all of her reasoning. Their reasoning, because obviously my father went along with it. Where did Castiel come from? Never heard that one anywhere else.”
“Guess this is it, then. Love you.” Dean curled his hand around the back of Cas’ neck and squeezed, then wrapped his arms around him in a fierce embrace.
Cas nodded solemnly. “We will want to make sure to keep Dean’s personal belongings separate from the community supplies,” Cas murmured almost more to himself than to Garth. “It wouldn’t do to distribute his items about the settlement.” He dove into the bags to start separating by final destination. “We repacked the bags for optimal weight distribution for the horses rather than out of concern for what went where.”
“Nor do I. It seemed newer,” Cas said. “Not well established. I might have preferred established. That could just mean we’d missed it, not that the land was re-infected. Do we need to start backtracking with patrols?”
“Sir,” Winchester said, bobbing his chin briefly in polite greeting. His voice was rough, dry from the travel, but still sent shivers down Castiel’s spine. “Dean Winchester,” he introduced himself.
“Sure did.” Dean walked over to start making himself some tea. He wasn’t usually one for tea, but it had started to grow on him. The tea set was all delicate bone china that didn’t really seem to fit any of the residents of the house, white decorated with painted pink roses and delicate green leaves. The teapot sat on a crocheted white doily, remarkably clean given the general dustiness that seemed to surround Willow River. Clearly both the tea set and the doily were well-cared-for.
Traveling was slower than the day before as they wound around trees and up and down hills. By evening, they still had not reached the corrupted land that Dean could still sense to the southwest. The longer they went without reaching the source, the more concerned Dean grew. How strong was it, that he could sense it so far away?
“The bluebirds singing were cute,” Charlie mused. “Though I heard that the time a skunk sat back and blinked bashfully at him nearly gave him apoplexy.”
Dean picked up his and Bobby’s drinks at the bar, giving Ellen his best charming smile. “Thank you, ma’am.”
“I like it. It’s simple, but beautiful.”
“Agreed.” Cas rubbed his thumb lightly in the small of Dean’s back, the urge to comfort nearly overwhelming. He didn’t like the pale, drawn look of Dean’s expression. He felt terrible for placing it there. He knew this was important. Objectively, he knew that Dean needed to understand what they were up against. Even so, he didn’t have to like it. “Dean.” He stroked his palm up Dean’s spine. “I... I am sorry, for doing this to you.”
She opened the connection between them wide and unfettered, prepared to pull the greatest amount of magic possible from him. He could taste the ozone taint of her power, twisted and dark. It was terrifying.
The stubborn part of Dean didn’t want to leave. What did he really gain, though, what did he really prove by standing here for longer?
“Most of the buildings, too. It was mostly a collection of sod houses when I got here. They worked well enough for what they were, but there’s more trees around here than flat grassland. Made more sense to start going wood.”
The closer they got, the more on edge Dean felt.
“At least for the visit I promised, yeah.” Dean reached up and cupped Cas’ cheek in his palm. “Cas. You and I are a mated pair bond now. There is nothing that can come between us, nothing that can tear us apart. I do want to show you off to my parents, to Sam and Jess. I’ve been writing about you. They know you’re a good person, and that I am fortunate to be with you. If you’re not comfortable going to New Avalon, though… we’ll figure something out. Maybe we can meet them somewhere else, travel back east but not all the way.”
Dean flashed him a smile, stepping out from behind Cas’ shoulder. “Hey, Gabe. Good to see you.”
Dean hissed and snarled, but then collected his pack from Cas in his teeth before disappearing into a slight hollow and Shifting back to human form.
“That does not sound like a no,” Cas pointed out. “It would be a challenge. I thought you enjoyed challenges.”
The wind shifted, bringing with it a new and different scent. Dean lifted his nose, flaring his nostrils. This smell was like nothing he’d ever encountered before. It had a sour tang to it, a sharpness that made him growl involuntarily, his tail twitching.
“Sort of like we have out here,” Gabe mused out loud. “Imagine that.”
“We’ve no immediate plans to wade into the middle of it. No longer range plans to do so, either,” Cas assured him. “Let’s collect Gabe and Charlie and move away from here.”
Cas stilled. He set his finger in place in the book he was reading and mostly closed it. “I believe it originally belonged to Nora’s mother.”
“So you don’t know how to cook either?” he asked Gabe, his voice rougher than it had been a moment ago.
“Ta-da. The lean-to.” Gabe swept aside the burlap curtain to reveal a small room with a sharply angled roof on the other side. There was a low bed frame taking up most of the space. “Didn’t have time to do much to make it look homey, but it’s all yours. Private and everything. If you want a window we can add that later. Figured it was easier to put a window in than take it out if you didn’t want it.”
“I’ll shift, it won’t affect me the same. It will be better for our bond anyhow. You’re going to need all the help you can get.”
She bumped her shoulder against his and beamed up at him. “Awww, you’re too sweet.”
He and Castiel each took one of the two trunks. Winchester handled his with great ease. Castiel found the other heavy, but manageable. The trip to Rockville followed by a few days of rest while waiting for the stagecoach meant he had been able replenish his magical energy to near full. He used just a trickle of that magic to be able to carry his trunk as effortlessly as Winchester managed the other, ignoring the small voice in his head that asked why he felt it was necessary to try and impress the other man with his physical prowess.
Cas reached down to play with Dean’s hair. He loved touching him like this, lightly scratching Dean’s skull, rubbing behind his ears, just being together. It seemed that Dean liked this sort of touch just as much in his human form as he did as a cougar. “No. I’m not. I am, however, content to rely on the strength of our protections for the time being and relax.”
He looked up and held Cas’ gaze for a long moment, then nodded and stepped out.
“Not going to count on it, though, are you.”
Dean didn’t add any more beyond that.
“Actual fresh flowers?” Dean asked.
“I should hope so,” Cas replied. Dean could feel the vibration of his voice against his lips. He smiled again, snaking his hand around his mate’s waist, scratching lightly at the hair just below his navel. Cas’ sleep pants rode low on his hips. Dean slid his hand a little lower to play with the ties at his waistband.
“Frankly, the thought of being out in the wilds is exciting. And I don’t mind a rough lifestyle. My family has taken long hunting trips to the northern mountains a couple times a year. That life suits me far better than the city.”
“Charlie, you’re not supposed to tell him that. Where’s the fun in that?” Gabe pouted.
“You expecting an entire army to come down on us?” Dean asked, as he stoked the fire.
“Oh? You can take care of yourself better than Rufus and Bobby?”
“I have been through all of the traditional Familiar training, Cas. That includes temporary bonding. I worked with my dad on a few cases, then Sammy and I worked together all the time before he pair-bonded with Jess. Don’t worry about me, I can handle whatever you want to throw at me.”
Finally, Cas sank back down to the makeshift bedding, never breaking eye contact.
Gabe couldn’t keep quiet at that one. “Holy fuck, are you serious?”
The interior of the saloon was comfortable, if rustic. The tables were solid and square, the bar tucked into a corner had shelves behind it with a small selection of alcoholic beverages on display. Dean followed Cas back to the bar, looking around with curiosity. The bottles weren’t labeled as nicely as they were back in New Avalon. Some weren’t labeled at all, the only distinguishing factors being the color of the liquid inside. There were a couple barrels on stands, with taps inserted.
“Plan for up to a week on the trail?”
Cas nodded, managed a weak smile in return. “Yes. I ‘got this’.” He tugged his blanket more securely around himself, then strode off towards the pink and white striped house at the end of the pathway.
“Willow River. Coincidentally, the settlement is located on the banks of a river that has many willow trees.”
Dean blinked. He still wasn’t entirely accustomed to everyone always knowing everything about what was going on. “Yes, ma’am,” he answered. “It’s a very nice door, too. I should be all set for now.”
“So now you know why I’m interested in this contract. What more can you tell me about the Witch I’d be partnering with?” Dean wasn’t entirely comfortable dealing with an Angelus lawyer. There were risks that he was representing himself dishonestly. Sam had warned him to be careful, that maybe this was some scheme to nab Dean and make him disappear under the guise of sending him to the frontier.
Dean rolled his shoulders. “Probably not, but let’s do this anyhow. Lead the way.” He glanced at Charlie and thought about how the touch of his Witch was a very good idea right now. He followed through on that idea by reaching out to clasp his hand with Cas’.
Dean shrugged. “Doesn’t matter.”
“Yes. Even I can feel it pressing against me.” He reached to loosen Dean’s satchel from the saddle ring, and held it down for him. “Here you go. Don’t go far. In fact, we can simply turn our backs to you, and you can shift right here.”
“What am I supposed to do with this?” Gabe asked, leaning slightly away from the dead animal and making a face. “Moving out to the frontier doesn’t mean I in any way agreed to learn how to dress an animal. Go take that… thing away.”
“Ah. That is our status board. We keep tabs on who is out on patrol, the direction they intended to go, and when they left. There’s also a rotation for the next up.”
“Hey. Here, I bet you want something to drink.” He held a flask to Dean’s mouth, gently supporting his head, raising it enough to pour some blessedly cool water into his mouth. The water had a metallic tang to it from the flask, some mineral aftertaste, and was the best thing he’d ever drank.
All four of them were more somber as they continued to head towards the river.
-oOo-
“Makes sense. Did it feel like you can work together well?” Charlie had been Gabe’s partner for going on three years now. They’d gotten together before making the decision to come to the frontier, forming the permanent bond after a mere six months. They worked very well together, complementing each other, their thought processes surprisingly similar.
