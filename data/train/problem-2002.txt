Squeezing his hand in affirmation before sliding away, I move outside to entertain myself with some emailed cases.
“That’s it,” John snaps, hooking his hands under Sherlock’s armpits. “We’re going. No more case for you.”
“Yeah. Yeah, I’m alright. It’s always just... a bit raw afterwards.”
With a nod, I busy myself by grabbing a wet flannel to wipe Little Watson’s face and hands. John frees her from the seat and holds her on his hip, smiling as he watches me. As I clean off the mushed peas, John holding her squirming form, he reaches up and places a quick peck to my cheek with a soft “Thank you.”
Sherlock nods, his jaw clenching, the muscles working as he scratches at the side of his neck. “Fifteen minutes, John.” His eyes dart to John’s face and away again. “Just… just wait fifteen minutes.” A tight little smile twitches along his lips, and he adds, “Give or take.”
He hands me one of the tumblers and takes a sip from his own. Sliding past me, Sherlock folds into his leather chair with ease. Knees crossed, an elbow propped against the armrest with a relaxed wrist, he swirls his drink.
, did they?”
They were seated, floating through deep, dark space, the only light coming from Sherlock’s gaze, the heat of where they were still touching.
As he leans back in his seat, fingertips pressed together and resting against his lower lip, Sherlock responds, “I have those three as well. Tell me, do they play out exactly as the events occur as you experienced them? Or are they altered in some way?”
It takes almost half an hour to go over every single scar and mark I have been given, and those are only the ones on my back. The gunshot wound on my chest is for another time, another conversation. John already knows of that one.
Now it was Sherlock’s turn to glance over her head to John before continuing, a look of helplessness in his eyes. “Well. Just like this, I suppose. I always do better when I can immediately be surrounded by my loved ones, especially in a cuddle like this.” He emphasizes the sentiment with a squeeze. “It also helps to be reminded of what is real. For example, in my nightmares, I lose you, your daddy, or the both of you, so being reminded that you are still here with me helps to ground me in reality, takes away the fear of the nightmares.” Pausing, Sherlock presses another kiss to the top of her head and squeezes the cuddle tighter. “This is why your daddy and I told you that we would listen to you. That we are here to protect you the best we can.”
“Alright?” he mutters, lips still pressed to my head.
When Sherlock wakes, he blinks his eyes open, finds John watching him, and flushes bright red. John watches him back, his expression cautious. Sherlock shifts and hesitantly pulls the pillow closer, cheek rubbing into the soft fabric of John’s jumper.
I hear his teeth click together as I continue on. “You… I… You made me watch, Sherlock.” My voice breaks, the tears once again threatening to fall. “You made me watch, and there was nothing I could do. I lost… everything that day. What was life worth without you in it?”
thinking of my brother.” A harsh gagging sound follows, and Greg winces.
After so many small glimpses and mistaken identities, John isn’t expecting the dark curls to be anything more than a small stab of days long past. What he really doesn’t expect is for those dark curls to move directly to his tucked-away table in the small cafe. When the long legs covered in a navy blue suit stand in front of him, shifting from side to side, John looks up and meets the pale blue eyes he thought he would never see again.
Ever so lightly, Sherlock brushes his dry, smooth lips with mine. Tilting my head as I pull him in a little deeper, feeling the fullness of his mouth meld with mine, a small inhale of surprise escapes him. His hands frame my face, fingertips pressing into my hair.
“Do you have others?”
“John,” Sherlock said through his sleep-grogged voice. The world dropped away from them, those eyes locked on his. They were no longer in a cab at night in front of their flat. There was no cabbie, no fare to be paid. There were no sounds of traffic or distant sirens. There were no streetlights casting an orange-yellow hue.
“Oi, watch it,” John warns with another stern point of his finger. “Do you
“We are not young men anymore,” John puffs, winded. Sherlock growls and swats at his hip.
“Unless there is a mutual agreement for me to do so,” Sherlock adds after a moment of thought. John throws his hands into the air and growls his frustration before moving six feet away from the body, making way for the forensics team to step in.
“Undoubtedly.” There is no flicker of a lie in his face, pure truth.
The span between us teeters on an edge, waiting to be broken or renewed. Keeping my face void of emotion, and making sure my voice stays strong, I ask my next question, soft and quiet. “What changed?”
“I… wait… what?” He taps on the door, and Mrs. Hudson shouts at him from the other side.
“Sherlock! Stop dumping that out the window—there are people out there!”
. Something important.
he charges you for assault of a police officer. Now get out of here. I don’t wanna see either one of you for at least a week.”
Sherlock scoffs at him and attempts to find his footing, but the floor is unexpectedly slippery, and he nearly loses his legs from beneath him again. Snorting, John rolls his eyes.
Tired and not ready to have a deep, drawn-out conversation about why I had to be with Mary because the one I love would never love me back, I mutter, “I can't explain any better than that right now, Sherlock. Maybe later. But I should go back to bed.” I look towards the doorway, to the stairs, but I can't move. I stand there and just...
Heat radiates against my side as Sherlock comes to stand by me. “John, I…” he sighs. “The letter.”
“Yes. But that won’t stop me from experiencing them.” The truth slips from me in my distraction. John turns to look at me then, searching my eyes in the dark, and settles on a response.
I dive out of my seat and catch him before he hits the ground, pulling him half into my lap, our legs tangled and askew.
Downstairs, she opens the door and steps back, waving him inside. “In you go, young man,” she orders, and John shoots her another look as he complies.
Over the rim of her glasses, she turns a pointed look to John. “Oh, did he now? He never mentioned that. Nor the fact you suffer from nightmares as well.”
My heart clenches, surrounded by a vice. I must have hidden how much I… care for him better than I had thought.
Sherlock meandered through the familiar space of his parents' house, hoping to find his way to the safe nook that protected him from most of the fray. A hand landed on his shoulder and paused his steps. John. Sliding his eyes closed, Sherlock let the small bit of warmth bleed through his suit and into his skin.
“Sweep the stairs,” John says to him one morning, shoving a broom into Sherlock’s hand where he stands at the top of the landing.
John narrows his eyes. “...I mean… I guess?” He shakes his head. “Whatever, you berk, just kiss me.” He lifts his head, finds Sherlock’s lips and kisses him with burning focus. His tongue skates long the seam of Sherlock’s mouth, licking inside before John grimaces and breaks the kiss. “Why do you taste like cigarettes?”
In his solitude, he plots. Isolation ends in two days, and Sherlock calls Angelo. He makes a reservation, swearing Angelo to silence until then and allowing the addition of a candle to their saved table. When John leaves to go to work on his final day of quarantine, Sherlock sneaks upstairs and rips apart several roses ordered online. After changing out his sheets, he spreads the petals over his bed and across the floor, his heart racing.
Is it too early to refer to it as our bedroom? What am I thinking, of course it is. This is just for tonight. But what if it’s not? What if it is more than one night? No, no, no. Stop. I can’t think that way. I can’t let my hope run amok. It won’t do.
A half-smirk curls the corner of my mouth, and I press my forehead to his, eyes closed, and slip my hand around the nape of his neck, twining my fingers into his hair. “Always.”
Mouth quirking up at the corners, John tugs Sherlock down again, kissing him with intent and gentle lips. Sherlock’s arms slip around his shoulders, and he melts into John’s chest. When John pulls back to speak again, his voice is stern, “But no more sticking your fingers in dead peoples’ mouths.”
Before he can question his actions, John digs out the long pillow he used after his injury to keep pressure off his healing shoulder. It reminds him of those ‘boyfriend pillows’ he saw in a Facebook ad once, and he tries not to dwell on the connotation of such a term. Shaking the thoughts away, John stuffs the pillow into one of his jumpers, strides into the sitting room, and tosses it at Sherlock. He doesn’t wait to see or hear the response, instead trotting back up to his bedroom. It is an obvious tactical retreat, and John perches on the edge of his bed with tightly-clenched fists.
Sherlock’s brain whirled through what had happened, John’s face telling a story he didn’t understand.
I tuck my hands into my coat pockets and lead the way through the main door. Once we are in a cab, John ventures to ask, “So, you seemed pretty open in there, which I assume means you’re pretty comfortable with her, yeah? I… I didn’t think you would be, which is why I’ve never asked this before. But, are you interested in seeing her for yourself? I mean, you’ve got a lot to process too.”
Am I amenable? No.
As we walk hand in hand to our room, I doubt there will be any nightmares tonight.
Sherlock frowns, pondering the implications of the command. “What if
“On Monday, you did that thing with your tongue, and I couldn’t get off the floor for three solid hours because my legs turned into the consistency of a Wendy’s frosty. And Tuesday, it was over the chair, and then it was more like…” he pauses, considering the chart of John’s suggested comparisons, and concludes, “Jello.”
Nancy glances up from the notebook on her lap and smirks at the scene we must make. She readjusts her glasses, pushes an errant, sleek, black strand back into place, and sets the book to the side.
As I gaze at him trying to determine what I had been hearing but glad he's finally getting some rest, his head starts rocking back and forth. A repeated “No” escapes his contorted expression, each repetition louder than the last.
“Your daddy is right you know,” Sherlock says in a soft, low voice, “we both love you so much." He leans down and presses a kiss into her soft curls. "I made a vow a long time ago to protect you, and I am not about to give that up now.” After a few minutes wrapped in her fathers’ arms, Rosie's crying turns into sniffling, her breathing relaxing back into a normal pattern.
John sighs again. “Just
The light changes by the time his slender fingers wrap around my wrist, urging me to stop. We sit there, still, holding each other. After another few minutes, I look down at him, and Sherlock smiles. A small, hesitant smile, but a smile nonetheless.
By the end of the day, sticky hands mark the flat. When Mrs. Hudson comes upstairs to leave a plate of biscuits, she pauses in the doorway. Eyes narrowed, she takes in the sight of John sitting on the sofa with Sherlock curled into a petulant ball in his chair, and sticky hands of various neon colours clinging to the walls, ceiling, floor, and Sherlock’s hair.
After opening the door and entering the tiny unrented bachelor flat, John narrows his eyes at a lump of blankets in the corner. Sherlock’s unruly curls peek out from the top, the rest of him hidden in the makeshift nest.
John takes this as the strange, macabre compliment that it is, and strokes Sherlock’s hip between thrusts until he comes with a sob.
As they move down the hall to the elevator, John catches Sherlock’s smirking at him. The posh git must know what he’s thinking.
He settles on the sofa and picks up his newspaper again, trying to ignore the way his hands shake.
“I’m worried about him,” she says, a pensive little frown between her eyes. “He doesn’t do well on his own.”
“Hold that thought, yeah?” I say as I stand to rescue Rosie from the crib. He closes his eyes and lays his head back as it was before.
“Open it.” Sherlock’s voice is flat, calm.
Growling, Sherlock bangs on the door. To their surprise, it opens without resistance. Sherlock shoots John a look, who just shrugs. They leave the room and hurry upstairs. Back in 221B, Sherlock whirls and tries to back John against the wall. John fends him off with ease.
John’s voice follows him, the man himself leaning over the banister to call,” Yeah, two
A faint flush in his cheeks, John clears his throat. “Ah, yeah. Yeah, we have.”
John stared, searching those blue eyes that stared right back.
After the session is over, John comes out, his eyes showing a hint of puffiness.
“It was real for
Maybe this wouldn’t be so bad after all.
Strong hands grab his face and stop him from moving. Sherlock’s mouth presses back against his, the full lips now wet and salty against his own. John kisses back, letting his hands find purchase in Sherlock’s curls, before using them to pull Sherlock back to look at his face.
Eyes wide, Sherlock goggles at him, asking, “Wait, you know what a buttplug is?”
With every step further into the flat, Sherlock leans more heavily on John, the exhaustion starting to take its toll. Placing him into one of the kitchen chairs, John steps back and scans Sherlock’s face, his body, as he begins to slump over the table with stiff, slow movements.
With a sharp nod of understanding, I ask, “Is there anything else? I don’t wish to take up John’s time.”
Finally, John says, “Do you know why I grieved for you for two years, Sherlock?” When there is no response, he continues, “People don’t do that for their best friend. They just don’t.”
…” he says, pointing at Lestrade, “should fire
“John,” the dead man says in the deep resonance John swears he forgot.
Raising his eyes to look once again at Sherlock, the man that should be six feet under right at this very moment, John finds a hint of sadness in the edges of his eyes.
“Hey Sherlock, breathe for me. In and out. In and out. See? That’s better isn’t it?” My breathing is almost normal, my heart rate slowing again, and John smiles weakly at me. He sits on the edge of my bed facing me, watching intently, searching for answers. His warm, solid presence further soothes my racing heart.
“As always, John,” Sherlock sniffs, sounding cold and harsh, “you see, but you do not observe.”
Turning toward the sitting room, I catch Sherlock facing away from me, dark curls aglow in the firelight, body straight, strong, and graceful. I pause to take it in, remembering what it was like for him to teach me to dance. The feel of his back beneath my palm.
It’s perfect.
John hadn’t ever been to a party quite like a Holmes’ party. Gorgeous outfits, petit fours offered on trays, flutes of champagne, people talking business and children and small talk. The atmosphere was light and happy.
“How long until your quarantine ends?” he asks, his voice carefully empty of emotion. John clears his throat and glances at the device, wetting his lips before answering.
The ritual of making tea calms me. Kettle, two mugs, two bags, milk for me, sugar for him, steep the bags, stir the tea. It allows me the time to figure out what the hell I'm going to say.
Amused, John cocks his head at Sherlock’s shouted demand. “You mean the dustpan?”
It’s my fault he now knows and blames himself. I scramble to find something to say to remedy the situation.
“Speak for yourself, Captain Grey Hair!”
John's face darkens, brow knitting together. “What? Of course. Of course, I am.” As he steps closer to the kitchen, his face softens. “I’d honestly love to have you there, but again. Only if you are agreeable.”
Perhaps it hadn’t been pretend after all.
It takes him a few seconds before he can respond. When he does, Sherlock's voice is flat, almost pinched with worry, shame, concern. The voice that he uses when he tries to remain completely in control, devoid of emotion.
Sherlock lasts two days in the downstairs flat by himself before Mrs. Hudson corners John with her concerns.
“Quite right.” Nancy smiles in agreement. “Our stories are our own.” Fixing her gaze back on me, she asks, “Out of interest, you have no obligation to answer, what are your nightmares about, Sherlock?”
“What is
The threat is clear, and John shakes his head. “Alright, alright, you drama queen. Come here, let me help you.” Gripping Sherlock’s sleeves, John tows him over the floor, bare feet gripping the slick surface with ease. Sherlock huffs and snarls at him until John tilts his head forward and whispers, “You’ll be fine.” His voice drops into a low, throaty purr that makes Sherlock shiver as John says, “We both know I’ll be doing all the work anyway. As if you’d ever need to lift a finger.” Sherlock shivers again, his pupils blown wide, eyes turning glazed and hazy. He looks about a second from drooling before John adds, “You know—since you’re such a
Sputtering over his coffee, John responded, “Yeah. Of course I do.” He expected Sherlock to look up. It didn’t happen. With the tilt of his head, John set his mug down, rather forcefully, on the table. “Sherlock,” he said, crossing his arms. When he still didn’t receive the man’s attention, he asked, “What are you on about?”
“That’s partly why I’m here, isn’t it? To wake you from them?” The question, spoken quiet and low, rings with a hint of confusion.
“I’ll just bloody carry you, shall I?” Without waiting for a response, he steps forward to sweep Sherlock into his arms. But the angle is off, and Sherlock is heavier than he looks, and they both go sprawling in a heap. Sherlock winces and huffs as his elbow and knee strike the floor, John’s shoulder making the ex-soldier groan when it connects with the wall.
He seems to be organizing his mind palace, so I make us tea. Kettle, two mugs, two bags, milk for me, sugar for him, steep the bags, stir the tea. I place his mug on the table near the sofa and settle into my own chair. Picking up my current book, I flip through the pages to find my spot and begin to read while sipping at my drink. About fifteen minutes later, Sherlock speaks without having moved at all.
The rest of the trip is rife with tense, awkward silence, and it creeps into my spine, my shoulders, my jaw—my goddamn scalp feels tight. When we finally make it back to the flat, I head straight to the kitchen and begin doling up food, not bothering to take off my shoes or coat. Sherlock lingers by the entryway, peeling off his gloves, his Belfast, undoing the laces on his shoes one bloody pull at a time. Bloody sod. Avoiding me.
Knowing the reason for all this doesn't change shit. He still killed himself in front of me, he still left and let me break apart, I still lost the love of my life. Now I don't even know where to aim my anger and I'm afraid it will soon rip me apart.
Sherlock lets out a deep sigh the moment John's arm curls around his chest again, and his closed-mouthed moan seeps into John's skin, warming him.

John comes home from her flat, and is surprised every time at how easy it is to breathe in 221B. Everything is effortless, even the arguments about inappropriate experiments; it only makes him feel safe, relaxing some part of him that he didn't know was tense. And Sherlock looks like home. He looks like something John wants to bury into and just
John eats under Sherlock's continued gaze. Weirdly, that doesn't make him self-conscious – he's used to Sherlock scrutinising him when he's doing the most boring and insignificant things, and God only knows what about John Sherlock could possibly find interesting. It doesn't really matter; John trusts that whatever Sherlock finds out by observing him, he will keep the data safe. It makes John feel calm. It makes him want to never be anywhere but under the headlights of Sherlock's eyes.
He’s not entirely certain what it is he’s doing, but he can feel it in his almost defiant posture; everything about him demands to be looked at. And oh, John

Moriarty, inexplicably, broke out in a slow smile. His wide, black eyes made it look manic. “Really?” he said, his voice surprised and amused and much too high. “You're turning down the magnificent supper I've arranged for you in the Gothic tower?”
How did you know about John F Kennedy?
At two a.m., John is soaring between wakefulness and sleep. A soft, warm pressure meets his lips, endlessly careful, and the wonderful scent of Sherlock's skin fills him. He lies still, distantly aware of Sherlock pulling back just as slowly. There is a whisper across his cheek: “I love you”, before sleep draws him in deeper.

We lie in comfortable silence for a few moments.
John smiles genuinely at Mike Stamford who is approaching our table with three other white-coated people. It quickly becomes obvious that they are all friends from university. I loathe university friends, and not only my own (although “friends” is a stretch in my case). In this type of group I always feel disgustingly small; once more the strange boy who is struggling to grow into his long limbs and sharp bone structure.

“Uninhabited? Then why on earth does it have its own time zone?”
Sherlock puts his hands in his hair, half-heartedly arranging it into something less obvious. He can do nothing about the colour on his cheeks, though. Everyone who sees him within the next fifteen minutes will know.
When they part for cooling air, the only point of contact is their little fingers.
“Finished the blog post, then?”
“I'm sorry”, I told Mary, “but there's someone I need to talk to.”
John sits on the edge of the bed. “Me too.” He turns around to smile at Sherlock. “It’s not so scary any more. It just feels right.”
“It will have to be a contrast between innocent and provocative – boyish hair, coy manners, and then the black suspender belt, the lace stockings, and the long negligee. A blushing bride”, he said ironically, then considered. “In black.”
Sitting on my narrow bed that day, I was certain that Sherlock could never love me. I was too plain, too ordinary, had too many ugly scars. I recalled him kissing the marred skin on my left shoulder, and I was humiliated to have bought the lie.
“No. We'd need to-”
A concurrent tightening of arms around rib cages.

Moriarty hummed absently. Sherlock walked slowly towards him, feet close together and hips swinging, but Moriarty turned away from him. He resumed his aimless stroll around the chamber, completely owning the silence that held both Sherlock and me trapped.

“Sherlock”, I whispered. He couldn't answer, fighting for breath. Horrible choking sounds emerged from his throat, wrapping the room in terror, making everyone halt.

Sherlock's silent breathing is fast against John's bare chest and John can't think straight. A large hand clutches John's hip, and it's almost torture, having his hand so close.

“Yes, yes, everyone is grateful and happy, aren't they. Boring.” His eyes lingered on a poster for a Sparkling Diamond show, featuring a beautiful drawing of Sherlock on his trapeze. “In return I want access to the Gothic tower every night.” He looked over Holmes' shoulder to the window. The grey stone castle stood across the courtyard, its high windows reflecting the clouded morning sky, keeping the interior secret. “And every night at eight”, Moriarty added, “your cherished little Virgin will be sent to me.”
I fail to see how that is any concern of yours.
You could say thanks, you know.
“You could have hidden sooner! This was an important encounter that I now have had to cut short because-”
When he finally came through the door to my flat, Sherlock had washed the evidence of his fever away. His hair was clean, stark red lipstick put a splash of colour on his white face, and thin black make-up lines around his eyes hid the exhaustion lingering there.
“Always.”
He was panting. Was he scared? god,w ha
When I finished cleaning, 221B was unrecognisable. But it was not enough. I went down the stairs and banged on Mrs Hudson's door until she opened it, curlers in place and pink dressing gown wrapped around her. I'd given her a fright, apparently, waking her in the middle of the night, but when I told her we have John’s baby all was forgiven. We spent the better part of an hour discussing life with a newborn and produced a list of necessary items. Now, annoyingly, I have to wait for the shops to open.
A man was sitting on a trapeze, a single spotlight making the smoke around him white and the silver in the air glisten. His long legs were artfully bent, his smooth skin white under the large squares of his black net stockings, disappearing into a pair of stilettos sharp as knives. He was dressed in a petite top that left his slim shoulders bare and revealed his navel and the artful curve of his lower back, and a pair of tiny shorts that left the whole length of his thighs exposed. The clothes were glistening as if they were made, not of fabric, but of a thousand jewels clinging to his skin. His face lay in shadow from the top hat on his head, only an earring sparkling underneath the brim. The curve of a blood-red mouth stood out against the black and silver of his image. The blue light made his pale skin glow like a diamond.
“Excuse me?” Holmes said, face revealing nothing.
Yeah, you're right. I know you're right. I need

“Yeah, well, you should have”, she says, turning her head without looking at him.

“Yes”, Sherlock mutters.
Stamford was standing by the far wall with hands folded behind his back, examining all the sheets of paper that I had pinned there since his last visit.

.” He smirked at this and barely paused for breath before he plunged on: “You have no money, no occupation, and barely any friends. You moved to Paris three – or closer to four weeks ago, in the hope that life would be less dull here than in London. Upon noticing that this is not the case, you have sought out the Moulin Rouge, borrowing or perhaps stealing a suit in order to pass as a wealthy man and be treated as such. However, the suit fits you poorly – it is too tight over the shoulders and too long in the sleeves. It's obvious that it isn't your own – in fact
Sherlock gives him a crazed smile, blood drenching half his face, and the residual fear twists John's stomach into anger. He stays quiet on their way home, setting his jaw, but Sherlock seems too dizzy to notice. John stays close behind him when they walk up the stairs to 221B.

“Do you know what day it is?”
When I came back to the dance hall, my eyes were still searching. They didn't rest until they found a head of perfect curls and a pale, sharp profile. Sherlock was sitting in one of the alcoves on the side with the script in his lap. He was reading it with a look of intense concentration, one slender hand absently stroking his bottom lip.
John looks down at his cosy oatmeal jumper. “This is my best jumper!”
Sherlock finally steps out onto the grass. “Let me see.”

“Then no one has ever deserved you.”
“Who are you trying to impress?”
Sherlock tries to stay at least somewhat impassive, too. But he has never known another hand than his own. It feels better than he thought it would, good enough to twist his face beyond his control, and to make him hastily pull his lips in between his teeth and bite them to keep from moaning.

The smug smile on her face is resentful, her arms are still crossed and she's leaning far back in her chair.
His face was monstrous, his voice still echoing without sound in the office. They stared at each other, Moriarty not even blinking, until Holmes finally spoke.

I frowned. “What point?”
“You knew what I was.”

Tori is totally out of his league, yet clearly interested.
He walks over to the sofa and slides his hands into Sherlock's hair. “Up”, he says, and Sherlock obeys without moving his arm from his eyes, pretending that he didn't just wake up. John sits down on the cushion and Sherlock's head stays comically lifted. He glances at John over the crook of his elbow, and John chuckles at his adorable confusion.
Sherlock jumps out of the living room sofa. This is pointless. He cannot find a way to navigate their current circumstances, and he cannot change the past. He needs to come up with something else entirely; something novel and fresh.
He seemed not to be aware of the way he said my name. His eyes were half-closed, his mouth slack.
“Don’t really care. I just want to get out of London. With you.”
His fingers inched down between the necklace and Sherlock's throat, making it even tighter. Sherlock could feel every single diamond dig into tender skin. His mouth opened, sucking in air through his closing windpipe. Involuntary tears formed in his eyes.
“It’s been decades. Since I was old enough to insist on staying in the city, I suppose. I rarely have the urge to spend time in the countryside.”

He can't say what it is about Sherlock's sleeping face that makes it impossible to look away.
Moriarty smiled. “Oh, I never cared about that. As you will soon know, it's not the fall that kills you – it's the landing.” The smile ran off his face frighteningly fast. “I will
(See the end of the chapter for
That's not what it was.
“Look up, I'm on the rooftop.”
I glanced at Stamford who sat behind the piano. The corner of his lip ticked up in encouragement.
“Look to your right.”
“The choreographer?”
“Your brother was concerned. He thought you might harbour some fantasies of escaping.” He pressed his lips together and shook his head in mock reproach. “Holmes might be hesitant to go to certain lengths to protect what's important. But he can recognise a man who doesn't have such scruples.”
It got worse when I arrived at the Moulin Rouge. It wasn't only the journalist that was visiting that day; Moriarty was there again. His hand rested on the small of Sherlock's back when I first spotted them.
And I did.
more confused than before. I guess that's my
Yes, I did have a lot of fun analysing chapter 22 of Undersea-Rainbows according to Sherlock's sexting classification. Which by the way is taken from a real website. Ah, the weird research we do for fics.
"Our memories make up who we are," said John looking at the image. He'd taken the picture at his parent's twentieth anniversary party. He remembered thinking how wonderful it was that after all those years, they were still so much in love. Eating bits of the very stale remaining slice of their wedding cake.
She'd swallowed her next words when Donovan stomped into the room looking annoyed. Not an unusual expression for her. Donovan looked at her. "Weren't you on the planet?"
He delicately removed John's clothes, if unfortunately not the pain belt, with hand units 444 to 450. 440 and 441 took possession of both coms. Held them next to John's ears. Whispered, "I love you," as he lifted him up with 412 to 420.
He rolled his eyes and showed them the contents of the rucksack.
"I can't believe I didn't think of distance weapons sooner." Mollyhoo lowered the bow.
Dionysus looked around the grove. "This is not enough people for a party." They disappeared and returned with some thirty or forty members of the crew. Omegas and women, John noted. "Now it's a party." Dionysus leaned against an amphora, appearing almost transparent in places. They raised their cup. "Drink and make merry for tomorrow,"
Garak reached up and wrapped the tape around Sherlock's neck. Held it there. "Why would I know anything? I'm just a tailor."
Trois Primus said in a small voice. "Grandmother Brittanus did a very good job retrofitting the original virus that gave the Breen their reproductive troubles."
"It's wrong to take people without asking," said Connor quietly. Firmly.
Killander and the rest of his Section 31 crew were each scanned and got the same result. "Human. Class M." Through the green door they went.
Connor slumped back in the soft couch. His brow wrinkling. "But the Breen are all…" he waved at grandfather and Billy, "like us. Augments. And you wouldn't have to kidnap them."
http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Dagger_of_the_Mind_(episode)
His mum squeezed his hand. "Don't be too hard on him, dear."
The smile disappeared from Hudson's face. "I beg your pardon."
He came, but it didn't help.
Connor looked at the ground. "We gotta go."
Which had Sestre feeling ever so slightly left out. He had a tricorder, but he couldn't smell acid.
None of the cameras found him. He was not inside Sherlock. He did locate the ion drive ship docked on a landing pad. There was a manual control for the hatch on the far side.
His children. He could imagine them. All with Sherlock's eyes and wild smile. Driving them crazy. He found himself paging through catalogues of cribs. Slings so the little ones could hear their heartbeats. Sitting there smiling softly into the distance.
"That's not actually true," said Mollyhoo. "I've done plenty of autopsies on both alphas and omegas, but well..." she looked at John. "Really, John, you've done a lovely job with Sherlock. Helping him keep his emotions in check."
She sipped her own cup of Bajoran fizz. The bubbles pleasant on her tongue. Still she owed her friend the truth. "Not well." She repressed a feeling of failure. That she was somehow an imposter in her role. As the head of engineering, she should have been able to have discovered the cause of the problem by now."
Noonian crossed very muscled arms. "Mei, we have discussed this. We do not have the numbers to treat as equals within the rest of the alignments without the Augment Inferior. We cannot remain penitents at the feast if we are to thrive. Better to reign in hell than to serve in heaven, and hell needs recruits."
Mollyhoo mock glared at Sarabeth, spat out her grain, and asked, "Should I be jealous?"
"It's fine!" shouted someone else.
"That's right. For a solid, your sister has really interesting ideas. Thinks we should be playmates." His lips stretched. "Pals."
John came closer. His scent that terrifying intoxicating blend that smelled so similar to his scent when he was in heat. That filled every corner of their quarters.
John packed a small case of mementos. There was no telling how long they would be. He looked blankly around his quarters. He hadn't been there in almost two weeks. He packed away the pictures of his parent's theater's company. The Watsons. His name wasn't even really Watson. He didn't know who he was.
As they emerged from the shuttlepod onto the Bakerstreet, four tiny figures flung themselves at Sh'Alaack. Clinging limpet like to her legs. "Mama Bihr!" The two younger children were sobbing. One of the older ones was wiping tears from his little blue cheeks. Bright white hair sticking up in all directions.
John kissed his husband quick and hard. "I am going to be very angry with you later."
Admittedly, off to a slow start when John ended up in a conversation with the mother looking for her son's secret fiancée. She explained to John in detail about how her son had died in the war without introducing her to his family out of shame and how she wished he hadn't wasted time hiding his love. They found the secret fiancée, who was in a hidden chamber behind the bar being forced to print counterfeit currency by a sort of Bonny and Clyde pair. The Bonny character read them both a poem about the folly of waiting to declare love because life was short. On cue, there was a shootout with a rival gang that left them dead, but not before revealing a clue about a lost treasure. Something to do with a gold statue of two kissing figures that had belonged to two medieval lovers, who waited too long to declare their love, and ended up parted in a nunnery and with a Medici wife respectively. They found the statue, which they got to keep as a souvenir.
"There's been extensive nerve damage to his right arm. While the nerve regenerator will be able to repair some of the damage, he'll never have the same level of dexterity."
The lights dimmed. Sherlock said, "Also, I am deadly serious about blowing up the power grid if you hurt John."
So it was her first day back on the Bakerstreet, Bihr documented the modifications and saved it in her private records with a local coy on her pad. Over dinner, Kehl looked at her fondly and Ishros squeezed her hand. Bihr stopped waving her fork. "What?"
Sherlock cleared his borrowed throat. "I would like some water and…" he glanced down at the glowing bonds, "to sit up."
They did have a few more chances at this.
William's pet sehlat, I-Chaya, had been injured a week ago. Mummy had insisted that William be the one to end its suffering so that he would understand that the weight of responsibility for something in his care. So that he would understand what his carelessness had led to.
He flushed, feeling a sudden pressure in his chest that had nothing to do with the cinch around his torso. "Also, you're in the military. Your clothing is some form of uniform. You have the insignia indicating a level of rank." He tapped the round circles over the omega's neck. Surely a high ranking officer to be able to keep a mistress in their own quarters. Bushed fingers over a gold object on the beautifully smiling omega's chest. It chirped, but made no other noise. "This symbol is a spaceship of some sort. Perhaps a symbol of the military organization you belong to, which I do not wear."
All these events began with Frankland's tenure as director at the facility.
A week went by and his time ran out to just tell stories.
He found himself wondering why he had been so surprised that Harry had transitioned. After all, it was the orientation she'd been born with. Nothing odd with realizing that she'd made a mistake born out of her feeling of alienation at the stresses John's behavior had put on their family.
"Where's the teaching device?"
Even as a small terrified part of himself urged him to stop.
Jovas shook his head, "The past has merely revealed the truth. Alphas have always been more emotional. Less logical than omegas. It's why they're so bad at the sciences, more suited to the domestic arts. I've heard their brains are actually smaller."
As long as she stayed away from John, Sherlock could wait. He and John withdrew to their nest and hunted birds off the cliffs. He was even getting good at getting eggs from the various nests.
Mollyhoo sighed. "Marymor does seem pretty tame and we do have lye soap now, which... really Sherlock was very clever." She looked at what they were doing with the needles. “Huh... I suppose, yes, the release of aromatics in the Kava needles could... ugh... I wish I could talk to them." She shook her head and then agreed with a stupid idea.
"Planet's full a' minerals," said Gremel. "Just need new equipment. That's what I thought we were asking the Breen to trade for. Not to give the lot away."
On that ridiculous suggestion, Sherlock gritted his teeth. "Yes. That's it. Exactly that." It was better than to say that over the last few days that John hadn't left his Mother's side.
"Within the radius of my influence, nothing can be affected by changes in timelines. I am within and without time. I am. It is the reason that you, John Watson, are here as well. All Augments, and a good portion of the human race, were eradicated by Colonel Green by 2241 because the Bakerstreet never went back in time and enabled Anthea and the first Mycroft Holmes to meet. There was no Breen agent to assist them."
Finally, he looked up. Growled at the very concerned looking bridge crew, "I can keep his systems functioning for now, but it's hit or miss and the only reason it's working at all is Sherlock's level of augmentation. So tell me, what the ever living fuck just happened?"
"Oh, 'Demon Seed' is a book about a woman who has sex with the AI running her house, except its psychotic and it impregnates her with some sperm it cooked up out of her genetic material. It's a weird, disturbing, misogynistic story."
"Spurned you," said Dionysus. "Fine. Whoever wants to drink with the gods, should come down to Olympus. They grinned with stained lips and wild eyes. "And if you don't, vine crushed you'll be."
"A what, the what?" said John, looking at him oddly.
John yelled, "I'm not turning you into a magic pig." And slammed his way into his bedroom.
Which meant John could admit it too. Forehead to forehead in their bed with the stars gliding by in the eternal night of space. Could complain that his body was wrong. He felt clumsy. Angry. Sherlock could complain about feeling the same. Centers of gravity shifted. Hormones nothing like they'd lived with all their lives. Sherlock admitted that sometimes felt so down in the dark, he couldn't even move himself to take a reading on his current hormone levels.
John shouted at Vesha. Shouted out the door. Went to Vesha. Nuzzled him to put his scent on him.
John's father's funeral had been brief. Cremation per his last will and testament. Ashes to be scattered at his family's discretion.
"Sure thing, big guy," said Washington.
"Ah, perhaps Euros was a little less anxious for attention in your universe." Victor balanced the pen-knife while holding his hands as if strangling someone. Flipping it so it landed neatly back in his hand. "My loving little brother, except," he tilted his head, when it comes to his pets. So, sad things went so wrong between William and John, but," Victor smiled with merry twinkling eyes, "who could have imagined that this would be the precise result of sending their children into the past. A tragic rift." He spun the pen-knife. "He's been such a mess the last year. Oh, I could regale you with the hours of moaning and ranting and pacing. The hugging John's pillow until it lost his scent. Sleeping one night out of seven, and then only on the floor at the foot of the bed. Hardly ate. If I hadn't thrown him Hatherley to play with even he would have run himself into the ground. Really what was the other you thinking, leaving him so cruelly." He put down the pen-knife.
"Fine," grumbled Wilkes. "When I have a new crew everything will be exactly as it was always meant to be."
Because as she learned shortly after joining the crew, Sherlock knew exactly how to travel back in time. Had discovered a method one week into his command of the Bakerstreet.
"What happened to Kodos? Did he go to prison?" asked Clara.
"Yeah, well you also know it'll hurt like an asteroid strike when they attach."
"Then be sure to have plenty of anti-fungal supplies," said Sherlock. "So your career doesn’t involve the destruction of two colonies, being removed from an academic position, and losing a ship." John did kick him at that, but Sherlock, the berk, only sniffed.
"Sh'Alaack, think about what you're doing." John came closer. "Don't destroy your life for this. Please, think about your children. Don't you want to know them as they grow up? Let's present any information we have," he didn't dare look back to his father, "and let Security figure this out. Don't make yourself into a murderer. It's not who you are."
"Papa Ishros?" said the little shen. "You saw, papa? Is he well?"
Which really, Martha had only been joking about getting an opportunity to look at Ensign Brand's tight arse, and after all of Sh'Alaack's complaints about not having enough personnel to complete the calibration. She'd thought it would be funny. That Sh'Alaack would laugh.
Finally, he said, "No. She changed me, but you all changed me." He looked up for a brief glance. "You gave me curiosity. I've never thanked you, so thanks. Doctor Bashir's template gave me optimism. My lead programmer gave me sarcasm." He touched a wall of sickbay beneath a camera. The actual method Julian was seeing Sherlock. That and all the sensors laced in the walls around the room. "My full designation is EMH Program AK-1 Diagnostic and Surgical Subroutine Omega-323. The majority of holographic doctors on being turned on asked to be called EMH, Doctor, or Mark. I'm a Mark II. But the tech who installed me is the reason I asked to be called Julian. She thought it was better than being named for what version I am."
John wasn't Julian. He didn't back up his memories off ship. No record keeping needed.
BTW: The way the Golden State Killer was IDed was because a close enough relative posted their genetic data on an open source website, GEDmatch, that puts all the genetic data out to flap in the internet wind, which allowed police to get a match. A thirteenth degree relative (like John) wouldn't have been close enough.
Sherlock couldn't have loved John any more than he did at the moment they both jumped through the portal.
Sherlock froze. "John, I feel I should tell you that while I love you, I'm not entirely attracted to," but John cut him off.
His blood was also water pumped from that same lake into passive filtration ponds. Distilled into potable water. Pumped into tanks for heating.
There was something else. Something niggling. John struggled to sit up further chasing it. "Start at the beginning maybe."
Garak was exacting about fit.
His son looking at him earnest and so very vulnerable. Fragile. The echoes of the day Colonel Green's men came and took him from Billy, screaming were still ringing in Billy's ears.
So what she said next was almost a whisper. "John, isn't just pregnant. He's very pregnant with lots of babies. That's why he's so big even though it's only the end of the first trimester. Even though the individual fetuses are the size of guaga fruit. There's always a risk in pregnancy. With multiple births, there's a lot more health risks. His pregnancy will be shorter and the infants smaller. I've done autopsies on high anovulatory omegas and it's not good. And given the reason Sherlock, who as I've noted before is stronger and faster than anyone else here is so stable is because of John…"
Sherlock smiled. "A privateer never reveals his resources. He holds them close. Only leaving the dead bodies of those who would tell the tale as a warning to those who follow."
"Why are you so obsessed with Khan?" Worth asking. He had to admit that Killander, who leaked information like a sieve for an intelligence officer, made a fairly compelling argument for Khan as alive and well, and off somewhere not bothering Earth.
He chuckled, already imagining the profits that would soon be his.
Palmer brought him a cup and sat next to him. "Please sir, be very detailed. For the official record."
A red light flashed and a clarion went off. Moriarty sighed. "Suppose I'd better see to that. Wilkes is useless. Now don't move."
"Or me," said Connor with an identical expression and body language.
Acheron looked at her wildly. Tears streaming down his cheeks. "Why did you take the peace away?"
"I didn't know it was called the Bakerstreet until you arrived," said the older woman, "I came up here when I came awake in a sort of galley. I," she rubbed the side of her head, "I appear to be able to read some people's thoughts and there is confusion all over the ship. I came here because it's one of the farthest points." She sighed. "Everyone is very loud. Although," she pointed at the red haired woman, the gold braided man, and Amazing. "For some reason I can't read your thoughts, which is a bit of a relief from all the noise."
"Straight up Prime fucking Directive stuff there," said Donovan, raising her phaser. "I will fucking stun the next person who behaves like an arsehole."
John was miserable. Sherlock knew he was miserable, but had no idea how to do anything about it when he felt so horrible himself.
Harry crossed her arms. Sinking back into the couch cushions, glaring. "See! Mum and Dad were getting invited onto the really big theater circuits. Like when grandma and grandpa were alive. Which you had to fuck up because you were too hot for arsehole cocks to keep your legs together. We had to spend three years on a mud ball to straighten you out. Because everything is always all about you. I stayed. I'm maintaining our family tradition. But all anyone can talk about is what a success you are and somehow I'm the fuckup."
He gained centimeters in weeks. Skin stretching. Red lines that smoothed almost as soon as they appeared.
Sestre held up the cloth. "This is sufficient. Open it."
"But the way you reacted to the news about your father. What he'd done." Sherlock looked genuinely confused. His normal people confuse me look, which John did find adorable when it crossed Sherlock's face. So he couldn't resist kissing Sherlock.
She waited to see if Julian learned anything from the others. Hudson's psionic nodes were just beginning their pituitary development. John's hormones were off the charts. Julian said, "That's very high, but within the spectrum at this age."
But John did take a warning from the conversation and Sherlock's need to open every drawer and look at everything.
Sherlock sniffed. "Fine."
John read from one of the medical journals that had piled up, because he was a fucking doctor! Mind drifting constantly to Sherlock, shifting his toes and grumbling about how none of this made any sense.
No had mentioned Odo was on the ship. Which fine, keep things from Killander, but John's back had a crick in it and it wasn't on to keep things from them.
"John, I…" Sherlock looked away. "I realize that you are actually an adult, but I could injure you in your current condition if we were to couple."
While they had been waiting to see if the ovum would implant, that same alliance had pushed deep into Federation space by invading the Tyra system.
They beamed up to the cheery blue of Transporter Room Cloud and John had never been happier to see a place. They went to their quarters where John cooked a meal a good sight more comforting than algae cakes.
"Pewwww," said Thil waving his right hand miming another ship explosion.
"It's my love's three hundredth birthday and I thought, what better present than someone she misses," said Trellane with a bow of a tricorn hat. "But I may have needed to be subtle. The parents, don't you know, tend to be a little," he waggled his fingers, "annoyed when I mess with the timeline. But this hardly counts. Hardly count at all."
John rolled over, letting his ear rest on Sherlock's chest. Listened to his steady heartbeat. "Maybe." He wasn't sure he believed it. "Thank you for listening."
"Um," said the ginger haired woman, "The monitor in front of me just started blinking red. I think we're crossing into something called the Romulan Neutral Zone. Does anyone know if that's good or bad?"
"That's what the other alignments said," said Caorthannach. Softly. Dryly. Drolly. Fenrir snickered.
Something in Sherlock relaxed, as he considered other ways to play and blend the games that they were playing.
The fight had been fast. Almost too fast. And not really a fight.
"Captain, there was a fluctuation in their mass during transportation, as if the transporter was trying to compensate for something," said McCarthy.
A Ferengi came out of one of the quarters with a disruptor set to wide beam. "More chi-dren," said the Ferengi through the typical snaggled teeth. He sniffed the air. "Juvenile omega. Useless for a good price for several years."
"No."
"All, the subject of a great many of theological debates," sighed Veema. "Things became clearer, well, later. When you and um… our great father… um… showed up the last time we held a Conchordia Ancestrum. Three hundred and sixty four of your Earth years ago and… and informed us that this isn't our home world."
Lethe's pheromones roiled out of the shuttlepod. Thick and oily in the air. Slightly burnt like caramelized apples left too long in the oven. But then again, John wasn't the target of her scent. Behind him, Sherlock shuddered and shifted to move close to John. Breathing deeply against his neck. While Sh'Alaack recoiled three steps back.
Apollo kissed Alexis' cheek. "My love, you are full of surprises." He trailed a hand between Alexis' thighs, which spread wider to encourage the touch. "Truly a child of Hermes and Aphrodite, and so of the gods. I will make you my consort and raise you above all the others."
Sherlock wasn't entirely pleased with this level of information. There were too many unknowns and suppositions based on old grievances.
"So, you're good with this?" asked Sarabeth.
Khatri whispered to Washington. "What is wrong with him? He sounds nothing like himself."
So not entirely quickly.
"Captain, it is only logical that you sleep," said Stonn.
Sherlock gave her a sharp look, because if they were allowing an adult alpha out of the pit with the plan to take it into the nest, they were possibly too stupid to live.
Then came the Change. Hot flashes and telepathic abilities set to broadcast. Empathic abilities on overdrive and the general horniness.
"Is that why didn't have any more children when you were unfrozen. Or did you miss mother and my aunts and uncles too much?" asked Billy. Feeling exposed to have asked the question. Wanting to retreat.
He could do nothing but do as his beloved, the center of his everything, desired. Needed to ensure his mate stayed happy and satisfied all through his heat.
"I would think it would be very relevant," said Odo. "It would establish the timeframe for when the Commander would have needed to have access to the site in question. If he can establish an alibi, which should be a simple matter of checking the Bakerstreet’s logs, that would eliminate him."
Which got a few muttered, "Fenisal inspired heresy," comments from some of the other Breen.
"Trap it is then," said John. He turned to Cho. "Go back to the Bakerstreet and have them come back to see if you can find any other way inside." She didn't tell him that he wasn't in her chain of command.
She felt like she was losing an arm. A leg. A love. With the transfer off the Bakerstreet even if they survived the war, there was zero to no chance she'd ever get back on board.
Which was a somewhat astonishing question. The simple answer was keep them safe. Not tell his parents. He had no idea.
She pinched him. "I'd give you the bowfinger, but I need my hands to keep your sorry arse from falling over." They crossed into the hallway and three doors down to the lift. He tried to keep his eyes open. To track where they were going. But his eyelids felt like they were made of granite.
– Drift 3- KB19 and Ru-Unknown."
Boring.
"Yes, but I want you to come back tomorrow. We should carefully monitor your vitals in case anything changes."
Supersmart looked straight at him. "I think you might be the captain."
Sherlock was too late to stop Marymor and the first three alphas from crawling inside, even jumping from rock to rock. He snapped a tree limb and impaled one alpha, while smashing another's temple with a rock.
As he'd grown up on a Bellatrix VIII, and sometimes missed the brilliant blue glow of Bellatrix's light, he set the sunlamp to Blue giant, and set to reviewing the case file of his first patient, Harry Watson. A fascinating and tragic case.
"It's a love poem," said Snow Sparkles, "By someone who is as yet uncomfortable with risk. With saying something as simple as 'I love you' and expecting to receive love back." She pushed Supersmart out of the room, which was fine. Amazing Sparkles had stepped back out onto the bridge anyway.
Hudson called up the mission specs on the monitor. John clutched his coffee and tried to sit as if he and Sherlock hadn't finished having sex fifteen minutes before the briefing.
John was going to get what he needed.
Billy felt the warmth of the communicator hanging from the chain around his neck. Warm from his heart. He couldn't help but smile feeling it there. Couldn't help but pull it up from its nestling place and brush it against his lips like some giddy teenager in one of the entertainments modern Humans liked to watch.
Sometimes Sally had to wonder just what the fuck John Watson had going on between the sheets. Because between Fleet gossip, the way Holmes went on when John was in danger, and now this evil universe prince, clearly it was some kind of crazy making wonderful.
John sat next to him on the command couch as they set off on their continuing voyages.
Little Sherlock gave a soft snuffle. John glanced at Sherlock, who looked drawn and pale. His skin stretched tight around his eyes, his eyes rapidly blinking. Looking at something only he, and apparently Euros could see.
Thought about waiting in sickbay, but really didn't want to. Stopped by their quarters to insert the blue anal plug, which given the antennae made walking to the bridge interesting.
"Do you think John will say yes," said Marida. "You got to know him best before he," she waggled her hand. "And I don't want him to hit me or, I don't know, stake me with a spear like he did that one alpha that tried to come over the wall."
They looked around the quarters they'd shared for the better part of Sestre's life.
"I have observed that you are in a relationship with Lieutenant Hunter."
It wasn't Rura Penthe.
Sherlock slipped pseudopod 400 around John's cock. Its actual purpose was removing excess water. Sherlock had been experimenting at levels of suction that could be applied. He applied less than one tenth of the lowest level of pressure. John was delicate. John was embodied. Everything was about how best to elicit moans and pleasured cries from his embodied partner. His lightning rod. His conductor of light.
"Good fucking riddance," muttered Donovan.
Odo muttered, "Holmes lives up to his reputation once again."
All ships long passed in the night, and as it was Sherlock had asked her to be his XO on the Bakerstreet, which had been simply lovely of him. He really was a dear sweet boy.
"You kinda were," said Shor, which was the ultimate betrayal.
." They waved at Terellhoo.
Whatever Sherlock got from that, he nodded. John stayed and helped Mollyhoo try to stop the bleeding. There was much more blood than with the others, but then Sarabeth had been farther along. Not much farther, but farther.
Marida kept gathering the fruit and said nothing.
Still Mollyhoo marked down the days until their estrus cycle would start up again.
They did.
The creatures conferred again, before several of them explained in a good deal of detail why they had spent many years planning and expending vast resources to free Brittanus from their cryogenic prison. They even provided a gift. A vial of blood, which they had obtained not long after Brittanus left Earth.
He shifted all his limbs. Sliding. Touching. Humming to John from the coms while brushing and sucking and whispering warm air over feet and legs and thighs and arms and chest and all of him. Sherlock lubed pseudopods 347 and 348 with grease and gently slid them in and out of John's anal and vaginal tracts. Turning them slowly to touch John's prostate and graffenberg spot simultaneously while continuing to adjust the suction with pseudopod 400.
Veema said, "In our previous Conchordia Ancestrum, you told us what we needed to know. Then we only needed to trust in fate and wait."
John turned, but he could not see the energy portal that had brought them there.
"Is the answer to what you've always wanted, but…" Culverton smiled, "if I help you, I'll want a little favor later."
They drifted towards Sherlock and said in a sing song voice that John had certain was pretty well engraved in his memory. Euros. "Sorry, about your sehlat."
He hummed his agreement. "Not going to." He rubbed his cheek against Sherlock's chest and chased sleep to the sound of Sherlock's heart.
The apartment had an excellent view of the town center. The transport facility that led up the New Gol shipyards, which were experiencing a boom. Vulcans from all over New Vulcan coming to work in the shipyards, which had been converted from civilian ship production to support building ships for Starfleet. It was understood that Vulcans couldn't join Starfleet, not with so few of them left, but they could provide ships.
"Amazing." So there was. The word Connor was written on a strip of gold metal on the child's wrist. He smiled at the whimsy at the linking small gold flowers that made up the band.
"Excellent," said the daimon. "An industrious worker. I'll be sure to make a note on your indenture papers."
The shop keeper smiled with his mouth. "Oh, yes, it's very rare and unique to Janus VI. This was found in a new cave system that the mines just opened up. Well, new. Old. Used to the old Van Gelder shaft, that they had to close up all mysterious like."
Fisher smiled at her as if she'd said something funny. "Captain Holmes encourages initiative." Which was true, but he also had no patience with idiots.
He wasn't wanted.
As he finished earning John's praises, John laughed, a sound that tugged on Sherlock's very center. "Happy birthday."
Celebium radiation poisoning affected the nervous system.
"Who?" said Connor, which was how he learned a very, very, very different version of the Lady of the Flowers story than the one John told. It featured Aunt Anthea and the Analyst, whose real name was Mycroft, but it mostly focused on the role played by Ti-Lia, a Breen augment, who had volunteered to go to Earth to save Augment kind to maximize the chances that the Breen race would come to exist."
It wasn't entirely a revelation.
They climbed down a ladder into an interstitial space that was not on the site designs. Ended up in a very non-standard space containing another series of distributed computer systems that were very definitely was not on the site designs.
He went to sickbay.
"You might get the impression that I'm hands on," said Moriarty picking his way through the crew lying prone on the floor. "But nothing could be farther from the truth. But I made a new acquaintance and she pointed me to some very interesting allies. Very interesting. They told to keep my hands off you, which just made me want to put my hands all over you." He shrugged. "Now my friend said you needed a playmate. Someone to provide a challenge for you. For little old me. I do have so much fun playing with you."
"Great. Just great." John cast around for something. Anything. "Aren't you a little… young to worry about your one true anything?"
Warden Barrymore greeted her in the control room. "Welcome to the top of the world, Lieutenant Commander? Isn't it a beautiful day?" Barrymore chuckled, "Every day is a beautiful day here at Baskerville."
Finney sat down on a pipe. "Going to do what I should have done near a hundred years ago. Should have known that killing Adams wasn't enough. Not with his own damn machine. Not when it can pluck memories as well as place them. But back then, Jame was alive. Sending me messages. Visiting me for Christmas and my birthday."
"Should we stay?" said Bihr hesitantly. She wanted to return to her family.
As it happened, the Horta were a good deal nicer than John would have been and agreed to allow the colonists to stay on planet provided that they stayed above a certain strata of the world.
Except for his family. There was Mummy. Tears in their eyes – unlikely, unexpected, impossible – tears streaming down their cheeks. "Sherlock, you came back to us. You were able to go and come back as I had hardly dared hope."
Mollyhoo watched as the love of her life painted the shapes black. Ochre for the stars. A fertility image that looked more like John than any of the others. Although, she had to snort at the representation of Sherlock. He might have a big, and apparently magic, cock, but it wasn't that big.
"Fucking stupid parameters," muttered Donovan.
"In that I have not yet beamed down to the planet, no." Sherlock braced himself for a stream of pointers that he should have picked up from the recordings and chemical analysis of the tunnels. Failures in his abilities. Proof that Mycroft was always the superior of the two of them, but it didn't come.
"Hmmm… as you are mine." Sherlock picked John's leather collar out of the box. "Oh!" His eyes widened. "Next time, we should try being sex slaves together. Giving into… forbidden desire. That is," he looked down, "if there will be a next time."

Sherlock carried John over to the couch. Sitting with John nestled in his lap. John cried into Sherlock's chest, while Sherlock stroked his hair saying over and over, "Love you."
"How did you know how to do that?" asked Mama G. "Did you remember something?"
Euros was crying. She hurt. Her arm hurt. Victor had hurt her. "No. No. No. You're supposed to be my friend."
"No," Hudson turned away from Lucy and tapped several controls. The shuttle continued to rattle. "We've encountered an energy anomaly. We're losing hull integrity on the starboard side." She tapped another control. "Bakerstreet. Emergency transport."
But she needed to find her Anna. Her pirate knight so they could go play.
They were to have dinner after the performance.
Unfortunately, word about how John had kept himself busy at the academy, Sherlock had to drive off seven separate offers by various species for John to visit the holosuite with them. There was an offer by the Ferengi owner of the largest bar on DS9 for John to get one – no three – no five – free visits if he would endorse the quality of entertainment in his holosuites.
Wilkes said, "He was quite violent before. Tried to kill me just because I didn't remember him from the academy. Seemed to think that Starfleet's policies unfairly privilege Augments. Gives them jobs they don't deserve while leaving real Humans behind in the mud."
Eva glanced at her a number of times, but was mostly quiet.
After the first dozen jubilant kisses, Donovan had suggested that they get a room, which since Sherlock had a ready room right there, they'd retreated to it.
Sherlock drifted down afterwards. Hardly knowing where he was. Only knowing that John was petting his hair and saying, "You're mine," which was exactly how Sherlock wanted it to be.
"Thank you," said John with feeling.

Shor asked very quietly, "Can you go all over the ship?"
She went into Lucy's lab and had to suppress a feeling of resentment. Lucy was managing to continue her life unabated. Her course of career was to deal with plants, not people.
Mycroft silently had Khan Meiying's transport made ready for her. Chin Singh was placed on a transport pallet and transferred to her care. Her place in the medical lab was taken by William looking pale and still. Motionless.
"His body will die if he stays."
Sherlock had listened to Finney ramble the entire trip through the sewage ducts. Not the most pleasant journey, but it had illuminated the final reason Finney had hobbled the long trek to the relay station. Some ninety years after Finney had murdered the Adams using the full force of his own neural inhibitor, the attacks had begun.
The room exploded into arguments between the Breen, which John really just didn't not have the patience for. "Children!" The room quieted, which was a little disturbing.
The teens had been chattering in the gymnasium for the last several days of the Meiosis of Alignments, while Chin and her brothers, free for once from their tutors, hid beneath the equipment and listened to their plans of attack for the course.
They beamed over to the other ship. It was quiet. Faint sounds of voices in the distance. Billy said, "Connor stay close to me."
"Bored," said another, an omega. Most of the children wandered off as if by some signal. Bihr saw that there were dozens of children of all ages running around the track.
There was nowhere to escape to. Chin hadn't come to save him. The Bakerstreet and its relative safety were gone.
"He was the book, John. It would seem Doctor Bashir and Odo came up with an additional plan," said Sherlock.
Killander dropped the communicator with its gold chain on the top of the metal table with a clang.
John put a bare foot on the ground. "You!"
John couldn't hear whatever it was, but his tricorder showed a life sign in the nearby building. They pushed their way through the half broken door and into the darkness. The sound of crying became clearer. They came to a closed door in a long hallway. "Hey there," said John. "We don't mean you any harm. We got your signal, and we came to help."
Before he could say anything, Mummy silently left the room.
"Please, sir," he writhed on the pillows, pushing his hips up invitingly. "I… please sir, I could have more than one specialty."
She unlocked the command codes and restarted the transporter.
But Sherlock never would be. John could tell that from the way Sherlock preened and smiled, and took his hand before they went to sit on the command couch.
"We don't need a truce." Moriarty drawled. "More ships and more Jem Hadar will be here shortly. Don't you fret that pretty little face of yours." He stretched out a limb to slide a tendril down Damar's neck ridges. "You'll winkle."
John was sitting in the sun room staring at the waves in silence.
Sherlock said, "When my body dies, you should leave. The controls to operate the door are on the far wall. I don't have access to the code to open them, but you should be able to determine the pattern using a tricorder. You have some facility to breaking into rooms." That last statement was rueful.
"I believe in aliens, not gods," said Sherlock sharply.
"No," said the Guardian. "He and his team did not do significant damage when they killed thirty-eight insects by walking through the field of chemja flowers. The insects would have died soon after and had no role in causing the plague that would occur in the following year."
And if you're wondering what the storage sizes they were throwing around are:
While others, must trade upon their appearances to make their way. Sherlock's role. A dewy slip of eye candy on John's arm wearing absurdly high heels as they swept into the party. That he had the holodeck smooth his face to make him appear ten years younger was a delicious conceit. He towered over John and it didn't matter.
Sherlock knew that Sh'Alaack would never have allowed such a case of criminally negligent network architecture on the Bakerstreet.
That he even mixed it up. The next time Mycroft came for a visit, Elim was just heading out the door to meet with Captain Sisko about some clandestine work placing self-replicating mines at the entrance to the wormhole. Mycroft said, "I understand. You must cutoff the Dominion's supply lines." Although Elim had only mentioned a sartorial emergency. "Don't worry about the Breen coming into the war. They'll be dead in four generations from a self inflicted wound. What's the point of conquest if you won't be around to see it. Good luck on keeping the Dominion from standing on our graves."
Luma came to where John, Washington and the others were working in one of the hydroponics rooms. She said, "John, Washington, I've observed that you have a higher level of intelligence than the rest of the Morg. I'm going to need your help repairing the super-heated steam units on level 45."
"He's ready," said Sherlock, pushing the device on his chest off. He took that he could do even that to be a sign that that this body's health was increasing.
Shopkeepers were coming out of their shops. A woman in a security uniform ran up.
The start of another mission.
"Ummm… about that," said Lucy. "John, do you want to stay with me and Eva while we're," she waved at them, "like this."
"While Yao attempted to delete the record of a Petty Officer Forester's visit to this facility. Given Forester died at Wolf 359, her appearance two months later was impressive. Particularly since on the recording of her visit, Forester looks exactly like Yao. How unfortunate for you that the Starfleet retention policy for access records is twenty years, and not three."
Her devices were telling her was that the schematics were grossly out of sync with what had actually been implemented in the facility.
Billy looked up at the star map. "Okay, let's research some more about the planet together. Show me that city map again."
"I want a story, Daddy," said John, pulling Sherlock's hand back to his chin. Up to his lips. He stole a little kiss.
He thought he might have figured out why everyone was acting like that with him when Ms. Melusine had him come to the front of the class to introduce him. Ms. Melusine was an original omega Augment from Earth like Grandfather, but from a different creche. She was shorter and more muscular. She smelled like lavender and sage. Her long silver hair was braided into a crown. Grandfather said that she'd ruled France and parts of Germany when Brittanus controlled Europe.
Brittanus' consciousness returned as if a fog was clearing as they woke up from their cryogenic sleep. Less wearing than the last time when they had been woken by Starfleet to be leashed as a weapon of war to another’s purpose.
Little Sherlock nodded his agreement.
He grinned. "Love you." Happy to be with John.
The next time he played the role of warlord's concubine, he paddled the nasty barbarian John for kidnapping him and when John had promised do anything for him, revealed he was secretly a prince from a faraway kingdom, who needed John’s help to regain his birthright.
John shook his head. "I haven't been able to think about anything other than getting your cock into me since the accident."
"I think it's a mistake to leave this location," said Hunter, doubtfully.
"Which is?"
Was rewarded with a growl from Sherlock.
Odo remained with her.
But it had stung when the power cut out when they passed by an energy stealing space amoeba and the ensign he was currently trapped in a shuttle with "
Lieutenant Palmer looked up when he mentioned the well-known campus hook up spot.
Wondered if he should say something. Anything. Pregnancy might go differently for John. He didn't have the body of a god. His body was not too strong an adversary for anything as small as bundles of cells. He was a mere mortal tangled in sheets with a grieving madman.
The daimon shrugged. "He's not too young for us to sell his indentured papers, and," he put a hand over his heart, "perhaps we can sell your indenture together."
Connor's mum exchanged several more sharp words with Soo-Lin.
Sally put a command lock on the shuttle tied to her personal code.
"No, we're not allowed to play with you!" said Chin firmly, sitting up. "Mother and our Fathers said so." Chin Singh was glad. Euros made her feel uncomfortable. It wasn't just that she was a year older. Mycroft was even older, but he was just boring.
Eva missed her mommy. She loved Daddy. He read her Eva's favorite story about Lighta, a lightbulb, who was worried that no one ever saw her when she shown her light on foggy nights, and her best friend, Chaira, who was a chair and kept her company in her tower by the sea. But then a Queen, Hearta, and her heart, Queena, on their ship with golden sails got lost in the fog and the lightbulb turned on at the top of a tower and guided the Queen and her heart home to a safe harbor, but he didn't read it like Mommy did.
Vulcan's were touch telepaths and Sestre was only now just learning how to properly mind meld. Sestre nodded at Connor to let Connor know that he'd seen the gesture and understood.
John was not similarly focused on those events. He never mentioned it. He joined a band with Sh'Alaack, Bailey, and Smith. They were terrible, but they would not allow Sherlock to help. They did allow Sherlock to play compositions after they held terrible concerts in the cargo bay.
Watson said as calm as if he was walking through on the Bakerstreet with friends, "You have T'ka condition. Not uncommon in Vulcans living below ground. An hour a day under a red sun lamp and two cc of copper, and the rash on your arm will clear up. So, when she say's I'm a doctor, believe it."
"The Breen, then."
She clutched her coffee mug. "Just as happy to have history fucking forget me."
"Maybe I can do something about that," said John crouching down next to her. "My name is John. I'm a doctor. If it's a sickness then maybe I can help." He smiled gently at her to try and draw her out. "What should I call you?" He ignored Sherlock's grumbling about John's flirtations, which was clearly ridiculous.
"Belay that. We need to find John," said Sherlock. "Based on my analysis of the wreckage, the 221C was attacked by a Starfleet courier. We will still be able to follow the decay rate of the warp field for the next six hours, but after that the trail will go cold."
John was not going to have any of that. He pointed at Mollyhoo. "She was a forensic pathologist. A background in science. I'm a doctor and was in the military." They hadn't wanted him, but no need to go into that just then. "Sherlock knows, among other things, chemistry." Jovas looked skeptical, but John pushed on. "Stop wasting our time. He really does. I'd be very surprised if there aren't things we can use to blow things up with around here."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomeronasal_organ
Really, it wasn't Sherlock's fault after they escaped to the temple of the mummies, which the natives would not enter for reasons that Sherlock could not care about.
All was smoke. All was fire. Pine pitch at his back. John's aromatic scent the scent of the forest. Of the wild. Of everything Sherlock needed. John on his knees, face buried between Sherlock's thighs, licking labial folds and clitoris. Whirled suction.
John found himself walking next to Sholto, who abruptly asked, "What are your earliest memories of your family? What about your Father's relatives? What do you know about them?"
Sh'Alaack suggested a stupid theory for what could have happened.
https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/second-coming
Thil and Shor, awake and freed from their strollers, raced for their room. Shroleb followed at a more reasonable pace with the younger twins.
"He appears to draw power from positive attention." Sherlock pressing closely against John. His breath warm in John's ear.
He bucked even more wildly, until his mate bit his neck. Assuring him that he wasn't going anywhere. That he'd give John what he needed. Wanted him. Needed him too.
The soft sweet center that that the story man had told her was there was crumbling and falling apart.
Instead he said, "I saw how the shop owner operated his storage unit. It contains its own battery power."
Which at least meant that John could earn his presence. "Triolic energy is deadly to Human tissue, but shouldn't be able to penetrate the shields as long as we don’t linger."
There was a chirp on John's child communicator. Khatri's voice came on. "We have engineering."
"No, it would have made more sense," said John. "The cave is nice, but you could build a place to live."
John had to give the order to pull back from the front line because there was no way – Sherlock would have found a way - the shields could withstand more blasts.
She put one down.
Harry crouched down to be at eye level with them. "Do you know what an evil fairy godmother is?"
John was on a bit of a personal mission. To figure out just what was going on between him and Sherlock.
If they had to leave, Connor wouldn't be able to say goodbye to Shrilaas and Keraas, but they were little.
Harry sighed. "We were so close growing up."
Course, it was over the morning briefing that John realized that he was an idiot.
Sherlock echoed a thought from First Father absently, "Doing the same thing over and over is the definition of insanity, not intelligence," and knew immediately it had been the wrong thing to say from the way John stiffened.
"Stage right front!" said Harry.
"Really! But," Connor trailed off. Perhaps not wanting to think about breeding after spending so many months focused on nothing but.
John raised his arms. No blue lesions. "It..." his mouth was dry as the desert outside. He tried to swallow and began again, "It worked?"
Instead of platitudes, Benjamin hummed a soft reply.
The transmission cut off.
On one bare wall was a message was scratched into the metal. "Tell Jame, her father will always love her, Benjamin Finney." A serial number followed and coordinates. Given the amount of dust settled into the metal, the message wasn't new. There was even some indication that someone had attempted to sand it away, but given up.
Disembodied he could revel at the lightning rod that was John. Clever. Knowledgeable. Sure as he made little adjustments to prolong the life in Sherlock's body. Sparking ideas in Sherlock. There had been so many ideas over the years. John was not only Eros, he was Psyche too. Sherlock as well. He lowered pseudopod 401 and pressed a kiss to love's lips.
Owen came in requesting pre-natal vitamins and an immune suppressor with a rueful smile. "Been knocked up by a fucking good lay. Sorta thing my granny warned me about. Sorta thing I worried a good bit 'bout when I was younger. These days…been trying to see what would happen. Figured I'd let fate roll the dice. No one I wanted to hook up with when I was in my twenties and thirties. Figured at forty-five, this choice was a bit behind me. But, been thinking takes a village to raise a kid and we've got one here." He tapped his knuckles against the soft surface of the bio-bed. "Been thinking I'll keep the little rug rat. What do you suppose the kid'll be like?"
He kept bringing it up. As if she could ever forgive what had happened.
Thil was wrongly imprisoned. It was not fair. It was not fair that their mamas and papas were trapped on the planet.
Odo sighed.
His thoughts ran in hysterical little circles like Zyan snow weasels on a wheel. This could not be happening.
Lucy felt her own spike in anger that wasn't entirely teenage hormones. Words that she'd suppressed for years tumbled out. "You mean like putting an alpha in a privacy shield with an omega just after she's just given birth. You mean like an adult alpha can't trigger a heat in an omega who has just given birth! You mean like micro-heats aren't a thing! You mean like that!"
Sestre turned his attention to Connor. "What made you roll the rock towards the creature? How did you know that would cause it to leave? Your answer to Captain Holmes was very vague."
"Which our readings show was there. We now have proof," said Terellhoo.
"Fine. Yes." Sherlock patted where his com would have been if he weren't in disguise.
Sherlock said, "You heard what your Khan said. You should already be obeying. Out. Out. Out."
"Well, twig, we don't have all day. Help me up. There's something I need from my quarters."
"Unless I am mistaken, and who can tell with its disgusting biology, it is pregnant." The doctor looked at John. "I do not know how it will fit so many in there as they grow."
John didn't want to walk away. He wanted to hold on with both hands. But he didn't know if it was the right thing to do.
John shook his head no, which was unacceptable.
"That is how I know that this is for a significant event," said Elim with a little smirk. A tilt of a smile that implied he already knew everything. A technique that might work to elicit confidences if the recipient were anyone other than Mycroft. "You've told me nothing. Haven't bothered to lie at all." Then all business, Elim explained the best methods to care for the folds in the fabric. The proper method to wash it – sonic bath, never water. There were a few subtle – really Elim was an artist – comments designed to elicit information in the form of instructions.
"Ooooh, that means Amazing Sparkles here is a thief," said Prince Sparkles. "While I am definitely the Captain. Sitting in this couch is comfortably familiar."
Julian's laugh was soft. "I'm not a program in a holodeck. I'm made up of fifty million gigaquads of memory. Hunter cleaned up my code. My memory storage. Put a place for a sexual subroutine, but…I augmented the algorithm that gets positive feedback when a patient is healthy with a specific sub-routine for Violet when Violet gave me control over my own code." Julian looked around the room. "Seems to me as good a definition of love as I've read in any database. And I do have the benefit that a ship, unlike an Eymorg base, moves around. Handy when you love and are loved by a navigator."
If John hadn't been so insatiable. If he hadn't been so wonderfully possessive, everything might have gone differently.
They moved the party over to an open air veranda under rioting flowers. John lay down on a long padded bench overlooking the view of volcano and surging sea. He beckoned to Sherlock. "Here, boy, come lie beside me."
"Slut," coughed his sister. His twin sing songed, "Commander Holmes said something brilliant. Holmes is such a genius. Sherlock told me water is wet. Imagine that! Amazing! Holmes says. Sherlock says. Ugh." Harry flopped back on the couch.
Sherlock stood up in one voluptuous move. Smiled like no one the age of the body he wore had ever smiled and did a slow backbend into handstand and then to stand again. "Sir. Don't you want me? You've pleased me three times, a lowly slave, and I haven't pleased you even once." He caught his lower lip between his teeth.
Kara lowered the device. "I can't do it alone."
More and more of the others reported feeling in better health than they had in years. Certainly, they were all well fed with decent supplies for once.
Grendel smiled kindly. "They want nothing with you, my child. Only I long to know what became of my children. To know my grandchild. No," he shifted his gaze to John with familiar blue eyes, must be where mum's family got them from, "having identified one John Watson based on it would seem a very specific genetic template, which has me wondering why they were looking for it, the other alignments wish him to remain." He shrugged. "No matter. I am not privy to the plans of Khans. But under the circumstances, perhaps it's for the best if you make a daring escape on my fastest ship." There was a crinkle to his smile that John did not want to find charming. "You will, of course, be kidnapping me to achieve this." He reached over to a table and pulled out a small device, which he tossed to John. "Please use this rather than the disrupter you're clutching.
He was going to make sure no one took a closer look at Sherlock's blood or genetics or whatever was going on with him that kept regenerating parts of John's reproductive system. Which wasn't the sort of secret Starfleet needed anyway. He was also going to make sure no one did a brain scan on Sherlock. They didn't need to know about the damage that had been done to Sherlock as a child.
She called up some historical records. "Meanwhile, I'm going to see what I can learn about the Greek gods."
But they had a still now and tallow candles. And bricks, which perhaps she should have thought of making a frame for shaping clay and grass gathered high on the mountain side, and then sun drying them so they could make a real entrance to the cave door. A real door with a cross bar, because Sherlock and John has said some friend of theirs had explained how that worked too. They'd all gotten quite a lecture on basic architecture.
"The Prophets," John had never heard Benjamin call them anything other than wormhole entities, "ensured that my biological mother and father would meet, and that I would be born. That I would be their Emissary. To the point of a Prophet taking over the mind and body of an innocent woman. That Prophet pretended that she was falling in love with my father, married him, waited until a year after I was born, then they released her. She must have been terrified and confused as to what had happened." Benjamin sighed. John sighed with him. "It's difficult not to want to assume responsibility." He turned his cup in his hands. "For things neither of us had any control over."
It was tedious trying to repress the Ferengi, who made far too many follow up suggestions, which appeared to amuse the Augments from the Bakerstreet to no end. Sherlock could do without Khatri commenting on John's great game. Although, Lucy pulled him aside to explain that much of the amusement was just nerves.
"Glorious Dionysus," said Mr. Melas, coming out of the ready room. "Whose gift of wine makes even the dark seasons full of delight, Captain Holmes is a young hero of fine pedigree, who has been paired with Doctor Watson," they gestured at John, "erastês to his erômenos. To teach him the ways of manhood, even as we adventure among the stars."
He had no nerves. No skin.
John had no idea what Mollyhoo wanted. John looked at Sherlock, who looked as puzzled as John felt.
Bound.
"Yeah, and I do. Anyway, John may love him, but Sherlock looks like a whole lot of work. But," she stared at the monitor with its peaceful planet and ships, "you've given me something to think about."
John nodded. Not sure if he was convinced.
Definitely the arctic.
Mycroft had been studying the theory of what to do. He wanted a thousand opportunities to test theory.
"Fucking Killander, crawled out from your Section 31 rock." John moved to stand between them and where Billy and Connor were sitting. "I told you before, I've got nothing to tell you. I healed because of an anomaly. Khan is fucking dead as dust."
Lethe said, "Although, really, it was my good fortune that the Bakerstreet chose to send down someone who'd been previously been conditioned by the neural neutralizer. The more exposure, the quicker the subject is to take suggestions. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to progress this far with her in so short a time. But enough chit chat. Harry, I'm your sister. You remember that right. All the fun we had growing up. All the peaceful memories. Join me. We have important work to do out there bringing warmth and light into people's lives."
Harry still took John's wedding ring and put it on his own finger. A finger that had been bare since his divorce from Clara.
Hobb said, "We," he glanced at Chin and the three armored Breen standing silently behind her, "tried that, but…"
Sherlock stood in front of the cave entrance. Desperate. "John fine. Future."
Sherlock watched John. Waited.
, you never believed you would!" called out a Breen with wide cheekbones and a hennaed DNA sign on their face.
Because there was still that box in his desk in the medical bay reminding him of certain things he hadn't told Sherlock every time he opened it. A box that was only getting fuller, because space was full of ways to take out his suppressants, and he and Sherlock were still fertile as fuck together. None of which touched on that maybe he did want kids, or he wasn't sure, but he certainly didn't want to when talking to someone who thought that was all he could possibly want out of life.
No one had ever described her parents like that. The aching part of that thought was she had no idea where to put the thought.
Sherlock did not introduce himself. He approached a set of bars and casually did some flips and rolls. The sort of flashy maneuvers that he knew that he had practiced endlessly as an older child.
Too young.
Thankfully, Sherlock lopped back in and John tackled him. The love birds had sex and no one died.
He was still fussing with the corpse making sure it stayed a corpse, when the door was flung open. Not-Sherlock charged through the door with a very evil looking weapon. The corridor behind him smelled like burnt meat. Not-Sherlock yelled, "Get away from..."
And by the way the dance number they're talking about is this:
Soo-Lin, who was sitting on his other side whispered, "I find it odder that John's sister is playing Lady Macbeth and not his mother."
Hudson coughed. "In my day, personnel took the opportunity to gain information from sources on the ground before leaping to accusations.
"So happy we made your day," said John in what he thought was a reasonable voice. He reflected that after all the times someone had attempted to kidnap and sell him, he'd finally run out of luck.
She was almost afraid to ask, but she was the daughter of Khans. "What is it?"
Getting Sherlock to fuck him was all John could think about.
None which stopped the internal swearing.
The way she said that was utterly familiar. Futile. Familiar.
"Last time," said John, confused. "Khan is ashes. Pretty much the only time."
He was a scientist. His miracles occurred in laboratories. Even there, chaos theory had its say.
"That's not the only reason," said Killander quickly. "Ambassador West died under your watch on a mission where Captain Holmes' brother attempted to gain access to Federation secure records."
Sherlock went to where John was. John laughed and took him in his arms. He wrapped his own arms around John. Whispered, "Love you. Love you. Love you." He wanted to say what was important while he still had the words.
John was beginning to feel like this was just a time of accidental meetings. He found himself blurting, "Sir, I didn't know you were going to be here."
Around them, there were a least a hundred people gathered there. Each looked just as terrified as Connor. Many far the worse for wear than John. They were all Augments. A mix of alphas and omegas. John didn't recognize them.
He was able to open a connection with Donovan. Just about. Static and all. "Sh'Alaack has a plan to get us back," he whispered loudly into the communicator.
Sherlock clasped his hands together thinking. "If that's the case, you weren't merely reverted to an earlier age, but the transporter changed your genetics so instead of going into a pseudoheat, you experienced juvenile heat."
"You know," whispered John, "I was already sexually active if I'm the age I think I am."
"I know, honey," said Billy. "But we have had so many good memories here on the Bakerstreet."
John blew out a breath, because Sherlock's family was killing him just a bit, and squeezed her shoulder. "Not your fault."
They tried again. Beamed two back in to float their way down John's fallopian tubes. Still some laughter. Less. Tinged by worry.
She gave him a droll look. "Try inmate. Sorry, long term guest. As I understand Finney was due to be released half a century ago, but his daughter had died, grandchildren were getting on themselves and didn't know him. He stayed in the only place he knows. Not that uncommon truth be told. But there's nothing he doesn't know about both Baskerville and Tantalus." She shrugged. "A bit before my time, but he was a... guest back when Adams ran Tantalus. But it's time for the pièce de résistance, your new office." She turned a corner into what he could only describe as a closet with a desk jammed into it.
Dad, in typical Dad fashion, shrugged, and ate a carrot.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalm_137
"Then for my pleasure, you'll bathe again," said John, who was more than happy to take off both the toga and tunic, and sink into a raised metal tub heated by a small wood burning oven. It overlooked both the foam flecked sea below and, of course, the smoking volcano.
"You mean people don't like being kidnapped and turned into baby donors you mean," said Connor hotly. "Having their ability to choose where they want to live taken from them. Being told who to mix their genes with in a machine."
"Uh, I prefer to think of myself as mine," said John feeling more than a little lost in the conversation.
"What do you care?" She drew herself up to their jointly average height, but in presence she was full on Medea. "Last thing we had in common was when we were in Mum's womb. Even then we were splitting. You're sinister and I'm right. I came out first and then after that, everything has always been about you."
Life was not what she'd intended when Mollyhoo'd spent six years studying medicine and forensic science, but it was better than it had been. She wasn't starving all the time.
Bihr came out of the ready room, looking excited, cheeks still slightly damp. "I have had an idea. I think there is a way that we could restart the instruments on the bridge in safe mode, which would give us limited control over the ship. We might even be able to restart them altogether." They waved a hand at Amazing Sparkles. "Use the tricorder to override the lockout on the panel locks, and then we can access the isolinear chips, which will give us a way to restart." They waved the tablet. "There are clear instructions on what to do."
Instead, he was wearing a lumpy sweater, canvas pants, and there was a smear of ash on his cheek. He was scurrying about the coffee shop where Sherlock was standing, being ordered about by two women at the counter doing little to nothing.
Which since she wasn't wrong, John found himself retorting, "You're just imagining things because you destroyed your marriage by cheating on Clara."
Stonn said, "I had not planned originally that we would get the benefit of these years in each other's company when I joined Starfleet. We have both benefited from Captain Holmes' lax regard for Starfleet protocol." It also went without saying that they'd benefitted from the lack of promotions that had come the way of the Bakerstreet crew.
Doctor Vardas had replied, "He and his mother provide a map reversing what they did. Provided our new ally can do as he says."
"Mr. Watson, is it even remotely possible that you could pay attention to what I am saying."
"Fuck! You're that John Watson!" exclaimed Lieutenant Palmer. She flushed. "I um… I'm a friend of M'Kalla." John tried to place the name. She said, "He's Caitian if that helps. And yeah, he remembers you. He quit the academy to become a warrior poet for a couple of months after you hooked up. He only signed back up again because the Ground Troop division was offering credit bonuses for heavy gravity worlders and um...I... ah... was a couple of years behind you at the academy, but you were kind of a legend. There were poems about you in the stalls in the Celenium Chapel bathroom."
She didn't understand how everything had gone so wrong.
Benjamin spit-choked on his drink, but waved John off. When he recovered, Jake said, "It's been awhile since we'd visited family on Earth and Bashir had heard so much about gramp's restaurant, he came along."
"We're not here to discuss irrelevant history," said Killander. "Instead, we should talk about Kodos, the executioner, your father. Were you were aware that the investigation after his crime showed that he targeted certain colonists? Certain non Augmented colonists for execution?"
Another alpha. Invader. Enemy. He bared his teeth at the stench. Sherlock stood up. The cold wind whipped around them. John shivered. Teeth chattered.
At the edges of Connor's hearing, he could hear a voice whisper, "Sitting with the snitch."
Their reports came back in droves to the ready room from all over the ship.
However, what John is doing here is less how to change DNA than how to understand DNA. For example, how certain SNPs (pronounced "snips") relates to how people respond to therapeutics. Although, in this case, how Sherlock's SNPs are a therapeutic.
"Billy and Connor should be on the Bakerstreet," said John. "Contact our ship."
Harry, who used to eat his mushy peas for him, because he didn't like the texture.
The ice was full of enemies. Giants running across the ice in armor, who streamed around them. The giants didn't matter. What mattered was the treasure.
Martha was more than ready for Sherlock, anyone, to return her to her actual age.
On the other side what they found was Earth. Same continents. Same seas. Same stars even. But no satellites. No space traffic. The moon was empty.
Her identity with a little nudging led her to being appointed the new head of the Bakerstreet's engineering's department. Although, with her brother where he was, she took the precaution of spreading such evidence in Mummy’s cryochambers that would put the focus on her should the need arise. She took the precaution of changing her appearance. All the while hoping he'd see through it. Her scent had changed with adulthood, but she was still his sister.

The lights around the room glowed as if he was looking through a pane of glass covered in a petroleum based product. He felt dizzy when he turned his head. His tongue heavy with guilt. He felt so guilty taking what belonged to his sibling.
He told it, "We're unable to reach our ship."
(See the end of the chapter for
He wanted to talk to Sh'Alaack, to know if she'd seen anything. But when he checked in on Sh’Alaack, as he'd arranged, her family were always around. Her kids clutching drawings showing stick figure of Sh’Alaack with her family.
Mollyhoo wasn't tired. She should be. She had plenty to do. Instead of doing it, since the day was pleasant, she went to the top of the tallest tower with Toby the fourth. Looked fondly out at the valley with its little squares fields. Each tended by a different family alignment with the produce shared in common. Herds of unishap grazing on the mountain sides of the next valley over. Baskets of their dung gathered for the fields. Little houses made of kiln hardened bricks. Bricked refrigeration granaries on the high mountainsides built to capture the cold wind and keep out pests. Brick and mortar towers as it came to it too.
John blinked. That had been so long ago. So many adventures, but it had been the first. The most important. He'd almost forgotten about it.
Veema said, "They continued to drive many insane until some brave souls returned to this world to hold the first of the Conchordia. That was before we developed the radiation shielding. They could not be allowed to contribute to reproduction after that event, and so we developed our current methods of," Pavan coughed, "Never mind. But you must have gone to the future. Who else could it have been? It's only logical."
John did not shout that no, he couldn't have bloody well have turned over the love of his life to explain his magical cure or even offered up poor Billy to that prick Killander, but he'd had dual ambitions once. He hadn't just wanted to be a doctor when he'd joined Starfleet. He'd seen a career unspooling before him. A long climb in the ranks. A rank that would force people to respect him for the Augment he was. Or at the very least an official place in the hierarchy.
"Tomorrow, we'll find out what the child knows. I'll give you the night to think about that," said Killander in what he probably thought was an intimidating tone.
Sherlock had another confrontation with Marymor that came short of him breaking her newly healed leg. With most of the omegas shouting at him, he didn't.
All told they wasted a month on DS9.
It had to be.
"There's something else you should know. Mummy and your fathers' are not aware of what I am about to show you, but," he looked at the valley, "this is the one place with no surveillance."
Kodos the executioner had killed Bihr's intended bondmates and everyone else of importance in her life. She'd never gotten to have her Ceremony of Knowing, but they'd played together. Been friends. Known their families plans. Before Kodos.
"Sometimes they would visit. More often there were holographic versions of them." He leaned into John's hand. "It's where they took me when the Borg were invading."
He was about to contact John to have him search Gremel's quarters when John contacted him. "Sherlock, an old engineering friend just showed up with an interesting problem with rocks. I'll be out of range of the colony communication relay." After a moment, John said, "Love you." And was gone before Sherlock could respond.
"Yay, a quest!" said Thil far too loudly.
There wasn't time to think about it. Watson and Donovan were exposed to whatever it was that was going on here. From where she was, she was closer to the asylum than the landing pad. She strapped the spectrum calibrator back into its holster, but left it on. It didn't have much of a range, but it would enough to keep herself and anyone within a few meters of her safe.
John tried to push himself up, but was pulled off balance by not-Lestrade. "We don't have time for you to question the Prince's breeder," said not-Lestrade. "You can do that later when we're sending parts of him back to his master." More hands grabbed hold of John and hauled him into the twisting corridors. He had a jumble of impressions that only cleared when they came out into the Andorian surface.
Mollyhoo said, "Most omegas are induced anovulatic. Responding to the release of seminal plasma and the distension of the posterior vagina, knotting, to produce and release eggs in heat resulting in singlets, twins, and triplets. But," Mollyhoo stroked Toby's fur, speaking faster and faster trying to get the horrifying thought out, "some omegas when exposed to high amounts of musth in seminal plasma during proestrus have increased ovarian follicle production that result in high anovulation. High order multiples, HOMs. Plus there's whatever is going on with Sherlock's cock, which if I had a lab I might maybe be able to figure out. Normally, only identicals are monochorionic-monoamniotic, but with HOMs, there could be dichorionic-diamniotic, monochorionic-diamniotic, and monochorionic-monoamniotic, which could lead to twin-twin transfusion syndrome, asphyxia, meconium aspiration, and hypothermia during and after delivery. We live in a cave! Then there are the preterm premature rupture of the membranes. Not to mention the risk to John of extreme preclampsia and…"
The next morning Sherlock was ordered to report to the station security office. He did not go to his memory palace to think.
So not the same timeline. They hadn’t lost their ability to think until months later in the past and their clothes would have been far worse for wear if they'd been in the past long.
John wasn't sure he was up to this. To whatever he'd find. He took those emotions and buried them. Soldiered up and kept on. Crawled and climbed his way to the highest point in the ice canyon and into a valley that was achingly familiar beyond.
Sherlock reached out again with units 456 through 460 to lightly brush John's arms. Cup his face. He couldn't feel smooth or rough. Texture or warmth. There was nothing to evoke a pleasure response. Other than observing John's pupil dilation, increased heart rate and breathing. John said, somewhat oddly, "But I hated 'Demon Seed' both as a book and a movie."
Connor still had flowers in his hair from flinging them at the audience. Eva gave Lucy the rings on a pillow, saying, "Idiot rings, Mama."
Mycroft broke before Mother – naturally. "I can fix this."
"Oh, fuck sake!" said Donovan.
But John would definitely need to take the after heat pill. If Sherlock's theory was correct, he could use the information in the transporters pattern buffer to return them to the state they'd been in the last time they transported, but that wouldn't work if there were cellular material splitting inside John. The results of attempting to reverse the accident while John was in a gestating condition would be catastrophic.
John pulled several small purple crystals out of his socks. "A gift from the planet. I gave my um… Daddy your gift," he said glancing back at the Ferengi outside the door.
"Yes, Mum," mumbled Connor in what was probably the precursor to his teen years, which put its own bolt of fear through Billy for what Connor might go through.
"Uh…" said Billy, "Maybe I could talk to Commander Holmes' brother."
"Yeah, you've mentioned that a few times," said the ginger haired woman.
Sherlock had not intended… He had not expected… He had not predicted… None of his models for that conversation had identified that outcome.
If he wasn't fully satisfied, John might want to stop.
"What mission?" Suddenly, John was furious on Sherlock’s behalf. Everyone should know what an amazing thing Sherlock had done. "We had no orders. We went in a ship that Sherlock built. More of a modified photon torpedo. Tight for two grown men. Used tech he came up with. Something to do with Borg being like ants that could be programmed into thinking other Borg were part of a different collective and attacking each other. His whole theory was that biological life is like that. Attacking things that are different." He looked at Benjamin. "It strange now to think about it. We argued on the way back, because I didn't think the Federation was like that, but," he looked around the security office in which he now found himself, "not far off from the truth."
What John said next felt almost like a blow. "If my RVN are causing this juvenile heat thing, John looked at the floor. "We… uh… may need to avoid each other after I deal with um…" he waved at his abdomen. "Otherwise, I'll just go back into foggy brained heat." He scowled. "I've said over the years that the scientists who designed us were utter cocks, but I'm thinking we should go back in time so I can punch them in the nads."
One of the omegas said, "Has Sarpeidon been overthrown? Are you here to help us survive?"
He was covering the pit when a hulking alpha came down the narrow canyon to the north. Mollyhoo shot an arrow from a small horn bow strung with sinew. The arrow went high and wide.
"Oh," said Wiglaf. He chewed on his steak. "I thought maybe you were sitting here to check up on us. Because I'm a distant descendant of Grendel. To see if I'm good enough to go to the um… ass," he smiled softly, "class. Maybe spend more than a few afternoons in the Gold Zone at um… many times Great Grandfather Grendel's. The asinine asses said that I'm not Augment enough to go there. They live in the Gold Zone with their parents. I'm only allowed in the Green Zone with the Augments who decided to stay and have kids here, or sometimes I volunteer in Red Zone to show the ones who don't want to be here what they're missing, which requires special permission. Not everyone can go there." Fenrir groaned and rolled her eyes.. "Not the Purple by the port." He trailed off. A compressed bag with all its air released.
The troop put on Macbeth.
The alpha stepped onto the platform and circled around Watson, who broke his hold on Bihr's wrist. He looked at Watson as an animal eyes meat. "Long in the tooth, but comely enough. Perhaps it's time I see about getting a new pet. We'll have to see once the pound gets those clothes off you and prepares you." The alpha dragged his fingers down over John's chest, as he reached Watson's reproductive organs, Watson punched him, which… was this a signal for Bihr to fight?
For a moment, then Pavan, as if he'd been bottling the words up for a few centuries said, "In the first recording, you're in perfect health. The Great Father is wearing what we now know is a current era Starfleet uniform. The two of you very coherently explained our real planet of origin, and other," he glanced at the red Breen, "relevant facts, and left again. Now two…" Pavan waggled his hands, "far less coherent and completely naked individuals, with longer hair and far more unkept hair, showing signs of recently giving birth." Pavan held up a hand when Veema opened their mouth to protest, "Doesn't it make sense that the more coherent versions, armed with preparation by the future, went back into the past to care for their children? Our first ancestors. Ensuring the survival of our species."
Every part of him ached. He rubbed his back against the wall. Against a rubber ball. That didn't ease that ache either. He'd forgotten how he used to soak through his pants with vaginal emissions. Wanking didn't work to relieve him. He came. It just didn't help to relieve the ache. He was too hot. He was alone in his quarters. Their quarters.
Sounded like Euros had been a teenager when she'd unleashed her angst on a world of psychics.
Acheron blinked at her. Air howled through the pipe system over her head. Sounding almost like a distant animal's howl. Which given it wasn't logged as an air duct made the hair on the back of her neck prickle.
Ever.
"What if that doesn't happen? Please, John. It's possibly not the right time to decide. Hormones flooding through me, but," Sherlock peppered him with kisses, "just think. Your genetic material will transfer into my body as a result of my bearing your children. You'll be part of me forever. Forever!" Sherlock spun John around until they both toppled to the ground. Sherlock straddled John. "Forever, John, you'll be a part of me." His mad genius grinned. "Let's have babies together."
As the number of cubes increased, there was the obvious answer of breaking things off with an Augment who had a magic cock, but John told himself that hadn't worked in the past and he should just shove that idea out an airlock. Right out.
"Let's go in."
Sarabeth grumbled, but did what Mollyhoo told her to do. Which really, what was love if not putting up with another person's crazy shite, which in this case was not crazy. Other than the part about getting pregnant in the stone age by someone with a magic cock. Magic penis. Whatever.
He reminded himself that John could take care of himself.
The twins nudged each other as they migrated between her and Mr. Shroleb. Like little orbiting moons.
Which was logical and reasonable.
And what did Hudson do? She fucking sat down on the command couch and curled the fuck up there.
"Language," said Mum with a wry look at Harry's glass. "They'll think we raised you in a barn."
Mama G asked slowly, articulating each word, "What is the most important aspect of being a captain?"
Before the conversation could go further in that direction, Billy said, slowly, as if placing heavy stones, "The large Augment population on Beta Augurae, on the planet far away from Earth with its architecture that owes nothing to the Federation, is that where the Khans ended up? That and the descendants they decide have enough level of augmentation to hold onto? And who else? I've seen the images of the cities. Either millions of Augments have been kidnapped or… what is going on?"
John nested with Sherlock. Loved. Felt an odd relief when Sherlock admitted one night, "My scent is wrong. It's… I smell wrong." And broke some very delicate equipment against the wall.
"Son, who is this?" asked his father quietly.
The lieutenant in charge of the supply run, Doctor Helen Noel, hadn't seemed to notice though and had been all for seeing a demonstration of Adam's neural fuck-with-brains device. Seemed kind of obvious that not long after Sally'd sat down, she was suddenly remembering fucking slow dancing with Noel at the medical staff's Winter party. Going back to her room for a slow grind.
Meant grand pappy walked with a metal leg and had an artificial ticker, but it was worth it to live on a self-made world.
It meant Killander was sloppy. It also meant that after the unfortunate decision to recall every Augment in the fleet to starbase that Killander's star was not on the rise within Section 31, or he wouldn't be in this somewhat remote area of space pursing a pet project to prove he hadn't been wrong.
As a reminder, there are 4 Andorian genders.
What he sent Tadpole was more of a dirty drawing that had Tadpole gasping and looking at him in surprise.
Box of possibilities in his lap, heart sore, John was pretty sure he'd made the worst mistake of his life.
Warning: Look at the tags. On scene murder, angst, answer to what exactly happened to Sherlock & Victor.
"Shut up, Cinque Tertius!" said another one of the children. They started to shove and squabble like a murder of crows.
While Sestre kept thinking that if they were able to resolve this situation, his father must recognize that he was getting older. Could handle more complicated experiments than rocks.
John tapped his com. "Hudson, please send down a bio-computer and an electroscope." And briefly brought her up to speed. He had five days. If he could get into the minds of some ancient scientist and figure how they'd fucked themselves over, they’d be fine.
Sherlock brushed the pseudopod down John's neck. He could not scent John. Sherlock had no teeth. He could merely bring hand unit 420 to delicately pinch John's neck over the bite marks in a simulation of a bite. Sherlock had no sperm and no labs with which to create such, even if he wanted to breed John. He was well aware of how John would and had responded to the initiation of successful reproduction in the past.
John was supposed to be reacting to the "unexpected" sensations. He came instead, which hadn't really been the plan, but he went with it like a photon torpedo.
Scenarios that were action adventure with sex at the end were a bit surreal too.
Again.
Billy said, "It was defending its children." Connor was sobbing.
Nom argued that John was sickly and should be eliminated as an example to the others to remain healthy.
Sarabeth lit a candle in one of the clay cups and held it up to see Sherlock's chest.
"And on that note, let me show you my work when I'm not trying to survive in a howling wilderness." They followed Sarabeth deeper into the cave system. She showed them where she had painted a herd of four legged creatures on the rock wall. "I used the contours of the cave wall. As the firelight flickers on it, they look like they're running. I'll never see a vid again, but I can see running animals. Bit of a bitch to paint though." She held up a reed. "I blow the paint through this. Read about it in a book." She wrinkled her nose. "Hopefully, I'm not the originator of the technique."
Until Hudson, who was dithering over which chair to sit in, as if John hadn't made love to his husband on all of them, said, "A very military sentiment, do to try to imagine our Captain not telling Doctor Watson every detail the moment the meeting is over. Probably while coupling with a privacy shield engaged that does nothing for psychic energy." Which shut Donovan up. Not that there was much to discuss at meetings.
