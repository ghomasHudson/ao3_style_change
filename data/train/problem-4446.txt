‘Well, you don’t need to worry about any of that. You're going to live a long life, well, most likely a moderately long life with your diet...’
The reticence on his face was deafening and Dean viewed him in disbelief, his face cracking and softening with the realisation that he should’ve known. He opened his mouth to let out a small exhale.
‘No.’ Cas leant forwards, his forearms pushing into his thighs. ‘You had Sam and I thought, after everything with Billie and Chuck, that you’d want to move on from our…friendship.’
‘It feels pleasurable.’ Cas’s voice was breaking, popping a lump into Dean’s throat that he pushed down. ‘I’ve never experienced this before, it’s truly…very soothing.’
His actions turned slow, wrapping his lips to get the last of the sugar from his fingertips and closing his eyes in a quiet moan to relish the treat. He was seconds away from grabbing a spoon and saying
‘Fine,’ Cas replied with heavy footsteps, stopping at his side and deciding it wasn't worth sharing that it'd been a trap. ‘But nothing new on The Darkness.’
Cas gave him a warm smile and headed towards the door. With eyes lit up like a gemstone, he turned back to face Dean. ‘I’m driving now,’ He said, holding the tape in his hand.
Dean turned to open a bottle of whiskey on the desk, splashing some into two glasses left against the wall. ‘Here,’ he handed him a drink and silently enjoyed seeing Cas in his clothes.
Cas squinted as he revisited memories. 'You said I could use it whenever I needed to, and I needed a recipe, Dean.’
Dean looked at his younger brother, a faint flush of worry in his cheeks before moving cautiously at the angel next to him. ‘Well, tell me.’
‘Dean, I can’t… I will not cause you more pain,’ he said, closing his eyes to be haunted by the night once more.
Placing hands back onto Cas’s shoulder, he was astounded by how much of the angel he could feel. Two additional layers really did cover the guy up. A bit uncertain of his actions, Dean started counting seconds spent on one area before moving to another. Trying to fall into a rhythm and applying compression where he knew he’d enjoyed it as the receiver. He moved to the lower back, driving softly into the muscle. The shirt dragged with his hands and Dean looked at the back of the angel’s head again.
. Okay? We’ve got beer, hot bubbles, I mean – what’s better than this?’ He gave a squeeze then dropped his hand into the water.
Listening to the sounds of Dean sinking further into the seat, every gasp being torn from his body matched the noise of metal rasping from the car as it moved with them. Dean was falling apart as easily as the leaves were shaking off the trees and giving him this gift was truly remarkable. The hunter wrapped his hand around the arm Cas was using to support himself, his cock felt harder than Cas thought possible and he looked deep into those familiar green eyes.
Dean pulled a face, dropping the shirt with a sidelong look to the dark floor. His hands on Cas’ knees.
Cas held him with a stare, pulling the truth out of him like teeth. Dean opened his mouth to let out a witty rebuttal but he didn't have one. ‘… Shut up. What are you even making?’ The angel moved his hands away as Dean dragged the bowl towards him.

Castiel wasn’t sure what was happening or why Dean kept his hand resting on his neck following their hug. It was unusual, they never kept contact for this long. The angel squeezed his eyes together in curiosity, trying to work out the problem. An unfamiliar expression spread across Dean’s face; his breathing shallow, his tongue darted out and wetted his lips whilst his green eyes held Cas’s tightly. The tension felt different too but Cas didn’t know in what way. Then it happened, Castiel closed his eyes the second that Dean pulled him close and took his bottom lip between his own, pressing into the angel’s mouth with a firm and tender kiss. Cas returned the affection like it was the most natural thing in the world until Dean hurriedly pulled away. It was over, the hunter's eyes flickering back and forth processing what had occured.
‘Not being able to help you has always concerned me, Dean, but watching your face when it was me you couldn’t save….’ he trailed off, eyes darting to the floor. ‘It was too much. I thought if I could deal with Kelly and Lucifer that maybe something could change. I needed to put distance there, to protect you from- well, I don’t even know anymore, maybe it was actually to protect myself.’
‘No. Jack isn’t answering and to be honest…’ He paused, collecting his breath whilst he gathered his company line. ‘Cas sacrificed himself for us man, don’t you think we owe it to him to leave him be?’
The three of them stood in the corner of her kitchen, watching the two women shyly sitting together and eyeing each other up as though flicking through old photos. ‘This is quite the Willow Rosenberg situation we’ve got going on, ay?’ Dean heard Charlie suggest to her alt-world counterpart.
Rubbing his eyes and sitting up, Dean asked, ‘That’s it? You woke me up to tell me I need to go to sleep?’
Dean kept his eyes low, swallowing hard. They sat in silence for a few moments before he shrugged, returning his gaze to his brother.
‘A walk?’ Dean raised his eyebrows, that sounded very domestic of them. What next? Family trips to the farmer’s market? ‘Look, Cas, about last night-’
‘Do we? The only difference I see is that I told you the truth… And y’know what?’ He pointed a finger towards the angel. ‘So did you.’
Dean filled his lungs with enough oxygen to spread into his stomach, unable to stop a bitter stare at Cas. His body vibrating with heat, he sneered, letting out the air he was holding in and shaking his head. ‘Screw this.’
‘I thought it best to give you some time to enjoy being with Sam, having your life back, out of Chuck’s playground. I wanted to be here, but it felt wrong.’
Sam sat across from him, Dean watched him frowning as the information was digested. ‘What?’ He finally asked.
the television was on, playing cartoons that warmed the room in bright pinks, forest greens, and golden yellows. The volume low and soft against the walls. Cas followed the light to Dean’s face, his often tired but still beautiful green eyes closed; lips softly breathing a deep sleep. Checking the room, Cas moved closer and sat on the chair next to him. Dean shifted, causing Cas to notice the pink blanket wrapped over his stomach and secured under his arms.
‘Jack?!’ Sam’s warm voice filled the room as he rushed out from behind Dean, embracing the Nephilim.
Sweeping a finger into the bowl, Dean licked all the sugary cookie mixture clean off without any tact. It had a faint taste of cinnamon, and Dean raised his eyebrows at the spice. Dipping back into the bowl to get another taste with an extra finger along for the ride.
‘I don’t know,' Dean swung his legs to the side and sat on the edge of the bed, rubbing a hand down his thigh. 'That’s just how it is for guys like us. It’s the job.’
Cas pulled him closer. He wasn't sure what his future looked like, angel or human, but there was one thing he was certain of. He was going to hold Dean, watch those stupid movies as often as he wanted, wear his cowboy hats, and bone him just as he liked. That was love after all, and he’d learnt that from the pizza man.
They looked at each other. It wasn’t hard to see Dean processing the implications of what Cas was saying, clicking the muscles down his jaw. ‘Cas, no. You only
‘You didn’t have to do this.’ Dean dropped his hand, his forehead tight as he processed the angel's gesture. 'Cas...’
The grey and black plaid grazed his jeans as Dean rubbed a hand over his cheek. His boots echoed down the corridor before stopping in the doorway to the kitchen.
A laugh on his lips, Dean enjoyed hearing him call it that and took the beer off him. ‘No, I thought we’d do it like we used to, remember, Tombstone?’
Cas had seen the hunter’s soul, knew the worry of abandonment that ran inside him, but Dean couldn't know that Cas took him everywhere he went. Needing to put space between himself, his thoughts, and the one he raised from perdition he stood up and walked. Balling a hand against his trenchcoat as he passed through the door frame.
Anchoring him through two songs, Dean rested his chin on Cas’s head. A scent of home came from him, Dean didn’t know what it was, but it was familiar; it was Cas. As the second track ended, he pressed his lips into Cas’s hair, forgetting that the angel didn’t sleep.
Still frozen as time moved around him, Cas replayed it. Tried to find another meaning, one that wasn't so explicit because there had to be one. Dean didn't love him; not in the same way he loved Dean. He took large breaths of panic. Love. The songs were right; the blanket was right. He finally caught back up to the moment but it had gone, watching as Dean stood up.
The hunter slipped himself away, standing up with what felt like a spotlight glaring on him. It was loud and aggressive; he shook his head. ‘I’m some kind of cosmic joke, right?’
from somewhere around them snapped their hands apart, both sitting with new adrenaline replacing the peace in their veins.
The hunter lifted the corner of the bloodied and torn shirt, scrutinising his skin. ‘I’m gonna get you a shirt.’
The angel lay for a few moments, his fingers resting around Dean’s arm, never wanting to let go. ‘Of course, are you?’
There was no denial from Cas, the way his face crinkled and his eyes skimmed the floor told Sam that they both knew how true that was. Regardless, Castiel was loyal to Dean first and foremost, Sam didn't pretend to think otherwise.
‘I prayed to him, Sam. I thought he wasn't getting them down there, but if he’s not in the Empty then he's heard me and ignored every single one.’
Cas opened his mouth as if he had a reply on his tongue, but instead he held his hand into a jet-stream, watching the water dance and divide around his wrist. ‘I’m sorry I’ve not been around, Dean.’ Cas finally said, turning to look at him. ‘After everything that happened with the lance and…’
Castiel remained outside the bunker a few minutes after sending Dean inside, his gaze resting on the ground where the man had been stood. The rain slowly tapped off his lip and he looked towards the door knowing he should follow. Yet, he couldn’t move. Dealing with Dean right now would be thick with regret and that troubled him. Still, he wondered why the hunter would act in a way usually reserved for romantic feelings. Rolling his eyes into the sky, he sighed, exhausted from rationalising. Humans often made mistakes, so did angels, perhaps this was just that.
‘Well, yeah. You, me, sex, Scooby Doo marathons in bed, beer and pie in the fridge for after,’ he put his hand on Cas’ thigh, still naked on the bed sheets and squeezed. ‘What’s better than this?’
The touch between them lingered and Dean felt the first cold air of the angel moving away, he locked his finger around Cas’s and kept hold.
The hunter rolled his hands into fists, squeezing them as he stood behind Cas. He hadn’t given a back rub to anyone in a long time. He puzzled for a second, wondering when the last time was that he’d touched anyone without trying to kill them, or have sex? He pressed a palm into Cas’s upper back, would an angel even be capable of feeling the complexity of touch? Hell, why not find out? How much could he screw it up?
Stretching his lungs to inhale the whole world, Cas gasped as Dean left warm kisses along his cock then rippled his tongue over the tip. He went a few more rounds, flicking the slit and pressing down the length. Cas moaned into the back of his head with every teasing movement and rested a hand between his shoulder blades. The sudden locking of lips around his cock was the second or third surprise, Cas hadn’t kept count, and Dean took him into his mouth.
’Wait,' He left Cas's mouth wanting, 'Is this too…? Y’know. You’re an angel, you’re…you-’ He flustered. ‘We don’t have to…’
The pause was short, Dean didn’t want to waste any additional time not experiencing this. He dived back in, but Cas placed a hand against his chest and gently knocked him back.
The angel reached over and turned on the bedside lamp, pulling himself up and letting his hand run down Dean’s back. Cas didn’t have the necessity of needing sleep but getting to lay with the man he loves in slumber was proving to be one of his favourite pastimes.
The space between them was thinner than usual, driving in Baby as they had done so many times before on a last minute beer run. Or in this case, something a little stronger in a bourbon.
‘He’s skipping out on this one.’ Dean removed the top from a beer only to get a warning hiss as bubbles burst over the neck. He collected them into his mouth then wiped his hand against his jeans. ‘Oh, almost forgot...’
‘I was so angry at you, but I was so damn angry at myself.’ He took another deep inhale, dropping his volume lower.
Cas shuffled, causing Dean to secure those cerulean eyes into the green depths of his own. Dean swallowed under Cas's watch, his tongue sweeping his lips before retreating back into his mouth. He knew not to, but hell, it wasn't the first time he'd entertained what a kiss might taste like.
‘But then: boom! Wings! An angel again. They carry on as before,’ he takes another drink, then rubs the corner of his mouth. ‘The hunter tells himself,
He regarded him squarely. ‘He died because he loved me or he died because I couldn’t stop it. Either way you look, it was my fault.’ Trying to hold back the freight-train of emotion rolling inside, he felt Sam grapple onto his arm.
‘You’ -Dean tracked a long breath into his lungs then raised his eyebrows- ‘you prepped the room? What’s next, candles and massage oils?’
Hesitantly, Dean felt inside the jacket and entwined his fingers around the corners of a cassette tape, pulling it out with fractured movements. ‘It’s just some tunes for when you’re driving.’
‘Of course I am. I’m a little surprised though, I would’ve thought the first thing he’d do was visit you two lumberjacks. Did you not sort out your little spat?’
Dean stood up and tossed the bottle into the sink, it crash-landed into the basin and he manoeuvred to the fridge to get another. ‘I don’t know.’
Dean ate his eggs, soaked up the whiskey, and went for a lay down. Waking up 4 hours later, his first thought took him back to the kiss, how unreal it now felt. He showered, the hot water bouncing off as he soaped up and rubbed his hands down his body, trying to scrub his mind clean. The hell was he thinking? He couldn’t even blame alcohol, he’d been stone cold sober when he’d wrapped his arms around the angel. Sleeping hadn't numbed him to Cas’s reaction either; his face hard and the tone in which he’d said his name.
Looking at the blanket across Dean's lap constricted Cas’ body like a snake, tightening until he felt short of breath. He didn’t need to have seen or spoken to the hunter to know that pressing
‘…Cas...don’t…’ Words so desperate hadn’t meant to slip out and Dean rolled his bottom lip into his mouth as he spaced backwards. ‘Don’t act like everything’s okay, that you’re good when you’re not. I was there, I saw what happened,’ he talked with his hand between them.
In a tangled mess of heat and exhaustion, they fell onto their backs. Dean leaned for the radio, keeping Cas between his legs, and wiping a hand against his sticky hair. With heavy oxygen in his lungs, he ejected the tape and held it out, ‘Here.’
‘I get that it feels weird, I do. And yes, he’s an angel, but so what? You need to see it from the outside. You’re happier when he’s around, it doesn’t matter what we’re doing; you’re always happier and more you when he’s here.’
Dean sat at his laptop, scanning for news reports in case anything needed investigation but so far there was nothing out of the ordinary and he sank lower into his chair, heavy in thought. The truth was, Jack had been AWOL for a couple of weeks now and this bothered Dean. When Jack told them he’d do everything he could to save Cas, Dean had thought pulling a rescue out of the Empty should've been bread and butter for the newly-appointed God but he’d trailed off like the end of a song into silence.
Dean huffed quietly as Cas planted a hand firmly on his shoulder. He expected the angel to heal the injury but instead he started kneading him gently. The perfect amount of pressure scaling down his back, soaking up aches like water into soil. Riding the sensation, Dean’s eyes closed with his brow stunned. As Cas continued treating him like dough, his face gradually softened.
‘Before all this; before the spear.’ He glanced around the room, pulling the words out as carefully as holding the trigger of a gun. ‘Sam showed me. But I kept finding reasons not to give it to you; that maybe what we were doing was nothing unusual and to give you that, well, it would’ve been a step too far.’
Sam turned around to see his brother stood behind them, his denim shirt falling off his arm after a night asleep on the kitchen table, his face rough with stubble and his hair flattened. He watched the two men lock onto each other like attack dogs from opposite side of the room. Each pausing to take the other in, each tensing their body in waves.
‘This probably won’t make sense… but try to listen to what he’s not saying.’ Sam said, the only piece of advice he could offer.
‘Cas.’ Dean looked at him squarely until Cas frowned, shaking the coat off his shoulders. He still had at least two layers of clothing on. ‘...And the jacket.’
'Great, King of Rotten and Touched by an Angel. What a team.' Dean rolled his eyes and laid back down. 'Y'know, you could stay and we'll deal with Crowley tomorrow?'
‘Well, this should help with that.’ Dean pressed into his thighs to stand up and turned towards the bath, rolling his hand around the water to gauge the temperature.
‘Hell yes,’ Dean murmured. His eyes widened and a small breath escaped from his parted lips at seeing Cas stroke himself.
‘Look, man, I get it. Relationships, bonds, whatever; they’re always gonna be used to trap us and trick us, the whole nine yards. But you and me,’ Dean moved his hands between them. ‘...This ain’t new.’
Dean turned to look at him, watching Cas lower until water was striking his stubbled cheeks. He looked so human, and it all felt freakishly normal. As if this was just something they did, which Dean kinda wished it was. He averted his eyes, feeling like a fuse in his brain had blown out as he took another drink quickly, the lines above his nose deepening.
Dean's boots tapped down the hallway on a mission until he reached his bedroom. Without hesitation, he hovered over the mixtape with a pen. Picking up where he'd left off and writing:
‘Dean…’ Cas tried to speak but the words were strangled, pulled deep into his stomach where they couldn’t get out. All he could do was watch as Dean tossed the blanket in front of him, the heels of his boots tapping loudly out into the hallway.
Cas’s voice was faint but Sam was able to make it out. He hovered by the doorway wanting to enter but he sensed doing so would interrupt something fragile. It made him stop in his tracks, he didn’t want his hefty footing to shatter whatever moment was occurring.
The clunking of the bunker door greeted Dean and his feet stopped at an imaginary red light as he saw Castiel walking down the stairs, Jack following.
. His trenchcoat blowing behind despite careful footsteps, hoping Dean would be asleep like he had been every other night.
Cas inhaled deeply, it was more soothing than he’d expected. The soap eased friction, and Dean pursed his lips together with focus as he drew circles into Cas’ shoulder blades with his palms. A small amount of pressure that closed the angel's eyes.
Their noses brushed as Dean tugged at Cas' lips, trying to capture them as he straightened his body to be as flush as their awkward bathtub limbs would allow. He pressed Cas into him, kissing and lingering with intent. Dean always kissed him like they had all the time in the world, even when Cas could taste the neediness on his tongue.
‘Dean, I’m trying to understand but I don’t.' He moved a step closer, allowing Dean to submerge into his feverish gaze. 'I told you exactly how I feel, that I'm happy with simply loving you. But
Cas relaxed, placing his hand on Dean’s shoulder. ‘I didn’t come back here because I thought that’s what you’d want.’
Cas had silently listened to him all the time, watching him intently which made Dean somehow nervous. “Sam can consider himself lucky to have a brother like you.”, he earnestly said with a soft look in his eyes and Dean’s mouth went dry.
Dean just saw Cas again and now he was leaving? Fuck if he let that happen. His feet reacted faster than his mind and ran to him. His hand grabbed Cas‘ arm.
He heard Sam say something to that guy but he was already captivated by the interior.  The house was big. It looked much smaller from the outside than it actually was. The whole place was clad in birch wood and white walls, giving it a sense of free space. The bottom floor was an entire room. Kitchen, dining room and living room all together. Huge windows were on one side of the house, giving away the view to the sea and the terrace. Two couches and a smaller table were spread before the windows. The other half of the room was reserved for eating, Dean could see a big table and a huge kitchen. In the middle of the room, at the wall opposite to him, a staircase led to the upper floor.
From the moment the angel of the lord pulled the righteous man out of hell they were found and changed, hunting and hurting each other until they were lost again. For twelve years they fought against the world and themselves. Then came death and darkness on their shadowed wings, separating them once more. That day in heaven when they met again something set into place like a well-oiled machine. Just like the black car in which the angel and the hunter explored the whole world together in eternity.
„Hello Dean.“, he heard the familiar gruff voice.„I didn‘t expect you so soon.“ Cas‘ face was hard, blank only for the people that didn‘t know him well. But Dean could see how his jawline was set, how his brows were furrowed, his eyes slightly squinted. Panic washed over him. Cas was
“Ah.” Sam gave Dean a bitchface which made Dean break out in laughter. “Dude, I’m just kidding. I mean, they’re your friends, right? They are insane enough to hang out with you, so kudos to them!” - “Dean!” - They kept bickering and talking in Sam’s living room until Dean yawned and decided to call it a night. Sam nodded, also yawning, and stood up. “Good night, Dean.”, he said at the door and Dean, who’d already made himself comfortable on the couch smiled. “Night, Sammy.”
Beware, its a long chapter! I just couldn't stop writing the interactions between our two main protagonists!
Dean’s heart took on a higher beat and he felt fear rising up his throat although he knew they were safe, that this plane wasn’t crashing, that it’s all part of a routine. Yet he couldn’t help but feel uneasy about the fact that he was trapped inside a huge metallic cage a few thousand miles up in the air. So he closed his eyes and tried to breathe slowly. In and out. In and out.
Dean swallowed. „Well – um-“, he started, chuckling nervously. „Vampires, I guess? In the end I got staked. Irony, huh?“, he said awkwardly and glanced at the angel before him. For a while Cas didn‘t say anything. Hurt suddenly flashed over his face before it disappeared beneath the cool mask. „It really was for nothing.“, he muttered and turned around. „Enjoy heaven.“,Castiel said quietly and walked away.
The night, though peaceful, came to an abrupt end as Dean was woken up by loud knocking on the door. “Dean! We gotta get up!”, he heard Sammy’s voice and groaned. Why the hell did they have to get up this early? Grumbling, Dean staggered out of the “bed” and dressed himself, packing up his things. “Coffee, Sammy?”, he called hopefully and the reply came immediately. “Is in the kitchen. Better drink it now, they’re coming any minute!” Groaning Dean made his way to the small counter and poured himself a cup. “Remind me why we need to go at such an early hour?” he called to Sam who was probably braiding his hair in his room or whatever. Oh, that coffee was healing his sleep-deprived soul. "Dean,it's the
These three words echoed in Dean‘s mind. The raspy voice who said them. The hunter swallowed as he drove on. In the days after Cas‘ death he tried to act as normal as possible, avoid Sam‘s worried glances. Only late at night he would drink, he would listen to their mixtape for hours, sitting at the table, running his fingers over the carved name.
(almost wrote pain instead of main, because honestly this is all supernatural is about, am I right?)
„Y‘know. What you said-“, he started but Cas already interrupted him. „You don‘t need to do this.“, he said, a sad and angry look on his face. „No, I need to do this. You need to listen to me, Cas!“, replied Dean. Anger surged through him too. „So don‘t fly away with that feathered ass of yours!“
What a strange name. Charlie stepped forward and grinned at him. “Hey! Nice to meet you! I’m Charlie!”, she said and pointed at the brothers. “The tall one is Sam and the shorter-” - “
blue? Castiel stared at him, face unreadable. And Dean couldn’t tear his eyes away, something about him captivated him. When he heard Sam clearing his throat though, he finally awoke and blinked a little, looking to the ground. Charlie and Jess already entered the house and he could hear them laughing with Gabriel. “Well, Castiel, it’s nice to meet you.”, Sam said, being the more diplomatic one of the two brothers. Dean looked up to see that Castiel only just now tore his gaze from Dean and faced Sam. “Hello, Sam and Dean.”, he said and nodded inside. “Apparently my brother has already made himself comfortable here. I suggest you two better go in and find your rooms before Gabriel makes a mess of them.”, he muttered, frowning. Dean hadn’t said anything yet but now he chuckled. Castiel’s eyes fell on him again and Dean’s words suddenly stumbled in his throat. “Well, that sounds like Gabriel. I mean I have only met him today, but I can imagine he’s gonna leave the whole house in a wreck.”, he said and pat Sam on the back. “C’mon, Sammy, let’s go.”
Within an hour he left the plane with shaky legs and made his way to the baggage carousel. As soon as he picked up his ragged duffle bag which was a gift from his father’s he made his way to the exit, looking out for the familiar figure of his brother. It didn’t take him long. Bless Sammy for his size. A grin broke out in Dean’s face as he walked towards Sam who was still looking around. “Hiya, Sammy!”, he called and watched his brother turn around. As Sammy finally caught sight of his older brother, he started grinning from one cheek to another and it was infectious. Dean felt his grin getting wider as he nearly broke into a run and hugged his little-not-so-little brother tight, feeling his lanky body after so long. Sam returned the hug probably just as tightly and they separated with a laugh. “Dude, did your hair get even longer?”, Dean commented with raised eyebrows as he finally took in the sight of his brother standing in front of him. Sam laughed again and shook his head in disbelief. “It’s good to see you too, Dean”, he replied. “Come on, let’s go home.”
“Come on, Dean!”, he heard Sam shout and wrinkled his nose. “Shut your cakehole, Sammy!”, he retorted and took another step into the cold waves. The wet sand beneath his bare feet felt weird, slimy, muddy and he didn’t like the feeling. After arriving yesterday, the friends decided to swim in the sea once they’d finished breakfast. It would be the first time for Dean and that’s saying something. But he didn’t expect the water to be this cold. The waves splashed around his legs and he shuddered once more. The others were already deep in the water, laughing and shouting. Gabriel was diving beneath the surface and sometimes Dean could hear one of the girls shriek and giggle as Gabriel tickled them sneakily. The beach was empty, since it was the family’s private ground as Gabe had explained to them the night before. So at least Dean didn’t have that many spectators laughing at how he was still struggling to get into the waters. The sun was burning his back and he sighed. After gathering up all the courage he could find, he jumped into the waves.
When Dean woke up, the room was set in darkness. He could hear traffic noises from a little distance as he stretched and stood up. His whole body felt stiff and greasy as he walked towards the light that was shining through the door frame. Damn, he really needed a shower.
Dean didn‘t want to think of it right now. Slowly he walked towards the angel, a few feet of distance parting them. What should he say? Why was Cas here? Why did this all happen?
The road seemed endless, framed by green trees and golden sunlight. There was no noise but wind rustling in the leaves, the smooth whirring of the black shiny car and the music blaring through the windows.
“Hey, Sammy.”, Dean said as he entered the kitchen, where he found his little brother crouched over some books. Sam turned around and smiled at Dean. “Hey. Sleep well?”, he asked, receiving a shrug and yawn. “I gotta shower, man. I’ll be right back.”, Dean replied grimacing. Now he could smell himself too. Which was definitely a sign. Sam snorted and nodded. “Take what you need.”, he replied and then turned back to his books. Dean rolled his eyes but smiled at the sight of his bookworm-brother. He walked to the bathroom and stepped under the shower. The water was pleasantly hot and he sighed in bliss. Now he had some time to think. It was so good to see his little brother again, but he was a bit startled by the fact he was in a completely different country now with strange language, architecture and probably food too. At the thought of food his stomach started to grumble and Dean sighed. Hopefully Sammy didn’t cook up some veggie shit or something. A few minutes, or maybe even more, later he turned off the water and dried himself up.
But Cas‘ face fell. Anger mixed with fury and disappointment flashed all through his eyes within the matter of seconds. „Alright, Dean, I got it. You‘re hurt. Get over it.“, he hissed and yanked his shoulder away from Dean‘s hand. „Is there anything else? Because I would like to get back to help Jack. I hope you like your heaven, Dean, since I figured it got all you needed.“.
When he was alone in the living room again, Dean stared out of the window, watching the empty street beneath him. His mind kept him awake with the jet lag and the upcoming days and when the sun rose up and the streets slowly filled with people,  he didn’t feel tired at all. He decided to look in the kitchen for some coffee. A while later Sam trotted into the kitchen, yawning loudly, probably woken up by the clanking and rustling of Dean searching for that damned coffee. “Jeez, Sam - Where the hell do you have your coffee?!”, he moaned, shutting one of the drawers shut. Sam flinched at the loud noise and groaned, showing Dean where he’d hidden the coffee (exactly in that last cabinet Dean hadn’t peeked in yet!”). Two cups of steaming hot coffee and a breakfast later they decided to head out, so Sammy can play the guide and Dean will tease him for being such a nerd. But actually, he was excited to see the city his brother was living in now.
"Took you long enough!", one of the two ladies called to them with a huge grin on her face. She had bright red curly hair on chin-length and brown eyes, wearing shorts and a top. The other one had long blonde curls and blue-eyes. She looked really pretty, with a cute smile on her round face. "Yeah well, Dean-o here had to finish his coffee!", Gabriel replied and went to the trunk to open it up for them. The brothers dumped their baggage before they walked towards Sam's other friends. The blonde girl immediately hugged Sam, while the redhead waved at Dean. "Hi, I'm Charlie. You must be Dean! Sam has told us a lot about you, but no worries, I won't tell!", She said , winking at Dean. He immediately liked her easy-going attitude and grinned in return. "Ah ,yeah, well. You must have it bad enough to be friends with my brother. If he has your souls or something, I wouldn't be surprised." Charlie laughed and shrugged. Before she could say something, the blonde girl came towards them. "Hi, Dean. It's nice to meet you. I'm Jessica, but you can call me Jess.", she introduced herself with a lovely smile. So that's the girl his brother had a crush on.
„Look, Cas.“, Dean started. „I‘m not good with words, so- um..“ Cas just stood still, waiting for what he had to say. It made him nervous. He felt his heart racing in his chest and tried to grasp the next words in his already scrambled brain.
When they were all ready, the four young people followed Gabriel along a small path that led them out of the forest and onto the dunes. The sight stole Dean’s breath. White beach stretched out as far as he could see. The sea was green-blue and waves crashed to the shore. A strong wind blew into their faces, cooling the heat from the sun. And on top of the dunes, surrounded by a few pine trees there was a house. It was a fairly old one, in white, decorated in a lot of details. He could see a huge terrace with a view at the sea and immediately knew he’ll be sitting on there all day, just watching the waves. “C’mon, kiddos!”, Gabriel called and Dean saw he wasn’t the only one that stopped, watching their surroundings in amazement. A laugh was bubbling in his throat and rose to the surface and he beamed at Sammy as they started walking towards the house.
After defeating Chuck, Jack disappeared, taking all hope with him. There was no possibility to save Cas anymore. Dean knew just the two of them wouldn‘t be able to defeat the Empty, so he tried to continue on with his life. He was glad that he could hide his grief so well. The years have taught him the mastery of charade. Even Sam didn‘t notice a thing and seemingly was happy enough to have his big brother besides him. Blissful ignorance kept him in his sleep, while Dean was screaming inside next door.
Dean swallowed hard as he kept his eyes on the grey road, his mind running in circles. The trees went by in a flash of green and brown. The road seemed endless. The music echoed in his ears and he just drove. How much time had passed? Ten, fifteen minutes? Ten, fifteen years on earth?
. Didn't he know she is way out of his league? Dean grinned at Jess. "Nice to meet you too. Sam's told me a lot about you.", he said with a wink and caught sight of his brother blushing furiously behind Jess.
„You‘re wrong, Cas.“, Dean growled, patience growing thin. „Oh yeah? Well, let me know if you‘re really sure about this!“, Cas snapped, eyes squinting in anger. „I gave you
A few minutes passed and as soon as Dean heard the click of the door he turned around and grinned at the sight. “Okay, that is pretty cool of you.”, he admitted and pointed to the bottle of whiskey Cas held in one of his hands. The other man just smiled mischievously and sat on the bench, putting off his shoes.
Dean Winchester watched the road before him, replaying everything in his life inside his head like one of these blockbusters he‘d always wanted to watch in cinema. The leather on Baby‘s wheel felt soft and comforting as he drove on.
"Hey kiddos! Are you ready to head out? I hope you do have that cake for me!",a male voice called in a volume Dean
The duo left the house as quietly as they could and as they went out to the terrace again, Cas stopped. “Wait, I forgot something.”, he just said and vanished back into the dark house. As soon as Dean was alone he walked towards the railing and put his elbows on it. The salty scent of the sea filled his lungs and cleared his mind a bit. Cas was pretty alright, he thought. Actually, more than that. Before their meeting on the terrace, Dean had thought Cas was some cranky, arrogant guy with a stick in his ass. But the other man had proved him otherwise. He couldn’t really grasp what had happened but something told him he could trust this guy. So far Dean actually liked him the most from the people he’d met here apart from Charlie. He was sort of awkward, but somehow his rusty social skills made him even more bearable. Dean was fed up with people trying to talk around the bush and Cas was refreshingly different.
room?”, he asked in amazement and Cas just shrugged. “Yes, Dean.”, the darkhaired just replied and went to a small cabinet. Next to it stood a huge desk accompanied by shelves lining on the wall. While Cas prepared a drink Dean took the time to look around even more. The wall opposite of the door was completely torn out and replaced with windows. The light from the room was reflected in the glass so he couldn’t exactly see what the view was, but Dean was pretty sure it was the sea. Just like himself, Cas apparently had a fascination with it. The only wall that wasn’t completely covered in shelves (and one wardrobe) was white and and stacked with a few paintings. Dean didn’t care much for art but he noticed a small chain of seashells among it and Dean wondered if Cas made it himself. Right next to Dean a king-sized bed was placed facing the window frame with a small photo frame hanging over it. The whole place was bright and spacey without being too impersonal. There were small things that reminded Dean that a certain man with unnatural blue eyes was living in it. The mess on the desk. The few clothes scattered on the wooden floor. The unmade bed. Small things from the beach. The photo over the bed.
He only noticed as they walked down the stairs to the subway station and then looked around. The air was stale and the lights were dim. He saw a lot of people rushing along as the yellow subway drove into the station. The walls were tiled in a darker orange and graffitis were sprayed on all over the place. Only now he really realized he was in a different country and stopped, trying to take it all in. “Dean, are you okay?”, he heard Sam saying on his right, tearing him out of his paralysis. Dean shook his head and smiled at his brother. “Yeah, dude. I didn’t think Berlin was this full of people though.”, he replied in a light tone. Sam just raised his eyebrows and nodded. “Okay, well.”, he cleared his throat and stepped forward. “It was difficult for me at first, too. I mean, we both haven’t really been in a city this big yet. But you get used to it.”, Sam explained and Dean nodded slowly as he followed his brother down the stairs. Dean was still taking in his surroundings of the strange city as the subway rushed in and startled him. Sam gave him a look and chuckled, stepping in.
A bitter chuckle escaped Dean‘s throat as he thought of motel rooms, fast food dinners, coffee spilled on the seats, weapons clinking in the backseat.
Dean couldn’t help but smile at the unspoken promise. The older Winchester entered his room right away and fell straight into bed, sighing at the feel of the soft mattress beneath him. Within a matter of seconds he fell into a deep sleep, dreaming of stars and waves and the color blue, tinted with pink and orange.
This was enough. Something in Dean snapped and he ran. His feet carried him on the hard road, towards the angel. The angel that was once his and all of his and now none of his. One hand grabbed his arm and yanked him around, the other pulling him closer. There was just a second where Dean saw irritation in his eyes before his lips crashed with Cas. They were dry meeting soft ones. Dean‘s entire mind went blank and all he could hear was his heartbeat. Cas seemed frozen in shock. Suddenly, slowly, Dean felt two hands sneaking around his back, grabbing his shirt. Cas returned the kiss with uncertainty which soon disappeared. His hands went to Cas‘ neck, feeling the short black hair at his fingertips. They kissed for seconds, minutes, what could be years on Earth and Dean didn‘t care. He focused on the feeling of Cas. On the radiating warmth that seemed to erase all the hurt and confusion. It felt as if the bond snapped right into place like a broken bone healed. Softly, slowly he pulled away from Cas and opened his eyes. Blue ones looked at him in confusion and hope and Dean let out a shuddering breath, his heart up in his throat. „Me too.“, he whispered and saw Cas‘ eyes widen in shock. Dean couldn‘t help it. He chuckled quietly. „You know, you need to stop looking like that.“, he muttered, which made Cas frown. „Like what?“, he asked with his raspy voice. „Like that stupid angel who wouldn‘t ever believe that I would let him go away like that!“, Dean replied, smirking. His fingers stroked Cas‘ neck and damn, did it feel good. Well, it did feel a little weird, being so close to Cas, but mostly it felt good. „May I remind you, that you‘re the one who died on a rusty nail?“, Cas replied sarcastically and Dean snorted. „Touche.“ He stepped back, but let his hands rest on Cas‘ shoulders, in case that damn angel would still want to fly away. „We good?“, he asked, worry rising up. Maybe Cas really hated him. Maybe he truly did everything wrong.
heaven for him without even expecting anything in return. How did he ever deserve someone like Cas? The angel in question just glared at him. „Goodbye, Dean.“, he just said and turned around, walking away once more. Why he didn‘t use his wings, Dean couldn‘t comprehend. His mind was racing anyway, full of thoughts, full of things he could possibly say. But should he really say something? He stared blankly at Cas‘ back, slowly moving away, further from him. That hurt. That distance hurt. Knowing, that when he let Cas go now, he would never see him again.
“We’re deeply sorry for coming unannounced.”, Jess started to say and reached out a hand. Now the guy turned and Dean was able to see his face clearly now. He had a strong jawline, messy dark hair and a stubble. And his eyes. They were bright blue, matching the sky. Dean swallowed hard, suddenly feeling goose bumps over his forearms.  The guy looked at Jess and his frown softened. “You are not responsible for my brother’s mistakes.”, he said in that graty voice of his and shook Jess’ hand. “I’m Castiel.”
“Hey, Castiel.”, he greeted him nonchalantly and turned back to the sea, taking another sip of his beer. He’d heard some rustling and Castiel stepped into his view. He raised his head with a raised eyebrow, expecting the other man to just ignore him. But instead he met Castiel’s gaze. His irritatingly blue eyes, now darker due to the dim light of the moon, were looking at him in curiosity. “Hello, Dean.”, the other man replied in his gravelly voice. “I believe we’ve been on the wrong foot.” Castiel’s eyes were still on him and Dean swallowed. Somehow he couldn’t dart his own eyes away from this deep blue. Slowly he nodded, cursing himself for the irritating reaction he had on this strange man. “Yeah, you bet.”, Dean said evenly. Castiel tilted his head with a slight smile. “May I sit?”, he asked and pointed to the empty space on the bench. “Sure, man.”, Dean replied with a shrug, deciding that this night couldn’t get weirder anyway. He released a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding as Castiel sat down beside him. “I want to apologize for my rude behavior.”, he said in a serious tone and looked straight at Dean. There was a slight accent in his voice and Dean wondered what it was. He didn’t really know what to say to that so he just chuckled nervously. “Don’t sweat it, man. I mean, we’re the ones intruding your home, so it should actually be me who’s apologizing. Well, actually, its that stupid brother of yours.”, he replied and mentally kicked himself for blabbering. He saw something like humor flicker in these blue eyes and saw the other man smile slightly. “Actually, yes, I still blame Gabriel for all of it. But that doesn’t excuse my rudeness to all of you.”, Castiel said and looked at the sea. Dean had to suppress a smile. Maybe this guy wasn’t so bad.
Dean‘s hands clenched to fists and he walked towards him. „You really think I haven‘t thought about this at all? You really think that you mean that little to me? Fuck, Cas. Didn‘t you see that-“, he interrupted himself, hurt washing all over him. His heart was hammering hard in his chest while the other was still glaring at him. „What?“, growled Cas. Dean swallowed and his eyes met Cas‘. Green met Blue. Careful, he laid a hand on Cas‘ shoulder and took a deep breath „I never had the opportunity to reply, Cas.“, he said fiercely, angrily. „You said I could let go of that anger and grief and when you died I couldn‘t. Because I needed you to stay, I needed you here!“. Dean hoped this was enough. He was proud of himself for at least saying something.
Dean nodded and made a beeline for the spare room. Gently, he laid Castiel out on the bed and started to remove the blood-stained trench coat, then his shirt. Dean felt his breath pitch, he had never felt so many emotions or feelings at a single time.
Ending the thought, Dean knocked on the door and took a step back waiting for the door to open. Sure enough, within seconds, the door swung open to reveal Sam standing there. “Dean, what are you doing here?”
“Yes, it is Sam… I’m freaking out over here because I don’t want to fuck this up… I don’t know how to do this, man.”
made everything worth it, and then some. Castiel wrapped his fingers around the collar of Dean’s white shirt and pulled him close. “Kiss me, Dean…”
“I was that my I wasn’t concentrating on my tasks. They said that a human had blinded my ability to work. They asked me to choose between you and Heaven.”
choice to choose you over Heaven. I’d do it again a million times over if I had to. The day I raised you from perdition is the day I fell in love with a human. I knew I wouldn’t last long in Heaven when you were down here…”
“Waiting for you..” Dean finished. “Not a day went by in the past week that I didn’t stop thinking about you… I do need you. I’m glad you chose me, and I’m sorry this happened to you. The day you brought me back to life…I looked up at you… your eyes were glowing this… this beautiful blue color and I fell in love with you.”
“Dean,” Castiel said cutting Dean off and stepping closer, with only inches between them. “You still don’t think you deserve anything good in your life? It’s always been you, Dean. So…”
Castiel had found Dean torn to pieces in Hell. There wasn’t one inch of him that was unmarked by the evilness that had consumed hell and all of it. Hell ran on agony, desperation, sadness, and nightmares that the worst of the worst could not handle. It was no place for Dean Winchester, and certainly no place for Castiel, the angel of the lord, angel of Thursday, all blue eyes and sweet innocence. He was sent down to Hell to put find Dean Winchester, put him back together, and pull him out of Hell. After he accomplished this task, he would go back to Heaven and retrieve his next task. There was only one thing stopping him. The green-eyed boy with sun-kissed freckles like constellations in the night sky dotting his face who stood in front of him.
“Yeah. I like your lips too. I like your voice. I like your sense of humor. I like how hard-working and dedicated you are. I like that you never gave up on me, even now.”
“Wait, let me finish,” Dean said, taking a sharp breath but Castiel was quiet allowing Dean to finish. “And, I just realized that I really like seeing you smile… I think this is the first time I have ever seen you smile. I want to spend the rest of my life making you smile because you look really hot when you smile like that. I want to get to know you, Cas, better than I already do. I want to know what it’s like to hold you. I want to know what it would be like to wake up next to you, to smell your scent in the morning. I want to see your face when I make love to you, I want to see you lose yourself and I want to be the one to make you lose yourself. I want to do everything with you, Cas, because I love you.”
Dean had never known love. Does not mean to say that he didn’t love people. There was his little brother he lovingly called Sammy, whom he loved deeply. There was also John and Mary Winchester, Dean’s late parents. Dean had loved them dearly. He had never experienced love in the deepest and most passionate sense. Sure, he had sex, had lots of sex, with different women. Looked at men on occasion too. But he had never bonded with and allowed himself to get to know another person on a more intimate level.
Carefully balancing the flowers in one hand as he climbed the ladder leading to the roof, where pulled himself up onto the roof floor. When he stood up, Dean dusted himself off and looked around. When he finally turned, he saw Castiel standing with his back facing him. Dean felt his breath catch in his throat, the light breeze in the air swept at the back of Cas’s trench coat. He quietly walked a few feet to get closer to him.
Most nights, Dean found himself outside, laying on the hood of his 1967 Chevy Impala staring up at the night sky. Some nights, like tonight, Sam Winchester, Dean’s little brother, would sit with them. Sam would hand Dean a beer, and they would sit quietly staring at the stars in the sky.
Hey y'all! So, kinda been busy with my new Wincest fic but I'm still gonna update this as well. Anyways, I really loved all the mush in this chapter, let me know how y'all liked it.
“They reminded me of your eyes… I really like your eyes,” Dean said, cheeks flushing because when did he start talking sappy like that? He didn’t even do that to the women he slept with. But this was Castiel, and he deserved to hear all these sweet things that constantly flew by in Dean’s mind.
“Course he’s not dumb, Sam… And… you're right… I should man up and go talk to him.” With that thought, Dean thanked his brother and left. Before he got home, Dean had stopped at a convenience store where he grabbed a case of cold beer. Next to the checkout, there was a small display of roses, which Dean eyed with a glare. Dean reached for the flowers, then pulled away, then reached for them again and pulled away. The older woman behind the counter just eyed him, before declaring, “buy the damn flowers. Your girl will thank you for them.” Dean snorted, and contemplated telling her there was no girl, he’d probably put her in an early grave if he told her it was for another man. The thought made him shake his head and smile, before picking out a bouquet of blue roses. “Ah, blue. Lucky girl to receive such a beautiful gift. You know, young man, blue roses symbolize an impossible or unattainable love, but it also signifies hope for a miracle to happen; for new beginnings.” The old lady finished ringing up the beer and flowers, Dean paid and thanked her for the meaning of the flowers, “They symbolize our relationship perfectly. My boyfriend will love them,” Dean said with a smirk as he walked out of the store.
When they broke apart for air, they both smiled, Castiel giggled. Dean pressed a chaste kiss to the corner of Castiel’s mouth before he said, “turn around. Let me bandage you up and then we’ll rest.”
When Dean opened his eyes and looked straight into ocean blue eyes, Dean felt his heart speed up and suddenly he forgot how to breathe.
Since pulling Castiel out of the Empty, Sam had been spending more and more time away with Eileen. Dean never said much about it because they had stopped the end of the world from happening. Things were better, life was calm and quiet and for the first time in Dean’s life, he felt ok, good even.
Sam came running into the room, jaw dropped and confused when he saw Dean with a man cradled in his arms. “De… who is…”
With Dean’s support, Castiel turned over, sighing in relief as the pressure was off of his sore back. Dean held in a gasp of pain as he took in the blood that was dripping down Cas’s back. With a tender hand, Dean gently ran his fingers along Cas’s spine, down to his tailbone. “Wanna tell me what happened?” Dean asked as he began to clean the wounds. Castiel hissed at the combination of the coldness and the stinging.
That night, Dean made his way over to Eileen’s apartment where he knew Sam was also staying. It was a quiet neighborhood, except it seemed as though the entire apartment emptied out all of the kids living there into the middle of the parking lot. Bicycles, skateboards, and scooters lay scattered on sidewalks and in the road. Children were running and playing, laughing, completely carefree and happy. Some of the parents sat on blankets on the grassy area in front of a few apartments. One very young couple leaned into each other, their baby who was only a few months old, laid out on the grass next to them. The sight warmed Dean up, and he couldn’t stop himself from smiling as he thought about his brother. He could picture Sam and Eileen married and having a kid of their own. Hell, maybe one day soon it’ll happen, who knows.
When Sam left, Dean placed his hand back over Castiel’s heart, it wasn’t just beating, it was pounding, and that made Dean’s own heart skip a beat. “Hey, it’s okay. Your safe here. Can you turn over so I can clean your wounds?”
After he had pieced Dean Winchester back together. He had left a mark on Dean’s body, claiming the human as his. When Dean’s eyes first opened in a silent
The very thought made Dean’s stomach clench in a painful manner. And before he could feel the bile rise in his throat, Dean grabbed the blue roses and headed into the Bunker. When Dean stepped into the Bunker he stood in the doorway at the top of the stairs, expecting something to be different but it wasn’t. The lights were still on and it still appeared empty and quiet. Dean made his way down the steps, calling out for Cas. When there was no answer, panic began to engulf his stomach and he felt the bile begin to rise in his throat again. “Cas,” Dean called out again, only he paused when he saw a note laying on the Map table.
On those nights he wondered about his angel, Castiel. The more he thought about the blue-eyed angel, his arm where he found a large handprint engraved into his skin. A mark left by his angel that he had come to cherish. Taking a sip of beer and twisting the black feather Castiel had left him between his thumb and index finger in the other hand. There was no contentment in Dean Winchester’s life. Sure, he was grateful to be alive. To be whole again. To be with his little brother. To share these quiet moments together. But when he woke up and stared up into the glowing blue eyes of Castiel, he realized exactly what had been missing in his life.
Castiel’s suspicion was confirmed when Dean turned his head away and refused to look at him again. “Dean, please look at me.” But still, Dean did not look, so Castiel gently touched Dean’s face and watched as he closed his eyes. The pain was too much, and Castiel couldn’t understand why Dean felt like this… “Open your eyes and look at me,” Castiel demanded, holding Dean’s facing in place so he did not have a choice but to look at Cas.
There he was. After everything, the blue-eyed angel was still standing by his side. Dean couldn’t believe it. How could he? He wasn’t worth any of this, surely not the love and compassion Castiel had shown him.
in Hell, Castiel couldn’t breathe. He was lost in those eyes, and he knew right then and there this was a test of loyalty to God himself. He knew he had been slacking off, and Dean Winchester was the ultimate test of loyalty. He knew God wanted him to fail. God knew that Castiel would fall for this human.
