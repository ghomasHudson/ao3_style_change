Ash laughs, nodding at the both of them. “You got it, Father.”
After about an hour, the men around him call it quits. The fae grins up at every one of them. Dean, busy cleaning more glasses, catches a glimpse of the proud smirk and drops the glass. It shatters at his feet, causing him to curse softly to himself. That kind of smile would scare a coyote. Heat tingles through Dean, enough to almost burn him. Dean swallows and turns away to clean up the shards. Nothing but trouble, these feelings and that fae.
Castiel squints at Dean, but follows the human’s instruction. The bitterness of the flavor strikes Castiel’s tongue first, the warmth filling his chest as he swallows. His secondary feathers flutter and he takes another, longer sip. Dean notices the movement of the wings and smiles as he watches Castiel close his eyes as he drinks.
“I’ve been looking for the one for years, Cas. I don’t expect you to find them in under a week.”
“If that means you’re good in the sack, yeah, Cas. It was fantastic.” Dean chuckles. Castiel’s proud grin makes Dean’s stomach flip. He runs his fingers gently through Cas’s hair, smiling softly. This angel is his. The thought amazes him.
Castiel has been friends with Dean since he moved into the same ratty suburban neighborhood in Lawerence, Kansas. Dean was 7, Castiel older by a couple of months. Castiel first met him when Mary Winchester appeared on the Novak’s porch with a fresh apple pie. Dean stood tall next to his mother, beaming up at her and the pan in her hands. Castiel stared at the boy, then thin with a large smile and too many freckles. Grinning at Castiel, Dean introduced himself by saying, “I helped Mom make the pie! I hope you like apple!”
Benny stops and glances over at Dean. “Everything okay, brother?”
“You bet you have something to tell us,” Jo interjects, arms laden with bowls and a plate of biscuits. “Since when do you talk to angels?”
Lucifer punches Dean, the hilt of the angel blade smacking against his jaw. “You want to know
The air feels thick like honey, a sweet aftertaste every time he breathes. Dean freezes, blinking down at his flour-coated hands.
Dean blinks, finally looking at the boys around him. He smiles quickly to apologize, then opens his sack lunch to grab a bag of chips. “Nope.”
………………………….
“That’s one way to put it,” Gabriel says, standing to put his dirty dishes in the sink. “You aren’t exactly the social type, lil bro.”
Cas looks to Dean for guidance, but the man only shrugs. The cupid lets himself be dragged, pulling his wings tight against his back to keep them from hitting any of the metal equipment. Behind them, Dean shifts on the bench. The new found silence and empty space next to him make him tense. He bounces his leg for a second before standing to go see what the angel and his son are doing.
“Be careful!” Castiel shouts.
+          +          +          +
Dean combs his fingers through the feathers. They feel like velvet on his skin, the touch sending an electric zing through Dean’s arm. Cas lets out a quiet rumble against Dean’s shoulder, wing pressing into the touch. Dean fists his fingers in the feathers after dragging his blunt nails across them. Cas grunts in surprise, hips thrusting up against Dean.
Ben stares at his father for a second, noting the grin on Dean’s face. The boy smiles to himself, glad that Dean had finally found someone who makes him happy again.
Castiel glances at his charge, wings perking up in question. Dean decides the movement is the equivalent of the angel raising an eyebrow.  Dean locks the car, shaking his head.
Dean sighs, hands reaching out to hold on to Cas’s arms. “
The fae leans over the bar, hand wrapped around the neck of his bottle to keep his balance. He squints up at Dean, chewing on his bottom lip for a moment. “James.”
“Damn, Castiel. Back at it again with the white Vans.”
He touched the opposite shoulder. The wrong shoulder. Dean runs his fingers through his hair. Cas always touched the handprint, reminded him of that connection between them. Reminded him that he’s worth saving. Today, he didn’t do that. And he told the hunter that his “attraction” to Amara “could be a good thing.” He suggested Dean use himself as bait, put himself right in the hands of the Darkness, where he has no control.
The park bench is hard underneath his legs, individual bars pressing into his lower back. Screams fill the horizon, a porcelain blue bowl he stares into. Each sound grates on his ears, their laughter high pitched. Lucifer scowls, unsure as to why he decided to come to this simple playground. Squinting at the equipment, he senses that the place is familiar.
Nodding, Balthazar goes back to scrolling through the file. “Indeed. One Dean Winchester of Kansas is ready to put his divorce behind him in search for his true love.”
Dean swallows dryly, shoving the clothes against Castiel’s chest before rushing out of the room. Cas looks down at the bundle of fabric in his arms, then at the door Dean just ran out of. His head tilts unconsciously, eyebrows furrowed. He’d heard his charge’s heart beat. Worry starts to thread its way through his grace. He quickly pulls the shirt Dean gave him over his head. The cotton brushes over his skin in a familiar way, relaxing him as if he just out on a pair of his own pajamas. Dean’s scent clings to the shirt, a mixture of Gain laundry detergent, cedar, cologne and something that can only be labeled as Dean. Castiel presses the collar of the shirt against his nose, trying find a comparison to the smell, but falling short. With a frustrated huff, he changes into Dean’s jeans.
Shaking his head, he holds the container close to his chest and walks out the front door. The sun winks from behind scattered clouds as he looks both ways. He can hear the faint echo of Led Zeppelin coming from Dean’s open window. He grins at the sound, gaining confidence as he crosses the street. He waves at Sam as the younger boy races past on his skateboard.
“Dean, I will find your soulmate,” Castiel says, looking back down at his reflection. “Today is only the first day. There is no reason to stress. I assure you that I was well trained before taking on this position.”
Through the fisheye lens of the peephole, Dean examines the angel’s face. The first thing he notices is that the cupid has his hair fluffed up at different angles, a bed-head look Dean isn’t sure is intentional. He also has scruff along sharp cheekbones, an odd feature on a creature Dean assumed would be clean shaven. It accents the paleness of the angel’s skin and the fullness of his lips. Lips Dean can’t stop staring at.
There’s a shuffling in the living room that yanks Dean’s attention away from his own thoughts. His hand is outstretched, ready to snatch up one of the bottle in front of him, but he freezes in his seat. Cas stands in front of him, still wearing the same suit as before.
Sitting across from the angel, Dean taps the table with his knuckles. “Before you give me the whole spiel about professionalism and what not, I just want to say I am sorry. I explained the situation to Gabriel so you don’t get in trouble. And I understand if you don’t want to be my cupid anymore, I crossed a line.”
………………………………….
Poker Game Notes:
Dean’s eyes widen at the comment and he quickly admits, “I don’t have- I mean… I’m not dating- I’ve been single for a while.”
Someone knocks on his door a few days later.  Castiel’s washing dishes in the small sink of the apartment and bobbing his head to music. At first he didn’t hear it, the sound following the beat of the song he’s listening to. After a couple more measures of the melody, Castiel hears it. A steady crack of curled knuckles against the wooden door. He looks across the room at Lucifer sitting on one of the stools. Both cat and human glance at the door together.
“I don’t know the address off the top of my head,” Dean mumbles as he opens the driver’s side door. Castiel narrows his eyes a little at the weak excuse, but takes the statement as Dean wanting Castiel to stay with him.
Castiel’s hands unfold and the angel places both palms flat on the table. His thumbs trace over the smooth laminate as he goes through his knowledge of his new charge. “Based on the facts you gave on your questionnaire, your past preference in long term partners has been female. However, your vague explanation of the gender of all of your sexual partners reveals that you are also comfortable with someone male.”
Cas supplies, his grace a tiny ball cornered in the back of his own mind.
Dean closes the office door behind him with shaky hands. He turns and leans back against the cool wood, then fist pumps. Castiel reveals himself to his charge, sitting on one of the cushioned arms of a chair on the other side of Dean’s desk. He can’t help but smile as he takes in the human’s happiness. Dean’s cheeks flush when he takes in the genuine grin on Castiel’s face, noting how most of it manifests around the angel’s eyes in laugh lines. Castiel takes it as Dean’s excitement over his success and continues to smile.
“I’ll let you get back to grading all your nerd papers, I’m gonna head home soon.”
Thirty minutes later, he enters the kitchen where Gabriel’s making a cake. The archangel sways his hips, singing along to Boy Problems as he stirs batter. He looks up when he hears Castiel shuffle into the kitchen. His eyes widen as he takes in his brother’s get up.
“If you are interested in finding your soulmate and want to get more information, the website and phone number for Cupid’s Company is located on the bottom of your screen.” Dean stares at the letters. Around him, his apartment is cold and empty. He keeps things neat, almost as if he doesn’t live here. Dean swallows, thinking about how his pillow sits in the middle of his bed despite the fact he still sleeps to the right side. After a second more, he scrambles to open his phone and snap a picture of the screen. The picture is shaky, but all the letters are clear.
As he turns to stardust, a supernova so bright it would wipe out planets, he can hear so many voices. He hears the voices of his brothers and sisters, of Crowley, of Bobby and Ellen and Jo, every human he ever came in contact with. He can hear Sam thanking him, see him smiling. He can hear Dean telling him he loves him, that he’s needed. He hears the voice of His Father.
“Are we not going inside?”
Castiel folds the rest of the underwear before him. The silence throughout his apartment makes him shudder. He strains to hear even the slightest jingle of Dean’s jeans, hands shaking as he pictures the gruff man putting on such a thin garment. He clears his throat and shakes his head, tries to keep the heat from traveling below his waistline. That internal struggle is enough to keep his mind busy as Dean lingers in the bathroom.
that Sam and Dean are the
“I have never had occasion to try it, so why not,” the angel finally says. The small glint in Dean’s eyes makes Castiel’s wings flutter as he looks back down at his menu. Dean notices the happy motion and turns a smile to the waiter. Nathan glances at Castiel with a small frown before looking back at Dean.
At the mention of the human, Cas immediately smiles. He meets Gabriel’s gaze, wings flexing as if to flap excitedly behind him. “All of his potential bonds have started to turn for the worst quickly, but I suspect it is because he as started growing emotionally attached to someone. I just haven’t met them yet. Hopefully, I can broach the subject with Dean’s brother, Sam. If anyone knows Dean, it’s him.”
Castiel nods his understanding and bumps his fist against Ash’s. The awkward moment over, Ash waves at Dean and starts to back away. “Love to stay n chat, amigos, but duty calls.”
“I do not.”
Castiel gasps for air, shaking on top of Dean, who is as equally as shaky. Castiel nuzzles the priest’s chest, smiling when he finds the smell of Dean’s shirt pleasing. Dean stares up at the roof of the car, heart beat settling.
Dean let’s go of Castiel’s wing, heart still pounding in his ears. He pets Castiel’s hair and shoulders, body thrumming. Cas preens under the touch, arching up like a cat as he places a chaste kiss on the hickey he’d left on Dean’s neck. The action is so tender against his sensitive nerves it makes Dean start laughing.
Dean snorts and rolls his eyes as the man continues. “Many prayers being sent upstairs have to do with love. They range from wanting to find a soulmate to wanting to fix a damaged relationship. So we decided to help out with matters of the heart instead of the soul.”
“Where’s Cas, you son of a bitch?” Dean growls, tightening his grip on Lucifer’s throat.
Dean break apart more of his omelet with his fork, stabbing chunks of tomato before taking the bite. His eyes watch Cas with a new appreciation. The angel appears more human in Dean’s mind now.  “What bout Balthazar?”
Blinking at the stranger’s odd choice of language, Dean nods as the stranger stands and goes over to one of the poker tables. Dean takes the moment to look the man up and down. The well-fitted, but dirt scuffed jeans and dusty black boots surprise Dean. Not because the attire was uncommon in Ouroboros, but because it was uncommon to see on a
Dean’s voice addresses the men and women in the room, his hands shaking slightly. The man takes a deep breath as he points to certain aspects of his designs. When he trips over his own words, he stops, then looks to the back corner. His superiors think he’s avoiding their gazes. Instead, he imagines blue eyes watching him. He imagines the small encouraging smile on Castiel’s face. Smiling to himself, Dean turns back to his work and gives the rest of his presentation without a hitch.
Dean shrugs, opening up Google and wiggling his fingers over the keyboard. “So I hover, what else is knew.”
He throws another punch, grabbing Dean’s shirt and hoisting the hunter up off the floor. “He’s
“Lucifer, are you stealing from the laundry mat?”
“To be honest, we kinda started the program due to sheer boredom. Balth and I, we’re retired from the Bible circuit, but unlike most of our brethren, the human life just isn’t thrilling enough.”
Castiel quickly decides that watching Dean cook is one of the more fascinating things he’d ever witnessed. The human moves confidently in the kitchen. He’d changed into a pair of jeans and a black and red flannel, the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. Each cut, each smooth motion of his hands and wrists, makes the muscles flex under his skin. Castiel’s eyes focus on that for a while, amazed at the connection between Dean’s wrist and his individual fingers as they clutch the kitchen knives and spatula.
Cas croons.
Ash snorts and rolls his eyes. His eyes glint as they land on Jo again, a smirk forming on his lips. Jo glares at him for a second before turning back to Dean. “You mean Mom’s apple pie.”
Dean gasps at the words, arching up as much as he can with Castiel on top of him. Seconds later, he comes. The two sit in silence as they catch their breath, Castiel’s forehead leaning against Dean’s shoulder. With a willful thought, their skin is clean and they’re tucked back into their pants. Dean grunts in appreciation, causing Castiel to smile.
Mildred’s words ring in his head, and images of Amara and Cas become a cyclone in his mind. He doesn’t love Amara. He wants her dead. He needs to watch her die to feel clean of the Mark once and for all. But he can’t help but freeze in their connection when she’s near him. It felt like drowning in black, choking on sweetness he can’t place a label on. It made him lost.
“Let’s wait it out,” Dean murmurs. He relaxes his shoulders, weight swaying closer to Castiel. It makes Castiel’s breath ache in his chest.
his grace keens. Dean blinks, his lips twitching into the slightest smile of relief at seeing Cas okay. Cas wants to bury his face in his hands, but doesn’t, too afraid of forgetting his charge’s face. He carefully examines each freckle, each scar on his arms, each shadow of an eyelash on his cheeks, each fleck of gold in his green eyes. Even without control over his body, Cas can still feel Dean’s longing, his relief that they made it through okay.
“I didn’t for a long time. I believed in what I had.” Dean looks at the angel, fiddling with his fork. He doesn’t hold his gaze for longer than a few seconds. The priest takes another bite of his pie to fill in the silence with buttered crust and caramelized apples. The golds on his plate contrasts with the black dress shirt and slacks, makes his face appear even brighter. Castiel takes another drink from his beer, tracing patterns in the condensation to give Dean space.
Dean swallows, then offers Castiel a small smile. “We wait.”
As the two get redressed and go to check on their daughter, a warm feeling rushes through Dean’s limbs. He stares at the two people he loves as much as his brother, unable to hold back his pleased grin.
As they kiss, Castiel takes Dean in hand. Hips buck forward and Dean moans into their kiss, begging for release. While Castiel has little practice, he knows what feels good. As he strokes over Dean’s dick, thumb teasing the slit to spread precome across their skin, Dean breaks their kiss to breathe. Castiel smiles as the hunter pants against his lips.
In the soft after silence of a productive phone call, Dean Winchester sits back in his office chair. He swivels it around, arms behind his head as he smiles at the view of downtown. Car lights blink off the asphalt and glass windows, sparkling in Dean’s eyes. It’s 4:30 in the afternoon, meaning rush hour traffic gives him an excuse to remain in his office until 6. Zachariah would be pleased to see that he’s logging more hours anyway. Dean can imagine the man’s bird like face pinched forward in that sleazy smile as he slides a white slip of paper across his desk. Dean’s so close to this promotion he can taste it. He sighs, turning back to his desk to begin sorting through his emails.
Dean smiles a little, glancing back at Castiel. Castiel watches the human carefully, noting the bitter green and happy yellow twisting through Dean's soul. “Her and Sam were the first people I came out to. Her and Sam were there for me when I came home from Iraq and started drinking. They were there when Lisa handed me the divorce papers. They pulled me back from that edge countless times.”
Lucifer laughs, his whole body shaking with it as he tilts his head back. Memories of every time Cas touched his charge- each shared moment very vivid in the angel’s mind- appears in their mind. Lucifer continues to laugh, holding his stomach and shaking his head.
Breathing deep through his nose, Dean takes another couple swigs of his drink. Castiel scans Dean’s profile, still amazed at the beauty of his charge.
Before he even provides an answer, Balthazar and Gabriel enter. The two angels frown as Castiel wraps his wings around himself to make a shroud of blue and black. Balthazar sits on the bed next to Castiel, Gabriel at his feet. They say nothing at first, just let their graces call to Castiel’s. Both his brother and best friend are colored with yellow anxiety. It’s almost nauseating.
“How comforting,” Dean retorts, smiling slightly at his computer when he gets the 8 ball in. This is nothing like the real thing, but it vaguely reminds him of his younger days. He bristles a little at the thought of even having “younger days”, but the past 9 years had been enough to diminish the cocky attitude he’d had since he was in diapers.
Sighs of relief litter the air as the men start to reshuffle their cards. Bobby rolls his eyes, a gesture only Dean sees but is sure Ellen could sense as she crosses the small distance to them. She pats Bobby on the shoulder, ducking underneath his hat to kiss his bearded cheek. “Oh, don’t worry, Bobby. I’m usin the winnin’s to pay for the liquor.”
Gabriel’s wings flutter up, feathers rustling like leaves on a tree. His eyes flash with the blue tint of his grace at the memory. The archangel stares at the empty space beside Castiel, hands still holding the dish rag. “I didn’t so much as see it, but taste it. Like chocolate and sea salt caramel. The client’s relationship was smooth, sweet. Our second client, Balthazar handled. He said that it looked like a rose bush grew around the souls.”
Castiel’s fond smile returns. “We grew up together. We’re from the same garrison, created at the same time. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember.”
The cupid raises an eyebrow, his wings arching up above his head. His primary feathers spread, tracing over Dean’s sweatpants. The touch sends pinpricks of heat through him and he grins at the human still in his embrace. “Oh?”
Castiel nods, still laughing. “Sounds good.”
“’ight, Cas,” Dean replies, face slack as he drifts to sleep. Castiel turns his hand over, lightly gripping the hunter’s as he closes his eyes.
“Congratulations, Dean. I’m glad that your superiors enjoyed your designs well enough to consider them for a future model.”
Dean furrows his eyebrows, realizing that Castiel just admitted that his employers are his brother and best friend. It doesn’t seem strange to Dean, having worked for both Bobby and Ellen growing up. Pays the bills. But it does surprise him that Castiel has a friend who seems more socially ept. He absently grabs the door into the building, holding it open for the angel. Castiel stops at the threshold and looks at Dean. He holds out the coffee for the man to take.
When Cas pulls back, he licks his lips. He reaches over and swipes up some of the pie filling on his index finger. He sucks the tip of his finger into his mouth, eyes on Dean as he does so.
Dean gulps, rubbing his palms on his jeans. Him, Dean Winchester, womanizer, afraid of asking out a cute boy? No. That’s not his way. He’s not a Losechester. He’s a Winchester. And Winchester’s have the guts to put themselves on the line.
“You okay, buddy? Ya look tipsy.”
Dean’s ears turn hot as he looks at the space between Sam and Jo’s shoulders. “He was just gonna sit around by himself all day. He’s been worried bout the search, blaming himself for not finding someone yet. I didn’t want him stewing in all that shit.”
Dean raises his hands in surrender, afraid that touching the angel will cause a panic. “Yes. I accidentally walked in on you. But Cas, that don’t change what I feel. I do wanna make ya feel good. And from what I heard, you want me to.”
Cas kneels before the hunter, his grace chaining Lucifer down in the back of his mind. His brother screams, claws at his grace to get free. The power radiating from the angel isn’t enough to smite the archangel, but is enough to hold him at bay.
It’s common for Balthazar to reach out and straighten out some feathers on his wings, or for Gabriel to attempt to placate his stubborn curls. Both of the angels are close with Castiel, their intimacy something that Castiel doesn’t often notice, he’s so used to it. Yet with Dean, there isn’t a closeness brewed by time together. It’s this instant connection. Castiel figures that this desire to be more intimate with Dean stems from his celestial nature, the need to aid and protect humanity as God intended. Dean is his first official charge. He never had the chance to actually experience the charge-angel relationship, and now he finds it confusing as well as enthralling.
After hanging up, Dean starts closing all the tabs on his computer so he can log out. Upon closing the game, his screen fills with a pulsing pink ad. Dean’s about to close it when his eyes trace over the wide letters. "No time to find the perfect date? Feeling like something more is missing? Look no further than Cupid’s Company."
“It’s Sam. And yeah, I’m in the middle of grading papers for your information. Some of us have jobs that go past 5 o’clock.”
Castiel grins back and nods, watching her walk away and carry the tray with ease. Scanning the room, he finds an open seat at the bar. He crosses the room, vessel buzzing from the noise and energy around him. The Roadhouse isn’t brightly lit, over hanging lights casting a warm glow over the dark wooden tables. The walls didn’t seem brown or red, but an odd combination of both, absorbing and reflecting the light. Pictures and posters cover the walls with personal stories and other histories Castiel finds himself extremely curious about. He straddles the bar stool, resting his elbows against the worn bar and sighing happily.
“Hello to you too, Dean.”
Gaze shifting back and forth between Balthazar and Gabriel, Castiel’s wings droop in defeat. He can’t ignore them, not just because they are his brother and best friend, but because they are his employers. He stands straight, ready to take on the assignment. Finding a human his or her soulmate is rewarding, something his brethren often spoke about. He’ll now have the chance to experience that awe for himself. “When do I depart?”
This goes on for a week. Dean looks Castiel over, taking note of his new outfit. Castiel blushes and smiles. Dean says his catch phrase, occasionally throwing in a wink for good measure. And Dean’s friends hound him about it.
This time, Dean really does roll his eyes. He opens his mouth to explain the reference, then decides better of it. “Forget it. Just tell me what you’re thinking.”
The cool air makes Castiel shiver, skin drying. He pushes his hand up Dean’s shirt, spreading his fingers across Dean’s warm abdomen. The man beneath him leans forward, kissing the top of Castiel’s head.
Castiel nods, panting against Dean’s neck as he rocks against Dean’s hips. He stops the movements, but doesn’t want to let go of Dean’s hand. So he uses his grace, lets it slide over Dean’s jeans and his slacks. He opens both their pants, using his grace to pull both of their dicks out. He hisses as the chilly air touches his heated skin. He doesn’t feel the discomfort for too long though. He’s too focused on licking his palm, wetting it enough before embracing both his and Dean’s dicks in his hand. The initial caress drags a surprised moan from him, and then a huff of a laugh.
The angel finally looks up from the wall, blue eyes wide and wondering. Dean wipes away a stray droplet of water tracking down Castiel’s temple. Castiel leans into the touch, eyes still stuck on Dean. “I want more than to just make you happy.”
“Course, Lis,” Dean says, looking back at Cas. The angel nods at his charge and Dean closes the door behind them.
Lucifer tilts his head, meowing a few more times before going down the short hallway to the living room. Castiel watches him go, running a hand through his wet curls. He has a paper to write for his Gender Construction in Literature class, a Spanish review sheet to look over and an article to write for the university’s paper. Sighing, he pushes off the doorframe to go back to his room and notices the dark fabric on the floor again.
Thank you for choosing Cupid’s Company,
Castiel meets Dean’s gaze despite the color on his cheeks, his stance still professional. Dean tries to mimic this behavior, clearing his throat. “Sorry, if I made ya uncomfortable. Last time I saw an angel, I was dying.”
And like he always does, Sam immediately gets it. He cuts through everything Dean says, points out the things Dean never notices.
Dean scans the crowd of people around, raising an eyebrow at a few girls he’d be interested in approaching. He’s surprised to find there are a couple men he looks twice at. Looking back to Jo, he pats the bar. “I’m gonna take it easy tonight. Not as young as I used to be and I don’t wanna fall asleep too early.”
Castiel tilts his head, eyebrows furrowed and eyes squinting. “I do not understand.”
I touched? You’re just as bad as he is.”
Both men stare at the leather couch, then at each other. After a moment of uncertainty, Dean pushes Castiel onto the couch by steering his shoulders. The sharp zipper of his jeans press into his skin as he moves. He quickly kicks off his boots and pants, cheeks flushed when he ntoices Castiel watching him. He then straddles Castiel’s lap, wrapping his arms around his neck to pull him in for a kiss. The warm press of Dean’s lips warms Castiel all the way to his toes. Not the kind to go out much, Castiel always wondered if he’d find a guy at college. And now a man is giggling and trembling and excited on his lap.
Ready to swing, Dean takes another step closer. “Who the fuck are you?”
Green eyes waver as they watch the angel. Dean scoffs, looking at the empty space behind the bar. “Yeah, okay. It’s not like I wanted the job to begin with…”
Awkwardness makes Dean’s throat thick and he frowns at the empty table space in front of the angel. After swallowing, Dean finally forces himself to look at Castiel’s face again.
When Castiel doesn’t respond to the statement, just squints at his charge as he tries to figure out the meaning behind the words, Dean flushes. He clears his throat.
Gabriel snorts. “Ya sound like a Disney movie trailer, ya know that?”
Again, Dean shakes his head so fast he feels his brain shift inside his skull. “No, no. That’s okay. I just thought you’d be… cuter, I suppose.”
As Dean stutters around his words, Cas slowly walks them closer to the wall. The angel leans their combined weight against it, grinning at Dean’s wide eyes. Cas moves his hands to Dean’s hips, squeezing them as he kisses along Dean’s jaw. He licks his lips and whispers in Dean’s ear. “Why would I shy away from you, Dean?”
Drinks in hand, they all look around at each other. Bobby clears his throat when Ellen looks pointedly at him, causing Jo, Sam and Dean to smile.
Gabriel dries the dishes and puts them away, wings flapping slightly as he stands on his tip toes. Castiel stares into space as he contemplates what his brother said. With a decisive nod, Castiel stands. “I’m going to go to bed. I will probably be gone before you wake up. Dean goes to work very early.”
vibrates with the thrum of an engine. The smell of leather winds it’s way through his grace as the pounding of wind fill his ears. Like flint against steel, the connection sparks a never ending series of memories neither Cas or Dean has lived yet. Images of them kissing, holding hands, watching movies, walking with Ben, cooking together, sleeping together, rain down on Castiel’s grace like a waterfall.
The angel squints his eyes at the question. Dean provided all of the information on the forms, so he already knows what Castiel does. “You are asking what I have deduced, correct?”
Taking it in his hand, he holds it out to Dean. The man as he says, “Thanks.”
“I’m sorry, Dean! I came to see if you were still awake and became curious.”
This is crazy, ridiculous even. He’s capable of finding love on his own, without having to dish out 4,000 dollars to take the easy road. Dean never took the easy road. He cut his way through all obstacles and always came out on the other side. Sam always complained about his resolve, but this is different. He’s putting his faith in something that isn’t even human, something that can kill him faster than a single heart beat.
“Yes. Dean invited me out for dinner.”
Sitting in the passenger seat, Castiel carefully tucks his wings tight against his back. He examines at the smooth lines of the interior as Dean starts the car. Dean caresses the dashboard, smile growing even more fond.
The simple word weighs heavy on Dean’s ears, a challenge in Castiel’s eyes. Dean swallows, unable to look away from Castiel’s gaze. “Yeah, you just… seem shy.”
Shooting back the fifth and sixth shots, the fae grunts at the burn. He watches Dean’s forearms move over the polished cedar. “She sounds wise.”
Dean stares at the door, the wood the only thing separating him from the scarred grace and beauty Dean loves. His knuckles raise and rap against the wood.
Castiel kneels on the floor, legs angled behind him. The rest of the underwear on the floor is folded before the man. Dean is about to say thank you when he notices more of the scene. Castiel clutches a pair of briefs in his fist, knuckles white. His eyes are closed. Not crunched up tight, but lightly closed as he tries to focus. Dean’s mouth goes dry again and he clears his throat. “You okay, buddy?”
Dean glances over his shoulder, smirking. “Like what ya see?”
Dean looks Castiel up and down, smiling, and says, “Damn, Castiel.”
He’s wearing his favorite pair of jeans with a soft t-shirt and dark red flannel, and he feels confident as he enters the bar. The sounds of pool balls cracking against each other and classic rock fill his ears. The air smells of grease and beer and sweat. The lights are dim, giving the room a warm feel. Jo smiles at him as he walks up to the bar. Straddling the seat, he grins back.
“I dunno, it’s raining pretty hard. We could wait it out.”
Balthazar and Gabriel look at each other. The archangel wants to smile, amazed that someone loves his little brother like he does. Gabriel had already brought the topic up with Balthazar, both wondering when Castiel would realize what was happening. Gabe squeezes his brother’s knee.
“My turn,” she says smugly as she rests her cheek against Sam’s chest. “It is really good to see ya, Sam. You’ve been away from home too long.”
Castiel nods, glad that they will be able to get back to the search soon. “I do apologize that it has taken this long, Dean.”
With his brother standing over him, asking for his last words, Castiel stares straight into his eyes. He sees the pain, the hatred, and he doesn’t flinch away. He asks
“I found it,” Castiel murmurs, stroking his thumb over Dean’s throat.
………………………………
“I will, Ellen. Promise.”
“Ya want a bite to eat? Benny ’n I are scrapin together some pies. Cherry’ll go great with the whiskey. On the house.”
Castiel swallows and shakes his head. “Dean, this isn’t necessary. Please don’t feel as if--”
Dean puts the plate on the the table top of the high chair, using a soft sided spoon to scoop up some of the cherry preserves. He wiggles his eyebrows at Creedance, taking the first taste of his homemade pie. “Mmm, s good. I dunno if you’ll like it.”
Just as Dean is about to break the odd tension between them, there’s a loud knock. The three have a chance to step back before the door opens again and a large man walks in. The man immediately smiles upon seeing Dean in the hall, and the two men embrace tightly. Dean strokes the back of Sam’s head, not letting go for a couple more seconds.
Her words shake his core, cause an earthquake in his grace. The aftermath burns in his chest, makes it hard for him to look at Dean when he stands before him. She didn’t just burn words onto his skin, she burned his every mistake back into his heart. She crushed him with his own humanity.
The days leading up to Thanksgiving go by as fast as Dean expects them too. He dropped Ben off at the house he used to live in, recalling the days when looking at the red wooden door made his stomach twist. That Sunday, he patiently waited on the other side of it until Lisa’s new boyfriend opens the door. Dean smiled at the guy, shook his hand, told him to take good care of Lisa and Ben. Then he went home. He didn’t feel the same dread he’d felt a week earlier when thinking about the guy. Instead, he felt excited to be heading back home.
Dean simply nods, watching as the angel before him disappears. Taking a deep breath, Dean goes through the door, skin prickling as he thinks about Castiel following close behind him.
“Do you understand now?”
Castiel tries to ignore the small leap his heart gives at Dean’s action, smiling at his charge instead. “I would love to.”
But things are different now. He’s 37, a bachelor, a father, and a car designer. The new life has it’s perks, one of them being able to fall asleep to the soft moans coming from his flat screen.
“Bedroom?”
Dean leans on his elbows on the bar, watching Bobby for a moment. The determination settled in the man’s eyebrows comfort Dean with its familiarity. It’s a distrust, a survival instinct, that still pulses through him even under his initial attraction.
Dean presses his face into Castiel’s shoulder, inhaling deep to stay calm. A single tear is absorbed into Castiel’s shirt collar as Dean whispers, “Thanks, man…”
Castiel stares at the vehicle in front of him, the corners of his mouth turned down slightly. Humans’ love for motor vehicles always confused him. Dean unlocks the driver’s side door of the Impala, sliding into the front seat with a smile. The leather is warm against his back, the seat solid underneath his weight. He leans over and unlocks the passenger side door, sharing his grin with the angel.
Castiel tilts his head, but nods. Dean shrugs and leans back against the booth. He takes in the diner around him, sighing as his sadness fades. He lets the joy of his success fill him instead. He’s moving up in the company and Castiel is going to find his soulmate. He won’t be alone anymore and still be doing what he loves. It’s a win-win.
The shorter angel grins at the camera in response. “We hope you do.”
God almighty, help me for I am about to sin…
He takes a deep breath, standing and brushing Castiel’s hands on his pants. He stares at all the humans in the park, at the trees and bushes, and nods. He lets the anger fill him again, blanketing all of his wounds. With a deep breath, a plan forms in their mind.
“Welcome to the Roadhouse!” she says, stopping briefly behind the hostess booth to pick up some more menus. “Take a seat wherever you can find one. Your waiter will be ‘round with a menu.”
Dean’s rolls his head to look at Castiel, body slumped over the seat. The dulling security light Bobby left on at night makes Castiel’s features glow. It’s like looking one of those old photographs of a sunset. Dean’s heart pounds in his ears.
“Makes sense to me,” he mutters and pushes past Casitel. He doesn’t have to turn around to know that the angel is invisible and following him out of the office. He adjusts his laptop bag on his shoulder, trying to ignore the cold spot making a home in his chest.
Castiel’s lips stretch in the cutest way when he smiles. A little curl of his lip that Dean notices now that he’s fixed on the man’s mouth. He also has a little stubble that shapes the sharp curves of his jawline. Biting the corner of his lip, Dean looks away.
Castiel stares at Dean as the man looks away from him. He can sense Dean’s anxiety, the dark yellow swirl in the man’s soul. He nods, watching the color fade. “As you wish.”
The excitement originally coursing through Dean’s veins freezes as he looks at Castiel. The blood leaves his face and his vision blurs for a second. He reaches out to touch Castiel’s shoulder, but lets it fall back into his lap.
“I’ll remember that,” James says as he lets go of Dean’s hand. He clumsily grabs for his wallet, taking out the bills to pay off his tab.
Shrugging and smiling, Gabriel pulls back into himself. “Well, you have fun. Eat lots of pie for me.”
Castiel’s secondary flight feathers shiver when Dean tells him he can keep the clothes for now. Every time he moved, Cas could smell Dean on the fabric. It still catches him off guard, making his grace swirl into a tight coil inside his chest. He stares at his charge for a second, some his earlier anxiety weighing on his wings. “I’m going to assume you do not wish to continue our search while your son is present, so I can resume my duties when you next see fit.”
The man’s grin falters, his eyebrows furrowing in a way that accents the peak of his hair line. “No offense man, your coat just caught my eye.”
Dean keeps such realizations from his family and friends. Bobby’s warning darkens his thoughts every time he sees his reflection, every time he sees his brother sneak out in the middle of the night. John’s bloodshot eyes haunt the back of his mind, glossy with fairy drink. He knows he shouldn’t eagerly anticipate the fae’s arrival every week. He can’t help the way his blood thrums in his ears as soon as he hears the church bells ring.
at poker. The fae sits, hat tossed aside and legs spread wide under the table. Dean swallows. Those eyes scan everyone at the table, then lazily looks down at his cards. Between shots, the man smokes a cigar, glaring at the other men through the smoke. Dean swears his eyes sparkle like gemstones. Every turn of the cards, the fae licks his lips. Lips Dean desperately tries to not describe in his own mind.
“Let’s go get lunch,” Dean says, holding his hand out at the door.
Lucifer lands a punch, smirking at the blood on Dean’s face, at his mortality. He pays little attention to his brother, focusing solely on the last thing between him and his true vessel.
“He kissed me,” Castiel whispers, still staring at his knees. Admitting to what happened makes Castiel’s heart skip a beat again. Shivering, Cas pulls his wings further around himself to hide his face.
Dean stops clicking his mouse and closes his eyes. An unsettling feeling, almost like a small stone in his gut, fills him. “Lisa made plans to take him to the movies.”
Puffing his chest out in pride, Dean nods. “Yeah she does. Just like her Daddy.”
The man raises an eyebrow when the angel begins to shimmy out of his coat. The new formation of his features accents his freckles. Castiel finds himself silently counting them as he pulls his arms from the sleeves, tilting his head as he squints and leans forward. Snorting, the man shakes his head and grins again.
Dean hums. The sound rumbles between them like the impala’s tires on the highway. It’s a sure sound, one of comfort. Dean presses closer when Castiel teleports them to his bedroom. His eyes droop as he whispers before falling asleep, “You always do.”
Ellen saunters down the hall with a flour-stained apron wrapped around her chest. Thick hair pulled back into a high ponytail, she’s the picture of motherhood to Castiel. He stands stiffly next to Dean when the woman stops in front of them, hands on her hips.
Ouroboros is a town of simple routines. The workings of every piece hold up the delicate balance between the humans and their supernatural neighbors. With every second that passes, Dean misses another piece of his new weekly routine. His heart hammers even harder with each footstep he hears. Benny glances up at him again, noticing the odd behavior but deciding to not say anything. Dean forces his breathing to slow, pretending that his lungs aren’t gasping for air. He closes his eyes, admonishing himself for allowing his body to fall into the spell so quickly.
Nuzzling the crook of Dean’s neck, he pulls the waist band up and take’s Dean’s dick in his fist. He moves quickly, running his thumb over the head and earning a shaky moan in response. Dean arches up off the couch, breath hitching when Castiel twists his wrist on an upstroke. His lips move as if to say something, but he doesn’t have the air to say it. The muscles in his chest and legs spasm, his eyes clench closed, his grip on Castiel's hair and shirt tighten. With that tight moment of silence, Dean comes. His body falls back against the leather, his bare legs sticking to it as his skin cools. Castiel kisses his neck before pulling back. He smiles down at Dean’s blissful expression and shakes his head. Dean raises an eyebrow at the man. “Somethin funny?”
“That makes things… complicated,” Castiel murmurs, anxiety making his limbs twitch.
Gabriel turns the water off, drying his hands when he faces his brother. “I was the angel in charge of our first client, you know that.”
Dean grunts, face still covered. He relaxes slightly under Castiel’s gentle touch, taking a deep breath to ground himself. “You sound like one of those motivational cat posters.”
“We understand that, Cassie,” Balthazar says, trying to hold back a smile. This would be good for the angel. “We simply think that you are the best angel for our latest customer.”
Ellen pats Castiel’s shoulder in a manner similar to Dean. “No need to thank me, honey. Any friend of Dean’s is a friend of ours.”
“In high school, I had my shit together. I worked as a training mechanic for a family friend. I was dating the most beautiful girl in the school, was probably gonna marry her. I knew where my life was heading...”
“No, I do not know,” Castiel replies. “Humans’ relationships with inanimate objects seem completely unnecessary.”
He reads the lips who breathed life back into him, “I want you, Dean. Please.”
Dean nods, pulling out another glass and holding it out. His hand trembles slightly as the neck of the bottle clinks against the lip. Their eyes meet for a moment, and Dean swears the color pulses with brightness. “Thanks,” he says softly before sipping at the liquid. He groans and lifts the glass to look at it. “Shit’s better than I even expected.”
Just as Castiel is about to leave, Dean starts to laugh. The sound rolls like waves, clear as it fills the car. Castiel shakes with the force of it, and he stares at the priest. Dean wipes his eyes with the back of his hands, shaking his head as he meets the angel’s gaze. Dean kisses Castiel’s forehead. “We’re like one of those lame jokes.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean calls out, leaning out from his bedroom window. He grins down at his friend, eyes bright.
Lucifer rolls Cas’s shoulders, eyes soft when he meets Dean’s gaze again. Dean stares at the angel with his eyebrows furrowed. Cas bites his lip as Lucifer touches Dean’s shoulder, squeezing the muscle slightly. Not tight enough to be possessive, just enough to provide comfort. Just like Cas would.
Lucifer backs away from the hunter, looking away from the green gaze. Cas still watches him in their peripheral, gasping when Dean grabs his throat. Swinging them around, Dean slams Lucifer against a nearby table. His teeth are bared as he presses his weight on his arm, elbowing Lucifer’s ribcage. Lucifer gasps aloud, and Cas grins in their head.
He exits the website, then leans back. He stares at the ceiling when his phone buzzes with an email notification.
fae stirs something inside Dean. That ancient connection between the soul and magic, the stuff that makes the stars and hurricanes. In the past month, Dean finds himself dreaming of blue, wrapped in its cool comfort as if he’s drifting on the surface of a lake. Whenever a nightmare hangs too close to his chest, ribs tight, the memory of those eyes and the fae’s subtle smile smooth him.
Dean slows his steady eating towards the end of Castiel’s short speech. The adoration in Castiel’s voice makes Dean itch to call Sam. Dean offers the angel a knowing smile. “He sounds great.”
When there’s a soft knock on his door, Dean lets out a relieved sigh. He yanks the door open to reveal Castiel, wearing the same pink uniform and tan trench coat. Dean laughs, some tension leaking out of him.
As he gets into the Impala’s front seat, he has a sated grin on his face. Dean’s turned the heat on, thawing out the cold touch of leather under them. The radio fills the cab with a static rendition of Led Zeppelin’s The Rain Song. Castiel looks out at the half moon sitting in a nest of stars and smiles. He relaxes against the seat, grace humming in his throat.
His job is simple really. Pitch ideas to the big boys, follow orders, act civil at parties, don’t flirt with co-workers. Dean had always been good at rules, even if he seemed like the type of person who preferred to break them. And occasionally he did, throwing in a couple of winks at some of the receptionists for good measure. Beyond that, he tried to stay on his bosses’ good sides. It had done him well since his discharge from the Marines, and he soon found himself as one of the top designers in the company.
Closing his eyes does little to erase the image from Dean’s mind. Instead, it becomes more vivid. How the water glitters because Castiel only turned on half the lights, how the shadow of his wings shivers with each wave of pleasure, the shine of his parted lips, the strength of those flexed knuckles as Castiel strokes himself. Dean bites his lip and thumps his head against the concrete wall. He knows he should leave, imagines himself hurrying back to his own bedroom to spend the first part of his night unspooling every lovely thought about his angel as he takes himself to orgasm. But something locks him into the spot. The middle of a jerk off session is not the time to announce his feelings for the angel, hardly the romantic scene he’d daydreamed about on the long drives between hunts. Dean nods to himself, resolving himself to tell Castiel tomorrow. To tell him how much he wants to be woken up by Castiel’s cold feet touching his under the covers, how much he wants to see that nest of black hair in the morning, how much he wants to hold hands with an angel that’s fought off Heaven and survived, how much he wants to press Castiel against that shower wall and kiss every daydream into his skin. Dean shudders, pushing away from the bathroom when a loud whine leaks through the door. A longing call of his name.
“Novak isn’t wearing his usual outfit,” Crowley says, looking away again.
Dean doesn’t move away or point out the lack of space between them. Instead, he licks his lips and gestures to the uneaten pie on Castiel’s plate. He whispers, “You gonna eat that?”
“Castiel, what happened between you two?” Balthazar asks. “We're asking as your friends, not your employers. Please.”
“So when you find my soul mate?”
“Thank you. For… this. I needed it. I know ya didn’t have to serve me, yet you do. It’s much appreciated,” the fae says, words soft and slurring. It reminds Dean of an early morning breeze. He shrugs and looks around the bar to avoid locking gazes again. There’s a distinct pause when the fae stops talking. Despite the familiarity of their routine, honorifics are missing from their conversation.
After a couple more seconds of tense staring, Castiel blinks and nods. He ruffles his wings while smoothing his hands over the front of his vest. “You are right to ask to get to know me better. You are trusting me with an important project, and I do not wish to disappoint. I accept your invitation to go out.”
Their lips crash together and a tidal wave sweeps them both off their feet. Dean drops the things in his hands, hips leaning out to meet Castiel’s. Framing Dean’s face, Castiel’s breath is uneven. Within seconds, Dean has Castiel pinned against his apartment door, rocking against him while exploring the shape of his back with hot hands. Castiel grunts from the contact, then whimpers. He squirms under Dean’s touch, arching against him whenever he moves away in the slightest.
Castiel nods, pulling his wings even closer to his back. He’s normally confident in his knowledge, but the fact that souls are so abstract makes his feathers itch. “What did it look like to you?”
Castiel frowns, turning his attention to the storm outside the car. He raises a hand to touch his fingertips to Dean’s forehead, to transport them to the overhang by the door. Dean grabs his wrist and shakes his head.
Castiel turns on his heel to follow Dean to the bedroom, squinting at Dean as the man starts to undress. Looking at Dean without pants on makes Cas forget what he had been about to say, instead he stares at Dean as he cleans himself off with his sweatpants. When Dean turns to dig around in his dresser, Cas takes the opportunity to look at the man’s backside.
Dean.”
Dean presses his lips into a thin line and nods. He glances at the clock on the microwave. It’s just past three. “Wanna go out? It’s a little early for dinner, but I’m not opposed to grabbing some grub.”
And after several hours of hard work, Castiel had the pie. The one good enough to present to Dean.
“That should cover my drinks and the commotion. Goodnight.”
“I watched God flood the earth, Dean. This storm is a summer breeze compared to that.”
Sighing, he sinks even further into the cool cushions. He’s warm in his flannel sweatpants and cotton t-shirt. With all the good food and alcohol in his system, he easily falls asleep.
Castiel bows his head in her direction, smiling softly. “You are most welcome. Your daughter is beautiful.”
Dean holds the remote in his hand, flipping through channel after channel in search of something good. A few empty beer bottles and Chinese take-out boxes litter the coffee table in front of him. Dr. Sexy, MD flickers onto the screen and a hint of smile graces Dean’s lips. He slides down the back of his leather recliner, legs spreading into a more comfortable position. If he’s going to be honest with himself, he’ll probably fall asleep here tonight.
Castiel hears the statement, but doesn’t react at first. His grace plunges further into the combined souls, looking into the future. The further Castiel pushes, the less the lavender color appears. The moments between Dean and the woman grow darker until eventually Dean’s sleeping on the couch, wondering why he tried to start a new relationship in the first place. Dean’s nightmares get worse, he starts drinking too much. Castiel pulls out of the knot he created between the two souls, blinking as he comes back to himself.
“No problem,” Dean tugs his wash rag from his belt loop and starts to wipe down the counter. “Ya look like you’ve gone through the ringer today. Ain’t nothin a lil sugar can’t fix is what my momma always said.”
Nathan places two mugs on the laminate table, not bothering to interact with Dean. The clack sounds brings Dean’s attention back to his surroundings and he immediately picks up his cup. As he takes his first sip, his eyes focus on the cupid sitting across from him. Castiel stares down at his drink, wrapping his hands around the porcelain.
Dean’s halfway finished with his pie when his angel reappears. Castiel takes in Dean’s relaxed posture in one of the chairs, noticing a spot of leftover pie on the corner of Dean’s mouth. With a smirk, Castiel leans into the hunter’s personal space and licks away the sugary filling. Dean hums, turning his head to capture Cas’s mouth in a lazy kiss.
Castiel nods, still holding Dean’s coffee as the businessman leads them towards the building’s entrance. “I have known Balthazar since I was a fledgling. He’s been a close friend of my brother, Gabriel, and I for years.”
“Oh thank God,” he mutters, throwing his arms around Cas’s neck and kissing the angel.
“I’ve gone years without that special someone, Cas, I think I can handle another week.” Dean smiles a little to accent the lighthearted tone.
Lucifer laughs at him, replacing the image of Rowena with Dean in their mind’s eye.
“The beginning stages of your relationship would be happy, but later on, neither of you would be satisfied.” Castiel stares down at his hands, fingers tracing through the condensation on his glass.
Dean’s ears turn hot, knowing Castiel’s words show that they are out together. Jo and Ash look back and forth between Dean and Castiel while the angel waits for Dean’s answer. “Well, yeah. It’s kinda rude to not eat or drink anything when someone takes you out.”
When Dean stood near her, when he barred his knife to her, he felt something like that. Like he wanted to be around her, protect her. And that scared him, almost as bad as losing Sam and Cas. But it wasn’t romantic, it wasn’t sexual. Sure, she kissed him, but he pushed her away.
Castiel watches him disappear over the crest of the hill at the end of their road, taking the moment to take a deep breath.
As Castiel eats the other half of Ben’s fajita, a warm feeling starts to trickle through Dean. He stares at his son and the angel he’d become friends with, smiling.  Initially, it feels like he drank hot coffee and could feel the liquid travel down his throat and into his stomach. But this feeling moves through his chest, makes his heart flutter. His cheeks flush in his happiness, something that hasn’t happened to him in years.
Relief floods through Dean, drowns his nerves, unleashes his tension. His muscles buzz and he fist pumps the air. He sighs loudly, standing and shaking out his feet. Castiel watches him, laughing silently to himself. Dean looks down at him, a giant grin on his face.
“Thank you, Dean.”
Purgatory wasn’t something he cared to remember. During the day, he ran and ran. It was a chase, tackling every monster that crossed his path. He’d ask where the angel was, demand their answer before neatly decapitating them. At night, he didn’t sleep. He prayed to Castiel. He told him to come back, to try to find him too. He told him stories about his childhood. He sang songs to him. Sang until he couldn’t remember anymore lyrics, until he was repeating the same verses like it was a hymn itself.
Dean chugs down another glass of water, sighing when he finally stops to breathe. Putting the glass down, he rubs his temples. The only thing ridiculous is him. He’s tired of being lonely.
Dean spits in Lucifer’s face, and Cas’s grace lights in surprise. “You’re the one that’s weak, you fucking coward.”
Castiel dries his hands on a nearby towel, turning off the music as he moves towards the door. He ruffles Lucifer’s fur as he walks by, whispering, “Maybe it’s someone to pick up your stolen goods, Luci.”
Lucifer relaxes when the prayer ends and he stares wide eyed at his brother in their mind. Castiel senses his shock, and his smile grows. His oldest brother, the Morning Star, never felt the beauty of prayer. Never felt humanity’s faith, their hope and joy at being answered. He never felt his grace alight with longing, the feeling of being
“If you would have me, I’d love to spend the night,” Castiel whispers, tilting his head to press a chaste kiss to the corner of Dean’s lips.
Castiel settles in the passenger seat and nods. Dean puts the car into reverse, quickly pulling out of the parking garage and heading to the closest diner. Castiel watches the human drive for a couple seconds before answering. “I understand. Finding your true partner is a stress inducing journey, but that’s what I am here for. You are my charge until your request is satisfied, and I do not intend on disappointing you. You deserve this.”
Rolling his eyes, Dean puts his hands on his hips. “Do I need to write it in calligraphy for you?”
Blushing looks good on the angel, the pink contrasting with the circles under his eyes and the blue of his irises. Castiel looks away from Dean’s honest gaze, shoulders arched up and back hunched. “You saw,” he mumbles thickly.
When the fae looks up, squinting and tilting his head to challenge the open stare, there’s only a dull shimmer in those blue eyes. Dark circles frame them, dampening the cut of his cheek bones with a slight puff Dean knows is from one too many nights without sleep. He almost snorts at the realization that maybe these ageless, graceful creatures are inhibited by the same disgusting human necessities.
He pushes the tack into the corkboard with a nod. The flyer doesn’t particularly stand out amongst the others, but the large bold letters at the top could draw an eye. Turning back to the line of washers, he goes to the closest open one and starts loading in his clothes. He glances around the laundry mat as he drops a Tide Pod into the washer and closes it. A few other students wander about with their own laundry. Castiel squints to get a better look at each person. Any one of them could be a victim of Lucifer’s burglaries.
Dean looks at the pie, then at Castiel. He grins and takes the container from the other boy. “Didn’t know there was a day dedicated to my favorite food,” he laughs, taking a fork in his hand. “Is this whole thing for me?”
He quickly yanks on his jeans before splashing some cold water on his face. Dean stares at his reflection, frowning when he notices the flushed state of his cheeks. “Get it together.”
Dean notices the smile on Castiel’s profile and feels something pang in his gut. The light from the window glows through those black curls, giving the cupid an impromptu halo. And that’s when it really hits Dean that this creature is more than just formal language, celestial powers and wings. Castiel’s something beautiful, something people actually worship. The human swallows and looks away.
The quietness in Dean’s apartment drives him crazier than usual. Sometimes he likes the space, likes having time to himself after all the noise that fills his life. But three days of silence from Castiel and no motivation to go out anywhere makes him restless. He turns the radio on, then off again after the first chords of Can’t Fight This Feeling plays. He washes the few dirty dishes he has, takes out the trash, then cleans his bathroom in a frenzy similar to the week before.
Dean bolts upright, upsetting the balance of his recliner. His legs flail around the sides of the foot rest, his arms reaching out to keep him from falling. Instead of steadying himself, he knocks over some of his garbage. He curses, quickly pulling himself off the chair to clean up the mess. He shakes his head a couple times. He doesn’t remember what the dream was about, only recalls a vivid blue color. It pulses behind his eyelids like a beacon. Rubbing his eyes, he settles back onto his chair. A morning talk show lights up the TV screen, and Dean glances at his phone. He’s awake at 7:13 on a Saturday.
Castiel never really cared much about holidays. He liked Christmas decorations and some of the music, he liked the spark of red in grey winter on Valentine’s Day, he liked the candy sales after Easter. But he didn’t really care about the celebrations, avoiding coming in contact with his family on these holidays. Gabriel would describe it as “not giving a flying rat’s ass”. A language discourse that Castiel still struggles to understand.
When Dean notices the slight upturn of Castiel’s lips, exposing some of his teeth, Dean’s heart stutters. He quickly looks away, staring at his computer as if he has an important email to send. He tries to get his lungs to feel less tight after the soft moment, and clears his throat. Castiel senses the end of the exchange and goes back to his invisible state to stand in the corner.
to eat, sleep and clean. Lucifer tooks off the heavy trench coat, hoping the lack of weight would help him relax as he rolls the sleeves of Castiel’s shirt up. He snarls at these thoughts, crossing his arms and continuing to stare at the walls. They couldn’t go to the Winchester’s bunker or Heaven, so an old motel room works.
As he speaks, Castiel looks at the people sitting around him. His eyes falls on Dean as the man smiles and nods his approval.
Dean shrugs, staring at Sam. The younger Winchester just stares back, eyebrows furrowed. “It can work like that. Cas is from a group of angels that specialize in this kinda thing. It’s called Cupid’s Company. Stupid fucking name, I know, but they have helped people.”
Castiel turns to face the stranger and pauses. The most beautiful human Castiel’s ever seen sits down on the stool next to his own, a smile decorating his lips. The angel stares at the pink flesh before meeting the man’s eyes, just as shocked by their striking green color. Each time he blinks, Castiel feels like he sees something new about the man that is as beautiful as the last.
Dean smiles. “Don’t get your feathers all ruffled, Cas. It’s fine. Nothing special in here though.”
“What is so amusing?” Castiel asks, looking down at his clothes. He knows Dean has seen him in this outfit before.
as he examines Castiel’s attire. The faded Led Zeppelin shirt causes Dean to smile, as does the view the jeans give him as the angel walks over to the table to sit. Dean immediately looks down at the floor, berating himself in his head for checking out Cas after what happened just a couple days before.
The boy does as he’s told, hugging Lisa tightly around the waist. Lisa pulls her gaze away from Castiel to speak with her son, so Cas turns his smile onto Dean. His charge swallows as he stares at him, rubbing his palms together. Cas’s eyebrows furrow and he puts a hand on Dean’s shoulder.
Ben finally asleep in bed, Dean closes the bedroom door with a sigh. He grabs the plastic bag he’d put on the floor and goes back into the living room where Cas sits reading the credits for the movie they just finished watching. The angel’s wings are relaxed against the back of the couch, feathers sprawled out so that Dean can really see the swirl of blue and black. There’s lines across Castiel’s forehead as he squints at the screen in front of him. Dean clenches his fist to keep from reaching out and tracing over the wrinkles with his thumb.
“Thanks, man,” Dean says, wiping his eyes. He shakes his head, putting a hand on Castiel’s shoulder. They stay like that for a couple minutes, occasionally busting out into another fit of giggles. Eventually, Dean picks up his favorite pair, running his thumbs along the lace border along the waistband.
“I’ve only had one year of this shit they call food, and I’m ready to graduate,” Benny grumbles, poking the bread of his chicken sandwich with his pinkie.
Dean huffs when Jo shoves him away, but smiles. He looks at Cas, soul more relaxed than Cas has seen in their week together. Dean bumps his shoulder against Castiel’s, causing the angel to rustle his wings and smile. Sam and Jo watch the interaction, Jo with her arm’s crossed over her chest and Sam with raised eyebrows. The younger Winchester moves his hair out of his face, then extends his hand out to the angel.
Next to the surprised cupid, Dean’s neck flushes. Watching the woman who practically raised him interact with Castiel causes his hands to buzz.
“Dean, hiding me is unnecessary,” Castiel says, pulling his hand back. “I can just make myself invisible or leave. I understand if you wish to spend time with your son.”
Dean doesn’t really remember the drive home from Bobby and Ellen’s place. He just remembers how chilly the air is against his neck and cheeks. A breeze pushes itself under his coat and goosebumps rise on his skin. He shivers, the cold settling in his joints as he enters his apartment. Turning up the heat, he puts on his warmest pair of sweatpants and sweatshirt.
That night, Dean stayed in intensive care, doctors frantically trying to mend his broken body. He didn’t wake up for a week. The head trauma put him into a coma, and even as his wounds started to heal, his brain stayed dead. Desperate, John and Sam cashed in all the favors they could until an angel finally agreed to heal Dean. When he came too, all he saw was the red color of the angel’s hair. She didn’t even give the doctors the chance to take out the breathing tubes from his throat before she disappeared into thin air.
The sound of the TV trickles in from the living room, Ben’s laughter filling the space between human and angel. Dean occasionally glances up at Cas, smirking slightly when he notices the angel watching each of his movements. Soon enough, he has the chicken crackling in a sauce pan while cutting up lettuce and tomatoes. Everything besides the meat finished, he grins down at his work.
Castiel always found that the best place to see humanity’s true beauty was never in the church, but in children’s playgrounds. Nature envelops these small souls in a warm embrace, showers them in sunshine. Each metal structure melds to fit individual imaginations. Children run through the grass and mulch, share their emotions with each other. The basic connections amaze Castiel. The smiles, the intertwined fingers, the small shoves. Such a simple place showcases everything the angel loved about humanity: the pain, the love, the art, the dreams.
“You shouldn’t have to wait any longer,” Cas whispers. If Dean didn’t know any better, he would have sworn something like longing lingered in Castiel’s voice.
“Cas?”
“I apologize for imposing,” he says to the pile. Fixing his blue eyes on Dean again, he offers a small smile. “If you wish to get rid of anything, you are more than welcome to throw them away here. I still occasionally find my ex’s belongings mixed in with my clothes, so I understand.”
Castiel holds Dean’s gaze. His skin tingles where Dean touches it, his arm going numb as if he’d been shocked. He twists his hand so he can grab hold of Dean’s. It’s a bold move, but since Lucifer left his body, Dean’s become comfortable with these moments of intimacy. Dean no longer hides the desire in his eyes when he looks at Castiel. He lets his dilated pupils show Castiel his own love and adoration. He lets their hands brush when he hands Castiel his morning coffee. He rests his shoulder against Cas’s when they watch Netflix together. He kisses Castiel’s cheek when they hug. So it doesn’t surprise the angel when Dean squeezes his hand. But it does make Castiel’s heart flutter.
“Excuse me?” he stammers after a second.
Offering a knowing smile, Gabriel shakes a finger at his brother. “Only because you make it that way. Ya know how what you saw tonight was colored? It’s like that but bigger. It’s impossible to miss.”
The fae raises an eyebrow at Dean as he pours another set of shots. “Would you like one? What you’ve brought me is fantastic.”
“Shit, Cas, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have done that.”
Castiel Novak wears a pair of dark jeans, a black t-shirt and a pair of white Vans. The blue of the jeans is faded around the knees and thighs, frayed at the hems, and the shirt hugs the slant of his shoulders to his hips. Dean bites the inside of his cheek. Crowley searches his face, smirks even more when he sees the faint flush to his friend’s cheeks.
Lucifer pushes the memory aside, shaking his head in their mind. He laughs, facing Castiel’s grace again.
The hunter closes the laptop, holding his head in his hands and shaking his shoulders. Something in his chest feels tight, makes his stomach flip. Makes him think something may be wrong. When he suddenly feels like he can’t breathe, like a pair of hands closes around his throat, he
“It’s settled then, you’ll come here and I’ll take you over to Bobby and Ellen’s for dinner.” Dean sits up straighter, a flush on his cheeks when he realizes it sounds like he’s taking Castiel home to meet his parents.
The feathers on the top of Castiel’s wings arch, the black color rippling. Dean watches the irritated movement for a couples seconds, eyebrows raised. He puts Baby into reverse, leading her out of the parking lot. He tries to hide the pleased smirk on his face.
His Castiel wouldn’t do that. Hadn’t done that since he asked Dean to torture Alastair. And even then, he whispered the words like an apology. “For what it’s worth, I would give anything not to have you do this.”
The burgers steam on the plates, the smell drawing both man and angel to their meals. They don’t say anything to each other as they begin to eat. Dean does enjoy watching the cupid consume his food though. Castiel holds the burger with both hands, fingertips gentle on the bun as he inspects the food. His blue eyes brighten as he takes the first bite, a satisfied hum resonating in his throat. Dean raises an eyebrow at the sound, chewing his own bacon cheeseburger. Castiel doesn’t notice Dean’s expression, all of his senses focused on the food in his hands.
Castiel’s facial expression is professionally stoic, a folder containing the latest numbers for Balthazar and Gabriel to look over in his hand. He wears a standard suit and a bulky tan trench coat, hiding his warrior stance as he waits for permission to enter.
the angel.
As he nurses another couple bottles though, he can’t keep his mind off Cas. Trying to force himself to forget the startled look on Castiel’s face just makes him feel more guilty. So he forces himself to think about that moment over and over as his punishment.
“Hey, Cas…” The hunter’s voice hesitates, and Cas tilts his head in his mind. Lucifer mimics the movement, tilting their head slightly. Dean’s lips twitch up for a second when he catches the familiar movement. He clears his throat, looking down for a second as he asks, “How are you?”
Castiel shakes his head, resting his mug on the table with his hands still wrapped it. “No, I enjoy it. It is definitely better than Gabriel’s and Balthazar’s nickname for me.”
“No problem. Good luck on your crusade, oh valiant sex knight.” Jo grins, winking mockingly over her shoulder as she saunters away. Dean shakes his head, picking up his burger.
Castiel relaxes when Dean asks the question, leaning back against the booth. “Technically, all angels are my brethren, as we are all the same species. I know each of them, have fought beside them. But when I was a fledgling, Gabriel often looked after me.”
Castiel hums softly as he carries the baby to her crib, hand patting her back gently. Dean watches them go with a grin. He decides a slice of pie for himself would be a good reward for finding something Cece actually enjoys. Cutting himself a piece, he uses the same plate with a larger fork. His eyes close as he savors the sweet burst of cherries mixing with the butter glazed crust. Everything melts inside his mouth and he can’t help the satisfied moan that escapes his lips.
The fae nods in agreement, leaving the empty glasses in favor of drinking straight from the bottle. He gasps for a breath when he stops gulping at the whiskey. Dean watches him after finishing his shot. He goes about cleaning their glasses and putting them back on the shelf. Surrounded by nothing but bar sounds, it doesn’t feel tense. The warmth of the alcohol buzzes in the center of Dean’s chest.. The fae watches his hands wring a rag over the glass between swigs. A tint of pink fills his cheeks.
Something is wrong with his angel. He can feel it in his gut. Sam brushed it off, saying that Castiel is always off. But he doesn’t
Within a few minutes, Dean scrolling through the Cupid’s Company website. The top banner is a light pink, blaring and comforting at the same time. Juxtaposed over that is the company name and a photo of the two men Dean saw on the television, Balthazar and Gabriel.
Cas leans into the touch, humming. “Fast asleep. We got a good hour if we’re quiet.”
“Where’s Cas, Lucifer?”
Dean pretends not to have noticed Castiel’s intense gaze on his mouth, but can’t help the smug smile on his face as he answers his son.
Before Castiel can further catalog his thoughts, Jo turns a welcoming smile to him. “Can I get you anything, sweetheart?”
“Yes, darlin,” Dean drawls as he repeats the motion.
Castiel hopes his voice doesn’t betray his own reluctance to be alone again as he waits for Dean’s answer. When the hunter shakes his head, patting the bed again, he sighs. He slowly sits on the edge of bed, giving Dean time to change his mind. Instead of rejection, he hears Dean scoff.
“Are you alright?” Dean asks, and Castiel feels the first twinge of regret course through his body.
Lucifer’s pupils arc almost like he rolled his eyes at the thought and jumps into Dean’s lap. Both men remain silent as Dean takes a drink of water. Using his free hand, Dean absentmindedly pets Lucifer. The tabby purrs until Dean stops and goes back to sorting through the underwear. Lucifer then stands on his hind legs, gold eyes fixed on Castiel as he paws at the pile. One of his claws catches on lace, pulling out the same pair of panties Castiel spotted earlier.
The slight smirk and amused glint in Gabriel’s whiskey colored eyes makes Castiel’s wings arch up in defense. Castiel crosses his arms over his chest. “What are you implying, Gabriel?”
There’s a disturbance in his apartment not much later. Dean’s not sure how much later, startling awake when he hears glasses clink in his small kitchen. Dr. Sexy still plays on the TV, but it’s a different episode. Dean slowly stands, picking up one of the empty beer bottles. If anything, he can slam it against the intruder’s head before tackling the bastard to the ground.
He wears a red flannel, fabric hugging his chest and arms in a way that is more provocative than practical. Dean’s dealt with quite a few fae in his time as a bar owner. He never turned them away, long as they kept their deals to the crossroads. Dean stares at the new stranger, smirking as he cleans a glass in an attempt to assert his hold over the bar and his feelings. It isn’t until those eyes struck against his own that his heart stuttered again. Dean is familiar with the feeling when meeting glances with a few attractive women and men he’d seen in neighboring towns. It’s that trip wire in his heart, thrumming a low note and sending explosions through his blood stream. His hand tightens around the glass as he forces oxygen through his lungs.
“Something wrong?” the hunter asks, eyes searching his best friend’s. There’s something tense about him, making him stand hunched around himself. Like he’s trying to keep himself from spilling out of his body.
Dean stands, turning off the television with a quiet sigh. The silence surrounding him makes the hair on the back of his neck stand up, so he turns on his stereo. The opening chords of Smoke on the Water soothes his nerves as he starts cleaning up the living room. Dean absently hums, bobbing his head in time with the words.
The host laughs as the camera pans out to show her say goodbye to her guests. “I might even try it myself.”
Dean looks up at Castiel, nodding in acknowledgment. “If you think so.”
Castiel sits up again, eyes flashing bright blue as he glares at Dean. He pokes the human sharp in the middle of the chest. “No you shouldn’t have. I may be your friend, Dean, but I’m still a cupid and you are my charge and what you just did crosses a boundary I never expected you to ignore. I have a job, Dean. One you’re paying me for, if you need reminding. I am here to find your soulmate, not to fill your loneliness temporarily.”
Dean sits in his desk chair, sighing as he logs into his computer. Soon after he’s settled people start coming in and out of his office. First the mail, then Charlie with a new invoice, then Zachariah to remind him about his presentation.
Despite everything he’s lived through, he finally found home.
At the words, both fae and Charlie turn to look at him. Charlie’s eyes soften, expression melting into an amused smirk. Girl always was too clever for her own good. The fae’s pinched expression relaxes at the sight of Dean behind the bar. Furrowed eyebrows slump in time with his shoulders. Dean swallows and nods at the fae. “I know just what ya want.”
Cas holds his hand out at the playground. “This. My father’s creation in it’s purest form.”
“Pleasure to meet you, Jo,” Castiel says as he lets go of the woman’s hand.
Castiel smiles fondly, eyes glazing over slightly as he remembers his younger years. “He was an archangel, one of God’s firsts. Most of our older brothers did not dote upon us younglings. They focused on training us more. But Gabe… he taught me how to care for my wings, how to fly. He told me human stories, even brought me to Earth a few times to see the beauty we’re honored with protecting. He taught me the meaning of family.”
Dean shakes his head. He looks away from Castiel, rubbing his hands on his jeans. He doesn’t want Cas to leave. In fact, he kind of wants to know what Ben will think of the angel. And he doesn’t want Cas to be by himself after such a frustrating week. Dean wants to help him, be there for him. “Just… stay for now. You should meet Ben anyway. Could help right?”
Honey and cigarette smoke are the only things Castiel can think of to explain the sweetness and darkness of the man’s voice. He smiles, shaking his head. “You did not offend me. Just took me by surprise. I do suppose it is warm in this establishment.”
Sam looks up at his older brother, watching Dean count the places. “How was your week? You didn’t call me.”
Castiel regards him with that same quizzical squint he always does, processing what the human told him. “I suppose you’re right.”
lowering his own cup.
The hunter lets out a sudden growl before gripping Castiel’s hair to pull him up. Cas yelps in surprise, but quiets when Dean crashes his lips against Castiel’s. Dean’s eyes are closed tight, pain mixed with pleasure in his facial expression. Castiel stares in wonder as Dean’s words morph from his name to broken phrases.
Lisa grabs Dean’s arm and pulls him into the hallway. “Can I talk to you alone for a second?”
He had sat on his laptop for hours searching for apple pie recipes. He looked at hundreds of comments on Pintrest, listed the pros and cons of making crust from scratch. The nights leading up to today, Castiel spent hours in the kitchen rolling dough, slicing apples, testing spices. He made 5 pies in total. Taking a slice from each one, he tasted them to try and figure out which one tasted most like Mary Winchester’s. Her apple pie recipe died with her and Dean always complains about how nothing tasted the same. Castitel knows he could never replicate such a pinnacle of deliciousness, but he can try to come close.
Castiel furrows his eyebrows, trying to recall if he has ever seen such a thing, but comes up short. He squeezes Dean’s shoulder once before pulling away. “If you would prefer, I can remain here during your meeting. I do not wish to make you feel even more uncomfortable during your presentation.”
Ben kneels in front of the girl again. “Anna, this is my dad’s friend, Cas. He’s an angel,” Ben says, chest puffing out with pride.
“Over 1,500 people have entrusted our Cupids with the search for their soulmate. We set up our first customer over a year ago and have yet to hear any complaints since, even from later customers.”
Lucifer’s answer is quiet, a small whisper that barely rings with fear and sadness. Castiel examines his brother’s grace, watches the red flicker slightly as dark blue smothered him. There were many things Castiel still didn’t understand, but he knew sadness. He knew hopelessness. He knew despair and pain and guilt. He knew what it’s like to want to die.
There’s a certain silence before lightning strikes, an electrified stillness that condenses the air right before heat consumes it all in its path.  In the space between hunter and angel is the exact pattern of a lightning bolt, all important things trapped in this space and drawing them together until the flash of their coming together. Dean’s had many first kisses in his almost four decades of life, has found the promised exhilaration of each intoxicating. Kissing Castiel feels like this multiple times over. The touch of their lips, the wetness of Castiel’s chest soaking through his shirt, the way the angel grips his bicep, unearths something in his chest. It’s as if Castiel re-carved his ribs to spell out how they love each other, the promise of everything they could have been and everything they will be going forward.
Lucifer looks around the area, still frowning.
“Thank you,” Castiel gasps out, hand reaching out to grab Dean’s neck and pull him into another kiss. Dean feels tempted to lean their combined weight into the shower wall so he can really press into Castiel’s wings and explore his sides. The curve of Castiel’s arms and thighs are impossible to ignore though, demanding the full attention of Dean’s touch. Dean knows Castiel won’t admit it, but he preens under the attention, leaning into every moment of contact. Dean mouths at Castiel’s throat, tasting the ghost of the ocean scented shampoo they all started using. It tangs on his tongue, but quickly disappears. Castiel tilts his head and grabs Dean’s waist to pull him closer. They both shiver, the heat enveloping them nothing compared to the bonfires trapped under their skin.
” Lucifer inquires, wiping tears from his eyes. “You knew it wasn’t my brother just from which
The hunter can barely see the angel, his face swollen in a way he’s familiar with. He remembers talking Cas out of Naomi’s spell, of saving him from Rowena’s curse. He hears himself say the words he always did, the ones he always told the angel, the ones he used to hide the ones he should have said all along.
………………
The angel’s voice is gravelly as ever, but the sincerity in it makes Dean stand taller. He walks around his desk and makes sure he has no emails, leaning over his desk chair. He clicks away at things, logging out of his computer. Pulling on his suit jacket, he settles his laptop bag over his shoulder and looks to Castiel.
Dean wishes he could say his tour in Iraq didn’t mess with his head, but he’d found lying never makes him feel better. He’d seen people die, unable to control anything. He was just another mindless soldier in the masses. He’d come home with those memories lodged in his chest like shrapnel. Occasionally they twist and his lungs tighten, making it hard for him to breathe as he fights off panic attacks.
At his words, Castiel relaxes his stance, the wings drooping into a more natural position behind him. Dean’s shoulders also slope down as he offers a small smile to accent his apology.
Benny wraps his arm around Dean’s shoulders. “Dean you’ve been checking out Novak all week, just ask him to the dance already.”
Castiel pulls his head back, lips swollen and eyes still glazed as he squints at Dean. “What is so amusing?”
He’s with Dean, trembling in his lap, thrusting up into his own fist. He’s not trapped inside his own mind. He’s free and high on endorphins. He gasps Dean’s name, leveling his gaze on his charge as he moves faster.
Leaning back, Castiel blinks. “No, not at all. It’s quite refreshing actually. Some priests seem removed from the people they serve. Like they think their title separates them from all of humanity.”
“That would be an appropriate label for my father,” the angel answers, snorting to himself. Dean nods, staring at the condensation on his bottle.
Ideas flitter through Castiel’s mind faster than he can describe. Nothing seems appropriate or possible. Under Dean’s stare, his skin feels warm. His neck starts to sweat under his collar, his breath hitching when his Adam’s apple hits his tie on every swallow. Dean’s lips are parted, curved into a lazy smile. Castiel’s grace pounds in time with Dean’s heart, the quickened beat the perfect duet to Castiel’s.
“Would you like something to drink?”
Lucifer shakes his head, frown deepening. He pushes aside his curiosity and the tingling sensation. Looking up at the ceiling of the motel, he smirks.
Castiel’s head snaps up, and he unleashes the most genuine, adoring grin on Dean. His eyes shimmer, dimples shaping the smile. Dean’s heart skips a beat, his hands sweat, his stomach flips. Without thinking, Dean winks, which makes Castiel laugh. Peals of baritone laughter follow Dean down the hallway.
Squeezing Castiel’s shoulder once before letting go, Dean grins. “Amen.”
“This better be fucking worth it,” he mutters under his breath as he clicks the “Request Service” button. Soon, he finishes the basic personality questionnaire and fills out his debit card information. He sighs as he places the order. He’s not lacking in the financial department, but his old habits from living on the road with Sam and Dad still haven’t worn off.
Instead, the corners of the cupid’s mouth quirk up and his wings pull back from their dominant stance. “I suppose the pink is misleading, although it suits my profession.”
“Yeah!” Dean says, clearing his throat when the word comes out too eager. “Yeah, come on in.”
The grin that graces Ellen’s face barely prepares Dean for the flush of embarrassment coloring his cheeks as Ellen says, “Ya never forget a pretty face, Dean.”
“What are you smiling at?” Dean asks, smiling himself.
The room rolls towards the hole in his bed, a negative space he never quite acknowledges is there. He rearranged the room some time ago. Another nightstand found its place beside the bed, its surface clean of any clutter. Like someone will come and claim it with their own mess. His pillow stays glued to his side of the bed, offering up that stretch of space like a sacrifice. Dean never quite knew when these subtle changes happened, just that it felt natural. Though another person hadn’t shared his bed since Lisa.
Castiel’s wings start to shiver with the current of power coursing through him. He draws Dean’s soul closer, intertwining it with his grace to peer into the connection.
There’s another moment of silence between the two. Dean stops spinning the bottle, staring at the angel with his lips parted. He huffs, dipping another fry in ketchup. “That’s an interesting thought, but I’m nothin’ close to refreshing. If anything, I’m a horrible fu-. I’m a not the best priest, okay?”
“I will still be by your side, you and your colleagues will just be unable to see me,” Castiel explains as Dean takes his coffee.
Nestled deep in the western heat wave, just south down the muddy river, lies Ouroboros. There, the water trickles into something sweeter than stars and honey and the grass pulls your feet into the earth. Folks around those parts all know the stories. Ouroboros is a town of bones. Those who live there are all tied by soul and blood to the dirt. Try to leave and it yanks you back with a whip. Fae hunters, non-believers, eager priests, runaways, poor men—they all tumble through on the whirlwinds of a dusty afternoon. None ever stay—spit out by the snake and scared by the rattle. The ones with real grit never shake the town’s poison.
He blushes, rubbing the back of his neck. “Are you sure, Dean? I can go to my room…”
Castiel’s hips thrust forward when Dean pulls on his hair. The jerky movement forces them closer, forces a broken moan from both of them. Castiel knows that noise. He’s seen Dean’s memories, has sewed back together everything that made up Dean’s soul. He knows what the human sounds like when he’s like this, but Castiel wants more. He wants it for himself, wants to coax it out his charge like he did prayers.
“You’re welcome.”
The tabby glares at Castiel for a split second before curling up to nap. Castiel shakes his head, folding the boxers and putting them in a grocery bag. He decides to take them to lost and found the next time he does laundry.
Raising his eyebrow, Dean asks, “So what is it that you know bout me?”
The stranger drains each shot and sighed. He pats the bar. “Three more, but bring them to that table, if you please. I feel particularly… capricious today.”
The information displayed below the banner tells Dean the company’s been a dream of the angels’ for years, but had only recently taken shape. He skips over all that, going to the available packages. Dean chokes a little on his coffee when he sees the price. 4,000 dollars is nothing to sneeze at. Glancing back at his bed, he frowns.
With that, she kisses his cheek and leaves the room to grab more of the food. The only sounds in the house are Ellen and Jo’s mingled voices coming from the kitchen. Dean wants to ask Sam to say something, to say anything. He feels some thoughts get lodged into his throat before he can say them. His brother wouldn’t judge him for wanting to find someone.
Blinking, Castiel meets Dean’s worried gaze. He can sense the pounding rhythm of Dean’s heart and he puts a hand on Dean’s neck to feel the pulse against his palm. His own breathing is shaky, wings fluttering behind him.
Dean smiles at his angel, pulling down the covers for him. Castiel smiles back, settling underneath the sheets and comforter. He rests on his side, facing Dean. Instantly, he feels calmer. Days of work, of using his grace, catch up to him. It pulls at his mind, makes his eyes heavy. Dean’s hand pats the top of his, then stays there, a warm touch lulling him further into sleep.
Castiel blinks when the human smiles at him. He admits to himself that Dean Winchester is attractive. The smile is bright, genuine, accenting the laugh lines around his eyes and the freckles along his cheekbones. The expression is almost as bright as the soul that shines through underneath Dean’s mortal skin. Castiel’s grace thrums, proud that he has the opportunity to help such a beautiful soul.
Suddenly, all the showers are off and Dean knows Castiel has curled his wings away, hidden himself in shame and embarrassment. Dean’s done the same, covered himself, fingertips tingling with the need to cry because he came thinking about men he couldn’t want, people he couldn’t have a life with, things he couldn’t do. Dean rests a flat palm against the wood. He wants to comfort the angel. “Can I come in?”
Dean looks around at the park. At the older oak trees and the rusting slides. “A rusty jungle gym is pure to you?”
