“I know…” He felt horrible for not considering she would want to make Sherlock’s cake. Just one more thing he could add to the list of how this party was turning his hair grey. Well, greyer. “We really could use some other snacks, though. Perhaps you could help with those?”
Sherlock paused. Looking at John, he took in his tired face and slightly slumped posture. He set his shoulders, closed his eyes, and began again.
“He sat through the entire talk. So I asked him to coffee and that was that. He made me laugh.” She looked at Tom and smiled as he put his hand on top of hers.  “Eight months,” Tom said astonished. “And I haven’t screwed it up yet.”
“Why would I possibly know his favorite cake!?” John grabbed his coat that he had thrown on the chair earlier and shoved his arms into it as he left the room.
There was no mistaking the atmosphere that surrounded Baker Street at this point. It filled their little section with the sounds of life. People were beginning to lean out their windows, humming along - no words, just the tune of the soaring notes in light sounds and deep hums.  As more joined in, it resonated and added to the makeshift orchestra. Children were dancing, people had their mobiles stretched out their windows, filming the scene.
“Does your father travel for work often?” Sherlock asked politely. A little conversation now would allow him to be more silent later.
“Oh, Sherlock. Honestly?” Mycroft could barely contain his glee. “John Watson? Oh, this was worth the drive.”
Lestrade walked in an hour before the party was to begin. “Looks great but it’s missing something…” and grinned as he tossed a roll of crime scene tape at Rosie. She squealed and she and Molly ran around the flat draping it over the furniture and winding it around the bookcases.
“Yes, we do, calm down. We don’t want to give it all away now,” he whispered. “Here he comes.” They shuffled in their seats, trying to look bored.
John put the forceps down and shook his head as if to clear his thoughts. He turned to Sherlock and smiled, “Starving.”
John smiled at the two of them sitting together, half-listening. All he really heard was the word “family”.  Suddenly, Rosie's idea of celebrating Sherlock’s birthday didn’t seem all that bad.
“I’m a consulting detective. Only one in the world. I invented the job.” Sherlock quickly replied looking down at his plate.
Rosie chose that moment to walk into the room. “Oh, hello, Watson,” he said brightly. He’d never dismiss John’s daughter, even in his darkest moods. She climbed into Sherlock’s lap, dried mud flaking onto her leggings, and he held her gently. “What do you have there?”
There are still nightmares, but they are few and far between. Now, however, Sherlock and John are always with each other, side by side - and they are never again dealt with alone.
Sherlock stands still and looks at the bag. John bought a gift for him? In a bag with hearts on it? He goes back and forth between those two sentences in his head for quite a bit before he hears John say his name. Loudly. Sherlock looks up and meets John’s eyes.
When the Prime Minister finally got his head out of his ass, closed the schools, canceled large events, and instituted social distancing, John had already been working 12-hour days at the clinic for over two weeks. He wasn’t even aware of the new mandates until he woke up after a well deserved night’s rest to try to enjoy his only day off that week.
He throws on his robe and quietly walks downstairs so as to not to disturb Sherlock (aiming to edit a few blog entries he feels are not quite ready to post) but is surprised to find him at the kitchen table peering into his microscope with bunches of dead crickets on paper plates all around him. His hair is a mess, like he had been dragging his fingers through the curls. John has always loved how soft and adorable Sherlock looks with his hair sticking out in all directions.
Sherlock stood still, eyes wide. He surveyed the room. Mycroft, leaning against the fireplace, smirking as if he dared Sherlock to turn around and leave. Lestrade, holding a beer, a huge grin on his face. Molly, holding her hands in front of her, smiling and praying this would go well. Mrs. Hudson, on the couch, fidgeting. They were looking at Sherlock, waiting for his reaction.
“Will have to see how much time I have now… “ she said under her breath. “Have you got it all set, then? Tomorrow will be here soon enough,” she finally sat down, wiping her hands on her apron, apparently appeased at John’s last request.
Sherlock eventually directed the conversation back to Rosie and Tom and was able to stay silent through dessert.  They all ventured back into the sitting room and Mrs. Hudson began to bombard John with more questions which he answered kindly and patiently. He talked with her and they laughed, and as Sherlock stood in the doorway to the kitchen, he thought to himself that he had never seen anything more beautiful than John Watson laughing in his sitting room.
Sherlock was just about out of words but he managed to stumble out, “Yes, well, I can take you there sometime.” He internally screamed realizing he did it again.
“I’ll go,” Sherlock jumps up, much preferring the errand to the dishes.  John leans back, looking out the kitchen exit to the stairs, until he’s sure Sherlock’s gone. Then he shuts the water off and goes to the bathroom to retrieve the gift bag he has hidden behind his med kit in the cabinet under the sink.
Rosie stood guard by the window. "He's here!" she announced when she saw him get out of the cab. They all turned to the door, waiting for the birthday boy.
“Oh my goodness, what a pleasure it is to meet you! I’ve seen all your films!” She then turned to Tom, “Thomas Holmes!  How could you not let us know John Watson was going to be joining us this evening? And Mrs. Turner’s away at her daughter’s - she’ll never believe me! Always pulling out her pictures of the day she met ‘this one’ or ‘that one’. And now John Watson is in my house! She’ll think I’m pulling her leg.”
“Let’s sit and watch telly for a bit - find something really boring.” John walks towards the couch, grabs the remote, and plops down in a corner as he flips through the channels. “C’mon, we just need to relax.” Sherlock sits at the kitchen table and stares at John for a moment before nodding, getting up, and shuffling over. He lays his head on the opposite end, wraps his dressing gown around his pulled up knees, and yawns.
They were all sitting around the breakfast table the next morning when Sherlock announced, “Lestrade has some cold cases he’d like me to examine, I’ll be gone until this evening”
“Of course.” Sherlock ran a hand over his eyes as he rounded his chair. His deduction skills seemed to disappear around this man.
With the sounds of clapping and cheering still happening outside on Baker Street, with the world in a state of uncertainty, they found the love they needed in each other.
“Ah,” John purses his lips and looks around the room. Anything to not be caught staring. He really needed sleep. “Tea?”
“The absolute last time…” John heard Sherlock mumbling as he slowly walked into the flat, completely covered in mud.
John Watson. Sherlock closed his eyes and couldn’t understand how one man, a man he didn’t even know, could affect him so much.  How one man could cause him -
“I only found out about this tonight, as well, so don’t feel so bad,” John interjected.  Sherlock looked at John for the first time since dinner began and started getting flustered again. Well, that was easily solved. He just wouldn’t look at John for the duration of the meal. He could talk to someone and not look at them.
“I’m going to walk them to the car,” Tom said and jogged out after them all. Sherlock was left standing alone in the middle of the sitting room, glancing around with his mouth open as if he was about to ask someone a question but was paused mid-sentence.
“Do you want to talk about it?” John asks. Another head shake is Sherlock’s reply - still not looking up, still no words. John looks around, bites his bottom lip and takes a leap. “Would you like me to stay?” After a beat, he sees Sherlock barely nod his head.
“Please give my regards to Rosie,” Sherlock said politely, and exited the cab. He didn’t see John give him a small nod and look down resigned as the cab drove away.
Mycroft confidently leaned back in his chair, quite enjoying the display in front of him. “I really can’t see how my input would be beneficial in this matter,” he replied. “Young Rosamund seems to be quite the delegator. Anthea’s got one eye on her. Never too early, you know…” he trailed off, knowingly baiting John.
“Not my problem, mate.  Rosie gave me a list - a very specific list, mind you - and here it all is.” He started pointing to the items, “Plastic skeletons, fake blood, rubber fingers, still haven’t found candy eyeballs but I’ve got Donovan searching online … I had to drive all over London to get some of this - it’s January not October!”
John walks back and stands in front of Sherlock’s chair. “You are?” John asks hopefully as he looks down and cups Sherlock’s face with his hand. Sherlock grabs it and holds it in place as he leans into it, closing his eyes, and nods.
“Again, mate, not my division. I took care of my end. I give it about another half hour before Sherlock realizes the case I sent him on was a wild goose chase. You better sort this soon.” He trotted down the stairs yelling, “Cheers!”
“Already called her,” Sherlock says as takes a sip of his coffee with his eyes closed. “She’ll be here in an hour.” If only he had his eyes open, he’d have seen John turn his head and look at him as if he were the sun - eyes bright, mouth open with the beginnings of a smile forming as he quirked up one side of his lips. “Oh, I could kiss you. I’ll go pack her bag.” He kisses Rosie on the head instead and slides the pears across the table to Sherlock who slowly picks up the spoon and continues to feed Rosie without missing a beat, staring with eyes wide open at John’s back as he leaves the room.
“YES!” John begrudgingly yelled over his shoulder, and was gone, leaving the smug, laughing man behind.
“There was no way I could say no to her, John.” They were in Molly’s lab and she was explaining the conversation that led to her inviting their closest friends to a party for a man that didn’t want one. “She was so excited and I wasn’t going to be the one who took that away!”
John chuckled at her enthusiasm. “Well, I play a librarian, but I’m going to keep quiet on the rest for now - it’s still in its early stages. But I’ll keep you updated, promise.” He winked at her sweetly and Mrs. Hudson beamed like she was being let in on a special secret.
A taxi pulled up almost immediately after Sherlock raised his hand. “No, I tend to work in the morgue two or three days a week. More, even, if I have a case on and need their equipment. I’ve a friend there who helps me get around certain… protocols.”
Opening his eyes, Sherlock knows immediately that John is lying behind him. He’s always aware of John’s proximity to himself and not even sleep could change that.
) and said with a big smile on his face, “Dinner?” Now, they’re chatting about their latest case and laughing as Sherlock nicks prawns off John’s plate. It feels good to be well rested and they decide to walk home.
After they ate, and they saw Mrs. Hudson off to her sister’s, they were finally on the road to Sherlock’s parent’s house.
“Really? I’d love to see the inside of a morgue that’s not a set! I almost studied medicine, like Rosie, but then this sort of came around and I had to choose. I still find all that very interesting.”
Arriving back home after his errand, he was greeted with the smells of breakfast and heard Mrs. Hudson and Tom in the kitchen, apparently also rehashing last night’s events.
John chuckles. “I left a little bear for her at Mrs. Hudson’s so she wouldn’t see it. I’ll run down to get it if you want to finish up here.”
Rosie then walked her dad over to Sherlock, who hadn’t moved a muscle during Mrs. Hudson’s entire speech. Was he in his mind palace? John Watson never appeared in his mind palace before, no reason he would now. Was he dreaming? Doubtful, he rarely remembered his dreams. He hadn’t partaken in his 7% solution since the day all those years ago when he told his parents Tom was coming home with him and they had given him one week to enroll in a rehab program to get clean. The only explanation left was that John Watson
“Always, as well, John. For me,” and Sherlock tilts his head up bringing their lips together again, holding the small little card in his hand, against his heart.
They decide to order dinner in, neither wanting to leave the sitting room and the small cocoon that they’ve built around them. Through their quiet conversation while eating, neither broaches the subject of what they know they feel and when they’re ready for bed they don’t quite know what to do.
Tom, well used to Sherlock’s mood swings, just took it all in stride and told his father that he had acted absolutely fine.  “Everyone had a fun time,” he assured, “you’re reading too much into this. And who knows, maybe you
He could never say no to Tom, however.  When his sister died, Sherlock agreed to take in his young nephew solely to keep him out of Mycroft’s stodgy influence. Sherlock had quite enough of that growing up and wouldn’t subject his nephew to the same. Eventually, when it became clear that Tom's birth father wanted nothing to do with the boy, he adopted Tom right before his eighth birthday.  That was fourteen years ago and Sherlock had not regretted it for a single moment.  Tom brought something into his life he didn’t know he was missing and saved Sherlock in more ways than Tom would ever know.
Sherlock’s eyes continued to track John as he left the kitchen.  It hadn’t escaped his notice that John had been staring a little more lately, and as much as Sherlock wished his feelings for his flatmate were reciprocated, he couldn’t let himself dwell. Things were more than good and that would have to be enough.
“Thank you.” John closes his eyes, takes a few deep breaths and pulls Sherlock a little closer burrowing his face into Sherlock’s neck.  Warm, they both finally drift back to sleep.
“Molly,” Sherlock acknowledged with a nod as they entered the morgue. Damn. He was hoping she wouldn't be working today. She had her back toward them and she was bent down looking into a lower cabinet.
Tom was laughing as Sherlock walked into the room. “Yes, Tom, on this point I do have to agree with Mrs. Hudson. Although I hardly think I was ready to fall on the floor.” He sat down not looking at the two of them, grabbing the Christmas Day paper and reading the front page headlines while holding it high in front of his face.
Sherlock looked quickly at John, then back at his plate and nodded.  An awkward moment of silence descended upon the table until Mrs. Hudson asked Rosie how she and Tom met.
John slouches, Sherlock stretches, and slowly they drift off to the sounds of a man attaching flutes to a pigeon while John rests his hand on Sherlock’s ankle.
Thankfully, John continued the conversation. “What the hell just happened over there? Sounds like a bomb went off,” he joked.
John rubbed his hand over his face and sighed. “I know…” He paused to think. “OK, if we’re going to do this it has to be simple. We yell surprise, have cake, and everyone’s out the door. I think we can get it done in thirty minutes, tops.” Yes, he thought, good plan.
“Once I realized Rosie was planning it, I stopped deducing it, John, I swear. My reactions to everything in there were authentic,” Sherlock chuckled, the wine having done its job. He relaxed and looked out into the night.
“Rosie planned just a few games,” Molly said, fumbling through some papers then she began to read, chuckling, “Pin the knife on the corpse, musical coffins, bobbing for poisonous apples…”
Mycroft insisted upon sending a car for holidays, which Sherlock inevitably refused, but Tom always accepted for the both of them. Sherlock grumbled through the entire ride, complaining that the train would have been a better method of travel without requiring him to thank anyone.  At least he could take comfort in the fact that the drive was blessedly British-government-free, since Mycroft would be arriving later in the day.
Mrs. Hudson had her hands clasped in front of her face trying to contain her excitement so Tom walked her over to John, “Mr. Watson, let me introduce you to our downstairs neighbor, Mrs. Hudson.”
Sherlock is speechless. But then he says exactly what’s on his mind. “I don’t want you to sleep upstairs from this point on.”
John Watson. John Watson was in his flat. John Watson was in his flat with his short, perfect hair and just a hint of scruff on his face and his beautiful blue eyes and his striped jumper and jeans and Sherlock was expected to go out there and serve him fried fish?  When did the universe become so cruel?
Finally alone with John, Sherlock again found himself disconcerted. This was getting ridiculous. He was a grown man! He was certainly able to carry on a conversation with more than three words per sentence. Focusing on the task at hand, he decided the best course of action was to begin his experiment and let John observe. John seemed keen to do the same, and as the next hour passed Sherlock was able to show John a little about his work and answer the (surprisingly) intelligent questions John posed to him at different stages.
Sherlock brusquely said, “I’m just going to be working over here, no help needed.” He strode quickly towards the back of the room and tried to direct John to follow, where hopefully Sherlock could keep John occupied and unseen.
“Yes. Who is this?” He stood up and stretched up on one foot to reach a long glass tube that was laying across the top of the cabinets.
And they lived happily ever after. :) I hope you enjoyed reading my little celebration of Sherlock's birthday as much as I enjoyed writing it - xoxo
After they thanked the owners for lunch, (“I did them a favor once, they no longer let me pay,” Sherlock explained) they walked outside to pouring rain. Sherlock quickly hailed them a cab and, as in the morning, John let Sherlock in first before climbing inside.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.” A cup of tea and a healthy helping of scones were loudly deposited on the table in front of John. “You shouldn’t have,” he said anxiously.
Sherlock looked up with glazed eyes, confused, and then looked out the window, the moment finally sinking in. It wasn't the sort of attention he was comfortable receiving and he didn’t know how to respond to John. He didn’t know how it evolved into the sound of the many instruments that suddenly echoed in his head, but he knew why he started.
The few moments Sherlock and John did have in each other’s company, John made sure to keep a subtle eye on Sherlock’s breathing and general state of health. As a former addict and someone who thought of taking care of “transport” a nuisance, John knew if Sherlock contracted the virus it could hit him hard. John set alarms on his own phone to remind him to text Sherlock from the clinic at regular intervals to tell him to eat and drink.  He knew Sherlock was probably ignoring him, but that wouldn’t stop John from trying.
“No, I think not Mrs. Hudson. Another time.” He knew his hands were shaking too much to hold his violin and handle the bow. At the present moment he couldn’t imagine them ever being steady again. She gently slapped his shoulder and walked over to Rosie and Tom standing by the tree.  Sherlock could hear her pointing out to Rosie the various ornaments Tom made in school over the years. He suddenly realized he was standing there alone with John Watson.
Sherlock pulled the lobster out of the freezer and gently slid it into the boiling water. He had four of the seven dishes prepared for Christmas Eve dinner and decided to work on the fried cod next. He switched to speaker phone, set it on the counter, and began to cut the fish into portions.
John broke the awkward silence, “Um, so thank you again for having us this evening. Rosie and Tom really insisted or I wouldn’t have barged in. I have to make my way back home soon, early day tomorrow with Christmas,” he explained.
“Tom, I sincerely hope she’s not like the last one. The tone with which she ended her sentences, I couldn’t tell if she was telling me something or asking me a question. Was she conducting an interview?” He hoped Tom could hear his eye roll over the phone. Tom certainly had his fair share of girlfriends over the years, and Sherlock deleted each just as quickly when the next one came along.
Rosie wiggled out of Sherlock’s arms and dragged him around the room, showing him all they had planned for the evening. He took in the sign, games, food, and Molly brought out the cake.
“Well, I’m not sure what to do with myself now,” John said as he sat down. He drummed his fingers on his thighs looking around the kitchen. “It’s a nice day. Short walk?”
The amazing Obviously Sherlocked did a fantastic job with the beta of this chapter and made it even better! Thank you, my darling!!
The topic of Rosie was brought up at dinner. “When can we meet her?” Mrs. Holmes asked. Sherlock was not looking forward to this discussion, still trying to forget the previous night, and absolutely mortified by how he acted.
John is as close to Sherlock as he can be without touching. He’s so close Sherlock can feel his breath on the back of his neck. He realizes he can also hear small sounds coming from John, which must be what woke him. It’s not quite dawn, too early to get up - not that Sherlock would, even if it was full daylight.
There are new nightmares, too. But not John’s. Sherlock’s own cries and whimpers can be heard through the floor most nights and John feels powerless to comfort his best friend. Sherlock has only ever given John the basic facts about his time … away, and John doesn’t feel he has the right to pry. Sherlock has never made John talk about his shoulder injury and he pays Sherlock the same respect. He can give him that.
In a small office across London, a man sat alone at his desk with his eyes closed, CCTV opened on his computer, an empty plate with cake crumbs in front of him, humming along.
But John looked at Sherlock and chuckled, then walked towards Molly. He held his hand out, “Hi, I’m John. Pleasure.”
Their long nap backfires a bit when it gets close to midnight and neither man is tired. They lapse into a comfortable silence as Sherlock migrates back to his crickets and John works on his blog.  It’s close to 1:30am when John rises to his feet, “I’m going up. I’d say you should go to bed, but I know who I’m talking to.” Sherlock smiles softly without looking away from the lens and simply says, “Good night, John.”
John feels like shit. This is entirely not the way he intended for this night to go, or how he wanted to give Sherlock his present. John was looking forward to tomorrow night, sitting in their chairs in front of the fire, and he was hoping that a small amount of liquid courage would be all he needed to finally confess his feelings to the man he’s loved for so long.
“That’s not what I said!” Tom laughed and looked back and forth between them. “Well, that’s not what I meant.”
John walks down the hallway and is about to knock on Sherlock’s door when he pauses and pulls the small valentine out of his back pocket. He closes his eyes for a moment and takes a few deep breaths before dropping it into the bag. It’s not like he wrote a sonnet on it, and if Sherlock doesn’t react then John can just laugh it off and claim he was caught up in Rosie’s enthusiasm. He knocks on the door before he can change his mind. “Sherlock?”
Sherlock squinted into the lens and spoke in the same slow, distracted manner, “Normally I’d say yes, but caffeine seems contrary to our goal for this afternoon.”
He starts to push himself back up when he feels a hand on his shoulder and a sleepy, “Don’t go. Warm,” coming from a groggy Sherlock, who is still on his side with his eyes closed, and who then falls right back into his slumber. John can’t deny him, so he closes his eyes and is sleeping again moments later.
Sherlock’s sister returned home one day with a baby boy. He was immediately enthralled with the infant in a way he couldn’t have predicted. As Tom grew into a toddler, he was left with his grandparents more and more as Sherlock’s sister began to spend less and less time with the family. Sherlock would always be on his best behavior when he knew he was going to see Tom, staying sober and giving Tom his undivided attention. The way Tom looked at him reminded Sherlock of how he himself used to look at Mycroft when he was younger. He vowed not to betray Tom in the way Mycroft did by growing up and leaving when Sherlock needed him the most.
“Well, Tom said to be ready for anything so I’m just making sure I know the layout of this place in case we have to jump out the window or something.” She cocked her head to the side and looked at Tom up through her eyelashes with a small quirk of her lips.
He quickly spouted out, “How did you get this number?” As soon as the sentence was out of his mouth he winced at his tone. “Not that a phone call isn’t welcome. I’m just…” and he faltered.
“Look at me, Sherlock.” And Sherlock does. All of John’s apprehension dissipates as he looks into those beautiful eyes. Eyes filled with admiration, trust, and love. John leans down and gently grazes his lips against Sherlock’s before touching their foreheads together.
“Really?!” John looked from his daughter to Sherlock, clearly impressed. “I remember reading about that. That was you? I don’t remember your name in the papers.”
Sherlock regained his wits. “Thank you for the wine. Will you excuse me for just a moment?” He calmly walked into the kitchen, gingerly set the wine down on the counter, and continued straight down the hall into his bedroom.  He gently closed the door behind him and then his body began to shake as he proceeded to slide down the back of the door onto the floor.  He held his head in his hands and tried to breathe.
John stood there a moment, then stepped back and looked into Sherlock’s eyes. He reached over and gently took the violin and bow out of Sherlock’s hands and placed them on his chair.
Sherlock immediately grabbed the phone, “No!” he yelled. Closing his eyes, and breathing deeply, he regulated his voice and continued, “No. Apologies. I am able to talk.” His mouth gaped open, and he tried to think of another sentence to contribute, but he came up blank.
Sherlock opens the door. He only has himself to blame for his disappointment. “Is your head alright? I apologize for startling you,” he says calmly. John has every right to date, and Sherlock long ago swore off being childish about it.
- to forget how to speak. He hadn’t been that flustered since… well, he couldn’t even remember when, that’s how long ago it was. He closed his eyes and leaned his head back on the seat. John Watson. Sherlock was happy he got through the evening with his dignity intact.
Sherlock was sitting at the kitchen table one afternoon, goggles and gloves on, beakers bubbling, about to place one precise drop of solution onto a slide when his phone rang. He was going to ignore it, before remembering he was expecting a call from Molly about another batch of livers waiting for him, and he quickly tore off a glove and tapped his phone.
Sherlock swung his head around quickly, lost his balance and fell, smashing the tube in the process.
Sherlock faltered only slightly as he stepped into the car. He couldn’t remember feeling this off center before. After a few failed dating attempts in college, he hadn’t bothered. He had Tom, he had his work. He was perfectly content. But no one had ever before made him feel the way he felt when John Watson held a car door open for him and smiled. He closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths before John settled in next to him, and then - finally - they were on their way.
John turned and looked at Sherlock. “You did that,” he said in a choked voice, tears filling his eyes. “You made that,” he pointed outside, “happen.”
There were many memories captured within these walls, some pleasant, some most definitely not. Memories of him running around with his sister, closer in age to him than Mycroft, conducting experiments in the garden or rummaging through the attic. Mycroft assisted when asked, he even set up adventures and mysteries for his younger siblings to solve. Eventually, however, as they grew older, Mycroft was rarely home and his sister’s intelligence caused her to rebel from all things family related.  By the time Sherlock was in his teens, both of his siblings had moved out and he was alone in the large house, with his interests falling to less than desirable pursuits.
Sherlock couldn’t read the situation. Was John implying he’d be open to spending more time together? Was he waiting for Sherlock to get out of the cab so John could go about his day? Did John realize Sherlock had an interest in him far beyond friendship? There were too many variables and Sherlock had to get out of the cab. Immediately.
He opens the bag to check that the vintage chemistry book he knows Sherlock was eyeing last month when they took Rosie to story time at the bookstore was still intact. John changed the bag’s hiding spot every two days since he bought it, trying his hardest not to let his brilliant flatmate deduce him. Not that Sherlock would expect a gift from John on Valentine’s Day, abhorring all such emotions except for those that he displays for one little blond, curly haired girl.
A horn joined in, John couldn’t tell which instrument specifically, but it was robust and deep - and added the perfect satisfying and poetic accompaniment to the movement.
Rosie and Tom looked at each other and smiled as Rosie began, “We were the only ones at a book signing. Well, I was the only one at this book signing…”
Sherlock’s sister died when Tom was 5, and after it was evident that Tom’s father did not want to be a part of the boy’s life, there was much discussion of where Tom would be raised. His grandparents would certainly raise him, but it wasn’t until Mycroft insisted Tom be brought up properly that Sherlock knew he had one chance to save both their lives.  He informed his family of his intentions to raise Tom himself, which shocked his parents and was immediately and loudly dismissed by Mycroft based on his age and unsavory habits. This argument was met with an icy stare from Sherlock and the vow he would get sober and stay that way.  With an ultimatum given to him by his parents, he stormed out of the house, went home to pack a bag, and checked himself into a rehab. Looking back now, he knew if he had not had that motivation he would have been dead within the year.
Sherlock quickly hit the end call button and gently flipped the cod over, lowering the heat. He leant back on the counter and sighed. He wasn’t looking forward to an evening answering hundreds of questions about crime scenes and murder.  Everyone thinks they want to know all the gory details, until Sherlock actually begins to describe the nerve endings hanging off a severed limb and the conversation ends in wide eyes and mouths - and although that is his ultimate goal in the end, the entire endeavor is tedious.
Suddenly, Sherlock scooped Rosie up and hugged her close. “Watson! What have you done for me? Is this my birthday surprise? I love it.” He looked into John’s eyes with a soft smile as he spun Rosie around, and John adored him. John mouthed the words,
Sherlock sees it and asks, “Is that for Rosie, as well? I’ll put it with the bear,” and goes to take it but John pulls the bag back.
“... and he sat down pretending to be there for the signing, too. He said it was a topic he was always interested in and I was eager to discuss with him individual care plans of geriatric patients…”
Everyone else was already seated and chatting while John was pouring white wine into the glasses. Sherlock could hear more of Mrs. Hudson’s inane questions. “So, John,” she said, basking in the fact that she could call him John, “what was it like working with Hugh Grant? He’s just divine!”
Sherlock couldn’t help smiling. They locked eyes and they held contact a beat longer than necessary. It took Sherlock’s breath away. There were a few moments of awkward silence as they both continued with their meals.
Baker Street broke out into applause. You couldn’t hear above the din - the clapping, the whistling, the cheers of “Bravo!” coming from every window. It was the sound of hope, it was the sound of life in the world, and knowing they would all be able to fully embrace it again soon.
Sherlock hears John’s breath changing and knows he’s awake, but not yet aware that Sherlock is as well. “I’m up,” Sherlock whispers. “It’s still early, go back to sleep.”
“I wanted to thank you for Christmas Eve. I know it was last minute having me and I just wanted to let you know I had a great time,” John said.
“Yes, um, quite often. He can be away for months at a time.” She looked at Tom who had come to sit beside her, “Um, Tom, maybe we should tell …” but Tom gave her a wide eyed stare and quickly shook his head.
John stood and assessed the situation. Everything was ready to go, even the cake was waiting in the fridge, complete with a fondant dagger stabbed dead center on top.
“Not quite. I just… dropped some… things. It’s… it’s fine. How can I help you?” He started pacing between his sitting room and kitchen, unable to stand still.
They decide to eat dinner out (a rare occurrence these days while Rosie is in her “look what I can throw” phase) and Sherlock is relieved there is no awkwardness from John despite their napping arrangements. When they woke up earlier, John simply stretched his arms over his head (which made his skin peek out a bit -
“Soon I hope,” Tom replied brightly. “She has a break coming up - I’ll bring her by for the afternoon one day.”
After minutes, maybe hours, days - John pulls away and looks into Sherlock’s eyes. “I love you. I absolutely, completely adore you and I don’t want to keep myself from telling you that ever again.”
Sherlock Holmes very rarely paid any attention to popular culture. He didn’t listen to the radio or watch telly.  He seldom watched films. Unless that film had a certain actor in it. A certain actor who, while he might not be on everyone’s favorite list, was most certainly on Sherlock’s. In fact, he was the only celebrity to ever give Sherlock pause, which said a lot. That actor was John Watson. Who was currently standing in Sherlock’s sitting room, awkwardly holding two bottles of wine.
John stared incredulously at the pile of party supplies on the kitchen table that was growing larger and larger. “What am I supposed to do with all this?”
John starts off just lightly touching his lips to Sherlock’s and their noses brush against one another. He puts a little more pressure into it and Sherlock wraps his hand around the back of John’s neck. They begin to move their lips, both wanting to satisfy their need for more. John strokes Sherlock’s cheek as he opens his mouth the slightest bit to let just the tip of his tongue touch Sherlock’s lower lip, which drives Sherlock absolutely insane.  John sinks his fingers into Sherlock’s curls and tilts his head as Sherlock opens his mouth to let John in. When their tongues finally touch their legs tighten around each other and they moan with want, panting heavily whenever they get the chance to take a breath. They kiss with the intensity of years of longing and neither wants to ever stop.
“Nothing at the present time. Criminals are particularly lazy at Christmas and New Year’s,” he said with more than a hint of disappointment in his voice.  He pushed his fish around the plate.
“We wrote our Valentine cards for tomorrow,” Rosie answers, “and there are some left over so you can write yours, too!” She’s looking at both John and Sherlock as she speaks.
to Sherlock as John had his back to her, already exploring the space, but Sherlock just waved his hand motioning her to quickly leave.  She pointed at him and sternly mouthed again,
Six hours. Six hours of uninterrupted sleep. There were no nightmares - no dreams at all actually, and John feels better than he has in a long time. So good in fact, he figures he might close his eyes and try for another hour - which is when he realizes he is no longer sitting, but curled up halfway down the couch with his head resting on Sherlock’s hip.
Finally, one Friday morning, they break. Sherlock is exhausted, John is sore, and Rosie (as the only tenant of 221B getting any REM sleep) is a tireless ball of energy.
As John walked into the kitchen, he was pleased to see Sherlock at the kitchen table staring into his microscope, as opposed to hanging upside down in his chair.  Sherlock spoke without looking up. “Mycroft sent what we needed. He made sure to take care of Mrs. Hudson, as well. You have the day to relax.”
John cut her off, “Wha…? Where did she come up with these?” He pointed straight ahead, “One game. ONE.”
They looked at each other. It wasn’t a difficult decision. John wrapped his hand around Sherlock’s neck, stood up on his toes, and brought their lips together. Sherlock immediately embraced John and they kissed with the force of years of longing and secrets kept inside.
Sherlock played for John. It was easy for him to be taken over by the music when it was for John. His eyes were closed. He began to sway closer and closer to the window behind his chair until he was completely facing it, almost leaning out of it, the sound of his violin filling Baker Street. With each stanza, he played louder, trying to capture the moment and give it to John.
John sits up, answers the phone and listens to his daughter laugh with Molly encouraging her in the background. He tells Molly tomorrow afternoon would be great to drop Rosie back, thanks her, and hangs up. He hears Sherlock fill the kettle and take out the pans for breakfast.
“Yeah. I do,” John replied brightly. “If I’m allowed? Or if you’d rather not...” he trailed off hesitantly.
“Sherlock is going to be very surprised, Daddy. I didn’t leave any clues at all!” she leaned back with her arms around John’s neck. He smiled and raised his eyebrows at her. “Good girl!” he said proudly. “You were a fantastic party planner." He kissed her forehead as he deposited her in bed.
Mrs. Hudson practically squealed in delight. Rosie laughed. She walked over to give her dad a hug.  Sherlock slowly stood from his chair, his head turned to the side, unable to take his eyes off of John Watson.
They finish up and Sherlock begins Rosie’s bedtime routine. “Come on, little bee, up you go,” he says and he lifts her out of her chair.  As they walk toward the stairs, he notices John thinking for a moment as he holds one of the few remaining cards, writes a few words, and then slips the little card into his back pocket.  Ah. John must have finally asked out the new barista at the coffee shop across from the clinic. Sherlock’s grateful he decided against his earlier card-pillow plan.
“She seems more wound up than usual,” Sherlock’s baritone under the sound of the violin sent a shiver down John’s spine. He looked at Sherlock, noting that a year’s worth of age only enhanced his beautiful features.
“Sherlock offered to show me around.” John said, looking at Sherlock and smiling as if that explained everything.
After the last emotional note, Sherlock stood still at the window, violin still in place at neck, breathing in deeply.
Why, why, why did he say that? He’s kept his feelings for Sherlock hidden for years. He needs to clear his mind and then sleep will come.
Sherlock looks at the card again and softly smiles. “I will, John.” Sherlock swallows and looks up into John’s incredible blue eyes. “I am,” and Sherlock prays he’s not getting this wrong.
John finds his friend sitting up in bed with his elbows resting on his bent knees and a dazed look on his face as if he’s not sure where he is. “John? JOHN!” seems to be the only word coming out of his mouth as he looks around the room, tears streaming down his face. “I’m right here, Sherlock, it’s OK.” He waits by the door to not startle Sherlock anymore than he already is. “Breathe slowly.  Can I come near you?” Sherlock doesn’t answer but closes his eyes and tries to control his sobs. Not wanting to embarrass his friend John offers, “Would you rather I leave?” Pushing the heels of his palms into his eyes, Sherlock quickly shakes his head from side to side.
Tom put his hands up in the air. Rosie’s smile got bigger and Sherlock gave Tom ‘the look’. He knew enough not to deduce aloud, but what he could immediately see in Rosie impressed him. He liked this one.
If John weren’t so flabbergasted he’d actually be quite impressed at how well Rosie knew her godfather.
As they pulled up to Baker Street, John told Sherlock he had afternoon plans with Rosie the next day. “Nothing after that, though.” He looked at Sherlock expectantly.
“Which they always are!” Rosie added. Startled, Sherlock looked up and shifted his eyes between the two of them. Rosie continued speaking to her dad, “Sherlock helped solve the suicide-murder cases a few months ago.”
When John comes home from the clinic a few hours later, Sherlock and Rosie are just done setting the table and John scoops up his daughter in a hug and gives her a big kiss on her cheek.  “What were you two up to this afternoon?” he asks, looking between the two of them as he settles a laughing Rosie in her dinner chair.  Sherlock smiles at John as he watches the scene, so grateful to be a part of it even as just a bystander watching. John meets Sherlock’s eyes and holds them a second longer than usual with a smile of his own. Sherlock is thrown for a moment and blinks fast as he starts to serve dinner.
John laughed, “No. I could see myself in an ER, or a combat zone even - maybe I would have joined the army. Somewhere busy.” John picked up a pair of forceps and stared at them. “Somewhere I could help people,” he said quietly.
The morning went by quickly and Molly arrived to help. She helped Rosie put sticky tabs on the plastic knives and hang the paper body on the back of the door. They also froze a plastic glove filled with blue water for the punch bowl that night.
John smiles and slowly winds his arms around Sherlock’s torso. Sherlock hesitantly does the same and tucks his head under John’s chin. John pulls him in just a little bit closer. One leg tangles with another, until they can’t tell whose are whose. They hold each other tightly.
“Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow…” Rosie whispered in John’s ear as he carried her upstairs to their room to put her down for the night.
“You’re a tactile person in bed, John,” Sherlock replies. “If you’re lying next to someone, you want to hold them. It’s instinctual for you. It calms you.”
Mycroft arrived last and John handed him a roll of tape to hang Rosie’s sign. It proudly declared: “Happy Birthday Sherlock!”
“Thanks again for bringing me here. I always wondered how my life would have turned out if I decided to study medicine,” John said.
John pulls Sherlock up until their faces are aligned. They look into each other’s eyes and there’s no hesitation. They meet in the middle.
The lack of sleep (even measured on a Sherlock-scale) is starting to show on the two men. And it’s starting to affect Rosie, who is woken up by her father’s screaming all too often. So John takes to sleeping on the couch once Rosie is down for the night. Sherlock notices immediately, of course, but never comments as John resets the couch each morning.
They shuffle through their day together quietly, not wanting to break the spell. Neither brings up what almost happened in the bed but there’s a comfort to their movements. They navigate towards each other with each step, each small touch, each glance and smile, and when they nap on the couch again later that afternoon, Sherlock’s head is in John’s lap.
Sherlock is the brave one who solves the question by opening his bedroom door, stepping to the side and shyly looking at John. John looks down and breaks into a grin, “Yeah, let me just run up and change.” Sherlock can hear John quickly walk up the steps and exhales the breath he didn’t know he was holding. “Good. Yes, good,” he mumbles to himself and starts to undress and put on his pajamas.
Mrs. Hudson nodded, “You’ve done so well for yourself. Good for you,” and she patted his hand as he took his chair beside her.  He looked at her fondly and then smiled at Rosie.
“I’ll get ice,” Sherlock starts for the kitchen but John stops him. “No no, I’m fine. It’s not bad,” and he stands up, holding onto the wall not realizing the gift bag is still in his other hand.
Sherlock inhales, stretches his legs down, and opens his eyes. He shivers. Not breaking eye contact, John takes the edges of the blanket and pulls it up over their shoulders. Sherlock sinks his head into the pillow a little more and squints his eyes at John, definitely deducing him. John lets him. Sherlock inhales sharply and John feels those eyes look into his soul. The space between them closes. John softly smiles. He’s ready. They’re ready.
“Finally,” replies Sherlock, “she wouldn’t stop chattering away wondering who would give her cards at school tomorrow.”
They lay there breathing for a bit, neither quite settled enough to drop back off.  John opens his mouth several times and takes a breath, but stops himself before he can speak. Finally in a quiet voice he stutters, “Would it be …? Can I …?” Sherlock reaches back, grabs John’s hand and pulls it over his own body.
Sherlock noticed Tom’s feigned normality the entire drive but he refused to give in and make any conversation about the events of Christmas Eve. It was bad enough he let Tom witness his emotions after everyone left last night. Sherlock had berated Tom for not warning him ahead of time regarding their dinner guest and letting him make a fool of himself.  “I invited him to the morgue, for heaven’s sake!” he had moaned as he grabbed his hair and spun in a circle.
There are 57 cracks in John’s ceiling. John knows this because he’s counted them 19 times so far in the last hour. Because now that he can sleep, why would his body let him?
Sherlock turned his head. John didn’t have to think. He leaned in and touched his lips to Sherlock’s. Nothing happened for a moment, then they both began to kiss sweetly and gently.
John looked at her sweetly and said, “Well, we’ll just have to take a picture so she WILL believe you. And please, just call me John.” Mrs. Hudson beamed.
“Obviously,” he sighs and pushes away from the microscope staring at the plates on the table. He blinks and rubs his eyes with his thumb and index finger, “nor can I concentrate.”
John laughs, “Yeah, I can agree to that.” Smiling, he brings their mouths back together and they kiss as they giggle and try to comprehend how much their lives have changed in just two days.  Sherlock wraps his entire body around John’s and whispers into his ear, “I love you, John. Always.” John holds Sherlock tightly and promises himself he’ll never let go.
Six months.  Six months since John moved back into Baker Street with Rosie and the nightmares show no signs of ebbing. There are recurrent images of Mary bleeding out in the aquarium, images of Rosie crying in an empty room for her mother, and as always, images of Sherlock’s body lying crooked and bloody on the pavement in front of St. Bart’s.
Sherlock squints his eyes at Sunday morning’s bright light and looks up at John’s face. The two of them are centimeters apart. Sherlock needs to stretch his legs and shifts a bit which wakes John up. “Don’t go,” Sherlock hears John’s whisper. “Unless you want to, I mean,” John continues. “But if you want to stay, I want you to stay.”
Sherlock paused. He seemed to pause a lot when it came to John Watson. “You’re welcome.” His mind was frantically trying to think of something to say next.
Everyone else looked at them strangely. “Fish,” they replied simultaneously, looking at each other.  Because John Watson is a pescatarian, as Sherlock (embarrassingly) knows.
John counts to five before breaking eye contact and putting both hands on the table and pushing himself up. Well. That’s that. No harm done, really, and now that he tried he can start to somehow deal with his feelings realistically. “I’m very glad you like the book. Good night, Sherlock,” he smiles and starts to leave the room.
As he walked downstairs from his room, he resigned himself to a morning at the shops and long lines. Sherlock wouldn’t have thought to go shopping to be sure they had what they needed to see them through more than a few days. Since the news of the virus began, Sherlock spouted the word, “Bored!” regularly and spent most of his time in his mind palace.  Apparently, the possibility of contracting the virus caused even the most hardened criminals of London to stay inside.
Bolting up, John realizes it’s not his or Rosie’s cries he hears, but Sherlock’s. Loud screams - then silence. He notices it’s still pitch black outside as he sits up in his bed. He waits to see if Sherlock has fallen back to sleep when he hears the noises again, and while they don’t seem to be getting louder, they also don’t seem to be stopping. It’s a steady stream of whimpers. Whether it’s the fact that they shared a nap today or because Rosie’s not there, he doesn’t know, but John finally gathers the courage for the first time to go downstairs and open Sherlock’s bedroom door.
Sherlock had to put a stop to this before John Watson got up and left prematurely. Sitting down, adjusting his flatware he said, “Mrs. Hudson, please do desist with the questions. Let’s leave Mr. Watson alone. I’m sure he doesn’t want to be interrogated the entire evening.” She batted him with her napkin, no offense taken, “Oh, Sherlock.”
Now all he wants to do is bring back the Sherlock who was he was smiling with not even one hour earlier. And if that means giving Sherlock his gift now, then so be it.
John ducked back in and turned to Sherlock, who was completely lost in the music. He was playing as he hadn’t in a long time. He played with passion. Strength. Fervor. John couldn't take his eyes off of him.
“Yes. That is correct.” He managed. “I have always chosen to stay anonymous.  Bad for business to have my identity publicized.”  No eye contact, good. He could do this.
John really wasn’t wearing anything special - just a blue jacket over a bright orange t-shirt, cuffed jeans, and checkered trainers - but Sherlock knew he was staring and had to force himself to look away. John’s hair was a little more ruffled than it was on Christmas Eve but the scruff on his face was still there. John Watson looked amazing.
“I haven’t opened the card yet,” Sherlock looks at John, who slowly sits back down, suddenly about to vomit all over the table. What if he miscalculated? Why did he have to ruin this perfect moment with that damn card?  He bites his top lip and worries his eyes while Sherlock opens the card.
“I know,” John says proudly. “I was glad it was still there when I went back to get it. I hope you like it. Happy Valentine’s Day, Sherlock.” He knows Sherlock hasn’t noticed the little card still tucked inside the bag, but the exchange went so perfectly John decides against mentioning it. Another time, he thinks with sigh, and starts to stand up.
“I haven’t tried to hide it. You just never noticed.” Tom looked a bit pleased with himself and Sherlock sat up straighter and stared at Tom, taking affont at the last statement.
“Sherlock?” He jumped at Mrs. Hudson’s call. “Come play for us, it’s Christmas!” She pulled him into the room.
As the cod started to sputter in the frying pan, Sherlock hurriedly replied, “Yes, yes, that’s fine - we have plenty. However, I sincerely hope you don’t expect me to make conversation with a stranger all night. He’ll be your guest, Tom. Goodbye.”
Rosie was already back to her project, scattering iridescent glitter over a big S. “Mycroft.” She looked pleased with the results, and moved onto the H.
Sherlock managed to respond with, “Yes, hello,” before turning back to grab his coat. “Shall we go? I’m sure you have a busy day planned.”
She gathered her coat and bag and began to leave as John walked toward the back of the lab. She silently mouthed
Sherlock heard it before he saw it. His head shot up, to see Mycroft softly chuckling into his napkin at the other end of the table.
Sherlock gestured to the kitchen, “Yes, well, we’ve taken on the tradition of seven fishes on Christmas Eve, even though none of us are Catholic.  Or ... Italian.” He waved his hand awkwardly.
John was staring at Sherlock’s exposed clavicle when he noticed that Sherlock was staring back at him. He pushed his chair back with a squeak and walked into the sitting room.
“Of course,” Sherlock quietly replies and leaves the bathroom, confirmed in his new girlfriend suspicion from earlier.  Of course John would have a gift ready for his date, although surprising he would choose such a loaded holiday to start off on.  “Rosie’s bear is on the table.” And he walks down the hall to his room and closes the door.
The moment Sherlock saw the box of Valentine cards at the store he knew Rosie would love them for her friends.  Now, sitting with her at the kitchen table watching her slowly write each classmate’s name on the buzzing bee cards with her little tongue sticking out, he’s reminded so much of John it makes him want to tuck one little card away for his flatmate. He won’t. Instead he suggests Rosie write out an extra to her dad. But the thought of slipping a little “Bee Mine” under John’s pillow brings a small smile to Sherlock’s face as he tidies up the crayons.
Sherlock was playing his violin when John walked back downstairs. John smiled as he recognized Rosie’s current favorite song, The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies. John knew Sherlock wouldn’t tire of playing it until Rosie requested a new tune.
“I have no clue why,” Tom agreed. Sherlock hummed to himself as he dipped the first few pieces of fish into the batter and dropped them into the oil. Tom continued, “Anyway, we just found out that her dad has no plans tonight and I was wondering if it was OK if I invited him to come? Rosie doesn’t like the thought of him being alone on Christmas Eve.”
After a moment, Sherlock realized something and said, “Forgive me for being rude. I don’t mean to monopolize the conversation. However, I know you’re a private person and I don’t want to intrude with questions that would make you uncomfortable.” Sherlock was amazed he had held John’s attention for this long without boring him or putting him off.
“Ode to Joy,” John happily sighed. “You know I love that one.” Tea forgotten, he walked toward the window by the couch, the wind gently blowing the curtains inside.
Rosie looked towards the kitchen, “I can’t wait! And thank you for letting us invite my dad on such short notice. I thought he was going to be away for work but he was able to come home at the last minute. He was right behind us in his car, I’m sure he’ll be here soon.”
Everyone said their goodbyes and Sherlock stood off to the side by his chair, receiving a final hug and thank you from Rosie. The Watsons began to make their way towards the stairs, but not before Mrs. Hudson attached herself to John’s arm and requested a walk down to her door. John stood up straighter and said, “Of course!” and led her out. Mrs. Hudson looked back at Sherlock and gave him an excited smile.
Since neither was going to be the one to initiate the conversation, the car ride was uneventful. However, the silence ended as soon as they arrived and the front door opened. Mummy threw her arms around Tom, pulling him inside and handing him over to his grandfather. There was much fussing over snow and long rides and packages being brought in from the car. Sherlock knew his role and stood to the side, quietly, as he looked around his family home.
“What was your most recent, then? Besides the suicide-murders?” John continued. Did John really want to know? His interest seemed genuine, so Sherlock slowly opened up and talked a bit about his work. He described a few cases that were easily explained with the least amount of gore.  John asked relevant questions and slowly Sherlock calmed down enough to hold a decent conversation. Still, he only glanced at John as minimally as possible so as not to appear rude. He knew he was being awkward. He didn’t know how not to be.
Sherlock pulls back the blankets, slides down, and scoots over to the right side of the bed facing the wall.  John Watson, who would do absolutely anything for Sherlock, walks to the left side of the bed and tucks in with his best friend.
“Tomorrow morning sounds perfect. I’m home for a few more weeks before I head back to New York and I can’t binge watch another show or I’ll lose my mind,” he laughed. “I’ll be at yours at 9am?”
“That’s a lot of glue, Rosie,” John said as he looked at her slather another dollop onto the construction paper in front of her. He tilted his head to get a better look. “What are you making?”
