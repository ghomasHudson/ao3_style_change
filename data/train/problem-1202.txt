"Oh and here we go." He giggled and Sherlock could not stop the smirk at the corners of his mouth. "Don't forget your violin." John returned to the bedroom trying to decide how best to divide the clothes.
"Yes! Your perspective and mine. I think it would be an adorable little thing to have written up. Then he can read it himself as he gets older." Sherlock moved to protest and John smirked. "It'll help him look for details in cases."
"Do not try to patronize me, Mycroft. You don't realize what you've done." Sherlock turned back from him, focusing again on John. John blushed as he watched the emotion in Sherlock's eyes change so rapidly.
“John, of course.” Mycroft frowned as Sherlock spoke. “I know she brought him here and I can sense he is close. It makes me glad he is free of the beast.”
"It'll likely be some time before they get anything that exciting." John smirked and they laughed. "Ouch." He sighed, realizing again he was injured.
It took only an hour for Mycroft to finish reading all the correspondence that had arrived and he sighed softly as he tried to discern something to occupy himself without disturbing John. He first attempted to come up with something else to occupy his mind, but found his attention drifting down over the peaceful form of the mender sleeping cuddled against him. He reached down, gently placing a hand over John's chest and smiling as John let out a soft, sleepy contented sigh. He watched fondly as John nuzzled his head against Mycroft's arm and sat quietly simply watching him sleep for a long moment. Sometime later he tensed as he felt the energy of the house shift, a sort of violent ripple tearing through the sleepy peacefulness the house had carried for almost two weeks. It was a clear sign that Sherlock had rejoined the world of the wakeful. He closed his eyes allowing his hearing to dominate his other senses and focused on the sounds coming from the house. He noted the sound of Sherlock slamming open his bedroom door, followed by his hurried footsteps down the stairs and the loud clang of the door to the wing of the house where the mortals they kept lived. The footsteps stormed back upstairs and down to Sherlock's library before returning to his room. Then they turned and began towards Mycroft's wing of the house. He realized that Sherlock was full of rage, his footsteps quick and his energy storming.
"These necklaces what are they?" John mused out loud. He was flicking through the photos noting how Sherlock had stacked them. They reminded him of military rank symbols.
"I am sorry to disturb you, the mender informed me you needed your rest. However he asked that I be sure to inform you of his whereabouts. Lady Elizabeth summoned him just before darkfall yesterday. She asked him to come as her doctor and he went immediately, seeing no need to disturb you in your rest. One of their servants left only a while ago after informing us that Lady Elizabeth is in delicate health however she shall recover, though she has requested John to remain at her side until she does so. He estimates it will be a few days for her recovery and will send us more news as soon as he is able. " She reported dutifully.
Mycroft helped John into the carriage, feeling the arousal sweeping through the mender's body. He looked utterly concerned and somewhat terrified as John looked him over. He was trying to read the look on his face. John knew Sherlock must have said Mycroft would take him in order to force Mycroft to be with him. It made shame flood through his body.
"Come on now my little one," Mycroft said tenderly, pulling John into his arms and offering him the blood in a glass.
"Should I even bother to ask how you know that?!" John turned to him, his eyes dangerous. "So what? You watched me too, with Mycroft? All this time?! You saw how I was..."
"It is not a problem." Moriarty snapped and went to steer John away when a woman came up and grabbed his arm. Sherlock made his move, sweeping his arm through John's and walking him off.
"The visits were my doing." Sherlock sighed and started pacing. John's face tightened as his mouth resumed the tight lipped, straight faced grumpy look he was trying to maintain. More explanations were not at all what he wanted right now. "I was of course concerned about you and how you were getting on after everything. So when Mycroft informed me that some of his surveillance was no longer working due to your lack of leaving the flat, I asked him to begin looking in on you. I needed more information on how you were and whether or not you truly believed I was gone. I needed a way to check in on you without coming close enough to tip off those still lying in wait." John's anger was mounting again. "I had actually hoped you and Mycroft might come to some new understanding in your grief."
“Greg, I need the files for Elisa Monroe, Dominic Argyle, Kevin McDougall, and Jensen, and James Pendergrass. As well as everything you have on this case already. ”John said from where he was reexamining the body. Sherlock looked at John with wide eyes; those were five unsolved cases that Sherlock himself had been studying for many years. Greg seemed to catch on and looked at Sherlock with confusion for a moment, he didn't like the look he found there.
"You're the one who wears all these bloody layers. I don't have the patience for that right now, I have far too much else to worry about." John groaned as the air in the room seemed to evaporate and he found it hard to breath. "Don't worry I brought you a change of clothes to wear
"Yes and our John still refuses him entrance, even now when he is suffering the most." She sighed, coming to rest beside him. "I believe he will not weather this distance much longer."
"That much is true. You will not be able to fight it. However you must use your brain." Mycroft sighed softly. "We will take John Watson into our employ, we will tutor him in the world he is unaccustomed to, and when the time is right we will bring him to our life." Sherlock felt relief sweep through him but it was gone in a moment.
The way that man said his name... John followed him almost helplessly up the stairs and sighed as he turned the oven on. He sank down, watching Sherlock as the detective moved about the flat clearing the table off so they could eat like civilized adults. Not much had changed in the flat in the last three years, with the exception of the toys somewhat scattered about and the fact that Sherlock now clearly labeled his experiments if only so they could be sure Hamish didn't get into anything too deadly. The most marked change however was skull on the mantle was now wearing a small hat which made Sherlock smile every time he looked at it. Hamish had put it on the skull sometime around Christmas the year before and neither of them could bear to take it down. But both of them were tight with silent feelings and the weight of the unspoken secrets resting between them. Sherlock got out plates and silverware while John got them both some water. Sherlock even attempted to eat while John wolfed down a large serving of food. They sat quietly for awhile, content in their mutual silence until Sherlock spoke.
"I ALREADY AM HAPPY!" Hamish whimpered and John tried to quell his rage. "I love him; he is the person I chose to marry. Just because you can't accept..."
“I leave you two alone for five minutes, I swear.” John was laughing though and the three of them shared a family hug just as Greg and Mycroft returned.
"You have been arguing again." His voice was quiet as he could not handle the loudness of it just yet.
“Oh… There is little time.” Moran growled and reined his horse hard, tearing off towards the forest.
“Greg is right, what’s gotten into you?” His voice caught as he looked up into Sherlock’s eyes, which were glassed over. He spoke in a whisper; to be sure they weren't overheard.
"Yes well, I didn't think that part of the plan though all the way, obviously." He replied in a tone that was an attempt at humor, but could not mask the discontent he felt at having to concede he had not been perfect. "It was however, the only means available to me without raising new suspicion. I used his guilt, much as I imagine he used mine. He should have known better." An evil look passed across Sherlock's face but faded quickly. "I convinced him to visit you, to be nice to Mrs. Hudson, even to send Lestrade on vacation. Though I have no qualms about admitting that he chose not to listen to my suggestions about takeaway." Sherlock had said it to be sweet, trying to show John that he'd looked after him even while he was away; but the effect was opposite. John felt panic rise in his chest along with a need to run. His breath hitched as his body contemplated the ways he could escape the amount of emotion he was currently feeling.
"So I have heard, going to blow up the whole place and yourselves as well. Dreadfully bad for business really." The snippy tones passing between the brothers did nothing for John's nerves.
"Our drinks were poisoned." He forced out, his entire body shivering. He felt the way his body reacted, it was an aphrodisiac. John understood immediately, Moriarty intended to make Sebastian betray himself and his feelings for John and use the other to enforce Sherlock's anger.
"My ring…" John grunted suddenly, almost sitting straight up again the techs working on him. The medics looked astonished and forced him back down, though he struggled against them. Sherlock's eyes snapped back to John as he spoke and he moved easily into the ambulance to sit next to him.
"I said not to move." A growl in his ear, darkness of tone, and a clear note of pleasure poured forth from Sherlock as he spoke.
“Speaking of, I forgot to congratulate you lot on your engagement earlier.” Lestrade grinned. “Are you sure you can put up with this for the rest of your life?” He laughed and John giggled.
"No. I'm saying that if you mean a word that comes out of your politically biased, egocentric mouth you will do this because you do actually care about your brother and his happiness. The way you seemed to show when you put me on the path to finding him." John's tone completely changed and it cut through Mycroft's defensives.
"You're a Solvanar?!" He demanded angrily, moving to touch John but stopping short. His anger filling his dark eyes.
battles." Sherlock paused watching with almost pure fascination as John pulled slightly away and unbuttoned the top few buttons of his shirt. Sherlock realized almost instantly what John was doing but his attention was caught by the force of what John was doing. He slipped his dog tags out from under his shirt and slowly forced Sherlock to let him slip them over his head. "John, this is too much." He tried to protest. This was
"That is not a proper sentence, Hamish." He countered and settled Hamish down into his chair. "You two eat and gather what you need to go to the scene of the original crime as I know you're eager to."
"Sherlock, I'm sorry if I was being a git. I was just teasing. I didn't realize you were being serious." John said softly, stepping into the living room.
Tudor England was a sight to see. A society of excess if you were in the right crowds and of deep, crushing misery if you weren't. It was your typical elegant social outing which meant that Sherlock Holmes was bored to tears. His elder brother Mycroft forced him to come along with him, for what purpose he knew not. He was considering the various ways to abandon the entire evening and pursue his own purposes when his eyes fell on a young man that made the blood pound in his ears. John Hamish Watson, the young cousin of the Duke holding this miserable gathering was cautiously avoiding conversation with any of those in attendance. The dark blue outfit he was wearing made him look moderately handsome but he was not interested in attracting anyone. He simply wanted to make sure he didn't embarrass himself.  His family lived on a small farm outside of the main portion of the city and he was not used to large gatherings like this. He was awkward and certainly not as elegant and refined as those around him, so he did his best to blend in. As he moved to a balcony to take in some fresh air he was surprised when he felt a prickle on his neck and turned to find a tall, dark haired man with quicksilver eyes walking towards him. He knew the man was the younger son of the Duke's favorite advisor, to be honest he knew many things about the man though he doubted the man repaid the favor. The two had crossed paths several times throughout the last two years but despite John's efforts he'd never been able to enter into friendship with the man. His pale white skin seemed to glow in the moonlight as he stepped quietly onto the balcony, his dark curls reflecting the light in a way John had never before observed. All in all he was striking and John could not withdraw his gaze to save his life.
"I can feel your need, the need in both of you." John whimpered, his eyes closed. Mycroft shifted out of his sleeping clothes and his under things so the three of them were naked in the bed together. John perfectly between them.
"You don't scare me Kitty. Because you're just a girl... A girl with a grudge because the boy she liked had eyes for someone else." He was being incredibly stupid but just now he didn't care. If he might die why not speak his mind?
"It always does," He said gruffly, giving him a tongue click as he let his mind come back into the waking world. He opened his eyes, letting them lock onto John's with his intensely passionate and yet hidden need burning into John's soul.
"I have no intentions of ever belonging to anyone else." His voice was a whisper. His mind told him to go to bed before he pushed himself further than he was ready for. "Goodnight Sherlock." John pushed him up, kissing him one last time before they moved up the stairs.
Instead he watched his face as Sherlock gently reached out to touch his chest. He moaned softly as his fingers softened and followed every line, every muscle, and every scar. Trailing over every inch of his skin he could reach. He watched as John's mouth parted under his touch thoroughly enjoying as he melted under his fingers. John's eyes slid closed and he released himself completely into Sherlock's touch, the effect of which was so beautiful to Sherlock that it took all he had not to run. Not to flee from the vulnerability they would share if they continued on in this relationship. He decided however that if John was going to put himself on the line, he wasn't going to stop until John said to. Sherlock's fingers danced over his body like they did the strings of his violin: learning every creased, every indent, and every mark. He varied the touch from feather light tickles to a deep sensual pressure as he worked. His eyes and hands taking in all they could as he worked.
Sebastian laughed as he appeared behind the mender. John too distracted to stop him. He sank his teeth deep into John’s neck, holding him tightly as he struggled. He drank eagerly and before long John went limp in his arms. He growled at Anna, motioning to the man that had brought John to them.
"Alright then we can take Hamish to the dentist and then we can head out there." Sherlock countered a smirk on his face.
“While that may be true, especially when it related to the things you might say, I do not think calling on me while he has been away this past fortnight is necessarily the best choice you could have made. It certainly does not provide me comfort, given the circumstances of our last meeting.” He kept his voice calm, but his fight or flight mechanisms kicked in, making his muscles tense. Mycroft frowned, and then let out a soft sigh when he saw how rigid the others’ body was. After a moment he let out a forced breath to clear his mind and allow him to focus, his mask of anger shifting to reveal something softer, vulnerable, and anxious underneath.
"It is my brother..." He didn't speak, instead the words sounded inside John's head. He shivered in Sherlock's grip. "He has told me I must let him give you rebirth."
"You aren't upset that I still have feelings for her?" He asked it in a whisper, more feeling and watching for the answer than listening.
"Hush mender, in time..." Mycroft purred in his ear as Sherlock restrained the struggling mender's arms behind him, tying them tightly with a length of rope.
"Let's be pirates!" Hamish demanded. "Please Daddys?!" John looked back out the windows, the rain had started again. That would be trouble and it meant they would need to keep the boys occupied if they wanted any sanity, so he jumped up out of his chair pretending to look affronted.
" Mycroft's voice reached him as he lay back on his bed. He felt his mind slowly becoming his own again, the blood easing the feral creature within.
“Oh I do not believe that is entirely true.” The voice was suddenly right behind them and Sherlock shouted as something pierced his skin.
“What has happened to my wife?! What have you done to my Elizabeth, John?!” Moriarty demanded darkly, though he was quick to realize no one believed his words.
"Hamish and I had settled down in his room to watch a movie so John could get some sleep. Just about ten minutes in I heard a loud crash. I heard John shouting at someone and I realized he was trying to convince someone that he was alone in the house. I figured that meant trouble so I picked Hamish up and took him down to one of the unused rooms and we locked ourselves in a closet. It took them about an hour but they found us and they hauled us out. One of the men pinned my arms in place and they took Hamish away from me. He screamed and screamed, trying to bite and kick at them. Eventually one of the men gave him an injection of something, I think a sedative. John came flying down the stairs in a rage when he saw that, he managed to take out two of the guys before this big tall man walked up and backhanded him so hard I thought his head might come off. He started cursing him out, shouting about how he was going to cure him. John was just revving up to fight the man when the guy behind him pistol whipped him in the back of the head and he went down in a heap. Then the idiot with the gun on me hit me with the butt of his gun and they hauled John and Hamish out of the house."
“There is caution in your words." Mycroft said softly, crossing his legs and placing his fingers together in front of his chin. His eyes burning into John's. "There is more to this story than you are telling us now." John sighed and looked at Mycroft as if appraising him for a long moment.
"You're horrible, I've married a horrible man." John giggled again and he kissed Sherlock. "Seriously though, we have work to do and if you irritate Mycroft too much we won't have anyone to watch Hamish."
"If you insist on continuing to apologizing for the very thing I need from you, I may have to punish you." Sherlock said with a smirk. He pulled back so he could look in John's eyes but was still close to him.
"For Gods' sake, yes, Sherlock, yes!" John snapped, he was so tired of the sparse hospital room. His nerves were fried and he was tired of how the room reminded him of things he wanted to forget.
“I told you when I returned you were not to put a hand on my mate. As you cannot control yourself we shall be leaving at darkfall.” Sherlock’s voice was soft but dark.
are you doing?" John crossed his arms again stepping into the room and giving off his very best 'this is not okay' look, Sherlock sagged a bit with a pout.
"No it's okay. You have to still be you." John smiled. "But you still have to sleep and eat." John scolded slightly but in a much more playful tone.
"I don't guess." He whispered in a firm tone, but a smile played on his lips. Relief was sweeping through his body as John eagerly and easily teased him.
“Alright… I’ll call and see what I can do John.” Greg stepped off and flipped open his mobile, pacing away from the two of them and sighing.
“Not now. I want to see and touch you. I want to make myself realize this is real and not another fiction dreamt up during my imprisonment. The rest we have time for later.” His voice cracked again as he continued to touch Sherlock’s face and shoulders.
Sherlock pulled John into a slow, passionate kiss just before Anthea knocked on the door. John opened it and stepped out. She smiled fondly at him, reaching over to gently push a piece of his hair into place.
"Thought!" John hissed as his hands shook against Sherlock's chest. John felt the panic again. A desperation clawing at his chest. Sherlock realized what was happened and pulled John to him holding him close in a tight embrace.
"I have been incredibly stupid." Sherlock said forcefully, standing and moving almost in one motion so that he was right against John's body.
like that. Interesting thought Lestrade. Thank you." Sherlock sat forward putting his fingers under his chin and returning his full attention to John. Lestrade just shook his head. He knew that Sherlock's attention was gone.
"Oh it's all because of you! You have been indispensible in the last few months John. What would I have done without you?" She laughed. "You should be dancing with your husband." She scolded him.
have found leads on the second sniper." Sherlock's attention returned immediately to the room and John's heart sunk slightly. So that was the real reason. Sherlock back to work, back on the case of Moriarty. He set his cup down with a loud clink and the stood. Without a word he walked into the kitchen.
Sherlock sighed and lay John back down. He removed his coat, sweeping it off of himself and draping it over John like a blanket. He then set about the flat, turning on lights and the heat. Surveying the rest of the information he needed to catch up on what had happened for the last year. He came back and picked up the cardstock letter from John's chair and was surprised to see it contained so little information. All it said was: Don't give up, you know the truth. - The Woman. A sign of solidarity to a man who was broken. His eyes flicked over John again, a whole host of feelings trying to crowd into his mind all at once. The chief of which was grief. He'd known that this would hurt John, but he'd never expected to see him cracked in half like this. He moved the things from John's chair and sat down, steepling his fingers in front of his face and focusing on the information. It had to be true then. The things the two of them left unsaid, the feelings that had driven him to show his sorrow enough that Molly had caught it. The things that had driven him to setup this whole plan. The man he felt utterly devoted to in a way that he'd vowed to never feel in his entire life, was destroying himself because of it. He walked over to the kitchen and rummaged around. He was still looking for something when Mrs. Hudson came up the stairs.
“The investigator described the blood found at the scene as having two distinct characteristics. The first, clearly the blood of the mortal woman found there, was just beginning to coagulate when they arrived, that is part of how they were able to determine the time she died. The other pools of blood were dark black, only enough to have clearly come from defensive wounds, thus showing the blood of the killer. When shed from the body, vampire blood behaves in certain characteristic ways, including turning black shortly after exposure to the air. As it had not yet hardened the time frame fits and the killer was not injured enough to have stopped him or her from moving about in the daylight.” John replied conversationally, he flicked through a few pages of the document as he did, trying to ignore the piercing gaze that was bearing down on him.
. You did not realize how much I care for you." Sherlock said softly, pain on his face. "Which implies I have not done well enough showing you." He sighed as he ran his hand up through John's hair. "I have never had a talent for expressing matters of the heart and things relating to love. Honestly I never thought there was need to do so, as no one ever garnered my interest, though many did try. It was not until you that anyone succeeded in stealing away my thoughts so readily that I can scarcely recall the moment my life was signed over to you. You are so much more than you allow yourself credit for. You have suffered and survived from the moment of your birth. Darkness has sought you to be its' companion and yet you have refused it, instead bringing your light to those who would revel in the darkness for lack of knowledge of what it is like to walk in the sun." John blushed and looked up into Sherlock's eyes, reading his emotion there as he inhaled the scent of his mate.
"John, what the hell is this?" Sherlock finally demanded, his face tight. He didn't know John spoke fluent German, he didn't understand why John was being so compassionate towards a man who'd attacked him, and he was definitely not enjoying the feeling of not having the upper hand in the situation. John clearly knew this man and was speaking German to him on purpose. Which could only mean that John had more secrets he hadn't shared with him. It irritated and infuriated him. Lying was one of his biggest pet peeves. "Who is this man?" He narrowed his eyes as he tried to deduce the answer for himself, not watching as John tried to direct his attention elsewhere.
. Drinking both of those glasses and aiming to drink mine as well... What would we have done with you filled with so much lust?" Sherlock let his fingers flutter down over John's chest, enjoying how he moaned in Mycroft's  mouth.
Anthea reported hearing stories that John touched Sherlock with desperation, taking any moment the two were alone to mark and claim the other. Small letters began to make their way to Mycroft, tucked inside folded cloaks, slipped into his pocket at dinner, or else somehow hidden in a plain to see the spot that he would have to find. The letters were from John, detailing a great number of his internal thoughts and feelings. Including that he forgave Mycroft for what had transpired and felt he understood better why Mycroft was lead to acting as he did.
you safe, John." Shivers ran through John's body, both from the feeling of Sherlock's voice and breath on his ear and from the terrible fear that seemed to awaken in his bones. He swallowed hard and tried to find his strength, tried to find the resolve that had disappeared from him for so long.
"He is not hurt my little one. He is fine. Oh I am so very sorry, my John." He purred, cradling him gently as he moved quickly towards his room. Anthea was waiting for him when they arrived and she helped settled John down into Mycroft's bed. "Anthea, ensure Sherlock is covered and place some blood wine near him for when he finally comes out of this brooding of his. That will be enough to get him down to feed. John will remain with me until Sherlock has proven he deserves his husband again. Please bring him some clothing from his room and leave it outside the door."
"I love you John." Sherlock stood and picked up his phone, preparing to move into the living room and make the call he knew he needed to make.
"Oh Hamish, love..." John whispered and he took Hamish from Sherlock. He cuddled him close rocking him.
"He is rather occupied at the moment and I am quite loath to disturb him. I do appreciate your concern however and I am quite sure he would offer you the same compliment were he available. I am rather curious however as you have yet to respond to my several entreaties seeking satisfaction that those who brought this darkness to him have been properly handled." Mycroft propped his elbows on the desk, crossing his fingers under his chin. He kept his eyes soft but his guard was raised.
"A Solvanaar crest would not allow Moriarty to continue to control her mind. I had doubts about my own control since I have reunited with you my loves. I have researched and explored the abilities of the necklace and found that any mental control is removed when the necklace is placed on. Elizabeth could in no way be acting under his orders in this moment. If that is not proof enough for you look at her face. Her eyes betray her emotion and her concern with none of the details of a lie hidden behind. Her body is trembling with fear as she prepares herself to accept rejection instead of hope." Sherlock's eyes went round and turned a deep blue as arousal began to sweep through him.
"After..." John sighed and looked down, as if expecting Sherlock to goad him. "I learnt after you left. I missed the sound of you playing and Baker Street felt so empty without it. So I bought a violin and used the internet to learn to play. I sort of thought it might upset you so I didn't think to bring my violin with me, but when I looked over yours last week I realized I couldn't bear to touch it myself to practice. I talked to Lestrade while we were at the Yard last and asked him to bring it the next time he came out this way."
“You had… To be safe.” He grunted, forcing himself to ignore the pain. “Protect them.” He ordered Gregory, meeting his eyes. Gregory could only nod.
"You sound like such a prat when you say things like that. Those idle minds paid our bills for quite awhile."
"How long has he been at the Moriarty estate?" Mycroft demanded and Anthea answered as firmly as she could.
called Moriarty with her information that saved us in the pool. Well done on that, Mycroft, by the way. I don't think I ever gave you credit for that. Though we had the situation in hand."
"You are an absolute imbecile!" Mycroft shouted and John raised a hand. Mycroft was shaking with rage and John sighed. They were like children the three of them.
“This is only the third night.” John said quietly, pausing in his writing to look up at the other. Mycroft realized in that moment that John knew nothing of Sherlock’s warning and it inspired a dark feeling of possessiveness that Mycroft had considered himself above.
"I have wanted to come to you for months, brother. I have desired to explore our bond so much more than we have previously been allowed and yet I could not allow myself to enjoy your flesh when I could not worship that of my mate." He whispered. Mycroft watched as Sherlock slowly moved, leaning forward and kissing him heatedly.
"While I was… away." He whispered his reply. "It kept my mind busy... It... Made me feel better," Eyes searching for meaning behind the questioning.
“How could I?” John’s question was bitter but valid. “They will not rest until the seize upon some way to feel they have regained control. There is no way this time. I shall not let fear consume me as it did before and I shall not ever allow Sherlock to fall into Moriarty’s grasp again.” His eyes flashed in the low light of the nearby torches and Gregory could not help but think he looked deadly.
“I keep my work separate from my homelife.” Gregory responded curtly and was clearly frustrated. He ran a hand over his face. “I would not ask if it was not important.”
John slowly woke because he felt like something was buzzing in his ears. He did not open his eyes for a long moment, letting his hearing take precedence. He could hear the footsteps of others above him, the sound of voices chattering away about nothing, and if he was not mistaken even the sound of the rain falling outside on the sidewalk. The bed felt different against his body, the elegant robe Mycroft had given him was soft and delicious against his sensitive skin. The pillow brushing his cheek felt strangely rough in places but soft in others. He could smell Sherlock and Mycroft, though their scents were faint and further away than he expected when he first woke. Each breath brought smells and tastes into his awareness until his brain seemed to be spinning with effort. He groaned softly only to find that two very different touches fell on his arm and back simultaneously.
“I almost threw you over the table in our room this morning, John.” His eyes flashed. "You were so damned..." But what he was, was lost as he groaned under Sherlock's work.
John was sitting in one of the wide window seats, staring out and watching the snow fall over the grounds. He was thinking over his and Sherlock’s plan to move in the Spring and wondering if the string of vampire killings was enough to sway his mate into choosing to remain. His thoughts were obliterated however when he suddenly was pushed down into the cushion of the seat and Mycroft’s lips were on his. His muffled noises of surprise were drowned out by Mycroft’s insistent actions and before long John’s mind was awash with the heady desire that his sire/fledgling bond with the other was built on. Mycroft pinned the menders arms above his head, running his mouth all over the other as he began to peel away the shirt and trousers the other was wearing. He lost himself in the sensation and growled when John tried to speak.
Sherlock led the way swiftly through the two streets that separated them from the actual warehouse without a single word. The smell of molten metal burned in their noses and covered over any other scent as they moved around the edge of the building to find a way in. Sherlock motioned to a door ahead and pulled a lock pick kit from one of his pockets; the door was an easy lock to get passed and within moments the three of them were swallowed by the darkness within the warehouse. There were yellowish flood lights dotting the hallway bathing them in a strangely ghastly light. Directly in front of them was a wiry metal staircase. Sherlock motioned for them to be quiet and they ascended the stairs. The metal frame wrapped around the top of the building creating a sort of wide loft in the warehouse, a few feet passed the top of the stairs they were able to see into the wide open warehouse below them. The scene down in the warehouse was like a bad horror movie: a bright white spotlight shone down from the second floor down onto the center of the room below, and centered within the patch of light was John, still tied to the chair and clearly not doing well. Their vantage point was too far for Sherlock to make out much from his position, but he was able to gain a little information: John's eyes were open, his was tilted head back, and Kitty was straddled on his lap with her attention focused on her hands. He couldn't clearly see what she was doing but they could hear the soft din of her talking and the random insane giggles she let forth. About ten feet ahead of them a guard stepped back from the railing, shifting in his boredom. His attention was fixed on the warehouse below, clearly expecting a frontal assault by Sherlock. Sherlock motioned to Lestrade and Donovan to wait where they were and he moved fluidly and silently behind the guard. With a few short martial arts moves he disabled the guard, catching the man's body as it crumpled and lowering him to the floor. Donovan looked at Lestrade with wide eyes, her pistol shaking slightly in her hands but all he could offer was a shrug. He knew Sherlock was dangerous, now he had proof. They continued on ahead and watched as Sherlock repeated the pattern four times and disabled all the guards. There was no staircase down on the left side of the warehouse so Sherlock motioned for Donovan to remain there and Lestrade to return back towards the way they had come in. Meanwhile he himself descended the staircase directly behind the spotlight. He moved silently into the shadows to the right of John and Kitty, taking in the scene before him.
was in the picture John was insignificant and didn't matter. And now he was chasing ghosts again while he was left alone! How easy it must be for Sherlock to brush him aside! The bitterness that had surfaced after Belgravia gnawed away at his stomach making him feel a host of things he'd thought he'd dealt with. Sherlock had almost completely cut off their relationship after that, saying that having anyone close was dangerous. It had taken John months to get him to relent and accept his help again. This felt like a kick in the stomach.
"Let the ghosts go to rest." She blinked back a tear and straightened up. Her phone gave off a text alert which she checked and sighed softly. "Time to go to the ball," She whispered blinking back a tear. She walked out the door and into a waiting car, turning back to look both of them in the eyes before speaking. "Goodbye John Watson and Sherlock Holmes."
"It's not John. We couldn't have known she would get in that car and we were clear across town." His voice was soft, his tone the one he reserved for speaking to his family. "You have been so strong through all of this, tormented as you tried to help her, your loyal heart fighting against everything including me. Going through our separation, seeing her do so well and then fall back into hell, and then to lose her… To see it end this way is destroying you. Please, John, talk to me." Another kiss pressed against John's ear and neck.
"I simply do not care, John. This is trite and boring. Please may we return home now?" He begged. John turned to see that Elizabeth was sufficiently engrossed with her displeased groom and glowing father so he conceded.
John amused himself by working the cases with Sherlock, when he could keep up; and by studying all that the mortals were learning of science and medicine when he could not. Many times, Sherlock would dash off on a case, leaving John rooted to the spot on the crime scene – seemingly vanishing into thin air only to turn up later shouting that due to John being absent from Sherlock’s side the killer had five extra minutes before capture. It was on an afternoon such as this, that Gregory and John found themselves in a comfortable silence, sipping some blood wine, while John looked over the details of a previous case and Gregory waited for Sherlock to return with answers. No sooner had Sherlock swept up the stairs, grumbling about the cold outside than the view outside the window became obscured by a wall of white. Snow, which they had not expected but which seemed to be hell bent on blanketing the world. Gregory started up from his chair, hurriedly tossing his jacket over his shoulder before John put a firm hand on his arm.
Neither knew how to explain it but suddenly Baker Street felt alive and thriving. The cool silence melted away as the flat filled with the golden glow of life. The life of Sherlock Holmes and
Sherlock hoisted John up, ripping his dressing gown open and pinning him violently between the wall and his body. He slammed his hips into him, growling as John moaned and writhed. Sherlock knew John had been writhing under Mycroft for hours, but he was still so tight and so very needy. The arousal pouring off John built and swirled in Sherlock's body until he could think of nothing else but the warm heat surrounding him. He growled in possessiveness, his primal instinct to mark what was his blooming and raging in his chest. He furiously claimed John again and again against the wall until John shouted and released so hard he almost passed out. Sherlock followed soon after, managing a few more pumps of his hips before filling John and collapsing against the wall. John's legs slowly sank to the floor, but he clung to Sherlock to keep himself standing. Both of them panting and staring in each other's eyes in silence for a long time.
"Still out but will be fine. We almost lost both of you because of your foolish sentiment." Mycroft said it tersely but it was far softer than usual.
"John please. Please my love," He pressed his forehead to the door. "You are in pain. I can feel it!" He pleaded, pressing himself flat against the door. "Please my John."
When they arrived to the overly large affair, John stayed close to Mycroft, the two of them looking down from the balcony at the happy pair celebrating their impending nuptials. John’s body vibrated with his emotion as he tried not to think about how happy Sherlock had been when they were preparing their own wedding and instead focused on surveying the room. His attention was drawn back to Sherlock however when he paused and looked straight up at John without so much as an ounce of hesitation. The feel of Sherlock’s eyes on him nearly shattered the mender completely and it was only his dedication to his Sire that kept him rooted in place. Sherlock’s attention was returned to James for a moment, when the shorter man returned to his intended’s side and spoke softly to him. Sherlock however turned his attention back to the mender and began making his way towards the pair on the balcony. As John realized Sherlock’s intended path he hesitated before stealing away down the hall and to the outside. Sherlock arrived on the spot just a moment after John disappeared around the corner and frowned as his brother turned to address him.
John whimpered, utterly unable to move. Simply writhing under Mycroft's work. He buried his fingers deep inside John's ass, scissoring and moving them until he was whimpering with need. Sherlock alternated between focusing on himself and letting his wicked tongue work on John's cock before Mycroft finally motioned to him. It took them some time but they arranged it so John was pinned between then again. John's cock buried to the hilt in Sherlock and Mycroft almost panting as he buried himself inside John. John shuddered almost violently when they both were seated in and on him and then groaned as they both began to move. He clawed Sherlock, his hands the only thing responding to his control as they drove him to a new realm of bliss. Every single touch, every breath, every sound felt so different. He felt like he wasn't even inside his body anymore. It was surreal. Sherlock's moans in one ear, Mycroft's groans in the other. They all vibrated in his body, forcing his own moans to become lower and more feral. He was desperate to release but fought it with everything he had, he fought it to keep feeling this incredible sensation. Mycroft let his lips find John's shoulders, growling with John as he nipped and licked a path up to his ear and back down again. Sherlock leaned back, moving his hips so that he drove John into Mycroft. Mycroft pushed back, alternating Sherlock's rhythm so that John felt like he was vibrating between them.
"It is morning, Mycroft. But let's wait and see if it turns out to be a good one." John's voice and face were both tight with emotion and meaning.
"Yes?" Sherlock's back was tense but his voice was soft, John realized he was preparing himself for a critique.
Ah, so they'd reached a point of John's feelings. Obviously the visits had irritated John just as much as Mycroft. Also apparent to Sherlock was that Mycroft's behavior had not been any better than John's in the most recent series of visits. Sherlock paused as his mind absorbed the details of the scene before him.
“My apologies Lord Moriarty, I have had much business to attend to and a gravely sorrowed coven to care for.” Mycroft’s tone was curt Sherlock looked at him with a furrowed brow, pulling his mask up to see his brother better. Mycroft looked away and when he looked back it was to find that James had already escorted Sherlock away.
"You were so brave Daddy..." Hamish whispered to John, snuggling against him. "I'm so…sorry they hu...hurt you."
"Look, I wasn't trying to upset you. I know you want him to stay beside you for work and I know why you're doing it. I know what it's meant to say. I know it's meant to be a sign to the world not to mess with John Watson because you will get the violent end of Sherlock Holmes' temper. But maybe you could get him a necklace or a ring or something. Something a little more permanent that doesn't equate to you hurting him or remind us all that you two are shagging each other senseless," He finished his coffee and looked up at Sherlock.
"And I was hoping the rain would strand us out here all night.” He flushed slightly as John's eyes met his again.
“No matter his intentions, his desire is clear. He wishes only to possess you, not to care for you. Please my love.” There was such an earnest look of adoration in Sherlock’s eyes that John could have melted.
"You enjoyed watching me drink of him, did you not?" John demanded, groaning Sherlock's name. Sherlock moved slowly, painfully slowly - drawing out John's torment. "Sherlock!"
A few hours later there was a soft knock at the door. Molly appeared with Greg and a tray of food. They set down the food and Molly handed Sherlock a bag.
“It is because of you that I was able to come home.” He finally forced out, their eyes still locked. John’s face contorted in confusion and Sherlock smiled softly.
"That's rather ambitious of you." He snapped back, fighting back a laugh. Why was that his comeback? Was his brain that addled?
"A letter arrived just before dawn from the Holmes family. It seems Lord Mycroft wishes to tutor you and employ you as one of his assistants. They have asked us to send you with all of your things to take up residence at their estate, today." John's gaze swept around the room as confusion filled him. He had not expected such a request so suddenly. He had expected to be required to remain at home for some time while going to train. Though this was a much preferred reality.
"I know you want to touch me. It's driving you mad. You keep holding back though," John whispered, putting his hand on Sherlock's. "Don't."
“I knew he felt danger and that he felt there would be grief and darkness for us all,” Mycroft replied, anger burning into his features. Anger was comfortable and easy; anger gave him a foundation. Part of his soul had been ripped away by the Mender’s loss, how could Sherlock so easily dismiss that. He stood ready to battle his brother if need be, however, Sherlock’s rage only grew.
"Yes." Sherlock came over and started tending to John's cut cheek. John grunted. "He isn't the murderer he's a potential victim. He will be in the main house, Georgie has a secret code she told me about in the letter she sent. He's going to give her the password. We'll know right where he is."
John walked with her downstairs before taking a deep breath and walking out the door. He dodged through the reporters, noticing again that Kitty was watching him with a strange look on her face. He made it past the reporters and though he didn't need one he hailed a cab, instructing the driver to take him past the grocery and further away from the flat. The reporters didn't follow him and he sighed with relief when he got out of the cab about five blocks from the grocer and began walking. Back at Baker Street, Mrs. Hudson jumped when an envelope slid under her kitchen door. She picked it up slowly and opened it, wondering who on earth would do such a thing. She hoped it wasn't another of those hateful letters they'd received after Sherlock's 'death.' It was unlabeled beige cardstock envelope with a simple single piece of paper inside. The note said simply: Do
"I do, Lord Holmes. I realize how terribly I injured my dearest cousin though I understand how you may believe otherwise. I have received news through my servants who have spoken with yours in the markets and other places to learn the whole of the knife I so carelessly wielded. I have sought out the details of the depths of sorrow that I brought your family with so careless intention.  Only the fear I am experiencing would draw me to even attempt to beg forgiveness from my cousin now as I certainly am not deserving of receiving it. John," She turned to him, her eyes full of dread. "I do not feel safe. I do not feel well. I beg of you, please help me in the final stages of this pregnancy. I fear that my husband is some how desirous of an end to this pregnancy without the birth of a healthy child."
" Mycroft mumbled and stood, he paced over to the window. He could not face John like this, with so much sentiment aching in his chest and John's attention fully fixated on Sherlock.
"Will you join us for Christmas?" John asked hastily as he stood up, blushing a bit. Mrs. Hudson beamed with pleasure as she looked to him. Sherlock however paused, a paper in front of his face blocking everything but his eyes. He didn't know why but in that rushed, simple, and yet somewhat needy question he'd been fully reminded of John's tenderness. Of the very thing that Sherlock himself lacked and yet so desperately needed.
“Home Office has informed me that one of the people of interest in this case has been buying several items of note especially considering that they may soon have a captive in their hands.” Mycroft's voice was tenuous at best. "Am I to believe that John is willingly going to put himself in mortal danger?"
"H-harder." He barely breathed as he forced out the words, shouting when Mycroft replied with his actions. Sherlock met John's mouth with liquid heat and the two dissolved into the fire as all three of their bodies sank into the desperation for release that burned like white hot metal between them. Sherlock could do nothing but follow the pace set by his brother as Mycroft enjoyed the feel of claiming them both.
Back at the flat John waited until he heard the front door close before allowing himself to express anything he was feeling. He sat on his bed, looking out the window and sighed heavily. His face and body were tight with emotion as he struggled with jealousy, anger, and fear. So he did still care about her. He'd suspected that when Sherlock had asked about the card yesterday, but he'd… What? He'd hoped that Sherlock would let her go? He snorted in anger. He was being stupid. Whenever
"Ja! Natürlich!" Hamish exclaimed proudly. Sherlock looked like a sudden mix of feelings were boiling through him. He fixed his full glaring gaze on John as his eyes broke him down and studied him. Greg would never get over how
"Why do you keep him away?" Sherlock demanded, looking at his brother with confusion. "He fights me for hours to gain such little time with you, he endures my anger when he returns, suffers through so much to gain my favor to care for you and now I find he has been suffering for not." Sherlock's features were tight as Mycroft looked at him.
"I've kept a weather eye on him, Sherlock. He has his own flat now and a girlfriend. Mary Morstan. If his recent behaviors are any indication he intends to ask her to marry him tonight." Mycroft said softly, handing Sherlock a file. He enjoyed how his brother's eyes darkened and he tightened.
"This isn't something you can be prepared for Sherlock. The types of things you felt for her and for me are not something you can ever prepare for. It just rings the bell, says welcome to your new life, and you," John smirked. "Get up and follow some crazy detective off on some wild adventure and hold on to what you can. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you wanting the cards she has been sending to us. There is nothing wrong with wanting to keep them close at hand to remind yourself of whatever lesson you felt you learned from her. But there is a
Sherlock sighed softly was he pushed open the doors to the shaded balcony. The sea was just beyond and he enjoyed the view immensely. He smiled when James entered the room, but frowned when James gave him a strange look. It had been ten years since their wedding and they’d already moved twice. Sherlock walked closer to James, reaching for his hand and flinching when James hissed at him. James for his part was enraged. The herb had taken away Sherlock’s spark. It rendered the man’s mind slow and made him miss details. James no longer cherished his possession and instead kept it only to continue to see John suffer. He grew tired of trying to keep Sherlock under his power and had resolved to take himself away from Sherlock as often as possible.
"I believe the choice is not mine to make if I am honest. I have yet to speak with her since this entire incident began and I promised to be her physician." John said softly, as he stood and dressed. "However perhaps you two could be convinced to accompany me?"
"He is where he belongs, left behind. Forget him. You're never going to see him again." Marcus growled and stepped close to the cage. "I've arranged it all. A new identity for both of you and beautiful woman to be your bride, you'll be happy."
"Sherlock," John said in a hoarse voice. He motioned for the cup but Sherlock refused to give it to him. "Do not drink it..." He stood and stumbled. Sebastian grabbed him, helping him up.
"Yes, I can feel fear that I know is not my own." John's voice was soft, if not for Sherlock's improved senses he would have had to lean in to him. "Fear that can only be yours. It is this bond is it not?"
John began to shake and a loud series of noises downstairs prompted Meaghan to usher Sherlock from the room. She quickly refastened the silver around John’s wrists and neck, finishing dressing him just as her father burst into the room. He smiled predatorily at the mender, enjoying how broken the man looked.
“It is to be expected,” Gregory replied before the others could speak. John turned to watch his love, noting the tightness in his face.
"Through the hunter of course. A week later the hunter returned to the city with three guards and Lord Moran in tow. Lord Moran had himself seen the evidence of the hunter's story of his healing by looking to his blood memory. He had come to Summer straight away as he himself was quite ill. He beseeched me for my assistance, promising me all manner of rewards if I would accept his offer. He offered the type of rewards that made my young mind hazy with desire. However before satisfactory arrangements could be made between Sebastian and my uncle the full affliction took him and he became gravely ill. I worked diligently to cure him, despite my uncle's continued protests and spent the better part of a week caring for him and sharing my blood with him." Sherlock growled darkly and jumped up, moving to pace through the room.
They remained in Paris for only another week because Sherlock was far too determined to know what it was that John was hiding. In fact he denied John any physical comfort until they were preparing to return home, using their bond to get what he wanted. When they returned home to England early it surprised Mycroft. Mycroft was however pleased to see them and if he was truly honest especially pleased to see John, as he'd found he'd actually missed him.
"Yes, Sherlock," He motioned to a small black bag inside his clothing bag. His voice betrayed his frustration.
"You're the Pirate Prince." Their eyes were both wide as they just stood there for a long moment in silence. Their breath shaking their chests as it moved in and out.
"I didn't know, I observed." John giggled and Sherlock shot him an annoyed grin and clicked his tongue. "There's a bit of pink on the inside of your left wrist, I spotted it when you scratched your nose in bed." He grinned . "Now go and apologize."
“Gods to have you here… To see you look at me and remember me.” John forced out, his voice cracking. He gently raised one hand, cupping Sherlock’s cheek as their eyes burned into each other’s, and Sherlock felt his mist over.
"So you came home and wrote on your blog." Sherlock whispered, encouraging him away from the moment of the fall.
and he would do everything he could to protect him. Sherlock turned to look at John just as he'd finished his deductions and John blushed. Sherlock looked over his face, clearly contemplating John's lips with desire. John cleared his throat as his thoughts were snapped back to reality by the lift opening to the first floor and the sound of reporters trying to shove past the police barricade. John scanned the group of reporters, freezing when he realized Kitty was among them. Kitty was shouting something but he couldn't make it out over the din of the others.
"Yes. Now if you don't mind I think I have told you everything I know and I would desperately like to shower and rest." Jacob looked exasperated and Sherlock nodded.
“I have only been trying to find the right moment to approach you again. I appreciate your letters in response to mine.” He looked down at the small envelope in his hand. “I have done a lot of thinking and I worry about your safety as much as for my mates. Before we left London I contacted my Grandmother to see if you and Sherlock might be granted a Solvanaar shield. Unfortunately, the metal that is used to create them has nearly all been used and there was not much left. Of what remained, however, she did send me two rings, one for Sherlock and this one for you.” He handed the envelope to his Sire, watching as he removed the gold ring and looked over it. “I hope that you will wear it, no matter what may happen, so that I may always know you are safe.”
"Just let go." Sherlock whispered, moving so he could kiss John's jaw and nibble his ear. "Let me see how I get to you." His voice was part commanding, part pleading. It had been so long since John had even wanted someone to touch him like this and the fact that it was Sherlock wasn't helping his resistance.
. He paled as his attention came back into the room his eyes burning into John's as he did. John's brow quirked up in confusion as Sherlock's gaze and full intensity of his mind settled onto him, but Sherlock didn't speak. He waited for a long moment in silence as Sherlock let the pieces slide back into place, trying to sort out how to best approach the food argument.
"Well, you seem to have thought it out at least." Mycroft paced a few steps. "Alright Sherlock, if anything I can say for certain that John Watson's loyalty to you has and will never waver. It is not what I ever expected to have happen but I would be happy to stand beside you as you commit yourself to John." A rare smile graced Mycroft's face and Sherlock actually returned it. Lestrade was surprised.
“I must keep making money so you may continue to practice your ridiculous experiments.” He chided again.
"I cared for him as much as I was able, Sherlock. He refused my care! His entire being was focused on you!" He growled, their eyes burning into each other's.
"Oh listen to him brother, he likes this." Mycroft's voice was dark and thick with possessive arousal. "He likes seeing you pinned between us, gasping like a whore." He rolled his hips forward again, forcing Sherlock forward into John and enjoying their joint moans. Just like this it was terribly easy for him to own both his lovers.
“Distance will injure him…” Mycroft replied, he’d just gotten the mender back he was not ready to see him out of his grasp.
"This is a rather nice isolation chamber, isn't it?" John asked quietly as he walked through the living room.

"But you watched me, the only person who brought any sort of normal back into your life; commit one of the gravest acts imaginable." Sherlock sighed, looking down. "You watched me be defeated. Worse you watched me be defeated by myself. "He looked back up, forcing John to meet his eyes. "To you I was untouchable. Nothing could faze me. Then you watched as I fell all over myself because of a
“I have prided myself the whole of my life in never holding the smallest of affection for another outside of my own family. It was on the whole the mark of my character and I was quite proud of the reputation it gave me in court. However I came to find that I have never in my life met someone so amazing as he. I want nothing more than to spend the rest of eternity at his side, learning to understand this fascinating creature.” John blushed and Sherlock smirked as he turned back to let his gaze burn into his lovers. “I ask you now for his hand, however I shall endeavor to kidnap him should you say no.”
They rode with Greg to the crime scene. When they arrived Donovan nodded to them and let the three of them in. Anderson sighed and turned away from his work, walking clear across the area to a van and sitting down. The scene was an alleyway, not to wide - maybe a single car could fit down it but it was littered on both sides with bins and rubbish. A young man with sandy brown hair lay sprawled out on a pile of trash bags. He was well dressed and looked well kempt. He was wearing a button down under a short black jacket. A single gold necklace with a snake twisted into a figure eight was his only accessory. Black slacks with no signs of wear, and polished black shoes completed the outfit. He was maybe twenty five.
where the card was. He also knew it meant something more. Mycroft continued watching John closely for another minute as they all fell silent. He was surprised at how far John was willing to go, even now, to keep things peaceful. How it hurt him more than anything but he kept his tone even, his emotion from his face as Sherlock turned to survey him. That he just accepted that Sherlock had lied. Even Sherlock seemed somewhat surprised by it.
"He loved me, this is his vengeance." Kitty snarled, drawing Sherlock's gaze back to herself, her voice becoming dangerous.
"Daddy?" The little boy’s voice cut through John's thoughts, and he looked down into the confused eyes of his son.
"Your body is dying my love," Sherlock's voice was soft, like a whispering wind in his ear. His long fingers dragging across John's back and making him moan loudly. "It is both dying and yet being reborn. Close your eyes." John did as he asked and he moaned even louder. The sensation of touch magnified thousands of times.
"I didn't want to hurt you. A certain amount of time was necessary so that you would begin to move on and others would believe it was truly over." Sherlock's voice was still soft, but his face hardened some again. He didn't pull away, wanting to show John he was trying. "I was going to leave England, go somewhere new and try to build a life without..." It was unspoken but felt. Without
"Oh Lord, you're serious aren't you? You only call me Greg when it's serious." He sighed and ran a hand over his face. "If he died would it kill you?"
“Oh my mender…” Sebastian cooed darkly in his ear as his used John’s hand to pleasure himself. “I have to have you.” He growled. John grunted against, but his mind was too far gone to understand what was happening. Sebastian maneuvered them so he could slam himself inside the menders pliant and broken body. John let out a loud shout of pain, but did not fully wake. Utterly unaware of how Sebastian was violating him. “God yes… You are mine. You will dream of this in your darkest moments and when you come to me for the answer I will claim you as my own.” He growled, his body tightening as John’s body responded to his touch. He hissed John’s name in his ear as he released hard, deep into John’s body. He lay there panting, holding the muttering mender in his arms. He reached down and stroked John hard and without finesse until his body shuddered and released. He enjoyed his handiwork as John went completely boneless and the darkness claimed him.
Sherlock did not allow John to remain at the Holmes manor for much longer, following Mycroft’s attack. Instead he pressured the other into moving into the city, to the rooms that Mrs. Hudson had mentioned when they had seen her in the city last. However, the short time they remained at the coven house had been nearly disastrous to the other members of the clan. Somehow, however good came from the incident as John and Gregory were both at the mercy of the Holmes anger for each other, and through that found a sort of bond that grew into a strong friendship. Though John refused to tell Gregory anything that might sway his opinion that Mycroft was anything but a good man. Just as soon as the snows relented enough for a carriage to travel the roads, Sherlock uprooted himself and John taking them to Baker street.
sorry to disturb you two," She shouted through the door, "However you have not fed in three days and there is someone here to see you."
John carried Hamish gently up the stairs, Sherlock brooding silently behind him as they went. He settled Hamish down on the sofa in their room, retrieving a blanket from the closet and the stuff parrot from the memory box. Hamish clutched it tightly muttering that he loved them before he curled up in the blanket and sank to sleep. John sighed and went to say something to Sherlock but he was already curled up in a chair by the window, his hands and mouth moving the way they did when he searched his mind palace for connections. John rummaged a bit to find clean clothes and then moved into the bathroom, he turned the shower on almost scaldingly hot and stepped out of his clothes. He slipped into the shower and leaned against his arms, letting the water pound over his body. His mind was racing over everything he'd said earlier, his body tight with anger and anxiety of years gone by. He shouted when he suddenly felt arms around his waist.
“I had no idea he intended to put himself in harm's way to stop Moriarty.” Mycroft’s answer was soft, his eyes focused on the desk in front of him. “I knew he was planning something…”
“Here, take a little of my blood.” He ordered, pressing his wrist to John’s mouth. He groaned as John drank but he was too weak to drink more than a small amount before his body went limp again. He was on the edge of life and death, his body pliant in Sebastian’s arms.
I was." John sighed and realized that "case mode" had returned. Sherlock set the book back down and John looked over the stack of pictures Sherlock had reorganized.
"It is. You are telling me you need me to be here with you. You're telling me how to prove to you that I really want to share this with you. You're telling me you need
"I'm not dying, it's a cold." The response was mechanical and did little to soothe Sherlock's nerves.
"I might have said that then, just like I did when I was seventeen..." He sighed himself. "But it's not true, Mum. I did want you in my life, I just wanted to be accepted for who I am."
When Sherlock and John finally returned to their guest house the next afternoon Greg chuckled a bit at the sight of them. John's scarf just barely hid the hint of the two dark purple bruises on his neck. Two bruises Sherlock had been insistent on making longer lasting and that effort resulting in them spending the entire morning in a sweaty, disheveled heap in the Gardener's Cottage and missing Mycroft's departure. He looked positively calm and content as he strode in and scooped Hamish up just as Hamish ran to them. He seemed to have an abundance of fondness for all of them at the moment and it was just as unsettling to Greg as his impatience had been the day before. John was blushing a bit and avoided Greg's gaze. Hamish hugged Sherlock as tightly as he could with his little arms, desperate to keep him close.
"Alright, fine I'll speak in English if it will help me get into Georgina's care faster." Jacob sighed and sat back. "What do you want to know?" His accent was thick even as he spoke the words in English and Sherlock sighed softly with contentment that he would at least be able to understand things this time. He would regain his edge and thus be able to protect his family better.
"Do any members of the Order support Marcus?" Sherlock asked quietly as Molly handed John a cup of tea. Sherlock shifted Hamish from one arm to the other before Molly came over and took the boy from him with a sweet smile. Hamish snuggled against her and she walked over and sat down on the couch where John resumed his seat and sipped at his tea.
"Maybe to you," John smirked slightly but Sherlock didn't soften. "Sherlock, I'm trying to be patient with you. I'm trying to give you space and let you be who you are, but if we're going to share this love…"
"Oh, I've thought of that already. Angelo has a small room he uses for private situations. He's going to have it prepared for us before we arrive." A small smirk toyed with the corners of his mouth, but his eyes fixated on John's every movement.
"I think I should ask him when we're alone. Am I supposed to ask someone for permission or something?" Lestrade laughed again.
"There may come a time when you must. Danger is near, John... You are mine. Though there are others around who have their attentions on you."
"My cousin, my beautiful cousin I beg you for your forgiveness. Please John, please take the knife from my heart that I so easily allowed to be placed there. How I must have injured you when last we spoke! How little I knew of the truth!" She began to shake with sobs and confusion lined John's face. He pulled her up and guided her to the couch, sinking down beside her.
"Yours." Sherlock growled back, his breath washing over John's cheeks as he kissed over them. The urge to drink from John grew in his chest but he fought it, knowing John was not ready for that step. Their lust spiraled off the other, building in their bodies.
was utterly clear as he drew himself up to full height in the flickering light of the fire in the stable. The woman and her accomplice both froze in place - her naked and mounted on John and the man dragging a knife blade down John's chest. Their eyes went wide and they turned to make an escape before freezing anew.
“No, however, his actions and the look you bear now are enough for me to guess an old threat has returned.” His voice was cold and focused, something John could appreciate at the moment.
"It's hard Sherlock. You've been busy with the cases and that last one, with the girl who could have died..."
“We needed some place private to discuss things and well we did just get engaged after all.” Sherlock’s grin was full of mischief.
"John?" Sherlock's voice was soft, he knelt beside the bed and gently, almost timidly reached out to touch his lover's cheek.
John gave in, letting Sherlock’s possessiveness take over. Sherlock’s desperation to claim John now that Mycroft was gone. It was rare for Sherlock to feel so incredibly possessed of the need to mark John as his, the bond between the brothers and their mender was often equal on all sides. However something in Sherlock demanded this satisfaction now and he was not going to let the opportunity pass him by. He kissed down John’s body again, pushing him down into the mattress as he took John’s length into his mouth. John shouted and arched, the sensation sparking through his body like flames.
"I know, it's one on my father..." John growled and Sherlock's face tensed into an almost Mycroft like sneer.
"You disarmed her when I didn't even know she had a gun or that you had the ability to that. You're definitely not the man I imagined you to be John Watson." He leaned in to kiss him.
," Mycroft purred, instantly drawing John's gaze. He ghosted his hands over John's body, listening to him moan. "You become far too possessed of your lust in this state for us to continue to allow you free reign." He whispered darkly, grazing his teeth over the shell of the ear of the squirming mess of need that John was quickly dissolving into. "If you want the relief you desire you will do exactly as we say."
“My children would not go against the law of nature!” Marcus spat angrily. “You stopped being mine when you chose to defile yourself by being with him. Why John? Why did you give up the beautiful women you had in your life? That last woman, Mary…”
"Always." John promised as Mycroft kissed him again. Mycroft kissed him for a long moment before pulling back and waving that he should go. Enjoying the rumpled look of John's hair and clothes.
So they had time, good. Sherlock tensed and moved to say something else when the man Mycroft had been speaking with at the party strode in through the door with Georgina and Jacob behind him.
They arrived at Pendergrass Estate just before nightfall and were welcomed by three servants. Two of them took their things to the large four bedroom guest estate and the other led them into the main house. The four men were looking over the inside of the house when a voice called and all of them turned almost exactly at the same moment to face the owner of the voice.
“I knew no different John. Due to the false memories I was in a mostly blissful state of ignorance, nearly free to roam and explore the world while you were chained, bound, and beaten. While you were here withering away as Mycroft neglected your heart and soul. I…” Sherlock slid his hand into his hair, a dark look in his eyes. “Watching what Moran did to you even for only those few years we were together there made me insane with rage. I wanted to destroy him for touching you and every act he forced upon you nearly made me snap. I do believe…” He sighed, coming back to sit down next to John again simply because he could not bear to be so far away. “When he took you, the power of your experience is what allowed me to start mind-linking with you again. Suddenly I had this onset of nightmares, plaguing me because the man in them was being tortured and trying to stay so strong despite his heart being shattered into dust.” He looked down, watching as John tentatively took his hand. “Once we arrived and I saw you, I knew you were the man in my dreams and that you were someone I should have remembered.”
With that Mycroft let Anthea escort him out of the room and Sherlock pulled a trembling, weak, and mostly sleeping John into his arms and cradled him like the most precious gem in the world. For that was what he was, the most magnificent jewel in Sherlock's nocturnal crown.
“Very well, you may go now.” Sherlock said sternly before fully turning his attention to his beloved and watching how John was responding to the situation at hand.
"I am well fed and strong, do not tempt my jealousy now." He warned but he kissed John again all the same.
“Your mouth should be criminal.” John smirked, chuckling softly. He leaned down and kissed Sherlock, slowly beginning to toy with his quivering opening. He nearly gasped when Sherlock spread his legs wide and nearly ground down on his finger.
His mouth and hands were all over his lover’s body as he removed his clothing. His lips finding purchase on John’s neck, chest, nipples, suckling on his hips, and threatening to devour him whole. The intensity of Sherlock’s desire burned in their bond and swirled around the two of them until they forgot everything but the moment. John whimpering and pleading as he tried to remove Sherlock’s shirt with shaking hands. Sherlock growled, grabbing John’s hands and pinning them behind his back as he kissed him until he was panting.
Sherlock was taken by surprise when John moved so he was beside Sherlock instead of in his lap, however he allowed the mender to guide his body down against the bed. John gently began kissing him, timidly at first and then slowly growing stronger as he found he could stomach the motions. John could not explain how the desperation rose in his chest to cherish his lover with physical expression. He'd felt the pull of their lust before and been chilled to the bone by it, however now it burned like a fire in his chest. It grew as Sherlock went pliant under John's hands, allowing John to direct their actions and the speed with which he undertook them without expectation or fear of judgment. Sherlock let John explore him, watching with curiosity as John let his thoughts come and go.
"That's because I wasn't physically able to touch you the way I wanted to for quite awhile after the hospital. The whole bullet through the abdomen situation really puts a damper on things." Sherlock was now slowly, painfully slowly unbuttoning his shirt, clicking his tongue as he explained things. "Then we were so busy with cases and Hamish that I simply didn't have the necessary time to worship you the way you deserve." The shirt finally fluttered to the floor as Sherlock set his and John's phone where they could be reached if absolutely necessary. "But I'm tired of waiting for this moment and I'm not going to let you tell me no or tell me that you should be the one in control. Not yet, not now." His words were tinged with some dark sentiment - annoyance or determination but John couldn't tell which because he was already so damned aroused by this. More than he should be. Sherlock was unhinged and it had taken all of his concentration to make it to this very moment, there was no way in hell John was breaking him out of it. "Keeping secrets... Lying to me..." Sherlock muttered, his eyes flashing as he slowly undid his trousers and slid them off. "Putting yourself in danger, yet again... This whole case has shown me that you are in need of some serious disciplining, my little Captain." John grunted with sheer arousal as Sherlock narrowed his eyes on him.
“Why do you shy away from me?” Sherlock demanded angrily as he came closer to James. “I am your husband.”
"Seeing John respond as he is I must wholeheartedly agree. His insistence on acquiring your time in order to have you investigate this situation over the last three weeks begs some intrigue. It was not enough for him to allow you time to contact him, when he knew you had suffered so terribly.
“Today is the anniversary of the day you gave me your life.” He whispered, shoving their mouths back together for another fiery kiss. “And now I have time to cherish you properly.” He growled, clawing John’s shirt off.
"Yes, Sherlock you may take me to dinner tonight." John smiled before pulling Sherlock to him. Their mouths met for a heated kiss, John taking dominance as he pulled Sherlock even closer against him. He wound his hands under Sherlock's shirt, pushing it up so that he could access the whole of his back, causing Sherlock to moan in such a needy way it shot straight to John's groin. The kissed deepened as they struggled slightly for control of the moment. Sherlock gently digging his nails into John's back - his tongue darting out to dance with John's.
"What did you just say?" John looked at him, raising an eyebrow. The two of them dissolved into hearty laughter before John just shook his head.
"Are you ready John?" Mycroft asked quietly and John simply shook his head. "Answer me." He growled, digging his nails into John's ass. John shouted and moaned.
"I need you John. I've needed you for too long and I've held back, you told me to stop but I didn't. I couldn't…" He growled, lowering himself down and kissing John again. "Now I can't stop myself anymore, not know that I realize everything that you have done for me; now that I truly realize all that you are." John grunted as Sherlock clawed into his chest, kissing him again. "Now that I finally realize you are the only one
“It is my fault the coven wishes to harm us.” Sherlock said quietly, his lines clearly practiced. “So it is my fault we seek asylum.”
"Sod off." John's voice lacked it's normal anger as he spoke. He simply curled himself into the couch more. "I don't want to visit today. I don't care anymore. So please, leave."
"I have to stop him! He's making a mistake." He shouted as Anthea brought him his coat. He threw it on his shoulders and tore out of the room.
. "Because, Sherlock," He said his name with a huge wave of emotion behind it, "I don't know what the
"I went out this morning to work in the garden, we are not due to travel to France for some time and I wanted to ensure the house was well prepared for our absence. When the sunlight fell on me I fainted and woke here in this room." She sighed as she shivered.
There was no sign off but they didn’t need one. It was the message they had been expecting for awhile. The message that John knew Sherlock ached for every time his phone chimed. John didn't even try to hide the blush or argue with the fact he'd been the one given the hyphenated name. That was likely to be how it would work after all, he was the sentimental one. John cleared the notification, barely noting that it came from a blocked number and musing over whether or not Mycroft would try to trace it for just a moment before turning his attention to Sherlock. He had not expected the conflicted look on Sherlock's face, so easily taken aback by the emotion that the detective could no longer hide when the two of them were alone. He looked afraid, as if waiting for some expected reaction from John. Sherlock's eyes burned into John's face reading and deducing every inch of him to find an answer to the question burning in his mind.
"Obvious, trite, and boring," Sherlock snapped. Her hand trembled on the pistol grip and just as she focused herself to fire she shrieked, a gunshot ringing out through the building. Kitty dropped to her knees, a bullet hole through her right leg. Donovan tackled her and pinned her
"Well that is quite the right moment for me to interrupt I believe." Mycroft smiled but it came off as somewhat dark, his attention turning to John's father directly. "You see Lord Watson it has come to my attention that my younger brother has rather taken an interest in your only son. As my brother has spent the whole of his life choosing to ignore the attentions of others this makes your son rather important in the scheme of my brother's life. Naturally that makes it of utmost importance that I work with you to secure John's hand for my brother's taking." John's sister smirked just slightly, hiding behind her handkerchief as Moriarty glared at John. Her pleased smile was the only one they got, instead his mother looked livid.
“Alright bloody hell has frozen over or I died. Which is it?” John demanded but Sherlock only smiled.
“It has been some time since you were seen on your own, is there trouble?” Mycroft ask softly, standing and walking closer to the desk.
“You did not inform me this case was so blatantly obvious to be solved, I have wasted away an entire afternoon on nothingness.” He snapped, before beginning to spout off the details of the entire event.
"My... Mycroft..." Sherlock panted, sinking down so he braced over John on shaking arms. His voice tight and desperate with need, tinged with disbelief as the desire rolled through him.
“You are home. You came back… You are mine!” Mycroft growled against his lips. Losing himself quickly in the lust of John’s aura and the knowledge the mender was home.
"You can so, since we’re coming too." Greg called from the foyer, hanging up his coat as he and Mycroft entered the flat. Mrs. Hudson easily produced two more chairs motioning for the new arrivals to join in breakfast. "Special request sent to the Yard this morning, not to mention the letter Mycroft got a dawn.” Greg yawned, running a hand over his face. “What's going on here?" Greg crossed his arms but his sternness didn’t reach his eyes.
, John's mind reeled. He clawed Sherlock to himself the two of them clawing and pulling at each other as they kissed and Sherlock worked John over. Sherlock leaned up and growled as he raked his nails down John's chest leaving trails. He could feel John's body clenching around him, how tight he was, how close to release he was.
"I bet your body feels like fire right now." She laughed but her voice had a teasing, sing-song like quality to it. "If he doesn't come to get you soon he'll miss all the good parts." She mocked being concerned but giggled again. "That'll be a shame – if he misses the moment you cease knowing yourself."
"I..." There was that pained look again. A look that showed the torment of Sherlock trying to accept what he was feeling and let himself be okay with feeling. "I really do not deserve you John." John almost groaned at the softness of his voice but couldn't stop the noise from escaping when Sherlock lifted his hand and gently cupped John's cheek. It was such a tender movement and it melted whatever anger and sorrow John was feeling. His breath hitched as their eyes locked together again, but he did not at all agree with Sherlock's opinion.
"Yes, I've come to stay for the whole weekend." She said brightly, cuddling him closer. Your Uncle sent me to bring your Dads some things. He sent me with a lot of paperwork for you two. The portfolio contains pictures and information on the bodies you were looking for, along with all the reports for the most recent case." She blushed a bit.
"If... If I..." Sherlock's throat was stuck. He was trying to warn him, to make sure he really knew what he was saying. John almost laughed at the effect he was having on the great Sherlock Holmes, but stifled it so Sherlock wouldn't think he was joking.
She was just a bit shorter than Georgina with unmistakable sandy brown hair and eyes that flashed slightly. She came in cautiously, reserved even as her eyes immediately moved to John and didn't leave him. Her face was tight with emotion but relief spread in her eyes and her mouth twitched into a slightly smile. John stood up and cautiously walked towards her, reaching out to gently touch her arm. Their movements were hesitant, which Sherlock registered as a sort of test. It was plain to see
Originally John had put forth an effort, believing that Mycroft was doing this out of some sick sense of guilt over Sherlock's demise. He'd made sure every time that the flat was clean and neat, he'd clean himself up and make sure that he did his best to bite back any stupid comments. But after almost nine months of the incessantly annoying prying into his mental health and personal life, he'd stopped caring. Then when things... fell apart again... He gave up. The last visit he hadn't even gotten up and turned on the lights. He didn't really have the energy to right now. He didn't care. He just wanted to be let alone to rot. Then he heard it.
- Hamish's elbow had a scrape the exact height of the first knob on the bamboo near the hedge maze -
"Are you ready to learn to mind link?" Sherlock asked John softly one morning, as John slowly pulled himself awake.
"That seems to be something you're exceptionally good at, misinterpreting others intentions." John's eyes burned into Mycroft's but neither revealed the true depth of their emotion. "But no it won't happen again because she's resigned herself to die. But
Their words fell away as John kissed back up Sherlock’s body and claimed his mouth at the same moment his pushed a third finger inside of his lover. Sherlock quickly felt desperation to have John claim him boiling inside his chest, the presence of Mycroft earlier having touched on his deep-seated uncertainty about the mender really being able to tolerate him for all the ages of the word. John was only too happy to oblige, and it did not take long before John sank into Sherlock with all manner of noises. He snapped his hips back and forth hard, so hard it knocked the headboard into the wall, as he held Sherlock’s hands pinned to the bed. They worked together, feverishly, for several hours before collapsing into a heap and passing into a deep slumber.
"Es tut mir leid, aber ich dachte du wärst jemand anderes." The man said softly and let out a huff of air as he stepped back away from John. "Es ist schon eine lange Zeit, Johnny." The man sighed softly again and sank down in a chair.
"Oh..." He said softly after opening and closing his mouth a few times. "Well I suppose I did something right then." It was a weak reply but he did not have anything better to offer. His mind already rife with the possibilities that lay before him. As soon as this very evening he would be with his beloved, permanently.
"You'll know when you go through my phone later, like you always do." Sherlock huffed and John giggled.
"Be that as it may they are no longer welcome in my home for any reason and should they choose to darken my doorstep their safety is not my concern." Mycroft growled.
"I know your heart, my love. You would not allow any such programming to remain." He forced out, his breath shaking as it left his chest. "I... You did not..."
Bear with me as we move forward here, I have most of the next few chapters outlined (and we will meet some other friends in the next few chapters) I just have to get the time to sit down and write them.
"Don't worry about it John, it's all taken care of. Three hours and you'll have all the answers you need." He grinned as he lead the way onto the train.
"I'll be fine Sherlock." John smiled softly, looking him over as Sherlock gently put his hand on John's injured arm.
“You heard my words.” He growled almost daring Mycroft to interrupt him. “I have seen from his memories what you have done to him. Though he is too kind to see the torment you wrought. I saw how at every turn of this horrid affair you have betrayed his trust and his heart. You abandoned him to his grief, to his darkness, and then to Moran’s devices. You swore to both of us that you would protect and care for him, that you treasured his heart, and you are nothing but a liar.” The darkness in Sherlock’s voice was so powerful that a momentary flicker of fear passed through Mycroft’s eyes. “Your words mean nothing and if it was not for the fact that I know that his recovery requires safety, and the best safety we have for the moment is here, I would take him and leave this instant.” His voice was low, dark, and full of anger. “You have your mate now, mine will be free of your torments.” He turned crisply on his heel, nearly shoving his back into his brothers face before heading quickly for the door.
"I'm listening, pet." Sherlock grinned, purring in his ear as he leaned down to nip at John's neck hard.
"I'm afraid you may be right but don't say it to his face. It'll make him get that smug smirk he likes so much." He looked like he was thinking about something and John easily recognized him putting pieces together. He turned to look at Elaine and smirked. "You gave John the letter, not Georgina." She blushed a bit. "Even though I sent it here."
"Oh you are so tight... Give in to me." Sherlock demanded as he kissed over to his neck and nipped at it. John arched unintentionally and pushed Sherlock inside of himself with a loud curse and whimpering.
He had to concede the point. Mycroft was right. Becoming a sire to a fledgling meant losing whatever ability one had to read their mind, but the thought of Mycroft taking John's life made Sherlock feel darkly possessive again. A growl playing on his lips. Sherlock swept from the room, his anger filling him as he did and Mycroft simply sighed watching him go. This was a dangerous time for his brother to be giving in to sentiment, however if this was truly his bond mate... Well he would be stronger in the end.
"Jesus Sherlock," John grunted, clawing into his back as he continued to lathe kisses and nips up and down John's neck. "Why have you waited so bloody long?" John's voice was desperate as Sherlock bit down hard, he groaned and shouted Sherlock's name.
"H-how?" John groaned, trying to claw at his chest. James kept his arms pinned and nuzzled the spot where John's necklace should have been, causing violent panic to rise in John's stomach. His eyes went even wider.
“You and that mouth.” The other purred, pulling Sherlock back towards the bed and pushing him down on it. He began removing Sherlock’s trousers and undergarments, taking his time as he did.
"My son? He's our son." Sherlock's smirk widened as he sat up, easily shifting Hamish in his arms as he did. "Hamish, big boys take their medicine. If you do what your Daddy says then I'll even let you watch one of your terrible cartoon shows." Sherlock said firmly, bargaining with the little boy. John laughed himself silly for a long moment before Hamish answered.
"Because Marcus Watson has been a determent to our organization for too long and this time he has gone too far. Attacking a child. He has been staying in one of the orders older safe houses. Jacob knows where it is and he will go with you. Because John Watson was the most beloved nephew of my late lover James Pendergrass and I will not let the evil inside of his father consume him or your son."
"I made oaths to you... I've broken them." His voice hummed against John's chest and John whimpered again. "Look at you..." He purred, releasing John's arms because he knew John would hold them in place on his own. His nails flicking across the other nipple. "I've made you feel like I don't want you every moment, which isn't true. It's woefully distracting and utterly debilitating." He hummed again, kissing lower - down over his abdomen.
"I'm sorry that I didn't tell you what was bothering me. Mycroft's sudden appearance wasn't helpful." John sighed.
"Weally Daddy, you’ll let me?" Hamish's eyes went wide as he looked up at Sherlock in awe. John watched as the little hand found its way to Sherlock’s and simply melted the aloof act Sherlock was putting on. He watched smiling at the two of them as the detective leaned down and kissed their son on the top of his head, inhaling that soft sweet scent he carried.
“Anna, it is good to see you are well.” He said as firmly as he could. She could see the shadow in his eyes.
“Coming Sebby.” He lilted. He got up and kissing Sherlock’s head like a child, he stroll from the room.
"Something like that." John sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose and looking down. "I have to move on Sherlock. I can't keep chasing these ghosts. I had myself believing for awhile that you weren't really dead. That you'd waltz in one day with that stupid smile on your face, your coat collar turned up, and expect me to just pick up where we'd left off. But it's been two years. I can't..." His voice cracked slightly and he looked down. He felt insane, talking to the shade of this man in his mind.
"You want to drink of me..." John said softly, searching Sherlock's eyes. "The rumors are true are they not? You are one of the undead, a vampire?" Sherlock was surprised because John sounded interested not afraid.
He returned to the library and found the darkest corner. Folding himself into a small ball he tried to focus as his mind fought against the blood memories of the wounded mender. He put his hands in his hair, gripping it tightly and tried not to scream at the sensation of so many emotions overwhelming him.
“John!” Mycroft gasped, dashing over and slowly surveying the mender. “What happened?” He demanded as he tried to lift John.
“James?” A man’s voice called. James couldn’t stop his predatory grin as the younger Sebastian stepped into the room.
“Oh God…” John laughed, smirking as Sherlock made a face at him. John held up his hands almost in surrender. "I'm not taking credit for a word that comes out of your mouth on this."
- Weight - down at least twenty if not thirty pounds. John wasn't eating. His PTSD and depression were devouring him from the inside. He didn't care about his health because he felt he had nothing left to live for.
“Where is your father?” Mycroft’s tone darkened considerably as he realized that Moran was not with her.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!! All of you! For your kind words and constantly asking me when the next chapter would come out and to not abandon the story. Every time one of you wrote I was able to get a little more done on the story. I am going to try to get the next chapter out quickly, especially since it should be full of fluff and porn - but I make no promises.
making contact is significant with what you already know?" John's voice just barely masked his feeling as they discussed Irene Adler, The Woman. Sherlock however actually felt his heart flutter slightly faltering a bit before recovering his calm demeanor. He'd forgotten what it was like to have someone who actually tried to keep up with him.
"Thank you John, that's most kind of you – but I have to decline. I've only come by for a moment." Mycroft turned to Sherlock watching him closely.
"There's two keys, you need them both to open it." He replied softly, reaching over to touch Sherlock's cheek.
"So at ten years old you bottled up your truth and became the man your father wanted to see. You trained yourself to like women. Then when faced with a man who stirred your desire you vehemently pronounced yourself to be 'not gay' and went on as many dates as possible." His hand slid up over his shoulder and onto his cheek, cradling his face.
lips. He shook his head and ran a hand over his face, determined to not let Sherlock off easily just because they shared such chemistry. No, he felt like Sherlock was implying he was helpless, something that though John felt was the truth he desperately didn't want Sherlock to believe. Above all he wanted Sherlock to see him as strong and capable. He wanted to erase the memory of how pitiful he must have seemed the night before, lying on the couch in the dark. His shame became anger however, so he channeled it slamming around his room as he placed things back in their rightful places with loud thuds.
"You have such an excellent command of the task, I would hate to interrupt you." It was clearly an attempt to tease but it riled John. He turned and abandoned his task in the living room, instead moving his bedroom. Before he could fully register the switch Sherlock was on his heels, following him into the room.
"Mein Vater, natürlich. Shite," John stood and moved away from Jacob slightly. "Gehe zum Herrenhaus. Nicht mit mir streiten, Jacob." John snapped when the man moved to protest. "Gehe zu Georgina und sagen Sie ihr ist der Schlüssel im Schloss. Sie wird Ihnen helfen."
"John sit down before you pass out again." John sighed as Sherlock gave him a stern look. Mycroft smirked slightly as John easily complied. Mycroft passed John a cup of tea and he took it with a nod.
” Sherlock’s voice tore through John’s mind as a series of crossbow bolts tore into him in rapid succession. Some remaining lodged others passing through him, until he collapsed. One hand loosely closed around Sherlock’s ring.
"Sherlock, come here." Mycroft called from the hallway and Sherlock growled but obliged moving to speak with a doctor. A nurse came in and fussed with John. Sherlock returned a few minutes later and then growled when a nurse came and drew blood from him.
“We are safe here, Sherlock. Do NOT do anything to compromise it!” James screamed at the taller man, his eyes dark and dangerous. “If you have a thought in your mind of approaching anyone here dismiss it at once! You will remain in this room unless I send for you. Do not ruin this, or else I shall destroy you.” He turned on his heel and marched from their room, Moran at his side.
"Let them talk." He looked right at John and winked, smiling the smile he only gave to John. John looked down a little embarrassed.
The four of them ate in relative peace, Mycroft dismissing himself first and the Lestrade shortly after. A small smirk playing at the corners of Sherlock's mouth as he turned to survey John fully. They were all alone in a fancy restaurant, John had some concerns.
“Make the blood pact or I shall give you nothing but death,” John growled in return. Moriarty clenched his jaw, clearly debating his options. He shook his head slightly, his thirst growing and an overwhelming pace.
"When I said later, I meant much later. Potentially never, really." Sherlock said calmly, in his normal tone. He didn't even look up at the Detective Inspector as he came to a rest near him.
"Listen to the poor thing. He has never had a woman until now, he is so large. I see why they all want him. He is filling me so full! He is utterly helpless though is he not? He has no reasoning to understand the feel of a woman's body around him." The woman's voice was cruel, a sharp gasp of pain and a low keening moan escaping John as she giggled. Sherlock tensed and prepared to launch himself into the building as they heard John shout loudly, his voice was hoarse and full of pain and tears. Mycroft was only just able to secure a hold on the back of his shirt before they both froze. Nothing could have prepared the Holmes men for the rage that swept through and swirled around Sebastian as he barreled full force into the stable, the doors flying off the hinges and into the room. That he was one of the
"I am honestly surprised you didn't shag me on the train, with that much pent up energy." John shifted, reaching down to undo the ankle cuffs.
"Hush." He commanded and he kissed down John's body to take his erection in his mouth. John shouted and arched under his careful attention, his body trembling.
"Ah," Mycroft said quietly and John slowly let his eyes open to see the slight blush on Mycroft's cheeks. "That is my fault. Since I gave you my blood while I was feeling arousal it will make you rather susceptible to what is called 'blood passion' for awhile." He cleared his throat. "It should subside by the time you and Sherlock return from your bonding in Paris."
"I missed you as well, however I was well attended to." He smiled. Mycroft leaned down and claimed his mouth in a powerful kiss, grinning as John whimpered softly.
"As you wish, brother." Sherlock said quietly and helped John up. He balanced John's weight against himself as he led him out of the study and down to feed. John looked between them with clear confusion, however his mind was sluggish and slow to respond allowing Sherlock to easily guide him from the room.
"Some of that writing looks like Sherlock's." Greg exclaimed in soft surprise as he leaned over looking at it. John felt a protective urge well up in his chest and he moved the book just slightly. Greg smiled warmly and sat back, but John blushed.
"Better this year, yea?" John smiled. Someone knocked on the door and Lestrade opened it to reveal Sally carrying in a tray of food.
"Yes, a date." The click of the tongue. "You know it's that thing where two people who like each other go out and have fun." He retorted impishly, not able to stop his own smirk from breaking free.
"She will be perfectly fine, John. I will ensure she has every precaution needed. You still do not seem to realize that
"The sons of the Solvanar usually fall prey to the strength of the vampiric nature of their heredity. They are usually sent to reside with other, elder males of the Solvanar lines. The descendants of the city of Solvanar. They are instructed and guarded so they do not given in to the power of the blood hunger within their bodies." John finally looked down and Sherlock felt sorrow he knew belonged not to himself but to his beloved. "That is why I am considered dead to them. I did not resist."
“Please love, please! If you… If you continue…” John gasped as his body began to clench and Sherlock pulled away.
"Oh, of course I will, dear!" Mrs. Hudson smiled. She saw Sherlock's look and grinned. "I'll just leave you two to your packing. If you need anything, just shout..." She made her way back out of the flat, muttering to herself as she did. Sherlock's gaze must have lingered because John suddenly looked to him and blushed.
"There! That's so much nicer. None of the shouting and the yelling," Her voice was soft. "Look at you two laughing away again. It's such a wonderful thing to see." She sighed wistfully. "Oh what will I do without the noises coming out of this flat?" She moved to the kitchen and began shifting the flowers around as there wasn't much else to do. "Mycroft said you two were going on
Sherlock's mouth was just over John's neck, John whimpering and writhing in pain. He couldn't move, his body wouldn't respond to him. Terror was like ice in his veins as he realized that Sherlock's mind was not his own. There was nothing he could do to stop him. Their connection was hollow and aching, the thread so tight between them if felt as if it might snap. Just as Sherlock's teeth were about to break the skin on John's neck he was seized by the throat and roughly thrown across the room into the wall. Mycroft stood between John and Sherlock heaving with anger. His aura made him seem even larger than he was and John allowed himself to completely collapse as Sherlock's control was broken free. He was safe. Beside Mycroft stood a tall, burly man who was also acting as a wall between the now sputtering Sherlock and John. Sherlock growled and moved to launch himself at Mycroft but was frozen by Mycroft's outstretched hand. Mycroft using his magic to pin Sherlock to the wall.
"You are not betraying him for wanting to touch me." Mycroft said softly, smiling as John blushed. He trailed one finger over John's cheek. "He knows that fledglings often feel strongly for their sires." He pressed his mouth to John's claiming it in a tender but powerful kiss that threatened to obliterate John's mind. He moaned softly and it took a long time for him to finally pull away. "He is jealous of that bond, however he does not yet understand how powerful the connection between you two will be."
"You are still so beautiful," John whispered against his chest. He slowly kissed back up, claiming Sherlock's mouth again. Sherlock timidly slid a hand up into John's hair, sighing softly with pleasure when the mender did not retreat. When they finally broke for breath, John only a small space from Sherlock, they searched each others' eyes silently for a long moment.
“Gregory do not be foolish. There is no carriage for you and this storm is blinding, you shall not be able to go on foot. You must remain here where it is safe and most importantly warm.” John’s voice had been firm, commanding the other to listen and overriding any argument from his mate (who had been preparing one). Sherlock frowned from where he stood, still shaking some snow off his dark hair and watching his mate assume the more commanding posture he’d grown fond of.
“One foot out of line and I will end you.” Moran growled as a promise before the two swept from the room.
“I will not. There is nothing that can take me from you now. We are safe, and we are home, together.” He whispered, his voice full of emotion. “Please my love, go feed and I shall meet you in our room. I need to talk to Mycroft for just a moment.” He promised.
"When were you going to tell me you were teaching our son German?" He demanded, crossing his arms with a coy smile.
"Oh my Elizabeth!" The Duke cried crossing himself before walking over to the bed. He gently brushed the hair off her face, his tears becoming more rapid.
“And… And what say you, brother?” Mycroft groaned, pulling his mouth and body away from John to survey his brother.
is fully capable of handling the inadequacies of the Scotland Yard we are officially OFF duty." His eyes cooled significantly and looked almost dangerous. Lestrade was taken aback but nodded.
"Yes, I am afraid I had to call you from your thrilling bout of doing nothing because the Duke has responded. He gives his blessing to your marriage and has called for a dinner in your honor this evening. The three of us shall be going, then tomorrow we shall finalize the plans for your ceremony. It is my hope that within a fortnight you two will be on your way to Paris.
"We're going to tell Hamish the stories of the Captain and the Pirate Prince, so that I can write them down."
"I'm perfectly aware of what he has done for me! I know he deserves better! I don't need you waltzing in here…" Mrs. Hudson cleared her throat loudly. She did it in such a way that their attentions turned from each other. She was standing beside the bed.
"I said don't." The commanding tone he used ripped through Sherlock, shutting off his logic. "I know what I'm asking." Sherlock looked over him like he was going to wake up at any moment. That he would suddenly find this to be a dream. "I already know you're bored and need something to occupy yourself. I also know you have wanted to touch me more than you actually have since you returned. You keep holding yourself back even when I'm desperately seeking more from you. In this situation you're the experienced one, which confuses me, but is also one of the greatest comforts I can have. You want to memorize every inch of me. I've seen how you look at me when I move. How you watch me. You've been trying to learn about me by observing, but we both know you memorize so much better when you can touch the thing you're studying." Sherlock shivered as John explained how
“Don’t you DARE say anything about that man!” John growled and his voice was dangerous. Marcus sighed.
"As am I." Sherlock sighed and set the food down. "It was a fit of childishness and I will be better about it in the future." He met Mycroft's gaze for only a moment. Mycroft sighed softly, Greg meanwhile consented himself to rearranging the fork at his place setting on the table, a smirk toying at the edge of his mouth.
“You’ll want to come.” Greg said darkly, turning his attention directly to John. A look Sherlock couldn't read passed between the two men and he quirked an eyebrow.
All day Sherlock tossed and turned, his mind haunted by flashes of memory and snippets of conversation. He was utterly plagued by it and when he woke he shouted in surprise, finding James sitting beside him on the bed. James laughed lowly, his eyes dark as he surveyed his husband.
"Were you expecting more?" Sherlock turned to him a bit confused. He was actually quite fascinated that John was able to put the pieces together so quickly on his own.
"John, let the ghosts of the past go." His voice was soft, he pressed John more tightly against himself, one hand slipping up to cradle his head. "We'll be okay. If anyone attacks us we'll be okay. I promise..."
“I sent him with Greg to get some breakfast. He’s been in a terrible state as you might expect. He woke shortly after Greg got him to the car and he fought Greg hard. In fact he accidentally gave Greg a black eye trying to get back inside to you two. There will never been any doubt in my mind that the world will know who his parents are.”
“You…” John’s voice cracked and the emotion in it was enough to make both Holmes feel as if they had been punched in the stomach. “You were using our bond against me.” His face tightened, and he looked at Mycroft with such hurt and anger, Mycroft felt something inside his heart break. “How could you?!” He demanded, shaking with hurt and rage, Sherlock simply tried to soothe the other, running his fingers through his hair and murmuring soft words to him.
"Sherlock you and Hamish go down and make breakfast, now." John said in a warning tone and Sherlock frowned before pushing Hamish gently out of the bed and the two of them heading downstairs.
"He has poisoned her with herbs, giving her one used to bring the child before the child was ready. Either he compelled or else paid the apothecary to provide it within the normal herbs that a woman in her condition would imbibe. As it was in powder form he believed he would be able to get away with this crime, I however can detect even the smallest hint of the herb. He has killed both her child and her in order to gain her nobility." John growled, Sherlock the only thing holding him back.
"John, focus on me." Sherlock whispered, putting his hand on John's knee. "Don't bottle it up. Talk it out."
“Luckily for you, ‘darling,’ he found it funny. Sherlock, what have I done to deserve so much torment from you?” He sighed, sinking deeply into the role of a stressed husband. “Have I not provided you everything you have asked for?”
you know he was injured." Sherlock's gaze was firm and the two locked eyes. Both standing perfectly firm but toe to toe, preparing for a fight.
"It is not your fault, my little mender." Mycroft's voice was gentle as he tentatively sank down next to John careful for any move he might make to flinch away. "Moriarty did this to you and he ordered his followers to carry it through. You could not have known your necklace came off."
There suddenly wasn't enough oxygen in the room. John's entire body tensed and he was ready to explode. His breathing instantly kicked up and he was having a hard time focusing on calming himself.
"That is true. Though if you stare too much I may get the wrong idea." Sherlock tilted his head just so, intentionally making John blush again. Again slowly undressing him with his eyes and not bothering to hide it. John coughed and felt his body responding with enthusiasm.
"I... It has been some time since you and I spent time together, so I thought we could perhaps spend the day and night together." He offered it a bit timidly, which made Mycroft's heart twinge. He wanted to spend time with John, the offer was tempting but he could not. He could not allow himself to indulge such sentiment with his brother's mate. He saw how John shivered, but he kept himself firm forcing his own emotion down in his chest.
"That summer King James told lonely John he was inviting another of his friends and his two little boys to stay. King James said that the eldest boy was likely not going to be very interesting to lonely John because he was preparing to be a business man like his father and was already involved in political and business things, but James felt that the younger boy might be a good friend for John. So John was very excited when arrived at the estate and found out the other boys were already there. King James arranged for them to be introduced and when John offered an introduction he was disappointed." Sherlock's eyes had fluttered closed again and his face was tight with emotion. "The other boy looked him over and pronounced him normal and boring before running off." John sighed and Sherlock casually stretched out so his socked foot brushed against John's ankle. "Now lonely John was lonelier than ever." John's voice dropped.
"Lord Mycroft," She said suddenly and his attention snapped up. "Has anyone informed our mender regarding Sherlock's dark moods?" There was panic in her eyes and Mycroft stood swiftly, stepping towards her.
“Talk to me…” Sherlock pleaded, however, John refused to speak another word. John watched as Sherlock finally left the room to begin packing, a stone sinking in his stomach.
“Yes, the Detective Inspector. Pleasure to meet you,” She smiled. “Dinner is ready in the dining room if you’d like. It's just us I'm afraid, although I believe I my brother and his wife are coming the end of the week to stay the weekend. Oh, Johnny," She turned back to him, "Your mother came by earlier today." John's entire body went rigid and his face tightened. "She said she wanted to see you but she was quite sure you wouldn't want to see her just yet. But she left something for you that she said you needed to see first. I had it put in the drawing room for you so that you could look it over immediately." She laughed. "I knew that a mystery like that wouldn't let you rest for long. You two can join us when you're ready." Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "Are you hungry little man?" Georgina asked softly.
He led John down the hall in his mind, towards a specific door, pushing it open. It revealed a memory of Sherlock's, a small stone house with a small garden. "
" He begged me, actually. Begged me to accompany him to assist his family and the earnest desire in his heart for his family's health was what spurned me to agree. My uncle however resolutely denied my involvement and I was forced to betray him in order to stay honest with myself." John looked down, a bit embarrassed to admit that he had betrayed the trust of his uncle for a man he barely knew. The brothers however looked even more intrigued.  "We enacted a plan and he smuggled me out of the inn the following night. When we arrived at his ancestral home on the shores of the sea to the north we found that over half of his kinsmen were gravely ill." John's voice wavered and Sherlock found his anger fading slightly as John remembered such a dark time. "I studied what I could of the mortals they fed from while working to heal over twenty of Sebastian's vampire kin. I slept little and was on the edge of sickness myself many times, however I forced myself forward using the token of my youth to my own favor. It took the better part of two months before I was able to identify what was making Sebastian's kin sick. The mortals that live in the area close to their home and those they keep for feeding use two particular herbs in their cooking that are poison to vampires. So every time one of his kin drank from a mortal from the local area they were ingesting this poison slowly over time, however it is not able to be removed from a vampire's body without assistance from other substances. Once I had identified the herb in question Sebastian was able to convince the mortal servants they kept to stop using it and to ensure it did not come into their home. With an untainted food supply secured for his family Sebastian was able to finally find peace and within half a year his entire family was cured and healthier than before. While his family was finishing their recovery he informed me of a lot of the history of his family and the area surrounding where they live. He informed me that another smaller coven had inhabited the area with them for a hundred years, however they had all contracted some illness and died twenty years before I arrived at his home. He was convinced as am I, that his family would have followed the same path had I not intervened. It was then he began to offer me rewards for my assistance and began his campaign to ensure I did not leave their home." John sighed softly as Mycroft continued running his hands through John's hair to soothe him.
"It is pleasant to see you, Lord Moran. To what do we owe the pleasure of your visit?" John asked and bowed softly. Sebastian coughed gently, perhaps blushing. Sherlock's features tightened as John motioned for Sebastian to take a seat and took one himself.
"He has been distant with me ever since your dark mood. I believe I have angered him by being with him and being so predictably angry." He shuddered as a tear fell.
"John!" Sherlock groaned. Mycroft smiled wider and positioned himself behind John guiding him into Sherlock. "Oh! It is so much!" His head fell back against the pillow as John sank into him fully. John groaned and whimpered before shouting as Mycroft pressed into him. Mycroft held him firm so he could focus on his cock buried in Sherlock and Mycroft's in him. His head went foggy and he moaned again as Sherlock shifted up slightly. There was nothing else in the world but the overwhelming sensation of being pinned between the brothers.
"But close enough that if anything interesting happens he'll be able to jump on it." John giggled. Mycroft sighed and left the room.
"Yes. Elisa was his daughter." Jacob sighed. "But that is not the worse of what you have to know." He grunted and sat back. "You will not like this part, Johnny. I am afraid it may bring you to hate me though I have no blood on my hands." John looked up from where he was running his hands through Hamish's hair in surprise, Jacob sighed. "Harriet's death was his fault."
"Leave the deductions to me." He whispered before pressing to John for a passionate but tender kiss.
“Take that filthy ring off and give it back to that liar.” James ordered, watching as Sherlock used a trembling hand to pull his wedding ring off and throw it at John. “We are going to go home now my love. I will make this better.” He promised, guiding Sherlock by the arm.
Sherlock stared after him for a long time until he realized John was making an extraordinary amount of noise in the kitchen. He moved to find out what was going on and John was slamming around, shoving pans and cups back into their places with as much noise as possible. He looked up and Sherlock slid into a chair at the table. Sherlock was surprised at the force with which John was working.
you would come to your senses. Leave everything to me; I shall arrange it straight away. No point in delaying." Mycroft smirked. "I shall send a car for you this evening."
“Alright, alright…” He stood, blushing very red as he took up his violin. He refused to look at Sherlock for a long moment, checking the tune of his strings instead. But Sherlock moved so he was directly in front of John, forcing him to look up.
"Mrs. Hudson, I'll take you home. We've set up a few extra patrols to keep an eye on you." Lestrade said, cutting through the silence. He moved directly over to her and nodded at John.
"You'd only ask a girl's family. I don't think it applies the same here. Either way I don't think John would care what Harry thought anyway. But if I were you I'd clear it through Mycroft."
"Which is where I should interject." Mycroft spoke softly but firmly. "You will have to remain inside this manor for the first month. While you get your feet under you as it were. The sun will weaken you too much initially for you to be able to adequately protect yourself. There is to be a dinner gathering at your Uncles near the end of the month, you and Sherlock will attend on our behalf and you shall, my little mender, ask your Uncle for permission to be courted by Sherlock. He will of course grant you permission and when you return I will have everything prepared for your journey to Paris." Mycroft helped John sit up as Sherlock adjusted the pillows for him. He slowly looked between them for a moment.
"You ruined everything!" She shouted and walked over to him, she was now brandishing a scalpel. She cut his shirt away. "He was so happy. His plan was perfect! He was going to kill Sherlock and then he wouldn't have had to worry about him. He designed that scheme with the pill and it was PERFECT!" She screamed. "And Sherlock would have taken that pill if you hadn't shown up..." She growled and sliced down the center of his chest drawing blood. John didn't flinch, but the blood ran. "But as if that wasn't bad enough you even had to write about it. You stole my story!" Another slice this time on an angle, he still didn't react. Suddenly it all made sense. She didn't care about Moriarty's plan, no she cared that his blog robbed the paparazzi from their scoop, specifically her. "And then you ruined everything again when he was having so much fun watching Sherlock dance. But no, you had to show that idiot Sherlock he has a heart. Suddenly he actually cared about people. Suddenly he was human, he was bewildered by a case, confused by Moriarty's game, watching people suffer and visibly upset by it." She was screaming at the top of her lungs as she brought the scalpel across in the opposite direction, an x cut across his chest. She straddled him again, pressing the blade against his neck. "He was so hurt, so disappointed and all because you ruined Sherlock. You broke him." She grinned as she touched his battle scars before driving the blade into his skin just below his left clavicle and dragging it to create a K. "Look at all his sweet little marks." She smirked touching the love bites around his neck. "But you're my pet now, well until you die that is." She growled tracing an R right next to the K, carving her initials into his chest. John grit his teeth, but that was all the reaction he gave her. "And then
