He laughed then, his whole demeanour relaxing. ‘You refine too much upon trifles,’ he told me, and leaned forward to pat my knee. ‘You are the consulting detective, Holmes: let those skills you have remain your skills. Only perhaps be mindful that your reasoning deals with humans, and that humans have feelings that can be wounded. Hearts that can be pierced.’
'I wonder . . . ah, thank you, Mrs Hudson.  Mrs Barclay, pray be seated. And Miss Morrison: I trust you are well. Pray allow me to introduce my dear friend and companion, Dr John Watson. Watson, as I explained to you, it was Miss Morrison who had the excellent sense to understand that by informing me fully of the events on the evening of Colonel Barclay's death, she could exonerate her friend.'
The rest of that body – which Watson also examined - had been found in the subsequent week. The summer had then seen more discoveries of parts of bodies – female, always female. The torso of another body was found on June 4
Lestrade arrived shortly after Gregson's departure. To him, Watson explained what had transpired that morning, and gave him a written statement, despite his protesting that he did not need one. He cross-questioned Watson closely, minutely, and in the end declared that he believed that the accusation would fail even though Watson had no witnesses but me for the hour between three and four when the murder had taken place: it was not possible for him, Lestrade opined, given his injured leg, to have traversed the distances involved in time. I had, as a matter of course, touched my repeater when I had heard him enter, wanting to know how late he was. It had been a quarter after three, and the murder had taken place, according to the examining doctor, at about a half after.
So I stood at that forlorn grave, out of pity for the man put into it, and love for Watson. Afterwards, we dined together. I plied him with enough brandy to mellow him, escorted his faltering steps to the foot of the stairs, and handed him his candle with a warning to take care. He turned and looked at me, his eyes too bright, the flame casting flickering shadows that distorted his features into a Greek mask. His lips opened, parting on an unuttered word; then he shook his head and retreated. For a moment I almost wondered if he – whether he might have asked – if he had wanted. But I did not finish voicing the thought before I slammed iron bars around it, and bade it sink forever. He had looked so lonely in that instant. I wondered, in my madness, if he had been about to speak, to reach out a hand, to ask. But it was only madness, a cloud across the moon.
‘Holmes, you are shivering. Come, my dear, let us find our seats. I would not have directed your attention to the man had I realised he would affect you so strongly.’
Watson delved into the box with careful fingers, drawing out each piece separately. ‘The syringe is of good quality.’ He frowned. ‘Although I do not like to see one in your possession.’
‘Nonsense, ‘ he replied. ‘Sleep you must and sleep you shall. I know you did not like that snake – neither did I, old fellow; since India and Afghanistan I cannot abide the beastly things – and you were quite pale after you had subdued and caged it. You have real courage, Holmes, to wait out your adversary so quietly, and then to catch it after it had disposed of its owner, when it was almost more dangerous.’
‘No, Dr Watson, it was not. The girl I knew was as sane as you or I until her marriage. Nothing about her – and I knew her for many years – led me to believe that she was in the least deranged. All change I saw came after her marriage, and I believe that to have been the cause of it.’
‘It has not been going on long – perhaps a month or so.’ She sat, smoothing her hands over her black silk apron. ‘Janey came home one afternoon from visiting her sisters – they are doing nicely now, thanks to you – much shaken. She said that she had been set upon by some roughs in the street, who tried to take her purse, and had been rescued by this young constable, Andrew Kavanagh, his name is. Of course she became silly about him from the first, because he was a good-looking youth, and gallant to her, escorting her home, calling to ask after her and such like, and she never having had a follower before, it was near to turning her head.’
‘Oh, he is stirring the pot by railing against the dilatory nature of the Commons, that they have not passed the Bill already. And he has a strange, perverse, half childish love of causing mischief, which he is by no means inclined to restrain. He does not oppose Stead, but their newspapers are rivals, therefore he would rather it were his vision, not Stead’s that should prevail, simply for the glory of it.’
‘I pity any poor wretch with eight children and only a feckless man for support,’ she said, with what I can only describe as a snort. ‘Not that he’s a bad man, but he’s a man, when all’s said and done. It’s a crying shame the poor woman has no sister, nor her mother alive to help her out. Well, I shall have a good strong calves-foot jelly for you to take to little Polly tomorrow, a jelly with plenty of lemon and sugar in it. But I shall not give it to you unless you eat a good dinner yourself, and take a rest now.’
‘It is true, for again and again I have taken a problem to him, and have received an explanation which has afterwards proved to be the correct one. And yet he was absolutely incapable of working out the practical points which must be gone into before a case could be laid before a judge or jury. We are very different . . .’
The “Dynamite Conspiracy’ once resolved – although I could see that the underlying issue, that of Home Rule for Ireland, was not going to disappear – I had hoped that there might be some rather more complex cases to amuse me, for my brain rebelled at stagnation, and then the temptations to lose myself in morphia began to tease at me, insinuating themselves into my mind with a force I found hard to resist. I mentioned this to Watson, as we wandered one late June day in the park among other strolling couples. The sky was clear and blue, and I had hesitated to raise the subject with him - I did not want to spoil his fragile content. He had had a hard couple of months, for his work with me brought him into many cases where his medical knowledge was invaluable, but his too-ready sympathies were painfully wrung. I needed – something, and what that something was was not forthcoming.
‘Norbury,’ said Watson to me, as we wandered one windy March day among the primroses. I had so far allowed myself to relax from our busy working lives – for we had had a ceaseless flow of cases in the earlier months of the year, and among them the strange case of Mr Grant Munro and his wife – as to indulge both of us with a day spent at leisure in the spring sunshine. I loved to see Watson outdoors, his hair ruffled by the wind, his eyes bright as he observed the world around him. He had been looking pale recently: had I been his doctor I would have prescribed a tonic.
‘The first at around one in the morning, the second before two.’ Lestrade had regained his composure and Abberline was no longer looking so grave. ‘I agree, he is in the clear, and safely in the clear. I was able to give him an alibi for the last murder – though that in itself is not much good when I am accused of shielding him – but we might not have been able to for these murders. Was he to have gone to the hospital last night, Mr Holmes?’
Watson was curious about my dealings, that much was plain, but too well-bred to inquire of me what I did. Though the questions plainly hovered on the tip of his tongue, he refrained from asking them, contenting himself with the occasional quizzical look as he limped up the stairs to his own room. The variety of my acquaintance puzzled him, and well it might, for my clients were drawn from every stratum of society, and might equally grace a princely palace or wash its marble floors. I would, in my turn, have vacated the drawing room for his visitors, had he had any, but not a soul did he see. He was so alone, more friendless even than I. I did once suggest we might invite Stamford to dine, not for any particular liking I had for the man, but to offer Watson some companionship other than mine. He repelled my suggestion with a decided shake of his head, and a frown.
‘I would brave anything, Sherlock, but I would not bring harm to the man I loved. I would – love him – but I would not bring him harm. I would never bring harm. And so I would want to – I would need to - be very sure.’
‘My life is infinitely easier with you to assist me, Watson,’ I remarked, and was gratified to observe him colour up with pleasure. ‘No small difficulty, but you are there to smooth it out; no arrangement to be made, but I find it is already in hand. You are a jewel among companions.’
‘Over the back of the sofa,’ he told me. ‘and the salt by the fire. It was taking the damp: you know it is strongly hygroscopic. Thanks, Holmes, I will be with you shortly. Set out the glasses, my dear chap, I shall drink deep tonight, and forget such melancholy matters. And forgive my silliness. It was only that writing my young, limber hero in all the fine bloom of his manhood, I was struck by the contrast between creator and creation. What once I was . . .”Non sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cinarae” I am no longer fit for Venus’ wars, but must bid her to spare me, “Parce, precor, precor.” Perhaps I should not read Horace: he speaks so movingly of lost love, of love denied, unrequited, relinquished, given up, that I am melancholy every time I hear him. I should read our manly, vigorous English poets, not some dandified Roman aesthete. Here, take your bowl of this concoction (and god help you, for it is at my limits of culinary expertise) sit with me, and pour the wine to wash it down our protesting gullets.’
‘And now here I am,’ he went on, forcing his tone to cheerfulness. ‘thrown quite upon the world. My wounds and the fever have put paid to those hopes for a long time, perhaps for ever. I must ‘begin the world again,’ as poor Richard Jarndyce says, and in a house as bleak. If I do re-join the army, I will not be allowed to stay here, and if I do not re-join the army, I can not afford to stay here. I shall try to find some doctoring work, if I am rejected for active service, but it will be years before I can get back to where I was before Maiwand. But do not worry, old fellow, we have some months before us yet. And it will soon be summer, so you may stop fussing over my coat. You are a bit of a dandy, you know, Holmes, and I know I am not nearly smart enough to be seen with such a very elegant fellow. That is why we do not walk together half so often as I would like: it would never do for you to be seen with such a shabby companion, when you have your way to make in the world. Which reminds me, Holmes, should you have any real objection if I were to write you up? What you do is very wonderful, you know, and it must help your practice, for you to be more widely known. And we will let July bring what July brings, and enjoy our companionship here, will we not? The rain is setting in for the day,’ he went on, putting down his napkin, and walking to the window. ‘I do believe not even your criminals will venture out today, so we shall be confined to barracks. I have some small tasks to do, and maybe I will try my hand at writing, but perhaps we might read together later? I shall introduce you to Mr Frank Churchill, who is more of a fine-feathered dandy than you, and in return, will you play for me?’
The Liebestodt has often been compared to a musical orgasm: contemporary audiences found the sensuality of Wagner’s music extremely disturbing.
‘I can make shift to understand the gist of it if the subject be scientific or medical, not literary French. The technical words are similar, give or take a vowel or two and your preposterous French endings, and of course that part of it is in Latin helps, so I stumble along, re-reading and refining bit by bit. I tried once to read the Count of Monte Cristo in the original, but failed miserably for want of common vocabulary, and the only English translation I could come by seemed poorly written, so I gave it up. And I cannot speak French at all other than, like Chaucer’s Prioress, ‘after the school of Stratford-Atte-Bowe’. I was ill-taught at school, and then after – well you know about that now. So it is easier to say that I speak it not at all, rather than open my mouth, utter rank idiocies, and expose myself as an illiterate.’
'Be kind to yourself, my dear. Listen! "Who made the heart, 'tis He alone decidedly can try us; he knows each chord, its various tone, each spring, its various bias: then at the balance let's be mute, we never can adjust it; what's done we partly may compute, but know not what's resisted." I will not arrogate to myself a deity's power to judge you, Sherlock. I see what you do, but I do not know what you resist the temptation to do. There, my dear, do not be sad.'
'I was not aware that I held such an objectionable relationship to you as that of pedagogue, Holmes. Do you see it as schooling that I care for your well-being? That I long to have, and to keep you, in good health, free of the drug? May I not cherish you, my dear fellow?’
I felt his lips brush my hair. ‘Then you must speak no longer, and you must certainly go to bed. We can discuss this more in the morning, or whenever you please.’
‘How will you procure breakfast?’ I asked him, ‘You told me you had taken a place with no live in servant, and surely no-one from the village, if there is a village, will be here so early.’
‘Holmes, you must not wipe a valise with your nightshirt. I shall ring and ask Mrs Hudson for a duster. In fact that case had better go downstairs to be properly cleaned before you use it, or all of your linen will end up soiled. If you had ever been under Army discipline you would not make such a mull of this task, for all love. When do you catch the boat train from Liverpool Street?’
Watson and I discussed the contentious section of his Act several times, over the following week. I did not have to tell him the news: after he had seen Mrs Lestrade safely into her convalescence, he had visited Burns-Gibson and Moore Agar to discuss the medical aspects of our Vienna visit, and had heard it there. He, like Mycroft, was inclined to take a grim view of it, but I was more sanguine. It appeared to me – from sundry bitter animadversions he made to the matter - that his sense of betrayal was deep, as if his colleagues in campaigning for the act had dealt him a personal slight by allowing this addition. Labouchère, he could not condemn enough for his hypocrisy and malice.  He was still spending a part of each day at the Lestrades, and of course he had his patients at the hospital to attend. But when he was home, I would catch him at odd intervals, his pen arrested above his paper, brow knit, and mouth tight with distress. I observed him closely at such times, but could not divine the tenor of his thought, for it seemed he guarded his eyes assiduously from meeting mine.
‘Of course, let us say no more about it. It was entirely understandable, and to be honest, I could see that you did not mean it, but were giving way to the prompting of some inner demon driving you, as you have been doing these last months.’ He returned to my side and stood looking down at me. ‘Holmes, for the rest of the day, I shall treat you as my patient. You are clean, now, and comfortable. Return to your bed, stay there and rest, and when Mrs Hudson returns, I will tell her you have a slight fever, and must cosset yourself today on my orders. We will eat when you wake, and I shall read my latest story to you, that you may have the fun of criticising it. And I shall make an arrangement for you to see Moore Agar, I think. You should, nay, you must, be properly examined lest you have done yourself permanent damage, and it will be less embarrassing for both of us if it is done by a physician who is not your friend, to whom you may speak freely, without having to encounter him over the breakfast table in the remembrance of those too personal thoughts you have shared. Meanwhile you will give me your word that you will not use your devices, and that you will endeavour to think more kindly of your body’s wants and needs. It is not just the vehicle which carries that great brain of yours around: it is wedded inextricably to brain and heart both, and you cannot divorce them without doing damage.’
‘Indeed it was, Sir Henry.’ I collected my scattered wits, which had been wool-gathering amid the remembered brass and strings, to utter polite nothings to Sir Henry Thompson, an acquaintance of Watson’s with whom I had had some discourse on an earlier occasion in the year. For all his erudition I was wishing him to an untimely end, for I did not in the least wish to make small-talk, but to preserve in my mind the exact phrasing of the first violins during the Liebestodt, so that I might try them over again for myself. It appeared, however, that it was not rhapsodising over the music that was his intent, for he turned to Watson.
We had no sooner returned to London, than I was summoned by Lestrade. I went to the Yard alone, since Watson was at the hospital, and it was as well I did, for it meant we could speak freely together.
‘All the better then: if he too is able to offer Dr Watson any sort of an alibi, I care not who else he be threatening. Who took the doctor’s place at the hospital yesterday evening?’
‘I do not like secrecy either,’ Watson said to me, after he had seen Lestrade downstairs. We were sharing the sofa together, my head on his shoulder, and his arm about me. ‘And all is secrecy, it would seem. We must be secret; this work is secret. I much prefer all to be open, to be clear in the light of day. But it may not be, alas. I know you do not mind it, Sherlock: your mind delights in the twists and turns, the intrigue and thrill of the chase, the knowledge that you possess knowledge that others do not. I understand that this is meat and drink for you. I even know it to be your solace, an anodyne for a mind that would, as you have said, flog itself to pieces if it were not occupied. And I know that thus engaged, you are safer from temptation. I see, God pardon me for the fault is all mine, that you still struggle against the craving for the drug. I would I had never led you to it: I shall always regret it.  But as for secrecy, I,’ he kissed my brow. ‘I would that there were no need for it all.’
‘I do not believe so. No, it cannot be. I have seen love perverted, turned to anger and jealousy and murderous hate. I have seen love turned to an evil desire for power,  and used to destroy and debase. That is love wrongly directed: love used to abuse. But a love such as you depict – no, I do not believe it can be wrong.’
‘Very well,’ he said, ‘but release me for a moment, old man, while I make myself comfortable. I promise I will come back.’
‘And so we end where we began,’ he commented, after we had dismissed the cabbie with a half-sovereign. ‘The cunning rascal! He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry Baskerville had consulted you, spotted who you were in Regent Street, conjectured that you had got the number of the cab and would lay your hands on the driver, and so sent back this audacious message.’
'I swear that I believe you are innocent of any wrongdoing. I would doubt myself, sooner than doubt you. But think, Watson. If one, or even two, swore that they had seen you with this woman, if two swore they had seen you attack her, if your story and Haslip's conflicted: what would a jury think?'
‘Excellent,’ Lestrade drained his glass and held it out to be filled again. ‘You are the best of fellows, Dr Watson, thank you. I thought I should never be done with the day to get here. It has been interesting, has it not, to piece together our tale of criminality with these robberies? Mr Holmes? Do you not think so?’
In any case, philosophy and politics aside, I had no intention of seeing Watson succumb to the blandishments of either the male or the female disciples of this group. He was fatally popular with both: one could not relax for a moment without him being drawn from one’s side by some sweetly-cooing lady asking for the doctor’s opinion on her pet philanthropic project, or some earnest-eyed young sprig asking for the soldier’s worldly advice. I spent the meetings on tenterhooks, wondering if he would be wooed further from me by one of the Misses Ford, or the earnest Miss Haddon, or serious Miss Robins, and whether, in that case, my love, unspoken as it was, would have any power at all to draw him back.
In the language of flowers, primroses mean 'I can't live without you'. Holmes knows this. Watson doesn't.
‘I’ve not smoked much,’ I whispered, closing my eyes. ‘Only a mouthful, Watson, dear Watson. Only to chase the dreams away. You know I have dreams, Watson. I have such dreams . . .’
‘He came home blind drunk and raving later that day. God only knows what he had thought would happen to Minnie: I think he had closed his eyes to his own misdeeds. I confronted him, struck him on the mouth, told him he was a murderer and not just once, that he should see justice and no mercy, and left him maudlin and sobbing there with her body – I had made shift to clean her, and wrap her and the babe decently – it was stillborn, poor little thing. The old woman had helped me, under my strong coercion, much subdued, and muttering about the evil in men’s hearts. I took a horse, and went for the local magistrate, a bluff, honest man named Murray. He saw my father alone: I do not know what he said, but my father went for a walk with his gun, and did not return. The magistrate bade me leave all to him: he said it would be better so if all were hushed up for my sake, as well as Minnie’s and my father’s. They had been in the army together, of course, so he stood by his own. Minnie and the child – a little girl – were buried together in my mother’s grave. It was given out that she had died of a haemorrhage, and people assumed she had had consumption: the child was not mentioned.’
we should like to purchase, had we the money, and walked thence to the Schönbrunn, where we toured the gardens until we could neither of us bear any more winding paths, magnificent vistas, splendid fountains, overheated glasshouses, or exotic plants.
'Let us be friends and kind to each other,’ he added, but yawned then, uncontrollably. ‘And now I must, I must go to bed. I have been up all night, and I am near sleeping where I stand. If I have not surfaced by dinner time, Holmes, I would be grateful if you would do me the kindness of waking me.’
At Oscar Wilde's trial, he was asked whether he burnt incense in his rooms, and replied that he thought it a 'charming habit'. However, it was also a habit thought to be practised by inverts, amd told against him at the trial.
‘What would you have me play?’ I asked, to change his painful train of thought.  ‘Shall it be Mendelssohn again?’ He loved the sweet, sympathetic cadences of the Lieder, stroking a picture into his mind of sun- or candle-lit days of long ago. ‘Or something popular perhaps?’ I bowed a bright snatch of music. ‘Poor, wand’ring one, though thou hast surely strayed, take heart of grace.’ I said softly, thinking to coax him into humour with Sullivan’s airs and Gilbert’s lyrics, but he shook his head, and his eyes were over-bright.
I did not answer him immediately, but turned to Watson. 'When you spoke to this woman in Farrant Street, was the area deserted? Was there anyone by? Anyone who might give an account of your meeting her? Anyone who might - identify you?'
‘I was going to take a dose of cocaine and work a little,’ I protested as we made our way down the swaying corridor.
The following day we re-enacted the events that had brought me to Hurlstone Hall in the first place, beguiling Watson step by step through the arcane family rite, our discovery of its meaning, the eventual realisation of what Brunton had been about, the horrific dénouement and inevitable sad ending. He listened, rapt, as we laid it out for his amusement: Musgrave’s discovery of Brunton in the library, tampering with his papers, the dismissal and plea for reprieve, in part granted, the man’s disappearance followed by that of poor Rachel, and my solving both Ritual and case together. His story-teller’s heart was stirred, that much was clear, but so too was his compassion. He saw before I did that Musgrave was much affected by revisiting the cellar where Brunton had been found dead, and insisted, after we had returned to the house at the end of our ‘investigation’ that he should take a stiff glass of brandy, ‘for I do not like your colour at all, Musgrave, and it will not do to have you swooning away. Ring for your man, if you please, and let us have tea as well, and perhaps a bite to eat to steady you, and settle your nerves.’
‘Entomologists use killing jars containing ether.’ He took his bag from under the table, removed a small bottle, and by manipulating the stopper, allowed a drop of the contents to fall upon the insect, which immediately became still. ‘If I were to crush it, you should not like it, and a drop of ether is the kindest way. I thought also that you might like to examine it more closely, if you knew nothing about their anatomy or physiology. There, it is out of its misery. Your hand is already reddening, but I believe you received only a little venom: you were quick to remove the bee, and the barb with it. A little bicarbonate of soda and water will alleviate that.’
The deep, punishing, healing massage succeeded the shampooing, and then, rinsed, cooled and swathed in sheets, we repaired to our secluded couches on the gallery of the drying room. A nod to my attendant, and he drew the curtain, cutting our alcove off from view, but allowing the air free passage. Watson stretched on his couch, sighing, his eyelids already closing as he abandoned himself to ease.
‘We could perhaps wait a while? Until the crowd diminishes and this wretched hubbub dies down. I always want silence after music, the better to let it sink into my soul, and yet I must endure this cacophony. I would that we were in a church or temple, that quiet contemplation might be the order of the day.’
‘He watches you: look up, lad. Ah, that loving smile! I think you need have no doubt of his affections for you, Mr Holmes, never was man more fond. And he is a handsome fellow, with those blue eyes,’ and as I straightened, glaring at him. ‘My boy, you must not mind me. I am no threat to you or your doctor, indeed, I wish you all the happiness in the world: I am happy myself, and so I like to see it in others. He is coming this way: a frown mars the smoothness of that noble brow. You are perhaps looking too pale for his liking: in fact, my dear, you are too pale and attenuated for mine. Have you been ill? ’
I have heard it said that there are those who, for preference, take their pleasure well laced with pain. I am no longer sure whether I am not one of them, or whether my hopeless desire for him rendered me impervious to the sting and smart, and most keenly alive to the pleasure of his gentle, caressing hands, his short-taken breath, the warmth of him near me. I only knew that if, at that moment, he had bidden me turn to face him, I would not have been able to without a very shameful display indeed. I was painfully, priapically, erect: no lusting satyr more so. I pressed myself down into the mattress, and he tapped me irritably on the uninjured buttock.
‘Very well then, here if we must. It is of greater importance to me to know that you are competent with small arms, Holmes.’
‘Thank you,’ he said, simply, holding out his hand. ‘I have been damnably bad company for you today, Holmes, pray accept my most sincere apologies. I have barely spoken to you, and what words I have found have been brusque and rude.’
‘No.’ He rose, and pulled me by the hand. ‘We must not allow ourselves to think so. There is hope. There is always hope. Come here to me, Sherlock. It is not all wrong. There is kindness still: the small kindnesses, small goodnesses – the many humble people who go about doing good. There are those honest folk we know in our daily lives: only witness Mrs Hudson’s patience and her generosity, Lestrade’s steadfast fidelity to his duty, the friendships between our odd little families, your kindness to me. Jack, poor fellow, may have been tempted, but he did not fall, and I do not believe he would have done, for his better nature would have held out, would have triumphed in the end.’ He seated us on the sofa, his hand still in mine. ‘Will you sit close, my dear? If you can still trust me, I who have wounded you, albeit unwilling, unwitting, unconscious of the scathe? Will you let me comfort you?’
‘We have a dog cart, and an elderly mare called Ruby. I am told she is quite placid and well behaved, and although she is, I daresay, not what either of us is used to, we shall do very well with her. Which reminds me, I had better give the poor beast her oats, for she will have been waiting this hour or more, and then I must turn her out to graze. There is a boy coming from the farm down the lane to set all fair in the stable, and he will bring us fresh milk and bread, and, indeed, aught else we desire. You see, Holmes, I have taken good care of you.’
‘There is nothing to forgive: you could not have known. My case - well there is not one like it in my knowledge. Nor in yours, I daresay. No, there is nothing anyone could have done: I know that now, with better training. She was too young, and too narrow-hipped, and he was a big man. And the child, I realised later when I studied such things, was not full term. It could not have survived. My poor Minnie. I loved my little sister very dearly, Sherlock, for all that she was mute and fey. She had the sweetest smile, when she was happy, and my mother’s blue eyes and black hair. I have nothing left of either of them, not even one of Minnie’s drawings.’
I do know how you love the stars, my dear fellow, and think it remiss of me not to have considered it before. Should you like a telescope, Watson? We might purchase one with some of Mr Holder’s largesse – you should have something for yourself, after all -  and have it sent to Sussex, when we holiday there, as I hope we will this summer. I take it you go to Professor Moriarty’s lecture then, if it is astronomy? And that is why you are balking at telling me?’
He was, I could see, still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon him, but he could never stay angry with me, that I knew, and his embrace was honest and warm and heartfelt, although sadly brief. He owned afterwards that he felt also in his heart that I was right in what I said and that it was really best for our purpose that he should not have known that I was upon the moor – although this did not console me as much as I felt it might, had I not received the Professor’s note.
'Until just after eleven, Inspector, at which point I was summoned to Barts - you must know that on certain nights of the week, usually upon a Thursday or a Friday, I am accustomed to place myself at the hospital's disposal in the event that there is a case which immediately requires an experienced surgeon - '
What else could I have said? I had not thought I would miss Watson so much. I had only been away from him a few hours, as I had been many times before during the day, but in this instance, since I knew that our parting would extend for a week or more with the sea between us, I felt peculiarly bereft. There was an aching vacancy at my side: I realised that since we took rooms together three years ago, we had scarcely been apart. We had slept under the same roof since January 1881.
‘Never that,’ he said, with an alacrity I found charming. ‘I do not weary of your society, Holmes, and I do not believe I ever will. The ease and comfort with which we live together – it is beyond all that I hoped for. Although,’ he added, looking around, ‘I speak of ease and comfort of the soul – a heart’s ease of fellowship, as it were. The body would, I confess, be more comfortable if it did not trip over quite so many papers.’ He was smiling: it was not a serious complaint. ‘Really, my dear man, could we not perhaps dispose of a few – a very few - of the less important ones?’
‘I shall confine my participation strictly to speaking on behalf of an increased age of consent, and on going through those parliamentary channels that are open to me. I am a person of no importance, but every eminent person I meet in the hospital, every surgeon or professor I encounter who might have the ear of a government minister, I invite to join me in the free ward and to look at the ravages of disease in our youngest children. I speak when invited, which is not often, and I write letters, as you know. But I will have nothing more to do with Stead, nor with Scott, nor with Mrs Butler. If that is Christian practice, I want none of it. They sicken me, these crusading journalists. Government by sensational news: it is as vile as the ill it purports to remedy. Oh Holmes, murder seems clean by comparison with this, and honest financial fraud more laudable than this, this - ’
‘You observe well in detail, Lestrade: I have always marked that of you. A curious stick, you say? Venetian lion and sea-horse? Well, I will take your case.’
That same evening came Barker, Douglas's friend, and Inspector MacDonald, with the news that the  Mr and Mrs Douglas had taken ship for South Africa some weeks previously. Their vessel, the Palmyra, had just docked at Cape Town, and Douglas's wife had cabled to say that her husband had been lost overboard in a gale off St Helena. I consoled poor Barker as much as I could - he had been a faithful friend to Douglas, and was much attached to him - but my spirits had plummeted at the news, and when he and the Inspector had gone, all I could do was to sit by the dying fire, a prey to the blackest depression.
The slow revolution of the crowd brought Wilde within earshot; Wilde, my now lauded and lionised age-mate at university. His young wife was, it was said, near her time with their first child, yet here he was at the exhibition, tall, striking, impeccably turned out, a lily in his buttonhole and a fair young man on his arm looking up at him with an expression of fatuous adoration. ‘Adrian, my dear fellow, do come and look at this: it is perfectly hideous. No great artist ever sees things as they really are: if he did he would cease to be an artist.’ His every witty utterance was applauded. An appreciative crowd - among whom was the doctor, Sir Morell Mackenzie, a kind and close friend to Wilde and his delicate little wife - hung on his every word. Yet I trembled for Wilde’s exposure of himself when I saw how tenderly he pressed his friend’s arm, how their glances one at the other hinted at a closeness beyond other companionship. Did men not see who he was? Did they not see the strangeness in him? Perhaps it was only I who saw it, being attuned to such things in myself. Perhaps no-one else noticed.
‘I must. John, why is it so bad this time? I feel – as if I will fly all to pieces – or - or contract around my centre like a burning star, and then explode – and, and when it is not like that, it is as if I am in the depths of Hell - or rather not Hell, Hades, for Hell is at least hot, and it is Stygian gloom and cold I wander in. I have no strength to walk, but I am so restless I cannot bear to be still. I am hot and cold, and my skin – if I could shed it like a snake, perhaps I could be happy, for it feels too tight all over me.’
From the whiteness about Watson's lips, from Lestrade's indrawn breath, I deduced immediately to whom the name must belong. 'Thank you, Mrs Hudson, no, but if he should come again, endeavour to detain him in talk and send Janey privately to fetch me. There is no need to worry, you have not done wrong.'
‘She would have been afraid of appearing too forward. But she might have allowed herself a little more licence and not courted censure. I suppose you could say she was cold, in that she never seemed to wish to be close to him, or familiar in any way. I was much with them in society, so I saw this.’
‘Hush,’ his hand left my shoulder and stroked down my cheek. ‘I’m not sure you’re entirely sensible, my poor Holmes. Close your eyes and rest: we shall be home directly, and then I shall bathe these wounds for you.’
‘Labouchère has also much to say about the unfortunate affair of the forgeries in the Times and the Parnell Commission: Pigott’s trial continues. What has your brother to say of it?’ He yawned. ‘Oh, I am weary: that was a hard crossing, and I do not think I have ever been more vilely seasick.’
George Grey and William Markham were real blackmailers and extortionists threatening gay men of the period. They were tried and sentenced for their crimes in the summer of ‘87. The case of Miss Cass, and the overall issues with the blackmailing of prostitutes by police officers were much in the news in the autumn of ‘87. There were questions asked in parliament, and efforts were made to reform the police.
Phelps resigned the treaty to me without a murmur: I verily believe he would have parted with anything for the sake of being exonerated from so serious a threat to his career as its permanent loss.
‘Perhaps.’ He laughed, but there was no mirth in it. ‘Forgive me: I did not think to find myself sensitive on the subject. I must examine why I was so. But go on, my dear, see, I am a child to your chiding now.’
However great my own excitement, I tried to maintain an unperturbed façade – one does not wish to appear entirely provincial after all - but it was difficult with Watson bubbling over with enthusiasm at every turn of the wheel. ‘Is not this ingenious?’ he commented, and ‘Look, Holmes, is not this cleverly done? It is fascinating how so much is fitted and dovetailed into so little space? And all is so beautifully appointed: I have never seen anything like it.’
He smiled. ‘Indeed I am. But the fever broke last night, in a fine drenching sweat. Doctor Watson said she will do now, if we can get her strength up again. I do not believe he has had his clothes off these eight and forty hours, Mr Holmes, nor has that kind little girl of yours neither. And your Mrs Hudson has been in and out I do not know how many times a day with food for the children, and nourishing soup for poor Annie. I do not know what I have done to be blessed with such kind friends,’ and the tears stood in his eyes as he spoke. ‘I know I shall go a thankful man all my days for it. The children are so young: my oldest, Tom, but thirteen, and little Nan only three: it is no age to lose a mother, and so caring a mother too. Well, that is the second time in these two years my poor wife has miscarried and there will be no more of it. I have my quiverful, as the Good Book has it, but there will be no more: I am not a beast to kill her with more childbearing. Indeed I would have stopped sooner, but she does dearly love her babies, for all that she is sometimes sharp with them. And even that is better now that she has not to worry and fret over poor Polly, and has your Janey’s Jack to help her with the rough work. Why, she has been growing quite young and merry again, quite like the pretty girl I courted those many years ago. I should dearly like to keep her so, now I am let to keep her when I thought I might not.’
‘Do you think this level of secrecy necessary?’ I moved to the window. Only the faintest distortion in what appeared outside betrayed that the glass was no ordinary glass. ‘I am surprised.’
‘What then?’ I coaxed his head to my shoulder. ‘Rest on me, John; let me hold you. Or let us sit down for God’s sake, for you are trembling.’
‘They are, Sir, but their wives are often away. An’ some of the men are bachelors, Farquharson the banker, for example, an’ they’re the ones who entertain, for the most part. We all know who’s who, Mr Holmes, an’ if a man wants to come in, he has to be vouched for. ‘Twas me friend Martin got me the entry – an’ another man, Boyle, who brought in McKiernan and Taylor.’
‘Would it help if I told you that I am beginning to? And that it is big – bigger than anything I have touched hitherto?’
‘I did.’ I admitted, and suppressed a shiver. ‘I am cold to my bones, now I come to think about it.’ I tapped again. ‘Will you take your sherry, my dear fellow, while I go and set the room to rights? And – I shall put on the dressing gown you bought me; it is warmer than this old one. Would it please you if I played for you tonight?’
He joined me on the sofa, and I offered him the glass of cognac. ‘Do your scruples about lying with me extend to if I have been drinking alcohol? Am I untouchable when disguised with wine or spirits, as well as under the influence of the drug?’
which means to rectify, or guide aright, and you will obtain a word which is not, it is true, in general use as a noun, having been superseded by the more common
‘I think the case more complex than you, Holmes, but that is because I am a medical man, and you are not. But for your purposes, Lady Sheffield, I do concur. I see nothing in what you have said to lead me to believe that your young friend was insane at the time of her marriage, and everything to conclude that her mind is presently distressed to the point of her being unable to care for herself, although whether it is absolute madness I cannot say without observation. You say she eats and sleeps better ‘now’; I take it that you imply that at one time she did not?’
It did indeed, seem only moments before I was seated in a high-backed wing chair before a small fire, divested of my outer clothing, collar and cuffs, and eating a plate of soup that I had not dared to refuse. He busied himself about me – Watson was always quiet in his doctoring, never any unnecessary hurry or bustle – collecting and laying out bandaging for my ankle and eventually coming to take my plate away.
‘It is now.’ Watson took it back from him and twisted the head. ‘With lead. I took it to a gentleman of our acquaintance a month or so back, to have it done. Applied smartly to the collar bone, or just above the elbow, it can disable a man without killing him, which is always my preference. One should never aim for the head: now that is a killing blow, and too often by accident.’ He pulled, slightly, and withdrew a blade. ‘But this is also a little sword-stick, you see, although it is harder to use as such, now the head has been changed and the balance altered. I had it made to my specification in India, long, long before I was injured, and needed to use it for support. I had a romantic boy’s fancy for such a swashbuckler’s weapon, I am afraid: too many tales of highwaymen and duels.’ His smile was rueful. ‘I have never drawn it in anger - it is a lethal blade, make no mistake about that - and I pray that I never will.’
‘But in all of this,’ I concluded, ‘there seems to be direction and intent: malice aforethought conspiring to harm the unwary and benefit others. Moran and Milverton, I think we may safely say, are linked; they appear twice together now, Moran as the gambler who lures young men into his trap that he may blackmail them and Milverton as the blackmailer. Do they share the proceeds, I wonder?  Yes indeed – and although, Watson, I would never wish one I hold so dear to come into the grasp of a blackmailer, it is, as you say, a pity that we were not able to determine whether the attempt to blackmail you would have come from Milverton. It must be Moran who set the trap for you, for did not -  our informant - speak of a military man, one accustomed to giving orders as one of his principals in your affair?
‘To love each other? No, why should it be? History and nature both commend this love to us: the ancient philosophers extol it. I feel nothing unnatural about it. I am sure if it were wrong, my heart would revolt against it, and it does not.’
He put up a hand, blinked, slow, like a lizard, and moistened his lips. ‘You will listen to me. Though you pride yourself upon your nobility of soul, you are as much a criminal as I. Your moral superiority revolts and displeases me: there is very little to choose between us, and though you fight on the side of the angels for now, you know you will never be one of them. So I will take away your superiority, your pride, Holmes, and you will come humbled to me, and bend the knee, begging that I spare your lover. I will expose you as no angel, but as deep-dipped in villainy as I, and in your fall he too will be ruined - unless you cease this association.’
He smiled, clasped my shoulder warmly, and was gone. I lay back in my chair, the book open in my lap. Our rooms adjoined, upstairs. He would close his door behind him, unfasten his collar – I must remind him to wear an Ascot on the morrow, no need to stand on ceremony here – and his cuffs, and lay them aside. He would disrobe, at least in part, unlacing his shoes, stripping his socks, the olive-toned tweed trousers he affected for country wear, and perhaps even his drawers. His shirt would be loosened at the neck, revealing the little dip at the base of his throat. He would lie down, curled on his side as I had often seen him. He slept protecting himself, pillows tucked close against his back, his knees drawn up, his elbows folded tight into his belly, one hand beneath the pillow where, I knew, he no longer kept a gun as he had in the army, lest he should use it, dream-thralled, to someone’s harm.
He swallowed his coffee in two great draughts, returned the cup, pressed my hand tenderly again and was gone, throwing a parting admonition at Lestrade to 'not tarry, but be brief in explanation: he would be with us again directly.'
'I believe he is more subtle than that. What if his plan is for you to be killed judicially? If he can successfully bring you to trial for the crime of murder, then they will hang you. What if his revenge for my thwarting him is to be the hangman's noose and public obloquy for the public companion of a man who has helped many to that same hempen halter? I have saved many from it also, but what if I cannot save you? And thus he gains his ends, my disgrace, for consorting with you, a murderer condemned, but far worse than that, my grief at your death.'
'Two to swear to the presence of one,' I corrected him. 'To make assurance doubly sure. Only two will come forward, if you enquire for witnesses. The third man would be made out to be Watson, of course, to be sworn to as the murderer.'
‘Was there an illness that might have affected the brain at any point? As she grew, had she defects of temper? I shall press you a little on this, Lady Laura. We must know the bad with the good in order to tell if there be anything that could be unkindly construed into madness.’
On Christmas Day? I observed him narrowly through drooping eyelids. What errand could wile him from me on this of all days? And he looked oddly embarrassed, ashamed, even. My heart sank: surely he was not seeking a carnal interlude?
‘I suppose you have it all puzzled out already,’ remarked Watson. I had sent the Inspector on ahead to the scene of the crime, and Watson had accompanied me to the door of the house before returning to wait with Hayter. ‘Well, I cannot say it seems to have done you harm. There is a tinge of colour in your cheek, and your eye is as bright as before your illness. Holmes, I am sorry for these last few days. I know there has been a difference in my manner, and I know that you have felt it, my dear fellow. I have been out of patience with myself, and I daresay you are out of patience with me too. But I have been – I did not know what to – in any case, do you . . . can you . . .?’
‘And it will not be the first time  for either of those things, Mr Holmes, as I well know. You have sponsored several into our force, and all of them are fine young men. Well, well, I must leave you now that that is all is cleared up, Sir, but do not go exploding any more dynamite, if you please. It makes our cabbies nervous.’
‘Stark was – carefully chosen.’ I laid aside my Petrarch, not without some regret, and took up the Dumas. ‘Musgrave was orphaned young, is of a, of a, ah, nervous, and, and somewhat, ah, yielding disposition, and wants, needs um, a strong and guiding hand in certain areas. And a kindly one.’
‘Would you discontinue the drug for a little while, Sherlock, do you think? It would be – it might be a useful experiment, to see if there is a corresponding diminution of the low mood?’
‘Are you sure that is wise?’ Watson sneezed again. ‘Of course I shall come with you, my dear Holmes: I would not abandon you for the world – but do not you find this gift, hard on the heels of your – incursion – rather too significant? It implies, does it not that he is aware of your interest in him? I do not like that. I do not like it at all.’
He smiled at me, and cradled my hand against his cheek, turning it to press kisses into the palm. But there were tears in his eyes, so I took his handkerchief from his sleeve, and blotted them away. Chills and fever racked me then, and he cared for me very tenderly, I assenting and grateful. The thread he held me on was light, as he promised, and if he commanded I knew it was for good reason, so my compliance was assured and sincere: I ate and slept as he wished me to.
Watson too appeared uneasy as January wore on, although to begin with I did not understand why. The little forensic analyst, Dupré, had taken a great liking to me. I thought at first it was only because the poor man was homesick for his mother tongue, and desperate for someone with whom to speak it. I slipped quite naturally into French when conversing, the mellifluous Latinates coming soft from my tongue, and it pleased me greatly to regain my own former fluency. I fell into the habit of lunching with Dupré when Watson was at Barts, sometimes with Stevenson and Bond, sometimes without. Watson made little comment, but it was borne in on me that he did not like Dupré when he quizzed me over our luncheons, ‘ . . . although I suppose at least you do
I needed something? Let me be honest. I needed him, with an increasing hunger that left me hollow and desperate. I had no morphia to quell my desires, no mechanical means of curbing my imperious flesh, and no intention of making him the subject of my fantastical longings: relieved, even satiated I might be on occasion, but I was never satisfied. Sometimes I did not know how long I could go on like this, silently desirous, hopeless, yearning - and I almost resolved to put an end to the torment, to declare that we should part – but he was so dear a friend, as well as a love, that I could not bring myself to do it. So I fed myself on scant hope – and though well nigh starving on it was yet better nourished than had we parted and I had never seen him more in this life or any other, if any other were to be.
‘I shall sit by you,’ he declared, as he returned to my side, brandishing the book with an air of triumph, ‘and that way I can con the page as you read. Perhaps it will make it easier to pick up a few words. By the way, Holmes, do I take it that Musgrave was somewhat more attached to Brunton than a man usually is to his servant? Of course that is why he was so upset at Brunton’s treachery, both with treasure and with girl. And that good man Stark is the replacement?’ He raised a quizzical eyebrow at my no doubt dropped jaw. ‘My dear fellow, real attachment is always visible on the face of one who – cares - when the object of their attention is sick. A doctor must remark this many, many times. I am no detective as are you, but I have officiated at enough sickbeds to see that, at least. And its reverse, alas,’ he added, frowning.
‘I had arrears of work to make up, but it is true I have been absent with intent. It pains me to see you taking cocaine, yet nothing I have said since we returned from Scotland has had any effect upon you. And as for lying with you - you cannot consent to an embrace if you are under the influence of the drug, Sherlock. I have told you this before. And I will not, when you are taking it in the evenings, lie down with you at night. It is not unkindness.’ His voice was low and wretched, and my heart constricted. ‘It is not that I do not want to. That I do not – long to. It is that – I cannot and will not, if you are not fully in your senses, but exalted with cocaine. And during the day – we should not now take the risk.’ He reached to touch my hand. ‘If you have – wanted me, then I am very sorry. Will you not come to me, my dear Damon? Indeed I have been lonely for you.’
A step sounded on the stair. We sprang apart, I conscious of a heightened colour and some heat in my cheeks; Watson still smiling, amused, composed. Mrs. Hudson appeared with a lady’s card upon her salver. Watson glanced at it, raised his eyebrows, and handed it over to me.
Watson shook his head. 'I should prefer them to remain, Inspector, since Mr Holmes is here to bear witness for my side as to what is said. Let us maintain the appearance of justice, as well as justice itself. Go to it, man: tell me: of what am I suspected?'
'Yes; I had given Miss Harrison instructions to lock the door on the outside and take the key with her when she went to bed. She carried out every one of my injunctions to the letter, and certainly without her co-operation you would not have that paper in your coat-pocket. She departed then and the lights went out, and I was left squatting in the rhododendron-bush.
I would have thanked him then, but could not, for the sneezing. I was sure he understood, despite my inability to speak.
‘ – I suspect you of nothing, but of being my Pythias.’ I made myself smile at him. ‘And I cannot do without him at my side, my dear J – Watson. John. I see have insulted you without meaning to do so: do you pardon me, and all will be well again.’
‘Watson,’ I whispered, for he was looking at me with so much sorrow, and there was no point in me hiding now, none at all, when all was discovered, and my ignominious weakness exposed, ‘Watson, I must. I must wear them. Watson, you know how I value my mind. I do, I am sorry. I have tried to be above it all, but I do feel. I am – I am a human male: I cannot choose but feel, or react. But I cannot act on it. You are a doctor, you know what giving in to – to the impulse. You know what it leads to: the degradation, the loss of vital force, of intellect. I cannot lose my intellect, Watson. Without it I am nothing. You are a doctor: you know.’
‘Now, Stevenson, you must not dispraise Holmes to me: we are friends, you know. I am here because this is my lodging, of course. Lestrade, may I offer you the compliments of the season? Mrs Hudson,’ turning to her, ‘Could I trouble you for coffee for the four of us? And then perhaps, Stevenson, we can consider the matter which brings you here without so much heat. Holmes, my dear fellow, may I introduce my colleague to you?  Dr Thomas Stevenson, of Guy’s and London University, in the field of medical jurisprudence and forensic science. I am sure, Stevenson, that my friend Holmes will be of material assistance to you in whatever brings you here. I can attest to his brilliance myself, you know.’
‘I have been here since dawn yesterday, my dear. But I am afraid you were quite – elevated -  and did not know, and then you fell into such a deep sleep that at one point I – I rather despaired of rousing you. How much did you take?’ He turned my arm over, inspecting it, stroking here and there, pressing the veins lightly. ‘Was it just cocaine, Holmes? Or morphine as well?’
‘I’ll be telling ye the entirety of me sad story, Doctor, since I’ve seen that I can trust ye with it. An’ Mally here’ll be doing the same, won’t ye my boy?’
‘I am shocked to hear you say so.’ I was, in truth, astounded: Mycroft had never unbent so far as to offer criticism of the anointed monarch he had served with such devotion. ‘You surprise me very much, brother.’
'It is not of choice, Holmes. If we are to retire together, I must make an effort to work as much as possible. And at least the hospital work pays, and there is plenty of it, though the hours are, I grant you, somewhat trying.'
He set down the wine within easy reach, and seated himself a little away from me. ‘Tell me then. I shall not judge you, even as you in your kindness did not judge me.’
‘It is not unmanly to feel or to reflect on your actions,’ I told him. ‘It is not unmanly to be tender hearted, or to think that you have done wrong, or to question. It is gentle-hearted of you. The truest, bravest knight of all was Galahad, and he was gentle.’
‘Too much, too fast and you will vomit again.’ I picked up the hand-bell, let it sound once, twice. ‘Very well, I will not send for Lestrade, but if you are in trouble we must leave here now, and I must have a cab, anything.’
The events chronicled - in part - in the case that Watson called ‘The Resident Patient’ are too well known now, thanks to his writing, to need any further elucidation here.  What I immediately realised, and what I believed Watson did not, was that Trevelyan, that shy, nervous man, ‘like a sensitive gentleman,’ as Watson was to describe him, was an invert, and that his tale of patronage, fantastical as it seemed, was only a cover for a more prosaic, perhaps brutal, arrangement. In short, Trevelyan was not only Blessington’s – or Sutton’s, I should say – protégé, but also his catamite. I had in fact, on observing his attenuated form and sickly pallor, been reminded forcibly of those lines of Catullus, to wit,
‘Not my vanity,’ I said. ‘But my heart, perhaps. I confess that I did not like working without you. There was no-one to keep watch for me and scold me when I was going wrong. And I could not deal with the landlady at all. Had you been there, we would have been better served, for you would have charmed her into producing meals I could actually eat. As it was I subsisted on the sparest of diets.’
Cornwall and Martin Kirwan, his old friend, were then tried for conspiracy to procure men for immoral purposes, but the jury could not agree on its verdict, and the case was set back to October, when French, whose sanity was still in doubt, might be assessed again for fitness to stand trial. Albert de Fernandez, the surgeon major in the army was acquitted on the sodomy charge. James Pillar, an elderly man of about seventy, who changed his plea on the felony count to guilty against the advice of his lawyers, was sentenced to twenty years penal servitude – a life sentence, or rather, for him, poor man, a death sentence since he would most certainly not survive it. Two indigent, and lower class, brothel keepers, one of them blind, were sentenced to two years with hard labour for keeping a disorderly house.
‘We have many Greek merchants in London, and I had occasion to treat the child of one recently for a broken leg. It was an unpleasant fracture, but I used Antonius Mathijsen’s Crimean practice of immobilising the limb in plaster of Paris bandages. It is an extension of the ancient Basrah method, which of course, you know all about. In any case, my patient’s father was one of the Ralli brothers, who with the Melas and Xenos families, conduct most of the trade in their country’s goods to England. I know of the Ralli family for they were our suppliers of borax in India – it has many medical uses, as you know - and also of gypsum. We fell into conversation about the medical trade, they expressed themselves grateful for my care, and offered me a gift when the child was discharged.’
‘I am aware of it, thank you.’ My heart was sinking within me: I had made an egregious error, for this man was more brazen and more dangerous than I had supposed. ‘Dr Watson is unparalleled in many respects.’
‘True. It is true,’ Carpenter admitted. ‘I am too carried away by my own flights of fancy. I assure you, I do not mean to ignore, or reduce in importance the very real sufferings that exist among our poor. I meant only to say that there has been more joy for me in the affectionate arms of the simple working man than the neurotic affections of the scions of rich families. But as for reformation or revolution – I have hopes that we may achieve this better society peacefully, Sir, do not you . . .?’
‘Thank you, but I do not drink tonight. Holmes, as your physician I must recommend you do not drink either: you have not yet recovered from your digestive disturbance.’ He removed the glass from my hand (I had not had a digestive disturbance) and set it on the table. I had never heard Watson speak so coldly, save the occasion on which he offered the cut direct to Moran. ‘I regret, Professor, I cannot see my way to changing my views. You spoke of orbits just now: I believe mine and the Colonel’s should not coincide either. Was this in fact, the reason you invited us? To make me some kind of – dishonourable suggestion – a proposition, in fact?’
‘You will give it to an - an incorporeal agent,’ he went on, as if thinking his argument through, 'because you believe yourself still to be in control of it - and since the cocaine strengthens that illusion, rather than obscures it, as morphine would, you do not fear to lose yourself. It is easy to lose oneself to love - and hard to find oneself again when all seems to be surrendered.’
At length he sighed and heaved a deeper breath, and moved to draw away from his reclining posture against me, but I tightened my grasp around him, and pressed him to my breast. He relaxed, his body lying loose and easy against me, and I laid my cheek softly against his hair. ‘Don’t go.’
‘Some do,’ I replied. My heart had dropped. I was beginning to like this man: if he proved one of those who demonstrated an ineradicable, visceral hatred towards the notion of inversion, it would be a blow to me. I was not prepared there, as we spoke, to examine how much of a blow it would be, to find him one of those men, for it would be the certain cause of our parting. Innocence, ignorance or indifference, I could support. Hatred might see me ruined, and without my lifting a hand to him. ‘Some do,’ I repeated. ‘But there are many respectable married men who go there, and I do believe the heat would do you good. But if you do not like the risk, I will say no more of it . . .’
We spent the rest of the morning trawling the papers, and by afternoon had come up with a handful of suicides that seemed inexplicable – one young woman of 21 or so, the second daughter of a Major in Launceston, a Mr John Shepherd, 22, of Poplar (although he was a surgeon, preparing for exams: there might have been some intellectual doubt to cause his overdose of opium). More promising were the cases of Thomas Nash, a forty-year-old Lincoln’s Inn solicitor, who blew his brains out with a revolver, and a military man of sixty-eight, Colonel Peel, also from London, who did the same. Scant pickings, but something to investigate, at least.
‘He is a man unlike other men,’ he told me, kindly. ‘I would take a deal more offence than that, Mr Holmes, for what you have done for me and mine. Polly is going on finely now, and thanks to your lad staying with us, my poor wife is less harried at home. It is amazing what a little help has done for her temper, bless her. I have much to be thankful for. I can tolerate your older brother, especially since, as I said to you, I have one of my own. In any case, your brother wished to consult me about a case, and I have agreed with him that you are the person to handle it. But you must go to Vienna for it, I am afraid – that is another reason for asking you to take on the case, since I cannot spare the man-power.
‘How does Mrs Lestrade find herself?’ I asked Lestrade a few days later. He looked grey and weary, poor fellow, and I felt for him very much. ‘Watson sent a message last night that he expected the crisis to come, but I have not heard from him yet this morning. You know, Lestrade, you would be better at home: can you not take leave of absence a few days? You look regularly done in.’
“It is your misfortune, my dear fellow. No one can blame you. There is no precaution which you have neglected. Now, Mr. Holmes, you are in full possession of the facts. What course do you recommend?”
Dublin Jack. Bless him, he needs a story all to himself.  William O’Brien comes across badly in this story, which is necessarily seen from Holmes’ (and Mycroft’s) perspective.
‘Morrel has reason, for his seeming friend has betrayed him, and he is deep in grief. He trusted, and was lost: a man does not trust so a second time. Can there be a happy ending, Holmes? Can there truly be any happiness after this? Why does he not simply tell Morrel ‘Valentine lives’? Would it not be kinder?’
The dinner was ridiculously grand – oysters, clear soup with perles du Japon, a turbot in green sauce, filet of beef and a stuffed capon, a savoury of cheese and anchovies, and an iced chocolate pudding, all with good wines. With Watson’s eye upon me I ate more than I would usually, and knew I would regret it later. We sat late and sipped liqueurs – a Chartreuse heavy and golden as honey, prickling the tongue with the sharp bite of bitter herbs; and Watson forbade me coffee, ordering us instead a tisane of anise and lime flower ‘to rest you, Holmes. You look tired. I want you to sleep well tonight.’
For some days after that Watson was unwell. His cold kept him awake, and whenever he did sleep, his nightmares returned. I woke him for several nights, calling him back to himself, playing Lieder to send him back into gentler dreams. He spent those nights in my bed, where I could watch over him. When the nightmares diminished, he developed a hacking cough that broke his sleep even more.
‘Of course, of course, my dear Holmes,’ his smile was true now, and he caught my hand in his eagerness and shook it. ‘Of course, whatever you like. Even if it cannot be immediately, with the hope of it there, I can make shift to keep little Polly well for Lestrade until she is able to go to the hospital. I cannot thank you enough! That is indeed sweet: to know that that benefit will come makes your absence worthwhile – if not bearable.’
Scientific discoveries or publications of books reported by Holmes in this work are placeholders for the dates of events.
A smile curved his lips, ‘ “Then will he strip his sleeve, and show his scars, and say ‘these wounds I had on Crispin’s day’ ” Oh Holmes, you are the most consummate romantic. There was nothing valiant about my service, it was a thing of hard duty and slogging endurance. And shamefully short, into the bargain. Ahhhh . . .’ He moaned, long and guttural as the
‘You did,’ he drizzled honey on a piece of toast, and placed it on my plate. ‘But he really needs help, and you have nothing to do. Try this, will you, Holmes?’
‘It was given out, I learned, that not only had my birth ruined my mother’s health, but that I myself was sickly, an ailing, miserable thing, whose wretched life had been despaired of almost from the first, and that I had been sent to Cornwall, where the climate was softer and more adapted to my constitution, there to be nursed tenderly until I should come to health. And it is true, I was subject to fevers as a boy. But the circumstances of my rearing were by no means tender.’
‘I rather suspect you of leading him astray, knowing your fondness for chemistry,’ Lestrade straightened himself. ‘Well, the case will be determined very shortly, Mr Holmes. It is curious how it came to light you know; it was through a young man in the police force who had a similar nose for detection and a like curiosity to your own.’
‘Hardly that, Watson,’ I told him. I released his arm to take both his hands in my grasp and hold them strongly. ‘There are some points which are as dark as ever. But we have so much that it will be our own fault if we cannot get the rest. We will go straight to Whitehall Terrace and bring the matter to a head . . .’
‘ – to give colour to his story of selling paint, as you mentioned, Holmes, but it was the acid and the glycerine which he intended – ’
‘You are a thing of beauty and a joy for ever,’ he said, his face alight with laughter, ‘and as vain as a peacock into the bargain. Of course it will do, but were you even in rags, my friend, I should be proud to dine with Sherlock Holmes.’
‘You are the d - the nearest creature on God’s green earth to me,’ he said, his voice low. ‘Never was a man so fortunate as I am, to be your friend. There. I have said it, and now you will think me sentimental.’
‘He is resolved to go on even as he always has: his - friend is a man of some eminence, and they believe they are safe – for now. And to answer your question, he insinuated nothing, only warned me to have a care as if he wondered whether I might merit the warning. But it is a sorry state of affairs.’ He was leaning on the mantlepiece, looking down into the small fire we had there – for it was chilly, although barely the end of August. ‘Would you prefer me to find other quarters, Holmes? I know we are not – it is, it is not like that with us, of course, but if you wish it, I will make arrangements. Not happily, I confess,’ he lifted his head and looked at me for almost the first time in the conversation,’ not leave happily, that is, but I would, I would happily do anything for your sake, my dear – fellow.’
‘It was, in sort. I was told that the woman was my mother; the man her husband, but not my father; the boy my half brother, who was just about to leave Eton - where he had won high honours and been held in great esteem - for the university, whence he would go in the fullness of time into some high position or other. He had somehow – he has never told me how - found out about my existence, which had been kept from him for many years, and being his father’s darling and his mother’s joy, from whom naught he desired was ever withheld, had so won upon them over a period of a year that he had procured – for which I shall ever hold him in reverence and esteem – some acknowledgement of me, and an amelioration of my condition. He had exacted, I know not by what means, a promise that I should go to school, and later be admitted into the family. He came to me in the course of the conversation, shook me warmly by the hand, addressed me by my name as Sherlock, and told me that he was Mycroft, that I might call him brother, for he was glad to know me at last, and hoped that we should know each other better and be great friends thereafter.’
The motive? To save him. No, even to save him, I could not turn criminal, for saving him thus, I would have lost him forever. Had I once stooped to use the Professor's means, no matter how noble my ends, or the motive for which I subverted the one to the other, Watson would have turned from me with a loathing that no other fault, not my selfish refusal to abjure the drug, not my hesitation to commit myself to cleansing myself of it, not my trespassing on his patience and goodwill as I travelled my thorny path, would have inspired in him. I would not, for my own integrity, nor I could not, for losing Watson's love, become the thing I most hated, even to destroy it. As for opportunity to have recourse to crime, opportunity abounded. It ever has, for evil to flourish, and I knew well how others took their chance at propagating it. My choice, however, was not to take it: opportunity, I would let lie.
‘You speak truth, but it is nonetheless a horrible story, and I wish very much that I had not heard it. And as for women, I shall leave that sort of thing to you; you have the gift for it. Not a female we meet but is charmed by your gallantry and gentleness, my noble friend. But I cannot believe you have the temerity to deduce my past. You usurp my privilege, Damon: I am offended.’
‘I am not leaving you, you foolish fellow, but only going to the Lestrades’.’ He looked up, smiling, his brow clear, and my heart slowed: not so would he look if he were in truth planning to leave me. ‘And I shall be away at least for one night, if not for more. His wife is ill: the matter hangs in the balance between life and death, but it will go hard with me if I do not save her.’
‘As my doctor, you wish to know what strength. And how, and how often. I use the proportions for Keyes’ solution – you are aware of it, of course?’
‘Sometimes it is you who need the doctoring,’ I finished for him. ‘I am honoured that it is to me you turn, that I can heal you. The circumstances of your life have taught you to despond: I see that, and I understand why it is so. But the circumstances of mine have taught me to hope, and I say, my dear John, that you must never give up hope. Remember what Monte Cristo said to Maximilien in his despair, and do not give up hope.’
‘If more of us valued food and cheer and song above gain and gold, it would be a merrier world,’ I said, blinking hard against the moisture in my eyes. ‘But as for sweetness of song, Watson, even you must be able to hear that those waits are deplorably flat. Hand me my violin, dear chap, and I shall show you how the immortal Bach intended his chorale to sound.’
‘Nothing sentimental, for heaven’s sake, Holmes. I am so low, I could weep like a child. Let it be some Caprice or other, that I may lose myself in its brilliance yet not be mournful.’
In the paragraph that begins 'From the centre of Isfahan . . .' lovers of Gerald Manley Hopkins may recognise echoes from 'The Alchemist', a poem I thought particularly appropriate for Holmes.
William Stead stood his trial, and was committed to prison in November for his part in abducting Eliza Armstrong – to three months without hard labour: ‘A disgrace,’ Watson had said, angrily throwing the paper from him after he read the verdict. ‘Why should he receive only three months, in consideration of his standing in society and the supposed purity of his motives, and Louise Mouret, who examined the child to certify her virginity, be given six with hard labour on the mere supposition and no proof that she was a professional abortionist? Where is the justice in that?’
‘Indeed. Even the Prime Minister is not paid as much. There is more, however Sherlock. You recall that earlier this year in July, before the Paradol affair – you did admirably, there, brother, by the way, and the country is grateful – there was a blackmailing case before the magistrates at the Central Criminal Court?’
He glanced around, then touched my reddened mouth with a fingertip. ‘But I will not regret - do not regret the kiss. I do not regret it. And if loving you – feeling as I do for you, wanting you – makes me an Uranian, or an invert, or whatever epithet men choose to throw at me, then I am an invert. I will take the epithet, I will proclaim it aloud if I must. Forgive me, Sherlock. I cannot hide from this, cannot be a coward over it, any longer. I cannot pretend it is purely a - a brotherly affection I have for you. Yet whatever I – feel – for you, it is not mere desire. It is far more. I do not wholly understand what it is. But it is more. It is what I have never known before.’
Alfred Douglas was offered the post at Constantinople as assistant to Philip Currie, the ambassador just at this point going out, but refused to go. Had he gone, he would have met Holmes when he passed through that city.
‘Cannot you so, my dear? Then I must tell you myself, it seems. You see, I have a very dear friend with whom I live, and who is a brother to me in all but name, and we go on more than tolerably together, having a good deal of fun, to tell the truth, such as I have not had since I was a boy, and perhaps not even as a boy – give me your wrist, Holmes: I wish to check your pulse. There, that is calming a little now.’
Lestrade had laid aside coat and hat, and chuckled as he accepted a glass of wine from Watson. ‘Trust you, Mr Holmes, to be fly to the time of day. I dare swear you have ears in all of London: you hear things sooner than I. Our friend Shinwell Johnson is it, this time? Through Miss Kitty?’
He was gone shortly after, and I summoned Mrs Hudson to discuss our commissariat. ‘Doctor Watson is in pain, and so he is rather low today: I would like to have something to tempt his appetite. What can we offer him, Mrs Hudson? What can you and I do to cheer him a little, other than the Turkish baths?’
‘He was not only kind and just but generous: he has shared his all with me. But the man I was told I must address only with ‘Sir’. My mother held out her hand to me once, and when I approached, took mine only to press it briefly, her fingers seeming to shrink from mine in revulsion. She showed me no mark of affection then, nor ever did she so. Her usual address for me was ‘boy’, when she deigned to speak to me at all. Oh John, John, my dear fellow, my kind heart, why are your eyes wet? It was a long time ago now, and all is over: they are both dead. And – and I cannot tell you more now about that yet. Suffice it to say that the man, Mr Holmes, whose name I bore all unwanted, examined me in my studies; Mycroft and my mother looking on. If it had not been for my new brother, I might have faltered, but I could have worshipped him for his kindness, and it inspired me to do well enough to pass my testing. It was decided that I should stay there for two more years – my brother had been unable to persuade them to admit me to the family then and there, which he confessed to me afterwards was what he had wanted – but I was to continue my studies, only with more tutors, and to go to Eton at thirteen.’
It was completely irrational of me to fear that some dire catastrophe had befallen him in the few hours since we parted at Liverpool Street. There was no earthly reason why in this particular five or six hours, he should have been run over by a cab, stabbed by some miscreant in the street, eaten an unkind oyster and succumbed in agony, been blown up by Fenians, contracted an inflammation of the lungs or burned down our Baker Street rooms. Yet I was consumed by anxiety lest any of those things had removed from the world the man I cherished. The man I loved, beyond any loving I thought might come to me.
After we had eaten, he supported me while I washed and changed into the nightshirt he had brought for me and then insisted that I should go to bed, and try to sleep.
Could I have played the Professor at his own game? Ensnared him in a web of lies, turned assassin, sent killers against him, set traps in my turn? I was a detective, not a master criminal - and yet, the line was a fine one: means, motive and opportunity to take that step lay temptingly before me. But had I crossed it, what reason would there have been not to join him, even to rival him in ill-doing, in a monstrous, obscene battle for who might rule the greatest empire of evil?
‘You are saddened,’ Watson laid his hand on mine, caressing it. ‘And I too. That is two young men we have seen this autumn, two wretched young souls adrift in a harsh world, where following their natural affection causes them such pain and torment. Young Housman was not ashamed – I believe he will turn all to good, in the end, or so I hope – but Knights, I very much fear, will be racked with self-torment all his days. And yet, if my reading of the literature I obtained in Vienna – and which you so very kindly translated for me, my dear chap - is correct, there is not a thing he can do about it. I endeavoured gently to persuade him of that fact, but he would not hear me, only looked at me with eyes drowned in grief, and shook his head. He believes he has sinned against God and man, that he deserves punishment: thus flowed his self-accusation. He invited punishment for the expiation of what he saw was his sin.’
‘Confound it, Watson, must you take me up on every little word? Well then, I am perhaps no longer such a Tory sympathiser as I was. You have corrupted my politics dreadfully with your advocacy on behalf of the ignorant and unwashed.’
‘Open your eyes, Holmes, let me see. How much? You are walking at least. Do you not understand what this stuff can do to you? This is not justified, even for the case, Holmes. Where the devil have you been, and with whom?’
I sprang up to join him at the window, for this was dangerous territory, quicksand, and he was sinking. I knew his nightmares still bedevilled him: he would not be the only soldier who was so haunted by his past that he laid violent hands upon himself in despair at what he had done. I had to help him see that he was no Lamson or Pay.
