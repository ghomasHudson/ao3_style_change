“To make us not perfect for each other!”
Cass looked at him, actually affronted. “I was trying to keep things as normal as I could.”
Back before the threat of the Apocalypse, angel mates numbered in the thousands, and I cannot pretend I did not wish to be among their number. The idea of having someone there for you—
The baby doll glowed more and growled.
“Another convention?” Castiel asked.
“Details?”
I shook my head. “Nothing. It’s impossible to explain.”
Sam backed up a step, then did that uncertain smile thing he did. “Let’s get you some coffee first,” he said, then swung around to get to the kitchen.
“No.”
“Yes.” Sam opens his mouth to say more, then closes it.
“I can’t be the one to make the first move! What? I’m supposed to grab your ass and see if you smite me?”
“Hell, Cass,” Dean said.
“I’ve wanted you forever, Cass,” Dean whispered. “Before I knew you were possible, back when it was just the idea of you, I wanted you.”
“Maggie,” Sam said quietly, Castiel standing at his side. “We got this.”
“Why?!”
“Yes.”
“Do you think these people have jobs?” Dean muttered to Cass. When he didn’t get an answer, he turned to see his angel was missing. Whipping around, he located several cases of bedhead and wrinkled trenches before locking onto the real deal over by a table loaded with cartoons based on
“What?”
“Who are you?”
“You’re an angel,” Dean finally said.
I should explain.
Dean watched as the hundreds of feathers in front of him raised up, fluttered slightly, and then settled back down. Castiel’s voice was tight, and Dean realized he’d seen the angel bristle in irritation.
“Angels are neither male nor—”
“Yes, Dean,” a voice grumbled into his ear. “I was there.”
“So, we both got off, but they still weren’t happy.”
The coffee was good and quite hot. I remembered developing a taste for it when I was hiding from Naomi with the angel tablet. As frantic and lonely as those days had been, it had been good to have a purpose. When Crowley had pulled the tablet from my stomach, I had felt lost, but the anger I felt at Ion for his betrayal of Heaven allowed me to focus on escape and then to pursue the tablet.
Cass opened his mouth.
“Omegas find a compatible alpha before they’re out of their teens, or they’re incompatible.”
Again, however, what should be a simple matter of A + B = C is complicated by the mental component. I am reasonably certain that Dean has had women stimulate his anal region and that he enjoyed it. The pleasure derived from my fantasy, however, is based on whether he would be able to enjoy stimulation from me.
“So you knew you were a man from the beginning,” Dean said.
Dean stared at him, and then the left end of his lip curled up. Then it flattened. Then it curled up again.
The coven began to hum, drawing power from the air and sea.
“Yes, although, if you wanted, I could.”
The obvious remedy was music.
Even with Cass’ arms around him, Dean winces. But the angel just smiles slightly and hands over Dean’s phone—from where, exactly, Dean’s not sure.
“Dean,” was all he said, though, closing his eyes and pretending just for a second everything was OK.
“We going to make each other feel good, Cass.”
“The orange chamois guy?”
For a split-second, the angel looked at him with an extreme expression the hunter didn’t recognize, but then perhaps it was just a twitch. Angels twitched, didn’t they? Cass seemed perfectly normal as he asked in confusion, “Other stuff?”
Sam is irritated enough to find his words again. “No, this is about you and Cass.”
Cass stared at him. “I don’t wear a bra, Dean.”
Dean was back to looking puzzled.
A day later, they were in a diner. Not for the first time, Cass thought about how Sam and Dean used diners the same way he had once used Biggerson’s. The wonderful sameness of it all was a sort of home even in a place he’d never been before. Castiel knew the role the Impala had played in preventing the Apocalypse, the surgical cut into Sam’s childhood memories and love for his brother brought on by the history of that tribute to American heavy metal. Diners were somewhat like that to him now. In fact, he doubted he would be able to behave properly now in a fancy restaurant.
“So, Famine?”
“Yes,” Cass said.
“Uh, well, yes. And they helped us get rid of the ghosts.”
“You'd be useful in the field, I think. If you are, I'd like you permanently on my team.”
“Cass?”
“Yes.”
Dean looked up at me, sitting across from him, and rather decisively closed his laptop. Usually, this means he wants to discuss a serious issue regarding Sam, or more recently, Jack. I nodded in approval.
Dean the turned around to see Cass doing something he’d never seen him do before. The angel had backed up against the doorjamb of the open closet and was scratching his back against the sharp edge of the wood.
“It’s done,” he/Cass said to the witches. “We’ll take him now and go.”
Dean Winchester was, well, seriously, Dean Fucking Winchester. Dean had raised him while their father was off chasing the Yellow-Eyed Demon. Dean had brought him back into the life Sam now realized he should never have tried to leave.
Dean nodded slowly, obvious satisfied and about to leave. In a moment, he would apologize for insisting, and they would likely never discuss it again.
Dean stared at him. “What was that like?”
In fact, I have found most of the truly beautiful souls are inside humans who do not fit their current society’s standards of physical beauty. I have wondered whether outer beauty in humans actually discourages inner beauty, but I’m in no position to judge this. My brother Gabriel once told me that physically lovely humans are stunted in their spiritual development because they get everything they want by smiling and “showing a bit of hoo-hah.” I have no idea if this is correct, and I have often wished for an older brother who didn’t sound like he was making crude sound effects most of them time.
Wally worried him greatly by admitting that demon hunting was all new to him. “You got a rougarou problem?” he asked. “Hey, I’m your guy. But demons? Hell. Look, I was just passing through and I heard about some cattle mutilations.”
“Sam, tell him I’m on your side,” Ruby said.
Castiel looked over at Dean, who gave him the OK. The blade slid down into his right hand.
Maybe it was just too much trouble for Michael to make up some Mrs. Dean. She’d have to be quite something to have been believable. Maybe the archangel just hadn’t wanted to bother.
Dean threw his hands up, walked away a couple of steps, and then turned around. “You’re an angel!”
“Uh, Cass?” Dean’s voice was very odd.
I opened my eyes to look at him, but the expressions I had enjoyed just a moment ago were gone. His eyes looked flat, and his mouth was set in a grim line.
It was something of an understatement to say Dean hadn’t had good luck with women. Cassie had rejected him when she learned about his life, and in her own way, Lisa had done the same.
“Look at me, please.”
I thought then, oddly, of abandoned buildings, particularly those left to rot when they were still under construction: their half-made hulls, their unmade systems, their vast expanses of nothing. Just nothing.
He looked at me in that way that he looks at Sam or Jack when he thinks they are lying.
“Jack!” Dean looked horrified. “Cass is, yeah, not a man, but he’s close enough!”
Dean looked distracted for half a second, then did a little fist pump. “Five vamps, all headless! Come get a beer.”
“Yeah, you know,” Dean said, smiling a little manically now. “For the judging.”
Dean shrugged the shoulder he wasn’t lying on. “I wouldn’t think much about it, sometimes, what with Sammy and hunting things. I figured I’d know you when I found you.”
“Just what is—”
Cass shook his head, then carefully shrugged. “There is no sense of connection to anything, actually. It is easy to stay detached, to watch humans die by the hundreds of thousands and not care.”
was what his body had been made for. The penetration felt nothing like an intrusion. This wasn’t about stimulation and getting off. It wasn’t even really about the physical part at all.
“I didn’t say that.”
“Cass!” Dean closed his eyes for a moment, trying to bring his blood pressure down. “Cass.” He looked at his friend’s hunched shoulders and averted face. “I understand, OK? I get it. You did what you had to do to save me from worse.”
Castiel frowned. “I’m an angel, Dean. We don’t have genders or gender-based preferences of any kind.”
“You told me to stand still.”
In fact, the pride I felt got me through that first bit with pure obedience: I left him in that grave.
So I went into Jimmy Novak’s body, and even while I was walking across that sigil-scribbled barn floor toward two hostile and terrified humans, part of me was still foolish enough to think, somehow, he would recognize me inside the “holy tax accountant.”
Castiel actually looked complimented, and Dean tallied one up in his score book.
Dean coughed.
With nothing else to do, for the time being, Sam went back to bed.
Dean nodded at the briefcase. “Let's crack her open. What's the worst that could happen, right?”
God, no wonder Castiel preferred humans to angels. What would that even be like? To fight alongside his brothers and sisters for thousands of years and have no bond? To know no love at all?
"Like you have in the past?" A question dryly asked, and yet there was steel now behind the words. "I'm worried about you, Spock. You're my friend. Don't push me away. I know this is serious."
“It’s, uh, it’s true,” Dean said, trying to avoid the glare of several pairs of incredulous eyes. “This is the guy who got me out of Hell.” He looked, and they were all still staring him except for Cass, who was looking at the others in turn, his head tilted in the bird-like way again.
“You’re damn right nothing else needs to be said!” Dean looked at his empty beer bottle, shot up from the table, and stalked over to the icebox to get another one, looked inside and then closed it.
The angel shifted slightly on his feet, then obviously forced himself still. “This town is not suffering from some love-gone-wrong effect. It's suffering from hunger—starvation, to be exact. Specifically: famine.” The wing outline wavered, or perhaps fluttered.
“I once lied to and betrayed you and your brother. After what I did to Jimmy Novak and his family, it’s my greatest regret.”
Even as he gripped the salt-loaded shotgun tighter, one of the overhead lights exploded, and then another and another. The front doors of the barn cracked the beam holding them in place, swinging wide to reveal a man—dark haired, stone faced—who tread without care over the painted sigils and traps. His face was first hidden and then illuminated by showers of sparks from the lights, and when Dean and Bobby emptied shot rounds into his nondescript trench coat over a dark suit, the cheap-looking material was damaged while the man’s eyes barely blinked.
Dean looked at him, eyes full of panic.
Dean, Cass, and Jack looked over Sam’s shoulder as he went through the current entrants.
By the Host, it was beautiful.
Then Kirk reached for, placing his warm weight on the Vulcan’s forearm.
Sam blinked at the compliment and gave a quick smile. “Thanks. Thanks for helping, Cass.”
Yeah, he just flat-our whimpered then, and he didn’t care.
Personally, Castiel wasn’t convinced that returning Mary Winchester to life had been a truly “good” act by Amara, but he had to confess that seeing her in the flesh, so to speak, had been an experience that affected him deeply. This was the woman who birthed the two best human beings he’d ever met, two men chosen by destiny to bring about the end of the world (no actual paradise included, as far as he could tell) and who had instead given destiny “the finger” and were working to make the world better one case at a time.
“Extremely.” A trace of satisfaction made it into Cass’ flat tone.
Cass frowned at him.
“Oh course.” Castiel stepped back. “Is everything all right?”
Castiel sighed, closed his eyes, steadied himself.
Sam knew he should call out, but Jack looked delighted (Surely he had a bit of a soul left to look that happy?), and for once Sam decided to take the moral low ground.
He just shook his head and tossed the damn cup on the floor, which was covered in rugs and pillows and candle wax. It didn’t have make a good thud.
“Woah, just from sucking me off?”
Jack turned pained eyes to Dean. “But it’s
“I’m here, Dean,” that voice said, and it was better than any music, any clap of thunder, any sound ever. “I’m sorry.”
Dean kissed my chin, my lips, my philtrum, lingering, then my lips again.
When he sobered up, though, he was still clueless.
Cass’ stress on the last word made it sound like an insult.
She laughed harder. “Did your friend drag you here?”
“That’s exactly the look you gave me back when you were working with Crowley and wouldn’t admit it.”
“No, I understand, Dean. You were able to help him.”
“Let me have you, Dean,” the angel said, and the hunter almost came all over himself right there. “I’ve been waiting to be inside you since the Carboniferous Period.”
Sam nodded absently while dialing his phone, and Jack was still staring in puzzlement at Castiel, who was looking all around them.
“Yes. Uh.” She looked over at the door as it opened to admit a man in plaid and jeans. He didn’t have Dean’s or Sam’s build, though. “Hey, Jerry.”
“I showed you me, and you didn’t like it,” I finally said.
“I’m saying while you’re pushing all the right physical buttons, we’re not going to make them happy, you’re saying, without more emotional stuff, right?”
“The last time we talked about feelings, the world was about to end and you told me I was a brother to you and Sam.”
“And, so, yeah, I kinda forgot about all that. And then, damnit.” Dean looked down then, and I opened my mouth to apologize before his head snapped back up. “No, don’t do that. It’s not about saying you did something wrong. You were just you. I want you to be you.”
On the back of Dean’s t-shirt was a pair of wings.
“She said she wouldn’t take him until he was happy. So I figure, you guys make each other happy, and Cass is thinking the Shadow will come and take him away, this time for good.”
He had turned his back on his brothers and sisters, and his reward was a note left for him in an empty Bunker.
“And the, what, the first time? I was lying there all out of it and you jerked me off, right?”
Cass was waiting for them, holding out a full mug with a blank expression on his face. Dean took it, looked over the three of them, held up a finger, drank half the mug, and then set it down on the metal counter.
Cass.
With all the sore muscles, all the slick everywhere, the deep desire to burn the motel room to the ground when it was over, what Dean most remembered about those three days was his heartbeat.
“Well—” Dean began.
“What?” Cass asked.
For a while, Castiel just rested there, head down, shoulders slumped against the weight of what he had been the last time he had touched his instrument and what he was now. He had fallen so hard and so far, and yet he regretted not an inch of it. How could something he had made then accept him when he could not in good faith even apologize?
You see, my sin wasn’t born of pride, but of jealousy.
He grinned again. “Sure. Go for it.”
“You must have played for me before, but I don’t remember it.”
He laughed then, softly, and then yawned. “We should clean up,” he mumbled, already half-asleep.
He flinched, obviously hiding his hurt. “I had no—”
“Cass!”
He’d timed it well. John was off somewhere, Sammy was at Bobby’s, and Dean was supposed to be hunting some ghoul in Texas. He’d checked into a motel complete with photos of spurs and chaps, warned the front desk he was invoking heat privacy, and brought a suitcase half-filled with sex toys, pretty much all of them still in their blister packs.
They crouched down, took a look each, and popped the lid. Warn, bright light blared out with the faintest hint of a chime. Blinking, they both looked away until they were able to look back, but the case was empty.
“Yes.”
“And we both agreed the risk was too great.”
Sam’s instincts didn’t like the sound of that. Chewing on his pen, Sam’s reasoning liked it even less. Castiel wasn’t human. Even without his grace, it was more a question of being “mortal” than being human. A human could suck up an angel’s grace all they liked. At best, it would kill them quickly. Castiel was also incredibly old, and clever, and skilled.
After a few couples made it to the stage, Dean started to pay attention to the level of applause, so when he and Cass finally made it to the platform, he appreciated the loud screams and chants of “You’re so hot!” that followed.
Dean knocked on his door and then, oddly, just walked right in and shut the door behind him.
She was way too young.
“You have a harp? An angel harp?”
“They are,” Castiel told him. “But some dolls are rare, and so people pay more for them.”
“So, three days ago, Collin Woodrow was found in the same position after just having purchased a $35,000 Brinns Victorian doll at auction. Again, nothing was missing except the doll.”
But still, the idea of taking an angel’s mate away from them was abhorrent even then. I suppose that’s something.
Dean would have regretted being crude, but Cass seemed to appreciate the direct question, and nodded.  “Yes.”
“Yeah, if you don’t mind.”
“Stay here with me, Dean.”
To my unutterable relief, I heard his feet walk away from the door. But of course, they came back a moment later. Then he fiddled with the lock, and the door opened.
Whatever flippant thing Dean was about to say just up and died on his lips when Castiel leaned over him to put the phone on the nightstand and then reared up and back, his eyes never leaving Dean’s. Quietly, he moved the covers away from the omega’s body and then looked over his lightly freckled skin, lips pursed slightly as he tilted his head, bird-like, and did another slow circuit.
A good ten seconds went by in silence.
No, the videos, all about twenty seconds long, were candles and smoke, poses and hands and his skin, runes and chanting, and more damn candles, like some sort of Wiccan Casa Erotica porn. Dean saw his face with his eyes wide open and glassy, his body often painted with makeup and more runes.
“Only because you’re adding things in your head as though they have no will of their own. Put two apples together in a bag, then five days later take them out, and you still have two apples. They’ve done nothing in the meantime. Living creatures, let alone humans, don’t function that way.”
“Look—”
Dean thought about for a minute. “Sammy and me, when we’re in the car listening to music, you know, I mean, I get it, I think.” He frowned. “But I thought the other angels didn’t like you.”
“Help me,” he was moaning. “Help me, Cass.”
Castiel laughed quite a while after that, even chuckling inside at the unbelievable feeling when Dean was rocking within his body, radiating out little bursts of hedonism he savored all the way to his toes.
I looked up at the stars and thought again of Melek and Vangelis, Thertarmiel and Govad, Chamuel and Reuel. Oddly, they brought me comfort, knowing that then angels had roared out their need for each other and been answered in kind.
“Would you stop screwing around with your clothes and come over here?” I demanded, surprising us both.
Sam and Jack were waiting in Santísimo when two men in jeans, Hawaiian shirts, leather flip-flops, and sunglasses walked inside.
“You need to bring Owen to me. He’s too closely watched at the hospital.”
In a thought, the harp was tucked away in his pocket. With another, he moved to the door and opened it.
“Cass,” he whispered, and then we were kissing again. He was beyond talented at the art. His lips and tongue and teeth worked at my mouth until I felt dizzy.
“Can you make yourself forget it?”
So he had to watch his best friend start to fold up into himself for at least three seconds before he managed to clear his throat.
After Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean and brought them to just outside the gate, Dean blinked away a few stars, fixed his alpha’s tie, and nodded. Together they walked inside the yarn and toward Bobby’s house, from which quickly poured several people.
“Castiel, after all this time, do you still not understand that you are special?”
“It’s no thing.”
seemed etched into the dim light beneath his eyelids. A warm, solid, heavy arm lay along his waist and curled around to the warm, soft, light hand against his stomach.
I cannot imagine, and I do not wish to try, what it has been like for angels to lose their mates in battle. You may sneer at me for what I considered a mercy at the time, but when I killed so many in Heaven when I was—I will be kind enough to myself to call it insane—I never took half of a couple. Even in my sheer delirium and egotism that I was God, I could not conceive of taking an angel’s mate away from them.
“Dean says your hunt went well.”
“Why are most of them female?” Castiel asked.
“Dean?”
At the thought, Sam waited for his body to gag, his brain to short-circuit, and his soul to run off screaming.
He shook his head. “No, I really don’t think you do.” And then he took a step closer to me, very much encroaching on my personal space, and kissed me.
That didn’t help. Dean looked even angrier.
Sam thought about the first time he and Cass had gotten to the same level of friendship the angel and Dean shared, when he’d talked about what it meant to be human and given Sam hope that he could change. He thought about when Cass had come back from not just the dead but the Empty, standing at the pay telephone in a smelly back alley.
Many years ago, Dean Winchester asked me what I was going to do with my last night alive and was then dismissive of my plan to sit quietly. At the time, I didn’t understand what he meant about Bert and Ernie’s sexual orientation, but I did understand that somehow he took it as a personal affront that I should die without having experienced sex.
Dean and Cass ended up on the sagging sofa, their sides pressed lightly together, Bobby sat behind his desk, and everyone else grabbed a chair from the kitchen.
Could I make him feel good? Could I make him orgasm while saying my name?
“This has nothing to do with me or Eileen or anything other than just you and Castiel.” Sam shrugged and put his hands out. “Think about it, Dean. No one on this planet besides me loves you as deeply as Cass does. Think about what you might be throwing away here.”
“Evidently my reticence to engage as an equal in this prevented the level or type of pleasure the coven is seeking,” Cass in this memory said.
“It’s an ‘angel thing,’ all right? Just let it go.”
“Yeah!” Dean said, heading to the refrigerator. “Think you know a guy.”
“Touch me, damn it.” He pushed his hips up, feeling the last lip of the satin slide away from his leaking aching cock. “I need to come while you watch. I need to feel you. Fuck, Cass, now.”
“So, that's what was in the briefcase? The Twinkie dude's soul?”
“I was there, Sam,” Cass said, oddly fierce. “He was under their thrall, and freeing him was an ordeal he would just as well do never to remember.”
Ray shrugged awkwardly. “I just meant people have made comments to me before. Nothing major, nothing I wanted to bother you with. They were aimed at me, not you. I'm just saying this isn't an isolated incident.”
He turned back around, and all Dean could see was a pair of concerned blue eyes.
“Cass!” Dean leaned forward over the table. “You are a male angel right now. Right? You’re Jimmy Novak-style, male angel!”
“Dean?” Sam asked, staring at Cass.
Spock spoke with a perfectly strangled voice. It was obvious their little cplayers had true feelings for each other, if disappointing that “Kirk” was a female.
Castiel looked at him.
I had never thought of myself as empty before. Lonely, yes, but not empty. Only as Dean began to fill the hollow of my chest, the emptiness of my thoughts, had I realized how hollow I was.
He let Dean flip through the channels for a while then watched in some bemusement when he stopped, enthralled at an infomercial about an orange chamois that soaked cola up through a patch of carpet. Castiel wondered how Offer Shlomi, an Israeli-American, managed to fake such deeply compelling enthusiasm for a bit of spun rayon. Was this what his heritage and dreams had been destined for?
Dean frowned at me. “Don’t be sorry. It’s not, this isn’t—” He shook his head then set his mouth almost like he was going into a bar brawl. “Don’t feel sorry about anything, all right? As long as you’re in this with me—”
I opened my mouth, found it empty of words, and closed it again.
Three frowns were now directed Dean’s way. Then Cass cleared his face and gently shook his head.
“On stage?” Castiel asked.
A chorus of voices spoke from the cauldron: “
“Yes.” Castiel nodded sagely. “Dean would never want to get physical with a human male body.”
“Cass!” he shouted, and I soaked in the knowledge of that desperate tone even as I came, jumping into the whited-out pleasure of it all.
You see, when I realized Dean and I would never be mated, I allowed myself to fantasize.
“Can we lie down?” I asked.
Dean didn’t really remember the details of the next couple of days. It was more a sort of collage of sensations. He remembered desperately humping the mattress. He remembered chewing through the plastic to get to the blue dildo—all the toys he’d brought were blue—and then shoving it up his backside so fast he came all over the bedspread.
“Really?” Jack asked.
Castiel found his hands had raised, patting the air soothingly. “Dean, you weren’t really you then. You were close to forgetting how to swallow, how to breathe. I’m sure whatever I said—”
Castiel shrugged. “There was nothing on TV except another infomercial.”
Dean looked slightly dubious, but stepped into the bathroom and shut the door. Castiel heard the rustle of clothing, and then liquid hitting the water in the toilet and nodded to Sam while Rowena pretended to look into her bag.
Castiel appeared beside him, which was great. The car was crammed with barely-there feathers, which was not.
“Dean.” And then Castiel ran out of words.
“There’s an artificial smell of the sea in here,” Castiel noted.
A moment later, they were all standing inside an abandoned cathedral, the size and old-style grandeur of which told Dean right away they were no longer in America.
His harp was there, just sitting there.
It was the most incredible thing I have ever seen.
“Thank you, Dean.”
“Were you playing music?” Dean asked, frowning and looking behind him.
Sam took a breath, then another. “I’m going to talk to them.”
contest was announced over a loudspeaker, and Cass and Dean moved over to the line for the stage.
Dean stood there a moment, then looked at Castiel. “Do I?”
“Cass!” Dean screamed, coming in thick ropes of semen after hours of denied orgasm. And for a while there, everything was just sort of blurry and gray and warm.
So that night I thought I was about to die, sitting there in Jimmy Novak’s vessel in what truly was a den of iniquity, I wanted to trust Dean. I wanted to believe that the sad woman with so many wounds on her soul was going to give me at least something of the pleasure I had seen so many of my brothers and sisters enjoy. When Dean handed me the money with the inexplicable directions not to order “off the menu,” I followed that poor woman down the hall in the terrified hope that there would be something, frankly anything, I could savor.
“You’re telling me, I mean, with your power—”
“Just for a moment.”
Dean nodded while coughing.
Her arm twitched in a way Dean knew meant she wanted to pull her firearm as she took a step back.
He didn’t need it.
“Above all else,” he said. “Above food and water, above shelter, above love and success, sentient beings need to be recognized, need to be known by others, even if not accepted. The validation of being seen, of being heard: the angels know of no intelligent creature that does not need that first, before anything else.”
“Why?”
And Sam had no idea how to start.
“We tried storm the mansion then,” Cass said, taking the hose from Sam and spraying at the crusted wheel in front of him. “But they had erected angel warding, and Sam couldn’t break in. Jack . . .” Cass looked over at Sam.
“I waited for you too, Cass.”
“Why did you do that?” I asked.
Dean turned to look at him. “What does that mean?”
Right.
“I’m fine, Dean.”
Pleasure was rising up now, overtaking even his sensations of being awake, of being whole, of being right. It was fire, and his blood pressure fluctuated like he was falling and flying at the same time. Everything in his body clenched or relaxed as needed.
For several minutes, neither of them spoke or moved much beyond breathing.
He kept that thought to himself, loosened his tie, and showed the wound as it crept in as black spider webs all over his vessel. This wasn’t something the Winchesters could fix.
He was less pleased with the, “Oh my God! Kiss! Kiss!” screams, but he was less puzzled than Castiel, who looked at the “shippers” with open dismay. This only set the screamers off, and the chanting of “Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!” actually got organized.
“Aggy,” the man said.
Jack made a small noise.
Dean frowned. “The gas station and the motel, that was you talking?”
“Yeah, I figured that much. I mean, what are you?”
“So, Famine just rolls into town, and everybody goes crazy?” Sam asked.
“Sam! The thing dead, whatever it was?”
“The angel in the dirty coat who’s in love with you.”
He didn’t answer, and I was outside the bunker before I really started paying attention to anything again. It was dark, but I was still enough of an angel that it didn’t matter.
Anyway, Dean comes into the bunker under a witch’s spell desperate to fuck. Yes, desperate. He’s sweating. He’s trembling. He’s—
“Sam,” Cass growled. “That’s unimportant, particularly right now.”
“What if I prove to be a liability in the field?”
“Yes.”
“Then, well, we should leave now.”
Powerful, hot, and hard, Cass thrust inside him, setting everything Dean could feel to maximum. Several more thrusts followed, each perfect. Dean spared a thought for partners who had fucked him before and knew how nothing, really, the whole ordeal had been. He’d come, and it had felt all right. But so what?
In another second, he was lying on the green-and-gold bed in the crappy motel with those Cass-warm arms around him.
“Show me, damn it, Cass.”
“The car is fine,” Castiel said. “But it’s been through a lot.”
“Jack,” Dean said. “Listen closely. Cass and I are not thinking about any such thing.”
Jack frowned. “There is a great difference between secret and private. I understand.” Then he moved toward Sam’s room, Sam in tow.
“Yes, Dean.”
“Then help!”
Castiel hunched slightly.
“As they had been particularly critical of my clothed state, I walked back to your room and took off my clothes.”
Dean seemed taken aback, which frankly pissed Castiel off.
“Do what?”
“I know an eternity of things you don’t!”
Castiel tilted his head in a way Dean positively did not find endearing. “I told you.”
The man smiled and seemed kind. “Not at all.”
Castiel looked down and shook his head. “I do understand what you’re trying to do. I even appreciate it. But Dean is the man he is
“Why?” the angel asked.
“Damn it, Cass,” he whispered.
Dean needed what Michael couldn’t fake.
“And then Sam and Rowena—”
But she shook her head. “I feel like a fraud. Not gay.”
Sam shrugged. “Well, they’re both in the kitchen, and we don’t currently have a case.”
“Hey!”
“I would never—”
And finally, the angel just allowed himself to admit he was lonely.
Cass nodded. “Yes.”
“Well, I get the idea, but what we’ve done has been pretty, uh.” He discarded about a half-dozen words. “Clinical.”
Jack nodded. “I have a book I want to read.”
“I’m looking at two of three people I care most about in the world and telling them they could be happy.”
Cass shrugged. “Angels are just angels.”
“I assure you—”
Castiel smiled, but Dean was looking at him oddly now.
Instantly, I recognized them as a part of the logo for Metallica, an American heavy metal band formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist and guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich. I knew Dean enjoyed them and that Sam and Jack enjoyed them somewhat less, but still enough to classify the sensation of listening to their music as pleasurable.
“I’m here, Dean.”
“For what?” the brothers asked.
Once Sam, Dean, and their mother were safely back in the Bunker after their horrific capture, imprisonment, and asinine deal with Billy, Lucifer had been pulled out of the president, and Castiel had apologized deeply to Lily Sumner, the angel found himself, as he often did at night, looking through the archives.
But he was still without a flight, without a chorus.
For a moment, an hour, Spock pressed his lips to the back of that hand, then, so slowly, Spock opened his lips just slightly, to taste him.
“Are you and Dean having one of your fights?”
“Woah.”
“I can retrieve that for you if it becomes important,” Castiel told her. “But I doubt that will be the case.”
“What? You screw around with me and Cass and you want to know what?”
“You don’t really have feathers,” Dean muttered.
“But you’re still here,” Dean told Cass.
“Cass?” Dean asked.
Cass nodded. “I’m sorry, Dean.”
“Cass, damn it, look at me.”
“I won’t,” he/Cass said. “Of course I won’t.”
“OK, me and Cass what?”
“Why?”
Excuse me while I admit to finding that admirable.
Dean frowned at him.
Jack pulled back, not meeting his eyes. Sam looked a little spooked.
Jack turned to face Sam and Dean. “Castiel gave up his life to get me back from the Empty. He asked me not to tell you, so you wouldn’t worry.” He looked back to Cass. “I’m sorry, but they should know.”
The feeling intensified when Dean began kissing me back.
McKay finally stopped typing and crossed his arms over his chest, inadvertently emphasizing the way his nipples poked out against his light blue science shirt. “Why would I do that?”
I thought about the day I came back from the Empty. I replayed in my mind both Dean’s and Sam’s unutterable joy in my presence. It was the last time we knew a moment that harmonious.
So, I looked back at him. The green of Dean’s eyes makes me think of a perpetual Tuesday afternoon of an autistic man who drowned in a bathtub. They are the color of hope in that light over the water in
But while we know each other, we do not—I don’t quite know how to say it—we do not seek to look past the company file, I suppose.
They both looked startled.
“Yes.”
Castiel just looked at her.
Sam hugged his brother while Rowena explained the spell. Soon afterwards, Dean announced he was starving, and Rowena took her leave—without the Black Grimoire—and Sam took Dean to a 24-hour waffle house.
Most strongly of all, he remembered one moment, a few
“To march across the land.”
In all, it took about an hour before Castiel looked like his normal self with a display of million-dollar wings on his back. With a last shiver, Cass flexed them inside the car, then folded them away.
“Cass, just, can you stand still for just a second?”
“My wings are not relevant. I’ll take care of them momentarily. What’s much more important is that Famine is hungry. He must devour the souls of his victims.”
(See the end of the chapter for
But in the next second, the Beanie Baby went
“Jack, you need to understand.” At this point, Castiel dropped his voice so low and quiet Sam had to strain to hear. “There is absolutely nothing in the world I hold dearer than my friendship with Sam and Dean and you. They are my brothers, and you are my son. You told them about my deal with the Shadow, but what you didn’t tell them, what perhaps you still don’t understand, is that I would make that deal a hundred times over. And I would do the same for Dean or for Sam.
Jack is looking at me.
“What?” he asked.
He put his fingers into the angel’s dark hair, and it was smooth and sleek and soft. He thought about rubbing that head of hair over his nipples, around his balls, along the tip of his cock, and then Castiel was gripping the base of his dick once more.
Dean blinked. “You can’t reach behind your own back? You’re an angel!”
On cue, Dean’s stomach growled. Frowning but ultimately trusting Cass, he took the cup and downed the contents in one go. After a moment, he did feel a lot better, only realizing how awful his headache had been when it left and how much his stomach was rolling over when it calmed down.
“Yes.”
“No, I’m not going away.”
” he heard Sam asking before Castiel snapped his phone shut.
Ah, and now it was my turn to feel “effeminate,” and what a poisonous term that was now. I saw why human men use it to turn off an emotion or behavior they didn’t like. It wasn’t hatred of women as much as it was just foreign, which is odd. I’m an angel, and thus neither male nor female. But I have been inhabiting a human male body for years without a break. I lived as a human in this form, with male genitalia and male hormones and male balance and form. To stop behavior I didn’t want, I could call the behavior childish, but that wasn’t as foreign to me now as “female.” It made no sense, but it was true.
“Dean obviously cares for Castiel as much as he cares for any of us. More even, in some ways.”
The angel frowned at him.
“Maybe a few minutes, then. I mean, you’re right. It’s important. But I just want to talk to you about something.”
“Cass, what the hell?”
“You’re my omega, Dean.” The words seemed to drip with pleasure, like honey. “I want to have you open your sweet pink lips and moan with the idea of having me in your mouth. I want you hard with the thought of it. I want to fuck your perfect face and have you beg me for more. I want you to lie there, not moving, not even breathing enough to choke on me, while I shove this ridiculous human organ I’ve borne without purpose for millennia inside your body and feel you come apart with pleasure.”
“Yes, Dean?” I ran over the last few sentences of conversation. They were talking about adapting Jack’s ideas to Angel Radio. “I doubt the application itself would be difficult,” I said. “But considering the limited data inputs these days, I’m not sure how useful it would be. Still, I will pass along the information to Duma.”
“Cass.”
“Right. And why would an angel either rescue me from hell or just so happen to be my long-lost alpha?”
“The Archangel Raphael,” Castiel said. “He’s not pleased with my interference.”
The coven reached a fever pitch, then went silent. The massive ship shuddered ever so slightly. A mate in the control room noticed but went back to her usual midnight duties when it wasn’t repeated.
Something came out of the dark right toward Sam’s head. He was able to duck it, but he felt it whip through his hair. Then came a sort of hic-cup and wail, which he and Jack ran toward (proving once again that hunters often lack basic survival instincts).
OK, well. Cass was right, then. An angel thing.
The angel held the blade up somewhat uncertainly and then, realizing she wanted to hold it, passed it over with the eagerness of someone approaching the dentist’s chair.
Sam thought about Castiel’s torture of demons. He thought about Castiel from the alternate universe whom AU Charlie had described. She’d literally been unable to quantify the pain of that interrogation. And their own Cass had tortured as well. Donatello sprang to mind.
“Which is why Wally called us,” Mary said. Castiel again felt she was hiding something. “Asking for help. So, are we all clear on the plan?”
He stood up and paced to the little kitchen and then back, looking down on Castiel, who had gone back to staring at the floor.
“Washing over a beach head of Army surplus.”
“Yes.”
I did not know for what purpose I had been sent to retrieve and restore Dean Winchester. It was only pride in my work—the right kind of pride then—that motivated me to make him perfect and whole. And I committed every second of that transformation to careful memory in case I were ever called on to restore him again.
“It will help,” Cass said, not meeting his eyes.
Whatever.
Castiel turned away a bit, the faint outline of his wings moving with him. He was obviously quoting: “‘And then will come Famine riding on a black steed. He will ride into the land of plenty and great will be the Horseman's hunger, for he is hunger. His hunger will seep out and poison the air.’”
But sex, children or not, wasn’t really the focus of Sam’s research. He wanted something more long-term and emotionally solid. He was also hoping for something more “Cinderella” than “Romeo and Juliet.” Hell, at this point he’d settle for
“OK,” he said. “Let’s try that.”
With a groan and a wince, he got out of bed and staggered over to the sink, flicking a glance at the mirror before he reached for the faucet.
“I could make it so that you remembered.” Cass look at him intently. “Surely, you don’t want that, Dean. I can tell you the facts. There’s no need to take you back there.”
Dean turned around.
“Is there something you need, Colonel?”
“I haven't asked her.”
A warm hand closed over him as well, and it was odd how getting jerked off still didn’t feel as good as the kissing. It was more sexual, sure, but it wasn’t as intimate. Cass’ hand could have been any guy’s, and guys didn’t really do it for Dean in the first place.
Ah, I understood it now. “Quite clearly,” I said and smiled.
I used every bit of knowledge and skill I had to make him just as he had been, minus a few scars and some plaque in his arteries. I gave his liver a little polish as well.
Cass nodded gratefully.
“No, Fraser, no letters.” Ray rubbed his eyes, then looked up, straightening his posture just a bit. “Look, we're going to talk about this, okay? Then we're not going to talk about it again.”
They found a box that looked like a makeshift crib, and inside it, wrapped in little blankets, was an antique baby doll, its eyes glowing faintly purple. Another object—a plastic baby bottle—came at him, striking him in the chest with a force that would have killed him if it hadn’t been so lightweight. Still stung.
“Dean,” Castiel said with concern, then laid his hand on the man’s face.
But I wasn’t thinking about the scale of the universe that morning when I walked into the kitchen. I was only thinking about Sam and Dean and Jack, and that was quite enough for an angel who lives in a bunker.
“Jack and I will question the local farmers after the ship leaves,” Sam said.
“Sam,” the angel in question cut in. “I think you should stop this now.”
“Dean, I need to—”
“Now, I know this, Huey over there knows it, Elaine knows it, and Welsh knows it. That's why he showed us the letter. That's why he didn't have to do anything except show us the letter. He's leaving it up to us.”
“They aren’t unique, but they vary greatly.”
“Who are you?”
“With your holy abracadabra, can you use it to make yourself forget about it?”
Around the time the Great Pyramids were being built, Castiel and his brothers and sisters had once performed a piece that made even Michael weep. If he tried, the angel could recall every single perfect note.
“What the hell was that?”
Naked, we stood there a moment and regarded each other. I thought briefly of Thertarmiel and his incredible mating exhibition. But were Dean and I not now spread bare and wider than a galaxy? There was nothing I would not show him now. If he wanted to see my bowels I would cut myself open and display them.
“Do you remember when I found you at the river in Purgatory?”
Jack refused to make eye contact. “I mean, I’ve read all the books, and some of them don’t really make it clear that Sam is much taller than you, and the way the books describe your bodies—”
His fingers plucked absent strings.
Harp in his pocket, he opened up and saw Dean standing there in his boxer briefs, t-shirt, and bathrobe. He looked puzzled.
Dean let go and stepped back with a child-like glee that Castiel had seen before, if rarely, but with a lack of shadows that was completely new.
“But if Dean made you happy—”
The heat of him washed over me next. Dean’s soul burns so brightly that I saw him across Hell, and his body is hot too. Physically, I mean. He is decidedly exothermic, and even through our shirts I felt it like a topical drug.
Dean knew his own equipment was fine, especially for an omega in hiding, But it wasn’t—
“Dinosaurs,” Jack said. “I was talking about dinosaurs.”
“Buddy, next time, lower the volume.”
Dean frowned at him. “So, you think maybe you’ve found the future Mrs. Winchester and you think me and Cass should round things off?”
Then the angel’s lip twitched.
“Angel or someone who’s your alpha?”
Cass was quiet, but obviously thinking, so Dean carefully went after other fuzzy-looking feathers. Each one dropped easily away before disappearing. Once he figured out what he was looking for, it was easy to see the others. And as he worked, getting rid of dozens of feathers, he could feel Cass not so much relax as unclench.
“Was that harp music?” Sam asked, looking up from the laptop he’d set on the kitchen table.
With a sudden insight, Castiel realized the last time he’d “touched” his “harp” was right after the incident with killing the little female Nephilim, the girl who turned out to be the all-too-human daughter of Lily Sunder. Some part of him must have known even then that something was horribly wrong.
“Why?” Sam stared at him in defiance, heart thumping with hope.
“At 10:45, demon comes home,” Dean said. “Sam and I will be waiting for him. I’ll pop him with a devil’s trap bullet.”
Dean had sealed up his heart after Lisa and Ben, and though he’d made comments and flirted with basically anything since then, Sam knew his brother had decided he was done with finding a better half.
At one point, Dean sauntered off to the men’s room, and Sam looked at him while picking at an egg white omelet.
“Why not? It’s so pretty.”
Dean nodded knowingly.
“Mine,” Cass was saying. “All those years I watched you, wanted you. And now your life’s warmth is around me. The perfection of your body is open to me, wanting me.”
Castiel took the phone again with a frown then finally reacted.
“Cass,” Sam said, sounding almost hurt.
Or perhaps a bottle of good scotch, or better yet, a case of cheap scotch.
“So, angels really do have harps?”
Castiel knew he was gaping like a fish but couldn’t get his mouth to close.
Dean narrowed his eyes. “You’re lying.”
“I would like to walk,” the angel said, and then left.
And then, hesitantly, me. Castiel, as I had been once, leader of the Earth Garrison just before I and my platoon breached Hell, my angel blade held aloft in flame and triumph, my energy bright with my confidence in God’s mission. And then again, me, now, standing in a small room inside a bunker, wings broken, powers fading, but my adoration for the man in front of me burning just as brightly as my angel blade had once not that long ago.
Dean and Jo—bleh.
“Sammy, I’ve told you,” Dean said around a mouth of beef and bun and bacon, “no rabbit food.”
“I do.” I got my eyes open then, filling with sudden pride at how wrecked he looked. “I do, very much. I just needed a moment.” I shrugged, feeling foolish now. “I’m sorry.”
“I’m not buying what you’re selling; so, who are you really?” Dean stepped back a little, but it didn’t help.
“OK, yeah. I kinda remember that.”
If nothing else, he could keep an eye on Rowena. He’d let her get the better of him once, but if he ever caught her muttering a spell his way again, she’d find out angel blades were even more effective than witch-killing bullets.
Blue eyes glowered at him, not hiding the pain behind them.
And on his next page:
Wisely, I believe, I kept that thought to myself. But I let the sentiment show in my eyes.
Jack looked at him with slightly narrowed eyes. “You don’t sound like it’s going to be just for a moment.”
“But you could be more if you wanted to.”
“Are you drunk?”
Cass’ lips firmed, and a second his eyes burned with anger. He put two fingers to Dean’s forehead.
“Hey, uh, guys,” Sam started, sitting down at the table with them. “Got a minute? Something I’ve been wanting to talk to you both about.”
“All right, what happened next?” Dean asked. “They said no, and you, what did you do?”
“So?” Dean asked.
Sam cringed, but he really didn’t want to write “Dean” and “sex” in the same sentence.
“That’s what?” Castiel asked.
Then he wrote the sentence that mattered the most:
“Of course,” I said, and I held him against me as he closed his eyes and went under. For hours, he slumbered in my arms, his face at peace as he breathed, in and out, in and out.
Benny obviously didn't get it, so Ray shook him off before he could apologize. “Look, Benny. The truth doesn't matter. Some joker out there thinks we're . . .” Ray ducked a bit, and his voice was low and quiet. “. . . an item. Welsh is letting us know we gotta think about the way we act with each other in public. He's leaving it up to us to figure out how to keep this from happening again.”
“So he loves strange women in bars more than Castiel?”
So his heart had been pumping hard enough to move his shirt when he was checking into the place, eyes glancing at the alpha bronco rider poster on the wall, her head back in a rictus of domination than had stirred up his cock and made perspiration clammy up his forehead.
Mandy, who had not been even remotely interested in Dean for some unfathomable reason, smiled at him in a way that even Castiel could understand.
Bobby was breathing and deeply asleep, and the man was looking through one of their books like he was in some public library.
“Angels are made to serve,” Castiel said quietly. “And we are made to form a community. We power Heaven. We care for humans’ souls. Even in conflict, we support each other.”
But seriously, if Castiel had ever wondered (and yes, he had) if he and Dean could be a bit more to each other than brothers in arms, the man’s absolute dismissal of about a thousand clues made the answer clear enough.
But seriously, was there anyone better for Dean than Cass?
Dean’s eyes shot open.
“Oh,” Dean said, sounding disappointed. “You didn’t like it.”
“You’re saying we need to protect them, but we don’t know from what, other than that it’s some sort of spell?” Castiel asked.
I thought of the various notes of hedonism his voice would make, the clench of his muscles, the outbreak of perspiration, the tremble of his bones. While I applied suction, I would run my hands up the backs of his thighs, over the swell of his ass, and then down again, registering every last sound and smell and—
“Yes.”
The angel looked like someone had punched him in the chest. His words actually wheezed. “He wouldn’t do that.”
Dean put up his hands. “No, I mean, I’m not saying yes, OK? I’m just, I’m just—I don’t know what I am.”
THE END
He’s wondered a thousand times now if it would have been different with his mother still alive. If he hadn’t had to be Sammy’s surrogate nanny, would his nurturing side have been less obvious? Would his father’s eyes have still looked at him that particularly damning way?
“Because you are heterosexual,” Cass said.
Spock groaned, “Do not beg me.”
The others nodded in thought, while I made sure my coat concealed my erection. I wondered if Dean liked to be rimmed.
“If you wouldn’t mind.”
“You like our chances, then?” Dean asked.
Without really thinking about it, he launched into Frank Mills’ “Music Box Dancer,” then knew he’d gotten it right when Dean hummed the baseline. He ran through the somewhat repetitive piece several times until Dean started to look puzzled.
Dean closed his eyes, reveling as the moisture seeped into his dry eyes and spread relief—fleeting, but blessed relief.
Anyway. Whereas Dean had only been with women, as far as Sam knew, which was far enough, Castiel might just be the exception.
“So it hurt like hell, but you found a way to make it a positive.” He couldn’t help shooting his lunch companion a little eye salute. “Always a smart soldier.”
Castiel had to reset a little. “I agreed with your cause.”
magazine from December 10, 1945. The cover feature was on party dresses, but he found the article on appropriate birthday presents much more interesting. He had never actually tried to give Sam or Dean a present—not like Amara, who had given Dean the gift of his resurrected mother without preparing either of them for the experience. Was anyone really surprised she was having trouble adjusting?
“Well, no offense, Jack. But I think the fewer spectators the better.”
When Dean knelt up on the bed and hugged him, it was with the same innocent intensity of when he had found him in Purgatory.
“What’s troubling you, Sam?” Castiel asked.
I stood there in Dean’s room and looked around while he, of all things, tidied, as though I didn’t know what his jeans looked like lying on the floor. As though I hadn’t seen—perhaps that was it, though. Perhaps he didn’t want me thinking about what I had seen. Maybe he was trying to set the stage for our—
Jack thought about this for a while.
he is. I believe the universe, let alone his own brother, would be foolish to ask him to change such a fundamental aspect of himself.”
Several days followed. To his sorrow, Mary again didn’t stay with her sons. Castiel understood her complex situation, but he mourned for his friends.
So I stepped forward in the gap between us, putting my hands firmly to his hips, bring him in as I parted my lips to meet his the way I wanted, opening him up, curling my tongue inside him and shuddering at the heat there. His tongue was rough and giving, and the taste of him was sweet and savory at the same time.
“Jane Turabian was found dead last night in her three-bedroom apartment only twelve hours after she took possession of a $40,000 Kia The Water Nymph doll sold at auction. Police found her lying face-down in a pool of her own blood in her bathroom. Regardless of all the art and electronics in the place, the only thing missing was the doll.”
“I don’t understand,” Castiel said. “What sort of contest?”
“This isn’t about me.”
"You have discussed this with Doctor McCoy?"
Maggie, however, was standing there.
Now he was writing quickly.
“Can we just start over from square one?” Jo asked, looking even younger than usual in a white t-shirt and jeans, sitting very close to her mother as though to hide the scent of her omega distress. He noticed she had new boots, looking shiny with flowers on the toe.
“What else?”
All he had was:
Tentatively, a warm hand settled into the space between his neck and shirt collar, and as much as he could without doing the man harm, he shared the sensation of true celestial harmony.
“Not exactly a conference room,” Bobby muttered.
“Castiel?” Sam asked, only speaking first because Jack was speechless, staring at the angel.
“This can’t be real,” Dean muttered, closing his eyes. “This cannot be real.”
Dean protested, and everyone looked (gratifyingly) miserable, which then made him feel incredibly guilty. It occurred to Castiel that he hadn’t felt as much a member of a true family since the Fall of Mankind.
“Nixe,” Madame Laveau whispered. For this ritual, the couple was definitely her second favorite.
It was much easier to pull Cass in close then and just be close to him in a familiar, if somewhat less “brotherly” hug. It was oddly familiar to wrap his arms around his back and just hold him a minute, and he was thinking of that time Cass had offered to “go with” him to see Amara, basically to keep him company and incidentally die at his side.
Castiel’s blue eyes flooded with compassion. “It has been so very difficult for you, Dean. As much as I have struggled with waiting thousands of years to finally meet you, I know for you it has been worse. Watching your father scorn you when you presented and then preen over Sam when he proved himself an alpha. Taking your suppressants before you even had a heat. Waiting for someone who didn’t come, someone who seemed was never going to come to claim you.”
“Then what? Who did?”
“Told ya! Absolute nuts for the books! Including the, you know, the fan guides and tech manuals.”
When it came, the heat had been nothing less than brutal. Screwed all to cock with the meds in his system, to say nothing of his hormones freaking out after years of being chemically shackled, he hadn’t gone into estrus so much as gone insane.
“So you came back that second time, and?”
“I’m sorry I can’t do a proper display,” I said, which was odd because I didn’t particularly feel like I wanted to say it. But then my mouth kept on going. “I would adorn myself with stars for you, Dean. I would—”
“Huh,” Dean said. He hadn’t thought about that yet.
Castiel smiled and sat down across from Sam. The small stool was as uncomfortable as always, but his fingers had finally stilled.
Castiel just frowned at them both and said nothing.
Sam waited, but Cass didn’t continue.
“Actually, Hell’s a good place to start,” Dean said, looking around himself.
It reminds me, as the humans say, to “keep it in my pants.”
Jack nodded slowly. “And how can I help?”
Cass half-shrugged. “Not the same way, but yes, you do. We’re family.”
“Cass, open the damn door.”
“I’m not a bird, Dean.”
Dean nodded.
Dean rubbed his forehead and pinched the bridge of his nose, exhaling deeply. “Obey what, Cass?”
“She has been attempting to contact Sam,” Castiel said.
“I will cure you of your human weakness.”
Castiel cleared his throat.
More awkward seconds ticked by, then Dean gave himself a full-body shake.
Castiel let his surprise show. “Yes.”
The next day, Sam decided, would be his eternal benchmark for “awkward.”
Castiel’s voice had grown a wondering tone at the end of that sentence, and Dean thought his
“Yes, Ray.”
“Please tell us you remember how to do that,” Sam said.
Ramiel came in after that, and though they attacked him and ringed him holy fire, it was all pretty pointless. In the end, Sam got the upper hand with a simple scuffle, and then, again, Crowley of all people broke the lance and saved him.
“Dean?” Sam said, smiling as well.
Castiel actually looked regretful. “I warned her not to spy on my true form. It can be overwhelming for humans. So can my voice, but you already knew that.”
“Castiel,” Sam said, trying to be as open as he could. “If you don’t want to answer this question, I know I have no right to ask it. But you, if it were completely up to you, would you—”
First thing, Sam hit the lore.
“To talk?” Jack asked.
“OK,” Dean said, just barely managing not to bow at the alpha waves his soulmate was currently blasting out.
“My wings.”
“Dean and Cass?” Jack tilted his head again, considering. “When I found you, I mean, a few hours after I was born, Dean was so angry. I only knew him that way, as an angry, and now I know grieving man. He was eventually kind to me, and accepting. I was grateful for his acceptance. But after Castiel returned, Dean was…” He frowned.
I have already had my greatest moment of connection, my closest moment to mating, when I gripped Dean Winchester tight and raised him from Perdition. I am flawed enough to wish for more. I am old enough to know it will never happen.
“He should sleep a while longer,” Castiel told her.
“Mom?” the little boy on the sofa said.
The angel looked away now, staring at the wall. “They said if I failed to give them what they ‘needed,’ they would throw you in some brothel in South America until you were . . . taken adequately. You still have my sigils on your bones. I could never have found you in time. There was nothing—”
Castiel didn’t pretend he didn’t know what that meant.
Aral and Zerachiel always come to my mind when I think these sorts of thoughts. They had been together practically from the beginning, and yet they were so different, such strong personalities. In battle, they fought as one. I thought sometimes they could have taken on a horde of Leviathan and won.
“Oh, yeah.” He nodded over to Castiel, who was now engaged in solemn conversation with Jack. “He’s an absolute fanatic over the books. Read them all a dozen times. Doesn’t talk about anything else for days. I tried to get him to read the Potter books, right? Wouldn’t touch them.”
Dean shrugged, smiling and relishing the words on his tongue. “He’s my alpha.”
“Angel fellowship is expressed through music. It’s, well, intimate. Considering the disparity of our feelings for each other, it wouldn’t have been appropriate.”
“Since when do you talk about astral planes?” Sam wanted to know.
“So, uh, we’ve been dealing with the feather part of the equation. How about the angel part?”
Cass’ body was human, but a little something extra, a little brighter and leaner and smoother like that naked David statue, or just—damn it. He didn’t know. There was just very little chance that a male body could look like that without an angel inside it,
The men left. Two women replaced them, one dressed as a warrior, the other a medieval scribe.
“And?”
Then there was Jack, asking not just questions about Castiel’s well-being, but also about what made for a romantic dinner, and how people typically met up, and whether online dates really were all serial killers, and was he old enough to start dating?
“No, I’m an angel.”
magazine in his hands. He could imagine what the Winchesters would have to say about his thoughts about his harp. Sam would probably approve of his appreciation of the arts. Dean was more likely to ask him to play “Ramble On” and then forget about the whole thing.
Dean really hated Sam right then.
“Oh, yes. On my phone.”
Castiel made a show of calming himself, then frowned in concentration. “I asked if you wanted to watch television.”
Melek and Vangelis, vibrations of sub-sonic tunes conjoining and entreating, lost from sight as well as sound and yet everywhere, twirling and dancing in a harmony even the cosmos had not achieved at its first joyous burst of creation. The sensation reached all around them, thrumming through Castiel himself and bringing his own vibrations into synch. The generous lovers shared their intimacy without breaking it, safe inside their own seamlessly matched knowledge.
“Both.”
Then Cass just shuttered up, blue eyes losing their light. “You’re not an angel.”
But then, I confess, I am somewhat stymied when others accuse me of fixating sexually on Dean. I always deny it, of course, and usually I believe I am successful in doing so.
“These things are all much more complicated than your current understanding of human interaction appreciates.”
It took five days before Sam cracked.
Dean smiled. “Sure!”
“They’re not really here, Dean.” Cass’ slightly feverish eyes scowled at him.
“And Bobby?” The hunter looked around, already calming, already softening his body to lie back and conform to the planes and angles of his alpha’s lean form. Those blue eyes were brilliant in the morning light, and his lips seemed just slightly chapped, begging for someone to moisten them.
Cass just scowled and pressed his hand harder to Dean until whatever was wrong with his friend had been healed to his satisfaction. Dean stood easily after that, frowning.
“God, Cass.”
Dean came out after that, hands wet and belt open, grinning at them all. Sam handed him a bottle of water, which Dean stared at like it held the wonders of creation. Then he and Rowena left.
So then I made the mistake, or the correction, of trying to make a connection beyond the strictly physical and told her about her father. I had hoped it would make her feel better.
Instead, I was not really looking at Dean, and Dean knew it. Dean, meanwhile, was looking at me, and I didn’t like it. It’s been years since Dean has done more than glance at me, and in his indifference I found safety. This sudden need of his to scrutinize was only making it clear he didn’t like what he saw.
Sam made and ate breakfast before he went looking for his brother, who, it turned out, had grabbed Jack and gone on a supply run. He ended up in front of his laptop, searching for the weird and hopefully-won’t-kill-us. Castiel returned to his recent, self-appointed task of plainly labeling the Men of Letter’s many artifacts that were currently in Enochian-etched boxes or other obscure packaging.
“Dean?”
As a male omega, Dean was quite used to the sensation of conflicting desires. Sixteen years old, he’d been so turned on looking at porn (Sopping wet omegas! Elephant-sized alpha cocks! Alpha women with fully emerged phalluses and bouncing breasts! Tiny omega twinks who were somehow legal!), he’d been desperate to fuck and be fucked, gagging to plunge into heat and just to be some alpha’s hole.
“Seriously, it was a sea of trench coats.”
“Dean had—” Sam tried to say.
“I don’t want to, and neither does Cass!”
Warm arms pressed him close, and that whiskey voice grumbled into his ear yet again: “Thank you for letting yourself be found.”
“Well, you.” And then Dean just stood there, and all I knew was that he wanted me to leave.
“Dean never actually said no,” Sam said, after which three frowning faces turned to him. Sam shrugged. “You said it for him, Cass.”
He stared at me with defiance. He was only a couple inches taller than Jimmy’s body, but I wanted to climb him like a mountain to enlightenment.
“So angels all have different instruments?” Sam asked.
Dean shouted out some nonsense or other like a vow before a church, meaning every word he didn’t remember two seconds later, but just ecstatic as all fuck.
“Are we going to be stowaways?” Jack asked eagerly.
“Your son will die in three days unless you bring him to me.”
“I’m supposed to offer up my body when I’m not even sure you would be capable of wanting it? I don’t know if you even like sex anymore now you’re not human, let alone sex with a guy! Let alone sex with me! I don’t even know now, if you’re in love with me, if sex is a part of it! So, what am I supposed to do? Get you drunk and roll the dice? Take you to the movies and try to neck? Get on my knees? Rip off your clothes? Rip off my clothes?”
“We need to talk, Dean. Alone.”
The words boomed through the car like a pronouncement from above: “I can’t reach!”
“But why would the angels object to your doing what God said?” Sam insisted.
Would Dean even like a regular present? He remembered giving Claire that frowning cat doll from the Hot Topical, but he had no idea whether the present had been at all “successful.”
The man drank the bottle in one go, looked amazed, and handed the plastic container back to Castiel.
But soon, the
But then I saw the back of Dean’s t-shirt, and that’s when I almost lost it.
“Jack, I told you—”
“I went to you,” he said. “And we engaged in a number of sexual activities of an increasingly intimate nature until the coven agreed that our arrangement was finished. Then I and Sam were given permission to leave with you. We took you to the car, then returned and killed them all.”
“I think we need a little more practice.”
“Belchite, Spain,” Castiel said.
OK, it was definitely nothing like kissing a woman. There was the stubble and the wide jaw, just for starters. But Castiel tasted oddly sweet too, and there was something incredibly gentle there, being kissed back as faintly as a breeze by a being more powerful than a hurricane. It was actually kind of nice.
Castiel had thrown his harp to the floor and watched it become its proper size before he realized he was going to do anything at all.
There was a bit of a squabble after that, which Mary settled with a mission briefing that oddly involved a demon who liked night fishing.
And then, desperately, Castiel felt the need to make something beautiful. It didn’t matter if it were a flower or a rainbow or graffiti on a freeway overpass.
“Do you remember when we killed Dick Roman?” he asked, then took his fingers away.
Castiel took another breath. “All angels . . . do you remember I told you that in Heaven I am a multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent?”
seconds, where he could have sworn he felt strong, hot hands on his hips, angling him just so as he shoved that poor blue dildo back inside himself a few more times before coming spectacularly all over himself.
Ah, but I have almost forgotten what almost cost me everything that morning.
“Nobody cares,” Dean told his brother. Then he looked across the table. “Cass, here’s the thing you need to know about waitresses, OK? They get hit on all day long, so you gotta bring your A game. But upside? They always smell like food.”
Sam agreed and hung up.
“Cass, if your need for some company is showing up as molting feathers, it makes sense that what would help molting birds would help you.”
“Ten minutes.”
“Well, OK, then.” He looked around the library. “Mind if we take this to my room?”
“Looking good, right?” Dean said, taking a seat at the white faux-marble table while admiring the arched pass-throughs and enjoying the breeze from the green ceiling fans. The air was redolent with seafood and spices, and he took a deep breath before taking a good swig from the sweating beer Sam had made sure was ready.
When I saw Dean Winchester’s soul in Hell, so bright, so human, so strong, I felt my first-ever sensation of what I think other angels have felt upon recognizing each other.
“You need to save that stuff, man.”
Cass was definitely pouting now, even as he did another shiver of his wings that ended in a neater arrangement of his feathers, lying flat and looking, well, actually quite pretty now.
Castiel frowned at him. “What?”
“We’re going to fix you. Sam and Rowena will be back any minute, but until then, I’m going to be here, and I will do whatever I can to make you hang on.”
Cass shook his head and put a hand on Jack’s shoulder. “Sexual orientation is not a question of bigotry, Jack. Dean’s heterosexuality is central to his personal identity and not some personality flaw.”
“Charlie would have loved it here,” he said finally.
“We’re all a part of that,” Jack said with heart-melting conviction. “We’re family.”
THE END
So, Dean and Castiel.
“Sam was there?”
A little cloud seeding, Dean?
Castiel didn’t return until the morning after a long night of maybe forty minutes’ sleep for Dean. In short, the sun in the east didn’t make either of them happy.
The angel winked at him, repeated the words dutifully, and then pulled the length of him past his full lips, down through his hot mouth, and deeper into his tight, rippling throat.
“I’m not talking about you being controlled,” he said. He’s starting to look angry.
Ray was angry, glaring back at his lieutenant’s office.
“I get that you’re an angel of the lord, but we’ve still known each other, what, ten years now?” he asked.
“Who said anything about copulation, Mr. First Date? There are a lot of steps between here and there.”
And Dean fucks me.
“Dean, I think you need a glass of water.”
“I think I would like anything that made Dean or Castiel happy.” Jack considered his own words for a moment. “It’s dangerous to say I would like ‘anything,’ but Dean and Cass wouldn’t be happy with anything bad, so I think I can say ‘anything’ and be safe. So I think I would like anything that made them happy.”
“I could tell you just to lie there and look beautiful,” Castiel said. “I could tell you to roll over on your stomach and let me inside you. I could tell you to roll over on your back and let me kiss you for weeks. I could tell you to open your mouth so I could feed you my cock.” Cass rolled his hips. “I could tell you to feel how much I want you and how much I want to do that.”
The others looked at him.
“No, it’s not about that.”
Dean and I are alone. The spell makes him not only delirious and desperate, but in a state that I know means he won’t remember anything. (Again, I wouldn’t take advantage in the real world, but this is my fantasy, damn it.)
“Nice Dean,” she said, smiling readily enough.
“Jack, we don’t want to be that intrusive,” Sam said.
“The hell!” Dean said.
“How can I help you, Dean?” I asked.
Dean looked both puzzled at the sentence and uncomfortable at the praise, much to Sam’s not-surprise. “I’m still not getting why this is all about me.” He shot Cass a wary look. “You’re not saying you’re willing to—I mean, I guess you are saying.”
“I have no idea.”
Ah, now there’s a concept angels aren’t used to. Like all other angels, I saw humans in their clothing, naked, skeletal, cellular, spiritual forms whenever I looked at them. Before Dean, the most visible layer truly didn’t matter.
“Dean,” Castiel said next. “The fight we have ahead of us, the tasks we face, they are more important than we are.” Then a warm, soft, strong, gentle hand was resting against Dean’s chest, almost singeing him, and Dean thought of the handprint burned onto his shoulder. “But we have a short time to ourselves, a few days, perhaps a few weeks, no more, and I have been waiting for you for so very long.”
Dean nodded. “We were raped, Cass. You realize that?”
“What?” Cass sat back.
Castiel nodded. “I knew you and she would be successful.”
“As in the end of the world?” Sean asked.
“Cass, seriously, I need you to come clean here.” Dean actually turned away and paced to the nearby wall, then spun back around. “It’s driving me crazy.”
While he had spent his life, as Cass had said, pacifying himself with a faceless line of beta women, it was strong thighs and broad shoulders he pictured when he got himself off, stripping his cock and shoving a couple fingers up his semi-slick ass. Castiel had a perfect body: tight, fit, pert, and so damn smooth. He didn’t have a single scar or blemish or mole or anything, just miles of lightly tanned skin.
“Don’t blame yourself,” Dean said automatically. Castiel had thrown his lot in with him and Sam. “I know you did everything you could.” He finally managed to look up at the angel, who was still staring at the floor. “Cass.” He waited until blue eyes flicked up to his. “I know you did what you could.”
He scowled as though Castiel were being difficult on purpose, which, of course, he was, but Dean couldn’t know that.
“Fill in the details?”
“And just how is me doing the mattress mambo with our best friend supposed to make me happy? Cass is our brother, Sam, not some skirt in a bar.”
“Who are you?” he demanded.
Dean glared. “You betrayed Heaven to help us.”
“Sit down,” Dean said, pointing to the other end of the brown sofa. Cass looked liked he’d rather wallow in a nest of vipers, but obeyed.
“But just what is ‘here,’ Dean?”
What humans would call “string instruments” were the answer. Angels played the celestial equivalent of violins, cellos, violas, guitars, kotos, shamisen (strangely popular), zithers, dulcimers, and, as in Castiel’s case, harps. In short order (a few hundred years of practice), the chorus of vibrations matched the vibrations of the universe (what humans would eventually refer to in terms of “string theory”) to be in perfect harmony with the spheres.
OK, so I'm a little short of the  word count I promised, but the story wanted to end here.
Not all humans are skilled at judging one’s character. Certainly, not all are as skilled as they think they are. But still, they are often willing to take that incredible leap of faith. They are ready to say, “I have no real reason to trust you, but I will.”
“Seriously, dude,” Dean said, turning to his brother while keeping one eye on Cass, who was shifting on his feet again. “Are you all right?”
“No, he did. And I didn’t blame him.”
Dean realized what that meant. “And what visage are you in now? Holy tax accountant?”
With a nod, he walked to his room, took off his coat and shoes, and lay on the bed with the TV remote. Something played on the screen, but he found himself mostly watching his fingers as they plucked the empty air.
“Oh,” he whispered. “Oh, yes.”
Dean and Donna.
Ah, now Sam understood his initial reaction: Castiel was their brother. Sam loved Cass deeply himself as a brother-in-arms.
“All right, Ray.”
Sam frowned. That metaphor should have worked, but it didn’t.
Sometimes, when he was a little drunk from a liquor store or two, Cass thought about how he would be content with just a prolonged hug. But then that usually led into a fantasy of wrapping his grace (what was left of it) around Dean’s soul and blurring the lines, so there was that.
With a frown, he crossed that out.
Jack nodded, smiling a little. “Yes. It wasn’t just the cowboys and Dodge City. He was happy. I had never seen that before in him.” Jack thought for a moment. “That was why he hated me in the beginning. He blamed me for getting Castiel killed.”
Is it still a breach of their privacy to take everything they’ve said publically and put it together? Ask the NSA.
Castiel then reached into his coat pocket and pulled out Ruby’s knife. With a few long strides, he was at the nearest stone wall, cutting his arm and gathering up the blood to smear a circle with a series of squiggles and runes around it. When it was complete, the angel stepped back with cautious relief, looking around and obviously listening hard.
Too vengeful.
Dean didn’t quite fold his arms and tap his foot, but it was obviously a temptation. “OK, and?”
With the first sense of purpose in five days, I walked up to the register to pay for my coffee. A young woman in glasses with a hesitant smile rang me up.
Sexual stimulation is shrouded in mystery for humans, but actually it’s a matter of basic math. The more nerve endings in a millimeter, the more sensitive the area. Throw in trust and an erotic mindset, and one has an erogenous zone.
“Videos?”
In the end, they handcuffed Sam to the plumbing and shoved a wardrobe in front of the door. Castiel managed to get control over his itchy back long enough to sit still in the car and walk like a semi-normal person into the St. James Medical Center. He was even able to tell that Dr. Corman’s soul was still in his corpse. He nodded and blinked out, though, when Dean went back to the Impala. Hopefully, he’d found an angel luffa or some lotion, or something.
Dean nodded and leaned in for a kiss, but I asked, “Do you remember when you were trying to live the life Sam wanted you to live with Lisa?”
“And what’s with the wings?” Dean demanded.
“Let me explain what I know,” the angel began.
“Cass,” Dean demanded. “How bad is it?”
Dean was, in short, the reason for pretty much everything in Sam’s life. Dean was the reason he was Sam Fucking Winchester.
“Lucifer has sent his demons to care for Famine, to feed him, make certain he'll be ready.”
Then he got a call from Sam.
Looking at it now, all those moments of making, of learning, of playing, of belonging to a chorus hit him in the gut so hard he doubled over and then fell to his knees.
“So I went to them.”
,” Bobby growls after picking up on the first ring.
Dean picked out some more feathers, trying to make a sort of grid pattern with his fingertips so he didn’t miss any. Even so, he managed to type another search into his phone.
“Like riding a bike,” he murmured, running a fond hand down the soundbox.
“So, you're saying you're just well-adjusted?”
Of course, by “everything,” I don’t mean what it has meant in the past. My near-failure wasn’t about the end of the world, my smiting of Heaven, or my loss of my army or my mind. It was just about my own interests, and as such counts for very little in the world to anyone except me.
“What else happened when I was out of it?”
“I raised him from Perdition,” Castiel said, “because God commanded it.” He looked over at Dean, almost amused.
“What are we all talking about right now that I don’t get?”
“Your room?” Jack asked.
“I see half of them are sporting anti-possession tattoos.”
A better bet would also be my go-to fantasy: me bent over a sofa, Dean thrusting into my body. The male penis has 4,000 or more nerve endings. He could blot me out of his own understanding, perhaps with some witch’s spell, and my body—my body, not Jimmy’s—would be soft and slick and hot for him.
Dean smiled, letting me know that, angel or not, it was all right for me to be the follower here. Later—the thought of later filled me with pure delight—I would know more, in a practical, applicable sense, and I could take more of the lead.
in the storage room, Sam opened up his laptop, went to a fan site, and scanned the fanfic archive.
“So this is your first time molting?”
Of course, it was and will ever be one-sided. Dean has done me the highest honor in thinking of me as a brother. It is only my own fault that it’s not the honor I would prefer.
“Thank you,” he said. “Knowing you, it’s been the best part of my life. And the things that we’ve shared together, they have changed me. You’re my family.” He looked at Dean, but then made sure to glance over at Sam and Mary too. “I love you. I love all of you. Just please, don’t make my last moments be spent watching you die.”
Then he pulled back a self-conscious distance, looked at those full, somewhat dry lips and leaned back in.
“I know it freaked me out, OK? I know I just—haven’t you ever been overwhelmed? I was overwhelmed, OK? I had to think about it.” With a scowl, he pushed the door shut behind him and marched up to me. I stood automatically to face him. Besides, I didn’t want my face anywhere near his belt at the moment.
“So you just choose to stay in that?”
“Jody Mills,” Castiel said, and though it was quiet enough, everyone just froze and looked at him.
It was clear from the hand movements Dean had made when he mentioned a harp to Mary that he thought angels should have those little Greek harps like a Hummel figure. In truth, his harp, if ever made corporeal, would be a concert-grand pedal harp with a few extra strings.
He took in a deep breath, smelling that fading mix of ozone and aftershave that was as much a part of Castiel to him as his loyalty and angel blade.
"You don't have a mate, not after T'Pring and Stonn. Is that disrupting anything? Do you need to be—Spock, help me."
“They’re furries,” Castiel said. Dean looked at him. “Adults who derive social and/or sexual gratification from dressing up as furry animals and congregating.”
“Understood.”
“C’mon, Cass. This is no time to be shy. What do you need?”
Being unable to meet Dean’s eyes made me feel weak. I have taken on the hounds and demons of hell. I have slaughtered the enemy on the battlefield. I damn well wasn’t going to be weak because Dean Winchester decided he wanted to look me in the eye.
McKay looked astonished, then horrified. “Is this some sort of joke?” the scientist asked finally.
“But it was all right, Sam.” Jack smiled at him with that odd little-kid, old-man smile. “In the end, I knew I had three fathers who love me. Castiel loves me completely, without question. He started to love me when he felt my fetus in Kelly’s stomach. You love me, and you see yourself in me. And Dean loves me because I brought Cass back and because I want to be good in spite of my father and all that has happened to me.”
“I don't know how it is with Mounties up in Canada, but down here a gay cop is tolerated, even trotted out on Political Correctness Day for a round of applause, but his life . . . it ain't easy, Fraser.”
But with Dean.
“Yes, and it’s very dark, very powerful, but disorganized.” Jack shook his head, frowning. “It feels lost.”
Dean, Sam noticed, was pressing his fists into his eyes.
“Very dead!” Jack added, almost giggling.
“Yeah, like my liver, cholesterol, stuff like that.”
Cass wasn’t looking at him anymore, staring at the window as though it had personally offended him. “Yes.” He briefly looked into Dean’s eyes, then away. “They would have taken anyone, but it had to be a man.” Cass looked at the floor. “We asked if it could be an aggressive female, someone like Pamela, or someone.” His voice, small at that point, trailed off.
But, whatever. So Dean comes into the bunker and strips off his clothes. I watch sweat go down his body.
“So,” Sam said, eyes full of hesitant happiness. “You’re Dean’s alpha?”
“Why not?” Sam wanted to know.
heart might just break open.
“Because God commanded it. Because we have work for you. Because you belong to me.”
“I don’t believe that will be necessary, Dean,” Cass said, applying the perfect amount of pressure to his dick. “I am bringing you to fulfilment. As I understand it, that should suffice.” He twisted his fingers, rippling the pressure, and Dean shouted in joy. It was like getting a hand job from a professional: perfect if indifferent. But it felt so good.
“Showroom ready,” Dean added, nodding. “I thought we had the wrong place until they flashed their fangs.”
“There’s bacon!” Jack said.
Dean had to admit to being impressed. No girl had ever—wait, what the hell was he thinking?
“No, Dean.” Cass put his blade away and sat on the opposite end of the couch, the duffel bag between them. “No, it didn’t touch you.”
“You can be straight with me.”
Dean wanted to object, but the others went after the car like they were performing CPR, and then while Sam was wiping Baby down with a sham, Cass left and came back with duffle and grocery bags.
Cass smiled, looking almost sly. “That you did.”
“And now?”
Dean could clearly tell Sam knew what Cass was referring to, but his gigantor little brother just stood up, looming slightly, and then went back to his chair, looking shaken.
So, here he was, sitting with his brand-new, pristine composition book, and Sam was going to figure this out.
“They’re all dead. Sam and I killed them. I believe the spell was to enslave the forces of nature in some manner. They were working to increase the power of their coven. I never learned their ultimate goal.”
“Yeah, I got that.”
And then Dean let himself look down further: straight, thick, long, pink, and lovely, with tender-looking balls and a soft dusting of hair.
Cass finished his examination in silence, then returned Sam’s phone, evidently unphased.
Castel had been so right, so dead-on accurate with every word. His “father’s scorn” and the way John had preened over Sam’s alpha status. The dark, savage disappointment when Dean was the faithful son and Sam left, like a man presented with second-best, a consolation prize of fatherhood.
“Something tells me you’re going to tell us things aren’t so great for you upstairs anymore,” Bobby said.
“Cass, look, we’re not going to be, you know, eating each other for lunch, right? Angels don’t want to—”
I pulled back to question him, but he just followed, swallowing up my words with his mouth, which was getting deliciously insistent. Was he . . . what was Dean doing now? His hands—strong, sturdy hands that had kept him, me, and his brother alive on so many hunts—were lightly tracing my skin, which meant he’d gotten those hands under my shirt. His touch felt incredible, like I was being cherished. But then, I knew Dean was a considerate lover. He was expert, in fact, which accounted for the way I was starting to shiver.
“Dean,” Castiel said, sounding breathless. “Sam and Jack are nearby.”
I could only nod.
“What do you think of Dean and Cass getting together romantically?” Sam blurted out.
“Which is completely out of the question,” Cass continued.
“Dean.” Cass turned to faced him, his face intent but still oddly blank. “The trial to get you out was most unpleasant for you. You were under a spell. We got you out of there only through great suffering on your part. There’s no need for you to recall the horrors of—”
“Dean?” the girl screamed now. “Any chance of a kiss?”
“My pleasure.”
If their lives so far hadn’t gotten Dean and Cass together, what the hell exactly was supposed to do the trick?
Was Castiel’s male vessel a deal-breaker?
Cass looked, of all things, hurt, but then he cleaned his face. “I am doing my best to honor Jimmy Novak’s life, Dean, which includes looking after his daughter. But if you are asking if I ‘feel’ particularly male or female, the answer is no.”
“What? I’m just supposed to go along with copulation to see how you like it?”
“Dean and Cass will think about each other the way that Dean and Cass choose to think about each other!” Dean bellowed.
When they’d started, the feathers had looked gray, but now their iridescence was much more apparent, and he could see black feathers like oil in the sun, covered in quiet prisms. He took a moment to spray a bit more water over the feathers, and they actually began to shine.
Castiel didn’t answer.
And he waited some more.
“Dean, go home. I’ll be back when I can.”
“Yeah,” Sam said. “And we’d better start with the Impala.”
“Son of a bitch!” Dean said, shooting to a sitting position that half-dragged Castiel with him. “Sam!”
“Yes, but one form of love can be nothing like another form of love. Humans love ice cream. They love a song. They love their children. They love to hate fictional characters. Dean’s affection for me is familial, not romantic.”
The angel shrugged. “I could have told you then if I wanted you to know.”
Sam wilted somewhat, but the angel’s voice wasn’t unkind. In fact, Cass took Sam’s hand in both of his. “You and I need to talk later.”
Let me explain again. I may not have phrased that correctly.
The suppressants had kept the heats down after that first time, but when he was nineteen, terrified because no alpha had looked at him twice, wondering if he were even a proper omega anymore, Dean skipped two weeks of pills on purpose.
Sam frowned at him. Dean went to get another beer.
Sam Winchester had always looked up to his older brother. He couldn’t imagine not doing it.
Dean snorted. “Classic horny demon sign.”
“Here, Dean,” Castiel said gently, helping him open the water and do up his belt.
“How did the hunt go?”
Dean looked at me. “Are you OK, or what?”
. So much for keeping his little problem hidden.
I had stood idly by before, you understand. My last time on Earth, a woman and her Nephilim daughter had been declared enemies of Heaven, and I did my duty as a soldier.
He had more than he usually did when he hit the books. He knew there was precedent for angels and humans having physical relations, and not just because of Dean and Anna. While Lily Sunder hadn’t actually had a child with Benjamin, and Lucifer’s tryst with Kelly didn’t really matter for its own reasons, Sam knew Castiel had once killed a Nephilim, so her parents had Done It. Also, enough angels and humans had gotten together that there was a word for their kids in the first place (even if they were supposed to be an abomination).
“I want it,” he said.
Dean felt a pang of guilt, looking at her. Not a week after Jo had first presented she’d come to see Dean, talking about how maybe they should go have dinner. Dean, who typically passed himself off as a beta, had to break the news he was actually an unclaimed, probably incompatible omega. She’d actually cried a little.
Castiel looked down at the menu and read the first thing he saw: “Sunrise Special, please.”
Dean needed a romantic partner as close to him as Sam was as a brother.
There were plastic water bottles on the table and notepads with pens. Dean grabbed a bottle to take a a drink, then sat away from Ruby next to Castiel.
I lay back on the white expanse, toeing off my shoes. My feet—Jimmy’s feet but now really my feet alone—were black against the white cotton. My head felt good on the firmer of the two pillows.
“Not in my experience.”
Now I know what I did not then, that dead angels go to the Empty. Do they somehow manage to sleep as one even there? I would believe it. The things I have seen.
Occasionally, some other angel began a new piece, and he followed along gratefully. Sometimes he just played random notes like the wind through an Aeolian harp. Sometimes, when no other angel was playing with him, he picked his way through a bit of Led Zeppelin or Bob Seger. Then he tried a bit of Mozart and a Celtic tune not heard on Earth for over a thousand years.
“Well, an army marches on its stomach,” Sam said, but the inflection was flat.
"Beg you?"
“Close enough for what?”
They turned then, passing through a few hunters who shot them uncertain looks, and made their way into the garage.
“Take an hour, you guys.” Sam laughed, patting Jack on the shoulder. “Take the rest of the day!”
“No, Lebanon. Kansas.”
“Sammy, honestly, what the hell are you doing?”
And so despite walking into a room and seeing the entity I desperately longed for as my true mate display his wings, I controlled myself.
“Well, you know,” Dean said, handing him an opened bottle. “Usually, they’re dives, a combination of frat house and slaughter house. But this one was kinda, I dunno.”
“You gave up,” the angel said. “Long ago, you looked in the mirror and told yourself no one was coming for you. You looked at your body, at this incredible masterpiece of God, and told yourself you were incompatible, and all the while I was watching and waiting.”
Dean seemed to consider this a moment, but it became another blank stare.
I stepped back deliberately, and he let me go. My eyes were closed. I needed to get my breathing under control before I looked at him again. I could hear him in front of me, as well as feel the heat of him.
I sat up, put my feet on the floor, and then didn’t stand up.
“Hold her,” Cass said, shoving Ruby into Dean’s arms. “Do not let her go.”
“Me and Cass and happiness?”
“I said they were going to save you and that I would make sure you hung on until then.” Then Castiel played his trump card. “I said we were family.”
So, yes. I have imagined intimacy since then as a physical act with Dean Winchester.
Cass looked up sharply again. A high-pitched whine began, and the walls started shaking.
“Has it ever occurred to you that’s the problem?”
Nonplussed, I looked. Same lovely green eyes, oddly pretty for a man who was in no way—ah, human speech was complicating my thoughts again. If I could sing it, it would be precisely what I meant. There was nothing effeminate about Dean, but “effeminate” in the male context is fraught with negativity it does not need, as though delicate aspects are—oh dear, even the word “delicate” isn’t working. Dean is not delicate.
“Then what?”
No, damn it.
Cass tagged along, sitting in the booth the whole time Dean shoved waffles and whipped cream into his mouth, one of his hands wrapped tightly around the small harp in his pocket.
“What?” Mary asked.
“There was something else,” he admitted through a choked throat. “But I only shared it with you because I knew you wouldn’t remember it.” He looked up to see Dean glaring at him. “I don’t suppose you could just let it go?”
A familiar whiskey-and-gravel voice answered from behind them: “It's a human soul.” Castiel was standing there in his usual trench but not looking usual at all. A thin outline of the lightest gray ran over the wall behind him, a tracing of massive, hawk-like wings. “It's starting to make sense.”
But then the hunter inhaled, and the sweet-salt smell of warm skin went straight to his brain stem.
Dean blinked, and he was back in Donna’s cabin. Castiel was recoiling, regret in his eyes.
“On a ship in the middle of the ocean?” Dean asked.
Cass thought about that for a bit. “And so you’re saying you like being able to help me.”
“To the human mind, it would—”
Her hands went to her hips. “Why would I do that, exactly?”
Castiel’s eyebrows did that angry thing. “Dean.”
“I see.” I didn’t, of course, but I have found that to be the best thing to say when I have nothing to say.
And then Castiel was there, muddy and bloody, but whole and solid and real.
“Sounds about right for those guys,” Dean said, making it a profane insult.
Dean took away a few more feathers.
“Cass,” he said back with a gasp, and I wondered how long he might have wanted to say my name that way.
Castiel nodded. “And I will wait at the back with you in case he comes in that way.”
“We’ve met,” the angel said with narrowed eyes.
Cass frowned again. “Angels don’t get married.”
“Are you in love with me, or what?!”
“Of course, Dean.”
I said the words at a moderate volume, but he evidently heard me anyway.
Not for his brother.
“You’re the gal from Sam’s hotel room,” Dean said.
Sam paused.
He thought next about the time Castiel had come to them, cursed by Rowena and still covered with the evidence of his torture at the hands of other angels. He thought about Cass coming out of the motel bathroom all cleaned up from Purgatory. He thought about getting drunk with them over Jack’s death.
Cass considered this a moment, looking down at the food in front of him with a mild distaste. “My grace responds to distress in many forms. I have sometimes healed you quickly. I may have done more than was visible at the time.”
And that’s when it first occurred to him that something should have occurred to him a while ago.
“Cass.”
“Dean and Cass are my parents,” he said at last. “Many people’s parents are married.” He shrugged. “That would make me just more like other people, and I do like that.”
. They are new leaves and fresh, hopeful shoots of grass.
“Good morning, Dean.”
Castiel shook his head. “Archangels don’t manifest instruments.”
The alpha moved just a bit more forward, and Dean could feel the heat from him now, a warmth that reached through his skin down to his muscles and then bones.
“Oh, yeah?”
“Wouldn’t have minded having you with us, though. Where’d you go?”
A few minutes later, I was listening to “The Voice of Colorado” on KOA 850 a.m., which warned of a snow front, and watching the road as Jerry drove north to Boulder.
“Dean.” Yes, that was a good beginning. “We’ve known each other for some time now.” Oh, that wasn’t very good. I shook it off and tried again. “I believe we’ve spent enough time in each other’s company that we can come to an understanding.”
The others? The ones they were saving for last tonight? They were her favorite of all time.
“They said you did not reach the level of emotional energy their enchantment requires.”
Dean had to admit, the food was awesome.
So, I do not believe Dean’s sexual pleasure would be particularly highlighted, especially with a new partner, with spanking or other pain-inflicting or controlling sexual advances.
“That doesn’t change the facts. I mean, my grandfather brought you back over and over, right?”
“Yeah.” Dean shrugged. Somehow this was almost as bed as watching Cass go down on him, and he couldn’t even start to think about that. “I mean, you know. You and me. We go back a long ways now.”
Naomi looked annoyed, then seemed to school herself. She held out her left hand, and then was holding a cello by the neck. A bow appeared in her right hand. She nodded at the others to do the same. Jamal produced a lute, and Loren held her hurdy-gurdy.
It was just as grand and beautiful as he had thought it would be on the Earth’s plane. Even in the somewhat underwhelming yellow light of the room, it shone, and again he heard a nearly inaudible thrumming from its strings.
“Dean,” Sam said, and Dean knew that tone. “You’re just back on your feet. Eat something, shower, shave, see if you head clears. Then we’ll talk.”
“We waited ten minutes,” Cass said, taking over while he scrubbed at the read window. “And we were about to go in after you, when we got the first video.”
“What?”
Sam sat back in his chair and crossed his arms
She frowned and looked at Dean.
And everything for a time was just soft and lovely and warm.
Waking up, Dean pondered Cass’ last words. At first, they had just seemed sentimental, a cute way of saying something nonsensical.
Sometimes, Dean wouldn’t exactly pray, but his thoughts and feelings were so powerful that they reached Castiel anyway.
Not worrying about anything anymore, he leaned back, bringing a warm, naked, willing Cass with him, until the angel was lying over him like a weighted electric blanket. Dean wrapped his arms around the strong torso and opened his legs enough to let the slightly smaller body of his dance partner shimmy down between.
“I am looking at you, Dean,” I said, although I was quite aware that I wasn’t “looking” at him. With his hunter’s instinct, he had figured out my hiding strategy.
Dean tried to smile again. “Cool.”
“Oh, God,” Dean said, holding his left leg up to spread himself a bit wider.
“Nice,” she said, and bounced away.
Staring at my coffee, I searched for something to be angry about, but I found nothing. I could not be angry with Dean for knowing what he wanted and what he didn’t. I could not be angry with myself for my feelings or my instinctual decision to share everything with the man I loved.
Cass nodded. “That’s nine miles north.”
Indeed, I could have, had I wanted to, dominated Dean with my knowledge. I could have applied all manner of techniques that I knew, but I didn’t want to. I didn’t want to approach this as an experiment or a contest. I wanted Dean to—
The hunter shrugged again, then looked around. “All right, so, we need a game plan. I say we walk the ship, see if you can pick up anything.”
The line took a good thirty minutes, but then he and Cass had little bibs with their contestant numbers on them to attach to their backs. It was another two hours before their time on stage, so Dean got a couple burgers from a burger stand and ate them both while Castiel watched the crowd with ever-widening eyes.
Oh crap, head rush.
That is, until the waitress smiled at him and asked, “And how ‘bout you, handsome?”
Sheriff Mills head went back as her chin dipped down. “How do you know that?”
So when I say “everything,” I only mean everything that mattered to me, which is very small indeed when weighed on the scale of the universe.
He opened his eyes, and then Castiel was
“Confused is what you are, Dean,” Cass said. “It’s very late. You need to sleep.”
Sam had explained what he could about Dean’s condition, including Rowena’s description of the Black Grimoire. Castiel knew there was nothing he could do to reverse the magic but was hopeful his presence might be able to help in some way. He was a damn seraph, after all.
“I can pay you for gas,” I said.
Cass hesitated, then raised his chain just slightly.
Cass shook his head. “Not always.”
I just kept looking at him.
“We’ve got a case,” Sam called out to the others, who, he noted, almost ran to the library table.
Instead, he was in a room, kind of like what you’d expect from some meditation spa that charged you $2,000 a day literally just for breathing. Polished, smooth wood made up the walls, floor, and steepled ceiling. The air was odd, kind of soft, like the golden light.
Thinking about that distracted him from what Dean had said about needing to talk, along with his assumption that Dean just wanted to vent about Crowley. Honestly, Castiel had no idea what was going on with the King of Hell. Being a part of the purification ritual with Sam’s blood had changed the demon, but beyond that, the angel was clueless.
“Is that supposed to be me?”
“So,” Dean said. “That’s that.”
Sam got up, hunkered down in front of the sofa, and held out his hand. “Welcome to the family, and I have to add, it’s an honor to meet you.”
“Oh no, Baby,” Dean groaned, looking over the mud-and-who-knows-what-splatted Impala. Leaves and grass were stuffed into the seams, the antenna was bent back, and a headlight was busted. He rushed to her, looking her over in detail, but that proved to be the worst of it.
But then, that was better than I could manage, with my broken wings. In that second, I had perhaps never hated Metatron more.
“You had no choice, Cass. That’s my point!” Dean stood up, paced to the fireplace, pace back, rana hand through his hair, and sat back down. He took a breath, or two. “We were both violated. You think I don’t realize that?”
But they didn’t. Sam started to wonder next why he’d thought they would.
“Cool, cool,” Wally said. “What do I do?”
Cass nodded solemnly, sharing a moment of battlefield unity.
So, Dean comes into the bunker while he’s stripping out of his jacket, his layer of denim, and then his t-shirt (not the one with the wings). He’s sweating, and his heart is racing. A single bead of sweat runs down the line from his chin to his collar and then down further. I watch the gathering dew of his sweat, farther down as it drops, trickling between his pectoral muscles, which would be called breasts if he were female, and then down further, pooling around his abdominal muscles.
“I thought famine meant starvation,” Sam said, “like as in, you know, food.”
“Everyone to me!” the angel yelled, his alpha nature on blatant display. Even Ruby took a step closer to him. They all rushed forward, with Owen in Sean’s arms and Bobby grabbing a shotgun. Once the last of them, Jo, was within two feet of Castiel, Dean felt a familiar sense of flying.
“Ah!” Feeling stupid, he fished his harp out of his pocket and set it down. Dean gasped as it reached the proper size. Castiel set his feet on the pedals and positioned it before strumming a scale and watching Dean’s eyes light up.
Before the nixed Apocalypse, angels kept to their places. For all Naomi accused him of having a “crack in his chassis,” Castiel had kept to his assigned role. Whatever objections he had he kept to himself, unless it involved battle strategy, in which case he had always (yes, always) been able to explain why his plans were superior. When he’d been tapped to save the Righteous Man from Hell, he’d assumed that was why.
“Because God has given me my promised soul mate.” Noticeable pride was in Cass’ voice now, and he turned to look at Dean with quiet adoration. “No other angel has been given such a reward.” He turned back to the others. “They seem to feel I have become too different.”
“And what the hell does that mean?”
“Yes?” the woman said. She looked to be around forty and had those sort of no-nonsense eyes and calm beta smell Dean associated with good law enforcers.
“So, he’s poisoning you?” Dean asked.
“So, we’re dealing with a coven strong enough to hide their presence from an angel,” Castiel said, “though I am at low power.”
"Shouldn't we? We both care about you, Spock."
“Dean!” Castiel shook his shoulder. “Dean!”
“Look, let’s all come inside and talk,” Ellen said, a little alpha-mother seeping into her voice. She looked at Mills. “Except for you, I’m thinking.”
Damn those puppy-dog eyes. It was almost as bad as when Dean wanted something.
He turned to a fresh page in his notebook.
And yes, he particularly loved Dean, but that wasn’t important. It comforted him beyond measure to know that Dean thought of him as a brother, but it also reminded him that Dean was human and he, Castiel, Angel of Thursday, was not. Any sort of relationship beyond what they currently shared was completely out of the question, and that was . . . well, it wasn’t great, but it was fine.
“You and Dean,” Sam said, then looked at his brother. “And you and Cass.”
“They had another one last year,” Sam said as he swiped his phone to what would doubtlessly be more hellish images.
“And you rescued Dean from Hell?”
“But you’ve told me again and again how important love is.”
“Emotional energy,” he said aloud.
But Cass and Dean and their “more profound bond” wasn’t just about brothers-in-arms. No way. The two of them could get into an argument and forget there was anybody else in the room. Dean and Cass both got their feelings hurt whenever the other said the slightest thing. And frankly, if eye-fucking were the same as the physical thing, there’d be a little blue-eyed, beer-guzzling Nephilim running around being an abomination all night long.
“What’s square one at this point?” Bobby asked.
I’d gotten his outer shirt off and was working on his Henley, which would not go over his head because we were kissing so deeply. His hands had shoved off the overcoat and gotten my belt undone. I thought about using my grace to get us naked and started laughing.
“When we got to the mansion, Cass could sense great power, so we didn’t storm in. We spent two days watching them, but we didn’t learn anything but that they got their groceries delivered and one of them was really into the roses growing in the front yard.
“So.” Dean nodded his head a bit back and forth. “You feel like a man.”
, an, uh, oh, furries.”
“Because we both wanted me to.”
That self-righteous comic book villain could have been I. I could have walked that path, pitted by angels against humans. I could have been something into which I gladly plunged my angel blade.
“Goodnight, Dean,” I said, and I left.
I left Dean Winchester, the brightest soul I had ever seen, the strongest human I had even known, inside that grave.
Cass moved, rubbing them together from what felt like head to toe, and Dean just suddenly came, like he was a teenager or something. He moaned into Castiel’s mouth (or maybe it was more like a grunt), and the body on top of his moved again, prolonging the sweet relief of it all as soft lips kissed his chin and neck and shoulder.
It was six days before I saw Dean wearing the Metallica shirt again. All four of us were less than twenty-four hours back from a salt-and-burn that, for once, was just a salt-and-burn. Dean was looking for the next job on his laptop. Coming from behind him, I let myself imagine just for a second that the wings I can see over the top of his chair were a courtship display.
“Yes, the car is fine, Dean,” Sam said, turning to go back inside while Bobby shook his head and turned as well, though his grip on his shotgun didn’t loosen, and Dean reminded himself a person didn’t have to be an angel to know the love a man had to have for an awesome car.
Kirk tightened his hold, leaning down to bury his own lips in that black hair (wig).
“You told me you loved you.”
“Just, damn it, Cass.” He rubbed his forehead again. “Just explain what happened, OK?”
. You love him, and he loves you.”
“And me not remembering? That was part of the spell?”
“So you would like me to make myself scarce, is that right?”
As usual, Milton got the whole thing wrong. When angels decide to mate, the last thing they’re thinking about is a lack of physicality, let alone blushing.
And, oh God, he was leaking—
Dean waited, then asked, “Want what?”
Spock looked beautifully tortured.
So when they made it to the Bunker, Castiel drank a beer with the brothers and then made it to his room. He felt like a little reading, actually.
Sam was standing there, and in Cass’ body, in his memory, Dean walked forward to stand at Sam’s side.
