He continued to speak. “Today I have witnessed the true honour of the Westerners. I salute Prince Anthony’s courage and candour. Let me take this opportunity to inform him and every one present here that us Easterners are very broad-minded when it comes to what our Omegas can do. We, as an empire do not tolerate any kind of suppression and unequal treatment of anyone. Everyone is equal before the law of the land, even me. I have decided that this marriage alliance with Prince Anthony is…” Steve took a dramatic pause mainly out of spite as he felt joy when sheer panic flashed in Howard’s eyes “… acceptable to me.”
The next week’s royal dinner went pretty well when Tony had decided to go overboard with dressing up. He knew he turned heads the entire night. The man for whom Tony had put in so much effort was clearly bowled over as well. He knew for a fact, without Pepper’s constant cooing mind you, that the Emperor had not taken his eyes off Tony the entire night. He may have broken a glass or two as well when Minister Coulson had asked Tony for a dance.
He looked at Pepper who had entered to wake him up and probably get him ready for the journey to Brooklyn. Tony surprised himself when the first thing out of his lips as soon as he woke up was, “Where is the Emperor?”
“Guys I want to talk to Steve alone.” She said in a tone that left no room for argument. Both Thor and Clint caught onto this and wisely chose to give them some space. Clint was still seething but he knew Natasha could handle the whole thing better than anyone could. They made their exit to the nearest waiting room.
It was two days after Tony came back to the tower that an opportunity to talk to Steve alone, presented itself. It was late in the night, like 3 am late, and Tony who was finally off his wheel chair, strolled into the kitchen looking for coffee. He saw Steve sitting at the kitchen table trying to read something. He was wearing a blue button-down shirt with black jeans, not exactly ready for bed.
Steve gave him a gentle smile and put his hand on king’s shoulder. “Your people will prosper in the Rogers Empire. You will be treated with the respect you deserve. Buck…”
Next time Tony woke up, he was feeling much better. The pain in his abdomen was persistent, but had reduced to a dull ache. There was no presence on his left side anymore. As he opened his eyes further and looked around, he saw Natasha standing near the door. “Wakey Wakey eggs and bakey Stark. About damn time you woke up” she said with a small grin. Tony gave her a short, pained smile, his gaze constantly searching for the one man he wanted to see. “Looking for someone?” Natasha said with an amused look.
“This is Dummy and You,” Clint said pointing towards the parrots in the cage which were squawking loudly. They were beautiful birds with blue and red feathers. They most surely were exotic birds caught in a forest somewhere far away.
“Will this incident be enough for them to realize their feelings towards each other?” Clint asked Natasha. “One can only hope Bird Brain.” Natasha replied with a small smirk of her own as she made a move to follow Thor and Bruce to Tony’s room.
Tony spun his sword and adopted a defensive stance as he gave Rhodey time to stand again. He would never strike on an enemy who was unprepared or had his back to him. Rhodey rolled on the ground instead and when he came closer to Tony, he struck. Tony had easily deflected the blow with his sword but, Rhodey used Tony’s earlier manoeuvre on him. He used his sword to trap Tony’s on the ground and hit him on the shoulder, causing Tony to stumble.
“I do not consider it a trouble but my good fortune,” Tony said honestly. It had been an absolute honour to cook for his Alpha.
It was a hot day in Brooklyn and to the surprise of his courtiers and ministers and to Bucky’s absolute shock and horror, the Great Emperor was out to control an Elephant that had gone wild.
The last thing Tony remembered was falling into strong arms and the word sweetheart. It was said with such underlying emotion that it was etched into his mind forever. He was confused. What the hell was happening? Had he managed to throw himself in an alternate dimension? This was his last thought as he succumbed to the pain medication and fell back to sleep.
Just as he stepped outside, he immediately took a step back and hid behind the curtain so he could peep but without being noticed.
Tony was shocked. He desperately needed some semblance of a connection with his home and the life he was leaving behind but he could not let Pepper do this. He had heard how the East treated their Omegas. They would force Pepper to live in Harem, may be let other alphas take advantage of her or treat her like a mere slave. He could not let that happen.
The King took Steve ’s lack of response to refusal and bowed his head in disappointment. “I can understand the reason behind your silence…but I assure you your Majesty, Anthony is one of the most beautiful Omegas you will ever lay your eyes on. He is also extremely healthy and will bless you with an heir, I am sure of that.”
“You have no idea how much I care about you. How much I think about you. Every time you smile at someone else, I feel I lost another opportunity to make you smile.” These words were spoken barely above a whisper.
“On your guard!” a palace solider announced as Steve entered the court room. This was the informal one, saved for special matters and occasions and a personal audience with the Emperor. It was large enough to fit at least 500 men comfortably, with silver and golden engravings on the wall. The court room itself was truly magnificent.
Tony was at a loss of words after hearing the sheer hatred in Agatha’s voice. He knew that there always had been tension between him and her but this was not what he was expecting.  She sounded happy that his marriage with the Emperor had never been consummated – that there wasn’t any bond between the man she considered her son and his spouse. And she was asking Tony to make no moves to make his marriage fruitful rather she wanted him to give up all together.
He would deal with the press and Pepper’s complaints later. For now, he had an evening to look forward to.
The Rogers Fort was architectural masterpiece. It was designed in such a way that when a sound is made in a certain spot of the Fort, the walls reflected it so that the sound was heard in another, distant part of the fort. It was especially useful when the Fort was under attack and the guards on the other side of the Fort needed to be intimated or the spies had to keep a track of the enemy’s plan. But, right now, the design made it so that Steve could hear his Omega sing softly in his palace.
He tried again but after two calculated yet difficult steps he ran into something hard. The shorter man looked up and was met with a steely blue gaze. Oh my God. Not now. Not here. Who was he kidding? He knew what was about to happen and that it was inevitable. Might as well go along with it.
Steve on the other hand could not comprehend the army roaring praises for him for beheading a defenceless man. However, any protest he could have shouted died in his throat as General Fury gave a look of deep disappointment. He would never here the end of this.
“Sam, I have thought it over carefully, please be assured” Steve  said. “It was General Fury who held the reins of the Rogers Empire in my name for years. All these years…” Steve said as he started walking down the path that lead to a tree he himself had sown in the name of his father. Both the Generals followed their Emperor quietly.
Tony was shocked. He was not only being encouraged to experiment and invent rather his ideas were finding implementation in the Empire. He really had hit gold mine.
It had been so good before Secretary Ross showed up on their door with the accords. Tony and him had been dancing around each other for a while and Steve had finally gathered courage to ask him out and tell him that he was head over heels in love with the genius. This is why he told Vision to let him know when Tony came to the compound. He had planned something special, with flowers, chocolates, candles and all that jazz. But that is when everything went to shit.
Pepper asked him what she was to do with the letter he wrote yesterday and the vial of poison. Tony asked for those to be placed with his belongings in a secret compartment. They could be still of use. One could never know.
“Oh Howard I can hear you thinking from here. Why don’t you just leave the poor boy alone?” said Maria, his wife, with a sigh. She was sitting in front of the huge mirror, trying to fix her unruly curls.
“Crowning glory of the Ancient dynasty of Rogers, the Emperor of America, Steven Grant bestows us with his presence.” As Steve took the throne, all his courtiers greeted him with a low bow, while Howard and his party bowed with their hands joined together in a traditional salute.
“These parrots are really rare and very difficult catch, Your Majesty.” Clint said. “They are known for their intelligence. They learn words very quickly.”
“Clint, I told you Tony doesn’t like teasing. Let him be. He is in love.” Added Pepper in a playful voice. Tony quickly sent a prayer to the heaven thanking them for the fact that other members of his Omega party were not here. It would have been so embarrassing.
“Who is this man that dares to speak to the Emperor in such raised voice?” Tony asked Clint. Was it normal that Tony was getting angry at this strange man for speaking to his husband like that?
“Yes your majesty.” Barnes replied in a sassy tone. “The peace proclamation that was sent by you, came back in pieces so I think we know where they stand on that.”
This time Rhodey did laugh and looked at Tony with unconcealed pride in his eyes as they made their way towards the armoury. “I must admit that you are a very quick learner my Prince,” Rhodey said. It had only been 6 months since Prince Anthony, all 20 summers of age had started training under Colonel Alpha Rhodes and today he had defeated his mentor himself at swordplay.
Steve heard a huge applause break out from the stands of the arena along with Bucky’s proud and distant cries of ‘that fucking idiot!’ and looked over to see his friends Bucky and Sam standing there with 3 other men. From their attire, Steve deduced they were from the West. Two of them were Alphas and the one woman who accompanied them was a Beta. He smiled at them and urged the elephant to move towards the royal stand with his feet.
The Emperor’s smile fell from his face and so did the smiles of all the other courtiers present. Tony could see Bucky clutching Natasha’s hand tightly before either of them did something inappropriate.
The wave of realization hit Fury. This was not Steve the thirteen year old kid he mentored he was talking to. He was now addressing Emperor Steven Grant Rogers.
Rogers looked like he was about to burst. "Is everything a joke to you?" "I already told you Cap, only funny things are" Tony said in a bored tone. He thought he possibly could not piss Steve off further so decided to end the argument quickly. He needed that bed now as another wave of dizziness passed through him.
“Tony! Hey Tony! Stay with me!” Leave it to Steve to not let him pass out in peace. Fuck him. Tony always does what he wants to. He and Steve can fight about it later. The last thing Tony felt was Steve picking up his pace as blackness surrounded him.
“Steve, by refusing to strike this man who has rebelled against your authority, you are sending the wrong message to your army,” he said vehemently. “Your army will not consider you a true Emperor if you do not do this.”
Tony smirked as they started walking back towards the pavilion. “It comes with being a genius and all you know. And Pumpkin please stop calling me Prince, you know I hate it when you do that.”
“I hope you didn’t hurt yourself. Apologies for startling you.” Steve began. He could see that Tony was nervous.
Steve prayed as he knelt at his father’s grave. “Dear Baba, help me. I have come to your sacred grave with a dream – your dream of a united America under the Rogers dynasty. Bless me so that I can turn it into a reality.”
“General Barnes?” Fury questioned, calling upon the second highest commander of the Rogers army, another Alpha and Steve’s childhood best friend.
He grew pensive and brooding, stopped taking care of himself. It was when he finally had the pardon letter in his hand that he had the courage to look in the mirror and he was shocked by his own reflection. He did not recognize the old bearded man with sad lines all over his face. The only good thing that he did see was hope in his own eyes. Hope of being welcomed back home and hope of reuniting with his love, the man who owned his heart and was not even aware of the very fact.
“Oh, darling I don’t want you to say anything. All I know is that you don’t care about me. You sure would have shown more emotion if something actually happened to me on the miss - ….”
“Welcome, welcome, my dear Prince,” said a blue eyed omega who Tony came to know as Clint Barton, bodily ushering him towards his quarters. He was supposed to be the head of his Omegas in waiting at the Rogers Fort. He had already become friends with Pepper and anyone that Pepper trusted automatically had Tony’s trust.
“It pains me to ask this of you,” the Queen said. “If not for your father, please do this for our people, Tony. For the Kingdom of California, you will have to sacrifice your happiness.”
After his brief conversation with Natasha, the doctor had come in and did the regular checkups. Well as well as a Shield trained baboon could do anyway. Just as he was done, Tony heard heavy footsteps approaching, running rather and suddenly Steve Rogers burst through the door of his room, recently showered going by the smell of vanilla that filled the room, yet disheveled like he had not rested for a single moment. His eyes were filled with tears of relief. The emotion so strongly visible that Tony’s words froze in his mouth. It was just 30 seconds of them gazing into each other’s eyes as if in a trance.
Tony turned once more to the Emperor and saw him looking helplessly at him. Tony decided that should he be accused of trying to poison the Emperor’s food and be treated like any other cook, then he shall bear it with dignity. Steeling himself, he sat himself in front of the dishes and waited for Pepper, Wanda and Clint to serve him.
Tony’s eyes shot up to meet his mother’s and he found nothing but truth in them. He had known that breaking the marriage alliance with the Stone family had taken a huge toll on his family’s reputation as a result of which they had suffered immense losses, both political and economic.
As if on que, their eyes met from across the room. It was like a spark, a fire burning through Steve’s body. Tony gave him a look which said so much but nothing at all really. This look made him forget that there was anyone else in the room. It was just him and his Tony. He couldn’t look away.
Steve tried to help him up but Tony pushed him away. “I don’t need your help. I don’t need anyone’s help.” Of course, he was no match for Captain America’s strength but that did not mean that he will not try.
“He is leaving for Long Island to take care of some important business,” Pepper answered with a frown.
“We have to do this. As the queen you must be willing to do what is best for your people. Plus, an alpha male of the Great Emperor’s stature would benefit Anthony’s omega status. Imagine he would produce the heir to the Great Empire. He shall be the luckiest omega to ever live.” Howard said as he got up to leave.
King Howard looked up in surprise and so did Steve’s own courtiers. Famous for his indomitable and fiery temper, they were expecting their Emperor to get angry at the outset of being bound by conditions. “All his demands will be met to his satisfaction and let me emphasize that I would be most pleased to do so.”
“Until his last breath, the Emperor Joseph Grant, who now lives in the Great Heavens, had but one dream – to see the Rogers’ standard flying over all of America. Should the God be so willing, you shall be the one to fulfil that dream.”
He jerked Steve’s hand off himself stood up with great effort. Great! Now one step at a time. If only he was not in a daze. Goddamn blood loss.
Steve dropped the sword, the consequences be damned. However, before the army, waiting below the cliff they were standing on could notice, the loyal General picked it up.
Steve finally looked up. His eyes blazing. “Do not complete that sentence Tony. I dare you.” Steve moved two steps ahead, putting his arms on the kitchen counter, trapping Tony between them. “You don’t know what you put me through when you went after that witch. You have no fucking idea how stupid that was.” Steve was practically looming over Tony’s tiny form.
Steve trailed off as he remembered childhood memories of blood and battle. “All these years I have wondered,” he continued. “Why haven’t our forefathers been able to conquer all of America? Until now, I have been thinking of ways to fulfil this duty that was asked of me by my ancestors. The goal was clear but, the path wasn’t.” He said the last part to himself, thinking of the days and nights he spent bent over the map of the American land, devising strategies and diplomatic policies.
Tony decided to end his misery and stepped forward. “It wasn’t Pierre’s fault, Your Majesty. I had asked him let me prepare the feast.”
Then she turned her gaze towards their Captain. Sitting straight, eyes blazing with anger, looking for his opportunity to confront Tony. He looked older and more threatening than he did before, in the Stealth Suit and a full beard. His blond locks were also longer than she remembered. He looked exactly like the Captain he was supposed to be. She was worried for Tony.
“Welcome to the Brooklyn Fort, Emperor Consort,” she said. For a moment, Tony wondered if she was addressing someone else before he remembered that he was now the consort of the Emperor of the East. “My name is Natasha,” she continued. Deadly yes, but her eyes conveyed a very sisterly warmth. Tony was not at all uncomfortable in her presence.
“How do I put up with you and your sass? You better not do this to your new teacher.” As the Prince’s best friend he had been given the duty to break the news of Tony needing start his omega grooming with the queen.
Steve glared at him briefly before shifting his focus to Bruce once again. “They are transferring him to his room as we speak and you can go see him after.” Steve nodded and made a beeline for the Private wards.
“Because…” she paused for a moment as if she were expecting Tony to understand her meaning. He had never seen Natasha at a loss for words. “Because you are the Emperor Consort!” she stated.
“And you know once Pepper found out it was me singing, she went and told Happy. They would often just sit there and listen to me. Rhodey was not vey happy when he found out that I had kept this from him.”
“You do know what this means, right, Tones?” Pepper said. When Tony turned understanding eyes on her, the others appeared even more confused. She rolled her eyes and elaborated. “He is trying to woo Tony,” she said as if it should have been obvious to all. Perhaps it should have been with all that had been happening lately.
Steve knew he had been different even back in the 40s but having feelings for the same sex was considered a sin then. The modern times and their open ideas had helped him deal with his sexuality and he would be joking if he said that Tony was not attractive. Tony Stark always had the ability to drive Steve up the walls but Steve could never understand why he cared so much. Cared about what Tony said, what Tony did, what Tony thought of Steve. It was so frustrating that all his emotions always came out, under the guise of annoyance or anger.
Steve got to his feet and stopped trying to halt the beast. He analysed his options. He saw that the beast was standing close to the wall on which the shields and spears were placed, blocking his access to them.
“Tony you can’t do this every time!” Steve was yelling at him. Right after a mission. So, nothing new there. A mission where at the last-minute Tony had taken a huge risk and saved lives. Yes, his suit was gone and probably not coming back but he had like 20 more so it didn’t matter.
“Keep your distance,” Miss Harkness told the servants who were bowing down to her. The chefs and Tony’s attendants all retreated into the shadows of the kitchen to give Tony and Miss Harkness some semblance of privacy.
“Well Dad I guess you should know that Mom just entered.” And Steve followed Sam’s line of sight. There. Right there was his heart walking around in a suit like he owned the place which technically he did. His Tony looked so beautiful in blue. His decision to express his feelings just became easier.
General Fury then moved to the edge of the cliff and addressed the army. “Brave soldiers of the Rogers army! Like his ancestors before him, the Emperor has proved himself to be a true Emperor.” He held the bloodied sword high in the air for the men to see. “May the Gods bless the young Emperor Steven Grant with a glorious future!” The army below echoed his cries and shouted their support for the Emperor.
Though Steve remained silent, Prince Anthony had gained his respect in a flash. He was concerned about people who he was supposed to treat as below him. He was not only concerned, he had risked immense abuse from both his father and his new alpha just to ensure that his people would be living comfortable in their new home. Steve had made his decision.
Tears were now freely rolling down Tony’s cheeks. He understood all that. He did. And he was just as concerned about the well-being of his people. But, he still could not believe that he was being used as pawn in the political game of chess, with his feelings and opinions being spared no thought. The worst part was that Rhodey was also deployed now. He did not have anyone to share his grief with.
“This is a very special song, for a very special someone. I have really hurt this special someone in the past and was never able to tell them how I feel about them. This is my lame attempt to convey how I feel because I do not deserve a conversation with them and I can no longer sit on my feelings. Here it goes…”
The palace was made of numerous buildings, surrounding a central courtyard from where Tony had entered. Each wing was more beautiful than the other. There was a pond filled with lily pads at the centre of the courtyard, with a pleasure pavilion attached to it. Even the walk to Tony’s quarters was magnificent.
His volume dropped further. “Darling you have no idea how beautiful you are and how much I care about you.” Steve standing so close to Tony that he could feel him breathing.
“I am extremely grateful to you for granting me this audience and taking the time out to listen to me,” Tony said. “I have two conditions and I cannot wed you before these demands are met.” Steve was really curious now.
“Thank you My Lord.” Tony was still looking at the ground but he did not offer anything else. Steve wanted to hear him chatter again.
“I should be allowed to make a scene after what you did. And once we are back, you will lock yourself up in that lab of yours and not come out till next week! Let’s talk this out now!” Well damn his stubborn ass. Arguing with Tony was anyways like rolling with a pig in the mud. Sooner or later his opponent would realize that he liked it.
Across the courtyard, Rumlow was getting bolder and bolder with his choice of words to the Emperor. “How are you any more capable of ruling an Empire than I am?” he said getting into the Emperor’s face. “You were nothing but a puppet in the hands of General Fury all these years. Do not forget that it was my mother who raised you and guided you. I am just as capable as you are, if not more.”
The King smiled and nodded but then his expression turned grim. Steve knew that with a man as calculating as Howard, this was not the end of his bargain.
There were a few who dared to refuse the acceptance of the conditions of the decree. They were against the idea of letting people from the east rule in the west. This refusal was met with the wrath of the Rogers army under the command of General Fury until Steve started taking charge at the age of 18. He lead many wars under the guidance of his mentor Fury and proved himself to be the great leader he was always meant to be.
As Tony walked two steps ahead of him, Steve grabbed the brunette by his wrist and twisted it at the small of his back, pulling him close to his own broad chest. Close enough to feel Tony's breath on his neck.
“Tony, as your mother, I understand what you are going through,” the Queen said, walking closer to Tony and putting her hands on Tony’s shoulder. “Your heart is set out to remain independent and inventive for as long as it can. But, this is what is best not just for you but our people.” With a heavy heart, Maria brought out the argument that was sure to convince Tony. This was for the greater good.
“NO WAY MY LORD!” the panic and disgust was clear in Maria’s eyes. “You claim to know so much about the Great Emperor but have you not heard he is the most cruel and unforgiving ruler that the East has ever seen. He has slain more men than our entire kingdom combined! We surely cannot wed our Anthony to a man like that!”
“Matters of security must be respected by His Majesty,” she said sounding smug. “Even the Emperor himself cannot object to this and that is the law.”
It really was peaceful in Captain America’s arms. Tony chuckled to himself. He was feeling sleepy now, maybe he could close his eyes for two seconds.
This is how Steve also came to be known as one of the most heartless yet ambitious Emperors of his time. Most of the kingdoms who received the decree had seen the wrath of the Rogers army in previous battles. They had no option but to give in to the demands of the decree. Those who were brave enough, were able to negotiate certain conditions of their own but did have to give up their own identity to be absorbed under Steve’s empire.
The swords clinked as Tony struck his to Rhodey’s. The fight was evenly matched. Rhodey advanced on Tony, forcing him to retreat to the pavilion in the centre of the courtyard. Tony paused and crouched low with his sword held ready. He assessed his threat.
Anger and disappointment flashed in Steve’s baby blue eyes, turning them almost black. The king on the opposite side knew that the land in contention rightfully belonged in the Rogers’ empire and yet he refused to acknowledge it to remain in power. He had to get back what was rightfully his.
While it was true that Steve was honoured by the proposal that King Howard had just presented, he did question his intentions. Howard seemed like a cold calculating man who would do anything to remain in control and power. Merely offering his son to an Emperor who can be called an enemy of Howard’s state, did not sit well with Steve. He needed time to think. May be even some divine guidance.
Before the Emperor actually came in, Tony had imagined this conversation multiple times, all of them ending in him being hit either by his father or by the Emperor himself. He imagined the conversation going side-ways. He had prepared for the occasion in case his both his demands were denied, he had two others ready as a way of negotiation. Also deep in the borrows of his heart, he had also imagined the Emperor grudgingly agree to at least one of them. He wasn’t expecting much obviously.
General Barnes steeped forward. “Your highness?” he addressed the fallen king. “This way please.” Before leaving the king bowed before Steve in true admiration.
“Let him go Sam. He’ll be fine.” That was Bucky. Uh… he can’t thank God enough for bringing his best friend back into his life.
“My Liege, pardon me if this offends you, but they consider us, people of the East, as sex hungry savages. They believe that once you lay your eyes on the Prince, his back story would not bother you My Lord.” Said Sam with an apologetic look.
“The Great Emperor of the East, Steven Grant has sent a decree offering us chance to rule California under him. Not only I want to take the chance, I want to offer Anthony’s hand in marriage to him. This would obligate him to be at our beck and call whenever we wish. You have seen what Anthony looks like. I have rejected multiple suitors till now. He would absolutely bewitch the Great Emperor and we wouldn’t have to worry about a thing.” Howard explained his plan. This would bring the mightiest warrior Alpha under Howard’s control.
Steve got to his feet and closed his eyes, letting the rhythm of Tony’s voice wash over him. The song was a siren call. As if in a trance, Steve walked away from his throne, cutting his way through the courtiers that were staring at him. His heart pulled him towards the source of the magical sound and his feet moved of their own accord.
Miss Harkness then moved closer to Tony, almost getting on his face. It was clear that this move was an attempt to intimidate Tony rather than for keeping her voice down. She was several inches shorter than Tony but her cold gaze made him feel like a helpless child. “Do not forget that your marriage with Steve is just an alliance,” she said. “A trade made in exchange for peace.”
Tony felt a genuine smile break across his face. He was leaving his home behind to live in a fort full of strangers. His life will never be the same again. But, Tony was glad that his closest friend apart from Rhodey, would be accompanying him to the Animal Planet. He just stepped forward and pulled her into a grateful hug. He would not let anything happen to her.
“I am still so mad at you for whatever happened. But I do love you and I am willing to try this. You just have to promise to try and communicate with me.” Was what Tony said in return.
Living in constant chaos was a part of being the Emperor to a Great Land. The court room hearings, the constant battles, the violence, the blood and gore, the royal formalities, all of them made Steve tired to the bones. But he did it without complaint for his people, his father’s dream and his mother land.
She quickly recovered from her shock and smiled back which was more warm than before now. She then led Tony to a group of other Omegas, standing a few feet away. He noticed that there was a woman in the centre of the small crowd, who had a very different body language. She was wearing a very heavily ornamented gown with a veil and a tiara on her head. She was old, old enough to be his mother, but the warmth in her eyes was so much better than the pitty he always saw in Maria’s eyes.  Tony deduced that she had to be the Emperor’s mother, Empress Sarah.
Steve did not feel like having to defend his actions but he had to. His courtiers had a right to know why he did what he did. “Noble Alexander, Noble Arnim, every decision I have made has been made to adapt to the times and circumstances. The well-being of the Empire is of the highest priority in my heart. And since you both serve as Nobles in my court, it pains me to remind you that our law does not allow any form of discrimination against anyone. Marrying Prince Anthony was not just for the Empire, it was a personal choice. The Prince is fierce and talented. He would make a great consort for me and will serve the nation with all his heart. I am sure you don’t think that we should behave differently with people merely based on their culture and origin. This not what your faith is about, am I right?” said Steve with a stern glare. It was clear that this was not a question.
But Steve also knew that as the Alpha he would have to make the first gesture, then depending on Anthony’s response he would proceed from there. There was also a chance that the Prince was expecting to be claimed and if Steve did not make the first gesture to initiate the bonding, the Omega might feel rejected.
He ran his fingertips lightly over the Prince’s knuckles and Anthony flinched. Steve understood. Tonight was not the night. He could just take today to comfort the Prince and put him at ease, make him realize that Steve was safe.
“Eye of the Hawk, you must refrain yourself from hitting our leader. I have full faith in him. He can never hurt one of his own.” Thor asserted. He let go of Clint’s arm and turned his gaze towards Steve. “Oh, Captain of this blessed Nation, do tell me what happened in the meeting room.”
“Dissolving a marriage might be a part of your culture but, in our culture it is a bond that lasts through the life and the afterlife,” Tony said softly, with no hint of derisiveness in his voice. It was clear that even if Tony did take up Steve’s offer, it was more than likely that Howard would kill him when he reached California. Steve suddenly thought that perhaps living here with Steve despite an unhappy marriage was the safest option for the Prince.
Brock took another step forward with a sadistic glee in his eyes. “Pardon me, Your Majesty, but these protestors do not believe in your ability to rule. They even went so far as to say that by going through with this marriage, you have brought dishonour to your ancestors and the Rogers Empire. They justify their disobedience by saying such things of you.”
“Yeah the doctor” Tony lied. Who was he shitting? Of course, Natasha knew he was looking for Steve. He might as well write it on his forehead. Whatever they had between them, was too obvious to hide now. “Nat where did Steve go?” he finally asked.
“Huh?” Clint and even Natasha looked at him as if he had told them that the sun rises in the west while Pepper gave him an understanding look.
“Your Highness, your highness Prince Anthony,” came the voice of a page boy and Rhodey’s concentration wavered as his eyes diverted to the boy who had now entered the courtyard. It was just a split second but that was all Tony needed to gain the upper hand. Tony drove the tip of his blade into Rhodey’s sword’s handle and Rhodey instinctively released his hold on his blade with a pained grunt.
“And if Steve never touches you, how can you bear him an heir? You think no one knows what is happening? Where is your bonding mark dear Prince? Why can’t I smell the Emperor on his Omega?” she took a long dramatic pause, glaring daggers at Tony.
The feast was ready. As per custom, the Omegas were walking towards the dinner set up at the royal courtyard. Steve along with all his important Generals and Ministers was sitting at the table. It was a party of around 200 people. The courtyard had been elaborately decorated with a Western theme. The typical abstract and bold patterns were making the courtyard look absolutely exquisite.
It had been three days since the rogue Avengers had come back to the American soil and to the compound and out of those 72 hours, Steve had spent at least 40 in press conferences. They were necessary yes, but that did not mean that Steve had to like them. Neither did it mean that he had to attend them with full concentration, which was anyways impossible for him.
“Guys I’ll be walking home. Don’t wait up” that’s all he said to Sam and Buck as he walked past them as well, in a hurry to get to the exit.
“As you wish,” the King said and Steve knew that soon a Western province would be a part of his Empire.
“That’s it! I am done with your antics!” Steve was still behind him somewhere. Still yelling. But the good thing was he had realized that caring about Tony Stark was impossible and he was done. Tony was waiting for this shoe to drop. He knew Captain America, his childhood hero caring about him was nothing but a joke. He smirked in satisfaction, still trying to drag his feet to the tower.
Both Sam and General Fury trusted Steve blindly when it came to the interests of the Empire. He was a true leader for whom they were ready to sacrifice even their own lives. This did not stop the from having concerns about the alliance that Steve had just announced, but they were also not going to question it further. The order was clear. They bowed low, with a sweeping gesture of their hand and left the Emperor standing peacefully below the tree that reminded him of his father.
With every word that Brock spoke, Steve’s blood boiled with rage. “My Lord…” he growled low in his throat. He couldn’t believe that his people were spewing degusting words for his Omega and him. Steve had always tried to ensure a sensitivity to the Western culture in his empire. A hatred towards his Omega to this extent was shocking.
“Just one sign. Any sign from the heavens above and I am sure I would be able to recognise and follow my gut feeling. Rest in peace and power my Liege. Amen.” And Steve opened his eyes.
“Your Majesty,” Clint announced, “the menu today is Melanzane di Parmigiana, Risotto Alla Milanese, Chicken Lasagna, Spinach and Corn Ravioli along with cauliflower gnocchi.” The Emperor smiled. Tony had told him that his mother was actually Italian and he had experienced a lot of Italian culture growing up. These were the dishes that he had learnt to make from her when he first started his training in the kitchen.
“Welcome, King Howard,” said Steve in a cordial tone. “I am honoured and grateful that you have taken the arduous journey to come here and meet me. I would like to be informed of the reason for your visit my lord.”
Steve and Tony sat directly opposite each other at the conference table. Steve was seething with anger meanwhile, Tony appeared tired and done for the day. This seemed to make Rogers angrier. Everyone in the room was sure that as soon as the meeting was over, Steve will flip on what Tony had done during the mission and Tony being Tony, will just manage to piss him off more.
Steve looked at the beautifully detailed engravings on the sheath with a doubtful look. Nonetheless, he accepted the legacy being handed to him, the burden of it settling heavily in his chest.
“Since the cook today is the Emperor Consort Prince Anthony himself,” Agatha continued, “may he taste the food first.”
He was expecting his Alpha to claim him on their wedding night, his own will be damned. He had not been able to hide his tension as the Emperor had entered and when he had tried to touch him, it had taken everything in Tony’s power to not shake like a leaf. The Alpha was huge, he could have easily killed Tony if he wanted.
“Tony hey, hey look at me. Open your eyes sweetheart.” Steve had no time to correct himself as a wave of worry and guilt hit him hard. Tony was hurt and all he did was yell at the brunette. Keeping his arm around Tony’s waist and easily holding him up, he used his other hand to pat Tony’s cheeks lightly in an attempt to wake him up. Just then, to his absolute horror, he saw a thin stream of blood drip down from Tony’s lips.
“Alone Maria? How? He is my only son. My only chance at having a stable political alliance. But who in their right mind would except him as their omega? This boy can drive anyone crazy.” Howard was convinced Anthony would be the end of his line. He had an annoyed frown on his forehead.
“Your glorious majesty, for the first time today, let your sword out of its sheath and end the suffering our people have faced at the hands of Hydra” Fury roared as he held Steve’s sword in front of him.
“My love, I think I have changed my mind. I am going to fuck a lot of stupid.” Tony said with a snort, referring to their previous argument.
“I knew it was you who was watching cartoons late in the night. You are not as quite as you think you are Rogers. Now let’s go and wait with the others in the waiting room.” She said as she practically dragged Steve by his arm. As they walked in together, Natasha shared a quick reassuring look with Clint who immediately understood what happened. It was absolutely mesmerizing how they could communicate without words. Tony rightly called them the Murder Twins.
Well in Tony’s defence he had been awake for nearly 36 hours now. His eyes were almost black with big dark circles surrounding them. His hair was longer and in a constant bed head state. He looked tired and over-worked. There was no hope to salvage his look, yet as he matched his step with the Emperor walking in the courtyard, his Alpha just looked at him with a small smile and whispered ‘beautiful’. Tony had turned into a tomato right there on the spot and just when he thought blushing further was impossible, the Emperor picked a bunch of flowers from the garden and offered it to Tony.
“Nick, Sam” Steve  greeted the two men with a curt nod and a warm smile while they bowed low with a sweeping gesture of their hands. Steve was their mentee and best friend yes, but he was the Great Emperor first. Formalities were now the norm.
His eyes fell on the parchments spread across his lab along the instruments and materials he had collected from all throughout the city. His next plan was to lay out the drains of the main city in a way that would bring water directly to people’s homes. This way the Omegas’ in any house would not have to travel for miles with heavy utensils filled with water. Along with his vision and project he saw his dreams die in one flash.
“Your Majesty, we have had all the vessels cleansed according to your instructions,” the other Chef, one by the name of Franc, said.
“Your quarters are divided into 5 parts. This is your reception hall, Your Majesty,” Natasha said as they entered. The reception hall was extremely, spacious, may be the size of Tony’s entire bedroom at California, with various seating arrangements and a gilded cage at its centre.
The elephant tried to hit him with its trunk and it would have succeeded if Steve hadn’t ducked in time. But, the other fighter wasn’t so lucky. He fell to the ground with a pained grunt as he lost consciousness. The elephant charged towards the man, its heavy feet shaking the ground on which it stepped. Steve got to his feet and dashed towards the man who was just beginning to regain his consciousness. But, the man was still heavily disoriented and Steve reached him just in time to save him from being crushed by the animal. The elephant’s trumpet rumbled in the brick walls of the training arena.
Steve dragged the injured man towards an enclave in the arena while yelling “halt” in his most powerful voice at the elephant. The elephant followed him to the enclave and stood at its entrance, trapping Steve inside it. The animal tried to hit him once more with its trunk and Steve ducked to avoid the blow. Steve waited for the Elephant to strike again and just as its trunk hit the walls of the enclave, he rolled on the ground to get out the enclave. The elephant advanced on him, moaning all the way.
“No Your Majesty no need to apologise. I lost my balance. I am not hurt, and I have you to thank for that.” He said. He still wasn’t looking Steve in the eye.
Looking down upon the battered man, Steve was reminded of his 13 year old self. This time he was not a mere apprentice to the great General Fury. This time he was Emperor Steven Grant Rogers and he would not let any custom or person come in between him and doing what was right.
Steve only partially regained his senses as he was about to leave the court. He turned around to find his courtiers looking at him strangely. He swallowed hard, wondering what it was about the voice that made him want to abort a court session. “Disperse,” he ordered.
Steve  nodded, content, and turned to his best friend. The ferocious General looked deep in thought and at once Steve knew that Sam wanted to discuss something very important.
The Empress noticed his fear, just the way his mother would have in a way. “Do not fear, my son,” she said. “This is your home. You will be cherished and loved here.” Tony knew at that moment, that no matter what happened, he would always have the support of the Empress. He communicated his comfort to Pepper with a silent look, who responded with a smile of her own. May be this wouldn’t be so bad.
It had been one week since the marriage, when Steve returned to the Rogers Fort from Long Island. He did not want to leave the very next day after the wedding, making his Omega feel alone, but the business was unavoidable. Apparently there were rumours that Hydra was rising again and this time within his empire. This time under the command of a man called the Red Skull. Steve had to go to Long Island, where apparently he was hiding, to make sure that these were just rumours.
“What wrong have I done to displease you ma’am?” Tony asked genuinely curious now. He did not worry much about her tone. He had faced that enough times already in his young life.
“Yeah buddy actually I am looking for an answer to the question that why did you call me sweetheart that day on the helicarrier?”
Rhodey turned his head to the side and addressed the page boy while still facing Tony. “What is this? Did you have to interrupt us mid-fight?”
“I am sure my Anthony has someone amazing waiting for him somewhere. And Howard he is my son not a political instrument for you to use. I forbid a marriage of convenience for him” said Maria. Hers and Howard’s marriage was one of convenience. It had not worked out very well. She would not let this happen to her son.
Sam continued, “No ‘self-respecting’ royal family in the West would accept Prince Anthony as their Omega now. King Howard’s coffers are running dry as a lot of his alliances have also withdrawn because of what happened with Lord Stone and his son. He is losing control and power steadily. His only solution was to come to you My Liege, someone in the East who is extremely powerful, rich and would not pay heed to Prince Anthony’s back story.” Then Sam hesitated.
The great beast’s moans and trumpets died down to rumbles as it submitted to Steve. He patted its head in a comforting gesture meant to assure it that it was in good hands and the beast quieted.
It had been six hours since Bruce first walked into the waiting room. They had all gone and seen Tony in his private ward. Hooked to all the machines and supports, with a pale face and a bruised wrist, he appeared to be sleeping peacefully. He looked so tiny in that bed. Steve’s guilt was back, hitting him in waves. The rest of them sat by Tony quietly, patiently waiting for him to open his eyes. Oh, those beautiful brown eyes.
Tony on the other hand was shocked beyond belief. He knew his father saw him as a problem that had to be gotten rid of, but he never thought his father would ever ask this of him. The Easterners were known for their heartless and barbaric ways both in the field and at home. This was Howard sentencing Tony to a life of abuse where he would just be expected to behave like the ideal Omega, serve to all the whims of his husband and pop out a baby every now and then.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. Thank God Rogers was too busy looking at the murder twins. There was a seething pain in his upper abdomen, he was dizzy and he just needed to fucking sleep it off. And for that he will have to walk to his allotted room which was on the other side of the helicarrier.
He closed his eyes for a moment to pray for forgiveness for what was about to happen and for the salvation of the men that would fall. He opened his eyes and with a flick of his wrist, signalled for the battle to begin.
“And marrying a Western Prince brings great honour to the Rogers?” Rumlow questioned. Tony was shocked. The emperor was getting criticism because of this marriage? Was he regretting marrying Tony? Tony bowed his head down in shame as Pepper put a hand on his shoulder to show her support.
With that, Natasha left to call the doctor and inform the others that Tony was finally awake. Meanwhile Tony himself was left to marvel at what Natasha had said.
As the wedding procession drew closer to the venue, which was one of the biggest palaces owned by the Eastern Emperor, Tony began to notice the might of the Easterners. The palace was made completely out of glass and marble on the banks of the holy river which marked the border between the East and the West. On the other side it was surrounded by the forest, making the whole view very green and scenic. Huge tents had been set up for the stay of the armies of both the parties on the palace grounds, while their families were set up in the magnificent rooms inside.
“You are not confused Stark. You are an oblivious idiot. He likes you. You like him. It’s literally that simple. Don’t miss your chance. Confront that stupid man.”
Clint stood up dramatically and once more started doing his expansive hand gestures. “Love? Oh, love is myriad of feelings.”
“O great King of the kings, Steven Grant!” Fury roared. “On this blessed day you must consolidate your authority as the Emperor. The courage to put on armour and the skill to wield a sword, will lead you to victory.” He placed the metal helmet of Emperor Joseph Grant on Steve’s head, which was too small to hold it.
At the thought of what had transpired earlier, Steve let go off the tears he was avoiding. The tear drops fell on their clasped hands where Steve was holding the unconscious man’s bruised wrist
It had been one full day since Tony had seen the Emperor. The last time he saw his Alpha was him petting the palace dogs on his way to an important meeting. Tony and his party of Omegas were lounging in the palace gardens with an elaborate picnic. Tony just couldn’t get that image out of his head.
Tony heard Wanda throw the dice and giggle just as Clint groaned. “Oh, no, I lose again,” the blond Omega grumbled.
Steve took his place on the golden throne in the court room as hundreds of his courtiers present bowed down to him with a sweeping gesture of their hand.
Steve wanted to snap at Sam for questioning his decisions but he knew that it was coming from a place of love and concern and his doubts were reasonable. After all such a match between two people belonging to vastly different cultures was unheard of.
Tony sat up. “A feast? In my honour?” Tony asked disbelief colouring his voice. The Emperor was finally taking the reins into his own hands.
“King Howard’s son, Prince Anthony, has placed two conditions before me. And he would only consent to our marriage if these demands are met. His first condition: I will have to make sure a safe and comfortable accommodation for all his people travelling with him. Second, he wants to have a separate room for his inventions and experiments.”
“Start preparing for my departure. I will go there myself and ensure that the Great Emperor does not refuse.” These were his parting words as he dismissed Maria’s last try to convince him otherwise. That stupid boy will be his golden goose.
Everyone was expecting Steve to claim Prince Anthony tonight. Giving into his Alpha nature, it would be a lie if Steve said that he was not excited. He had seen Tony, even if just an obscure silhouette, he knew his Omega was extremely attractive. However, Alpha yes, Steve was also a man of honour, there was no way that Steve would ever lay a hand on Prince Anthony if he desired otherwise. It was the reason why Steve had not kissed Anthony during the wedding so as to not make him uncomfortable. Steve thought that might be the most likely scenario given Anthony’s history.
Of course giving an Omega from the East tools and room to experiment would raise eyebrows in Brooklyn. But, Steve was the Emperor and could do as he pleased. And after seeing Prince Anthony demonstrate such courage and dignity, Steve was bowled over. He had the insane urge to satisfy any demands that the Prince may have.
There was a moment of uncomfortable silence as the Omegas began to serve the food and Tony was still looking down, not meeting anyone’s eyes. Then to his absolute shock he heard the Emperor say…
“Tony I will never leave you again. That was the worst mistake I have ever made. I plan to stay and if that takes working on our communication skills, I am game.
As Steve entered the magnificent room that was carefully decorated for the newly wed couple’s first night, the door was shut behind him. The interior was beautifully decorated with exotic smelling flowers. In a bowl, by the bedside, were delicious looking fruits. There was also a generous assortment of wines and other beverages. The large bed in the centre was covered in rose petals. Lavender scented candles which were scattered across the room bathed the interiors in a warm orange glow. The aim of the arrangement was to create a romantic atmosphere for the newlyweds, Steve guessed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“18 hours Shellhead. 18 Hours. We have had to survive 18 hours of Steve moping around the helicarrier. Please get up and talk to him already.” As Tony’s gaze shifted back to where Steve was supposed to be standing, he found the spot empty. Steve had already left.
Rhodey aimed another blow at Tony but this time Tony was ready. He hit Rhodey’s elbow with his hand pushing him away. He needed to gain his footing before he could make any offensive strike. But, Rhodey used the momentum to drive his sword into the ground at Tony’s feet. The sword hit the asphalt in the spot where Tony’s foot had been just moments ago.
“My Prince, I would not even lift your veil without your express permission but I want you to look me in the eye as I say this to you.” Steve did not move from the place he was standing in, he merely hoped that Tony would do as he said.
Maria looked at him in shock. “Howard! What decision are you talking about?” she said alarmed. She could guess where this was going and to her absolute horror, she was right.
Tony smiled sadly at the parrots, he could sympathize with their captivity, and followed Natasha as she led him and Pepper deeper into his quarters. “This is your sleeping area,” she said, leading him to a room with a large round bed right in the centre. It was covered with lush bedcovers and uncountable cushions. There were small tables on both sides of the bed with oil lamps kept on top of them. The walls were covered in ornate carvings depicting various Eastern tales that Tony had read in his library back at home. Other than the bed, the room had a float in front of the bed with water and various exotic flowers for decoration.
Steve understood that he had to apologise to Tony for his behaviour. In his haste to leave, he had not even been able to inform Tony of his departure. Lord, Natasha was going to kill him.
Across the battlefield, cries of protest erupted from the camp of Hydra. The battle horns were blown, archers readied their bows, the riders mounted their stead and the swordsmen unsheathed their weapons.
“What do you think I have been doing in the palace all these years?” Clint said. “I utilize my leisure periods to unite hopeless couples in love. Oh, the romance…and sometimes even find love for myself” he said with a wink.
“Maria are you out of your mind?! Your know my rule weakens day by day. Our army is half the size of what it used to be. Anthony is going to save us from losing control. Not only that, he will save our people from starving and constant wars. That is what I was here to talk about. I have made my decision.”
“But, the protestors in Queens may have a point, Madam Harkness.” said Alexander Pierce of the House of Alexia, one of Steve’s Nobles and spiritual advisers said as he stepped forward.
He could never stand up for attacking a man who is already down. He had to make his opinion known even if it came out in a shaking voice, cracking with the onset of puberty.
Steve froze visibly. How did Tony hear that? He was so fucked. There was no way he could deny it now. But he was Steve Rogers after all. One of the most stubborn men in the history of America. “I don’t know what you are talking about Tony.” Steve got up from his chair and stood in front of Tony with an innocent expression.
Tony, on the other hand, was desperately trying to free his wrist from Steve's hold. But he was no match to Captain America’s strength even though he knew for a fact that Steve was not using his full force. He was literally yelling at Tony, holding him forcefully and all Tony could think about was how close he was to Steve.
It goes without saying that as the priest pronounced them both Alpha and his Omega and the Emperor and the Emperor Consort, Tony was nervous about the kiss that was supposed to follow. However, he was shocked that the Emperor did not lift his veil to kiss him on the lips, rather he just kissed him on his covered forehead.
“Welcome, Your Majesty,” a soft voice said. He had to admit that his betrothed had a beautiful voice – soothing and firm at the same time. Steve felt some of his anger melt away and curiosity take its place. If the prince had dared to impose conditions on the Great Emperor, maybe they were things that were really important to him? Steve really liked a little rebellion.
They were down the street which led to the tower and the Avengers had decided to walk back with full gear. Wide-eyed stares and camera clicks be damned, everyone was traumatized anyway. Happy was bringing his suit, sorry the remains of his suit, on a crane or something.
Tony kept staring at Steve as if in a trance. Perhaps it was the blood loss or the after effects of almost dying, but Tony just couldn’t look away.
Tony frowned and rushed to the door leading to the terrace with Pepper and Clint following close. On the other side of the courtyard, on the Royal balcony stood the Emperor, Miss Harkness and a man Tony didn’t recognize. They were peeping from behind a curtain to ensure that the party on the other side did not notice them.
“Mr. Captain America sir, you are next up on stage.” He literally had to peel his eyes off Tony to look at who was calling him.
“Are you unhappy with this marriage Prince Anthony?” Steve asked. Tony’s continued silence was all the answer he needed. He sighed.
“You cheated Tones! You have made that sword yourself. How do I know you have not put anything in there to make you win?” Rhodey had to investigate further.
And then, a few days ago, as Tony was deep into his plans for the running water system, he received an invitation from the Emperor asking Tony to join him for a walk. Wanda, the Omega who had brought the invitation to him was giggling and blushing all the while conveying it to him. Pepper and Clint nearly lost their minds and immediately started fretting over how he looked.
At the end of the party were Tony and Steve. Tony walking quickly to avoid the confrontation with the Captain, but the stubborn bastard was stomping behind him, yelling in his ear. Obviously, they had to argue all along the way.
As Pepper left and shut the door behind her, Maria turned to Tony and spoke in an urgent voice. “There is a way out.”
Pepper held him in his arms as he cried and meanwhile his other servant Happy rubbed his back in soothing gestures. The two of them were shedding their own tears as well.
“I appreciate your courage in speaking your mind. And I am quite honoured by your proposal and by the fact that you would consider me as a good match for your son. I thank you for it. Let me give it some thought. I am leaving for my monthly visit to my father’s grave tomorrow at dawn. I will give you my response after I return.”
The Prince hesitated only for a moment, probably intimidated by him, but then spoke in a determined tone. “All my people travelling with me to Brooklyn shall be treated with utmost respect. Their living conditions shall be reasonable and they are to serve no one other than me.”
The elephant had escaped to the training grounds and was followed by Steve, clad in only a cotton shirt and breeches. His cape was thrown wildly the minute he saw the elephant escape the stables. The stable boys, the staff of the palace and his guards could not even recover from the shock by the time Steve had his first confrontation.
“The food is exquisite,” the Emperor said. He looked at Tony with a tender look in his eyes that softened the war-roughened features of his face. “Every morsel deserves praise. I have enjoyed the meal so much that from now on, on every fourth Royal dinner, I will only eat Italian food from the Emperor Consort Prince Anthony’s kitchen.”
Pepper had a look of absolute determination on her face. It was a very common expression for her specially when she had to reprimand Tony for doing something stupid. There was no way Tony could say no now. He knew that if he did object and forced Pepper to stay back, no matter what, she will find a way to follow him to Brooklyn and then he may also be at a risk of losing an eye or a finger perhaps.
“Hey Capcicle! Can’t sleep or what? Tony said in an annoyed yet teasing tone. Steve was startled but he hid it with expertise. “Hey Tony, you want something?” he asked in a soft tone. Even in the middle of the night Tony managed to look absolutely mesmerizing in his black shirt and grey sweat pants.
His courtiers, once more bowing low, left the court room walking backwards so as to not show their back to the Emperor as was rule. General Barnes and Wilson were the only ones in the room other than Steve, King Howard and his men.
Tony smiled warmly at her and then bowed low with his hands joined in front of him. She was shocked by this gesture, Tony could tell. May be she did not expect the Emperor Consort to bow before her but Tony had not done it in order to impress her or anything. He was just generally mesmerised with her achievements.
“Your Majesty?” came Natasha’s voice as she entered Tony’s palace with a maiden in tow. After bowing to Tony with a sweeping gesture of her hand she spoke. “I bring good news. The Emperor has ordered a feast in your honour during this week’s royal dinner.” She said with a teasing smile which genuinely reached her eyes.
“Your Majesty,” Pepper sighed, taking in Tony’s dishevelled appearance and the tear tracks on his cheeks. “Oh Tony, I am so sorry! Come here,” she said, offering him one of her magical hugs. Tony practically melted into her arms.
The main concern that Steve had was that while he understood that Prince Anthony had a history of abuse, what if he was a brat? What if he was just doing this out of spite for Howard? Steve and his pride did not want to be a part of a personal fight between father and son.
“Clint - …” Natasha tried to calm him down. “No Nat. He was so pissed at Tony before we left the room and now Tony is lying in a fucking hospital bed. Maria told me she saw a bruise around his wrist and blood dripping from his mouth. What do you think fucking happened!” Clint lunged at Steve as if to punch him but he was caught by a strong muscled hand.
Despite all this romance blossoming between them, he had not seen his Emperor for an entire day now and that was just…not right.
Natasha saw the dilemma on his face. She indeed was the best spy Shield had recruited. She knew that Steve’s stupid and unnecessary guilt trip would just lead to him getting a solid punch from Clint. She had to do something now.
Steve continued. “Because from now on I will make my own decisions. Not only will I make decisions for myself. I will do what is best for my motherland and my father’s dream in my own way.” The General knew that any protest or rebellion now was futile.
“Sam, there is something else. Please have no fear. Speak freely.” Steve comforted him. It was strange to see his childhood best friend hesitate before saying something. This is how Steve knew that he was not going to like what was coming next.
“Nick, how is my dear Maria?” Steve  asked, smiling fondly and the memory of Nick’s little daughter who had no regard for these formalities and had proceeded to climb on the Emperor’s lap to pull at his beard the minute she had met him. “I hope all is well at your home?”
Currently, Pepper, Clint, Wanda, Helen, Janet and Tony were playing an age-old game of Pacheessi in Tony’s quarters. Well Tony was barely playing, rather he was lost in the thoughts of the Emperor.
The next thing Tony saw was blood. A lot f it. No wonder he was starting to feel a little dizzy. There was a huge piece of glass protruding from his foot. Well walking barefoot on a ruined street will do that to you.
"I bet you 10 bucks they will start as soon as we leave" said Clint with a smug smile. Natasha raised an unimpressed eyebrow and replied "Like I am gonna bet against that."
“Cap let it go. I made a fucking judgment call which saved lives! I regret nothing!” It was time for him to yell back. Tony knew they would go back and forth for some time, leading up to one of them stomping off, followed by not looking at each other for at least a week. It was their usual dance.
His line of thought was dismissed as another wave of nausea and dizziness passed through him and he registered the radiating pain in his captive wrist.
“As he grew up he realised that he was being emotionally manipulated, he understood the meaning of abuse and broke off the union. You know what the West is like when it comes to Omegas and their rights, My Liege. The break in the union was blamed on Prince Anthony instead of Lord Stone’s son. They called him rude, bitchy, entitled and a plethora of other names, some even going as far as witch.” Sam said with a humourless chuckle.
Tony Couldn’t take it anymore. The only reason he was not on his knees crying his heart out was the fact that Natasha was literally holding him up. He had to do something. He had to get out. He turned and walked right out of the hall. He knew that the others would not stop him as they were too shocked to react too.
The most surprising part of the conversation that day was when Tony felt comfortable enough to bring up his project in front of the Emperor, he did not just brush it off after listening to it, like Howard or Ty would have done, rather he was genuinely curious. He even asked Tony if he could bring it up in his next court proceedings.
Natasha and Clint led their small parade, speaking amongst themselves in that spy sort of way. Bruce was following them quietly, with his shy shuffling. Thor on the other hand, as loud and boisterous as ever, was trying to catchup with Bruce as he stopped often for an autograph or a photo with a fan.
Tony looked around. He was back in his bedroom at the penthouse. His foot was now bandaged and his pain was a dull ache. He did remember what had happened.
“Pardon me, Your Majesty,” she said not sounding sorry at all. “Let me remind you that according the Imperial Law the food that is to be presented to the Emperor should be tasted first by the cook. Only then is it considered safe for the Emperor to eat it.” She said with unconcealed glee. Here was another opportunity to embarrass Tony.
It took one glance and Tony knew that not everyone in the Rogers palace was friendly. Agatha Harkness looked like a woman who was not to be messed with. She had long dark curls which were tied up in a knot on the top of her head. Her eyes were cold and calculating, which reminded Tony of Howard in a way. She was dressed in a very simple black attire, yet looked incredibly powerful.
“Victory is still a victory sour patch.” Tony couldn’t help but gloat. He too removed the protective head gear, freeing his luscious brown locks. “I have defeated you and you succumbed to the might of Prince Anthony Stark” he said with a smirk and held his sword up. Rhodey smiled and retrieved his sword from where it was hanging on Tony’s blade.
Howard shrank further into himself, clearly understanding Steve’s subtle message. “Forgive me Your Majesty, he has refused to talk to anyone but you.”
Tony sagged in relief. He had these weird feelings about Steve since as long as he can remember but his brief state of trance right before passing out articulated his thoughts for him. He was in love and the forehead kiss just pushed him over the edge. It was the sign Tony was looking for and now he had a date. With Captain America.
Steve put his hand over Tony's trying comfort him but Tony quickly drew his hands closer to his chest.
As he walked away from Tony’s quarters, the cool wind caressed his skin. But, he could still feel the warmth in his fingertips where he touched Tony. Steve imagined Tony singing for him someday with the chatter that followed. His heart fluttered in his chest and his blood sang in his veins. Yet, Steve felt tranquil and happy.
As promised here is Chapter 2. It is mostly Steve but I promise we will have more Tony from here on.
Four summers after the death of the king, the war came a head. Steven, all 13 summers of age and newly presented as an Alpha, had already started grooming up as the Emperor his people looked up to him as, under the guidance of the loyal General of the Rogers family, Alpha Nick Fury of the House of Shield and his wet nurse Omega Agatha Harkness. He was supposed to lead his army to victory in this battle.
Tony had never seen the Emperor without his robe on. And though he looked fit and strong in the heavily embellished garments, it was nothing compared to what he looked without them. Sweat formed in rivulets and ran down his spine, disappearing into the linen. Tony had not seen anything so beautiful.
The minute he entered the tower on his wheel chair, he was greeted by a hysterical Pepper, a worried Rhodey and a mother hen Jarvis. He was being pushed around by Bruce and all the others had arranged a small welcome back party for him. Steve was there at the party but was trying too hard to avoid Tony’s gaze. He ran away from Tony like he had two heads for the whole duration of the party. Okay maybe Tony was exaggerating a little but he was annoyed as hell so it was allowed.
The main courtyard was a grand affair, set in the traditional Eastern style, meant to impress the people entering the fort. One could easily view the entire structure of the palace from the courtyard. It was also strategically made that way Tony realised. Tony’s entire party was now standing right in the middle of it. He could practically feel the hundreds of people, from courtiers to the palace staff, staring at him. Everyone wanted to see what the new Emperor Consort looked like.
Steve nodded, though he wasn’t sure if Tony was looking at him from under his veil. It was time for Steve to offer Tony his reassurances.
“Maria misses you terribly, Your Majesty,” said General Fury. “Everything else, however, by the grace of God, is well.”
“Easy… take small sips.” Tony looked up and saw Steve looking down at him with concern and frustration in his eyes.
You can’t really blame him for accusing Steve of not caring. It was not like they were best friends. They were barely on civil terms. Well Natasha did say that it was like they couldn’t see anyone else when they were together, but they were fighting all the time so that didn’t count. Tony knew Captain America hated his guts.
A smile slowly formed on Tony’s lips as he blushed like a tomato once again. The glow returning to his face.
Steve knew he did not deserve to sit near him but he couldn’t bring himself to move away. Or to look away for that matter. It was after 5 hours that the others succumbed to their exhaustion from the mission and the debacle after, and decided to move to their quarters for the night. Steve had absolutely refused to leave Tony alone and had simply dragged an uncomfortable looking chair next to the hospital bed, on Natasha’s insistence. He would sit and sulk right here till Tony woke up so that he can apologize for being the stupid excuse for a teammate that he was, as soon as possible.
Trying to put his friend out of his misery, Tony interrupted. “It is alright, Pep. To tell you the truth Clint, I do not know what love is,” Tony said in a teasing voice. He was way beyond Tiberius Stone. It was no more an issue to him.
“You will have to accept my son, the Prince Anthony’s hand in marriage. And this marriage is the only way an alliance between Stark and the Rogers Empire can take place, Your Majesty.”
“He is Brock Rumlow,” Clint whispered to Tony. “Nephew of Miss Harkness, he is the foster and older brother of the Emperor. He dares to challenge the Emperor without any claim to the crown or to the throne,” continued Clint
Tony was both confused and curious. However, he did not take much comfort in what had just happened. Tony did not know for a fact that the Emperor would keep his word or for that matter if anything that he had said was true. But Tony gave his own word that if the conditions were met, he would marry the Emperor. He was bound.
“You fucking asshole! What the fuck did you do to him?” Clint yelled as he barreled down the hallway, his fists turning white and face turning red. None of them had changed out of their uniforms, rushing down to see their fallen team mate. Bruce immediately rushed inside the room where they had taken Tony. He was a doctor after all.
There were sighs of relief and agreement all over the room. All of them knew that Tony had a very short attention span and he would get bored of the medical area before the doctor would finish saying medicine. He also had this constant urge to move. The resting idea will not work very well with Tony.
“My lord” roared General Fury. “Behead this man who dared to challenge your authority as is custom.”
Tony made his way towards Miss Harkness to greet her by touching her feet when she spoke in a cold, harsh voice. “There is a difference between dreaming and attempting to fulfil those far-fetched dreams,” she said. “Do not fool yourself into believing that a Prince has become an Emperor Consort.”
The following two years that he had spent hiding, were the most difficult years of his life and that is including the time he spent fighting in the war. Probably the difference between now and then was that back then he had no home that he had left behind and now it was the love of his life that he left had broken and beaten in the middle of nowhere.
“The honourable Phil of the House of Coulson,” it was announced. Phil, Steve’s finance minister stepped forward.
His hopes had risen as he saw Tony standing on the landing pad waiting for Steve’s Quin-jet to touch the ground. His foolish heart expected Tony to run into his arms but obviously the reality was like a slap in his face. Tony had merely offered a forced smile and a distant ‘welcome back’ and had run back to his lab, his fort, immediately afterwards.
Ignoring the helpless look Howard gave him, Steve walked into the prince’s room. The door was shut behind him. He was surprised to find a veil, dividing the space in two, hiding his betrothed from him. Steve had never seen Prince Anthony but from his silhouette, he could deduce that Tony had a lithe form. He was short – at least about a head shorter than Steve himself. Steve’s immediate thought was how perfectly they would fit together. Steve wanted to push back the threadbare curtains and see the prince’s face. He wondered if he would find Tony’s face as interesting as his silhouette. He had no idea where that thought had come from but he quickly pushed it aside to focus on the conversation that was about to happen.
“Greetings to you too Miss Potts.” Tony loved the fact the Pepper was being treated with full respect.
Tony smiled at her. “It might be a trade for you. But, in our culture marriage is a bond that is sacred. It only breaks after death.”
He held the royal sword in his arms in front of Steve. “I, Nick Fury of the Noble House of Shield, loyal servant of the Rogers dynasty, reminds you once more today that the fate of the Rogers dynasty is in your hands, Steven.” Though overwhelmed, Steve took his sword with steady hands.
Of course, Tony was not able to make it very far from the exit of the hall. He had collapsed on his knees right after a few steps and was still able to hear Steve’s sweet voice through the walls.
Truth was, Tony had a hard time connecting the Emperor he heard of through tales in court with the man he saw the day before. The Emperor he heard of was a ruthless foreign invader who destroyed many an army on the battlefield. But, the man he saw didn't seem to be heartless monster. This man was understanding, compassionate and beyond generous. May be he could really have a life with Emperor Steven but for that he had to put his own prejudices aside. Though Tony also knew that he could not be so quick to judge. He needed more time, which the Emperor had given him.
Steve immediately knew this was far more serious than mere dehydration or lack of sleep. He got into his full Captain mode, putting his free arm under Tony’s knees and sweeping him off in a bridal carry. His fingerless leather gloves made his grip easier.
“My, my!” Clint said, looking impressed yet shocked now. Natasha and the others mirrored that expression.
“Please, do not misunderstand,” Steve was quick to say. He was not questioning the Omega’s health or virtue at all.
Currently none of them were paying any attention to Fury's usual 'shouldn't have done this' 'shouldn't have done that' shit. Bruce was unabashedly dozing off in the corner and Clint and Natasha were murmuring quietly to each other. Meanwhile Thor, fascinated with the new StarkPhone Tony had gifted him, was once again trying to text Jane. Steve was busy trying to control his anger and Tony was looking forward to his bed, feeling unusually tired.
The Emperor shook his head in disgust. “On what grounds could I have appointed him the Prime Minister, Aunt Harkness?” The Emperor now did not even consider Rumlow worthy of responding to directly.
24 hours later, they had already landed in New York and now Tony was being moved back to the Tower. Steve had not come to see him for the rest of his stay at Shield medical and saying that Tony was disappointed, was an understatement. He was really looking forward to confronting Steve as soon as possible. He could not live with this feeling of confusion any longer. If only he could get an opportunity.
She said it without realising the kind of affect it had on Tony. Her words turned into wretched sobs as she cried on Tony’s shoulder. Tony’s mouth was agape. He was frozen in shock, hardly believing what he had just heard, even as tears flowed freely from his eyes. The gravity of the situation hit him hard. His mother was right. It was better to kill yourself than face a lifetime of abuse again. He closed his palm on the vial and felt the cool metal burn into his skin and leave a permanent scar.
“I heard of your conditions Your Majesty.” Said Natasha, pulling him out of his thoughts. Tony smiled shyly. “You truly are brave to demand something like that from the Emperor.” Then she bent forward and almost whispered, “I am happy to have someone other than me, who can keep Steve on his toes” with a playful smile and Tony beamed at her. They were definitely going to be friends.
“As you wish…Tony” Natasha smiled at him one last time, bowed low and then left Tony with his Omegas in waiting to settle in.
The Emperor smiled and asked for the dancers to be presented. Tony felt sick to his core. He couldn’t sit and celebrate his marriage with a man he had no affections for. The weight of what had just happen set in and his tears began to flow once again.
The kneeling king was older than Steve by several decades, he had just lost brutally to the Rogers’ army yet his eyes were full of resignation and not submission. Steve always respected a little rebellion.
As he turned around, making his way towards Tony’s palace, he heard the announcement. “The court has been adjourned for the day.” He did not look to see if the courtiers had left. He knew that they were all frozen in place staring at his disappearing back. He had waited long enough to see his Omega.
“Well if you give me attitude like one and then pass out on me…you deserve the princess treatment.” Well Steve did have a point.
Tony pulled back and spun Rhodey’s sword on the axis of his blade, gleefully, mischief shining in his beautiful brown eyes. Rhodey put his hands on his hips and looked at Tony with amusement and pride. Tony saw the cloth on his best friend’s face flutter as he sighed.
Oh no he made Captain America swear. Tony knew he was deep shit but he was Tony Stark of course he had to say something snarky. "No, I don't fuck stupid so honey you should try somewhere else." He said with his trademark smirk.
There he was. The object of his affections in the balcony right opposite to his own, yielding a sword and missing a shirt with his pants hanging low on his hips. Boy did Tony mention he was in love?
It was like watching a movie. Everything was in slow motion. He took in the image of the Captain carrying him. Steve was wearing his stealth suit, and those stupid fingerless gloves. His hair was definitely longer, combed backwards neatly in waves. Of course, there was no fucking strand out of place. His beard felt soft as Tony’s arm brushed against it every so often as Steve walked. Did Tony ever tell Steve how good he looked in that beard? It must be Tony’s dazed head, but he could see a golden hallo form over Steve’s head or maybe that was just the sun setting. He was not sure.
It looked like the rest of the team had already reached the tower and if Steve and Tony had not stopped in the middle of the street to argue maybe they would have been with them.
“Will you just shut up and kiss me already!” suddenly Steve was pulled forward by his collar, Tony’s lips meeting his half-way. Their first kiss was like everything Steve had ever imagined. It was like magic with Tony’s arms going around Steve’s neck and Steve tightening his around Tony’s waist.
Steve bent down and looked directly into Tony’s eyes. Those baby blues were looking through his facades, his walls, his insecurities. “More than you know Tony” Steve whispered gently as he tucked a wayward curl behind Tony’s ear. Then to Tony’s sheer shock he kissed Tony’s forehead. “Rest up.” Steve was leaving again. It was now or never.
Tony was staring at him too, with wide blown eyes. He was shocked to his Alpha in the room. Tony probably didn’t even know that Steve was back from Long Island.
Steve was as shocked as he was angry. He knew he would receive a divine signal to help him with the matters of his marriage but he never thought it would be so soon. He had a chance to  not only save an innocent Omega from years of abuse but also to enter the Western provinces as a friend instead of as a threat. He would be able to prove to these people that Easterners were people of great honour too. Once he does that, his father’s dream of the Rogers flag flying over all of America would get closer to him.
The Emperor smiled at Tony and shook his head fondly, eating the food anyway. He seemed to like the way the dish tasted for he had some more. Tony turned to glance sideways at Agatha and found her looking at him in confusion and shock. Tony couldn’t help the smirk that formed on his lips when he saw the disappointment in her eyes and this time he did not hide it.
Tony gaped at Agatha in shock, his heart beating fast in his chest. He did not think anyone except the Emperor knew that their marriage hasn’t been consummated. He could not believe what was happening.
As he entered, he could here Tony’s chatter and Steve could only dream of the day when Tony would feel free enough in front of him so that he could hear him rambling. This was followed by a harsh clanging noise. He was in the room designated for meeting outsiders when he saw how much Tony had changed the interiors. They had a very Western touch to them now. The cushions, the curtains, everything was from the West. Maybe this was Tony’s way of feeling more close to home. But he still couldn’t see Tony, he was deeper into the quarters.
He stared at the Great Elephant straight in the eyes and then roared like the true Alpha he was, letting the elephant know that he was in charge. Beside him, the other fighter, one of his loyal servants who had decided to help his Emperor, dodged the Elephants trunk by moving around haphazardly. Steve tried to mount the elephant by holding its large ears but the beast shook its head wildly, making him lose his grip.
His words were very shocking for Tony. He finally saw Tony’s head suddenly move to look up towards him. His eyes and face were still hidden behind the veil. Steve though that may be Tony wasn’t expecting an Omega to have such rights in the East. He knew for fact that the West was very backward in these terms.
“The hell I would be. I have a lot of plans of my own sour patch. And specially after what happened with Ty. I don’t care what dear old dad, the king, has to say about it. I have tons of shit to invent. Have you looked at my plans for the village far east? They are bound to impress even you. Marriage is not something I am planning on anytime soon.”
His Alpha, who was known for his ruthless and fierce ways, was just standing there and melting over a bunch of puppies. He knew that many Omegas in his party has a crush on the emperor. Who wouldn’t honestly? But Tony did take pride in the fact the he was the one the Emperor married. Pepper called it cute and that he was being possessive but why would Tony be possessive?
I know these are heavy themes but our poor Tony is having a hard time. Also they finally meet in this one so yay!
Tony picked up the parchment in his hands and ran the words over and over in his head. “No, I cannot send this letter,” The wave of sheer panic and desperation had settled. “Rhodey is deployed to the borders. He already has enough to worry about. I cannot possibly ask him to go against the King he has sworn allegiance to. It would be an act of treason.” Tony sighed in frustration and ran a hand through his hair again.
General Fury looked at the kneeling and defeated Hydra leader with unmasked disgust in his eyes. “Behead this traitor,” he said, “and bring glory to the name of your ancestors.”
Despite being less in number, the highly trained Rogers’ army under the command of the Great General ended the battle quickly. Thaddeus Ross was then brought before the Emperor for the customary beheading of the enemy.
Steve was quickly losing his cool. “I asked you a question King Howard. What are his conditions?” Steve’s voice was now cold and menacing. The expression ‘I dare you to touch him while he is under my roof’, was clear on his face.
Even the fallen king had respect and tears shinning in his eyes. “I have misunderstood you my Lord. Had I known of your virtues, I would have had no objections to ruling under your sovereignty.” Submission finally shining in his eyes.
The Head Chef stepped forward with his head bowed down. “Pardon me, Your Majesty. It wasn’t me who cooked today’s feast but the Emperor Consort himself.”
He let go off Tony's wrist immediately. "I am sorry I didn't want to hurt you." He could already see the bruises in shape of his fingers forming on Tony's wrist. Oh God he was so stupid. He usually kept a strict check on his strength but Tony just made him lose all control.
“Come on Cap! Loki got your tongue?!” Tony mocked as he started to follow the good Captain. “I caught you, didn’t I? You can stop preten-…”
“Banner” …” Banner wake up – Stop Screaming. It is I, Son of Odin. Would you be kind enough to help me send a smile to Jane from Stark’s magic box?”
“Long live the Rogers Emperor Steven Grant,” said the chamberlain, his call echoed by the other courtiers.
“Prince Anthony has 2 conditions and only post the fulfilment of his demands will he be able to marry you.” Announced Bucky. They were standing in the temporary court that they had set up for the Emperor at the venue of the wedding.
Tony quickly got off the bed and reached the window just in time to see the Emperor’s entourage ride away. He refused to acknowledge the pang of disappointment that came with the knowledge that his husband chose to spend the first day after their wedding away from him. Where was this coming from? May be it was just his Omega nature acting up. He possibly couldn’t be this attached to an Alpha who had shown him a ray of respect.
Tony might have been used to the tone she was talking in but he was also known for his own quick temper and rebellious nature. He never went down without a fight. Miss Harkness had made him uncomfortable in every opportunity she could find, be it during the royal dinners or casual greetings. Enough was enough. He would never misbehave with her but he had every right to say what he felt.
“Oh Anthony! None of those formalities. I am your mother-in-law and you will call me Ma like Steve does.” She said with a warm smile but a firm tone. Tony just couldn’t take it anymore. These people were slowly breaking in through the walls of prejudice he had built around himself. Plus, it did not matter how his relations with his husband were, his family was kind. They had warmly stepped towards him and now it was his turn.
“Then you have to call me Tony like my mother does…Ma” Tony said with a little hesitation and a shy smile but equal warmth. The Great Empress smiled back at him.
“On your guard! Crowning glory of the Ancient Dynasty of Rogers, Great and Mighty King of the Kings, Emperor of the East, graces this court with his presence.” Time to be the Emperor.
There was a knock on his door. “Who is it?” yelled Tony. Trying to get is shaking voice under control.
As he entered the sleeping area, he noticed the assortment of coffee from various parts of the Empire, placed in a bowl by Tony’s bedside and smiled. His Omega had a weakness for coffee. He would make sure that the fort never runs out of any kind of coffee bean that Tony might fancy.
“No. No way. Why would I be angry at you? I was sincere when I said I respect you and all your wishes.”
Well it was safe to say that Tony was not expecting that. He had almost fallen from sheer shock as the Emperor had addressed the people outside the room. If not for Pepper Tony would surely have fallen to the ground and broken something.
Making up his mind, Steve rolled on the ground between the animals legs and reached the other side. Using a shield on the wall as a foothold, he jumped on the Great Elephants back. The elephant roared and tried to shake him off its back, almost causing Steve to fall over in the process.
Tony stood in the large Imperial kitchen, taking note of the various fruits, vegetables, spices and condiments available to him along with the large pots and pans. He had noticed Pierre, the Head Chef, staring at him as if Tony were a figment of his imagination.
“Come on, everyone, listen to today’s menu,” Clint said and all the other chefs followed him. Tony saw the large pot in which the meal was to be made and made his way to it.
The Emperor met his eyes and Tony knew that he had understood what Tony’s intention behind preparing the meal was. For a moment, they were lost in each other’s eyes, the world around them forgotten, smiling softly at each other – that was until Agatha Harkness stepped forward and spoke.
She then looked straight into his eyes and said, “My son has chosen a handsome groom. May the Lord keep you safe from harm. May He keep be you peaceful and happy.” She continued in a quick prayer. Tony was touched.
“Punk, you are so dramatic but I am loving every minute of it.” Said Bucky as he entered the room. “It is my duty, as your…what do they call it? Yes....wingman, that I tell you that I have got you a place on the performers list with my smooth talk and charm.”
Tony turned to look at Agatha with understanding shining in his eyes. He wouldn’t put her above lying about the Imperial Law just to insult Tony but he would happily do it if his husband was concerned. Agatha looked at him with a false smile on her face. “Go on, Prince Anthony. Taste the food and deem it safe.” Her sneer was somewhat concealed.
Pierre broke out of the trance he was in. “This is the first time an Emperor Consort has graced our kitchen with their presence. Has our cooking displeased His Majesty? Is there something we can do for him? Are we in trouble? Please don’t tell the Emperor.” He said in a panicked voice. Tony noticed that he was even afraid to directly address Tony himself.
Taking advantage of Rhodey’s crouching position, Tony aimed a strike on his back which was stopped by Rhodey’s blade. The metal slid against its twin as Rhodey used his sword to push Tony’s to the ground. Tony pulled his sword back and spun around gracefully just in time to avoid Rhodey’s sword. The fight continued with Rhodey aiming strike after strike at Tony, advancing on him, making him retreat to the pavilion once more. But, this time, Tony used it to his advantage and trapped Rhodey’s sword on a pillar with his. One solid blow to the shoulder by Tony’s hand pushed the other man to the ground. But, Rhodey didn’t fall completely, digging his sword in the ground to prevent his fall.
“Your Majesty,” he said turning towards Steve. “Was this the only way of consolidating your Empire? This one begs for your forgiveness but, I would like to say that His Majesty’s heart is ruling his mind.” He raised an accusing finger towards Steve. “What compelled you to have a marital union with a Western prince?”
“Yes! I am his mother. I had fed him my milk. I made sure he had peaceful sleep at night by sacrificing my own happiness. I was the one who protected the Emperor for a very long time from all the dangers in the world. As long as I was with him, no force was even able to harm him. When he was child, Steve was attacked with an arrow. I took the arrow to my chest and saved him. If anyone tries to come between me and Steve, I will destroy them! I have kept him from the world’s harmful eye. And you think I would leave him exposed to your poisonous sight? Never!”
General Fury looked at him in alarm, contemplating the consequences of Steve appearing as an incapable and weak emperor in the eyes of the enemy and his own army.
“Do not try to teach me the meaning of marriage boy,” Miss Harkness hissed. “Which marriage are you talking about? The one that hasn’t been consummated yet?” she said in a sneer.
“The Prince was afraid that you would stew peas in a pot and serve it to the Emperor,” Clint said only to be promptly scolded by Pepper.
"You need to listen and listen good Stark. I’ve had it up to hear with your bullshit. You are going to keep your ego aside and work as a team for once" let out Steve, from his gritted teeth.
But to Steve’s utter shock, Tony’s next step was to bow low and touch his Alpha’s feet. Steve was aware that this was a custom in the West so he went along with it. He touched Tony’s head in acknowledgement of his gesture and then put his own hands on Tony’s shoulder to bring him to a standing position. Then he was reminded of his promise once again and removed his hands as if burned.
The spell was broken by some kid calling for the captain and Tony immediately knew he had to go back. He couldn’t take this any longer.
“Now Excuse me Your Majesty, I have some Court business to attend to before the Emperor’s arrival. Please feel free to reach out to me or my husband General Barnes in case you need anything.” She was married to Bucky?! Well they really were the perfect couple Tony thought in his head.
Fear crawled up Tony’s spine. He knew that his mother-in-law was not trying to scare him, rather she was telling him the truth so that he could be careful. He wondered what would happen if Agatha did not warm up to him. Would she be able to persuade the Emperor to send him back to California? As much as Tony wanted to go back, he did not even want to consider the disgrace that would fall upon him.
It was true that Tony had not felt this way about any one before. Not even Ty. The mere thought of comparing the Emperor to Ty made him uncomfortable. Ty had taken his liberties with Tony since day one because he knew that they were bound together by their respective families. And the Emperor on the other hand had been nothing but respectful and considerate. And so so gentle and so so handsome.
Before Steve could comprehend the immense burden that was being imposed on the shoulders of a teenager, Fury walked over to the edge of the cliff overlooking the battlefield. “Long live the Emperor Steven Grant!” he roared. The army below echoed his cry with a united voice, “Long live the Emperor. Long Live the Great Alpha”
“Pep I know. I want to forgive him, but after what has happened, he has to take the first step. I did my part by making the government pardon him and his rogues. If there is anything there, he has to be the first one to take a step ahead.”
Well congratulations! He was the first person to prove the mighty Black Widow wrong. This was all a mistake. Tony was done.
Tony thought hard about that question. He could have an equally impressive neck piece or robes of gold and silver threads made for the Emperor. But, somehow the material gifts did not seem to encompass the love he felt in his heart for his Alpha. He needed to be more expressive, show the Emperor that Tony accepted him as his husband.
Tony woke up when his maids drew the curtains back, letting the sunlight into the room through the large double doors that lead to a huge balcony. He had not even realised when he had passed out on the bed last night. To be honest he still couldn’t believe how last night had went.
“Why would you take the trouble to do so?” the Emperor asked his voice softer now, his eyes shining with admiration.
On the other side of the American land was the small kingdom of California ruled by the Stark dynasty. The current King Alpha Howard Edward Stark II had asked for more time to convey his final decision when the decree from the Rogers empire had reached his court. He had more important things to deal with at the moment.
“I declare that from now on every prisoner of war will be treated with utmost kindness.” He now raised his voice and addressed all his Generals. “I declare that there shall be no beheading, no insulting and abusing the prisoners of war. It is against every fibre of my being.”
Steve was holding Tony in a dip with both hands on his waist, while Tony had a death grip on Steve shirt. Steve felt as if he was still in a trance, just staring at Tony, but he also realised that he had made a promise not to touch his Omega without express permission. So he let go of Tony gently, helping him regain his balance.
Sarah put a hand on his head and then grabbed his shoulders to raised him up. She smiled affectionately at him, her eyes radiating maternal love and warmth. She then tucked one of his wayward curls behind his ear.
Right before they had left, a certain General Barnes had paid him a visit. Obviously Tony had heard about the deadly White Wolf of the Roger’s army, everyone had, but Tony had never imagined such a goofball would be behind that name. His look definitely did not match his personality. He was tall and muscly, almost as fit as his Alpha. Almost. He had long dark brown hair which was tied in a neat bun on top of his head and had a scar running through his temple to the back of his neck. He looked every bit of the intimidating General he was but behaved like an excited puppy. Tony never thought anyone so deadly could be so gentle.
“Pardon me, Tony if this is out line,” Pepper said from above him. “What if we manage to send a message to the Great Emperor himself, informing him that you are against this match? He couldn’t still be willing to marry you if he knows that you do not wish to go through with this wedding.”
Tony’s mother sensed his inner monologue. The iron was hot, she had to hammer it now. “The other Western leaders aren’t looking favourably upon us anymore,” she explained. “So, this is necessary, Tony. If our relationships with the Easterners also turned sour we would be fighting battles like never before. Brave men will die, homes will be looted, and our people will become prisoners of war. But, if we are on their good side, we will be protected. That was why it was imperative for your father to gain the Emperor’s support.”
He pushed himself away from Pepper’s comforting grip, looked her right in the eye and said, “I have a request that I need you to convey immediately. I demand an audience with the Emperor.”
“Your Majesty, congratulations. Your alliance with the West has given us pilgrims a new reason to rejoice. A group of us Eastern Pilgrims would like to perform a traditional dance in your honour, Your Majesty.”
son. He still flinches at times when someone near him moves too quickly. This is the reason why he decided to take up sword fighting. You surely cannot dismiss that!!” Maria always knew that Howard was a heartless king, husband and father but dumping their son back into the hands of a potentially abusive Alpha, was too much even by his standards.
Tony’s eyes were wide open and mouth agape. Miss Harkness’ presence always put him at unease. But, she had never uttered more than a couple of words to him. He was just as surprised at hearing her talk to him and he was confused about what her words meant.
Tony let the curtain close fully and retreated into the shadows, embarrassed and incredibly turned on. The Emperor grinned at him, through the curtain, letting him know that he knew what affect he was having on Tony.
“May the God above look after you My Prince and best of luck for meeting your new family. They will ensure that you and your companions have the most comfortable stay.” he said and left without a backwards glance at Tony.
Before Tony could protest or stammer while trying to protest, they heard a loud booming voice from the terrace outside.
Tony stared at Miss Harkness, unsure if she was joking and when he was sure she wasn’t, he turned to the Emperor with alarm in his eyes. The Emperor looked just as uncomfortable as Tony was. He wet his lips and turned to speak to Agatha but, she spoke before the Emperor could get a word out.
“No, Sam,” Steve interrupted. Steve was curious to know what his people thought about his marriage to the Western Prince. “Let Brock speak his mind right now.”
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“No I am not going to sing anymore.” Tony had a very playful tone. “I am not that good. If anyone hears it in the palace they will throw me out.” As other Omegas in the room giggled, Steve frowned. He had to let Tony know that his voice was beautiful.
Emperor Joseph Grant Rogers passed away suddenly, 9 summers after his son Steven Grant was born, leaving the burden of running and expanding his empire on his child. Taking advantage of the political crisis in the Rogers’ Empire, Thaddeus Ross, the leader of a large warrior tribe called Hydra attacked the capital city of Brooklyn, in the hopes of conquering the land of East America.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Tony, sweety, last time you didn’t tell him how you felt. You both just got into a really bad fight that was worsened by the circumstances. I am not telling you to forgive him. I am just saying that you both deserve a second chance.”
Tears filled the Queens eyes as she nodded. Tony suspected that she knew her plan wouldn’t work but she needed to hear it anyway. He understood that how dominating his father was. For years, Tony had blamed his mother for not taking a stand for him but now Tony knew how helpless she was. Maybe she was hoping Tony would just take the chance? He realized that the woman sitting before him was his mother and not the Queen of California or for that matter Howard’s wife.
Pepper reacted immediately. She knew that bringing up Ty could be a sensitive issue. She answered instead of the Prince. “Why the sudden interest in the Prince’s love life? Let’s talk about something else.” She quickly huffed.
“Look at me Steve.” Steve felt a soft but firm hand on bearded jaw, trying to lift his face towards Natasha’s. “None of this is your fault. None of it. Tony is impulsive and he wants the best for us. What he did today on the mission was brave, well-intentioned but stupid and he is hurt as a result of that.” This had worried Steve the most. This was the whole reason behind his anger.
“Steve…” General Fury was as surprised as he was angry. “Are you forgetting that you are the future of the Rogers Empire. I have stood by you loyally and mentored you through your youth to make you into the Emperor you are today. I have carefully rebuilt the falling empire of Rogers and today you are intent on destroying it.”
The crowd cheered congratulations to the newlyweds. An Eastern pilgrim spoke to the Emperor as the Emperor took his throne and Tony was sent to the tent set up for the Omegas to sit in.
The first thing he saw was Sam and General Fury, who had now retired as one of his most trusted ministers, walking towards him. He got up and met them halfway through.
His mind was preoccupied with the thoughts of a certain genius. It had been three days since he saw this certain genius and could not forget the look of complete and utter betrayal written all over his face. The worst part was that Steve knew he himself put that look there, he really couldn’t blame Tony. He was guilty and ready to apologize but Tony had made it clear that he wanted nothing to do with Steve.
“Thank you Your Majesty. You and your people have been unbelievably kind to me. I think I would like it here.” Tony said with a playful smile. And it was blinding. Tony had the most beautiful smile Steve had ever seen. He should leave before he voiced his thoughts and embarrassed himself further.
He got up, took a deep breath and willed Steve Rogers away as he switched to his Captain mode. He needed to be strong for his team.
Natasha turned to look at Steve once again. “What the fuck happened in there Rogers?” Her eyes were warm but her expression was one of determination. Steve knew he was not getting out of this one.
“I am fine! I told you I don’t need your concern.” Well Steve was not the only stubborn bastard on the team, was he?
Then he took in his face. Eyebrows scrunched up in…was that concern? Tony couldn’t be sure. But his baby blue eyes blazing fury. He was still mad at Tony but then why was he helping him? It just didn’t add up.
Try as hard as he might, Tony’s voice shook. What his parents were asking of him was too much. He could not possibly marry and live with an Alpha who was potentially abusive, dominating and more controlling that Tiberius had been . His parents were asking him to accept things that were against every fibre of his being.
“And this is your dressing area,” Natasha said showing him an area with a large, ornate gold mirror, a stool and various instruments which Tony guessed were used for getting ready. Right opposite the mirror were large storage chests for Tony to store his stuff and the final touch was the dressing partition.
“Yes my lord.” General Fury replied, smiling at his young mentee. The smile reached his eye (he had lost one during a battle a few years ago). He was so proud of the man Steve was becoming. “The Rogers army only waits your command.”
On one side of the battle field stood Ross with his army that outnumbered Steve’s own two for one. While on the other side was Nick Fury, standing proxy for the young Emperor, with a small but extremely well trained Rogers army.
Natasha made the introductions. “This is the Emperor’s mother, wife of Emperor Joseph the Good, may he rest in peace, Empress Sarah.”
Steve did not realize that he had closed his eyes while singing. As he opened them, he was met with a chaos of clapping, bravos’, shocked and teary-eyed faces but no Tony. That’s it he was done. He got up from the stage and went back to the green room without meeting anyone’s eyes. He felt Natasha’s gaze on him from across the room but he was in no mood for conversation.
“Ladies and Gentlemen, the next performer might come off as a surprise to you but we have none other than Captain America performing for us tonight!”
Steve put his head down on Tony’s bed, near their clasped hands as he felt the exhaustion of the day’s events washing over him. He closed his eyes for a brief moment and his last thought before going under, was of a bright smile and a bruised wrist.
Now was his turn to enter the room, Tony had designated as his lab. Bucky had also informed him that he wanted to do the interiors in his lab on his own. Steve was intrigued. Why would a Prince be willing to manual labour like that? Tony amazed him. He could now clearly hear what Tony was saying.
Tony gasped. There was a sharp pain emanating from his right foot. Tony crouched down, unable to walk further. “Mother of all fucks…”
“A hello would have been nice sweetheart” Pepper knew there was no way that Tony was gonna miss a night so special to his mother just because he couldn’t control how he felt about Captain America.
“While I absolutely condemn the bruise on Tony’s wrist…I mean you should know better to control your strength. I can see that your anger was justified. Stark needs to understand that he cannot offer himself as the bait during every mission we go on. He is not the Shaggy or the Scooby of this gang.” Steve gave her a small half-hearted smile. “I understood that reference.”
Water. That was the first thing Tony thought of as he came to. He needed some water. He slowly blinked his eyes open, turned his head and saw a glass of water at his bedside. If only he could reach it. As he made grabby hands towards it as if he could conjure the glass to move by sheer will, he saw it being lifted and being handed to him. He started drinking like a dying man.
Now, comparatively calmer, he continued, “Yes, the flag of the Rogers Empire will be flown across all of American land but along with the flags of humanity and compassion. We are not invaders who loot this land. We are rulers of America and we will act as such.”
“Which is almost always.” Pepper smirked. “Now I have a company to run. Will that be all Mr. Stark?”
The mission had been simple. Kill the witch and save the civilians. Everyone and everything was going according to Steve's plan until - Tony happened. In an attempt to subdue the witch quickly, Tony had taken a huge risk, deviated from the plan and gotten hit by the energy ball, the witch had thrown at him. Steve knew it was physically impossible for the shorter man to follow orders but he could have died today or possibly gotten a team member killed. That thought did not sit well with Steve. He had to say something. It perhaps, would have been so much easier if Tony was a little less attractive. His big beautiful brown eyes were a little smaller. He was not the perfect size to cuddle. If only his hands did not fit so well in Steve’s. His lips…-
“I came here to apologise to you for leaving you alone at the wedding venue. The matter in Long Island was urgent and unavoidable. Otherwise, I would have definitely come along with you.”
The Emperor then swivelled the metal effortlessly through the air as if it weighed nothing and Tony found his breath quickening and heartbeat increasing. His Omega nature was acting up. Seeing his Alpha in this state, made his body react naturally. Tony bit his lip so hard to stop himself from groaning that he drew blood. Barely. Tony didn’t realize his eyes had slipped close until he opened them.
And what could Tony say to that? He just politely asked his mother to be left alone. He had some thinking to do.
Agatha walked away, leaving Tony shaking and close to tears. He could not understand how someone who claimed to love the Emperor would not wish for him to have happy marriage with his Omega. His earlier fears of Agatha Harkness influencing the Emperor to send him away, returned. But, this time it was not the shame that made his knees go weak. It was thought of losing the Emperor’s respect and trust and may be a shot at a happy marriage.
“Listen to this!” Clint said. “Now the Prince’s delicate fingers will grind spices and stir metal pots.” His tone indicated that he believed it cannot be done. “Surely that will be done.”
Tony was speechless. He had tears in his eyes. Natasha was not wrong after all. Suddenly Steve moved away. “I know you don’t want this. I hurt you and I am sorry. I will never bother you with this again. I hope this, my feelings, don’t come in between our friendship or the Avengers. I just - ….”
He catalogued these thoughts for later as upon his entry Bucky informed him that he had a few important matters at the court that he must attend to immediately. This was of course followed by Bucky’s cheeky smile with a “You can go see your beloved later.” While Steve had smiled at his friends playful comment, he could not bring it in himself to tell Bucky that actually Tony had rejected him on their wedding night. It was clear as day that he was not happy with this union. Steve had sworn to himself that at least he would give Tony a happy life here, even if it was devoid of marital bliss. Tony was under his protection now.
“By something you mean Steve Rogers.” Or not. Nat was a traitor. She didn’t even pose it as a question. It was a statement.
But the Emperor managed to bowl him over completely. Plus, he wasn’t expecting the Emperor to be the most beautiful Alpha Tony had ever laid his eyes on. Despite the screen dividing them, he had a clear view of the Alpha on the other side, while he was himself hidden. The Emperor was tall, that was the first thing Tony had noticed. The next thing was his eyes as blue as the sky and as clear as the day. He was built like the Greek Gods had crafted him themselves and his beard made his look of authority even more profound.
“Remember, my dear,” she said, “Agatha’s word is law here. Steve has the utmost respect for her. Even I do not compare at times. I was away for almost 15 years of Steve’s life. It was Agatha who nurtured Steve with love and warmth and made him into the Emperor he is today. At times, he may ignore what I say, but, he always follows Agatha’s advice.”
“Did you scare him so bad that he ran away to Long Island?” Pepper asked pulling him out of his thoughts.
The trio stood there and watched as Steve got on small stage that was set up for the performers and sat on the grand piano that was laid out.
“He caught you in his arms! Oh My God that’s so romantic!” May be telling Pepper and Clint was a bad idea. But Tony had to get it out of his mind. Though he did not tell them that he could still feel a tingling sensation where ever the Emperor had touched him.
His mother looked away and quickly wiped her eyes before turning to him again. It was in vain for new tears replaced the old ones. She spoke in a broken, desperate tone. “Then, my dear,” she said as she pulled Tony’s hand into hers. She placed a small copper vial in Tony’s upturned palm.
The important thing namely was his son Prince Anthony Edward Stark who by all means was no way under his control. He was extremely concerned for his future and wanted to marry Anthony off whenever he found the perfect political alliance.
3 hours later Bruce came to the waiting room. He was still in the clothes he wore for the mission, just looking more exhausted and disheveled from before. He had run his fingers through his hair one too many times and going by the state of the corner of his lips, he had been anxiously biting them. He began with a deep sigh, “He is stable mostly. The impact of the energy ball had left a small hole in his upper abdomen area. The blood oozing out of his mouth was a sign of the internal bleeding. They have patched him up and put him to sleep. He needs as much rest as he can get. But knowing Tony that will not last for long.” He finished with a small smile.
“Battlefields aren’t the only places where Empires are built. This marriage alliance – it creates a new bond and strengthens our Empire. This is a new beginning. Thank you, Dear father, may you rest in power my King, for putting me on the right path. Nick, convey my message of acceptance.” By Steve’s tone, it was certain that the matter was not up for discussion. The Emperor had made his decision.
“Let it out, my love,” Pepper said, stopping his hand from wiping at his tears. “Just let it all out.”
“What you say is right, Madam,” Arnim of the House of Zola, another of Steve’s Nobles stepped forward. “But, our question is, why has a ‘lab’ been built for an Omega nonetheless in the Fort? This is an insult to our ancient dynamics.”
The reaction was what he wasn’t expecting. Tony startled and gasped at the manly voice and he probably recognised his Alpha but as fate would have it, as he tried to turn on the stool to look at Steve, he also lost his balance on the step stool. As he was about to fall, it was Steve’s quick battle trained reflexes that led him to catch Tony before he hit the ground.
Tony was shocked. He was beyond shocked. This couldn’t be happening. Tony didn’t know how to handle this. He was not ready.
Tony had spent the entire night before he was to leave for his wedding, carefully packing all his plans, notes and tools. He did not know if he would be allowed to do this after the marriage, but he was willing to take a chance. May be he would be able to hide it in his room? May be, by some miracle the Great Alpha would let him do this if Tony was a good Omega? So he called Pepper for help and before he could fit any of his clothes in, he filled the large boxes with stuff from his lab. The whole process was unsually calming.
What happened next, Steve could not have even hoped for it in the best of his dreams. Suddenly his arms were full of a sobbing Tony, kissing his face all over.
“Unfortunately Nick your loyalty cannot excuse your cruelty.” Steve’s voice was calm yet it was firm. It was like ice. “I have worshiped the ground you walked on Nick for my entire youth. I have seen you win battles on my behalf and behead helpless men countless number of times. This is the first time I have stopped your sword mid-strike. Do you realize why?” Steve questioned.
The Queen looked at Tony with desperation in her eyes. She knew that the King had already made his decision clear. They had also received an acceptance from the Great Emperor. She had no option but to convince Tony.
Miss Harkness looked torn as she looked from her God son to her foster son. “He has committed shameful and inhuman crimes. He has tortured Prisoners of war. Promoted subjugation of women and Omegas. When I declared that no prisoner of the war shall be made a slave, he disobeyed my orders again. He has done everything that I abhor, committed actions that I loathe. He has brought dishonour to the Rogers dynasty. I am merely waiting for the official ceremony. As Bruce becomes the Prime Minister, he will be stripped off all his titles.” Steve said in a steely whisper.
“Every time I see you invent something; I feel so proud Tony that I think my chest might burst. Every time you come looking for coffee at ungodly hours, I feel you are the most beautiful thing I’ve ever laid my eyes on. Under this garb of arrogance and self-obsession, you think you are an abomination but every time I look at you, all I see is a man who is trying his best and who is so perfect that I can never compare him to anyone else. In the past or in the present. You are the only one who stands up to me and drives me crazy. You make me so mad Tony and I love every bit of it.”
It was a 5 day journey to the capital city of Brooklyn from the wedding venue and Tony made it with Pepper at his side along with a few of his guards. Rest of the wedding procession consisted of the Emperor’s family and friends and of course the Great Rogers army. Tony was actually overwhelmed by the amount of official protection he was being given. It was almost triple of what Howard could have bothered with for him.
“So you did not leave because you were angry at me?.” Said Tony, small hope lighting his eyes. Did Steve mention his Omega was beautiful?
Tony had lived in royal palaces all his life and the Starks were known for their grandeur. But, any royal palace that he saw paled in comparison to the Rogers Fort. High walls fortified the royal palaces. The outer façade of the walls were made of red sandstone while the inner walls were built with brick. He noticed the strategically placed watchtowers all along the walls and could see the nozzles of the cannons peeking out through the battlements on the walls. There were evenly spaced embrasures all along the walls which allowed the archers to shoot from under cover in the event of a siege. The huge metal doors were embedded with nails in order to prevent large animals like elephants from breaking in. The whole fort was a strategic and architectural master piece.
He saw Natasha trying to smile reassuringly at him. He saw the courtiers averting their eyes in unease so as to not witness the slight to the Emperor Consort’s honour. Tony bore through it all with his chin raised high and tasted each dish that was presented to him one by one. When he finished tasting the final dish, he looked up at the Emperor. He smiled weakly at Tony but Tony did not have it in himself to smile back.
"Look Rogers I am not sorry for what I did. This conversation is pointless because if during the next mission I see an easy way out, I am going to take it, your orders and plans be dammned." After this he made a quick attempt to side step Steve and make an exit.
"This is the last straw Iron Man. No one cares about you or your childish tantrums. You will follow my orders or I will…."
“Well then just do one more thing will you?” Tony said with a playful smile of his own. “Stop calling me Your majesty. Just Tony will do perfectly fine.”
Tony knew he could not back down now. His interest in the Emperor was as clear as day but that did not mean that he would make the first move. Tony himself was no ordinary Omega. He very well knew how to bring an Alpha to his knees.
No fucking way. Steve never sang in front of anybody but him. What the hell was this about? Tony had to stay and find out. He looked questioningly at Clint and Natasha who were both clearly as confused as he was. They knew nothing about this.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He broke them apart midway, resting his forehead on Tony’s. “Sweetheart are you absolutely sure about this?”
Meanwhile, Natasha ignored another one of Clint's attempts at making money and glanced at Tony. Jaw clenched, fists turning white, holding the chair for support, eyes almost drooping. Still the smug grin was in its place. He looked younger in his grey polo shirt and black jeans. His immaculate goatee adorning his face. However, the face looked far paler than its usual olive.
“Your Majesty?” he heard Agatha’s voice break through his haze of anger. Steve turned a questioning glance towards the woman he called aunt Agatha.
The Emperor turned shocked eyes towards Tony and Tony smiled. He then turned to his Head Chef. “But, Pierre, this feast was to be held in the honour of the Emperor Consort.” Steve could not believe it. This was the first time a royal had to cook their own meal.
“Oh, don’t worry I sent lover boy to take a shower. He was starting to smell worse than the gutter that time in Chicago. I hope you don’t mind” she finished with a smirk. “Why would I mind?” Tony scoffed defensively. “Oh, you know why Stark! No point in hiding it now. At least not from me.”
It was almost time for their departure. Rest of the servants came in and took the large chests filled with Tony’s stuff. The procession to the venue of the wedding was ready to leave at his father’s command. Tony, despite his pleas for being able to ride a horse, was forced to sit in a carriage, along with Pepper, that was to be carried by 4 men. Tony knew for a fact that his mother was crying all the way while his father was ecstatic. Obviously, in a few days he was getting rid of his biggest problem.
His plate was placed in front of the Emperor and the attendants served the food to the other courtiers as the tension in the hall eased. As the Emperor made to taste the ravioli, Tony stepped forward in a hurry.
Steve was broken, but his hope wasn’t and now he was determined to at least make Tony aware of how he had felt all along and a determined Steve Rogers was a very scary Steve Rogers. Bucky’s words not his.
That was how General Fury had placed young Steven on the throne of Eastern America and ruled on behalf of the Emperor till Steve became of age. His main aim was to conquer the whole of the American land like Emperor Joseph Grant had dreamt. The plan was set into motion by sending emissaries to various other provinces, realms and kingdoms in western America under the name of Emperor Steven Grant.
