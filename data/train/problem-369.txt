I flush even redder, my cold pale skin warming rapidly at the closeness of the soldier - I'm not use to such acts of affection.
"John..." I roll my eyes, and sigh, before spiking my collar. It helps. "you're worried." I scoff lazily. "always like you to be, anyway. I'm guessing it's the doctor in you? Hmm? Or possibly even coping? Just wretched, isn't it?" John's face hardens, and his cheeks flush. And now I'm feeling the odd need to say sorry. But before I can he speaks.
Sherlock spat the word ‘people’ out as if it were an antagonizing black mass whose sole purpose was to question his whole purpose and existence.
He knows why he didn’t take all of Sherlock’s memories, knows that he should have just cut and run. He can’t decide if he should go home or stay away. Then again… home. He’s never really thought of anyone… anywhere as home. Sherlock is right, he’ll find a way to end himself, or have himself ended; and it wouldn’t be John’s fault. Except he… he could probably stop it. He could save Sherlock from himself.
Greg gives him a look with just a hint of pity in it. “I remember the first couple days. He didn’t feed last night did he?”
This is another John/Murray flashback chapter. Warnings for rough sex (and barebacking) and not-great sexual etiquette.
I can’t…” John’s skin feels super heated, sweat slicked and burning where the Dominus is touching him.
The Dominus’ eyes flash and his nostrils flare. “Not more than you can take, and only if you deserve it. Fold that,
You could tell him to open his mouth. Just say the word, "Open." And he'd look up at you then, lick his lips. You would want to look at his eyes, but you'd be watching his lips, the way his tongue lingers just a little. Like he's daring you to make him, but he wants to… and you'd have to do something about your trousers. Open your fly, push the cloth out of the way, all while looking at that tiny dark space between his lips.
John sighs and opens the tube, frowning at bit at how empty it is. “Better hurry, before I decide to just fuck my fingers and leave you in the cold.” John smears his fingers with a probably-not-enough-but-it-will-have-to-do glob of lube and swipes them over his hole before pushing in. He inhales sharply at the way his nails feel against the abused skin but pushes further and groans. “Fuck, that hurts… fucking spit is not lube, Murray.” He pushes deeper and works the lube in as gently as he can.
Murray sets to work on a messy ball of stitches that will, in theory, hold the fabric around the button-hole together, before cutting one of the buttons from John’s thigh pocket.
Murray pulls back, swiping his spit-slick fingers over John’s fist and cock before taking hold of both of John’s ankles and holding his legs apart.
His cock is already mostly hard by the time John flicks out his tongue out to taste the tip. Sherlock closes his eyes and lets his head fall back as John takes him into his mouth. “Oh god, I’ve missed this.” John hums around Sherlock’s cock and sucks him deep into his throat.
John refuses to rise to the bait, not even so much as a twitch of the paper. Sherlock can picture him on the other side of his fragile barrier: lips tight, eyes pressed shut waiting for the punchline. Sherlock waits until John is forced to turn the page of the paper or give up all pretense of reading. “I can’t picture you naked.”
John follows the tug, stumbling as he adjusts to the Dominus pulling him across the room. He doesn’t balk when they enter the Dominus’ bedroom, not even when they angle away from the bed towards a frame of steel bars and suspension chains. His hands are released and repositioned over his head, maglocks engaging with the chains. His collar is attached to a shorter chain, forcing him to stand on tiptoe.
Sherlock had missed that too, John had glossed over it, and really it was at least partly the drinking. Sherlock didn’t need to know the whole story. John told the lie that replaced the truth, he’d taken Harry’s phone and secreted Clara away. He’d placed her under the protection of a friend of his from
“Need to taste you, good little soldier.” The Dominus pulls free from John’s mouth, and hauls John to his feet, hands wrapped around John’s wrists.
I love each and every one of you, thanks so much for reading... I seem to have worked out a timeline, so maybe... I don't know if we are going to do the thing. canon divergence... it's what's for dinner.
With the warm prickle of pain still hovering on John’s shoulder, he can’t bring himself to speak. He isn’t entirely sure whether or not he would agree with his Dominus, even if he could find the words.
John looks down at his feet, fighting the heat of embarrassment he feels crawling up the back of his neck. “No. At least I don’t think so.”
“No… you’ll be fine. Better. Lestrade will watch out for you. If I stayed I’d be the one to kill you… eventually.”
Murray’s hand is hot against the short cropped stubble of John’s hair as he holds John’s skull against the door, holding him tight even as he backs away enough to flip John around. John’s moan is cut off when Murray’s hand covers his windpipe, just enough pressure that John is gasping, mouth open and something that isn’t sound escaping his lips.
. ‘I prefer women, Dominus.’ I see the truth now.” The Dominus licks John’s shoulder, chasing a trickle of blood. “You’re anemic, more leafy greens for you, young man.” He laughs into John’s skin as John tries to both press forward into the Dominus’ hand and back onto his cock.
John hums around Murray’s fingers and sucks harder, a spike of pleasure shooting through him. Gregson’s not really… John doesn’t think Gregson would do it, but he can imagine Murray pushing his head down onto Gregson’s cock, John choking on it.
John wets his lips, turns his head away from Sherlock. “There’s not much to tell really. My... I guess you’d call it a grandfather, was a dragon... well... yeah... he was a dragon. Demanded a lot of virgin sacrifices. This was maybe eighth or ninth century, well it depends on how you count time... anyway he didn’t eat
delicious, you taste like sand and fire, and how much you love having my cock in you. Greedy. Little. Soldier.” Sharp hard thrusts for punctuation, squeezing John’s cock to bring him back from the edge.
John wakes, not on the debris strewn floor of an abandoned school, but on a comfortable cot in a bright white cell. Memories of the Dominus, being shot, captured and given his choice fill in the gaps between then and now.
Sherlock retracted a little, a tiny tremble, minor hesitation in his confidence, but definitely noticeable. He’d forgotten. How could he be so stupid and mention war when John had lived it. This was supposedly an opportunity for a new friend, the only friend and he had blundered it already.
John and Sherlock stood outside Scotland Yard, looking up at the spire of metal and glass. Sherlock wanted to buy cigarettes to celebrate but John would not let him. Instead they stood humbly outside the stress filled building. John looked to Sherlock and stated, “full confession.” Sherlock nodded. “I still don’t really understand the actual act it self?” Sherlock now looked down at his friend, “nurse wife wanted husband out of smuggling game that Eleanor dragged him into, she went round there to confront Eleanor to get him out of the game, Eleanor probably brought up the fact some way or another that they were sleeping together thinking that the wife knew the fact or it was a way to get back in the argument, wife was angry, understandably, acting out of anger and a way to completely scare Eleanor out of her life she probably made her submit, bound her, stripped her down, probably made certain threats and Eleanor died from fear itself. Weak heart, it’s probably genetic. She never meant to actually kill her, just terrorize her, so she panicked, left the body for someone else to find, ironic that it was the man that connected them.” John stepped back to now look at Sherlock straight rather than from the awkward side angle, “brilliant.” Sherlock smiled. “221b?” John nodded, “221b.” So a taxi was hailed and as they climbed in John said, "Sherlock I was thinking about Eleanor's bee hives."
Sherlock’s entire body was swaying and you could tell he really had to try and concentrate on whatever John was saying, to the point where his mouth was agape with the effort. “The best sex, the best sex I’ve ever had, hm, I don’t know, somewhere, with someone. I’ll just drink John, coz’ honestly I cannot even, I just I mean.” Sherlock then proceeded to down his entire drink, which was practically full. The sight made a very drunk John chuckle. On finishing said drink, Sherlock put his plastic cup down on the moveable tray, wiped his mouth and said, “you John? What (* hiccup *) what about you?”
The honey coloured drams were sat in front of them in no time at all, as Sherlock lifted it and sniffed at its contents, John downed the whole thing in one. "Another please" he gushed, turned out the barman spoke fluent English. A second dram sat in Johns hand whilst Sherlock swirled the first. Sherlock was right about one thing, John did indeed need whisky. "Your theories," John said, and it wasn't the whisky that was the only thing that was harsh, "they're all bollocks."
“Sherlock, thank you, what you have said has been indeed helpful. Would.. would you mind awfully if you showed me your forearms?”
John needed to get it. He was fast so he did. However this was delicate. Sherlock was not of the delicate sort. He could only dive in and hope he wouldn’t drown.
Anderson practically jumped, “alright, alright.” He pulled it out his pocket and Lestrade grabbed it and sprinted back down the corridor, leaving Anderson bemused and the rest of Lestrade’s colleagues in humour but unconcerned.
John turned round his whole body to face his friend, his face was in anguish, "Sherlock that would have been too soon after your surgery! You silly bastard!"
Sherlock opened the double doors with both hands in naturally the most dramatic way imaginable. John shortly followed and even though he had a severe determined face, he also had a glint in his eyes. This was it. Him and Sherlock Holmes on a case, literally out to discover and solve the death of a complete stranger. John could practically whistle. They turned and walked down an adjoining corridor, John wondered how Sherlock new where he was going then realised at how stupid that thought was. Of course Sherlock knew where he was going, this is where the dead people went.
There, previously tucked under the fold away was a open suitcase. It was most likely zipped on finding but of course Sherlock was not going to avoid hurting someones privacy in the name of a case, of this scale or any. John knelt down to Sherlock's level, his knees clicking as he did so, "what's in it?" Sherlock using his index and mid fingers pincered several items. "Mostly suits, suits for a large man," Sherlock raised an eyebrow in Johns direction, "there are some pin badges, bearing republican and american flags," Sherlocks sarcasm for the next item was evident, "charmingly there is also a badge bearing guns." John took this one from Sherlock and studied it intently, his tongue touching the roof of his mouth in concentration. Written along the two crossed fire-arms was the saying, "in god we trust." There were several bottles of Glenfiddich whisky and a hip flask, which Sherlock sniffed and practically gagged at. "Confirms alcoholism then," John commented, "just a bit" replied the detective. Sherlock sieved through the remainder of the contents, "socks, Hilfiger; expensive, a gift from someone he doesn't particularly like, given the holes and the smell, pair of shoes, cheap and old, unpolished; man did not care for his feet, a saint-James bible, despite drop in clericalism he clearly didn't completely drop beliefs and..." As Sherlock went to prod the next mundane item, the fabric on the bottom of the case slipped away, revealing a the corner of a large brown envelope.
John goes to get the chess set, but the notice of his bare feet leads to a surprising conversation between he and his patient Sherlock, before chess can even begin.
There were thirteen letters in total. Seven of them were useless, promotional letters from shops or well-known service companies. But the remaining six, they were decisively points of interest. Two were debit card bill expenditure's from the same bank corporation for the last six months, and the residual four were hand written letters. Two in English and two in Mandarin. John and Sherlock split the letters into three each, Sherlock slid the two English letters and one of the bank letters to John to which John spat “you can read Mandarin?!”
What was so once alive in his eyes was now gone. Once so magnetic, his gaze was now something of a distracted child’s, hovering over everything and not truly seeing. In need of something, constantly. The want of a fix was obvious. The tremors were beginning to show in his fingers and his speech was no longer demanding its usual attention. His eyes kept casting to the door, for on the other side Sherlock could return to his safe haven of the fix that would supposedly cure it all. Mycroft had waited for this moment for some time; in fact it’s all he could think about in recent months.
Sherlock was intolerably calm in his response, “Mister Scott, I am a detective on your daughters case, I know it’s late, must be awful for you,” at this statement Sherlock rolled his eyes at John, which made John even angrier about the whole thing. “I just need to ask you some simple questions, were you aware of your daughters professional part of an international object smuggling corporation located somewhere in the East?” John was so furious and ashamed by the whole thing he went to grab the phone off Sherlock, of course Sherlock ignored and simply put the phone on speaker and held it high the air so John couldn’t reach. He tried; he really did, at one point John even jumped in his attempt to end this embarrassment.
Sherlock removed his hands from John’s face and swiftly walked into the building, almost pushing Anderson over as he went. John stood a bit dumbfounded before shaking it off and saying to no one other than himself “right.” He briefly rubbed his hands together, turned and entered into the building just after Anderson, shutting the door behind him.
“I don’t know yet Sherlock, I have a sister who lives in Surrey so I may live with her for a while until I sort something out.”
“You can’t learn everything from books you know Dr. Watson. Or can I in fact call you John?” The sarcasm was clear and the laugh at this point it appears had left John. “Oh but you know that Doctor. I did some research on you John, in my prison car ride on the way over here and you appear to be fairly popular. Congratulations on the sickening blog by the way. You have been to war. You were blown up and shot at and lost colleagues, some of which undoubtedly despite all your efforts and reading and training could not save. And now here you sit in your OCD office in an Edwardian static building with nothing but your druggies and your books and your quaint chairs by the window. Is that why you limp? Because, you don’t have the imagination to return to war? Unfortunately Dr. Watson you are a goldfish in a tedious pond and I refuse to play.”
Immediately John grabbed the two suitcases, did one last sweep around the hotel rooms and then placed Sherlock’s smaller of the two suitcases on Sherlock’s lap. He then attached his own to the hook on the back of the wheelchair and fled the hotel room into the lobby. Once in the elevator, it seemed to take double the time to reach the ground floor. John felt like he had pushed the '0' button a thousand times before the doors finally closed. Watching the numbers count down was more daunting than it should have been. Ground floor arrived and John hastily pushed Sherlock over to the reception and said, “We’d like to pay and check out for rooms 506 and 507 please.”
They sat in a tryst in the Watsons living room, there had been admittedly a lot of silence whilst the kettle boiled, and all appreciated the mug in their hands as it simply gave them permission to be distracted, instead of looking for one that did not exist. After one sip all three said “soooo” at the same time.
Sherlock and John are chasing a case that's taking them across the channel to the French coast. Sherlock's boredom of being in a car causes some bristly discussion.
Once again John didn’t quite agree with the phrasing, maybe he was looking into it all too much. He’d be fine once the excitement had normalized a tad.
Soon reporters started to crowd round the pair, making an escape seem less and less plausible. "Keep walking John," Sherlock urged. They scrambled their way out of the maze of shouts and lenses, and left behind them professional sighs and audible frustrations. John was glad they were not followed and Watson and Holmes found themselves on the beach once more, one clue closer to finding their culprits. They headed towards the only rocky section of the beach, it sat beyond the the point of the bodies temporary resting place, which was still strangely marked out by a now empty white tent and police tape that no longer served a purpose. They obviously just hadn't got round to dealing with it yet. They walked past the tent and with it behind and out of sight it gave John shivers and the hair on the back of his neck began to stand, forcing him to turn around to glance at it's innocent frame whilst continuing to walk forward. The rocks met with the cliff face on two sides, water at another and out stretched sand for its final attachment. The cliff, sand and salt water all sat around the grounded rocks like estranged friends at a dinner table. As they descended upon the historic mass of stone John imagined a child Sherlock exploring similar stones, making deductions and seeing it all interweave together in one cause and ecosystem. At the same age as Sherlock would have done such things, John was probably doing what all normal British kids do. Catching crabs and placing them in a bucket full of salt water, the bigger the crab the better the feeling of inevitable success. Ogling at them the rest of the afternoon to just watch what they did, and how they interacted with one another. You'd maybe even place sand or seaweed in the bucket to make it feel 'homely,' even though essentially you'd cruelly imprisoned them when their natural habitat sat agonisingly behind the brightly coloured plastic. Then the sun would sink lower into the sea and mum would say, "release the crabs" and they would either be lobbed back into the ocean or lovingly returned back to the very rock pool they had been plucked from, dependent on character and time albeit. The nostalgia caught John out as they slipped amongst the stones, trying to not get their shoes too wet, "Sherlock have you ever caught a crab?" Without turning round Sherlock said bluntly, "what a ridiculous question." John laughed, he didn't expect any less of a reply. "Well that must be rectified immediately" he joked, "John we are looking for anything murderers may have dumped, and potentially washed ashore, like a murder weapon for example, it's a slim chance but..." John interjected in the same jovial manner he apparently didn't want to let go of. "Blah blah blah blah blah, Sherlock Holmes, I am not listening to anything you say until you catch a crab." Sherlock was beginning to admire the humorous stubbornness that was John Watson. Of course he'd never say that, "John what is the point in terrifying a defenceless crustacean to hold for a moment before releasing it back to Poseidon?!" John hopped from one stone to another so they stood side by side, facing one another before John spouted a genuine, "because it's fun."
People love to watch trauma. When humanity is stripped down to what really matters, death, love, sacrifice, gore, we cannot help but stare. It’s like witnessing a car crash, it’s horrible and we know that the whole time in that moment, yet we cannot peal our nosy little eyes away from it. We all want a piece of trauma because it is what we fear the most. John in this moment was the car crash. To everyone else on this plane, he may be the man who could not save his friend from death. To everyone staring at him, this man they see before them is about to lose everything. The man who never did enough. The people on this plane will never know the outcome of these two men’s story, but they will envision the worst. It is our nature. We envision the worst and stock it up in our long term memory in the hope that if this happens to us in the future, we will either do better, or at least cope better, but ultimately survive. To everyone else on this plane, John was just as dead as Sherlock.
John made a little nervous giggle before taking Sherlock’s King, and thus winning their short game of chess.
John stood dumbfounded and had no clue what to do. He heard Sherlock run back up the stairs to practically shout like a child who had just heard an approaching ice cream van, “John! Come on, we have a murder to solve!”
"Arrivée," spoke the driver nonchalantly, not realising the peril John felt himself under. "Ah right." John paid the man and left, without a thank you. After all the man may have just delivered him to his death. John tapped the button on his phone, awakening the screen. It had been half an hour since the call. "the heart made out of skulls" he uttered under his breath. Visiting here was always something John had wanted to do, something on his bucket list, never under these pretences did he think he'd be doing it. It was a small green building in an island of a ring road that John was headed for. There was a queue of maybe twenty people, all waiting in line to see one of Paris's top attractions. John faced the back of the line, checking his phone like a nervous tick. He grabbed a leaflet from someone handing them down the line by the entrance, it had several different languages, English sat underneath French; 'It is estimated that the remains of six million people lay down the catacombs.' It must be pretty big, two more would make no difference, thought John, as he entered a ticket booth. He paid his way and headed to the stairs marking the descent into the crypt. It was a long winding staircase, and the excitement of those around him made John feel like he was in some sick horror film. The deeper he found himself, the more ill he felt. At the bottom he felt his stomach flip and the darkness ahead did not help. For around twenty minutes John walked, down shallow and thin corridors made of stone, it was a mining shaft originally, the cause of which found the mountains of skeleton remains, John let people walk quickly away from him and he walked fast to get away from the previous group, suspicious they were after him. He was provided with small comfort by the fact that he now only had one choice; to go forward. His feet propelled in a crunch of stone, unafraid, however the rest of him wanted to turn and run.
“I know all that already, John trust me on this, I am not a normal person, my mind is leagues above everyone else. Don’t take it personally. I think you should skip to nearing the end of what the program holds. Introduction is most unnecessary. What do I need to do to not be on cocaine again, give me the secret my brother has paid the fortune for. What is it?”
Lestrade struggled with the scanners and the doors but he finally made it back to the window room at the very end and he found thankfully a very calm scene. He sighed in relief and exhausted. Fucking Sherlock.
The taxi rounded to a halt and shocked Sherlock from his thoughts. "Nous sommes arrivés." Sherlock threw him about a hundred euros, it was all the notes he had, and left the taxi with purpose. He so hoped he was in the right place. Sherlock was not going to wait in that queue. He pushed his way to the front and used his fake ID that him and John had used on the docks to get aboard the Cleopatra. "British Police, my constable is in danger. And call the police!" He was allowed through and he moved as swiftly as he could down the windy staircase, shouting 'MOVE' as he went at the top of his lungs. There was an overweight tourist upset at the pace they was forced to go. Once in the catacombs, Sherlock did not take in his surroundings. He knew there was only one way through this maze, and it was from entrance to exit. All he could hear was John's name over and over again in his head, beating as fast as his heart. He moved through the maze of bones and forced his way past anyone dawdling. Where could someone hide here. Through a connecting corridor, he came across a striking sight. Skulls shaped into a heart. There were about four people snapping photographs of it. It made Sherlock's stomach churn. Something was telling him to stop. To the left of the mound of bones the skulls were formed in, there was a dark space, like a shallow  gangway to somewhere else. Sherlock was pulled in. He had to duck to watch from banging his head. At the end of the darkness, was a barrier, a rope connected to each side of the wall. I guess this was a point that tourists were supposed to turn back. There was a light flickering further ahead, he could not tell if it was flame or electricity. He followed it and a pathway with the same dirt floor and stone walls led to an opening ahead. The floor was upset, recently disturbed and Sherlock felt the hairs on his neck stand. He could feel that what lay ahead was exactly where he was supposed to be. The doorway opened to a large circular room. Bones were piled in a circular fashion, like a column supporting the roof in the center.
“Michael Elliot Scott, Eleanor’s father, he signed his name at the bottom of the letter, odd considering it’s to his daughter, but maybe they weren’t as close as its content suggests. Could be habit, generational thing. John get the yellow pages.”
if they were sitting at a table this would have been the moment that John would kick him under said table to encourage him to behave. John looked at Olivia once more with an apologetic face and said without any irony, "sorry he's just a massive dick." Olivia giggled nervously. Sherlock gave them both a disapproving look before they reassigned themselves to focus in silence once more. They were more active this time however, daintily John checked if anything lay in the victims trouser pockets whilst Sherlock checked the jacket. There was no jewellery besides a single thin gold chain that hung around the neck, out of sight behind the shirt collar. Sherlock made an assessment of it on the body and before taking any further action asked "Detective Chalmers have you taken pictures of the victim?" Olivia made an audible swallow before saying a quiet "yes, at several intervals." Sherlock gave a polite, if not assailable, "good," John offered a look of praise any how. With that Sherlock removed the chain from the victims neck and looked at it closely, then spoke to himself more than John, "the chain has lasted well in the water, meaning it's real gold, the stamp you would see to confirm this has been removed, suggesting an alteration or two, most likely in length, Delaney wanted a smaller chain, however instead of going out and buying a shorter chain he had this one resized, repurposed, meaning that he liked this chain, it was most likely a gift or a hand me down from a dead relative, or maybe it was just something he bought and really liked for it symboled a time of personal prosperity, American market, bought in East America, I would say at time of purchase a chain such as this was at least eight-hundred dollars, so at the time he had cash, serious cash, enough to justify spending" Sherlock stopped looking at the chain and looked down at the body once more, eyes scanning were jewellery would be, "no other jewellery, maybe he didn't like it, chain suggests otherwise, but there also isn't a watch, either he did not like things on his hands or wrists, thought it annoying, it's been lost at sea, or maybe he lost a lot of money and had to sell it all."
“Sir we will not be able to use your rooms for the next week as it was booked for all of that time, we will have to charge you for all of that booked time.”
“Oh right yes” John blushed slightly, “erm, they are fairly sporadic, I guess depends when she works.” Sherlock continued to pace, “And the anomaly?”
Sherlock, John and Anderson have just entered the victim's Hampstead flat, and they begin their initial deductions on who may have been the killer. Anderson really is useless.
“Okay statistics alone John it is a man, and besides if you were going to write a letter to me about the death of someone you care enough about to write said letter, wouldn’t you be as neat as possible?!”
As they turned the street to the station there were approximately thirty or forty reporters alongside which were their camera crews and their equipment. They were all pacing and attempting to prepare themselves at the start line of the competitive race that was journalism. As a few saw Sherlock Holmes walking towards them they began their sprint. "Mister Holmes! Mister Holmes! Tell us about Delaney! Who did it? Any theories Mister Holmes? Mister Holmes, one comment please!" Sherlock said nothing and swiped passed them all without even a glance. John could barely see from all the cameras flashing and the noise was unbearable, John could hardly think. He was just glad no one was shouting his name. They rounded into the police station and were met with some relief. Detective Chalmers was particularly excitable and voiced so, "Thank god! They won't leave! Maybe tell them something so they go away, the noise is ridiculous." Sherlock didn't even say a morning before his questioning began, "anything new from the autopsy?" Everyone in the office, including the old owl eyed man who claimed that he was off to report them the last time they saw him. John gave an apology smile in his direction. It was met with a blank unremitting gaze. "Everything as you said Mister Holmes," chimed Olivia like a true professional, "it was amazingly one hundred percent accurate, everything you said, the stab wounds and the shirt still had detergent in the awkward places," Olivia blushed slightly, but it didn't avail her, "he had alcohol in his stomach, we don't know what kind, we have had no need for an autopsy here for over eighteen months, equipment for such things is therefore a waste of budget, but it smelt so and it was the only thing in his stomach, he had no bruising or other marks of any kind, here." Olivia produced a thin folder with images of the dead man resting on a metal table they had in the small hospital clinic not far off the beach. Sherlock didn't even look, he simply passed the folder onto John, of which John opened it and flicked through the grim stills. Olivia continued, "the doctor who inspected him believed he had been dead for only a day." Sherlock had what he needed so he moved it along, "and the interviews?" Olivia was confident in her swift reply and Sherlock acknowledged her as competent and therefore probably had a bright future, a rare conclusion from the allusive detective, "there were sightings of a boat, a fishing vessel saw a boat with the name 'Cleopatra,' of which we know was belonging to a James Williams, Mister Williams reported it missing around midday yesterday." Sherlock interjected, getting excited about the progress of such a case, "how big is it?" Olivia smiled, happy to bear good news, "it's one of the largest and finest boats in all of Minehead." With that she walked towards a board on the wall and pulled off an image of a boat, she placed it in Sherlocks hands. Deductions began bouncing around the detectives cranium. It was what's known as a Ketch sailboat. Two large white sails and one smaller sail at the back, making three sails total. It was forty-five foot long. Big enough for what had violently occurred, potentially not enough floor space for more than three living people. So two murderers, and the victim, most likely murdered on the boat, alcohol on an empty stomach would have made self defence difficult, even more so when against two sailors who stole the bloody boat in the first place. The mahogany planks to build the vessel informed Sherlock it was most likely built in ninteen-fifties Italy. 'Cleopatra' was written in a bold green paint along her flank, Sherlock imagined it may have been removed in an attempt at anonymity or precaution from the fleeing criminals. Shame. Sherlock admired it's artistic nature, a racing green with a white outline. Sherlock handed the print to Watson who raised his eyebrows and blew a short impressed whistle, which received a stare from everyone in the ageing office. Sherlock pushed up onto his toes before proceeding to inform all of the strangers, "right, we're off now, lovely case, thanks for the email." With that he headed for the door and John shrugged and followed, "wait Mister Holmes!" was all Olivia could muster, another officer followed suit, "you haven't solved the case? Where the bloody hell are you going?!" Sherlock spun around for the second time today, "we're going to catch the murderers." With that the two men were out the door, un-followed by the now stunned out of depth police team. John had files in hand and thankfully had placed the boat image behind the others, otherwise the reporters outside would have had a field day and it would have been a huge cue to the criminals to get a move on. The shouting continued just as before, "Mister Holmes! What did they tell you? What did you tell them? Mister Holmes, who killed Paul Delaney, is it anything to do with his racist connections? Fellow politician? Why was he here Mister Holmes?"
Sherlock swallowed hard, he hadn’t thought so much as to the deliverance, the prevalence of his wording had never been very important to him. He reeled deductions and was inconsiderate with most. But not with John.
Anderson hobbled through a doorframe from another room with a stack of papers in his hands looking admittedly dazzled. He gave them to John and Sherlock, Sherlock made no acknowledgment of Anderson’s efforts but John at least said thank you. Just before they all left Sherlock ensured Anderson had the originals, otherwise fingerprinting would be useless, when Sherlock was happy they departed in their normal manner and Sherlock hailed a taxi for John and he, with a step closer to the cause of Eleanor’s death.
‘Fuck, FUCK!,’ was all John could think. ‘You fucking idiot! You were dreaming! That was a dream! You fucking idiot,
With that the two men turned at the same time and headed for Angelo’s in the hope that the place still remained.
The driver didn’t bother turning road but looked in his rear view mirror whilst asking, “Where are you two lovebirds going then?”
As Sherlock began to be carried down the aisle, with the whole plane gawking at him, John could not help but shout, “his head needs to be up! He’ll choke on his own blood! Keep it up!!” With no reply, John just watched his only friend in this whole fucking country get further and further away from him. Once he was satisfied that he would make it off this plane, John collected his and Sherlock’s possessions. Their two suitcases, both of whose contents had been practically untouched. He caught no ones eye and the whole plane was in silence. You could hear a pin drop. John then took a deep breath and as he walked down the aisle, closely following behind his bleeding friend, he was aware of every single set of eyes on him.
“I hate this job, day in day out people come in here smelling of alcohol or sheer uncleanliness because drugs have consumed them to the point that they don’t wash. And by the time we get to the bottom of it, the cause of all their troubles, it is always their parents, always! And then you, you Sherlock, you walk in, and it’s about your mind, the thing that runs the whole show, and I have never seen someone be so fine being taken off drugs, normally people are catatonic for a week, but one day in you are deducing these incredible things, if you are this way during cold turkey I can’t imagine what you will be like at one hundred percent! And you know what Sherlock, I want to see it! I want to see you running the streets of London solving murders. But most of all Sherlock I want to run with you! I want to see it all, I want to do things as important as what you do and you do it every day! Sherlock can I ask something of you? I completely understand if you say no…”
John wheeled Sherlock up along side a row of chairs before seating himself down, and together they stared at the board, saying nothing. Waiting for their gate to come up. Their flight was due to leave soon, why was it not up yet? After eight minutes John was convinced something had happened, this was somehow a trick, a way to get them to believe they were finally going to definitely live before BAM! and the carpet would be ripped out from beneath them and they would be back in those cells and this time they would make John watch whilst they tortured Sherlock. Once more John was finding it exceedingly difficult to breathe.
Sherlock laid these out too, surrounding the central papers which appeared even more complicated. Once he was happy with their positioning, he stepped back to John's level of distance. He put a twitchy hand to rest on its opposing ribcage and resting his elbow on the now barred arm. He nibbled on his thumb and blinked hard in concentration, eyes never moving away from the papers. John just watched and waited patiently, patient for whatever bombshell was about to be brilliantly dropped.
“Lestrade, I have finished my treatment and am clean.” Sherlock pointed one now open hand in John’s direction without breaking eye contact with Lestrade, “This is my doctor and new colleague Doctor John Watson. He is a military doctor and a man smarter than any of your officers. I have trust in him, so he is with me. I will not be without him from now on. Your concern with my brother is false, I am better, John will assert to that. Now Eleanor Scott...”
Despite this, all John could conclude was that he wanted it; he wanted Sherlock, in his entirety. John’s final thought before casting his eyes down on his unconscious and un-kissed friend, ‘oh, why couldn’t that have been real.'
John attempted to bring him back. “Sherlock, what’s wrong? Was it something I said?” Without changing his gaze or his stature, Sherlock responded, “two things actually.”
The bag was lifted from his head and he was indeed very alone. His eyes adjusted to the light and he was in a small room with white walls and a concrete ceiling. Alarmingly there was a grate in the corner of the room and the floor sloped towards it as if blood needed to be easily cleaned from this floor. This room had clearly been designed for torture. John felt as if he was going to faint. Where was Sherlock? He said this was a tactic and they wouldn’t hurt him but it severely felt like the detective was wrong. If this was just a threat it was loaded and primed. His entire body shook with fear, and the two men encircled him, assessing his weak points. They spoke to each other in their foreign tongue, but even if it was in English there was no way John would be able to understand for the fear had ravaged his brain. John could only watch wide eyed and shaking like a baby deer trapped in a barbed wire fence.
“I assume you mean the harder stuff, not cannabis which practically every simple minded person has taken. I took codeine pills to begin with, but the side affects were irritating and didn’t aid with my thinking, I began to experiment, meth was pedantic and unreliable, Diamorphine was good for a while but it relaxed me so much that I found myself unable to run around cases, Ketamine followed but the paralysis in the crash was in the least a nuisance, then I reached Cocaine.”
“It must be a close relative, otherwise they wouldn’t know or care enough to think it a suspicious death.”
“Mr. Holmes my name is Doctor Watson, I’ll be the one overseeing your treatment.” John’s outstretched hand hung in the awkward air and Sherlock did nothing but scowl at the sight of it. John put it back by his side and chuckled out an “I assume that this wasn’t your choice then. Don’t worry most people don’t have a choice. Then again you are not most people Mr. Holmes. Follow me if you will.”
There really was not much John could do. He frantically buckled himself in, checked Sherlock was strapped in to, which he was, and then he bandaged his head in the most haphazard way possible, but it would do for now. All who could see were gawping at the near hysterical Doctor. Sherlock was still breathing but it was minimal, minute sort of hiccup breaths. He needed his throat unblocked and open as soon as possible. John looked into the tiny green box with the smallest amount of supplies. He could use a syringe, remove the needle and suck out the blood from the back of his throat, but on a plane that’s about to land such intricate work was dangerous. The straws could also be used as suction, somehow, (John had done something similar to this in Afghanistan, he saved a mans life with nothing other than a straw and a small knife.) But, again it was too delicate. Not only did he need his esophagus unblocked, he needed surgery to cease the internal bleeding and to let him breathe. John knew the surgery would be invasive and would mean that Sherlock would have to stay in hospital for a few days. For the remaining three minutes of the descent John did the best he could, watched Sherlock nervously and held his head so that there was no chance he’d choke on his own blood.
I gasp in slight panic, reluctant but desperate, sinking into his hold despite how humiliated I am - I'm in pain and I need him.
Meanwhile John and Lestrade song joyously to the music. I never knew a soldier could sing so wonderfully. And Lestrade wasn't too bad either.
John's face tightens. "You're right." he says with a deadpan expression, "You're not dead yet." He steps in and shuts the door. I can already sense what's coming - the tension - the impending climax. "Sherlock..."
The cab stops. "Speaking of cases. Where here!" I pounce out of the cab, before it barely even stops moving. "John, hurry!" I fish into my pocket, I'm short of change, so I pay the cabbie more what I have. I spike my collar, swaggering off towards the crime scene. "Come, John. The game is afoot."
Mycroft steps closer, and simply replies, "you're right.' he adds, rather suddenly, "as you're mine."
Immediatly her face tightens, and her cheeks redden - she's blushing. Obviously. "N-no, Sherlock..." She sighs regretfully, "...I'm sorry."
I push pass him, swaggering through, John accompanying me, as we advance further into the crime scene. We stop.
In a matter of moments my heart skips, my cheeks pale, and my face goes cold. I'm appalled. Inferior. Pitied.
"It means it's time to stop pretending that this is healthy, and face reality. the doctors have diagnosed him brain dead, yet still..." the ginger waves an idle hand in the formless air around them, "here we are."
"But...I've never...really been...all to sure...about it." His cheeks darken with blush. I told him to bring his coat, but he insisted he wasn't cold. Now he's catching a cold. He clears his throat. "Hah... I'm no detective."
"John..." I breathe, "um... Listen... I.. em.. " I slouch, before inhaling deeply. "John..." I look to him, this time prepared to tell him. "I want to do one last case."
A machine amongst humans. Fortunate enough to find forgiveness, despite all that it has done, and will do.
"John I.. I just wanted to thank you." My cheeks fluster with warmness. I can't do it. I clear my throat, now looking out from the window. I've got to focus. Caring is not an advantage. "I know... Probably not the best 'thank you' you've ever gotten; but.. still, nonetheless, an honest one."
My eyes roll instinctively. "the excessive effort you put into making this..." I gesture to my words, "convenient."
His heart - its like a wild horse- galloping through the wilderness, bucking at the walls of his chest, sorely - he's afraid.
I know I'm a hassle. I know he struggles - managing to take care of me, Rosie, bills, medical expenses - it's not easy. Never is.
Jubilant cheers snatch me back to reality, Mrs Hudson giggling, birthday horns, and a cake held up to my face.
And suddenly I'm looking right at him, but he won't look up to me. Now he's the one avoiding eye contact.
The next day was rather challenging. I couldn't breathe without an oxygen mask. And when I wanted to be alone, I kept getting visitors.
"John, I um..." I say, voice trailing off like a fading brain wave. He looks to me. I'm unnerved. "I.. um.. I just wanted to say..."
He pants desperately, "Sher-sherlock, you s-saved me." His nails dig slightly dig into my flustered skin. "Let me return the favor."
Seeming careless may seem cruel, but ultimately it will spare me, as well him, the trouble of not being.
With those words we leave, and head outside. On my way out of Bart's I begun to think.  It's just...
I part my lips, readying to explain my true intentions for taking the case, but a sudden knock disrupts me. I blink, feeling rather guilty. "Would you mind?"
In delight or shock or god knows what Sherlock jumped up from his seat to his bare feet “John, John! You’re not limping!”
There were still signs of police all over the apartment. There were numbered pointers everywhere, and yellow tape over some of the doors. Sherlock ignored all of it. He swooped around the place like a bat in its cave. Blind but able to see everything. He mainly used his eyes and this tiny pocket microscope, but Sherlock also did… weird stuff. He would sniff items occasionally and even lick some things about the room. He was like a tornado tearing around. Or Taz the devil. Whirling about, making deductions and decisions about the murder and the victim and the person’s life and the police involvement. He was a spider spinning a most elaborate web. Anderson would pretend to look busy, but really he wasn’t thinking about anything useful. John meanwhile was busy looking through the books upon the shelves. Sherlock eventually joined him once he’d given the room a once over.They stood side by side facing the shelves. Arms crossed, deep in thought. “Initial thoughts John?”
John stood for what felt like a too long a time, he stretched out his body and Sherlock noticed the slight painful twitch when John rotated his left shoulder. Must have been where he was shot. To take him out of the army it must have been pretty bad. The limp really was psychosomatic. Then something amazing happened. As John walked to get the papers he spoke of he didn’t limp. He walked straight and thorough.
This meeting had been pre-arranged, these two were the owners of the dock and managed its daily comings and goings. Sherlock spoke to them as if he knew them well, "Bonjour, it is a pleasure to meet you," Sherlock let go of John's hand and removed his I-D card from his coat and flashed it in their direction, a little bit too flamboyantly John noted. John did the same, without such drama, the local pair leaned closer, making the boat creak, to inspect the cards, and in approval they nodded and handed them back. The chap took a long drag from his cigarette before saying a word, in albeit an incredibly strong accent, "Bonjour, oui, we know ooo you are, the er two agent de police from London non?" John nodded and spoke confidently, "yes, that is correct, we are investigating the murder of Paul Delaney? Heard of him?" Both shook their heads and Sherlock took the initiative, "he was a very important man and he was found dead merely days ago, we believe this to be the very boat the people who murdered him fled on," there was an awkward pause and the four of them stared as if in a wild western waiting for someone to break peace. Sherlock said in a painfully cheerful tone, "mind if we hop on deck?" If they weren't trying to be in disguise John would have undoubtedly wiped his brow and sighed until there was no more air in his lungs, instead he smiled so wide that his cheeks ached. Those already on board merely shrugged and Sherlock 'hopped on deck' and then went to great pains to help John on in the most touchy-feely manner imaginable. John could feel his ears go pink, Sherlock needed to reign it in. John gave Sherlock a stare that said it all before returning to his act. Sherlock cleared his throat and then began his deductions whilst John asked the questions, "can you describe the people who brought this boat to dock?" The woman finally spoke now, her voice much deeper than expected, "There were three, et they were all men, how'd you say, er, they were dressed far too smart to be sailors, ai-je pas dit que?" She asked the question to her french companion, who nodded in answer, "I said it to him at the time, alle, they all looked er similar, like they could sibling, pardon, could be brothers non," John intervened, honing in on something particular, "what did they look like?" She continued, "ah oui, all blonde, quite grande, big gentlemen, not gros, er, not fat, opposite," John was getting excited now, "what were their accents?" She was momentarily confused, he took another drag, "where did it sound like they were from?" She understood, "L'Americaine, for definitely, l'Americaine." John felt triumphant, they were getting somewhere, three Americans potentially related to one another, "did they say where they were going?" Before the lady could answer Sherlock shouted from inside the boat cabin, "John! I think I found something."
“Off record?” Sherlock nodded. “I think your brother, whilst an important man, he is a giant dickhead.”
John placed a clenched fist to his chin. “Well read, intelligent, likes crime novels and photography. So potentially a bit of an adrenaline junkie?”
John opened the door and said “Sherlock this place is unbelievable! I simply won’t be able to afford it, any of it, I was so excited by the trip and focused on the case I forgot about the financial side of it all…” Sherlock stopped him there and said “John please this is for the case, I have an account set up for professional spending’s, we work together now, we just both use the account, if we make any money from the work we just feed it back into the account. We are here for the work, cost isn’t an issue but the case is. If we live we solve cases, so we simply pay to live and solve, that's all.” John nodded, it did make sense, and they would make money from this case, anonymous said so in their letter.
John began to laugh, unashamedly so, he could now completely understand why Sherlock thought Anderson was useless. After his giggle he said to Anderson “I think if Eleanor could hear that now she would tell us to open her bloody mail if it pointed in the direction of who killed her. And anyway, even if the contents were embarrassing she wouldn’t be affected because she’s dead.” Sherlock had to bite his tongue from wanting to say “Finally!” He couldn’t believe he had met someone who was on the same page as he was. Ironic that was all his brothers fault really. At this Sherlock handed half of the dozen or so letters to John and at the same time they opened the letters one by one, assessing the contents of each envelope. Anderson stood like a dumb animal unable to do anything but moan about the whole affair. By the fourth letter Sherlock just said “shut up Anderson,” which made John snort, much to Sherlock’s happiness.
Sherlock pushed up his eyebrows as if offended by the idea that John had thought him so stupid, "cannot believe you think i'd never thought of such a thing, I took my  I-V out exactly 12 hours before leaving the hospital so my system is in fact clean."
This made John go a bit tingly, so much so that he stared down at his shoes rather than the faces around him. Molly seemed a bit uncomfortable about the idea, it seems she too was used to the idea that Sherlock was all hers. She attempted to shake herself out of it, “Well nice to meet you John, what, or who, I should say are you looking for?”
“Unfortunately we cannot give you any anti-sickness medicine as some patients do experience hallucinations as a side affect, we also don’t give out sleeping pills if a patient is vomiting in the first night, which you are, unless you have any ideas Sherlock? They say you are a genius.”
He kissed his wife good-bye and followed his friend. Mary watched them walk down the street like two skipping schoolboys.
"John we do this because we are curious in human nature, we do this because I for some reason was born with the capability to solve it, we do this because this man, regardless of his morals and actions had his life cut short by people who think they have the right to not only take the life but also the right to get away with it. I enjoy it John, of course I enjoy it, but who wouldn't when you are discovering every single day what humanity means, I for so long have believed that I am like no one else, as we have discussed even this very morning, and my chase for solving murders and mysteries is partially fuelled by wanting to understand human nature so I can be more a part of it, more a part of the pieces that truly matter John. If I had walked into your office a decade ago I was a shell of myself and we would undoubtedly have not got along, for I got along with no one, but in seeing the true matter in all things, the reality in death despite circumstance over and over again laid out bear, we break that barrier and we see what no one else sees, it is not about us John, well it is, of course it is, we are here for our own reasons, both collective and separate, but it is larger than us, and that more than all is what drives me to keep going, keep thinking and solving and learning and increasingly become better at what I do, at what we now do, together. If you ever lose faith remember that we are making a difference, even if that is to ourselves. I have never worked well with other people, and now you are here John and the world is opening up for me like a book, seeing through you is a tool I never realised I needed, and better than that I actually like you!" John laughed and swayed on his heels, bowled by Sherlock's soliloquy. "His death matters because time itself matters, we can ultimately make ourselves happy, and it is through this that makes me happy, whether that is caused by biology or nurture or a combination of the two, it is what makes me tick, it is the thing that satisfies that panicking part of your brain which screams every morning at you to want to exist despite all the odds. John, you are exactly where you need to be, you are on a boat to France and why the fuck would you want to be any where else." Something had been restored.
Sherlock spun on the spot to once again face John, “which line?” John waved his hands around whilst trying to remember the quote. “Calculated risk, and profit and loss and…?”
“Well, no, it’s an inherent need, I need cases more than I need food and water, and my brain needs something to focus on. If it doesn’t it crumbles and leads me to drugs. It always has, I need a stimulant continuously, and for example if we didn’t have this conversation in the present I’d be doing anything, an experiment most likely, just waiting for the next case. If the gap between cases gets too long, I need drugs just to pass the time eventually. So to answer your question, no I would solve puzzles even if I wasn’t needed making any positive emotion about being needed irrelevant. This can further be proven by the fact that most of the London metropolitan hate having me around, hence why the cases need me more than any emotion around want towards me is there or not.”
Sherlock and John race to Paddington train station to get their train to a case that awaits for them in a beautiful part of the world, Somerset. John makes a romantic error and Sherlock does something which, whilst it benefits the case, it is not necessarily legal...
He couldn’t tell John the real reason. He wanted John to feel safe. He needed John to feel safe around him. If he told him of the sniper and the reason as to why it took two years worth of dismantling a large network all because a bullet may find itself between his eyes. No, no Sherlock couldn’t do that.
John felt his stomach twist and contort beneath his clothes. Nausea rode up his oesophagus as the taxi veered through the city streets. It was a beautiful day, the weather was mild and the sky blue. It did not make enough of a merry distraction however. Sherlock was in a public place, he must look fine to not attract attention, so that meant he must be fine. On the other hand, he might not be there at all, this could so evidently be a trick, underground in a place filled with the actual remains of the dead. He would have no phone service, and if those they are dealing with are as powerful as they both think, then he was in big trouble. Sure it might be a public place, but if they were working with the French government then it could be closed for the day. Open only for John. Leading him down the rat trap like a lamb for slaughter. The more he thought about it, the more obvious it was that this had to be a trick. Why would they want him there for any purpose other than harm? Why let him have Sherlock back? But where was Sherlock otherwise? They had taken his phone for sure, so they had made physical contact. John thought back to the phone call, swelling the words over and over in the hope to better understand them. The car shuddering over a raised cobblestone made his brain jolt. They were American, absolutely American, so that made their theory still on track. Paid assassins travelling to collect their pay. They couldn't kill them too could they? Especially someone with a reputation like Sherlocks. It would blow the whole story open, people at the village in Minehead knew they would both be travelling to Paris to investigate Delaney's death, it would be a great risk for them to murder Sherlock and John. At least that is what John was trying to tell himself.
John swallowed his gulp, "no matter how much you have informed me, from the day I have met you, I have always just seen you as human, not a high functioning sociopath, you have had no labels in my eyes, I've never put expectation or judgement on you or anything you do, I have just let you be you, of course I have helped, you haven't relapsed since we came out of my old place of work, which is great, you have had a lot of cases to deal with, which admittedly I am aware has kept you distracted, but for the most part, you've been good company, I like the work we do, it has given meaning to my life once more, an importance I haven't felt since I was in Afghanistan, you feel the way you do about me, about us, because the whole fucking world has a go at you for being smart, but I haven't, neither does Lestrade, Molly or Mrs Hudson interestingly, and I don't give a fly-ing-fuck what your theories are about it because your whole existence has shaped you to think up theories in the first place, don't be concerned by us and where we are heading, because it is all going in the right direction and is all going to be okay." Sherlock sat stumped, never had anyone been quite so direct with him, John downed the rest of his remaining drink and stood up, Sherlock simply stared at where John used to be, meaning his eyes gazed glued to the wall, John patted Sherlock on the chest with several light thuds before saying, "night, sleep well" and sauntering out, with a little drunken swagger the bartender admired. As he reached the doorway, he swivelled round and yelled to Sherlock, in an otherwise empty bar at three in the morning, "oh and Sherlock give the bartender a tip." And then he was gone.
Murray’s breath is hot on John’s ear, nothing approaching words, just hard sharp sounds of pleasure, his weight pushing John further into the floor until John can feel every crack in the tile under his sleeping bag. Murray’s arms wrap around John’s shoulders, pinning him in place as Murray’s hips surge. Murray comes, filling John with warmth and sound. The long, low groan ends with Murray digging his teeth into the flesh and cloth of John’s shoulder.
I have a whole other chapter in my head about the difference between thralls and familiars. I'm sorry i am trash who never finishes anything. I will try not to take 3 years to write more of this. It is honestly uncomfortable sometimes to write and i don't want to make it apologetic.
“You can fix my trousers. And if you find some lube, you can fuck me in the morning. Now get out and let me sleep.” John gives up trying to hold his trousers up with just the zipper and lets them hang open. He pushes off from the door and opens it to retrieve his doss bag, holding the door open for Murray.
Sherlock strokes his hand over the back of John’s head, pushing up gently to meet John’s mouth with his hips. John’s hand rests on Sherlock’s hip, fingers clench gently when Sherlock pushes against the back of John’s throat. The whole thing is very civilized but Sherlock wouldn’t describe it as gentle. There’s an edge to them, together, especially in Sherlock’s mind, a sharpness that brings blood to the surface of the skin, but never really cuts.
John maintains eye contact as he folds the robe, the edges not entirely lining up but most of the wrinkles smooth out under his hands. He looks away to settle the square of fabric on the coffee table, next to a wire bowl containing apples.
“That’s it. Good boy, you’re mine now.” The Dominus’ hand leaves John’s body and he hears only the wet snap of the glove being removed and tossed on the floor. John’s breathing is loud in his ears, blocking out most of the details around him. John sees the graceful arc of the Dominus’ trousers as they are tossed on the bed, and the second cold splash of lube on his arse is a shock he barely has time to recover from before the Dominus is pushing into him again.
Many thanks again to Consulting Smartass for being the best friend and beta a dirty minded fan writer could ask for
“This was delicious, thank you Mrs. Hudson.” He pops the last bite in his mouth and scrapes the spoon around the bowl, catching stray bits of yogurt before licking the spoon clean.
As soon as John steps onto the treadmill the blank walls begin to glow and the wall closest to him offers a selection of holos. He chooses the old growth forest almost without thinking about it and inhales deeply as the holo flickers and resolves itself into a place he’s never been.
“Only you do.” John’s mouth has gone dry and he’s getting uncomfortably hard in his pants. Because he’s imagining what it would mean to always need more and then have it be possible.
It makes him nostalgic for the early days when it was only a matter of walking onto a field and hacking and slashing at people who hacked and slashed back, ducking a blow that wouldn’t have landed anyway and falling down. Easier to avoid being trampled if he could manage to land face up, the occasional bit of glamour to push charging horses and men away from him. Very rarely, when he thought about it, he would smirk and imagine himself the inventor of the stunt double.
He trembles. "Stop it. Just.. stop it. Okay." He voice cracks mercilessly. "It wasn't supposed to be like this." He croaks, holding me as if I was his only child. "I was supposed to protect you." He sobs hysterically, "I m-made a promise. An-and I br-broke it..." His voice breaks, "and I'm sorry." He break down into tears. "I failed you." Once again his grip tightens. I gasp - my heart doesn't spare me. It hurts. "I failed you, and.. and I'm sorry."
John leans towards me, his elbow resting on the armrest of his chair. "Don't you think they'll at least want to say goodbye?" He asserts, side eying Lestrade, who sits in front of us nodding.
Nonetheless, nothing I do, or any one for that matter, wil make any difference. I'll still be here - sick. Weak. Dying.
John Watson is not just a reason for me to live, but a reason for me to breathe. Breathing is not boring.. Not having a reason to is.
Sherlock can't imagine this being their reality for the next however many years to come- he simply can not. It hurts too much. Too much. John deserves better...
Then a sudden ache hits me - right in the kidney's - it's excruciating - my chest heaves and I snap awake to find I've soiled the couch quite copiously.
"Of course. It tells me you care." I give a confident smile. "Just don't too much. I need your brain as focused as possible. Seeing you'll be learning quite a lot today."
John's eyes become stoic - piercing mine. He's afraid. Yet.. he's determined to hide it. "You've been here for two weeks."
And before I know it my lips are pressed against his- warm, wet, and puckered. Our eyes open slowly, having closed instinctively with the locking of our lips.
John immediately responds, shaking his head, and saying, "no its fine. really." he looks directly into my eyes-blue, deep orbs boring into my mine. I am arrested. "it's... alright."
"Aw, just open the bloody gift, already!" Lestrade presses me, laughing, wrapping an arm around Molly's shoulder. "Trust me.. you're gonna love it."
I am that fortunate machine. Rusted. Dysfunctional. Undeserving of all care, and affection, only to be still graced with it ultimately.
Now met with stares, and silence, my mind urges me to play something else; this time something I've composed.
Great. Now he's looking away, ignoring the obvious tension - It's thick. Heavy. Deeply embedded. I breathe. "John..." I say dully, before breathing out heavily, "problem?"
But I do not protest. I simply groan, and turn as his soft sheet-thin lips peck the puckering skin of my forhead.
John's mouth hangs open. This is his first time actually ever seeing me cry. And his first instinct is to comfort me - his arms now cradling me, he whispers, "it's going to be alright..."
John smiles tenderly, resting a hand on my shoulder. "Shh..." He shushes me, gently leaning me back, til I'm lying flat on my back. "Easy..."
Just then I look up to see none other than John standing over me. His eyes wide, blazing with emotion. Fear. Adrenaline. Disappointment. Never have I seen such fright in a soldiers eyes. Never.
I snicker, but faintly - cheeks slightly warmer than normal - I breathe, "yes. It's becoming a rather common occurrence, don't you think?"
And then my brother joined in, taking a seat at the piano. He had practiced since he was a kid. He was good. Very good. Oh, did I mention he was a show off. Well he is.
Most fear death - I admire it. It's power. It's strength. Yes. It ruins your life, but not as much as worry does.
Mycroft stands his ground- straightening his posture and looking the brunette dead in the eyes. "Are perhaps you are too blinded with guilt to actually see that they aren't?'Sherlock remains silent- no comeback it seems. Simpy tears- cold colorless tears streaming from the pale brunette's sharp-cut cheekbones.
I still remember the day we met. Me leaning over a lab table, experimenting on god knows what, and him subtlety walking into the picture.
John sighs heavily, retaking his seat beside me. "Yes. Sherlock... the night after the shooting, you suffered a heart attack, and as a result the doctors placed you into a medical induced coma." His voice cracks, but he is quick to mend it. "It saved you." I hear what almost seems to be a sniffle. He's been crying...
Suddenly his eyes widen. He's noticed his mistake. "Sherlock... I-i didn't... I didn't mean it like that." He stammers, and fidgets. "Uhm.. wh-what I meant exactly... What I meant to say, Sherlock... was..." He inhales nervously, "you don't need it"
"It's the hit man. I know it." John snarls. "Now maybe you'll think twice before going out for dinner while a crazy contract killer is out on the loose. Hmm?!"
My eyes roll instinctively. "Oh, goodie." I waltz over to the body, then pull out my pocket magnifier. "John." I hand it to him. "Here. Take it."
It grows silent, only for a brief few seconds, before everyone starts to resume their original behavior.
December 25th - Christmas day - a time meant for celebration, and instead here I am, discussing how I want to die with my best friend.
"Well... in these types of cases there is hardly ever any investigations. Most would simply close it as a suicide."
"Morning." I breathe weakly into the oxygen mask- a lackluster smile gently tugging at the corners of my lips, as I run a soft hand over the sleeping soldier's slowly, "John..."
