John surges down, and Sherlock prepares for a deep hard kiss. Instead, John’s lips brush against his sparingly, and Sherlock arches up, chasing his mouth, as John pulls away laughing.
Sherlock allows himself to be helped up, and John’s hand resettles in his, fitting their palms together. He looks up at Sherlock, wide-eyed. “This okay?"
Sherlock shakes his head, giggling. "You're an idiot."
is too small and too mundane, and because it makes you feel good to hear it. It makes you happy.”
Jim huffs a laugh, lays down and stretches out the length of the couch, folds one arm behind his head. "Johnny Boy's the muscle in your little twosome, Sherlock. Don't try. You're not intimidating me." His hand crawls down his stomach until he reaches his groin. He curls a hand around himself and looks up at Sherlock. "If you want to make yourself useful..."
When I emerged into the sitting room, Watson was sitting again in the green chair, just as I had found him this morning. Now he was wearing his most well worn nightshirt and the thick woolen dressing gown Mrs Hudson had made him as a birthday gift. He was reading the newspaper with a cup of coffee resting on his bent knee. The rain cascaded in streaks down the window behind him, silhouetting the perfect upturn of his nose, the thickness of his neck. My mouth watered at the sight of him.
These Watsons. They’re a whole different species.
. “You still haven’t said it, you know.”
"Well, I just assumed - "
“Hullo, Molly.”
“What
“Yes, John. Please.”
“Yeah, come on, then,” John grabbed Sherlock’s hand and pulled them both up to standing. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist and looked up at him, eyes shining. “I love you so much. I’m glad we came here. I’m really looking forward to this - some time, just for us, away from all the shit we have to do at home.”
He disappeared into the bedroom, and I retrieved my own dressing gown, throwing it around my sticky body. I wiped at the leather of the chair with John’s night shirt, and then curled back up in it, loose-limbed and satiated. John returned a moment later, his tongue between his teeth, his hair still ruffled and spiky from my fingers.
“Fucked in an alley after a case with your hand over my mouth again? No. I don’t think I would mind a jot.” John leans down and puts his lips close to Sherlock’s ear, “But if you try that on me at home I’ll remind you very quickly and painfully who’s the dom in this flat.”
“What?” Sherlock spins his head round at her. She winks at him conspiratorially, and raises her eyebrows. Oh. “Yeah, Nan, sorry.”
"What, John?" Sherlock hears how exasperated he sounds. Can't help it. Last night was like a fairy tale. John the knight in shining armour. This morning, it's reality, and even though they're now in this together, Sherlock still needs drugs and they both need food. John can’t save him from starvation through sheer willpower.
“Same every year.”
“A mystery you can’t solve? You really are off your game.” John grins and takes the pipe from him, places it gently on the side table. “Well, we’ll have to grapple with that particular mystery tomorrow, because it’s time for you to get some sleep. Come on, then.”
As he's putting on the coffee and popping bread in the toaster, he remembers to text Greg. Now that Sherlock's fed and rested, they should get back to The Yard ASAP. The potential price of Sherlock's mental stability, the fact that the killer could have struck again while they've been peacefully sleeping, isn't lost on John.
He couldn’t focus. He had no fight left.
"Mmm?"
" John stops kissing him, pulls back and holds him resolutely in those intense eyes.
"Oh, Sherlock! Really! At my age. Bad enough I have to walk in half a dozen times a week to find you two pawing at each other in my foyer..." She swatted at him as she went past, eyes sparkling with amusement even as she tried to look indignantly stern.
Sherlock had been the originator of the plan for tonight, but he was strangely shy about vocalising the actual act. John had asked him multiple times over the week if he was absolutely sure he still wanted to go through with it, and he assured John that he was. Now John petted his hair and they locked eyes. “While we’re cutting each other? Why can’t you say it, Sherlock? You said it once, and now you’re so reticent. We don’t have to do this, love. Tell me the truth. If you’ve changed your mind it’s alright, I won’t be cross with you.”
John blinks against the glare of early morning winter sunshine and shuts his eyes again. It can't be more than half seven. His head hurts. A result of too much wine the night before and a frigidly cold bedroom. His
Sherlock sank against John’s thigh, rubbed a hand over the bulge in his jeans, began kissing over his hip. He was making little cat-like noises and insinuating his fingers between John’s legs. A shudder of arousal rippled down John’s entire body, making his head light.
John traces his tongue along Sherlock’s hamstring, scrapes his teeth along the sensitive skin on the inside of his knee. Sherlock sobs and throws one arm across his eyes, head thrashing back and forth against the sheets, the pillow having already fallen to the floor. Laying Sherlock’s trembling leg back on the bed, he crawls up to put their mouths together again. Sherlock meets him hungrily with an insistent tongue, pushing fiercely between John’s already kiss raw lips. John gentles the kiss, slowly circling the end of Sherlock’s tongue with his own, nudging their noses together.
“...he’s always telling me to just use my phone, get one of those you write on with the little stylus, but…” John jerked a thumb at Sherlock, the expression on his face far too open and friendly to be real.
Sherlock shrugs. "I don't pay attention."
Sometimes though. Sometimes I still startle awake, anxiety heavy in my stomach and my nerves on fire, at two in the morning. I try not to wake you, if you’re beside me.
Sherlock's smoking a cigarette when John emerges. One foot braced against the brick, his coat drawn closed against the cold, hair whipping in little tangled tufts in the wind. He's peering down at his phone, thumb flying over the keys, smoke billowing out of his nose. Fuck, he is absolutely gorgeous. Singular. Wholly and incomparably unique.  Truly no one else like him in the entire world.
, and now here's Sherlock in his arms, kissing him, his warm tongue soft and slick and touching every part of John's mouth it can reach. It's all happening so fast, after all these years of bottling it up. No time to overthink, just to feel, to do what comes naturally. Sherlock's right hand twists up against John's neck, cradling the back of his head, thumb rubbing hot behind his ear.
He kisses Sherlock like he loves him.
"Really?"
He steps into the bedroom and sees his favourite jeans and his old red button down laid out on the bed. The one he was wearing when they had the fight. Sherlock's put them there, these specific clothes, to remind him. Of all the years they've been together, of what they've been through. The gesture is so profoundly thoughtful after the week they've had, that it nearly reduces him to weeping already. He pulls the jeans on, supple and well worn, and slides his arms into the slightly too loose arms of the button down - he weighed at least a stone more when they met. Running round with Sherlock all these years has worn away those soft lines, turned his stomach flat and his arms wiry and muscled.
“Okay…”
and couldn't. He really could not breathe.
“That’s it, darling, that’s it,” John encourages, his hips snapping ferociously as his hand speeds up, dragging his palm over the head to spread Sherlock’s precome, gripping him lightly just the way Sherlock likes it.
Sherlock nods and mumbles, "Yes, yes," quiet and slurred, his breathing shallow and rabbit fast. He fumbles at his trousers, half undoes the button and nearly smacks John in the face with his belt buckle.
helpless hiccuping noises every time John rolls his hips, pushes in a little more and a little more. He wants to sound sensual, not like an overgrown pigeon. But he can’t stop himself, and John doesn't seem to notice. In fact, he's staring into Sherlock's eyes with something that can’t be described as anything but adoration.
. He couldn’t take the inertia. When the car dropped them in front of 221B, John just turned on his heel and started walking. Sherlock wordlessly fell into step, sweeping along beside him, occasionally taking his hand reassuringly. They’d stalked though Marylebone until they hit Oxford Street, where John hung a sharp left, passing quickly through the gleaming hordes of posh shoppers in Mayfair, winding them through the tiny crooked lanes of Soho and down through Covent Garden. They’d stopped to use the loo and get cappuccinos in a tiny hipster coffee shop on Monmouth Street, sharing a rich chocolate croissant under the awning as they waited for a rain shower to pass.
John shifts, moves down so they’re face to face, kisses Sherlock as though they’ve been kissing each other good morning always, easy and familiar and lingering. He runs a finger over Sherlock’s lower lip and nibbles at his own. “Are you very sore?”
Sherlock kisses him, kisses those perfect dimples at the base of his spine, kisses each arse cheek. “Your arse tastes like candy.”
Sherlock can feel John tensing. “Don’t. Just don’t. Please. It’s not worth it.”
He needed someone to do it for him.
“Well. I guess we’d both better get on that. But. Listen. I had a really,
“Oh, you got a friend now, honey.” She set the coffee down, sloshing a few drops onto the table, and tipped the creamers into John’s hand, brushing her thumb over his lightly. She turned to the other man, a smile still stretched across her plain features. “And what can I get you?”
“Lester, was there anyone else here? Have I had any visitors besides you?” John’s voice sounded urgent and frantic to his own ears. he was terrified of the answer, either way.
A hundred years ago. A thousand.
“Mmm. Not really.” John’s voice is thick with drowsiness. “Was watching you.”
John wiggles, turns his face, brushes his lips against Sherlock's shoulder, and murmurs, "I love you."
John keeps saying that, that he’s
“Yeah, yeah, come on," John gasped, chewing at his lip, his cheeks flushed and glowing above his beard. He raised his hips entreatingly, pushing the head of his cock against Sherlock’s lips. "Open your mouth."
Sherlock’s hand finds the back of John’s head, fingers carding through his hair as he arches his neck toward John’s mouth. “I love you, too.”
Ginger ground his jaw and glared at them, as though whatever he’d heard through the radio was their fault. “I’m needed inside - but you two don’t move, alright?”
affectionate, can’t seem to say just three little words.
"Sherlock, do you get the feeling we're playing house?" John smiles, but his eyes look sad. He stares at the bed, makes no move to get in it.
“No, fuck, it’s so good, that feels so - “ John’s voice breaks, and the sound of it lodges painfully behind Sherlock’s sternum. He wants John to make that sound underneath him every day for the rest of his life.
John’s eyes widened in mock surprise as he dropped his jeans with a thump and pushed his pants off. “Sherlock Holmes. Language.”
." Sherlock makes a hard desperate noise, his chest moving fast against John's chest, and wrenches his head to the side, pulling John's face up with his hand at the same time, crushing their mouths together in a hard kiss that's all teeth. "I'm so sorry."
John sighs and settles his weight stretched all along Sherlock's back, his head resting in the curve of Sherlock's neck. His arms drape over Sherlock's waist and he tucks his hands up against his ribs. Sherlock feels John's belly expanding into the small of Sherlock's back with every inhalation, filling the space between them.
“Good, because you - because I -
“Oh no. Absolutely not. I know where that leads. I’ll help you in and I’ll help you out. That’s it.”
Sherlock clicked his phone off without saying goodbye. He had to get John home. Just get him out of this horrible place, and it would all disappear. It would just. Go away.
The sun hangs low, orange light illuminating shallowly the alleyways and mews where the kids like Sherlock take refuge, sleep, fuck, do their drugs. It’s an unusually   humid night for October, feels more like August, everything sticky and moist. The city smells are amplified, hanging in the air, clinging to Sherlock’s skin. The river stinks of fish and boat oil.
“How did you -- why --” Can’t form a thought, still half crouched on the ground, knee digging into a broken chunk of asphalt. John's looking down with steely glare still in his eyes.
, and
Sherlock nodded again. “But...I want to do what we talked about, I do. I really do.” He paused and bit into his lip hard enough to make the flesh around his teeth go white as the blood rushed away. “I want to...cut you, and I want you cut me, and I want to get our blood tattooed into each other skin. I haven’t changed my mind about any of it.”
this? I thought I’d -” He swallows as his hands close around the metal, warm from Sherlock’s body heat. “I thought I’d tossed it. No, I
“No?” Watson’s cheeky grin was half hidden by the droop of his moustache, but the look in his eyes was plain enough and as he raked them up and down my body, they darkened perceptibly. His tongue darted out over his lips as he set his coffee cup carefully on the rickety side table. “What
Sherlock kisses at John's wrist, "Criminals tend to get angry when you infiltrate their networks and shut down their financial contacts. Body counts start rising and people get frustrated... I had a few mishaps along the way. Purely physical. It's fine. They'll get better. In time."
“It was - “Sherlock’s nose wrinkles up in that way that makes John’s stomach flip over.
Sherlock puts his other hand on John's thigh, behind him, and folds his feet under John's calves and rocks again, John's cock sliding slick against his arse, and they both moan, Sherlock's head falling back as his mouth falls open.  John puts his hands back on Sherlock's hips, and pushes a little, getting him in the spot where -
"Sorry." Sherlock goes for apologetic, but ends up grinning proudly.
“Well, you didn’t
“Oh. I didn’t know you smoked.” Sherlock tried to cover his shock, to speak more gently than he normally would. John was so fragile. Sherlock felt it in every glance, saw it in every sad smile, every twitch of his eyelids. There were emotions between them too deep, too unfathomably deep, to even verbalise. They were talking around each other, falling into old patterns.
“They’re in the kitchen. You took them off when you were making coffee.” Sherlock says casually, affection plucking at the edges of every word. He looks up at John over the ridge of his laptop screen and puffs at the pipe between his teeth - an ivory encrusted relic he’d discovered in a dusty shop in Notting Hill a few weekends ago. It’s nothing but overwrought Victorian filigree and someone else’s tooth marks on the stem, and John finds it loathsome. Sherlock adores it. “Actually, fetch me a fresh cup while you’re in there.”
“What?”
“We didn’t. Do now. I went…” He nodded his head, smiling crookedly down at Sherlock, who was now passing exploring fingers over his neck and breathing hot against his throat. “...to a shop. I can’t believe you didn’t deduce it or smell it on me or something.”

John’s mouth goes dry.
“So. Plans for today?” Mike pours milk in his coffee and takes a bite out of the giant pile of fried potatoes that take up half his plate.
"Yeah, but --" Sherlock shrugs, pulls on his cigarette. "No money. I can,
“In control?” John smoothed Sherlock’s fringe back as he nodded. “And I’ve let you be in control this week and it’s gotten to be a bit much. Too much.”
“Voldemort.”
That feeling of being watched returns. John glances around. The scruffy Americans.
“What you said. It’s -” John shakes his head, words failing him entirely.
"Here lads, more beer!" John squeezed onto the end of a bench next to one of the other backs, a tiny red headed bloke from East London who John didn’t know that well. He and two others relieved John of three of his four pints. He took the last one for himself and slammed it quickly, allowing the din of the pub to wash over him.
In the fourteen years of our acquaintance, we had never been so many days apart. It was simply unheard of. Where I went, so went Watson. I sulked and pouted as I was wont to do when trying to encourage Watson to bend to my desires, but it had been to no avail. He was determined he would not accompany me on this particular case and there had been no swaying him. He kissed me softly before I departed, however, his eyes as blue as the hollyhocks in Mrs Hudson’s back garden, and smiled.
"Because I'm talking about bees?"
The emphasis on the last three words isn’t lost on John. He unscrews the lid of the carafe, pours, and stirs sugar into Sherlock’s cup, allowing his mind to drift back to that first night. The first - but not by far the last - time he was knocked nearly flat by the intensity of Sherlock’s changeable green eyes staring into his own. He can still recall with clarity the shimmering exhilaration of that night - the way it was as if suddenly the world had opened to him in a way it never could have without Sherlock Holmes at his side. The sky had seemed to grow until the movement of the stars had made him dizzy, the cobblestones in the narrow streets of Covent Garden had a lustre he’d never noticed, the white tile in the tube station at Baker Street had gleamed and shone like a wall of diamonds. John had never felt wonder like that before Sherlock. Life had been mostly a laundry list of have-to’s, and he’d drudged through, making the best of it. Sherlock had brought a magic into his life - into his soul - that had burrowed down and taken root and forever changed how he saw the world.
"There. I've been waiting all week to have those gorgeous fingers up my arse.” John can barely breathe as Sherlock’s hand snakes between his legs and two wet fingers stroke softly at his perineum for a moment and then press into him. “Oh god, Sherlock.”
They'd been teasing each other ever since they'd settled in, a delicious slow burn building between them. When they'd first gotten together, this kind of lingering arousal was impossible to maintain, the frantic hunger they'd repressed for so long had been too powerful to resist. Every kiss had turned into grinding hips and groping hands immediately, getting each other off as quickly as possible in all manner of inappropriate places. It had been months before they could take their time, before they had the patience to spend hours in bed exploring each other.
“Yes?”
John's eyes struggled open, and he blinked several times. "What? How do you...?"
“They’re coming, okay? You fucking hold on. You hear me, John? Goddammit. Don’t you
did it."
John was falling apart. Sherlock hardly recognised him, the thinness of his frame, the hard set to his jaw. He was doing things Sherlock never imagined John would be capable of. Hurting people, hurting himself. Sherlock rarely second guessed himself, but now...Now he was certain he’d caused this, by not telling John what was about to happen. By leaving him to be sucked in by the quicksand of grief.
. You thought I was - ? I wasn't attracted to Irene. I wasn't in love with Irene."
Sherlock claws at one of the arms squeezing into John, but gets dragged back himself, huge ham hock arms across his own chest, sour garlicky breath hot on the side of his face.
John smiled against his mouth, and nipped Sherlock’s bottom lip with his teeth as he knelt up. Silhouetted against the orange glow of the fire, his skin golden and shimmering with sweat, hair standing up in messy spikes, the kilt draped beautifully over his sinewy hips and thighs, he looked exactly like the rugged highland warrior Sherlock had been envisioning since he laid eyes on the kilt. Sherlock watched, rapt, as John filled his palm with lube, parted the pleats of the kilt and stroked his prick.
Sherlock swallows the shame in his throat. Never embarrassed about anything. Until John. “Stay outside?”
Owen slapped him on the back so hard that he lurched forward and spilled beer all over his hand and the bar. "Well, then you're all ours tonight, right? Our mad scoring fullback - how many tries tonight, John? Three? Fucking brilliant, mate!"
"Sherlock. Yes, you might. And if you do, you'll use that safeword and we'll stop, or we will never do this again, do you hear me?"
“Alright, I’m just going to shower, and then we’ll be off. Be a love and put on coffee while I’m in the loo.”
The scrimmage ends abruptly with Gryffindor’s Seeker catching the Snitch, and Mike stands up, brushing off the backs of his pants.
John's head tilted to the side. John's perfect silver blonde head that held all of John inside it, all of his secrets and memories, all his funny quirks, his bravery and intelligence, the ability to save people's lives with just his delicate small hands. Sherlock reached up and wrapped his own enormous hands around the sides of John's head and pulled him down to kiss him with as much feeling as he could express with just the slide of his mouth against John's.
After he was dried off and dressed, he cracked a window, and laid back on bed. Lit a cigarette and pulled out his mobile.
"I heard you two on the phone last night."
"I know, sweetheart." John abruptly sat up, and Sherlock swung his head around to see what he was doing. John untied the sock around his ankle and tossed the bag of ravioli towards the kitchen. He slithered off the sofa and snuggled up next to Sherlock, looking up at him with undisguised adoration. The firelight flickered in his dark eyes, accentuated the golden tone of his skin. He raised his tumbler of scotch and smiled. "To us, and a long deserved holiday."
"You can't be here?" John repeats dumbly, staring at Sherlock cleaning his foot with an alcohol wipe and putting a plaster over it.
“Shut up and go to sleep, Sherlock.”
fault.”
“I’m - I’m -” Sherlock whimpers and rolls his head against John's, grabbing at the sheets, at John’s thigh, at anything he can dig his fingers into.
“Christ, Sherlock. I don’t even like crisps.” John had muttered, wiping his eyes.
"Starving." John rubs his hand up Sherlock's spine, and their lips meet. "I don't want to go anywhere."
.” John murmurs, and crawls forward, puts his knees on either side of Sherlock’s thighs. Strong arms around his back, pulling him close. John’s mouth in his hair. “Sherlock Sherlock…” He whispers over and over, rocking back and forth a little bit.
The moon is shining bright winter white when Sherlock startles awake at half past two, his mind racing. The memory of how he got into bed comes back in pieces. John's fingers under his chin, John's mouth against his cheek, whispering, "Come on, you don't want to sleep on the sofa." John tugging him down the hallway, covering him with blankets. John curling around his back, kissing his neck, pressing his hand possessively into Sherlock's stomach. John.
We don’t talk about anything that happened before, before that first night when I was home again. Remember? I said I was going to bed, and you smiled at me, the glow of the laptop reflecting in your hair, and said
“I need - eyes and ears at Hogwarts.”
“Oh, get the fuck off me.” John gave him a hard shove in the ribs, bit back the urge to punch him bloody. “I’m not your fucking boyfriend.”
He musters the energy to speak. “Yes. Thank you. For...everything. You don’t have to stay.”
have back home and also a long buried hope about what might still be possible. If this John can love him, want him, then maybe...
“It’s fine.” Sherlock says stiffly. He forces a small smile and runs his fingers down over the curve of John’s bicep. “You’re all cleaned up. Let’s have dinner.”
“Yeah. Like this.” John mumbles, pressing his face into the rumpled sheets and pushing his arse up.
"I am. I really am." The kettle screams and John stands up. "Let's go back inside. I'm fucking freezing out here."
,” I was already near a shameless whimper, my cock now fully hard and nudging out crudely through the part in my dressing gown. I straddled him, pressing my knees back as far as they would go, squeezed between John’s hips and the arms of the chair.
, John,” Already spinning dizzily as John’s left hand meanders promisingly down his belly, Sherlock reaches out and tangles his fingers in John’s hair, looking for an anchor. “Do you want - like yesterday, or - ?”
No, god that sounds so -
Anger and possessiveness surge up in him, arms instinctively tightening around the rise and fall of John’s sleeping body. “I’m his boyfriend, who the hell are you?”
“What? What did I say to do?” John swallowed, closed his eyes. It was too much effort to keep them open. A vision swam in back of his eyelids, a half remembered voice.
“John. Can I tell you why?”
. John, who is still tucked tight against Sherlock's back, breathing even and soft, his knee resting against Sherlock's hip. John, who was
John looked up at him, eyes drifting to Sherlock’s mouth. Well, there’s my invitation, Sherlock thought, and leaned forward. The angle was awkward, but John tipped his chin up, and Sherlock pressed their mouths together, his fingers softly resting against John’s throat. This kiss was different from last night. John wasn’t so hesitant, wasn’t so exhausted and drained. There was heat infused in this kiss now, and a shivery gasp exhaled through John’s parted lips into Sherlock’s mouth. A tremor curled over his scalp and down his neck, and he licked wonderingly at John’s tongue, not at all sure where they were going with this.
about you. Poor Sherlock. Poor messed up Sherlock who needs John to feed him and bathe him and treat him like a goddamned baby. It's never about John.
John has already passed the point of no return. Just say it. "Sherlock. If you had left me again, I would never have survived it."
. He thinks about it for a scant moment, discovering to his shock that he actually very much wants to. Not for the sodding Quidditch of course, but the chance to see John again, maybe to talk to him like a normal person.
“I don’t understand what makes me want this with
"You know. We don't have to say everything tonight. This is just the start, right? We're going to work this out together, and we're married. We have our whole lives. Don't we?"
yourself differently now.”
“Well. This one’s gotten himself into a spell of trouble, and while I’d love to help, I have my own business to attend to. You’re going to stay here and get him out of his trouble, until it’s done. I have to leave. Lester here will explain everything to you. Can you handle that, Lester?” He looked at the smaller man like he was a mentally challenged child.
Sherlock doesn't say anything.
Sherlock shakes his head. "Is nothing impossible to you, John Watson?"
John crouches down to build the fire, seemingly unconcerned about being two feet away from open flames and completely nude. Sherlock rolls to his side, watching him hungrily, because he’s allowed to. Allowed to want him, allowed to let his eyes roam over the movement of his back, the way his shoulder blades knit together when he reaches for a chunk of wood, the tension in his slim hips as he shifts his weight.
Sherlock’s tongue flicks into the corner of his mouth as the skin around his eyes crinkles up amusedly. “Oh certainly. You could slip.”
kiss. He just needs to crawl inside John and never leave, needs to make John
“You are far too talented with that mouth. I was - well, I almost ruined our plans for welcoming home our new chair.” He licked at his own mouth, slow and sinful.
.” John licks at the head and then trails the fingertips of his left hand down the crease of Sherlock’s arse. He dips in experimentally, even though he can’t really do what he wants to right now, because he doesn’t want to stop sucking Sherlock’s cock long enough to go get the lube, but he just wants to see, see what Sherlock will do.
the concern radiating off of him.
They stumble into the shower together and wash quickly, efficiently, drag themselves over to the sink and brush their teeth next to each other, all elbows and hips, grinning giddily at each other in the mirror with foam all over their chins. Sherlock can’t believe that six hours before, he was standing in Jim’s flat, terrified out of his mind and wondering if he’d ever see John again. It seems unreal.
"How did you...?" Sherlock chokes out, half the air being compressed out of his lungs.
"Okay." John turns and snuffles against Sherlock's shoulder, hums. "You're a cocktease bastard, but I love you anyway."
- John’s bare shivering skin and soft
It’s hopelessly uncoordinated, as John slides his knees alongside Sherlock’s hips and Sherlock pulls at John’s shoulders and they try to kiss and grind against each other at the same time, which isn’t really possible even if they were the same height. Eventually John settles for sitting up and running his hands all over Sherlock’s chest while Sherlock licks at his own lips and looks longingly at John’s. John flattens one palm against Sherlock’s taut stomach to brace himself and licks the other to wet it, rubs it over the shiny wet heads of their cocks.
He peels off his slightly damp, dirty jeans, and climbs into bed in a tee shirt and boxers. Alchemy immediately runs up his arm and tucks into his neck, sniffing and pawing at him.
“Coming out, love?” John says easily, leaning out of Harry’s embrace, his eyes just the littlest bit red and wet.
Dear Sherlock,
John exhales heavily, feeling much like a trapped animal. Sherlock's determined to draw this from him, no matter the consequence. There's no escape from Sherlock when he's like this.
This John held himself completely differently. There was no softness left in him. His John was always so soft; jumpers and warm tea and the layer of pudge over muscle. This man wasn’t his John. Sherlock couldn’t stop himself from trailing a fingertip over John’s face. He laid back on the cot in the tiny wood shack he was currently calling home, and clutched the phone screen down to his chest. He couldn’t look at this beautiful stranger for one more second.
me that? What is
“You’re teasing me.”
He’s halfway down the hall before Sherlock finds his voice. “John!”
“It’s certainly possible.
to boot.
You’re moving around now. I can hear you. Your body wondering where I’ve gone even before you’re conscious.
John pulls off long enough to say, “Fuck yes.
The phone hit the wall with such force that it cracked apart, shards of plastic flying to carpet. John barely made it to the loo before the vomit had made it’s way up. He slid to the floor, arms resting on the toilet bowl, and wept until he threw up again. Sleep found him finally, curled in a ball on the bathroom floor, tears and vomit dried on his face.
"Took us long enough, though. Christ, we're idiots."
Sherlock taps the side of John’s mug and stands up. “Well, I could use a warm-up. I’m freezing. Going to get a coffee - you want another latte?”
“Sure is. Now...uh, I hate to ask, since you’re paying in cash, and I hate to lose a sale, but uh...you got an American driver’s license, doncha, mister? I’m not supposed to sell to anyone who doesn’t, you know? Cause…” The man twisted his chubby fingers together, peered nervously at John through greasy thick glasses.
Sherlock fumbles with the key to the room, John pressing up against his back, the smell of tequila and oranges sweet on his breath whispering over Sherlock’s skin, which is cool from walking through the autumn night, and still damp and sticky from sweating at the club. John’s hands on Sherlock's hips, more tentative than when they'd been dancing, his fingers dipping down hesitantly under the waist of Sherlock's jeans, thumbing over the crest of his hipbone. The pad of his thumb so soft, just the hint of a nail dragging. Sherlock’s stomach contracts, mouth drops open a little as he struggles to breathe normally.
“This certainly isn’t how I envisioned it." John shook his head, rolled his eyes at the ceiling as Sherlock rinsed his hair with a plastic cup.
Sherlock swallows down the aching surge of affection that wells tight in his throat, and tiptoes out of the bedroom, shutting the door gently behind him.
Sherlock laughs loud and long. "I never thought I'd be one."
It was
"I know that, John."
“I love you.” Sherlock didn’t turn around.
“Fuck you.” John spat through clenched teeth.
"I was..."
With the revelation of Sherlock's profound need for John's praise and punishment, for John to take him in hand occasionally, to allow him to take care of John, they'd established something new. Sherlock took on most of the household responsibilities, bathed John, shaved him, dressed him; usually the act of doing so enough to soothe the unsettled feeling that always plagued him. John made the rules. John ruled Sherlock. Sherlock thrived on it, submissive and compliant, and generally more content than John remembered him ever being. John petted him and praised him, rewarded him with affection and presents, and occasionally corrected him when he stepped outside of the boundaries they'd established. He was still Sherlock, after all, and rules were often an afterthought.
You were right. And we can’t kiss this away either. I have things I should tell you, things I find really difficult to talk about - “
“But.” John says gently, and reaches his hand up to sweep Sherlock’s fringe away from his brow, to rub a thumb sweetly against his cheekbone, “You brilliant beautiful man. I don’t know if adding sex to everything else we’re - and I
John when he says he’ll be clean again, when he says they’ll fix everything together. He used to dismiss the idea that a person could change someone else’s life, that anyone could have that much power over another person. But then Jim came along, first love and all that. Sherlock used to be entranced by him, fascinated by his cruelty, his cold calculating mind. How he could switch it off and be all laughing, warm smiles and hot skin, rolling Sherlock into the bed and falling asleep curled against him. Two people have now entirely changed Sherlock’s life. Jim took his life away from him, and John’s giving it back.
She doesn't look offended; instead she laughs softly, and squeezes his arm. "What was I going to do? Leave you boys all alone? No, that wouldn't have done. Wouldn't have done at all."
Sherlock spreads his thighs, curls up, and slides his slicked hand over his bollocks and around. His eyes fall shut as he presses a finger against himself.
“Good evening, John.”
to hurt people. I’ve broken men’s noses because I didn’t like how loudly they were breathing. I beat a guy unconscious for asking me to close the shade on the airplane window. I would never...I don’t know who I am, what the fuck I’m doing. I thought I was going to die. This was a suicide mission, Sherlock. I didn’t plan to make it home again.”
Electricity zings down his spine at this faintest contact, and his gaze snaps up to meet Sherlock’s. Asking permission. Because months of texting doesn’t equal a relationship. Because they’ve never said they’re together. Because Sherlock is gorgeous and brilliant and posh and John’s a short kid from Hounslow whose parents couldn’t afford Oxford. Because John’s never felt so
anything?”
“Morning.” There’s a smile in John’s voice, hoarse from sleep.
“Actually,” Sherlock began, all too aware of John’s fist clenching tightly beside him, and trying to redirect this conversation into something
"No. Fuck. No, Sherlock, no, of course not. What could I be angry with you about?" He wants to surge forward, take Sherlock's face in his hands, feel smooth skin and morning stubble against his palms, tell him how he loves him so passionately and deeply that it's in his bones. That he wouldn't even
There would be time later. I ran my fingers over the back of the chair as I crossed the room to sit at our small breakfast table. There would be time.
“John. Come on. You need to sleep.” Sherlock gently shuffles them down the short hallway, John mumbling
Sherlock nods, his eyes drifting open with an expression of absolute adoration. "Yes, John."
“John, does the family - is this
“Goodnight, Sherlock.” John presses a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead and idly spins his wedding band around his finger, wondering what it really is about tonight that’s making his stomach twist in anxious knots.
Sherlock dries his hands and John hands him an apron. “You’ll like baking, Sherlock. It’s just chemistry, really.”
, Sherlock.” John smiles, shifts and rolls so he can tuck his knee between Sherlock’s thighs and nibbles at Sherlock’s lower lip. Sherlock sighs and sinks into him, his hand petting gently between John’s shoulder blades.
"Not very well, actually. Getting divorced. Nasty business. Let's not ever do that, m'kay?" John touched Sherlock's left hand, which was currently engaged untying John's right boot, and smiled, a touch of sadness marring his bright blue eyes.
“Uhhhhhh,” Sherlock manages, rubbing his head like a cat against John’s mouth.
“Goodnight, John.” A strange lonely ache spread through his chest as John hummed and turned on his side, dislodging the blanket. His tee shirt was rucked up to his chest, and his bare belly was covered in goosebumps. Sherlock straightened the blanket and pulled it back over his front, tugged his shirt down a bit. “Missed you tonight. The corpse did, too. You would have been fascinated. Completely drained of blood, skin like tissue paper - it just fell apart under my - ”
He leans against a brick wall, one hand braced against his heaving stomach, and looks around. Jesus. He's leaning against the public shower building at Hackney Downs. Where John saved him from the pedo that first day. His eyes well up, and he pulls the phone out of his pocket, wanting to hear John's voice. They don't have a phone in the flat. John doesn't have a phone. He stares at the screen blankly for a long moment and then slowly closes it.
Sherlock nods, his mouth in a defiant pout. “Yes. But it would matter to
“Yes, god, yes, tell me,” John shifts to the side, laying against Sherlock’s hip, and buries his face into Sherlock’s neck. “Don’t mind me. I’m just going to do this while you talk...”
John picked up the sterile square, now bloody and rumpled, and put it on the breakfast tray on the bedside table. He stretched out on his belly next to Sherlock, catching his cut arm on the sheets as he did so. He shuddered at the electric pain of it, the sizzle of heat that pulsed through his arm and sent chills racing down his spine. It started bleeding again, and without even thinking about it, he licked at the cut, lapping noisily and unashamedly.
He forced his eyes open, fighting against the pain of doing so. Black curls, aqua eyes. So familiar, but he couldn’t...couldn’t quite sort it out. Everything was so muddled.
The little shit holds his hands up in deference. He’s on his knees in the back seat, half out of his pants. He’s repulsive. Sherlock fights gagging, covers his mouth with a dirt smeared hand. “I don’t want any trouble from you.”
“Whatever you want, baby,” John murmurs, thumbs pressing possessively into Sherlock’s hipbones. “If you want, I could - “
John smirked up at him as he bent down to retrieve John's empty glass. "You're a love."
He’s still at Baker Street, or at least the layout of the flat is the same. He scans the room while John’s gone, taking in the rich crimson colour of the fireplace wall, the antique furniture, the thick wool rug, patterned with wear. Piles of books sit stacked on the dry wooden floors, pushed against the walls. A finely detailed bone pipe lays on its side on the arm of a green leather chair. A pair of worn leather boots are tucked neatly under John’s chair where his laptop is normally stashed.
“Up you get. Come on. We’re going to ride with him to hospital. That’s it.” Her grip is surprisingly firm around his bony elbow as she kicks the drugs and the syringes under the blanket with a severe look at Sherlock. She’s the only person who’s realised, realised that he lives here. She guides him up the steps behind the two paramedics bearing John on a stretcher. Sherlock can’t look at him.
Sherlock tried to shake off the dark mood, self-aware enough to know he was being petty and John didn't deserve anger or irritation just for being private about his rubbish childhood. Sherlock picked up the box, which was surprisingly light for its size, and the ridiculous letter opener and handed them both to John. He perched on the end of the sofa, chewing on his thumbnail, and watching.
Sherlock’s never touched any cock except his own. His inexperience doesn’t matter at all as he gets his hand around John’s, satiny hard and wet -
"You were fascinated by her." John sounds jealous, even standing here between Sherlock's legs, in their bedroom. He supposes he still is, a bit.
“Oh, I wouldn’t say
obvious when he said hi to you last night and your face turned nineteen shades of red and you couldn’t talk.” Mike turns a bit red himself, and grins up at Sherlock. “You should come watch him play. He’s
They stare at each other another long second, neither moving.
, get in.”
Lightburn took her hand off the knob and stepped closer to them, her crimson notebook back in her hand. All her warm friendliness had evaporated, replaced by a crisp authority as she flipped her notebook open to a blank page. “Alright, you two. I think you’d better tell me a bit more about what you’re doing in Cairndow.”
Sherlock drives their secondhand Vauxhall Astra into town once a week to go to the market. One week he comes home with chickens. John laughs and kisses his cheek, and builds a coop the next day. After that, they have eggs. When he brings home the goat -
"Mmmm, not yet." John bends down and kisses the middle of Sherlock's belly, smooth and warm and covered in soft downy blonde hairs. He pulls at the waist of Sherlock's trousers with his teeth, which makes Sherlock suck in a noisy breath and curl his fingers into John's hair. "These have to come off."
“Wasn’t even considering it.” The roughness of John’s moustache scrapes raw against Sherlock’s throat as he presses an open mouth to Sherlock’s hammering pulse and simultaneously insinuates his hand between them, rubbing at the head of Sherlock’s cock through his clothes. “Good? Yeah?”
Alchemy squirms up from under his jacket collar and drops down onto his lap, looking around curiously.
“Something new?” Sherlock’s eyes are immediately alight, his posture stiffening, ready to go flying down the stairs to Scotland Yard, to a new crime scene.
. They keep each other safe. From all that
“Mmm.” John grunted, rolled to his side. “Sherlock, it’s 5:00 in the morning. Be a good boy and shut up.”
“I don’t think I can get any closer, darling.” John licks Sherlock’s jaw, pivots his fingers inside
“I was waiting. Until you were -”
“Sorry, couldn’t help it.” John ducks under Sherlock’s arm, twists and starts walking backwards, grinning and pulling Sherlock along by his fingers. “I want to have fun with you tonight, okay? Laugh and drink and see you dance.”
An enchanting pink blush rises on Sherlock’s cheeks. He voice is stripped completely raw when he husks out, “Why don’t you show me?”
John wandered into the kitchen, and absentmindedly opened the fridge, pulled out one of the expensive micro brewed brown ales that Sherlock had surprised him with as a gift the day before, and flopped down on the sofa. He set his phone on his thigh and flipped on the telly. Some rerun of Top Gear. Perfect. Mindless and funny, something to keep his mind occupied without much effort until Sherlock got home. He sat down and wiggled, clenching his arse muscles and adjusting himself in his jeans. He’d been half hard and waiting for hours. It was beginning to become more than a little tedious.
"Sherlock, oh god," John's done this to himself, to other people, but seeing Sherlock, red faced and open mouthed, watching as one long finger slides inside his body and then another, watching his skin stretch around his fingers, it's profanely beautiful. "Look at you, you're so - Christ I don't even have words."
John squeezes his hand, and Sherlock can almost pretend they’re just on a first date, about to go to the cinema, share pizza afterwards and get off on the sitting room sofa before the parents walk in. That they're normal teenagers, instead of a junkie and a messed up abused kid from the suburbs who don't even know yet if they'll have food today.
“Surgeon.” John wiggles his fingers under Sherlock’s nose, and lifts his eyebrows. “Very dextrous hands.”
There’s a shifting of weight, a settling beside him on the tiny bench, a hand on his back. “He’s going to be just fine. Just fine.”
“What are you two doing out here? Curfew began fifteen minutes ago.” Professor Longbottom’s normally cheerful face is now suspicious. “Go on, get to your dorms.”
Sherlock barely registers the comment. John can see the gears still turning in his mind. “Our sex though...is relatively vanilla, comparatively, to much of what I read. I wouldn't mind - going a bit - farther in that area.”
"Who?"
The man flipped over and laid on his back. Looked at John approvingly. “I’ve never done it with someone from England before. I like your accent.”
"Yes, John. Thank you." Sherlock's voice trembles, his head dropping back against John's. "How did you know I would - ?"
John lets out a little gasp of surprise and Sherlock licks it away. Bites down on John’s lower lip while he’s busy wrapping his legs around his hips. John groans at the contact, reaches back and runs his palm down the outstretched length of Sherlock’s thigh, digs his fingers into the fleshy part of his arse and holds on.
"No." Sherlock sounds shocked he would even ask. He looks up at John and shakes his head, "
“I just want to make sure you’re alright, John.” Half his words get lost in the press of his face against John’s chest as he burrows impossibly close and tucks three cold fingers under the placket and against John’s bare skin.
The bartender comes over, Sherlock orders them two Kamikazes, realises John has all the money. The club is playing with his head, the thrumming of the beat, the lights swirling and flashing, the noise. John’s hot hard body pressed against him.
He’s compact, not powerfully built - slim but sturdy. His shoulders are square and broad, curving up into a strong thick neck. His back muscles ripple as he walks, shoulder blades smooth and beautifully shaped, underneath them a gently inward curve at his waist, that invitingly lickable back ending in two perfect dimples at the base of his spine. He's wearing black combat boots and there's a tattoo on his right bicep that's definitely military, though he's too far away to make out the details.
"I bet your dick's as pretty as your face," John deftly undoes Sherlock's jeans with three fingers, and pushes them down just far enough to shove his hand in and pull Sherlock's cock out. He whines with pleasure, wraps his hand around Sherlock without preamble and begins to stroke, “Fuck, god, every part of you is gorgeous. I want you to fuck me with your pretty perfect cock.”
through him, something not unpleasant, but wholly unfamiliar. An avalanche of pet names tumble through his mind -
Sherlock puts his nose in John's hair above his ear and whispers, "Yes."
John enveloped Sherlock’s cock in the sweet intense heat of his mouth, licking hard at the vein on the underside and stroking him relentlessly slowly, keeping Sherlock hovering on the knife’s edge of the orgasm that was sitting tremulous and hot between his legs. Just as Sherlock was sure he couldn’t bear another second of this exquisite torture, John let Sherlock’s prick out of his mouth with a final dirty swipe of his tongue into the slit, and slipped his fingers out, gently caressing his perineum as he did so. Sherlock whined and pressed down into John’s touch, wanting so much more than this deliberate gentle pace. He wanted John to
hope there's a bed in that bedroom."
Sherlock doesn't believe a word of it. He knows Molly is almost certainly dead. But John's so earnest, he can't bring himself to be discouraging. "Yeah, that sounds good."
“Yes, of course,” John lies easily. “Just come to raid the fridge. Any of those apple pasties from yesterday left?
“Sherlock.”
and normal - maybe he’s always been
Sherlock considers that, his head tilting to the left the way it always does when he’s thinking. His eyes roam over John’s face, curious and sparkling.
“Yeah, I fucking know. That’s why I’m asking for gauze.” John still had the assignment in the package he’d picked up in Fargo. He had to get this weasel done with, and fast. The truth was, he didn’t really have any idea how to be a criminal. Beating the fuck out of people and being angry wasn’t enough. He was used to working with cops, not against them. Used to looking for evidence, not destroying it.
“Mmmm,” Mike looks up at Sherlock out of the corner of his eye and grins. He’s got a mischievous glint as he says, “Gryffindor and Ravenclaw are having a scrimmage this morning, practicing before the official season starts and all. Thought I might go down and watch. You could come with me. If you wanted to.”
John dove forward, thrusting his tongue into Sherlock’s willing mouth, their teeth scraping together. John bit down on Sherlock’s tongue, the inside of his lips. Sherlock cried out softly, but didn’t pull away, instead pressed three fingernails into the bite mark he’d left on John the week before, sending pleasure pain signals spiraling through John’s nervous system. He moaned low into Sherlock’s mouth, pulled back, breathing hard.
The room was desperately hot. John couldn’t get a deep breath, the air was so dry and thick. He fumbled for the call button, fingers clumsy and swollen. He couldn’t make his fingers contract enough to actually press it. Fuck. He needed water, and paracetamol, and food. Oh, god, it was bright. How can eyeballs hurt, he wondered, as he let his eyes fall shut. Because, god, they did.
“Oh, John. I love you so much." Sherlock curled over John’s back, tall enough to hook his chin over John’s shoulder and kiss him, sweeping his tongue along John’s lower lip. His hand skidded down the planes and swells of John’s lower belly, found his stiff and leaking prick and took him in hand. He thumbed rhythmically at the slit, soft skin giving just a little as he pressed enough to make John tremble.
“Hey. Weren’t you the one telling me earlier that Jim wasn’t worth it? They aren’t either.” John’s hand around Sherlock’s chin, pulling his head round to look at him. His hands are so strong, the knuckles knobby, calloused. “Hey. Right? We’re out to have fun, yeah? Not get arrested for picking a fight with two bigoted middle aged old twats.”
looked at him like this. It’s like looking into the sun - it hurts, it burns, and he can’t look away. John’s hand in his hair turns strangely tender, scratching fingernails along his scalp in a way that makes Sherlock think of some warm sunny morning with John stretched out beside him in bed, cool sheets and sticky bellies. He shuts his eyes against the thought - achingly sweet, oddly welcome, and surely unattainable - and goes to his knees.
“Good. Great. Just, get out. I have shit to do.” He waited until the door was shut, and he went and locked it. It wouldn’t do to have some dumb fuck hooker stealing his shit, possibly fucking up this whole enterprise.
Sherlock rubbed gently at the back of John’s sweat slick neck and hummed. “I never do understand your reticence about other people knowing about our sex life. Because really, John, I think it’s rather something to be proud of.”
?” John slid his grip from my waist to my arse, parting me, and simultaneously thrusting his hips up to rub against my bared and aching cock with the line of his own, barely concealed under his thin linen nightshirt.
"Yeah, would seem so."
it. He’ll never be able to sleep again unless it’s with John Watson twisted around him like ivy.
,” he adds, knowing the effect his asking nicely has always had on John.
His head still aches.
“John. I’m so sorry I put you through all of this, and that you have carried such a burden. You’ve done nothing wrong. I’m not angry at you, I’m not disgusted. At all. I’m a bit flattered, now that I think about it.”
“Oh, love. You’re really not at all cut out for this, are you?”
, a burning viscous desire drenching John’s synapses until all he can think about is
“I should have believed in you. I should have had more faith.” John nodded, chewing on his lip, and looked away.
Sherlock crawls into bed beside John, melds to his side, their bodies perfectly corresponding shapes. Made to be together this way.
“No.”
Now that he knows John’s going to live, the fear and shock is changing over to anger. A ball of red hot fury making his shoulders clench tight.
“Do that - do that - again -
All before he knew what John was going through. He’d had no idea what effect his death would have on John. He knew he’d miss him, of course, but thought he’d be alright. Be stable, at least. Now he knew better.
Sherlock cleared his throat very quietly. Testing. Observing John’s reaction. That motherfucker. Still observing him, deducing him, like a bloody experiment, after what he’d put him though. John could feel the rage uncoiling inside him, the kind that made him pound people’s faces into tile walls in airport bathrooms. He wanted to beat the shit out of Sherlock, hit that beautiful face until it was putty. He wanted to scream at him, beat on his chest with his fists, make him hurt the way John had been hurting.
“I know. I just -”
John presses a hand against that back he loves so much, and pulls Sherlock closer to him. They fit together now as beautifully as they always have, John’s slightly expanding middle tucking neatly into the concave space between Sherlock’s ribs and pelvis. Sherlock’s still nimble fingers untie the tapes of John’s pyjama bottoms, his mouth working gently at John’s earlobe.
“I know, John, I know,” Sherlock pulls John’s knuckles to his mouth and kisses them one by one.
Sherlock's fingers unfurl over John's hips, his hands so large they wrap easily around John's narrow frame. He fiddles with the edge of his jumper, pushes a thumb inside, against a patch of smooth bare skin. He looks up at John, eyes luminous and dark, his nose pink at the tip from the wool.
John tilted his chin up and Sherlock bent down, kissing him softly. John’s arms encircled his neck, pulling him closer, gently winding his fingers into Sherlock's hair.
Sherlock eases the navy blue cotton down over John’s legs, watching his cock spring free, thick and flushed, glans shining wet. Sherlock whispers
“Yeah, Sherlock?” John can’t stop threading his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, trailing over his ears, touching every part of bare skin he can reach.
Sherlock licked up to the head with a wide flat tongue, flicked at the slit and tasted salt and bitterness. John was dehydrated from all the drinking, his come would be thick and pungent. Sherlock shuddered at the thought. John’s come on his tongue was a treasure, however strong and bitter it was.
"Yeah, alright." John's still looking at the wood planks set off to the side of the stairwell dubiously, but he follows when Sherlock beckons him down the steps.
John shrugs, laughs ruefully. "Are you politely asking whether I knew I'd be committing crimes? Yeah, I knew. I didn't give a single
John cocks his head to the side, furrows his brow. “Whatever
“What?” John’s entire face furrows in confusion, somehow managing to look half amused and desperately sad at the same time.
“Too long.” John kisses Sherlock’s shoulder, curls closer, and pulls Sherlock against him. “He’s not going to call tonight.”
moustache. But when? Where?
“You all next of kin?” The doctor looks dubiously at them, gives Sherlock a once over and then focuses on Mrs Hudson, clearly more comfortable talking to her than to the trembling blood and vomit soaked teenager beside her.
“Come on, John.” Sherlock strides quickly out the door, wincing as he realises he just said John’s name aloud. Shit. Brain just not functioning as it should be.
"As charming as ever, John." Mycroft flashes his most simpering smile and John sneers back, rolling his eyes toward the ceiling.
Sherlock murmurs something unintelligible that sounds like agreement, curls his legs up to bracket John’s hips, and pulls John’s lower lip tenderly into his mouth, sucking softly and running his tongue back and forth along the inner rim. John sinks deeper toward him, feeling as though he’d be content to just dissolve into this moment, their tongues languidly exploring each other’s mouths, Sherlock’s toes tracing a circle against the back of John’s thigh, their bellies already becoming slick with precome and sweat as they find a gentle rhythm together.
He retrieves the pillows from where they fell to the floor and puts them back on the bed as he slips under the sheets. They’re sticky and damp, but his body is suddenly leaden and exhausted and he can’t find it in himself to care. Sherlock rolls toward him until they’re nose to nose. John finds his hands under the sheets and twines their fingers together. They kiss sleepily for a few minutes, until Sherlock wriggles down and burrows into John’s chest.
“Only briefly." Mycroft actually sounds vaguely nervous, though it's probably mostly an act.
"Good." John picks up their entwined hands and kisses the honey off of them. "I never thought I'd be married to a farmer, you know."
this shit out loud in a public place. Fuck, but you’re stupid as shit sometimes.” John bit back an urge to smack him. “But, you know, well done, I guess.”
A vision flashes bright in John's mind's eye; his hand around Sherlock's throat, pushing him up against the door, Sherlock clawing at his wrist, begging for air. John's fingers depressing Sherlock's windpipe. He's done that before. In combat. He knows how much pressure to exert, when to back off. His eye twitches.
"No. No, it's alright. I want to tell you. You just - caught me off guard." If he can't be honest about tonight, at least he can be honest about something. "Molly was, um, someone I met when I first left home. She, uh, took to me, and we were both completely alone, so we stayed together. Her parents were like yours. She was really smart, wanted to be a forensic scientist. We used to talk, about science, and math. Things that made us remember - who we were. Inside. She, um, had to, you know...like I did. We watched out for each other. Most of the time. And then, one night, I was really...out of it, and I couldn't go with her, and um, she went out to try and make some money, and she just never came home."
. He’s never felt himself like this, open and wet and
you asked. Always so careful with me. I nodded, I think. I don’t remember the in between parts. Your mouth was soft and hungry and your tongue was parting my lips so hesitantly I couldn’t stand it. I let my wine spill on the floor when I put my hands in your hair. Neither of us noticed. You tasted like kimchi and jasmine and you smelled like rain.
“No. Not a dream.”
John takes a deep breath and tries to listen to all three, which is surprisingly difficult. “Sherlock. I understand you’re upset, but this not the way to handle it, okay? It's no ones fault. Not yours, not mine. You did need to rest last night, you wouldn’t have gotten anywhere with the case even if you were there, and it’s fucking okay to not be perfect all the time, alright? You don’t have to solve every single case you’re on. Sometimes Greg can actually be a cop, he knows how to do that.”
“Well, he’s - would you like to sit down? Here, let’s go in the family room.” The doctor motions them into a small room two meters down the hallway, with a table covered in old ripped up magazines and four scrungy looking chairs. The doctor just looks at them, allowing Mrs Hudson to put her purse on the floor, arrange themselves. He’s not saying anything.
John inches forward, suddenly and powerfully needing to be as close to Sherlock as possible. Inside him would be better, inside him and all over him, hot skin and hard breaths and Sherlock's nails scratching down his spine. Carefully, John loops a leg over Sherlock’s thigh, warm and dry under the blankets. Sherlock stirs, sniffs, turns his face into John’s hair and sighs. The arm that had been above his head drops down to curl around John’s shoulders.
“Good?” John asks, gentle and quiet.
He didn’t know, he’d never been in love. They didn’t talk about it, this
"You keep saying that, but you don't know what I'm going to say." John pulled his hand out of Sherlock's gently, fingers trailing over Sherlock's, and laid it on his stomach. Black and bruised against the crisp white hospital sheets, clenching and unfurling over and again. “Okay, so. I...oh, fuck. This is really impossible to say. I can’t. I just.”
Sherlock swallows, trying to think of a response. “
There’s a flurry of movement, and the group of Americans is suddenly getting up, pushing back chairs and picking up bags. John freezes, and Sherlock kicks him lightly under the table, reminding him.
John breaks the kiss, slides down and tucks his head under Sherlock’s chin while he tugs at the two remaining buttons on Sherlock’s pants. Sherlock breathes in through his nose, huffs a breath out through his mouth, and tries not to act as though he’s never done this before.
"John...mmmm...more."
“What?”
is in perfect clarity.
“Here we are. if he’s sleeping, don’t wake him. He needs the rest.”
“Sometimes people cry when they’re happy, Sherlock.” John nudges his cheek into Sherlock’s hand, smiling. “And I have never, ever been this happy.”
, jerks once, twice, goes still and stiff, lets out a soft sob, and then there’s a sticky hand gripping Sherlock’s hip.
“I only have a thirty minute break,” He pants, slipping a hand past Sherlock’s cheek and caresses down his own flat stomach, palms himself through his shorts. He pushes up into his own grasp with a sharp grunt, and it's the goddamned sexiest thing Sherlock's ever seen.
"Oh my god. Are you alright? Are you hurt? Jesus, I completely forgot, I - "
“Please. Call 999. My boyfriend, he’s, he got stabbed, he’s down there. Please. Please.” He’s sobbing, wailing, John’s down there all alone.
“Absolutely.” John kissed Sherlock’s cheek and sipped his coffee, “Yeah, I’m up for it.”
He worked his way down Sherlock’s neck, swiveling his chin in gentle circles, the roughness of the beard scraping just lightly over Sherlock’s skin. Sherlock stretched and rumbled a low purr, arched his hips up just enough. John gasped as Sherlock’s arse pressed his cock into his belly, raked his teeth tenderly over Sherlock’s shoulder. With teeth and lips and beard, he scratched and licked and kissed every centimeter of Sherlock’s back. Sherlock tried to open his eyes, tried to make a noise, but he was weak with the pleasure of it. It was far beyond arousal, it was bone deep comfort, pleasure seeping into his pores, through his neurons.
. That it would be all bliss and sex and lazy snogging on the sofa.
A million mornings of takeaway coffees from Speedy's. John pressing Sherlock up against the flowered wallpaper, warm hands under his shirt. Mrs Hudson over for Christmas dinner, the three of them sharing pudding and hot toddies in front of the fireplace. Greg stomping up the steps with a case at all hours of the day and night. John reaching into the bedside drawer to get two small black jewelry boxes, his stomach muscles twisting under Sherlock's hands.
“Mmm?” He grunted back, already half asleep.
John sighs deeply and lays his head against Sherlock's shoulder.
sounds that make Sherlock’s toes curl.
You could.
She smiles warmly and pats his hand. "It's in your eyes, dear. I could just tell."
“Holmes. I missed you.” His voice was husky from disuse, and he cleared his throat as he pushed himself upright.
A cab turns the corner and Sherlock hails it, hardly able to believe their luck at getting a cab this late. They slip in the back, John pressed up against Sherlock and shaking.
“What do you want, love? What do you want? I’ll give it to you, whatever it is. Tell me." John grabs Sherlock by the forearms and pulls him down so he can kiss him again, and Sherlock moans against his lips, and John wants to feel him moaning, so he puts his hand against Sherlock’s throat to feel the rumble of his vocal chords as they kiss and kiss and then Sherlock is reaching down and wrapping his hand around John and -- “Oh Christ, Jesus Christ, god Sherlock, yes, god, just there, oh --”
The realisation of this makes him whimper - no,
. "Why today? Why must we do this now?"
“Good.” The timbre of John’s voice has dropped, honey-sweet and dark. It makes Sherlock shiver. “I want - want to. Can I - can we - before we have to go, I just want to.”
John looks up, fingers still gently stroking inside Sherlock, his face wet with tears and sweat, "We've just misunderstood each other for so long, haven't we?"
“See?” The man opens the wallet to a wad of fivers and Sherlock’s both placated and revolted, because now he must. Must follow through.
She drops a huge navy blue duffel bag on the floor with a thump. “I brought you some clothes. Didn’t have much time while mum and dad were at work, but, I managed to empty a few drawers and grab your trainers and a pair of boots.”
“I’ve barely touched you, and you’re so close already,” John growled, his grip on my hip becoming vicelike.
John laughs, relieved, and turns the light back off. "You okay?"
In the loo, steam billowing out of the shower around him, he squints at himself in the mirror. He looks like he was in a pub brawl. There’s a bruise under his eye where he supposes his face must have bashed into the wall, though he doesn’t remember it. The rough pebbled texture of the brick left scratches and welts all down the right side of his face. His bottom lip is swollen.
“I thought not.”
“No, love.” The endearment slips out without him even realising he’s said it. “We never really, ah, got round to a redo. I’ve been a bit preoccupied since. Mostly with you.”
Sherlock sniffs and rubs his nose, still giggling. "Yes. Yes, you did quite well."
, John. Fifteen months of this shit, this misery. How can you possibly know we’ll be alright? Stop saying that. It’s absurd.” Sherlock’s irrationally annoyed with John’s platitudes suddenly. With his assurances that everything will be fine. It doesn’t
Sherlock returns quickly, a steaming cup of extremely black coffee in one hand, and a fresh pint for John in the other. He slides in beside John instead of across from him. Their elbows bump as Sherlock stirs in sugar, and John allows one hand to fall casually onto Sherlock’s knee under the table. Sherlock’s pleased little smile, the slight reddening of the tips of his ears, infuses John’s whole body with a quiet kind of joy. He keeps surprising himself, his capacity for happiness growing exponentially the longer he’s home, the longer he’s with Sherlock.
"You're allowed to smile, Sherlock." John sips his coffee, feeling more at ease than he has in a very long time. He excels at this, clearing the Great Brain of clutter, focusing it on himself, on the transport, on being a good boy. It's focus for John, too, the world outside themselves falling away so easily. Nothing exists right now except Sherlock and John, in this moment together. There could be an apocalypse, and as long as Baker Street was still standing, John wouldn't notice.
“Ah, you’re lovely,” John whispers, slicking his cock with petroleum and shivering hard, curling his shoulders as his touches himself. He exhales a long calming breath, his cheeks very pink, and takes hold of Sherlock’s hips, tilts them up so Sherlock’s shoulder blades press into the mattress as his arse slides onto John’s bent knees. He leans down over Sherlock, bracing himself on one arm. “Lovely. I -
, John." Sherlock's voice is trembling.
"You love it." John's voice was full of pleased incredulity. "You're crazy about it."
All the thanks in the world to my darling CaitlinFairchild for her brilliant beta work, as always. She makes me better than I ever think I can be.
Sherlock’s wounded eyes had turned on him, grey and golden and lovely, making John feel horrible for having said that.
"Yeah, yes, I hear you." Sherlock can't wrap his mind around this John. He expected John to be upset, sad, a bit angry. But John is looming, dominating, unarguably in charge.
"I wouldn't hear you."
gentlemen’s contact information, if you’d be so kind. They walked up on scene as we were pulling in.”
. This smell is wet coats dripping off in the entryway on a fall afternoon, and apples crisp and cold, bitten into on the walk home from the shop, this is John’s hands in Sherlock’s hair cuddled under the comforter on a chilly morning, and his blue eyes illuminated by the flickering firelight. This smell is brilliantly complicated and primally simple. Sherlock’s never smelled anything like this before.
“Just in case.”
“I love you,” John gasps, his hips lifting off the mattress as his head spins, his nerve endings drowning in endorphins. His blood feels as slow and thick as treacle, even as his second orgasm in less than an hour gathers tight and sharp at the base of his spine.
to be what John needs. Sherlock forces down the slight shiver of panic at the back of his throat.
“But the anxiety is coming up and you need me to stop it? Need to let go a bit?"
"It hasn't quite worked out the way you had anticipated."
"I can't thank you enough, for what you did for Sherlock. For us." John shakes her hand firmly, covers it with his left and holds it. "This is -- unbelievably kind."
John. John is the opposite. John makes Sherlock remember who he used to be, remember that there is good in him. John makes him feel strong and sure, makes him believe the world isn't as grim as it can sometimes seem. John believes in Sherlock, believes he's something special. Even if Sherlock can't quite believe that about himself yet. John will believe enough for the both of them, for now.
. He’s flirting. It’s been so long, so long since anyone’s been playful with Sherlock like this, he didn’t even comprehend. Jim was the last one, but his teasing always had an element of cruelty woven into the joke. John's good natured, as different from Jim as it's possible to be.
“Would you like your gun, dear?” Sherlock grins, sly and proud, and slips something from his coat, slides it carefully across the red vinyl seat.
“No, no. It’s alright.” Sherlock stood up and walked over to her, pushing the door all the way open. “Come in.”
, and
how much this means, how long he’s been waiting.
"It's perfect. When?" Sherlock breathes, half looking at John, but also now running his nose along the edge of the collar, scenting the leather.
“Tease. You are an insufferable tease, Sherlock Holmes.” His voice was already low and gruff, and he was shifting restlessly in his seat. His sizeable erection - his cock was beautifully formed, just as was the rest of him - was tenting his thin nightshirt, and I could sense how much he wanted to take himself in hand, as he slid both palms down over his hips and dug his thumbs into his thighs.
“I know. I do. Believe me.” Sherlock took John’s still bruised hand in his and kissed it softly. “Soon. Soon we’ll be out of here and this will all be behind us, and we can think about other things.”
He looks at himself in the mirror, smoothes his hair. He feels like he's getting ready to go on a blind date. Which it actually sort of is. He's no idea what Sherlock is going to say, what he's going to say. His stomach is churning.
Sherlock nods, his eyes screwed shut, his body twisting and arching, pushing into John's hand. "And then - you'd touch me, like you are now - and more - "
“I don’t know. I just know we have an hour until we have to be back in our dorms, and I’d like to spend it with you. If that’s alright?” John’s voice is husky and low, and it sends shivers down Sherlock’s spine.
. Everything else is ancillary, Sherlock. You know what my favourite thing in the world is?”
“Yes, fine. Thank you, Mrs Hudson.” How he manages to sound so normal is a bloody miracle.
Sherlock was leaning up against the cold windows, hands templed over his mouth. John had just returned from a CT scan and an x-ray of his ribs, and was sitting upright in the bed with a cup of coffee from the hospital cafeteria. He sipped it, casting glances over at Sherlock as the doctor spoke. It was as if he expected Sherlock to disappear in a cloud of smoke at any second.
“John, what are you
John shook his head and pulled his bottom lip between his teeth. “Just - the air, the water, the dirt - it all smells so different here. I remember this smell. I
“Yes, John.” A wash of something akin to calm settles over him, though he’s still shaking with tension and his head is pounding. John’s in control. John's right, John has to be right.
When the cup is almost empty, John says very quietly, "Do you still want to?"
, nose buried in the humid pheromone laden juncture of John’s neck and shoulder, cock buried deep inside the warmth of John’s body, intoxicated by the way their bodies fit together as though they were made to do just this.
“That’s fucking creepy, Lester. Blink.” John put the cup down on the plastic tray table beside the bed. Beige. Like everything else in this godforsaken place. “Thanks for the water.”
"That was incredible."
"You go. I can't move yet." Sherlock let his arms flop back on the pillow, his body leaden with endorphins.
me right now, Sherlock? This. This fucked up disaster of a person right here - it's because I thought I lost you. You idiot. Yes. I fucking love you so much it almost
He stretched, the healing bite mark on his shoulder pulling, new skin taut and inflexible. A slow smile spread across his face. He shivered slightly, thinking of that morning just a week previous, and also in anticipation of what he and Sherlock had agreed on for this evening. He squirmed, trying to get comfortable sitting down, which wasn’t really possible at the moment. A habitual glance at the clock again. Sherlock should have been home an hour ago.
The next morning, he woke up cramped and freezing, feeling like he’d survived a violent car wreck.
“Of course you were.” Sherlock murmurs, fond.
Finally Harry stretched and yawned, and with reluctant sighs they moved apart, the intimacy interrupted. Harry gave them a knowing smirk, her eyes raccooned by smeared mascara, and patted John's leg.

Sherlock, I know we’ll be together forever, and I just want to make it official. No, no, that’s all wrong. Goddammit, I sound like an
“We’re both idiots.”
John wordlessly tossed the pack in his lap. They sat in silence, smoking, a frigid wind sweeping through the room. Sherlock got up and threw the Belstaff on, covered John with an extra blanket. He sat back down, waiting.
A hot frission of electricity zinged down Sherlock’s spine, his cock twitching against his thigh, as John let out a long low groan and yanked at Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock looked up just in time to see John’s nearly agonised sob, his teeth buried in his bottom lip, his eyes rolled back, the beautiful curve of that muscular back arching off the bed. Immediately his mouth was filled with the heat of John’s release, and he shut his own eyes, swallowing around John’s pulsing cock.
. How are you like this?”
the image that capturing all this attention at the moment. John half undressed, sweaty and unshowered, pressing Sherlock face first up against some ratty old locker, the beard dragging harsh against his neck.
John tilted his head and looked at him questioningly. “You okay?”
. "You have never said a word about any of this before."
"So are you."
. No. Of course not.” Sherlock shakes his head rapidly, uncomfortable, his eyes serious and vaguely melancholy. “Just hadn’t been the right time. We’ve been a trifle busy, if you hadn’t noticed.”
John hails a cab.
John kisses Sherlock's chest, and leans over the side of the bed, fumbles at the bag and manages to hook it with one finger while Sherlock runs his toes up the inside of his thighs, "I think we need these."
"I could
"John and I have discussed very little, if you want the truth, dear brother. So no, he doesn't. He'll find out in time, when we're both ready. It's none of your concern, that's our private matter, alright?" Sherlock's voice rose, and he carded one large hand frantically through his curls, tugging on the ends. "Don't come here, Mycroft. John's not...we don't need company right now. I''ll come to you. Mrs Hudson can watch after him."
John's smile is slow and sweet, his eyes heavy lidded, as he tilts his head to the side and draws a fingertip over the pout of Sherlock's lower lip. So quiet Sherlock can barely hear him, "I know. I love you too."
The cab came to squealing stop outside a grubby looking flat motel, squat and green. The paint was peeling, windows dirty. Cars in the U-shaped car park were old and rusty and abused. There was a homeless person asleep in a blanketed lump on the bus stop bench out front.
"Is that why Malvo recruited me?"
John hums again, placing a lingering kiss on the nape of Sherlock’s neck, moustache tickling already goose-bumped skin, and noses up into his hair. “God, I love you in the mornings. I mean, Christ, I love you all the time, but - you’re so -
“You’re pushing him too hard and he’s going to snap. I’m taking him home, and I don’t want a single text or call from any of you lot, understand? He needs a break. We’ll be in touch tomorrow.” Captain voice. Rough and firm, brooking no argument.
with him? You let him use you, mistreat you?
“Well. He’ll - punish me a bit first. I don’t mean physically!” Sherlock nearly shouts, voice rising automatically as he watches the red blotches of fury breaking out across John’s cheeks and throat. He takes a deep breath, measuring his tone. “I just mean - he’ll not let me have what we had before. I’ll have to earn his trust again. Hopefully before he accepts me back completely, it’ll be over. And I won’t have to - do anything. You know.”
"John, I'm reading." Sherlock pushes half heartedly at John's head, which is now buried in the curve of Sherlock's spine. He's trying for exasperation, but he thinks maybe he's not getting it right, because all he can feel is blindingly strong affection as John's warm lips press all over his back.
- they’re
“John Watson. John. Hamish. Watson."
Lulled by the sweetness of that memory, John allows himself to fall asleep, one hand still twined in Sherlock’s hair.
“No.” Sherlock huffs a laugh, despite the gravity of the moment. He imagines the look on Molly’s face if someone suggested they were dating; she’d laugh and punch his arm.
"John, I assure you I'm not judging you. I'm simply trying to extract maximum information, and understand the nature of what you thought you'd be doing in America."
“Not liable to lose my shit and shoot you?” John laughs again, only half joking. He tucks the sig quickly at the small of his back and drags his cardigan down to cover it.
“You are about twelve years old, you know that?” He grinned at Sherlock as they pulled into a parking spot. “People think you’re this intimidating genius, and really you’re just a filthy minded adolescent who gets bored enough sometimes to blow up our microwave.”
“Good, John?”
He was floating. The room went hazy, and he let his head roll back on his neck. This must be what Sherlock felt like when John took control. Free. Blissful. There was suddenly heat and wet closed over the cut, and his arm was throbbing, a deep ache spreading through his forearm down to his wrist. He rolled his head forward and lazily opened his eyes. Sherlock’s black mop laying over John's arm, his bent back shining with perspiration, suckling the blood from John's open skin.
“I don’t want to hear her name in our bed.” Sherlock says fiercely, his fingers stopping their lazy stroking.
"Hey, beautiful." John's voice is huskier and deeper than normal, and Sherlock reaches up to touch a fingertip to the center of his lower lip.
idea why. Where’s your phone?”
They sit in silence, cradling their coffees in cold stiff hands, Sherlock mindlessly rubbing the arch of John’s right foot with his thumb, Harry staring off into the distance and occasionally tapping the end of her nose with her cigarette. It’s companionable, familial. The last time Sherlock felt this peaceful was that first night with John, which feels a forever ago.
, John.”
"What a ridiculous question, John Watson! I don't put up with either of you. I
The cabbie’s bloody face melted into smooth pale lines and translucent grey ringed with black. The lump that rose up in his throat was even more unwelcome than usual. His eye twitched.
John closed his lips around the end of Sherlock’s tongue and sucked, and it was Sherlock’s turn to gasp. There was a tightness growing between his legs, and he knew they had to put an end to this, but the tingling in his groin seemed to be making it hard to think rationally. He had wanted this for so long, not dared to dream it would actually happen, that John would want him. The feeling John’s mouth on his own was earth-shakingly intense. John’s lips were so ruined, bloody and scabbed. Sherlock could feel every rope of shredded skin under his tongue. It was the most beautiful feeling. He didn’t think anything about John could ever not be beautiful again.
“All these years, and I still don’t excite you as much as a goddamned police cruiser.”
"Yes." Sherlock's smile presses into John's stomach.
He flushed, looking somewhat embarrassed, and shrugged. “The bed didn’t seem half as welcoming without you in it.”
"What?" His stomach cramps as assuredly as if Jim had landed a hard punch in it. This isn't right. This is far too forgiving. Jim would never give up the opportunity to punish him, to mock him.
, and Sherlock can’t look away.
Sherlock, certainly. Mostly Sherlock. Though they'd certainly struggled and fought for what they had. Mrs Hudson understood John intuitively, without him having to spell anything out for her, as did Greg. Greg probably knew John the best, after Sherlock. Greg understood because he was the same kind of man, deceptively uncomplicated. He and John had recognised each other for what they were immediately, bonded over it before they even really opened up to one another. Sherlock had occasional fits of jealousy over John’s closeness with Greg, but John would always laugh it away as he wrapped his hand around the back of Sherlock’s neck and pulled him down to twine their tongues together.
Sherlock flips off and lays on his back next to John, spreads his legs with one knee bent towards the ceiling and one flat against the bed. He watches John expectantly, eyes burning with lust and love and more complicated emotions that they'll have time and hopefully courage to discuss later. He spreads his thighs wider, grabs John's wrist and puts his hand against the heat between his legs. John's cock throbs and there's heat pooling in his thighs and his belly and god he doesn't even want to do this right, he just wants to shove into Sherlock as hard as he can.
Sherlock strides away. Something hurts, something...about leaving this innocent little creature in the alley by himself.
“Well...I know I don’t cut quite the dashing figure I used to…” Sherlock pats his nonexistent belly as they draw apart.
" John's fingers snake between Sherlock's and squeeze. "Better than I've been, maybe in forever."
“Oh, same, thanks.” He ducked his head, avoided making eye contact.
John swirls his thumb in the wetness at the head of Sherlock’s cock and drags it across the slit. Sherlock’s body goes stiff immediately and he cries out a choked noise that sounds almost surprised as he spills hot and thick over John’s fingers.
He bit his suddenly trembling lip. He wasn’t the only one to have pain, the only one to bear loss. For the first time in so long, with this random interaction with a nurse whose name he would probably never know, he took a breath in as John Watson. He felt...himself...if only for a brief second.
The first few days of term pass in a blur, as they usually do. Determining the best routes to get to classes on time, and readjusting to the daily load of homework after a long summer without it, is dizzyingly exhausting. The first Friday of term, Sherlock finds himself half dozing by the fire in the Hufflepuff common room, the rosy light of sunset filtering down through the freshly cleaned round windows. He stretches his bare feet out on the warm wooden floorboards and rolls up the parchment he’d been working on for Potions. It can wait, not due for a week, anyway. The fire crackles and spits, flickering hypnotically against the copper coloured brick of the hearth.
"We will be. Later. Let's pick out your professor's jacket. I was thinking corduroy. Red. You look good in red." Sherlock draped himself over John’s knees to retrieve the laptop from the floor, and John’s hand was immediately snaking under his shirt, crawling fingertips up his spine. A tingle radiated through his nerve endings wherever John’s fingers touched his bare skin, and he couldn’t hide the shiver.
“You talked to the police?”
They have so little time before the world intrudes. Without allowing himself to think about it too much, Sherlock nudges his nose against the swell of John’s bicep, resting bare on top of the sheets. The answering grumble is quickly followed by John’s arm bending up to curve around the side of Sherlock’s face, knuckles resting against his hair. Taking this as encouragement, Sherlock parts his lips just slightly, brushes them back and forth over warm skin.
"John?" There's a soft tapping at the door. "Dinner's ready."
“Only with you.” Sherlock says sincerely. He burrows closer, runs his toes along the bottom of John’s foot, up over his ankle. He can’t get close enough. An inch is too much space between them.
“No, no. I need to - um, I’ll just get you a blanket and put on the kettle. It’s freezing in here, I swear. We really must look into getting a new furnace -”
“Where’d you get that? None of the shops around here will let me in.”
John frowns, his mouth twisting to the side. "I was sure I put the wood across that last night."
John moves forward, his small frame seeming to fill the doorway. Jim looks down at him, smirking, crosses his arms over his chest. Johns fists are balling up, his nostrils flaring. That’s enough. This is going to end badly, and Sherlock has his fix.
It turned into a foggy day, temperature dropping continuously as Sherlock wound them northwards and toward the coast. Sherlock shuffled through the music on John’s phone, finding quite a bit of cacophonous grunge from the mid 1990’s that he knew John must have downloaded very recently. Nostalgia for his teen years, perhaps. This trip had awoken quite a lot of nostalgia in John. Sherlock had found him a few days previous, sitting cross legged on the bed with a falling to pieces scrapbook spread across his lap.
and I slipped into your bedroom like I’d always belonged there.
"In all fairness, Sherlock, she had no connection to us. She inherited a house that could make her an enormous amount of money in rent - rent we can't possibly afford. We practically lived here for free."
He told Sherlock he'd be there when he woke up. When Sherlock's in his subspace, he's needy, dependent, can't be left. Shit.
John breathes deep. Finally he breaches past the tightness into the heat and slick of John’s body, and they gasp together as Sherlock’s hips roll up to meet John’s arse.
Their hands entwined, pinned against sweaty sheets. Sherlock’s sticky body pressed languidly against his back.
“What do you -” John chokes out, stunned and overwhelmed, his eyes stinging with unshed tears, throat so tight he can barely swallow.
John usually got irritated with it after a few days, complained that it itched, that it felt
something. For the first time in almost two years, he wants. He desires. Something, anything. No. Not anything.
Sherlock had been such an abominable prat, honestly, trying to drug him, locking him in that lab like a rat to be studied. He'd manipulated and used him the entire time they were investigating that case. He should have been so much angrier at him than he had been. That was when he realised how much he truly loved him. This man could do anything to him, and he would forgive it. Anything.
They whirl and trip their way over to the bar again. Sherlock leans his elbows on the edge and waves at the bartender. The bloke next to him, pink hair and septum pierced, turns, looks him up and down. Cocks an eyebrow.
He takes his time sending the email, words it carefully, beginning and ending with a profuse apology for having forgotten, and then shuts the phone off. He doesn’t want to talk to anyone. Doesn’t want to hear it ring or buzz or interrupt
“But.” The ball of tension is back, tight and hot and terrible, making Sherlock feel like he’s going to be sick.
The cottage was miniscule, traditionally whitewashed and surrounded by a rocky garden in the front. Towering pines ringed the back garden, black against the purplish twilight sky.
"Well, that's that, I guess." Sherlock flips around for a moment, seeing if any stations work, and then turns it off. "No telly. Sorry."
“Oooh, hi, Alchemy,” Rose coos at him, holding her hand out across the space between the benches. “I was wondering where you were hiding him, Sherlock.”
“If I’d known baking bread was all it took to get you so sentimental, I’d have banned the activity years ago.” Sherlock’s smiling, though, and John knows how touched he is.
“Sherlock. Sherlock. Listen to me.” John’s stomach is tight with anxiety. This is their first real moment of testing their sub/dom arrangement, and they're already spinning out of control. He takes Sherlock’s face in his hands. “You haven’t done anything wrong. Except throw the mug and yell at me, but we’ll deal with that in a moment. Not solving a case is something that’s very occasionally going to happen. It’s not a reflection on your intelligence or your capabilities, alright? No one will think less of you.”
John doesn’t relax, but he doesn’t say anything either, and that’s enough. Sherlock glances at him; he’s chewing his lip, shoulders tight. There’s so much more to him than Sherlock could have imagined. He’s not fucking angelic. He a fucking mystery. He’s a paradox.
"Mmmmm. Small? Hmm. That's definitely not the impression you gave me this morning..." John lifts his head and smirks crookedly, winks.
. His alarm.
“Oh god, Sherlock, oh god,” John’s restless hands settle on his hips. He’s flushed with arousal, golden and peach, glowing.
“You’re beautiful, my god. I’ve never seen anything like your face when it takes you. Never.” John peppered me with kisses, running his hands along my chest and my hips, down the fronts of my goose fleshed thighs. “I want a painting of it.”
“Okay.” John rubs a thumb over the hard bump of Sherlock’s sacrum and sighs, drowsy and contented. Sherlock says he always falls asleep after sex, and that’s true. The rush of dopamine is as powerful as a narcotic. He just can’t stay awake.
It was like a prayer. His own prayer. If he believed in anything, it was John Watson.
that?"
Sherlock tucks himself flush against John's back, so much taller that John fits entirely within the contours of Sherlock's frame. John tilts his head back for a kiss, deep and wet, Sherlock licking across his cheek as his pulls back. "Ready?"
Throughout dinner, their eyes meet frequently, and every time they do, it’s as though Sherlock’s entire body is alight. His limbs go wobbly, his head floaty light. Sherlock eats mechanically, knowing somewhere in the back of his mind that he’s hungry, but his entire focus is solely on John.
"I most certainly don't. I'm guessing." Sherlock flattened a hand on each of John's thighs and pulled, urging him to spread his knees on either side of Sherlock's hips. The solid weight of John settled across his thighs and stomach, so much heavier than he looked. The hard length of him nudged against Sherlock's navel and they both sucked in a breath, mouths so close they breathed in each other's air.
John’s tongue darts out, licks over his bottom lip and then the top. He scrubs his fingers through his messy hair and allows the broom to sink a few inches more, so he and Sherlock are practically nose to nose. His eyes are oceans of blue, endless and wild.
that. You don't go off and put yourself in fucking mortal danger without me, you hear me?"
Of course, pipes up the other side of Sherlock’s brain, that’s not entirely true. A laundry list of names runs through his mind, people that worked for Voldemort, for his followers. Voldemort himself, whose destructive and narcissistic nature had already emerged before he even got to Hogwarts. It’s entirely possible that a seventeen year old could be working toward some sinister purpose, of course it is.
to you in there?” John whispers, almost to himself. He rubs a hand over his face, tugs at the corners of his moustache.
to know he’s here. Why didn’t he say so?” Now that they're discussing this aloud, the nervous restlessness John's felt all day settles into a calm dread, the kind he can live with for an undetermined amount of time.
“Yeah. Where’re we going?”
John stretches his arms up over his head and twists round, bending his spine until it cracks rather loudly. He yawns wide and scratches at the stubble along his jaw, then slaps his hands down on his bare belly, rolls to his side and nuzzles his face into Sherlock's armpit, humming and making soft sleepy grunting noises.
John’s hips kick forward like he can’t help it, and his fingers skid across the thin skin on the inside of Sherlock’s wrist and over his palm, interlacing their fingers tightly. He nudges his face against Sherlock’s, mouthing lightly at his jaw in not-quite-a-kiss, and whispers back, “I know exactly where we can go. Come on, gorgeous.”
Wary again. What the hell does this kid want with him?
“I love you, too.” Sherlock murmurs, bringing a hand up tight around the back of John’s neck. His fingers dig into the hollow at the base of John’s skull, holding him there.
He had picked up the slipper, still stuffed with cigarettes. He’d rolled it in his hands for a while, smelled them unlit. His body had a visceral reaction to the smell of them, as if he’d just tucked his nose under Sherlock’s jaw. He felt calmer, less constricted with misery, just smelling them.
“Good.” John says definitively, and crosses the kitchen in three steps.
Sherlock licks his lips, breathing in hard sharp bursts through his nose. His chest is already heaving, his hard cock pressed against the soft flannel of his pyjama bottoms. John tilts his head to the side, taking in every minute change in Sherlock’s expression as John touches him. He runs his hands over his chest, down to trace the smooth planes of his hipbones, up to dance feather light across his collarbones and the curve of his shoulders.
“I don’t
"JOHN!" Sherlock tilts his head back and glares up at the windows of 221b, as if by willpower alone, he can make John appear at the curtain.
“S’okay.” John turned to him with a wide smile, eyes bright indigo in the wan sunlight. He pointed over a small ridge ahead of them, which tumbled down into a shallow dale. “That’s Drumchapel Estate. Beautiful gardens, big old manor house. Some ruins of older buildings. Harry and I used hike the trails when we were kids. They wind all round Loch Fyne and up into the mountains. I
John wants to punch him in his smug face.
him. John loved him. Jim had just wanted to control him, show him off, his pretty boy he had on a leash. He'd wanted to break Sherlock down, destroy what little self-confidence he possessed, and make him entirely beholden to Jim.  Jim had played the game so well, lulling Sherlock into believing no one else could ever want him the way Jim did. That he was a useless junkie and only Jim could love him. No one else.
Unknown number.
The minutes stretched out. It was approaching late afternoon now, the sun low and orange on the horizon. The room was diffused with a yellow glow that reminded Sherlock palpably of Baker Street. He tried to pretend they were there, laying on the sofa together, a fire crackling merrily, kettle on the cooktop. They would be, as soon as Sherlock could make it happen.
“Yes, Professor?” John manages, extricating himself from Sherlock somehow and hauling them both to their feet. He’s suppressing laughter, the corner of his mouth twitching.
After long years of deep friendship and unwavering devotion, the true nature of our feelings for one another had become nearly impossible to hide. Increasingly, we had exchanged furtive glances, hints, and flirtations that sent my pulse racing, and I was certain that Watson wanted me as completely as I wanted him. But I had virtually no experience in matters of the heart, and I was terrified of losing everything we had built together should my suspicions prove wrong.
“Come here. Why are you so far away? What are you, afraid of me?” John pats the edge of the bed. “Sherlock, come here.”
John must sense Sherlock’s eyes nearly boring holes through his skull, because he turns and looks directly at him. He squints confusedly for a moment, tilting his head to the side. Then recognition spreads across his face and he grins, waving and flying closer, leaving his confused teammates hovering behind him. He stops a metre from Sherlock and absolutely
.” Sherlock wraps his tongue around the ‘y’, allows just the pink tip to peek between his lips.
“Oh. Um. Yes.” Sherlock finally steps over the threshold and makes to hoist his trunk up to the rack. It hits the lip of the shelf and he fumbles it, nearly knocking himself in the teeth with the metal corner. Alchemy’s claws scrabble at his shoulder blades.
Sherlock can’t look away, filled syringe ready in his hand, his arm throbbing from the restricted circulation. He heart hurts. He can’t remember the last time he felt this, felt this connection to another person, so deep and so visceral. He wants to take all John’s pain away, he wants to murder anyone who ever hurt him.
“Then I’ll get sick with you, and we’ll take care of each other.” John’s eyes flash, and he pushes up on his hands and knees, cocks his head to the side and glares at Sherlock. “You really don’t get it, do you? That’s what people do, Sherlock. They
"I could never." Just the thought of that. Calling his precious Sherlock a slave, thinking of him that way. Sherlock is a fragile thing, beautiful and rare. He's to be treasured, protected, held with gloved hands like a priceless antique. "No, that's not us at all."
"Yes." Sherlock already looks transcendent, even in the awkward position John's got him twisted into. His right cheek is pressed into the sheets with his arms cuffed together behind his back, his eyes wide and glassy, mouth parted, his tongue running along his lips repeatedly. John's never seen him quite like this. So wholly submitted to John's control.
Mrs Hudson wrings her hands, "I still think they let people out of hospital far too quickly nowadays. You could have stood a few more days of being taken care of, I think. Well. Sherlock and I will take care you now, won't we, Sherlock?"
But John had woken up bleary eyed and sore-brained the morning after exams, rolled over and immediately grabbed his phone.
. "God, Sherlock. You are so wide open for me. That's perfect, love."
. Today.”
You won’t like it. M
"Now there's a bedroom through that hall and another up the steps, but I assume you won't be needing two." She smiles at them knowingly.
“Hm-mmm.” Sherlock nods again, seeming to shrink into John with each passing moment, his voice getting smaller, body heavier. He’s hit that edge of exhaustion John’s become so familiar with, where once he comes down, he crashes hard and stays in a deep sleep for hours.
Harry rolled her eyes a bit derisively, but affectionately, at them, excusing herself to the hallway as they kissed goodbye with soft lips and achingly tender noises as if they were leaving one another for much longer than an hour or so. John's tongue pink hot perfect touching the very edge of Sherlock's lower lip, his eyes laden with want as Sherlock pulled back. Sherlock dropped a kiss to the tip of his nose and left, feeling John's eyes following him out the door. Harry silently brushed her hand down his arm as he passed her, and he squeezed her fingers. These Watsons. He was rather beginning to love them both.
“I - I disarmed the bomb. We’re not - “
He skids down the wall, braces himself by putting his hand on the floor and it lands on his scattered needles and bags. He stares at it, his hand on a syringe, the black bag with the vial from Jim’s last night still in it. He could. Could just disappear down the trackway for a moment...
"Are our lives here now? Does it feel like home yet?" John's eyes are dancing with amusement, but there's a genuine concern in the depths of those complicated denim blue irises.
"Well, it's still not a good idea. You could start bleeding internally, or..."
John thinks he’s never in their lives been fonder, more protective and possessive of Sherlock, than he is right now. He would do anything to preserve this kind of happiness, which has been - historically - precarious and ephemeral. Now it can take shape. Root and grow and become something solid, this calmness between them.
He cannot, cannot cry in front of John.
.” John surges forward and up, his chair skittering back across the floor with a clatter that echoes in the small room.
I shut my eyes against the intensity of his gaze and inhaled deeply, squirming on his lap and trying to work myself closer. He sank lower in the chair, allowing his legs to drift open so that my arse sank down slightly between his thighs. Both of his hands now settled at my waist and he rocked me back and forth ever so slightly.
John bursts out laughing, and after a minute, Sherlock joins him somewhat confusedly.
“Have you been with him this whole time? Since he ran off?” She’s accusatory, angry. She blames him.
Sherlock slowly slowly insinuates his middle finger beside the first, and spreads them, crooks them, wriggles them inside of John until the noises escaping him have grown urgent and raw, his mouth open and gasping against the sheets. Sherlock’s face is burning hot, his body shivering, as he moves up John’s back, mouthing messily at every inch of bare skin, the heat between them electrifying, John moving and rolling ceaselessly underneath him.
John watched him go, striding methodically out of the diner. He was the kind of man who was never in a hurry. The kind of man who wouldn’t shake committing the most vile murder, would never fear the police showing up.
"Go ahead, love. I know it's not easy."
"Good." John dares another grin, and Sherlock feels himself grinning back. Something soft unfurls inside him, something dangerously vulnerable. This is a bit not good, this kind of trust in another person, but it feels inevitable. It feels right.
, and already he can’t imagine ever wanting anyone else, ever having anyone else twined around him at five in the morning, sleep sweaty and pink cheeked and beautiful. If he’s honest with himself, he hasn’t wanted anyone else since he met Sherlock. They waited so damned long, made every mistake it was possible to make, and still somehow miraculously ended up here, grinning at each other like teenagers over their morning coffees and trying to remember that crime scenes aren’t really appropriate places for impromptu blow jobs.
“I’m sorry.” John whispers, turning in the cradle of Sherlock’s body, twisting his head back to press a kiss against the wet edge of his jaw.
I both laughed and moaned at his suggestion, for it was, of course, precisely what I wanted. John and I were two halves of the same mind, as much in our personal life as in our professional one. Naturally he would discern immediately my aim. “Yes, oh, yes, John, please.”
There's no one, of course. He is completely alone.
Sherlock hums happily, his throat vibrating against John’s cheek. “Can I ask you something, John?”
John clears his throat, ruminating on exactly how he wants to phrase the tumble of words in his mind. “You make me feel very loved.”
"Don't you dare try that again." John pinches in the center of the handprint he just left, before moving his hand back to Sherlock's waist and resuming the steady pumping of his hips. "Just from me fucking you. You come like this or not at all."
“I know that.” Sherlock rubs his toes against the sole of John’s foot and wills away the tears in his throat.
.” Sherlock knows that’s not been entirely true as of late, but that’s neither here nor there. John’s been good to him long before now, John’s been the one constant in his life, the only person who’s ever put up with his moods and his rudeness and his unpredictability. Not just put up with, but appreciated. Loved. Treasured. John is good to him in ways he’s never even know how to be to himself.
“Believe me, love, it’s pretty obvious.” John chuckled and slid his hands under the waist of Sherlock’s pants, grasped his arse and yanked his hips forward to press against his own. “It’s okay you don’t say it much. I know. Now get your tipsy, beautiful self on that bed and lay down.”
“Yeah, problem?” John turns his head, and the tip of his nose brushes Sherlock’s cheek. His stomach contracts, a shiver running down his neck.
Always.
“Oh, for god’s sake.” Sherlock shook his head, not knowing whether to laugh or sigh at yet another abrupt change in John’s already mercurial moods. He could barely keep up since the kilt had come - John was darkly morose one moment and possessed with wild-eyed glee the next.
Now John was staring out the window, looking contemplative.
John’s chest and hips and spiky ridiculous hair, and that’s slightly overwhelming. He sucks in a hard breath, trying to process all of this, that in a matter of weeks, he’s gone from thinking he’d probably never see John again, to thinking John would never be the same again, to
“We don’t yet know - though there are theories. There’s much I can’t tell you. I was authorised to get your assistance, but. This is extremely sensitive and classified information.”
“Oh god, yes, yes, John,” Sherlock sounds on the edge of crying, his voice reedy and strangled, as he hooks three long fingers over the waist of John’s jeans and yanks them awkwardly down to his mid thigh. "I'm yours."
"...Mycroft. I've told you already. I don't know any Malvo. I met some weasley little man named Lester. That was it. No, John and I haven't discussed it...well, he's a bit fragile, Mycroft. Yes, fragile. Shall I spell it out for you? He had a small panic attack when we got home this morning, and he's been asleep for nine hours." Sherlock paused, pacing. He went and leaned a hand on the mantel, his silhouette tense and agitated, shoulders in a tight line.
John's beginning to thrash, biting into the heel of his hand to muffle his moans. Whimpering and pulling the sheets off the mattress. Sherlock swirls his tongue around the head, sucks gently in waves of varying pressure. John's hips pump upward, thrusting into Sherlock's mouth, his belly heaving, the flush of his arousal deep red against his golden skin.
A tall thin man in an apron came to the table, hands on hips. “Hi there, Lester.”
“Shut up. No.”
Sherlock licked and sucked at him, mouthing the rim of John’s stretched hole and curling his tongue deeply into him. John pushed back, rutting against his face, the pain in his arm now a pale forgotten ache compared to the searing pleasure spreading through his every nerve ending.
"It’s alright, love. We didn’t have anywhere to be.”
“Spoiled, you are,” Sherlock shakes his head and moves round the back of the cab to retrieve his trunk from the boot.
Sherlock crawls back on top of him, straddles one thigh and rocks himself down against it, a sharp shudder of arousal wracking him as he falls forward and their mouths meet again. “You,” he husks out against John’s lips, “Just you."
But they’re seventeen. Seventeen year olds don’t spy on their family and friends for Dark Wizards. They don’t do that. They’re thinking about what to do after graduation, about essays and memorising spells and Apparating without leaving a chunk of themselves behind. They’re worried about Quidditch and N.E.W.T’s, and finding places on the grounds to kiss where they won’t get caught. Sherlock’s cheeks redden at the memory of last night, John’s face so close, his eyes dark… No. No, he can’t think about that right now. It’s distracting.
Sherlock thinks of the pipe in the sitting room, of how many times they’ve almost lost each other, and how easy and right this feels now. John’s fingers curl into his hair and they kiss softly for a few minutes.
"So I'm not explaining this well, is what you're saying." A hint of frustration creeps into Sherlock's voice, his back muscles tensing under John's palm.
" Sherlock rasped, as with one final deep thrust he came, shuddering and digging his fingernails into John's skin. His nerve endings were on fire, white hot flames licking through his entire body as he shook uncontrollably.
"I know. Me too." The amount of love and tenderness surging through him is almost overpowering his want. Almost. He runs his hands down Sherlock's sides, and pulls at his hips. "Spread your legs for me."
There was a heavy exhalation, a sigh, and then the weight of Sherlock's head settled on John's hands, still enclosed in Sherlock's much larger ones. His curls fell across John's forearm, and John sucked in air, trying to fill his lungs. Sherlock's head was on his arm. He just couldn't comprehend any of this.
"You know how fucking impressed I am by you, right?" John squints at Sherlock, watching him as he hoists the telly on top of the dresser and looks for an outlet.
Shut up Sherlock. Please.
Sherlock hummed his assent, and made his way back down to the van. The moon had risen high above the trees now, having shed its autumnal glow. It was bright white and cold, bathing the landscape in an eerie blue light. Low round mountains rose in the north, narrow roads snaking through their valleys. Sherlock could just make out the square white tower of the Cairndow kirk. The only sounds were the scrabble of woodland creatures, the occasional hoot of an owl. Sherlock stood there, mesmerised, until he heard the "Goddammit!" and the unmistakable sound of logs tumbling over each other. He winced and waited a beat.
"No. Not anymore. Just. Not right now." Sherlock bends infintesimally forward, and for one shining second John thinks he's going to kiss him goodnight. Instead the motion turns out more like a truncated bow, and Sherlock nods at him. "Well, goodnight."
John shimmies down between Sherlock’s thighs, nuzzling at his chest, kissing at his navel and licking his belly. He loves how Sherlock’s skin tastes, like clean sweat and London humidity, the way the river smells after a thunderstorm.
good to see you. You look terrible.”
"Condom, John," Sherlock reminds him, panting, crooking open one eye, half smiling with his kiss swollen lips.
Sherlock obediently flipped himself, pushing pillows out of the way and flattening his hands against the headboard. He felt the weight shifting on the bed, John’s knees on either side of his thigh, and then John’s calloused hands rubbing up his back and down over his arse, his legs. He heard John suck in a deep breath as he scooped forward, the hard length of him pressing into Sherlock’s lower back, and then his lips were pulling at Sherlock’s earlobe gently but insistently.
it to take all afternoon, if that's what we want.  I just want to be able to experience it, not just - do it. That's all I meant. It's - it's - significant."
“And I’ll put on some coffee,” Watson smiled fondly at me, his eyes full of regret at our sudden lack of privacy, and winked as he turned away to build the fire.
“John’s gotten himself into a heap of trouble, hasn’t he?”
And I'm asking again.
Now he can give John this, show him how beautiful he is, how treasured. The crushing intimacy of it, the trust. He pushes himself up on his hands so he can swallow John down to the hilt, his glans rubbing into his throat. He chokes a little, but doesn't pull off, the weight and heat of John in his mouth so incredible that he never wants to stop. Cups his tongue around the underside, lapping at the vein as he draws his mouth up to the leaking slit and dips into it with the point of his tongue, and then takes him deep again.
Their eyes keep meeting heatedly across the small house, promises caught in the full swell of Sherlock’s pouting mouth, in the way John licks his own. Their hunger for each other has gentled only slightly over the years. Most nights still end with panting breaths and entwined fingers against the pillows, with John smoothing curls away from Sherlock’s sweaty brow as they fall ragged and spent against each other.
Sherlock.”
in welts and cuts.”
"You look turned on, is what you look."
"Oh, Christ, Sherlock."
“Just had a bad feeling. Followed you here. Come on, then.” John’s face softens, his lips curl at the corner, offers his hand to pull Sherlock up to standing.
"Good."
“Indeed.”
"So you do?"
"Fine. Good, actually. She wants to see me three times a week for a while."
“Sherlock’ll wake me, won’t you?
His forefinger was soon joined by another, which finger I couldn’t tell. It was all just pure sensation, as he worked me open gently, and then not so gently. The entire lower half of my body was throbbing, my thighs burning with the effort of staying upright. John thrust his fingers into me deeply, rubbing over the spot that made me positively
“Massive, massive idiots,” Sherlock murmurs, dipping his head down to find John’s mouth again.
Sherlock’s grip around him tightens, and John’s consciousness wavers for a microsecond, whiteness at the edges of his vision as every muscle in his body spasms and Sherlock’s voice is rough at his ear, “That’s it, let it all out, everything you’ve been holding back, come on, John. Scream for me, scream.” Sherlock punctuates the last word with a sharp thrust of his hips, and John obeys, howling raggedly against their entwined arms as he pulses hot over Sherlock’s fingers and shakes and shakes and shakes. John's howls fade into quiet sobs and then into silence. The only sound in the alley now is the slap of their flesh, echoing in the empty corners of the dead end.
Somehow both pants and nightshirt get removed and Sherlock finds himself naked and surprisingly unembarrassed about it. He always thought he’d be self conscious, that being naked with another person would be terrifying. But it’s not at all. It feels...oddly normal. Because it’s
He lifts his hips again, purposefully this time, and watches John watching him, his mouth still hovering hot over the crease of Sherlock’s thigh, his eyes round and dark with desire. The head of his cock smears wet across John’s cheek, and he groans, heart pounding, stomach clenching, his whole body thudding hot with need. John huffs a breath that ends in a moan, rubs a hand up the inside of Sherlock’s thigh, presses his leg down into the mattress, holding him there.
“Piss off, James.” Sherlock’s in no mood for this shit, these games. “Leave us alone.”
“You’re always welcome, Harry.” He finds himself only slightly surprised that he means it.
“Sherlock.” Purposefully assuming the commanding tone that brooked no disobedience, John pushed Sherlock’s hand away and took a step toward the kitchen. He was going to come before they even began if Sherlock kept this up, and he'd already masturbated in the shower earlier to try and take the edge off. God, what Sherlock could do to him. It was criminal. “Be my good boy and go in the bedroom as I asked. I’m going to get us some water. Mind me now.”
“Sorry, no further, not right now. You can wait over there in those chairs.” A finger, pointing past his nose. Everything’s all broken up, bits of people, chunks of building. He’s lost inside his mind, everything’s so jumbled. He needs John to sort it out. Needs John to put him right.
He realises with the sharp awareness that can only happen alone in one’s kitchen in the middle of the night that he’s
, the whole way, and tips him onto the bed. John curls his knees to his chest and opens his eyes.
“Oh.” Confusion pushed the embarrassment to the side. “You want...me? Specifically?”
You’re wrong. S
“Sherlock, yes, fuck, why are you even asking? I’m yours, I’m yours. I love you.” John’s fiddling at the hem of Sherlock’s tee shirt, pushing it up, and the touch of his fingers against Sherlock’s bare stomach is electrifying, shock waves shimmering through his every nerve ending. He can almost
John noticed. Of course he did.
"Yes. Well. I always knew
He swallows, trying not to let the mounting tension show on his face.
“Don’t worry, darling, you can showcase your prowess in other areas very shortly.” John turned on him with dark eyes and flashed a predatory smile that sent a shiver down Sherlock's spine.
Sherlock's hand in his. Sherlock's hand not rotting under ground. No, this hand was warm and real and John could feel Sherlock's pulse thumping in his wrist.
There was too much space between them at the moment. He needed John's body touching his. Sherlock inched across the bed until he could drape a long arm over the dip of John’s waist, and press his lips to the little wrinkle between John's eyebrows.
“Our trip to Aldgate station? You don’t even remember leaving Baker Street?”
He doesn't say any of those things. He just squeezes Sherlock's head in the cradle of his arms and kisses him until his lips are raw.
Fine. Thanks.
. It was so easy, in the beginning, so natural.
“Put the lid back on for me, love?” John mumbles, his face tight against Sherlock’s throat.
feels like an idiot, but John’s warm smile doesn’t allow room for it. “Alright, then where are we going?”
tee shirt. You said jumper, very specifically.”
“Oh. And now?” Sherlock looks up at him almost shyly, reticence tightening across his beautiful beloved face.
beautiful.”
think this has all been about me, you're more of an idiot than I thought you were."
"You. Us. I need -- I don't know what I need, but its not this. I can't be here." Sherlock's voice is strained. His mouth twitches to the side and his eyes are shining when he flicks them up to look at John again. He retreats into the kitchen, gets the first aid kit, and sinks into his chair, crossing his bleeding foot over his opposite knee.
“John?” I whispered into the dark.
than me, arsehole." John slapped him on the back and forced a laugh. He'd forgotten what it was like to do this, to unreservedly relax with friends, drink and sing and act ridiculous. He hooked a finger at the bartender, a willowy young woman with a double nose piercing and tattoos twining up her arms who poured shots at lightening speed. "Another round for this lot, love."
“I know. I will answer every question you ask me, John. I promise.” Sherlock held John’s chin between his index finger and thumb and searched those blue eyes he’d been dreaming about for two years. They were bright with emotion. Sherlock couldn’t tell what John was thinking. “Will you answer me one?”
John ruffles his hair. “Alright, I’m going to make breakfast. Be at the table in 15 minutes.”
John sweeps the pieces into his cupped hand, and dumps them into the bin. Now in a thumpingly bad mood after his discussion with Mycroft, he bends down to dig round in what used to be his makeshift liquor cabinet, and is in actuality, the dank space underneath the sink. Mrs Hudson must have gotten rid of most of it, because the space is much emptier than he remembers leaving it, but he locates a dusty half full bottle of Tesco’s Special Reserve scotch - he hadn’t been picky back then - and pours two fingers of it into a smudged mug.
“Sleeping on my side now? Alright then.” John shrugs, laughing, and crawls over top of Sherlock to lie down behind him.
John puts his mouth against Sherlock’s ear
SO. MANY. THANKS. to caitlinfairchild for beta-ing this for me. I was struggling with some writer's block, and she really helped me sort this chapter out.
John and Sherlock make it home, but nothing's easy for them.
“I could have. At some point, I guess. But, I stayed with Jim until that became intolerable, and every day that passed not going home, it just became harder and harder to do so. And then, you know...I needed more and more, and somehow there was never enough money and...” Sherlock breathes in again, watches John for his reaction.
kiss.
I thought we were
John nods once, quick and firm, and lets go of Sherlock's hand. "Absolutely. I can take anything these fuckers have to throw at us."
“I’ve got you.” John wraps his right arm around Sherlock’s side and pulls him close, whispering brokenly against the nape of his neck, “I’ve always got you, love. I’ve got you.”
“Greg hasn’t rung.” John says carefully as Sherlock drags the end of the blanket inside and shuts the window behind him. John is so
For men so hopelessly bound to each other, they can sometimes barely speak to each other without stammering.
it behind his closed eyelids. Sherlock's hands skim down to the top of his jeans and stop, and John pulls back enough to say, "You can touch my arse, Sherlock. It's not off limits."
Sherlock sucks hard at the smooth dip of muscle between John’s neck and shoulder, pulling his shirt collar back so he can get at the spot he wants more easily. John startles at the intensity of it, the sweet pain of Sherlock drawing his blood up, the prickle of bursting blood vessels; his fingers scrabble in Sherlock’s curls, trainers squeaking across the linoleum floor as he tries to keep standing up.
want to, though, and that's the most unsettling part, the part he can't wrap his mind around. It's never once been this. Even when Sherlock's fucking him, John's in control. This is completely out of the realm of John's understanding of their sex dynamics, but all he can really think about right now is Sherlock hot and hard against his bare arse, and how much he wants this.
It becomes frantic. John's pulling on his cock so hard it's on the knife's edge of hurting. He must realise it, passes his hand over the head of Sherlock's cock and smoothes precome over his palm and down Sherlock's length. John thickens in Sherlock's hand, and the evidence of John's pleasure sparks heat along Sherlock's nerve endings, the coiled tension in Sherlock's belly spinning wide open. His spine tightens like a bow string, bending him backward, arching into John's hand.
He needs a clear head if he’s going to be gathering intelligence,
Oh, I guess there’s the obvious things. The coat and the violin and the phone. But those are the things everyone sees. Anyone could say those remind them of you. This is about
John laughed softly, his forehead falling to my shoulder. He kissed me there, and then licked at the sweat rolling down my neck. “You’re not. In fact, I’ve never seen you more alive. You’re
"Oh yes, forgive me for talking about sex with the person I'm having it with. What was I thinking? You're such a bloody prude sometimes, Sherlock." John looks up at him teasingly from under those absurdly long blonde lashes and mouths at his shoulder.
“Sherlock? You okay?” John’s brow furrows, blue eyes shading with concern.
“You sure?”
, long liquid hot movements that draw sounds out of Sherlock he didn’t even know he could make. He feels like he ought to be paying attention, because this is their first time, at least to him, and he needs to
"Welcome home, Sherlock." He curled his toes into the tops of Sherlock's feet, picked up his mug, and sighed.
“Alright. Your car?”
“We won’t.”
“You’ve mentioned it once or twice.” Sherlock says dryly, without turning around.
“How long have I -” John’s question is cut off by a yawn. He stretches his arms over his head and throws a leg over Sherlock’s hip. Comfortable. Familiar.
A familiar voice sounds behind them, and they break apart as though there’s been an explosion. John stumbles over a rock jutting out of the ground, and Sherlock grabs at his shirt to keep him from falling, which knocks him off balance, and they both end up sprawled across wet sandy earth, limbs tangled, looking up into the curious face of Professor Neville Longbottom.
Sherlock allows himself to pretend. To pretend that it’s alright, that everything will work out. He wraps one long spindly arm around John’s broad shoulders, brushes his knuckles slowly up and down John’s bicep. John sinks closer, relaxes into Sherlock’s chest, his knee hooks over Sherlock’s thigh. Sherlock feels his breath growing even under his arm, his head getting heavier.
Lestrade sighs and clicks his pen shut. "I can't help you if you can't give me solid evidence, Sherlock. I need a reason to investigate this guy."
Sherlock muffles his laugh by pressing his face to John's shoulder as he takes himself in hand and parts John's legs with his knee. He pushes John's right cheek up with two fingers, presses into him just slightly. John arches and whimpers, the muscles in his back rippling, reaches back to wrap his hand around Sherlock's head.
want to. I mean, I assume you’d want me there to support you, or something.”
She nods pertly and disappears down the steps with a smirk on her lips.
"You're beautiful." He bursts out, unable to hold back any longer the words that have been living right behind his teeth all day. John flushes, his cheeks glowing crimson, and those unearthly long eyelashes flutter as he looks down.
“Sure thing. I’ll just wait out here until you have all that ready.” He was itching to smoke, and he had a phone call to make.
John’s good at sex. Not just the physical mechanics of it, though he knows he's good at that, too. He's good at the banter, the seduction, the sleepy soft afterward - all gentle fingers and tender kisses. Sex has always been intuitive to him in a way he knows that it isn’t to a lot of other people. His natural confidence in this space surges up in him, making him feel more himself than he has in years. He sets his mug on the table and picks up the Boots bag. "I was hoping you'd say that. Come on then, beautiful."
"Good. Alright then, now it's time for you to sleep." The tenderness suffused through John in these moments, when Sherlock is so vulnerable, so dependent on him, is crushing. He would do absolutely anything for this mad genius, who allows John access to the most fragile parts of his psyche. Being allowed this control over Sherlock, to place him in this space of complete submission, it’s the most profound act of love John has ever been shown. By anyone.
John's eyes shift over to Sherlock's, and he gives him a tight smile. Encouraging.
“Right. Nothing.” John leans back in the creased and worn seat, stretching his legs out under the table.
By the time he gets to Hackney Central station, his heart has stopped hammering in his chest. The number 30 bus is there, filled with the first commuters of the day. He fumbles an old Oyster card out of his wallet and prays there's enough left on it for the fare. The driver watches him with suspicious eyes as Sherlock presses the card against the reader and waits for the beep. The light goes green and Sherlock sighs in relief, flops down at the back of the bus next to a woman in a leather jacket and a teal green mohawk.
There’s a harrumph of frustration behind him and Sherlock’s hands withdraw slowly from his waist, though John can feel them still hovering at the small of his back.
"I think you did. A bit." Sherlock leans forward, plants his feet on the floor. "Are you angry with me, John?"
“Nothing so grand as all that. Just wanna make people feel better. Help them when they’re sick, or - whatever else. My mum - ” John trails off, his eyes fixed ahead of them.
"You're not going to tell me about what happened with Mycroft at all? Do we have a case on?"
He gives Molly a half-hearted wave and sips his cappuccino, taking another drag before he’s swallowed completely, so the flavours of both tobacco and espresso mingle together across his tongue. It’s sinfully good, and he sighs, sinking back against the wall. Alchemy jerks awake, scrambles out of his collar and takes a spot on Sherlock’s shoulder instead, sitting up on his hind legs and sniffing the air.
"You have? Because I thought that --"
Mrs Hudson looked just the same as she ever had, hair perfectly coiffed, makeup completely done first thing in the morning. She put her hand over her heart. “I knew, that you both were back, I mean Sherlock had rung and I could hear you upstairs, yesterday. I wanted so badly to come up, but I knew. Knew you needed your time. It does my heart good to see you, though, John Watson. Even if you look an absolute fright."
“You. You now,” I mumbled, incoherent with pleasure.
you,” John says, and rocks up on his knees to swallow Sherlock all the way down.
.” His gasp was barely even a word. He released my hair and dropped his hands to knead at my shoulders as I leaned forward.
Sherlock nods, stiffly at first, and then John brushes a thumb over his eyebrow and kisses the end of his nose and Sherlock exhales and goes loose underneath him, and repeats, "Slow."
Jim's hand flies to his chest and he bows forward. "I'd love to stand here in the doorway all night, but I would hate you to catch a chill, darling. You are a bit underdressed. Let's get you inside to warm up. Shall I put on the kettle?"
"Shh, just stop. I do know that. You're it. I just finished telling you."
Sherlock swallows hard and when he looks up at John again, his cheeks are flushed and his eyes are black, round and wide. Just the way John likes him, his wide eyed pet. John’s sweet boy, eager to please. Compliant. John’s breath immediately quickens.
"Thank you so much." John holds his hand out to her as he emerges from the cab, slightly hunched and very pale. "I'm John."
John notices his silence as they stop walking in front of a NatWest branch with an ATM in the stone wall outside. “You okay?”
, feel how every centimeter of his body is throbbing with John’s presence, the heady scent of sex filling his nostrils, the thickness of John’s cock inside him, the sting of his skin stretching. It feels somehow as though his entire body is expanding, evaporating, under John’s tongue and fingers and blazing black eyes.
John stroked him rhythmic and slow, every sweep of his fingertips sending spirals of pleasure singing down Sherlock’s nerves, stoking the fire deep in his belly. The sweet shivery beginnings of orgasm flooded through his body like a narcotic, making his limbs weak and shaky. “John. I want you, god, I want you,
Of course, Sherlock really had been on the side of the angels, regardless of what he’s always said, or how wretchedly he could behave. John was working for a contract killer and helping a man who’d murdered his wife in cold blood. Sherlock would never have done this.
"I don't know. It's not."
Sherlock wants to watch him sleep all morning, but his own body feels sticky and grimy, his eyelids gritty.
“It’s alright.” Sherlock pants out as John’s mouth comes to his throat again. “To be expected. It’s a deviation from social norms, certainly, to not reciprocate when your boyfriend -”
John’s hand snakes around the back of Sherlock’s neck, pulls him down until their foreheads are touching, their noses aligned. His voice is a whisper, “I don’t care about any of that stuff. I mean. I do
with you? Why would you do that?”
A slow smile spreads across Sherlock's face. "John."
He chuckled, tossing his head back and showing me a glimpse of those perfect white teeth that usually remained hidden behind his moustache. “Don’t sound so distraught, darling. I know how intensely you dislike getting rid of even the most useless relics. Our sad old chairs are happily lodged in “my” room upstairs, where I’m sure our infrequent house guests will enjoy using them as extra storage space. As for us, I thought we deserved something more comfortable for our daily use than flattened straw cushions and cracked leather. This chair, is, in fact, the reason I declined to go with you to your parents’ this week. I was waiting for its delivery and didn’t want to miss it.”
“It’s...interesting. I have vague recollections of people trying to make me listen to this at some godawful parties when I was about fifteen.” Sherlock’s own teen years were about as opposite from John’s as it was possible to be. Lonely and awkward, spending most of his time alone or with his parents. Mycroft had been off at uni, so he didn’t even have him for companionship at the time. Invitations to parties had been rare, the reality of attending them uncomfortable and tedious.
He manages to nod, somehow, even though his brain has gone completely blank.
"Really? I thought..." This is too fast. They haven't even had time to talk about it properly, and --
John sighed and nuzzled at Sherlock’s chest, curled his arms up around Sherlock’s sides and wiggled his hips so their pelvis bones were aligned more comfortably. “I think we ruined the kilt.” He mumbled, nearly incomprehensible with his lips mashed against Sherlock’s sternum.
“Yes, a bit.” Sherlock shifted his eyes downward, and John had a pang of regret that he hadn’t brought this up before. They should have discussed this during the week, but John was relishing his turn being submissive, and he hadn’t thought about how Sherlock’s natural tendencies to shut down deep emotion would likely surface on the cusp of such a momentous week in their life.
“Shut up.” Sherlock elbows her in the side and she laughs.
“No more.”
“Yeah?” John straightens, gives Sherlock those huge round flirty eyes, from up under his lashes. Moves forward and brushes his lips over Sherlock’s shoulder, nuzzles his nose against it. Sinks his teeth into it.
"It's alright, John." Sherlock's hand stroked over his flank, up over his stomach, grounding and soothing. "Don't be afraid of it."
Sherlock's mouth had gone dry. He swallowed and tried to talk past the desire rising in his chest. "Y-yes. More than ever now, I think."
"I didn't know." Sherlock says, just as seriously, his hands climbing up into John's hair, cradling around his face.
He takes a seat at a corner table, the wood surface roughened by thousands of plates, ringed with multitudes of coffee stains. Before he can take a sip of his coffee, his phone buzzes with a text.
“Go to sleep, John.” Fingers up and down John’s spine. Bump. Bump. His back is strong, muscled from rugby, a sharp dip where his waist curves in, a bit more pudge than Sherlock expected at the small of his back. Runs his fingers back up to John’s hairline, down again, enough pressure not to tickle.
Sherlock fixed John with an incredulous stare. "She's in her eighties, John. What on earth do you think she'll be busy with? Knitting? I think she can manage to squeeze us in."
"Oh, Sherlock." John breathes out, sounding awestruck. He stills his hand, allows Sherlock to thrust up into the tightness of his fist as he starts to come.
Tears are dripping off John's chin, soaking the collar of his shirt. He's never felt so alone since he stood at Sherlock's grave all those years ago. He can't think of anything to say. "Should I make dinner?"
He picks up his trainers from the sitting room floor and carries them, going down the steps barefoot so he won't wake either John or Mrs Hudson. Pulls them on quietly at the foot of the steps, not even turning on a light. He unlocks the door painfully slowly, turning the deadbolt lever a millimeter at a time so it doesn't make a sound. Exhaling through his mouth, he opens the door just enough to slip his thin frame through the crack.  The door of Baker Street closes with a soft click. The night is frigid and he's underdressed again.
“Mmmm. Well.” The doctor flipped John’s chart closed and hung it on the end of the bed. This entire town was stuck in 1965. No one hung charts on hospital beds anymore. “I assume your, ah, friend, is staying to help you?”
"The way." John grinds his teeth, claws at the back of his neck. His fingers are sweaty. "The way that."
“Nothing. Same thing it’s always been. I just fucking love you like mad.” John says it unabashedly, uncautiously, loudly - still vaguely surprised at the ease with which the words come out now, after all the years of not saying it. After all the times he said it only to himself, curled alone in his bed, or worse, in Sherlock’s dusty abandoned one, weeping and miserable. Now the words are sweet as sugar, warm as honey, melting over his tongue.
it. You say it all the time because it makes you feel comforted to say it, to repeat it. You feel that it’s a pact, that it’s meaningful. I enjoy hearing it, but only because it makes you happy to say it. But believe me when I say that I would never in my life need to hear you say you loved me to know that it’s true. I would never need to hear you say it again, period. I don’t, in fact, find those meagre words to be an even somewhat adequate descriptor for what you are to me, what I am to you. That’s why I don’t find it necessary to say
Not much, no.
“What?” Sherlock snaps. He can’t help it. Means to sound so much gentler, but so often everything comes out all wrong.
“Oh, yes, yes,” I begged, unabashed in my need for him, but yet still unable to speak the words he wanted to hear.
“Hugo and my cousins already have one. Sit with us, yeah?”
Sherlock nods, unable to find words.
Sherlock clears his throat and moves his fingers against John's lips. It tickles, the touch too light, and John grins and scratches his lip with his teeth, and Sherlock grins too. They can't stop looking at each other.
Sherlock smoothed John’s spiky hair, smeared perspiration off his forehead. John was looking up at him through his lashes, the silvery flecks in his cerulean irises illuminated by the firelight. The look in his eyes was intoxicatingly hungry, heavy with desire. His tongue darted out over his already wet lips.
Sherlock disentangled himself from John and fetched the wheelchair from the corner of the room. “You up for a little sightseeing to the canteen?”
“Ouch! That didn’t help, John.”
The nurse comes in seconds later, sees Sherlock is awake, and hurries back out to bring back a cadre of doctors and assistants. They take his blood pressure, his temperature, peer into his eyes and his throat and palpate his abdomen. He becomes aware that his left arm is in a cast, and hurts rather a lot.
Sherlock pushes his finger in all the way up to the knuckle and John’s coming, hot sweet salty thick pulsing all over Sherlock's tongue and soft palate, his hips stuttering trying to arc up, but Sherlock holds him down, crooks his finger inside to brush over the little bundle of nerves. John sobs out a harsh groan, tightening around Sherlock’s finger inside him. He’s still coming, and Sherlock’s swallowing him down, every bit.
Watson and I had lived together since very nearly the moment we met, our two lives immediately and effortlessly twining into one. Our more intimate relationship had come excruciatingly slowly, however. It was no small thing to trust another man with the secret interior of your heart, especially when a misplaced confidence could send you to the gaolhouse. So we had initially lived as bachelors and colleagues, and then many years as friends, though neither of us sought the company of anyone else after our acquaintance began. We were content to be exclusively with each other, every moment of every day.
“Sherlock, stop thinking about the case. You’re too tired to make any headway, you’re just making yourself mental.” John doesn’t turn around. Doesn’t have to.
Sherlock had curled his shaking sweating body next to John's, his head thick. The pillow cool and firm, white sheets and industrial strength laundry soap. John's warm fingers soothing his brow.
He swallowed down the memory with a lungful of smoke.
“Oh yeah? What do you use it for?”
The boy from the council housing, the boy he wasn’t supposed to be seeing. The sneaking made it sexier, dangerous. Jim’s naked outline, standing at the window smoking, staring down at the lush green gardens, angry. He was always angry. Or bored. Looking into those cold eyes now, Sherlock couldn’t understand now how he’d ever thought...
“Sherlock, this is amazing.”
Jim curses but doesn't loosen his grip at all. Instead, his fingers tighten, digging into Sherlock's windpipe. "You always were, and you always will be. You need me. How long have you been clean? A day? Johnny boy's never gonna stay with you, pet. He's going to go find some pretty girl and have babies and you'll be a funny story he tells to his pub mates on the weekends. And you. You'll be crawling back here to me,
.” Molly says quietly, her luminous amber eyes searching Sherlock’s face.
.” He took his hand from where it was pressed against my stomach, and put a finger to my jaw. “Kiss me, darling.”
"I think that's wise."
"You amaze me, John." Sherlock says firmly, his chest full to bursting with emotions he can’t name. He wants to say more, to tell John how brave he is, how strong and unbreakable, how proud Sherlock is of him that he’s made it through what he’s made it through and still be standing. It’s neither the time nor the place, but he vows to tell him later, when they’re alone. To tell him over and over until he believes it.
John's grin is unadulterated sex, his eyes on fire. “Oh, did I surprise you? I may be short and pretty, but I was also an army sergeant. I'm no delicate little flower.”
“I may not have a choice, Sherlock. I did get the living shit knocked out of me by two people who went on to have a bloody shootout with the police, one of whom managed to get his throat slit by another assassin,” His voice dropped and his hissed, “Who I happen to be working for. They might have some questions for me, Sherlock. Like, why on earth two mob hit men would be interested in a little Englishman who’s supposedly here for a nice relaxing holiday.” John watched Sherlock’s reaction, his eyebrows raised.
John threw his head back and laughed heartily. "More like your pale urban Londoner who can't go an afternoon without wifi and takeaway coffees. And there's not much heather in Dumbarton, Sherlock. Though we could take a trip to Cairndow, too. I could show you the cottage if it's still there." John leaned in with sleepy eyes and a gentle smile, trailing a finger slowly down the side of Sherlock's neck. "We'll talk about it tomorrow when I'm not pissed, how about that? Come to bed."
I can send you proof if you like. We have photos. M
Sherlock nods, his eyes closed, teeth buried in his lower lip. He allows John to pull off his dressing gown, to pull him up to sitting and divest him of his ratty tee shirt. His bare chest is flushed red and pink, oval nipples dark and peaked. John leans over as Sherlock lays back down, drags his lips over the ridges of Sherlock’s ribs until he finds one erect nipple and closes his lips around it, sucking gently and laving his tongue in wide flat swathes. He nips at it, pulling the hard nub between his teeth until Sherlock’s squirming, breathing out a long string of whimpers and desperate little noises.
Sherlock shot him a quieting stare, and John’s eyes widened, his upper lip curling. He was furious. Ten minutes previous, he’d been grinning and flirting with Sherlock, all boyish laughter and looking up at clouds, and now this. Sherlock sighed to himself. He always found a way to cock things up for John, even when he was the most well-intentioned. And this wasn’t well-intentioned - this was selfish. Doing what he always did - sticking his nose in, unable to resist his own insatiable curiosity. Too damn late now.
it, and he breaks eye contact, casting his gaze down to the flagstone path. He watches John push a pebble around in circles with the toe of his shoe.
"Okay." John breathes in, shaky and shallow, and kisses Sherlock on his mouth, his cheek, his chin and his eyelids. Sherlock sighs at every one, touches John’s hair and his shoulder, curls his leg around the back of John’s thigh and presses his foot flat against his calf.
John barely whispers, "That's it, that's lovely. God, Sherlock," before Sherlock's moving his hands to John's chest, stroking winter rough fingertips over his nipples, down over the scars on his belly, and John works to breathe normally. His entire body is buzzing, anticipating every touch, the feeling of Sherlock's skin against his own overwhelmingly good. He puts his mouth over Sherlock's again, mostly to stop himself from whimpering.
"Hey, yourself."
“Want you.” Sherlock tosses his head back, grabbing at John’s hip with his free hand, “Want you like this.
