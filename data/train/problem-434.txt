John looked around to see if anyone could overhear them, and then dragged Sherlock closer to the wall, farthest away from everyone else as he could manage. “Look, mistake is one thing. But constantly letting it hang over our heads every hour of every day is another.”
John opened his mouth to disagree, but finally just sighed and said, “I'm not.”
The train pulled to a stop at the station, and John stood at the window, watching the people outside cheer for them. Sherlock stood and walked up behind him, looking over his shoulder at all the Capitol residents in their ridiculous outfits, getting so excited about meeting the people they were going to have killed. It was too morbid even for him.

“Boy did it piss me off when he turned out to be alive. And boy was it a nuisance pulling this nurse crap while I worked on you. Needless to say I'm out of patience, so where is it?”
There was only one item he removed from this preserved site. A newspaper dated the day they left for Rome, opened to a story tucked into one of the back pages about some threats made against an Italian gallery.
Perhaps John was more drunk than he had thought.
“Not native to England, of course,” he continued. “Once called the Japan Rose.” He squinted at the flower, letting go of it. He turned to face John and started when he finally realized the lack of distance between them. “Why are you looking at me like that?”
. Why they had been pulled together, Sherlock didn't know, but he couldn't shake the feeling that this, all of
“You have to admit, it isn't the sanest thing someone's ever said.”
“Yeah. Me too.”
Sherlock didn't offer more information. What he was doing was destroying the first three dimensional manifestation of The Man. He hadn't been able to capture his eyes the way he had on paper. It was worthless. It was hopeless. And it was a reminder that Sherlock could not wish him into existence.
“What are you talking about?”
“All they want is to be entertained. Surely we're entertaining enough.”
“Why?”
What he did not consider was the fact that London offered him invisibility. He was not a physically imposing man, and the sheer volume of people in London guaranteed that he could, say, safely go to the store without people coming up to him asking if he was
John hardly remembered anything she talked about, since he was so fixated on her never-ending circuit of the meaningless details of his life. Perhaps she found them meaningful somehow? Or did she just not have any idea where else to look for something that would give her answers, fill in all the blanks space surely left behind in the wake of – he thought – his weak explanations.
He watched as men bled out around him, and though he stopped the world to treat their wounds, he knew that in many cases, it would not be enough, and they would still die soon after he let the world begin again.
“Let's go.”
Sholto had gone around turning all the lights on, especially in the living room, which he lit up brightly enough that it felt like daytime despite the encroaching night outside. Before he'd even bothered with that, though, he handed John a glass and a bottle, without question. It had been so long since John had come to see him, back before Rome, and part of him felt guilty for showing up now for such a selfish reason. But Sholto didn't seem to notice. He acted like he'd seen John yesterday.
“I assume it has something to do with Rome. You haven't been round lately.”
Today it was an impressionism exhibit, wall after wall of paintings that looked blurry and less real the closer you stood to them. But John had always stood far away from the art he'd come to see. Getting too close always warped your perspective, no matter how hard you attempted to resist it.
John made many remarks throughout the ordeal about wanting nothing more than to fall into a deep sleep wherever he could find a place to do so, but the reality was that he was wide awake, despite the overwhelming ache coursing through his body.
"Yes, Sherlock." John led him a few more blocks and turned into a small restaurant. It was the sort of place they always loved to go to. Tonight there were only a few other people there. On any other day, it probably would have been filled to the brim. John took a seat at a table by the window. Sherlock sat opposite him, against the wall. He always preferred his back against the wall, literally and figuratively. He stared out the window as the waiter passed their table.
In the cab on the way home, John asked, “So what are we talking about here? Homicide? Kidnapping?”
“That's prime real estate. Must have cost a small fortune.”
“What about him?”
“Do I appear to be someone overly concerned with safety?”
was doing that since there isn't all that much to find.”
When night fell, they lit no fire, and their conversation grew quieter. The darkness made them speak less, bringing out an instinctive vigilance in them. Dangers seemed much more severe when you could hardly see them. But no one came, and their night stretched on in peace.
“You should have told me,” John said from the other side of the cab as they turned onto Baker Street. The cabbie glance at them in the rear view mirror, and John knew what he was thinking –
"I just don't know what you expect me to tell you. The Met has clearly already decided what position they plan on taking."
“John.”
He hated his sentimentality, hated how much he missed those other numbered days, back in the Capitol. Even then it was hard to forget that they were pretending, that it was all a pageant before a slaughter, but those few moments when they could forget, those were what he missed. The thought that even that would be taken away from them in the end made him bitter.
“I'm getting married.”
“You had
He leaned his head down close to John's shoulder and whispered, "I'm sorry." And he thought of delaying explanations, but he had to add, "It was to protect you, while I took down Moriarty's network. I didn't want to leave. I never would have left if I didn't have to."
One day they were walking out in the gardens, snapdragons and Iceland poppies dominating this section of the grounds, crowding each other out in an explosion of color. Sherlock was telling John about the more hardy plants, the ones that could survive the cold better than others.
let me overlook something like this ever again."
Sherlock jerked his head around, glaring. But he saw John looking at his shaking hands, and scoffed. “Body's betraying me.”
"Tell them whatever you want. I don't care what they think." I had no intention of calling him out to his friends. I had already grown well-practiced at staying silent about all the things I knew about people that were supposedly secret.
“Good to see you as well, Sherlock.”
“A paw print,” John said, bending down and running a finger around the edge of a claw mark.
One winter, I decided, on impulse, to accept an invitation from the only friend I had made during my remaining time at university. I had not seen Victor Trevor in what felt like decades, even if it had only been a couple of years.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Since when do you work? I always figured you were one of the old money types that didn't have to have a job unless they wanted to.”
Sherlock had been quiet, saying nothing as John checked his wound in the faint light filtering in from the hole in the rock above them. But his silence was more comfortable than it had been in the past.
The idea of having to kill one of the tributes didn't bother Sherlock nearly as much as it had that morning.
Unfortunately, there were so many nights where John felt he would never be drawn in by anything ever again. Ella would say it was depression talking. John would say it was practicality. It wouldn't be the first time they had an argument along those lines.
Sherlock stared at him, glassy-eyed. John thought he saw his eyes glance at his lips, at which point he determined that yes, he was far drunker than he thought. Must be seeing things. Sherlock Holmes wouldn't stare at someone's lips.
“Yes.”
Sherlock settled into his old chair, still acting like a house guest. John hadn't even moved the chair an inch. He had considered sitting in it himself now and then, but it felt like a violation, like kicking someone's tombstone. Besides, it suited Sherlock better anyway. All John could do was to take his usual seat as well.
"Oh, this is that thing where they dress in costume, isn't it?"
As they neared the Capitol the next morning, Sherlock watched John stare out at the skyline. John was trying to not be enthusiastic, but Sherlock could see how impressed he was. Sherlock sat sulking in one of the easy chairs, wishing the train ride would last longer. He wasn't looking forward to the crowds that would be waiting for them at the station, the crowds that would instantly decide which tribute from District 12 they were going to root for. Sherlock knew Adler was right, but he couldn't just turn himself into someone else to suit the masses.
“I guess you're right.”
Regrettably, it was also a rather popular bookstore, and would occasionally attract authors for meet and greets, readings and signings. Mike had known Sherlock for years, and at one point he even tried to convince Sherlock to do a reading during a poetry festival he was putting on, but he very quickly learned Sherlock's opinions on such things and politely never asked again.
is hitting shelves?
“Listen to me.”
“Oh, God, what did he do?”
“Do you love this woman?”
John and Mary met up on the way to the Reaping later that day. Harry trailed behind them, hands trembling from nerves and withdrawal. She had that spacey look in her eyes that told John she wasn't truly all there.
“I've been trying to help for a while now. Lestrade has handed much of the Hickman case over to Mycroft, and by extension, me. Because it wasn't as if the Met was actually getting anywhere with it.”
How had they ever made it this long without this happening? Without throwing off the pretenses and crashing into each other in a mix of shyness and unconcealed desire? And if it had all been so overwhelming for John, what was this like for Sherlock, a man who spent his entire life keeping his heart behind glass and his body safely cordoned off from the rest of the world like a museum piece? For someone who always spoke with a sort of disdain about the physical, who said his body was only transport?
"Yeah, Sherlock. More than all right. Fantastic."
“And our second tribute from District 12...” John looked up. The man paused, staring at the slip of paper as if it were in a foreign language. His grin faded. “Sherlock Holmes.”
“Well...” She looked up the stairs.
He wondered if Molly could feel the worry radiating off of him from her place at the microscope next to him. She'd continued her work, only occasionally stopping to stare at Sherlock with the same look of self-loathing and longing she always wore when he wasn't looking.
Sherlock was about to step out from his hiding place and do just that when Mycroft grabbed his wrist and they both disappeared.
“Sherlock, I can't just send you back.”
“Is Sherlock even going to be able to focus on this case?”
“Mary, someone comes back from the dead and it sort of derails any plans you had for dinner and a movie.”
This was all fine and good until he was older, and looking for something to fill the empty hours he was left with when he stopped time. He could never bring anyone with him. He was always trapped, the only motion in a still world. And while some days he relished in the solitude, others the emptiness of the world was so staggering that he despised it. Of course, he alone controlled when he invoked this silence, but often he only did so because it was preferable to the moving world.
“Don't take that tone with me,” his father said, sharper than his other words had been. Still thought John was sixteen. “Jesus Christ, John, I'm just chatting with you.”
Sherlock noticed the world stopped less after a while. Whoever had discovered their new power clearly didn't enjoy it or felt no reason to use it as he did. He was sure he annoyed the other person with his frequency of use, but he was also sure they wouldn't mind if they knew he was using it to catch murderers.
John did a double take. It couldn't be.
“I told you to run.”
“Come on. Humor me with some District 8 music.”
Sherlock didn't ask the barrage of questions running through his head. All of them came back somehow to: How does anyone genuinely like me this much? There had to be a catch. At the heart of it, Sherlock believed that this would be intense but brief. John would find someone else, or he would turn out to be a serial monogamist, Sherlock being only one small dot on his radar in the long term. He was torn between the options of letting himself enjoy this brief period, these small hours, or facing things realistically and getting out now before more damage could be done. But he didn't want out. And he didn't want to be a blip on the radar.
JW: Yes and no. There's a certain catharsis, in fictionalizing things. I think it's one of the ways human beings cope with all the horrible things we have to see and hear. But the real world gets exhausting, even when it's your version of it. I needed a break from all that. It was time to get back to my roots, I suppose.
"In the end, it had been so easy."
Victor tilted his head in understanding, smiling. “So you're doing good then, yeah?”
“You know, when I first met you, I didn't really like you that much,” John said.
Sherlock stood and walked away, somehow knowing John would follow. He made his way through the shelves like it was pure muscle memory, passing by general fiction, self-help, humor, all the familiar signposts, weaving between various patrons. Poetry was in a back corner, an aisle partially hidden from the rest of the shop. It was one of Sherlock's favorite things about this particular store. Even though he could hear the other shoppers, the background noises of keys rattling in someone's purse, the whispered conversations, he felt isolated here, invisible.
Sherlock looked nervous suddenly, uncertain, an expression which seemed so unlike him, even though the reality was that Sherlock was unsure of things quite often. It just rarely made it to the papers. But John had watched him stay awake all night wracking his brain for answers before collapsing in frustration at the most ungodly hours, still hell bent on solving the problem as soon as he woke up again.
It was a cold, clear night in London, and the two of them were out walking through the city. Mycroft had called earlier in the day, wanting Sherlock to come meet him to discuss a case, so naturally, Sherlock had put it off for as long as he could, and walked right past Mycroft's hired car to kill some more time. Mycroft had texted him, annoyed that he was so obviously indifferent to the case. Sherlock knew what the case was about, but he hadn't mentioned it to John, which wasn't unusual, since he had a great habit of dragging John off with him and explaining why after the fact. Whatever it was probably didn't involve multiple homicides, since he seemed to want nothing to do with it. John tried to narrow down possibilities in his head – fraud, protecting someone from the upper class, government issues, international crime.
The car screeched to a halt behind the ambulance outside the A&E. They were already wheeling Sherlock through the doors. It seemed every piece of cloth that touched him ran red. John mentally tried to calculate how much blood he'd likely lost by that point as he and Lestrade followed the team inside.
“That I
. This will take a while.”
He shut the office door behind him and cast a distasteful glance at his brother, who stood across the room wearing an absolutely atrocious dark blue suit textured to look like snakeskin.
“She been like that all day?”
It took him far too long to realize that the shuddering explosion that coursed through the gallery wasn't a flashback.
“Can I ask you something? And have you actually answer?”
“Yes. I liked the way it was organized. It made sense to me. Everything was neatly categorized by types of species. There was a beautiful rationality to how it was laid out, and as a child you can't help but be struck by how amazing the world is in some regards. So many different creatures all supported by the same stupid planet. I had never seen anything like it.”
“By all means. I appreciate any break in the banality.”
KR: Is poetry a waste?
"Good thing I don't take part in that aspect of it, then," John joked. He heard a knock at the door, and walked away to answer it.
The staff either didn't notice or didn't care.
"You probably love him, and that is a goddamn problem."
"Why have you never done anything for Christmas in the past, Sherlock?" They were sitting in their chairs in Baker Street, each with their hands wrapped around a mug of tea, thawing out in front of the fire.
After a moment, he reached out to touch it, to close the book on his failed experiment. There really was no sense in keeping it alive, no sense in continuing what had proven to be an impossible feat of botany.
“My head is killing me, I need a drink, and I am
Sherlock spent many hours thinking it over before he finally came to the conclusion that had been hiding in the back of his mind since day one. He knew exactly what John Watson was.
"Out of nearly everything," Sherlock said, "Although admittedly, little seems appealing anyway." He clasped his hands behind his back and pretended to scrutinize the loaves. "Afghanistan or Iraq?"
And all this wasn't even taking into account the fact that John was trying his hardest not to mention The Man.
“You going to explain why half of the Met is here?”
“Why?”
“You live with him.”
“Aren't people who are in relationships with each other usually happy with each other?”
John took a drink of his scotch. “Yeah. It still does. That's why we don't talk. I got into a big argument with them about it some years back, among other things. It didn't help the situation.”
The empty branches of trees cut at his face as he rushed through the woods, his heart pounding in his ears, only barely overshadowed by the distant booming of cannons, tally marks of the dead.
“I'm not telling you to bare your heart. I'm telling you to get off your high horse. And I'm not threatening you. Yet.” She stood and walked toward the door, stopping with her hand on the knob. She looked over her shoulder. “But if I have to see you staring out your window or him walking around looking like a kicked dog for much longer, don't think I'm above it.”
“I couldn't kill Sherlock.”
The woman's kitchen suited her. She sat John down at the table and went about making some tea, introducing herself as Martha Hudson. John introduced himself as well, even though the paranoid corner of his brain didn't want anyone to know he had been there. While initially John had wanted to drop the ring and run, something about the old woman made him feel a little calmer, so he found he didn't mind the impromptu tea as much as he thought he would. She sat across from him, sliding plates of biscuits to the middle of the little table between them, wrapping her hands around her mug.
“You manage to talk to me.”
can go fuck yourself. I'm used to your jabs and insults. Try harder.” He cut his eyes away from his father to his phone, which flashed with a new message. He picked it up, lighting up the screen, never having been more relieved to see Sherlock's name. The message was nothing out of the ordinary, just more of their casual day-to-day conversation, but it felt like redemption in that moment.
John laughed. He guessed words like "pretty" weren't really part of Sherlock's vocabulary. "You know, Sherlock, you don't have to hang around here."
“Goodbye, John.”
“How did you manage to grow a cactus here?”
He heard the faint noises of the hovercraft that would soon descend for their bodies. He sat back numbly, picking up his gun. They could wait.
Between the indefinite Sherlock hiatuses and the fact that Donna Tartt publishes literally one book a decade, I have to cope somehow.
And he did, sitting up in a chair in Sherlock's room all night, in and out of a light sleep spotted with hazy memories of nurses coming in to check vital signs and push drugs through the IV lines in Sherlock's arms. There was a peaceful stillness to all of it, a comfort in the old hospital routines, the comings and goings of the staff and the way the nurses always quietly asked him if he needed anything. He never did, but he appreciated the gesture.
of them. The poet himself actually said to me once that all poetry was either about death or love, in some capacity or another. I can't help but think he's right.”
There was a boy sitting across the room from him. He was maybe a few years older than Sherlock, but he had the tired expression of someone who has already seen a lifetime's worth of sad things.
John was used to silences with Sholto, but they were always comfortable silences. But not this one. “You think I was in love with him, don't you?”
John's attention was drawn away by a flash of light from the stage.
"I think you're obligated by the principles of the holiday to not choose
debuted, he shut the world out. He was sick of being the one who stayed, sick of being the person used but never loved by others. Of course he had his family and his small circle of acquaintances in his life, but would any of them choose him over someone else? Unlikely. So what was John's angle? What was in it for him?
The silence hung in the air for a moment before John answered simply, “You're welcome, Sherlock.”
playing in his head.
While he was just on the verge of sleep nearly an hour later, he jolted awake, his memory throwing him a harsh reminder.
John shoved the ring into his pocket without thinking, not having time to worry about it now. He stood on shaky legs, thinking to himself that at least he'd worn dark clothes, so the blood wouldn't show as badly.
. She'd sent him a few texts, mundane messages that didn't tell him whether or not she was still truly mad at him. But he couldn't force himself to care either way.
"No one really does that. It's just part of the phrase. It's just supposed to be an excuse to do something nice for kids and have a good time. It's better than some of the alternatives. Most adults just dress in awful outfits and drink too much, and then regret it in the morning."
“It's a movie. It's not supposed to be one hundred percent accurate and realistic.”
“I share a flat with him. Do I really have any other option?”
Sherlock always knew the exact line that could torment him. How much did he know, even if only on a subconscious level? But it didn't matter. Hearing his voice had helped. He would have to call him after he got done dealing with his family. That auditory Valium would surely make it better.
“You were going to be a doctor. I see you succeeded.”
“That's...surprisingly emotionally intelligent coming from you.”

“We met through rather odd circumstances.”
"You know, he helped you for years. He was the reason your cases got solved. How can you even entertain the idea that any of this rubbish in the press is true?"
“2014?”
“Why?”
“I have an extensive knowledge of chemistry. I assure you I know what I'm doing,” Sherlock said.
. He'd had his own copy since he was fourteen.
He sat paralyzed for a moment, plagued by the thought that he hadn't made it, that the hovercraft had long since come for his body while he was unconscious.
“Because otherwise you'd be off somewhere moping. You're actually moping a bit
All those times where John kept his mouth shut out of fear, they were all quick assumptions. He was the first to admit when he was wrong about something, but usually his wrongs were small, facts and details. He had never been guilty of such a massive blindness before.
“Why does she want you to do that?”
He heard the faint sound of footsteps from somewhere farther down the train. Sherlock, no doubt, up pacing. The man seemed uncomfortable whenever he was forced to be still. John wondered if he was too nerve-wracked to sleep as well. Of course, that would have been a normal response, and there was nothing normal about Sherlock. John thought that might just help him in the arena, along with his detachment.
, it startled him.
Sherlock continued to build his mental catalog of John.
“Sorry about who?”
John woke to starvation clawing inside of him.
had done, until it happened time after time, always at his bidding. And while many young men would have panicked, Sherlock instead instantly recognized the potential of such an ability. He seized every opportunity. At first he took joy in some simple pleasures, mostly involving causing minor and humorous injuries to Mycroft. Occasionally he would only read for hours on end. Then he realized he could do whatever he wanted. There were no rules anymore.
“In that case, I'm sorry. It's not a pain I'd wish on anyone.”
“Well, aren't you?”
No, in nature, animals killed without a second thought. Whatever it took to stay alive.
Sherlock looked to John to find John already watching him, an unfamiliar expression on his face. His eyes flitted between Sherlock and all of the other revelers inside. He turned to Sherlock, started to speak, failed, held out a hand, drew it back, and shook his head. In a quick motion he stepped forward and craned his neck to kiss Sherlock, just at the edge of his lips. John had stepped away before Sherlock was even able to process it.
A chorus of No ran through John's brain. He was suddenly back in Afghanistan, seeing his “angel” for the first time. And he remembered his prayer of “Let me live.” Except now it was, “Please, God, let
One day John finally saw him outside, skulking over toward Irene's house. He stopped, locking eyes with John for a few seconds. Sherlock was the one to look away. He did it so easily that John almost believed that everything he had said was true, even though John had his doubts. It had felt more like a coping mechanism than honesty.
John only gave him a small nod, incapable of further speech. He went outside to wait for the cab in the fresh air. It was as sunny as one could expect from rural England, but natural light had never been as satisfying to him as artificial. He felt the book in his pocket, a talisman against evil, somehow, new to his life as it was.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sorry, I probably sound a little mad. I'm Felix,” he reached out to shake John's hand. “I'd never have met James if you hadn't basically forced him to stay alive.”
John waited for the inevitable, the explosion that always followed. In these dreams, it was always him, always appearing in Baker Street or a museum, or even on the streets. It was always him, in the same dark coat with the same small smile on his face, always looking like a better work of art than any man could create. And it would always be destroyed in the flash of an instant, taken away in a brief, miserable fire that would set of the sounds of cannons in John's head and leave alone in his bed, awake and shaking and holding his head in his hands. Sometimes he would try to resist looking at him, but he rarely could. Even if it wasn't real, it was still seeing him again.
John had said something to that effect to Mary, and when she insisted that the only solution would just be to go to Sherlock and actually
“Let's pretend for a minute that I did believe you, and I'm not saying I do, but if you jumped off a building to get here, how do you get back?”
“What about Rome?” Sherlock repeated. John only nodded. Sherlock cut his eyes away, tracing a finger along the arm rest of his chair. “While I was relatively certain that I wouldn't end up actually dying while closing Moriarty's network, I wasn't one hundred percent sure. That kind of certainty is never smart, and I'm not one for absolutes.”
More importantly, what would happen if they deepened?
? I don't have friends. I find it highly unlikely that that would change if I were to return home.” He fell silent, frowning as he fiddled with a loose string on his jacket. “Perhaps I have one.”
"What do you want to know?"
But then the phone rang. An explanation of the mistake, perhaps?
. Wonderful to meet you, Doctor Watson.”
“Sherlock?”
“Well, here you are.”
"Lovely, isn't it?"
“Of course you do. It's the
Sherlock locked eyes with the young woman for a minute, and turned away when she smiled at him. That was the last thing he needed.
Mrs. Hudson hugged him tight. She offered no platitudes, no promises that it would all be okay. For all her kindness, she had a realistic streak in her, and both of them knew there was no sense in sugar coating the situation. But she did tell him to be careful, and to fight hard, and despite the tears in her eyes, she stood tall when she spoke to him. John couldn't understand how a woman like her had ever been part of the Capitol. Maybe she thought that being a stylist would do the least damage, may even help someone. That was the only explanation John could come up with that would account for her heart.
Sherlock stood outside the morgue that Christmas, watching the crying family behind the double doors at the end of the hall.
She lunged at him, making her leap across the water. But Sherlock had half a foot on her in height, and he watched the change in her eyes as she realized her mistake. She hit the edge of the rocks on his side of the river, and though she scrambled, her hands clawing for a grip on the slick stone around her, she failed. The current was too strong, and soon she disappeared from view, falling into the river.
“Nah, you talk big. Nah, you're
“No, mostly just with Mary.”
“Oh my God.” Her eyes scanned his face. “I'm so sorry, you have the advantage, I don't remember seeing you anyplace after the fact, you know, ambulances and police interviews? Most of the people in our room who lived were all sort of kept together when they were triaging us. There weren't many either, just a handful of people from the Vermeer room who survived.”
He knew that the longer he stayed there, the more likely he was to be caught and killed.
“That's what you do, isn't it? On your blog? You're a doctor, but what you actually do for a living is tell stories.”
“How do you know I'm not training? Or maybe giving someone from a less fortunate district sound advice to help them?”
“Kate was fearless. Thank goodness.”
It was getting harder and harder not to tell him. Once Sherlock realized it himself, it became an almost Herculean task to keep from telling John everything. He had grown so used to telling John
She looked at the Baker Street living room searching for answers, and John realized that she really knew nothing about his life here, by the way she looked confused at the skull wearing headphones and the beakers in the kitchen and the mismatched furniture. What did all that look like to an outside observer?
Sherlock finally looked away from the memorial, almost startled by John's tone. John couldn't decide if he looked at peace or heartbroken, but it seemed like he stared down at him for hours, eyes running over his face. He raised a hand in the small space between them, and John didn't even have time to process the gesture before Sherlock's phone sent through a text, and the sound shattered the silence. Sherlock winced, irritated, and pulled it out of his pocket, glaring at it as the screen lit up. John was so sure it was Mycroft – who else could it be, really? – and he wanted to rip the damn phone out of Sherlock's hand and hurl it to the marble floor, shatter it into pieces as punishment for interrupting. But he couldn't do that, of course, however much he wanted to.
"You know, I can't recall you ever going out with anyone for fun."
“Sherlock?”
“Whatever.”
“Okay, what's the theory?”
One: This was a fluke of his own ability, like a short in a wired system.
league. You mean she's out of
“I might not have ever met Greg if it weren't for both of us knowing Sherlock.”
“It usually is.”
It was an awkward parting in London, much more so than John had anticipated. Sherlock had continued to verbally spar with him the rest of the way to the city, about a variety of topics. John couldn't deny that he was intelligent, if not a bit pessimistic. In its own way, it was the most fun John had had in weeks.
John knew Sherlock was watching him before he even looked up from his glass. Of all the stories he could have told, he didn't know why he'd chosen that one, but he was beginning to regret doing so, seeing the expression of detached concentration on Sherlock's face. His cigarette had gone out entirely, untouched for too long. Seemingly reluctant to look away, Sherlock pulled out his lighter to relight it while he considered what John had said. The snap of it, the single bright little flame flashing across his face in wavering shadows for just a moment before it was extinguished, replaced by the glow of the tip of the cigarette as he inhaled.
“What brought him back? CPR? Meds?”
John's eyes flitted to the side of Sherlock's face, and finally registered the blood. There was a lot of blood, mostly dried, covering one side of his head, staining his hands.
"Yes."
“It is.”
“A business associate of hers was a client of mine.”
“Don't you want to fight?”
And besides, to miss someone, you had to be alive to miss them.
Unfortunately, perhaps, so were most of their friends, including Mary. John had said multiple times that they weren't together, and that appeared to be true, given how they were interacting with each other. John didn't show her any more attention than he did Sally or Molly.
“You sound a bit delirious.”
“His younger brother?”
“I think it'd be nice to see your home,” she said.
So not a dream. A hallucination? Couldn't be, since the woman who passed him on her way out of the room looked at him, smiled. Why smile at thin air?
Long after John had fallen asleep, Sherlock remained staring at the two sentences that now seemed to mock him with a fervor with which he had not instilled in them.
As he approached, standing beside Sherlock, he took a good look at the two officers. And as their faces registered with his memory, he felt the familiar sensation of the ground disappearing from beneath his feet, of the ringing drowning out everyone's voices, of the overwhelming paralysis of both mind and body.
What do
He is bisexual. He constantly denies it, both to the public and to himself.
The problem with being able to stop the world, Sherlock thought, is that it would be much more useful if one could always predict another's actions. And he never predicted a madman dangling John in front of him, threatening to blow him to pieces. John had survived enough of that in Afghanistan. It wasn't supposed to happen in London.
“I couldn't protect her either.” Mike nodded, understanding. “Now, please, go.”
“Yes, but the world isn't only family, is it? I can recall all sorts of isolated little terrible events. Sometimes it's the accumulation of such things that kills your good opinion of the universe.”
“Yeah, they were together a long time. They broke up a while back, and, well, Harry hasn't ever been the most stable of people, and she took it pretty hard.”
The man caught him staring and flashed him a smile. It was one Sherlock had seen on tributes in the past. It was not a stable smile. Sherlock was beginning to feel a little uneasy under the man's stare, and he breathed a small sigh of relief when the woman reclaimed his attention.
They would take cabs nearly everywhere when they were working cases, though, so it wasn't as if he was walking long distances anyway.
That night, he stayed in Baker Street, alone, hating that she had picked up on the horribly temporary feel of their relationship. He made a promise to try harder, to actually be present when he was with her, and to actually move on, even if only a little. Because he hated that she was right, that he couldn't spend the rest of his life mourning. But there was no way she could possibly begin to understand the entire situation.
? It's a big
But Sherlock could not look on the drawing with love. All it did was frustrate him. Because while the man was an ideal audience, he was also a figment of his imagination. No amount of Sherlock creating back story and personality would change that.
“Look around. It's not chance. It's the game, Mr. Holmes. All part of the game.” He glanced at the dead woman near his feet. “They lost. So tell me, are you more clever than they are?”
“No.” A sharp edge came into his voice.
“It's bad for you.” The only thing that had made him look more horrified than the illegality of cocaine had been when he'd stumbled across a children's television show earlier that day.
“What makes you think I didn't do this when I got back from Afghanistan? Let me tell you, it is very easy to let your life be ruled by what happened to you when it was something like
Silence hung between them.
Which was why finally, John just said, "Never mind."
“Haven't you ever written about stars or planets?”
"Why not?"
John heard the creak of the final step, and Sherlock crossed through the open doorway, tugging at his gloves without looking up from them. “John, why is the front door –”
Part of him was waiting for the line he was sure John would speak, something to the effect of, “Going to tell me who Sherlock Holmes is now?” And he couldn't. He dreaded the questions because he had no answer, no justification for why he had started this the way he had. But he couldn't delay such an encounter any longer, let alone however long it might take for him to explain himself to another human being. He'd tried to do that with
relate to,” he said, and left without another word.
As he emerged from the blackness of the cab, he saw the man standing at his door – clearly just arrived and knocked, getting no reply. When Sherlock slammed the car door shut, the sharp sound drew the man's attention, and when he turned around on the small front step, Sherlock couldn't believe he hadn't recognized him even from his back and shoulders.
“No, I mean you
There were times that he zoned out completely while an audience member was talking, and he had to ask them to repeat the question. He could see Ella off to the side watching him like he had lost his mind, and John knew that there would be another conversation about his mental well being within the coming weeks. But he couldn't make himself care. Instead he kept trying to stealthily keep an eye on his phone sitting on the podium in front of him. At one point, it buzzed, and in between questions, he quickly pulled up the message. There, underneath the sonnet, it said, “It's Neruda, by the way.”
were reading it.”
Sherlock waited, expecting her to emerge like a monster, ready to destroy again. He looked downriver, looking for signs of her surfacing. But none came. It made no sense. The river wasn't that dangerous. And while it could certainly knock her down, it didn't even look deep enough to drown in.
“Yes.”
Sholto's house was large for one person, and remote, and the emptiness was palpable. John wished Sholto had a wife, a family, something,
“Busy.”
John heard a distant laugh and stopped.
“You're the only one in the world.”
“I would say so.”
“Yes.”
And as he ran, he wondered if he was going to find the devil waiting on him, too.
“Tonight.”
John's face appeared. He had his computer sitting just to the side, his head turned to smile at Sherlock.
“My mother studied mathematics, of course, and she taught it wherever we went. My father worked in foreign embassies, so we traveled a great deal. We never stayed in one place for more than a year, generally. I'm convinced that this upbringing is what initially led Mycroft to seek employment in the government.”
John set down the glass of wine. “How does anyone become anything?”
John emerged from the hiding place, looking around for the parachute, finally seeing it hanging from a low tree limb nearby. When he retrieved and opened it, he saw the familiar canister of water and a cloth.
But the museums, they were always calm and quiet. John wasn't sure what exactly inspired silence in museums, but he was grateful. The only other places that were ever so serene were churches, and he had had some difficulties where God was concerned after returning from the war.
“Don't joke.”
“I heard about your little performance in there.
She pulled back from him, her eyes watching something in John's periphery. “John.”
When Sherlock saw the cemetery up ahead, he understood. And he knew no good would come of it.
, something for symptomatic relief.” He threw the first aid kit open, glaring at it in frustration before throwing it aside, bandage scissors clattering on the floor.
was nature. Your own nature wasn't something you were allowed out here. He'd already done things he would never have considered doing before. Nature, be it a forest or a person's, was all just transient. You could never count on its constancy.
“How would you know?”
"Who's that?"
"Busy."
“Yes, alcoholic, correct?” John nodded. “Fascinating, though. Two women. Like the love that dares not speak its name.”
The kiss surprised Sherlock more than it did John, whose hand splayed across his back. But Sherlock wasn't surprised for long before his eyes fell shut, his thumb running gently over John's jaw. When John pulled back, Sherlock stared at him, blinking slowly. After a pause, he tilted John's chin up with his fingers.
John collapsed on the floor of his shelter, dropping the gun to the ground beside him. He pulled his knees up to his chest, burying his face against his arms as he hyperventilated. He fought back tears, barely successful. He heard Sherlock's voice in his head, bits and pieces of conversation echoing.
“Oh, well then I have no idea why
But was it him talking to Sherlock, or Sherlock trying to talk to him?
“I got caught up. I was busy.”
It even had orange trees shading some of the patio furniture, the fruit hanging from the branches like stars connected into constellations. And the courtyard was so lush with flowers that John could smell them on the breeze.
“I'll explain it all soon, I promise. There isn't time right now. Have you ever had a reason to doubt me?”
“More comfortable?”
John grabbed a hold of his lapels and jerked him forward, and Sherlock winced in anticipation of a blow, given the fiery look in John's eyes. But it was a kiss, not a blow, and Sherlock could feel the smile spread across his face.
“Obviously.”
"I guess I shouldn't be all that surprised. Why are you telling me this now?"
The cab finally came to a stop near a car park, cordoned off with tape. There were multiple police cars and what looked like hoards of law enforcement and forensics officials wandering around. Everything seemed to be a shade of gray, the sky fading into the asphalt, even the police officers' clothes bled into the puddles of standing water. The only spot of true color came from the bright blue shirt of the dead man lying in the middle of the car park. John watched as Sherlock got out of the cab, his coat becoming another point of gray in the monochrome sea. This time he didn't wait to see if John followed; he knew damn well he would.
I'm just going to preface this with a warning.
He pulled away, and I saw the look of terror in his eyes, like someone emerging from a fugue state to find a body at their feet and a knife in their hand. His hand remained on the back of my neck, but his eyes flitted to the floor between us. Barely audible, I heard him mutter, "Sorry, I'm –"
He mentally filled in the rest of the sentence that he couldn't bring himself to say out loud: something unfeeling like me.
“Where are you sending me now?”
have to be silent?
Of course, all John could manage was a chorus of, “
"Yes, well, as I was saying, dull."
He turned and ran back into his flat, slamming the door behind him and reaching for a cigarette. As he lit it, he considered his options. And finally, he stood at his window, looking out on London's busy streets, and he willed the world to stop.
He shouldn't have felt nervous having someone else in his home. He'd had many people over during his years at Baker Street, but this time, he saw all the flaws in it: the stack of newspapers in the corner, the fading places on the upholstery, the complete disaster that was the kitchen. But when he glanced back to see John's reaction, he found that John either did not notice these grievous errors or that he somehow embraced them.
exactly, but the longer he sat at the restaurant with him, the more he thought that maybe it didn't matter
John let out a somewhat frustrated sigh and shrugged as he crossed the room to take a seat in the second chair. “He sounded...desperate.”
John.
Sherlock stared at the gun in his hand, thinking. Finally he handed it to John, who took it and ran his hands over it for a second before he realized what Sherlock was suggesting. His head shot up.
“You've seen plenty of bad things. That alone wouldn't be enough to wear you down like this. There's more.”
Sherlock ignored the comment. Mike was always convinced he'd get along with one person or another. He hadn't been right yet. Although that was more Sherlock's fault than Mike's. There had been Sebastian, a literary agent who worked primarily with young adult fiction who appeared to be in a state of suspended adolescence himself. There had been Greg Lestrade, who wrote true crime books, but whose writing was so basic and his choice of cases so banal that Sherlock couldn't stand discussing crimes with him at all. He had gotten along half-decently with Molly Hooper, who wrote science textbooks, but she had been so clearly infatuated with him that it was physically painful. Oddly enough, the one he had gotten along with the most was Martha Hudson, his landlady, who wrote little domestic columns and articles for women's magazines. But generally, Sherlock dreaded any introduction of Mike's. He managed to find the strangest people. He also couldn't believe that Mike knew this novelist well enough to know how they'd get on.
“Have you had to kill anyone yet?”
“No. I
It was Christmas Eve, and Harry knew damn well that John must have been desperate if he was spending it with her. He'd shown up around five and had crawled into a bottle of whiskey with her, and neither of them had felt safe enough to emerge yet.
“However, when you inevitably split, remember that I did warn you.”
“Jesus, Sherlock.”
"No."
“Oh, a number of reasons. The ability to make my own decisions about my life alone is wonderful. I don't answer to bosses and acquaintances like so many people feel they must. I do what I want for a living. I don't have to expend all my energy on pretending that I enjoy the company of ninety-nine percent of the general population.”
“Not really my area.”
“You should have just woken me up if you were going to sit up worrying anyway.”
how that feels." He pointed an accusatory finger at the headstone, just as he had done to Sherlock himself in the past. "Why did you have to do this to us? It didn't solve anything!" He paused, took a few deep and shuddering breaths. "Sometimes, I really hate you."
The brush seemed to give him an exasperated sigh, and then it moved. John backed up a couple of paces, raising his gun, thinking it was stupid even as he did. You couldn't shoot a hallucination.
“I've held your attention?”
After a few weeks, he was almost good at masquerading as a healthy, functioning human being. Mary seemed pleased.
John could only stare at him. If it was obvious to Sholto, who else was it obvious to? He set the bottle down on the coffee table after refilling his glass yet again, and said, “I just came from Mary's.”
He shook his head. “I haven't really seen anyone either. I just...I couldn't do it, Mary. Not yet.”
Lestrade was quiet for a few minutes, before asking softly, "You were on the phone with him before he jumped, right?" John nodded. "What did he tell you?"
Sherlock insisted John sleep the first shift later that night. While it was true that he was more used to sleep deprivation than John, that had little to do with his offer. It took some convincing, but finally John agreed to at least try to sleep for a few hours. He gave Sherlock the gun after making sure he knew how to shoot it.
After a moment, he pushed himself to his feet, limping a little as he walked to the water's edge. He stared down into the water, trying to find the missing piece. What had he missed? What detail?
“It just seems like it's taken you a lot longer than it should to move on.”
They stopped at the door, leaving it shut to the world outside. John looked him up and down, chuckling at the clothes, and then his eyes stopped at Sherlock's neck.
“Oh you poor thing, come home from an active war zone and walk right into a bombing.”
Sherlock explained the history behind the Pantheon as they walked inside it. And though it was all monochrome and severe on the outside, on the inside it was positively divine. Sherlock talked about the feat of architecture, the sheer manipulation of the laws of physics required to create such a thing, especially given how many centuries it had survived intact. And underneath all the concrete, the most exquisite marble floor stretching out in every direction, making the footsteps of all the tourists echo. He pointed at the oculus above them, the circle in the dome letting in the light, fading that it was. There had been predictions of rain for that afternoon, and while they had avoided it thus far, the dimming light made John certain they wouldn't be able to evade it much longer. The beam of light would travel across the marble like a sundial until it was extinguished, whether by nighttime or by the impending storm. But the other people inside didn't seem to care. They were just as much in awe. Of course, Sherlock had an intellectual appreciation for it, and John had a pleasant mix of appreciation and romanticized notions of history living on in this place. There were some people who made these ruins their lives' work. There were others who likely thought it a dull entry in a tourist guidebook.
“Happy New Year,” he finally said, his voice sounding considerably less sure than it usually did.
The dim light did nothing for the dark circles under his eyes.
Mary had shown up more and more often lately, always all smiles and hardly ever sitting. The more John had thought about that troubling afternoon when she'd first canvassed the place made him see something sinister in every innocuous movement and act. There was evil in how she always stayed near the doorway of the kitchen and a horror in how she would tilt back and forth on her feet like a fidgety child.
He had the entire universe at his fingertips. And nothing to do with it. His mind refused to let him stop, barely contained by the cases he began to work for Greg Lestrade as an alternative to drugs. Stopping the world was only good for extra time to solve murders, time to perform experiments. When these things were not present, it was unbearable. He began to resent the ability, wishing instead only for a mind that was not in a constant state of attempted self-destruction.
“You wouldn't believe me if I told you.”
I glanced at the blue scarf on top of the dresser. It really was not cold enough outside to justify it. But it seemed the best option.
When John passed the tree, he saw a circle of dying bark, a black band forming on its trunk. It began to rot before his very eyes. John stopped and stared at it, glancing at Sherlock down the path.
“Very little. He avoids discussing his work at all. He just comes out here a few times a year, always stays in the same room. Keeps to himself.”
“Your army doctor is quite the fan of lost works of art, if I recall. But that's beside the point.”
He barely got the sentence out before Sherlock stood and left the room, his coffee abandoned on the table.
“You are bloody ridiculous, you know that?” John could barely get the words out through his laughter as he and Sherlock walked down the street, their steps not quite as steady after all the drinks they'd had. Sherlock had just nearly gotten them into a fight, arguing about ash of all things. John hadn't known quite what to expect when he'd slipped Sherlock the extra shots, but at the very least, the results were entertaining.
“How are they?”
“Can't sleep either?”
Standing in the lab at Bart's, Sherlock flipped through a very thick forensics file while John sat at another bench, watching him, wondering what the hell was going through his head this time. John had attempted to talk to him more once they reached the hospital, but Sherlock wouldn't be distracted, not even by John.
(See the end of the chapter for
There were tourists wandering around just like them, most of them bubbly and laughing, completely unburdened by the things that seemed to follow John and Sherlock wherever they went. But even Sherlock seemed oddly at ease here, tolerating John's slow pace, enduring his enchantment with a city that he had probably seen a hundred times, mostly in silence.
Later that day, when the sun was falling in the sky, the two of them exhausted but elated, Sherlock said, “You asked me, when you first saw it, what the name of the lavender rose was, since it was a new variety.”
"Something like that," he said, echoing Sherlock's earlier reply. "You did good tonight, you know. You even said a few nice things to Molly. It made her really happy."
“I don't know. I thought I'd be in a better place by now. And what the fuck am I going to do about Mary?” He rested his forehead on his open palm.
“What?”
Sherlock pulled out his keys, flipping through them and looking at them with intense scrutiny while he tried to find the one for Baker Street's front door. When at last he found it, he attempted to unlock the door, failing miserably, all hand-eye coordination gone. He frowned at the lock. John burst out laughing. “Here, let me, or we'll be out here all night.” He reached out, grabbing Sherlock's hand and pulling it away from the door. Sherlock didn't stop him, but he stared blankly at John's hand, eyes half-open. John looked at him for a moment, wondering if he was feeling all right, before slipping the keys out from his fingers. Sherlock seemed to come back to life when the keys left his hand, and he pulled his hand back, balling it into a loose fist before letting it drop to his side.
“What?” John asked, paper still in his hands.
The whispers rose again before John Watson said, “Next question,” with an edge of harsh finality.
Sherlock didn't sleep a single hour.
You will be alone always and then
“I don't know why you bother with that clinic, John. It's not as if we have any income issues. It can't be
“It will become your problem,” Mycroft said. “People in places of power being upset with you is not a good position to be in. And you,” he said, drawing Sherlock's attention, “you have certainly put me in an awkward position. Did you ever consider that your actions would reflect badly on me?” Sherlock rolled his eyes. Mycroft looked between the two of them. “When you have interviews, when you go on your tour, we will be working damage control. Otherwise you will not be safe.”
“Who's Mary?”
(See the end of the chapter for
John never thought he would come back to Baker Street ever again, but somehow, it ended up a normal part of his day. He had had trouble going back to any of the art museums; he was still associating the once-calming locales with bombings. And he had felt more at ease in the old woman's kitchen than anyplace else, and so it became routine. She seemed to enjoy the company, and she never expected him to talk. There was something soothing about being able to just drink some tea in peace and listen to someone discuss mundane matters, because in his own room, he always fell back into the bad habit of reading the papers or watching the news, thriving unhealthily on any scrap of information about the Hickman bombing.
Sholto waited for him to continue, and when he didn't, prompted him. “Yes?”
He didn't know what to think about them leaving the word
Sholto shifted in his seat, tilting his head. “John, why did you leave your girlfriend to come out here?”
John finally started coming down once he was backstage where it was safe and he didn't have to smile for cameras or cheerily answer questions. The audience had loved him, or so said Mycroft and Irene, but he barely heard them. It was all becoming too real.
They walked slowly, weighted down. “Do try to smile, John. It is a wedding reception, after all. I'm told they're supposed to be happy affairs.” John was wound up, and no words Sherlock could think of could make it okay. How could he make him see that it was okay?
“Should kick in within the next thirty or forty minutes,” John said absently, a phrase he was used to telling people. Another flash of lightning, one quick second of harsh light on John's face. He looked toward the window, away from Sherlock, drawn by the flash.
"Stop."
It seemed like a requirement, somehow, going back to the Piazza della Minerva, with its elephant obelisk and white church. It was only around the corner from the Pantheon itself, and John wondered if he'd created the trip to the Pantheon as a way of putting off the piazza or if somewhere in his subconscious he knew he needed to go back, and the only way he'd have the nerve would be to put himself within walking distance of it. The change was abrupt, the Pantheon and the piazza feeling like two different countries in the span of a hundred feet.
“So this
After the fact he would feel a little guilty for getting so much blood on the passenger's seat of Lestrade's car, but at the moment he wanted to paint the entire world in blood, a shouting proclamation of rage. Lestrade followed the distant lights of the ambulance far ahead of them, his own siren blaring. Over the high-pitched scream, Lestrade still attempted to talk, and said, “It's going to be okay, John.”
Mike agreed, though he sounded apprehensive. John set a time and hung up.
Across the room, as the breeze pulled at the filmy curtains swirling at the open French doors, Sherlock's phone buzzed on the side table. Over and over the little sound escaped it, but the two of them ignored it.
“You weren't entirely inaccurate.”
The front bell rang, and John shut his eyes, pretending he'd heard nothing, waiting to hear Mrs. Hudson's footsteps in the hall downstairs, answering it for him. But the guest continued to ring, and their call continued to go unanswered. John pushed himself out of bed, wondering if Mrs. Hudson had gone out, and pulled on his clothes, sure that he still looked like someone who had just woken up, or more accurately, someone who had spent most of the night wide awake and well-occupied.
He was aware of the smell of blood and fire before he even opened his eyes. And yet still, the actual sight of said blood and fire was jarring. The gallery was practically obliterated, walls crumbling, smoke curling in the air around the rubble, lights out except for what could run on generators, the ominous red glow of the exit sign across the room a strangely threatening beacon.
Sherlock took every weapon he could, spearing the bodies with blades and arrows. It felt macabre to do, but at least it would prevent anyone else from using them. All he kept was another knife with a better blade. The rest, the Capitol could keep.
Black on black on black. John kept swinging the gun in the direction of the growls, praying they would stay in one place long enough for him to shoot. But then what if the noise was tricking him and he wasn't even aiming in the right direction?
During a lull, John said, “Does the sky look darker to you?”
Regrettably, poetry and Sherlock both often felt beyond his grasp.
John laughed. “What do
She gave him a sort of sad smile as he took a drink. “I honestly expected you to be here with Sherlock.”
She stared him down, her fear fading and turning to resolve. Did she think he was about to kill her? Sherlock kept his hand wrapped around his knife, but he pulled it back to his side.
“No, I don't have an international reputation.”
“All the men who died in Afghanistan were just men. We barely knew most of them. I didn't think I could bounce back from all that death, but it was mostly strangers' deaths, really. This wasn't a stranger's death. You're right. I'd thought I'd moved on, but Rome throws a shadow over everything with Mary.”
“John?”
“Oh, trust me, I know.”
“Absolutely. Those years are hellish. I spent most of my efforts escaping them. All the awkward parties and faked social niceties, needless to say, were not for me.”
“Yes.”
John shook his head, laughing a little under his breath. Sherlock thought it sounded perfectly reasonable, naturally. John couldn't imagine what kind of upbringing or education could result in someone who thought that their setup was perfectly normal while also believing there was no sense in a doctor keeping up his skills.
John stared at him, wide eyed and terrified. There was someone standing there who looked like Sherlock, but that was impossible, wasn't it? This person's skin seemed to glow, and he had wings. John thought surely he was hallucinating, finally. Maybe the vision of The Man in Afghanistan had been a subconscious thing, like he'd seen Sherlock in passing once and projected the image of him as an angel in response to his imminent death. Maybe this was why he saw him now. But when he looked down, the gun was indeed gone from his hand.
“I managed with the sofa. I wasn't asleep for long, anyway.”
Between fans, John reached out a hand and slid the book across the table, laying it down on the chair next to him with his coat and satchel. He couldn't rationalize why he'd done it. He knew exactly who had left it there, and whether it was simply forgotten or deliberately placed there for him, he wasn't sure. But it was currently the only tie he had to the bizarre interloper. It would have to do.
The sense of detachment scared John at times, that troubling emptiness that filled all his interactions, especially those with Mary. He wondered if she noticed, if she could tell that he was just playing at normality and not really achieving it.
"He felt sick, nausea and dizziness rising up inside him, and as he felt himself fall, knees crashing into the ground, he heard a cannon.  And as his world went black, he wondered if it was for him."
“Did you start with those?”
At the end of the week, John was sitting up, wide awake from nervousness. Sherlock had begrudgingly let a doctor come in to take off the bandages and check John's eyes. John could hear his footsteps, pacing laps around the room. He would drive the poor doctor insane at this rate.
, when a horrible thought hit him as he watched Sherlock slip into that mode of deep thought he often assumed.
John closed the distance in seconds, wrapping him in a hug. Sherlock stiffened in surprise, but finally laid a hand on John's back.
"John, there's something I should say, I - I've meant to say always, and then never have."
“Jesus Christ, Sherlock.” It wasn't the response he'd been expecting. John had more to say, but he failed to say it, and Sherlock let the silence carry on, not knowing how to fill it either.
When John stepped off the train, he nearly tripped when his leg fell out from under him. He assured everyone he was fine, but he walked away trying to hide the limp.
.” John held his hands up and walked slowly into the water, standing where Moriarty directed him to, a few feet to the side in front of him. “There we go.” He looked back at Sherlock, the twisted smile of his hallucinations staring back at him. But this time he couldn't tell himself it wasn't real.
doesn't change how this will end. Besides, I know why already.”
“Before you broke up with the boring education major.”
SH: Anything can be a waste. No writing has intrinsic value, only extrinsic, the value that readers assign to it.
“That, Dr. Watson, is the question of the hour. Motive aside, we don't believe that the Hickman was an isolated incident. Rather, think of it as a symptom of a much larger disease. I personally believe that it is more an issue of theft and targeting of specific masterworks, rather than any political motivation.”
"Of course. Don't you?"
But it couldn't possibly be real, could it? Not with the points of light from windows and passing cars, not with the only slightly nippy air on his face, not with the surreal stillness that came with standing in the wake of activity and life. People didn't turn around on your front steps and light up, apparently pleased to see you, certainly not in his experience. People's faces were supposed to be hardened by shadows, not made softer, and Sherlock couldn't help but feel like this was what it was like seeing John Watson for the first time. Not the author, with the tense smile and crafted polite answers. Life imitates poetry, he thought. And surely this surreality must exist with reason.
“It's no longer our affair, Sherlock. It's out of our hands.”
John stood at the open door, watching after him for a moment longer before he stepped inside, pushing the door shut behind him. The front hall was a dark wood, and in a nearby room John could hear the echoing tick of a large clock. He was about to set off down the hall when he heard a second sound, a lighter click, and a little old woman materialized around the corner.
sonnet or Shakespeare's 18
He got down on one knee, bracing himself as he aimed, the dusty, metallic target of the mine taunting him. One chance. One shot, and then run.
“Hmm.”
In the quiet that followed the disappearance of her clicking steps, John suddenly felt very out of place, like a child who had been caught in his parents' room when he wasn't supposed to go there. He began wondering if he had made the right decision in coming to meet the Holmes brothers, or if he should have just left them to their reputation as the locals did.
And how the hell was he supposed to sit around and answer questions and sign books when he could be somewhere else, somewhere with candlelight and vacant pavement? The black and white of text messages wasn't enough, though he found himself surprised that he wanted more than that at all.
Kristin would have smiled. Sherlock didn't know what to do. And he hated it.
And then the texts came, one after another on Sherlock's phone, all signed with JM. Names. Names of every last person in the building. Names of their children. Names of all the priceless pieces collected under the museum's roof. And the riddles, the taunts, they had sent Sherlock into a frenzy. The threats he didn't mind, but the riddles drove him mad, especially when punctuated by the numerical countdown texts, the occasional message of, “Tick tock, Mr. Holmes.”
“Why is that?”
“We can't stay here forever, you know,” John said.
“There's always that one District that thinks they're god's gift to the universe.” Sherlock looked down and saw John standing beside him. He smirked a bit before he could stop himself.
John kept to himself until the reveal of their scores. He knew he'd be in trouble with Mycroft, and possibly Irene as well, and he was nearly sure that even Sherlock would at least give him strange looks. He didn't want to talk to anyone, and so he hid as best as he could. He put off returning to their floor for as long as possible.
He rested his hand on the dead section of the electrified fence, and couldn't help but wonder what it would be like if one day he touched it and it was live again.
Sherlock held him by his arms, and said only, “Run.”
He looked to the other side of the room where the Careers were hovering. The tributes from District 1 were as flashy as ever. Since their fare was luxury items, they always felt the need to show off much more than was necessary at the Parade, and this year they had certainly gone over the top. The woman was a redheaded creature with a sort of judging yet empty expression. Her male counterpart was a wiry looking man with black hair and a smile that belonged on a reptile. They were both decked out liked a king and queen. The man looked especially comfortable in his elegant robes, fingers covered in rings, and precious stones covering as much empty space as possible. He even had a crown, which he had tilted at an angle. Each of them had their own scepters. Sherlock hadn't thought it was possible for him to be any more disdainful of the Career districts, and yet here he was, finding himself thinking less of them by the minute.
For precious seconds, these thoughts would be banished by a kiss. John was always the initiator; Sherlock was too terrified himself. And it almost made it worth it, all the internal agonizing, just to have someone so close to him, having someone
Her face, usually a mix of playfulness and scheming, was suddenly very dark and sad. But it only lasted a second, and just as quickly, she glanced at Mycroft as she rose from her seat. She said to him, putting on a hollow version of her usual closed-lip smile, “What do you think we should all wear when we get back to the district, Mr. Holmes? I'm leaning toward my battle dress.” She turned and winked at John and Sherlock before walking out of the room.
He just felt so tired.
“No, but Mycroft keeps trying to fill up my free time with errands, and Mrs. Hudson feels the need to talk to me and 'keep me company' or some such nonsense. I mean, they do realize that I lived alone for years? I can mange for a few days.”
Except the lavender rose, perhaps.
“Though you did scare me a bit, what with being able to talk about corpses over dinner.”
That was painful to see, but it was nothing compared to the texts in Sherlock's inbox. He had saved one from Irene, the one that read, "Goodbye, Mr. Holmes," and every other one was from John. Their entire friendship, preserved in text messages. From A Study in Pink until the end. Every single text they'd ever sent each other, Sherlock had saved.
He wondered what it would take to solve all of this without actually
The explosion. He must have survived it. Had Moriarty? More importantly, had Sherlock?
Sherlock shook his head and began to examine the new slide. “That's ridiculous, Lestrade. Deductions like that are a perfect example of why you so constantly require my assistance with your cases.” Sherlock let the silence stretch on for a while before adding, “Besides, I think he's seeing someone. Some nurse. I forget her name.”
The understanding crept over Sherlock's face like storm clouds, his body suddenly stilled in a way John had never seen. And then the world erupted behind his eyes, that look of rapid processing that John was familiar with from night after night of poring over difficult cases, the moment of epiphany. “Mary, I don't know why you feel compelled to finish Moriarty's work, but your life doesn't have to be like that anymore. We can help you.”
? Please. It's a naïve notion that people can maintain meaningful and sincere interactions with each other over long periods of time. Mike is an acquaintance I know through my chosen field. I do not have friends.”
"Honestly, I had a better time with you than I would have had with Cathy."
"My preposition?"
was on shelves. How do you break the hearts of the people in the room by saying, “There's nothing, and might never be again.” He didn't want to frighten them. Especially given that he doubted this writer's block was permanent. In all likelihood, he would find another story soon enough. But for the time being, the very idea of trying to write another book sounded agonizing. As far as he was concerned, his last book was
“Do you mind me asking, but what did Mary have to say about this? Or did the two of you split before then?”
“And how would you feel if I gave you the third degree?”
“You love to antagonize, don't you?” Mike asked.
Perhaps the modern critics were right to condemn classical rhyme. It was certainly doing nothing aside from taunting him.
Her brow furrowed, confused when he didn't say anything back to her. “You're one of the new doctors, yeah?” she asked.
Sherlock wondered if he was going insane, if some long term effects of his past drug use were finally catching up with him.
, this was something close to peace.
“We're keeping you here for the night. My father's already examined you, and we've treated your wounds. I'm just going to be over here for the night to keep an eyes on things.” Sherlock nodded. “Can you sit up?” The boy came to stand by Sherlock's table, his hands braced should Sherlock black out again. But he was able to sit without a problem. “Can you talk?”
The driver's word of warning didn't keep John away for long. It was less than a week before his curiosity got the best of him.
He looked over the different faces. A woman in pink named Jennifer Wilson. The owner of the gallery, a severe looking woman named Wenceslas. Further down the list was the dark-skinned man who had given the ring to John, Chatterjee they called him. And Alex Woodbridge, the desperate dying security guard who had told him to take the Vermeer.
“Has Sherlock briefed you?” he asked, picking up a folder from the table. “No, of course he hasn't.” Sherlock ignored him, glancing out the window, distracted. “A threat has been made against one of the museums here, as I'm sure you've realized.”
He knew that he had almost told Sherlock to sit down if he was going to hang around, instead of just standing there talking. But the only place available for anyone to sit in John's Spartan bedroom was on the bed, and the invitation would have seemed too pointed in Sherlock's eyes, despite its innocuous intentions. There just simply wasn't any other furniture, and John was sure he was getting sick of standing. But Sherlock was good at making something out of nothing.
“Look, if you don't want to deal with Barnes and Noble or Waterstones I understand, but the local shops? You're a big draw for them. If anything, think of it this way: you're putting food on the booksellers' tables.”
But he still felt like he had no clue what to do about all this.
“If I read about that case, it's for the sake of reading about language acquisition and neurological development. I don't need a watered down happy ending fairytale version of it.”
Sherlock spent the rest of the night watching out the window as children came and went, always monitoring John's reactions. Mrs. Hudson came by at one point, but Sherlock didn't know what she'd wanted. He couldn't be bothered to pay attention to her tonight.
Harry pushed the glass across to him. He was sitting in her flat at the bar between the kitchen and living room, and he felt miserable. He never spent much time with Harry, and normally, he wholly disapproved of his sister's drinking, but tonight, he wanted to drown his sorrows as well. And it was true what they said about misery loving company.
]: You're a surprisingly hard person to pin down, Dr. Watson. We were beginning to think we'd have better luck reaching the queen.
For a second, he thought he would try again, but after glancing down at John's hand, he quietly resumed his seat against the wall.
is a relative term.” Sherlock came to a stop beside him, so close again, staring up at the piece. “The memorial to Maria Raggi.” John looked up at him, at his face inclined, a face that Bernini would likely have enjoyed immortalizing if he were alive today. The Bernini didn't matter. John could have seen hundreds of them. But none of them would compare to this, to Sherlock Holmes underneath a backdrop of painted stars, high above his head like a crown. Sculptures had weight to them, they were anchors, but Sherlock looked like he could disappear into thin air if given the opportunity. John had heard stories of people who cried when they saw works of art, heard that some people were overcome with a physical ache in the pit of their stomach when faced with something beautiful that had survived for centuries. And while he was never one for tears, he understood the ache now, and it hurt far more than his wounds from Afghanistan had.
When John pulled away, he did so only as much as was necessary to speak. All he could say was, “I would
John stopped walking. "Not long. Money's getting tight."
“Psychosomatic.” His voice was rough from disuse.
There was a long silence, Sherlock still close enough that John could feel his breath on his cheek.
“Wrong.”
“It's in Dublin, Sherlock.”
“Do we really have to do this?”
John rubbed a hand over his eyes, feeling suddenly exhausted. “I can't bounce back from this.”
Even as he was thinking it, he heard the door downstairs crash open. Sherlock never could make a quiet entrance. John heard his quick footsteps racing up the stairs. He bounded into the living room, whipping his scarf off and tossing it on the table. He only glanced at John before sitting down in front of his laptop. But then he stopped, turning his gaze again. He looked the tree up and down, and then cast a slow, if slightly disparaging, look around the flat.
. Why did she have to pick this one?
He felt an ache deep inside of him growing. It had been threatening to consume him for days, and it seemed it had finally won.
Sherlock was walking ahead of John when he stumbled on a root and reached out for the nearest thing to hold on to, a small, thin tree. His bare hand wrapped around it instinctively, but he quickly and easily righted himself and let go of it to continue walking without a second thought.
“Enjoying the delicacies, you two?” Sherlock rolled his eyes. John tried to smile. Mycroft took a seat on a plush sofa beneath the window.
But sleep never came that night.
“Don't poets write entire collections of poetry as a dedication to someone? Like the Brownings? Aren't they the ones who wrote all those sonnets to each other?”
“Goodbye, John.”
“Thunder?”
John hated that neither of them had just said it. Although Sherlock did, in his way. Leave it to Sherlock Holmes to spring a kiss in a crisis, and then be incapable of living long enough to follow it up, not even long enough for John to ask
,” he said, pointing to another button, “
After the confrontation at the pool, we sat in Baker Street, John making tea, as always, no doubt in an effort to calm us both down.
!” Sherlock tried to grab hold of John, to calm him down, but John jerked out of his grasp. “Come on!” John took the gun and threw it into the water beside him. “Choose your goddamned victor!”
John stared at him, resting a hand on the dashboard. “Mike
“Why?”
!” His shout echoed. He shut his eyes for a second, gaining his composure again before opening them, his head lolling back and forth on his neck.
“Yes. Quite a good night.”
John tried to focus on his breathing as he walked across the stage. The only sound he could hear in the Square was Harry crying somewhere in the crowds. It hadn't even been a conscious decision when he'd volunteered. It was a given. Harry would never stand a chance in the arena.
There was a vase on the table, filled with stargazer lilies. Mrs. Hudson had put them there, clearly from a store-bought bouquet and not the grounds. Decorations, not experiments, gorgeous with their heavy scent. The stargazer lilies in the gardens had succumbed to weeds a few weeks earlier.
Seeing Sholto, the man destined for sadness and solitude, so happy made him ask himself why the hell he was waiting. Granted, he didn't see himself making any kind of statement to Lestrade and his crew, and he had a sneaking suspicion that Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson were both already well aware of the situation, but something had to be done about Mary. Why
“Where's Lila?” John asked from his usual chair, country sun cutting through the windows. “The woman who was cooking?”
John was hesitant. Sherlock wanting answers was usually setting them up for an argument. John remembered when he tried to explain Cleudo. It hadn't gone well.
“Was it?”
“Just some very basic rooms. Why?”
“Since when do you read poetry?”
She stood on the other side, her profile just barely visible in the glass on the door, talking to someone. The man emerged into John's line of slight like a character appearing in the frame of a film. Molly smiled at him warmly, and he came up and kissed her cheek, his dark hair a sharp contrast across her pale face.
Irene turned to John. “Oh, he's just being moody. From what I understand, he's like that even on the best of days.”
Sherlock stood in the reception hall, Janine talking to him. He didn't hear most of what she said. He was too busy looking across the room at John and Mary.
“It's culturally priceless.”
“Yes.”
Sherlock continued to make polite conversation while John watched on in increasingly stunned silence. When the man finally left, waving as he did, John watched Sherlock's smile vanish as it did when he spoke to clients and Mycroft.
“It's the
"Since when do you do anything for Christmas except play some carols on the violin and sulk over 'everyone being too blinded by the holidays to commit a few murders'?"
The walk was a long and difficult one, but his leg seemed to hurt a little less than it had.
Somewhere off in the streets, a car horn blared, the sound ricocheting off the buildings. John let the noise fade to nothing, not wanting to interrupt. He stared absently at his scotch, looking at the way the color didn't seem right when removed from the artificial light indoors, darker and somehow threatening. Ridiculous.
One day, he laid a hand over the scar, and when he removed it, the area was tinged. It was barely enough to see, just the slightest shift away from white, and no one except Sherlock would have even noticed. He stared at his own hand, wondering what pigment he had not adequately washed off. He would have to be more careful next time his hands touched marble.
