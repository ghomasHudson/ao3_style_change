“Super,” Castiel answered dryly, getting up and dusting himself off. His feet moved to the french doors that lead to the small backyard and dock. “I don’t know why you didn’t let me move here sooner.”
Dean nodded and got up, offering Cas a lopsided grin before grabbing some of the bags they had hauled in. “So…”
When there was no response, Castiel whined incoherently as he pushed off the couch and stumbled to the door, blanket wrapped around his broad shoulders. He took a second to watch Dean retreating down his small gravel driveway before calling after him.
Dean offered a flash of a lopsided grin but kept his cautious tone as he continued. “I know I don’t really look it but I’m 26 and, yeah, typically I'd be running the roads free as a bird. But I’ve got some commitments I’m tied down to.”
“Not many people are around here.” Castiel placed a hand on his shoulder. “There’s no need to thank me, Dean.”
I meant Jo as in Anael / Sister Jo, but if you prefer to imagine Jo Harvelle as a hippy-dippy essential oils sales woman then go off lmao.
His feet carried him to the edge of the dock where he sat and dipped his overheated soles. Droplets of water jumped up onto the throbbing skin of his legs and Cas sighed in content; this was the reward he was looking for all day.
Ten long minutes later and Castiel’s hands were freezing, but everything was successfully unloaded into the house. He braced himself to start the run back to his side of the lake when Dean grabbed his soaking wrist. “Don’t
As Dean mulled over his answer, Cas pulled out a rather large box from the bag and immediately wished he hadn’t.
“Wife and kids?” Castiel assumed, looking around for any sign of them. So far, the house had been quiet except for the two of them. If Dean hadn’t revealed that he wasn’t alone in the house Castiel would have assumed he was; he was the only other body he ever saw around the lake.
“It’s nothing, man. I was just going to ask if you wanted to come with me while I run some errands today. I don’t know,” he added chucking nervously before waving Castiel off. “I guess it’s kinda stupid to ask someone if they
The boy walked out of the house swiftly, face covered by one of his hands, shoulders slumping as soon as he made contact with the white boards that made up the side of his lake house. The part of his face that Cas could see was twisted in what looked like despair, voice raspy as he mumbled staccato streams to himself. Cas’ ears only caught the occasional curse.
It mustn’t have been more than an hour later when Cas awoke to knocking on his door. He cursed sleepily, hugging the pillow closer to his head.
Big thank you to everyone who has given this fic a chance so far <3 Feels good to be back into writing and I already miss SPN :'(
“Yeah, I bought this place for my Mom to help her ease into things. They’re both on the third floor right now, napping, I think,” he tacked on thoughtfully.
They made their way back into the foyer and Castiel grabbed his trenchcoat off the hook on the wall. It surprised him when he saw Dean doing the same with his still-wet khaki jacket, but he didn’t question it when he found Dean beaming at him.
He perched himself back at his desk, glaring balefully at his typewriter. There was a hint of a spark in the back of his head, fragments of an idea that wouldn’t quite form. Castiel began by just getting those pieces out, despite the fact that they barely made sense when he read them back to himself later on.
So quiet were Dean’s next words that Castiel would have wondered if he actually said anything if it weren’t for the upsetting twist of his face. “Being isolated out here - I don’t know if its strength or insanity.”
“If I did, I wouldn’t be offering,” Dean pointed out, smiling wider until the corners of his eyes crinkled. “And it’s the least I can do after you helped me through the storm the other day.”
“Oh yeah? That’s great!” The genuine intrigue was not lost in Dean’s voice as he met Castiel’s blue eyes. “Lay it on me, man. What is it?”
"My place?" he asked, trying to sound confident, angry maybe. But his hard cock and panting breaths, proved how he really felt.
"You need to learn your place, Dean" Cas said with an arched eyebrow. Dean was a little scared, to be honest.
“Hmm?” he asks to make sure this is what Dean Wants, and he nods in agreement. Cas slide 2 fingers at once into Dean, he feels his own cum still inside, warm and slick, he starts massaging Dean’s hole and prostate, gently this time, sliding his fingers in and out, and Dean leans over to kiss him, fingering his lips and tongue and sucking hard, while Cas is finger fucking him until he can’t take it anymore and comes again without even being touched.
“My pleasure, Dean” he says and kisses Dean’s lips, their tongues finding each other so fast Dean is suddenly all wide awake.
His tongue was in Cas' mouth, but it wasn’t passionate at usual, it was gentle and delicate and slow. It was intense, like a cosmic connection they were remembering they had, and they were both panting by the time they parted lips.
"Dean, this is about handing over control" Cas finally said. Dean tried to focus his eyes and find Cas's face. He did, after a few hazy seconds.
He wanted to erase that whole situation from his mind. He wanted to tell Cas he's sorry he over reacted; That he knew he can't tell anyone what to do; That he needs to learn to control himself, before trying to control others.
"I know what you need" Cas said and dived right back in to take Dean's throbbing cock in his mouth, moving the but plug again, removing it almost completely and inserting it back all the way in. he was fucking Dean and sucking his cock, all the way from his balls to the head of his dripping cock.
Dean was stroking Cas' hips and after some time, moved his hand to grab his ass. Cas moaned in approval. Dean felt like the denim was in his way, he wanted to feel Cas, he missed him so much.
Dean was silent for a while, and Cas thought he might just go to sleep like this, when Dean finally spoke.
Dean saunters over to get the closest seat next to Stacy, which just so happens to be right behind Glenn. He’s still got that shit-eating grin on his face.
Well, it was horrible, obviously. They killed people and stabbed me in the back, and I think they just got-
Amara turned back to the Empty, and nodded a silent understanding of something, Dean couldn’t tell what. Then, black goo started consuming Chuck and Amara from the feet up.
Alright, then bring him with! He’ll be safe at the motel, just set him up with some fast food and TV.
Robert tries to hide behind a nearby building and catch his breath, but it’s no use. Pastor John appears there and digs his nails into Robert’s face before he can override his freeze response. He groans and yells out in pain, struggling for a good beat. He then manages to break free and get out onto the street to keep running.
Castiel glares silently. He thinks Dean covered it. Valeria smiles, gross and self-satisfied, mischievous.
Lucifer slugs the demon on their cheek and almost goes for another punch, but Queen Valeria steps in and drags Lucifer aside. She’s infuriatingly calm, collected, and disturbingly pleased.
I-I mean, if you want to stick around, that is, no pressure, I-I-I wouldn’t, you know, make you stay that’s-
Sam pecks Eileen’s lips and it takes a moment of continuing before Sam realizes what he said. He freezes, then sputters, flustered.
“Son of a bitch. I missed you.” Cas expected it to end there, for Dean to walk away and let Cas rest, or grab food, or something. Emotional conversations weren’t a thing they had in this family. Yet, Dean sat down on the bed and moved closer to Cas. Even running his fingers through their hair. Cas’ hair.
stab Cas when we met.” Dean’s a little hysterical. It’s not that funny, but the bubbling anxiety in his chest needs to come out somehow.
You were Cas’ kid. And I know you see me as a father too. And I owe it to him - and to you, to try. So we’re gonna watch scooby doo, be goofy idiots, and you’re gonna be a kid. That okay?
SLOW PAN AROUND to the other side of the barn, where AMARA is standing, waiting - wearing a killer all-black pantsuit. Cut back to the reactions of TFW. Dean’s face turns to anger while everyone else is just surprised.
You wanna know what that true happiness was? The thing that killed him in the end, the thing that made him smile even as he fucking died on me?
No answer. Dean’s shaky hands come up to his face to cover it as he sobs. SLOW ZOOM OUT on this desolate image, Dean curled up all alone in a fancy room that feels like a cold, stone, grey room.
Dean walks in through the door, bell dinging quietly under the music. He grabs some prepackaged sandwich crap, barbeque chips, a bottle of soda, and styrofoam plates and plastic utensils. He also grabs a generous case of beer. He walks over to the register and smiles grimly, his eyes still a bit puffy and red. The CASHIER gives him a look that says “Oh boy, another alcoholic mess,” then dings him up.
He had no idea what was happening, he never had that odd reaction to, well, anything basically. But the intense physical and sexual encounter, combined with the actual fight from before, made Dean feel vulnerable and just horrible.
"I am. Stop being a child, Dean." Cas said with a stern face. He was getting angry. Trying to please Dean can be exhausting.
“You love my fingers inside of you” Cas goes in his commander voice and Dean whimpers and turns around to face Cas and straddle his lap, Cas’s fingers still inside him. They kiss for a while, while Cas plays with his fingers inside his ass, with Dean just resting on top of Cas, enjoying himself.
Something cold was touching Dean's ass, and when Cas started pushing it in him, he realized what it was.
The next time he was conscious, he felt like he had to pee, badly. He got up and put some cloths on, and left his room to go to the bathroom.
Cas smiled. He wanted Dean to relax, to let go of all his anger and control issues. He knew exactly where Dean's mind was at – he was beating himself up about not being able to control this, to control Sam and Cas and making them do as he pleased.
Hours later, the party was done, all the food was consumed, and everyone complimented on Dean's cake that turned out great and pretty.
"Yes. And I think this is the way to teach you. If you're up for it" he added, brushing his thumb over Dean's lips.
"You still want me here in your bed?" Cas was so unsure. Perhaps he should leave? He could see Dean was not ok.
This was about Dean, for now. He got up on the bed behind him, sitting on his heels and enjoying the view of Dean's perfect bubble but.
"Just don't keep things too bottled up, honey. It never ends well" she said and kissed him goodnight as he rolled his eyes at her but kissed back.
“Mmm.. I don’t think I’m up for another round” Dean hums but enjoys the touch. Cas laughs. “Don’t worry, we’re done for tonight, I’m just cleaning you up from all of me…” Cas says and it comes out so erotic and yet so loving, Dean feels so amazed.
So Cas got off the bed, not hugging Dean as he wished to do, and left the room, closing the door behind him, still hearing the gentle sobs coming out of the room.
"Dean, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel this way.. I'm.. so sorry" Cas felt awful, being the one who put his baby in this position.
When he feels the water around him he opens his eyes and realizes he’s not dreaming, he’s inside the bath tub and Cas is entering after him, placing Dean between his legs. The water is warm and the room is all foggy.
He pulled Dean up and removed his pants and boxers, giving him a once over and cupping his ass cheeks with both hands, pressing up against Dean's cock.
But Sam wouldn’t hear it. He said he's going and that's final, and when Cas stumbled over to the war room, he immediately joined in with the conversation.
Cas was smiling at him. "How badly do you want to come, Dean?" he was asking him while still not touching the man.
“Yes” he chokes out, and Cas in moving again, until he’s fully inside Dean, not moving. Letting dean get used to the feeling of being so full, not wanting to hurt him.
"Good boy" Cas was smiling, and finally able to see Dean. His eyes were glassy with unshed tears, his hair all tousled, and he was looking restless.
"it's OK, you just need someone to show you how to behave. I'll show you, Dean." Cas said in a pleased voice and pulled the plug all the way out and slammed it back in, all the way into his tight ass.
“Thank you, angel” Dean hums, his eye still closed, and Cas proceeds to massage his arms and legs, and then reaching down to play with his ass again, running his finger in his rim.
Cas's tongue was not there anymore, and the plug was in him but not moving. He opened his eyes, breathing heavy, his chest rising and falling, looking confused.
Dean is making dinner, boiling pasta and stirring the sauce, while humming to himself quietly. He would have chosen to make some burgers but he knows Cas likes his pasta, and he really wants to lick that sauce off his lips if they get dirty. He imagines licking Cas’s lips, neck, and how his body reacts. He jumps when he feels a hand over his waist, grabbing him from behind. He feels embarrassed about his thoughts, but then thinks to himself, it’s just Cas, and leans backwards for the touch. Cas kisses his cheek.
“yes” he breaths and Cas is now hard again, and he doesn’t care about anything anymore, he flips Dean on his back and all of a sudden Dean is tied to the bed, both hands are cuffed and spread out over the head board, his legs are spread wide, each leg is tied to it’s own ankle and he lays there, like a butterfly, opened and vulnerable, thinking how he could never be that way with anyone else in the entire universe but his own private angel.
"Please, fuck me, Cas" Dean was begging him with all he had. Cas bit his lips, wanting to fuck Dean so badly, his own cock so hard and aching in those pants, but he had to keep going with what he had in mind.
“You look so beautiful like that” he admires. Dean pushed his ass up to try and make Cas touch him again
He didn't have to move to know that it was Cas. Dean was still laying on his side, Cas sitting on the other side of the bed now.
Before he can take another breath, Cas snaps his fingers and they are both naked. Dean smiles and wants to make some sarcastic remark about Cas being so eager, only Cas is really that eager, and before Dean knows it, he is flipped over to lye his stomach, his ass up in the air, and Cas is spearing his cheeks apart. He gasps in shock. Cas is usually more gentle and romantic, but not tonight. Tonight Sam is not there to hear them, nothing to stop them from being loud and free. Tonight is all about pure lust and loss of inhabitations.
This is not the way it was meant to go. He actually didn’t think so far ahead, but his attempt to whatever it was he tried to do, failed miserably.
Dean felt himself starting to slip away, wanting out, wanting as far away as possible, wanting to go into the black nothing and be left alone.
Dean still didn't answer, but he also didn't flinch or asked him to leave. He was staring at the wall in front of him. After a while, he felt the mattress shift and Cas pressing up against him, hugging his entire body, not too tight.
"No. I said no, why is this so unclear to the both of you? I want you here in the bunker, and if I can't come with, nobody goes and that's final" he was yelling again.
“Well you love it, and I need it. Come on…” Dean doesn’t even know what he wants more, food or sex, and that says a lot for the man who puts nothing before his food. Well that was until he and Cas got involved. But still, they sit down to have dinner anyway.
He didn't know how to say it, he didn’t want to hurt Cas' feelings, but he just wanted to be left alone.
"You're doing so well, Dean. But I'm nowhere near done with you." Cas said and Dean could feel him smirking, even when he couldn't see his face.
“you’ll thank me in the morning, when all your limbs aren’t aching and sore” Cas places a gentle kiss on Dean’s lips, the other man already back to sleep, but after a few minutes he can feel himself being lifted, the brush of feathers around him making him feel loved and secured and he smiles to himself, thinking he must be dreaming.
'Good. Mom and Donna are waiting to see you guys.'  Was all he could say. He got into bed and held his phone as he settled in for sleep.
Finally Dean releases his breath and whispers “Cas, move…” and then it starts. Cas is fucking him, starting slow, pulling out almost completely and pushing back in, hearing Dean cry out every time and begging for more, pushing his ass out, losing all control and self shame
“I… I want you. Don’t stop, angel” Dean pleads. Cas twists his fingers inside Dean, causing him to gasp and lean his ass into the touch.
He placed his hands on both sides of Dean's thighs and leaned down to finally take the hunter's cock in his mouth. Dean was moaning loudly at the touch of Cas's hot wet tongue engulfing his throbbing cock.
“Where are you going?” Dean says in a confused voice. Even when it’s been a whole year to their relationship, Dean still feels insecure when they go to sleep and he knows Cas is wide away the entire night. He can’t help but think Cas doesn’t really want to be there with him and probably has plenty of other, better, things to do with his time.
His cock was starting to drip precome as he moaned and panted and welcomed the device into him, pushing his hips trying to fuck himself over it.
They came almost at the same time, Cas in a low growl and Dean practically screaming into Cas' mouth.
'Cas…Of course. That will never change. I love you. Going to sleep now' Dean was getting sleepy and emotionally drained.
"Sammy, please, just listen to me" Dean tries lowering his voice and calm down. He was half begging, half demanding.
Dean rarely cried in front of people, and even though Cas was an exception to that rule, Dean still never cried like that.
“I need you… inside me” Dean asks and refuses to feel ashamed at the words. Cas takes his hand and rubs Dean’s sore ass, reaching over to spread his legs, and place his finger in Dean’s entrance.
"Dean, stop it. If Sam is going on this hunt, he should at least have me there. You stay here and we'll be back as soon as possible." Cas was trying to placate him, but Dean was just rolling his eyes in response.
Cas opened the lube and squeezed some over his hand, making sure his fingers are nice and coated. He put one finger on Dean's waiting rim, causing the hunter to make some obscene noises. And then he pushed it in.
Cas was licking and sucking, while moving one hand down to push the but plug in and out of Dean. Dean was growling and enjoying every second of it, feeling like he'll never feel this good again, feeling the orgasm finally building up and about to burst out of him, and then it all stopped.
He puts his hand in the back of Cas’s neck, pulling him closer, making Cas hop on the bed and straddle his lap. They are both not wearing any shoes but still fully clothed. Dean focus on Cas’s lips, licking and biting, and Cas is sucking his tongue in a way that makes Dean groan with all the dirty images he has in mind at that moment.
Cas obliges and starts fingering him in and out in deep motions while his other hand is grabbing one ass cheek so hard it will surely leave a mark. He leans down and bites the soft skin, while adding a second finger, scissoring Dean.
"I don't want to leave you. I don't want to leave tomorrow with you this way. Please talk to me" Cas was pleading, feeling guilty as hell.
Taking Dean into his mouth and fucking him with the plug, and again, when Dean was reaching his orgasm, Cas stopped and waited until Dean cooled off a tiny bit.
Dean is now crying and shuddering underneath him. Cas lays down on top of him, sheltering him, both hands on either side of his head, his lips placing soft loving kisses all over his face, eyes, nose, cheeks, hair, and lips.
“If you want more, you’ll get more” Cas says and just like that pushes his hard cock inside Dean, pumping in and out, fucking him again with no mercy, reaching down to tweak his nipples and finally to grab his dick and stroke it while fucking him. Dean is in heaven, making such obscene sounds he could play in a porno, but he can’t help it. he’s arching his back and biting his lip, moaning like no one else exist in the world but him and his angel.
Everything was going fine; they were all happy and enjoying some free time at the bunker with mom. He and Cas were back to normal, more in love than ever.
"Turn around" he told Dean and the man obeyed, turning over to be face to face with Cas. he looked scared.
"Well, if you asked so nicely" Cas said, and went over to the nightstands, pulling open his sex drawer (yes, the once angel of the lord, now had a dirty gay sex drawer next to his bed) and picked a nice black but plug, and some lube.
Cas' face was resting on Dean's chest as they cuddled together, chatting and laughing. It was almost 3am when the conversation died down, but they were still wide awake.
They chat about the latest GOT episode they all watched together with Sammy, wondering how angry he’ll get if they continue it without him.
“You could never” he says and grinds his ass up Cas’s groin. Cas is taken for a moment, but he’s on board after a quick second, reaching over to put his hand over dean’s groin, feeling him getting hard already. He puts some pressure over the denim and Dean moans softly.
Dean tried speaking but his throat was all closed up. After a minute he opened his eyes and looked straight in Cas' eyes when he said "please..please, leave me alone".
"Cas, if you're coming with, we leave first thing in the morning" he looked at Cas and they exchanged smiles and nods of confirmation.
“Thanks for carrying me.” He feels his cheeks turn red, and he doesn’t know why but still he can get embarrassed by these little things.
Dean parted Cas' butt cheeks and brushed his index finger in his hole, playing with it, making Cas cry out with pleasure. He gently pushed his finger in.
"I'll go with you" Cas intervened, just as Sam was about to yell at Dean some more. Dean raised his eyebrows in disbelieve. What a betrayal! His boyfriend is gonna hear about this, not being on his side.
“We should really eat something” Dean says and turns around, trapped now between the counter and Cas’s arms, that are holding him tight and In place, their bodies completely pressed up against each other in every spot.
"I'm sorry Dean, you can stay here, you should stay here, keep mom and Donna company until I come back" Sam sounded resigned on going.
Dean didn't say a word, he was lost in his head, trying to think what's happening here, they never did that before, he heard about edging, but never experienced it.
He went to his room, but stayed up for a while longer, thinking about Cas, trying to make sense of it all.
'I understand you need space. I just want you to know how much I miss you. And I'll make it up to you'
He pulled down his boxers a bit, exposing Cas' bubble but, and started kneading it. Cas scooched even closer to Dean's body, his cock starting to get hard against Dean's thigh.
He felt like his insides were ripped apart, like the whole world was closing in on him, and he was so tired, like all his batteries had run out.
“Fuck me.” Dean tried to command from the bottom, but they both know Cas is the top in this relationship and he will do what he pleases.
Sam caught a case down in Ohio, a nasty ghost so it seemed. Only problem was, the boys have invited Mary and Donna over for a few days to celebrate Donna's birthday, and they were arriving tomorrow morning.
Dean was demanding Sam would call up Garth and send him instead, or look for someone else; he couldn’t leave his best girls high and dry, and he obviously wasn't gonna let people die. He was just willing to let this one go, to another well trained hunter.
After a while Cas can feel himself about to cum, he reaches over to grab Dean’s cock, giving it a few strokes and that’s all that Dean needs to cum hard all over Cas’s hand while Cas is drilling inside him, Cuming as well, hitting Dean hard and deep, spilling his load inside him. Cas is still chasing the aftershocks of his orgasm and still rides Dean who whimpers and cries from pleasure, until he collapses and lays down, taking Dean to his side, spooning him. They’re both sweaty and out of breath.
"Dean?" Cas was alarmed. Dean was too. He hated sharing his feelings like that. But he had no choice.
“Relax, Dean” he says in a calming, commanding way and inserts his index finger, causing Dean to make the dirtiest groan possible.
They end up watching some chick flick movie that Dean loves and Cas is ok with. Dean is lying between Cas’s legs, leaning against his chest, and after some time he falls asleep. He can feel feather like kisses on his face, and the feeling of being lifted with no effort, being engulfed in Cas’s arms, his head leaning into his chest and his arms instinctively wrap themselves around his neck. Cas smiles at the sight and places Dean carefully in his bed.
"Honey, did you do all this?" mom called out as she and Donna went down the stairs. The bunker was filled with colorful balloons, music was playing in the background, and some amazing smells cam out of the kitchen.
He did a lot of thinking, with everything leading him to the conclusion that he owed Cas and Sam a huge apology for acting like a dumb baby.
Cas was rubbing his hand over the place he just hit. Dean felt his skin all tingly and his cock was begging to be touched. Then came another blow from Cas's open hand, on his other cheek this time.
Because whenever he has a good thing going for him, it gets taken away somehow. And Cas knows Dean is just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
After 2 times of doing that, Dean was a mess, panting and wanting and needing, willing to do just about anything for some sweet release.
13 hours later he woke up to the feeling of having to pee, badly. He stumbled out of bed and went into the bathroom. Everything felt hazy but also better than yesterday. He went back to his room and checked his phone. It was almost noon and he had a lot of missed calls, mostly from Cas and also mom. They texted as well.
Every movement with that thing inside his ass, sent vibrations right to his cock. He turned over to lay on his back, spreading his legs and lifting his knees, giving Cas easy access.
Castiel hummed and stretched his fingers out the window, feeling the wind pass through and caress each digit. The air on his skin made it feel like the anxiety that consumed him during the writing process was blowing away behind them. He caught Dean eyeing the gesture.
Castiel paused and glanced over at Dean, watching him peel back the plastic wrapped around an unmarked cylinder. “What's stopping you?”
Away buddy Wilson for the past week waddled down the stairs, forcing Cas to follow along just to ensure it wouldn’t rip at any of the cushions. Again.
Cas paused, pleasantly surprised that he didn’t have to run through the whole speech for the umpteenth time.
Castiel’s back foot slipped and he fell onto his knees, panting and cursing as he took in the tingling in his arms and fingers. He leaned back against the dresser and looked across the room.
Never had Castiel been so uncomfortable and out of place in his whole life. Cas’ back was arching, tensed to spring back into the house. The water was suddenly numbing to his toes but Cas couldn’t find the courage to move.
Castiel didn’t think moving to Seattle for the summer would mean cleaning up the mess his family had left behind years ago. He also didn’t think that moving to Seattle meant even less time to write. It had already been a week and not only was he about ready to go on a wildlife massacre, but Cas was pretty sure his publishers would give him the ax if he came back to L.A. with no novel to hand over.
It took only an hour for Castiel to unpack his things into his parents' lakehouse, and after that hour he was ready to pack them back up and book the next flight out.
Dean barked out his melodic laughter and practically cleared the shelf of baby food. “What else do you need from
But today seemed to be a day Cas wouldn’t be able to avoid going out to the patio. The raccoon that was slowly becoming his Cast
When everything was paid for and loaded into the Impala, Castiel climbed back into the passenger seat and waited for Dean to finish returning his cart.
“Hey, Cas? Not to get between you and your pimpmobile but do you wanna ride with me instead? I’ve been told carpooling is a lot better for the environment.”
Two days after Castiel’s awkward encounter with Dean, Cas found himself behind his typewriter, watching the rain turn the window panes into liquid glass. He noted how the surface of the lake jumped up as raindrop after raindrop fell into it, breaking its smooth sheet. Castiel noted the clouds looking overstuffed and overcast, and the way the trees surrounding the area were gracefully bowed to the direction of the hurdling, shrieking wind.
“A plotline would be great. Or a weapon of some sort. Do they sell guns here in Seattle like I hear they do in Kansas?”
Dean’s chest heaved as he eyed Castiel’s shivering form standing awkwardly in the middle of the room.
Castiel looked up from his rental Lincoln Continental to Dean, who sat in a his Chevy Impala a couple meters away. He leaned over the passenger seat, an uncertain smile on his face.
He contemplated writing an overdone story on purpose with a generic plotline and cliché protagonist in an attempt to buy some time, but concluded that a move like that would only get him into more trouble. His publisher knew Cas to have a bout of writers block, not a bout of stupidity. Insisting on spending the summer out in the middle of nowhere and then returning with a flatline
“Move!” Cas pleaded, shoving against the dresser with all the strength he could muster. A drop of sweat broke from his temple and ran down the edge of his jaw. He grunted as he pushed forward again, feet digging into the hardwood. “You son of a bitch— !”
But the relief wore away quickly as he watched Dean’s brow furrow. “You’re the one who laughed when I dropped the garbage last week, right?”
“No, I’m not really attached to anyone. It’s hard to be - most people are usually just out there to climb the social ladder and I'm not good with angling social exchanges to my advantage. Or having social exchanges in general. It’s hard to have faith in anyone to stick around,” Cas shrugged. He glanced out the ceiling-to-floor window in the adjoining dining room and wasn’t sure whether he should have been disappointed that the weather had steadied into calmer showers.
Dean seemed to recite the information in a way that sounded as if he was trying hard to remember old faces and the personalities behind them.
The walk back around the lake was quiet, the two of them getting pelted with streams of water. Castiel fought the urge to tell Dean to stay inside, but he could just tell that Dean wasn’t the type of person to let a lot of things stop him.
Castiel leaned towards him, angling his body just so. He fixed Dean with the most intense stare he could muster under the sticky, withering heat in the Impala.
"Huh." Dean looked around as if expecting some nonexistent second neighbour to materialize – perhaps looking for any signs of Castiel’s nonexistent brother.
“She’s good. Today she seems to be in good shape so I’m not too worried about leaving her with Sam.”
There was an abrupt silence that caused Castiel’s head to snap up from behind the fridge door. He ran over what Dean said in his head, anxious he had missed a social cue - he'd gotten better over the years but he still missed those quite often.
Cas watched as a boy dragged three overstuffed garbage bags out the side of the house, his stocky frame struggling to keep the bags at arms length while carrying their weight. He swore as one ripped open, its contents spilling onto the ground. From what Cas could make out, they looked like diapers.
Cas carefully passed over the pie, Dean’s fingers brushing over his as the box changed hands. Cas shook the fleeting stirring in his stomach and followed Dean to the checkout line, thanking him when he nudged Cas in line ahead of him.
In Castiel's hands was a box of adult diapers. He eyed Dean discreetly, deciding he didn’t seem like he needed help holding it in, and concluded that he must have a gargantuan baby stashed somewhere in the lake house. Castiel snuck a once over of him one more time before setting the box on the floor.
Castiel normally would have gone back inside but the sun was too inviting, the air seemingly lighter and crisper around the lake. The breeze hit his tired arms and Cas couldn’t help but smile at how soothing it was to be surrounded by more than just stale air and cobwebs.
“Yeah, I like the dresser better here too anyway,” Cas conceded, addressing the raccoon that had found its way back into the house. He groaned in defeat and laid down on the newly swept floor, pressing his cheek on its cool surface. His black hair clung to his face and neck as he waited for his heartrate to subside.
It was obvious that Castiel’s presence hadn’t registered as Castiel watched the boy growl in frustration and kick the side of the lake house. His hand fell from his face and Cas could see his boyish features contorted in agony; his fists pounded angrily on the house, only pausing when he seemed to catch a splinter.
“Don’t be stupid,” Castiel countered, knocking Dean’s shaking hands out of the way and heaving two bags out. Cas sprinted to the open front door and placed them beside the other white bags Dean had managed to carry in.
“It’s okay,” Castiel uttered, hamming up a shrug to compensate for his natural lack of inflections. “I barely noticed.”
“Oh.” The tension in Cas’ spine relaxed but he couldn’t shake the concern in his wide eyes. “What is it then?”
Dean immediately noticed the change when he slid into the car. He looked Castiel up and down, green eyes swift and analyzing. “You alright, Cas?”
The blonde paused and licked his lips. Castiel waited for him to start yelling. Maybe even swinging.
One of the reasons Cas came out to the middle of nowhere was so that he would be able to remain undisturbed by anyone; every day he found that his reasons for moving to the lake house were becoming moot.
Just as he was about to start up again, his breath left his body. Cas’ hands hovered over the keys of his typewriter as he painfully took note of the tired expression sewn onto Dean’s face at 2 AM.
Sometimes Cas would catch him sitting at the edge of the dock in the afternoons or evenings, staring at the house Cas was so desperately trying to clean up on the inside. Sometimes Castiel wondered if the boy could see him – if he was watching Cas like Cas sometimes watched him. But Castiel quickly figured that he was simply staring out leisurely at the lake between them, and went back to sweeping up the layer of dust that had accumulated on the floor.
The cellphone in his back pocket began to vibrate and he furiously fished it out, still facedown and defeated.
Castiel let out the breath he didn’t realize he was holding before going back to the ruins of his family’s old lake house.
He shoved his phone back into his pocket, feeling the weight in his chest return. Castiel rested his forehead on the passenger’s side window, and it was all he could do not to try and put his head through it. Instead he let the cool glass soothe the rising heat of anxiety as he watched Dean walk back towards the Impala.
Castiel had been staring at his rental, gripping the driver’s side door handle, half wondering if the 45 minute drive to town to stock the kitchen would be worth it and half wondering if the muted mustard beige paint job was tacky or cool - Dean had clearly answered that second internal debate.
… as your Lincoln but, y’know, save the world, save some gas,” Dean added, offering another hesitant grin.
“Don’t mention it.” Dean looked back towards his lake house for a moment before grinning back at Cas. “Guess I’ll see you around.”
“Are you kidding me?!” Cas shouted as his foot went through yet another floorboard, ramming face-first onto the floor. He felt a sheet of dust mould to his cheek. “Are you fucking kidding me!?”
They keep walking. Meg looks surprisingly unemotional, while Dean’s trying desperately to stay out of his. On his empty, tired, and broken expression-
Sam jumps to action and starts untying Jenny, the closest, from the rebar spikes. EXTREME CLOSE UP on the now un-roped rebar, then cut to Dean’s gaze. Sam notices.
"Welcome home, pal," is what Dean says when Castiel returns. He wants to say "I hope Earth is home, I hope I'm your home, you, and Sam, you're mine. Stay this time."
No, no, I do. I do, okay? When the angels fell, I was so caught up in Sam and my own little bubble- I didn’t even think about it. I just thought, oh, okay, he can’t teleport anymore.
It’s bland, a gray dark room with a single chair in the middle. In it, some DEMON, tied up and bloody.
Dean sighs. He’s slowly losing his anger and is just becoming tired. Sam smiles, remembering how Dean used to boast about him at school.
Dean stands there, at the end of the aisle with all of his family and friends looking at him, watching and waiting for Cas to arrive. He taps his foot nervously.
He’s not unprotected, Dean! The bunker is the safest, most harshly warded thing in the universe, okay? And Eileen’s staying with him. Hell, it’d be more dangerous if he did come along!
Castiel appears behind Dean (seriously, why always there? Is it to check out his ass or what?) with a whoosh. He forces Dean by the shoulder to look at him, and starts pulling at limbs and shit to do a full Doctor Sexy exam. It’s not all that sexy.
Sam chuckles slightly, and waits. Dean and him are gonna have this conversation one way or another. Dean takes a deep breath in, then one out.
A tense moment of silence occurs. Sam’s trying to figure out how he can convince Dean, as well as looking at him with pity. Eileen sets her fork down softly and grimaces. Jack looks at his feet.
Last time, Chuck sent TFW back to Earth, and Jack showed up, now physically a toddler and balling his eyes out. Today, we find out more about the plot of this season, special guest starring Shoshannah Stern as Eileen.
Sam translates the exchange to Eileen in sign language, then they both snicker. Dean glares at them. Jack runs off to his room with Miracle, and immediately Dean’s smile falls to a truly depressed expression.
FLASH CUT to Dean on the other side of the bed, no idea how he got there. He drops his whiskey glass on the bed and hastily picks up it, leaving a damp puddle on the blanket.
ANGLE ON Glenn, sitting alone at a table in the wide, busy cafeteria. He’s watching Dean, who in the distance ruffles Sam’s hair on the way to Stacy and her friend group, clearly flirting. Glenn scoffs, and takes a bite out of his lunch. Dean catches Glenn’s eye for a second, then bids the girls goodbye.
Funny. But the thing is, the Queen wants him. Really bad. Now I can’t do anything to you, Dean, she needs you, too.
It means that I’m too powerful of an entity to go into the Empty without breaking it apart. But you aren’t, and I can help you get in. From there, you’re on your own.
Robert is running quickly, a single bystander - a random old lady - stopping for a second to question what the hell he’s doing. The camera spins, taking thirty degree angles from the ground; Robert’s panicked and drunk.
You always leave, then come back, then leave again. I c-can’t know, if this time... it’s gonna stick. I’m gonna ask one last thing of you, Cas. You come back, and you stay. Got it?
. Cas is perfectly polite and friendly to anyone that doesn’t know him, and fortunately John doesn’t, but
Sam’s still laughing when Dean and Castiel lean over the computer to check out an image of the limo, then they press a few keys and flip a picture of a crappy- SHITTY warehouse.
Dean’s sitting in a full class, actually taking notes and participating. The bell rings, and Glenn stays behind to keep taking notes. When everyone else exits, Dean stands and lingers by Glenn’s desk. He leans over and catches the name written on the worksheet, Glenn.
Castiel dies by Lucifer's blade, and all Dean can say is "Cas!" When he mourns, he wishes he'd said more.
Jack slides two stakes soaked in lamb’s blood to Dean and Sam, then tosses one to Eileen, getting up out of the half-done rope around him.
What made you- you so different? Why are you suddenly all “I’m your dad” to the kid you said wasn’t family?
Dean goes to grab the black chair, the one Cas used to sit in and creepily watch him in. He hesitates before throwing it across the room with a shout. It crashes into a pile of bottles and shatters them. Dean grabs a lamp and throws it onto the ground. Dean steps towards his bed, and his foot snags on a piece of glass.
Last time, we got a good dose of Saileen and some fatherly Dean. We also found out a little more about the Djinn situation. This time, we're going on a case, featuring the dead gay nuns.
It’s a typical crappy motel room, but not bad for what they’ve had. Dean opens the door and ushers Glenn in.
He says "I need you," he says "we're family," he says "I'm not leaving here without you," and it just comes out, without a thought in his head. Castiel hears those words, and he doesn't know either. He thinks, "you need me? You need me for what? Why are we family? Why won't you leave without me?" Human emotions were strange, and confusing, and new. He couldn't get it when Dean expressed them in such a convoluted way. Dean didn't get it when he did, either.
Jack starts shoving the food down his gullet, clearly taking after Dean in his eating habits. Sam, Eileen, and Dean sit down on the beds of the motel to talk about the case. ANGLE ON Jack, watching Sam, Eileen, and Dean’s mouths move silently and Jack continues carelessly eating. He pauses to pat Marvelous Marvin the Talking Teddy. Montage of shots, Dean, Sam, and Eileen researching and preparing. There’s a pile up of beer bottles, definitely from Dean.
Well, it sure was a lot. You ought to call him, y’know. Tell him how you feel, make it right. There’s time now.
Sam spots a 17-ish teenager poking their head out above the staircase, watching them with a pained look on her face - CECE BROWN. He double takes, but looks back to Mrs Brown. She looks at the floor and shakes her head.
Dean still wears that bittersweet hurt and happiness. He ruffles Jack’s hair, then looks away and starts singing.
He hands Castiel a business card. Castiel flips it over and inspects it, to see a handwritten number on the back.
Well, that is- uh, that’s pretty concerning. How much of your powers are working anyways, since you’re- y’know- smaller.
Last time, we got Cas back from the Empty with a little cameo from Meg and Amara. This time, will we face our feelings, or will we carefully avoid that conversation until we can't? Stay tuned!
You - you left me w-with this again? You stupid son of a bitch, you left me, and you leave me with... You saved me so many times - damn this brings back memories.
Her husband, another good-christian-looking man, walks into the living room from the kitchen - VICTOR BROWN.
Dean very literally BOLTS into Cas’ arms and hugs him incredibly tight. Like, it can’t be comfortable, kind of tight. Castiel returns the hug tenaciously, dropping the torn trench coat (we’ll never see that one again).
“Your love life? Are you kidding me? Who is it! Who is it!” Jo is instantly in a better mood, smiling and perking up in her seat.
Dean sighs, having resigned himself to being dragged out there. Don’t tell anyone, but he’s a little relieved to get out of the bunker.
Jack is escorted in by Castiel. He jumps up onto the bed with Marvelous Marvin the Talking Teddy in hand, pouting. Castiel finds a chair to sit down on.
“In Sam’s defense, Dean,” Cas says, and oh boy he’s gonna get ganged up on real quick, “it is uncharacteristic for you to-”
Lucifer snaps his fingers, and Jack’s gone- but wait. PAN DOWN and there’s TODDLER JACK, sitting in a little “I WUV HUGS” shirt and diaper. He immediately starts crying.
Jack jumps up and down, running over to Dean and hopping into his open arms. Miracle follows, barking up at him.
-), Cas leans in for a longer kiss, which is starting to be how he starts semi-emotional conversations, so Dean braces for it. He heaves a deep breath in and sighs.
The room’s a mess, more than usual, at least. Empty beer bottles and cans are everywhere, and lore books and papers are strewn everywhere. SPINNINGS CUTS showing the state of the mess, then DEAN stumbles into the room, carrying a bottle of whiskey.
Said how I was his son, and I’m not! And he made me small and this mean lady threw me here and it hurts! My insides hurt!
Dean tenses up immediately. Perfect timing, a homophobic family after... Sam and Dean share an “oh, great,” look then look back to the Browns. Sam catches another glimpse of Cece, then she runs up the stairs.
The nuns burn while staring into each others’ eyes, silently. CLOSE ON Dean’s eyes, welling up with tears and reflecting the flames perfectly.
It buzzed, and buzzed, and buzzed… Dean heard it the sound echo long after it stilled. He didn’t even care to silence it. Better to hear buzzing then… you changed me, Dean. I love you. Yet still he heard it. Over, and over, and over, like it was taunting him. You could’ve had this, Dean Winchester. You could’ve pulled your head out of your ass and been strong. Been brave. Held Cas and made him happy. Instead you’re here. Worthless. Broken. Failure. Dick.
Glenn’s eyes widen, and he exits out of frame. John walks toward Dean menacingly, holding a hand up, clearly about to strike.
Pastor John just snarls and lunges at him, and Robert scrambles out of the way just in time. He falls against the alley wall and shuffles to get up. He immediately starts booking it.
Look, I just said that the Queen is getting over here in a couple hours. Do you Winchesters know patience, or is that one of the things daddy forgot to teach you?
Rowena hums quietly in amused approval, then turns to Cas. “Castiel Winchester, do you take Dean to be your not so-”
Dean winces, with a little ringing sound effect. He clutches the handprint, where the pain is coming from, then inspects it further. Something’s up. Dean peels off his excessive layers, except for his T-shirt, which he bunches up to look at -
Just you, little teenybopper! C’mon, father and son again? Now I know, I know you’ve got a little bad blood with me right now but we’ll fix it! How does ruling the world, bringing paradise sound to you? Eh?
I-I regret…” He gives up on the sentence, satisfied that the meaning got across well enough when Cas starts squeezing him harder, like he’s gathering up Dean’s limp limbs and collecting them back into a person once again.
“Wow, taking steps to acknowledge your sexuality! Now that is character development I did not write you with, you stubborn son of a bitch.” Chuck teased.
“Well, some of us got to wing it, you prepared bastard.” Cas smiles a small, sweet smile. It feels like sunshine- and
, that you were not about to say any kind of derogatory slur against homosexuals. If it were up to me, you’d be permanently muted to the world so you’d never have the
Sam looks at the Djinn, then back to Dean, troubled. Eileen’s struggling to follow the conversation.
“It’s you, Dean.” Cas looks like he’s lost all discomfort and is just full of fondness. Good, because Dean’s being awkward enough for the both of them.
I was nothing but a soldier, a medium to conduct orders before I pulled Dean from hell. I felt nothing until this reckless, disobedient, infuriating man began to question me and my orders. Then I began to feel...
It took a week for Dean to start talking, really talking, more than one-word answers. Then it all spills out.
Lucifer reaches the actual bar, where there’s a half-dead guy crawling away from a tipped over stool. He kicks them once, twice, and then again just for good measure.
Dean opens the door slowly, looking a little more wrecked than before. He closes the door behind him, and walks over to hug Jack briefly, then kiss his forehead.
ANGLE ON the bunker door as it squeaks open. Dean stops in his tracks when he looks around. SLOW PAN to the War Room, covered in rainbows and bi pride flags along with balloons and streamers and all that gay festivity.
and for something with heart-melting emotional significance, there’s a lot of angry looks and silent treatments. As soon as Jack pops up and says
Dean runs his hand over his face and through his hair before it rests on his eyes again. He cries into his hand. Sam forcefully pulls him into an awkward, but consoling hug. Slow ZOOM OUT from the backseat, sobs and hiccups echoing.
Alright. Well, Jack, I am very old. I have lived through millenia, seen the history of the human race, the entire planet. And yet...
Jack pouts and plays with his teddy’s arms unenthusiastically. Then LIGHT BULB in that little, amazing brain of his.
Then all of the other angels and demons shambled out, forming a crowd of clearly confused celestial beings. Michael snapped, and they all disappeared.
It’s really a depressing scene, and Dean looks the part. He sighs. When the work is done, he dumps the broken glass into the trash can and sits on his bed, rubbing his hands over his face and sighing.
Look, whether you like it or not, we need your help on the case, and it’s only like an hour and a half away. Three Djinn working together. We hacked the traffic cams and tracked them to an abandoned warehouse outside of town.
I know you don’t, but c’mon, Dean. You could’ve told me. Even if dad wasn’t... you could’ve told me.
You’re really more afraid of some bitch than me? Me? I’m the father of sins, embodiment of evil! Who does she think she is?
“Dean? What-” Sam paused, glancing around frantically while Jack just focused their eyes on the handprint on Dean’s shoulder. “Where is Cas.” Sam asked, a finality to the statement, like he knew. He didn’t. He couldn’t.
CUT TO tears dropping down Dean’s face. He so desperately wants to say something, anything, but he can’t.
Dean’s anger was simmering, but what overtook it was defeat. “Yes,” he admitted, not even caring to correct that it was a could’ve-been-boyfriend, because how much more humiliating is that. Jack kept writing in a black substance. Dean didn’t pay enough attention to know what.
Cas then walked in, similarly shamble-y and zombie like in nature, wearing his trench coat over briefs. Also with- wait what the fuck?
What? No. I-I’m saying you’re flipping between this happy dad when Jack’s around to- to whatever you’re doing now.
Jack. I’m sorry about what Chuck did to you. But it’s nice to see you. In this new form, too. You’re finally safe.
It’s no stretch to say you were not quite a father, but a donor of seeds to a poor single mother that would raise us alone,
Thank you Jack, but I’m afraid you can’t. Too much power fluctuations in the Empty will... Well, I don’t know what and I’m not looking to find out.
"Jack's dead, Chuck's gone, I think it's time for me to move on." I don't have a use here, and you don't want me.
Deam smirks grimly, and Sam chuckles back with just about as much heart in it as Dean. At least they’re joking about it.
A dark blond, green-eyed man - ROBERT HARRIS - is shoved out of the back of some bar and into the muddy alleyway. It’s raining, and the road isn’t paved well. The camera tracks the motion, feeling a little dizzy. Robert scrubs his head, definitely drunk.
Robert gets to the church and swings the doors wide open before shutting them behind him in a panic. He leans against them, catching his breath.
Dean smirked. “Cas,” and it wasn’t really meant to be the start of a prayer, but Dean went with the flow. “Got your ears on? It’s time to come home. Let’s be happy on Earth instead of this shitshow.” Tears streamed down his face, eyes stinging, his heartbeat quickening, and a deep feeling that could’ve been anxiety, could’ve been excitement, and could’ve been love blossomed inside his gut.
Dean and Glenn are now actually making out like the teenagers they are, hands on each other’s faces, when the door of the motel room swings open. Dean immediately shoves Glenn away aggressively.
Eileen nods and grabs their backs, exiting the War Room. Then it’s just Dean and Sam. More tense silence passes, with a WIDE SHOT of the War room.
Then he's gone, and Dean can't say a word. He hears Castiel say his speech over and over again, each word, every meaning that could be behind them, sobbing on the ground. Usually, he'd get up. He'd know, Sammy needs me. I need to save him, I need to save Jack, and I need to save the world. All of that just stopped mattering when Castiel said everything, died, and left Dean, having never given him a chance to speak. He doesn't get up, not for hours. Not until he hears himself think,
I don’t think you’ll have to worry about that. I know that eventually, he’s going to go off the rails. Or... maybe I would.
Silence again. Dean couldn’t hear that, he couldn’t, not with those words echoing in his head over and over just taunting his stupidity.
,” Dean promises, with intense conviction, just staring at Cas’ expression, convicting it to memory.
Hey, hey, don’t worry about the bitch and Lucifer. We’ll get them, you’ll be safe, I’ll protect you.
PAN OUT on the warehouse, seeing the stars, the trees around it, and the impala resting in the makeshift driveway.
Oh, I don’t know, maybe the Djinn Queen and her, apparently, henchman Lucifer are gonna go after the kid? Ever think about that? You heard those nasty fuckers, they think he’s vital.
“It’s all we got,” Sam finished, sighing. That was all they ever had: barely a hope. TFW had scraped by for too long with barely a hope, and Sam was starting to wonder if joining Eileen in Heaven would be so bad.
Jack shakes his head. That seems pretty important, but oops, forgot to tell him. Dean’s clearly basking in the bittersweet memories.
Rowena had decided to officiate under no one’s approval, and she didn’t seek it. She said that they met in hell, they’re marrying by
Dean continues whimpering pitifully in Cas’ arms, trying to be quieter. “A-are- is mom still downstairs?” He feels the movement of Cas shaking his head softly.
Dean won’t stop staring into Cas’ eyes, at a loss for words. Sam holds back laughter, but a little snicker escapes.
“Oh, that’s Castiel, a good friend of the boys. He’s the angel that helped save them from Lucifer and Michael. A few times, actually,” Mary chuckles, kind of awkwardly. Not good memories.
Wait, really? Well get me the hell out of dodge, I’m so not digging the super hell thing, gotta say, Val. Get me outta here!
“No,” Michael questioned, “You aren’t a Reaper… or Death either, yet you wield that power. Unknowingly, and clearly lacking in skill, but you have it.” Michael seemed satisfied, and he took in another breath before the glowing eyes and boom Adam. Just like that. Adam was free, in control. “I thought we’d have to kill another Reaper or something,” he chuckled. No one else laughed. “Uh, well, let’s go get em.”
Then the silence stretches again. Dean looks around for reactions. Eileen and Sam don’t look surprised in the slightest, just borderline embarrassed and awkward. Shifting his gaze, he looks at his parents, utterly shocked. Mary looks like she has some gears turning, processing the information and trying to make it compute with what she’s previously seen. John looks- oh
Dean starts turning and weaving the Impala on a dirt road, a lot slower than we saw before. Eileen, Jack, and Sam are sleeping. Sam blinks his eyes open and adjusts to turn to Dean.
The screen switches to security footage. Faraway shots of Valeria and Lucifer slicing and dicing their way through the entire hotel lobby.
“Hello, Dean.” That greeting will never get old. And it’s ridiculous. Who even greets people casually with a
Well, I’ve been thinking. What if he’s continuing his work after death? No bodies have popped up, so I’m guessing he’s keeping his victims in the church and trying to convert them back to straight.
It’s a memory. Colors are dulled - this is not a particularly good one. Sam’s sitting at the Map table, staring into it with dead eyes, red and puffy. He’s been crying.
The Impala rolls into view on the street and parks by the sidewalk. It’s Sam driving. Dean glances back for a second.
Dean sighs, relieved. He lets a smile onto his face. CLOSE ON him and Castiel, finally. Jacting choices demand that Dean caresses Castiel’s face tenderly.
. That’s right- god was raised by two fancy gays!” Dean throws his arms out, staring down John and losing any inhibitions about saying exactly what he means. “And god made this heaven for you.” Dean begins to stare down at John, still sitting, threateningly. “He can take it away at any time.”
Mre Brown makes her way over to the couch, then sits down. She dabs her (not very) wet eyes with a tissue and gestures to the chairs across from her. Sam and Dean sit down there.
WIDE ANGLE ON confessional booths, all of them open, each with people tied to rebar sticks in the wood. Jenny’s there, too. Pastor John’s got his nails in Robert’s neck. FULL ON Robert and Pastor John.
Dean reaches out to hold Cas’ hand but glowing blue runes flicker between them, at the seam of the cell bars. Dean’s face has an unmistakable helplessness and hopelessness to it.
Yet Sam and Jack listened, and left Dean so, so alone. Like everyone always does. The door clicked shut, and Dean went back to his crying.
Djinn One throws Sam and Dean across the room, leaving them groaning against the wall, still weak. Eileen stabs Djinn Two in the heart immediately, the life draining out of their eyes then she prepares to continue the fight. Jerry has a significant amount of fury in his eyes for someone named Jerry, and he lunges at Jack, who drops Marvelous Marvin the Talking Teddy and falls against the wall.
We begin after the (made up) commercial break with Sam, Dean, and Cas slammed into their own respective wall spaces. (If there’s a drinking game going on, shots all around folks! They got slammed into a wall! How totally atypical!)
Said I was happy. Said it was fine, I was fine, when I lost you, o-or him, pick any of those times. Said I loved the hunting life. Wanted to go out swinging. Just you and me, and dad, way back when. The family on the road. That’s all I needed.
There’s a low, long thrumming that echoes through the Empty. A deep drone that keeps tapering off then back in. The muffled screams, whispers, and voices keep echoing as well.
Dean jolts as he’s transported. The Library is set as it was in 10x22, books piled up and thrown about. Castiel is on the ground, already bloody and beaten up, with another Fake Dean standing over him, stabbing the knife into the book nexto to Castiel’s head.
Dean opens his eyes to look back up at the ceiling for a beat. He scoffs and stares at the floor instead.
Now as much as I like the chit-chat, I’m not sticking around long. My brother’s needy, and if he knows I’m here he’s going to throw a tantrum. Listen carefully.
Sam tries not to look surprised that Dean gave in, but it takes him a moment too long to fix his expression and Dean’s continuing to glare at him.
Yeah, didn’t go well. And Sam started the apocalypse, I said yes to Michael... we’re all messes, buddy. We still care about you.
Dean takes a step back, trying not to get caught in the crazy bubble his brother is creating. “Woah, dude, no. Calm down. I just- y’know, got married. Well, engaged. We haven’t had a wedding. Um, yet.”
Thank you Sam, for the sentiment, but you don’t know- You don’t know the whole situation. I doubt he’s going to want me back for long.
Eileen nods, then scoots her chair closer to lean against Sam. She strokes his hand. PAN OUT to see them alone with Miracle, just sitting together for comfort. Sam sobs quietly, leaning into Eileen more.
Can’t we? I sure as hell know what it’s like. I thought you did, with Jess, with Amelia, with Eileen.
Sam stirs and tries to find his footing, but he’s chained up too high for his toes to touch the ground.
“Dean,” a deep voice soothes, suddenly close. Another sob shakes through Dean’s body. “Dean,” the voice insists. A distant part of Dean recognizes it’s Cas, but doesn’t do much with that information. All that comes and goes through his head is
I don’t know. Her sister’s almost 18 so they’re thinking about moving out then, and changing it so she’s Jenny’s legal guardian, but I don’t know.
Sam’s hunched over some books reading through them, his laptop opened behind them. Dean walks over and leans over Sam’s shoulder.
Anyway, we’re here to investigate these murders. They’re the same perpetrators we’ve seen across the nation.
“No no no, fuck you Cas, I’m going first,” he interjects, against their plans. “I’m gonna cry if you say your shit first and that’s not gonna happen.”
Dean looks at the bloody handprint and sighs. He closes his eyes and takes a moment to breathe deeply, then carries on as if Sam hadn’t said anything.
Eileen makes it to the bottom of the stairs, and Sam meets her there, stopping her from talking with a hug. He sniffles into her shoulder for a long moment, then steps back to sign to her:
“Sorry about that,” he offered, crossing his arms over his chest and uneasily shifting from one foot to the other. “I must've scared the hell out of you, man.”
Castiel found himself smiling not just at the similarity or the ecclectic collection of music, but at the sound of Dean’s deep laughter. It was the way his gooseberry green eyes crinkled at the corners whenever Castiel would nod that the song playing was indeed enjoyable to listen to. It was the smattering of freckles that decorated his delicate features -
The drive to town was an experience. After Cas spotted the shoebox full of cassette tapes under the passenger seat, Dean gave him a crash course on classic rock and the joys of Zeppelin. Half of it went over Cas’ head, but he enjoyed the mix of gritty guitars and experimental vocals and the way Dean excitedly skipped around from song to song.
“Have—” the boy broke off, clearing his throat, and looked around, scratching the back of his neck. “Have you been there the whole time?” he asked, voice deeply raspy. It was startling, and upon closer inspection, he didn’t look like the teenage boy Castiel dumbly assumed he was.
Castiel eyed the wooden house in front of him warily as he slammed the trunk shut. Though it was a grand three stories high it looked weathered enough to tip over at even the suggestion of a breeze.
Big big thank yous to everyone giving this little story a chance! You're all amazing humans and it warms the cockles of my heart <3 I love this fandom
It wasn't unlike the one he was occupying. In fact, the only difference was that the greenery surrounding it was in much tamer conditions.
be stupid,” Dean yelled, tugging Castiel towards his front door. “Get inside until the storm’s over!”
“So how’s the writing going?” Dean asked, turning to Castiel briefly. The roads were beyond deserted. Cas was pretty sure that if Dean let go of the steering wheel and kept his foot on the pedal for the next 40 minutes they would still get to town in one piece.
After a minute of watching Dean stare at a packet of tofu and chew over his bottom lip, the smooth bass of Dean’s voice broke the silence. “Crowley is kind of in between jobs but right now he’s interning at one of those corporation-y type places, and Jo runs this kind of hippie, spiritual store that sells candles and incense – that kind of thing.”
When the pair got back from their excursion into town, Castiel thanked Dean as he helped unload Cas’ share of groceries. He offered to reciprocate, but Dean insisted that he would be fine and that Sam would lend him a hand this time around. At the mention of Sam, Castiel let the subject slide and retired to his lake house.
Castiel got up from his spot, nervously wiping the sweat on his palms onto the sides of his slacks. “You, too, Dean.”
Dean nodded, he needed his release, he felt like he was one-hot-breath-on-his-cock away from coming all over himself.
“you ok?” Cas asks and caresses Dean’s back in a loving way that Dean is feeling overwhelmed at how someone can be so attentive to him.
“Cas..” Dean whispers and turns around half way, finally feeling his hands again and lifting them up to wrap around Cas’s neck and hug him tight. Cas caresses his back and they stay like that for a minute.
And the other thing was, he didn't even touch himself ever since that. He wasn't aroused at all, not even when waking up in the morning. He was a bit concerned.
“I am happy Dean. Thank you” Cas seems so at peace, Dean can’t help but give away a small shy smile, the one only Cas can bring out of him.
"Hey, Cas. m'sorry I didn't come say hello" Dean said shyly as he brushed his hand over the back of his head.
"I said, don’t move" Cas warned him again and slapped him hard on his already aching ass. Dean bit his lip
Dean didn't say a word, but when Cas put his hand over Dean's groin, he gasped he grabbed his hand instinctively, moving it away.
"Yes, please" Dean answered as their bodies collided together in a warm embrace. They pressed every part of their bodied they could to one another, Dean nuzzling his face in Cas' neck, and Cas stroking his body in soothing movements from his head to his back.
