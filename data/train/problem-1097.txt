Why? Why would John hide it? He needed support, he needed comfort, he needed love. Then why keep everything to himself? Why not talking about it like common people do? If anybody deserved to be happy, it was John.
“I’m still not entirely successful at associating the two of you,” Sherlock said out of the blue a few minutes after.
“Must be a client,” Sherlock said flatly, not ungluing his eyes from the rubik’s cube he held in his hands, his fingers moving so rapidly that John almost saw them blurry.
Was he really going to pretend that the texting happened to the point of pretending to give John his number like he didn’t knew it already? Wasn’t that just bloody childish?
Lost in his daze, too concentrated on his task, the detective only realized he was gradually moving toward John’s cock when his face was inches away from it. To see it from so close, observing every little detail of it, the subtle different shades of skin colour, the light hair, the way John’s cock twitched to the left in excitement, how a bead of semen was running down its length, Sherlock couldn’t resist and cocked his head to lick the precome. The taste didn’t surprise him so much. It was slightly more bitter than his own, but then again John drank more coffee. The detective couldn’t remember when but he had read somewhere that some food influenced the taste of sperm. John gasped loudly, screwing his eyes shot and grabbing Sherlock’s curls in his fingers. The sight of John made Sherlock completely forget about his train of thoughts. He looked up at his boyfriend, admiring his arched neck, loving how he felt he had control of the situation. John liked what he did, that was indisputable. With a smirk, he licked John from base to top. He kissed the head and took it in his mouth, sucking experimentally. John’s reaction was highly positive, moaning and jerking his hips. Sherlock fought a gag reflex, keeping John in his mouth, but his discomfort had been evident.
But then there was no understanding Sherlock’s reflexions and understanding his trains of thoughts about some things was the last thing John wanted, so he just played along, taking the card with a nod and bidding his flatmate goodbye.
Just as he was getting in the taxi, his felt his phone vibrate, notifying a text. Now, that was probably Mycroft bothering him or Lestrade asking a question about the case. Sherlock gave the direction to 221B to the driver before fishing the electronic device out of his pocket. When the picture he had received opened, the detective's eyes widened for a second.
“When we texted that night, I thought of you as being an dependant bossy drunk. And then I met you, and you were smart and talented and mature and calm. I never saw in you the hint that you could be as you were that night. It seemed so far away from the you I know, the you I like. It made me realized just how strong you are. I already knew you were strong, but you passed from one extreme to another and never plunged back. That’s not nothing.”
John stared back, and suddenly bursted laughing hysterically until a small smile brightened Sherlock’s features.
“I did an experiment to check which brand is the most resistant. There’s about ten boxes under the kitchen sink.”
I had a lot of fun writing this chapter, and I'm sure I'll have even more fun writing the next one! :)
Normally, feeling a hot, wet and sticky body against his would just be considered nasty. But the idea of their sweat, their saliva, their come mixed together,
Sherlock and John get to learn to live together and to know each other. Of course, this doesn't happen without tension and misunderstandings and without laughs.
And Sherlock and Mrs.Hudson both denied that they were smoking, but really it was most entertaining to watch them steal cigarettes to each other.
“So, how was your case? Did you find out who did it?” John asked as Sherlock appeared in the doorframe, fell in his chair and removed his scarf.
“Well, ok,” John said, bending and grabbing a shirt on the floor, putting it on and resting his back against the headboard next to his friend. He curiously checked what he was doing on his phone. He knew that was impolite, but Sherlock did it to him so often that John didn’t care if he did it to Sherlock anymore. “What do you want to do then?”
John agreed, because honestly, he wasn’t going to pass out on Sherlock Holmes asking him to fuck him. He removed his fingers and dropped a final kiss on Sherlock’s hole, feeling the man buck his hips as John straightened up, tearing open the condom package unrolling said condom on his shaft. He felt Sherlock struggling to turn around.
The first crime scene Sherlock had brought along John to. The moment they became who they were. The beggining of them, the duo, Watson and Holmes. Sherlock and John.
But then John playfully elbowed his flatmate's flank with a smile, and Sherlock smiled back a bit bashfully.
"Oh Sherlock", she answered while shaking her head, a little smile on her lips. "You are going to meet your new flatmate!"
"A new flatmate? Good, we can restart the bid on how long it'll take before you leave. I thought we needed some action at the office."
John opened the fly of the trousers and slipped his hand inside. His mouth started to water when he felt wetness against his fingers. Without waiting, he pulled Sherlock’s prick out of his pants, his dick standing proudly. John looked at it, his pupils blowing. It was long and slim, so soft, pink with little beads of precum pearling on the head, and
Anyway, John was one of the only persons Sherlock could stand talking to without rolling his eyes every two seconds, and if he was being honest with himself, the brunet had to admit that it did him good. He… appreciated John. And not just for his mind. Having someone around the flat was pleasant, too.
After a minute, Sherlock installed himself fully on top of John, his forearms resting on each side of his head as he nipped at John’s lips. The doctor moaned in response, his hands fisting Sherlock’s hair. He had always wondered if it was as soft as it looked, had always dreamed about feeling those dark curls between his fingers. Now he could. He kissed Sherlock back fiercely, rediscovering the surface of his palate, the velvety of his tongue. The detective moaned back, his hips jerking a little against John’s thigh. Undeniably, he had felt John’s erection, obvious and uncomfortably compressed in his trousers. Sherlock separated their mouths with a little gasp, looking into John’s eyes, his pupils dilated, eyes dark passionate, asking for a permission. John nodded vigorously, trying to move so his hips would arrived flush with Sherlock’s. He needed to feel Sherlock, needed him to be exactly where John wanted him.
“We’re not going to…” Sherlock asked, looking suddenly unsure, as if he just realized where they had been going.
Weeks later, John was sure that Sherlock loved him. It was undeniable, just seeing how the man acted toward him. When he asked Sherlock, conversationally, one evening as they were talking a walk, why he hadn’t said the words back then, Sherlock answered, confused, “It was obvious I reciprocated the feeling. What was the utility of me saying it?”
Sherlock put his hands on John’s hip to still him, bobbing his head a few times to see how far he could go without feeling uncomfortable. When he felt he found the right ratio, he did experimental swirls of his tongue on the head and across the slit accompanied by sucks. John breathed with difficulty, alternating on staring heavy lidded at Sherlock or resting his head on the pillow to groan. God, the technicality of it was so much more complicated than it seemed, Sherlock thought. But when he got the hang of it, making sure he was doing correctly, he permitted his mind to relax and to enjoy it. John was scraping his nails against his scalp, urging him on, and it felt so bloody fantastic, soothing him and arousing him at the same time. He brought one hand to John’s balls, his eyes rolling back in his head when he found them hard and full, so on the edge of orgasm. He loved the weight of the dick settled on his tongue, how it filled him, how he was filled with John and he couldn’t help but wonder just how much better it would feel in his arse. The thought made him moan, and the vibrations ran through John’s cock and made him escape a small cry. Suddenly he pulled out of Sherlock’s mouth, smearing a trail of precome on his cheek by accident as he did. He looked down at the brunet, almost coming when he saw him run his thumb across his cheek and slowly suck it in his mouth, eyes never quitting John’s as he did. And Jesus, where had he bloody learn to do
“You really never learn,” John said ironically. Sherlock made him an unpleased face, all scrunched. The soldier just laughed.
I wasn't sure about this at first but turns out I really loved writing it, it was so fun! Thank you all guys for asking me to do so! And especially to vertige, who gave me the inspiration. :)
"Chose your words carefully young man", the landlady warned with an unhappy tone as she took his tea back to the kitchen.
“Hello John,” a partly bald, red haired man greeted with a not totally warm smile. He pointed the tip of his umbrella toward  the hallway. “Mind if I come in?”
"No," Sherlock answered slowly, as if he was still trying to determine if it was the right answer. "You?"
Broken. So obviously broken. And hiding it. He realized it now. The first person to fool the great Sherlock Holmes.
“Doing what?” What happened to make John’s attitude switch like that? It has been a pleasant evening, no?
People were so annoying. That’s why he hadn’t been able to find a decent flatmate until a fortnight ago. The old ones would blab about their day and TV and their families and complain about anything he did… Sherlock had to mute them almost all the time so that he could think, and it was so exhausting. In less than a week he had thrown all of them out. John, though, John wasn’t that bad. (Well, apart from his tantrum about his consulting detective card, what was wrong with it?) He did talk a bit too much sometimes, but at least he wasn’t wasting his saliva on irrelevant information. He also inquired Sherlock about his cases and asked questions, suggesting not completely idiotic theories. Plus, he let Sherlock do his things without arguing, even though if sometimes he would shot him quizzical glances.
Sherlock seemed on the edge of retorquing, but apparently he changed his mind and started to talk about the samples he would need and how John will have to help him.
The two men have been back in the house for four hours now. John had learnt quite a while ago already that there was no point in waiting for Sherlock when the latter was thinking. It was just too long and he told John to shut up every time he only opened his mouth. The doctor had no idea how Sherlock even knew he was about to talk, his eyes were bloody closed!
The detective looked down at him. John made him a questioning face and then Sherlock advanced a step toward his flatmate.
“Another blog post? Don’t you think people are tired of your stories already? You make them all so…” he made an unclear gesture with his hand. “fanciful. You don’t develop enough what’s relevant.”
The rest of the dinner past swiftly, and John was able to forget about the whole incident as he listened, fascinated, to what Sherlock was explaining and tried to see things as the detective saw them, so he could, hopefully, be able to deduct them too one day. There was no bill to pay since Angelo adored Sherlock so much, and they headed back home. It was snowing outside, something extremely rare in London even if they were at the beginning of February. John looked at the snow, amazed by the sheer beauty of it in the darkness of the street. He could only see it when the flakes passed in front of the dim yellow light of the street lamps, like little spots of magic, and suddenly he longed for Christmas.
“I’m feeling like meat.” The doctor took one of Mrs.Hudson’s cooking magazines lying on the coffee table and flipped through the pages before stopping on one. “Look, that seems appetizing,” he indicated to Sherlock, pointing the picture of red peppers stuffed with ground beef. “Can’t be too complicated, it’s a level two of difficulty.”
"Yes," answered Sherlock briefly, and got up. "Might be a serial killer. I know you can't come, you're working from one to seven," he continued before John could say exactly that. "I'll text you if I need you."
“I should invent a new version of cluedo,” said Sherlock, ignoring John’s last comment. “So that intelligent people could play and actually have fun.”
"John's fine, I promise he won't say a word of your little gossip. He's my best man," the detective said while turning around, punctuating the end of his sentence with an enormous fake smile.
John shook his head, amused, before grabbing Sherlock’s hair and pulling him down for a light kiss. He could do that now. He was allowed to kiss Sherlock whenever he wanted.
John smiled softly, holding his gaze, then bent his head and pressed a soft but heavy with meaning kiss on his ankle. Sherlock’s breath itched, and John smiled, sliding his lips up on Sherlock, dropping lingering kisses on his way. His fingers linked with the brunet’s owns. He dropped light kisses on his eyelids, his cheekbones, his forehead, his chin, making the detective chuckle softly. Then John froze and swore.
They were so many new desires and sensations running through him that is was overwhelming. So many things he’d never even given a second thought to before. But now, looking at John, his John, he wanted things he never thought he would in his whole life. He felt the urge to press a soft kiss on each of the blond’s eyelids. He longed to map the surface of his chest with his lips, with his hands, to learn the feel of him, to have it imprinted on his hands, in his mind. He needed to feel the weight of John’s cock against his tongue, the thickness and hotness of it down his throat. He wanted his flatmate to moan for him, wanted to drive him incoherent with pleasure, to show him Sherlock could give him things like that. He wanted to tear John apart and put him back together. His finger itched from the urge to stroke the line of John’s jaw, his lips tingled to feel another kiss pressed to them. He wanted to whisper words in John’s ear that would usually make him gag with disgust. And it was irrational. And it should be annoying, but it wasn’t.
"Don't worry. I understand that you were frustrated, it was perfectly normal." Something was of with his voice, but John thought better than to push it.
"I really don’t understand the use of the word ‘mate’ in ‘flatmate’. It implies that we appreciate each other, which might not be the case."
They separated after a few seconds, looking at each other in the eyes. They seemed bright in the obscurity of the night.
John shivered, needing all the thin self-control he had not to whimper at that. Slowly, he passed his palms on the back of Sherlock’s thigh until his fingers were close to the entrance, slowly rubbing it in lazy circles. Sherlock groaned he wanted more and squirmed The blond increased the pressure around his hole. When he thought the muscle felt loose enough, he coated some lube in his hands, warming it up. “Yes, yes, yes,” he could hear Sherlock whisper. As gently as he could, he pushed his index until it was in to the first knuckle.
“Honestly, Sherlock, I have barely given a thought about Mark or my sister or the army since I arrived.”
Dear. That was certainly not pleasant to write. The last thing he needed to spend a nice night was to imagine the genitals of a stranger. How irrelevant was it anyway, imagining something on which you have no information.
“Mike, can I borrow your phone, there’s no signal on mine,” the stranger said without even looking at them. He was sitting at one of the counters, obviously concentrated on something.
"You’re worst than my mother", Sherlock grumbled as he took a sip of his tea, just before the cup disappeared under his hands.
“I was telling you that the last thing he said to me-” the poor lady began before she was interrupted anew.
“John,” Sherlock said with the hint of a smile and yet completely serious features, “do you really think you can make love to me without me needing to see you?”
And yet, there he was. Staring eye to eye with John Watson, their breaths the only sound in the quiet intimacy or their flat, in the most peaceful surroundings, and he was scared.
Sherlock sat up and bent so his face was in front of John’s. He looked at him intensely before a fond smile decorated his lips and he kissed him chastely. He left John smiling back and got up to go to the bathroom.
This is only the second time I write a long, described smut, and I'm not so sure about how good it is, I hope you guys will like it! Feedback would be hugely appreciated!
Foreplay, he remembered. People consider it important. Well, most people. He wasn’t sure what this man wanted, but better safe than sorry.
“Sherlock, there’s someone for you downstairs,” Mrs.Hudson informed the man, her head poking from the doorframe.
“Ashamed of my card? It’s not ridiculous, I thought the design looked professional and classy. Don’t you like it?”
The doctor dropped the lightest of kisses on Sherlock’s heart through his shirt, soothing him. “Let’s take one thing at a time.” Gently, he pushed his flatmate down so he was lying on top of him, Sherlock looking up at him with wide, dark eyes. John brushed his cheek over the line of Sherlock’s jaw, then buried his nose in the brunet’s neck and inhaled the clean, manly scent of him. He brushed his lips all along Sherlock’s throat until his shirt prevented him from going further. His hands found the buttons, opening them one by one and discovering the milky silk of Sherlock’s chest. When the piece of clothing was open, he tentatively pressed a kiss to one of those little, pink nipple offered to him. Sherlock tensed, taking a sharp breath, and John backed off a little.
I'm sure you recognized the tiny bits of dialogue I used from the BBC. I have no rights over it and will not use it again. It was just fitting well, but the rest will all be original writing.
“No,” John answered, guiding them to the detective’s bedroom. They walked inside and the blond turned around to face his flatmate.
“Ah, yes, of course, me too,” he answered after a second of bemusement, not used to affectionate contacts anymore. He put out his hand, but she kissed his cheeks instead.
John had long understood that that was the argument that made Sherlock do anything. Well, apart from getting the groceries.
The man cut the parrot’s ovary in his microscope with a little too much force than necessary. It broke. With a grunt, he removed the glass rectangle and threw away the egg.
“Sherlock,” he said before kissing him again, and Sherlock grabbed John’s waist softly. The cold air suddenly seemed hot as they kissed. John’s mouth was so warm. Sherlock’s lips were so soft.
John's face fell when the realization hit him, something turning upside down in the pit of his stomach. "You really didn't know." It wasn't a question.
"I'm off on a case with Lestrade," said Sherlock while looking on his phone where he was lying on the couch. "Some man at a carnival murdered. Inidentificable organic matter was found in his head. Seems of entomological origin. Lestrade wants me to take a look."
“Mycroft,” the detective said after an over exaggerated sigh. “Couldn’t find the Queen’s feet to kiss so you had to settle to mine? How flattering.”
The meal ended up not being so bad, and the detective had to admit John had been right. Eating homemade food was good. They had a lot of fun while finishing the cooking, and even more talking together as they ate.
The soldier followed his flatmate into the other room, freezing a bit when he found him lying on his stomach on the floor, crawling while watching scrupulously through his pocket magnifying glass and occasionally sniffing the ground.
The man bent and carefully captured John’s lips with his. He stilled for a fraction of second before John kissed him back, grabbing his dark locks.
Sherlock hummed impatiently to close the subject, fisting his hand in John’s short hair and pressing their mouths together, pulling with his teeth at John’s lips and stroking the inside of his mouth with torrid, slow but firm strokes of his tongue. The kiss went up and down in intensity like a roller coaster, the two men losing themselves in it when after a few minutes, Sherlock suddenly tore his mouth away with a gasp, feverish eyes looking up at John. He called his name with a little, breathy voice, lips glistening from the kiss. John held his gaze for a second before dropping one last light kiss to his bow of a mouth and sitting on his knees, fumbling for the lube.
“What? Yes, of course,” the man answered. Did he really let his stress show that much? He thought he had been doing well.
“What are you thinking about?” the said man asked at the exact moment, reading all the musing in the depths of Sherlock’s eyes.
The next morning he blocked the man’s number on his phone, trying not to have second thoughts on that decision.
“You avoid looking at me and you barely talk. You also seem annoyed because you keep sniffing, that’s something I’ve remarked you do when you are unpleased. Plus you-”
"This is a big day", she told with what seemed like a real enthusiasm, leaving the detective confused.
“Yes,” Sherlock answered, getting up after John and reaching for his violin, the music soon filling the flat.
"Oh Jesus." John head bent, passing his hands on his face as he took a deep inspiration. "I'm sorry for anything I-"
Sherlock stayed motionless until John was out of sight. Then he let his tense muscles relax, feeling his body sink in the cushions. He brought his hands together under his chin and closed his eyes, letting out a long breath he didn’t know he had been holding. Everything was chaotic in his head, informations passing to fast for him to analyse and bumping against each other. He shook it to clear his mind.
“Yes, I can. The instructions are just advice, I can change some things to adjust to my taste if I like.”
John whispered, “Soon, soon, patience love,” and leaned down to nuzzle the curve at the bottom of Sherlock’s spine, still working him open with his fingers. He pushed on his prostate irregularly, knowing that if any man liked not knowing what was up and variety in bed, it was Sherlock Holmes. The latter was shaking slightly under him, his breathing a little bit laboured. John added another finger when he felt confident enough, feeling Sherlock’s hand fist in the sheets. They continued like this for another few minutes before Sherlock half snapped half pleaded, “John, I can’t handle this anymore, I need you in me, right now!”
“Jesus! What, I need to bloody say it so you stop avoiding it?! Fine. We sexted. You and I. What more do I have to say so you stop being a complete cock?!”
Of course, there had been some less dramatic events. Some quite funny, actually. Apparently, after they became a couple, Sherlock decided that walking around the flat naked was no longer a problem. Which it wasn’t. Except that clothes were no longer deemed necessary as soon as he was inside the flat, and he put them on only when he had to leave. It was quite entertaining at first. And it generated a lot of sex. Sex in rather original places. That was until Mycroft walked in on Sherlock playing the violin naked in the sitting room with John quietly reading a book on the sofa. That led to John forcing Sherlock to put clothes on, and funny enough, to Mycroft suddenly knocking each time he came to visit, which John didn’t hate at all.
“Jesus, Sherlock, we’re not twelve,” John said angrily, dropping his newspaper on his lap. “Why did you give me your card? It was bloody ridiculous. Are you ashamed of it that much?”
Sherlock seemed to be taken by surprise by the sound of John’s voice, being too lost in his thoughts. Quickly he regained his senses. "No. It happened before you knew me, therefore you didn’t imagine me and didn't have sexual attraction for me specifically. That makes it ok."
"Ready to go meet him?" Mike asked as John opened the door of his sister’s flat. He really had no other places to go, since Mark threw him out after the break up.
Some people liked to be dominated, Sherlock knew. He remembered Irene. The detective took that chance, waiting to see if his correspondent would be reactive.
Silence fell over the room. The couple of seconds it lasted seemed to stretch into hours, the sound of John’s angry respiration becoming uncomfortably loud.
am here,” Sherlock said, walking past him to inspect the crime scene. John looked at the inspector, waiting for a permission anyway. The man just sighed again and nodded.
The two men worked together on undressing themselves, their movements hasty and precipitated, not sensual yet sensual at the same time. It was rough and gentle touches, bites and sweet kisses, and Sherlock didn’t know what to anticipate, how to prepare his mind, and it just felt good, so good, to let his mind be free. Another amazing thing John had brought to his life. They just seemed to keep piling up.
He looked down at John, and John suddenly remembered Sherlock had really no experience in this. He would have to lead him, to show him. And that was such a weight, he thought. He wanted to make it perfect, because Sherlock, Sherlock who had live alone and in coldness for years, who has never been in a relationship before, deserved it more than everybody else, and he should feel nothing but loved and cared for and protected. And it was humbling, to have all that trust put in him, and it was equally so stressing. John internally calmed himself, being steady for his friend. They’d go one step at a time.
. Sherlock was trying. Really trying to make an effort. To show John that he liked him more than he usually liked people. That he cared. Ugh. He had asked John if he was alright. That was showing care, wasn’t it? And he tried his best to make him smile. And now he offered him a day off in his company because he knew John liked to stay in and he knew John liked him. I mean, Sherlock was giving him his
“Lestrade,” the brunet greeted to a grey haired man who was currently talking rather fiercely on his mobile. As soon as he saw Sherlock, he told over the line, a little bit fumbling to find the words, “Eh, I’ve got, eh, backup that just arrived, I’ll call you back.”
Gently, he inserted the head of his cock in, freezing when he heard Sherlock take a sharp intake of breath, eyes closing tight in pain. None of them moved for a moment, letting the detective adjust, but
“John,” Sherlock said, staring at him in the eyes with an urgency and a plea even though his voice was calm. The doctor nodded, and Sherlock inversed their position, pushing John’s shirt over his head. Straddling his lap, the detective looked down at John’s naked chest, something hot and reverent burning in his eyes. He passed a hand up and down on it, feeling the sparse blond hair tickle his palm. Experimentally, he stroke his thumb on John’s nipple, and the latter let out a contented sigh. Encouraged by the reaction, he pinched it, and John closed his eyes, arching his neck. Sherlock continued to explore, thrilled to see his flatmate react so positively under his ministrations, to see he could make John like that with his hands and not just his words. He drank the sight of him, drank all those little huffs of pleasure coming out of his mouth.
John arched an eyebrow, starting to forget the fact that they were currently having a conversation in his bed, while he was clad in nothing but pants.
But John wasn’t listening to him anymore. He needed to concentrate on his balance because he felt the hot breath of Sherlock across his cheek and his legs suddenly went wobbly. He closed his eyes, relieving in the feeling of Sherlock’s heat radiating to him and in the soft baritone of his voice, and if only he could just-
“It’s very good,” the soldier answered with a satisfied nod. “I could actually see myself living here.”
“My turn,” he told Sherlock hoarsely. He needed to touch him again. Never, ever stop. Couldn’t stop. John had to make Sherlock feel beautiful.
“Not exactly,” Sherlock said, amused, and bent to press his lips to John’s. The latter closed his eyes and let Sherlock lead, happy to just lean against him and enjoy the moment. He could continue to kiss Sherlock till he drowned. He never wanted to stop.
All except that Sherlock he had texted the night before and that Sherlock he had met that morning. Which apparently happened to be the same person.
John started to suck on the neck exposed to him, and this time he was sure Sherlock gasped, arching his neck until his head rested on John’s shoulder. Carefully, the doctor closed his free hand around Sherlock’s shaft. The hard bulge he found there gave him shivers of anticipation, and he rubbed his palm on it. The detective groaned, pushing his hips into John’s hand, and the latter decided he rather liked that reaction.
“No, no,” John answered quickly. “I just thought we could talk and maybe… cuddle for a bit.” That sounded a tat ridiculous to say to Sherlock Holmes, but God knows he had been wanting just that for days.
“Come on, mate, don’t be so difficult. It’s going to be fun. You could gather information on cooking or something.”
Sherlock kept his eyes riveted on the ceiling, his head shaking imperceptibly. “I didn’t think it would go that far yesterday. I couldn’t think about it before it happened. Now you’re seeing me.”
“The name’s Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221B Baker Street. Afternoon!” he said with a wink before closing the door without another word, Mike waving at him.
"You know I can't leave work between two patients, right? You'll have to wait until my shift is over."
Curious, and a bit confused because that didn’t sound like Sherlock at all (Sherlock talking about romance?), John looked around. That’s when he noticed another note higher in the stair case. And another. And another, all leading to the room where the crime scene had been.
“No, you don’t,” the mysterious man answered with another weird smile, walking in without any further authorization.
John let out an irritated huff of air, getting up and aiming for his room. “There’s no point in talking to you.”
“Well, we open a recipe book, and we choose one and make it. Easy.” It was incredible how sometimes when Sherlock talked John had the feeling he was four years old, and sometimes while talking to Sherlock he had the impression he was talking
“John?” Mike called, placing himself in the former’s field of view and therefore unfocusing his intense stare. “So? the fat man asked with a smile. “What do you think?”
The two men moved to the center of the bed, John kneeling and Sherlock imitating his move. The blond placed himself behind Sherlock. The loss of his wonderful hands left the John cold and wanting, but it had come as a relief, too. He was getting hard just with Sherlock looking at him, and he wanted this night to last longer than the previous one.
“You are,” Sherlock said with the same voice he used when he had asked John if he was alright a few days ago. After a couple of seconds of stillness, John turned around and grabbed Sherlock’s tea, passing the cup to him. Of course, he didn’t say thank you. He just took it, still looking at John, before he suddenly looked down at his ovaries.
John stared at this man, this most paradoxical man, strong and vulnerable, pure and having seen the worst atrocities of life, shy and yet confident, and wondered how he ever thought he had been in love with any of his exes when he felt such a connexion, such an adoration that were so much more than he ever experienced, so much he wasn't even sure he could handle it. He realized, with no small amount of fear, that he might be in love with Sherlock Holmes. The mere thought of it freaked him out.
So John walked around the table until he reached his friend, bending so his eyes would be at the same height as Sherlock’s.
“Well give me your phone number, I’ll text you and we’ll see which one is faulty,” Sherlock suggested, imitating the doctor and sitting down.
, it was making his dick twitch. He wanted them to be one, and he thought no one except John Watson could ever be such an amazing being that
Their pace started to accelerate as their shaky breathing became panting, the two of them gripping what they could and breathing in each other’s mouth instead of kissing, the jerk of their hips now erratic. John bit hard on Sherlock’s lip as he came, moaning long and loud as he clutched at his flatmate’s back.
“Fucking wuss!”  Victor is very angry. “Damned  sissy! You’ll  drop out the uni like  a champagne cork!”
After a little pause the man  says as  if he hadn’t any doubts: “Baker Street, 221 B. Good luck, John!”
And John feels warm in his  heart that he guessed the author of the unknown number SMS. A couple of times he understands that some teachers give him an easy time and he thinks that it is also Sherlock’s influence. But as he has no evidences, he decides  to let everything stay as is.
-Oh my God, Sherlock, - the inspector is deeply amazed and so is John, - how did you guess about asthma?
John reminds their first quarrel  and he is petrified for a moment. Then he tries to leave Sherlock’s hugs. Sherlock doesn’t  keep him but  he is looking at John as if the fate of the whole world, or at least the fortune of Great Britain depends on  his answer. John is  ashamed of his complexes but he understands it is necessary to overcome.
She is waiting for coffee and John is making it with awe. Before giving it to Molly he add some cinnamon as it is one of the John’s favourite combination which was found when he experimented with different additions. Molly takes the cup silently and puts it on the tabke near the window. Sherlock stops  for a moment before  having a swallow and John can’t stand looking at him. When their looks meet John’s cheeks are flushing. Oh, his cheeks betray him. This is his reactive possibility to colour different parts of his body in the colours of his mental turmoil. This is exactly that  awful possibility to be blamed for his redden face under Sherlock’s examining look. John doesn’t look away in order not to show his weakness but at this moment he understands the guinea pigs. He is a little and helpless guinea pig under Sherlock’s eyes, as he is examining him carefully. Certainly, this foolish flirting will not have any good end.
“It’s for you,” says Molly, returning John back from his trance, “ he’s  asked to tell you to sleep well at last
Making the tenth cup of coffee John suddenly realizes that it is rather dangerous to add any additions to the coffee without any asking because Sherlock can have an allergy. That’s why the next cup with coffee if followed be a little saucer with ginger and a glass of pure water. Molly is surprised . She raises  her eyebrows  up but doesn’t give any comment. She stands a little bit longer near Sherlock’s table and John is catching their eyes and is very nervous. They are speaking about him. When Molly returns John tries not to stare at her.
John has almost convinced himself that all Sherlock’s visits to the café are random  and didn’t ever demonstrate his interest to John. John thinks about the possibility to find another work just not to be caught with this Sherlock’s attractiveness. But there are a lot of problems to find a part-time job for students connected with the schedule and John clearly imagines  all the difficulties connected with  leaving of the café. The best way is to ignore Sherlock and be sure he doesn’t’ exist at all, to forbid his silly heart to beat faster under the glance of grey (or may be blue?) eyes. John falls asleep at dawn, his cheek on the notebook with chemistry  formulas. In his dream he and Sherlock  are walking  around the park.
He jerked in his fist, breath shallow and beads of sweat on his forehead, the image of his flatmate behind his eyelids. Oh, all the things Sherlock had texted, the pictures he had painted with words only made John’s cock twitch eagerly against his belly. He had reread those texts so many times, he knew them by heart now.
“If I were still at my sister’s, alone with alcohol stashed everywhere instead of here with you, I can tell you I would have plunge back.”
“Oh John,” Sherlock said with a little smile. “I want to try everything with you. Discover it with you.”
“Absolutely not, hearing her reasoning makes me what to throw myself of the rooftop. Doesn’t it makes you go nut?”
“Oh. Thank you.” He seemed a bit surprised. He got up and reached for the device. John made sure to open a new text conversation before the other man could see the messages he had received the night before.
Yes. Getting out of that depressing hole could only do him good. That Sherlock clearly had enough energy to share, at least, if he had no other qualities.
The doctor made his way inside the building, stopping in front of the stairs. He waited, listening for any sound telling him where Sherlock was, in vain. He called his boyfriend’s name a few time, with no answer. He sighed in exasperation once again, pinching the bridge of his nose, when he noticed a piece of paper scotch taped to the banister of the stairs. Carefully, he detached it, recognising the messy handwriting of Sherlock on it, but it seemed like Sherlock put the effort for it to be neater than usual.
They walked in silence, him in contemplation and Sherlock apparently lost in his thoughts. It was comfortable, sort of recomforting. It was their usual routine, and it made John feel good to have a routine with someone. He had never stayed in a relationship long enough to have little moments like this, and he found out he loved it.
“But I wanted to rim you before,” the doctor complained, lightly nipping at one of Sherlock’s cheeks. “Work you open with my mouth and fuck you with my tongue. Lick you and discover the taste of you while you beg me to take you.” He licked the crease between Sherlock’s buttcheeks. “I’m sure you beg beautifully.” A flick of his tongue to Sherlock’s hole. He wasn’t sure if he imagined the brunet shivering or not.
Thank you everybody who kudos or comments this fic, it warms my heart and just makes me want to write more.
The first “I love you” had been quite an awkward affair, too. John didn’t know what he had been expecting, but it hadn’t been that. He should have seen it coming, though, considering he knew how his brain lost all inhibition as soon as Sherlock started deducting. John suddenly started praising him anytime Sherlock started analyzing something, and the doctor couldn’t even stop himself. That’s how, one day, Sherlock had been crouching in an abandoned canoe close to the Thames, looking through his magnifying glass at mud shaped in footprints, saying, “Obviously the teenage girl was pushed into the water by her canoe partner because she wanted her out of the solo competition in two weeks, then paddled to the shore and ran away into town. Probably to an ice cream parlour. We need the check all the ice cream parlours close to here. The footprints of mud, their hair and the brand of solar cream they brought with them give you all the evidence you need.”
Sherlock didn’t know what to answer, too confused by his situation and about what he had just done. Remembering what he had heard some boys talk about in high school, he went to take a cold shower, hoping it would help fixing his problem. He didn’t get much rest that night.
“You will tell me what you got in this time,” says he angrily and begins cleaning his face with a soft sponge without asking any permission.
"If you wish I close the cash desk and count the day’s receipts," John voice sounds awful as he clearly imagine that it will not safe him from the scandal.
Sherlock is absent for next week and these  days are the worst ones  in John’s life . He goes to work, prepares hard for his seminars and labs, works in the café but he doesn’t live at all. Molly expresses her sympathy  with him but her sympathy is worse than  having a knife in the heart. It seemed so right cause John just wanted to become free from Sherlock but now his world doesn’t have its colours, smells and sounds. John squirms and every night he is waken up with erection  after dreams in which Sherlock takes his hand and looks at him without saying a word. Just takes his hands. And John wakes up and cries in his pillow trying not to disturb Mike, and then masturbates in the shower trying not to say Sherlock’s name. Awful days.
Having got up he understands that it will be very uneasy to realize all his night decisions. He spends his Sunday repairing his gaps in chemistry Mike brings him a glass of coffee and a doughnut and that’s the only John’s meal for the whole day. To tell the truth , any food got stuck in his throat, but John’s brain need calories to work and that’s why John chokes the  fancy pastry and caffeine down. The last lab is done at 4 am. John pushes the notebook away and decides to play truant and not visit the morning lectures. He let himself slip to dream. His dreaming is uneasy but deep and he gets up being completely another person, Having a shower he furiously rub himself with a bath sponge as if he tries to tear his poor  and completely unnecessary love off  and let all his thoughts , memories and dreams about Sherlock  to be taken with the soap foam and change the smell of Sherlock’s expensive perfume, which is saved in his memory, for the smell of citrus gel. He wasn’t in love, isn’t in love and he is free from all these silly things, deviant wishes and whim. Tonight John is going to ask Molly Hooper for a date and tomorrow will have its own plans to stop thinking about Sherlock. Never more. It’s a life plan of John Watson, the student of the first year student of the medical faculty before long.   And he is prepares for his work trying to ignore the annoying pain in his heart.
“ I haven’t broken off, I haven’t lost myself ” says Sherlock quietly as an answer for all John’s troubles unspoken, “no connection with drugs. I’ve just had no meals recently. I was busy.”
“why did you switch away your phone?” asks  John. “Fuck, I’ve sent you a hundred of messages but you just switched your mobile off.” John feels anger and revenge and tries to keep himself under the control.
“I say, that it’s fantastic” answers John.” Nobody can guess that you’re deaf. You are a detective, you help the  police and you are deaf. How can you do it?”
Sherlock’s fingers are thin and nervous but they also are careful and cool. He hardly touches John’s wounds , treating them with disinfection liquid , spreading the ointment and pasting the bandage on. Sometimes he blows on damaged skin to relief the pain and John  feels that he is out of reality. He reminds their first quarrel and that he gave Sherlock the first aid after it. And John loses his head as Sherlock stand too close to him and he breath his  scent and tries to remember it and to control  his heart, asking  it to  stop beating so violently. Sherlock finishes his manipulations and say with a short giggle:”Alright. Unfrozen.”
But the only thing he is able to do is to have a shower and goes to bed. He sleeps soundly. Morning meets him with a message from an unknown number: “How is your sister? Sh.”  John things for a moment and writes the answer: “Thanks. Everything is returning to normal.”
“OK,” John nods, “I wanted to be  sure that you are…” and John chokes with the word “fine” because Sherlock isn’t fine at all. He looks worse than when John was offended at him. Sherlock looks as if he were about to give up the ghost. “…alive,” says John at last. “Could I ask some questions?”
John successfully passes his winter and moves to Sherlock just before Christmas. They celebrate the holiday together but just after twelve an Inspector Lestrade’s message  comes to Sherlock’s phone. John doesn’t want to stay alone and they arrives to the place of the crème together.
“I don’t need any charity,” answers John and his face flashes but Sherlock covers his hand with his cool hand and John’s heart goes galloping.
"Coretto, " another client wants a cup of coffee and John  unwillingly takes his eyes off. He tries to persuade himself that there is no flirt but it is just a complement from the chef. The history continues under the dirty look of Victor and dreamful look of Molly. Sherlock and John haven’t moved more than one cup of coffee but it seems to John that he’s rushing down the steep slope and he hast lost the moment to stop this race. John has no ideas about Sherlock’s thoughts.
“Our boy has romped a lot.” Victor gives his voice behind John’s heart and John thinks how long has he been standing here, “Oh, any junkie can’t be former. I’ll leave earlier today if you aren’t against.”
Victor adds some oil to the fuel:"Oh, our dude comes with his boyfriend. What did I say – he is a bitch! Wagged his behind and found this fucking fop."Victor is emitting with poison and anger."I say, Johnny,  it is no-win situation  for you, poor thing. You’re going to flunk out  against him. It’s no chance for a guy like you."
-I never guess, I know, - Sherlock sounds irritated and John leaves the place because it is unbearable for him to listen to Sherlock  as he clearly understands how miserable his role in the life of this handsome and gorgeous man is . And this understanding kills him.
-	Keep off this place, it’s not a theatre – he’s irritate and looks at John who is waiting for Sherlock to stand up for him. – It’s a place of the crime . No trespassing, please.
And name the place she’s passing by. And something awful happens next. John’s ear catches the screeches of brakes , gritting of metal and  the clatter of the smashing glass. John’s hands begin trembling, he is looking unconsciously  at his phone and he isn’t able to call Harry by her name. The call is ended and John returns to himself.
“A pure accident…” Sherlock echoes his words,” A pure accident… Oh my god, John, I’m scared when I think that you wouldn’t come and I would lose my temper.” He looks  completely shocked  and frightened. And John also finds this idea frightening.
John cries it so loud that only a deaf wouldn’t be able to ignore his words but Sherlock leaves him anyway. He even doesn’t turn his head just disappears in a crowd. Why he didn’t believe John?  Or believed? Maybe, John words scared him? He hasn’t ever told John about his feelings. And John suggests that it was only his illusion: no love, no friendship, no relations. Just two guys who love coffee. Nonsense! Trifle!  John stops his thoughts as he understands that all Sherlock’s deeds demonstrated his feelings rather good without any words. It is the most important and precious in any person for John, isn’t it? Not words but deeds. But why did has he left? John has explained everything, hasn’t he? Why? And John doesn’t have any answer and feels his heart dying in the ocean of desperate.
John sniffed at the thought. That was ridiculous. A stranger (even though one with whose help he had had the most breathtaking orgasm he had in a long, long while and with whom he was apparently going to move in with) couldn’t possibly have such an effect on his life. He barely knew the bloody man! Just his name and that he was apparently a pain in the arse. How was that suppose to be the first thing to intrigue him in weeks?
“Ah, Sherlock!” Angelo said with an enormous beam as the man walked in, accompanied by John. “I’m so happy to see you! Here, sit down at the table next to the window, it has the nicest view in the restaurant. Should I bring a bottle of wine?”
They finally reached their flat. John never let go of Sherlock’s hand, guiding him without stopping past the kitchen.
“God, you’re so tight,” John whispered. He hadn’t had any sex in over three months, and he was torn between his body’s needs and going slowly for Sherlock’s sake, for the sake of making the memory of their first night together incredible.
“Why does everybody care about stupid things?” he asked himself out loud, voice muffled by a pillow.
New chapter, yay! I don't know why but I don't feel very happy with it. I really thought I would I have finished with this one sooner, but I couldn't resist and wrote a smutty Sherlock/Reader one shot instead. :P
Instead of saying boring, which would have been his first instinct, Sherlock said, “A dinner at Angelo’s?”
Observing Sherlock’s position always made him smile. The brunet had started on  his chair then had moved so he was lying on the sofa and now he was upside down on it. His face was remarkably still too white for all the blood that must have relocalized in his head and his hair was dangling toward the floor. His hands were his their regular position, pressed together under his chin. God, that must be so uncomfortable.
Carefully, they laid back together, John ending up on top of Sherlock. He slided down his body, hands caressing it on the way down. He felt the bump of Sherlock’s nipple under his palms, the silk of his stomach, the tickle of his hair below his navel, the strong muscles of his thighs. John slided his nose across Sherlock’s leg, following the curve of his knee, his calf, until he was at his feet. He looked up at his detective, finding those hypnotizing, incredible eyes staring down at him with wonder and incredulity, his breathing still slightly elaborated.
Sherlock answered, not wanting to be bombarded by idiotic texts all night when he was trying to think.
The man continued to hit that sweet spot, gasping as the thrusts became harder and faster, some sweat shining on his back. Sherlock passed his hand on it, and bit his other hand, struggling for control.
John got up, aiming to clap his friend on the back and bid him good night. He was very taken aback though when he felt stiff arms encircling his waist. Very. Awkwardly.
"Oh, you went out last night?" the fat man answered with a beam. "That’s really good, John! You need to relax. Get over the war and Mark, live a normal life. You’re home now. I know it hasn’t been easy for you, all the horror you saw there then him leaving you, but it’s a fresh start."
All of this might have be annoying for anyone else or at any other time, but it was the first action in John’s life for a while now. He’d miss it. To feel alive. To just feel something.
“I knocked,” the latter said with a straight face, trying to get back as much as he could at the mysterious man in front of him. After his analyses in the text conversation and of the day before at Barts, John was getting a bit annoyed by it.
He watched, his mouthwatering as Sherlock arched his neck, offering that white column of tempting skin as a gift to John's eyes, and wrapped a hand around his cock, pumping firmly, one, two, three times before his belly was covered in white, long strips and he shuddered, collapsing on top of John as his orgasm weared off, still shaking. John followed him over the edge, murmuring words of praise and swears and nonsense as his climax went on and on and on.
John chuckled. “I can’t contradict you. You can take the shower first, I’m just going to lie down here for a little bit longer.”
“Sherlock! What a pleasure to see you,” the man exclaimed when he arrived in the flat, John not far behind him.
“Yes,” John laughed softly. “Hiding things in the pantry isn’t very secretive for the person who gets the groceries. Don’t worry, mate, those movies are quite good, I like them too. Actually, tons of people do. You don’t have to be ashamed about it.”
Finally both men came out of their daze, looking at each other with eyes glassy from pleasure. The two of them hissing, Sherlock lifted his hips to let John’s softening prick out of him, removing the condom as he did, and dropped next to John, curling his body around his. The doctor wrapped one arm around Sherlock, the other playing softly with his hair. None of them said a word, getting their breathing under control together until sleep claimed them, still cuddled together in the peaceful darkness of the room.
There was also softer moments, tender moments, that John cherished more than anything. Watching the telly late at night, Sherlock’s head on his lap as the soldier combed his fingers softly through his dark locks, one of Sherlock’s hand mind absently stroking one of his thighs as he commented on the show they were watching. John waking up in the morning with Sherlock’s nose pressed against his nape and arms encircling him, snoring softly, still dressed and above the covers. Reading peacefully in each other’s company, looking at the other from time to time with a little smile, their gazes occasionally meeting before their eyes went back to the pages. Eating leftovers chinese for breakfast in bed as Sherlock talked endlessly, deducing and analyzing cases and John listening to him, offering his opinion when Sherlock asked. Sometimes he called John when the doctor had a break during work, asking him what he thought about a case he was currently working on. John only worked half time, keeping the rest of his days to accompany Sherlock on cases because he loved it and he wouldn’t miss it for the world.
that need of support. And what did John think about their situation and about his past? He could certainly lie to Sherlock about it. Was he disgusted by what they did? That would be comprehensible. Ashamed? Sherlock was none of the above, but he couldn’t know what was going on in normal people’s minds. It was something out of his reach, something he had a lot of difficulties understanding.
This was the first erection he had in eight years. He didn’t even thought he would ever have another one.
John woke up the next morning with two opposite sensations. One very pleasant, and the other, not quite. For the first time in weeks, he woke up with a smile on his face, reveling in the feeling on Sherlock’s nose pressed in his hair and his hot breaths against his nape. He took the time to remark everything, to be sure to miss nothing of this moment. He basked in the sensations of Sherlock’s legs intertwined with his. He felt the soft press of Sherlock’s knee against the clothed flesh of his inner thigh, the warmth where Sherlock’s naked chest met his back. The detective’s arm was wrapped against his waist, holding John close to him. The latter was slightly surprised to realize Sherlock was wearing nothing but pants, but he couldn’t have known what Sherlock’s sleep attire was. It wasn’t an unpleasant surprise. Actually, the only unpleasant thing was the fact that he was still wearing his day clothes and he felt something sticky in his own pants. With an unhappy grunt, John got up, trying not to disturb Sherlock’s sleep too much, and made his way to the bathroom, getting undressed and starting the water in the shower. He cleaned the mess and spent a few minutes relaxing under the spray, playing back in his head the events of the previous night and trying to convince himself he wasn’t dreaming. When he got out, wrapped in his robe, he made his way to make himself eggs and tea when he noticed Sherlock in the sitting room.
Once he had prepared himself mentally enough to come home, John installed himself on his bed after confronting his sister, a sigh of relief and exhaustion escaping his lips. He closed his eyes for a moment, letting his thoughts pass from one to another when an idea popped into his mind.
To his pleasure, Sherlock blushed slightly, but he didn’t quit his eyes, keeping his composure. “I have my mind palace, you know it. I remember all relevant information.”
“You remember the date? Of a case? What was so special that day?” he asked innocently. He knew he wasn’t supposed to bring the subject up, but frankly, he was so annoyed he wanted to feel smug a little.
But the brunet couldn’t help it, no matter what. He wanted to help John. It hurt that he couldn’t. It hurt in a way it had never before. It was new. Overwhelming. He wasn’t used to feelings. He didn’t like experimenting new ones. It was as if something gripped him and he couldn’t detach himself from it, like a persistent gluey octopus wrapped around him. And ironically, the only two men that made him feel unusual things in the last month happened to be the same person.
“Yes,” Sherlock answered, and guided them to the bed. John lied down on his back and Sherlock installed himself next to him with a slight distance between them. John smiled at him and put an arm around his shoulders, bringing him closer until Sherlock’s head rested on his chest.
“Uh, here, use mine,” John suggested before he even realized he was going to. At those words, the man stared at him for the first time. As he looked up from his pocket, the brunet’s gaze crossed his for a second, and God, what was the color of those eyes?
Sherlock seemed to regain his countenance, his breathing regularizing and eyes getting clearer. He turned around and stared stared at John, take in the sight of him and smiling a happy, tired smile back. He arched his neck to kiss his mouth sweetly, and felt an involuntary small jerk of John’s hips against his backside. His eyes darkened anew already.
“Yeah. He’s always like that,” Mike answered with a knowing look. “So you’re going to meet him tomorrow?”
Sherlock looked down again, trying to hide his slight shame. “Obviously not, I should have known he would not be efficient.”
Not just quizzical, though. A couple of times in the last two weeks, the brunet had noticed John looking at him in a way he couldn’t understand. It was a sort of mix of questioning and longing and amusement and regret and nostalgia? Sherlock had no idea what it meant or where it came from, so he didn’t mention it. He needed to work it out first. He didn’t understand- how could the man have such feelings while staring at him since the first day he moved in? It was illogical. Surely Sherlock was missing something, and it was right in front of him. He hated not knowing!
“John… John, I can feel you move inside me.” Sherlock sounded wrecked, overwhelmed, and John suddenly felt warm, sort of strangely protective. “I can feel the shape of your penis, the-”
John smile subtly, the curve of his mouth amused and somehow loving. Thankfully, his friend wasn’t looking at him.
He lavished the mark of the gun shot with his tongue, with his lips, then did the same to all the other ones he found. John’s breath was calm but shallow, his eyes closed as he concentrated on the feeling of Sherlock. It felt overwhelming to see the man reverenced to him in such a way, to feel him cherishing his body. He had always hated those scars, had thought they were making him look disgusting and weak. He had never believed he’d ever find someone making him feel like they were beautiful. Sherlock loved those marks. It made the detective sick to know that John had experienced pain upon getting them, but they were a part of who John was today, and Sherlock didn’t know what he’d be without him. Everything that made the man he loved, any part of John, no matter if it were his heels or his ribs or his scars or his forehead deserved his entire devotion.
“Here’s your wine,” Angelo announced, coming back to the table. He poured a bit in a glass for Sherlock to try, but the detective offered it to John.
Sorry for the wait, but yeah! all my christmas parties are over now and I still have 3 weeks off, so tons of updates are coming!
“No, now he seems to have completely shuted up when I’m around. He doesn’t fancy it when I project his intellectual lack to the world.”
John  Is making espresso compano when Clara, Harry’s nurse and girl-friend ,comes into the café. She is a nice girl, sincere and  careful. The best part of Clara is that she makes Harry to be happy and that’s the main reason why John doesn’t pay any attention to some familiarity, spontaneity and  assertive character. He is a patient person and tries to judge people for their deeds and ignore their faults. Clara notices John and waves her hand to him.  They are rather close and John thinks that she is one more sister for him. John comes out to give her a hello hug and have a word about Harry. They are hugging and this moment Sherlock comes into the café. John is taken in the centre of hurricane named Clara and he doesn’t see Sherlock and he has to be kissed before  leaving her strong arms. And After this damned kiss he sees Sherlock who stands still at the door having his hands in pockets and stooping. His look at John is  the same  as stormy London sky and his eyes are close to melting ice. It’s an evil look and John can easily cut of it. He has never seen such a glance before. And John  wants to return the warmth and care in Sherlock’s eyes but he completely  can’t understand about the reason for this reaction. Clara shakes John and he is out of his prostration and understands that it is jealousy. Sherlock is jealous and it means that…does it mean  that he loves him? John is afraid of saying this word but now everything is in its place. Sherlock loves him, Sherlock is jealous of his interest in Clara, It is painful  to him and John ought to explain..Just to explain…. John tries to leave Clara’s hug but this moment Sherlock turns around , opens the door and  runs out . Only the black  laps  of his coat moved the air. John runs after him, having successfully got free from Clara and cries:”Sherlock, stop! It is not what you think about! This is Clara! She is Harry’s nurse!. You’ve helped me, do you remember? They are together. She is  a lesbian. Stop, Sherlock! Stay for a moment. Don’t leave. I love you… Love you…”
“I felt your smell,” explains Sherlock and I decided that it was a hallucination as I was thinking about you all along. I even looked around to see  you  but nobody was,  there.  Damn, damn, damn it… Please, forgive me, John!” Sherlock looks upset and John is full of self-reproach.
He doesn’t say a word that Sherlock has become even more thinner than he was last time John saw him. But they don’t need  any words to understand each other. They are sit  and eating the croissants and have the coffee from one plastic glass  in turn. And after they just sit  and keep silence. When Sherlock’s phone vibrates in his pocket, he
Sherlock comes  into  as if nothing had happened and meets eyes with John before occupying his favourite table near the window and talking  out his smartphone.  Relief  covers John and he can sink in this feeling. He  smiles broadly and begins to make coffee without waiting the order.  When Molly comes, he adds  a pinch of vanilla to the black coffee with sugar. Molly smiles as she understands and shares John’s sympathy to Sherlock. Everything returns to the usual and only Victor gives him piercing and unkind glances and  spits out, "Bitch! Why’s he getting around….?"
John doesn’t take care if Victor doesn’t pick on Molly. By the way, Molly goes earlier today as she has a date. She tells about it and her face flashes for a moment. John looks miserable but wishes her to have a good time and looks around the near-empty café. They are going to close in an hour. Victor hides to the utility room. John is trying  not to think ,what Victor is doing there and turns over the pages reading the theme on osteology. When the door opens and let the cold wind into the café, John is busy learning  structure and texture of the temporal bone. He looks up at the late customer and misses his breath. There is Sherlock at the door, standing without any movement. He is staring with his hard look at John having his hand in the pockets. He looks bad. John notices that he has lost his weight and can be called skinny. He has dark blue shadows under his eyes, dry lips and  bitter  wrinkles near his lips. They look at each other for an eternity and then Sherlock makes the first and  irresolute step/ And John feels  a triumph spreading deep in his chest, and he can’t stop looking at Sherlock, trying to remember all his features and  doesn’t notice that Sherlock is staggering. Sherlock reaches John’s bar moving  staggering gait and sits on the stool. His hand are still in his pockets, he is shivering and his eyes are dark as agates. They can’t be black, cause John has seen them in day light, but now they look like two fathomless wells and they are magnetic. And John is dizzy and understands that he  lost himself in these wells long time ago. Sherlock is still looking at him and John is making the only thing he can do really well – he is making some coffee to him. Black,  two sugars. When coffee is ready, John moves the cup to Sherlock , Sherlock sighs convulsively  and looks at it. Then he Takes his hands out of the pockets and John notices that they are  shivering.
By the way, when it's written in italic it's Sherlock who is texting, and when it is written in bold, it's John.
Sherlock suddenly broke their embrace, pulling away and gasping. John was slightly disappointed, but the sight of Sherlock that desperate, slick with sweat with his locks damp on his forehead and his hard, red cock dripping made him forget it.
“Closer to your room, yes, I know. I thought we already had a talk about this stupid logic of yours.”
He put his phone back in his pocket and made his way upstairs, falling like a dead weight in his chair. He spent ten minutes sitting there and thinking before he realized he was hungry. He took his phone, meaning to text Mrs.Hudson to bring him biscuits before he remembered that she didn’t own a phone herself. Still, the harm was done: he had opened the screen and remarked the messages notifications.
There was a silence. John didn’t know what to answer, because even as a doctor, he couldn’t identify what trimethylaminuria could possibly be. After a while Sherlock looked up into John’s eyes for a second and said, “I need to think about this.
"In which way? Two people are meeting and considering moving their belongings into the same space, happens everyday."
Sherlock rolled his eyes again and got out of the flat in a dramatic swirl of coat, making John smile anew with a little shake of his head. He installed himself back at his post in front of the computer, continuing his blog post where he had left it. Just as he was about to type new words, he noticed the corner of the page flashing, alerting him he had a new comment on a post. An old one, actually, the first he wrote after meeting Sherlock. New fan, then. Well, at least he'll have a lot to read before he catches up and has to wait for updates. Curious, John clicked on the link to see what the person had written.
Sherlock just nodded, eyelids closing again, turning his head on the cushion. John pressed a soft kiss on his cheek. As gently as he could, the doctor pulled almost completely out before thrusting in again, augmenting the pace progressively. Changing the angles a few times, he finally hit the right spot, and Sherlock’s eyes opened wide as his whole body arched off the bed, as if he had been electrocuted
John should have known it. He only just had himself to blame, really. It had been as plain as day from the start.
But Sherlock froze. The name he had used. You cock… that reminded him of something. Someone had called him like that before, he knew. But who?
The bell made itself heard again, and Sherlock got up to answer, looking as lost as twenty seconds ago.
The look of confusion and of slight anger on the red haired man was quite amusing if you asked John.
“What is it?” Sherlock asked, nervous to have done something wrong. Was it bad to laugh during sex? He thought that it was generally something people liked, but maybe John wanted something more passionate?
It is the very first time for John  to made coffee with a great wish to impress. He takes the best cup (though they are really the same to tell the truth) and pours coffee trying to make foam to cover all the surface. It is the least that can be done for a hero who was able to show Victor Trevor his place. Victor is a cheeky asshole and John thinks he is connected with some drug  dealers  but unfortunately he has no evidence.  Victor kept silence till the evening. No sneers at John or Molly,  no rudeness for the clients and even his part of work after the café closing was done without any telling-off. Certainly, they can’t wait Victor to be such kind of an angel forever, but even peaceful yesterday without and quarrels and  gibes is a good reason for giving Sherlock all bonuses he wants. Molly brings the coffee to the table and stays for a moment, turning red and biting her lips. John can’t stop gazing at them. He is sure that Molly will not be able to say a word to Sherlock. Molly takes a step back when Sherlock surprisingly turns his curly head to her and make away. Sherlock follows her with his eyes and  looks at John. The tips of John’s ears are flushing and he is very glad to have another order but he feels that  Sherlock’s examining him carefully. From time to time, during little breaks among  the endless cups of  Irish  and ice coffee, John looks at Sherlock in an under head way . He is always in his smartphone, paying no attention for all these companies of students changing and replacing  each other. His coffee is cold but he doesn’t order another one. John thinks that his name “Sherlock” perfectly suits to his elongated face, soft  curly close to raven hair, his unreal slanting eyes and expressive lips. John admires him as if Sherlock is  a masterpiece in a museum or photo at an exhibition – a handsome aristocratic face that can be imagine in a black-and white colour gamma. John cannot  make out the colour of Sherlock’s eyes as it is too far. But he supposes they must be grey, cold and gloomy as  that  everlasting fog in London..  Due to the queue of orders John	 doesn’t catch the moment of Sherlock’s disappearing. After his leaving a company of goth-girls  occupies his table and Molly quickly takes his unfinished cup. It seems to John that Molly  fell in love. But to tell the truth he is also in love with this icy  inaccessibility. John is sure that everything will soon be over but the next day he looks carefully at  everybody visiting his café. Sherlock comes about seven. Wind follows him and flaps his coat and tousles his unruly locks.  John feels warmth in his chest and his lips are foolishly smiling. They meet their eyes for a moment but Sherlock doesn’t give the smile back. He just watches John for some moments, scanning him again, and turns back  going to his table. John must feel cheat about his smile but he doesn’t. He didn’t ever expect to have a smile in answer. You can’t really wait  any reaction from the Venus of Milo, can you?
“I hardly think that too thin, too tall, pale with prominent cheekbones is what society finds attractive.”
John blanched and blushed at the same time. Thankfully, his computer screen half hid it. Like that would fool Sherlock, but better than nothing.
“Send him away, I’m busy,” the detective answered, turning his back to his landlady so he faced his client again. “What were you saying?”
And with the awkward feeling he was leaving some unfinished business behind, John climbed the stairs.
Worried, he sent little text messages to the brunet there and then during his shift, hoping for an answer confirming the man was doing well. Which was not something he was used to do, since Sherlock normally texted him constantly.
That is why John was losing his time on the computer, looking for buying new jumpers, writing on his blog and watching a stupid video Mike send to him and things of the sort.
Relieved, even if he didn’t want to admit it, John sighed and walked to the closest street, waiting for a cab. The route they took after John gave the cabbie the address seemed familiar, but he couldn’t put his finger on where they were going. It’s only when the car stopped and that he got out that memories started flooding back, hitting him with such a force he just stood there and couldn’t move, taking in everything.
, John hadn’t had sex in over three months, and Sherlock was so hot and so tight and so soft and he needed to thrust, it was slightly overwhelming. But instead, he brought Sherlock’s leg around his waist, rubbing his thigh to offer him some comfort.
Sherlock heard the footsteps before he saw John walking downstairs. He had seen that his flatmate had read his text, but it took him a good five minutes before he actually came down. The detective looked at him, and they both froze for a second, staring in each other’s eyes before John started moving toward the kitchen. Sherlock shot his friend’s back a quizzical look for his bizarre behaviour.
He had never been woken up at night either by his flatmate jumping into his room by the window and then walking off like nothing happened. He still hadn’t get an explanation for that.
Wow, I'm impressed with out fast I wrote this one! I finished my mid-term exams last Friday and I guess I was a little bit too happy about getting my liberty back and wrote all week-end! :P
He pinched the bridge of his nose. Nothing could change now, he couldn’t go back, couldn’t take those secrets back. He screwed it all.
John closed his eyes with frustration. “I- I’m so sorry. I haven’t got any condoms, I- fuck. I’m sorry, I didn’t bring any with me when I moved in.”
I really loved this story and this John and Sherlock, thanks to everybody who left kudos and commented, your feedback means the world to me. :) xx
With a grunt, he got up and walked to the bathroom connected to his bedroom, getting in the shower to clean the evidence of his actions.
“What are you saying to your our new companion?” the same voice, sweeter now, asked as a petite woman grabbed John’s shoulders. She beamed at him, genuine and kind. “You must be John, Sherlock’s new flatmate! Pleased to meet you!”
The next day, just as he was standing in front of their meeting point at the agreed time, he checked his phone one last time.
“I felt no need to tell Lestrade nor Donovan since I knew that at some point I wouldn’t be able to resist the urge of kissing you or touching you- they would have known eventually. As for Mrs.Hudson, soon enough she’s going to hear us shagging. I don’t see the point of-”
Sherlock complied and opened his legs, not self-conscious at all about exposing his bare arse to John. The brunet pillowed his head on his arms. “Don’t make it too long, I want you to fuck me as soon as possible.”
The doctor kissed him back, his strong hands grabbing that firm behind of Sherlock’s. The man groaned in his mouth, the vibration going straight to his cock, and he felt Sherlock starting to rub against his thigh frantically, desperately.
“Yes,” the blond answered, a warmth filling him at the care Sherlock showed. He hadn’t been expecting that, and the genuineness of the question touched him, more than it probably should.
He finally got his flatmate under him, his eyes taking in all of John for the first time; his scar on the shoulder from when he had been shot, the beauty spot on the side of his hip, a birthmark on his thigh, another scar on his knee from when he had had an injury as a child and so many others he had surely got during the war, and suddenly Sherlock understood what people meant when they said that sometimes defaults make people even more perfect. Because those scars, those battle wounds, they just showed how strong John had been, how brave, risking his life to live to fight for his principles, to save innocents, to save Sherlock. Those scars were just like Sherlock’s own scars; they were alike, they got hurt, they healed, and now they had each other. The next wounds they’ll get, they’ll heal better, together. They wouldn’t matter anymore.
“John is my friend and flatmate and a doctor and will be of great help for this case,” Sherlock interrupted quickly. “Now, John, this is Gabriel Lestrade, Lestrade, this is John Watson, can we now get over this shallow human presentation protocol and get to work?”
Sherlock flushed a bit at those words, looking down at his lap. Yes, he had learnt things doing that experience.
As they made their way to the second floor, John spared Sherlock a look. He kind of wanted to talk about how that Sally had treated him, but at the same time he knew it was common and the detective didn’t seem affected by it for a second. But then, he was excellent at hiding his emotions. John decided against bringing the subject up. They have had their dose of awkwardness in the last 24 hours.
“Upstairs,” she answered before she noticed John following him. She stopped him with a frown and a pretty hard grip for how petite she was.
“Don’t hurt yourself, love,” he whispered. He intertwined their fingers. “Enjoy it. Concentrate on the pleasure, on this, on us.”
John stared at him and agreed, realizing that he needed to see Sherlock for that moment, too. He needed that bond between them to be complete, more real and more surreal at the same time.
"Why do you keep calling him freak?" John accused at the same moment Sherlock declared, "He is coming with me, his opinions are relevant to the case."
"Yes, it is. Sadly, I found myself unauthorized to speak in front of civilians," Mycroft announced, shooting a glance at the woman and John.
“Oh, about a year now. It's not bad. Charming area, Mrs.Hudson can be useful at times, and there’s enough place on the counters to do my experiments.”
“Yes. It was Mr.Lebowski. The millionaire”, he specified.  “Fairly easy, I resolved a case extremely similar not long ago, the night of the 18th of december. He’s an idiot for thinking he could pull the same trick.”
“And why couldn’t it be that something’s wrong with yours?” he asked, installing himself in his chair.
