Castiel plays the night over in his mind, still hating the way he feels about all of it. That itchiness won’t go away.
Since they’re in the louder part of the club now, Dean has to slightly shout over the music. “Home!”
“Well, fuck that. I do. You’ll get an appointment with a doctor. The best. The two of you can figure out what you need, I’m not trying to be a pill pusher. But you will be taken care of, Castiel. I assure you. Until then, I’ll do whatever I can to help you.” When Castiel opens his eyes, he sees that Dean looks genuinely concerned for him. “I can’t imagine what this whole situation is doing to you. My god, Castiel. I had no idea. I’m so sorry.”
With a nod to show he understands, Benny opens the door just enough to slip out of it before quietly closing it again. He doesn’t make a sound as he leaves.
It’s only a blurry outline, but between the chaotic curly hair and the nervous hand fidgets and the sound of his voice when he says, “Shhh, Dean, it’s going to be okay,” Dean knows exactly who it is.
Castiel pulls the blankets up to hide his own bare chest. He looks on the verge of tears. Dean doesn't fucking understand
“Stay.” He takes a deep breath before grabbing a towel off the bed and wrapping it around his waist. “I’m gonna go to the bathroom. Maybe shower. Or something. I don’t know. You clear your mind, alright?”
“My collar, sir.” Castiel licks his lips, missing sir’s cock against them. “It means I’m yours and - and I trust you to take care of me. You promised. Always.”
The fabric is back in, silencing him. “That stays in your fucking mouth unless I take it out or you need to safeword. Understood?”
“But-” Dean stops himself, seeming to be thinking his words through first. “What do you like about hurting yourself? Is it the pain itself or how the pain affects your anxiety and depression?”
, and unless 3 teenagers talking in an abandoned bathroom about overdosing on Viagra speaks to Dean on a deeper level somehow, Castiel doesn’t know what brought it on.
“What? Does my boy not like his punishment?” Dean asks in a taunting voice. “Does he want more pain?”
“No. Your dad was adopted by my parents - you knew that, right?” I nod. “So, obviously, no one had any clue he would have the gene. He was younger than me by a year. Michael was my best friend, and when John presented, Michael realized what was happening. He went to his alpha for advice because Michael’s parents were - well, that’s his story. But they weren’t there for him, so he turned to his alpha, and the alpha is who came over and explained everything. Michael and John were true mates, like you and Castiel, but John was too young for that in both the alpha’s and my parents opinion, so they didn’t get together right away.”
“Good boy,” Dean says again. It’s crazy how the simple two words make parts of Castiel’s body light up that he wasn’t aware even existed. He swears it feels as if he’s coming alive under the praise.
“Benny,” someone says in a cold, dangerous voice that makes me shudder. Benny’s eyes slowly leave my face, moving until they’re locked on the boy who spoke. I don’t have to look over to see who it is. I just…
for a moment. “I’d like to push one soft limit on you today, baby. Just one. Would you be willing to let me?”
I pass my tongue between my lips, trying to figure out what to say to him. It makes perfect sense why he feels like that. He’s near a pack. He’s near someone that is very much so willing to be his mate, if he accepts my offer. The omega in him is finally freed.
Knowing exactly what he’s asking for, I smirk against the skin beneath his jaw and say, “Patience, sweetheart.”
Right now, Dean's leaning on the railing of the second level and peering down at the dance floor below. He's not sure what kind of person he's in the mood for tonight. Girl. Boy. Somewhere in between. More than one.
“Michael was only allowed in his room at night if he stayed in wolf form. Kept everyone in the house
There’s a burgundy knitted blanket thrown lazily over the bottom corner of the bed. Castiel takes it, wrapping himself in the warm material as he heads out to the balcony. The view takes his breath away. He knew they were no longer in the city, but he had no idea it was like this. Off in the distance past the few large trees in the backyard are three beautiful mountains, white and gray against the soft blue of the morning sky. With autumn creeping in, the colors are starting to change. Especially closer to the mountains. It’s like a painting.
Feeling overwhelmingly grateful, Castiel's eyes begin to burn. Thankfully Dean makes his exit, leaving after sharing a final bit of information. "The phone by the bed is a secure line that only connects to other phones in the house. The number for my office is 1. The meeting room is 7. Call for
“Not at all. God, no. Omegas are cherished. Treated as precious. They’re loved. And male omegas are - to have a male omega is huge for a pack. Male omegas are revered.”
Castiel places the rope and wartenberg wheel on the mattress before getting down on one knee beside Dean. With firm but gentle hands, he begins to move him into the new position Castiel has settled on. The one he never had a slave take before. The one that will always be just
“Oh boy. A few places, to be honest. Drove until it felt right to stop. Spent a few nights in Las Vegas. Got so drunk off my ass, I don’t remember much. Actually, I’m a bit surprised I never called you. When I sobered up, first thing I did was check my call log for your name. After that-”
“Shhh,” Castiel hears behind him, a hand resting on the small of his back. That’s when he realizes he’s sobbing. “You’re okay. It’s okay, Cas. Shhh.”
Of course, 90% of what I love about the room is the bed. The giant bed that must be custom made, and built inside the damn room somehow because it’s far too large to have fit in the doorway, is full of incredibly soft blankets and fluffy pillows, all various shades of gray. They feel amazing against my oversensitive skin, and miraculously cool despite how hot I am. And they smell like Castiel.
The way Dean relaxes against him makes Castiel feel better about kicking his best friend out. He squats down and lifts Dean, wrapping his arms around him once he has wrapped his legs around Castiel’s waist. Dean tucks his face into Castiel’s throat and shudders.
“Wow. I-” the Lieutenant shakes his head, squinting at Jimmy like maybe he can see the answers somewhere on him. He looks uncomfortable, yet fascinated. It takes him a few seconds before he manages to get a hold of himself and remember he’s being impolite. Then he turns the conversation in a different direction. “So, you’re going home then?”
Figuring his men wouldn’t want to chime in on this particular issue, Dean heads inside in search of Charlie. Hopefully, the feisty red-head has some advice.
“Sure. Of course.” Castiel looks around for a few seconds befores swinging his arm and snapping his fingers. “Damn. Didn’t bring my backpack. Doesn’t fit on the wolf body, ya know?”
As if Ash can sense his trepidation, he grabs an album from the couch and hands it to Castiel with a proud smile. “My work.”
"I - but…" I close my eyes, replaying it all in my head. It's already too fuzzy. Faded. Just like a dream, slipping away by the minute until you can no longer recall the details.
To anyone who doesn’t know Castiel, that would sound like a threat. It’s not, though. Dean can see that as clear as day.
“Not at school. In the woods behind my house!” Bobby says, interrupting my dad. He takes a step towards him and I see for a moment who they probably were a long time ago. There’s still an air to them. A rhythm to their words and movements. They were best friends. Almost like brothers. They were just like me and Jack. “Dean went to take photos in the woods and one of your
“But I swear to god, Castiel - if you lose control and claim that boy, I will kick your ass out of this pack. Understood?”
“Is it, Dean?” Dr. Edlund asks softly. When Dean just shrugs, Dr. Edlund nods. “How often do you do that, Dean? Say things are okay when they aren’t?”
- says. “Maybe a business trip or a retreat or a guys weekend? He always came home exhausted? A little sad? Maybe extra cuddly, though? Needing to touch you a lot? Needing to remind you all the time how much he loves you?”
Castiel nods again, his eyes starting to slide closed. Dean better hurry this along before he loses him.
Gabriel wishes Castiel would stop questioning things, but his father assures him it's okay. He says Castiel will be a better master for it someday. It's better he doubts now, when he's young and can learn how wrong he is, than to doubt later.
"Whatever you're feeling is genuine. True mates has to do with biology and connection. Sure, its become this huge romantic thing among us wolves, but it really has nothing to do with love. There are plenty of wolves who are happy and in love with a mate that isn't their true mate, and I've heard of people who found their true mate and aren't in love with them. There's a pack that we're allies with way up north. The alpha has his true mate there, she's the pack's only omega, but he's in love with his best friend who is also his lead beta, and she loves one of the male betas. It's actually really cool to see. You can tell their connection, and they're like best friends, but it's platonic. The alpha is a sucker for his Beta, just head over heels for the guy. They just officially mated this summer actually. So, that feeling of calm and connection and safety you feel with Cas?
“Because you’re out of your goddamn mind when you’re in heat. It’s better in a way now, isn’t it?” I dip in another finger, loving the way it makes his body shudder and his breathing speed up. “It’s better for me. Not so worried about you. Not so focused on satiating your needs. I can just enjoy how delicious you taste. How amazing you smell. How sexy you are when your greedy hole swallows up my fingers.”
“We only have the piano, but if you give me a list of instruments, I’ll buy some for you. We can make you a studio if you’d like.
Dean rolls a nipple between his fingers, making the peak nice and long. “They’ll hurt at first, but this is my mildest set. It should feel like a hard pinch.”
“I dunno. Why are we leaving?” Castiel’s eyes dart off to the side, looking at the club. “You don’t want to do it here?”
Fingertips dance along the underside of Castiel’s cock, making him jerk in his bindings at first. He settles back down as Dean’s grip tightens, the boy gently, slowly stroking him. Castiel desperately moves his hips, trying to fuck into Dean’s fist the best he can. Dean makes it hard, though. He teases. Pulls away. Tickles when Castiel expects firm pressure. Squeezes when Castiel expects tickles.
“Neither of you need to walk me to class,” Dean says quietly, looking too tired and upset to bother raising his voice at us. There’s no anger in his thread. No…
Dean sucks on his cigarette before blowing the smoke at the man with a smile. "Interesting. I didn't ask if you knew anything."
Dean nods again, this time with much more enthusiasm. It’s clearly a promise. An assurance that yes, Dean can be a good boy, a very good boy.
The confession ignites something inside of Dean. Something he didn’t even know existed. It takes everything in his power not to say, “I love you.”
“My little brat,” Dean muses, running a hand through Castiel’s hair and gently tugging. “Do you want more rules so you can be a brat?”
“Perfectly fine, sir.” I pause, turning to face Bobby and give him my full attention. “He’s napping right now.”
"Go to your room, strip completely, grab your favorite toy - and don't pretend you don't have any because I know my little slut wouldn't be able to survive without things to shove up his needy hole - and lay back on your bed."
“You have every right to act however you want, Castiel. I’m so sorry I accepted this deal with your father. I was not aware that you were this against it. But that’s my fault, Castiel, not yours. We should have met before the deal was finalized. You should have been included.”
First and foremost, thank you all for your lovely comments! I can't reply to all of them right now, only the ones who asked questions or I felt warranted a response, but I read every single one and you have no idea how much they mean to me. <3
“You didn’t know better. You’ll know next time.” Sir runs his thumb along Castiel’s now spit-soaked bottom lip. It’s so gentle, but then, in a voice thick with angry humor, sir says, “Besides, I already gave you one unwarranted spanking today, haven’t I?”
Dean frowns as he watches Castiel stumble a little, nearly falling down. When he's stable, he accepts a drink from some guy Dean doesn't know. Castiel chugs it as the group around him cheers. The guy who gave him the drink looks at him like a piece of meat.
Just the thought of all of those choices is enough to make Dean clench around sir and moan again. Sir's chuckle is dark when it fills Dean's ear, making him shiver in both fear and lust.
With a quick nod, Castiel is nearly flying out of the room, leaving Dean behind without any further explanation. Dean sighs, walking to the bed and collapsing on the edge of it. He puts his elbows on his knees and buries his face in his hands. Dean may not be an expert on arranged marriages, but he knows that didn't go well.
“You helped,” Dean admits softly. “When you did what you did. It helped to hear you and feel you there, since you weren’t there when all that happened.”
Castiel perks up and smiles. "What's one thing you've always wanted to do, but never had the chance? Like if you found out you were gonna die tomorrow, what's that one thing you
Jimmy has no ideas what hobbies he would like. He tells Dean about the Save The Bees pillow in his apartment, and the picture of him hiking a mountain. They come to the conclusions together that he’s probably some variation of a nature freak. Dean suggests Jimmy might like gardening. Jimmy finds himself smiling because he likes that idea an awful lot. Dean says he can’t stand working out just to work out, but he’s always up for work outs that serve other purposes like hiking or kayaking. They agree that tomorrow - or today, once they get some rest - they’ll do one or the other together. Maybe even both.
Dean stands up, looks Castiel directly in the eye, and says, "You're right. I'm yours." Then he walks to the bathroom, closing the door behind himself.
Anna decides to stay home, leaving me with just Jack and Charlie at the game. I feel myself slide into my usual persona as I stand outside the gate with my friend group, which is a few members short considering they’re about to take the field. Jo says we should sit with them and I shrug and say sure. We probably would have anyway.
I shower twice, scrubbing myself until my skin is raw with the body wash I grabbed right before we got to the check-out at the store. Now I know for a fact I don’t smell bad. Head to toe, even my teenage boy ass, smells like warm vanilla sugar. I go to bed feeling very satisfied with myself.
"Come for me," sir orders, eyes locking with Castiel's in the mirror. Castiel gets a glimpse of his own reflection then. Hot, red, flushed. Sweaty. Tear-faced. Desperate and writhing. Cock flushed and leaking. "Come on, sweetheart. Come for me."
As he probably should have predicted, the second Castiel can sense him coming close he’s asking, “Did I do somethin’ wrong, sir?”
Dean steps forward, his hand reaching out, and Castiel’s ability to speak comes back to him. “Don’t touch me!”
"I'm sure Charlie would be fine with that. And buy anything you want today, Castiel. You deserve it."
The mom looks over her shoulder at Dean and smiles brightly. “If you’re not a dad yet, you should know you’ll be a good one.”
Jack meets me at the bottom of the stairs, the two of us hurrying into the foyer at the same time. Standing in front of my dad and Uncle Luke with a bright red face is Dean’s Uncle Bobby. The confirmation that he’s the one here is like kerosene to my guilt.
Add in that his lips feel puffy, his cheek is streaked with dry spit and cum, his ass is stuffed full of a plug that loves to tease his prostate, his throat feels raw, and his cock is so hard it’s nearly bringing tears to his eyes, and Castiel is having the worst-best day ever.
“Do I need to throw you over my shoulder and carry you? Because that would fall under misbehaving. Do you want to misbehave today, boy? Is that the choice you’re making?”
." Dean moves his hand away, but does it slowly, letting his fingertips skim across Castiel's soft skin. "All mine," he breathes.
Chuckling softly at the noises that quickly begin spilling out of Dean’s mouth, I keep my grip on his ass cheeks firm and start to eat him like a hungry wolf – pun totally intended. He doesn’t taste quite as good as he did in heat, but that’s something I’m thankful for. This is a different arousal, a more controlled arousal. His heat was such a frenzy that neither of us got to just enjoy ourselves much. This time around, I plan on enjoying myself.
Dean chuckles. “I let you sleep in as long as I could, sweetheart. But you have to eat breakfast and take your morning meds.”
Jack’s fingers dig into my knee, drawing me back to reality. He and Charlie send waves of calm towards me through our threads. When I have myself under control, guilt begins to eat away at me. I thought of Dean as mine again.
"Good boy," Castiel rasps, still slightly shaken by this turn in events. He hadn't expected pure submission like this yet. Not before they spent hours arguing over every single rule like they had back - Castiel shakes his head, stopping himself. He can't keep comparing now to back then. The past needs to stay in the past, because the present is beautiful and he’s not willing to waste a second of it.
I know it, but I might need some convincing. If I was truly amazing, my boyfriend would fuck me to help release all this pent up energy I have. Or maybe blow me. Let me blow him too. And then, coffee.
“It’s exciting to piss me off? To push my buttons?” When Castiel shivers, Dean laughs. He keeps his eyes closed so he doesn’t have to see the way the man is probably looking at him. It’s either bad and it’ll make Castiel feel stupid, or it’s good and it’ll make Castiel even hornier than he already is.
“Now, here’s another magazine. Load the gun and hit the target. You’ll look through this right here to aim. Line up the dot with where you want the bullet to go, keep your arms steady, and prepare yourself for the kick. Don’t let it toss you back.”
Castiel does as told, coming back out a moment later in the powder blue lace briefs. They’re pretty on him, but Dean wants to see his eyes.
He was almost disappointed when Dean said no to his offer of sex in the playroom, but when Dean explained himself, it just made Castiel fall for him even more. Dean took the pressure to please and satisfy off of Castiel, and with it came the realization that even though he's starting to think he wants to be with Dean for real, he's not ready for that step yet. The fact that Dean will respect that, given their situation and the amount of power it gives Dean, is amazing.
"The ocean." Castiel pauses to grab the blue throw blanket from the back of the couch, having to awkwardly shuffle Dean in his arms to get a grip on it.
“Please. It - it feels like-” like my body is nothing but vapor and chaotic bubbles. Like I’m empty and shivery and unsettled. “
Dean is suddenly struck by the memory of him finding the security footage on Castiel's computer when he had been in his office back at the compound. An onslaught of images flutter through his mind, all of the broken bodies and tear-soaked faces.
“S-sir?” Castiel whispers, clearly present enough in the moment to realize Dean said he’d be doing something that he’s not doing.
Castiel chuckles, the sound so dark and teasing it makes Dean moan. "Of course you haven't. He's an idiot. Has no idea how lucky he could be. It's alright, though. I doubt he could give you what you really need, right baby?"
“Second of all,” Castiel interrupts. “I’m not exactly sure having you here for that conversation with Dean would be the best idea, considering how he reacted to you yesterday when he was triggered.”
“Please,” he begs through the gag, doing his fucking best to rub his hole harder against Dean’s finger. “Please, fuck, sir. Please, sir.”
The silence that settles between them is so dense and suffocating, Castiel gets the urge to hop out of bed and make a break for it. Just as he’s weighing the pros and cons of that course of action, Dean shifts closer and whispers, “Your turn.”
“What are you looking at, boy?” Dean growls. He closes his thumb and forefinger around the pink nub of Castiel’s nipple and twists. The pain makes Castiel arch his back and hiss. “Did I say you could look at me?”
Dean turns on his heel, leaving the stunned Chuck behind. He walks out of the building and nods at his driver, who gets out of the vehicle in order to open the door for Dean. With a quiet thanks, Dean slides into the backseat and settles back against the leather.
“The night of the pet play scene, after Gabe left you on the machine, we fought. I punched him.” Castiel laughs dryly. “I punched him a few times, actually. I kind of lost it.”
The wolf makes a noise that I could swear sounds amused. It lifts then to stand on its four legs, making my hand fall from its head. When it lifts its chin to look me in the eye, I realize the wolf is tall enough to press its nose against my chest.
"Dean?" Castiel calls in a thick voice. He waits a moment to see if Dean will answer before climbing out of bed and tugging some shorts on. "Dean?"
Dean’s fingers relax until he’s just gently stroking Castiel’s skin, his eyes bright and warm as he peers down at Castiel. He sighs deeply, the sound full of content, and says, “I love you, Castiel Soon-To-Be-Winchester.”
It’s at that moment that he realizes there’s a tiny slip of paper tied to the cap of the lube. He nearly laughs when he reads it. He swears, Dean knows him far too well.
"I know." Dean gives him a smile so fake Castiel knows he didn't put any effort into hiding it. "It's fine. We can hangout tomorrow."
The man does his other arm before grabbing him in the armpits and pulling Dean to his feet like he weighs nothing. “Up you go.”
Once the skin that was covered by the soaked boxers is dabbed mostly dry, Dean picks Castiel up again, carrying him out of the bedroom. If Castiel notices, he doesn’t show it. Dean knows he must be pretty out of it when they walk through the playroom door without Castiel even flinching.
“Can you please remind me of my current rules, sir?” Dean asks quietly, hoping he’s not going to get in trouble for forgetting so soon into a scene.
. Now is not the time for my obsession with Castiel to affect my thoughts. I can't be seeing impossible things.
Lust pushes away the cramps in my stomach, pooling warm and tingly in my groin. I have to swallow a moan, my cheeks and neck feeling hot in shame.
Dean’s smile feels sticky and venomous as he watches the party go on without him. He's trying to be in the moment. Trying to participate. He did a keg stand earlier. Took a shot off a girl's breasts. Winked at her. Flirted. Got her number. Politely turned down a blow job. Feeling buzzed after that, he had danced a bit in the living room. Grinded on a cute boy who looked nothing like the boy he wanted him to be. Smoked a joint with him. Got his number. Politely turned down a blow job.
Charlie jumps on Castiel’s possible thawing toward the wedding planning idea. “All you have to do is pick out the maybes from the hell no’s. Anything you like, you put a sticky note on.”
"Well, I'll see ya soon then. Talk to ya later Benny." I give Benny a hand clasp and pat his shoulder. Then I somehow force my body to move away from the omega. Each step feels wrong, but it gets easier as I go. By the time I'm out of the cafeteria, I can breathe again.
"That wasn't the same, baby. That was your mind escaping out of fear and necessity. This is your mind escaping for pleasure and release. It's called subspace and I promise you I won't let anything happen to you while you're there." Castiel kisses Dean’s temple before whispering in his ear, "Let go, pet. Let it all go. Put everything on me for a while. Let yourself forget."
“Ooooooh.” Cole sits up straight and grins. “Is this the boy I heard all about from the club last night? I’m crushed that I was in a private room. I didn’t get to see him!”
For the first time since I got the call from the hospital with the news about dad, I feel like speaking. “Am I moving in with you?”
I sit with Benny and his friends at lunch, partly because I really do need space, and partly to test if Castiel will respect my request. So far, he hasn't bothered me. We're halfway through the lunch period, and though I can feel his eyes boring into me from across the cafeteria, Castiel stays where he belongs. It might be killing him, but it's nice for me. I like seeing him listen. I like seeing him respect me. When he had come up to me and Benny this morning, all of my trust in him had dissolved. Our thread went blank and I was grateful.
Dean grins, looking incredibly pleased. “Good. Then we are going to go back to our table, and you will obey me. I’ll tell you all expectations. I’ll order your food and drinks. I’ll steer the conversation. I will not allow you to be set up for failure. I will take care of you. Understood?”
Panic invades Castiel’s expression as he shakes his head. “No. We’re integrated here, Dean. Stay. No one will bother you.”
Castiel opens his mouth, about to say that’s ridiculous, but then he remembers the room from Dean’s tour. The sex room. “You only have sex in your playroom, don’t you?”
“Oh.” Castiel frowns as she takes his hand and tugs him in the opposite direction of the fridge. He does a small pouty lip, mourning the loss of his potential meal. “Does the place where we’re going happen to have food by any chance?”
“Hard limit for me,” Dean says, giving Castiel a look that he hopes conveys how serious he is about that.
A whole shelf on the wall has … fuzzy things. Feathery, soft things that Dean doesn’t trust. He fucking hates being tickled, and he has a bad feeling that’s what those are for.
“Maybe?” Castiel steps away from Benny and slowly approaches one of the suits like it might bite him. It’s a darker blue. He wonders if it would bring out his eyes. If maybe Dean would like that. He wants to be extra beautiful for Dean that day. Pretty. Castiel hates to admit it, but he likes when Dean calls him pretty an awful lot.
“Thought this was supposed to be what ya do the night of the wedding,” Castiel teases, eyes falling closed as Dean carries them from the playroom to their bedroom.
A low chuckle lets him know that Castiel is fully aware of this dilemma, feeling Dean’s erection as it grows. Dean joins him with a soft laugh of his own as he grinds his heavy cock against Castiel’s thigh. The growl that escapes Castiel is sexy enough to give Dean a head rush, and he’s dizzy with lust when Castiel flips him over and roughly pulls his arms above his head.
"Well, I'll make it easier for you." Dean grabs his phone and keys from the bedside table, keeping his face like stone so Castiel can't see how crushed he is. "This is over. You go find yourself a nice little angel to settle down with. Be happy. Make your parents proud. I'll be just fine."
"Wanna watch some Netflix?" Castiel asks as he hands Dean his beer from its spot on the other side of him.
Dean catches Benny smirking, but ignores it. He nods at Ellen and mumbles something about showering, then heads to his wing. Dean doesn't make it twenty feet before Benny is beside him. "What was that?"
The moment I arrive, I see Dean standing at his locker, looking tired and sad as Benny rubs a hand along his back. My wolf growls and I mentally agree with him. This needs to be fixed. Immediately.
Grabbing the knots at Castiel’s hips, sir begins to brutally fuck into him, no longer wasting time on teasing touches or dirty talk. The sound of their skin slapping together is loud in the small room, and the squelch of lube as sir plows into him only makes the noises more obscene. Castiel feels his face go hot as he wonders if Benny can hear him getting fucked. As he wonders if other people can hear it too.
Dean can’t help but flick his gaze at Sam. His brother is clearly flummoxed. When he catches Dean looking at him, he quickly averts his gaze to focus on his coffee mug instead. If Dean wasn’t so stunned himself, he’d find it amusing.
It’s only then, when his muscles are relaxed and his breaths are coming in slow and steady, that Dean starts to tighten his grip. At first, all Castiel can feel is the press of fingers against his skin, just as he would if Dean was holding onto his wrists or hips. It’s just a moment, though. Then other things begin to happen.
Nodding to show his understanding, Castiel takes a deep breath, holding it when his lungs are full. Dean hurries to secure the remainder of the rope, making sure the knot is tight. Secure. “Go ahead and exhale.”
“I’m serious.” Castiel snaps his head up, glaring at Gabriel. “I feel fucking - fucking itchy. I feel like I woke up in someone else’s body. Like a fucking hypocrite. Like everything I’ve ever known got flipped on its head.”
One minute, Dean’s laughing along with Castiel at a joke Castiel’s brother Gabriel is telling. The next, he’s hearing someone screaming for help. He’s an idiot. He doesn’t think to look around and make sure others can hear it. He doesn’t think at all. Dean hears the panicked voice and he breaks out into a sprint.
“Yes, sir.” Castiel breathes out a sigh of relief that he feels like he’s been holding for a lifetime. He can’t stop the small hum of pleasure that escapes him. He leans in the direction he thinks Dean is in and whispers, “Thank you, sir.”
"Son," my uncle says softly, looking worried. "That didn't happen. I worked late last night. You were already asleep when I came home. I didn't go to the store. That's why you're eating my cereal this morning. And there was never a talk about wolves. I was never shown a picture."
All of this is weighing on Dean’s mind when he’s still in the shop at 3 in the morning, working on a 1991 Chevy Silverado in the dim lighting. He sings along with The Outfield’s
Dean's willing to try anything at this point. Not even to get in Castiel's pants, though that would be a fantastic bonus. He just wants to make the boy happy.
Castiel was a master all his life. He’s a dominant down to his bones. In every cell. It’s a part of him that Dean both fears and loves. A part of him Dean would never dream of asking him to lock away.
The idea is thrilling. It sends sparks straight down his spine and through his cock and he cries out, hips bucking frantically as his orgasm lingers just out of reach.
He just throws his head back and laughs. His amusement becomes muted when he raises his head to see who is standing on the porch waiting for us. I look over, wincing when I see them too. It’s bad either way. The two men could be preparing to confront me as my father and uncle, or as the alpha and lead beta of the pack. With what happened today, I’m not looking forward to either scenario.
“No? You’re not hard?” Castiel walks straight to the king-sized bed and dumps him on his back. Dean barely has the time to stop bouncing before Castiel is crawling over him, dragging a thigh against his cock that is very clearly hard. “Feel pretty hard to me, baby.”
him. This isn't just a blow job. His reward isn't just sucking sir's cock. His reward is getting sir's cock in his ass. Here. In a
“I swear to god, that fucker is lucky killing him would start a fucking blood war, or I would-” Dean stops. Castiel doesn't need to hear about all of the things Dean would like to do to his father. Closing his eyes, Dean sucks in a breath to steady himself. “Sorry. I know he’s your father. I just-”
After a second, Castiel bursts out laughing. The sound is loud and unusual, and the best thing Dean's heard in ages. When he calms, he looks at Dean with watery blue eyes and nods. "The therapists never have to know."
This boy is, of course, the person Dean has made his new best friend. The two are practically inseparable. Castiel has been spending more time with Dean
Just as Dean gets to the bathroom door, Castiel gains his bearings, breaking free of whatever spell Dean had put him under.
Dean wakes up with the worst headache in the fucking world, wincing at the bright lights around him. He tries looking around as stars dance in his eyes. Blinking hard a few times helps. Shapes begin to form. Moving shapes. People. People are around him.
"Stay close to me," he reminds Castiel for the third time already. "And remember, no food or drinks from anyone but me or Benny."
Sitting back with a sigh, Gabriel thinks it over. “Are we going to address the elephant in the room?” he asks after a moment.
The two sexual encounters they’ve had so far have been of a bdsm nature. The sexual encounters - the many, many, many hot, sexy, mind-blowing sexual encounters - Dean plans on them having in the future will be the same way.
I feel embarrassed tears pricking my eyes, but I blink them back and force myself to breathe through it. Then I look up at Charlie who is sitting across from me. She’s watching me carefully, and doesn’t bother trying to hide it.
Dean sighs. "I'm bored now." Then he clamps the pliers on the joint of Tamiel's left forefinger, twists, and pulls. He finally gets the guy to scream. The sound is followed by a wrecked sob. Dean flicks his gaze to his watch, pressing the same button as before for the timer. 2 minutes 17 seconds.
“Alright. I’ll leave you be. But you’ll be expected in the foyer at 5 sharp. No clothes, bedroom decor, or toiletries. Just personal items.” Castiel continues his silence, and Chuck finally leaves. Just before closing the bedroom door, however, Chuck whispers, “I’m sorry for this, son.”
A small sound comes from Dean, but Castiel ignores it. He has to. He just keeps staring at that one spot on the rug and forces himself to tell the doctor, to tell the man he loves, his biggest fear. His absolute worst nightmare, out of all of them.
Dean's heart starts to race and he quickly looks away from Castiel. He doesn't want to move too fast and scare the boy off. All of these emotions need to be kept in check, even if what Dean is feeling is genuine.
“I’m a virgin!” I blurt out, not caring that there are others standing around - including my fucking uncle.
After our third run between our territory and the Demon territory, Jack, Gabe, and I finally go home and shift back to human. We yank on sweats and shirts as we hurry into the house. Not that there’s much of a hurry to get inside. We can hear exactly what’s going on in the house anyway. Even if we weren’t wolves, we’d be able to easily hear the yelling.
When Castiel accidentally gags again, sir slows down but he doesn't pull away. His hand relaxes in Castiel's hair, fingers carding through his curls in a soothing gesture. "Breathe through your nose, baby. Relax your muscles. That's it. Just relax. Just let sir use you. No need to overthink. No need to worry. Let everything go. Sir knows what you need, isn't that right, angel?"
“Please,” Dean begs, trying desperately to reach backward for Castiel despite his bound wrists. All he manages to do is some finger wiggling. It’s pathetic.
“Good thing I made sure a little cooler of juice and some snacks were put in our room tonight, hey?”
Dean approaches the room like you would a newborn baby. He caresses the curved black and white granite island in the center as his eyes roam over everything else. It’s all state of the art. There are two stoves plus a pizza oven. The fridge and freezer are massive. There’s a wine fridge as well, rows of wine meant to be warm in the shelves beneath it. It’s something Dean raises an eyebrow at, but he decides not to bring it up. Not yet.
"Dean, I hurt you so much!" Castiel blurts, all of his fear and pain and grief and guilt suddenly slamming into him. "How could I ever deserve you when I did what I did to you? I destroyed you. I ruined your fucking life!"
"Yes. Mr. Winchester won't be letting you change much, I'm afraid. He is extremely strict when it comes to security, especially for you."
The teasing goes on for another minute before the topic is changed to a math test a few of the guys are dreading. When I meet Benny’s eye, he looks nervous and unsure. I give him a smile. His mood seems to brighten after that.
Once he gently places Castiel in the center of his bed, Dean removes his shoes and turns his body so he's lying the correct way on the mattress. He rolls him onto his side and stuffs a pillow behind his back so he won't choke if he throws up, then pulls his comforter up to tuck him in.
"Yes and no." Castiel’s eyes flick down to the black ink against Dean’s fingertips. “They’re both broken but together their pieces fit. It doesn’t matter the hell they’ve been through. It’s… unlonely, I guess? I don’t think that’s a word but that’s how it made me feel. Hope that one day I wouldn’t be alone. Maybe I’ll never be forgiven, but we could still move forward.”
“No!” I scramble away from him, surprised when he lets me go. I take the opportunity and lunge for the door. My hand trembles as I work the lock, but I manage to get the damn door open before he grabs me - or, considering he’s a werewolf, maybe he isn’t planning on grabbing me. Either way, I’m fucking out of here. This isn’t happening. It’s fucking
"Cas," Dean rasps as he tugs his dress shirt off and uses it to wipe his hands and lap partly clean. "Cas, can you open the door for me?"
“No.” I hook a thumb over my shoulder without taking my eyes off of Dean. “His locker is back there.”
Castiel settles behind Dean and begins to wind the rope around his wrists, staring from the and working his way up and around him.
Dean's heart fucking swoops. He loves this version of Castiel. Open. Free. Happy. There's a beautiful personality beneath all the fear and anxiety. Dean loves Castiel no matter what kind of day he's having, don't get him wrong, but there's such a lightness in the air right now as they lay chest to chest. A lightness he never thought he'd achieve in his life. It just wasn't in the cards for him.
“It’s not bad for you. It’s not bad for an angel.” Dean pushes by Castiel and begins to turn the dial on his locker. “We don’t all have that privilege.”
The smile on Dean’s face slips. “You can leave with your security. No job, not right now. Same goes for school. You could take online classes if you wanted, though.”
“No. Talking.” Dean hits him twice, once on each cheek as he says the words. Then he chuckles, the sound low and dark and fucking threatening.
“Don’t be sad,” Castiel begs, pushing my lunch away so he can get closer to me. His hand carefully wraps around the back of my neck at the same time that he leans forward, pressing our foreheads against each other, the tip of his nose brushing mine. “Please don’t be sad.”
He orders himself a double bourbon neat and then sighs. “Okay - what was the last thing I told you guys about him?”
“I need you to keep your eyes on him, Ben. Like… keep them on him. No matter what. At least until he’s in the personal wing. And then I want you to be the one to guard the door. Okay?”
"Okay. Yeah. Sure." Castiel swallows hard before forcing himself to turn a little and look at Dean. At least Dean looks back at him. That's a start. It's enough to give Castiel the confidence to say, "We've spent a lot of time talking about my father. About my childhood. My upbringing. The things I saw. The things I was taught. We talk a lot about the man I became… and the man I want to become now."
Dean grabs the cane with his free hand and begins to tap it along the inside of the boy’s more exposed thigh. “Be honest.”
I can’t explain any of that to him, though. I’ve never been so frustrated with the pack secret in my fucking life.
“Perfect. There’s beating on here? Is that like… beating me up? Or does it mean spanking and paddles and stuff? Because I’m cool with spanking and paddles and whatever else ya wanna use, but I don’t want you to like punch or kick me or whatever.”
After opening his mouth to speak but closing it when no words come, Dean quietly gives Castiel the pills. He offers him a granola bar, and Castiel takes a few small bites. From the look on Dean's face, you'd think he had won the lottery or something. It's enough to make Castiel smile. It's small and weak, but it's there.
“I-” he stops. Then he chuckles, shaking his head. “Damn. This thread thing can really bite ya in the ass…”
Castiel loops the belt around Dean’s throat and pulls back slowly, not wanting to hurt his neck. When he hears those soft little sputters come out of Dean, he puts both ends of the belt in one hand and reaches over for a condom with the other. He skillfully tears the packet open with his teeth, takes out the condom, and rolls it on himself.
Then the hose is on, full pressure, and the boy is shrieking as what must be ice cold water bites into the skin that was just being burned a moment before.
My two options flash before me as I try to decide if I should close the distance and take the only open seat, which happens to be right next to Castiel, or run out of there with some stammered excuse.
When Benny and Sam just glare at him, and Charlie and Ash stare awkwardly at the floor, Dean growls, "It was his fucking idea. We have come to an agreement. And it's not any of your fucking business. Now, Benny. Go get Ethan. Bring him up to me. Sam, go home. End of discussion."
The days after my dad’s death are a blur of sympathy and black clothing. My Uncle Bobby is taking care of everything, giving me the freedom to space out most of the time. He puts food in my hands every so often. I’m brought to the school where I empty out my locker without asking why. At some point, I eat a cupcake. The frosting is pink. I’m not sure where it came from. It tasted like nothing. It tasted empty.
“So, turn that mind of yours off. You know exactly what’s going to happen up until I have you kneel, and then I’ll be explaining everything all over again. There’s nothing for you to predict. To worry about. To overanalyze.”
“Hey now, staff doesn’t come in here, remember? Don’t be shutting down my future fight inspirations.”
Castiel doesn't know how he feels about that. On the one hand, he's insanely jealous, both of Charlie, as well as of anyone who knows how
Castiel scrambles to comply, yelping when Dean swats his ass as he passes him. He can hear Dean chuckling in that dark, sexy way of his all the way down the hall.
Dean puts the tip of his finger on Castiel’s right shoulder and begins dragging it as he slowly walks around him. “Now, you understand that the use of safewords means I will not listen if you tell me to stop or slow down or anything of the like, yes?”
Dean raises a hand before quickly dropping it. His eyes flicker to Castiel before back down at the collar.
He wants to beg but he can’t with the lace in his mouth. All he can do is tremble and whine, trying his best to move against Dean’s hand when his ropes have him all tangled and tightly bound. He sobs into his gag, tears pooling beneath his blindfold and slipping down his cheeks.
Keeping the panties on him, Castiel starts to belt Dean. It’s incredibly satisfying to watch the skin pink up beneath the pretty lace. It isn’t until Dean is sobbing that Castiel gives him a break.
“Well, I guess I never considered it enough to know if I had wanted it. If you’re asking if I ever doubted it, ever dreamt of being like an astronaut or something like that, the answer is no. I knew what I’d be, and I didn’t have an issue with it.”
If his enthusiasm amuses Dean, the man doesn’t show it. He just smiles at him fondly and begins guiding him through the club. It’s extremely hard to look anywhere other than the floor but Castiel really wants to see what’s going on. He takes a chance, lifting his chin and looking off to his left at a couple in a stall that are doing… something. One of them is naked and strapped to a big cross - a lot like the one Dean has in his playroom, though his is made of triangles kissing instead of two long planks of wood crossing over each other. The other is half-dressed and holding a whip. When the naked one gets hit for the first time, Castiel jumps and looks away. His eyes meet a man’s from across the room. A man who is very openly staring at him.
He puts Castiel’s ear protection on again and hits the button to put the target back in place. Then he nods to show Castiel he can begin.
Castiel snorts, thinking that might be underselling it as he takes the array of food in. “Where did you even find all of this? There’s no way these foods were in my kitchen.”
"Hmmm." Dean starts dragging the tip of what looks like a very sharp blade along the curve of the man's cheek. The man whimpers, but he holds perfectly still. "And what was your job,
“Plugs are gone. No problem.” Castiel slides his hand in Dean’s and squeezes once to reassure him that he’s there, guilt crawling up his throat until he feels ready to choke. “Next?”
Rolling her eyes at him, Charlie says, “Fine, Mr. Dramatic. I’m breaking you out. Whatever. Let’s go.”
“Unfortunately. I have a few meetings in town.” Dean shifts on his feet and sticks his hands in his pockets. “I’m glad I found you, though. I was hoping to ask you to dinner tonight.”
"You better wash up before the food is ready, boy," Ellen says, whipping Dean with a hand towel when she sees him standing all sweaty beside the fridge.
“In my defense,” Castiel says, putting a finger up. “I didn’t ask for Benny’s help. He sat down and declared he was participating. Same happened when Kevin and Garth strolled in.”
As Castiel slowly approaches him, Dean's body doesn't so much as twitch in acknowledgement. His breathing remains the same, keeping his muscles relaxed and in place.
When Castiel fades the song out, he sneaks a peek up at Dean. The man is looking at him like he hung the moon. For the first time, it doesn’t make Castiel blush or uncomfortable. Instead, he lifts up and presses his lips to Dean’s soft smile. It’s a tentative kiss, one that Dean allows him to completely control, but it’s perfect.
Dean pushes Castiel's bound leg back to expose part of his ass and his thigh. He smacks him five times, right over slashes from the cane earlier, all hard enough to make his hand sting. Then he calmly reminds Castiel that swearing is against the rules.
"You will wait-" Castiel pauses, running the tip of the rope along Dean's full bottom lip. "I'll remove your headphones and tell you. Don't worry."
“Hey, you can sit here,” I offer, kicking the side of Charlie’s shoe in what I hope is a subtle movement.
Dean hangs his head, his body coming to a full stop as sir's cock presses perfectly against his prostate.
"Hmmm." Dean gathers bubbles in his hands and starts spreading them along Castiel's bare stomach. "I'd like some more time, if that's okay. What we have - and what we want to have - is something I never even considered before. It was never something I wanted until you. I'd like to do some research. Talk to Charlie, and maybe some of my other friends from the community. Then you and I can talk and get things sorted out."
Not wanting to ruin Castiel's childish excitement, Dean doesn't tell him he knew that, considering he had to give permission. Instead, he smiles and says, "Perfect. What are you thinking of doing?"
“Castiel,” Dean says in the low voice that always works on a submissive. He shivers, sinking into his chair and eyes locking onto Dean’s as if he’s waiting for a command. “You won’t ever lose me, understood?”
“You’re thinking loud enough for me to hear you all the way over here,” he yells over his shoulder, wanting Castiel to understand why the plans have changed. Dean sees the last item on the right and smirks. It’ll be perfect. “Let’s see if this helps you relax.”
“No. It’s not like that.” Ash hits her on the arm, his tone like a toddler on the verge of a tantrum. “Ugh, Charlie. Dean said not to stress him out!”
Gritting his teeth, Dean lifts his head and leans the rest of the way forward. His breath catches at the increased pressure on his prostate but he swallows the gasp. The moment his hand is on the glass of scotch, he's quickly sitting up straight and handing it to sir's waiting hand. A sigh of relief slips through his lips as he settles back in sir's lap.
Dean nods. Just like the memories of the compound, Gabriel is another thing he'd rather not think about right now.
"Look, we all make sacrifices in this line of work! He should feel lucky it's not something worse. He could be raped. Or kidnapped and held hostage. Tortured. He could be killed. Or married off to some piece of shit." Laughing, Sam just shakes his head and starts to walk away. "Where are you going?" Dean calls.
Castiel slumps, his eyes fluttering shut. “That’s why I let him bring that other guy over. I know I’m not enough for him. I – I know he’ll be disappointed.”
I’m pretty sure I could spend the rest of my life just watching this man work a grill and I’d die a very happy man.
I wait until I’m near the bottom of the bleachers before glancing back. Alastair is leaning against the counter, giving the girl the same smile he had just been giving me. The tight worry in my gut unravels as I see evidence that he’s just an overly friendly man. By the time I’m back to my seat, Castiel grinning at me for buying him hot chocolate, I’ve already forgotten all about him.
The next area he walks towards is the wall with toys hanging from it. At least, what he assumes would be considered toys. He’s not quite sure. Some of them look like they’d be… painful.
Dean would prefer neither. In fact, he'd like to repeat it. Maybe add a few things during round two. But he knows that's not on the table.
“Good boy.” Dean walks to the submissive and stops in front of him, his half-mast erection pushing through his pants and trying to reach across the small space between him and Castiel’s mouth. It’d be so easy to pull himself out. To fist his cock and shove it between Castiel’s parted pink lips. One day, he will. He’ll fuck his face right here.
The man hands him his drink before raising his hand to gently pat Dean’s shoulder. “I like those numbers,” he says softly as he takes a seat in a chair across from Dean. “Woah. Somebody works out,” he adds as he leans forward with his elbows on his thighs, smiling as his eyes roam Dean’s body.
There’s a long pause that terrifies Dean. Finally, Castiel looks him in the eyes and asks in a shaky voice, “Will you teach me? I - I’m not good at normal. I don’t know how but I - I’d like to try with you, Dean. I’d like to be normal with you. Our version, at least.”
They kiss until Jimmy’s lips feel tingly and puffy. They kiss until Jimmy thinks he’ll never survive without Dean’s kisses again. They kiss until Jimmy is a pretty damn good kisser.
“Okay.” Castiel runs the tip of his finger along the rim of his wine glass as he thinks. Whatever it is he’s considering seems serious. His hesitancy is thick in the air, even when he finally looks up at Dean and asks, “Did you want this job?”
Not only is Dean trapped in subspace - probably for the first time in his life - but he’s trapped in it while panicking that Castiel is going to leave him like last time. What’s worse is that Castiel can’t even blame Dean for worrying about that. Castiel helped clean up a bit after their last time, told Dean they’d never be doing that again, and then went to sleep.
“If you had been a good boy for me, your punishment would already be over,” Dean taunts. At the same time, a finger slides into Castiel’s hole and curls inside him in a way Castiel didn’t even know could happen inside such a tight space. His body gives out against the mattress as his cock jumps and jumps and jumps. He swears he’s going to come, but he doesn’t. He needs more. Just a little bit more.
When Dean turns to face the table, he looks startled to find Castiel sitting with the others. The shock quickly turns to joy. He flashes Castiel a toothy grin that stops Castiel’s heart and says, “Good morning.”
Castiel nods frantically, moving faster, not caring that it hurts like hell when his hip bones keep slamming against the harsh edge of the sink. He can’t decide what feels better - sir’s hand on his cock, or sir’s cock nailing his prostate every time Castiel slams himself back on it.
“Good. Strip him, spray him down, lower the temp, and hang him up by his wrists. I’ll deal with him later.”
Once he’s squeaky clean, Castiel walks into the playroom with a towel wrapped around his waist and approaches the bed. The box is even more intimidating than before, but there’s an underlying excitement to it now. Adrenaline. He’s so close to 3 PM. And then Dean’s going to fuck him.
,” I whisper, digging my nails into the bare skin of his back and pressing as close as possible. “Don’t let me go.”
“Yes. Yes, he is.” The male cashier licks his lips, openly appreciating Dean’s boy. “You have a very good boy there, Mr. Winchester.”
A tear falls down Castiel's cheek. "I can't stop it. I'm - I'm trying. I know in my head it's not true. What my parents taught me. What society says. It's not true. I
It catches Dean completely off guard. “Don’t be sorry, Cas. I just mean I need you to keep trying. Take your time.”
-- I'm a little behind on replying to comments right now but I'm working my way through them. Thank you to everyone who leaves them <3 They help me so much, you have no idea :)
Dean moans lowly at my dirty words, another gush of slick coating my fingers. “When do you fuck me?” he asks breathlessly.
Trying to catch his breath, Dean gently maneuvers them so they’re both lying on their sides, Castiel’s tiny bum nestled in his crotch as they wait out the tie. The bunny is more relaxed than Dean’s ever seen him. He’s flushed and sleepy. Sated. He can barely keep his eyes open. When Dean starts brushing his fingertips up and down the bun’s body, appreciating the softness of the peach fuzz that covers him, the sweet little bun releases a happy sigh and whispers, “I love you, alpha.”
When Dean asks that last question, Castiel gets his first glimpse of the monster that lives inside Dean. It flashes in his eyes. But it's not there for Castiel, it's there for whoever could have hurt him, and Castiel doesn't know how to take that.
He shivers as calloused fingers skim along his bare ass cheeks. As a thumb presses against his dry hole. As a sudden brush of lips falls on the center of his back. “Beautiful.”
"Feel good, little angel?" sir asks in his ear. Castiel nods weakly against him, sniffling. Sir hums. "See? I told you, all you have to do is answer my questions, and you get to feel good. Not so hard, right?"
"Cas," he slurs when I push in a second finger. Tears are falling down his pretty flushed cheeks as more pool in his eyes. "Please."
Dean pulls away to look him in the eye. "Cas, I'll give you a goodbye if I ever decide to leave. After everything the two of us have been through, I think we deserve a proper goodbye if this doesn't work out."
I still want to talk to Jack, though. I want to hear it from him myself. Before he gets the chance to meet the boy. Before he gets the chance to change his mind.
The quiet is almost painful. Castiel swallows around a mass in his throat and blinks away tears. "That was beautiful."
Turning the best I can with Castiel still clinging to me, I look at my uncle with tear-filled eyes and beg, “Please help me. I - don’t let them do this to me. I don’t want this.
“Feel good, sweetheart?” I tease, running a fingertip down his crack to gather some slick before taking a little nip out of the fleshy underside of his ass cheek.
Not trusting my voice, I just nod. He leaves and I get dressed. Bobby and I reach the stairs almost at the same time. He wraps an arm around me and says, "Let's go home kiddo."
If he isn't mistaken, Dean sees Castiel shift ever so slightly in the water. He has to fight the instinct to reach beneath the bubbles and check if Castiel is hard.
“Thank you, sir,” Castiel whispers, not even sure what he’s thanking him for or why he’s thanking him or what his life means anymore.
He wraps Dean's hand around Dean's cock, covering it with his own hand as he gently guides the boy through slow, steady strokes.
The plug speeds up until Castiel is gurgling against the cloth in his mouth. God, he needs to come. He needs to come so bad.
, oh god, right there!” he begs, losing his train of thought as I fuck my fingers in and out of him in just the right way. “What were we talkin’ ‘bout?” he asks after a minute.
"A place?" Castiel asks after a very long, tense pause. His tone is impossible to place, his expression blank.
Dean’s smile turns into a grin. “Very much so. What would be the point otherwise, Cas? Like I said, I enjoy what we do because you enjoy it too. It has to go both ways. I
“You’re keeping something from me,” sir repeats slowly, as if the problem was that he didn’t hear the words clearly. When he speaks again, each word is punctuated with a hit. “What. Is. It?”
Not when sir pumps a hot load into his hole, pushing any cum that trickles down his crack when he pulls out back inside Castiel's loose hole with his thumb. Not when sir plugs him and uses the same thumb as before to catch any extra cum around his rim. Not when he wraps his arm around Castiel and slips that thumb in his mouth, ordering him to suck it nice and clean.
“Well I’d fuckin’ hope so.” There’s some rustling around and then a grunt before he speaks again. “What’s up?”
“I didn’t mean a date. I meant with friends. Did you have any friends? Someone to look out for you?”
Castiel sets a death glare on Dean. The death of his sex life at least. He already knows what his boyfriend is going to say, but he still winces when Castiel growls, "No sex! No. Sex. For. You!"
"You're lucky I've decided to keep you. I don't want to ruin this pretty little body of yours. My usual victims get acid."
“Yes.” Jimmy gives him a nervous smile as he tentatively slides into the opposite side of the booth. He fiddles with the silverware that’s wrapped in a cheap napkin, his hands shaking. Dean wants to reach out and hold them - steady them - but he’s not sure if Jimmy would want that, so he fights the urge.
Castiel is yanked from his thoughts when sir grabs his right nipple and twists. The man doesn't stop until Castiel’s back is bowed, a shriek ripping from his lungs. He barely even registers when something is clipped onto the sore bud before sir is twisting the other one. Castiel sobs dryly, shaking his head. Sir has never been that rough before on his nipples. He swears they're going to tear off.
It takes me a moment to recall the memory. He was at his locker. The fresh scent of soap clung to him, fighting against his sweet omega smell. I could tell by the hue of his skin that he had rubbed it raw.
“Okay.” Castiel drags his fingertips along Dean’s spine, smiling when he shivers. “How long until I see you again?”
Dean is everything those people probably told Castiel Dean would be. Dean murders. Tortures. Sells drugs and illegal weapons. He’s killed with his bare hands. He’s had dinner with a man, including dessert, just to blow his head off after.
I nod, looking down at my sandwich. Uncle Bobby won’t like it, especially if he finds out Castiel will be there, but I really want to go.
“Oh, no no no. Go slow, young grasshopper. You have to learn to appreciate the simplicity of the Oreo first. Then, you can earn the Oreo themed desserts.”
The riding crop comes back, sharp and insistent, hitting in quick stings against the most sensitive places.
"The jacket," Dean muses, grabbing at the back of Castiel’s jacket and pinching it ever so slightly. "Should it be brought in?"
When Castiel realizes Gabriel is staring at him in expectation, he clears his throat and nods vigorously. “Yes. Ridiculous.”
Gabriel's father always knew what was best. So, of course, Gabriel listened. He was relieved his best friend was still going to be a good master. The worry became more of a pinprick at the back of his mind. Easy to ignore. Until… well, until number 14.
"Okay, sweetheart. Just give me a minute. One minute. Shhh." I keep my fingers buried inside of him as I lean over and fumble around the floor with my free hand. I pick up the first thing I manage to get a grip on. It's the smaller of the two fantasy werewolf dildos that Jack bought from the kinky sex shop when he drove into the city earlier.
“Woah, hey, calm down.” Dean cups the side of his face, giving him a soft smile. “There’s nothing to fix. I wanted to see you, and I really liked seeing you, but this isn’t where I live.”
“Oh. Um. I don’t know.” Castiel looks back at the mountains. They make him far less nervous. “What are my options?”
“Shut up.” I sit back on the swing, savoring the way my thread between me and my dad is thrumming with comfort and joy. He sits back as well, pressing against me as he pushes off with the toe of his shoe to make the swing move. “I think I’m in love with him, dad. Not just the true mates thing, but Dean too, ya know? The person he is. He’s kind of amazing.”
“Then tell him that. Tell him why you’ve been having a hard time, explain that it wasn’t the demon thing but mom and dad’s opinions of the demon thing, and the way you’ve been dreading the end of things. Tell him that you’re willing to give up everything for him.”
The room fills with a loaded silence that Castiel hates. Why can’t this doctor just tell him how to fucking fix this? Why can’t he give Castiel a fucking answer for once? All he does is ask questions, going silent when he thinks Castiel should speak. What the fuck does he want Castiel to say?
“Of course.” Dean shifts a little, and Castiel swears he moves closer to him. “I don’t just go out to a bar and pick someone up. Well, I’ve done that once or twice, but then I go to their place instead. Usually I look for someone else in the community. That way I can be upfront about my expectations, and they can be about theirs, and everything is about the sex. No complications. When the sex and aftercare are over, on the bed or equipment in the playroom only, then my driver brings them home.”
"Yesterday!" I sit up straight, feeling angry and confused. It happened. I know it did. The wolf was real. "We got into a fight about me going into the woods and the wolf I saw, and then I showed you the picture."
When they're back in the bedroom, Castiel is led past everything and into the bathroom. Dean turns the lights on with a dial, making them a comfortable level of brightness. Castiel's oversensitized eyes are grateful.
Dean takes his cock out of his jeans and fists it with one hand. He reaches out with his free hand and grabs Castiel’s hair, yanking the boy up onto his knees and slightly forward. Castiel moans, his lips parting immediately.
“Not home,” he whispers against my skin. He sniffles, gripping me tighter, his fingers pressing into my back as he clings to me in clear desperation. “Uncle hates you.”
Dean holds Castiel longer than he should in a public fucking bathroom during a very high-profile event. He doesn’t stop until Benny knocks three times on the door, calling through the wood to ask if everything is alright. Dean sighs and guides his boy towards the door. He already has Castiel and himself cleaned up, Castiel’s pants back in place, Dean’s jacket on his upper body so the large size can help cover the fact that he’s not wearing a shirt beneath.
“I trust you,” I admit a little breathlessly, looking him in the eyes. “To keep me safe, I trust you. But - but you hurt me. Keeping this from me. You really hurt me, Castiel.”
“I’d leave you here for a while to stew. Get some other things done. It’s not like you’re a priority. At the end of it all, I plan on murdering you. Why would I be in a hurry?” Something cold runs down the curve of Castiel’s neck. He yelps, which earns him a very dark, very dangerous laugh from the man he loves. “I’d probably go fuck my fiance first. Hold him close. Tuck him in. Kiss his forehead. He’d get my heart. You’d get my fucked up mind and my cock.”
“I know.” Dean takes a sip of his beer, letting the bubbly liquid sit on his tongue for a second or two. Once he swallows, he adds, “I’ll eat until I’m full.”
Dean starts to grin but it never makes it past a soft, loving smile. He's glad he came. It's the best decision he's ever made.
Castiel stares down at his hands for a moment, considering. Then he takes a deep breath and nods. “Yeah. Yeah, I’m gonna do that.”
Then, just before their lips meet, the man yells obnoxiously, “All clear!” right in his face. Dean stumbles back, shock swallowing him up as the fluorescent lights flip on and the music goes silent. The man takes his cup from him and leaves him just standing there with his belt undone and his cock obviously hard in his jeans.
“He was beautiful. Maybe - maybe 4 years old? I dunno. I’m not good at kid ages… but he had Dean’s eyes and freckles, and my hair, which I know isn’t even biologically possible, but - but he looked like us, and he was beautiful. He was happy. We were all playing outside. Dean was chasing him, pretending to be a monster, and he was giggling and running towards me.” Castiel closes his eyes. He swears he can feel the breeze. Feel the sun. Feel the laughter in his chest. “He called me daddy. Wanted me to save him from the monster.”
The words continue in my mind, but the ones he's speaking out loud to me are louder. More desperate. "Please be okay. Please, Dean. Please be okay."
Dean cradles his cigarette between two fingers and grabs the crude riding crop he had used on the boy earlier. He smacks it against Castiel’s left nipple, making sure it’s not hard enough to free the clothespin on him. Castiel tosses his head back, his body making a beautiful arch as he yells out. Dean hits the other nipple, just the same, making sure the pin stays on.
“Meeting someone,” Dean mumbles, eyes scanning the place. He sees that crazy mop of hair in the far corner and smiles. He can’t make up this shit. The second Dean sets eyes on that man, his world softens.
“Oh.” His hands grab at my hips, holding me close. Each breath he takes is erratic. There are too many emotions between us. They’re overwhelming our thread, making it impossible for me to figure out what he’s feeling or thinking. “Castiel?”
I decide to ditch school for the day, getting in my truck and heading straight home. My mom and dad are on the porch swing when I park the truck. I start to strip right there in the driveway, the need to shift burning hot beneath my skin.
“Okay. So, I went into the woods and - wait, where are we going?” I stop and look around myself, realizing he’s brought us towards the back of the school. It’s the opposite direction of the cafeteria.
"Big. Fucking. Mistake." Before Castiel can respond, sir is grabbing him by the hair and dragging him across the dungeon. They pass the dead body. Castiel shudders.
Dean couldn’t remember a time when he’d been allowed to just sit there and breathe, without knowing there was a world of responsibilities waiting for him to pick back up or chase him down, a waiting punishment for taking even a minute for himself.
They sat on the rug, at the coffee table, again, in just their boxer and assorted love bites, drinking coffee and watching the fire as they ate.
Dean's not sure he cares, though.  He can still hear the tape in the player clicking along, the sound of the tires on the pavement, the wind in the trees.  He keeps driving.
Dean had dreamed about the fishing cabin since he was a little boy. The real cabin on earth had belonged to a hunter friend of his father, the name of the guy long since gone from Dean’s memory, but it was the place where he always saw himself sitting on the end of a dock, fishing, when he needed a safe space in his own head.
“Who says I have a piece to say, Bobby?” Dean picked at the label on his bottle, suddenly intensely focused on getting the paper off without leaving any behind on the glass.
“Dean,” Cas started, which had Dean raising his hand, the one with the umbrella no less, to cut him off, when the phone hanging on the wall began to ring. It had been a very long time since Dean had heard an actual telephone hanging on an actual wall ring, so it took him a minute to realize that was what was happening.
