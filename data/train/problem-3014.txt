“A lot,” Dean said, unable to help a grin, even if Castiel couldn’t see him. “As much as you think I deserve, Sir.”
When a single tear gleaned in the yellowy, dim light, Castiel couldn’t help but reach out. He was cautious, wrapping his arms around Dean carefully, giving Dean space to refuse. He pulled Dean into his chest where he sat on the arm of the chair before him. Dean let him, though, and for a brief moment, he buried his face in Castiel’s shirt.
Finally, Dean dared to look over to the other wall, to the darker side of the room. He knew what he’d find there, but even so, he was unprepared.
“You already know Charlie. You’ve been living in each other's pockets since school started. And you've met Harry, and Ed, and Dorothy,” Sam said, entirely too reasonably.
Castiel grinned innocently around the rim of his coffee cup. Dean went ahead and marked “Yes” for them both…then underlined it on Castiel’s side, just for good measure.
He gripped his travel mug hard, protecting his precious coffee against the jostling of the sidewalk, running late for his train. Castiel wasn’t a late person, but he’d been tempted to call in sick and wallow in misery, and he’d only managed to snap out of it at the last minute.
“For a dude who said he just did clean up and band-aids, you sound like you know what you’re doing,” Dean said, opening his eyes again in relief. He rolled his head to the side, staying down, and Castiel slipped his hands from Dean’s shoulders.
“Well you didn’t exactly correct him, did you?” Dean snapped, grabbing his boots from beside the bed where they lay, haphazard evidence of their hasty removal the night before.
For a moment everything seemed silent, the white-fronted parrots and the red-eyed frogs in the trees going quiet as the whole Yucatan jungle seemed to pause, leaning in to listen.
The small movements felt like a lot of effort, and he ended up laying on the bar on his stomach, glass in hand, half-listening as Castiel went off on some long-winded rant about bees on Ganymede. His voice was nice to listen to, a soothing, low rumble even with a bit of a slur to it. Dean let his eyes fall closed, enjoying it.
Sam and Eileen staring at the top of his head. Eventually, two whole bites of delicious crispy, pillowy chicken later, Dean raised his gaze.
Every morning—or sometimes after lunch, or in the middle of the night... Time is a bit sketchy—Dean wakes up and rolls out of bed, puts on a clean t-shirt, clean jeans, and then slips his stained shirt over the top.
Fuck, it meant slowly, in this instance. With a relieved puff of breath, Dean loosened his aching thigh muscles, lowering his pace a few notches and easing himself down onto the dildo between his legs
What do you think - should Dean have gone into the gym, and told Castiel his long-withheld truth, before its too late? Or was he right the first time, and this is really the wrong time for them?
He owned a farm. One that he was going to turn into an environmentally friendly eco-inn, luxurious but simple. He’d host conferences. He’d write a blog. Who cared about San Francisco, or commitment-phobe boyfriends, or yoga mats? His inn would be
“What?!” Dean sat up a little in surprise, ignoring the loud complaint in his head. “What did you do? Let me guess—someone ruffled your feathers and you punched them in the face. Ooh, or was it drugs? Too much pot in your pimpmobile?”
“What did you do?” Dean asked curiously, tracing his finger along the long-dried ink. “Clearly, this is because of you and your excellent management.”
Castiel raised a brow at his words, though—not at the sentiment, he wholly agreed with that, but at the self-assured way the sub spoke. Castiel had no need for his play partners to be submissive outside of play, in fact he often preferred it if they weren’t, but he was curious as to what kind of sub this man would be. The sub missed Castiel’s reaction, looking down at the table and running through the waiver quickly, sliding the pen down the paper smoothly beside the print, as if he was checking that nothing had changed.
Dean flipped over slowly, still looking a bit dazed and groggy, and let out a yelp as his red skin hit the sheet. Still, he grit his teeth, and hissed out weakly, “Of course, Sir.”
Dean flinches back, pulling his shoulder blade to the wall rather than have Sam touch—have him touch the—
After letting out a small sigh, Dean’s shoulders slumped a little. “I can lipread pretty well in a one-on-one scenario with someone who’s being careful to speak properly, like you,” he explained. “When I tried college the first time, it...it was a struggle.”
“I’m glad that you liked it,” Castiel said quietly into the comfortable near-silence, the intimate hush of the room broken only by the last-ditch efforts of the sunny storm pattering on the window glass. He rolled onto his back, and Dean noticed that his cock was tucked away again, the slit where it had emerged not even visible amongst the scales. Turning his head back toward Dean, Castiel added, “I’m glad that even though we’re different, we can still have this.”
Coming up behind Claire with a white towel over her shoulder, Kaia gave Castiel a little wink. “It’s one of the languages of love.”
“I feel like I’m standing in a carnival funhouse,” Dean hissed through the dim light. “I don’t like it.”
“But we’ve barely begun! You don’t have to leave, Cas, surely.” Dean pushed up out of his chair immediately. He hadn’t meant to embarrass Castiel, of course not, certainly not when
Apologies that I'm posting this chapter about twelve hours later than I usually would. I worked a sixteen-hour day yesterday, came home, and then pretty much passed out face down. Whoops! I haven't managed to clear last week's comments for the same reason. This week is one of the two worst weeks in the whole year for my day job, and it is absolutely kicking my butt.
“I’m sorry about Eileen,” Dean says, rubbing his thumb nail over the corrugated edge of the pizza box. “I never said that. Never told you.”
“Hey,” Dean said simply, clearing his rough throat and giving Castiel a small smile before he swished the cloth in the water, rinsing it, and returned to his task.
Dean spread a hand dramatically over his heart and fanned his face with the other before responding. “Careful Cas, we’re in public. Don’t get a guy excited.”
Forgoing a glass, Dean took a deep swig of the smooth, brown liquor straight from the bottle, gritting his teeth against the slight burn from his too-large gulp.
“Gave her an oil change to calm your nerves?” Bobby asked, crossing his arms in front of his eternal puffy vest.
“Yes,” Castiel said, already unfolding his tall, built frame from the car. “I’d like some more coffee. I’m a little tired this morning.”
Wincing at the ache in his shoulders after a long day’s riding, Dean settled himself into the chair before the desk in his room. The French country lord’s manor that his regiment had commandeered was small and quaint but certainly felt luxurious after days on the road. Alfie had just departed for the evening, leaving Dean in his breeches and undershirt to relax with a drink and tend to his correspondence.
“Mr. Shurley,” Dean greeted, lowering his head—the name felt odd on his tongue, far too formal. “The pleasure is all mine, I assure you.”
Earl shrugged. “Don’t care what you do to them, either. Just don’t kill ‘em. They heal fast, for the most part.”
Once their thirst was sated, Dean moved to sit behind his desk. “I suppose I can’t put it off any longer,” he jested. “The numerical torture must begin.”
Castiel reclined back on the mattress, his broad shoulders highlighted by the way his arms stretched out either side of him. Propped up on the pile of pillows, his gaze rested unerringly on Dean as he stood in his boxer briefs, taking him in. The color of Castiel’s tail looked more blue than usual; the way the sun was struggling to break through the rain clouds was sending intermittent shafts of light through the window that made his scales shine, holographic and dazzling.
Sam’s back cracked as he straightened up, and he rolled his shoulders awkwardly as he nodded to Dean. “Alright, that’s it. Go ahead.”
“This is Doctor Berry. She is going to go through your paperwork with you quickly, then assess your vision and balance. As you’ve already been experiencing obvious concussion symptoms, she would like to send you for a CT scan to make sure there’s no internal bleeding or swelling.”
“What do you do for them, then?” Dean wasn’t about to admit all of his baggage to this unknown dude just yet, but...it’d be nice to know if there were options.
“Dean—” Castiel’s hand darted out, as sharp and gentle as ever, and his taloned fingers curled oh-so-precisely around Dean’s wrist. “Did you mean it?”
After the successful spell, Castiel can take human form for the first time in years. Once they return to the cabin, he requests to share something with Dean that he's never been able to do before, an experience at least somewhat untainted by his time imprisoned at the Ranch. Dean happily acquiesces, and when they're done, they snuggle up in the bed together and talk. Dean tells Castiel that, as strange as it may sound, he misses his talons. Castiel is surprised, and Dean reiterates that he loves Cas in every form, and he doesn't expect or want him to always look human now just because he can. Dean also gently brings up the idea of cutting back on hunting, staying closer to the sea, closer to Cas - after all, he can't just go riding around the country and leave part of his soul behind, can he? Although tentative, Castiel is very happy indeed that Dean would consider that.
With another one of his signature eyerolls, Castiel placed the papers down on the tablecloth between them, in the corner. “If they had been divorce papers,” he replied dryly, “I probably wouldn’t have wasted money on such a nice dinner.”
Next to him, Jo thumped her thigh into his, and when he looked over, her eyes were resting pointedly on Cole.
Thank you to the usual awesome people: SOBS, jscribbles, captainhaterade. You know not how many fixed rushed commas you owe those poor folks!
“Prude!” Gabriel called after Dean as he rushed out to the back room, hurrying to get changed before Castiel was due to arrive.
Castiel stood, turning to Dean and passing him the heavy silver band, clumps of dirt sticking to the metal. Dean turned it over just once in his hand, smiling to himself, before he reached down and picked up Castiel’s water bottle from where it sat near the bucket he’d been filling with dirt. Staying hydrated in the jungle was important.
Before she could answer, Dean turned and pushed his way through the door, still swinging his backpack up as he moved.
Dean couldn’t help but laugh. “I definitely couldn’t care less about that one. Your flasher coat has grown on me over the months, and I like your hair exactly like this”—He reached up, dragging his fingers through Castiel’s thick, voluminous strands,—“all just-got-fucked and sexy. I’m sure I’d have liked it like that on a date, too.”
Chuckling, Dean nodded in agreement. “He’s great for reaching abandoned cans at the top of the pantry, too.”
Pausing for a second to lean his hip against the ragged rock wall and catch his breath, Dean took in the length of the short beach. It was seaweed-filled, the sand dark, the rocks a deep gray, but the sea itself looked beautifully blue, sand visible beneath the crests for a long way out. It was wild and pretty looking, not like a Caribbean sea or something from a travel website, but in a way that felt real and ancient and breathtaking.
Castiel nodded, then pulled back a fraction, fixing Dean with his thousand-league, oceanic eyes. “Yes. Happy tears—thanks to you. Thank you, Dean. For everything.”
Castiel squinted. “I don’t understand that reference, but if the inference is that I don’t quite fit in here, I’m afraid that you might be right.”
“Great,” said Dean, far more confident than he felt. He gestured up the street, saying, “This way, then. It’s less than a ten-minute walk, we can leave our cars here.”
Coming up in the next chapter: Our boys deal with their horrific hangovers, Dean goes to spend some (admittedly one sided) time with Sam, Castiel has a really bad time, and...Dean comes up with a plan!
Dean’s chest released, the tension traveling to his shoulders instead. Great. The “sorry” part. He should have just backed away when he had the chance. “It’s fine.”
Shoving his phone moodily in his pocket, Dean turned around to find Bobby still standing behind the couch, his arms folded across his chest and his baseball cap in one hand, grinning.
So, Dean took matters into his own hands. Placing the beer bottle on the table next to his own, Dean shoved the pizza aside and swung his leg over without preamble, straddling Castiel’s lap. Reaching down, he scooped Castiel’s jaw into both of his hands and, before Castiel could even look surprised, leaned in to kiss him soundly.
“We’re only part of the way through the evening, I’ve still got plenty of time to make it awkward,” Castiel replied, looking solemn—though Dean could see a tiny lift at the corner of his mouth.
“I’ll make a list,” Sam said, his towel bobbing as he headed off to enjoy his gross, green breakfast.
That’s how Castiel and Dean ended up spending the final few miles of their drive to Dean’s house blaring
A slight delay in the posting of this chapter, my apologies for that. I was on the windy end of a hurricane when this was supposed to go up, and unfortunately real life priorities took over! So I decided to keep to the Sunday schedule and give it to you this week instead.
“Condom?” Dean asked, spelling out the letters with a tilt to his head. Yeah, there was probably a sign for that, but now really wasn’t the time.
Castiel parted his legs, tugging Dean down closer so that he could get his hands on the planes of Dean’s back, stroking his fingers across the muscles that had taunted him so often. “Watching you work outside, shirtless…I swear you did it just to torture me,” he breathed out next to Dean’s ear.
Well, “favorite”… He’d only brought one with him. And it had managed to fly through the air and end up stuck proudly above the left windshield wiper by its little suction cup. Rubbery, bouncy, and veined, it waved quietly in the breeze, a pink flag of surrender wielded by Castiel’s last shred of self-respect.
Castiel’s eyebrows gave a tiny raise, but he nodded. “That’s true. God had Michael cast him into Hell for that.”
“Nah, you’re fine,” Dean said, rearranging himself on the couch. “I think we’re past suits and formality by now.”
“Sam!” Dean called out, low but relieved, as he saw his brother sat in the middle of the casino floor, amidst eerily flashing slot machines that had never been so silent.
Castiel’s smile back was blinding and gummy. “Indeed. We have all the time we want. I’m not going anywhere.”
I asked my Patreons to vote on my next long fic, so thanks to them the next WIP you see from me will be "42,000 Feet and Dropping," an AU where mechanic Dean meets erotic novelist Castiel on an airplane. A kinky weekend ensues...but of course, it doesn't end there.
Castiel smiled as he stepped away from the bed just long enough to find Dean’s jeans on the floor and find them for him.
until I met you,” Castiel replied sulkily. Dean couldn’t see his face, but picturing his annoyed squint was already pretty easy.
,” he grumbled, smiling quietly as he told Dean to hush. When he looked back to Dean, Castiel shot him one of his big, happy smiles, and Dean melted down into his seat a little, like an embarrassingly boner-shaped ice pop left to bask in Castiel’s heat.
Dean hated this whole place already. He detested the incense and the beaded curtains, the musky smell, the multiple pairs of brown man-sandals they passed as they walked across a sunny courtyard, drifting left to move around a pink, blossoming tree planted in the middle.
Sam made a mumble of agreement, and Dean dawdled back to his bedroom to grab his khaki jacket and deposit the book on his nightstand.
“Ahh, come on,” the merman consoled, giving Sam a grin that showed every one of his alarmingly pointy teeth. “It’s close enough, kiddo. You’re just lucky you got me and not one of the other dickbags.”
, come to think of it), because the silence in the Impala was so heavy Dean was surprised it didn’t flatten her tires.
The door popped open. It was too heavy to swing far, but the latch had been popped out of place and the way was clear, despite the actual mechanism still being locked.
Castiel’s nemesis, the wood-burner, was sequestered in a red brick alcove in the middle of the back wall of the kitchen. In it’s hay day, it was probably a very pretty focal point for the room—Castiel could just picture it surrounded by hanging copper pans and bunches of drying herbs from the gardens outside. Now it was a giant hunk of rust that smelled like something had died inside.
and Dean’s body was hurtling him towards the finish line of a race he’d barely had time to realize he was in.
In another life, where he wasn’t trying his hardest to stay on track and be someone who he could be proud of, he’d have walked across the bay to where Cole was jacking up a rusted Chrysler Crossfire and punched him out cold.
Castiel nodded, slipping his arms out of his shirt and beginning to push Dean’s from his shoulders. “That’s smart, honestly. It’s probably best to stick to doing that with someone you trust, at least the first time.”
Maybe if he just went to sleep right here, he’d wake up and all of this would be fixed. The Saranton’s oxygen issues would have disappeared, he could boot Xenon back up, and the A.I. would plot a course for home while Dean slipped back into his statis egg. Perfect. Or maybe if he did some research, there would be a simple way to sort out this whole ship-virus situation—
Thicker at the base and tapering to a tip, Castiel’s dick was a little pinker than the rest of his skin, sinuously slipping out of the opening where it had been concealed and snaking through the air like a quivering, eager, octopus arm.
Castiel’s low chuckle came out close enough to Dean that he could feel it vibrating in his chest. “Flatterer,” he said, before reaching down to open Baby’s door. He stepped back, pulling the door wide and holding it for Dean. “On the other hand, it will be wonderful to get to show you off.”
Even with the rain still coming down around them—though less torrentially, thank goodness—Dean stopped to spare a smile for the pretty, two-story frontage. Castiel took Baby’s reins from Dean’s hand and moved around to the side of the house, where he could tie both horses under shelter until the rain stopped and they could return them to the stables.
“No problem.” The guy pulled his head back, looking up and down the porch, before settling his eyes on the pathetic blue front door that lay on the floor. “Did you need some help with that? Or do you not believe in privacy? Because believe me, around here if you haven’t got your front door closed people are just gonna walk in.”
“But…” Castiel swallowed hard, finally choking down the last glob of suddenly tasteless donut. “But you haven’t even heard my pitch.”
“As a colleague, I shouldn’t badmouth him to you, Dean.” Castiel paused, but only for a moment before his hands came back up. “But as your friend, I can tell you he’s a total assbutt.”
But Dean had bigger problems than a disembodied voice speaking a language he didn’t know—he was awake, for one thing.
“I booked us a nice quiet table at the back,” Castiel said as they progressed inside. “And made sure they had your favorite bourbon, as I’m driving.”
Castiel took out a package of baby wipes and swiftly wiped up his dried come from Dean's skin, before pulling clean underwear from the basket for Dean, then wrapping him in his arms, tugging him across the couch and into Castiel's lap.
After weaving around a few vehicles in various states of repair, she stopped and held out the keys to Dean. “Here you go. She’s all yours—fix her up good, now.”
—Dean’s fingers finally found a seam in the glassy exterior. He could feel something below his feet gently sucking the fluid from the egg, like a plughole in a bathtub. The swirling slime began to drain out, allowing him a small gap where he could feel something other than slime, and he began running his fingers desperately across the interior of the egg.
Dean’s back arched away from the bench, curling up in a pose he rarely encountered outside of the gym (which he avoided whenever he could). He moaned into Castiel’s mouth, greedy for the taste of him, and the low ache of the stretch only added to the feeling of contentment building in Dean’s body.
“Hey, whatever happened to us going on that date, huh?” Dean said around a mouthful of pizza, knocking his foot into Castiel’s on the coffee table where they both sprawled in front of the TV, watching an old spaghetti western. Dean had been at work for twelve hours and Castiel had started the first scene of his new novel, hated it, scrapped it, and rewritten it several more times—they’d needed some TV that was easy on the mind. Plus, cowboys were hot.
Sam grimaced. “It does help, but really, it just leaves us with an even bigger pile of research to do.”
“Yeah,” Dean said. “I remember maintaining it while we travelled to the edge of the system, before we were put into hypersleep.”
Sam spoke, but Dean was too focused on the overwhelming eyes before him and he barely heard a word. Only their guest’s own small smile and nod pulled Dean from his enchantment.
I hope you enjoyed a fluffy little 'slice of life' bonding moment for our boys. We've got places to go and things to find, but these two will always be our main focus!
Their waitress hustled over after a minute, smiling  awkwardly. “Lovers’ tiff?” she asked, tilting her head toward the door. “Not that it’s any of my business. But I’ve worked here ten years, so I’ve seen plenty of folks run out like that.”
Forty minutes later, Dean and Castiel were both sitting down at different kitchen tables, several miles apart across town, digging into their fresh-cooked burgers. Dean had his laptop on the table in front of him as if Castiel was sitting across from him.
Anna regarded Dean for a long minute with a grin that wouldn’t have looked out of place on Sam, before leaning forward almost conspiratorially.
Dean’s spine was stiff, immediately wanting to shut the conversation down and talk about something else, but…it wasn’t such a bad idea. Maybe not the date thing, but surprising Castiel with the car, when he probably expected to wait days and pick it up himself? That’d make him smile.
Dean glared. “Don’t be a prude, Samantha. Don’t tell me you haven’t wondered. You know, a good brother would—”
“So,” the man forged on, unaware of Castiel’s floundering, it seemed, “Ash is who you’re gonna need. He knows his stuff. He lives in an RV on the other side of the field behind the Roadhouse Café, I know you know where that is. Don’t mind how trashed the place looks, I promise you he’s sober enough to get it done.”
With that, Dean shoved his phone back into his pocket, defeated. His chances of improving his day had just dropped dramatically. Nonetheless, he straightened his shoulders and grabbed his notebook, turning his attention to the huge whiteboard at the front of the class that Professor Adler always covered in numbers and ramblings. It was clear, waiting for him to start.
Dean pulled the shaky truck up in front of the off-white, two-story cabin. Well, at one point it had probably
It was tempting; Dean was, quite literally, Castiel’s sexiest dreams come to life as he stood on the slippery stones, water cascading around his freckled shoulders, with nothing but his trusty brown fedora positioned carefully to maintain his dignity.
Dean swallowed back the urge to tell him that his name was as beautiful as he was. Wouldn’t want to give the guy the wrong impression. “I’m Dean,” he went with, instead.
"My dad’s the local pastor—you look a lot like him, actually, but less judgey—and my mom is, well, high strung.”
Blindfolds, immobilization, leather restraints, ropes, and cuffs were all easy yesses for them both. Dean said maybe to full head hoods; he’d never tried one. Castiel said no, so they moved on. Japanese bondage was a resounding yes; Dean extended that to a maybe for suspension, another thing he’d never tried but liked the idea of. That one was a solid yes for Castiel.
“You’re such a weirdo,” Dean said affectionately. “Peanut butter just doesn’t belong on burgers, man.”
“Dean and I had a little chat,” Castiel began calmly. “And we’ve decided that our time is better spent focusing on getting the ship functional than at sniping at each other.”
There, on the windshield of the sleek, clearly beloved Chevrolet Impala, was Castiel’s favorite dildo.
“I don’t know why you were hiding the oil, man,” Dean said, his brain apparently entirely disengaged by the sight of the muscled planes on either side of Castiel’s spine. “Honestly, it smells pretty great. It’s not like it’s gross or offensive. I don’t know why you’re so embarrassed about it.”
Slowly, painfully slowly to Dean’s eyes, Castiel let go of the handle, his hand drifting gradually down to his side as he took in every inch of the room. Dean could see his gaze moving methodically over everything, taking it all in, his expression entirely unreadable.
Dean blinked slowly, his worldview adjusting yet again, as it had countless times in the last couple of days. “So, all this time,” he said, “if I’d wanted to see them, just been curious, all I had to do…”
“Yes, Sir,” Dean agreed, a tiny shiver travelling down through his outstretched arms to where his palms rested on the floor. He really, really hoped that Castiel would spank him that hard.
The bed was still cozy from Dean’s presence, and Castiel indulgently rolled into the warm spot he’d left, snuggling down into the pillow. Yesterday had been… Castiel’s heart fluttered in his chest at the recollection. It was corny, and cheesy, and Castiel should have cringed at how ridiculous it was, but even so…the whole day had been one of the sweetest in Castiel’s memory. Hanging out with Dean, driving with Dean, having Dean in his bed.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean said, picking up the laptop and moving it over to the couch. He wasn’t at work, after all.
Castiel was magnificent. Dean had never seen someone who could pull off both rumpled and commanding simultaneously. His knowledge of his field, his personal investment, and his god damned in-charge eyebrow were a stunning combination.
Thank you so much for the overwhelmingly positive reaction to the first chapter. That really means a lot, I was super nervous to share this one so I let out a huge sigh of relief. At least for now, lol!
He’d left Earl on the floor in the front. As far as Dean was concerned, he killed monsters, and some humans fit that definition just as well as their supernatural counterparts.
Dean could feel a goofy grin stretching across his face, and he buried it momentarily in Castiel’s neck, leaving kisses there just because he could. “Purgatory,” he whispered. “I mean, I fell for you long before that, but I realized in Purgatory. That my life would never be the same without you in it. Never been able to move on, since.”
Dean’s body, a rippling sensation travelling from the low, fleshy part of his ass right up to the top.
“You like this show?” Dean asked, opening the pizza boxes on the coffee table. (One meat and one four cheese—because he hadn’t known if Castiel had a preference, but he sure as hell wasn’t going to order a vegetable pizza.)
Thank you so much for reading! Did you like Liz's art of Cas all hunched up in his trenchcoat? I loved it, I just want to smush his little cheeks, haha!
As a child, Winchester Hall had been his refuge. As he’d grown into a young man, it had become an isolating place where he’d felt pressured into a life he didn’t want.
“I’ve seen you, with your millions of hip-hop and rap CDs and your Wu-Tang Clan t-shirts, Cas—and you were most definitely playing the Beastie Boys in the kitchen a couple of weeks back,” Dean said.
Shaking his head, Castiel huffed out a laugh. “You’re like a toddler. But yes, tomorrow, Dean. You can take me on a blind date with Bellbird Valley.”
“Well, I figure we can do it at our speed, instead. If, uh, if you wanna go with me?” Dean asked, fixing Castiel with his most charming, hopeful smile.
Yeah, the world is still here. That’s a reward in itself. Sam is still here. Even Jack. Dean tries to focus on them, on their success, but there’s a black maw of a hole that walks around beside him, haunting the negative space where an angel should be.
The silver nib attached to the trim goose feather that Dean used to answer his correspondence blacked with a tremulous drip of ink as it hovered, unmoving, above the page. There were things he wanted to say, wanted to ask, but knew that he could not.
Slowly, Castiel settled once more, almost melting down into the mattress, his eyes trained half-heartedly on the continuing documentary as sea birds and whales flew and swam their way across the screen.
Oh, for goodness sake—Dean shook himself. What was the point of being Earl if he couldn’t use it to his advantage on occasion?
“Nah,” Dean said, finding his response honest whereas days ago it might not have been. “Situation is weird. You, though… You’re alright.”
“I understand that the two of you have corresponded,” Jess said, nodding eagerly. “It would be remiss of us not to have the both of you get a proper, face-to-face introduction as soon as possible.”
Holding Dean’s gaze unflinchingly, Castiel tilted his head just a fraction, enjoying the way Dean’s eyes followed the motion. Then he leaned forward, hovering his lips right above Dean’s ear as he asked, “Are you being a brat because you want to leave, or because you think I’ll like it?”
He was ten minutes early—he wanted to make sure he had the correct room—but as it was the first day of school, he wasn’t the only one. Castiel arrived seconds after Dean, sweeping into the room in a crumpled beige trench coat. Dean couldn’t help but bite back a smile; this dude was incredibly hot (like, stop-drop-and-roll hot), but his fashion sense seemed to have been inherited from an accountant who slept under bridges.
Dean waited until he was done eating—if Castiel thought he could out-wait or out-stubborn a Winchester, he had another think coming.
“I do,” Castiel said. “If you want to, at least. I mean, I uh, I don’t know anything much about movies, I’m not very well-versed in—”
Castiel blinked in surprise before looking away quickly, but Dean caught the surprised flush on his cheeks. They managed to squeeze up a busy flight of stairs before Castiel tapped his elbow again.
Dean heard Castiel padding barefoot around to where his head hung, heard the creak of his leather pants as he crouched down in front of Dean. With two fingers outstretched, Castiel lifted Dean’s chin. Drawing his eyes up to meet Castiel’s would make Dean’s neck ache if he held it for long in this position, but Dean couldn’t give a damn if he tried. The way that Castiel gazed at him was like a drug and his whole body was begging for a hit—in more ways than one.
Settling the heavy fountain pen into his hand, Dean nodded along. Alright. This wasn’t his first rodeo at this—no problem. It was the first time he’d done it over dinner in public, or in quite this depth, but he was fairly sure Castiel had at least a little bit of an unexplored exhibitionist streak in him somewhere, so he shouldn’t have been so surprised.
Bobby still looked reluctant, but he eventually agreed to leave after—somewhat threateningly, in his usual style—telling Dean that he’d better text for help if he needs it, and good luck not telling Sam because he’d already messaged him.
Castiel angled himself just a little so that he was facing Dean more fully and picked up his coffee with a small smile. “Go ahead.”
Pink-cheeked, Castiel rolled his eyes to the ceiling before he looked back at Dean and admitted, “I was arrested once.”
Looking up at the clock on the concrete wall, Dean decided he had time to look at the Firebird’s radiator, too, before he had to leave and begin the drive up to Manhattan for class.
against the classic car’s front bumper, the shitty suitcase sprang open, spraying Castiel’s life across the country road.
“No!” Dean fought back, growling. “What about us? What about everything we ever promised each other? In this till the end, huh, Sam? Going out
Dean threw Sam one more warning look before he turned back to Anna. “Let’s take you on back to meet the boss.”
“Because you need new Grindr pictures, and trust me when I say that this—” She gestured vaguely to the lump of blanket and three-day bed sweat that was Castiel, “—isn’t really working for you.”
Holding up the keys and clipboard that she’d grabbed from Bobby’s desk, Jo jerked her head to the other side of the bay.
Dean’s bark of laughter was unexpected, but Castiel liked it. “Glad to know you think I look like a model, Cas,” Dean said, winking cheekily before he carried on, wiggling his eyebrows. “Does this mean I’ve got something going for me, at least?”
With another low huff, Castiel gave a slow nod. “You may be right. And I do, Dean. I do trust you. And I…will try and communicate better with you, as you have been trying to do.”
“I don’t want to do it if what I’m providing is negative. If you wanted me to hurt you, to deny you, to objectify you…then I would do those things. It is your reaction, though, that is pleasing and arousing, not the act itself. So why would I want to do anything that would not get a positive reaction from you, hmm?”
, having that in his head. He’s angry at himself and he’s angry at the Empty and he’s angry at Billie—Fuck, he’s even angry at Cas, that dramatic fucking bastard.
Castiel felt trapped between Kaia’s warning and Claire’s hopeful eyes, so he smiled thinly and picked up a cookie. “Sure,” he said, trying to sound more positive about it than he now felt. It wouldn’t do to offend the locals on his first day.
“Oh?” Dean asked, shuffling his weight on the couch so that he turned to face Castiel a little. “I was just wondering, that’s all. I gotta admit I was...kinda looking forward to it, honestly.”
Castiel had already hauled himself out of his makeshift tub in anticipation, and he was sitting right inside the door, upright, his tail curled around him to the left. In his hand, still, was his slightly damp copy of
Dean grunted as he rolled onto his side, but he reached out and took the bottle. While he drank a few deep gulps, Castiel reached under the bed and pulled out the duffle bag that he’d stashed there when he’d first checked in and paid to rent the room.
Meg snorted as they moved down the trestle table to where the solo cups and paper plates lurked. “He has a confederate flag on his car. You should switch it out for a pride flag, see if he notices.”
“How’d you get so good at beer pong?” Dean asked, angling himself toward Castiel so that he could sign more clearly.
The understandably irate Mystery Spot owner pulled the gun up, aimed, and fired once more—a last-ditch effort.
When Castiel fell quiet, Dean ducked down to press his lips to Castiel’s temple. Straightening up, Castiel wiped under his eyes, a little flushed, but with a small smile tugging at his lips.
Castiel stayed silent, bracing himself for the arguments and complaints about how silly and hippyish such a project was in the first place.
Castiel’s smile was slightly wolfish. “Not if you’re too uncomfortable to do so, of course. But it does make it more fun.”
It was a kind of perfection. Fucked up perfection, the kind Dean wouldn’t ever tell anyone about if they didn’t already understand…but his perfection.
, Dean couldn’t help but think as he gazed across at Castiel, though he at least controlled himself enough to bite his tongue against telling his friend that he, certainly, was very well charmed by him.
They fiddled with the holo-map a while longer, noting the large red zones that took up huge swathes of the front of the ship. They could see where MEG, as she had explained to them before, had routed the remaining oxygen supplies to the Nest. She was keeping the occupants of the stasis pods alive with huge filters siphoning the air down into tubes and keeping the lungs of the crew steadily filled while they slumbered. The rest of the ship was dicey. If Dean and Castiel wanted to go anywhere other than the bridge, elevators, or a brief slice of the residence deck, Dean realized, they’d be out of luck unless MEG moved some things around.
“MEG,” Castiel’s voice drifted up from the lower bunk after a moment. “Do we get our personal effects?”
It was all that Dean dared to say, but he hoped it was enough to convey at least some of the profound bond that he had developed with Castiel since he had come to know him.
Castiel bit back a smile, dragging his gaze from where he’d been staring at Dean singing. He looked out of the window instead, taking in the verdant late-summer hedges and laden trees that lined the narrow, grassy roadways of Bellbird Valley.
“Because the influence of Light was…weaker, locked away,” Michael mused, nodding as he spoke. “It’s a reasonable hypothesis. Amara is here, out in the world. She’s controlling herself, doing better, but she cannot change what she
It was dumb to be nervous, Dean knew that. It was just a movie. He’d been to movie theatres a couple of times, but it was a baffling experience of indecipherable picture sequences in the dark when he couldn’t make out ninety percent of what the characters were saying. He hadn’t even known that there
, if you wish.  I also have a bunch of fic coming up I thought I'd let you know about--all very varied, but all with happy endings, as always.
Dean reached up to splay his fingers across Castiel’s firm pectorals, skimming them lightly with the pads of his fingers before gliding on up to his collarbones. Dean’s eyes followed his hands, slipping across Castiel’s wide shoulders and down to his biceps. Castiel watched him explore, his lips parted and his chest rising and falling with slow, steady breaths. Gripping more firmly, Dean’s fingers wrapped around Castiel’s upper arms and pulled him down to the bed with him.
“Well, we could… We could watch something together,” Castiel suggested. From the way his arms were moving on the screen, Dean could tell that Castiel was fidgeting a little as if he was nervous.
Dean’s heart thudded to a stop as Castiel leaned slightly into his space, raising a hand to Dean’s face. Shyly, Castiel murmured, “For you, my attention is easy to give, Dean.”
Dean paced in the corridor for as long as he could stand, until the ball of vipers in his stomach wouldn’t let him wait another minute. His own body ached and snarled with fear and worry as he pushed open the bathroom door, letting the steam curl out without looking inside.
“That would have been a better plan than expecting to see you this morning and ending up with Hannah, anyway.”
Baby was purring herself awake and Dean was digging through his shoebox of old cassette tapes by the time Castiel appeared next to her driver’s side door. Dean looked up as a shadow fell over him, smiling easily to see the angel.
“Why not? Who would know, beside the servants of our house? Would it be so strange for me to move my friend and steward into a home as large as Winchester Hall, to stave off loneliness now that my family is gone? Mrs. Harvelle would keep our secrets, Cas, and dismiss any maid who would question the exact truth of the matter.”
Weariness stemming from his long carriage journey up north from Portsmouth soon pulled Dean into sleep, and it was only one of the servants knocking on the bedroom door that roused him in time to dress.
It was thick, and old, and written by someone named Harif Ala Al-din before being translated by a helpful-sounding Tracy Shadwell.
Castiel’s pelvis rolled in agreement, and Dean teased his touch a fraction further past the elastic. He edged down inch by inch, stroking his fingers across Castiel’s soft skin, trailing his nails gently over the tight muscle of his ass and the sharp, ruinous rise of his hipbone.
“I’m sorry, fuck—I didn’t know,” he said, an edge of shock and surprise to his voice that Castiel couldn’t, for the life of him, understand.
“One of your friend Crowley’s contacts! Once Uncle Zach mentioned the possibility, I did a little digging around and tracked him down. The new clients he’s working for would be willing to take it on, now it’s already renovated and not a risk to their portfolio anymore.”
Ms. Moseley stood from behind her desk and stuck her head out of the office door. Dean could only assume that she shouted for someone, because when she returned to her seat she smiled brightly before indicating the door.
Look at all that beautiful communication, folks! These two are so good for each other. Most of the time, anyway...when they're patient, lol.
Gingerly letting himself inside, watching his fingers on the paint, Castiel admired the door. It was sturdy and well hung—possibly the sturdiest thing in the whole house at this point—and the paint was perfect, not a streak in sight. Dean did good work. It was really very kind of him, Castiel decided, feeling a little guilty about his previous hasty judgements. Alright, perhaps they weren’t friends, yet. But maybe now they could share a room without awkwardness, Castiel hoped.
“The more you’re immersed in it the easier it’ll be for you to obtain fluency,” Sam said, as if Dean needed reminding. “It’s important. The internet says that ASL could open up a whole new culture for you now that you’ve finally taken your head out of your ass about it. I want to support you.”
“Ah, actually—” Dean held up his ice pack with a sheepish grimace, “—everything is a little fuzzy right now. Would it be weird if I asked you to fill it out for me?”
“MEG,” Castiel called out, throwing his arms up in the air. “Can you explain to us how to get this working?”
The man on the screen blinked twice, slow and confused, before pushing a hand nervously back through his hair. Ahh...that’s what was up with the hair. “Good morning,” he said, smiling awkwardly.
He stuck the spoon back in his mouth so that he could reach down and grab a fistful of his t-shirt, taking a cautious sniff. Alright, she had a point. Wallowing in self-pity was a little gross, there were definitely better ways to be both single and unemployed.
With a soft hum of agreement, Sam fell into step beside him. Dean felt a swell of gratitude for his steadfast, reliable brother, who hadn’t hesitated to commit a third-degree felony at Dean’s side…and it was hardly the first time.
“Not one of the great questions of the universe, Cas,” Dean pointed out. “I’m going to stop at a diner and grab some decent breakfast, then I’m driving north to get supplies. You can come or not, it’s not a big deal.”
“There we go,” he announced. “Back to looking like your usual smirking, cocky, underwear-model self.”
Dean quickly reached out for Charlie’s shoulders to spin her around, pointing her at the frat house. “Go, you. Find friends. We’ll be in there in a minute.”
Dean gave out a low, sexy chuckle. “Just worried about interruptions, or did you plan on letting me flirt with you over coffee again?”
After eyeing Castiel thoughtfully for a minute, Fatback sauntered off out of the dining room, where Castiel had been painting the new trim that Dean had installed, and snuffled off down the hall.
Dean shushes him with one finger. It’s light as a feather as he rests it on Castiel’s bottom lip, but Castiel hushes instantly, his eyes widening an impossible fraction more.
“I hope she feels better soon,” Castiel said with a frown, remembering how kind she’d been when he’d caught the flu. “Can I do anything to help?”
Castiel nodded, performing a little series of name signs: his own, a G with wings, an M with wings, an H, an A. “My mother likes things very orderly,” he explained.
“How’re you already so good at pressing my buttons?” Dean asked as Castiel’s thumb slipped up over his slit. He felt the gentle squeeze as Castiel coaxed out a drip of pre-come and the wetness spreading over the head of his cock.
Dean’s breath hitched as Castiel threw his head side to side, flicking his sweat-soaked hair out of his eyes. His locks looked almost black, curling from the dampness. He was practically steaming, every muscle vibrating as he danced forward on his toes, punching harder, harder, again, again.
Happy New Year, everyone! It's a few days past, but this is my first post of 2021 so it felt right to say. I have so many plans and goals and hopes for 2021, I'm determined to make it a better year than 2020 by pure positivity alone. My first goal is to finish posting this fic for you! Not too much longer to go, and then I'll be sharing my Deaf Dean fic that some of you are so kindly excited for!
“Dean,” Castiel said softly, taking his turn to clutch gently at Dean’s hands and hold them to his chest. “I trust you. I trust you to listen to me and let me decide what I’m ready for. I trust you let me set my own boundaries, which is what I’m doing now. And I trust you to stop, if I need to. Mia says that’s what is important. To be with someone who respects my needs.”
At that, he got a laugh from Castiel, and the Russian shook his head affectionately before he responded, after a long, deep breath, “Graphoerotica.”
Dean dug his wallet out of his jeans pocket and flipped it open to his membership card. Benny, as the bouncer for these party nights ever since he got married and became a private-play-only kinda guy, was a pedant for procedure, even though he knew damn well who Dean was.
“Alright. Might as well have the officers bar, then. Up by the bridge.” MEG sounded entirely careless, and if it wasn’t impossible, Dean would have said she sounded as depressed as he felt.
“Just because I like listening to the music that I remember from high school doesn’t mean I can’t appreciate older songs. Or even something from this actual decade,” Castiel responded with a teasing glance. “Unlike some people.”
There was certainly no requirement to be masked at the club—almost everyone here knew each other. But for Dean, and a couple of other members who did the same, it was a headspace thing. Putting on his mask let him lose the connection to
Russian had sounded like a mess of consonants shaken with rocks when Dean had first heard Castiel speak it. Now, he was so familiar with his Dom’s low, commanding tones that he heard the underlying, beautiful melody that formed the language, and it was even more erotic than ever.
Castiel laughed and took a big swig of his beer before responding. “I’m sorry, Dean. But I don’t think it has. There are a lot of things I’ve discovered I like about it though, recently. But I’m not sure it’s sealed the deal.”
Dean felt unbearably cold. “I’m not here to take anything from you that you don’t want to give, Castiel,” he said carefully. “I need those scales and you’re the only way I can get them, but I am not like those other people. I promise.”
Sam gave Dean a long look before bailing out of the passenger seat, loping his way through the garage and away to the library like a giraffe fleeing lions.
Dean leaned forward, shoulder-to-shoulder with Castiel again, and they both squinted carefully at the image in silence. They both knew what they were looking for, though neither of them would say it aloud; MEG had provided the blueprints so that they could begin assessing the damage to the ships air systems (and they could see the red glowing sections where oxygen didn’t reach easily enough) but they didn’t want to alert her—or her grumpy evil twin—to what they were really searching for.
“Yes!” Crowley spat toward the door, slapping it again. “I just received the titles for thirty properties for the new spa client! What the hell am I supposed to tell them now?”
“Yeah,” Claire grumbled, swiping furiously at the countertop. “Kaia wasn’t feeling too good this morning, told her to stay in bed.”
When Dean made to pull back, the bitter tang of fresh beer somehow tasting different from someone else’s mouth, Castiel brought his hand to Dean’s neck and waylaid him into another kiss. The second kiss was somehow both deeper and softer, and Dean loved the way their clinging lips didn’t quite seem to want to part, still sticking gently even as their eyes fluttered back open and their breaths fell softly between them.
Castiel’s hand slipped down to pluck at the elastic of Dean’s pajama pants, a cozy pair he’d gotten as an early Christmas gift from Ellen.
“You mistake my concern for judgement,” Dean said quietly, nudging Baby to step up to Connie’s side so that he could reach across to press a hand lightly to Castiel’s elbow. “I assure you; I would not think poorly of you for that kind of company. I understand it.”
Castiel nodded, twisting his face up to Dean’s to share his smile. “I am. This life, here with you...it makes me very happy. I never thought I’d have something like this, with someone. I sing of it every single day.”
Castiel flipped so quickly that their heads almost bumped, turning over, wide-eyed, until they were lying chest-to-chest on the bed. The position opened up Castiel’s back and allowed Dean to get both hands up behind him, digging his fingers more firmly into the suddenly tight muscles he’d been idly stroking. The angel gave out a choked sigh at the sensation, his head lolling forward until his forehead touched Deans. Eyes closed, he let out a low moan. “Oh, that feels so much better,” he confessed, his spine seeming to melt into Dean’s embrace.
“On your own this morning?” Castiel asked with a frown, walking up to his usual table close to the counter, where a perfectly brewed coconut milk drip was waiting for him in a white mug.
,” Dean protested, even as Baby’s frame shuddered with the motion of her driver’s side door slamming.
Sam nodded, flicking his eyes across to Dean before he answered. “Castiel is our friend. My brother freed him from captivity and released him, but he still can’t be who he was.”
It's been a whirlwind couple of weeks for me. (Dull work deadlines, a brief covid scare, a freelance editing job to do, a sick horse, and medical appointments...I have a glass of wine right now and it feels deserved, lol!) Because of that I've only just cleared my AO3 inbox, but I will endeavor to be quicker this week!
“Nothing to be sorry for, for either of you,” Bobby said, crossing his arms firmly. “You both do your jobs and do ‘em exactly how I taught you—or how John did. I got no problems with either of you. I should be the one apologizing to you, Dean. I should’ve done something about Cole a long time ago.”
“Not today, you two,” Castiel said tiredly. He did not have the patience for the neverending childish squabbling that Dean and Balthazar seemed to be prone to.
Castiel nodded over his steaming, delicious coffee before taking a careful, hot sip. “Yes, he’s been working on it every spare minute that Bobby hasn’t needed him. We’re making a lot of progress.”
Dean looked up enough to see Castiel’s agreeing nod, then pushed past the desk and headed out and back downstairs, welcoming the rain.
“Because you didn’t answer when I yelled to come in, obviously.” She looked almost proud of herself, her teeth flashing as she gave Dean a mischievous wink.
“No.” Dean smiled gratefully as he shook his head. “I can do it, you don’t have to help. I want to do it.”
Splashes of his own warmth spurted across Dean’s stomach and ribs, and the hot, liquid sensation deep within his ass carried on…and on. Finally, his arm shaking against Dean’s shoulder, Castiel slowly pulled out, his sinuous cock slithering wetly over Dean’s prostate with one last
Castiel let out a series of sharp coughs, and Dean could feel his gills gasping shakily against his palm where he was holding him. The soot must be even worse for the merman than it was for him, Dean realized.
“Bobby already found a replacement transmission,” Jo said. “He had one back at the lot. I’ll go get it, you inspect it for other issues. I know you won’t want to be giving this one back with waiting problems.”
was the one always getting his way. Hopefully Meg was treating little Jack and Claire well for the summer and remembering to check that their carrots were fresh, not bendy.
The breeze was picking up, the raindrops hitting Dean’s bare shoulders growing fatter, the clouds darker, fighting against the increasing sunlight.
that now, knows without a doubt that all the things he has done that he thought were completely unforgivable...they aren’t.
Air blew across the pads of Dean’s exploring fingers as the seam parted. The egg split, the top part opening like a lid with a
“I’m everything you aren’t,” Dean continued. “A college dropout who only got the balls to try again at nearly thirty, who eats bad food and can never quite get the engine grease from under his nails no matter how many showers I take. I think I’d have asked you out months ago if—”
Thanks so much for taking the time to read my notes about the fic and gain a little extra understanding. If you have any questions throughout I will do my best to answer them in your comments, or I may put it here if it needs to be generally said--unless it's a spoiler, of course!
Steel-toed work boots made Dean’s steps echo as he stepped away from the bedroom, clomping his way down the stairs.
Nodding his agreement, Dean moved alongside his brother and sister-in-law. They headed through the wide, double oak doors into the home he hadn’t seen for years. Winchester Hall was blocky and intimidating, but even so, Dean had loved it here as a boy. When he was young and spent his summers here with Sam and Jess and various other children of the local nobility, he’d stocked away many memories of sunny days riding across his father’s lands, evenings eating apple pies baked with fresh fruit from their orchard, and sneaking out with Sammy at night to tell ghost stories in the abandoned barns.
“Uncle Dean!” she yelled enthusiastically, all knobbly knees and tiny pigtails as she ricocheted her way through Dean’s small kitchen.
There was relief, he supposed, that the Ranch was gone entirely, that its horrors had been physically obliterated even if mentally they lived on. It didn’t feel like justice, though. Nothing would, Dean guessed. But it did feel somewhat like closure.
And they both had all of his contact details and a full itinerary. Just in case. No matter how much he tried to let them handle their own mistakes these days, there was still that one night a couple of months back when Castiel had spent hours negotiating with and sweet talking a
The words added another staccato layer to the music Dean’s body was making. “Yeah, Cas,” he agreed, warm and fuzzy. “Really wanna kiss you, too.”
The hour sped by and, before Dean knew it, they were rushing across campus together and into Adler’s math class.
The next door swung open more easily, and Dean was met with the toothfull maw of a scared-looking female vampire, already waiting, eager to flee. Her eyes had that same chemical, glassy look that Castiel’s had.
Dean spluttered out the last of his dignity and pointed a threatening finger at Jo. “You—you shut up.”
Castiel flushed pink on the screen, but even so, he answered seriously, “Dean, I mean it. The project can wait if you just don’t feel up to it. We’re ahead of schedule anyway.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean replied distractedly, sinking down into one of the two chairs at the dorm table. “What’s the plan for today?”
The guy shrugged. “Sure, whatever you say. But most folks in these parts only see suits for funerals, ‘cept maybe my brother, but he’s a lawyer. Not sure you’ll find a lot of places to wear that out to, here in the Valley.”
” Castiel whined, his metal barstool screeching awfully against the tile floor as he flopped back onto it. He had several shots of alarmingly clear liquor gathered in each hand, Dean realized. Castiel nudged Dean in the ribs. “How am I supposed to drink all of these and get blackout drunk if I can’t put them down?”
—a huge, wild, undoubtedly-feral pig—dart straight out of the closet and clamber right over the top of him in its haste to get out of the room.
Dean wanted the couch to open up and eat him, but instead, he turned his attention back to Sam. “End of this conversation. I have a whole docket of cars to work on and then a massive pile of homework to get through if I want to be able to go out for a drink tonight.”
The sight made Dean’s blood boil deep in his gut, his hips rolling up against Castiel’s thigh desperately.
Dean wondered if Castiel could feel the thumping in his chest. They stood like that for a minute, wrapped in each other, warm against the cool night. Then Castiel pulled back, just enough to free his hands and give Dean the space to observe them.
Backpack on one arm, Dean dawdled into Engineering Hall with a piece of cold toast in hand. He’d intended to eat it on the way here, but he’d forgotten in favor of chugging a whole thermos of coffee. Shoving it in his mouth, Dean was dusting a cascade of crumbs from his front when he felt a nudge to his shoulder.
We have one last little chapter to wrap this all up, which I'll be posting on Tuesday. I'm going to miss these two, but there's lots more fic coming very soon...and I happen to know that Liz has some really gorgeous projects up her sleeve, too!
Professor Adler greeted the students, Dean guessed, with a vague shift of his lips that indicated he wasn’t in the best mood, his paper cup of watery tea looking even more sickly than usual as he placed it on the little-used podium.
Resuming his humming, Dean returned to the dishes, adding an extra squirt of (biodegradable) detergent to the sink and sloshing a bit more hot water in. He smiled down at the plates as he rinsed them. In his human form, Castiel ate more than he did as a Mer, but he still preferred fish. He had, however, developed an oddly intense love for PB&J, Dean’s burgers, and really crappy frozen burritos.
Dean opened his mouth to bellow straight back—but by some miracle managed to bite his tongue. He balled his fists, and took a long, deep breath. “Look, b—Cas. Cas. We don’t know each other. We’re stressed and scared and getting off on the wrong foot, yeah? So how about we both just try and calm the fuck down, and work out how to make this little bonding exercise as short as possible?”
“Yeah, have breakfast with me,” Sam offered before Castiel could answer. “My wife is out of town visiting my in-laws, so some company would be nice. And you did promise to tell me all about your plans for Bellbird Valley Farm.”
His thumb hovered over Dean’s contact for a few minutes, on and off, before he gave up with a sigh and opened up his text messaging app instead. But after several attempts at an apology, an explanation, he hadn’t gotten anywhere.
Castiel frowned and slowly slid his hands back in front of himself so that he could sign as he talked.
In his peripheral, Castiel could make out Dean tugging on his pants from beside the bed. “What news?” Castiel asked skeptically. He’d hardly answered the phone and interrupted morning cuddles just for
,” MEG corrected. “The ship’s life support capabilities are currently too poor to support more than two people, and protocol requires that if any human is awake, a medic must be present.”
Dean’s grin was something else. Slightly crooked, it revealed perfectly even, white teeth that just helped to highlight how stunningly symmetrical the man’s freckled face was. He had hair the color of wet midsummer sand and endearing wrinkles beginning around his eyes—he wasn’t some kid doing this job to get through college, that much was clear. He looked to be in his thirties, probably close to Castiel’s own age.
“Talk to me, Cas,” Dean encouraged, trailing his fingers over the smooth, hard firmness of his cock within his boxers. “Tell me what you’re doing.”
The coffee was the pick-me-up. Not the absolutely beautiful barista. Or so Castiel kept trying to remind himself.
He was far from relaxed. When Sam had found this place, they’d talked (Winchester for ‘argued’) for thirty minutes over whether they should just burn it to the ground.
“Of course,” Castiel said, reaching to take his freshly refilled coffee back from Claire. “Some company would be nice, at least it’d stop me from bothering Claire.”
She flounced away merrily, and Dean let his face slowly fall once more, let the hurt seep back through his body.
Armed with nutritious root veggies, Castiel went in search of the pig. He wasn’t—thank God—in the dining room with the paint. He didn’t seem to be in the hallway, and when Castiel stuck his head upstairs, all was silent.
Amara’s eyes didn’t leave Castiel. She flicked her fingers, and Dean felt like he got hit in the sternum by an eighteen-wheeled semi-truck. He flew to the other side of the room, kissing the floor with a mouth that already tasted like blood. He heard his ribs crack, then his ears rang so badly that he couldn’t even register what Castiel and Amara were shouting at each other—all he knew was that this was
Within the Impala, the buzzing tension between them seemed to fill the space exponentially, until they were breathing it. Dean settled automatically behind the steering wheel, though he didn’t feel particularly inclined to actually drive once Castiel slid into the passenger seat.
After a few minutes Dean nonchalantly said, “Looks like there’s a break in the wall here. Want to move over to the next grid?”
Time stretched out compassionately to allow them a chance to catch up on the years they’d missed. They lay on Dean’s sheets, in Castiel’s nest—their nest, now, kind of, Dean supposed—just kissing, learning and memorizing. Castiel had been hesitant at first, but once he’d been reassured this was what Dean wanted, he was all in. Castiel kissed like the force of nature he’d always been, his hands earthquakes, his breath a hurricane, his lips a tornado. And Dean was just a tumbleweed, helplessly caught up and blown far, far from Kansas.
The guy raised an eyebrow, as if to say that Castiel hadn’t had much of an issue being rude before, but he didn’t say it. Instead, he shrugged. “I realized that if you were new in town, you might not know where to get your phone screen fixed, so I came to suggest a place.”
Silent, swallowing down horror he could barely breathe through, Dean slowly backed away from the door, and headed back to bed.
“Dean,” Castiel snapped, his eyes tearing from Amara long enough to skewer Dean into the ground. “There’s no point in sweet-talking and negotiating here, either she wants to help or—”
When Castiel’s shirt lay open, parting to reveal his tan stomach muscles and firm chest, Dean pressed a line of biting, wet kisses down his sternum to his bellybutton, savoring the slightly salty taste of his skin. Sitting up to catch his breath, the sight of Castiel lying below him on the leather was like a gut punch: this was
“Here should be good, I think...hey, stand next to Cas will you, so I can get this framed right?” Sam said as he reached to take the tripod from Dean.
Dean was so fucking happy for his friend. He couldn’t even be annoyed at how little work Gabriel did for the rest of the day. Instead of cleaning out the walk-in fridge, he spent his time looking up increasingly ridiculous baby shower cakes on Instagram and asking Dean if he thought he could make them.
It had rained earlier but stopped; Dean had sped through a few deep puddles in Baby, but he’d thought that’d be the end of it. Dean turned his face up to the sky, observing the gathering dark clouds with a scowl. Come on, couldn’t he get a break today? Hopefully, if he hurried to class he’d miss the worst of the storm and wouldn’t have to spend an hour and a half sitting there soaking—
Dean has spent his entire life struggling, fighting, locked in mortal combat with everything from Hell, to Heaven, to his own expendable soul. And this...this is what he has to show for it; nothing.
Silence built again until Dean let out a long sigh, and slithered his way to the edge of the bunk. He slid down the ladder, giving Castiel’s mattress a solid kick on the way.
He sounded sad, almost hurt, and Dean paused. He leaned forward, reaching down to the end of the bed to touch Castiel’s shoulder once again. “Well, we’re trying, right? That’s what we’re doing right now.”
“Yeah, left a bit? No, right—your right?” Dean squinted at the shifting image. “Oh, right—left was right.”
Having to spell it out, letter by letter, took a few seconds, but Gabriel’s face broke into a grin only halfway through.
Castiel stopped to huff, covering his face with his hands. The brochures that Crowley had shown him looked nothing like this. Well, it clearly
The priest in the temple desperately tried to persuade a young Luke Perry not to shoot his alien friends, and Dean
“Oh? Dean’s been over to the farm already, has he?” Claire butted in, so far from nonchalant that Castiel’s fingers itched to pinch her mouth shut. But, he knew better; Claire was in charge of the coffee.
Dean picked up the odd case when it was nearby, but mostly...now, his life was mostly this. Running interference on the phones, and living quietly, contentedly, with Castiel.
“Look, I know you hate hospitals, kid. But that was one hell of a whack you ~~, okay? You might not have been able to hear the smack as you went down, but me and Garth sure did.” A small grimace passed over Bobby’s face. “We worry. And look at it ~~ my side of things, just for a damn second—you were injured on my business property. Even just from an insurance perspective, I gotta—”
“So, why aren’t you testing out that freedom right now?” Dean said instead, giving Castiel the gentlest of pushes toward deeper water. “The waves await, Ariel.”
Grinning happily, Charlie finally tucked her phone away, eased off the brake, and pulled away from the curb.
“Alright, alright,” the amiable voice above responded. “I was just asking. I would’ve thought that a flying suitcase depositing your unmentionables across the highway would have indicated a bad day, but what do I know, city slicker?”
Small words, but with so much meaning that they formed a whole conversation, full of explanation and apology and promise, all by themselves.
Dean was just as thwarted for the rest of the evening. He found his eyes pulling to Castiel whenever he was near, and more than once (he hoped, though he realized it may well have been wishful thinking) he caught Castiel turning his head swiftly as if he’d been caught in much the same action.
Sam rolled his eyes, dusting off his thighs before he reached over and probed amongst the crispy, crushed bandaging around the mermaid’s neck. “We got what we needed…we can sweep her up and scatter her into the sea, or something, maybe?”
Leaning into the doorway above Dean’s shoulder, Castiel squeezed his eyes shut and sighed. “I really
“You don’t have to do this,” Castiel said after another minute, so quietly that it would have been easy to miss if Dean hadn’t been straining to listen to every breath that the angel took.
Shifting slightly in his chair, Dean let out a low, breathy exhale, the idea of Castiel pounding into him within the steamed-up Impala making the chub in the front of Dean’s pants much less likely to depart.
On the bridge, the sun dipping down behind them, Castiel reached across to turn Dean’s hand palm upward, one finger slowly tracing across the creases of skin in the curve of it.
“It’s not a whole gallon of cum. Though it is more efficient for breeding to ejaculate heavily,” Castiel said, entirely deadpan as he rolled, lowering his tail from the bed. “More chances means more fertilized eggs.”
“Alright,” Castiel agreed, his tiny smile feeling like the greatest gift Dean had ever received. “Show me how well you can take it, beautiful.”
Crap. Castiel had never intended to make things with Dean so awkward that they couldn’t even share a café. After a small sigh, Castiel shook his head and returned his attention—very happily—to Kaia’s baking, with another delighted groan.
Yeah, so maybe he was a little curious what Castiel was going to show him. It was something special, he knew that much. Castiel had never made any fuss about what time they came in or out of the water before.
Castiel was right in front of him, still holding Dean’s hand as they drifted. And, Dean realized with a jolt, he was glowing too.
“Do you want me to leave?” Castiel asked, his crinkled brow telegraphing his uncertainty as he signed.
Sitting up, Dean kicked his feet over the side of the mattress and cussed softly at the chilling press of the bunker’s concrete floor against his soles. A few more low curses took him to his dresser, where he pulled out a pair of thick, white, winter socks and quickly pulled them on, standing awkwardly one-footed like a flamingo and wobbling next to the chest of drawers. He waggled his toes once he had them on; there, done. He’d be warm soon.
Sounding far too breathless and far too sexy for anyone so inconsiderate and annoying, Castiel called up to the top bunk, “You know there’s an hour daily exercise requirement on board, Dean! MEG woke me up ages ago.”
Behind the Impala, growing smaller by the second, a husky, bald man ran full pelt, shotgun in hand. Relief flooded through Dean—shotguns were powerful, but not that accurate. They were already too far away for him to feel any real concern about any more serious damage to Baby. Thank God.
Even not being able to see, Dean could feel Castiel’s smile against his temple. Dean breathed out, his mind whirling desperately. He felt like he was so close to getting everything he’d ever wanted—but he still didn’t know, wasn’t sure. Perhaps this, just this, a stand-in for a molt companion and little more, was all that Castiel was inferring he wanted.
It was white—actually white, not dingy gray or yellowed—and smelled of soap and fake pine toilet cleaner. There were no windows, which was a blessing, and the tiled-in tub took up a good half of the room.
“Really?” Castiel asked. “In Baby? I’m surprised you’d risk the mess. Though, I should have known…that car practically gives you a boner just by itself.”
Castiel smiled a little more, still looking down at the shirt, so Dean decided to push his luck a bit further.
“This non-existent, theoretical person—or persons, of course—that you want to hang out with,” Sam said, dripping with faux-sincerity, “wouldn’t happen to be a particular professor and historian by the name of something-or-other Novak, would it?”
By the time Dean turned his attention over to Alan, he was bright red and coughing, gazing down at the ice bobbing in his glass like it had betrayed him.
Castiel mirrored Dean’s position, pulling his leg up so that their knees bumped on the seat. “Yes,” he answered simply. His fingers picked nervously at the orange leather for a moment, though, and his eyes dipped a little before he added, “I’m really not terribly experienced with the whole thing.”
Dean shook his own aching head, hoping that the pills he’d popped would kick in soon. There was a pile of washcloths next to the sink. Stretching up to grab one, Dean dunked it in the water that was slowly filling the plastic bathtub and began to gently wipe over Castiel’s scales.
“Section two, bondage and suspension,” Dean read aloud, darting his eyes around once more to check their poor waiter wasn’t about to learn more about his customers than he ever, ever needed to know.
The endless hours of overtime, the declined social invitations, the nights spent alone in his apartment when people eventually stopped asking.
The blonde lifted an eyebrow questioningly, leaning forward on the counter, all elbows. “So, what’s your story?”
Castiel could still hear the throaty vintage engine as he fumbled his keys. As much as he wanted to resist doing anything that Dean told him to do…it seemed like, in this very particular case, Dean might actually have a fair point.
Castiel leaned back in the sun, shaking the water from his hair so that the droplets sprayed out from him in a beautiful rainbow spray. Dramatic bastard. Dean smiled fondly.
“Anyway,” Castiel continued, still refusing to look at Dean at all, “it was a tough course and I got more burnt out than I thought. I made a miscalculation. It was so small, but…”
“Three,” Castiel said from next to Dean, stepping up closer as Dean removed his hands from inside MEG’s barely corporeal body. “You’re helping too.”
“You don’t have to answer me now, or make any kind of permanent decision,” Castiel said, looking straight at Dean in that slightly unnerving way again. “Just think about what worked today and what didn’t, before your next class. We can try out a few methods. And if there are any other issues like the seating today, remember that you aren’t a burden, to me or the class as a whole. I’m not just here to wave my hands around, I’m here to advocate for your needs, whatever they may be.”
“You can skip the humiliation section,” Castiel said, nearly at the bottom of his coffee. “I just don’t think it’s a good fit for you, sweet boy,” he rasped quietly, his dark eyes resting hungrily on Dean while Dean shifted and flushed in his seat, flustered.
Claire and Kaia both stared at him, blinking slowly. Turning to the side, Claire reached out and grabbed a chunky jug of very dark, steaming drip coffee off a metal warming plate behind the counter. She placed it down on the counter between herself and Castiel with a
Yelping and laughing in surprise, Dean grinned into Castiel’s temple. “Oh, fuck,” Dean murmured against his heated skin, “it is so damn sexy that you’re as strong as me.”
Castiel looked down at his slacks and suit. He was used to dressing like this whenever he left the house; it was
“I know what I’m doing, Cas, okay?” Dean said, as softly as he could, giving the angel’s shoulder a little squeeze. He couldn’t quite bring himself to look Castiel in the eye as he talked, but looking at his own fingers resting on Castiel’s shoulder was almost, kinda, maybe the same thing. Close enough.
“So, what’s the big deal that you’ve got to bring me down to the beach in the dark?” Dean asked, navigating his way down the stone steps super slowly with his arms full of tail, his eyes on the beam of the flashlight Castiel shone at his feet.
Quickly, like a decision made and spurred forward before too much thought could be put to it, Castiel reached across and took Dean’s cup from his hand. He held Dean’s eyes as he raised it to his mouth, taking a deep, long chug of his beer. His other hand twisted into Dean’s, his fingers warm between Dean’s own, and he began to walk away from the group, tugging Dean along with him.
The lace underwear that Dean had picked out for the evening were a lush emerald green, the fabric soft against his skin, even across the growing chub that kissing Castiel had quickly brought to life. Dean knew full well that the matching leather harness that cocooned his shoulders and ribs brought out every freckle on his skin, and he could tell from Castiel’s open, hungry expression that his Dom greatly approved. Preening a little, Dean turned toward the bench and swung his hips deliberately as he sauntered toward it—knowing without a doubt that Castiel’s eyes would be caught by the little bow that sat above his ass crack, bouncing jauntily with his movements.
Castiel settled himself, letting out a happy humming sound as he stroked Dean’s hair, resettling his hand so that his fingers tangled loosely in his crown. “Whatever you’d like,” Castiel reiterated generously. “Just keep that dildo right there for me, work yourself on it, keep yourself open and ready for me.”
Then they’d fall silent and watch the flames, kisses fruit-sweet and sticky, before crawling back to their tiny tent, exhausted but happy.
Dean hoped they suppressed the flames that might threaten the legal Ranch and left the rest to burn out.
“No running today,” Castiel spelled out in front of Dean’s chest. “I thought I’d exercise here, instead.”
In his periphery, Dean cataloged movement; Sam had Dean’s knife, and he was cutting himself free. Castiel had let go of Eileen, and was digging in his pocket, pulling out their key piece, their shake-up, their
Castiel let out a low Russian curse, his fingers tightening on Dean’s crown. Dean couldn’t help but be delighted by it; Castiel rarely cursed in English, let alone in Russian. Dean always considered it a sign of a job well done.
white, but the sea air and frequent Washington rain had done a number on the untended vacation home. Now, it was a peeling, dilapidated husk. Dean was pretty sure that anyone who somehow got lost enough to accidentally drive by the place would have thought it was abandoned, purposeless.
“Oh—" Dean opened one eye reluctantly and reached his arm to the left, grabbing a little stack of them from under the bar. Then he awkwardly rolled onto his back, spinning to the side to keep his balance. “—here you go.”
Charlie was brazenly invested in Dean’s love life and welcomed Castiel into the apartment with open arms. Sam was a little less excited, but only because once Dean turned in the keys to his old place, Sam was stuck sleeping on the couch at Charlie’s within—he claimed—earshot of Dean’s bedroom door.
Castiel blinked at first, looking a little surprised, but then relaxed into a smile after a moment. “Definitely,” he agreed. “It’s the cowboy boots.”
Castiel’s hands moved as he spoke, almost as if it was automatic. Communication flowed out of him in tandem, and Dean wasn’t sure he could recall someone ever looking so comfortable as they smiled and said their name, clarifying the spelling with fluid, exceptionally clear finger signs. “Hello, Dean. My name is Castiel. I’m going to be your interpreter while you’re here with us at K State.”
Dean’s eyes jerked up sharply from his letter, to see the burly Duke’s son gesturing to the pages in Dean’s hand with a warm smile.
Castiel shrugged, right there in front of Dean. No sense of personal space. “I believe it to be true.”
There were steps up from the side entrance that Dean had used, rickety metal ones that led into what appeared to be a maintenance shack behind the legal, human brothel. If Dean could just get up the stairs, keep one foot moving in front of the other—
No matter how many times Dean stepped into the drive room, he would never get used to the impressive arc of space that curved around the bow of the ship. When you were on a spaceship, especially one as big as the Saranton, it was actually fairly easy to forget that you were in space at all. The ship was like a city in size, and there was no sense of movement or weightlessness. It felt like Earth inside. Until…that window.
Dean sighed. She was a negotiator just like her Dad, who had high-tailed his way back out to the car the second she’d been admitted to the apartment.
“And if I find out he spilled that oil on purpose, I’ll give those ~~ tapes to Sheriff Mills faster than he can cry for his momma, mark my words.”
“I have no reason to travel far, and it doesn’t matter what you have to do,” Castiel had promised, low and firm. “I’ll go with you.”
They both froze as Castiel’s outburst hung in the air between them. Castiel looked instantly guilty, but Dean felt…relieved? Taking a deep breath, Dean checked in with himself (something he usually avoided doing).
Pulling himself up to his full height and straightening his shoulders, Castiel’s eyes darkened dangerously, his jaw locked firm and tight.
Castiel looked up to respond, and behind Kaia, having just walked through the door, stood none other than…Dean Winchester. Again. He really was everywhere that Castiel was.
This fic has been fully outlined in detail and is coming to me pretty quickly, so while I won't set a specific schedule for posting (because life happens, and I have lots of other things to post, too!) I will say that I'll probably be posting one chapter per week-ish for this baby.
“Thank you, Sir,” Dean gasped out as Castiel released him, his hands returning to the meat of Dean’s ass.
“Technically, yes,” Dean responded, tapping away. “I just started classes today, but I guess I’m a ‘mature student’ compared to most of these kids.”
Despite himself, Dean can’t do much beyond grunt in agreement. “Yeah, because I destroy everything I touch.”
Still warm from dancing, Dean quickly shrugged off his thick, checked shirt. Castiel began to protest, but Dean ignored him, settling the loose fabric around his shoulders. “It’s fine, you can use it as a second layer, at least until I get cold.”
The bead curtain at the end of the pink corridor was blackening from heat alone, a wall of choking warmth greeting Dean as he burst back out into the front of the building. Through the soupy air, Dean could make out Earl’s feet behind the desk, his dingy black sneakers parted and pointing away from each other.
“Sorry,” Dean whispered. His eyes dropped down to his hands, where he held the strap of his backpack and turned the woven end over and over in his fingers, the fabric twisting and curling just like the sour feeling in his stomach. “I shouldn’t have—I’ve had a long day. I’m just gonna go. I’ll pick you up tomorrow, just text me where to go.”
had not much faded, and they were being joined by other, softer, warmer feelings that all in all were much more alarming. Castiel was thoughtful and kind, and in his own dry, irreverent way, really damn funny. He was reliable and gorgeous and had a smile like—fuck, Dean’s cheeks were warm.
“Cas?” Dean called again, the tightening sphere of horror in his core twisting and snapping. “Are you okay?”
“We could be anywhere,” Dean added. It seemed somewhat needless to say it, but at the same time, talking felt better than not.
In the army, Dean had been forced to wake early every day to set a good example to all the troops in his regiment—and that didn’t even account for the fact that the clocks in France ran an hour ahead.
Dean’s mouth had been open a moment longer than was customary, so he shoved the neck of the whiskey bottle toward it, bypassing his glass entirely in his quest to drown out the strange feeling in his chest.
“You’ve signed the waiver,” Earl was saying. “We don’t take any responsibility for anything, y’hear me—bites, scrapes, disease. Anything they do to you, you’re on your own.”
“It’s a pleasure to finally meet you, my lord,” Castiel said, bowing with his hands neatly behind his back. His voice was deep and rumbling, and Dean wanted to know if it would sound even rougher in the morning.
And now he had to work out a way to save this ship, because that meant saving Sam. And Sam was everything he had.
“Hey,” Dean said, rolling over onto his side and tapping Castiel’s shoulder, gently pushing Castiel down to lay on the bed with his back to Dean. “Why don’t you lay down like this, on your side. I can rub your shoulder blades a bit more, if you want.”
“You need help?” Dean asked, already mentally running through a packing list in the back of his mind.
Dean opened his mouth, but Michael wasn’t done, his arm raising to point after Castiel. “He is not the angel you are used to. That is not your friend, or however you think of him—that is a monster. He is
“Cas,” Dean said gently, unsure but forging forward nonetheless, “of course that’s what I would have you do. You’ve been doing a wonderful job here. I’d be a fool not to keep you on.”
Whatever had caused Castiel’s frown got swept out with the first wave they saw, his face slackening with emotion in a way that Dean felt was almost intrusive to witness.
Dean looked up; waved. Castiel raised one of the beer bottles, and Dean’s face split into a grin. Abandoning his wheelbarrow of grass chunks and dirt, he made his way toward the inn.
Not looking away, Dean lowered his own beer bottle to the table, untouched. Castiel went easily down onto the couch on his back as Dean pushed forward, crowding his space.
! I post updates there (so if a chapter is going to be late, for example, Twitter is the best place to check) and you can find links on those profiles to other places where I lurk. If you'd like updates on the last couple of chapters of this fic or the ones posting after it,
Dean rolled his eyes. This kid was getting way too damn nosy. “Because I didn’t want to, detective. That a good enough answer?”
“Hey, Dean,” Bobby called, leaning to the side to see around Castiel to the other end of the store. “What’s your number?”
“Yes, he, uh…he stopped by to let me know where to get my phone fixed. You haven’t exactly got a Batteries Plus store around here.”
Dean grinned as he noticed the phone light up again a moment later—clearly Michael had more to say, but it seemed like Castiel was ignoring him for now. The phone screen glowed through the red checked fabric of Dean’s shirt, a strange pinky light, for a moment before it dulled.
“Thank goodness,” he said, chuckling as he loosened the silk and then began rolling up the sleeves of his white dress shirt. “I didn’t want to cross any lines, but really, working from home and still having to dress up is awful.”
The merman blinked, a small jolt of shock running behind his blue eyes. Clearly, not a frequent question. Dean waited him out, determined to have an answer.
If Dean occasionally wondered what Castiel looked like, what he sounded like, if he smiled when he walked through the woodlands Dean had grown up hunting in...those were secret thoughts for him alone.
A petite, redheaded woman, an experienced Domme by the way she held herself, came up to Dean and began to dance with him. She looked vaguely familiar, but Dean had a hunch she didn’t attend munches often. The red sequins of her dress itched and scratched their way across the exposed skin of Dean’s chest as they pressed close, entwined like snakes trying to hypnotize each other. Dean was happy to dance with her, but when she leaned in and asked if he’d like more, he politely shook his head and raised his arm, giving his rainbow-coded wristbands a little wave.
He knows that Michael is making some probably-fair point about gathering enough angels to shore up Heaven and start powering their world back up before it ends, telling them his plans, but Dean’s already running.
Dean couldn’t help but laugh. Awkward, shy angels, he decided, were fucking adorable. Though knowing how hard the dude could punch, he probably wouldn’t say that to his face. “Yeah, Cas. I mean, it’s not fancy cologne or anything, but it smells pretty good to me. Just…warm, and musky, and homey. I like it.”
The terms “deaf-mute” and “deaf and dumb” are generally considered very offensive (some d/Deaf people choose to reclaim the term “deaf-mute” but unless you are part of the community, it is best left alone). Hael is simply deaf and does not speak. As easy as that.
It had cost Castiel just over two-thirds of his savings to purchase the farm. When Crowley had said he would sell it for a steal, he’d meant it. Meg had been mightily pissed when she’d awoken the next morning with a ringing hangover and discovered that Castiel had changed his whole life in a single phone call, all while she’d been sleeping off a tequila and sugar coma. Castiel had explained over breakfast at the twenty-four-hour taco shack, and Meg had told him he was utterly crazy. Well, actually, she’d told him he was nutty as a squirrel turd, but she’d supported him anyway.
Once he was cleaned, prepped, and changed, Dean stashed his bag in one of the provided lockers and checked the key at the front desk. Ready to play, Dean headed down into the club itself.
Dean held up his hands placatingly, though he couldn’t control the small eyeroll and disbelieving huff that escaped him. “And we sure won’t be, with that attitude. Has it occurred to you,
Jack only nods once, cutting through Dean’s words with a jut of his chin, before his eyes turn to Sam. “He’s here,” he says.
“My body doesn’t belong to me anymore, Dean. You paid money for it. So, by that measure, they were already yours.”
“One early morning special,” the machine chirped, more civil than Dean could ever be before his cup was empty.
“And I suppose her plumbing isn’t quite up to scratch,” Bobby mused, reaching down to pick up the tap Castiel had chosen and turning it over in his hands before reaching for the broken one, comparing them.
Baby’s hood slammed down, making her frame shudder, as Bobby shut it sharply to get Dean’s attention. Dean scowled as he rolled down the window; being rough with his pristine ‘67 Impala was no way to get him to look in the right direction.
Sam shrugged. “I think you protest too much. Besides, I checked the ~~ for the KSU Student Access Center, and there’s a picture of Cas on there. He’s insanely hot.”
that seemed so loud he wondered if Castiel heard it. “You’re going to stay—stay here,” he repeated dumbly. “You actually want me to visit you?”
Dean nodded. “Yeah. Since Lisa I’ve only ever really had one night stands here and there, and that just didn’t seem like a good idea for the first time.”
“Well, uh,” Castiel said, his eyes resting briefly on his uneaten salad. “I’ve been saving up for a long time now, and I’d actually been thinking about some ways to cut corners so that I could save even more, if I went down this route.”
“Sure,” Dean said, his tone entirely flat. “I’ll get right on that. Maybe some duct tape will fix it. You can fix anything with that shit.”
“Small town,” Claire answered, leaning forward to rest her elbows on the table before she continued, quieter. “Though Dean and me…well, when I was a teenager, I ran away from home. I was having a bad time of things. I’d just realized I was gay and my family…they struggled with it at first."
Castiel looked down at his closed laptop for a moment, his lips twisting, before he lifted his head again. “Not really,” he said.
They are adorable and I cannot WAIT to share their date at the diner with you, finally, after eleven whole chapters!
Professor Adler entered from the side door to his office, making his way across to the tiny podium in front of the whiteboard. His eyes alighted on Dean for a moment, and he merely gave him a tiny, excruciatingly polite nod before beginning to pull out his laptop and papers.
He should go. What he wanted, of course, was to talk to Dean again—have some kind of excuse to approach him and apologize for his awkwardness, see if maybe they could start afresh. But he had no good reason to interrupt Dean when he was having a good time with the adoring ladies of the staff.
“You’re awake,” Dean noted cheerfully, reaching out for the lunch Sam offered with eagerly wiggling fingers. “Figured the jet lag would have you asleep for a couple more hours.”
“Looks pretty good,” Dean said after a moment. “Won’t take that much adjusting, just a different route for the pipes to take into account the layout of the Bellbird.”
Dean woke up, stretched, and got to think about delightfully mundane things like doing a grocery run, washing a couple of the cars, maybe even laundering his bedsheets for that perfect just-washed feel atop the memory foam. Later that evening, he thought, he might head out to a bar—a safe hour or so from the bunker, of course—and hustle some pool to top-up their cash reserves a little. It wasn’t something he really needed to do these days, not between the Men of Letters’ offshore accounts and Charlie’s “gifts” from back when Dick Roman was the worst douche they’d faced. But old habits die hard, and Dean would miss the hustle if he just lived off interest as Charlie had set them up to do.
Castiel eyed him levelly, a little amusement swimming deep in his irises. “Yes, everyone. Myself included.”
Dean reached back, sliding his hand up the leather of the guy’s thigh to his crotch, teasing his fingers right past the outline of his growing cock in the fabric. Dean felt the chest behind him swell with a shuddering breath; he ground his ass back, shameless, encouraging. This was exactly what he’d come here for.
“And the feathers… Dude. I know I’m only seeing the old, damaged ones, but man, those things are impressive. The size alone, and then the color—that shimmery thing you’ve got going on? Very cool.”
“You should surprise Cas with the car tomorrow. Take it to class. I’m sure he’ll work out another way to be there in the morning, right?”
His hatred of the smell and the sandals and the hippy-ness of the place had absolutely nothing to do with an alternate 2014 and the things he’d once seen there, he told himself. Again and again.
“I—uh—yes. Yes, thank you.” Castiel sounded oddly flustered. He reached for the cup, wrapping his fingers around it, and took it from Dean with a nervous-looking nod.
Dean wondered, again, what Sam had thought was so important to tell Castiel before they'd left the bunker—but if Dean was finally learning anything, it was to take pause before he reacted. So, he'd wait, and see if Sam brought it up again. Hopefully to him, next time.
As the rest of the students filed out of the room, Castiel closed his laptop and rolled his shoulders, then touched Dean’s forearm to get his attention.
Gabriel’s voice was cold, hard, and dangerous as he looked back at Dean, but down in his strange, whiskey colored eyes, Dean could see more—could see guilt, and sorrow. “Some of us wanted to, human. But there are rules.”
What else is coming up soon, writing-wise? Well, of course, next Tuesday we'll be back to these two for their not-date-date, but I also have a one-shot fic posting in the next week for one of my lovely Patreon supporters, and there's also an update to
“You’re stubborn,” Claire said. To Castiel it felt fond, and he couldn’t help but smile back at her before she continued, “But as for Dean…have you thought of just seeing if he’s interested in helping with Bellbird on his own terms? He’s got his own reasons, believe me, for not wanting that farm to fall apart.”
“This okay?” Dean asked carefully, wanting to be sure. They were so close, stretched out together in their odd little nest, that the urge to dip his head down and press a kiss to Castiel’s neck was almost overwhelming.
Jess laughed, her freshly curled blonde hair bobbing about her head. “Come along Dean, you know we had to celebrate your return. A small card party, you simply must let me.”
“So, is this just what we’re gonna do now?” Dean asked quietly, his eyes scanning forlornly up and down the bar, searching for peanuts that would never come. “Drink until everyone is dead? Together? Here?”
“Yes,” Castiel said distractedly, flicking away at the sandy soil with tiny, swift motions. “I think...it looks like…”
Dean’s favorite time to be in the Bunker was during the downtime between their smaller cases. He enjoyed when the current Big Bad had been vanquished and they weren’t dodging any beings from higher planes who thought humans were just toys, or chess pieces, or ants. The times when it was quieter, when everything was calmer, when they weren’t running in circles…Dean really liked the bunker then. When it was busy, Dean spent his time eternally looping between his bedroom, the war room, and the library, with occasional stops for food and whiskey. It got stuff done, sure, but it was pretty dull.
“Thank you, then. Of course, I will remain, and stay working here at the house. It will be my pleasure—I’m grateful for the employment, of course, but…” Castiel’s hand rose to push nervously through his hair, creating ever more attractive disarray. “I enjoy your company very much, too.”
Dean felt his frustration build again, and it must have shown on his face, as Castiel held up a placating hand.
Hanging out with Castiel was easy and comfortable, and all that was going to change now was that Dean didn’t have to pretend that he didn’t want to kiss him.
he’d been, how powerless Castiel had been to really refuse, whether Dean had fully understood that at the time or not. Luckily, as he did with so many things, Castiel had entirely surprised Dean when he’d brought the scales out from his pocket and explained where he’d found them.
“No,” he murmurs under his breath before his head is bowed, the heels of his hands bruising into his eye sockets.
“Of course!” Castiel grinned. “I have a hunch I might want a second date, so I better do things right.”
The living room was tidy, and Dean found Castiel in the kitchen, pushed up on his muscled tail, doing the dishes.
“I needed better lighting,” Castiel said, a tiny pout on his features that Dean desperately yearned to discover the taste of.
Fresh, unfrozen beef would have been far superior, of course, but he could hardly make a fuss about that in the middle of a pandemic. Dean had been using Instacart to get his groceries delivered and it was very iffy what he’d get on any given day. They’d make it work.
Dean reminded himself—out of the museum without triggering the alarms. Luckily, Sam was a delicate and sneaky giant when precision work was required, an odd contrast to how he occasionally stumbled over his own bulk and constantly banged his head the rest of the time. Had to be something to do with the moose blood, Dean thought.
Before Castiel could respond, Dean dragged his lips across Castiel’s cheek and up to the bolt of his jaw, hot breath rebounding back from the curve of Castiel’s ear as Dean whispered, “Real slow…I want to feel every inch.”
Dean turned back to the perfect chalk circle, taking one last look at all its wave-like lines and delicate shading, before he sucked in a deep breath and whipped his arm forward.
Even with the shove Castiel gave to Dean’s foot, it took a moment for Dean to register that Castiel was speaking to him. “Hmm?”
“Only if you admit that I won,” Castiel said, grinning as he pushed himself back up off the floor. He ended up sitting between Dean’s knees, closer than should have been comfortable, but reluctant to move.
“Judge you?” Dean shook his head as he approached the somewhat transparent, blue-tinged A.I.. “Hell no, I
Castiel smiled his small smile at Dean before he turned his eyes to the road. “I did wonder if anyone had. Women tend not to buy them for men, and I wasn’t sure if any of your relationships with men had been explicitly romantic rather than just sexual.”
So, as the old junker that he was working on slowly became something resembling a vehicle again, Dean’s thoughts wandered.
For once, Sam didn’t argue. Instead, he stuck his head into the front of the car, reaching out to steady himself on the dashboard as he clambered over the seat back and into the passenger side, next to Dean.
Dean thought, knowing that his eyes were wide and eager. “I would love your cock, Sir, if you think I deserve it.”
Pulling himself back together before he drooled down his chin, Dean turned back to the bench. It was simple—a black padded bench that raised at an angle, with supports for knees and hands, providing a variety of position opportunities. As Castiel had instructed, Dean lay down the length of it so that his head was hanging down. He put his knees on the pads slightly under himself and stretched down to splay his hands on the floor, so that his ass was presented up in the air, his stomach supported by the padding and his legs slightly apart.
After waving to Eileen with a grin, Dean turned his attention back to Sam. “Yup, all ready to go. Benny woke up early to help me out, so we’re all set.”
“You’re an idiot,” Castiel said, so softly that it sounded like an endearment. “Dean, you’re so stupid.”
“Here’s your coffee!” Claire announced, spinning around to see Castiel’s fingers still on the edge of the plate. “Oh! Were you going to try one of my new cookies? Kaia’s the cook around here, she makes the best burgers in town, but I like to try sometimes.”
Dean blinked hard, his lips falling open involuntarily. For a moment, his chest buzzed with panic, thinking that he’d truly misstepped, that Castiel was going to—
Castiel stretched over to place the bottle down on the coffee table, and as he relaxed back onto the couch Dean couldn’t help but reach out. He slid two fingers along the edge of Castiel’s jaw to draw him in close and felt his gentle gasp as the space between them shrunk. Castiel was still as Dean dipped forward, sucking the beer foam from the center of his plump lower lip.
Castiel didn’t thank Dean, only blinked dully in surprise before giving him a slow nod. The plastic creaked as Castiel gripped it tightly, letting some of the liquid trickle across his dry lips before taking a few slow gulps. He grimaced but didn’t complain.
After a few minutes of basic housekeeping chat, Adler shoved a bundle of poorly printed sheets into the hands of the sleepy-looking Asian kid in the front row, and stood with his arms crossed, glaring at nothing, while they were handed around.
Rock hard and desperate for relief, Dean strained to rock his hips and press his cock into the bench.
The weather felt like it had been cooperating, up until that point—the wind quieting, the moon doing its best to beat the clouds and illuminate their faces, close together on the beach. But as a warm, building sensation filled Dean’s chest, the air began to whip around him ferociously, and the clouds rolled across the sky, leaving them only with leaping candlelight on the sand.
It sounded so good to hear, the deep, rumbling words of Castiel’s ocean bedrock voice settling somewhere far down in Dean and making themselves a home between his ribs. The move felt permanent, and Dean looked forward to all the junk that those words could help him throw out now that they lived within him.
The water was cold, typical of the Pacific Northwest in fall, but Dean was too enchanted by the luminous plankton to care. He’d be fine for a while, and he didn’t have to go far to get warmed up after.
Still gazing at Castiel, Dean got to see his head dip back before coming forward to look again, the distinctive shape of
Wrapping his hand tightly around the strap of his ratty backpack, Dean stormed out of the door. He gritted his teeth and huffed out an angry breath, just so that he could pretend to himself that the backs of his eyes weren’t prickling with tears.
And Castiel being an angel...well, that was part of the point, wasn’t it. He could handle it—better than Dean had. Those had been the unspoken words that had filled the air at the bunker as they’d completed the spell Michael had given them. Castiel might have said,
—Would you like a reward. That sentence was one that Dean had made sure to learn early on, when they’d started doing this. Duolingo was great, and Dean was pretty sure that he wouldn’t have much issue at all if he happened to be a tourist in St Petersburg who had a deep-seated need to find the nearest disco. But for day to day life, Castiel had decided that if Dean was going to put in the time to learn his language, he might as well learn words they would use more often.
Oh, the wheels tried. They rattled and bounced and picked up a surprising amount of speed on their way downhill.
It was a strange, new feeling for Dean to be proud of himself. Not that he was on a constant self-hatred bender or anything, but he just wasn’t that important. He spent as much time as he could focusing on and doing things for
Next to Dean, Sam made his way around the edge of the counter and stuck his hand out eagerly toward Castiel. Dean could see the mischievous expression on Sam’s face even if anyone else might have missed it; the way he grinned at Castiel was just a little too welcoming.
Castiel’s lips were large and pillowy, wholly commanding in their softness. He wasn’t shy with his tongue; his kisses were
“You’ve been selected for duty. The ship has malfunctioned, and your stasis egg was the second one to respond. Therefore you are currently the highest-ranking officer aboard this ship.”
“His body—because that’s not a vessel he has, not anymore—could re-materialize anywhere,” Michael had said, causing Dean’s stomach to sink. “But, the way these things tend to work is that when he’s thrown back to this plane, the very atoms of him will be drawn back to somewhere that resonates, somewhere with meaning.”
Dean squeezed Castiel’s hand firmly in content acknowledgement. “Same. I was kinda surprised, though.”
Bobbi was three, and she was adorable, but Dean had no idea how he was going to get any work done. Thank God; Sam’s plan of attack for the local Piggly Wiggly had him going after lunch when the currently soccer-less moms in beige minivans had already departed. That meant that Bobbi would only be around during Dean’s calls with Cas, not with Adler. His boss never had to know.
and captainhaterade for the various forms of alpha/beta/comma-slaying assistance they provided. Betas are the real MVPs.
hot TAs this year,” she said without an ounce of shame. “I’m going in. Don’t run away, and try to think before you speak, Clarence.”
“Uh.” Castiel didn’t seem sure. He rolled his shoulders, looking torn, as Dean slipped one of his favorite mixtapes into the tape deck.
Dean’s skepticism was written in the air by the smooth rise and fall of his eyebrow once more, but he didn’t leave, and as close as they were, Castiel could detect his low, sudden intake of breath.
Could anyone actually “have fun” in this room? Dean’s nose was adjusting, but this room smelled damper than the rest of the building put together…and
“Thriving inn, huh?” Kaia said with a wince. “You definitely didn’t get that. But you can work towards it.”
Dean grabbed an orange band—he was a submissive, looking to play, and a pink band—he was certainly looking for a guy tonight, after his encounter with Castiel at Harrington’s.
Dean gulped in a big lungful of air then slowly let it out, calming himself. Then, he began to sing.
Slowly, Dean dropped his hand from Castiel’s mouth. He pulled back and bared both his palms to Castiel, settling back onto the edge of the mattress, holding his hands up in a gesture of truce.
On Dean’s other side, Sam and Michael exchanged a worried look in his periphery, not pleased with how this was going so far.
“Deputy Assistant Director Sturgiss, actually,” Dean responded sourly, well practiced. “You holding up my agent’s investigation for a reason, Sheriff?”
“Me or the palace?” Castiel asked with a smirk, his eyes fixed on the pale, gritty dirt under his trowel.
“You’re going to unzip my pants and take out my cock,” Castiel instructed. “You’re going to take a condom from my back pocket and put it on me. Then, I’m going to fuck your mouth.”
Things got weird sometimes, too, or just...interesting. Once, while educating Castiel in the art of gunslinging and sexy hats, he learned, much to his horror, that Castiel was able to sleep with his eyes open. It wasn’t the strangest thing he’d learned about merfolk, but eyelid-closing being entirely optional was right up there, for sure.
Castiel nodded. “In the most awful of manners. A jealous paramour shot him, you see, in the middle of a party at a molly house in Whitechapel. He recovered, our good name did not.”
Well, some words. There are definitely *more* words that they need to use...and a few other things they need to do, too. But they are so, so close.
Castiel gave a somewhat disbelieving hum. “Not at all, though that’s its own fun, on occasion. But this, this beautiful, pliant submission…this is a precious gift.”
Dean couldn’t help a little huffing laugh. “Yeah. It’s very far from the most important thing, but as I can’t see what you look like without it…it helps.”
—and stumbled back to where Castiel was sprawled against the bar on his stool, sliding into the seat next to him.
Quickly dropping his phone onto the kitchen counter, Castiel grabbed a couple of hand towels from the front of the cabinets and ran them hastily under the now perfectly functional kitchen tap. “Here,” Castiel said, struggling to sound sincere. “Keep your eyes shut.”
Dean sped past the dumb, vintage-looking, ridiculously chirpy sign with its perfect family and mid-century lettering, stomping his foot down on Baby’s accelerator so that she let out a spiteful growl. He pulled his hand back in through the window; flipping off the sign was petty but, in his defense, he’d only had one coffee so far that morning.
Remember, if you simply MUST throw things at me, there's a pile of plushies and pillows available in the comment section. I bruise easily.
They’d settled for a few seconds more, another square of chocolate making its way between Dean’s lips, before Castiel spoke up again.
Dean gulped hard, swallowing down the prickles that threatened the back of his eyeballs. The welling feeling inside him was hope, and relief, and just a little bit of giddy happiness, too.
In response, Castiel reached up to his blue tie (which complimented the color of his eyes beautifully) and yanked at the knot firmly.
Smiling—wide and gummy in the way that made Dean’s heart clench—Castiel shuffled a little closer, careless of the cooling mess on their skin, and took Dean’s hand from his cheek. He turned it, pressing a long kiss into Dean’s palm, his eyelids fluttering shut as he whispered, “I love you—so much. Thank you.”
It was shining and new beneath the dirt, having been placed in the earth only a couple of hours before. God bless Benny.
Dean knew he’d have to push off the bottom and head up to the surface for breath in a second, but he was enchanted by the lights. He looked over at Castiel, wishing that he could explain how amazing this all was to a land-dwelling lump like him…but Castiel was right there, an inch away, gazing at Dean softly before he pressed their lips together.
“I dunno,” Dean said, shrugging. “Some of this stuff has been in storage since I finished college. I never got around to unpacking fully before we’d be heading off somewhere again. I didn’t have an incredibly patient college sweetheart with a working kitchen to come home to, unlike some people.”
Juggling two black coffees, honey, and the little number on a stand that would help the waitress deliver their lunch, Dean moved over to the table that he and Castiel occupied every weekend. It was near the door where the large glass front of the store gave them the most light and tucked away from most of the other tables—probably a good thing, as Dean had been told he could be loud sometimes.
With a small eye roll, Dean stepped forward. He reached for the wrench that Castiel had used to remove the pipe, spinning it in his hand so that the handle pointed upward. He leaned into the stove nook, resting his weight on the edge of the iron wood burner so that he could look up into the dark space Castiel had revealed. “It’s probably just accumulated soot,” he said, beginning to poke around with the wrench, “or a bird’s nest or something.”
Dean opened his mouth to ask…to ask a lot of things: if the kiss was okay, if he wanted to do this again, to do it every day, to do it endlessly? But he got lost in the way the wrinkles in the corners of Castiel’s eyes had deepened with joy, the way he looked so damn crinkly and
“Outdoor sex” caused a momentary pause, as they stopped to define parameters. The threat of being caught, they both said, was a whole other thing to actually being caught, so there was a cautious maybe from them both—until Dean asked whether “outdoor” included “in the car”.
The embarrassed waitress hurried away, saying something under her breath about complimentary pastries as she fled. Amused, Dean gave out a low chuckle. It wasn’t the first time that he and Castiel had been mistaken for a couple, though he had no idea why. It was at least preferable to the many, many times that people had assumed the same about him and Sam.
Dean looked across at Castiel’s thumb, sitting back on his heels next to him after inspecting the tile. “Oh, just wipe it on something,” Dean said with a shrug. “It’ll wash off.”
“Crowley,” Castiel hissed beneath his breath as he very cautiously pushed at the flaky front door, “I am going to
They parted, and Castiel pushed his way on through the crowd, dazed. He managed to elbow his way up to the door, his knuckles white around his half-empty mug of coffee. Next to the heavy glass entrance stood a stocky man in a black, knee-length coat over a dark suit and shirt, who was thumping his fist furiously against the door.
“Rushed up here to see you,” Dean said warmly. He gave up on the flashlight and tossed it up onto the beach, and let his eyes adjust to the dim light of the ring of candles behind him. As if it knew more light was needed, the moon struggled its way around the latest bank of clouds, illuminating the edges of Castiel swimming through the waves to the shore.
This was his fantasy, as near as could be—the thing that didn’t exist that he’d closed his eyes and pictured for years, the harmless fetish that filled many a lonely night in a motel or kept him company in the cold, empty bunker.
In answer, Castiel tilted his chin up and stretched his neck, sucking two of Dean’s fingers beyond his lips. His eyes fluttered shut and Dean felt him hum around his digits, hot and wet, and circle them with his tongue.
Dean turned, catching Castiel’s eyes resting on the side of his face, rather than the trees. “You’re a dork,” he muttered, shaking his head.
“Dean,” Castiel interrupted, catching Dean’s wrist as it slid from his shoulder and holding on. “Stop. This is my fault. I should have explained. I thought last night that you might know, but you just said you’d heard about certain angel habits somewhere and I allowed myself to believe that it was a coincidence. That was a mistake, I should have told you then.”
Castiel carefully made his way onward, testing every step and door like it was an accident waiting to happen. Which some of them certainly were. This place may require a little more than his Ikea skills, he was realizing.
“You should take those back to the bunker,” he’d said immediately, with a shrugging nonchalance that had settled many of Dean’s worries. “I shed plenty, and I have no purpose for them. I’m sure you and Sam can find magical uses, so you may as well build up a stash.”
Sam shook himself and shoved his hair back behind his ears. “That’s so cool,” he said, “but I’ll never get used to it.”
Let me know what you think MEG is going to find about Third Mate Gabriel Odinson. Do you think Dean is chasing pointless threads? Should he be focusing on duct-taping pipes? Let me know!
I'm already deep into the next chapter. This fic seems to just want to come out, so I see no reason to hold it back, and I'll post whenever I can.
Pausing right outside the door to the garage, Castiel blinked slowly. “The party at my brother’s fraternity house? He mentioned it in passing, yes.”
“Well, typing isn’t a problem for me in the slightest. I was just saying that it looked like we were into some of the same things, so I was asking if you were a freshman. I’ve never seen you around at any clubs or stuff.”
Dean wanted it back. The music thumped through his bones and echoed in the cavity of his chest, warming him, and the spot where Castiel’s hand had been resting felt oddly cold by comparison.
After only two steps, Dean’s shoulder blades thumped softly against a hard surface, and sound flashed through his bones. Dean grinned widely, instantly understanding that Castiel had fought through the crowd for this exact spot so that he could press Dean’s back up against the vibrating speaker, letting Dean feel every note of the throbbing music that pumped out of it.
Dean rolled his eyes; of course the asshole would make him say it. “You’re an unqualified medic with a purchased seat on this barge, and I’m the guy who used to service the vending machines and clean gum from the elevator doors. We ain’t gonna be able to do shit.”
Dean had no answer to that. Because he knew, as well as Castiel did, that if they didn’t take more extreme actions, then the answer was simply a matter of time. In lieu of words, Dean just pressed his forehead harder into Castiel’s temple, squeezing his own eyes shut.
Dean would have been understanding if Castiel seemed annoyed, or angry, or a little upset with him for stowing away on the ship as if he had a right to be there. But the response Castiel gave was, probably, the absolute worst one he could have come out with.
By the time Castiel reached the car—a Chevrolet Impala, on closer inspection—the driver had burst out from behind the wheel, leaving the door wide and creaking.
Dean knew that Castiel moved very slowly for his sake. He kicked hard, but was mostly pulled down by Castiel’s power, swimming just a few feet under. The salt stung Dean’s eyes for a moment, but he was used to it—and he wasn’t going to miss whatever Castiel wanted him to see.
Castiel nodded. “In general,” he signed, “though more specifically with men. I’ve been on a handful of dates with women, though obviously they didn’t work out for very long. But with men…”
“There are advantages to having a moose for a brother.” Charlie grinned as she showed him the screen.
“You would prefer this to the A.I. doctor,” MEG scoffed. “People always prefer the fleshies. So much internalized technophobia—”
Dean’s mouth snapped shut. Hell, he couldn’t say anything to that. Though if Castiel thought that he was the only messed up person here, he was totally wrong.
Helpless, Dean stepped up to Castiel’s front and righted his hat for him, before allowing his finger to slowly trace a running droplet of water down the side of Castiel’s face, over his strong cheekbone and down to the barest stubble that graced his jaw.
“Well, work is long over,” Castiel said. “I suppose it’s allowed. Though, I suppose that means I should also let you go.”
First of all: How are you doing this week? I can't believe that it's May already. Where I live the temperature is starting to soar (meaning that my pale, pale self will be hiding indoors now until September). I hope you're enjoying the season change where you live, whichever hemisphere that may be. Every time I see on the news how different countries are coping better or worse with Covid now, I wonder how my friends and readers from that country are faring. Here's hoping we call all see solid improvement soon, no matter where we are.
If any more warmth filled Dean’s chest, it was going to start pouring out of his ears. “No worries, Cas. Her work on your Lincoln was good, and if you’re willing to put your word behind her...that’s good enough for me. I trust you.”
As Castiel moaned throatily above, Dean grinned lazily at him, letting his tongue rest on his bottom lip.
Dean practically fell off his rock, slithering down into the water with an inelegant splash. He stood on the sandy bottom, wide-eyed, as he looked out beyond the cove’s small sand bar.
Castiel’s forehead creased, but only for a moment. “Of course you can see them, Dean,” he said, like he was explaining something obvious. “I just keep them tucked out of sight, so they don’t get in the way. In a human vessel, they can be rather cumbersome.”
Castiel’s fingers splayed on Dean’s chest, and Dean felt the scratch of stubble against his own as Castiel smiled. His hips pressed forward, morning wood pressing into the curve of Dean’s ass.
, rather than just deaf. Even so, he had to guess the odd word here and there, and he didn’t want to mess this up.
“Wait!” Castiel said, immediately mirroring the man and pushing back to his feet, accompanied by a perilous
“Did you mean it?” Castiel repeated again, his voice weaker but his fingers tighter. “What you sang—was it true?”
“Really?” A smirk tugged up one half of Castiel’s mouth, tiny but enough to reveal a peek of startlingly white teeth.
Anna looked thoughtful for a moment, but her shrug seemed genuine. “Not really,” she signed. “I am deaf but I am content. This is who I am, it’s all around me, it’s my culture.”
For a moment there was an awkward silence. Castiel filled it by draining his mug. Claire was back behind the counter, so he raised the empty cup with a smile, and she nodded in his direction.
Easily an hour later, Dean made his way over to the bar, a bit of a wobble in his knees. He leaned over it, reaching down behind it to grab a new glass as his old one had disappeared somewhere between songs.
It was a joy to dip back into this world, and I can feel the itch of a new chapter already. Thanks to EllenOfOz for picking this!
Internally, Dean made a crushed, despairing sound like the dying groan of a pitiful creature. Externally, he plastered on a smile and made a damn coffee.
Thankfully, Martha, a very Stepford older lady, had come in right on time to cover the evening shift with Andrew, the cook. Dean had given her a bear hug of glee, earning a squeak and a flap at his chest with her notepad, before tearing out of the door.
environment for a change was odd. Dean didn’t think there was much strange about it, and he ended up spending more time swimming than he ever had in his life. The swimming nights were less common than the TV nights, though. Castiel was curious about human things, fascinated with humanity in a way that, given how he’d been treated, Dean didn’t expect.
He settles on the latter and slowly lets his eyes drift back to Sam. Sam, who is frozen in understanding.
Fatback!” Dean shoved the covers back and swung his legs over the side of the bed. “I’ll get us breakfast in bed, I guess.”
all wrong, but he was also chuckling softly in a way that kinda broke every fragile hope that had been constructing a home in Dean’s heart.
As if Dean had any control of people’s spending habits when their customers were under Shelter-In-Place orders just like he was. “Of course,” Dean said, feeling his thin smile flatten even further.
Fruity things with umbrellas were so not Dean’s wheelhouse…but what the hell. It was awesome to spend time with people other than Jo who just included him, without question. One more drink wouldn’t hurt.
