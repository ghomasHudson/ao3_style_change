"I am," hissed Sherlock. He didn’t have as much practice as Mycroft, so lips did move a tiny bit, but his smile held more teeth and looked more dangerous than his brother's. "I was only going to tell our Auntie the truth."
The resident genius smiled faintly, neglecting the slide made from liver sample #3, as he mentally reviewed his doctor's evening schedule. After work, John would enter the front door, wipe his feet—twice for each foot, then hang up his coat and messenger bag. Then he'd come up the stairs and immediately find Sherlock to give him a kiss. Next, John would make a detour into the lavatory. At last, the little blond would be ready to get to work. He’d prepare the kettle while providing one to two minutes of pointless, one-sided commentary on either the weather, the crowded tube or a particularly dull incident at the clinic. (Sherlock naturally pretended that he wasn’t listening, even though John’s monologue gave Sherlock important clues about his blogger’s welfare). After switching the kettle on, John would discover that the biscuits had already been opened and pretend to be surprised that some (most) of the biscuits were missing (This is when Sherlock would finally deign to speak, claiming that the jammy dodgers had been used in an experiment, when in fact he'd eaten them instead of the nutritious sandwich, which his doctor had left for him in the plastic box labeled Sherlock's Lunch). John always shook his head over the missing biscuits and attempted to look stern (but instead he tended to smile affectionately, crinkling the corners of his eyes) as he assembled mugs, tea, milk and sugar (the sugar was for Sherlock).
John blushed again, because really, what self-respecting middle-aged man gave his penis a nickname.
“Mm hm.”
"Too bad. It was…well…it was fwightening. said John defensively. Then after a pause he added, "And sexy. Weawy, weawy sexy.”
He managed to take a breath and whisper a very hoarse, "What?"...*****
"Yes, of course, John," Sherlock quickly assented. If he couldn't cuddle John properly, at least he could let the poor man sleep. "And for the record, John…"
John poked his head out of the doorway. Sherlock smiled brightly to reward John for tacitly agreeing to make tea before turning in. Then the good doctor held up not one, but two fingers. It was a surprisingly rude gesture for John. And then the bedroom door slammed shut.
"You were enchanted? How do you know what you did when you were enchanted?" Sherlock growled.
"So we'll just stand around making small talk while our home is invaded by vampires, and John receives supernatural death threats from bloodsuckers and flying horsemen?" demanded Sherlock.
He switched on the light, and then turned back and forth, frantically looking for the radio.
"The point that I am endeavoring to make, John, is that I shouldn't be so fastidious when you are sick and vulnerable," Sherlock continued. "Just when you are most in need of comfort."
"...from a visit to Cleveland…"
"Excuse us, Mummy," said Sherlock, dragging John into the corner opposite Richard, the vampire. In the dark, candlelit room, they would be all but invisible to the relatives, who in any case, were busy eating everything in sight now that the promise of fisticuffs had vanished.
"Sorry," mumbled John, looking sad. John always looked mournful at the least hint of any separation between him and Sherlock.
Perhaps the situation wasn't bad enough to involve Mycroft directly...not yet.
Of course, this led to one conclusion, or rather to two possible conclusions, the doctor decided. Either Sherlock had a dressing gown fetish OR Sherlock was ready to breakup his own marriage to The Work to have an affair with John. Which logically made John the other woman...well, the other man, considering the fact that Little John hadn't been this hard in half a decade or more.
It was clearly hard for his doctor to think when confronted with the evidence of Sherlock's arousal. And John didn't really want to go slow anyway, not with that painful looking erection. Clearly, John was not 'not gay'.
"Well,
"Never mind the knife; it was mostly just for show. Besides I disarmed her," said John, proud of disarming a dangerous, highly paid, international assassin without spilling a drop of baby formula. The blond smiled and nodded at dark chocolate curls and razor-sharp cheek bones and the sound of a deeply rumbling voice- in other words, at the man, who John secretly loved more than the rest of the world...aside from Lizzy. John loved Lizzy and Sherlock more than anything else, and to hell with the rest of the world. He loved Lizzy like his own daughter, because she was his daughter. And he loved Sherlock like a brother because…because that's the way it had to be, although the former soldier wanted so much more. But it was fine; it was all fine. John leaned back and basked under the detective's intense scrutiny and did not pine for more.
'At least, it's all over now,' thought John. Thankfully, she hadn't even threatened to kill him or Sherlock… unless her seeming acceptance was all a ruse. John pulled nervously at his lip, wondering if she was plotting some kind of revenge after all.
"I'd have to consult with Elizabeth."
'And isn't that astonishing,' thought Sherlock with a proud smirk at his small family, 'BOTH Watsons love me. Mummy will be over the moon...and Mycroft will be so jealous.'
John startled at the sound of Sherlock's sigh.
"Mmmm, yess." moaned the chocolate covered voice of sex, "Yes, there...brilliant, John. Brilliant...My John. My brilliant John."
John moaned again, loudly, hoping that Mrs. Hudson had gone out for, for something, anything.
"Death," said John biting his lip and raising his brows. "Fionn said Death was coming to tea."
"You said all that out loud too, John," said the smugly smirking detective, who kissed John's head, then his forehead, then his temple, then his cheeks..."and it's the second to the last cigarette that I'll smoke in this flat."
"What was that, John?" Sherlock murmured.
The detective stubbed out his cigarette and then scrunched himself down, so that he could embrace his dazed, adorable doctor. (MY DOCTOR). After three orgasms, John was more than pliant, so he flopped and snuggled into Sherlock's shoulder with a contented hum and threw his arm around the taller man's waist.
Where...Surely John wasn't having second thoughts.
The detective easily cradled Elizabeth in one arm, while taking hold of his doctor's hand and leading him out the door.
"Horns…" murmured Mummy thoughtfully. "Maybe it's my sister Beatrice. She should have been here by now, and she
"He lusts after you!"
"What is your con man/boyfriend up to now?" snapped the bureaucratic brother. "Surely his tea isn't so spectacular that it merits applause."
"You have a fever."
"You know that's not allowed…"
The brothers and the sprite turned to meet Richard's dark gaze.
The detective firmly set a hand on each side of his blogger's face. He bent down and took John's lips, pressing a hard, almost bruising kiss against the ex-soldier's mouth. The taller man turned his head slightly to optimize oral contact. When John gasped, Sherlock used the doctor's parted lips to his advantage. He licked the smaller man's lower lip, then slid their lips back together into another kiss ending with a bite to his doctor's lower lip just once-not too hard, but hard enough to make sure John didn't try to back away again, (because THAT would be intolerable) Then the taller man licked over the red, swollen, nibbled lip, the lip that John always teased him with, the lip Sherlock had coveted for so long...
Sometimes, when he’s feeling particularly lonely, Sherlock spends all day in the museum.  He looks at the royal Egyptian mummies and wonders what it would be like to have his brain liquefied in his head and pulled out through his nose.  He looks at the Egyptian sarcophagi of Roman emigrants and wonders what it was about Egypt that made them want to live their lives there instead of Italy.  He looks at all the ancient pottery and tools and statues, and wonders how all this history led up to him.  He shuffles around the exhibits all day and silently wonders what it would be like to still be him, but an ancient version that prayed to gods and went to festivals and fought in battles and argued politics and married a young woman he didn’t know and lived a normal life.
John stands in the middle of the room, stock still and staring at Sherlock who can feel his eyes boring holes into his skin but doesn’t have the courage to actually look over to survey the damage.
In the shower after he wakes up.
He didn’t observe.
He walks through Postman’s Park, an old refuge of his from his days at Bart’s and wonders just how his entire life has happened.  He simultaneously feels as though he’s done nothing with his life and yet, far too much for one lifetime. He’s lost in his thoughts about his session with Ella from the previous day about his trust issues when he hears an oddly familiar voice call out to him.  He stares unknowingly for a second, thankful the man calls out that he’s Mike Stamford because it would have been extremely embarrassing to have to ask the name of your best friend from uni.
He hears Irene in John’s voice cry out her orgasm and he grabs onto her hips to help ease her through it.  She pushes herself up against his chest and twists her head to kiss him passionately  as she continues to ride his length up and down.  He caresses her tongue and tastes John on his own.  He buries his hands in Irene’s curls and feels John’s bristly hair in his grip.  He breaks the kiss so he can catch his breath and works on Irene’s neck, feeling John’s five o’clock shadow and tasting John’s sweat.  He keeps bucking wildly and his legs start to burn from the effort and all he keeps saying is “yes, John, god, yes.”
“Molly,” Sherlock objects.  “I just want to sleep.  We both do.  I’ll tell you later.”
“Right,” he says, “you feel like breakfast?”
So when Lestrade starts to notice signs in Sherlock that something is wrong, he tries his best to reason his fears away.  Sherlock has always been irritable, but lately, Lestrade is noticing even more irritation out of him.  He has horrible bags under his eyes, but maybe he’s just having more trouble than usual sleeping.  And yeah, Sherlock always speaks quickly.  But sometimes you can’t even understand what he’s saying at all.
“You don’t, Sherlock.  Who needs friends when you’ve got books and brains?  No one’s like us, they all
“No, I’m a Detective Inspector for New Scotland Yard.  And as long as you’re taking drugs, I can’t let you consult,” Lestrade says matter of factly.  “I
To make matters worse, the inn they’re staying at couldn’t do them a double room.  The idea of staying in a single room with John leaves Sherlock feeling…what is it?  Anxious?  Insecure?  Worried?  Excited?  Is there a word that conveys all of those emotions together?  If there is, Sherlock can’t think of it right now.  His mind is working too fast, what with the prospect of having to sleep in the same bed as John and also trying to gather as much information as he can about Henry’s hound.  Sherlock desperately wants a cigarette, maybe even two.  Possibly the whole pack, he can’t quite decide.  He’s just trying to remain calm and push his feelings about John out of his head.  They’re just not rational and they don’t belong there.
“Nothing good,” Sherlock mutters, more to the couch than to John.
John looks up at him again with an understanding and frustration and
John trails his hand down Sherlock’s chest and stomach to weasel down under his pajamas and wrap his fist around Sherlock’s cock.  Sherlock groans obscenely into his mouth but doesn’t stop working John’s tongue with his.
Sherlock sighs.  He doesn’t want to push John away so he turns around from his microscope.  John is buttering his toast and fiddling with the kettle to make his morning tea and doesn’t realize that Sherlock is looking at him.  Sherlock’s eyes immediately go up to John’s shoulder.
Sherlock’s eyes widen when John starts actually screaming.  His heart starts pounding wildly in his chest.  His breathing hitches and picks up.  But he stays silent.  He knows anything he says might make John libel to haul him off the couch and punch him in the mouth just to get him to shut up.
“Nothing!”
“Not you,” Sherlock shudders suddenly.  “Not you too.  You’re not supposed to be like the rest of them,” he says, hanging his head.
Sherlock ignores the idiotic CSI, God, what’s his name -- Petersen, Christiansen, Sorensen.  Whatever.
Sherlock remembers taking his findings to every homicide detective at Scotland Yard and everyone laughing him out of their offices.  Everyone except Detective Inspector Lestrade, the unit’s newest DI.  There had been something about Sherlock that Lestrade found genuine, and so he took the younger man at his word.  Lestrade reopened the investigation into the woman’s death and discovered Sherlock had been right about everything.
“‘Yes?!’”
In actuality, Sherlock’s really quite surprised to see John back in the room at all.  He figured John would have found a pretty woman to hole up with for the night and forget all about Sherlock and his juvenile confession earlier on.  If Sherlock is telling himself the truth, he almost hoped that would have been what happened and saved him the embarrassment of having to face John.  They could have been good little British boys and stiff upper lipped this and carried on like nothing happened.
As ever, thank you so much for reading and supporting my amateur creativity with your kind words. It really does mean a lot to me. From this medicated and mighty grrrl to you, darling friends, thank you. xxxxxxx
John stares at him for a moment and then bursts out laughing, eventually going back to reading the newspaper.
“Not good?”
And a fourth time.
“Okay…” John says dejectedly and turns around.  He still doesn’t understand that Sherlock’s not ignoring him to be rude; it’s just that he doesn’t want to miss anything.
John pushes himself up so that his forehead is resting against Sherlock’s.  The only sounds in the room are their breathing, ragged and laboured, and the soft noise of skin on skin.  Sherlock scrunches his eyes tight, letting out a desperate moan he didn't know was threatening to break free.  He exhales himself out and inhales John in, taking in everything he is, everything he ever will be.  Sherlock moans and he feels John huff out pridefully.  Sherlock reaches out for the first bit of John he can find, clutching onto his hip as an anchor, anything to keep him attached to this moment.
Sherlock blinks at him defiantly, like a teenager who’s being confronted by their parent after they’ve done something terrible.
“You were running?”
“Makes you need to know that you’re really alive.  Makes you need to grasp out for the nearest living thing and grip and not let go.”
“What sort of music?”  Sherlock laughs softly, amused at the sort of things that John likes to know about him.  It seems to escape Sherlock that these are normal questions people ask when they’re getting to know someone.
British sentimentality at it’s most high.  Keep calm and carry on and all that tripe.
Sherlock doesn’t know when he falls asleep and he doesn’t wake up until he hears John running the shower.  He stays in his room until he’s certain John’s left for the surgery.  He just doesn’t think he can face him.
To anyone still following this, my sincerest apologies on neglecting this story.  What with moving to London and starting postgrad school, things have been hectic and life has been happening and I'm afraid my hobbies have taken a backseat to my research.  I do promise to try to be more on top of things though.  Thanks for sticking around, you're super cool.
the British government.  Sherlock pretends he doesn’t know Mycroft has arranged for him to have access to lab supplies simply because it’s convenient for him and it keeps his boredom at bay.
,” John cries.  The pressure starts to build in his groin and a hot orb settles in his stomach and he starts to grind and rut into and fuck Irene harder.
“It’s fine, I just want to sleep on the couch.  Can I sleep on the couch?”  Sherlock pleads.
At this turn of act two, his face shifts from serious to hurt.  It’s been so long since he’s told this story to anyone that it feels almost strange to say it all out loud now.
Sherlock remembers acting cavalier in the cab and flipping the Royal Ashtray in his hands for John.  He likes that John wonders when he had the chance to lift it and how he could have ever done such a thing.  Sherlock wants to keep John aloof because he likes the way his smile looks when he is, so he doesn’t tell him that he lifted it when he was changing  into this suit.  Wasn’t that hard, really.
,” he finishes, implying something more as he flashes Frannie that conciliatory grin he flashes everyone.
“What kinds of people don’t care about anything?”  Sherlock asks more to himself than Mycroft.
Moriarty continues to giggle in the background of John’s hearing and he knows he has to do something.  He thinks fast because he knows there are snipers all over this place just wishing for one of them to do something stupid.  He knows there are at least half a dozen and he wouldn’t be able to bare it if something happened to Sherlock. And he realises, no one can stop him from opening the coat and revealing the bombs because it’s so painfully obvious that what Moriarty
So when Sherlock thought he was getting his chance to finally fight back for her, he felt just and righteous.  But then he heard Samantha scream, and he realized he was on the verge of becoming the monster that was Mr Hudson.  Sherlock begged her to forgive him, cried about how he’d never hurt her.  But Samantha couldn’t take it anymore.  She left Sherlock to save herself.  She never looked back.
Where would he even begin?
He remembers playing Peter Pan with him.  Sherlock would pretend he was Hook and Redbeard was Smee, yelling at Redbeard to protect him from the nasty crocodile every time Mycroft would come outside to order him in for a bath before dinner.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock slowly curls his hand over John’s cheek and around to his neck.  He keeps it there for a short moment, letting John feel that he’s protected and loved.  He moves to gently push the edges of John’s sweat soaked hair off his forehead and puts it back to rest again on his neck.  John’s chest feels heavy, like it might collapse under the weight of all his unspoken feelings for Sherlock, all the things that are too hard to say but so easy to feel.
Finally, it does.  Molly Hooper stands bleary eyed and annoyed at her front door, wondering what in God’s name brought Sherlock Holmes to her doorstep at such a late hour.  She considers admonishing him until she really takes in the sight of him.  His hair is a mess and his eyes are bloodshot and he’s not even wearing his Belstaff.  She waves him in without saying a word, and Sherlock follows in the same fashion.  She makes two cups of tea and sets one down in front of Sherlock, who’s already set up camp in her sitting room.
So when Lestrade starts to notice signs in Sherlock that something is wrong, he tries his best to reason his fears away.  Sherlock has always been irritable, but lately, Lestrade is noticing even more irritation out of him.  He has horrible bags under his eyes, but maybe he’s just having more trouble than usual sleeping.  And yeah, Sherlock always speaks quickly.  But sometimes you can’t even understand what he’s saying at all.
“Mum called her a freak.  She told her to get out of her house.  Never come back.”
Sherlock continues staring, John continues talking into his tea mug.
After his shower, John walks into the kitchen to make himself some toast for breakfast.  At first, Sherlock doesn’t notice him because he’s working and he’s got more important things to think about.  While he’s waiting, John leans against the kitchen counter and bites into an apple.
He counts it every night before he goes to sleep, a night time ritual to help him calm down and signal to his body that rest is on the way.
Like, the food John eats most often is beans, though he doesn’t love them.
let you.”
“See, I told you!  I’ll
by Sigur Rós with his eyes closed so he can really feel the music.  Sherlock remembers learning to keep his love for this band a secret because the boys in his accommodations at uni all called him “poof” and “faggot” when they found out.  Same names, just different boys this time.
He stares angrily at her for a few seconds before she clamps onto his mouth again.  This time, he doesn’t kiss back.  She fishes around his mouth, trying to goad his tongue to respond to hers.  But he doesn’t respond.  He doesn’t even shut his eyes.
Sherlock remembers the first time he sees John’s scar.  Mrs Hudson likes to keep the windows open in the summer and the flat is a little overheated.  Sherlock is in the kitchen working on an experiment about blood stains when John leaves the bathroom with only a towel wrapped around his waist.  For John, there’s nothing strange in this.  As a doctor, nudity doesn’t bother him; he’s trained in looking at the human body.  Likewise, as a soldier, the men in the barracks never cared too much about covering up.  Modesty never seemed like the most important thing on the menu when that menu included things like bullets, shrapnel, and bombs flying around in their general vicinity.  For John, walking around in a towel is polite.
“John,” Sherlock calls out.  He stops at the landing.  Sherlock ponders for a second, and reasons that perhaps an apology, which will cost him nothing while assuaging John’s anger, might be the best option here.  “I’m sorry,” he concedes.
John sighs, resigning himself to telling the truth.  “He told me to stay up with you.  You took his cigarette and he said that meant I had to stay with you all night.”
Sherlock hangs his head.  He doesn’t want John to see him.  He doesn’t want John to see the mess of a man he really is.  He doesn’t want John to see how lonely he’s been for as long as he’s been.  He doesn’t want John to see that he’s not as strong and stoic as he pretends to be.
“I dunno, it’s sometime this month, isn’t it?”  Sherlock returns to his food and mindlessly watching the telly.
Their father had made Mycroft and Sherlock take horse riding lessons when they were boys.  He said it would make them fine, upstanding, well rounded gentlemen.  Sherlock was always uncomfortable riding the animals because they’re bigger than he is and have minds of their own.  One day, his horse was being particularly unruly and Sherlock couldn’t control him.  The horse threw him, and Sherlock fell and broke his arm.  He remembers some of the children laughing at him because he was the only one who could never get his horse to yield to him.  He remembers Mycroft running to him because he was crying, and Mycroft yelling for someone to get a doctor or a nurse or someone, anyone!  Sherlock also remembers pushing Mycroft away nastily because he already looked weak enough in front of the other children and he didn’t need his meddling older brother adding to the embarrassment.
because he was his only friend.  But David had been very popular, he had lots of friends and would sneak out of the grounds at night and smoke cigarettes and had lots of girlfriends that lived in town.  Sherlock remembers wondering what David was doing even hanging around him at all.
Sherlock remembers it was in Karachi, after he saves The Woman from getting her head cut off.  Sherlock hasn’t fought to the death like that in, well, ever.  He’s never actually gotten to employ his fencing skills in anything, and truthfully, he’s quite nervous about the outcome of the sword fight; a foil is so much lighter than an actual sword.  But to his surprise, he also has some help.  Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Irene elbow a man in the gut, sweep up his sword, and start cutting down her captors.  Sherlock remembers this because he wasn’t trying to kill anyone, just knock them out.   Irene though, she was going for death blows.
“Why don’t you just go downstairs and chat up some woman and leave me alone,” Sherlock spits, turning his back on John.
John remembers the day he argued with Sherlock about bringing dates home.  He remembers not particularly liking the woman he went on that date with. He remembers he only brought her home in an attempt to make Sherlock jealous.
“John, please, I want you,” Sherlock pleads.
Sherlock lays back on the couch and wonders what just happened.  He doesn’t know how to process this or why John said he reminded him of his sister.  There’s no possible way he could remin--
“That I’m smarter?”  Sherlock says, perking up.
“Well, Sherlock?”
Sherlock’s heart is pounding wildly in his chest and he tries to keep his breathing calm and even so it doesn’t betray his real feelings to John and he screws his face up in an expression he’s pretty sure reads as
“I can stop anytime I want!”  Sherlock once yelled at Mycroft when he caught him preparing his next injection.  He remembers the way Mycroft looked at him, like Sherlock was something he didn’t know anymore.  He remembers that was the day their feud started.
“Don’t play dumb with me, Sherlock!   You know exactly what I’m talking about,” Lestrade tries to keep his voice calm, but he’s not being very convincing.
where the man
“I didn’t think you’d be like this,” Irene says disheartedly as she dislodges herself from Sherlock’s prick again, breaking the silence.  He comes rushing back to the present and realizes he’s been thinking so much about John that he’s starting to go soft in Irene’s mouth.  He looks down just in time to see her climb up from the floor of the car and into his lap.  He doesn’t have time to react to her mouth clasping around his, stealing all his breath.  The taste of himself on her tongue jars him enough to at least try to appreciate all the work she must have put in down there and how tired her jaw must be.
“Sherlock, anything, please.”
It was all he needed to hear.  Sherlock cries out John’s name as he comes, losing his balance and falling over on top of Irene who also comes one last time.  He holds onto her as he sees stars and replays over and over hearing John’s voice tell him what he didn’t know he desperately wanted to hear.
Lestrade bends down to look into his downcast eyes.  “I believe in you, Sherlock.”
If you've stuck with me, thank you so much.  I've been in a really shit place creatively for a while now and grad school isn't helping.  Please R&R -- even one word comments make me feel good!
John huffs behind him.  “Can’t think of a time
This chapter, as implied by the title, is all about Sherlock's drug addiction.  So please read with caution if you have any drug addiction triggers or are working through an addiction yourself.  And if you are struggling through an addiction of any kind, remember that you are so brave and so worthy of life and happiness -- and I believe in you. <3
Sherlock remembers jumping.  He wishes he didn’t.  It’s the reason he can’t sleep at night.   When he dreams, he hears John’s voice screaming his name as he’s falling.  It haunts him more than anything ever has.
Sherlock takes John’s mouth again, swiping his tongue across John’s upper lip, begging for entrance.  And so John obliges. He shifts on top of Sherlock who snakes one hand protectively to the back of John’s head and wraps his other arm possessively around John’s middle, holding him there with nowhere to go but wherever Sherlock takes him.  They stay like that for several minutes, John snogging Sherlock into the bed, Sherlock letting him do it.
A couple of days later, when the effects of whatever drug it was she slammed into him wears off, Sherlock thinks about Irene as he’s pretending to sleep.  He thinks about her body and tries not to let his hand drift down under the covers.  But then John enters his mind abruptly, just like he did when meeting Irene.  Sherlock tries to will John out of the room because Irene is naked and straddling him and he’s stroking himself in earnest.  But suddenly Irene’s across the room and it’s John who’s sitting on the couch next to him.  Irene is mumbling something to him about being a good boy and letting John do all the work and how she wants to watch.
Sherlock blinks at him several times incredulously.  No one’s ever had such faith in him before.  No one’s ever
"Have I ever told you you've got nice eyes?" John thought out loud something he would never normally say, but in their little bubble it was okay.
The kettle finished boiling and he poured the hot water in, finished making the tea then motioned for Sherlock to come sit back down in the armchairs. Once they were seated John carefully placed his cup down on the unstable coffee table, then passed Sherlocks over. John noticed Sherlocks hand shaking as he took it and a lump formed in his throat.
"No need, I'm certain you were irreversibly in love with me to begin with." Sherlock joked back somewhat reluctantly.
"I am the worlds only consulting detective after all."
"I was just thinking about having to have this conversation with you and I got upset." John joked.
"Alright alright. Moriarty said something at the pool that he shouldn't have know, couldn't have possibly known. And now that he's said it I can't stop thinking about it." Sherlock admitted, sinking further in his chair.
"We both know that's not true. You saw what I was like when you came back, I never flinched when I saw you in a room like a normal person would if they saw someone supposedly dead. It was as if I was used to seeing you there, it was as if you'd never left." John replied.
John loved the private time they shared together because it was when Sherlock was the most humane. In front of people who judged him and spoke about him when they knew he could hear he was cold and unfeeling, simply stating what needed to be said and most of the time more than was usually allowed. He never let anyone pass his walls if he could help it, not even his own brother was yet to manage to draw out the real Sherlock. But John had. John had watched him dance around the kitchen and John had sat with him when he cried and John had played cluedo and eye spy and operation and whatever little game Sherlock came up with that day. He knew how he liked his coffee and how to tell when he was upset or when he needed a distraction. He understood when he needed his own space or when he just needed someone to be in the room with him. He could tell when Sherlock needed to just stop and rest or when he needed a case to mentally keep him going. He knew all the things no one else noticed or were allowed to see and he was flattered whenever he really thought about the fact that Sherlock had allowed him to see the side of him no one else had.
"There's no scientific evidence saying I'm too good for you John, if anything it's the other way around." Sherlock replied slowly, confused as to why John was suddenly smiling.
(See the end of the chapter for
Since Sherlock had come back things were different between them, they just seemed to appreciate each other a lot more. Even Sherlock, who usually didn't care about sentimental acts or kind words, had been a lot nicer towards him and made it his job to make sure John was always okay. It was strange hearing Sherlock ask if he'd eaten lunch that day or if they needed more milk, but it didn't mean he didn't appreciate it any less. They had even become physically closer, resting their legs on each others laps in the evenings or absentmindedly brushing shoulders when walking past. Today at the office they had been standing so close that their hands had brushed, something John had awkwardly noticed but realised it didn't bother him at all. It wasn't like they hadn't help hands before, although being dragged across London in handcuffs as a runaway 'hostage' wasn't exactly how many people envisioned the situation. Sherlock hadn't seemed to notice at all, too busy listening to Lestrades briefing before excitedly taking the folder away from him and blabbering on about the circumference of Mr Bakers garden table affecting how many times his son was slammed onto it.
"But it's alright because I love you." John stated, grinning when he felt Sherlocks arm rest on his shoulder.
"Hey Sherlock?" John called from the kitchen whilst stirring the milk into his tea and absentmindedly tapping his foot.
During the film the main characters were seated inside a cinema watching an old movie together, staring into each other's eyes and slowly leaning in. John smiled as he thought about Sherlock, and had to urge to just sit up and kiss him too. Instead he turned his head and placed a kiss on Sherlocks jaw, seeing him smile out the corner of his eye. Sherlock pulled him closer despite the armrest separating their chairs, and John snuggled further into Sherlocks neck. He could feel Sherlocks breath gently blowing on his head, and wished for a moment the film would never end so they could stay like this forever.
"You're different right now, with me I mean, you're like a new person. I just find the thought comforting. I don't know how I'd survive if you spoke to me the way you do with Anderson or Donavon all the time, I think I might either punch you or run away." John said, struggling through his words and still not really understanding what his point was.
"A glance"
"Yes. At the time I was under the illusion that I didn't have one, but he proved me wrong. And now that I know he's aware of my situation I don't know how to keep it safe." Sherlock admitted reluctantly, calculating John's expression.
"Right... What if I need the loo?"
"That's something I don't think I'm quite ready to experience."
"For- for telling me to stop bring such a coward and live my life, for t-telling me to come out to you and then... l-later on telling me to do it again. For telling me how proud she was that I'd found you." Sherlock chocked, his voice breaking half way through. Tears welled in Johns eyes too as he remembered the look of pride on her face as Sherlock walked down the aisle last year.
"Yeah?" John replied, smiling at how cute Sherlock sounded when he was in a situation he didn't quite understand.
He recognised the lyrics floating on the tune as the love song from La La Land.
"City of stars, there's so much that I can't see. Who knows? I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you..." John smiled at the memory of kissing Sherlock for the first time, underneath a staircase at Scotland Yard while Greg went to fetch some case files.
"I know, I kind of googled it when I couldn't figure out what colour they were." John admitted, grinning sheepishly.
"You aren't real, you can't possibly know that," Sherlock croaked, his voice hoarse and painfully tight.
"So you mean... you don't know how to keep your heart from being broken?" John asked confused, trying to work his head around what Sherlock actually meant. Sherlock just stared at him, watching the cogs turning in John's brain.
Then John realised something. Sherlock had rolled his eyes. He had looked away. John grinned and Sherlock looked at him in guarded confusion, but then realisation dawned on his face.
"Friend..." He said softly, looking away, but John could tell there was something bothering him about the word.
"The storyline wasn't as horrendous as I thought it would be, however the ending was unjustified." He stated, making his reply sound like he was a genuine critic.
"No I'm not!"
"What gives you that idea?" He asked, his expression neutral once more. John had never known how expressive Sherlock could be until he watched him pull 10 different ones in the space of half an hour.
"Mycroft called. My mother passed away last night." Sherlock whispered, fear and sorrow now evident in his expression. John frowned immediately and pulled Sherlock in for a hug, wrapping his arms firmly around his waist and resting his chin on his shoulder. Sherlock snuggled up against him, burying his face in his neck and breathing deeply.
"Much." John whispered back, before slowly leaning in and pressing his lips against Sherlocks. They were soft and warm against his own and he softly kissed him, relieved when Sherlock timidly returned the kiss. His stomach was doing back flips but he ignored it, concentrating on moving his mouth as gently as possible. When he pulled away Sherlock followed him, their lips only disconnected for a second before Sherlock joined them again. John made a little noise of surprise but kissed him back, being less careful this time yet still gentle. He slid his tongue along sherlocks bottom lip and Sherlock breathed sharply through his noise but didn't pull away, instead pressed a little harder. Johns hand stroked sherlocks cheek softly, and sherlocks hand had somehow found it's way to the bottom of johns neck. Eventually they both pulled away from each other and John observed sherlocks expression, which seemed both equally surprised and happy.
"I meant what I said. I don't care what it is as long as you're okay." Sherlock blinked and looked down at his leg which was resting against John's.
A sob escaped his lips as he took in the blood in his best friends hair, the blood on his hands, the blood coating his clothes and skin and eyelids and mind and soul and life and he couldn't bare to be so close to the putrid smell that triggered the part of his heart that he longed to be rid of. He collapsed back against the wall, clenching his eyes shut and yanking his shaking hands through his hair.
"The song you were singing, it's a duet isn't it?" John asked, recalling Mia and Sebastian sitting side by side at the piano; Sherlock hummed in reply.
"I'll go and buy the tickets." Sherlock said with a roll of his eyes, but he was smiling down at John too. The older man gave him a peck on the cheek in thanks and went to buy some popcorn for them to share, (or for him to eat and Sherlock to refuse, but either way worked.)
"You clearly aren't fine and I'm not leaving until you tell me what's bothering you." John argued, set on getting through to Sherlock. He cared about him, more than he probably would like to admit to, and it bothered him seeing him distressed.
"John?" He asked, unsure of what he was feeling but knowing it wasn't pleasant.
"Hey, weren't you ever taught to respect your elders?" John replied, more than happy at how the mood in the room had changed from depressing to elated in just under 10 minutes.
"Detective Sherlock Holmes and partner John Watson are back solving crimes after a 2 year absense, however fans suspect it's not the only thing they've returned to doing together. Many are wondering what happens behind the closed doors of their flat in Baker Street, and whether or not their relationship goes further than just friendship. It is said they've been sighted around London looking more than happy with each others company and hardly ever seem to have anyone else joining them, suggesting a more intimate involvement with each other. Are the Baker Street duo strictly professional or is something else happening inside their personal life? Go to www.johnlock.co.uk to read the opinions of their fans." Sherlock read, commenting something unimportant about bad word structure at the end. John found he wasn't as upset as he would have been 2 years ago, however it did annoying him that people were just so nosy. So what if they went out alone? So what if they enjoyed each others company? It didn't mean they were together just because they lived in the same apartment or went out to dinner.
"Why did you have to leave me." Sherlock whispered through his tears, forgetting for a moment he was talking to himself.
"I'm still here, in your mind, I'll never really be gone as long as you make sure I stay." John replied, smiling sadly.
"So you want this friend of yours to be a lover?" John confirmed, and after a few moments Sherlock nodded reluctantly.
"You're very confident."
"You know me well."
(Btw this isn't edited so sorry for any mistakes)
"What does that even mean?"
"You're still human, so is that a yes?"
"It wasn't that sad, they still achieved their dreams."
"I got my intellect from her, she is-was incredibly smart." Sherlock said, correcting himself mid sentence and frowning deeply.
"She knew. Even if you didn't tell her she knew how thankful you were, she could read us both like a book." John said softly, letting go of Sherlocks hand to wipe his tears away. He nodded slightly and kissed johns neck.
“Yes, ohhh, fuck me like John,” she groans over and over until he finally starts to pound against her.  She yelps and grabs onto his leg for support, holding onto anything that’ll keep her anchored.  He lets her fall down onto all fours again and grabs her hips, bucking into her wildly, her voice once again fading into John’s.
“Come on, Sherlock,” she groans.  “What do you,
Sherlock’s sight catches on the skull.  His looming reminder.
But then one night after David smuggled in some cheap wine for him and Sherlock.  This wasn’t anything new, but they got pissed and Sherlock was nothing short of surprised when David kissed him on the football pitch.  Sherlock remembers he had never felt more nervous than in that moment; inexperience was never something Sherlock dealt with well.   He also remembers realizing why he’d been so jealous, as the shape of David’s lips formed over his own.
A few minutes later, Sherlock climbs back into the car and is disappointed to see that Irene, now fully clothed again, is back in the front passenger seat.  Neither one speaks a word the entire way to the safe house, and for that, Sherlock is thankful.
The air in the room is thick and palatable with awkwardness and humiliation and just a touch of anxiety.  Sherlock silently begs John to speak first because he’s pretty sure he’s lost his voice or maybe just his entire ability to talk or form words at all.  He tries to open his mouth to will all that expensive education vocabulary out of his head, but nothing comes out.  Sherlock Holmes is speechless.
“Yes, my baby brother,” Mycroft drawls.  “The

“She came home for Christmas one year.  I was 17, getting ready to start uni soon.  It was like a stranger walked into the house.  She’d cut all her hair off, she had a hoop in her nose, huge bags under her eyes from the insomnia,” he huffs.  “She looked awful,” John adds under his breath.
“No,” Sherlock says in that completely childish tone he takes when he wants to do what the person suggested but now won’t because he doesn’t want them to think he’s doing it on their orders.
“Sherlock, just come up here and we’ll talk.  I’ll get the good scotch.  The fire’s still going too.”
I'm personal friends with Persephone and Hecate. I have it on good authority that anyone who R&R's will get beaucoup bonuses in the Underworld.
The next time they go out to eat is after they’ve solved a case.  After Sherlock finishes a case is when he eats the most, almost to the point of it being unhealthy.  He finds he doesn’t realize just how hungry he is until his mind is able to calm down.  Tonight, he and John are at Angelo’s.  John watches Sherlock in wide eyed horror as he devours two starters and a main.
“But…”
“You,” John says, wiping his eyes.  “Explains so much,” he says to himself.
Sherlock continues to blink and stare angrily at the older man in silence.
“You’re awfully quiet,” Irene says after she slicks off Sherlock’s cock with a loud pop.  He grunts his disapproval at the cessation and sudden draft, but he doesn’t open his eyes or even move his head towards her.  He sits there, hands now fisted into the crevices of the seats, trying to keep his head in the moment.  At this point, he’d be sorely irritable if he didn’t come one way or another, but he just can’t get his mind to stop wandering.
But then John walks into his mind palace and Sherlock starts to pump harder.  It’s all the little things he thinks about him that makes John John.  John reading the newspaper in his robe, John laughing at crap telly with him at ridiculously late hours, John stumbling over Sherlock’s kitchen experiments because he just can’t get used to the beakers and burners laying about, John fussing over Sherlock because he hasn’t eaten in 36 hours.   John’s hand brushing Sherlock’s during dinner.  The way John’s voice sounds all fuzzy when he’s just woken up.  The way John looks at him when he’s making deductions.
He traces the outlines of John’s face and tries to memorize everything, every change in texture, every teenage scar, every wrinkle around his eyes and mouth that shows how much laughter and happiness John has let into his life.  And he can’t help himself.  Sherlock cups John’s cheek and runs his thumb back and forth along his cheekbone.  John stirs for a moment and Sherlock worries he’s woken him and what he’d say to explain what exactly he’s doing.  But all John does is lean into Sherlock’s hand and sighs contentedly.  Sherlock looks wide eyed at him, not sure how to take this until he decides that all he wants to do is savor this moment, to feel John safe and living and breathing under his touch.
Sherlock can’t tell, but John wants to run away.  He knows what Sherlock’s looking at, knows that he’s studying it and deducing his wound on the spot.  John tolerates it most times, but right now he can’t stand being Sherlock’s test subject.  He feels like a caged monkey being studied by scientists.  It’s one of those times when John wishes Sherlock would speak his thoughts instead of internalizing them.  He wishes Sherlock wouldn’t internalize what he thinks of him.
After his third cup of coffee.
why I can’t sleep in this bed with you!”
They don’t talk for the rest of the night.  Instead they spend hours exploring each other’s bodies and kissing and fucking and feeling alive.  Sherlock memorizes all the peaks and valleys of John’s body and touches his scar, that beautiful, ugly, wretched, breathtaking scar, for the first time.  John touches Sherlock in places he hasn’t been touched lovingly in years and reduces the arrogant sod to nothing more than a moaning puddle.  And Sherlock doesn’t mind; he can’t remember the last time he felt so...happy, he guesses is the word.  Sherlock can’t remember ever having been happy.
Thank you so much for reading, and thank you so much for being you.
It took him ages to find out it’d actually worked.
“Go to sleep, John.  I don’t need you to babysit me because I smoked a fag,” Sherlock says cavalierly as he tries moving past John to go to his room.  John blocks him with his arm.
“But how do I get them to be my friends?”  Sherlock yells back.
Sherlock shakes himself free of Mycroft’s hold because even in his own head he’s never far from his reach.  He turns back to look at John still talking to the innkeeper and knows what he has to do.  He goes into the room marked SENTIMENT and shoves all his ridiculous nonsense thoughts about John in there and slams it shut.
“Nothing, I just wasn’t expecting that.  Did you wear flannel and combat boots and worship Kurt Cobain?”  John teases, digging back into his noodles.
“What’s so funny?”  Sherlock calls, still standing on the coffee table.
Sherlock is something unworthy of love.  Sherlock is something unworthy of affection.  He knows this already, he’s known it for a long time.  This is why he constantly pushes people away.  This is why he never lets anyone near.  Because it’s easier to be alone, it’s easier to live without the hope of someone returning all the love he actually is capable of feeling.  Maybe he’s not a sociopath after all.  Maybe it’s just easier to pretend he is than to really have to connect with anyone and have them end up leaving.  It’s just less messy this way.
, he reasons in his head,
“How…how do I…”  He doesn’t like being this vulnerable.  He feels weak and powerless.  He just wants to run and never look back.  It’s only a matter of time before Lestrade turns into all the rest of them with their “weirdos” and “freaks” and “piss offs.”  It’s only a matter of time.
“NO!”  Sherlock shouts like a petulant child.  John turns around stunned.  He’s heard Sherlock yell before, but never like this, never like a toddler who’s about to throw a tantrum.
Sherlock remembers that first night back in Baker Street after Dartmoor.  John seems to be pretending that what happened the night before hadn’t actually happened at all.  It’s as though everything is perfectly normal between the two of them.  John goes straight into the bathroom for a shower, and then immediately up to his room and shuts the door quietly behind him.  Sherlock turns on the telly and makes himself a cup of tea, accidentally on purpose adding too much sugar to it, and pretends to pay attention to
“SHERLOCK!”
“You don’t like my violin?  I asked you how you felt about it before we moved in together,” he says annoyed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t stop,” Sherlock whispers harshly.  “Please.  Don’t stop.”
Molly goes into her closet and pulls out her warmest blanket and a pillow.  She wraps the blanket around Sherlock’s shoulders, kneels in front of him, and asks one last time, “What’s wrong?”
“This is a turn-up, isn’t it, Sherlock?”  John hates this, hates this man, and even hates himself right now.  Because he knows what Sherlock thinks is that John himself is this mysterious Moriarty, that he’s played him for a fool, and that he was laughing at him the entire time he was pretending to be his friend.  He knows Sherlock is spiralling head first into a chasm of doubt and betrayal, and John absolutely hates himself for letting this happen.
“Sherlock, why is the toaster smoking?!”
Sherlock slams the skull down and sits on the nearby stool.  He hangs his head and runs his fingers through his curls in an anxious rush.  He does this for longer than he realizes while he calms his breathing.  He shakes out the horrible thoughts that it could just as easily be him on the slab, nothing but bones and needle marks, and this man standing over him, looking at him wondering who it is that’s most affected by his death.  He can’t shake the desire to just know what his name was.  He looks back at the skull staring at him, empty, hollow, void.  In the recesses of his mind, he hears a young Mycroft say Billy.  He hasn’t thought about that in years.
Talking to Moriarty, Sherlock tries to pretend to seem uncaring and cavalier, like he can’t be bothered with Moriarty’s threats, or to even be pointing a gun at him.  He remembers Moriarty telling him he’d burn his heart out and retorting that he, in fact, did not have one.
Lestrade, looking impressed, says to Andersen, “That’s why I let him in here.”
After that, Lestrade always called on Sherlock when a case proved too difficult or strange.  He also referred people in need of a private detective to Sherlock.  Both men won: Sherlock, not wanting it in the first place, let Lestrade take credit for all the crimes he solved, and Sherlock could support himself with the extra wages he earned from his referred clients.  They kept on like that for months, and even though some people on Lestrade’s team found Sherlock to be supremely annoying, Lestrade grew accustomed to having Sherlock around.
“No,” he says simply.  He doesn’t know why he said he did.
“Oh…”
Sherlock groans loudly as he finishes.  He sees stars and clasps his free hand over his mouth so that John won’t come running in thinking he’s in trouble.  He stares at the ceiling, trying not to think about what just happened in his mind palace.  He stays like that until his eyes get too heavy and he falls asleep.
“Who were your favorites?”  John asks Sherlock and he says it in a way that makes Sherlock think he actually does want to know.  John might have made fun of him, but it wasn’t meant to be cruel, and Sherlock knows this.  Sherlock understands now that he can talk to John about his childhood and not be made fun of.
Like, if John can, he likes taking showers in the afternoon after he’s fully awake.
John remembers this moment well.  He remembers it was the moment he knew he was meant for Sherlock Holmes.
He repeats in his mind like a mantra, an added measure to protect against the nightmares.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.
Sherlock remembers when he took that skull.  It wasn’t long after he got the job at Bart’s five years ago as a clinical chemist, which was nice because they let him come in whenever he wanted and stay as long as he liked, just as long as he met deadlines.  He was also allowed use of lab supplies for experiments as long as they weren’t too extravagant or expensive.  Sherlock always thought this was strange since Bart’s is funded by the British government until he remembered that Mycroft is the British government.  Sherlock pretends he doesn’t know Mycroft has arranged for him to have access to lab supplies simply because it’s convenient for him and it keeps his boredom at bay.
“I’m not gonna break, John,” Sherlock says.  “Come on, move.” John stretches back so he can see Sherlock shatter when he pulls out completely and then slams back into him.  Sherlock arches off the bed and screws his eyes tight shut and lets a guttural noise escape him deep from the back of this throat.
“Sherlock, you’re not alone.  I’ll help you.”  Sherlock finally looks up at him uncertainly.
Someone knocks into the wall and they both laugh louder.  John shushes them, but they don’t really quiet down.  Sherlock can tell by the sound of John’s laughter that he’s had a few too many pints down the pub.  He hears the two of them start kissing and freezes.
“Oh,” John says in a small voice.
John remembers clapping eyes on Sherlock Holmes for the first time.  He appears as a contradiction with his unkempt, boyish curls paired with his tailored suit.  He’s aloof, completely uninterested in his surroundings, but he’s able to infer complex and hidden details with a single glance.  He remembers the very first thing Sherlock ever said to him was “Afghanistan or Iraq” and not understanding what was going on at all.  He glances over to Mike quizzically as Mike assures him he didn’t mention one word of this impromptu meeting with Sherlock. There’s just no way that man who, up until this very moment in time, didn’t know John even existed could possibly know he’d been a soldier in the Middle East.  There’s just no way.
“Anything,  everything,” he answers with another eye roll and hand flourish.  “Pick something.”
Sherlock doesn’t look up from his microscope.  He’s examining a dish of blood and doesn’t want to miss the reaction it has to potassium chlorate.
“You gonna eat that?”  Sherlock asks as he motions to John’s plate of half eaten pasta with his head.
John nuzzles Sherlock’s nose with his own and peppers Sherlock’s cheeks and eyes with too-sweet kisses.  He rests his forehead against Sherlock’s and continues to breathe.
Sherlock didn’t care though, only because David didn’t seem to care.  They kept on being mates, kept on not caring.  They smoked pot together and listened to music together and waxed philosophical about life together.  And Sherlock watched David get more and more popular and shag more and more girls and felt more and more jealous, though he couldn’t figure out why.
“I don’t want to hide from you anymore,” Sherlock whispers, raising his head to John, showing him the tears that threaten to spill out of his eyes.
“You’re not coming with?”  She asks innocently.  After a short moment, Sherlock turns his head towards her without meeting her gaze.
in the living room and sips his scotch on the couch and pretends not to notice John listening to him sing quietly from the kitchen.
John clears his throat and says in a strained voice, “I’ll be back in a little bit, I need to think.”
Sherlock peeks out from behind him to survey John.  He looks him up and down and quickly buries his head back into the couch cushions.
“His wife?”  The annoying CSI officer croaks.
Lestrade is furious, both with Sherlock and himself.  If he’d just said something sooner, this wouldn’t be happening.  If Sherlock had never started taking the drugs in the first place, this wouldn’t have happened at all.
By the time Sherlock strolls downstairs, he sees John’s ordered a full breakfast for him.  He even put the raspberry jam on his toast, just the way Sherlock likes.
he’s not the girl’s father.
But then Sherlock had discovered that wonderful thing cocaine and he loved how he could stay awake for days and work and not have to eat a single thing.  Sure, sometimes he’d scream.  Sure, sometimes he’d throw things around.  Sure, he wanted sex much more frequently.  She tolerated it because she loved him even though it scared her.
Mycroft lowers himself to stare into the eyes of eight year old Sherlock.  Sherlock tries to seem brave by staring back.
Sherlock glances at him over his shoulder.  John is leaned back with his arms crossed over his chest; one half of his mouth is upturned in a crooked smile, but he’s not really happy.  Amused is more like it.  He’s squinting his eyes that way he does when Sherlock’s said something wrong, but his smile isn’t one of those he smiles when he’s really frustrated or angry.  Like that smile John shot him when he had to correct Sherlock’s definition of a date or that time Sherlock made John travel across London to send a text from his own mobile.  This one’s more like that time Sherlock told John he was married to his work or the time Sherlock twirled him around to make him remember the Chinese graffiti.  He’s not mad or disappointed or irritated; he’s eager, astonished, like that first night in the cab.
A few moments later, he feels Sherlock’s hand snake into his hair and he shushes him like you do a baby who won’t fall asleep.  And though John starts at the touch, he doesn’t pull away. Sherlock continues to thread his fingers through John’s short hair, tells him “it’s ok now, I’m right here, you’re home and I’m here with you,” and lays another hand on his back to draw circles on it because he knows how much John loves it.
Sherlock responds.
Sherlock doesn’t stop him as he quickly leaves the room.  He stands there, stunned and not quite sure what’s just happened for several moments.  He slowly turns and stoically climbs into the bed.  It smells like John.  It smells like tea and jam and latex doctors gloves and sunlight.  Sherlock closes his eyes and feels a dead weight settle right on top of his heart.  He inhales John’s sunlight scent and wonders if things can ever be the same.
Sherlock goes to his mind palace where all his knowledge of chemistry is.  Chemicals and pheromones; dopamine and serotonin and testosterone and anything else he can think of to keep himself as rational as possible during this completely base act.
“You know why,” Sherlock whispers brokenly.
“Hey!”  Sherlock yells and flashes him an offended look.  The Spice Girls he does remember, but he doesn’t tell John it’s because he used to have a crush on Scary.  One thing at a time.
“Put your clothes on,” he spits at her, throwing her clothes at her while simultaneously gathering his own.  He throws himself out of the car to dress, wanting a moment to just be by himself to think about what’s happened.  As freely as he’d imagined Irene as John, as freely as he’d commanded her to speak in his voice, that was how humiliated and remorseful he felt now.  Sherlock is no stranger to feeling ashamed of himself, it’s what drives him to be as awful and hateful as he is to everyone.  But this, this is a new kind of shame, like he’s just done something that’s deserving of real, severe punishment.  Like he’s betrayed the one person he loves.  That he’d admitted he’s truly loved John all along, but did it while fucking another person.  This is the shame that settles in the pit of his stomach and grows roots up through his chest.  There’s no way John could ever love something as wretched as him, not now.
Just like Sherlock was before, Lestrade is now silent, waiting for Sherlock to do or say something of actual value.  The two stare at each other for a long second before Sherlock turns on his heels towards the door.
Like, John’s started working out so he can keep up with Sherlock when he starts running all over the city.
And so he does.  Slowly, he sinks himself into the warmth of Sherlock’s body and settles there until Sherlock tells him to move.  He breaks the kiss, resting his head against Sherlock’s forehead and gets used to how fucking tight he is and breathes raggedly.
brother,” Sherlock strains, with an equally implying tone.  “The diplomat.”  They glare at each other for a few moments, like they’re trying to stare bullet holes into the other.  But their mother swats them affectionately with the newspaper and reminds them that they’re brothers and to behave.  They both cross their arms, Mycroft to try to hide his body and Sherlock to get his arms to stop aching with cravings.
.  He stares at John, and John stares back.
In the background, Sherlock hears the irritating man yell, “He touched the body?!”
“Friends?”  Mycroft laughs heartily, “Whatever would I need
“What, I can’t just think you’re ace?” Sherlock remembers David asking him one day as he helped Sherlock collect the books that had been smacked out of his hands.  Sherlock remembers giving David a funny look, which David laughed at and then ushered Sherlock up to his room to listen to music and make fun of all their instructors.
He falls asleep to Sherlock’s tangled legs in his and him tracing the scar tissue of his bullet wound on his shoulder.  The next morning, he wakes up to the same thing.
And Sherlock can’t help but find it incredibly ironic that he should not only fall in love, but fall in love with someone who’s spent
“You know, one thing led to another and Harry starts yelling. I still don’t have any idea how it all happened, just yelling how she always knew they hated her, how she was different, that she’s accepted it so why can’t they?”  John sounds like he’s recounting a boring movie he once saw for all the emotion he’s putting into telling this story.
.[Author’s | Note].
Without realizing it, Sherlock’s hand drifts under the covers.  He closes his eyes as he grips himself tight.  He hasn’t had to do this in a while, but now that he’s started he can’t convince himself to stop.
He chooses the latter.
“It is real,” Sherlock says flatly, not looking away from the screen.
“Of course there’s no milk!  There’s a tongue and 6 thumbs in our fridge, but GOD FORBID we have milk for the bloody tea!
“What ya workin’ on today?”  John asks, trying to sound interested.  He's actually really not interested in Sherlock's experiment though, he's just trying to be friendly.  At this point, John doesn’t fully understand that Sherlock likes being left alone when he’s working.  John doesn’t fully understand that people don’t always need to be talking to one another.  John doesn’t understand that it’s irrelevant to discuss what he’s working on, it’s only relevant to discuss the results.
And eventually his breathing calms and he stops shivering so hard and he opens his eyes.  He turns around to see Sherlock, eyes heavy with sleep but face drenched in concern. Sherlock lays back down facing John who still hasn’t spoken.
“I’m fine.”
“Well?  Don’t have anything to say now,
“There’s also pamphlets in his pocket, some clean, some marked up with hate speech.  This neighborhood is littered with white supremacists, a leading member lives right down the street, I think.  You might find it useful to question every man on this street, you’re likely to find your murderer quite easily,” Sherlock concludes, walking out of the room.
“I know what you’re doing,” she coos into his ear, licking the outline of it.  Sherlock doesn’t say anything; his hands are still lodged into the seat cushions.
“Yes, Mummy’s
The shame immediately takes hold and he quickly dislodges from her.  She whimpers from the loss of body heat and the final movement of his prick inside her.  Sherlock moves as far towards the opposite side of the car as he can, as if he can hide from her in this tiny, cramped space.  The smell of sex and their sweat intertwined makes Sherlock’s stomach turn and he thinks for a very real minute he might actually be sick.  Irene continues to laugh and offer him backhanded praises.
John doesn’t speak on the way home.  Sherlock wants to say something while they’re in the back of Lestrade’s car, but he doesn’t know what to say or where to start.  John had offered to die for him, offered to die with him.  How do you thank someone for that?  How do you tell them what that means to you?  How do you tell someone what
Sherlock remembers going to Buckingham Palace in only his bed sheet.  He remembers being embarrassed that John could tell he wasn’t wearing pants, but tries his hardest to hide it.  Instead, Sherlock focuses on embarrassing Mycroft as much as he can in front of his royal official friend.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Like what?”  John still hasn’t moved his arm.
“I’m 35,” he blurts out.  Sherlock turns around to raise an eyebrow at him.
“Oh, you won’t allow it?”  Sherlock sneers.  “Who do you think you are, Mycroft?”
,” John whimpers.  The pressure gets heavier and heavier and Sherlock is so close he can hardly stand it.
, he thinks.
John lets out the trembling breath he’s been keeping in for far too long as he takes a long gulp on the scotch before setting it down on his nightstand.  He doesn’t know what to do with himself and paces between his door and the wall just opposite it, standing against the two intermittently because he just can’t be still.  After several minutes of this, he finally decides to sit on the edge of his bed, taking another gulp of the scotch, and cradles his head in his hands. He feels the burn of the scotch slide down his throat and fight away the panic attack that’s been growing inside his stomach ever since he left the flat earlier in the evening.  He hasn’t had one in a while. He was doing so well.
Sherlock lets out a shaky breath and feels the tears well in his eyes.
“I’d love not to see Mrs Hudson’s face the morning after.”
Sherlock looks away to survey John.
Sherlock remembers the first time John ever really talks about his sister.  Harry is three years older than him but you’d never know it from all the coddling John’s done with her.  John likes to pretend that he doesn’t get on with his sister because it’s less painful for him that way.  It hurts so much more to admit that he wants to be close with Harry, wants it to be like it was when they were kids, but that it just can’t be while Harry’s still drinking.
“John….” Sherlock whines in a hushed tone, but doesn’t get a chance to finish before John moves down his body to work his pajama bottoms off him.  John looks up at Sherlock from the foot of the bed, giving him a knowing glance, and Sherlock lifts his hips off the bed to help John with removing his clothing.  Then John hastily removes his own and clambers awkwardly into Sherlock’s side table for their bottle of lube.
John concentrates on Sherlock, sensing his vulnerability, and is taken back to his time in the army.  He’s seen this so many times.  Too many times.  John lowers his arm finally.
“Yes, his wife,” Sherlock says, brandishing a picture of the couple at their traditional Hindu ceremony and handing it to Lestrade.
Sherlock can’t look at him.  Instead he stares at anything else.  He sucks his lower lip into his mouth and bites down hard.  He supposes he looks angry, embarrassed, shy.  He still doesn’t look at John when he jerks his head up and down erratically to signal that
A week after John moves in, Sherlock begins to notice things.
“Well?  You coming then?”  John asks.
Sherlock wastes no time, he slides into Irene’s hot, dripping center and sees stars again.  He moans unapologetically for the first time and falls onto Irene’s back as he gets used to the feeling of being wrapped around something as tight and firm as Irene’s pussy.  She braces herself with her hand against the armrest and pushes back against him, moaning
Sherlock sighs behind the microscope because John is annoying him with his annoying conversation about annoying things.  But he can feel John staring at him; he knows John’s not leaving it alone.
Sherlock stares back and breathes.
Secretly, Sherlock loves that John was shot.  Secretly, he’s thankful for it.  Secretly, Sherlock tells himself that it’s what brought John to him.
“I know it’s not ideal, two grown men in one bed, but you have got to sleep.”
“Tell..tell m--
Again, Sherlock throws him a confused look as he says, “No, she yelled at me constantly about not standing on her tables.  She bought them all at auctions an--”
?” John thinks to himself amidst the flurry of deductions and insults to the woman who just walked in the room.  He’s disoriented and even a little offended if he’s honest with himself. But if he’s going to continue to be honest with himself, he might as well admit that Sherlock’s attempts to preemptively push him away are not working.  Because as long as he’s being honest, there’s something about this man that is so pleasantly strange and unpredictable. As long as he’s being honest with himself, he’s absolutely captivated by this man.
"Yes you are." John stated.
"You're cheating."
"What are you thinking about?" The brunette asked.
"We already have." Sherlock stated, which was true as John had sought out his friends eyes as soon as he could see them. Now that he knew they'd started he was nervous and unable to explain why. Sherlocks eyes were beautiful really, sparkling blue mixed with emerald green and a hint of gold in the centre. But it was the way he looked at him that always encaptured his attention, as if he were the most interesting subject in the world. For someone who saw as much as Sherlock did being interesting to him was something John considered an achievement.
"That was one time."
"I didn't."
"Light blue and a little dark blue... but with bits of green in the middle and gold in one. Basically just every eye colour mixed together." John described, feeling slightly embarrassed but not knowing why.
"What colour are they now?" Sherlock asked, a hint of something unknown in his eyes.
"Okay..." Now he was stuck, having hit a dead end. If he didn't known the person it would have been easier as it meant it was someone from Sherlocks past, but if he knew them well then who could it possibly be?
"You like music, you play the violin." John reasoned.
"I knew you liked the film." John teased softly, smiling as Sherlock rolled his eyes.
"Young enough." John reasoned, pressing closer to Sherlock still. After a few comfortable minutes of silence he suddenly felt a wetness on his shoulder and realised Sherlock was crying. At first they were little tears, but they soon turned into sobs that shook his body and hurt John just as much.
"Erm, John?" Said Sherlock quietly from behind him, not having moved an inch from his position.
"What do you want?" Sherlock asked, subconsciously moving his head closer to John's hand.
When he opened his eyes again there was only one John in the alleyway, but Sherlock knew better than to believe the other one was gone. A small part of him wanted the not-John to stay, the rational part of his brain overwhelmed by the side of him yearning to hear his voice one last time. If an illusion of his best friend was the only way to do this, then so be it.
"Perhaps I should take you to dinner to apologise?" Sherlock said smoothly, but there was still a hint of awkwardness proving how nervous he really was.
"So I was right about all of it?" John asked, surprised and slightly proud of himself despite the situation.
"It's love, yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else" Sherlock sang, stepping towards John with a grin.
"Because I care about you a hell of a lot more than I should." John answered honestly, smiling slightly.
"I thought about what he said, about how he's going to burn out my heart. I realised what he meant because there's ever only been one person I've wanted to give it to." Sherlock whispered, looking away from John again. John processed his words for a moment and realised how happy it actually made him to hear Sherlock say that. It was one thing figuring it out, but something entirely different hearing him admit it.
He debated just standing there and listening to Sherlock sing all night, but if he was caught he might be considered a little strange for lurking in the doorway. So instead he walked out into the living room and made his presence known by sounding his footsteps on the wooden floor, noticing how Sherlocks back tensed and he immediately stopped singing and playing. There were a few tense seconds whilst Sherlock stood frozen, not knowing how to handle the situation he probably deemed embarrassing. He soon came back to himself and continued his violin playing, even when John wrapped his arms around Sherlocks waist and rest his head between his shoulder blades it continued to produce beautiful sounds. Eventually the piece came to an end and Sherlocks arms relaxed, his bow hanging limply beside him.
"What's on your mind?" John asked, finally getting somewhere.
"That doesn't count." Sherlock said quickly, his eyes widening at the idea of losing over something so tiny.
“Hmm?” Sherlock says through a mouth full of chips.
John sighs again and sloppily folds the newspaper back up.
John laughs again and rubs his eyes.  “Yeah, yeah I s’pose she has been a lot…” he says trailing off.  They don’t really talk for the rest of the night, just comments here and there about whatever programme is on.  Sherlock on the floor, John on the couch, John’s leg nearly touching Sherlock’s arm all night.  Sherlock hasn’t sat this close to another human being for this long in years.
Sherlock remembers the day he finally realizes he has more than just friendly feelings for John.  Sherlock doesn’t want to call it love because he’s not exactly sure what being in love is.  Is love thinking about the other person day and night?   Is love wondering what they’re doing when you’re not with them?  Is love wanting them to be happy?  Is love wanting them to be safe?  Is love when your mind refuses to let them go?  If it is, Sherlock supposes that he does love John, because all of these things apply to him.
wasn’t all it was cracked up to be.  Sherlock remembers coming home for Christmas holiday and telling Mummy how sad he was that everyone was so mean to him.
Sherlock strains his eyes now because his adrenaline is still pumping and he doesn’t want Irene to notice the throbbing erection that popped up against his will the second she touched him.  He needs to pay attention because he can barely see where he’s going and the safe house is still at least 20 minutes away.  Sherlock starts running through various scenarios in order to calm down his severely neglected libido.
“Hey,” John says sweetly, “you ok?”
Sherlock turns to face the back of the couch and smiles to himself.  John picks up the newspaper and sighs.  He wants to read but can’t find the interest.
When he can’t take it anymore, he sulks into his room.  Sherlock collapses on the bed, burying his face in his pillows, and tries to keep his emotions locked away in his mind palace.  But he can feel them boiling to the surface anyway.  He’s afraid that John was right and now everything is changed.  He’s afraid that John will forsake him.  He’s afraid John will move out and leave him here all alone.  Just as the sting of tears start to burn his eyes, he hears the door open behind him.  He turns around to see John, his hand still on the knob and shutting the door softly after him,  a sad but somehow hopeful look on his face.
“Sherlock,” she croaks frustratedly, “Obviously something has happened and it’s ok, but you can’t just bang on my door at quarter to one in the morning and not expect to give me some kind of an explanation.”
“I’ve been told on many occasions it’s bad to talk about people’s ages,” he says simply as he continues to shove his food around on his plate.  Sherlock remembers lots of afternoon teas with Mummy and her indignant friends, always trying to look younger when it just made them look older.  He learned how to deduce age from all those afternoons with Mummy’s desperate friends.
” John whines.  He bucks into her and she cries out in joyful agony.
entire life dealing with the same bullshit Sherlock metes out on a daily basis.  He can’t help but find it ironic that the confrontation of the pain he’s caused should be in the form of John Watson, the funniest and kindest and warmest and most caring, forgiving, brilliant human being he’s ever known.
“Oh, for God’s sake, do I really have to spell
comes on.  He remembers because it’s the first time he thinks he might not have to hide who he is from John anymore.
Sherlock is lost in the notes and Jónsi’s voice, so he doesn’t notice when John comes upstairs from Mrs Hudson’s flat.  He doesn’t notice John sets a scotch down on the coffee table for him.  He doesn’t notice when John sits down in his chair and listens to the music with him.  He doesn’t notice that John watches him for the rest of the night.
“I do know how to make tea, John, yes!”
Sherlock pulls out his phone, hastily punching the keys on his mobile.
“What?”  Sherlock snaps.
“But we both know that’s not quite true,” Sherlock remembers Moriarty cooing at him.  He remembers Moriarty narrowing his eyes at him.  He remembers thinking he should know what he means.
In actuality, Sherlock’s really quite surprised to see John back in the room at all.  He figured John would have found a pretty woman to hole up with for the night and forget all about Sherlock and his juvenile confession earlier on.  If Sherlock is telling himself the truth, he almost hoped that would have been what happened and saved him the embarrassment of having to face John.  They could have been good little British boys and stiff upper lipped this and carried on like nothing happened.
,” John chants.  “
“Because your sister won’t stop bloody texting you.”
without me!”  He howls in Lestrade’s face.  “
When they arrive 20 minutes later, Sherlock doesn’t even bother putting the car in park.  He stops the car gently and waits for Irene to get the hint that she’s going on alone.
It’s been over a year and John still has the £4.97 in his pocket.  Once he forgot it when he was late to meet Greg to watch a football match and he nearly had a panic attack on the tube.  The weight from the coins gives him comfort, a lasting reminder of Sherlock to stay with him always.
“John…” Sherlock whispers like it’s a holy word.  He wants to say it, it’s begging to come out.
“You.  Tell me.  What.  You.  Mean.”  John stresses the words and points a short, stocky finger in Sherlock’s face.
,” she moans, catching her off guard.  “What do yo--you want me to say?”  She chokes.
“I dropped butter inside it last night.”
“You know, I think that was the worst day of my life,” John says solemnly after a lengthy pause.  “And I’ve been to war,” he adds dryly.
, but surely England has a king, doesn’t it?  He can’t really be bothered to remember these things.
“You’re not a freak, Sherlock.”
(See the end of the chapter for
to sleep in the bed with you,” Sherlock rattles hastily, hoping that was enough to satisfy John’s curiosity and they can go back to sitting reticently in each others’ presence and not mentioning their feelings or hopes or desires or wants or
“Mycroft, do you have any friends at Oxford?”  Sherlock asks as a way of announcing himself.  Mycroft throws a look of disdain at Sherlock over his shoulder.
“What’s going on?”  Molly questions in a sleep-soaked voice.  She blows on her chamomile and waits for a response.  Sherlock sits quietly with his eyes closed.
“No, Molly.  It’s  fine,” Sherlock starts.  “I don’t want your bed, I just…” he trails off.  He sighs and holds his arms tighter to his chest to keep what little warmth he has still in him.
“Dear me, Mr Holmes,” she says, fixing her hair and wiping the beads of sweat from her forehead.  “I have to say, that was 10 times better than I ever imagined it would be.”  Sherlock lets her continue uninterrupted, lost in his guilty thoughts.
“The toaster is smoking, why is that?  It was fine yesterday and now it’s not.”
John can feel Sherlock soften at this.  It’s something he never thought he’d experience.
“You think your conviction rate will stay anywhere near what it is now without me
do you insist on doing that?”
Sometimes Sherlock looks at John and all he feels is empty on the inside.  There are times when Sherlock thinks John could return his feelings.  And other times, Sherlock knows he can’t.  But at all times, Sherlock wonders where these feelings came from and how he was even able to develop them in the first place.  Regardless of his functioning, Sherlock is still a sociopath.  And sociopaths don’t have feelings.
happy boy with--”
“SHERLOCK!”
John wants to tell Sherlock he wants to stay here in this moment forever, that he never wants to leave this bed or this room or this house ever again and just stay here with Sherlock’s warmth wrapped all around him.  John wants to tell him that he’s never felt this way before, not with anyone, not ever. He’s never felt this safe and wanted and alive. He wants to tell Sherlock how much he means to him, how much he needs him, how much he aches for his touch after a long day at the surgery, how much he thinks about him when he’s out with his mates and Sherlock won’t come with, how much he loves him.  He wants to tell Sherlock he thinks he’s in love with him but the words stick like molasses in his throat.
Sherlock’s never told anyone about this.  Everyone already thinks he’s freakish enough.  But then, Sherlock doesn’t really have any friends to tell this to anyway.  He’s got his skull, but he doesn’t really count, does he?
The skull in his hands had belonged to a man, black, who had a significant tie to France in his ancestry.  He’d been in his late 20’s, early 30’s when he died.  Well fed and healthy, he’d died from something unrelated to his health.  A traffic accident maybe, or a break in at his home.  Sherlock bends down to examine the rest of the bones and finds tiny holes in both radii.  Sherlock knows those marks, where the needle digs in too deep because you’re just that thirsty for the rush.
“You don’t ever bring anybody home.  And don’t say –“
Sherlock swings his legs over the edge of the bed and sits up.  John walks slowly over to him and stops right before him.  Sherlock cranes his neck to look up at him; neither one of them says a word.  John looks over Sherlock’s face like he’s studying him, and that’s because he is.  Sherlock stares into John’s eyes, no matter if John is staring into his or not.  Sherlock waits under his gaze.  He can be patient.  He can be patient if it’s for John.
ever stopped you,” he says dryly.
the world.  John is good and safe and doesn’t call him freak or hate him because he sees what others don’t.  John accepts him and supports him and loves him.  John loves him.
“You really should eat more often,” John instructs.  “It’s not healthy for you to binge like this.”
He remembers having to lay there on the pavement, his eyes wide open and his breath held tight, watching John crumble to pieces in front of him.  It’s the most torturous thing he’s ever experienced.
four scotches he had makes Sherlock jump.
“Not my area,” Sherlock says in unison with John.
“Oh god, yeah, John, there,” Sherlock rambles.  John starts to set a quick, rough pace, reveling in
“Do you still listen to it?”  John asks as they walk back to the flat.  Sherlock doesn’t answer.  “You know you can, right?”  John says, looking up to see Sherlock staring forward.  “It’d be nice to have some different music playing around the place,” he says quietly,  almost more to himself than to Sherlock.  Sherlock glances toward him, eyebrow raised in offense.
“No…I want to,” Sherlock whispered before going back to kissing him.
Sherlock turns his head over to John, his face half lit up by moonlight, and Sherlock’s breath catches in his throat.
“You think
!?”  Sherlock sneers, spitting in Lestrade's face.
Molly nods and resigns herself back to her room.  She calls out quietly from the doorway, “Wake me up if you need anything.”
“It would ruin everything.  We could never come back from it.”
“Say something,” John demands.  But Sherlock doesn’t know what to do.  “WELL?”  John shouts.
“Because I
“Look at me,”  Lestrade coaxes.  He doesn’t want to,  doesn’t want to see the concern and caring in Lestrade’s face.  He just wants that needle back in his arm.
John’s moaning loudly and the pounding from the bed hitting the wall is coming in an arrhythmic rush and Sherlock imagines it’s him up there with John.  Sherlock imagines John wrapping that perfect, hot mouth around his rock hard prick and he comes hard right before he hears John do the same upstairs.
Sherlock remembers John climbing the stairs two at a time and slamming the door to his room without so much as a grunt of acknowledgment.  Sherlock also remembers John didn’t come out for a day and a half.
John laughs a genuine laugh and Sherlock breathes a sigh of relief.  He can’t figure out why though.  He already knows John likes him, why does he still feel so nervous about these things?
“Sherlock, it’s Christmas, and she’s….” John whispers but trails off when he catches Sherlock’s gaze.
“I’m a police officer, Sherlock.  I can tell when someone’s taking drugs,” Lestrade says evenly.
As always, R&R -- it pleases the Universe, and me too!  XX K
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock doesn’t feel like talking.  He doesn’t feel like telling Molly that he was so bored he shot holes in the wall, but not before spray painting a huge, yellow smiley face on it.  He doesn’t want to tell her about the fight he and John just had.  He doesn’t feel like telling her that John ran off to that doctor’s flat to hide out.  He doesn’t feel like telling her that an explosion just decimated his entire block and knocked him clean on his face.  He doesn’t want to tell her that he insulted and deduced every EMT within a 20 foot radius of him just to get them to leave him alone.  He doesn’t want to tell her that he walked to her flat on autopilot because he just did not want to be alone tonight.
Sherlock speeds out all he knows about Mrs Spencer and all the things he’s deduced, even firing off things he didn’t have time to think about.  When he’s finished, he flashes Mycroft a smug smile, knowing for once he’s finally got the best of him.  Mycroft crosses the room, once again lowering himself to glare into Sherlock’s eyes.
“Mummy says I’m smarter than the other children,” Sherlock says, ignoring Mycroft’s order to leave and instead climbing up onto Mycroft’s four-poster and flopping down on his stomach.  “Mummy says that’s why they’re so mean to me.”  Mycroft closes his book and turns towards Sherlock with a tight smile on his face.
At this, Lestrade’s face softens completely and Sherlock doesn’t know what to think.
Sherlock pulls himself off the couch and feels the weight of his guilt settle in his shoulders.  He toes silently towards the kitchen, undeciding if he wants to go sulk in his room or up to John’s.  At the last second, he turns towards the landing and makes his way up the stairs, making sure to skip the creaky fourth step.  But half way up, he wavers.  What can he possibly say to John to make this better?
John gets done berating Sherlock and stands in the threshold of the kitchen, breathing harshly and raggedly.  He stares angrily at Sherlock who’s still too stunned to speak.
“Yes, that’s the ‘fuck you like an animal’ band.  Mum insisted that I be classically trained in some instrument when I was younger.  I picked the violin and got made fun of for playing it constantly.  Then I found out that Trent Reznor is a classically trained pianist and I…” he trails off.  John waits for him to find his wording.  “It just made me feel better, all right?  I didn’t feel so alone.  He was off making art and not giving a shit what people thought of him and he was just as much of a ponce as I was.”  Sherlock uses the word that was often thrown at him by all the boys he was at school with.
And again, John does as he’s told.  He moves slowly to let Sherlock gets used to the pace, but also because he knows if he goes all in this’ll be over way too soon.  He stares into Sherlock’s eyes for a long moment before lowering himself to reverently kiss him.
Sherlock desperately tries to pay attention to the programme and ignore what John’s doing right now.  But all he can hear is that woman’s exaggerated moaning because she knows Sherlock is listening and it’s driving him crazy.  It’s been a long time since Sherlock has had sex.  Everyone assumes he’s a virgin because he just doesn’t give a shit about who’s sleeping with whom, but he isn’t.  He just can’t find anyone who doesn’t annoy him or bore him.  He just can’t find anyone he likes or trusts enough.  He doesn’t care because he’s married to his work, but its times like this that Sherlock thinks it would be nice to have someone to get off with.
When Molly wakes up in the morning, she finds the two tea mugs in her drying rack, her blanket and pillow returned to their usual storage spots, and no sign of Sherlock having been there at all.
Sherlock also looks up the words “antisocial” and “conscience” too.  He thinks he understands what Mycroft means now, saying they don’t care.  Sherlock shouldn’t care because he is better than other people, he does see what others don’t, even if Mycroft is better at observing than he is.  Sherlock has learned how to deduce and observe, he can learn how to not care too.  He’ll teach himself to act without remorse, to be cold and calculating.  If being superior means not having friends, than Sherlock supposes he just won’t have friends.  Who needs them when you’re smarter and better than everyone anyway?
Sherlock remembers when he took that skull.  It wasn’t long after he got the job at Bart’s five years ago as a clinical chemist, which was nice because they let him come in whenever he wanted and stay as long as he liked, just as long as he met deadlines.  He was also allowed use of lab supplies for experiments as long as they weren’t too extravagant or expensive.  Sherlock always thought this was strange since Bart’s is funded by the British government until he remembered that Mycroft
But still, Sherlock pulls away from Irene and finds John’s eyes.  John leans forward and kisses Sherlock passionately but it’s nothing like how Irene just did.  John is gentle with him and doesn’t try to smother him with his face on top of his.  Where Irene is physical, John is emotional -- his mind and his heart, constantly at war.  He wants Sherlock to feel what’s behind this, he wants him to know exactly how he feels about him from this one kiss.  Sherlock pulls away and stares into John’s eyes as he continues to stroke him.  John is what’s good in the world.  John is what’s good
“I was the right age when grunge music got popular,” he concedes.
He inspects Sherlock for a moment.  “You’re lying,” John says finally, turning back to the bathroom to finish his shower.
, Sherlock.  You sit there and you poke and you prod, you do that stupid filtering thing because someone who isn’t you is talking for once.  You let me think it was ok to tell you this stuff, the stuff you KNOW IS HARD FOR ME TO SAY!”
Sherlock looks away but not before he catches John’s eyes for a second.  John’s eyes are black orbs.  His lips are swollen and his hair is a mess.  John doesn’t say anything and neither does Sherlock.  He just stares at the television and pretends to pay attention.  Out of the corner of his eye, Sherlock can see John hesitate for a fraction of a second before he leads the woman upstairs.
Sherlock is too busy brooding to answer.
Within 60 seconds a reply comes.
Sherlock’s mind wanders to David and Samantha.  He can remember exactly how their hands felt on his body, how their mouths felt on his.  Tonight’s no exception, except its John’s hands replacing theirs.  It’s John’s mouth he’s thinking about, and it bothers him why he just can’t figure out why.
Then John turns around and catches Sherlock staring.  But Sherlock doesn’t look away.  The back of John’s shoulder looks like a thing of beauty when compared to the front.  The front of his shoulder is where the bullet entered, where it tore through ligaments and shattered bone.  The scar is an ugly red color and Sherlock can just make out the tiny holes from where the stitches went in to sew John back together again.
“Fuck me,” she says still keeping the rhythm.  “Fuck me like you’d fuck John Watson.”  His breathing stalls a bit in his chest, but he doesn’t move.  But then Irene whispers, “I want you to,” and it’s over.  He
Finally, Sherlock stops screaming long enough to catch his breath.
John never eats raspberry jam.  John never takes sugar in his tea or coffee.  John doesn’t like wearing socks.  If John doesn’t sleep well the night before, he falls asleep sitting upright in his arm chair.  Little things like this.
John loves the sounds he can elicit from Sherlock.  Usually so well reserved and controlled, Sherlock is wanton and loud in bed.  Every time he hears Sherlock moan and groan and whine and keen, it makes his cock that much harder.  He could catalogue every sound his detective can make and still never get tired of hearing them.
“Yeah?”  John asks.  Sherlock seems set on ending it there.  “Well go on.  Why that band?  Isn’t that the ‘fuck you like an animal’ band?”
“You sho – oh, nothing,” John sighs.  There’s no use in lecturing him.  Sherlock will never listen anyway.  John puts his fork down and looks around the restaurant.
Sherlock’s knuckles turn white as he grips the door handle hard, wanting desperately to be anywhere but where he is, but oddly unable to actually force his body to run out of the room.  He stands rooted to the spot, struggling as whether to stay, run, or turn around and physically attack Lestrade.  They’re all crossing his mind, they all seem like viable options.  Even high, Sherlock is sure he can take Lestrade in a fight.  He’s a skilled boxer and the only training Lestrade does at the gym is running.  Sherlock would definitely win if he started a fight.  But Sherlock waits too long to decide and before he can properly react, Lestrade gently grabs Sherlock’s wrist, and Sherlock lets him.
But he needs John.  He’d give it all up, if it meant having John.  John is safe and strong and smart in ways that Sherlock never could be.  And god, he’s beautiful.  His eyes and hands and the way he hums in the shower and makes toast for breakfast because it’s easy and quick and he can never wake up on time to be at the surgery.  Sherlock knows everything about John, all his habits and nuances and idiosyncrasies.  There is no more deducing John Watson for Sherlock Holmes.  He knows things John hasn’t even told him yet because he can read it in his body and eyes and stance, and Sherlock would never blurt them out because he knows it needs to come from John.
