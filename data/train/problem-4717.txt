Opening his eyes Tony began preparing a small plate of cakes, dipping the end of each daintily into the coffee within his cup as he went on, because in for a penny and all that.
“My father had dragged me out of every nightclub and gin-joint in three different ports by the time I was seventeen. The war was on. I can believe that my mother agreed to sending me to the monastery because she wanted to save my life, but I think my father just wanted me out of the picture. My reputation was bad for business.” Tony admitted with a rueful shrug.
“The kind with singing and dancing, and cake.” Tony shot back, trying to keep the exasperation out of his voice. James was moody because he was tired, dirty, and afraid. But they were all tired, dirty and afraid. Tony was all they had, but sometimes he just wanted to shout at them to just do for themselves for five minutes. Five minutes where he didn’t have to smile or put a good face on for someone else. But there was nowhere to go to be alone in the cabin besides the loft, and history had shown he’d just be followed by one duckling or more if he tried to retreat up there.
“What about the other thing we discussed?” Tony asked, leaning forward in his chair and lowering his voice. Though he doubted the precocious Fraulein Darcy had finished with her flirtations, he would not put it past the brazen young woman to be listening at keyholes. “Can I transfer the money overseas?”
He didn’t stay to watch the words land. If the captain disapproved Tony didn’t care. He’d spent a lifetime living up to peoples low expectations of him and failing miserably at any and every attempt to rise above them. He wasn’t sure any longer that he knew who Captain Rogers was, but the sooner Rogers realized that Tony was never going to be his father the better.
The man yelped, jerking away from him as he panted in a strangled voice, “it’s been ransacked!” before he took off again.
The morning dawned bright and sunny. Stefen had been up and out of bed before the light had even begun to penetrate the curtains, his furtive movements waking Tony momentarily before he fell back into sleep again.
"Well then Dachau will be their new home." The Warden smiled as if Tony had told a joke and gestured for them to keep moving. They were led to a small cramped office guarded by a single guard, who saluted the warden and was promptly dismissed. Once he’d opened the door Tony could see the room was sparse, nearly bare, clearly not a space regularly used. It was an obvious power move, but Tony was grateful for it. Having time to set it up was one of the biggest obstacles to his plan for the bomb.
Tony laughed through his tears at how quickly she switched tracks from spitting on the memory of his father to fussing over the most mundane of creature comforts. Was he warm? He felt like he’d never be cold again.
“Tony?” he heard Ian’s voice coming muffled through the wood and his brow furrowed, worried that some new crisis was underway. He hadn’t meant to give the children so much free time, but when he’d finally given up being able to reach Freddie at the Castle, he’d come back here to collect himself before facing the world again.
“You ready?” he murmured low, offering Péter one last chance to change his mind, but Péter just nodded. At first he held it as if it were a gun he were unused to firing. His fingers pale where they clutched the dark wood tightened as he stood, drawing the eyes of the guests and his father once more.
A piano was being played somewhere with no real concentration, just notes being tapped out, followed by the murmured of voices. Other than that, the house seemed eerily quiet to him, as if it weren’t occupied by near a dozen people.
“Captain.” Stark, to Steve’s eternal frustration, looked as if he wasn't sure if he wanted to laugh or not.
Tony grinned to himself, sipping quietly from his cup. He knew there was a reason he'd liked her from the gate.
The whole city seemed to be waiting for news on whether the diplomat Vom Rath would live or die. Her young people were out, jobs and classrooms abandoned in favor of collecting around civilian radios and smoking cigarettes between clenched teeth. Waiting and growing all the more restless the more hours slipped by without word.
"Herr Stark!" Jann greeted Tony with a bright smile, leaning in to pepper his cheeks with kisses in the non-German fashion that reminded Tony warmly for a moment of his mother. "How wonderful to see you again. But you look surprised to see us."
"I doubt they'd bother taking us alive if they caught up to us." the monk replied, less fear than Tony expected in the observation. "Did you know? There were men imprisoned in there whose only crime was that they were feeble in the mind… One morning we woke up, and they were all gone. Those men who call themselves healers, they bragged how they would be taken to another facility and euthanized. I saw how little they cared for life in Dachau.”
The children, having already gobbled down their meal and grown bored with the adult conversation had been told to go “play, but they were mostly just wandering about the paved paths whispering amongst themselves. Natacha and Péter had elected to stay behind, perhaps to feel more adult, but Tony could tell Péter was regretting the choice as his eyes glazed with boredom.
So, Steve had been right about that part at least. Tony cared about the children. That had never been false. He’d offered up his affection for the children like a sort of balm, but it fell flat. Perhaps it had for both of them because a moment later, Tony chuckled humorlessly and muttered, "I wouldn’t be a good tutor if I wasn’t concerned with their welfare."
tried to introduce Stefen’s face to the floor that morning. Ah but they’d forgiven one another, because that was the way of it. If he couldn’t count on his prala in this world, who could he count on? That was Stevie always thinking of him, except of course when he didn’t. Selfish bastard.
“Quiet, I’m telling you a story. As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, Mama always lit one candle in my window and told father it was because I was afraid of the Christmas demon. Every year she’d keep the light burning during Chanukah until the excuse should have embarrassed me but...I think I liked it, the light. I missed it at the Abby, more than I realized.”
Maria’s eyes widened in delight as she leaned over to whisper excitedly into Artur’s ear. They all watched the boy, who was meticulous marinating his food in his meat sauce, expectantly.
“You can’t disappear from your own party. People might talk.” Tony reminded them both and Stefen heaved an aggravated sigh.
“He's a fucking lovesick idiot over Stark. Aint that the truth? And Stevie’d tear the world apart for the people he loves, believe me, gadje, I would know. I watched him do it once already. He’s never gonna learn to stand down. You’ll catch your death waiting on it.”
All three of the monks had turned at the sound to find Antony paused in the cloister beside an overladen wheelbarrow that looked in danger of spilling more of its contents on the next push. It was clear that Antony had already seen them, and that he had been attempting to sneak by unnoticed (no doubt down to his workshop where he liked to disappear for hours) and as soon as Nik's eyes met his the man rolled them heavenward, turning his back on the three staring at him from across the garth and bending to collect the spilled scraps and bits of metal that were now littering the cloister.
They looked proud as peacocks up there, so much older than the last time Bucky had seen them and yet still the same. Tacha looked so regal it almost made him sick with pride but the foot slowly tapping against the floor and the barely discernable sway of her hips gave her away. That freckle faced little girl who dared anything and hated to lose to her brothers was itching to come out of this new grown up skin and it made Bucky smile.
“Who is that boy?” he asked, nodding toward Emil. And then as an afterthought, “where the hell is your brother?”
The hotel had obviously given the captain one of their best options. There were fresh flowers in every vase within the sitting room and there was bright sunshine beaming in through the balcony.
Monk or not, the man cut a dashing figure in his jacket and tails, plus one mention of the name Stark and the ladies of this particular circle got a whiff of money which in their eyes made any man interesting. But Stark and the children did not leave the captain’s side for so much as a moment despite every hint or opportunity thrown his way and the captain did not seem to mind this. If anything the closeness seemed to help him relax, the two men sharing quips and quick banter in so familiar a fashion it was hard not to feel something of a third wheel.
Silently Tony reached for the drawer where Willamina kept the knives, his hand curling around the cool wooden handle as Péter’s breath audibly quickened within the room.
On the subject of sex… It is true, however, that a clever woman who can use her personal attractions wisely has in her armory a very formidable weapon. Closely allied to Sex in a woman is the quality of sympathy, and nothing is easier for a woman than to gain a man's confidence by the showing and expression of a little sympathy. This cannot be done by an undersexed woman.
I did not hate it. But I hated how easy they made it look, as if all it took for our father to heal was a song or two.
“We can’t let that happen.” Harold barked a little too loudly and Tony jumped, his eyes flying to the kitchen door where he knew their guard stood just outside. When there was no movement and he did not stick his head in to check on them, Tony let himself relax just the slightest.
Below you'll find Nonnberg Abbey: A benedictine monastery in Salzburg. Made famous by one Maria Von Trapp.
“It’s Dr. Vonkov, I’ll remind you, and yes. Antony was a pupil of mine, many years ago.” Vonkov informed their host succinctly and Steve shot Tony a surprised look. The monk had certainly never mentioned
“Yes, I’ve heard...many things about your work.” Steve got out stiffly.  He’d heard nothing, but his paltry attempt at inviting conversation seemed to calm her, her slim arched brows disconnecting back into separate entities and the scrutinizing look she’d fixed him with after his outburst, easing slightly at the mention of her work at the orphanage.
Are you sure you don't want a shave?" Stefen paused the razor blade in his hands to twist toward Tony who was just finishing tucking his shirt into his slacks. Tony made a face at him and Stefen's smirk widened into a smile, a low chuckle rumbling in his chest.
His heart plummeted into his stomach just as the first few shots rang out, a bullet pinging against the side of the truck. There were more shots and Bucky shouted for the men in the back to duck just as the glass in the back window shattered noisily. Tony’s eyes flew to Bucky as the truck swerved violently, wondering desperately if he’d been shot, but a moment later Bucky righted them, cursing as he tried to see through the web of cracks in the windshield which now had a hole in the center.
But the day passed just like all the others had, and with only themselves for company, slowly but surely Tony and the children found their balance. Soon they were talking again and even laughing with each other on occasion. Tony kept up their voice lessons and thought up things to teach them so that they would be self-sufficient should anything happen to him. He did what he could not to alarm them, to make it all always seem like fun- just another part of their new way of living - but the fear of their very possible separation hovered in the back of his mind.
Wherever they went, Stefen had to know he could still fight them, or he simply wouldn't go. He'd make sure his family was safe and then he’d say farewell and go wherever it was he felt he could make a difference. He’d leave them all waiting at windows for someone who would never return.  Tony knew it like he knew his own name.
Ian rushed to strap on the winter covers he’d set out to dry, and pad the insides of the vest with the heated stones wrapped in burlap. All the while Tony’s voice drifted down through the open door of the loft, singing a soft lullaby.
Clearing his throat loudly, Tony called for the attention of the remaining guests, “Ladies and Gentlemen may we have your attention? Our birthday boy would like to thank you all for coming, and to devote the rest of this fair but nippy evening to dancing.”
Pepper probably would have had a heart attack at his recklessness when he was carrying such a precious load, but it was such a refreshing change from moodiness and grim stoic faces to see Sara so delighted. She was laughing so uproariously he wasn't sure if he should be concerned for her health or laugh along with her.
“He worries we might be spies sent from the government. Luzzato is telling him that I saved their lives.” Tony murmured quietly as if he had read Steve’s mind. “A bit of a stretch, but if it keeps us out of the rain.” He shrugged, wiping wet strands of hair out of his eyes. Steve didn’t think it was such a stretch. It was still strange, knowing how he wanted to kiss the blue off those lips but not being able to
"Has everyone gone mad?" James lifted his head to glower at them. "We can't go to another country by ourselves. We don't have any money!"
When he’d closed it behind her Tony stood for a moment with his heart thudding as his mind tore apart every word she’d said and every facial expression he’d observed, looking for some hint as to what was to come.
“No, I’m not done. Tony, I'm not done!” the little girl insisted petulantly as he set her on dry ground.
Ah. Tony thought with a strange twist of bitterness in his gut. Of course. That was the only reason Countess Schrader would have set foot in the Rogers household after all these years.
What was he doing still on shore? Nearly everyone else, save Bucky, Sara and Cap, was enjoying the water.
“Now the soup.” He commanded, pointing at the little clay pot and Tony snapped a salute, grateful for the return of his smile.
All the while, Steve thought about his children, itching to be on his way home to them. Steve had to get them out of Italy. The fear gnawed at him, and it was only repeating to himself over and over their few blessings that kept him sane. His children had beds and comfortable lodging. His daughter went to school and did not paint her face and walk the street to afford her food.
"I know this is hard for you to understand. " Father finally spoke again, after the woman's footsteps had faded. His voice sounded hoarse and he wouldn't meet her eyes. "But your uncle is in trouble, and I have to go."
Natacha jumped as something clanged down heavily within the kitchen. She heard Willamina's voice again, sharp and brittle as she barked at Hammer, "I won't have talk like that in my kitchen. Captain Rogers is a good man!"
Tony watched in amusement as Stefen took a polite sip and then fidgeted under the scrutiny of the women, before he caught himself, clearing his throat and straightening his spine like the most resolute of soldiers, and stepping toward Tony with purpose.
“If only emotions could be so easily wished away, Herr Stark.” Pepper sighed, smoothing back Maria’s hair, something of a reprimand and a warning behind her tone. Tony got her point he supposed but he had a plan of action and he was going to stick with it. He took Artur’s hand and turned to reach for Maria’s, who to the surprise of all readily left Peppers arms to reach back.
“Soldiering. Did you imagine it would look like this?” Fischer repeated. “I didn’t. I imagined far more glory and much less paperwork.” The doctor chuckled humorlessly.
The officer’s keen eyes flew to Tony but slid away from him a moment later to land on the covered table behind him and Tony’s chest clenched tight. He held perfectly still, hardly daring to breathe.
"What is it? We're very busy here." He snapped, eyeing Tony and his scarlet clad figure with distaste. "Wolfe, you must tell the warden I don't have time for these distractions. It interrupts my work!"
"Baroness Schrader, how lovely to see you again," Herr stark acknowledged her with a surprised lilt in his tone. It was irritating, if only because he had a right to his surprise.
Tony nodded slowly, considering each corner of the plan that was slowly taking shape in his mind. Too slowly. Not enough. Not anywhere good enough. Come on Stark. Think!
There was nothing wrong in nature with a man seeing his long time employee off on the train, but in these times there was nothing quite right about it either when that employee looked like Sam. It was frustratingly stupid, in Steve’s opinion but he had a dangerous letter on his person and the children to think of. That man outside had been watching so closely, it still gave Steve the shivers to remember it.
It was a simple instrument, but well made. The lines crafted onto the surface of the dark wood struck him as unique. Intricate and detailed with the same artists eye that Stefen had inherited from the man who had made it no doubt. To think that his grandfather had crafted something so beautiful, only for it to sit in the music room gathering dust, all because Stefen had been afraid of people questioning his heritage.
“I know it can get a bit dark, but so can the world, and better that they work through these things in a safe environment. The glass box always shatters Captain, and in my defense Sara naps during literature anyway and the rest of your children are uncommonly bright. They’ve already read everything available to them in the house twice over. Maria was picking her way through your copy before I ever got involved.” he rambled. “It’s in French did you know? She doesn’t even speak it. Well she does now, we’ve been learning, but my point –”
“Stefen?” Tony prompted gently, drawing close to lay a hand on his arm. Tony felt the muscles beneath his sleeve tense, only for Stefen to twist his arm until his hand could grasp Tony’s wrist. Tony’s heart slammed in his chest as Stefen’s eyes met his. The captain’s grip was unforgivingly firm, but it was Bucky he turned and spoke to.
“Then where were you?!” Where was she when anyone could have snuck into the house, when Stark, a stranger, could have snuck into the children’s rooms and done just about anything, when they’d been screaming the house awake? Steve’s blood was pounding so hard in his ears that for a moment he almost didn’t hear it when the monk spoke.
couldn’t stop the fear from creeping up, couldn’t stop thinking about how large the house was and how many places to hide, kept hearing screams in the night and smelling the smoke.
“Where are your parents?” Tony shot him a look when the girl flinched at his bark and Steve closed his eyes, swallowing back the urge to yell, because there was no one to yell at but himself. He tried again, speaking as slow and as lowly as he could manage without feeling like he would come unhinged. “Ask her, please.”
Tony tilted his head until he could meet Stefen’s eyes, just to let him know he wasn’t fooled by that in the least.
“Then help the children,” Virgina insisted and Charlotte held back a flinch. “If the Schrader's offer to take them, promise that the whole family will publicly support Stefen’s execution, they will accept it. I know they will.”
Complete silence fell over the room in the wake of his words. Bakhizen’s mouth had actually fallen open. Not that Tony had noticed, gaze intent as it was upon watching the shock and anger take over Stefen’s face in turns.
Stefen directed the busboy to deposit Tony’s things in the second bedroom and then fished in his pocket for a tip before guiding the young man toward the door, thanking him for his service.
“Who?” Tony demanded to know, a sinking sensation in his stomach. Who would dare and how had they known? He nodded aggressively toward Hammer and spat. “This lying sack of shit? Don’t trust him.”
All in all, the children seemed overjoyed with the abundance of gifts, practical or otherwise. Over their heads, in the middle of that whirlwind of movement and fevered delight the captain’s gaze caught his and held.
And Steve did suppose that after what he’d done to the man, what stark was willing to forgive him, he was well and truly
“James could have drowned.” Natacha replied simply, as if that was answer enough. Bucky supposed it was. He snorted under his breath, shaking his head fondly even though something in his chest had begun to feel tight.
“I regret the loss of your man.” Deiter answered slowly, only glancing momentarily at the spread of photos featuring a dark-haired man caught in candid moments. “But this sounds like a worry for the Abwehr.”
A monk reading in the library. We figure with Tony's memory he probably knows everything about everything by now.
Stefen’s mouth tilted upward smugly but he said nothing, just continued to hold Tony’s wrist in his hand, and began stroking the skin gently with his thumb.
“They have every reason to fear, Stefen, you are right, and only you to show them the meaning of strength. Don’t let fear become their master.”
Bucky's eyebrows shot up near his hairline before his expression darkened and Tony huffed an aggravated breath, pausing in his attempt to get the damp shirt clinging to Stefen's sweat slick chest free.
“Tony what’s wrong? Is it Stefen?” Pepper appeared around a corner in her dressing gown, her anxious face filling Tony’s vision as they nearly collided. He grabbed her by the shoulders.
"Good morning Herr stark." She greeted him softly, her pink lips tilting toward a small smile. "Or is it afternoon already? I confess, I've lost track of the time."
But not for the first time, Péter found himself thinking that maybe it wasn’t good enough just to stand guard in case something bad happened. Maybe they had the power to stop the bad things before they ever happened.
He could be grateful at least that Hughard had the foresight to set up a trust with the church that Stanislov couldn’t touch. Over a hundred thousand marks. That was a fortune, if considerably smaller than the millions Tony might have inherited otherwise. No matter. It was enough for a man to live comfortably off of for the rest of his days without having to work.
Right. Because their man inside was only able to buy them just enough time to get in and out. And they expected to be pursued after the fact... but what if they weren't? What if there was a way to get in and out with no one the wiser?
Stark had a way about him that Steve struggled to put words to. He might call it star quality but that seemed silly. Stark had chosen to be a monk after all. His clothing was understated, his manners polished, but nothing about the man himself could be as easily summarized.
There came a stage at every party - no matter how anticipated or well executed on the part of the host -  when fingers began to fidget with watches and eyes began to linger on doors. The wilting hour.
Tony made up reasons to pass Stefen’s study in order to get a good look at the lock, and once to hold a torch close and peer inside the cylinder at the inner workings. From there it was a matter of doing the measurements by recall, and drafting a sketch of the appropriate shape needed to throw the levers inside. Once he had that, the rest was easy sailing, thanks to the fresh sheets of steel and the steel cutter Stefen had purchased for him in Berlin.  Cutting the key and filing it down until it was smooth and rounded took the better part of an afternoon and left his arms aching (he was going soft) but the work was satisfying in a way that sat deep in his gut, heavy and warm like one of Willamina’s hearty soups.
"Gaoaza," Steve muttered just loud enough for Bucky to hear and begin laughing at him. He braced himself against the pain and pushed himself to complete another push up. Seven.
“Brother Filip left after you did. Turns out he was only there to get in touch with the Vatican but now he’s needed more on the outside. The Abbot still lets me help him so long as I come back in one piece.” Clint explained with a bored shrug and Tony blinked in surprise. Well, he was more surprised at his surprise really. He’d always suspected Farkas was running an order of spies under those priestly robes and Coulson had always been his right hand.
Stefen paused, his eyes flickering over Tony practically doing acrobats with literature and to his butler who was stupidly still holding out Tony’s mail with a slightly stunned look on his face.
“Did you really mean it?” Bucky asked, wandering toward the window. The curtains were open because even if he’d never articulate as much Steve had always liked to watch the sun rise.
“Come to Switzerland.” Stefen murmured into the stillness and this time when he asked, there was no mistaking for either of them what he was asking for.
Péter jerked out of whatever daze had gripped him, his head whipping around to look at them, cheeks fire engine red.
Some would call the islands with their bustling industry packed to the brim with their warehouses and their shipyards a blemish on the land, but there was something wonderful about the smoke and the rust set against the blue of sky and water, that set his heart to thumping as the cab traveled down a busy dock toward a square building that sat squat like a frog at the edge of a pond.
Instead, miss Janneke VanDyne was standing on the front steps in a brightly colored frock, her dark hair covered by a thin wispy scarf to keep the breeze at bay. She was not alone either. There were two children, a boy and a girl, at her side. If Tony had to guess, he would have said they were roughly around thirteen or fourteen years of age.
It took only a few moments to clean himself up and dispose of the bucket, far longer to dissuade Bruce from mothering him. Thankfully it was late enough that even Bruce only seemed to want to put in the token effort when dealing with Tony’s issues. He sought his bed after only a few protests but not before warning Tony to go straight to bed, as there were only a few hours until wake up call; but they both knew Tony was far more likely to sneak down to his workshop to salvage what was left of the day than he ever was to attempt sleep.
Schmidt had a cruel smile Charlotte decided and she regretted pitting him and the captain against each other. It had not been her intent.
“But Tony says we can work on that on our next model,” James chirped, Steve observing that he was turning the handle of a hand drill while Ian carefully held it and the nail in place, the pink of his tongue poking out the side of his mouth as he concentrated.
The door had a lock, but the knob moved smoothly. Still the door didn’t budge when he pushed. Blocked from inside, he realized.
"We're not going to have lessons today I think," he announced to them as he took his usual seat. His announcement wasn't met with any enthusiasm or much acknowledgement at all. Only Artur bothered to look at him, the little boy nodding slightly as his shoulders drooped. He took a fast hitching breath like he might start sobbing and Tony tensed, relieved when no tears came.
"You seem fine with that?" he remarked, curious, but if he had any doubts about her feelings towards pushy Emil, they were settled when she crossed her eyes and murmured lowly in a voice that wouldn't carry beyond them, "Oh dear. I hope he still comes around."
“I want to be a girl again.” Her small hands reached up to smooth away the moisture from his cheeks. Her lips were twisted in wry little smile, that defied the sadness in her eyes. “Besides, hoods have pockets and a knife is much easier to carry.” She rested her head back against his chest and Steve held onto her tightly like she was a raft. Somehow, she held his head above those waves. They bobbed together, drifting in the sea.
“There is actually a world of difference. It’s a matter of mathematics Herr Bakhuizen, the concentration of bean versus the cut of milk and we mustn’t forget the variable of foam and spices, but I won’t burden you with the details because the honest truth is I couldn’t make a proper cappuccino without espresso. Sweet Mary mother of Christ, I’d make deals with the devil himself for a good espresso.” Tony sighed dramatically closing his eyes once more (not missing the incredulous expression that flashed over Bakhuizen’s face). On his right the captain huffed once more but Tony’s mouth turned up because he thought there was a decidedly amused ring to that sound now.
“Shhh. Do you want all of Austria to hear you?” Natacha shushed them with a rebuking stare in Tony’s direction as he let James slide carefully to the floor. “James said we have to be careful we’re not heard.”
“Bucky will save him,” she insisted, but her tone was hollow and bare of any inflection. “There’s still time.”
Bakhuizen and Stefen were standing over the captain’s desk, looking over what might have been a map but was hard to discern because at his sudden entry both men moved to block it from view. Bakhuizen’s face cycled through horrified surprise to anger in a frankly hilarious fashion but Tony kept his amusement to himself as Stefen snapped, “Stark, there better be a good reason for this interruption.”
Tony had brought happiness and if it wasn't the poetry Peggy had been so fond of, it was enough for Steve to know that where Stark was concerned he intended to deny himself nothing. That was perhaps the good thing about Tony being male. He wouldn't care that Steve had never been good with words. But he might still appreciate a gesture or two, and if having his own designated work space would keep the monk out of trouble for five minutes it would be a worthy enough investment all around.
It was the silence that was truly the worst so Tony did what he could to fill it. Before the discovery of the radio that had primarily involved organizing and taking stock of their tools and supplies. The lodge, though small, was well outfitted for an old bachelor retreat. There was no kitchen to speak of, just an old trough sink under the window, a long table and some cabinetry where Tony fond a few dusty spice jars and a mothy bag of flour. Not much in the way of pots and pans, just a big iron pot and a few smaller bent ones made of cheap tin. It looked like Phillips did most of his cooking over the fire. There was a baking stone sat on top a detachable iron grate within the fireplace at an ideal height to smoke meat, and several notches where the height could be adjusted. There was also a bar with a hook on it near the top to hang the big iron pot.
, so let’s just toss everything-” noticing Pepper’s glower Tony quickly amended, “that isn’t required by your father that is, not those things surely, but we can toss everything else and design our days around things you’d be interested in learning. So, I’m all ears. What is it you want to learn?”
“What are you doing?” he repeated the question slowly, a dangerous edge to his tone and he took a step closer. Tony fought the urge to take a step back, suddenly aware with every sense of preservation that he had, that he was alone with someone who would not hesitate to kill him for the right reason.  Something told him protecting Stefen and his interests would
It wasn’t proper for his staff to take such liberties with his booze and his personal space, some distant part of Steve’s mind noted, but he couldn’t be much bothered by that either. It was nice. Kind of like how it used to be before… well before.
Tony turned sharp eyes on him, all crackling energy, armed with his cleverness to beat Steve’s will into the ground. Only, that never seemed to be what Tony wanted. He lit up when Steve countered him, matched him wit for wit and stubborn for stubborn.
Tony’s eyes twitched, the sound of the birds chirping invading his pleasant dreams. The children’s voices faded as the chirping of the bird took up more and more space in his mind. Something wasn’t right about the sound. It kept tickling at his brain and bringing with it a sense of urgency.
"You need to eat, to keep getting better." She finally said, twisting her hands under the table, where she likely thought he couldn't see. He heaved a sigh, as if the prospect of making a point to eat a full breakfast was as wearisome as he'd often found it even before he'd been poisoned. Tony hadn't said anything, but Steve knew who was responsible. He had a plethora of enemies that might want to off him, but his dysfunctional eating habits did help make poison an unviable option.
Bucky winced. Nele was the older girl and if he was remembering right (and Bucky always remembered this sort of thing right) she had an even rounder ass than Hedy. They’d had a bit of a thing before the work had called him away.
, he thought he heard Bucky say, and Steve felt the sensation of water trickling cool down his throat and he began to cough, his throat convulsing as he tried desperately to swallow.
The children ate silently with their heads ducked down. They could have been machines, or perhaps very life like dolls shoveling their food into their mouths and avoiding looking at each other.
It hurt, more than he would have ever imagined, to hear the truth said like that. To know that his son had put his life in danger and it was because he didn’t think his father was proud of him. The words slashed like a knife, deflating the air from his chest and leaving him with an alarming sensation of falling. He gnashed his teeth together, struggling for balance, his knuckles white from the pressure of fisting them. The urge to take a swing was so strong – beat those words back behind his teeth – but it wouldn’t help. Wouldn’t change the truth.
"Can I help you?" the monk asked in a vaguely sharp tone designed to make those who heard it wilt and Péter unconsciously shifted closer toward Tony.
Tony closed his eyes and did his best to chase away the vision of that world. But still the words scratched at his throat and slamming at the gates of his teeth.
Tony had slipped out of bed and picked up their trail of discarded clothes just the same, wanting to be careful as he opened the door in his dressing grown to retrieve the tray the maid had left by the door. There was hot coffee, warm rolls with marmalade, and a platter of cold cuts that looked appetizing, but after Tony’s (slight) over indulgence on the wine the night before it was the coffee that truly smelled like heaven.
"Not that I doubt your hunting abilities, but Willaminia did provide us with enough for a decent meal. We're not quite reduced to scavenging in the brush."
Stark really had done a number on him. Bucky didn’t understand it but he had decided long ago that Steve being
and there wasn’t a second to spare! Fowlers Solution was an arsenical-tonic, and Tony used the word tonic loosely. At least the mustard gas had been engineered to kill and made no pretenses otherwise.
He felt a stare and glanced up, unsurprised to find Tony watching him, curiosity written on his face.
“We’ve just heard from above that the HJ-Patrol has been promoted to SS function. I am sure many more boys will volunteer once the announcement is made.” At Steve’s frown Olasz huffed a short sigh and quickly finished, “It’s out of my hands Rogers. The Mayor has made his demands. He thinks it’ll stop the unrest in the streets. Make everyone feel secure.”
“Oh but you must show us what you’ve been teaching the children Herr Stark. I just know the prince and the General’s other guests will be enchanted with them.”
Father was distinct because he was low born, only Frauline Werner had no clue how dirty his blood actually was.
"I'll have a talk with the staff. They'll believe a wish to avoid gossip is a good enough reason to demand their silence." The captain decided and Tony nodded, the tension in his gut unclenching.
"Unbelievable." He clapped a hand on Steve's shoulder and aggressively turned him toward the door saying, loud enough for Tony's benefit, "Now that that's settled I need to have a word with Stefen. Bye Stark."
“His symptoms are progressed, but he shows all the signs of Scarlet Fever. Which makes him highly contagious.”
an estimated 17,000 thousand Jews were expelled from German lands and forced across the border illegally, into the country of Poland. At 8:00 in the evening on October the 27
It was a parade like none he’d ever seen. So many important people had come down to see the men off - the minister of propaganda himself, accompanied by the newly appointed Admirals and the Commander of the Wehrmacht.
“I… I’m not-“Stefen began, only for his voice to fail him making Tony’s heart twinge in his chest. Stefen’s throat moved as he swallowed and finished in an unusually quiet voice. “I’m not as gifted as my children are. I don’t know what to play.”
Little Rachol. The babe that Sara Rogers had pulled from the brink of death before she’d even left the womb. Dark eyes and impish smile. Their mother’s smile.
Tony got up from his seat to pull out a chair for her and she thanked him, sitting down with an exhausted air and a slightly overwhelmed expression.
The woman had written Peggy often over the years, always eager to know how she was getting on and to hear about Péter and the rest as they came along. She’d written to Steve as well, after Peggy fell ill… but there was a depression on then, and no money to make a voyage. And after Peggy had died, Steve had found it too difficult to even look his own children in the eye, let alone pen letters to a woman he hardly knew.
James did not have Artur's winsome smile or coveted blond hair, but he was boisterous and (sometimes viciously) competitive, and, thanks to Tony, a talented singer which all served to make him well liked. Péter was grateful that things were easier for the younger boys, because he didn't like to think of them getting beat up every day. Even if James often tempted him to discover differently.
Tony’s hand strokes down his side, and it feels so damn good Steve could groan. He does, and it earns him a little chuckle from Tony who turns his head and kisses the side of Steve’s face. Steve presses into it and lets Tony do as he pleases, enjoying the soft freedom of it all.
“Did you or did you not understand me, Stark?!” Steve snapped as he might to one of his soldiers, his temper flaring wildly.
Costumes were stripped and stored away, faces scrubbed and teeth brushed. Good night songs followed goodnight kisses and finally Tony closed the door of the children’s room behind him. They were so exhausted from the excitement of their two days at festival that they didn’t even protest his decision to take Bucky’s empty room for the night, halfway to dreamland by the time he closed the door.
“Think of it as a little advice. False hope kills quicker than anything else Captain. Though it is fascinating to watch it's killing strike, don't you think?” The General straightened to his full height, the lively gracefulness returning to his movements. He clapped his hands together cheerfully and it was only years of training that kept Steve from lashing out in surprise, he was wound so tight.
He strode out the door in a rush, not waiting to see their reaction or hear any protest. Lt Wolfe. hovered outside the door, his rifle held loosely to his chest, until the warden had gone. As soon as he was out of sight, Tony got to work, snatching the briefcase from Clint’s hand and setting it carefully upon the bare desk.
All of this potentially effected trade and while Norway’s independent rule was still young the house of Odinburg was mindful of its economic position.
It was only snowing lightly so Natacha and some of the other children were making the most of the hours before dinner exploring the grounds. Charlotte and Frau Zemo trailed along somewhere behind them, because Father had nearly forbidden them to go and caused a scene until Charlotte had insisted she was dying for fresh air and to do some exploring of her own.
Tony sighed and wagged a finger at him. “Not fair, Ian. Don’t blame the staff for Artur’s temper. You could cost someone their job.”
Bucky’s tirade came to a sudden halt, as if he’d abruptly run out of steam, and he took several deep breaths, visibly fighting for calm before cursing under his breath. When he looked back at Steve his gaze was plaintive.
The air was sharp with cold, but he had no doubt in the morning it would be fresh with the scent of it as well as spruce and pine. It would almost have been picturesque, if not for the way Bucky slunk toward the cabin, his feet impossibly silent, pistol drawn. Tony gripped the handle of his, muscle strung tight as he watched Bucky disappear around the front. If there was any sound, any commotion at all…
Damn. That would make it nearly impossible to escape with the children on foot. There were a number of diversions Tony could think up, but every last one of them would still leave him and the children fleeing armed men and dogs on foot in the dead of winter with nowhere safe to turn and no provisions.
A bolt of fear jolted through Steve as Tony’s words sank in. Péter couldn’t be tangled up with the X-Men. Steve would know. Wouldn’t he? But even as he thought it Steve’s mind was racing. He’d always presumed the people behind the X-Men to be young. University students. Kids whose hearts were in the right place but had no idea what they were getting into. Péter could easily meet someone and feel moved to get involved. He was a good boy. Always had been.
Bucky practically slammed the attic door behind them and marched down the stairs like a herd of elephants. He was annoyed about something but then again he was often annoyed when it came to Stark so Steve was resolved to just let him stew. In many ways, Steve understood that stewing about the subject of Stark was just easier for Bucky than some others.
His hands were itching to measure the exact breadth of those shoulders, compare the ratio from shoulder to waist- let his hands touch all that wet sun bronzed skin and memorize every last inch of it.
“None of us did.” Tony reminded him “But it’s alright now. He’s safe and his breathing is getting better by the minute. You can close your eyes you know.”
Next to him Péter stiffened, hands clenching tightly around his cutlery as he tracked his father’s movements carefully, as if he expected Steve to attack Artur and the sight felt like a stab to the chest.
Ian knew which one it was without even having to glimpse the title. Calico Bush sailed through the air to land at Ian's feet, splitting open with a crack that resounded in his ears.
It angered him, that he could not warn Willamina and the others of the family's intentions to desert the country and the subsequent loss of their livelihoods. He hoped he'd given them enough to tide them for a while. He was ashamed he couldn't do more.
Tony’s lips burned against his skin and Steve’s heart hitched a beat. He closed his eyes, the stones sitting in his chest rattling as he struggled to breathe. He coughed, body protesting the effort of each breath.
“Good morning everyone. By your expression, Captain I can only assume we’ve been invaded by the Russians and must resign ourselves to allegiance with the Motherland.” Tony took a seat in his usual spot, all breezy chatter and cheeky grin as he asked, “Or is it Mussolini, reclaiming more of what the Hapsburgs took. Are we all to be Italians?”
“Captain Khalmmer!” Steve cut over Göring, voice measured and unflinching. “I’m asking now. What happened at Dachau?”
Stefen took the little box from him gingerly, the paper crinkling as the gift exchanged hands and Tony waited, more nervous than he’d expected to be as Stefen began to unwrap the gift, eyebrows raised in curiosity.
“It’s like you thought. They aren’t taking any chances. They’ve pulled over seventy men to escort the captain to Berlin. It’s going to be a damn parade. They want the whole world to see.”
The boy had already striped down and was helping Maria out of her clothes, chattering to her about being a mermaid. She looked less than impressed with this.
Stefen licked his dry lips and looked over the door, longing clear in his eyes and though Tony knew what he was going to ask before he asked it, it hurt still all the same. “The children. Are they here?” Stefen croaked, blinking blearily. Tony shook his head.
There was a sound just outside the door and everything in Steve froze. Even though the woman hadn’t come yet the fear was the same every day. Any sign of movement that wasn't his own or Patroche could mean the end for him.
It was a moment or two before Tony could trust the stillness ringing in his ears enough to pry his eyes open.  The two monks from Engelszell lay close together, one passed out and the other muttering prayers and crossing himself as he clutched his comrade tightly to him. Bruce was uncurling from where he'd thrown himself on top of Clint, blinking rapidly and peering around them cautiously.  Lucas and Richter had been thrown up against the side of the truck, and Leshnerr was sitting up nearby, blinking through the trickle of blood oozing from a red gash on his forehead.
The hurt rose again once more and she stuffed it down because she wasn’t James. She wasn’t going to throw tantrums like a baby, but she wasn’t going to fail him either. She’d protect him even if it had to be from himself.
“But what about the wildcats?” Artur asked nervously, and Tony couldn’t tell whether the boy was anxious to meet one or frightened. Given that it was dark and Artur
, when a shriek of delight (in Sara’s dulcet tones) erupted in the living room and the jaunty tune that Bakhuizen was plying out of his strings kicked up a notch into something down right joyous.
“It’s not your fault Tony,” Stefen read his mind and Tony looked up at him, startled to realize how tightly he was holding Artur. “His bouts are usually pretty minor. He’s had a big day.”
"It's awful good to see you kid." Harold sniffed happily when he let them go and they finally shifted apart. Péter smiled wobblily up at him, but it dimmed as the chauffeur's voice lowered gravely and he asked, "You know your vati’s sick, don't you?"
“Wake up Rogers!” a voice demanded before pain bloomed again in his cheek, bright and burning, before the hand that had struck him pulled back.
Though the interior was better kept up than the exterior it did not look as if anyone stayed there regularly. It had the distinct air of a place that had only recently been aired out, and the empty halls echoed with their steps. Obadiah must have had a few people employed to see to his comforts, but from one end of the house to the other Tony didn’t see another soul besides his escort.
“I’m just people Steve. People die in wars.” Bucky sighed, scratching the hole in his head. Blood was leaking from it in thin red lines that trailed down his cheek and dripped off his chin and onto the floor. “What’s the sin in forgetting about everyone else and just looking out for your own?”
Steve couldn't bring himself to peak any interest in following them. Ian had gone soft in his arms and whether that was from trust in the water or trust in Steve’s ability to hold him he didn’t really care.
“He’s a Jew. So they call him a plagiarist and a fraud.” Tony explained, dull anger sitting heavy in his chest. He was so tired, and he must sound it because Ian was looking at him now with the echoes of fear left by an old memory that was suddenly as fresh as the day it had happened. Tony knew he was in the square again, watching Péter’s friends beat on that old man. Tony could only wonder at how many new memories Ian had made within the HJ.
He pushed off the door frame and made his way toward Ian, an inexplicable expression in his dark eyes.
So they did plan to advance the Reich far beyond Poland. Steve had always known it, but it was a dangerous thing to acknowledge outside of private rooms. Striker didn’t look all that pleased with Göring ’s sloppiness.
“Tacha.” he urged her, and she blinked slowly and closed her mouth. Steve felt a small bit of relief when she clutched James closer to her side and scurried to catch up with them.
His engine was likely never to be finished. There would be little chance for engineering in the Captain’s home and all the more suspicion about his origins if he were to display such a remarkable talent for it. It would sit here a thing interrupted like so many lives since Anschluss. For the time being it appeared this was one more thing the Nazi’s would take from him as their due.
Would he be pleased that Tony had worn some of the clothing he’d had tailored for him? Surely he couldn’t know how Tony had wondered about that, wondered if Stefen had left it to the salesman, or if he’d gone through the selections himself, thinking on how the fine fabrics would feel against the skin and what cuts and lines would make Tony’s legs look longer, shoulders broader.
"My compassion for your children Captain is all that keeps me chained to my post," Tony replied sweetly.
“They’re lovely Pep. I’m sure the girls will be touched.” Tony assured her, leaning over to elbow Péter pointedly in the side.
Stefen needed someone who was unafraid to help him sort through the mess in his head and who would not be cowed by his stubbornness and unwillingness to budge when he thought he was in the right.
Tony blinked in surprise at the rapid fire questions but recovered quickly, arching a brow suspiciously at Natacha.
Bucky listened with half an ear as he gestured for one of the men to fetch the first aid kit, or what they’d managed to scrap together to resemble one and pulled Jann over to the table.
"Why are you two out after curfew?" The officer interjected, ignoring Péter's affable prattle entirely. "Where are your papers?"
Tony had gotten stuck with improvising some early entertainment since Bucky was supposed to have been running the show to keep the brunt of the burden off the children’s shoulders. But dinner had come and gone and Bucky had not appeared, leaving Tony to take up the reins as master of ceremonies.
Of course not. His name was Antony Stark and he was too foolish not to go about breaking his heart over impossible dreams. Which was why he was watching the clock for Péter and Natacha to come home that night, because he worried about them each time they suited up for their programs and left the proverbial nest, and because both children had been acting strangely.
“Why are you here?” Steve unstuck his throat and asked, trying his best to keep from moving too quickly as he approached, remembering keenly the way Tony had flinched away from him in the stairwell. It was everything he could do not to touch him, not to crowd him, intent on making sure he was all right again.
Once the bags had been packed onto bikes and everyone situated, Tony led the children towards the south of town and up into a hill clearing that Frou Hogan had suggested over supper for a picnic lunch.
As Captain Rogers brushed past him to head back into the music room Tony stared after him, something wild beginning to flutter within his chest. It felt like hope; because Tony had always been smarter than most and his mind put together quickly the things not said. Stefen had not expressly forbidden him to take the children out again.
“There wasn’t time to collect it.” The doctor admitted stiffly. Dvorak frowned, suitably unimpressed.
He didn’t want to know what made his children indestructible while others got to be vulnerable, but Kroger was looking at him, hope barely disguised in his eyes.
“The Sleeping Beauty came to Salzburg when my mother was alive. I was seven, but I remember, because I tried all day to convince her to take me with them. I cried and hid under my bed, because I thought if they heard I had run away that they would have to stay and look for me.”
Tony looked up from the journal he wasn’t truly paying much attention to and glanced out over the yard where Péter and his younger brothers were gathered together. Péter was showing them how to use stones in order to carve symbols on the trees. To what purpose Tony didn’t know, but they seemed to be enjoying themselves. It was a rare moment of peace between the brothers and for a moment Tony just sat and watched them, listening to their voices carry over the yard and let his heart fill with the full measure of affection and sorrow the moment seemed to warrant. He wished he could stop time for them, so that they would always be together. Always be just as safe and happy as they were now.
Father would have been horrified to hear her talk like that. Natacha never would have said it in front of him anyway because it would have just made him feel guilty because she couldn’t be innocent like Sara and Maria. Tony would have said something hopeful but naive, because he somehow didn’t know yet how bad the world really was. He still believed they could make a difference. Tony and her father shared a faith that try as she might, she just could not grasp.
It was another six hours before it died down enough that they could leave reasonably safely. They still had to be careful, as harsh voices and the sounds of another fight could still occasionally be heard. Tony and the children waited upstairs, rationing off what food Professor Sieger had in his pantry while Stefen stood sentinel at the door downstairs keeping an eye out for Harold with the car.
“I’m not leaving until you calm down.” He almost didn’t hear Péter say. His head had begun to throb with headache. Péter stepped in front of his sister, planting himself between them and glaring defiantly back at Steve. A flush of heat surged within him anew and lodging right between Steve’s temples, when it registered (of all things) that he didn’t have to look as far down as he was accustomed to.
“I’ll buy you others.” He managed to grunt as he grasped the hem of Tony’s undershirt and peeled off the offending barrier between them. He’d seen as much when they’d gone swimming, but it was somehow
“Don’t leave that lying around either,” Bucky barked from the corner. “Last thing we need is the Nazi’s getting ahold of that list.”
God, why hadn’t Coulson’s man made a move yet? Tony wondered irritably not for the first time as the night dragged on. He highly doubted Beutlin would be foolish enough – or brave enough for that matter – to hang around telling the children tall tales with the book on his person. Which meant there was still a danger the book would be discovered before it left the house, and Tony didn’t really think plausible deniability would be enough to save Steve in that case. Not now that he’d met Striker in the flesh and seen the way the man looked at Stefen.
He heard one of the girl’s gasp and sprang up, exhilaration pulling his lips into an almost feral grin.
“Jesus, Steve, he’s with Harry. Calm down.” Bucky ordered him, placing a hand on Natacha’s arm as she began to shrink beneath Steve’s stare. He was giving Steve a look like he’d lost his mind. “Péter’s old enough to take care of himself. Why are you shouting at her?”
It was only now, seeing him broken that Bucky began to understand, because he’d seen Steve broken the same way after Margrit died. He’d see it again if they lost the children. Everything that he was now, was built on his family and for them there was no loss too big. No sacrifice too great.
It was true, he and Rogers shared little in common, however they both had an eye for people. Rogers had known, god damn it, because he was the sort who listened and looked. He knew Dvořák's views on they way things were being handled. And Rogers had met his wife. He'd met Helena on several though brief occasions and had still managed to take away the truth of her parentage, or rather lack of one.
The man just stood there like a plank of wood, as seven pairs of eyes in various states of distress stared up at him, saying nothing. Finally he cleared his throat and nodded toward Frau Hogan who was standing behind Ian with her hands upon the boy’s shoulder.
“I received orders only this morning to escort the major to his post.” Dvorak announced firmly, watching the doctor's blank expression carefully. " My orders were also to give a full report on his condition when I found him. I am curious to know when this threat to Major Rogers life was discovered and why I was not informed?"
Steve bit into his arm, trying to muffle the sobs that wrenched through him. His face contorting, lungs seizing in protest as they took him. Years and years of loss and he had soldiered on but this, this empty room was more than he could bare.
“Get out! I want you out of my house.” Hammer was screeching, and Tony rolled his eyes, but then Hammer’s voice was too close, his hot beer-soaked breath breathing down Tony’s neck. “Did you hear what I said,
The captain had only left to go downstairs to sit with the landlord, Hans, and a few other men from the apartment unit at the door when it sounded like one of the HJ-Patrols was getting closer.
“You remind me of my brother. He’s very clever too,” Holmes finally replied after the silence had stretched uncomfortably long. He sounded bored, but there was just the slightest frisson of contempt in it – whether for the aforementioned brother or Tony himself – that told Tony he had the man where he wanted him.
“Péter your Da said he’d talk it over with Herr Stark and he will.” Bucky reminded him, but Péter didn’t seem to be in the mood for it.
Peggy could swim, was a strong swimmer in fact, but she’d always preferred to be on the shore where it was dry and comfortable. Not that she’d ever let a little thing like discomfort stop her. She was always first one in when Péter and Natacha wished to play, and last one out when Stefen didn’t feel like letting her go.
He’d never catch up to Ian on foot, but was he or wasn’t he a master builder? He was in a forest surrounded by wood. He could engineer a piece of aerodynamic wood for Christ's sake.
A ridiculous question. If this is what passes for journalism it’s no wonder the whole country has gone to the dogs.
The pleasure was intense. The heat in his belly winding tighter and tighter as they moved against each other, hands touching and breathes coming in short pants.
“This isn’t one of our gentleman's night’s after all.” The man said with a wink of hazel eyes and Charlotte jumped on Captain Khalmmers rescue as if he’d offered her absolution.
“Let’s do away with the formality shall we? I’m sure you’re all curious as to why I asked you here and I won’t keep you in suspense. I thought we’d focus on a special lesson this afternoon and it’s lengthy so let us get started. Please take your seats.”
Steve frowned, rejecting all the ideas that came to mind. He had no money besides Tony’s and he couldn’t use that. Tony was already paying for their survival; he shouldn’t have to pay for his own birthday gifts.
“You’re smart Péter Rogers.” Anamarie’s voice was hushed, barely perceptible under the pop and boom of the lightshow. She was staring straight ahead now so that if Péter had been watching them he might not even know she was talking to him. “And you behave like you know what it means to be a good person, but do you act on it?”
“You traveling far?” the fellow sitting to his left at the bar asked in Boarisch, and Bucky glared him down until he got the idea that Bucky wasn’t in the mood for any personal questions, tearing off another bite of the bread. The man was portly and nearly bald but for thin wisps of greying hair on both sides of his head. He looked away from Bucky so fast you would have thought Bucky was a bear, inclined to gobble him whole. Bucky flicked his eyes down to the fellow’s hands. Huh. No wedding band. A washed-up old bachelor, lonely enough to strike up a conversation with a stranger in a bar might just be what the doctor ordered.
"That is..." Tony, most unusually, found himself at a loss for words and wholly uncomfortable. He had no idea how they'd gotten from the subject of Bakhuizen onto marriage but he did not like it.
means to you. It wasn't until Bucky realized that I had this that he snapped. So I'm giving it back."
Tony slapped a hand to his chest in order to keep them from falling as the smiling housekeeper moved away – toward Sara who was crushing a doll with golden curls in a white dress to her chest – but Tony’s eyes stayed locked on the gleaming machine Hammer and Hogan were struggling to carry toward the kitchen, much to Willamina’s loud protests that her kitchen wasn’t a coffee bar.
He and James were clamoring around their father, splashing as they fought, almost viciously, for the place of honor on his shoulders. Stefen appeared to be largely ignoring the pulling and tugging around his neck, focused as he was with watching Maria paddle her way between him and Bakhuizen, proud as punch with her own progress. Their voices drifted over the water toward Tony and Ian and Tony smiled.
“Someone has to save what’s left,” Steve called to Sam’s back as the other man grabbed a hold of the railing, hopping the little step and leaned out to yell over the noise.
Steve did not blame the poor man for being afraid. The captain did not have to release him. Everyone knew (and mostly ignored) that the law had made it illegal for Jews to enter the country. But the unspoken social agreement to turn the head and look in the other direction only went so far. To stick his neck out like this, this man must have desperately needed the promised reward. Steve knew something about that. He was taking a risk himself being there, but it was equally necessary. The man (Steve had not been told his name) had come to the station with information, but he only spoke Polish.  Captain Altera had contacted the emigration delegation, looking for a translator. Tony’s cousin Benjamino had insisted on having Steve’s help since Tony was preoccupied teaching that afternoon.
As of the beginning of this week FIOT is at bootcamp training to be a United States marine, which I honestly couldn't be more proud (and scared of). We wanted to bring you this extra long chapter to tide you over the three months she'll be off the grid, and the time it will take us to regroup and put together chapter 10 which could unfortunately mean something like a four month break for the fic.
Or was it just cold to think of Stefen alone, surrounded by the enemy, the last man standing on the sinking ship of decency with no one standing by to save the drowning?
"Line up now children. Quickly now, we mustn't miss the train." One of the ladies from the Kindertransport called out over the bustle, she and her companion impressively managing to herd their small horde of young charges in an orderly fashion to line up outside the doors. Deiter glanced back toward the table where his own charges sat, spine stiffening in alarm when he was met with the sight of an empty table. He didn't immediately panic, noting that all of their coats remained in their chairs suggesting that they'd merely gotten up to use the toiletries rather than leave the establishment altogether.
"I don't mind you missing dinner tonight, Ian. Today’s not been easy on anybody. But it would have been nice to see you,” his father said as he rummaged through his drawer, retrieving a little sewing kit. Thankfully he didn't say anything about how many buttons were gone. He just held a hand out, palm turned up as Ian dropped all seven of them into his hand.
To Tony’s relief the children’s protests were immediate, each of them clamoring to be heard over the other as they insisted they wouldn’t be too sad, that they’d be extra good, if only he would teach them how. Always willing to bank on luck when it was on his side, Tony secured their promises to be on their best behavior, starting with bidding their father and Sam farewell with no more tears and hysterics.
"I need to see the abbot!" Tony immediately demanded, and the severe looking monk reared back, his eyes widening in shocked recognition.
But hell if he trained Maria to be nothing more than a forgettable singer with a great chest. She wanted to sing? Tony would train her up into something truly great! No use doing something half way. No doubt his eyes had taken on a mad gleam because Pepper cleared her throat loudly.
Tony got the bright idea to go see the abbot, yes right then and there because he insisted he needed to be
Stefen led them to a small, cluttered looking shop with chipped paint that read Herr Tuck’s Essentials and Delights.
“Oh sweet Jesus,” Tony cursed, and he thought he heard a huff of laughter punch out of Stefen’s chest but the sound was lost amidst their desperate pants for breath as they thrust against each other, movements frantic and without rhythm. Stefen gave him no choice, caging Tony’s body with his, pulling him into each powerful thrust in a mad rush to completion. It was the euphoria of children consuming a sweet delight in a single swallow and all Tony could do was hold on, arm thrown over Stefen’s neck and hand fisted tightly in his shirt as the pleasure built and built.
Beneath his cheek he could feel the way Stefen stilled, and the careful way in which the captain took his next breath as his hand came up to cradle the back of Tony's neck, fingers brushing the curling hair on his nape in the gentlest of touches.
Hi! We hope that you are staying safe and healthy wherever you are in the world, and we apologize for the LONG wait. For anyone still hanging in for an update after six months, we hope this nice FAT two part chapter will fill you up and brighten the days ahead. Although, we have to warn you that there is some pretty heavy material ahead. As you can imagine, escaping on foot across mountain terrain with small children isn't a lark. So buckle in, the  Rogers have a capital JOURNEY ahead. Warnings for the usual period typical phobias as well as child endangerment, starvation, whiffs of child marriage and non-con, fictionalized depictions of PTSD and its varied symptoms, and flashbacks to torture.
Only it wasn’t. And as if to underscore that point there was a clatter somewhere inside the building and Steve swung around eyes darted over the darkened kitchen.
Ian sat up, suddenly very alert in his chair, dropping his knife with a resounding clatter that startled the table so keenly caught on the unfolding drama.
The light faded and was gone completely as Harold turned the car and drove down the road off to parts unknown.
He stood between her desk and her bedroom door with such unapologetically masculine authority, so confident in where he stood, that it caused a fresh wave of anger to rise up within her. Perhaps it was a front, an armor of sorts, to approach the world as if one was always certain of themselves and the right path, but she’d never asked him to wear it. She’d have made a safe place for him. For them both.  She knew what all women knew, that the path of right ran in whatever direction men chose and they left it to others to clear the rubble.
Stark eyed him, his eyes roving, searching Steve's face for something. Steve stood still and let him, his body practically humming under the scrutiny. After a moment Stark seemed to find what he was looking for and nodded.
Tony tugged Stefen to a stop just as he reached the door, pointing to the window where a row of painted dolls in brightly colored frocks were looking out. Along with the delicate porcelain dolls on display were all sorts of baubles and odds and ends. A set of leather banded watches sat next to display of coral beads the same red as Tony’s vest and beside them a whole selection of multicolored neck-ties.
Steve huffed out a laugh that made his head swim, dizzy with relief, feeling lighter than he had in months. He didn’t have to go this alone. He’d have done it, had been prepared to do it, but having Bucky at his side made even the impossible feel possible.
Steve didn’t like it, but there was no good reason to deny her (and he knew that Tony would demand a reason). He grabbed his own coat, following as she opened the door and stepped out into the fresh snow that had covered the garden walk.
The captain’s door was first a few paces down the hall, from the top of the stairs Tony could see the telltale flicker of light beneath the door that spoke of a lit fireplace. It was warmer on the second floor and more lights were lit in general, but Tony couldn’t keep his brain from imagining the worst as he crept toward the closed door. Thieves had come and had murdered the family in their beds and were now burning the evidence. The SS had figured out his identity and traced him back to Stefen and the family. Or maybe they’d come for Stefen due to any one of the numerous pots full of treason the captain had his fingers stuck in. Tony didn’t know how he and Péter were going to take on armed men with just a kitchen knife and their wits but –
boy in oversized army dregs could not have been over the age of fourteen, regardless of what he’d told the recruiters when he’d enlisted. Illness aside if he had looked like a child, Tony had no doubt it was because he had been one. The thought filled him with a sadness, for the nameless boys who had filled the ranks of Austria’s army with no less passion or fervor, whose lives had been expended in war bitterly lost, for boys too young to comprehend the gift of their childhood.
"It means you have no family." Wanda's eyes lifted from the dirt and caught his. Their dark pools looked bottomless as she stared into him and continued to speak, softly and slowly.
Kurt bobbed on the balls of his feet and lowered his head to whisper somewhat dramatically, “I thought you’d be on tour. Otherwise I can’t see why you haven't come for a cup, Captain.”
Farkas didn't respond to the tirade. He leaned back in his chair, and continued to observe Tony thoughtfully withy his one eye.
“Oof! Beg pardon Frauline Rogers. I didn’t see you there.” She quickly apologized. Her eyes flickered nervously to the door of father’s room and the young woman shifted back, as if the thing were a snake uncoiling to strike. “You shouldn’t be seeing the Major right now, Miss. They say he’s got the fever. The whole house has to empty. I wouldn’t stay another moment if I didn’t want to see you and your siblings off safely.”
Steve didn’t want to disappoint them – they’d been disappointed by so much already – but he shuddered at the thought of his children playing on the ice when he wasn’t at full strength. What if the ice broke and he wasn’t able to get to them in time?
These waters were safer than not while Italy still claimed neutrality in the conflict, but neither country was foolish enough to leave them unpoliced, and the fear of suddenly being fired upon hung over their heads. If Tony strained his ears, at times he could catch snippets from the radio, which brought harrowing tales of German forces beating back allied troops and gaining more ground by the day.
Steve’s hand shook with the effort to resist grabbing the side table beside the chair and throwing it across the room. It wouldn’t be enough, he knew. If he started he wouldn’t be satisfied until he’d broken every last object in the room.
“Of course,” Tony responded, putting on a brave face, but privately he thought that tomorrow was too late. He only had four more days to figure out a way to keep the family together, and Tony didn’t doubt that if the banks were already throwing up superfluous obstacles in front of their Jewish patrons, then the seizure of their bank accounts couldn’t be far behind it.
The truck rolled along the uneven road and Steve bumped along with it, his breaths sharp and short in his chest with every jostle.
“Leave it,” Willamina insisted, clucking her tongue as she grabbed Natacha by the shoulders, pulling her firmly to her feet despite her dogged resistance. “No lamb, just leave it. Hortense get the broom.”
The floorboards creaked as Maria shifted her weight up onto her toes. She leaned against the arm of the chair to stare at him with wide pitiful eyes. Rubbing his sore neck with a grimace, Tony sat up. He’d positioned the chair facing the door so that he could watch for danger in the night. But now, pale morning sunlight streamed in between the cracks in the window shutters. Judging by the absence of wind pressing against the walls and the stillness of the air around them he thought the storm must have passed. Bucky's tracks were surely long buried in the snow by now. Which was good, because it meant for the present that they were untraceable. Tony tried not to think any more about the storm or the fact that Bucky could easily have driven off the road in it.
"Are you sure you're up for this Darling?" Charlotte murmured in his ear, her breath misting hotly over his skin pulling his focus back to the endeavor at hand as Virgina and Harrold ambled off arm in arm towards their cottage. Charlotte had her arm in his and was looking up at him with concern. In truth Steve was already feeling a bit worn from the morning's activity but looking around him at the children's eager faces and the way they were already darting about, this way and that as they enjoyed the snow, there was nothing to do but smile and bear it.
“That was beautiful. Wasn’t it, love?” he crooned into Stefen’s ear, pressing tender kisses against the soft skin at his neck. Stefen’s body violently shivered and a tear hot and wet slipped from his eye before he buried his face against Tony’s neck, shuddering as if it were sub temperatures within the room.
Péter was still trembling with rage but Bobby's sharp elbow jabbed into his side and he did as the other boys did and raised his hand in salute.
Glancing at Steve, who shrugged in reply, Joshua relented, handing a silk tie to Artur who immediately crouched and set to work.
He stuck his head out of the alley and saw that there was indeed a pair of officers standing not far up the road but they were standing outside the doors of a bar, one of them helping the other to light a cigarette and not looking.
“We’re taking full control of Czechoslovakia? Won’t Poland retaliate?” It wasn't really a question. Of course they were taking Czechoslovakia. It had only been a matter of time once they’d been given a footing into the country. And of course Poland would protest, behind hemmed in on both sides by German forces. There would be fighting on the borders, and the Germans would use that as an excuse to retaliate with an invasion.
Certainly Virginia had taken a liking to him and he'd yet to find a better judge of character than her.
“-completely ignoring your chosen curriculum, singing and dancing like the house is a circus, excursions into town! The children came back in such a state I’m sure something must have happened but they won’t say. The children are terrified of him Captain.”
A weak lie. Charlotte’s mother felt much the same way her sister had felt about Steve dirtying their family line. It was only the various awards and promotions that helped her swallow the bitter pill.
A moment later Stefen stood in the doorway as imposing a figure as ever despite his hanging suspenders, rolled up sleeves and untucked shirt. Tony blinked in surprise at the man's rumpled state. It wasn't as undone as he'd been on the lake (and not nearly as undone as Tony wanted to undo him) but leisure certainly agreed with the man.
Maybe it was because Peter didn’t have to go because he had to pack to leave for school in the morning. Ian could understand that. James wasn't the only one that was going to miss Peter. Still he didn't throw a tantrum whenever he felt like it was too much, Ian thought savagely as another book went airborne. Even Sara didn’t act out like this and she was only three.
“I see a scenario, that when considered at face value has an easy answer. You’re wrong Péter, if only because some questions don’t have easy answers and you didn’t bother to ask any. You failed to take into account that there are only two weeks left in this month.”
She didn't say anything and neither did he, suddenly choked up by the return of tears. He was awful glad to see her again. He hadn't realized how much until this very moment. He hugged her back, squeezing hard, only managing a numb nod of acknowledgment as Harold put arms around them both and held them tight.
Tony felt a twist of something painful in his chest, reminded suddenly of what the children had let slip about the infamous Frauline Glass when she’d been their governess. Tony had almost forgotten his assumptions that the captain must have been sleeping with the woman, but watching the woman slip into his private quarters when she had no other reason to be there brought it rushing back.
“Presto, presto. We're being asked to march. Let’s clear the front hall and get everyone settled in." Herr Stark continued cheerfully, and the children flocked to him, dragging their suitcases and lining up before him like well-trained puppies. Charlotte would have smiled if she were not so focused on Stark.
"But what about dinner?" James immediately protested, red head popping up from the floor. Stefen's weary blue eyes rested on him just long enough to answer.
His father was standing with the baroness who was doing her best to hold up conversation in the small little group who had collected around them, but it was obvious to him even from across the room that Da wasn't hearing a word that anyone said to him. His eyes kept mapping the room, settling on each of their faces briefly before flicking on to the next and Ian knew that he was counting them again.
Ian didn’t have to be looking at Tony to know he’d tensed in his seat. It was something he could just feel in the air. When he did look he was not surprised by the stillness of his expression or the unspoken anger he seemed to be holding back behind clenched teeth. Tony didn’t believe him either.
"Should we really do this here?” Stefen wondered as Tony’s hands began to undo his belt. It was a token protest clearly, because he did absolutely nothing to stop Tony’s deft fingers getting inside his briefs and finding their way to the hard cock straining inside them.
"That's a very considerate present Artur,” he acknowledged instead with a serious nod. He was sure there was mirth dancing about in his eyes but Artur didn’t seem to mind it as he beamed back at Tony.
The doctors observed keenly, their pens scratching as they took frantic notes, until a man came to remind them that the general wasn’t a patient man.  They had the body dragged out, but their spirits were high. One subject lost but such promising results.
With a slow release of breath and a flick of his wrist he tossed his cigarette aside and Steve watched as it landed on the stair and Bucky smothered the glowing end with the toe of his boot.
“Is that a fact?” Stefen pulled back to give him a look that said apples did not fall far from the tree.
There was something wrong with the captain. It was as if the man he had written too in the past months had sent a pod person home instead. There had been little glimmers of the Stefen Rogers Tony thought he'd been getting to know, but the Captain had been mostly withdrawn all day and into the evening.
! I do not march after orders just because you shout them. Your butler made it impossible for me to go into town and get the children’s supplies without leaving them alone for the day, and unlike some I do not take breaking my promises to them lightly.”
He finds Doctor List by the computer and sneaks up to him. Once the Doctor notices him there, he blasts him unconscious.
Tony looks at the man's little mad work and can’t come up with simple answers. “What the hell did you do to me?” Tony pants.
Suddenly, a heavy force strikes on top of the jet, like a horse landing on it, shaking it on its spot in the clouds. Tony turns around and puts his helmet on, assuming position.
He plainly ignores her and goes for his right wrist. “Fuck!” Tony yells, shaking it, once he notices Steve fucking Rogers is still on his wrist.
“Yes. Nothing to worry about,” she reassures. “As I was saying, he's asked me to tell you if you could, perhaps, come by the Stark Tower?” she asks.
Steve rolls up the sleeves of his shirt and gets in position, then he pulls. The hammer makes a noise as if it's being dragged through the glass of the table but it's just a slight, minimal movement.
Steve raises his eyebrows at the sudden voice but then smiles politely, although he’s not sure where to point his smile to. “Good evening…” Steve trails off, losing for a moment the computer's name, before he recalls it honors one of Peggy’s closest friend. “Jarvis,” he ends, in an asking tone.
"Isn't the whole point of being a master spy to be transparent in your questioning? 'Cause, let me tell you, you're kinda obvious," Steve says.
Rhodey's mind is so far away from Syria and Yemen and Kuwait, it's literally the only silver-lining to this thing. "No, no," he shakes his head and Tony relaxes a bit. "It was mostly just surveillance work, no real action, thank God," he adds, looking at his fingers.
“But, hey, you have experience with crazy, untested procedures, right? So,” Tony says, smiling. Offering, wondering.
“Tones?” Rhodey calls, walking inside slowly. His friend turns to him in surprise and locks eyes with him.
Tony smiles in the privacy of his room at the image of Steve. His dreams really did the captain no justice.
Tony feels like slapping himself in the forehead. God, he's just a whole ass idiot when he's near Steve, isn't he?
Tony quirks an eyebrow. “How do you know so much about him? Oh my god, platypus, do you have a crush?” he says, batting his eyelashes.
"You know I wouldn't mock you, Tones. I'm just really proud of you," Rhodey says, then he puts his arm around Tony's shoulder and gives him a little hug. "You did it. Both you and Pepper," Rhodey adds, smiling down at the floor.
Tony gives her half a smile and turns back around. He suddenly considers whether she maybe isn't here for the reason he thinks.
Sam closed the door behind him quietly and Tony wrapped his arms around himself, like bracing himself.
And Rhodey actually has a younger sister back home, but he’s always wanted a little brother, too. So he dusts off Tony’s knees when he falls —and
Next to the laptop he finds the package Nick talked about. He takes one more look to his wrist and hopes to find answers in the yellow folder as he rips it open, but all he finds is sadder news.
Tony looks down to the floor, he knows that kind of determination to kill something you've created once you realize its potential for evil.
"Sounds like a hell of a fight. Sorry I missed it," Sam says after Steve's done telling him the story of the latest HYDRA base they found.
"You're not still pissed off about the Switzerland thing, are you?" asks Tony, watching warily as Killian lays down his briefcase on the table in front of him.
“The man’s gonna try to get reelected. He thinks this might help him get half the public,” General Blendis says.
Pepper takes a deep breath, opens her mouth to say something, then closes it and smiles, shaking her head just once. “You know what— it’s alright, I mean, I kinda already knew you’ve fucked your way around about fifty percent of Earth’s population, right?” Pepper says, but her voice sounds rough.
They exchange handshakes and then Rhodey’s mother goes: “Honey, we should get going. Your father went to get the car, he wants to take us to that place you like on Parker Street,” she says.
Tony looks down to his side and realizes the spot he’s on, if the blood stain is any indication of it.
There’s a huge crowd, covering half of the block to the house, along with TV crew and police officials. Rhodey has to wave his hand at who he knows to be Jarvis from pictures like a maniac before he gets spotted.
Rhodey scoffs a little. “Right, because brainwashed serial killers are exactly my type,” he says sarcastically.
“Jury’s out,” Tony barely addresses him. “You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?” he asks Banner.
Rhodey quirks one eyebrow. "You're telling me you guys kiss each other regularly now and you practically came all the way here for him, but you ain't dating? Sounds fake," Rhodey says.
Tony’s eyes flicker for a second and Steve can’t hope to feel like he knows him enough to sense something isn’t right.
“We’re just getting started,” reads in arabic with English subtitles under them. There’s a logo with ten circles and blades.
"Stark? I'm talking about the Mandarin," Rhodey says, with a shake of his head. "Trust me, Tony's alive out there, somewhere, and he's— playing cowboy. He's not thinking clearly. He's a sitting duck," he adds before walking out of the room, ready to get into his suit.
“Pepper and Rhodey,” Tony clarifies. “Pepper hasn’t met her soulmate and Rhodey has this thing where he has his mark appears and disappears from time to time.”
“Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunnelling effect,” Tony retorts, walking towards him.
Steve's just pissed and helpless, so he rips a log in half with his hands in frustration and Tony stands silent.
“Work hard,” Pepper whispers before giving him hug. “Any chance you driving by La Guardia?” she asks Agent guy, reaching him by the elevator.
“Are you sure about this?” Tony asks in the quietness of the Tower living room. The New York skyline lights in the reflection of his eyes, deep dark as the sky itself right now.
Rhodey gets to the Tower by 5 PM and finds it completely remodeled. The darkened windows are clear and they show New York’s landscape in its bright blue-filled sky.
Tony waves him off. “Oh, please, like she’s gonna last more than two weeks with me. You really believe there’s anyone other than you and Jarvis capable of standing me for more than a few months?” he asks, rhetorically.
"I have a prosthetic," he says, but his voice sounds rusty. The security lady at the entrance makes a doubtful face so he shows her a hand, waving vaguely.
Tony blinks and nods as he takes a few steps towards him. "Yeah—hey, how did you get here? Did Pepper contact you?" he asks.
He stuffs his hands in the pockets of his jacket, pulling down, and breathes in the air of fresh fruit and flowers. He likes Vidin, so much he knows it’s soon gonna be time to leave.
"We haven't even talked salary yet," Killian says, getting up from the stool and walking over to him. He puts a hand on Tony's throat and squeezes just tight enough for it too hurt. "What kind of perk package are you thinking of?" he whispers at Tony's mouth, his eyes glowing.
It's been almost two months since he gathered the strength to kiss Tony first. Almost two months of them slowly coming to terms with their whole 'bound by the universe to be together' thing.
“He wants to know what you think,” the old man translates for Tony after they walk through the place.
Maybe everybody assumes that the whole soulmate deal is easy business. By God, Steve himself thought it’d be like that. But reality had other plans. Mainly his soulmate not being that into him.
Tony nods and swallows, knowing better than to say anything. He knows in his heart he can't hold a grudge against Steve for long.
Yu frowns and crosses his arm over his chest. "You talk like you know something we don't, Colonel," he says.
“Or maybe it’s just trouble getting into you,” Rhodey says, his tongue rolling lazily inside his mouth. Consumed by the power of the 0.02% of alcohol on his system, he tilts his head and smiles far too fondly at his former roommate.
Bruce blinks again and takes a step towards him. “You—don’t like him? You just said you’ve never seen him before, how can you not like him if you don’t know him?” he asks, frowning.
He shakes his head at the thought and looks at the pamphlet again— the guy had given it to him once he noticed him staring and he had found the Smithsonian Institution in no time.
“Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy,” Tony says, glad to have finally finished his latest project.
“Hey,” Steve says, quietly coming in. He’s holding a tablet in his hands. “Anything interesting?” he asks, lifting his chin at the Scepter being scanned.
Then he shoots at them in the car but they're quick to dodge. The car breaks abruptly and he flies off from it, landing on the pavement with the help of the arm.
Tony’s smiling façade fades slowly, replaced with a somewhat somber expression. He looks down, tired, but unashamed. His shoulders are curved down and he looks tiny. The angle works enough for Steve to see Tony’s lower lip tremble, like breathing makes him shake.
"Why don't you hug her and find out?" Natasha says, softer than Tony's ever seen her and the girl throws herself at her.
"Because you're War Machine, he's the Winter Soldier", Allen replies with a shrug, putting the file on the desk and laying back on his chair.
Tony looks immensely better than the last time he saw him, which was a few days after he got his chest surgery.
He kneels next to Steve and reaches for his chest, for his heart, for his neck, to feel his pulse, to know he's not dead and taken Tony's heart with him.
When Steve begins to see what it all is, he almost wants to scream in full-excitement: in the table, slightly inclined down to be in a diagonal position, there’s a wide white sheet of paper and next to it there’s a wider table, with about thirty carbon pencils in all shades of black and grey along with an extensive collection of color pencils.
"What happened?" Maya finally says, rhetorically. "Fun fact. Before he built rockets for the Nazis, the idealistic Wernher von Braun dreamed of space travel. He stargazed," she says, letting out a soft chuckle. "Do you know what he said when the first V-2 hit London? ‘The rocket performed perfectly— it just landed on the wrong planet.'" Maya's eyes are glassy, like she's going to cry.
He could feel Tony's thighs start to get shaky so he decides it's time for him to return the care. He places his hands on each of Tony's hips and starts to meet him in every thrust, pulling really sinful noises out of him.
“Sorry— have to check on the suit,” Tony mumbles as he stumbles his way through the crowd outside the restaurant.
Tony doesn't even hesitate as he speaks to the cameras and microphones. There's only the thought of Happy lying on a bed, fighting for his life, in his head.
Then they get on to interviewing the fifteen applicants on the job position to aid Mr. Stark in running a multibillion-dollar company, a list which consists, roughly, of ten really under-qualified women who get caught up in Tony’s flirting championship far too easy, and other five interesting ones.
Seeing Tony’s parents be laid down in the ground, to the sound of a joint service drum corps, gave Rhodey a little perspective. He took a look at the single name –or last name—on his wrist and sighed. There are worst things in life than having absolutely no clue who your soulmate could be.
“Why don’t you go say hello? Maybe get him out of there,” she asks, and Tony tries his best not to wrinkle his nose at her.
Steve moves his hands across Tony's torso, his ribs, his chest, his shoulders. He moves his hands to Tony's back and he pulls the zipper of the underarmor jumpsuit slowly.
“You smug little shit,” Rhodey says as soon as he sees the little purple mark on Álvarez collarbone when he steps out of the shower with only his sleeping white t-shirt.
“Oh, thank you,” Rhodey mutters, kissing her on her forehead before grabbing the cup and inhaling the warm smell. He takes one long sip, then throws the pill into the cup and turns back to Pepper. “So, where were you last night?”
“I'm gonna miss him though. And you're gonna miss me. There's gonna be a lot of manful tears,” Tony trails, pressing the button for his car to park in front of him.
But there’s a bigger part of him that cries just at the thought of him standing across him. Ashamed and disappointed at what he’s become.
“I didn’t realize it was me who was supposed to do the talking,” Tony replies, changing his approach.
He walks around the car with hard struts and stops by the passenger seat door. Without looking, he slides the hand inside and finds a pulsing neck. One squeeze and it ends.
“Yesterday it was,” Tony mutters. “If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?”
“We’re good to go on this end. The rest is up to you,” he tells Pepper over the line as he flies through New York buildings.
“With everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old fashioned,” Coulson says, almost nostalgic.
Steve just shakes his head and shifts in his spot to lean closer to Tony. "Tony—  don't take this badly but I really couldn't care less about your dad," he says, honest to God, with a hand on Tony's knee. "Not if he didn't treat you the way he was supposed to. The Howard I knew was a good man, yes, but if he turned into less than that later on in his life then," Steve shrugs. "He did. I care about you more than I ever cared about him," he finishes.
“Feels good, yeah? I mean, you've been after this thing since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed,” Tony says, talking about their last couple of busy months. “Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but—“
Pepper's mouth hangs open just slightly and then she blinks. "Your boss works for the Mandarin, you think? But Tony says you're a botanist—"
Tony doesn't even bother to open his eyes again. "That's lame. The worst idea ever. Whoever thought that? Nope," Tony replies, giving Steve another peck.
The Captain however isn’t taking the bait. “Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around,” he says.
Tony ducks his head around to get Steve to look at him. “Hey, I’m not dying,” Tony assures. Malibu is a 6-hour flight from New York, sure, but at least it’s still the same country.
“I'm from a small town called Gulmira. It's a nice place,” Yinsen says, shaking dices inside his hand while they play.
“Would you like a drink? Virgin Sex on the Beach?” Tony offers, making his way towards the bar to the right of the living room.
"I remember the night, not the morning," Tony says, his eyebrows raised. "Is this what you've been chasing around?" he adds when Maya's mouth hangs open.
“Yeah. I told him I knew someone who knew him and he knew it was Steve—“ Rhodey lowers his head as he goes: “I asked him if he wanted me to tell him where he was and he said no.”
“And you'll get your Cube back, no muss, no fuss— what is Phase 2?” Tony asks, once his screen shows him the secured files.
“Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in,” Thor says, his eyes closing a bit. Maria and Rhodey exchange a look. “Her work on the Convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer,” Thor adds.
They both turn to look at Steve for a brief second and then Tony looks down and Rhodey looks at him.
Then the bearded man speaks again, his voice raised higher, as he opens up a piece of paper he was holding in his hand.
“Fuck. We’re all stressed out here, aren’t we? And to think we actually won today,” Tony tries to joke, rubbing Steve’s neck. “Well, except for Barton, maybe,” Tony adds, looking over his shoulder to the doctors still working on their teammate.
He bites Tony's lower lip, pulling just a little and Tony shivers. "I wanna fuck you now," Steve confesses.
Tony stands, takes one look at himself, in his dirty baggy pants, white t-shirt, covered in oil and dust and smoke. He smiles widely and curses Pepper in his head. “So, what brings you by?” he asks, putting his hands together.
Steve has an amused smile on his face as he puts coffee into the modern coffee machine. Look at that.
“You know, we might be more productive if you include me in the planning process,” the man says, kneeling beside him.
"What exactly is it about this guy that makes you think he's not worthy of our attention?" Allen tries, sounding like he wants to roll his eyes but won't because he's still a subordinate.
“How many languages do you speak?” he asks the man who’s become his sort of companion, trying to gather more information about their captors, a day later.
’—are you kidding me? What, because you didn’t die? D’you think I’m an idiot?” Rhodes says, clearly upset. “The desert changed you, Tony. Don’t stand there pretending that it didn’t. You know I know you better than that. Hell, I know all this shit better than that. You have no idea how many people I’ve seen go and come back broken,” he says and Steve feels like he’s part of a too personal conversation, but doesn’t know where to go, so he just stands still and looks down at the floor.
Harley smiles at Tony and nods happily, before running back to the celebration room, where everyone is gathered.
“I’m sorry,” he says out loud, and puts his face into his palms and cracks, his back rolling down the door until he falls on the floor, his legs open, bent to support his elbows as he cries into his hands.
Tony just moves one shoulder up. “Look, I have the time and the resources. It’s nothing. We saved the world, the least we deserve is getting a place that’s perfectly made for each of us. Plus I get to have fun with my interior design awakening,” he adds, joking to make the air lighter and Steve concedes with a huff. “So? You like it? You know, I’ve had to base most of the stuff here on Google searches for you? Google is–,”
"Are you okay?" Tony asks, suddenly, looking at Rhodey's hands with a frown. Rhodey realizes he's been absent-mindedly rubbing his wrist this whole time.
Rhodes puts the phone back inside his pocket and sighs. “Intelligence claims he’s a member of our little fun group there,” the Colonel says sarcastically, as he tips his chin up towards the footage, where the logo of the terrorist group is shown. “High level,” he adds.
He hits the streets of New York but they look like no place he’s ever been, it’s all flashes and light and cars that look smaller and shinier than he’s ever seen. He runs one block before it all becomes too much too handle.
“Your eyes are red,” it’s the first thing he notices when he sees Pepper, in all her work dress-suit gear, like no time has passed and she’s ready to go back headfirst into work, good. “Few tears for your long lost boss?” he adds.
Leaving absolutely no trace behind, his wrist is now empty, clear, James-less. He repeats the same process he did months ago, when he got it: threw the towel to the ground and searched in every corner of his body.
After some eighty minutes of sitting just staring at the wall and contemplating how absurdly ridiculous his life turned out to be, he steps out, finds a plaid shirt and a nice brown leather jacket on the fully-stocked closet and decides he needs to take a walk. Or maybe twenty.
He stops just by the end of the hall and turns to see Rogers’ not moving, just standing there in front of the closed door, looking at the floor.
“Means the portal won't collapse on itself, like it did at SHIELD,” Tony continues to explain, then spots Thor standing all mighty, looking at Tony like he’s the alien. “No hard feelings, Point Break. You've got a mean swing,” Tony tells him, tapping on his bicep. “Also, it means the portal can open as wide and stay open as long as Loki wants,” he adds.
“And how is President Ellis responding? By taking the guy they call War Machine and giving him a paint job,” Rhodey hears in the background TV as he sips his coke.
He puts his flying suit, with his brand new Second Lieutenant insignia, in his bag. And with a big smile on his face, he takes the flight to Pueblo, Colorado.
Out of the bar, with almost shaky steps, Tony appears, frown on his face. He looks slightly less dirty than the last time Steve saw him but just as disheveled and unrested. It makes Steve heart shrink a little.
Steve laughs softly a little more and then turns to him. Then he leans in and kisses him on the cheek. "We'll get through this," he says, looking into Tony's eyes. Then he takes a breath and smiles a smile Tony's never seen before. "And then, I'm gonna—"
“A nuclear deterrent,” Tony interrupts Fury. “’Cause that always calms everything right down,” he adds, sarcastically.
Tony had loved Ana Jarvis like a slightly young grandmother, just about two times less than he loves Jarvis but he remembers vividly how he cried for three days straight when she passed and how he’d tell his mother he wanted to go live with Jarvis after the butler took a five months leave.
“So why didn't SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project? I mean, what are they doing in the energy business in the first place?” Banner concludes.
“Well, I never got around thanking you for the help with the suit back at the Vanko attack,” Rhodey says and she waves him off. Rhodey takes a look around at the table and opens his mouth to say something but then doesn’t, instead gives a somewhat of a helpless look to his best friend.
"Oh, c'mon, don't sell yourself short, Rhodes. You run with the Avengers!" he says, and Rhodey reflects on the fact that this is the most talkative he's ever seen Yu.
Something in Steve’s inside bends and twists, distracting him enough to not remember to stop himself when he reaches for Tony’s face, hands on both of Tony’s cheeks, and asks softly: “Tony, are you okay?”
It's been months since Steve moved to Washington and Tony started flying there just randomly so they could— well, whatever it was they did. Rhodey kinda blocked Tony's babble in case it was a little TMI.
Natasha turns quickly, a tiny smirk on her lips. “I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes,” she says, extending her hand so Steve gives her the tablet. “How are we looking?”
"HYDRA should be our focus. They should be the target. If I go after Barnes, I'll take out one head, sure, but..." he trails for Allen to follow.
"Don't tell Rhodey you said that, by the way," Tony says after the kiss, bringing Steve back a little from his head. "He's a bit of a puritan, says only the original trilogy is worth watching," Tony adds, waving a hand off.
Álvarez blinks once but then he half-opens his mouth to say something, struggles to find his words and then closes it.
“I’m gonna head to Washington now. Wanted to check in with you before I went to Bagdad, again,” he says before Tony leans in for a hug that lasts just a little longer than regular hugs.
was wrong. Captain America ain’t shit. “You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle,” he adds, just loud enough for it not be yelled, a few inches away from his face.
He takes a deep breath and runs a hand through his hair, damp with sweat, and sits up straight, looking at the floor.
Tony just shrugs but his smile doesn’t break. “I’m just glad the world isn’t on fire anymore,” he says.
Pepper parks her car after having the most awkward business meeting she’s had in years; her time as Tony’s assistant included.
How will he stay in touch though? “He doesn’t have my number,” he mutters to himself, getting the keys to his bike out of his jacket pocket. ‘How is he gonna contact me if he doesn’t have my number or my address?’ Steve thinks again, but he starts the engine of his bike and rides it through the –for now—peaceful streets of New York.
"Oh, God. That's cute. Shall we book for a June wedding?" Tony says and Rhodey chuckles, nodding. "What about you?"
