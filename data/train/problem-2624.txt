He was on his feet once more, head tipped towards the sky, basking in the warm glow of the afternoon light. The sun’s rays caught at his hair like a lovers hands and Dean fought back a sigh of relief, of sadness, of longing.
“Yes Sam,” Cas replied absently, not looking up from the knife he was fiddling with, “See you there.”
He should’ve known better, especially after he’d nearly collapsed from heat exhaustion in the first few days of working on the house. He’d thrown himself straight into the job, not giving himself time to formulate any kind of plan. Not giving himself time to think. Thinking was dangerous; letting his mind wander off and reflect on his trauma, on Castiel’s... No, he’d needed a distraction. The physical demands of hard manual labour had at least kept his mind occupied.
And the brand of salvation burning on his skin - the Righteous Man, touched by an angel. The same handprint that now stained his jacket bloody.
Dean straightened, abandoning the 45 he’d been dismantling and moved over to survey the Devil’s Trap. Cas was right, the paint hadn’t so much as bled. But then Dean had never expected it to; Sam had traced it with a permanent solution.
Dean swore to himself that no matter how long it took, no matter the lengths he would have to go to, he would see Castiel again. And when he did, he intended to drag him out of the darkness and cover his soul with his handprints.
In the beginning, he had tried to encourage Cas to help him with some of the easier jobs, hoping it would distract him from the terrors that plagued him but, more often than not, he refused.
He supposed his first move would be the obvious one. But it was the only one he really wanted to make. With Jack taking on the role of God, his task of liberating Cas from The Empty seemed fractionally less intimidating. They would find a way.
It had been harder to hide in the bunker. It was obvious Cas needed time to readjust and his brother had readily accepted it would be a gradual process but six weeks later and their family and friends were all under the impression that things were steadily improving.
All Dean saw was the gaping rift that separated them, growing ever wider with each passing day. There were nights when Cas would startle awake, wide-eyed and pale. Dean’s touch, once so soothing, saw him cringing away in disgust, scrambling across the room with a cry of despair. He would tear at his clothes, his face, his hair and beg someone to wake him. He had even lashed out at Dean; raking his nails across the hunter’s jaw in an attempt to stall his approach. There was nothing he could do but look on, desperately trying to reason with Cas, to make him understand that he was real. That their life together was real.
Dean’s guilt was a living creature, clawing at his insides. Whenever he looked at Cas and saw doubt cloud his vision, it tore another strip from his bones. He was the reason for Cas’ suffering. He was prolonging the torment. But he couldn’t bear the thought of setting Cas free. It was selfish, despicable but Dean had never allowed himself to hold onto anything before. He was always forced to let go when all he really wanted was for someone to stay.
They’d never discussed Cas’ parting words and yet Dean felt as if he owed it to Cas to be the one that saved him. Not just physically but mentally as well. Somehow he had to prove he was worthy of Cas’ love, prove that even though he hadn’t said it back, of course he felt the same way. Maybe he hadn’t realised it until that moment but afterwards, it had seemed so obvious it was laughable.
“Jeez Cas, did you only just notice?” Dean threw over his shoulder with a laugh, “I thought the wings would’ve given it away but...”
He refused to look over at the passenger seat, refused to acknowledge the empty space beside him. Castiel had occupied that space just a few hours ago.
The world narrowed to lips and teeth and tongue. Desire and despair waged war on the breaths in between.
There was so much he had meant to say but the words died on his lips. He hoped that Cas understood just from the look in his eyes, the force in his tone, the significance of that hand on his shoulder.
Survival, he knew, was its own brand of suffering; barbed with regrets and heavy with the keen sting of memories.
Sam had taken the key. Dean had insisted. He knew his brother would go back, would utilise the space, turn it into some sort of base for the next generation of hunters. With Eileen’s help, he would make it feel like a home again. But Dean couldn’t be a part of that.
He couldn’t understand why he’d done it. Maybe he hadn’t meant to. But sure enough it was gone. Every day the past slipped further and further away, fading as quickly as dreams but still he couldn’t help but reach for those memories.
When they woke, limbs tangled together, Castiel was looking at him with something akin to wonder in his eyes. Dean hadn’t slept alone since.
“So what you’re saying is...” and Dean’s laughter faded away as he realised what Cas had been trying to tell him. His eyes flew to Castiel’s, his mouth falling open. Cas was watching him, a small smirk tugging at the corner of his lips.
The appearance of Cas, tentatively peering around the open lid of the trunk, jolted them from their quiet contemplation.
The realisation hit Dean all at once, Castiel’s own words coming back to him as he considered how the balance between them had shifted.
“Because it’s the truth,” he breathed, defeat shattering his confidence, “Because we had a life before all this and sure, it was pretty shitty but it was real.”
He’d ground out the words with deliberate force, still reluctant to admit Cas was gone, to admit that he alone couldn’t save him.
Dean was under no illusion that, somehow, Cas had sensed he was in danger and, despite his apparent ignorance, had slipped in and taken Dean while Zachariah’s back was turned. It was crafty, calculated, almost petty in its brilliance.
Understanding glimmered there. He might not know the details but Sam recognised the same heartsick anguish that gripped his own soul. The same bone-deep weariness that had settled over him ever since discovering Eileen was gone.
He lit candles as well, half a dozen in every room. Dean could only imagine the looks he’d got at the store.
“Already?” Dean blurted, dragging his eyes away from Castiel to look at his brother. His tone betrayed his disappointment.
Stripping him of his power, his divinity, his immortality had been deeply satisfying. Dean relished the moment he turned his back on him, refusing to expend the effort it would take to kill him. That was, after all, not who he was. Not anymore.
He replayed every journey they’d ever made together, nothing but open road before them and unsaid words between them.
Getting up off the floor had been the hardest thing he’d ever had to do. Turning his back on the last place he’d seen Cas near impossible.
“No, c’mon. I really have to go.” Dean announced, promptly disentangling himself from Castiel’s warm embrace.
“Wouldn’t miss it,” Dean said quickly, plastering a grin onto his face. He got to his feet as Sam shrugged his shirt back on and began searching for his car keys. Dean brushed the dirt off his hands and took the opportunity to angle a look at Cas. He was standing perfectly still, observing the brothers but making no attempt to re-join the conversation.
“Don’t look at me like that,” the hunter scolded as he twisted around to drop one last kiss onto Cas’ forehead, “I promised Sam.”
But Cas had saved him. Had been trying to save him for a while now but Dean had just been too blind to see it. When he had freed him from Hell he had been following orders but now, he had simply taken it upon himself to remove Dean from trouble’s path.
There was other stuff too: a copy of Dean’s first mug shots; a map of Blackwater Ridge, well-worn at the corners and bearing the inscription ‘Screw you Roy’ in the top corner; a crumpled newspaper cutting of the brother’s holding a giant cheque in the middle of a Biggerson’s; Cas’ Gas-N-Sip name badge; Dean’s homemade EMF metre; a torn Ghostfacers poster that Ed and Harry had printed themselves and insisted on signing; a bent copy of Carver Edlund’s Bugs.
“’Fraid so. I don’t wanna be late. Jody already had to pull a few strings to get us seen but we’ll see you later. You’re still coming for dinner right? I think Jody’s letting the girls make fajitas.”
“C’mon man, get going!” Dean finally interrupted, clapping Sam on the shoulder and pushing him towards Eileen.
But Chuck had merely shrugged off their surrender. Apparently he was happy to simply watch them flounder. With no one left to fight for and no monsters left to fight, the brothers would be effectively made redundant. Just Sam and Dean and an eternity of suffering stretching out before them. How could that be the end?
Dean knew he must look wretched, grief twisting his features into something unrecognisable. The set of his jaw betrayed his heartache. Rivulets of water still ran down his face, catching in his eyelashes like so many unshed tears.
“Yeah, she’s doing great,” Sam agreed. He was beaming now; the mere mention of Eileen’s name causing his whole face to light up. “We’ve actually got an appointment in-” and he glanced down at his watch. “Shit is that the time? Cas, I’m sorry, but I’ve actually gotta go.”
Dean knew that he didn’t always tolerate human contact but Castiel didn’t shrug him off. He allowed Dean to grip his arm, the fabric of the trenchcoat screwed up under his fingers. For a minute Dean held on and when he finally drew away, he half expected to see the shape of his palm imprinted there, just as Castiel’s handprint adorned his own shoulder.
He had silently blinked up at the once familiar house before turning his face to the midday sun with the hint of a smile.
The hunter came skidding back into view a few minutes later, rendering his efforts completely pointless. His heart skittered as he watched Dean fumble with the hem of his shirt.
He had witnessed firsthand Castiel’s transformation from a finely tuned, emotionless instrument to a discordant orchestra of empathy and feeling and not once had he suggested it was his own influence that had inspired such a change.
Sam hesitated, as though expecting something more but Dean knew that was as good as he was going to get.
It took a split second for Castiel’s resolve to crumble and when it did he was sent tumbling down into the depths of Dean’s embrace.
Mary had always said that angels were watching over him but his angel had abandoned him, leaving no trace behind.
As Castiel scattered kisses along his jawline he sent up a silent prayer, thanking God for small mercies and deceitful angels
He swiped a hand over his face, scrubbing at the sleep still caught in his lashes. The job was undoubtedly going to be a tedious one, luckily he’d had the foresight to rope Sam into helping.
With the suspected knowledge of their shared treachery warming his insides, Castiel surged up to kiss Dean. Hard.
In Dean’s opinion it was shitty, lazy writing. Surely Chuck would grow tired of their struggle soon enough and then what?
He glared at it, hoping the sheer force of his loathing would somehow dissolve it. But it remained, stubborn and resolute.
He could hear Lisa moving around downstairs, glasses clinking, Ben’s laughter loud and jubilant out in the yard. He shouldn’t be here. Not again. Not today. He should be down there manning the barbecue, joking and celebrating with his family.
There was barely anything left to remind him. Sam was... Well, Dean found it hard to think about Sam. And Cas... Dean hadn’t seen or heard from him in almost a year. He was starting to think Cas had removed the mark on purpose; some deluded attempt at helping Dean forget. Perhaps he thought it was a mercy.
And maybe he imagined it, maybe it was assurance given in the heat of the moment but Dean felt the shudder of Cas’ breath ghost over his skin, the slight dip of his head as he nodded in assent.
Maybe it was because she was an angel. Maybe it could sense her power, reacting with whatever traces of energy Castiel had left behind.
He let his phone ring out again and again; the sound too harsh in the grief-stricken silence. What if he never answered? What if he let Sam believe he was dead? Cas too. Because in reality, he felt as good as.
And then words poured out of the gaping wound Castiel’s certainty had left behind, staining the world bloody.
“Why did we ever keep all this crap?” Sam wondered aloud, rifling through a collection of research pages he’d undoubtedly printed off in an attempt to impress his older brother back in the early days.
Dean shrugged, fiddling with the lighter he’d found tucked inside a box of ammunition, “Guess we didn’t have much of anything else.”
After apologising profusely, Dean had gone to the store at Cas’ behest and purchased a bottle of sun-cream. The angel also periodically began appearing in the yard, baring refreshments. He would offer them to Dean and they’d sit together for a while but as soon as Dean made any motion to return to work, Cas would slip off without a word.
The thought terrified him. Did he even know how to live a life when his every movement wasn’t being dictated by someone else?
Castiel fell back into the mess of pillows with a soft whump of defeat. When had he become so dramatic? But then he considered the way Dean looked at him, the way he held him, the way he worshipped him with every touch of his hands or brush of his lips and conceded his reaction was probably justified. After all, they’d wasted enough time over the years. Castiel didn’t intend to waste any more.
“I don’t think this is coming off Dean.” Cas had fallen back from the trunk, a frown creasing his brow, the sodden rag still clenched in his hand. His chest was heaving from exertion. “What did you use to draw it?”
The words came back to him as she aligned her palm with the echo of Castiel’s, caressing the raised skin with a gentle touch.
Whatever this thing was, it had marked him. Searing it’s own handprint into the flesh of his shoulder, staking its claim.
Dean had seen a fragment of the old Cas that day; a familiarity in the way he slung Dean’s arm around his shoulder and hauled him to his feet, a spark of fierce urgency as he helped him inside. There was that exasperation - that fondness - in his voice as he admonished Dean for his foolishness. He’d escorted the invalid to the moth-eaten couch, sat with him while he gulped down glass after glass of water and even insisted on laying a damp towel on his forehead.
But Dean knew better. Sam was taking the opportunity to check in on them and Dean was grateful, although he’d never say as much.
He caught a flicker of movement out of the corner of his eye and turned to see that Cas had retreated, bending down to examine the weapons the brothers had been organising into piles. Dean cast a worried glance at him which Sam intercepted.
At that moment Eileen came into view, sunlight bouncing off the glasses she’d pushed into her hair. She signed a greeting in Dean’s direction which he clumsily attempted to copy. He watched her suppress a laugh, patiently waiting for Sam to join her.
Cas nodded, momentarily distracted by the movement of Dean’s throat as he swallowed. He looked feverish; eyes darting from Castiel’s lips to his hands to his anticipatory gaze and back again. Cas felt the sudden urge to laugh. He restrained himself, instead reaching out to pull Dean down onto the bed beside him. He came without any resistance, rolling on top of Castiel and caging him in with his arms either side of the angel’s head
Despite God’s own reassurance, the seemingly fragile nature of their newfound reality plagued him just as surely as his worst nightmares. He kept expecting to wake up and find it had all been another sick joke. They hadn’t saved anybody. They hadn’t defeated Chuck. They hadn’t rescued Cas...
Behind his eyelids bullets ripped through a dusty trenchcoat. A familiar voice admonished him; he was almost out of minutes. The cool press of fingertips brushed against his forehead. The silver streak of an angel blade caught the light. A fist collided with his jaw with a sickening crunch. A huff of involuntary laughter escaped from reluctant lips. Stubble scraped his cheek as he pulled the angel into a hug. Shades of blue crowded his vision - the garish blue of a crappy general store tabard, the endless blue of the morning sky as he wrestled his way out of his own grave, the untamed blue of angel grace, humming with raw energy. And best of all, the solemn blue of that unflinching gaze. There was a discarded cowboy hat on the backseat of the Impala. A game of Sorry pushed across a table and into his hands. A shitty four door saloon the colour of middle-aged misery.
Zachariah had been gearing up to do some serious damage. He might not have been able to kill Dean on account of his status as Michael’s Vessel but he could still make him suffer. And Dean knew he had riled him. But nothing, not even the threat of what was to come would induce him to say yes. Zachariah had simply given him an advantage, a roadmap of what not to do to. He wouldn’t end up a cold, callous, merciless soldier like his future self. He wouldn’t. He refused to believe there would ever come a day when he would willingly sacrifice his friends and family - his fellow comrades - no matter what Heaven or Hell put in front of him. He would rather die than live to see himself become so despicable.
So, like I was saying before not your typical A/B/O story. Alpha red and omega gold in this fic are achieved only by certain types of Alphas and Omegas and are only for certain reasons.
Bobby nods and closes the book. “It’s not in here. It’s not even catalogued in my store. I don’t know what it was doing out there on the floor.”
The nurse looks back at him dumbfound. “You forgot already. You have two surgeries lined up for this morning. The first surgery starts in…” The nurse looks at her watch “thirty minutes. Here’s your schedule for today.”
Castiel peeks at the book to figure out what the problem is. The store owner covers the book with his hand. “What’s the problem, and I’m just reading your nametag but is it Bobby?”
Dean blinks his eyes and looks up at Castiel. Castiel continues to eat his eggs, but at the corner of his eye he can see sadness across Dean’s face. Dean looks back down and picks up his fork. “I’m ready to hear it, buddy.”
“I would ignore him, but it's just...I have never seen him before. Why is he giving me trouble? I didn't even do anything to him for him not to like me.”
Castiel looks up to take in his sister’s appearance. She’s not that much different from what she used to be. The only thing that’s changed is her choice in clothes. Instead of wearing short shorts and tank tops all the time, now she opts for pants suits and blazers. “Hannah, how are you? It’s been a while.”
Dean turns around and tries to hide his blush by pretending he’s digging through his dresser again. His pants are actually in his closet, but Castiel doesn’t need to know. “I think we should go back to the living room and discuss your tour schedule sir.”
Dean opens the door to the training facility and lets Sam walk in first. There are more people in here then there were yesterday. Sam finds an empty space on the blue mat and gestures for Dean to come to him. Dean walks over and paces in front of Sam.
“Every alpha knows martial arts and boxing. This is where you will spar with the other alphas. There is also some exercise equipment in that room right there.”
Castiel’s lips twitch at his wife before he pretends to love everything about plasticville. “I love it baby! You were right, it's just...wonderful.”
“I know you don’t frequent these types of establishments, but you’re going to have to get used to it. Look over your menu and pick out what sounds good to you.”
Castiel drives through the open gate and signals to turn onto the busy street. He listens to a classical music station and maneuvers his way through the heavy traffic. Surprisingly it lessens soon after, which helps to make him calm and relaxed.
Crowley looked at Dean opening his mouth to say something until a limo pulled up beside them. Crowley opened the door and gestured inside.
Castiel makes it back home and flies to his mailbox to check it. He grabs the multiple envelopes and walks to his front door. He unlocks it and sets the mail on the foyer table. He takes off his shoes and then passes the kitchen to set the urn on his dining table. He paces back over to the foyer table to separate the mail. He throws away any junk and keeps the important letters. He opens an envelope from his sister Hannah as he trudges back to the living room and plops down on his sofa. He begins to read the letter over in his head. She’s been in Cuba for the past couple months and always writes about her adventures. She always wanted to be an activist and save the world. Castiel just thinks it was her excuse to avoid being an adult. Castiel laughs as he reads the last of the letter. Apparently, she has a boyfriend now. That little bit should be comical, especially since she’s inviting him to Thanksgiving. His mother was going to flip the fuck out. Being raised in a religious family was very restricting and her having sex before marriage or even living with her boyfriend before marriage is severely frowned upon. That’s why Castiel hasn’t had the balls to tell his parents that he’s gay. Nope, he’s just been living a double life so far. It’s infuriating but necessary. He folds the letter up and walks to the kitchen. He places the letter on the table and stills. What the fuck? Did the urn have two rubies before or just one? Castiel could swear that the urn had only one ruby and one diamond. It has two rubies now. That’s strange. Castiel contemplates for a second before he shrugs his shoulders. He walks over to the fridge and opens it, rummaging inside it for something to eat. He finds left over pasta that his next door neighbor Donna made yesterday. Donna’s a sweetheart and she has the biggest crush on him. Castiel knows he’s kind of stringing her along, but her cooking is fucking fantastic. He plucks a fork out of the drawer and saunters back over to the living room. He plops down on the couch again and grabs the remote. He balances his food and the remote as he turns on the TV. He changes it to some show about the ferocious appetite of the African lion. He puts the remote down and chomps down on the first bite of pasta. He moans as the sauce touches his tongue. He continues to gradually string together pieces and put it to his mouth. He finishes his meal and walks the bowl to the dishwasher. He starts a load of dishes and then walks back to the living room to power off the TV. He rubs his tired eyes and looks at the clock on the wall above the kitchen table. It’s way past his bedtime. Even though it’s the start of his weekend his work days take a toll and force him into exhaustion. He makes his way to his bedroom thinking over if he wants to shower now or in the morning. He falls down on the bed and his head rests on his pillow. Sleep takes him over soon after that and the shower is forced in the back of his mind.
Crowley topped off his bourbon and replaced the bottle in the mini bar. He tapped on the black tinted window separating the back from the drivers section. There was a short pause before the window started rolling down.
Dean agreed tersely, taking out a handkerchief from his pocket. He gently wipes sweat from Sam’s brow and puts the handkerchief back in his pocket. “Should we...should we start making preparations?”
to make your life complete. I want to do other things with my life anyway! I always wanted to go parasailing. I still can’t believe I haven’t done that yet.”
Castiel laughs playing off that he has no idea what this stranger is talking about. “Oh yeah, I still wasn’t feeling good. Yeah, when I said I pulled a double I meant I pulled a double shift leaning over the toilet puking.” Castiel laughs again as the stranger fixes their face in disgust.
Meg nods as she shimmies into the kitchen. “Oh my gosh, honey come look at the kitchen! I can tell we're going to be hosting a lot of dinner parties here. I mean it's not my thing, but I can see it.”
Bobby chuckles a little. “You’d like that wouldn’t ya, ya idgit. No, it’s not free. If it’s out there on the floor, I sell it. What’s your offer?”
Gordon points at the paper making Dean's gaze drop down to the bottom. “Alpha Red is a series of genetic traits that all alphas possessed before it was literally wiped out of existence back in the 30’s. The government felt that it was safer for civilians if it didn’t exist. They created serums and vaccines that were administered at birth that would stop Alpha Red making it dormant. Penicillin and the AX vaccine went hand in hand. Alpha Red occurs when an alpha has an extra Y chromosome. So their genetic makeup would read XYY instead of XY, which make up male betas and alphas that don’t have the Alpha Red traits. It was deemed dangerous because it gave all alphas heightened male specifications along with inhuman abilities. We’re talking extra sperm production, extra speed, extra strength, heightened senses, that sort of thing. There were too many occurrences happening with deranged alphas that couldn’t control it. It would throw them into rages that would kill them or people around them in violent ways.”
“Of course it was a wish, Dean. I would like to be a well-paid surgeon.” Castiel closes his eyes again. When he opens his one eye to look around the room this time he’s holding a nametag in his hand. It reads Castiel Novak and surgeon underneath it in small red letters. He looks back up and Dean is gone. “Dean, where are you?”
Dean wakes up to shouting down the halls. He blinks a few times trying to blink away the drowsiness as he rises slowly. He puts his feet over his bed and then stands up. He checks the clock on the dresser to see that it's nine thirty in the morning. He usually gets up a little earlier but last nights events took some much needed rest to adjust to. He decides to pass the time with exercise until Crowley can get there with his extra clothes. He does a few push ups and jumping jacks. If he's going to do this job right then he's going to need to put on as much muscle as possible. He's exhausted by the time that hears the knock on his door.
Castiel slumps back on the recliner. Eight years, that means Hannah would have been twenty-two when they got married. This proves Castiel’s theory right. Natalie must be about seven. He’ll have to find out Tristan’s age in due time. He’s pretty sure he’ll find out during their next birthdays. Naomi and Chuck start setting out plates of food on the table. “Alright kiddos, this food’s going to go to waste if we all don’t eat soon.”
Dean nodded and held out his arms wide. He saw people do this on small screen. He kind of got the gist of it. Charlie moved his limbs every which way until she got the correct measurements. Dean stayed quiet the entire time. He felt used without the penetration part. He hoped this wasn’t some kind of an escort service like job he got himself into. Charlie grinned as she rolled up the tape measure.
“This is Dean and Dean is going to do everything in his power to protect your treasure. He doesn't have any prior training, but he's willing to learn. I found him on the streets, in an alley as a matter of fact. I figured Dean here would rather be at his best here then out there considering his circumstances. Isn't that right Dean?”
“Hello. Mr. Novak I presume? Welcome to your first day here at Saint Christopher Regional Hospital. I’m Chuck Shurley, and I run the HR department here.”
Raphael throws his head back with a laugh. “I can only imagine. I actually wanted to discuss something with you. My company wants to invest in some business around your area. What would be a good spot?”
“Everything's good. I haven't sparred yet, but I almost got the hang of shooting. Sam is a great teacher.”
, or whatever that means. The only thing I can’t grant you is love, a departed person back from the dead, or granting you or someone else eternal life. Those are my three no, no’s. Don’t wish for those and you’ll be fine.”
“Dear, are you sure that’s what you want me to do? The darkness is impatient and if she’s called for no reason, she’ll have our heads.” Rowena stands up gathering the necessary ingredients to conjure up the entity.
“Whatever they have you doing Dean, you'll be ready for it. You'll be one bad SOB after I'm done with you.”
Meg laughs a little at his flustered behavior before she fixes her mouth to point out the obvious. “This is new, right? Fenced in a community where you have to use a key code, it’s so fancy.”
It was an old and battered place. The sign didn’t really help to draw customers in either. Bobby’s Place might as well be empty from the looks on the outside. Castiel didn’t know why he wanted to come in here. Something just told him to come. There was dust clinging onto almost everything in the store. He walks around the shelves touching random objects and occasionally getting the stink eye from the store owner. He sees random paintings leaning against the shelves. He blows the dust off one and touches the canvas gently. It’s a picture of a woman. It looks like it’s from the baroque era. The woman’s dress is practically swallowing her and it has ugly bows strewn throughout it, talk about overkill. He politely moves along and abandons the painting. He skims the shelves again. He doesn’t even know what he’s looking for. This is not how he hoped to spend his Friday night. His job was stressful today and the last thing he wanted to be doing was walking around an antique shop. His job had its kinks like the pay grade, but accounting was always a passion of his because he believed strongly in numbers. Anything could be solved with numbers. Maybe his obsession with numbers was the reason he tried to counteract it with art. Art sometimes couldn’t be explained. It was a nice balance in his predictable life. He made quick work of each shelf until his eyes stumbled on an urn. The urn was unusually placed, sitting beside fancy glass vases. It was kind of beat up and dingy. It was gold in color but the years have turned it bronze. Some of the jewels were missing and Castiel didn’t know if they were real or fake. He guessed that they were probably fake because of the condition the urn was in. The top of the urn had a symbol on it that he didn’t recognize. The urn had character and Castiel knew that with a little work it could be a good conversational piece. Castiel picks up the urn and dusts it off. He carries it to the front where the store owner tries to ring it up. The store owner looks through his books to find a price for the item. “Huh, that’s strange.”
Meg looks at the back door and then back at Castiel. “I don’t know, I wasn’t in here. I didn’t even hear the alarm system chirp to tell us the back door was opened. Are you okay?”
Castiel snatches the cigarette from between Dean’s lips. “No more of that. I know you're a grownup, but you're a performer and cigarettes ruin your vocal chords. No more please!”
Dean makes his way into the grand foyer, taking his time to run one of his fingers on top of one of the mahogany side tables sitting underneath a family portrait. He isn’t surprised when he can’t find a single speck of dust. Dean continues to the dining room hoping to find his mother. She’s partial to entertaining in the spatial room. When he doesn’t find her chatting away at the table he sighs and walks right back out. He heads upstairs knowing fully well she wouldn’t be in any other place than Sam’s room. When he gets to the door he gives a few raps before entering. His intuition led him right where he needed to be when he notices his mother sitting by Sam’s side. Dean closes the door behind him to block out the noise of shuffling feet moving about the house. “Has he shown any progress?”
“Yeah my grandfather, Samuel, was an army nut and I feel like it's in my blood, hence the last name. He collected guns and army memorabilia throughout the years. I can tell you pretty much anything you want to know about any weapon ever produced. I can also teach you how to shoot. Which is what I intend to do. You ready?”
Castiel smiles at her as she continues to mess with the sink and appliances. He does a 180 and explores the dining area. It looks big enough for a table and a China cabinet to fit comfortably in the space. He loves the hanging light fixture that would drift above their table perfectly, if their table was set up already. He paces himself as he explores more of the house. He goes from room to room and checks how much work he has to put into each one. The house is in excellent condition already, but it needs to be up to his standards. He finally ends up venturing upstairs and walks down the hallway, flickering lights on as he goes. The bedroom is huge and exactly what he expected it to be.
“I'm here because I need the money. My family back home needs the money. All of my military training isn't going to get me a desk job, and I'm not going back to the army. I won't do that again. At least what I'm doing now I'm still in the United States. I'm closer to my family. Don't get me wrong, it is dangerous but it pays more. It puts food on the table for my wife and kid. It puts a roof over their head's without her having to work. She's an omega you know. I worry about her all the time since I'm not there to protect her. This is my last year doing this job and I'm out. I've been doing this for so long that I have enough money to break away for awhile. If I ever need more I can always come back.”
“I do get that question an awful lot. Let me start by saying that I'm not originally from Chicago. I'm a Texas man. All of my family is from Texas and before you ask, yes everything is bigger in Texas.”
first album in the cd tray. A smooth rock ballad fills his apartment. He turns down the volume so he won't disturb his neighbors, and so he can hear his thoughts. He bobs his head to the music, and closes his eyes. He lets the music take him as he thinks of ideas for Dean. Castiel doesn’t know why Dean feels the way he does. All he knows is that Dean seriously needs to get back in touch with his roots. Castiel clicks next on the stereo and
This is the end loves. Thank you for sticking in with me through all of this. I hope it wasn't too bad of a dumpster fart for my first attempt at A/B/O. Let me know what you think in the comments section. As always I'm on Tumblr.
“Listen, you can't think like that. The only thing that gets you through the tough shit is wanting to survive it. If you have motivation to survive you will prevail.”
have stayed at the hotel at least once. Dean was the only member to grow to love the hotel’s accommodations. Dean’s now a regular at the hotel, but he has certain preferences and requirements that Castiel doesn’t meet, so Castiel doesn’t see him that often. When Dean checks in he wants only women to clean his room. When Dean calls down for room service he wants the cart to be left at the door, with a knock letting him know that it’s there. He values his privacy which makes it difficult for Castiel to interact with him. Castiel only sees Dean when he’s checking in and checking out. Even then he has a couple groupies hanging off of him. He’s unapproachable and unattainable, which makes Castiel want him more. Castiel always volunteers to bring the cart to Dean’s door. Sometimes he’ll get lucky and hear a piece of a song that he’s working on. Castiel will quietly whip out his phone and record it. Other time’s he’s not as lucky and hears moans and groans coming from the other side of the door. It’s rather annoying considering that Castiel wants to be the one making Dean moan out
Castiel nods his head as he walks around to the other side of the car. “Yeah? What charity is that?”
Dean closes his eyes taking in the scent of aroused omega. He wants to take him right there and right now job be damned. Castiel knows what he’s doing the touch, the smell, everything he’s baiting Dean and he has him hook, line, and sinker. Dean steps back out of the touch which causes Castiel’s scent to alter a little. He gives Dean A half smile and then saunters out the door. Dean immediately picks up his house phone and dials Crowley. Crowley picks up right away.
Sam leaves the room closing Dean's door behind him. Dean takes off his clothes from that day and throws them into his laundry hamper. He promises himself to do laundry tomorrow. He showers, throws on pajamas, and brushes his teeth. He walks out of his bathroom and then over to his bed. He gets ready to settle in until he notices his door. His door is cracked open. He could have sworn that Sam shut it all the way. Dean walks over to the door and shuts it. He turns back around and catches a glimpse of a note on his night stand. He walks over to the night stand and picks up the note. He opens it and reads silently.
Castiel can’t contain his excitement at being the guest of honor. He’s going to be brought on stage.
Dean nods and then rests his head on the back of the limo seat. He just met the man but he can't get him or his voice out of his head. He doesn't understand what makes this Castiel character so intriguing, but he's sure by the time he finds out rule number one will be broken.
? Any normal person would have already been down to their third wish already. You’re a weird human, you know that.”
Castiel pulls his wallet from his pocket and digs out forty bucks. He places it on the counter. “Here, I don’t need a receipt. Thanks!”
with this thing. It was our biggest hit, you know.” Dean gingerly places the guitar into Castiel’s hands. Castiel’s eyes dart around on the instrument, looking at it like it’s a piece of the Holy Grail.
Meg chuckles again and moves in closer to Castiel making herself smaller. “It’s called soap and shampoo, now go to bed.”
Castiel and Dean stand by the register’s all day long paying for people’s groceries. Dean smiles as happy children and mothers leave with carts full of groceries. Castiel smiles too because it’s what he wanted Dean to see. Dean shouldn’t be worrying about pumping out the latest hit record, or writing a hit song for another artist. Those are semantics. Dean should be enjoying life as it happens. What’s the point of making all that money from record sales if you don’t put it in the right place. If you worry about everything you gain nothing. Castiel and Dean pay until the 3,000 dollars that was withdrawn from Dean’s credit card is gone. Dean still wears a smile as the last dollar is taken from his hand. They both walk out to Castiel’s car waving bye to the cashier’s. They climb in and Castiel starts the car, cranking the heater on. Dean looks out the window at the people crossing the parking lot. “What do we do now?”
“After the clothing store we’ll stop and get you fed. We want you performing at your best ability. At the restaurant we’ll discuss business.”
Soon after he turns into the hospital entrance, parking in the first available spot he sees. Castiel walks up to the building and enters through the sliding doors, waving to the patients in the waiting room. He doesn’t really know where to go to get to the Human Resources office so he walks to the front desk. He waits for the first available nurse to notice him. “Castiel Novak, I was trying to get to the HR office. Can you point me in the right direction?”
Dean scrunches his eyebrows as he thinks about the term. “Yeah, I heard it mentioned a few times, but what does that have to do with the tour?”
Dean nodded his head up and down not really sure what to say. He just wanted to better his situation.
Castiel smiles at Dean baring all his teeth. “I know I was just excited. I’m going out there now, so you can get this thing started. Break a leg out there, not literally though.” Castiel hugs Dean one handed as he pulls back the curtain with his other hand. He exits off the stage making sure not to walk on it completely. He doesn’t need people rioting because the crowd thinks he’s the proprietor or something. He finds a spot close to the first row and huddles in with everyone else. Jo, Ash, and Sam walk on first and take their positions. They start playing a song when Dean walks out. Castiel doesn’t recognize the song, and he knows every song from
Dean throws his head back and it thunks softly on the back of the couch. “Ask as many questions as you want. After all I am your genie for the time being.”
“I think I want to spar. I need to get as much practice as I can. I think I'm being moved at the end of the week.”
“Yeah, Crowley is supposed to be here around five. I kind of want to get a few hours of target practice though before I leave. You down?”
Dean blinked a few times before shaking his head no. Crowley sipped his bourbon again savoring it like it was made from Jesus himself.
“We’re in Sinj.” Sam turns towards the back seat to look at Dean, and Dean notices that he’s now in the driver's seat. “Castiel pulled over and I volunteered to drive the rest of the way. I decided to pull my weight.”
“What does that have to do with me though?” Dean sits back on the couch and props his foot on the coffee table.
Castiel smiles as he reclines back on the couch. “I have new friends and everything. All of the people at my old job don’t even know who I am. I’ll miss some people, but I’m sure I’ll run into them again. I didn’t know you could do that. You changed my whole life with only one wish. I wonder what would happen if I made my next wish. I thought a lot about it at work. It’s not for me it’s for someone else, that’s why I’ve been thinking about it.”
. Your time at the B-Course was the fastest recorded time. You have Alpha Red. I haven’t seen your eyes to tell if it’s true, but I feel it in my gut that you have it. When they were recruiting for this job I jumped at the chance to see you in action. I had to know if I was on the right track.”
Benny nodded his head before giving a quick yes sir and then rolling up the window. They rode to the restaurant in perfect silence. They glanced at each other in seldom occurrences and then looked out the window the rest of the way there. They arrived at the restaurant in record time. They climbed out together while Benny drove away. He thought Benny would have joined them, but Crowley assured Dean this was a private meeting for just two. Crowley walked up to the hostess and greeted him the best way he could.
Dean thinks about it for a couple seconds before he slows to a stop on the side of the road. Castiel and Dean both get out and switch spots. Dean climbs in the back thanking god the majority of the luggage is in the trunk. He props up the lonely suitcase to use a makeshift pillow. Castiel puts the car back in drive and slowly creeps out onto the open road. “Thank you, Dean.”
“He'll be staying at the tree-house. Make sure no one follows. Get him cleaned up and trained. I can't have him fumbling on the job. After he's trained bring him back here for evaluation. Now, both of you get out of my sight.”
Meg continues to gawk at the passing families and architecture. Meg pulls her seat back up so she can sit right in it. She rests her head back on the soft cushion. It feels like they drive around in circles and reach many dead ends before they finally find the right road they’re looking for. Castiel drives onward through a crosswalk until he reaches a gridiron fence covered in flowers and shrubbery.
Chuck holds out a glass of bourbon for Crowley to take. He walks back to his desk sipping happily on his glass. He sits back down and waves towards the door. One of the guards leaves the room and Dean follows the guards movements. The guard does not come back. Chuck sips on his drink and then sets it down on a coaster on his desk.
“Thank you, I'll see you tomorrow around twelve. Hopefully, I can get this whole shooting nonsense down quickly. Night!”
It’s a fresh start, that's what he keeps telling himself. He keeps repeating the mantra over and over again. They just need a fresh start. A place where they can forget all their troubles and be a unit; especially after years of fighting and infidelity. He blinks away the exhaustion that starts to nestle its way into his eyes as he stares out the foggy window. He draws in the thick sheet of condensation with his finger and sighs, creating more ripples of fog on the window. He finds himself thinking about the life they had back in Arizona. Arizona being the place where the sun never dies. With all things considered, it was a good life. Now, he’s fixating on a tiny spot circled on the makeshift map they bought from a convenience store on their way out of Phoenix. He taps his fingers on the spot over and over again, waiting until his wife comes out of a nearby diner. This is their starting over. He doesn’t know why Meg picked Epilson, New Hampshire. He thinks maybe she just closed her eyes and pointed to a place, and then chose a city in the vicinity of her finger, or maybe it had been a conscious decision. Either way he was going to make the most of it because
? I don’t do favors sweetheart.” The dark entity, which is now made up of black smoke, strolls through the room preparing to leave the small cottage.
Bobby purses his lips and taps his fingers on the counter. “Make it forty and you got yourself a sell.”
Sam pointed to a pin on the side and pulled it then slid it back into place. He waited for Dean to repeat his motions. Once Dean repeated the motion he spoke again.
“To answer your question, let’s just say their somewhat of a national treasure. There are a few rules I and my boss would like you to follow though. Rule number one do not fraternize with the treasure. You cannot become a distraction. Always dismiss open ended conversation and remain guarded. Rule number two: You are an alpha, but you will only act as such when the time permits. You are the help so act like it. Rule number three: Stay on alert, keep a keen eye, and be prepared for anything. This job is a dangerous job. Please try to avoid getting yourself killed or the client killed. Understand?”
I just wanted to say that this work is heavily inspired by the Russian artist Vitas. If you haven't heard anything from him I highly recommend. Hope your enjoying this fic so far! Leave comments or drop a kudos lovelies. I love your feedback guys it brightens my day.
“I know.” she smiles “Just look at the countertops and the sink fixtures. Whoever owned this house before us remodeled it big time.” Meg turns the knobs on the kitchen sink making water rush out and splash against the stainless steel basin. “I know I don’t cook or wash dishes, but I might have to make an exception for this house. You said we have an alarm system though. I’ll have to call the realtor to see what the code is. First, I have to find the damn box. This house is absolutely incredible. I feel like we paid next to nothing for this.”
Dean heads out of the room memorizing the room number. He heads downstairs with Crowley and they enter a room with blue padding on the ground. There are alphas sparring in the corner.
Castiel goes through the motions as March passes by. His job is easier now since he’s performed almost every surgery that there is. His family is stronger and his bond with his sister is impenetrable. All thanks to the genie that disappeared from his life. Castiel stands in front of the nurse’s station in the waiting room. He’s done all his surgeries for the day, but he likes to hang out in front of the nurse’s station and exchange horror surgery stories. He laughs at one of the nurses going into depth about a man that woke up during surgery. From the sound of it, it wasn’t pretty. The entrance doors slide open and a few distraught men walk in. They’re huddled around a man who’s holding his arm. One of the men excuses himself from the circle and walks up to the nurse’s station. Castiel pretends that he’s not interested in what the man has to say, but he secretly eavesdrops.
The double wooden doors in front of them open slowly revealing a big room with long wooden tables and benches. On the left there’s a long counter where food is served. The ceiling is beautifully painted with images of saints. It almost reminds Castiel of the Sistine Chapel. The light in the room comes from big, tall windows on the wall to the right, as well as from old lamps hanging from the ceiling.
Castiel blinks back disbelief as he picks up the thirty pound bag off the floor. He pours it on the bed emptying the sack completely. “This is what I was talking about. You need to reconnect with your fans. If you don’t reconnect then you could lose your fan base. Then you’ll seriously not have a reason to do music. Promise me you’ll read these.”
Dean huffs under his breath as he blows on his hands for warmth. Who knew he would be led around to fifteen thousand places in zero degree weather. Dean just want’s to go back to the hotel. “I didn’t know you were my daddy now?”
“Anything for a Winchester. Missouri, would you like to step out of the house for a while. I’m pretty sure you’d be bothered to sit here with the darkness. Especially for a person who only dabbles in light magic.” Rowena whisks the door open with her fingers creating an eerily cool draft.
as always i'm on tumblr if you want to come through and have a chat. we can talk about some of the projects im working on. @Ajacentlee.tumblr.com
The day goes on without any issues. Castiel finishes on time. He’s checked on each patient twice and the records are done. He feels tired and ready to go home. Cassie is still at her desk, whisking through a stack of papers. Castiel stares at her for a few seconds before clearing his throat. “Are you not going home?”
“That’s where you're wrong. No matter who they listen to there is always room for more fans. I booked you for 2:30. That means you have less than fifteen minutes to find a song you want to sing. I chose this specific bar because on Friday’s it’s strictly country, all day long. You can not request anything by
Dean gives Sam a concerned look but remains indifferent about the whole pulling over scenario. “I don’t think that’s a good idea. If we want to make the plane and keep good timing we need to stay on the road. I can keep driving, it’s no problem. You can go ahead and get some sleep.”
Castiel turns to meet Dean’s gaze looking puzzled. “Hard work and dedication huh, why didn’t I think of that?”
“What! Do I not get a kiss goodnight?” Castiel grabs Meg's chin gently and turns her face towards him. He plants a kiss on her lips tenderly. He lets himself settle into her before he drifts off slowly and then falls hard into a deep sleep.
Dean huffs out a breath and then try's to hit Sam again. Sam counters it and then pushes back hard into Dean's chest. Dean clutches his chest and coughs as he tries to swallow in air. Sam looks at Dean with the most shit eating grin.
starts playing out of the surround speakers. Dean walks to the stage and grabs the microphone. Castiel looks at all the bar flies who flock to the stage as the DJ announces Dean’s name. Castiel hears hushed whispers moving throughout the room. Some people wonder who this Dean Smith character is while others fill in the blanks. The crowd goes silent as they give Dean their full attention. Castiel orders a soda and sips it gingerly as Dean sashays on the stage. Dean puts the microphone to his lips, moistening them as he starts to belt out the song. Castiel is highly surprised Dean knows the words to the song at all. Whooping and hollering cheers erupt from the crowd of patrons. Dean eats it up, dancing from left to right on the stage. He bends down to shake a couple of hands, while winking vicariously. Castiel smiles at the sight of Dean in his element. He could survive off Dean’s happiness and nothing else if he had to. Castiel leans his back against the bar counter, waiting for Dean to finish engaging with the crowd. He slides his glass over to the left to signal to the bartender for another refill. Today is the day Castiel witnesses Dean get his mojo back. The bartender returns Castiel’s glass as Dean finishes up the song. Dean bounces off stage and bows to all of the bar patrons. Castiel didn’t think Dean could knock country out of the park, but the screams for an encore prove him wrong. Dean grabs Castiel’s glass out of his hand. “How did I do? How was that for connecting with my fans?”
Dean looked up startled at the figure coming towards him. He dropped the newspapers and put his hands up in surrender. He sniffed the air. Alpha! He was too weak to fight. He would lose.
“I am sure you know what this place is and what you do here. There is no need for me to explain. I will be taking my leave now, but before I go I want to hand you this.”
“Hey, how come Nat gets a dollar and I don’t.” the little boy clinging to his legs was now peering up with tear filled eyes.
“Good! Well, I'm going to go get changed, and then head home to get some sleep. I'll see you tomorrow Dean. It was nice to meet you.”
“It's a good thing that I got word you're leaving today. If you weren't leaving you would be doing house chores for the next week because of that strike. Clean up this mess.”
Dean cracks his neck before he gives a curt nod. He inhales slowly closes his eyes and then exhales before he opens them. Crowley gets out his stopwatch. He sets up the time and then tells Dean to get ready. Dean lines himself up at the start. Crowley takes out a whistle and sticks it in his mouth. Dean looks at the course before him and thinks about the best way to approach it. Crowley blows the whistle and clicks the stopwatch. Dean runs as fast as he can speeding through the obstacles. He jumps over hurdles, climbs through barrels, pushes through a 2 man sled, and runs through tires. He makes it to the targets and pulls his gun from his holster. He pulls the safety and shoots every moving target. He doesn't look at his work he just puts his gun back in his holster. He keeps going maneuvering over to the other side where the alphas are waiting for him. He slides in keeping a low stance and sweeps one of the alphas feet while he connects a chop to his throat. He jumps up and punches another in the groin. He connects a fist to the alpha coming up behind him. He uppercuts another alpha stopping him dead in his tracks. Once all of the alphas are subdued he unties the dummy. He throws the dummy on his back and runs to the finish. He drops the dummy gently on the ground and pants with his hands on his knees. Crowley has stopped the watch and is already discussing the time with Chuck. They both walk up to Dean. Crowley starts up with a chippy squeal.
As you can tell updates for this fic are going to be a little sporadic until the beginning of next year. Happy reading!
When Chuck is done laughing, he gets up and goes to a filing cabinet. He pulls out a folder and then comes back to the desk. “Here. This is your shift’s timetable. And this is a list of the patients currently in the ward. These are the codes to access the records on the computer. Go through the rest yourself, it’s pretty straight forward.”
Sam walks over to Dean and claps him on the back near his shoulder. Dean tenses but relaxes under the touch.
“Okay, I’m still freaked out by all of this. I understand what’s happening, but it’s still freaky so you’re going to have to give me a minute to process. I process by asking questions and I expect answers.” Castiel paces his living room flailing his arms about as he speaks. Dean is entranced by his fidgeting and just stares at him from the sofa. Castiel hasn’t even stopped to examine Dean closely. He should be fascinated by a freaking genie sitting Indian style on his couch, but he’s too focused on the monkey wrench that is this situation. How is he supposed to go to work knowing that a genie is in his house? How is supposed to sleep or go grocery shopping. How is he supposed to do anything really?
The omega rushed towards the back of the restaurant. Crowley continued looking at the menu. He looked up at Dean who was staring out at the neatly dressed restaurant goers.
“I think that we should at least pull over in the next town, get some sleep maybe?” Sam looks tired with the bags under his eyes that are puffy and slightly darkened.
Meg wakes Castiel by opening the curtains and letting sunlight wash over him. “What time is it?” he groans, hiding his face in the soft pillow. “ I need like ten more minutes baby, please!”
“Now, I better let you go. You’re starting in half an hour, which gives you time to get organized.” Castiel takes the folder, gets up and thanks Chuck, before leaving the HR office. He chooses to walk in the opposite direction from where he came looking for an elevator to get from the ground floor to the fourth. He finds one easily enough and up he goes. Out of the elevator there’s a white sign with the letters HDU written in bold, blue letters with an arrow pointing to the left; so he takes a left. As he walks through a pair of big oak double doors he finds himself in what seems to be a different building. The white walls are now a sad dark brown. The floor is carpeted with blood red coloring, rather than the blue and white linoleum tiles of before. The wooden doors of the rooms on either side are closed.
Dean’s eyes gawk open and rubs his chin. “Then it’s been almost 135 years that I’ve been doing this.”
Charlie smiled big before she rushed off towards the front of the store. Dean put his hoodie back on before he walked back to Crowley. Crowley was talking to a shorter man with a big gut when Dean walked up to him. He cut the conversation short and ushered the man away with a hand shake.
Castiel stares at her for a few seconds trying to translate the garbled language before he gives up entirely. “What?”
Castiel blinks and sits down on the sofa beside Dean. “I would rather be safe than sorry. Any movie I have ever seen that resembles this always has consequences for the wisher. Either the wishes get screwy or they wish for something they can’t have or whatever. I’m just trying to dot my I’s and cross my T’s.”
Dean appears to be in a state of confusion. Castiel can’t tell if it’s from sleep or a hangover. “I thought that was a dream. I thought I made that deal when I was dreaming. I was awake the whole time?”
Dean laughs and then sets his gun back down. Sam then pushes the button on the side of both of their booths. Two paper target's with circles on them appear 50 yards ahead of them. Sam takes his gun, positions himself, and then shoots at his target. He makes five bullet holes in the middle and one on the outer ring. He puts his safety back on and then gestures for Dean to try.
Sam smiled uncontrollably and Dean nudged him, “Go. She’s waiting for you.”  Sam nodded and ran towards Eileen’s house.
“No!” Dean  yelled as he ran after Castiel, but the angel pushed him away, knowing that he would try to save him, leaving a bloody handprint on Dean’s jacket. He watched the darkness grab the man he loved and in a blink of  an eye, Castiel was gone.
Of course. Dean said, “Yeah what about last night? About how you carried me like a baby to my room?” Dean asked.
He had these feelings for Dean for as long as he could remember, but at the time, he didn’t know or understand what love was. But the Winchesters taught him how to be a human and have feelings.
“Right,” Cas replied. When he got the top of the stairs, he turned to Dean, “Remember when I said goodbye to you when the Empty took me?”
Dean countered, “You’re mad at me?! You’re the one who is making me feel guilty because of what happened last night!”
Cas knew that Dean put up walls, he guarded himself and those walls came crashing down when he was drunk. It was like he  could see the real Dean without the masculine exterior. The angel so desperately wanted to know if the hunter actually felt the same way. But he would never admit it even if he did, that was just the type of person he was.
The angel could tell that the hunter was a little ashamed of them. “Dean,” Cas was now dressed and put his hand on his shoulder, trying to figure out what he should say to him. “Are you ashamed of us?”
“I mean I sleep when I want to, not because I have to or when I feel tired. I sleep just to clear my head,” Cas said, “I don’t accidentally fall asleep.”
Dean knew where this was going and he did not want to go there. He didn’t want to admit that he cared too much. “Just that I wasted so much tears. Not that you weren’t worth it but I shoulda known you were coming back,” Dean gave an innocent smile that pushed Castiel away. “Why?”
“I love you, too, Cas. I love you, too.” he whispered, but Castiel never heard him. Dean sat in the corner of the dark room, trying to stay strong, but losing his angel broke him. He heard his phone ring and wiped the tears out of his eyes to see who it was, it was Sam calling. Dean turned off his phone and threw it across the room.
He figured that he’d just pretend that he didn’t remember what had happened last night. He clearly remembered everything, every action, every feeling.  He remembered how red he and Cas were, and it wasn’t because he was drunk, he remembered staring at his lips, thinking about moving in and touching them with his own.
“Whatever, man,” Dean said as he turned around and prepared his weapons for a hunt. Please, forgive me, Cas. I’m sorry for hurting you like this. You don’t deserve me.
“You know, ever since we met, ever since I pulled you out of Hell, knowing you has changed me. Because you cared, I cared. I cared about you.” Cas’s voice started to break, “ I care about Sam. I cared about Jack. I cared about the whole world because of you. You changed me, Dean.”
Sam and Eileen sat down at the table and each grabbed a beer and toasted, “Team Freewill.” Sam said.
Castiel finally broke, “You know what? Yeah, I’m angry. I’m angry at you!“ He threw a pillow at the hunter, who caught it. He stood up and walked over to the Winchester.
It must have been hours, they all drank and talked, for once not having to worry about the chaos in the world. Dean said, “I’m gonna -hic- head in now,” he pushed his chair out but stumbled a little.
“Because if I told Sam that we didn’t leave yet, he’d ask why. And what would I say then? Oh, I’m bi and was making out with Cas and we lost track of time.”
“Dean, you misunderstand me,” Cas sheepishly said, “When I said I love you, I didn’t mean it as just friends or brothers I-”
Jack nodded and snapped his fingers. There was a bright light and Dean blocked his eyes. Then the bright light was gone and Dean looked over and he saw Castiel.
As Dean was doing that, he moved his lips to the angel’s neck. Castiel felt the nice warm touches on his neck. Cas, then started to take off Dean's clothes, first his leather jacket, then his flannel, and lastly his shirt. As he removed all the layers from the hunter, he could feel Dean’s wall starting to crumble and he could see who the Winchester really was.
Dean waited until Cas left, and loudly sighed. Fuck. Most of the time when Dean drinks, he’s careful and doesn’t let any of his secrets spill. But, last night he fucked up. He told Cas that he loved him.
Castiel turned red when he heard the Winchester say those words. He was at a loss of words. When Cas said that, he thought that he was going to die, he confessed his love for Dean. Not as a brother but someone more. Dean probably thinks that he meant it as just a friend.
He rolled over, thinking about him. Cas was always there for him, his guardian angel. Sometimes Dean found it annoying but he knew that nothing bad would happen because he was protected.
Castiel sunk in his chair, depressed. He couldn’t blame the Winchester for not remembering, he was drunk after all. But, was it true, what he said? That he loved him?
“Fuck!” Dean cried, “I couldn’t save him.”  He put his hands on his head, trying to hold it together. Without his angel, there was no hope in defeating Chuck. There was no hope left in his world. The one person who meant everything to him, other than Sam, was gone.
Dean laughed, “That felt friggin amazing, Cas. We saved a bunch of kids. Finally back to normal, well our normal anyway. No more Chuck. No more big bads like the Empty and Billie. Just us hunters.”
Dean was already at the top of the stairs with his bags full of clothes and weapons, when he called out to Castiel. “What are you waiting for, Cas? Let’s get going.”
Castiel laughed at Dean, and Dean asked, “What you laughing at, angel?”  He slurred, he definitely was super drunk.
Dean carried his angel inside the bunker and let him rest on the couch. He stayed silent as Jack and Sam talked about what would happen next. He really didn’t know what to say. His angel was no longer an angel, he was human and that was something that Dean could not grasp the idea of.
Dean knew what Castiel was saying as he said goodbye. That’s when Dean learned of Castiel’s feelings towards him. He would never ever admit it, even to himself, that he loved Cas, he was just too damn stubborn to admit it.
He got up and walked through the kitchen of the bunker and saw Sam and Eileen eating breakfast while reading in silence. He found them so cute together.
He passed Sam and Eileen eating and reading in the kitchen and said hello. They acknowledged that he was there but didn’t say anything back.
Cas yelled, to notify the others that he was going on a hunt, “Found a probable Vamp case. I’ll be back soon,” he said as he closed the laptop.
Cas didn’t know what to do or how to react to Dean’s actions. Then Dean pushed him away, “Well anyway, I’m tired.” He said. He let himself fall back onto the bed and turned away from Cas. “Night, Cas.”
The Winchester pulled himself out of his bed and he put some clothes on. Just a plain black shirt, then his red flannel and finally his leather jacket. He didn’t bother fixing his bed nicely since he knew that he’d come back to it anyway. He opened the door and took a deep breath.
“Hey, get off my angel,” Dean said he pushed Sam away and hugged Castiel, his face, red. Both Sam and Cas laughed at drunk Dean.
The hunter parted from his partners lips and leaned over to check his phone. “It’s Sam,” he said as he got up from Cas and answered the phone. “Hey, what’s up Sammy?”
“Cas, don’t do this,” Dean whispered, “Please don’t.”  Dean never showed when he was hurting, he wanted to seem stronger. But, Cas knew, he saw it. The sadness. There was loud pounding on the door outside, Death was coming.
“I have to,” He put his hand on Dean’s shoulder. Castiel’s smile didn’t leave, “I’m sorry, Dean. I’ve caused you so much pain for the last decade,” he laughed, “The last few years with you, with Sam and Jack, have been the best years of my life. I was an angel of the lord, always following orders. But you taught me freewill. And we made a difference.” There were tears in his eyes, “You never gave up, in the face of the devil and god. Stay strong, Dean, for me.”  Dean's green eyes were filled with tears and he didn’t bother wiping them away. He was falling apart. Dean stood there speechless in front of Cas. “Don’t cry.” This was the first time Castiel saw him hurting. Cas smiled, as he wiped away Dean’s tears.
They heard a car pull up behind them and looked. It was Sam and Eileen. Dean pulled away from Castiel and the angel could tell that Dean was embarrassed.
Dean knew deep down that he loved Cas, but he refused to accept his own feelings. He wasn’t gay, was he? He had loved women before, Jo, Lisa, Cassie. But those relationships never worked out because of the family business, or that’s what he let himself believe. Cas was also an angel! How could he fall in love with an angel!? A human and an angel, it wouldn’t work out anyway. So Dean decided he should bury all feelings he had towards Cas and just pretend that nothing happened and nothing will happen.
Sam entered the bunker with Eileen and saw Jack, Dean, Cas and all the hunters, including apocalypse Charlie and Bobby, Jody and the Wayward sisters and Donna all gathered at the table, drinking and laughing. “Come join us, Sammy!” Dean laughed as he continued to drink.
“Hey,” Dean walked over to Castiel. He put his hand on Cas’s cheek. “Going back to the bunker doesn’t  mean we won’t have another fun night like last night.” He put his forehead on Cas. Dean smiled as he kissed his angel.
Castiel laughed, “I’m good,” he said as he rested his arm on the window and stared out into the darkness. It reminded him of the empty. Living out horrible memories, being alone.
Dean noticed that Cas was being sarcastic and he definitely was not okay. What could be bugging him?
The Hunter kept pushing his lips against Cas’s, moving his tongue violently in his mouth, causing the angel to moan.  Dean picked Cas up from the waist, while kissing him. When they parted, to catch a breath, Dean threw the  angel onto his bed. He looked down at him and smiled as crawled on top, and started to undress Castiel.
On his return Dean found the table free of bottles, replaced with two cups of coffee and a jug of water.
"Meg just popped in, she didn't stay long or do anything I got the feeling she was fishing for something." oh that was interesting, Dean knew they'd been pretty tight a while back she even got on really well with Sam and Meg was very particular with whom she befriended.
If he didn't meet the man soon he'd have to put his foot down. Shuffling off the sofa Henry headed to the kitchen where Uncle Sam was sitting at the table.
"So surprise," Dean's eyes went wide after the words left his mouth, what the hell! Only Cas didn't walk off he laughed, Dean was choosing to see that as a good sign.
"A dog, Sammy I love that idea," smiled Gabriel thinking along the lines of something small and fluffy.
Gabriel, ever fearless ripped off the paper off, sounding louder than it had any right to be. All it revealed was a white box, keeping it turned toward himself and Sam he opened it, Dean bracing himself for a bang or something to come shooting out.
"Chamomile tea, it's supposed to be soothing coffee will just make you tense." one day Dean knew his health nut brother would be the death of him.
"What's got you so glum?" Dean looks up at his Dad as he clears the table while Mary gets dessert ready. Delicious homemade apple pie. "Come on, Dean you walked out of school leaving Sam without a ride."
"It's a prank, we haven't opened it," Dean answered not wishing to see Gabriel's face flair with anger he kept his eyes trained on the package.
Otherwise, he was really looking forward to his near future, his brother was keen to see an author who wrote about dessert dwelling treasure hunters or something. The kid was a complete nerd at least Dean kept it cool by only showing his excitement for the films even if he was a devourer of graphic novels.
"Yeah, we were really busy, how come you're spending a morning in a coffee shop, property slow today." joked Dean finally going in for a piece of pie, God it was delicious and Dean knew pecan pie.
"Gabe, I'm in this for the long haul, I love you," Gabriel would never hear that enough no matter how many time Sam would say it, "Having kids is hard but I think we'd be pretty great at it only I was hoping we could get a dog first."
"You win," he screamed breathing heavily as Sam retreated his eyes looking so fondly at Gabriel it made him blush. "Why don't you grab a shower and I'll wrangle Cassie." suggested Gabriel not moving a muscle since he wanted to leer at his ridiculous boyfriend only Sam didn't move either, the bastard, "Sammy," he whined.
"Effortless, and we're such polar opposites, he was tiny and loved sugar." Sam rubs his eyes wanting to keep the tears at bay at least until he's off the phone. "He would pull me into his chest and wrap his arms around me, normally my partners don't think to do that."
"Oh yeah! This is the place," Dean turned to find a small man with golden hair and even more striking golden eyes clutching a bag of fun size 100 Grand bars. "Cassie I found them with your dress shirts, thank God! Couldn't locate my musketeers though."
Coming into the house he shouts upstairs for Dean, quickly realizing how stupid that was as Dean descends the stairs.
"Yes, he can be fucking scary when he wants to be." it had to be true if Sam was admitting to something that would be worth teasing him over for the foreseeable future.
"I went to see Gabriel, then had dinner at The Roadhouse." Dean nodded hoping another fight wouldn't start.
"It's true, you're still here living your life. You took a risk befriending me, even with everything you've been through you put yourself out there and Dean, I'm really glad you did." Dean looked deep into Cas' blue eyes for proof of him being mocked but all he found was the truth.
Moving he soon had Cas crowded against the sink, those beautiful eyes were awash with fear. Oh shit! After everything Cas had been through recently that probably wasn't the best move, quickly Dean stepped back, "I'm sorry, Cas, I didn't mean to freak you out."
"Um, I think he took a shine to one of my guys, Benny," Gabriel managed to refrain from jumping out of his chair, only just.
"Yeah I know, I'll say goodbye to Henry before grabbing my things from the car." smiling again Cas walked over to Henry, Dean stood compelled to watch never feeling more thankful for Henry's school trip than he did now, soon he's moving until he's next to the man.
After a few moments of silence in which lies a couple aborted attempts, Dean finally broaches the issue, "How do you tell someone you like them?" he asks directing the question at both of his parents.
Seeing Dean looking all lost and tired had him wanting to pull the younger man into his arms, Cas blamed the blushing. He hoped Dean wanted the same but he knew there were things left unsaid, he wasn't sure if he was the best thing for Dean at the moment and felt too scared to risk pushing things.
"Oh God, I don't have overdue books do I?" asked Cas alarmed for Ms Moseley was not to be trifled with under any circumstances.
"It can't be just anything, it has to mean something." with that said Charlie gave him a look that was far too gushy.
"No, its just enthusiasm, Dean do you have any popcorn?" asks Gilda searching his cupboards and finding it before he can answer. "Cas you might want to get some coffee on, Charlie will be planning on watching the first three films at least." Dean watches them hoping they were going to become friends.
"Ready Bro?" asked Gabriel smiling happily at his younger Seraph brother, it was to be their first Christmas with the Winchesters after finally finding them. All those years of not knowing where or how their mates were had been near torture, but they were determined to make up for lost time. especially with their first Christmas.
Hoping whoever was ringing the bell would soon grow bored and give up Cas settled back down opening the message.
Earthy? Finding the thought more than a little alluring, Dean thought about it some more wondering if Cas used cologne. Perhaps something citrusy? Something that would go well with the scent of earth.
"Yeah, I found these videos on Youtube about having the perfect Christmas I thought we could watch them," Dean looked at Sam dumbfounded but his Brother had already engaged the puppy eyes.
"Hey Sam," he started forcing himself to stick with Sam, "Look I'm really sorry okay, you can tell Gabriel everything."
"Dean bring us some bacon!" shouted Gabriel resulting in a shriek from Charlie, "Oops, quickly guys my marvelous smile won't be enough to pacify, Red, I've pissed her off big time. Surely you don't want my death on your conscience."
"So you guys both have the hots for a Novak brother?" Dean's glare stopped in his tracks noticing the dreamy far off look Sam was currently sporting.
A lot was riding on this, to some pie was no more than a treat. For Dean it was special being something he shared with Henry and his Mom. He knew Sam wouldn't be so cruel as to tell him the wrong place, only what if he'd built that pie of wonder up in his head to unobtainable heights.
Which says a lot, though Bobby is nice enough not to comment, giving him a quick hug instead. The drive home grounds him, something Baby never fails to do.
"What's this?" she asked taking the scroll into her hand and causing Cas' heart rate to pick up as she began toying with the ribbon.
"You think Meg had something to do with it?" piped up Sam causing Dean's concentration to shift to his brother, friggin' bitch.
"Well yeah, I pretty much figured that Dean. I'm really glad you're facing up to it though I was near ready to explode." Dean laughed a little figuring he had been pretty clueless.
"Sorry Egg, if you want someone to whip up a few beetroot burgers I'm your guy," Henry made a very overdone grimace to that, Gabriel was very much in agreement.
Cas smiled before answering, "He's dropped a few out of context spoilers, I like looking out for them during the film since he comes at things in a different way to myself," that actually sounded like a lot of fun.
Truly he saw himself settling with a guy and Cas was fantasy material, ticking every one of Dean's boxes. Okay, he's got this, it's just a chat really maybe more, but he doesn't have to think that far ahead.
"Cas you went through a trauma, it'll take time getting back to normal." Dean rubbed his neck before broaching the next part, Cas always made him so nervous. "I did have an idea," (truthfully it was Ellen's idea but Cas didn't need to know that).
Dean still remembers the night Sam had come into his room a few months after moving in with Bobby. The kid had been beside himself, his face wet with tears and desperate to apologize to Dean about the fact he liked both boys and girls.
"So, your off tomorrow?" Sam follows him into the kitchen taking the beer offered perching on one of the stools.
Dean didn't normally spend his Saturday mornings at the mall, looking for gifts. Preferring to click and wait for delivery, but that wasn't an option, it wasn't personal.
"How about a date, Friday night? We could go out or I could cook and we can talk some more," suggested Cas.
Any further bargaining was stopped by the arrival of their food: Cas' eyes went wide at the sight of their two bacon cheeseburgers. This time a waitress (again someone Dean didn't recognize, had he been away for so long Ellen had changed her entire staff) set their plates in front of them. Wishing them a good meal she departed.
He and Sam had finally escaped his clutches after he'd hit Sammy, Dean had broken down confessing all to his little brother and Uncle Bobby.
"Oh I'm so glad you asked, I've been dying too, but it's silly to assume you all know each other, she's called Anna,"  Dean noticed how happy she was and wanted to know about her story.
"Oh, yes of course, sorry," he said breathily as he began to walk, to Dean it felt like a revelation that Cas could be so trusting so soon, he was in awe. They cleared through the gate quickly, Dean directing him toward the steps but no further.
This card, his card was really pretty: it was yellow with a flower and three bees in black and white, the contrast was very pleasing. Finally opening it, he was once again met with the neat writing that matched the tag, it read:
"Dean, do you realize where Gabriel went?" running his eyes around the room Dean had no clue having left Charlie in the kitchen fixing herself a sundae.
Since then Cas had like the proverbial dog with a bone, wanting to get Dean into art class especially when he found out it didn't clash with anything on his schedule. So Dean said goodbye to his afternoon naps in Baby, while not completely sold on the idea Cas' excitement had been enough to dampen his fears of hours spent drawing a bowl of fruit.
"Yep, goes on like your some kind of miracle worker." Bobby is sporting a fond smile showing he doesn't really mind. "How come you're hanging out with this eejit?" he asks motioning to Dean.
He couldn’t stop thinking about his reaction, which begged the question did Dean believe he’d lose his pants in Cas company today.
Pulling it off had been a truly proud moment, take that Cassie, he could totally keep secrets. God, this must be how spies feel or the entire Star Wars cast.
"Charlie this is Kevin, he's the one I was telling you about to do our accounts." Charlie looks at Kevin her gaze changed from slightly predatory to one of sheer hope. Dean can't help but think she's laying it on too thick.
"Hear me out Dean, I was there okay at the barbeque, you were never far from Cas and when you were you kept glancing his way."
"I need help," said Kevin and Alfie obviously all attempting to divert the conversation just as the others came through the doors.
The only difference was he hadn't been tipsy around Cas since he realized how he felt, big whoop. If he wasn't doing this bee wooing thing Dean was sure he would have told Cas by now (lie) and been what, rejected?
"Gabriel drove me." Dean has felt odd ever since his discovery, is he meant to wear this new knowledge about himself like a badge. He has no idea, just like what to do about his feelings for Cas.
"That's never bothered you before," Gabriel regards him closely which is a bad thing because he's so fucking perceptive, it's only a moment later when he gasps in delight. "You have a crush, oh brother this is awesome news to come home to."
"No, Sammy likes to be by himself for a while," answered Gabriel before Dean had the chance glad to know that Gabriel knew that much about his brother. Looking down at his food he found he'd lost his appetite.
"Cool, you're coming too right Cas?" One look at Cas' wide-eyed expression told him this was news to the gardener. Shit, that day at The Roadhouse he remembers mentioning the cinema trip, but did he extend the invitation? Of course, the answer is no, God he's a fucking idiot at times.
Half reluctantly Dean followed through to the kitchen gladly accepting a bottle of cold water before they moved toward the garden into a light filled sunroom. Dean eyed the two loveseats with caution (how strong could wicker be?), before gently sitting on one to find it actually comfortable. Cas took the second and Dean tried to hide his disappointment at the distance.
"Hey Cas," Gabriel watched Dean check out his brother, he was subtle about it but Gabriel never missed anything.
"Yeah, I had fun when was the last time you came here?" asked Cas remembering what Dean had said at breakfast.
"I'm Jesse," he introduced hold his hand out for Dean to take while gestering behind him, "And this is my husband Cesar."
Dean breathed a sigh of relief at seeing the man again, he looked a little better but still shaken. Sending a glance at Sam his brother immediately scooped Henry up taking him over to the waiting chairs.
"How would you feel right now if Cas came through that door laughing and obviously on a date with another guy?"
"Okay, whatever it is Dean it won't change my opinion of you." wow Cas already had an opinion, Dean felt unsure if he wanted to hear it or not.
He couldn't just ask him out though, Dean had issues he knew that. He'd grown with his ears permanently honed to his father's voice. He needed to let that go, finally for himself and for Henry.
Moving his eyes to the left is proof he's got the right apartment at least, (Cas' yellow door is pretty unique) which surely means Cas is dating tall, dark and handsome. Yeah, it's that bad, this guy is all three. His shoulders are broad, hair dark and eyes even darker. His suit is perfectly cut and he holds an air of sophistication far beyond Dean's capabilities.
Luckily it was a short walk, opening his office door his first thought was regret about not having a couch. It seemed Cas wanted to talk, but surely having a desk between them would be too impersonal.
Dean felt frazzled, the secret, his secret was out. He always suspected the truth to come out sooner than planned, getting this far felt like a feat in itself.
Dean opened his eyes gasping at the weight suddenly placed on his lap, “Dude that hurt!” Groaned Dean finding Sam stood over him after he’d unceremoniously dropped his laptop on Dean’s lap.
Castiel looks at him, really looks at him. Causing Dean to feel he's under a microscope. It feels like an age until he breaks his gaze, swooping down to Henry's level. "We'll search together, plants are for everyone and I like to think we all have a connection to them. Even if we don't know it, perhaps you could share everything you learned today with your Dad." Castiel encourages.
"Mr Winchester." screwing his face up in annoyance before turning around and engaging a smile. Henry's teacher Miss Davis walks over to him, he really has nothing against the woman except her constant flirting. She's attractive but the fact is she teaches his son, it just feels too damn skeevy.
"Sammy, cool it we don't even know where they live, you always get too dreamy," implored Dean ignoring bitchface number eighteen.
At first Cas doesn't understand until he remembers how Gabriel answered the phone, Gabriel asked if he was here, here meaning School. Moving quickly Cas grabs his bag and heads for the garage he opens his car to find a note hanging from the rear view mirror.
Feeling a heavy weight on his stomach Gabriel tried pulling away only to be tugged back against something hard.
“Sammy,” warned Dean feeling on show, he wasn’t good about showing his emotions though he always knew his match with Cas was meant to be romantic he was scared his love and leave them past would screw his future. But the look on Cas’ face hadn’t been blown away by the power of Netflix so battling against his fear Dean turned back to the laptop. “Dude how many tabs do you need?”
"Yep," she replied popping the p, "I'm Charlie, truth be told I'm only doing this to help out a friend and because my Angel loves the costume,"
"What the hell was that? Did you just wave?" Sam asks viewing Dean as if aliens have taken him over. At this point, he has to wonder himself. He doesn't answer, watching Castiel until he makes his way over to them carrying a tray with four coffees. His brain cannot help but wonder about the person behind each order.
"Talk to me, Baby," Sam shivered again for a completely different reason, "You like it I when I call you that, huh?"
"Please try to make it, Sam will have proper study times set up and you know Dean cooks a mean breakfast." enticed Charlie.
"Sammy, this pie is from the Gods. Where the hell did you get this?" Dean reached for the box looking it over for clues, as Sam finally took a bite of his own slice, Henry who had practically inhaled his was eyeing it greedily.
"Cas, that's the answer, if you start eating his candy he'll stop hiding it at yours." Cas showed his gratitude with a peck to the cheek whereas Gabriel glared a little.
"Uh, Sam, this is Charlie," he announced eyes wide at his brother, "And Charlie, this is my brother Sam."
Questions and nothing but practically summed up the last forty-five minutes of Cas' life, it was all: Are you okay? (Dean) Tell us what happened? How do you know the perpetrator? (police). He could tell Dean wanted answers, his constant glances were hardly subtle.
"Castiel has finally accepted my proposal of a date, it's happening tonight." he must be joking, surely Cas wouldn't, with Balthazar! Since neither Sam or Gabriel had cracked up in laughter or screamed prank at him was proof it was true, leaving Dean feeling weird.
"Yes, yes, please Dad call him before he's too busy. Please," begged Henry. "Right I'm going to get my stuff," he announced before racing out of the room as is he was being chased.
This could be a little problematic, hopefully, they're not as bull headed (Sam's words) as each other because he really wants to make nice with Cas' brother. After paying for the pie which Gabriel is nice enough to discount Dean heads back to the Impala, his three colorful boxes safely stored in the back, once back in his seat he  sends a text to Sam:
On nights when their father would leave them alone in the motel of the week, Sam would request an Angel story asking so often Dean had started making up his own suspecting Sam knew.
Walking over to the first employee he lays eyes on, a small waif of a man wearing tan cargo pants teamed with a yellow shirt: green lettering on the back with the words Join the Hive Today. The man turns around after Dean covertly coughs, the ensemble finished off with a shiny name tag declaring him Garth. "Hi welcome to Hive, what do you need today?" he smiles making Dean wonder if a sunny disposition is part of the work criteria.
“Yeah actually I haven’t eaten so you can cook me those pancakes of yours,” he replied, pulling the door back to let her through.
"Dean he loves Cas, it's fine to be scared when taking a leap into something new and I know this is difficult for you because of Dad. But denying yourself something like this will hurt you more in the long run and Henry too."
"Fine," Benny went to leave stopping at the door, "Dean, look I know you've got loads running through that head of yours but Cas was never for me,"
"Mother fucker!" shouts Dean both from the pain and surprise visit, definitely worse while watching a ghost show, not that Dean was scared by a TV show of course.
"Hey I don't need you arranging dates like a toddler!" the voice made Gabriel a little weak in the knees, God, what an accent.
“This one?” he asked holding tree number, actually Dean had lost count due to the fact that Cas was sending Gabriel pictures of each specimen, without the use of phones.
"I was just checking over a stock issue, I apologize for interrupting you, Dean. If you wish to be alone I'll go back to my office." Cas sounded all sad and hurt making Dean feel like an absolute dick.
"I thought I heard something." then a second later, "Dean, I think someone's trying to get in." Cas' voice was laced with fear, he sounded terrified and what followed was the unmistakable sound of breaking glass.
"Same here, Red," agreed Dean just as his phone rang, "Hold that other thought," he said pulling his cell from his pocket. Why was Sammy ringing him? "Sammy, What's up?"
"Dean, maybe you just took him by surprise or he was trying to hold himself back. You should talk to him."
"You little brat," Sam began tickling him causing Gabriel to laugh as his eyes filled with happy tears.
Shooing Cas upstairs Gabriel waits until he's out of sight before opening the front door to Dean and Henry.
"They'll be fine with me Dean, I'll get them a drink and we'll mingle." Dean looked at Cas who nodded flashing that small cute smile of his.
Days later Dean was doing his best not to run into Cas, he'd managed by working extra and even helping out at The Roadhouse. More than Cas playing on his mind was what Sam had told him about his own heartbreak.
"Dude, what the hell is that?" Sam was always telling him off for eating too much of the delicious dessert.
"For me?" Henry didn't even wait for an answer before throwing his arms around Cas much to the surprise of the man in question and Dean. The shock of it almost had Cas falling backward, once they were righted Dean approached grabbing the bag.
He hated doing it but what other option was there, he couldn't unleash all these feelings on Cas. They were Dean's responsibility and he would master it until he was ready to talk. But he could for now at least talk to his son.
"There you are, come on Sammy I want to put our purchases away before lunch," moaned Dean before noticing Gabriel. "Oh hey," he acknowledged his hand moving to his neck, Gabriel blinked slightly thrown by the nervous gesture.
"I'm trying to figure out his favorite dessert so I can make it and I'm buying him a gift. Could you
Besides he had a nice table and a big comfy chair when his desk became too restricting. Even Henry preferred to color in the break room when he was here, mainly because he loved the attention from the work crew. He had them wrapped around his little finger.
The Car show had expanded so much since he last went, they didn't even stop for lunch, rather grabbing takeaway burritos and coffee to continue sightseeing. Cas had got a little covered in sauce causing Dean to fight the urge to wipe it off with his finger or his lips.
"You should invite him over to watch the game, leave a note for him on his door if you don't think you can ask him," she suggested which actually sounded like a good idea.
"Sammy! You look fine." Henry gave the eye roll he'd learned from his Dad, "Come on." he implored reaching for the door handle.
Dean crouches down in front of him, "Cas, I'm going to make some calls and we'll be on our way." nothing, he gets up to stand when Cas grabs him.
Not a quiet car to park either it stopped in front of Cas' house with its usual loud rumble that had the house door flinging open spilling light into darkness as well as a worried Gabriel, phones clutched tightly in each hand.
It didn't take long, thankfully only a necessary amount of tape was used, the paper fell away to reveal three cute looking chocolate bars, each a different flavor with a bee on the front, in fact, they were called Bee Bars!
Sam broke out into a glowing smile followed by puppy eyes, "No Sam! Put those away right this second, you look like you're planning what to wear at the wedding,"
“They would have called,” calmed Meg coming through the swing doors from the kitchen, “We’re all set so let’s get these guys to their stations,” announced Meg immediately moving to herd Alfie, Benny, Charlie, Gilda and Kevin into the kitchen, “Filter around guys we’ll leave this end for the late arrivals,”
"I don't believe that for a second but I'll let it go for pizza," he teased watched the three breathe a sigh of relief, Gabriel moving to take the place next to him.
"For you to choose from, I think five pies is slightly too much which is saying something coming from me. So the two fruit ones are rhubarb and strawberry, and the classic apple, the cloud is peach and apricot, we have pecan caramel and lastly a chocolate marzipan swirl." Gabriel pointed at each one, making Dean more torn with each introduction.
known. Opening his eyes he found himself on the couch at the Winchester's, warm thanks to an extremely soft brown blanket.
"He was an absolute treasure, we've finished for the day. Everyone is picking out a plant for the project. Having the kids look after a plant, using what we've learned today." she smiled.
He shouldn't be doing this or thinking such things but it's too good a mix of arousal and desire pooling in his stomach. He rolls his hips up pushing himself against his hand, all the while stroking faster, always faster. He's so close until finally, he comes hard to the image of Cas looking at him as if he's a tasty morsel to be eaten.
Saying it didn't make it less weird, was she finally crawling out of that dark tunnel she spent the last few months in? The very one that had led her away from blue eyes and a goofy giant to break bread with Alistair and Lillith?
The sight of it had been heartbreaking, making Dean want to punch his hand through Baby's window. It was a feeling he never wanted to experience again, Baby was faultless as always. But the sight of those tears had him hot and pissed.
"No, I want to kiss you first," Dean nodded and not a second later their mouths crashed together, starting sweet but soon becoming more demanding. Cas smartly rolled his hips again causing Dean to gasp, it was enough for Cas to slide his tongue inside to get his first real taste of his human.
Right, well he was certain spies had to be demure to (certainly it wasn't the way of a movie star) let phase two of his training commence! Once he was close enough Gabriel opted to cough lightly rather than scream Sam's name.
The day had been a success and Cas had really enjoyed the impromptu movie marathon. It had been fun, a few people had stayed remaining quiet to heed Charlie's warning. Cas had loved the films choosing to sit next to Dean(screw you Benny), remaining close the whole time.
"Dean, take a breath." Dean did as instructed, surprised at how good it felt, "Okay continue when you're ready."
His eyes shift to Sam as he stands to gather their dishes he shoots his brother a look of thanks, not being good at the emotional crap Dean finds it easier without an audience. "I'm sorry Henry, you shouldn't care what I or anyone else thinks okay. If you like plants, that's all that matters, I just want you to be happy." Dean kisses the top of his son's head, unsure of how long he can get away with things like that.
"Let's go to my office," Dean took Cas' hand leading him away sure it would add fuel to Charlie's already overblown fire but he didn't care. His only purpose was to get away from more prying eyes.
"Dean, please tell that's still your second beer? asked Sam alarmingly as he returned to the lounge.
Leaving Benny and Victor to it and wanting to escape his feelings Dean walks over to speak to Gadreel and his newest recruit Aaron.
Shaking the image away so not to get ahead of himself he rubbed his eyes before looking at Sam, "I really like him,"
"Something like that, the one on the end has been playing up for days, only now it's dead. Someone came to look at it as part of a contract already in place, only -" Dean doesn't give Cas chance to finish.
Cas could only agree before burying his head in his hands, he really wished he could have his brothers attitude at times. Gabriel would lap up this kind of attention, bragging about it to all and sundry whereas Cas felt adrift.
Dean was considerate taking the time to tell Cas the make, model and what made each car special. Whether or not he'd been lucky enough to work on a similar car and how that had gone down.
