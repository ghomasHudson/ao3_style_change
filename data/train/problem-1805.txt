Dislocated knee: significant damage of ligaments, possible nerve damage and vascular injury.
Nita started walking again, John next to her. They walked around the area, looking in dead end alleys, underneath the bridge and in several abandoned houses.
Despite his own tears, John felt a small smile coming onto his face.
"I brought you something."
"Sleep is for the weak? God, look at this! You're brilliant! Let's work this out further, shall we, handsome?"
The angel should be pleased to know that he had seen him and acknowledged him. But the angel started to cry again. Big tears rolling over his cheeks. Poor thing. He wanted to hold the angel in his arms, to comfort him and tell him that everything was going to be alright. But instead, his body trembled again, causing pain, making him black out once more.
"I was planning to."
"Yer look'n for the detective?"
"Again?"
Esmeralda phoned them early Thursday afternoon, to tell them that the art class of that evening was cancelled. The heater had broken down again, and it was way to cold to work in the school at the moment. And they were going to fix it first thing on Friday. That meant they had the whole evening for themselves.
John obeyed and walked after her through the house.
"Is he in trouble?"
"Yes."
"They're not idiots, Sherlock. And they're just trying to help."
"Who's he calling?"
"What does he do for a living then?"
John looked at Nita, tears welling up in his eyes, he fought them back and scraped his throat.
John put the glasses down with a grin and poured them both a glass with the honey coloured liquid.
"No."
John stood up from his bed on which he had been lying, trying to read, but his mind to far away. The room was barely lit, but John could see the redness of the detective's eyes.
John could just hear the smirk on Sherlock's face when he said that.
"I'm sorry John. It's my fault. I got him focusing on the work here, and we lost track of time. I need to get some rest anyway. We can work further tomorrow."
"I'm happy for you. Not everybody gets the chance to find someone to love and get the same in return. Ow, hi Carla."
Sherlock looked up, a bit affronted.
"Jesus..."
"Can you two hold it just a few minutes? I need to give you the details."
Nita squeezed his upper arm.
"You're a bloody idiot not telling me things. You were married to your work, you weren't interested in things like sentiment and emotions. And I believed you. Every time I thought I saw you looking at me with more than friendship in your eyes, I thought it was something I imagined. Wishful thinking. You never said a word.
John gave him a little smile back, as to comfort him.
"No, I haven't."
"Deal. Let's go and ask some more around. I'll go outside to smoke, you'll cover the cafeteria? Try to talk to Mark, I'll try to talk to David."
Ava feigned ignorance.
"Stable."
"Curry of course. And can you hand me one of the bottles of great wine you bought? That would be splendid."
How could he be so stupid. John wasn't an idiot. At least not so much as everybody else. He would know what had happened. He would figure out it wasn't a game for him anymore. John would find out about his feelings for him and he would leave. John would leave to go somewhere safe, meet a boring woman, have a boring wedding, take a boring mortgage and buy a boring house in a boring street, work at some boring doctors office and maybe even get some boring kids and live a dull domestic ordinary boring life together. Like a happy little family.
"He might be. I need to rush. Thank you again, Nita. I couldn't have done it without your help." John squeezed the woman's arm and turned away, heading towards the Mainstreet again.
"Can you please enlighten me?"
"You? Going out? I wouldn't miss it for the world. Figure out where he is going, so we can go there ourselves tonight."
"I'm fine. Why shouldn't I be?"
Dull. Stupid. Boring.
Esmeralda put the drawing back upside down and Sherlock went out. He really needed some air.
"Yes."
"Don't be an idiot. You know what I mean."
"Anything on the tailing?"
"You did? Was it... Good?"
Ava looked at John, her face serious.
"An accident?" Sherlock was paying attention to his brother now.
"As a matter of fact, I have. Yes. Thank you. Did you sleep?"
" I'm going to go and sleep now. It's not even late at night anymore, but more early in the morning. I suggest you try and do the same. We have a long day tomorrow, you and me. I think I'll might paint you tomorrow again, when the colouring has evolved further. You're skin changes so quick. It's just beautiful. To bad you can't see yourself. You are truly a piece of art like this. One of the best models I ever worked with. I do hope you manage to stay alive for at least two days. The fun is not over yet. And do you know how hard it is to find a good model these days? But, when your job is done, I know who will be my next muse. Although doctor Watson's is a bit old for my taste, his skin does have more of a golden tone. I do think he'll make a beautiful bruising canvas, don't you think? Or maybe he looks better scattered with blood? We'll see."
O god. He was too late.
"You're enjoying the course." He stated.
The email was from an art school in London. They had evening classes for adults, where they gave lessons in portraits and working from a living model. The models were hired from an agency specialised in art models, or they were people who volunteered to work with them. The problem was, that some of the models had disappeared after a few lessons. They were listed as missing persons. The four missing models were all male and between thirty and forty years old. The first one went missing three years ago. All the female models were left alone, as were the male models younger than thirty and older than forty. It took a long time before anyone saw the connection between the missing men, because of the time span between the missings, and the fact that the men had no other connections with each other.
"Yes. Is your brother still thinking that we are on track?"
"I know." He said, stroking the dark curls now. Sherlock did smell like fire and smoke.
"I'm going in to get some coffee and warm up a bit. I've still got at least two more hours to sit still for you guys. See you inside."
"Yeah. Matter of speech. I installed a program on your desktop that will set this whole lab on fire."
Thank you all for your feedback and kudos! I just love them!!
"Then I'll stay with my first answer."
"Good, Sh..Gerald. Although I think you've got some heads spinning with that crack of yours." John said, flushing a bit.
"Yes. They came to ask me about it."
"Do you now?"
Yes. That drawing could wait.
Marc Jenkins. He was going to kill that man! Sherlock looked high or drunk when he got into the car with that man, that was what Mellon had said. But it had been no more than five minutes after he left the pub. He had no time to use something in that short period, could he? And he drank two pints. He knew Sherlock couldn't handle to much alcohol, but two pints wasn't exactly much.
Another hard strike, full on the kidney this time. Sherlock let out a small huff, making Marc smile.
John turned on his back again.
John woke up. He turned himself onto his back, feeling his jeans turn around his waist and legs. Shit. He forgot to take them off last night. He squeezed an eye open and looked at his clock on the nightstand. Four forty six in the morning. Good. That meant he still had a few hours to go. He unbuttoned his jeans and wriggled himself out of them, pushing the jeans off the bed with his feet. He reached for his blanket to put over himself again and let himself enjoy the warmth of his bed and the silence of the early morning.
As soon as the man turned around to get the bartenders attention, John grabbed his phone and started typing.
"Wiliam Sherlock Scott Holmes, you are a bloody idiot."
"Listen to me, little brother. We are in a crisis, and I don't have time for this. Will you just listen to me?"
John rolled his eyes dramatically and smirked at his roommate. His eyes went down and up again, and the smirk on his face became even bigger.
"How are you feeling?" John asked Ava. She smiled at him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes for Ava to see and turned his desk chair around.
"I know. The serum helps slowing the infection down."
They talked. There was just so much they could do. Sherlock wasn't going to be released just yet, so John was sitting next to the hospital bed as much as possible. The first three nights he had spent in the hospital, but the two nights after that he went home to sleep. After their confessions to each other, John stayed the night in the chair again. The next day, Sherlock had almost panicked because John wasn't there when he woke up. When John came in ten minutes later freshly showered and with a hot cup of coffee, he assured him that he didn't change his mind, and that the conversation of yesterday really had taken place.
What had he done?
"Always."
"What is it, John? Is there something wrong?" He asked, blinking his eyes a few times.
"It's good that you are awake, I'm going to prepare you, and that is so much more fun when you can enjoy it too." Marc said, stepping to the right side of the dimly lit room. He started to move something and Sherlock felt the bounds on his arms pull upward. He was hoisted up until his toes barely touched the ground.
The streets were almost empty. It was already five o'clock in the morning and the city was asleep. It had taken him nine hours to figure out where Sherlock was, and he wasn't even certain yet.
"There not as good as you are. Can I see your work now?"
"Thanks, Angie. I hope so too."
"Now I'm pissed." John said, lying on his back on his bed, still fully dressed, while Sherlock was trying to get his pyjamas on.
"Nicked another one?" John asked, nodding towards the jumper.
"What did you tell them?"
"Aren't we all? But no. With that brain activity they could be just as well be goldfish, pretty. They're all just subjects now. I can't see them as humans anymore. They are way beyond that state."
"Steady. It's not getting worse."
"Not yet. Like I said, I was waiting for you, silly. Oh, Shit, that's hot!"
It was to much effort to respond. Instead he listened to the sound of that voice.
"How do you mean? You can sit at the desk?"
"It works..." Ava whispered.
"No, but you are both too smart for your own good. And you both are people readers. And you put other things above yourself, while being clinical about it."
John felt a splint of pain, not being the focus of this man's attention at this matter. But he pushed it back before giving himself away.
You know, this is the second time I cried in my whole adult life. Sure I've shred tears before, but those were out of physical pain, or part of an act. I once told you that I had full control over my body. You are the only thing except pain or drugs that manage to let me lose that control. My transport reacts on you. It does things out of itself, ignoring my instructions. You make my heart rate speed up. You make my skin blush and feel overheated. You make my head spin and my cock hard and you even make me cry. You did all of that. One man with all that power over me. I would never have thought it possible.
Sherlock thought about it for a few seconds.
"Doctor Watson? Are you alright?" Nita asked him worried. She knelled down besides him, checking his temperature with the back of her hand. And she felt the man shaking.
Sherlock's heart restarted itself when he realized John was talking about his sketchbook and not the thoughts in Sherlock head, while John got up and went to his bedroom to get some of his work.
Sherlock looked his friend in the eyes and all he could see was worry and care. He felt the tears coming up again and tried to fight them back.
"He kept an eye on you, then."
John started typing.
"Mostly, yes. I managed to sleep some hours."
Sherlock shrugged and looked back to the papers in front of him.
Sherlock lifted one corner of his mouth in a small smile.
"Caring is not an advantage, brother mine."
After one and a half hour, Sherlock felt his back getting irritated. He shifted a bit on his chair which Esmeralda noticed, and she immediately called for a break.
"I noticed that you never look at the works of the class, and when we talk about techniques, you listen but don't participate."
"We can't plan with who we fall in love with. That's the beauty of it, isn't it?"
"Told you we should take it slow. You need your body to heal first."
Ava smiled at him.
"Alive, I guess. Thank you for all your effort, John. I really appreciate it. God, I love Thai!"
"How... how long before..."
"He told me that it wouldn't work. He said that we were to much the same, wanting to be pleased."
"John! Fancy the pub tonight?"
"You do that often. About what?"
Sherlock tried to open his eyes and sit up. His body spasmed directly, the pain intense. The pink colour stayed, but there were black spots coming back in his eyesight. His whole body was on fire again.
Underneath the bandage John could see discolouring of the skin, open wounds that didn't really seemed to bleed, and a beginning of gangrene.
"Okay, so I have made an ampule with hopefully enough dose to sedate my friend Beth."
My body is cramping now. My muscles are sore and despite it all, my empty stomach is rumbling. I haven't eaten in five or six days, I can't remember precisely. The heat in this country is suffocating. It feels like dust in my lungs, sticky across my skin. I don't like this warmth. Have I told you that I covered myself up to hide away from my attackers? I'm wearing a turban and a djellaba, trying to mingle with the people in the streets, but I am to tall. The people here are shorter than in London, they all seem to have the same height as you. Or it could just be my imagination.
Sherlock turned the paper and began reading the rest of the file.
Sherlock didn't even want to move. Everything hurt. He couldn't open his eyes properly, but he could imagine what he looked like. He could feel the bruising's burning all over his body. He did always bruise easily. His body would be red and swollen here and there, the dark blue and purple would take time to show up, at least a few hours. He was really not looking forward to that. His body would have all different kind of shades. He moved again. His hands were getting more blood now the blood flow wasn't cut of anymore due to his own weight. They had started to tingle and now it felt as if they were on fire. He heard a stool behind him scrape over the floor. And Marc was standing in front of him again.
Sherlock looked at her.
"It's stupid." Ava replied.
John kissed him.
Sherlock had recovered sooner than expected. (Of course he did. It was Sherlock after all.)
"Have I told you I like you, too?" Ava said between two shallow breaths.
My heart has broken the day that you jumped. Seeing you fall down from that rooftop has broken me. Your gorgeous body laying broken on the pavement, the most beautiful and most observing eyes I had ever seen staring up into the sky without observing anything anymore. That genius brain stilled, bleeding, broken. That was the day I died myself. My life had ended. It wasn't just your heart that had stopped beating as soon as you hit that pavement, my heart had stopped, too.
"I will. Just... Hurry, Mycroft. "
"And?"
"Yeah saw 'im. 'Bout eight hours ago. Gett'n our man in 'es car. looked high, or drunk. Couldn't get any clos'r. Happened at Bear's."
Ava grinned.
“No, John, both. We need to see if this mutation was inflicted on purpose, or that it was an accident. And i want to see if the virus has spread beyond the gates of the facility.”
"Don't mock. Well have enough time for that when you're recovered."
"Yes well, that makes two of us."
Gone was the sound of your deep rumbling voice, muttering against me, shouting, laughing or holding a monologue. Gone. Completely gone. And the thought of the sounds never returning was just to much to bare for me.
She soundly retreated back against the wall, while Sherlock was banging on the glass. It worked. Clive staggered towards him, and pressed his face against the glass.
"You will."
"Can't wait to touch you, to get to know that part of you."
"Mycroft send me the files of the developed medicine. Some brain scans from the monkeys with it. It seems like the infection only starts after the subject wakes up from the coma. At first they seemed to get better, but in a few days the brain activity reduces, to go back to a minimal within one week after the first signs. That means that the infected subjects are aware of the change at first."
"Yeah, that's it. Care for a hug?"
Sherlock looked at the cover of the sketchbook, before opening it carefully.
Requires Draining Excess Air.
"I managed to do this in the past. But only with people I felt a special connection to. People who got close to me, hit me in some way, I guess. But I never managed to get it so much like this before."
"O, fuck, John..."
Do you have any idea what you did to me? I imagine you don't. Although I like to think that in a way that you did. The way you made my head spin, the way I lost track of my musings every time just because you came into my head to interfere again.
"Care for a drink?" He asked Sherlock from his spot in the kitchen. Sherlock looked up from the papers scattered in his lap.
"I knew there was something about you! Why are you here?! Why are you tailing me?!"
"Yeah, you can say something like that. I used to draw a lot. But then I went working abroad and I never found the time again. So it has been a few years."
One day he was gone. I saw him again several weeks later. Clean shaven, pretty clothes, and apparently off drugs. He asked me if I wanted to help him with a case. All I had to do was keep my eyes open. He offered me money for it, which I declined, because we were friends. But he left a couple of hundreds for me anyway. I helped him out that time. And the next, and the next, before he came back to us. Back shooting up, I mean. It had been almost a year since his last rehab. We bought together, used together, and when he overdosed himself I called an ambulance for him. I remember when he came back, he told me that if it ever happened again, that I had to call a certain number, and to look in his pockets for a note.
"No. Otherwise I'll come out of this bed and snog yòu senseless."
While thinking about the pink cheeks of his roommate, and asking himself if there was more skin of him that turned pink when the man was in certain circumstances, Sherlock growled.
John had fell asleep in the chair next to the bed. When he woke up, he saw Sherlock looking at him.
"I mean it, Sherlock. No Indiana Jones."
When Sherlock sat there being drawn, he only seemed to have eyes for him. It was too much. That torso covered in goose bumps, nipples hard, Sherlock's eyes boring in his. John had gotten hard instantly, as if he was some hormone driven teenager. He had looked at Sherlock as if he wanted to devour him. Own him. And Sherlock had seen that. When that damn droplet had run down the man's chest, John had to look away. And afterwards, Sherlock hadn't confronted him with it. The man who always wanted to know everything didn't ask. Had he parted himself so far from human feelings and emotions that he didn't recognize it? Had he deleted it or was he really that oblivious about what he had seen in John's eyes? No, it couldn't be. Last Thursday they had a connection. Talking, drinking. Sherlock carefully asking questions as if he was some shy bird that could fly away every second. Sherlock had looked at him, and if he was honest with himself, he thought he saw affection in those eyes. Then, John had seen him looking in the sketchbook he had given him. There were definitely emotions on his face at that point.
"Yes, pretty, we know. Now hush, I'm interrogating your friend about you."
He wished he had never come back from his grave. Or even better, he wished he had never met the man. He should have overdosed himself when he had the chance. Leaving this world without ever feeling this sort of pain.
"Yes. So does John."
"But you weren't."
"Yes. But I've known Mycroft for years now. Although I call him Mister Holmes."
Fucking hell! Where was he?
"I tried some. But it was never as satisfying as working with pencils. I'm not the type who can wait for paint to dry. And things like charcoal is too messy for me."
But when John saw Sherlock's frown he asked;
"Are you sure your man isn't a professional artist?"
Dullness for eternity. Maybe this was hell after all. He heard the angel cry. Had he thought out loud? Was the angel so disappointed in him because he thought heaven would be boring? Did angels cry? Never heard of such a thing. It sure wasn't good. Angels shouldn't cry. Maybe he had to apologise or something. Try to be nice.
All there was, was silence.
"I don't want you to die, Ava."
"Imagine Sherlock with brain damage."
"I know. But you should stop acting like a coward and give it a try. You two are good together. I don't even think that Sherlock Holmes and Ava Jones is a better combination than Sherlock Holmes and John Watson will be. You love him, Sherlock. Don't let that go to waste."
"Was that why you couldn't sleep last night?"
John had ended the phone call with Esmeralda and assuring her he would inform Gerald. Then he had made tea for Sherlock and himself, putting a cup next to Sherlock's elbow, (replacing the full cold mug that was standing there) and then he sat down in his chair with his novel, which he wasn't reading. The fire was burning and the rain was ticking against the window. It was comfortable inside, If you could ignore the dark cloud hanging above Sherlock's head. His mind wandered off again. Thinking about how to fill his night now he wasn't going to draw. Maybe he should give Greg a call, seeing if the man had any time for a pint in the pub tonight. "You can draw something at home, you know." Sherlock said, breaking the silence.
"O Jesus."
"Jesus, John, stop."
"Yes, no. I don't know. I'm not sure if I can handle that. You understand what I mean?"
"I saw him. I saw the state he was in. God. Any other man would have died. John was certain of it. I could see it in his face. He's a doctor, he knows these things."
"Fortunately, I've been working on some things myself. You can open the spreadsheet on my computer."
Sherlock sat down on his own desk, his face towards the glass. He looked at her, a small sad smile on his face. He put his hand against the glass. After a few seconds, Ava did the same.
"This is beautiful." Sherlock said his voice not more than a whisper.
John asked baffled.
"Yes, you always managed to bring home the most boring and dull ones you could find."
John looked around him for something he could use to do something for him, anything. Finally he got up and grabbed the roll of paper next to one of the artworks Jenkins had made of Sherlock. John didn't look at it. He didn't want to see. With the paper he gently cleaned the vomit from Sherlock's jaw and chin, and the urine and blood from his abdomen, groin and thighs. Carefully watching Sherlock's breathing and heartbeat. They were both shallow and quick, but stable.
"Mycroft."
"Yes. You've been a great help. Thank you."
"Aren't you going to see him?"
"Obviously. I was scared."
Sherlock smiled at the insult.
The class dismissed for coffee and tea and the occasional smoke. John waited in the classroom for Sherlock. He hadn't seen him the whole day, and he felt the need to be close to him. When Sherlock got out of the room walking towards him, john saw that he was wearing one of his jumpers again.
John stood up from his chair and started to walk wobbly towards the door. Sherlock turned towards Ava again.
When he came back this time, he managed not to moan or move. His head felt clear, strangely clear, although his vision was probably still blurry. He couldn't even open his eyes anymore because of the swelling. Breathing was hard, laying still was hard. He thought he had never been in so much pain before. He tried to make a mental map of his injuries, to keep his brain busy and his mind clear.
"Two years, one month and sixteen days, then."
"Sorry?"
"Here?"
John turned back towards Sherlock.
Nita turned around to John, who shrugged his shoulders and looked very guilty. He had told Nita what happened, so when she saw the look on his face, she knew enough. They were on the right track.
"True. Love looking at that arse of yours. And besides, are you in a hurry? If you don't want to sit model anymore you just have to say so..."
"Would you?"
"She told me about your history together. She told me about your addiction, getting clean and eventually staying clean. And the reason for it."
"You look like him."
She put her hand on his, and when John saw the warmheartedness smile she gave him he smiled back.
"You two fell for each other."
"He did what?!"
"Who took out the ammo?"
John followed Nita inside the small house situated on Charing Cross Road. It looked less like a crack-house than the other buildings he had visited tonight, but it still was one, of course. Nita seemed to know where she was going and John followed her. He had checked the gun behind his waistband before they had gotten inside here, but he still felt uncomfortable.
Sherlock squeezed John's hand in respond, and John walked away, leaving Sherlock behind on his own.
"O, god. Donna. Yes, actually, I am. "
It was the first time he saw one of the brain dead in real life. And the one once called Clive was walking into the room.
"Daniel got to close and ripped it off. He managed to chew off his hand, or, I think he did. That way he got loose. I had to put him down last night."
"He just snorted. Then I told him he gained weight again."
"It's Tuesday, well, technically Wednesday. A week day. I need to go to work tomorrow. Can't fall asleep treating patients, can I? You go and keep that big brain of yours busy figuring everything out. You can tell me all about it in the morning, okay?" John stood up and stretched himself. Sherlock's eyes were lingering at him again. John gave him a sleepy smile and walked towards the stairs to his bedroom.
"Well, you can take that quite literally."
John got up from his chair next to the hospital bed and walked towards the window, looking outside. It was dark out, and raining, of course, so there wasn't much to see.
Sherlock interrupted annoyed.
"What is this case about?"
Our friends were worried. I could tell. Greg called me regularly, and dragged me down with him to the pub. Molly asked me to come for dinner on several occasions, and I did give in a few times. Mrs Hudson asked me to do some small things around the house, stuffing me with tea and cookies when I was there, complaining that I had lost so much weight. They all tried so hard to make me feel better, to take away some of this pain. They were in pain too. They missed you too. But not the way I did. They didn't have to struggle with the silence, with a dead heart in their chest. They could see the good in things, move on, enjoying the small things in life. But I just could not. And it hurt me to see that our friends were worrying themselves because of me. So I took a distance. I didn't answer the phone every time Greg called anymore, and I told Molly I just couldn't make it. I've had been almost honest with Mrs. Hudson. Telling her that it hurt to much to be there in Bakerstreet, and she seemed to understand. I took my distance, and not just from my friends. I stepped back from every day life. Stopped going to my psychiatrist, stopped going to work, I even stopped caring about my physique. I didn't go to the gym anymore, but I did ran five or six times a week. I ran until I could only feel the soreness of my muscles and the burning of my lungs, instead of the pain in my dead heart and the tears of death butterflies in my stomach. I didn't bother to shave myself anymore and I started a drinking habit. Alcohol I could manage, better than dinner. My body accepted the poison I poured down my throat every evening before I went to bed.
"A bit. Not as much as you are. Just promise me that you'll look after yourself, okay?"
In the cafeteria, John laughed at something Donna said, taking another sip of his coffee. Marc was talking to Phil, and before John could have joined them, he was greeted by Donna, who was curious about him. She was asking him all sorts of questions about his art, his work, and eventually his relationship status.
"Sherlock? I think it's time."
"Goodbye, Doctor Watson."
"I spoke to Angie, she told me to come looking for you. Look, I know it's strange, but have you seen him?"
"That's a monkey, Ava."
"They are humans, Sherlock."
"And you say that I am going to be the death of you?"
"Well, in that case, maybe you can help me with David. He's quite a busy man. I just overheard him say that he is going out tonight. Care to join me?"
"You can't draw me when you're so close."
This chapter is a bit darker then the previous ones. so a little warning here!
"Ready."
He came back into the room and looked more at John than Sherlock.
And so he did. Greg got called away after an hour, and he left Mycroft alone in the room.
John closed his eyes and lowered his back, leaning both hands on the sink in front of him. The butterflies in his stomach fluttering happy around.
"Shut up."
"Sherlock Holmes."
Breath. Act normal. You're a grown man, he's a grown man. He's your roommate for God's sake! It's just Sherlock. Just ignore the heat settling in your stomach and groin. Don't think about all the things you want to do with him. Do not get aroused in a full classroom. You're not fifteen anymore.
Ava sighed.
"Are you talking about the monkey's?"
"The human skin is something special. When you get your angle right, you can create a whole new colour palette. Yellow Ochre, Phthalocyanine Blue, Dioxazine Purple, and so forth. It gives more dept in the painting."
"Sherlock? John, what's going on? Was that Sherlock Holmes? The detective?" David asked pressing.
Sherlock's face lit up and looked genuinely happy.
"Is he?"
They took a cab to the art school. It wasn’t raining this time, but the sun was already settling itself behind the horizon, making the air drop a few degrees. John held a folder in his hand in which he could stack his work later tonight. Sherlock was wearing those ridiculous tight jeans again, and had put on a jumper that John had never seen before. By the looks of it, Sherlock had purchased it himself. It fitted him perfectly and even though it was a jumper, it still looked posh as hell. John looked out of the window and smirked.
Instead of repressing the feeling as he usually did, he let it flow over him. He felt his cheeks redding and his heart beat hard against his ribs. The realization hit him. After four years since meeting this remarkable man, his feelings hadn't changed a bit, but only had gone stronger. He was still deeply in love with this wonderful, beautiful man.
"Sherlock..."
"Just tell me, John. I'm not going to figure it out."
"Hmmm."
John managed to smile at the young woman.
"I said, fuck off!"
"Life's not fair."
"Can I see your work?"
Where did you sleep?"
Sherlock saw a little blush coming up at John's cheeks.
"No, Greg. Have you seen Sherlock?"
Three Continents Watson, kissed Sherlock
"You're going to be the death of me, aren't you?"
John turned around to leave, but the woman spoke again.
Why was he blushing? He didn't seem angry. Was it the fact that he had to start drawing again? Or was it something else? Was he blushing because Sherlock was going to be his study object? It was too dark to see John properly, so he had to study this reaction some other time. Very frustrating.
"Yes, I already injected it in a piece of tissue, but it's to early to see the results yet."
"Yes."
"Oi!"
"You kept dating." Sherlock said to John. John gave him an half smile, softly squeezing Sherlock's hand he was covering with his own.
Sherlock's phone vibrated on the coffee table, the screen lit up for a few seconds, and it went back dark again, a notification light flashing above the screen. If Sherlock got home before John did, he just hoped the man would listen to him for once in his life. John put on his coat, pushed his phone into his pocket and the gun between his waistband. He rushed out to get a cab that would take him to the nearest drug den at Govent Garden.
"You're quiet."
"Good. Let's have a feast tonight. Good wine, good food and good company."
Enjoy this chapter!
"You are telling him something else first, and you don't know how he is going to respond to that. If he responds reluctant, you will go and never tell him what happened. " Mycroft deduced.
The kind, nice doctor with his awful jumpers and caring eyes, the fierce army captain with his steady hand, killer instinct and steel like gaze, the hot and seductive man with the heated eyes and a reputation that gave him the nickname Three Continents Watson. And somehow it was all packed together in the same man. And now he could add the artist on that list. A man who could work with the different shades of his pencils, creating. It was extraordinary. He was extraordinary. Not something to lose easily without losing a part of himself.
"Other activities? Like what?"
"I should have done that sooner."
Scrotum: Severe pain, pain in the abdomen, swelling, fever; Testicular contusion, and possible rupture.
Energetically he stood up from the sofa, his blue dressing gown swinging dramatically around him, when he went towards the stairs to John's bedroom, barefooted as always.
John rolled his eyes.
"I told you I liked you. I normally don't like people, little devil."
"Correct."
"I've waited four years for this. Believe me, I'm ready."
“Of course not, john. Mycroft may have only sent you with me to keep an eye on me. But you know i work better with you on my side and there might be patients for you to treat. And you need to make a blog about it, don't you?”
"Is John coming today?"
"And, how is your work progressing?" He asked, feigning interest.
Mycroft walked into the small waiting room of the hospital at the intensive care unit. The tapping of his umbrella matching the pace of his footsteps. Detective Inspector Lestrade was sitting on one of the uncomfortable chairs. Mycroft walked across the further empty waiting room and took a seat next to the inspector. Greg looked up. His eyes were red, as if he had been crying. Had he? Or had he just worked too long? No. Definitely crying.
"Okay class! We are going to start with this pose. You all know how to start, I'll be walking around and give you a hand if needed. John, I'll be with you in a moment, so you can make a good first start."
This was wrong. Angels didn't swear, did they? He felt soft fingers stroking his hair. It felt nice, as long as he didn't touch his skin, it felt comfortable. He needed to open his eyes, he wanted to see the angel. He tried it again, just his eye's this time. And with a lot off effort, he managed to open them just a bit. It was light, very light, but after a few moments he could see the luminous angel, his face close, probably still sitting next to him on the ground.
"Let's not draw our conclusions yet."
But I never had been an coward.
"I apologise for the cold again. When you get to chilly, just say it. We can take a break then, so you can warm yourself up."
"Right..." He managed to get out. Focusing back on the novel at his lap and putting the mug with tea back in front of his face, hiding most of it.
John huffed out a short laugh.
David smirked at him and Sherlock laughed, a soft rumble out of his throat.
"How do you mean?"
"Because I know him and he told me. We go back a long time. Did he never tell you?"
"It was close."
"Her. And no. Not particularly."
At first John had thought he truly had lost his mind, that he finally had hit rock bottom and saw things that were not there. But when he realized that the man in front of him was real and alive, he had hit him. He had hit him hard, almost broke his nose, actually. And when he finally stopped shouting at him, calling him names and cursing him, he had cried. John had cried his heart out. And Sherlock had held him tight in his arms, letting John cry out all the pain and suffering he had felt that last year. Sherlock had brought him to bed, tucked him in, stroked his hair and stayed with him until he fell asleep, a single butterfly in his stomach gingerly coming back to life, and his heart had started beating again.
Sherlock's body shivered again. But the man stayed unconscious. Cleaning him up was all he could do without his medical kit. When he was finished, he knelt back beside Sherlock's chest, making sure that if Sherlock opened his eyes, he was the fist thing he would see. He stroked the soft dark curls again.
"Yes. When you were sleeping after your surgeries I thanked him for it."
"I am not worried about my own life, Dr. Watson. How's my brother?"
"You're a stubborn man, aren't you?"
"Any good?"
"I need you, you know." John told the passed out man in front of him.
When he complained about the dullness to John yesterday, the man had smirked at him and told him to make himself useful and do some work around the house. Cleaning, dusting, doing the dishes or even cook something. Sherlock had looked at his roommate as if he had suggested to murder someone. (That would be interesting, but impossible. He would probably be the one called in to investigate the crime he committed himself.) So, instead of telling John that, he just rolled his eyes and had replied.
"Hell yes. I'm going out with a bang and I'm taking everything to do with this virus with me. You press the button and then you have about ten minutes to tell everyone to get out."
He went to get his pack of cigarettes (which he had hidden for John, of course)  And lit one up. He stopped his pacing across the room and went to stand in front of the window, looking out at the almost empty street below him, pulling on his cigarette, enjoying the taste.
Sherlock strode towards his room.
They did talk about the case. They were able to pick up files from all the twelve students participating the course, thanks to Sherlock's skill of hacking the Yards network and that one (or two) from his brother. Although John had the slightest presumption that Mycroft let his little brother break in into his system, as long as the information he needed wasn't too confident or dangerous. But John kept his suspicions for himself, not wanting to get Sherlock into a tantrum while he was in the middle of a case. As far as John could tell, the man hadn't slept since Thursday, acting like the hurricane he was, making deductions and pacing across the room, clearing his mind by thinking out loud and talking to John. John tried to push him to get some rest, just to sleep for some hours, but Sherlock declined, as usual. They worked the case almost non-stop for four days now, giving John some respite of a four or five hours of sleep each night. And when they finally managed to rule out all the other students and came to some sort of conclusion, John collapsed into his bed on Monday evening.
We went on like that for more then two years. Him using, overdosing, disappearing, coming back again, using, getting clean, being the posh detective, building his homeless network with me, he even encouraged me to get clean. I did. Then he started using again, came back to live with me and I took care of him, until he overdosed again. The last time that happened, I called his brother as I did before, but I also called his detective friend from the police. This wasn't the life for him. He was too smart for this. He got me clean and I wished the same for him. They came to pick him up and I thought I would never see him again.
"Hmmm... I probably would have asked you to come and live with me and John."
"Thank you, John. There had been a study done there to investigate the brain cells and the way they work. They were working on a medicine to help comatose patients to recover sooner and with less brain damage. But somehow there was an mutation in the developed medicine. They were testing it on apes, but one of the laboratory technicians got bitten by the animal and showed some... disturbing effects on this bite."
The next page was an image of a heart. Sherlock could see where it had been cut to investigate before it went down on this piece of paper. When he turned the page he looked into the face of a younger (and skinnier) Mike Stamford. Sherlock smiled at the sight. Even though he didn't know the man back then, he knew the picture was very accurate. This sketchbook was full with drawings of body parts, muscles, bones, and portraits of his classmates and friends. This sketchbook was full until the end. As was the next, and the next. Sherlock looked down at the now empty box next to him and was a little disappointed that there were no other drawings left. With the last sketchbook still in his hands he thought about it. His thoughts went back to the last picture John seemed to have drawn. How was it possible to give a piece of paper so much emotion? How did John manage to put it on paper, to even make Sherlock get moved by it, just thinking about the loss in that last picture? It made him feel uncomfortable. And how could John have hidden this skill from him? It seemed like the man had drawn for the most part of his life, and quite good actually. But he had stopped after the saddest drawing of all. Sherlock stood up to search the rest of his room, looking for scribbles or pencils but he didn't find any. So John really didn't draw anymore. But why? It seemed like a favourite past time for a lot of people, and it would definitely beat the stupid novels he was reading now almost every night when they were at home and he wasn't working on his blog.
"I'll probably do."
John grinned.
When he was behind the shorter man, he softly leaned against him, unable to wrap him in his arms without falling over.
On the next page there wasn't a portrait, but scenery of a marked place, crowded with people. Sherlock could almost hear the loud voices of the sellers, feel the heat of the Afghan sun on his skin, and the dryness in his throat, caused by the dry desert wind that was displayed in the picture in front of him. The next one was a portrait of an elderly Afghan citizen. Deep lines of life in his face, a few scars and a darker hue of skin tone. The pair of eyes that were staring at him from the piece of paper were clear and full of wisdom. Impatiently he turned the page again, wanting to see more. He saw the face of a soldier. Tears welling up in the man's eyes. The face was shocked, deeply hurt, as if the man was mourning. From here on the drawings became darker, sadder. Pictures of soldiers crying fisted hands and tensed muscles, an empty marketplace. The next one was a portrait again. Sherlock recognised the face as that of the elderly citizen from before. Only now the eyes didn't speak wisdom anymore. The eyes stared at him from the paper, empty, lifeless. After that the sketchbook was empty. Page after page of clean white sheets. Sherlock felt a spike of pain. It felt wrong to end with this picture. After all the beauty the other pictures had shown, the last one only showed negativity, sadness, loss. He put the sketchbook beside him, reaching inside the box for the next one. This one was older. He opened it and saw on the first page an anatomical drawing of a dissected spine. Anatomical correct, of course. The added shadows made it pop up from the paper, giving it a lifelike touch. He made this during his study at Bart’s, then.
The cab ride home had been a challenge. John was staring out of the window, ignoring Sherlock completely, while Sherlock had the feeling he was going insane. He got what he wanted. He got the man back in his life, he enjoyed having him around, to talk to him, laugh with him. But it still wasn't enough. His body and mind wanted more, his heart wanted more. When he had heard John say those words, he would have given everything just to make them true. Just to know that it was real. He would give his life for it, happily, even. He would die as a complete man.
No need to tell him where he was going, Mycroft was probably following his every step anyway. If Sherlock was at Jenkins' house, John would call him and the Yard to come and arrest that piece of shit. Finally the cab stopped at the address John had given him. He threw a handful of notes to the man and hurried out, to jog the last street. He had been monitoring that address yesterday. (Just yesterday. It felt like days ago.) So he knew how to get to the back alley and he knew which porch was Jenkins'. John's heart rate was just a little elated, his breathing was steady. He was used to moments of stress. He was at his best when he had so much adrenaline and endorphin rushing through his body. His mind was clear, and his hearing sharp.
John looked up at Greg, the pain visible in his eyes.
Nita put only her head through the door, blocking John's view on purpose.
"Right now." Sherlock demanded then, his voice a lot surer now.
"Ow Jesus Christ, John... Please... more...Fucking hell..."
Sherlock and John left early that night, after Ava stated that they all needed a long night sleep.
"Do you still have your childhood drawings?"He asked.
"They gave me a remote. I can adjust the doses myself now."
"They shaved my balls. They didn't even do it properly."
"And the others?"
You had taken it with you those eleven months ago. The sounds of laughter, adrenalin and life. Gone was the sound of running footsteps across London, shouting to running suspects, the sound of our breathing heavily and the rush of blood pumping through our veins because of the chase. Gone was the throbbing of my heart against my ribs, the fluttering of the butterflies in my stomach.
John set the box down on top of the coffee table and started unwrapping it. The brown paper got of easily and when he opened the carton box his heart stuttered.
That was all there was.
I fell for you as a rock. Your beautiful brain, your quick deductions, your sense of humor, your hang for danger, I thought it was enchanting."
"Yes, you can, Sherlock."
John blinked his eyes, confusion in his face, which turned to anger in seconds.
"I'm sorry, Sherlock. But I really need to get some sleep."
"Stop calling me."
"Yeah, he told me that."
"You know..." Ava said before taking a bite of Thai.
"Ten years, four months, and eighteen days ago."
"Twelve fucking days. I got scratched by Daniel. That's when I called for help. And on the thirth day, you walked through that door."
Sherlock turned towards the screen on the desk, and saw the life stream from the microscope.
"No. Well, yes, but I... You know."
"Mind over matter, John. It's a mind set. You?"
"John? Do I need to call a doctor? Do you need some fresh air? John? Please, talk to me."
"What kind of disturbing effect's?"
Suddenly, David reached out with his hand over the bar to lay it on top of John's. His fingers stroking the top of his hand.
"Smug bastard." John muttered, getting even more blush on his cheeks and another laugh in return. Sherlock was looking at the works of the students.
"Good morning gorgeous."
"Are you going to tell him what happend while he was away?"
Sherlock turned towards the door of his dressing room and John finally managed to look away from him.
Ava grinned at him.
“Need your reassurance? That your still doing a good job?”
Sherlock sighed and hang his coat.
It was at least the ninth time John had asked Sherlock to sit model so he could finish his drawing of the back piece. And it was at least the second time that John really did manage to get some pencil stripes on to the paper before he just couldn't help himself and touch the gorgeous man in front of him. That arse really was fucking distracting.
"Yes. She's strapped in the back. She was the last one to turn before you showed up. No conversation skills, that one. She does moan a lot."
"Can I ask you something?"
"That was disgusting." Sherlock couldn't suppress a chuckle. Ava grinned at him.
"Be quick about it, Mycroft. I do have things to do."
"Did she." Sherlock started more than asked.
He watched. The house was dark, as was the atelier. It seemed as if the man wasn't home or was asleep. Probably the latter. If Sherlock was here, he was probably in the atelier. John hoped that he was. Breaking into the atelier seemed easier than breaking into the house.
Liar.
"It seems that it does, yes. That's a great break though. How long will it work?"
“So your going to be the chemist instead of the Detective this time?”
"Are you talking about yourself?"
"Hmpf... I'm getting an erection, and it bloody hurts."
"Yes! It's amazing, isn't it? It's the best result I've had since this mess started! I never managed to get it stable for more than four hours. And this one is stable for almost twenty two hours now."
"'Im who came back, o'course. Our man. Thought he didn't do that 'nymore."
Energetically he stood up from the sofa, his blue dressing gown swinging dramatically around him, when he went towards the stairs to John's bedroom, barefooted as always.
"As a matter of fact, yes. Tell me everything about your work on this until now."
"Liar."
"Ta, Greg."
"Sorry?"
"Jesus Christ! You are unbelievable! Stay, fucking, still!" He heard the stool scrape over the floor again, and he braced himself. The man started hitting him and kicking him again. He really lost his temper now. It was just cruel. It hurt like hell. The man kicked him on the chest again, and then on his shoulder. He felt his left shoulder dislocate and he screamed with pain. It earned him an kick in his face, letting his already swollen lower lip spit, bleeding heavily.
"Why?"
"I think he doesn't want us to see his work yet. Let's keep it between us that we did, alright?" She asked him, a little insecure smile playing her lips. Sherlock just nodded to her, not trusting his voice enough to agree and went for the door, leaving Esmeralda behind.
Ava laughed and Sherlock grinned back.
"Yes! You're the one who said that you weren't gay!"
"Of course. But I also want to bring you pleasure. I want to know what turns you on and what it will take to let you forget your own name."
"I will. If you change your mind and you're up for a pint, you'll know where to find me, yeah?"
"We didn't."
John lit it and inhaled.
"I'm heading towards the Yard now. Looking into some papers to see if I can find any unidentified body's fitting any of the victim’s descriptions."
The first time it happened he was standing on the roof of Saint Bart's. He had his phone in his hand and he could see the man standing on the street below him.
"Is he? So gorgeous and smart, then? Sounds like the man of my dreams." She smirked.
"You do?"
"How are you feeling?"
"There's no one here."
John looked at him, awaiting.
Ava closed her eyes again, her speaking went slower and she started to mumble.
"Shut the fuck up, Bern! Ye don't know what yer talkin' 'bout. Why you need 'm for, honey? Have a mystery to solve?"
"We are not going inside the facility."
The students stretched themselves and went out to the cafeteria or outside to smoke. Just like Tuesday, Sherlock first went to the back to put on his jumper and jacket, and he saw that John and the other students had already left the classroom when he reappeared. Only Esmeralda was still in the room, standing behind John's desk again, looking down at the sketch. Without looking up she signed Sherlock to come closer and have a look.
"Bye, Sherlock."
Thanks you all for reading and for the kind words!!! You all make the writing worthwhile!
"You want one?"
"Yes. Network business. Have you seen Him?"
The man named Ru pulled up his shoulders and John's heart sank in his shoes. They had been running around London all night, and still no trace of Sherlock.
"Research. I have access to the patients. I have equipment here, I can take samples and study them. I'm in the middle of testing a new serum, to see if I can slow down the process."
Yin and Yang.
Tears welled up in Ava's eyes, looking at the man on the other side of the glass.
Sherlock studied him. The skin was in a state of disintegration, the teeth black, eyes white, and he was scraping his half hands across the glass, trying to get to Sherlock. It was a horrific, monstrous sight. And Sherlock felt a spike of fear. If the virus got out it would be a disaster. He had done his research. There wasn't anything like this in the world, and out of curiosity he had seen some episodes of different television series and some movies. Most of them were complete nonsense, but there was one series that had established an sort of realistic view of what would happen to the world when something like that really happened. And it wasn't something to look out for. The man in front of him suddenly pressed himself harder to the glass, screaming. Sherlock could see Ava behind him with ano empty syringe in her hand. Clive turned around and swung an arm at her. Ava let herself fall back, but the remaining fingernails scratched her cheek. Clive took two steps towards her, and fell down.
John giggled at that.
Sherlock lasted for more than two hours now. Letting everybody take their time to sketch, paint and draw. And it was because of Esmeralda that they stopped the lesson of this evening. The first thing Sherlock did was pull up his boxers (thank god) And he reached for his dressing gown before standing up and turn around towards John. When he saw the sweater he was wearing he frowned. John shrugged and looked as innocent as he could, getting an eye roll from the man in front of him that made him smile.
John tried to look impressed, but couldn't care less about the man's new MPV. John would be happy when they could return to their work. Even looking at Sherlock's way to attractive torso and hiding his blush was better than entertaining himself with this man. The man was bloody boring.
"Yes. But you made it in time, John. Don't worry about it."
Sherlock got a smirk on his face, which he tried to hide as soon as it appeared.
"You're going to trick my brother?"
"But John! I'm on a case! Digesting slows me down. And I need to think clear."
Battered, demolished, broken.
"So, here we are."
"I have to disagree with you, brother mine. In this case, Dr. Watson may be right."
"We will?"
"Shit."
"Ready?"
But the curiosity won. If he was careful, John would never know that he had found this box with treasures.
Happy reading!
The man's sock index was nonexistence. How could he live like this? The rest of John's bedroom was army tidy, as usual, but the drawer with socks was like a crime scene. (At best a four, but still.) There were loose socks, socks turned inside out, a few bundles of a pair, which had to be separated to be certain that they were a matching pair, obviously, and he even found a sock with a hole in it. It was a right mess. John's life would be a lot more easier when Sherlock was done here. He sat down in front of the cabinet, his long legs crossed in front of him, and he took out all the socks, making the drawer empty, and started to search out pairs. He threw the sock with the hole in it over his shoulder, and added another one with a hideous pattern on it. (Really John? Grey with blue stripes?)
Requires closed reduction, rest.
Maybe you changed your job and became a trauma surgeon again, doing what you do best. Working under stress, fixing people up, saving lives. The tremor in your hand is under control, so you could do that again, you know.
"It seems like the infected cells are starting to feed themselves on the healthy ones again." Sherlock said, looking at the stream from the microscope.
"Hold still. I can't work when you are moving."
Send.
"Not a studio for your drawing?"
John walked towards the door, stopping behind Sherlock, putting his hand on the man's shoulder. After a few seconds, Sherlock put his own hand on top of it, squeezing it shortly, before letting go. Without a word, John left.
He heared himself moan and beg the man to stop, pleading for some kind of mercy, hating himself for it, but he couldn't help himself. He never begged. When Marc walked around him and hit him again, he managed to curl up just a bit more. When the man kicked against his dislocated knee, the world finally went black again.
"Hmmm... Good answer. I might have fallen in love with you too, gorgeous."
"That wasn't nice, Sherlock." John looked disproving. But Sherlock didn't care.
John was jogging over the pavement. Adrenalin pushing in his veins.
That was awkward. If anyone had seen that, they would definitely talk.
"You didn't know he was using, did ya?" The woman asked him, her voice caring.
Sherlock laughed out loud.
And I wished I could come back to you, and that I could find the courage to tell you how I really feel, despite the consequences. I know now how life feels without you, and it's not pleasant. I rather not have known this. If I had managed to come back home, I would have done everything to keep you in my life, even if that meant I have to accept the probably dull woman you decided to spent the rest of your life with. It's all good, as long as you're in my life.
John felt the blood rushing to his cheeks. One of the butterflies in his stomach panicked. No way he was going to sit and watch the detective undressed, only covered with a sheet and his gorgeous arse showing, sitting on the sofa, or worse, in the bedroom. That was way to intimate. Only the thought of that picture already was turning him on. Definitely not going to happen.
The group walked behind her. John was walking next to David Wolf, talking and laughing. Sherlock was right behind them, walking with the much more reserved Liam Murphy, who was talking in a soft voice about the closing art shop in the centre of town.
Sherlock never was one of the popular blokes, quite the opposite. Hiding away in the library, the laboratory or his dorm room, shutting everybody out and minding his own business. Where John's heart had been too big, Sherlock's mind had been. Unable to shut it down, caressing it, but hating it at the same time. Just as John he was self destructive. John had been unable to turn his heart off, too care less for the people around him, and it almost killed him. Sherlock had tried to shut his mind down, finding relief with his drug use (or abuse, if you believed his brother) but it nearly took his life on several occasions. And he felt like it didn't matter at that time. If that was what it took to shut it off, then he had to take it. But just like John's mind had overruled his heart on occasion, telling himself that he could go on, that there must be something to live for after all, the same thing had happened to him. The heart had told his mind to try and get clean, to use his abilities for the good, and so he tried several times.
"I dreamt you jumped again. And you were dead."
"Christ. You're both idiots."
Mycroft twisted his lips into something that looked like a grin.
"Goodbye, little devil."
When he tightened his muscles he whimpered, causing a laugh from the man behind him.
John chuckled.
"God... What did he do to you?" John mumbled, putting his jacket back over Sherlock's chest. Softly he touched his forehead with the back of his hand. Sherlock whimpered.
"And she told you to be happy."
I almost acted on it, a number of times. You remember that time in the hallway? You were so close and I could only see your perfect lips moving. I could hardly contain myself from taking those lips with my own, covering them, tasting them. To show you how much you mean to me. Or those times you were sitting in your chair, freshly from the shower, your hair damp and the morning paper in your hands? I had to hold myself from getting my fingers through that damp hair, to get that night gown off of you, always a bit disappointed that you weren't wearing mine. All those times I stood over your shoulder looking at the screen of your laptop, reading your blog or to see what you found when I asked you to search something for me. Those times I was so close to you, I could smell you. Remember that time we were handcuffed together? That's my favourite. That moment I acted. It wasn't much, but I was so happy just to hold your hand. I can still feel your fingers against my palm. I will cherish that moment for the rest of my life, how long that even will be.
They didn't talk about the drawings again. When Sherlock got into the living room the next morning the sketchbook was gone. John was acting normal again; the emotions of Thursday night seemed to be buried away somewhere. Sherlock was thankful for this turn of the events. He had no idea how to handle a situation like that. And neither did John apparently. So they both just acted like it never happened.
"Yes, John. That would be lovely. I'll just get something on me and I'll join you in the cafeteria, alright?"
"How are you feeling?"
"Bummer."
"No. I had to kill of one of the monkeys. They were starting to eat each other. Making a disgusting mess and a lot of noise. So. One monkey and three humans left. God. I could use a cigarette right now."
Happy reading!
John turned around an went looking for two chairs. Sherlock frowned. Typical. He never seems to argue with orders from attractive woman. Sentiment? Hormones?
"She told me to be happy with you. And I am."
The only man who had ever seen so much of him, the only man who had made him feel so much. And now he had to deceive him too keep him alive. He had to hurt him. And it had made his heart bleed.
Sherlock leaned back against him, John's hands going towards his front now, fingers going towards his nipples. John saw goosebumps coming up at his touch and he bent his fingers a bit more, using his nails to scratch that pale skin.
"He... he never told me. That bloody moron never said anything to me. O god. That stupid cock! Jesus. O, Jesus Christ."
"We're still working on a medicine. Don't give up yet."
"Yeah... working. Or dating dull woman."
"Hey, Gerald." David greeted him. Sherlock nodded towards him and went to stand next to him, the dark blonde woman (Cindy? Christy? Chloe?) at his other side.
"Christ! Don't you sleep? This must have taken you all night."
"You know where to find him?"
Sherlock laughed a deep rumble.
"He did. He smiled about it when he told me."
“Good evening.”  John greeted him.
He had to repair his broken shield. He had to try and glue the pieces back together, become the man he had been all those years before his fall, before he met John. Even if it meant that he never could be himself to the fullest.
"Have you seen Him?"
"Have to keep in my role, John. And it's to big for you anyway. How was it?"
"Ten years, four months, and eighteen days ago."
They kissed again. Just as soft and careful as the first time. And when John pulled back, he wrapped his arms tighter around Sherlock. It felt as if he never wanted to let him go again. And that was exactly what Sherlock wanted.
"Look, they got me off the monitor's and painkillers."
John grinned, putting the glass against his lips again. He seemed to be in a good mood, and Sherlock felt that he could push it a bit, finding answers.
"Yes, I'm here Sherlock. I'm here."
John looked around.
"Are there infected subjects with you?" Sherlock asked.
"God sorry. That came out wrong. You're not my type. You're the type that's demanding in bed, wants to be pleased. And I'm the same. Wouldn't work. That's it."
"Ava..."
"Yeah, well, thanks."
"Wait. Try the connection on your phone. So I can look with you."
"Hey John. I heard what happened. Are you alright? you didn't burn yourself, did you?"
“Show-off. Just let's head home and get ready for tonight. I know you; you'll need at least an hour to get yourself ready."
"Thank you, pretty. Now, do you have any more of those cookies?"
Sherlock bumped against his shoulder to let him know that he was ready to leave, and together they walked towards the exit. Sherlock was talking to him, but John didn't listen. His mind was too occupied with the feeling of creating something again. He couldn't wait until it was Thursday, the fact that they were here   working a case for a moment forgotten.
"I would have fallen in love with you, you know that?" He said.
Of course. He should have known that the angel would look like John.
"I rather do not."
"I want to apologise for my behavior. I got caught in the moment. I am sorry for what I did and I understand that your going to get your things and move out the apartment before I am released. But I really have to say that I am a bit disappointed by the fact that you chose to start this conversation while I am bound in a hospital bed, unable to move around or to get away, just so you can get this over with without me giving a tantrum, which I obviously wasn't going too, because I was waiting for this moment to happen. My apologies again, I shouldn't have done that. I made a mistake, and I can assure you that it won't happen again. But I'll make sure Mycroft will help you to get another place to stay within a maximum of ten miles radius from your office, affordable. Please, don't feel obligated to stay here and watch over me, there are a dozen of nurses who can take care of that. And if you don't mind, I would rather be left alone right now."
They looked each other in the eyes. John's face flushed red, Sherlock as steady as usual.
"Good night, Sherlock."
"Partly. And because of your investigation in my previous models. How did you think you could keep yourself anonymous, mister Holmes? Did you really think people wouldn't figure it out?"
"What the hell are you wearing?!" He asked softly, the joy very visible in his eyes. It annoyed Sherlock tremendously.
"How do you know that?"
Ignoring the bruising's on the skin in front of him, John lifted the jacket from Sherlock's body to look for other severe injuries that needed medical care as soon as possible.
"Sherlock!"
"Mycroft, I need your help. Have you seen Sherlock?"
"Mister Holmes! What do you think of me? I'm an artist. And I an definitely not some queer. You should do your homework better. Now. Let's work on the front, shall we?"
"No, Sherlock. Don't give it hope. The odds are against us. I'm turning in some brain dead flesh eating thing and I can't stop it."
Two other paramedics arrived with a stretcher and the man John talked with gave Sherlock an IV. Sherlock began to spasm again. Moaning, trying to get away.
"Better than you, apparently." He answered, biting his words.
Sherlock looked up and could just see her putting down her mug with coffee.
Lower back: Persistent pain lower back and on top of the buttocks area, swelling at the base of spine; Bruised tailbone.
Ava pushed the seat back and stood up.
Sherlock slammed the door of the pub behind him and turned right. With big steps he strode through the street, taking the first to the right, making sure he wasn't in sight anymore.
“God help us. And what did you have in mind for me? Or am i just going to be a bystander?”
"I don't understand."
"Your hands are small."
"Yes, of course."
"But you said you had a plan. What about that?"
"And where can I find this Nita?"
"I heard the others say that Esmeralda was very impressed with your work. Even though you wouldn't show it to anyone else." He said nonchalant, putting the cap back on the bottle and set it down beside him.
"Ginger nuts! John, you're a mind reader."
But Sherlock's panic had taken over. He turned around and hurried himself out.
"It would be weird to draw in here."
He got out on Blenheim Grove, looking around for the drug den Angie had told him about. This wasn't the best place in London to wander on your own, and John was glad he had his gun on him. He saw some crackheads going into a building on his left, and he decided to follow them inside.
Mycroft smiled.
John huffed and rolled his eyes. Good thing he brought a book, then.
Sherlock was explaining why those men were the primary suspects, but John yawned again and put his empty cup down.
They entered the building and crossed the hall to walk to the only classroom where there was light coming from. When they entered the room they saw that everyone else already was sitting down behind their desks and easels, wearing thick sweatshirts and jumpers. Some of them even wore scarfs. The woman who stood in front of the group strode forwards to them, a kind smile on her face.
"I used to draw almost every day, for years. I learned that it eased my mind, but then... Something happened. And I made a choice."
"Did you try it on one of the subjects?"
"I promise." He said instead.
He started hitting him again. Hard, fast, and over and over on the same places. When Marc hit his testicles again, Sherlock cried out, wishing he would black out again. The man was ruthless. He whipped and slashed his body with the piece of leather, and when he hit him with it in the face, he finally passed out again.
"I... I'm not used to this kind of feelings."
"Stop it. You need to think realistic. You know there is no other way. I'm going to do it tonight."
"Damned. This is it. It feels very final."
"I'm going to kill him. I'm going to fucking kill that arsehole." John muttered under his breath. Looking at Sherlock's face. He felt anger rise up and hoped that the man would walk in through that door this instant. He would kill that man with his bare hands. Despite his angry words his hand carefully stroked Sherlock's hair. The soft curls whirling them self's around his fingers.
"Sure, no problem mate. Is something wrong?"
"Yes. Normally I'm going to another place, but some friends of mine wanted to meet here. Unfortunately, they called it off while I was already on my way. So I thought it would be nice to stay for a pint or two before Gerald arrives."
"I'm going to take a quick shower and dress myself for tonight. We have to be there a bit earlier this time, so we can talk to the students before we begin."
"John." Sherlock whined.
"You do?"
"It's true. You know it as well as I do. There is no antidote. I can feel my body giving up, I have moments I can't think properly."
He was too late.
"Don't they? What about John?" Ava said while lighting a cigarette. Sherlock ignored her.
"O no. I'm not gay."
It was the third time he cried in all of his adult life. And it was the third time he cried because of John Watson.
But John's heart had turned out too big for him to handle. And it almost destroyed him. He had come back from the war empty. Nothing to return to, nothing to look forward to, nothing to keep his big heart satisfied. John was diagnosed PTSD, was depressed, had a psychosomatic limp, a tremor in his dominant hand, and was looking for a way out. Sherlock suspected that he had considered taking his own life, and if his old roommate hadn't bumped into him in the park, he might even had done it. Thank god for Mike Stamford.
Yeah! Thank you all for the great feedback and kudos! Love it!!
"Will you live a happy life for me?"
Sitting still like this was harder than expected due to the cold in the room. Sherlock blocked out all the other students looking at him and concentrated only on John. He could stay still for hours looking at him. Normally he didn't get a chance to do it when John was awake. He always seemed to feel Sherlock's eyes boring at him, making the detective to look away. Almost always too late, but John didn't seemed to mind it.
"Yes."
"I'm just not! Can't change what I am, can I? Don't look at me like that. You are my exception."
Package? What package? He took a bite of his toast while standing up to check the desk in the living room. There was indeed a package. It looked like it was a carton box wrapped up in a dark brown paper. Curiously John picked it up and brought it with him to the sofa. He sat down and turned the package in his hands. Sherlock said it was for him, so he should be able to open in without being scared that it would explode or have some extremely contaminated experimental tubes inside. But still, it was Sherlock, so who knew?
That left David Wolf and Marc Jenkins. His heart jumped at this step forward. Only a week in, and they already narrowed it down to two possible suspects. He lifted his head to share his deduction with his friend, but John was staring in the flames. The glass of whiskey in his hand, his face relaxed and his thoughts far away. Sherlock's lifted the corner of his mouth and put the papers on the table next to him, just to pick up the glass and take a sip. He let the liquid roll over his tongue and closed his eyes. He swallowed it down, enjoying the feeling the alcohol left in his throat.
Of the twelve students there were already five that got off the hook. At first sight, they weren't taking the course long enough to have anything to do with it. The rest needed more research, but there were three people that had their priority; David Wolf, the young man outside who gave Sherlock a cigarette, Marc Jenkins, the middle aged man that held himself absent from the rest of the class, and Liam Murphy, who was sitting at the desk next to John.
I pulled the trigger, and someone had taken my bullets out."
They made it on time to the art school this time, and they split up as soon as they were entering the cafeteria, talking to different people, their main focus on the three primary suspects, until Esmeralda came to ask them to follow her to the classroom.
"Disappeared? Really? How?"
"Yes. But I don't see what that has to do with it."
"If you don't count the infected, yes. Pretty dull. They don't make good conversation. Some of them make noises, but most of them are just quiet."
"What?"
"Can you hold this pose for a while?" Esmeralda asked him.
The voice was soft, sweet, filled with love.
"You're stubborn, aren't you?"
I put the barrel of my gun against my temple, and the smile never left my face.
Shaking his head he dried himself, and then he tried to wash the coffee stains out of his jumper. When David returned with the sweatshirt, John already stopped trying to rescue his jumper. It really was a lost cause. Instead, he threw it down the bin and thankfully accepted the piece of clothing David handed him.
Ava chuckled with him.
"The things I'll do to you..." John said sleepy.
"John."
John's mind was racing. He needed to know what the man's motives were, to find out if he had an alibi, or even more extreme, get a confession. Best to go along with it, then.
The unidentifiable colour of his eyes were drenched with blood, but John was so happy to see that Sherlock somehow gave a sign of consciousness.
"I'll just check in the morning if he's still dead. Coming back to you now."
"And you say that I am slow." John said, softly laughing, rolling his eyes. The anger on his face was gone.
"I am so sorry. I am sorry for what I did to you. I had no idea."
"They will remove the splint tomorrow, giving me a brace."
He heard Marc say.
"Is he in trouble?"
"Good night, Ava."
At that moment the door opened again, letting in two paramedics who knelled down next to Sherlock and immediately started their work. John started to explain what he already had found out about Sherlock's condition. When he mentioned the ruptured testicle's and the dislocated knee, Greg turned white as a sheet. The paramedic listened to him while working, and nodded.
"Thank you for your help, sir. We will get him to the hospital as soon as possible."
"Exactly. Open the exel-sheet on the desktop of computer seven six eight. You can see the results there."
When I got home I opened the bottle of whiskey, sat down on my sofa, and drank the excellent liquor, feeling it warming my throat and chest, in a way it hadn't been warmth in almost a year. I even allowed myself to listen to the sounds that you had taken with you. I allowed myself to cry over them. I imagined the music coming from that violin in your hands, the sound of your deep rumbling voice, the sound of your laugh and even the sound of the sparse giggles I got out of you. I loved you. I loved you more than I had ever loved anything or anyone in my whole life. And I needed you. Without you it just wasn't worth it. I put the half empty bottle of whiskey aside, and went into my bedroom. I sat at the bedside and opened the drawer.
"John?" Sherlock said with a small and insecure voice. John looked in those beautiful colour shifting eyes of him.
Sherlock frowned.
"Have you drawn anything since the case?"
"Well, Ava. Be careful what you wish for. He'll be everything you ever wanted, and more, probably."
At this moment I am lying in an abandoned alley, hidden away in the shadows, hoping they won't find me and torture me and keep me alive just to mess with my mind and trying to figure out who I'm working for. They don't know who I am, but somehow they figured out that I'm not who I said I was. They held me for two days, but I managed to escape. But they did instigate some damage to my transport. Not to severe, but still enough to distract me and slow me down. My body is shaking, there is a nasty cut on the back of my head that doesn't stop bleeding, and I'm very thirsty. I haven't had anything to drink for almost thirty-eight hours. And it's hot here. I notice that I have difficulty focusing my thoughts. I think I will not survive this one. I am crying. I am crying, not because of the pain they gave me or the ending of this all, I am crying because I will not see you again.
"Ehm. Yes. They had too to preform surgery. "
"No."
Sherlock barked out a laugh.
He heard the deep baritone voice at the other end of the line chuckle. John couldn't help but smile at the sound, secretly wishing he heard it more often.
Sherlock wasn't here, and she told him that it was a very small chance that he was shooting up somewhere in an abandoned alley. He sighed.
"I'm having a week off. So technically tonight it's the start of my weekend."
But other words came out of his mouth.
A pause.
Did he just say that he loved him? John? No. This wasn't happening. This wasn't real. It was all an act. A cover they had made so they could investigate this case. This was not real.
He sat his roommate down and almost forced him to eat some dinner.
"I'll miss you too. But who knows. Maybe we'll meet in another life."
"There was a fire. I've been wandering in the smoke." Sherlock said when he noticed John's stare. He pulled his coat off and dropped it in the nearest chair.
The second time was during his absence. He was convinced he was going to die. He was severely dehydrated, bleeding from a nasty head wound and almost starved to death. And although it was about eighty degrees in the shade where he was hiding, his skin felt ice cold. He was going to die, and the only thing he could think of, was that he would never see him again. He had missed him so much, and now that he was almost finished, almost ready to go back to London again, he would never go home to him. It was all he wanted, it was what had driven him, kept him going and kept him sane. To just go home and see him again. It was selfish to think like this, to see John as something he had earned, and it was stupid to cry over it, definitely because he already was dehydrated.
"Two of them were useless, but it seems that we managed to make something that shuts them off for a few hours."
"Well, once, but that was said by a psychopath who was trying to make me kill myself. Most people can't stand me, actually."
John let out a soft giggle.
"Let's get you still long enough so I can finish my piece."
David came up to him and gave him a firm slap on the shoulder.
"Ah. Having one of his tantrums again?"
John lifted an eyebrow.
"I haven't told you everything yet. I'm sorry. I never thought it would be relevant."
"I'd like to keep an eye on you in case your planning in setting things on fire or blowing stuff up again."
John ended the call before Mycroft could respond.
"I suppose you're right."
"How long?" He asked her.
"I lied."
"You'll let me know when he's safe, will you?" She said after him.
A pause. A diary? Did he see it like that? And he was lying again. He showed some of his work to Sherlock. Did John gave him a look inside his diary?
"I think..." John sighed.
John looked up to him. His eyebrows lifted high in a questioning gesture.
"Sherlock..."
But I am alone. I am severely dehydrated. It makes me mentally confused, and I have the feeling that I will go into shock any moment. I'm still crying. Hard sobs now, tears running down. I am surprised that there is even enough fluid in my body left to cry. It's selfish, crying over you. But you know me, I am a selfish man after all. You would forgive me for it, won't you?
"Yes?"
Finally they start talking to each other!  Well, sort of...
"I... Ehm... This one ends in 2003, I think. It was one of my sketchbooks that I used in medical school."
"From you? Always."
"I'll guess I see you tomorrow?" Sherlock asked while putting on his coat.
Thank god! Our two favorite idiots are finally being honest towards each other. JohnLock happened!
"I know you will. Please, doctor Watson, try and save my brother's life."
"Better than yesterday. Probably worse than tomorrow."
Sherlock did as she said.
"With the sedative?"
"Well, he never showed up again after six nights of sitting model. Great man, good model and a great artist himself. And he is not the only one. There were others before him. They all suddenly stopped coming. There was one that send an apology, telling us that he had to go out of the country for his work, but the others just stopped coming. To bad actually. All of them were nice and good artists themselves. You don't paint or draw, do you?"
"You're the one who suggested that I got rid of the sheet." Sherlock replied teasingly.
"I believe it will last for at least eight hours. Did you give the dose that you filled in here?" He asked when Ava entered the room again.
"Sherlock?" John asked when he heard the door of the room opening.
Thoughtless John had already started to draw a raster on the paper in front of him. And finished it, by the looks of it. He steadied himself again and started to look at the shadows and highlights of the man's back in front of him. He could see the muscles. Sherlock's frame was lanky, but even with the horrible diet he had, running around London chasing criminals had done his work on that body. He was a bit too thin.
"How's your fever?"
"Sherlock." He started. Sherlock could see John brace himself a bit.
This was not good. He was hit on his chest again, and on his thighs, abdomen, head, face. Sherlock tried to curl himself up, to protect his body, causing his body to tremble and shiver uncontrollably. He didn't manage to pull his legs up, and his dislocated shoulder made it impossible to cover his head with his arms. He felt the hits with the leather strap and the kicking of the man's boots hitting the back of his legs, bum and back.
"Definitely. Ask him to bring some Thai, and a bottle of red wine, Malbec, if he can find it . Ow! And some Ginger nuts."
"So, Ava is there alone at this moment, she did run several tests that I think where pretty clever. I won't bore you with all the details about them, you wouldn't understand them anyway. She even managed getting samples of infected brain-tissue from one of the subjects. She locked them up in a cage normally used for the bigger apes."
Sherlock smirked and John rolled his eyes.
"I need to sleep." She stated.
"I like him." She said with a small slur in her voice.
Now he could hear Sherlock chuckle.
"We conformed yesterday that it has to be injected into the bloodstream, yes?"
Beth screamed and moaned and she tried to get closer to Ava, only to be retained by the cuffs she was in.
"You are a beautiful human being. You know that, right?"
"And because I can't have to much going on down there for the first weeks to come, I need to keep myself occupied with other activities."
I am not a romantic man. Passionate, yes. Passionate about the things I really care about. And that's not just my Mindpalace, my experiments and The Work, but that includes you. I am passionate about you. The way you look, the way you act and the way you think. The way you took me into your heart, seeing things in me nobody else ever saw. I am passionate about the feelings you awoken inside me even though they were frightening at first. But I'm passionate about them now. The warmth and comfort it brought me. And I hope I managed to give you the same.
I never believed the things you said to me on that phone call. You weren't a fake. You never googled me when we've met, you'd never set those cases up just to impress me. It was you for god sake! You were a bloody marvel, a whirlwind, a mad scientist and a genius. A beautiful creature that had held my heart his your hands without even knowing it. And you didn't let go when you took that step over the edge. You took my heart with you; over the edge, falling down, crushing at the ground. It was gone, just like you. Gone. Completely gone. And the thought of your absence was just to much to bare for my heart.
"Leave it."
I woke up in a military hospital miles away three days later. The whole village had been destroyed, as was most of our camp and our hospital. I managed to get in touch with my sister a day after that. She was drunk, called me names and told me that it was unforgivable that I managed to miss my parents funeral, for what reason whatsoever. She said she hated me, that she never wanted to see me again, and angrily she hang up the phone.
John almost chocked in his coffee.
"Yes."
"I know."
"Sherlock?" John tried again, against better knowledge.
Sherlock watched the black screen in front of him for a few seconds, before clicking it down, and conducted himself back into the sheets with statistics.
"Yes. But probably not so intense as him. You can almost feel it looking at your work. You can see the admiration. If your drawing's are your diary, then this is an ode. A tribute to your heart, to the fact that you can love someone like that. And that's something you should be proud of."
John inhaled deeply and gave Sherlock a smaller smile this time.
"As if I don't know that already. Try to go to sleep. I better head back to Bakerstreet."
"You need to call your brother."
"Jesus..."
"Listen and try to hear the things he doesn't say to you, Then you'll understand what I mean." She explained. with a small smile on her face.
"He's a private man. And I think he's a bit insecure about his work. It has been a long time since he held a pencil."
Ava stood up and stroke her fingers across her cheek.
"You stupid man. You'll never learn, will you?"
"I'm not gay."
"Why not?"
"How could we not?" Sherlock said. John squeezed his eyes.
"Yes sir." Donovan disappeared again, but not before she had her eyes gaze over Sherlock.
"The dream."
I thought it was a stupid thing to say. Be patient, wait till death come's for you, instead of finding death yourself? Two weeks later you were standing in front of me, and it became clear to me why he had done it."
After several minute, he asked:
John gave her a half smile.
He asked, his voice soft. Ava put another cookie in her mouth and poured it down with a big gulp of wine.
Sherlock was quiet. John gave him time to process everything he just said to him. He looked at him, laying there in that hospital bed with all the tubes and wires on him, the coloured bruising's on his face, the splint leg sticking out from under the sheets. And decided that he was still bloody gorgeous.
John didn't think anymore, he just reacted on that possessive heated gaze in Sherlock's eyes and actions. He put his right hand on Sherlock's arse, pulling that body even closer against his own, and his left hand went up to the back of Sherlock's head, his fingers gripping in his soft, dark curls, pulling him further down.
"I told you to hold still for me. But apparently you didn't had enough."
O god. Why did he say that?
"Did somebody ever tell you that you are too clever for your own good?"
"Are you sure?" He asked Sherlock tenderly, his hand going down and cupping Sherlock's cheek. Sherlock brought his own hand up and lied it on top of John's.
John shook up, looking around him, as if he couldn't remember where he was.
"Nope. Not since last week."
"Any news on my brother?"
John smiled back, putting down the two cups of tea he had just brought in.
"You are planning to burn it down?!" Sherlock asked her unbelievably. The grin on her face only got bigger.
"No."
"It's still deathly."
"I'm going to kill that son of a bitch!" John hissed between his teeth, still looking at the demolished body in front of him.
"It's your own fault. If you weren't that fucking hot all the time, I would be able to control myself." John said.
"That man is blind."
But maybe it is for the best that I can't return to you. Although I seemed to make you happy, I also caused you so much pain. You seemed to worry yourself about me constantly. You were injured more times than I would have ever wanted you to. You even almost died because of me, more than once. I inflicted you pain and suffering, while all I wanted to do is to keep you safe and happy. But I failed you. When I imagine the look on your face when I spoke to you the last time, my heart breaks for you. That phone call was one of the hardest things I've ever done in my entire life. That was the first time I cried. I never wanted to hurt you, deceive you or make you part of all of this, but I did. I try not to think about that and to hold on onto the thought that you are happy now.
"John? Am I dead?"
The butterflies seemed to have escaped his stomach, whirling around in his whole body now.
"To be honest. No, John. I don't understand. But... I want to. Can you explain it to me?"
"Okay. My first thought is that you have had woman in your bed from all three continents.
"It itches."
"Have you taken the serum?"
Sherlock was still up. His mind too busy to rest yet. He could feel his transport asking for some respite, but he needed to organize his head first. He was pacing across the room, thoughts were spinning through his mind, sucking up every bit of information around him, making deductions on his own.
The tense came back in the shorter man's shoulders, and Sherlock wished he hadn't asked John about the drawing.
John smirked.
"Really?"
John tried to calm himself down, to brace himself. This wasn't the time for some mental breakdown. He tried to focus himself on checking Sherlock's vitals without touching him, setting himself to work. Sherlock's breathing was too shallow, probably bruised or broken ribs.
Sherlock smiled at the sight of the woman appearing in sight.
"And I bought the wine you asked."
"I told you to stay still." The man said. Sherlock tried to look up at him, but his vision was blurry.
"What a difference it would have been if we met somewhere in London. I don't know, like bumping into each other in the streets." She continued, inhaling from her cigarette.
Inside, he pulled the jumper and shirt over his head and wetted a towel that hang next to one of the mirrors. He pushed the cold towel against his heated chest, cooling it. He looked at his chest in the mirror to see to his relief that his skin wasn't burned. When he looked down at his jumper in the sink in front of him, he sighed. The jumper was soaking wet, as was the shirt he had worn underneath. That one was ruined. What was he going to wear now? He couldn't walk around half naked. He should steal his jumper back from Sherlock. He could wear his robe underneath his jacket. The man went outside in nothing get but a sheet, so that wouldn't be a problem.
