. He’s panting, sweat making Steve’s hands slip on his thighs, but he doesn’t care; nothing else matters but this, but
Tony’s body pulls taut, buzzing like a live-wire before the tip is even inside him. He can’t even make one of his noises for Steve, he’s so overwhelmed. The stretch is unreal, pushing him out and open like he’s never been before, further, wider, big, bigger, stretching,
Somehow Steve doubts that. He doesn’t say so, because that way lies bickering, which is not what he came up here for. (
Steve pauses his ministrations with his hands on either of Tony’s hips. The gentling motions, contrasted with the too-fleeting smacks from earlier, are starting to make Tony’s head spin. When he feels Steve move over him again, the feeling deepens; the man is so large, so hot, so
He keeps babbling nonsense words of praise as they both come down, desperately breathing each other’s air in deep gulps, smiles spreading until they’re giggling and kissing nothing but teeth. For a while they do just that, stroking faces and lips with nerveless fingers, kissing between shuddering gasps; the air is humid and smells like sweat and come, Tony is still being held up against the door, and Steve’s jacket is fully off. They’re messy and ridiculous and
at this point. He just nods against the drool-dampened spot on the mattress by his head and squeezes around Steve again, not even meaning too, his nerve endings sparking and reacting all by themselves. “A-ah, Tony,
He doesn’t realize Tony’s been talking the whole time until he sits down on the bench at the foot of Tony’s bed and manages to take a breath. Tony is pacing in front of him, still dressed for the office, only his patterned tie loosened slightly around his neck. Steve watches him for a moment, listens, distracted from his existential crisis by the line of Tony’s jaw, perfectly shaven but nonetheless softened slightly by age, and the excitable, mile-a-minute way he talks when he realizes Steve’s not about to interrupt him. Steve is mesmerized by his hands, always, but especially when they’re like this—animated, practically dancing in mid-air while Tony talks. Steve spent so much of his life imagining death, wishing for it, chasing it, always living in its shadow; by contrast, Tony is life itself, chaotic and beautiful in all of its bright, flawed perfection, and just watching him move and talk could chase away any memory Steve has of darkness.
The air around and between them is charged—Tony can feel every hair on his arms standing on end. He can’t look away, held rapt by Steve’s hands on his body and Steve’s eyes on his mouth. Tony doesn’t know what the right thing is to say here, but he has to say
if I wanted us to continue what we started in the kitchen that night.” Tony bites his lip and swallows past the ball of nerves lodged in his throat. “And I wanted to take you up on your offer.”
Tony might actually die like this, pinioned on Steve’s cock, gasping for breath against the man’s hungry mouth, being pet like a wild horse that needs gentling, but what a way to go.
Seconds away from getting what he’s always wanted, Tony stops Steve with a hand to the chest. Ever the gentleman, Steve goes perfectly still, head bent forward, waiting for Tony’s next move. Word. Whatever it is—Tony’s still working that one out. In the meantime, Tony counts Steve’s absurdly long eyelashes, can almost see his own harried expression reflected in the deep black of Steve’s dilated pupils.
“So close, Tony. You’re so close, almost there. Almost all the way inside, can you feel it?” Steve asks, not expecting an answer, given how he claims Tony’s mouth in another kiss as he rocks his hips ever so slightly, almost for emphasis.
The thing is, Tony knows what people look like when they’re put off by the scars, the reactor—there’s always a flinch, a wince, maybe a sympathetic tutting, like Tony is some pitiable creature they found in the road. He knows what it feels like to be looked at like he’s disgusting, disposable; that kind of scrutiny, that
While Bill goes back to talking compound bows with Hawkeye, Steve looks at the man on the couch. Sam and Vision are now sitting on either side of him: both of his legs end at mid-thigh, and in their place are what look like brand-new metal limbs, designed to match his proportions exactly. The metal is dark, shiny,
It’s a gut-wrenchingly unlikely scenario that Tony has nonetheless run and re-run in his mind a thousand times, like HUD footage after a battle to calculate his own weak spots.
“O Captain, my captain!” Tony crows, wheezing slightly on the last syllable in a way that is far too endearing for Steve to handle, especially given his own fragile state. When Tony reaches a hand up, Steve doesn’t hesitate to take it and haul him to his feet.

Your presence is requested downstairs.” JARVIS, however, sounds downright peeved. “Opening remarks are scheduled to begin momentarily.”
“The rest of our lives intervened,” Tony explains, touching him—his shoulders, arms, hips—gently all the while: “it has a bad habit of doing that, even before
“Steve, this is Staff Sergeant Daniel Kwon,” Bruce offers. The sergeant smirks and extends a hand—the eyes in his sockets look incredibly lifelike, but don’t move even a fraction of a millimeter. They gleam, still, with an uncanny sense of
Out of the corner of his eye he sees Steve lean a hip against the edge of the island. It must be painful, having hard marble jammed up against bone like that, but then Steve’s a supersoldier—it probably doesn’t register as anything more than a firm, vaguely uncomfortable press to him. Tony tries to keep his mind on that train of thought and not on the way Steve’s threadbare T-shirt has ridden up a little to expose a narrow V of perfect skin.
Tony is smiling up at him from his place in Steve’s arms, relaxed now, almost leaning into him, and all Steve can think is,
Tony shifts in place. “You couldn’t be ‘just’ anything if you tried,” he says, quieter th an Steve’s ever heard him. Steve feels like he’s
It starts out gentle, barely a caress, but it feels like getting hit square in the chest with his shield. Everything stops and the only thing Steve can do is
all the while. Tony is crying, now, unabashedly, moaning every time Steve kisses his body, gasping every time he feels another blurt of Steve’s come splash against his insides, and he can’t. stop.
Tony swallows nothing but air. Steve, never breaking eye contact, cards his fingers through the hair on the back of Tony’s head and holds them there.
you learn to be patient. you learn to show more than you tell. because you realize that Tony was lied to his entire life, about so many things. Lied to his face about who he was, who he was going to be, who he never would be
He flies faster than he’s technically allowed within city limits, but the law can wait. Steve’s life can’t. Unlike the armor, Steve can’t call his uniform to himself, nor can Sam sprout wings and fly them out of there at the drop of a hat; they’re two against four heavy hitters, and as much faith as Tony has in Steve and Sam’s abilities, those are odds he’s not willing to gamble on.
is the thing Tony was literally born to do (according to Howard). Swanning into an outrageously festooned midtown ballroom right into a swarm of glitterati—whose names he knows, whose husbands and wives and children he asks after, but who don’t love him past the number of zeroes he can add to a check—is old hat. He could do it in his sleep, backwards.
Steve knows it’s going to be a long night the moment he receives a text from Natasha that simply reads:
“Alive is good,” Steve says, locking a sob away behind a smile so big it strains his cheeks. “It means you can still pay for shawarma.”
Tony knows if he repeats that over and over, he’ll eventually be able to live with it. Mostly. He holds Steve close because he can, squeezing for one more beat and nodding, his three o’ clock shadow scratching the other man’s cheek.
Tony opens his eyes but keeps them fixed on the backs of his hands, palms flat against the marble countertop.
Steve wrenches the black silk knot loose and pulls the whole thing off. It goes on the bed, along with the jacket. He unbuttons his shirt to the clavicle and rolls up the sleeves. (Tony has visibly admired his forearms enough times for Steve to make a deliberate habit of it.)
“I’m not going anywhere,” Tony says, his voice rumbling out of his chest where it’s pressed against Steve’s. Steve grabs him blindly by the hips and tugs, a breathless, needy sound escaping him when Tony pulls Steve’s face up to meet his and proceeds to wreck him thoroughly with just his mouth. There’s that word again: just. Just Tony licking Steve’s lips to get them to open and then pulling his tongue back when they do, teasing Steve into a state of helpless, moaning want; just Tony massaging the hinge of Steve’s jaw with the hard flat of his thumb as he kisses the breath out of him, open-mouthed and hungry; just the feeling of Tony’s cock filling out in his trousers, which Tony somehow manages to treat as an afterthought even as he presses it against Steve’s chest like a brand and wraps a loose hand around Steve’s neck and sets about
“Just so I’ve got it right,” Tony finally says after an unbearably quiet moment, a palm pressed against his own forehead, “you definitely had zero input vis à vis this whole blind date setup?”
Steve is rubbing his thumbs against Tony’s cheeks, eyes closed, but Tony can’t look away. He just went a whole week without this face and now he’s going to look his fill. He reaches under Steve’s jacket and rubs his back, gentling him closer until they’re flush against each other from chest to thigh.
“I can hear you thinking,” Steve says as he lowers himself onto Tony, who wraps his legs around Steve’s absurdly narrow waist without a second thought. “Care to tell me what’s going on in that big beautiful brain of yours?”
Steve turns toward him, broad chest straining against his white tee shirt. Tony doesn’t look. He doesn’t have to. He’s thought enough about Steve’s chest over the years, he could draw a perfect 1:1 ratio of it from memory.
, try not to move, Tony, hold on.” There’s a hand cradling the back of his head, all of a sudden, and a cold plastic cup is being pressed to his lips. Ice chips, he realizes. He remembers cold, a freezing sensation, terror, Sam,
Tony takes that same finger and lifts Steve’s chin with it. “I’m sorry,” he says heavily, staring straight into Steve’s wide, unblinking eyes. “I owe you a week’s worth of make outs and dates. If you’ll still have me.”
Steve could have painted Tony in that moment: vulnerable, eyes and skin and hair glowing like fire and honey and whiskey in the light of the setting sun as it glinted off the cityscape. He was handsome, small but strong, nervous but brave, and so unbelievably worth choosing it took every ounce of Steve’s strength to keep his hand under his thigh. To not reach out and take Tony’s face in his hands and just—
Steve walks right over and sits down without waiting for a word from Tony. A light breeze whips at them, mussing Tony’s hair into a delightful state of chaos, so messy and lovely Steve yearns to run his fingers through it.
, but Steve is right there ready to catch him with both hands. They burn where they’re pressed against Tony’s back, which arches away from the door as Steve kisses him so thoroughly Tony wonders if the man has suddenly decided to take up cartography.
of his time with Tony Stark and it still wouldn’t be enough. But there is only so much of himself and his time Tony seems willing to give, romantically or otherwise, and Steve’s made his peace with that. Mostly.
“That’s it, sweetheart,” Tony murmurs as he presses gentling kisses to Steve’s face, “you want to come for me, don’t you? Feel me inside, how wet I am—that’s it, baby, come on,
do not to let a howl out, the one clutching at his throat right now that’s equal parts devastation and rage. He swallows the raw, unholy sound and he weeps instead, like he’s never wept before—not for Bucky, or Peggy, or the Commandos, or Natasha, or Sam, or anyone—and then he falls to his knees in the ash and mud, everything that’s left of Tony’s last act of defiance.
Something in Steve’s heart shifts irrevocably before kicking into a whole new gear. By the end of the sentence, Steve knows he’s going to do something incredibly rash, the only question is when.
“You have no idea,” Steve rumbles, tossing the ruined pillowcase aside and moving forward to hover over Tony’s reclined body, reaching for the back of Tony’s neck. “The fact that you’re still talking is proof I haven’t menaced you
“I would caution you against your choice,” they say, wise and mischievous at the same time, somehow, “but I know you will set things right, when the time comes.”
Tony just shakes his head and smiles softly at Steve, taking Steve’s harebrained response in stride like being ignored is no big deal. Steve, meanwhile, could kick himself: he’s put a lot of work into learning Tony Stark these past few years, especially in the wake of the Ultron snafu; he knows better than to make Tony feel like he’s not worth being heard.
“Ah…” Tony huffs a soft laugh, smiling crookedly and averting his eyes so he can’t see the expression on Steve’s face. He doesn’t want to see the sadness, or the disappointment. He can’t stand it. This is why he never takes his shirt off during hookups. Relationships, sure, he can build up to this, but Steve didn’t offer him that. He offered to fuck him stupid.
In reality, however, Tony swallows back tears of frustration and exhaustion and struggles to swallow down his increasingly frantic need to run away. It doesn’t matter, though, since Steve won’t let go of his wrist, and if Tony thinks he can out-stubborn Steve Rogers while operating on fumes, he’s an even bigger idiot than Clint so often claims he is.
,” Tony grumbles. He tells himself he doesn’t lean, cat-like, into Steve’s touch, but it’s a near thing. “Finally pulled my head out of my ass long enough to realize I needed to actually
It’s been a long time since those early days, Tony thinks, watching the new team assemble on the couches, loveseats, beanbag chairs, and blankets strewn around the in-home movie theater. The screen isn’t excessively massive, per Steve’s wishes, but the sound is as good as it gets, per Clint’s; Tony updates the hardware year over year to keep up with the times, especially as film goes the way of digital (much to Steve’s chagrin).
Bill is still talking a mile a minute behind him; Freddy sits back down on the couch and lets Steve continue his “Captain America Meet-and-Greet” but makes him promise to come back and swap stories, which Steve does, happily, even as his mind whirls. How does Tony know these people? Why are they
Tony’s hoarse, braying laugh follows him across the communal floor all the way to the elevator doors.
When Tony pushes his fingers up into Steve’s hair, scratching lightly at the nape of his neck, Steve drops his arms around Tony’s waist and pulls him in close with a soft groan. He’s warm and messy and still holding that damn screwdriver, but he kisses Steve soft and eager like it’s the only thing he wants to do for the rest of his life, folds himself into Steve’s embrace like he wants to build a home right there in his arms.
Once they’re alone, the other diners seem to quickly get over the initial shock of seeing Iron Man and Captain America on a date together and go back to their own meals. The air in the room is fragrant with the smell of four-star Italian food, but Steve’s stomach is too tightly wound now to appreciate it.
Tony’s not out of the woods yet. Not like he wants Tony to suffer, but like he wants to see this, whatever it is, through to the end. “Guess I’ll have to try harder.”
it, being challenged the way Tony challenges him, delighting in the push-pull of their banter and debates, the way Tony teaches him about science and tech and the 21st century without being condescending. Steve gets to a point where he thinks he knows Tony, how he operates, how his brain works—then moments like this happen, and it’s like he’s sprinted smack into a brick wall.
As it is, though, the only response to that perfect setup of a comment Tony can muster is a distressed whimper of exhaustion, which he muffles against his palms. He knows he should wash them, given the number of other people’s hands he shook tonight, and he’d meant to the moment he’d trudged into the kitchen, but at the first sight of the doublewide refrigerator, Tony’s mind was hyper-focused on acquiring and inhaling Clint’s food.
confident, dead certain about whatever it is that’s going through his brain, which is encouraging, but still isn’t doing anything to answer Tony’s question.

,” Steve sighs, tension draining from him like water. Tony brushes a hand down the front of his chest—Steve catches it right over his sternum and presses it there. “Is there anything about this, about
“I just think it’s interesting,” a woman says blithely, “a man like you coming to an event like this,
It’s quiet for a second, but that’s to be expected, since Tony soundproofed every Avengers suite. But Steve doesn’t even have time to get antsy before Tony’s throwing the door open, a wave of rock-and-roll noise coming out to meet him. Amid rasped lyrics and snare drums, Steve hears Tony tell FRIDAY to turn the music down with a smile, throwing in a pet name for effect that doesn’t make Steve irrationally jealous at all, of course not.
The concealed gun in Iron Man’s shoulder appears with a hiss of metal—the bullet is out in less than a second, hitting Piledriver square in the center of the head. It’s not enough to kill him, but it dazes him long enough for Steve to escape his grasp and knock him back with an elbow to the sternum. Tony rockets forward and grabs Steve, one eye still on Piledriver behind him.
“What was it like?” Steve asks, meaning the moment when Schmidt held the cube and disappeared. It doesn’t even register that he’s spoken until Schmidt is looking at him and speaking back.
"Yes, please," Peter called, obviously frustrated as Tony stepped into the room to find him struggling with the knot of his tie. "I don't know why I can never get these things on straight!"
"No, no, I've already done too much that way, and they're gonna start suspecting it soon if they haven't already. Stark may be an asshole, but he's not stupid. We're just gonna have to figure out something else."
"The hospital's already ready for him, Tony," Rhodey said as he came up next to him. He clapped a hand on Tony's shoulder, attempting a smile. "See? I told you not to give up."
Steve said on a gasp as Tony trailed his fingers up the inside of his thigh to curl around his cock, lying flush against his abdomen. Steve hissed, his back arching up off the bed as Tony began to stroke him, his lips teasing the sensitive skin of his thighs and pelvis.
“Here you are, miss.  And thank you for coming in,” Steve said as he handed the lady her loaded-down shopping bag, filled with a complete boxed set of V.C. Andrews novels that Steve had had to special-order.
He'd already begun to think of Steve as his second dad, but to hear someone else say it like that, like he'd always been… that was a bit different.
"That's fair," Bucky said. "It's not like you were doing anything wrong either. I can think of a lot worse things than spending your afternoons sitting with a sick kid, even if you did lie to me about it." He paused, shooting Steve a rather harsh glare. "And why the hell'd you do that, hmm? You afraid I was gonna make fun of you or something?"
"Goddamnit," muttered Tony as he turned away, pinching the bridge of his nose. As much as he hated to admit it, the kid was probably right. Back when he was designing rockets he always had to consider that the velocity the rocket was travelling would inversely impact its manoeuvrability, and while out in space wind shear wasn't a thing, there was still the whole "folding of space" and "warp corridor" things that were at the very core of warp theory.
"Oh, like you're one to talk," Steve retorted, kissing Tony's hand again to help take the sting from his words. "How 'bout we both try. You haven't really slept since the night this all happened, and—" He broke off, glancing mournfully at their son. "And I think Peter would like it if we curled up with him for awhile."
Steve's lower lip was shaking as he swiped at his eyes. "And I love him, Tony," he choked out. "I love him so much. And it's so hard sometimes to see him the way he is, when I know how he should be. There's no way he should've ever been allowed to get as sick as he is, there's just no
"I did," Steve said with a smile. He slid his hands around Tony's waist, drawing him close. "Are you sure you're okay about what I said about your father? I don't want to overstep anything."
Chuckling, Steve rounded the corner into the massive kitchen, immediately stepping back as Natasha emerged from the depths of one of the ovens, a steaming pumpkin pie in her mitted hands.
Peter breathed out a slight sigh of relief. "Well, that's good. Then… what? What're you so afraid of?"
“Cap, we can handle the rest of these guards while you and Tony search for the cube,” Natasha says.  “Soon as the outside’s clear, we’ll follow you inside.”
"Maybe we should go shoot some hoops instead?" Bucky said as he jogged up next to Sam. "Let Stevie practise his half-court shots?"
"Dad, Papa," Peter said with a wide smile, his voice trembling ever-so-slightly as he held out his right hand. "I'm—I'm okay."
"Is your Uncle Clint always this grumpy?" Gwen whispered when they finally arrived in their suite, with Uncle Clint making a beeline for the bar as soon as they stepped inside.
"Oh gods, I'm so sorry! I didn't see you there!" the guy said, sputtering apologies as he reached a hand down to help Tony up. Tony took the offered hand and hoisted himself back to his feet, frowning as he focused in on the soldier's face.
"Sam, get Pete outta here," Tony commanded as soon as Sam landed next to Tony, a wool blanket clutched in his hands. "And call Barton, we need those explosive arrows of his."
But in that moment, cuddled up next to his living, breathing husband, his strong arm heavy around Tony's waist and the sound of his heartbeat beneath his ear, Tony didn't really much care about the turmoil the rest of the country was in, because his was finally over.
"Well, that wasn't very nice of him," Tony said. "A little nip might've helped take the edge off your nervousness a bit."
Tony leaned back as the computer began to whir, idly sipping his coffee as he watched the screen flicker with each update of the now fifteen layers of encryption.
The girl's face drained of colour so fast that Peter was afraid she was about to pass out, and she rapidly shook her head. "I can't—I'm not—I'm not supposed to—I'm sorry, I need to go—"
"Steve, please, you're just beating yourself up over and over for things that were completely out of your control," he said gently, scraping his fingernails lightly against his husband's scalp. "There's nothing that you could've done differently that would've changed anything."
"All right, are you sure you have everything else?" said Auntie Nat as they exited the floral shop. "Suit? Tie? Cologne? Dinner reservation?"
Had they all broken apart like burnt paper, as he did in his nightmares? Or was it somehow different for them?
"Probably because he's starting to warm up a bit," said Tony. "And the reentry will help with that too." Steve would still have to be checked out at the hospital, and Tony was just about to pick up the phone and order an emergency transport when Colonel Phillips suddenly burst into the Control Room, followed directly by Rhodey, Carol, and Sam.
"You know Davis is just a first-class asshole, babe," Tony said after they had walked in silence for almost three blocks, his hand tucked securely into the crook of Steve's elbow. Tony's brown eyes were hidden behind one of his many pairs of sunglasses, but Steve didn't need to see them to know how much hurt they were carrying. Like Steve, Tony always took any jab at his loved ones very personally, and Davis's remarks about him had been about as low as Steve had ever heard.
"Yeah, 'cause I don't think we'd be able to convince T'Challa to destroy the Soul Stone anymore than these guys wanna destroy the Time Stone," said Sam. "Not that I blame him, of course."
Peter was brilliant. Smarter even than Tony, and so strong that he could stop a bus with his bare hands. But yet, at the end, after witnessing four other people fade into oblivion, he had been just as terrified to die as any other teenage boy.
"But there's no goddamn way that I'm okay with just sitting here and waiting for Pete to show up on the camera feed either," Tony added. "So now that we have this location, we should—"
"I know." Steve let out a heavy sigh as the doors opened into their living room, turning to Tony as soon as they stepped out. "And as much as I wish that we could tell him no, I just—"
Steve chuckles as Peter races off towards the changing stall, shifting from foot to foot as he tries to think of something to say to Tony that’s not too horribly awkward.
A couple seconds later Gwen's face appeared on Tony's tablet, looking so worried that Tony felt a small twinge of guilt for having to lie to her. As much as he hated to admit it, the girl did seem to care about Peter, and he for her.
"I know," he said as he pressed his ashes-stained left hand to his chest, right over where Steve's dog tags hung under his shirt. "He always does, and I'm always proud of him."
"I see," O'Brien said. He placed his glass on the table and took three steps forward, getting close enough that Steve could smell the man's minty aftershave.
There was no way in hell, Hel, Hades, or any other version of a horrible mythical underworld where Dad would
"And in the meantime, I'll just keep plugging away at these decryptions," said Bruce. "'Cause there's nothing more exciting than searching through a hundred and fifty-year-old Russian Bible for keyphrases day in and day out."
"Okay, but where's—?" Steve started, cut off when the sky suddenly lit up in a brilliant burst of lightning, followed directly by the appearance of a massive axe that raced across the plain at waist-height, taking out every single war dog in its path.
They sat there silently for several minutes, until a slight cough made Tony raise his head to find a confused Peter standing in the kitchen doorway.
"Yeah, I know he is, Pete," Dad said, his voice wobbling ever-so-slightly. "But I also know that they're not just gonna lock him away and leave him alone either. HYDRA's got almost a hundred years of pent-up anger and frustration built up, and I have a bad feeling that it's all about to be directed at him."
Since he was a little kid, Peter’s been interested in sports.  Football, soccer, basketball, baseball, tennis, etc, if it’s on TV, Peter is watching it.  The Olympic years are some of his very favourite times, when he stays up way past his bedtime watching anything he can get his tablet to stream, and then goes to sleep and dreams about someday being there himself, raising his hands in the air as the massive crowd cheers for his victory.
Including his bank account.  Thanks to Steve’s naïvete, Brock was able to drain it almost dry before he finally left, leaving Steve with a dying mother, a massive pile of bills that was growing bigger by the day, and no way to pay for anything.
It was the perfect complement to the painting that hung in their Tower bedroom, the one of the three of them celebrating Steve's ninety-second birthday on the beach in Malibu, only a few days before their home was destroyed by the Winter Soldier.
"Um… well, I'm pretty sure that we didn't give you a choice in the matter, here, Steven," Hammer replied with a humourless chuckle. "So, ah, you may as well get started,
"Nice shot, Hawkeye," Sam said from somewhere above, in between a series of gunshots. "Dude never even saw it coming."
“All right, since it seems like the cat’s got Mr Stane’s tongue at the moment, I guess we’ll continue,” Tony said.  He attempted to swallow as he moved over to stand next to Sam, a monumental feat since his mouth felt like it had been stuffed with cotton.
"Yeah, I figured," Bucky said. Then he snapped Steve on the side with his wet towel, laughing when Steve yelped. "C'mon, superman. Let's see if you can win back all the credits I owe you."
"All right," Tony said as Steve noticed Major Kowalski arriving inside the anteroom, taking the last available chair next to Ma, who was holding onto Bucky's hand.
Shostakov laughs, a loud, hair-raising cackle that sends a freezing-cold shiver racing down Steve’s spine.
Steve let out a frustrated growl, yanking his hand from Tony's grasp and jumping to his feet. He raked his hands through his hair, cringing at the scratch of his fingernails on his sensitive scalp.
"Yes, you do," said Papa. "And I hope you know that there's no way our family would be complete without you."
"Still doesn't mean I'm gonna sleep," Steve said, rather petulantly. Tony huffed as he dropped his hand from Steve's head, rolling his eyes.
"You don't have to tell me twice, sweetheart," said Steve. "I should be coming up on my reentry point in a few minutes."
"Yeah, so then by my calculations, these nanites will form into whatever kind of suit they're programmed to form. Which means if I program them to form a Captain America suit, then—"
“Now, wait just a second!” Tony exclaims as he flies towards a set of concrete stairs, firing at a group of HYDRA soldiers emerging onto the roof.  “No one else is gonna deal with the fact that Cap just said 'language'?”
"Quill, goddamnit, you've gotta stop!" Dad yelled as his helmet disappeared. "Stand down, we're still trying to get this off!"
"He's doing great," Steve said as he grabbed several of the plumpest, juiciest figs he'd ever seen, adding them to his growing pile of fruit. "Shuri said we should be able to go home tomorrow."
But this… this was no joke. What they were going to attempt to do would literally alter the course of their entire universe.
"Well, if that's the case, then why didn't you and Captain Rogers go to New Asgard with your dad?" asked Gwen.
The bell rang then, causing Peter to jump as it was right above their heads. He managed to sneak into the classroom and slide into his seat just before the teacher turned around, and if he had to guess, also managed to completely ace his final exam, meaning he would finish another school year with straight-A's.
"Always taking care of me," Tony murmured as he closed out his schematics and went around the lab, gathering up the six half-empty coffee cups that had gotten strewn about over the course of the day. He contemplated showing the proposal to Steve to get his opinion on it, but decided against it. Steve was doing so much better lately, Tony didn't dare do anything that might possibly set back that progress.
"Well, I do have to admit I'm pretty excited about that," Steve said, just as another round of cheers erupted from the ball field. "Even if it does worry you."
He didn't finish his statement, but Steve got his point anyway. Tony was a visual person. He needed to see with his own eyes that Peter was still alive, and Steve couldn't blame him. Not when almost his entire adult life had been dictated by people who had only wanted to use his son's illness as a weapon to keep him in line.
"Nope," Steve answered. He reached for his shampoo, hoping that his voice hadn't betrayed him. "Just enjoying the hot water is all."
“Okay, but… did he say if the kid even knows how to swim?” Steve asks.  “‘Cause if he doesn’t, then—”
"Nah, the actual Decathlon competition isn't even until April, so I have loads of time to finish the essay. I'm just—"
The fact that they were all banking on the prison being in a coastal area, and not in some other inaccessible place like on top of a mountain or something was something that Tony chose to conveniently ignore most of the time. Intellectually he knew it would be a lot easier to supply a building that was near water than in a mountainous region, and emotionally—
“Shh, honey, it’s okay,” Tony said as he began unbuttoning Steve’s uniform jacket, tossing it onto the far corner of the couch.  Steve had explained to Tony earlier that week that whenever he was feeling especially “jittery”, for lack of a better word, any tight clothing he was wearing only made it worse.  It was the same reason why he liked to sleep in the nude, or in very loose-fitting shorts or pants, and why he rarely wore underwear.
“Oh no!” Steve grunts as he fumbles, trying to get his shield underneath him.  But before he can even begin to move, he suddenly lands completely flat-footed on a cracked cement floor.  A jagged cry of pain escapes his throat as his right leg gives way, its sickening
"Why do all of the crises have to happen in the middle of the night?" Peter said as he packed his laptop into his backpack. "Why can't something like this ever happen during normal business hours?"
Bucky shrugged. "As far as I know she's on the widow's compensation fund since her husband was killed in action."
Scott shrugged. "Well, I can't say I don't have experience with not abiding by laws, and I'm sure there's also a law somewhere out there that says that people can't communicate with ants either. Or turn into massive green rage monsters, but—"
Tears pricked Steve's eyes at the memory, of how sweet they had looked, and how envious he had been. He had already been trying to deny it by then, trying to bury deep down just how deeply attached he was to them both, and, based on what Tony told him later on, doing a very poor job of it.
It had been a little over four years since SHIELD had pulled him out of the Arctic ice, and two weeks later sent he and James to recover Tony and Peter from their kidnappers in Afghanistan. Those two weeks had been the most disorienting days of his life, having no home, no real identity, not knowing at all what to do with himself in the strange, new world of the future.
"Oh God, what the hell was I thinking?" Peter cried as Gauntlet Man reappeared with another rifle, firing a shot that came so close Peter felt the heat from the blast go past his ear. Before he could react Gauntlet Man fired another shot, this time severing the web attached to the van. Rolling and bouncing, Peter finally skidded to a halt, his entire body stinging and aching from bodysurfing on asphalt for the last three minutes.
"Well, once Pete gets better I'm sure he wouldn't mind helping her out," said Tony. "Long as she doesn't mind."
“You needed to see me, sir?” she said once she’d stepped inside, her ever-present clipboard clutched in her perfectly manicured left hand.
Steve shook his head, halting the thought before it could fly away from him. He didn't need to be going down that road now, not while Peter was literally right in front of him.
"Well, all TV shows aside, these numbers look good to me," Bruce said as he pocketed his glasses. He stepped around the hologram, tapping his chin. "So… then… does that mean we're actually ready to test this thing?"
"Tony," Steve whispered as he slipped his free hand between their bodies, wrapping his fingers around Tony's erection as his thrusts began to stutter. "Oh gods, Tony, I'm gonna—!"
"Thank you," whispered Steve. After ordering a humidifier and a large supply of Vicks VapoRub to be delivered to the Tower, Steve retrieved the damp washcloth from the bathroom, cleaning the dried sweat from Tony's body before helping him change into a fresh t-shirt and pair of pyjama pants. Then he swapped out all three of Tony's pillowcases and tucked him back into bed, handing him his tablet and a full glass of water.
"No!" Steve said, far too emphatically, he realised after the fact. "I mean, no, thanks. I don't want to bother him if he's busy."
"No, probably not," Peter muttered, rubbing at his eyes. He'd been awake for over four hours the previous night working on more of the HYDRA files, and his eyes were already starting to lose their focus.
As soon as the door to Peter's room clicked shut, the composure Steve had been fighting to maintain melted away, and he dropped his head, bringing Peter's limp hand to his lips.
"Yes," said Gwen. "Which is why my dad gets cardiac checkups every six months. But your dad's not a completely normal person either, is he? Didn't you tell me that he got some early version of a super-soldier serum when he was little?"
“Uh huh.”  Peter is quiet as they begin to walk across the campus, too in awe of how pretty it is despite the frigid January cold.  True to form, he starts coughing before they’re even halfway there, pulling his inhaler out of his jacket pocket and taking two hits as they arrive at the heavy double doors of the three-story Athletics building.
Turns out, thanks to the security cameras that covered the parking garage, Obie had found out about Steve, making Pepper the unfortunate recipient of one of the worst tantrums he had ever thrown in his life.  Pepper had confessed that even employees working on nearby floors had overheard Obie’s rant, with many wondering why in the world he was so upset about the fact that Tony was dating someone.
"Steve," Tony suddenly said, tugging gently on his arm. Steve gulped as he leaned forward, his eyes going wide as no fewer than seven senators in a row proceeded to vote Nay.
Tony stared at the police officer's hand, his lower lip shaking as he tried to decide what to do. He needed to find Peter ASAP, before HYDRA had a chance to get their hands on him. He was assuming that Peter took off on his own because he thought that it would be easier for a single person to sneak in to wherever they were holding Steve than an entire team, but…
Tony tilted his head as he looked up into his husband's gorgeous sea-blue eyes. "Three years ago I might've thought it was just a coincidence, but now—"
And the sex surely didn't hurt anything either. In fact, as he and Steve clung to each other later that night, with Steve's head resting on his chest, Tony was convinced that there had been far too few clinical studies conducted on the sleep-inducing prowess of orgasms, and that someone really needed to rectify such an oversight.
He had just grabbed his wallet and keys and closed his bedroom door when Howard suddenly appeared in front of him, his eyes all hooded and bloodshot and still holding the highball glass in his hand.
"Um, sure," answered Peter, trying very hard not to glare at Gwen. She had informed him after she took over as captain for Liz that she wouldn't be giving him any special treatment just because they were…
The fact that Captain America was also Tony's husband and Peter's papa didn't matter to them at all, because why should they care about breaking up a family when they had their whole global-domination evil agenda to push?
“One hundred percent,” Tony stated.  “Actually, how ‘bout we say one million percent, just in case you're not quite convinced.”  He paused, trailing his fingertips up and down Steve’s spine, something he had discovered that Steve found soothing.  “A lot’s happened this weekend, honey, too much to go into until we get you cleaned a bit, so… what do you say we head over to the Tower and get you fixed up, yeah?  I’m thinking a hot shower and shave and some food might make you feel a lot better.”
"That's my boy." As soon as Sam took off, Tony dropped to his knees and fired up his laser, attempting to burn through the ice and cursing when it didn't seem to want to melt fast enough for his taste. He didn't have any missiles available, and while the repulsors were another option, he suspected that the force required to break through the very thick ice could possibly injure Steve, and Tony was too afraid to risk it.
"Oh Christ, I'm not talking about you, you idiot!" Dad snapped, shooting Quill a harsh glare. "I'm talking about my
Tony gave a short nod, his eyes turning mischievous as he reached his hand between them, cupping Steve's already resurging erection. He leaned forward, pressing kisses along the shell of Steve's ear as he whispered, "You ready for more now, baby? 'Cause I wanna ride you."
To a chorus of "yes, sir!" accompanied by the hair-raising sound of scraping chairs, the pilots all shuffled out of the room, with Bucky yanking on Steve's arm almost before he had managed to clear the threshold.
It’s not a big deal when Steve, walking back to the tower after his standard Sunday morning thirty miler, is approached by a throng of reporters just outside the front doors. Their questions follow a single obvious thread, and for some reason, he’s compelled to reach for his phone.
But Tony flirts with everyone, Steve reminds himself, and then he’s out the door. He opts to walk across town and down 12th Avenue, what should be a long walk along the Hudson shortened considerably by his long legs and enhanced speed. It’s one of those beautiful New York days, long, late May sunlight lingering in the clear blue sky even as Steve turns the corner onto Thompson Street at 5:45. It’s breezy but not chilly, warm but not stifling. People are everywhere, happy, flushed and bubbling over with spring fever. Even the hardened locals aren’t immune to it—Steve spots a grizzled bar owner just down the street who’s leaning against an old brownstone, face tipped up toward the sky, lips pulled tight in a barely contained smile.
Tony flushes as he stares at the back of Steve’s head, remembering the feeling of the man’s big, hot hands palming the undersides of Tony’s thighs as he’d kissed him senseless. Tony hasn’t had a lot of time to sleep this past week, let alone jerk off, but that hasn’t stopped him from replaying the events of that night in his head like projector footage behind his eyeballs. He’s only human, after all, and that material is solid gold. They flicker and catch, snapshots of images and feelings, even now: the chesty sound Steve made when Tony stuck his hands under his shirt to grasp at warm skin; the filthy swirl of Steve’s tongue against his; the long, thick press of Steve’s dick against Tony’s when their hips met the first time and the way Steve had kept Tony there, one hand on his hip and one on the back of his neck so Tony could
. There’s so much if it—even as Tony stares it spills over and runs down Steve’s shaft, following a particularly protrusive vein all the way down to his balls like a river through a gorge. Tony wants it in his mouth
Pepper calls him in a panic; FRIDAY claims she’s been locked out of all communications barring an emergency. Tony’s not in the workshop, nor is he on his floor; every car in the garage is accounted for, even Howard’s old hot rod. The quinjet is still parked on the helipad at the top of the building. Steve looks high and low for Tony, texting Pepper intermittently
Before Tony can blink, Steve is off the bed, making a beeline for the bathroom and leaving Tony naked, starfished and Steve-less on the mattress. “Uh.”
job of pretending not to glance pityingly at Steve and the two untouched champagne glasses on his table. Steve sighs and shrugs at the waiter (his name is Duncan, Steve learned during Refill Number Three), who’s come by to refill his water glass again. How many does that make? Five? Six? Duncan glances at the empty seat across from Steve and shakes his head.
Steve smiles at him and rubs a thumb up against Tony’s hole, smearing the mess around and back inside him. Tony drops his head and whimpers, clutching Egyptian cotton for dear life as Steve moves, sliding his knees up to bracket Tony’s hips before he pulls his cheeks apart again and nudges the head of his cock against his rim. It flutters on contact, desperate for more of that perfect heat, more of Steve filling him up to bursting; Tony nods, biting a knuckle as Steve slides in, easy as anything. God, he’s so open; Steve’s fucked him loose and sloppy wet.
It’s then Steve notices the large anatomic heart hand-stitched in black thread at the bottom of the tie. Against the blood-red silk, it looks viscerally
Tony, and that grief is a ten-ton weight in his stomach. And yet, standing here looking into this Tony’s big brown eyes, faced with that benevolent (if teasing) smile and generous heart, Steve feels young and limitless, weightless, like he’d float off the floor if it weren’t for Tony, who’s still holding his hand against his chest.
that he wasn't worth the effort of loving. that he would never be loved for anything other than the black credit card in his wallet, the cars in his garage, the houses and the private jets and the clothes and the money and the things he invented—the things he
, because when is he ever going to have this again? As soon as Steve is satisfied that Tony’s urges have passed, he’s going to leave and take that perfect mouth and that gorgeous smile and that stunning cock with him. And what’s Tony going to be left with? A beautiful memory, to go with all the others he has of Steve.
A sound Steve hadn’t heard in over seventy years. And when Steve thanked him afterwards, once Bucky was out of earshot, Tony had simply patted his shoulder with a wan smile and said,
When Steve faces him, rises to his full height and levels a look at him that is equal parts Captain America and
“We’re not actually engaged,” Steve mutters. Clint throws his hands in the air and stomps off cursing like
"Eh, kinda. But at least it worked," Peter said. He pushed himself back up to his feet, offering Tony a hand. "Dad, did you really give me spider legs? They're so cool!"
"Tony—!" Steve cried as the tears started to flow, dripping into Peter's hair. "Tony, what if—what if I
Twenty minutes later, panting and sweating, Peter dropped down into the small lab, relieved to find that Dad hadn't ever gotten around to cleaning it out. He quickly opened his laptop and got to work, inputting the same suit parameters that Dad had used for his old Spider-Man suit, and also adding two additional slots in his waistband for more web fluid vials and one of the locator chips that Dad always installed in Papa's uniforms, which would allow him to send out a signal once he was ready for backup.
“Good afternoon, young man.  Can I help you?” a soft, kind voice suddenly said from somewhere to Peter’s left.  He turned to find a tall, blond-haired man sitting on a stool and smiling at him from behind a small counter, an obviously well-loved paperback held in his left hand.
Anguish suddenly bubbled up from Steve's gut, stoked by an accompanying rush of anxiety, and he ducked out of the room, leaning against the wall in the hallway so Peter couldn't see him. The last thing he wanted was for Peter to see that his papa was as scared as he was.
"Well, I just meant, don't you need them to actually see?" Gwen asked as they stepped inside the classroom, the cold, dry air practically slapping Peter in the face as they took their seats. "I've just noticed that you squint sometimes when you're not wearing them."
"I made the reservations a week ago, and Dad said I could use his cologne since it's the only kind that doesn't give me a headache," Peter answered as he climbed into the backseat of Uncle Sam's car. "And we picked up my suit yesterday."
Steve nodded into Tony's hair. Sam was smart to have called Tony with that particular question rather than Steve. "I know, sweetheart, and I'm okay. Really."
"Thor, be ready," Steve said, gripping his shield so tightly that his arm was shaking. "At my signal, back off just enough to allow Thanos to retrieve the stone."
He stared down at the notebook until he heard Natasha's departing footsteps, huffing out a sharp breath once he was alone again. He had no real reason to be as nervous as he was, but he supposed Sam would tell him that it didn't matter if there was a reason for it or not. His feelings were still his feelings.
Instead of answering, Phillips turned his datapad around to show Tony, his jaw dropping as he noticed at least three different sets of aircraft that were nearly identical to current Langaran Air Corps designs.
"Well, maybe they don't know yet. These look pretty new." She reached inside, pulling out a pint carton of ice cream that read Stark Raving Hazelnuts and handing it to Peter. "This is your dad's, and this one, the Star-Spangled Berry Blast, has to be for your papa."
"And you never close your bedroom door," said Uncle Bucky, rather slyly. "What, your dads don't want you seein' that girl or somethin'?"
Tony gave a nod as he shoved the comm device into his ear. "Steve? Steve, honey, are you there? Steve? Oh gods, don't do this to me now, honey! Not when we've just figured out how to—"
"Well, that's kinda beside the point now, sir, wouldn't you say?" Steve replied. "I still should've had all the facts before I agreed to participate, and yet you specifically chose to leave that one off. Why?"
"Yeah, I know," Steve said quickly. "I'm just…" He trailed off, not quite sure how to finish his sentence.
“Okay, then I wanna help you,” Peter stated.  “If something’s happened to Papa, I wanna help you figure out what it is.”
“Tony?” Steve calls again, a bit louder this time.  He steps forward, attempting to peek through the window, his heart jumping into his throat when he sees nothing but blackness.
"Peter, what're you doing?" Gwen hissed as he pulled up the sleeves of his hoodie, activating his web shooters. "We're supposed to be meeting my dad at the museum!"
Uncle Thor says to Flash, 'Pardon me, young Midgardian, but I daresay that I heard you call my friend Starkson here an idiot? Would you care to explain why you're referring to him in such an unnoble manner?' And of course Flash tried to say that he didn't, that Uncle Thor had just heard him wrong, and then Uncle Thor goes, 'It might not be a very good idea to insult my hearing right after you have insulted one of my closest friends.' And then, oh my gosh, Dad, you should've seen the look on Flash's face! He looked so nervous that I thought he was gonna pee his pants!"
It had been so long since Tony had been intimate with anyone that he'd almost forgotten what it was like, but none of those former encounters could at all compare to the care and intimacy that Steve showed him. With his initial franticness satiated by Tony's blowjob, Steve took his sweet time with him, kissing and nibbling and caressing across almost the entirety of Tony's body, leaving him a panting, writhing mess by the time he finally grabbed a bottle of lube from his bedside table, slicked up his index finger, and slowly pressed it inside him.
One of Steve's hand suddenly joins his mouth, releasing its hold on the side of Tony's chest, and – Tony has absolutely no idea of
He kisses him gently, lovingly, massaging the reddened skin of his wrists as he slowly pulls out of his body. Tony immediately clenches up, not willing to let any drop of Steve's come escape from his hold, and kisses him back with all that he's got.
just staring at it, feeling his heart swell with love and serenity and everything he's never had before Steve.
Tony can feel his body tensing up instinctively under Steve's scrutiny, but he forces himself to relax and swallow down his insecurity as much as he can. “It's. It's the make up, Steve.”
Tony must feel his eyes on him – and he sure can feel Steve's hands pulling on either side of his hole, not quite touching it, but exposing it so much that there's no
Tony absolutely jumps him, pressing a kiss to his mouth just to shut him up before he can say anything else. “You
“You're so good to me, sweetheart,” Steve says gently, pressing a kiss to his spine as he hoists himself up, trailing kisses down his shoulders as he sits back up on the bed. “Turn around for me. You're doing so good, darling.”
He thinks of his poor feet trapped inside the boots, where his ankle is still wrapped in a little bandage and hurts at every step – especially because of the heels – , but he regrets nothing. Steve's been so good, he always
do, since, you know, the plans for tonight kinda mostly involve a lot of kissing and sucking and – ”
Steve looks hesitant to raise his arm, but when he does, he touches the side of his thumb to Tony's lips and barely grazes at them with it. “Can I?” He asks, looking Tony in the eyes for a moment.
Steve smiles down at him, expression fond and reassuring and he leans down to kiss him. Tony feels his fingers probe at his hole again, easily making their way in and lubing up his entrance with zero effort, carefully avoiding his prostate as he pushes his fingers in deeper. Tony's glad – it's already hard not to come on the spot as it is, thank you very much.
“You're amazing,” he murmurs against his mouth, kissing it again. “I can't believe you did all of this for me.”
Tony grabs at his arm like an animal, nails sinking into Steve's skin fiercely. “Don't even think about it,” he snaps, staring right into Steve's eyes.
, but then the pain dulls a little and he holds his breath as long as he can, forcing himself to calm down, while Steve still gently flicks the tip of his nipple with his tongue.
Tony shivers where the leather grazes against his nipples; he hasn't really zipped the jacket close, but he has definitely made sure it keeps covering the entirety of his hips – and what's directly underneath them – and the sides of his chest, so that Steve will have no idea of what's under the leather until he undresses him. What he will see when he comes home is Tony covered from shoulder to thigh in his bad-boy looking leather jacket and wearing a knee-high pair of boots, with just a patch of tanned skin visible between the two parts of his outfit.
“Shut up,” he mutters, embarrassed, pulling him into a kiss again. “God, will you please undress me already? You're killing me here. There's your huge, gorgeous cock out in the open while mine is still trapped underneath this jacket and it just, it seems a lot unfair, alright – ”
His voice breaks on the last word and turns into a high-pitched squeal, because that's when Steve suddenly lowers his head and teases at his right nipple with his tongue.
Tony groans loudly as both Steve's tongue and fingers start working him open now, gently but determinedly, slowly but surely. He's still so tight, he would
But then he gives in, Steve's fingers twisting his nipples way too insistent to be ignored, and, just like that – Tony is riding his face. Completely, utterly, unreservedly
, until Tony finally catches his breath and makes a hand gesture at him, allowing him to get back to his chest.
Tony throws his head back, exposing his throat further, and Steve doesn't waste a second; one of his hands leaves Tony's hips to cup his jaw instead, his thumb touching the opposite side of Tony's neck to angle his face as he pleases and then press
Steve silences him when he presses his thumb lightly inside his mouth, not so much as to make contact with his tongue but surely enough to graze at his teeth. It's more than sufficient to make Tony stop speaking.
yeah, finally,” he groans, not even thinking about dignity, already moving onto his hands and knees to get Steve to fuck him as deep as he can. “Never been so horny before. I swear to god. Steve,
The pain that suddenly explodes in his chest is completely unanticipated, taking him by surprise, and so fucking intense that Tony almost jerks back – and he
He can't see Steve's face, because his forehead is pressed in between Tony's neck and shoulder, but he can hear him mutter the words back. Their stomachs are rising and falling fast one against the other where they're pressed so

Steve grabs him by his shoulder and by one of his hips and just like that, he effortlessly turns him back to where he was before, his back against the mattress; Tony loves being manhandled like that, but he also loves deep penetration, so his cock is momentarily very confused by all that.
. Steve's free hand strokes his hip gently, soothing him when Tony gets so impatient that he doesn't even register the whimpers he's letting out of his mouth, and then finally
, Tony's had enough. “Want you balls-deep inside me, Steve. Want you to fuck me hard and fast until I'm begging you to stop,” he says, just trying to burn some anxious energy, “want you to choke me while you pound me 'til I fucking

because of how hard it is, and because of how little Tony's actually touched it – tonight's protagonist has only been his butt, to be honest, and while Tony is resolutely
Steve doesn't even jerk him off through it; Tony comes utterly untouched, Steve still fucking him through it, and Tony's pretty sure he's going to faint as he shoots his load so high that some streams of come land right on his chest. His hole spams around Steve's cock, clenching up so tightly that it definitely pushes Steve over the edge, too; Tony feels every bead of his come as Steve fills him up, emptying himself inside him to the very last drop, and Tony feels himself be shaken by a full-body tremble as he slowly comes down from the rush, panting and shaking and waiting for his heart to stop hammering like that.

. Steve's always hesitant to hurt him, to explore Tony's kinks when they have to do with violence, but this – this is perfect. Tony simply has to make sure Steve doesn't realize just how painful all of it is.
Steve's thumbs run across the length of the metal bars sliding through the skin of his nipples, and he keeps staring at the two metal orbs at the end of them with absolute fascination. He presses against one of those tentatively, sliding the metal bar a little to the opposite side, and Tony yelps in pain.
, and Steve immediately pulls away. He stares at Tony, worry clear in his eyes even as his pupils are blown wide and his eyes are looking so
his index and middle finger in and out of his hole as Tony whimpers and writhes and sobs desperately and –
So Tony does the only rational thing, cupping the back of Steve's head to pull him closer, to pull his face down until he can whisper in his ear.
his ass looks right now. He feels as if the spanking never came to an end; his flesh still tingles where Steve's slapped it for so long, and he has to focus hard on breathing and relaxing before he can stop clenching his muscles so bad.

all this feels. Tony lets his weight be supported by Steve's hands, and presses back against them with his own before arching his back a little, finding Steve's arms blindly behind himself – anchoring himself to the safety of his limbs. “I'm gonna come as soon as you put your dick inside me, I swear to – ”
So he had washed his hands before they could come any closer to his cock – or ass – , put the lube away, and ordered a few juicy items from an online store.
that he can't help but smile. Steve lifts his head up, sees his lips curl into a ecstatic smile, and smiles back at him softly.
Steve nods once, and kisses him to soothe him. One of his hands immediately strokes Tony's tummy tenderly, feeling the soft skin of his stomach under his palm as his other hand caresses Tony's jaw, sweet and warm and reassuring.
Steve groans as he takes him in, gaze adoring where it lingers across every inch of Tony's body. He finally,
Steve chuckles against his lips, but Tony is determined to shut him up for good. His fingers intertwine with the blonde hair at the base of Steve's neck and pull him

with a little too much strength, but Steve doesn't seem to mind; Tony's other hand travels across his arm, from Steve's wrist to his shoulder and then up to his jaw, cupping it as he kisses him harder. Steve's hands slowly grab onto his hips, and Tony moans softly into his mouth as he rolls them against Steve's.
and his body falls forward, one of Tony's hand grabbing Steve's hip to keep his balance and the other one squeezing at the base of his cock so harshly that Tony yelps in pain, desperately trying to squirm away from Steve's hold as Steve's other hand grips one of his hips so fiercely that it takes just that, just
He strokes up Steve's back, feeling the tense muscles relax underneath his touch. He follows the planes of his shoulders, then sinks his fingers back into his blonde hair.

But that's not the right moment for that; they'll make love later, at the first light of dawn, when their thirst will be sated and their bodies won't be aching so bad to be one again. Tony pulls gently at Steve's hair, letting him know that he needs this too bad to content himself with just some passionate kissing, and Steve chuckles and rolls his hips against his and –
Steve kisses the back of his thighs, both of them, allowing him his silence, and Tony feels his light beard scratch at his skin in the best way possible. He relaxes his throat as much as he can, and deepthroats him slowly but determinedly; he feels Steve's cock slide down his throat inch after inch, and he forces himself to breathe through his nose and keep a solid grip of Steve's legs for balance, thinking that Steve deserves it. Steve deserves it all.
– when Steve, anticipating his protest like the fucking bastard he is, just straight-up runs his hands up his stomach, stopping just shy of his nipples – a fucking bastard, alright, but
it looks; it's aching as Steve's saliva cools down on it, and Tony gasps as Steve gets started on his other nipple just as his fingers go back to teasing the one Tony's staring at it, giving it a firm twist.
He doesn't immediately bite at his skin again, and Tony is thankful for that. He resumes teasing his nipples with his tongue, with the pads of his fingers; it's only when Tony is breathing normally again that he lets his teeth run around the tip of his nipples, not biting yet, just testing the waters.

Steve is definitely used to what a fucking untamed beast Tony is in the bedroom, so he barely flinches as he takes his arm back and lets himself be pulled down by Tony's hand against the back of his neck, meeting his lips half-way and kissing him within an inch of his life. Tony pushes himself up to roll his hips against Steve's, letting out a few quiet moans as their cocks slide against one another and desperately urging Steve to get a move on before he tragically dies – young, handsome, and horribly, unreasonably robbed of an amazing orgasm.
He doesn't properly take Tony's jacket off, but he does pull the two sides of it apart just enough to reveal Tony's chest; Tony can hear his breath stutter all of a sudden at the sight he reveals, his whole body tensing for a moment as he stares at the two metal bars sliding through his nipples, kept in place by two very tiny metal orbs.
Tony groans, letting his head fall back to the pillow in exasperation. Big, blonde and absolutely dumb – of
. He pinches Tony's other nipple, and Tony has to bite hard on his own lower lip to keep himself from swearing out loud.
Tony gasps, the sudden hit violent and unexpected; he doesn't even manage to catch his breath again before Steve spanks him again, on the same point, and then
Tony throws his head back, pleasure too intense to be fought; Steve keeps biting at his throat as Tony's body arches up beautifully again, angling his hips so that he drills his cock right into Tony's prostate, and Tony's free hand trembles where it's desperately clutching to Steve's back, hopelessly trying to keep itself away from his cock –
He doesn't know for how long they keep laying there, pressed tight against each other, content and sated and finally satisfied, but he knows that when Steve lets go of his wrists, they hurt so

,” Tony says, batting his eyelashes once, slowly, while grinning proudly up at him. Steve is just staring, stopping dead in his tracks.
He pulls at one of Tony's cheek with his free hand as the other one keeps thrusting the butt-plug gently in and out of his body, never letting it completely out before sliding it back in. Tony's skin is mostly dry and Tony is moaning quietly around his cock, letting his discomfort be known, and Steve takes pity on him and finally pulls the butt-plug out of his hole.
for attention. Steve just bites harder into his throat, leaning down across his body so low that his stomach rubs along Tony's cock once,
Tony is loving every moment of this; it's clear that Steve is just as eager as he is, because he's barely containing his strength when he grabs the side of Tony's thigh and lifts it to wrap around his hip, and then
Tony briefly, distantly thinks of how much of a strange pair they make. Steve's easily embarrassed when out of the bedroom, caste and completely reserved about his sex life; he cannot dirty talk for the life of his, and always lets his actions speak for himself – whereas Tony, instead, is all clever talking and desperate begging and shameless desire, always up for literally
Tony can hear Steve's breath as it catches in his throat, cutting his air flow in half so abruptly that even Tony worries for a second. And then Steve's eyes snap back to his own, and he blinks and stares and stares and stares and
that the elastic will probably be stretched to the point of no return by the time they're done with how hard the both of them are pulling at it by both ends, but Tony just can't bring himself to care. He throws his head back, covers Steve's hands with his own – their fingers immediately intertwine, Steve showing his love and support just by doing that –, and lets himself
If Tony closes his eyes for a moment, he can feel the lace where it's resting against his half-hard cock.
Maybe he just doesn't want to see it. Maybe he just won't humour him this time, because maybe he finds this weird of fucked up or maybe even
Tony catches the exact moment Steve feels the fabric of his panties against his naked skin. His lips stop moving mid-kiss, and he lets out a quiet gasp of surprise.
They stare into each other's eyes for a few seconds, neither of them dropping their gaze. Tony smirks lazily, pleased by the challenge – and by the way Steve never backs off from one – and pulls his chin back towards him, kissing him again.
He finally applies the lipstick, slow and careful despite the very little time he has left to get dressed up and prepare himself for what's going to happen. He's already styled his hair; he has left it grow in the last eleven weeks, and then he has cut it slightly with a razor on a side, while leaving the other one and the hair at the top of his head intact. He has curled his hair a little on the top of his head, too, so that now it looks a little softer – a little more feminine.
When he finally manages to do both his eyes well enough, he can't help but sigh out loud in relief. He moves on to applying his mascara, then his eye pencil in the inner parts of his lids; he's already laid some concealer and some foundation on his face, given up on using brushes and applying cool eye shadows, and now there's only one thing missing.
The jacket zipper unexpectedly presses against his very much exposed cock – lace doesn't really put much of a shield (
he doesn't feel at least a little bit vulnerable – , and he turns around a little to try and glance at him. Steve meets his eyes before they go back to his cock, finding sucking his dick better than receiving any embarrassing praise, and the look he gives them is one of utter adoration.
on his hair to expose his throat even further; Tony gasps, the sudden pain completely unexpected – Steve almost never pulls on his hair, finding the gesture disrespectful where Tony finds it a huge turn-on instead – as Steve leaves his mouth to kiss just under his Adam's apple, and then pushes him backwards until Tony's lying down on the kitchen isle.
settles between Tony's thighs, pushing a pillow behind the small of his back to support his weight and keep him in position without Tony having to tire himself out, and then leans down to kiss him before leaning towards the bedside table, presumably thinking of wearing a condom.
Tony glances at the digital clock on the desk; five minutes. He hurries up to slide the metal bars back through the,
sensitive bundle of nerves with each thrust of his hand, ramming them right into his prostate to the point that Tony's stomach muscles spasm
, Tony thinks, and grins lazily against Steve's mouth. “You really had to make such a mess of me, uh?” He says, brushing his nose against Steve's and chuckling wetly against his lips. “Are you pleased with yourself?”
Steve groans softly in reply, and Tony takes that as an affirmative noise and gets back at relaxing his throat and swallowing down his dick.
Tony gulps, not reassured yet despite Steve's words. He's suddenly very aware of the jacket sleeves partially covering his hands up to his knuckles, and can't help but feel grateful for that; for the light feel of comfort the fabric simply gives him. But he's suddenly also very aware of how much the boots are pressing against his bandaged, still very painfully hurting right ankle. “Is it?”
Tony pulls away from the kiss a little, just enough to let Steve know that he's alright, that he can keep going. Steve licks his own lower lip, nods briefly again, and then gets back to his chest.
“Oh, shut up,” Tony says, grabbing him by the back of his neck and pulling him into a kiss, definitely not wanting this very sexy moment to be spoiled by l'antisesso that he is. This is no right time to eat a damn birthday cake – unless that's an euphemism for his very tasty, very perfect bubble butt, obviously.
He wishes he could blame his nipple pumps where they're awkwardly sucking his skin out, wishes he could say that it's just that they're bothering him and distracting him from drawing a goddamn
“Steve,” he whines, writhing on the bed like he's putting on a show, and instead just being one hundred percent his slutty regular self. “
“Yeah,” Tony breathes out, nodding a little too quickly. “It's, it's supposed to resist through a lot, of, um,
of his demise. It's the heels, isn't it – Tony knew they were too much, too feminine – or is it the fucking make up? The
Tony thinks of the love letters Steve's sent him almost on a daily basis while he was at the hospital, even as he keeps blowing him and doesn't acknowledge his words; thinks of the flowers, of the drawings, of all the little things Steve's sent him in the last two months to make him feel loved and supported even while they were apart. He thinks of the roses, of the
The pain that shoots right through one of his already abused nipples shocks Tony out of his tantrum, stealing the breath from his lungs like a goddamn punch to his stomach, making his eyes widen and his mouth open in a silent cry for mercy. Tony completely loses his balance as Steve releases his hold on him, falling gracelessly to his knees and elbows across Steve's body, forehead pressing into the mattress in between Steve's legs and his lower lip quivering as he slowly, barely blinks, and doesn't even register letting out a loud, wet sob.
“Tony, you're the person with the highest libido I've ever met,” he says, so serious that Tony has to try his best not to chuckle right in the middle of a blow job. “How did you manage to be so
sound his camera makes when Steve takes a photo of his butt. Tony forces himself to move his own arms and pull his own cheeks apart with trembling hands, so that the red jewel butt-plug inside his body can say hi to the camera, too.
Steve suddenly bites on his right cheek, unprompted and unexpected; Tony's body rocks forward as he lets out a high-pitched squeal, but Steve grabs him right by the thighs and
“You look so swell,” Steve says, voice weak with delight as he looks at the eyeliner across Tony's eyelids, at his styled hair, and back at his red-painted lips. He glances at the cake on the table for a moment. “The cake looks good, too.”
Steve's fingers finally leave his entrance, and Tony interrupts himself as his blood leaves his brain too fast for him to finish his own sentence. “Oh yeah, oh
, what with the zippers and the studs and the general bad-boy look. So naturally, he wears it only during their secret dates – because no-one would think Captain America would wear something like
He finally stands up from where he was seated, taking a deep breath before removing his nipple pumps. It's a bit painful, but it's definitely worth it; his nipples look a lot bigger, much puffier, and proudly pointing forward. Steve is going to
Something explodes deep inside his stomach, his vision blacks out, his limps go completely slack and, just like that, Tony's finally coming.
He takes Steve's long, beautiful leather jacket before heading to the kitchen; the one he never wears, because he finds it a little bit
He hears Steve's breath catch in his throat again. “God, Tony,” he mutters, his voice sounding weak. He doesn't say anything else, but then again – Tony knows his ass would leave most people speechless.
Steve strokes his back gently, his hand warm and soothing as it trails up and down his spine lovingly, muttering gentle little praises that Tony just can't hear from where he only feels his blood running through his ears. And Tony simply lets himself cry and whimper and tremble, heart swelling up with love and hands shaking lightly where they're grabbing desperately at the sheets; Steve knows just what he needs. He gives him the love letters, the flowers, the portraits, the pleasure, the pain, and Tony

) against it – , and the harsh, unanticipated friction steals his breath away. It's quick, and painful, and Steve rolls his hips against Tony's again and Tony gasps out loud, loving every single second of that sweet, sweet torture.
He keeps completely still for as long as he can, his lips circling the base of Steve's cock, before he has to lift his head again and take a huge gulp of air back into his lungs. He jerks Steve's cock off with his hand until his throat stops hurting so bad, collecting the precome at the tip of his dick and spreading it around, even if Steve's cock is already so wet with Tony's own saliva that there's really no need for it. He cups his balls and mouths at them, too, as he regains his breath, and Steve just groans from behind him.
“Lay down, sugar,” he instructs, collecting a few pillows to put behind Steve's head already. “C'mon.”
Steve groans out loud, pulling his face away to kiss him again; Tony lets himself be kissed and waits until Steve has had enough of his lips before turning around, sending one last smirk at Steve before laying down on his stomach.
doesn't want to come like this. He lets out what vaguely sounds like a legit growl, and scratches at Steve's arms like a fucking animal as he struggles to break free from his hold.
Steve nods slowly, pulling the sides of the jacket further apart. It still remains zipped at the base; still covering Tony's hips and part of his thighs, so that Steve can't yet see the panties he's wearing. He kisses Tony again, briefly, and then finally grazes at his nipples with his fingertips.
and incredibly swollen, his nipples hard and still pointing forward, and Tony thinks they should definitely do this again some time soon.
, and he's barely lubricated where the butt-plug sinks suddenly deeper into his body, pushed-in further inside his channel by the sheer strength of Steve's hand. Steve smacks him again, and again, and again, on every inch of his skin covered and not covered by the white lacy panties, and then
Tony runs his tongue up and down Steve's length as Steve finally pushes his own in, Tony's muscles finally relaxing around his tongue as it slides deeper inside him, lubricating the tight passage with his saliva. He keeps at it until Tony is barely able to keep blowing him at a steady pace, and then finally releases the hold he had on one of his cheeks as he gently pushes one of his fingers inside him.
– very much responsive skin of his nipples after all the pumping, apparently, and walks to the front door in a rush, still barefoot, finally sliding into his knee-high, inner-wedged black leather boots.
It's just, he's seen the way Steve stared at those when Tony showed him an old picture of himself in his teenage years, alright? He had first gotten one of his nipples pierced when he was twenty-one, thinking it would be fun and everything until he realized it hurt a little too badly, and had to go to the hospital in a rush to avoid a nasty infection. (To his defense, or maybe not so much, he had gotten the piercing done by a friend of his completely unqualified for the job, in a hurry, and being drunk off his ass.)
He's going to start and beg him again when he finally feels the head of Steve's cock pressing against his entrance; his legs instantly become jelly, thighs falling apart and lips already parting to moan out loud even as Steve is still kissing him. The poor soul knows Tony like the back of his hand, though, and the first thing he does is grab at one of his legs and bring it up to lay on one of his shoulders; Tony lets himself be bent in half if that's what it takes to keep kissing Steve, even with how difficult that is now because he just can't bring himself to stop gasping and moaning every few seconds – especially since Steve keeps alternating his gaze between Tony's face and nipple piercings when he pulls momentarily away from his lips, staring at the tiny metal orbs at the sides of his nipples as they catch and reflect the light from the chandelier again. Steve leans down to mouth at his chest, kissing one of his nipples and then flicking his tongue reverently at the scar tissue around Tony's arc reactor, and
Steve hushes him with a kiss, pulling away from his body just for as long as it takes him to grab the lube from the bedside table; Tony sighs out happily when he hears the familiar sound of the lube bottle being opened and then squeezed, and lets himself close his eyes and rest his head for a second as he waits for Steve to be done.

Steve puts a little distance between himself and Tony's body for a moment, glancing curiously at what all his efforts have made of him. What he sees does

“You're so beautiful,” Steve murmurs, like he's able to fucking read his mind. He cups his jaw by both sides with his hands, stroking his cheeks with his thumbs as he pulls Tony into a kiss, and hums softly against his mouth as he lets Tony hold onto his shoulders as desperately as he feels the need to.
Steve eyes him for a second, but he knows better than to protest. He lays down, letting Tony straddle him as he fixes the pillows behind his head, and then Tony smirks down at him and kisses him some more.
Steve exhales a slow, shaky breath. Tony clenches his muscles, knowing Steve must still be staring at the red jewel butt-plug inside him, and feeling it sink a little deeper into his body. “I'm so tight,” he murmurs, because it's true, and because it

Steve snorts, still kissing away at his throat, but his hands do travel down the sides of his torso until they get a hold of the white, lacy fabric, sliding it slowly down Tony's legs. Tony offers the bare minimum amount of cooperation to help Steve undress him, but Steve still manages to slide the panties off him within the blink of an eye and then, like it's a normal thing to do,

“What's this?” Steve mutters, pulling away from the kiss to nuzzle softly at his neck. “Hmm. Smells so good,” he mumbles, lips brushing vaguely at the tender skin of Tony's throat. Seems like someone has a taste for expensive perfume.
that Tony's whole body spasms, his eyes snapping open and his nails sinking into the blankets. He feels like the breath has been punched directly out of his lungs.
Steve doesn't reply, more than just used to Tony's complete lack of patience by now. He still takes his time, though, pushing his fingers in and out of him slowly, then a little quicker, and finally much faster, until Tony's panting softly while staring up into Steve's eyes, completely unashamed.

“I will, I will,” he says, just to humour him. “Steve, I swear to god, if you don't touch me in the next five seconds – ”
. He grabs the edge of the desk with both of his hands after he's done, and waits for the uneasiness to pass as he just focuses on his breathing.
When he opens them again, though, he can immediately hear Steve walking inside the house; his heart starts hammering in his chest even harder than it did before, leaving his head spinning and his mouth gasping in surprise. But he steels himself as he hears Steve walking closer, closer and closer and
“You're still so tight,” Steve says against his lips, still driving his fingers deep in and out of his body. Tony throws his head back again, gasping softly as he finally feels Steve's knuckles pressing right against his opening, and huskily replies, “then you'd better hurry up and stretch me wide again, sugar.”
; his thighs are trembling with the effort to keep still as Steve fucks him with his tongue, his ass is on fire where Steve keeps kneading it and spanking it, his nipples are begging for some fucking mercy and his head is spinning and his throat is sore and his mouth is tired. It's absolutely
He swallows loudly in the big, empty room, staring at his reflection in the mirror for a moment. It takes him a few minutes before he nods to himself and takes the lipstick from the desk in front of him; it's just a nice, deep shade of red, cherry flavored and, if the label says the truth, water-resistant.
Steve's hands come back up in sight, but they linger on Tony's chest for a moment instead of undressing him already; Tony pulls away from the kiss, sending a curious glance at him. What is he hesitating for?
Now, he’s got a fresh full-body tan from time spent in the sun, a slew of new tech ideas for the team (including an infinitely better low-profile tracking device for Natasha, because who says he doesn’t do nice things for people), a mostly-rested brain, and a packed schedule that will allow for very little—if any—interaction with Steve.
wanted but didn’t have the courage to articulate—it’s as heady an experience now as it was then, being on the receiving end of that look from Steve Rogers.
Tony can’t decide if the thought of Steve seeing him like this helps or worsens the rattling in his chest. Either way he feels like shit, but only one of those ways ends up with Captain America pitying him, or worse.
“I’ll let you go, then,” Steve says, already leaving the kitchen before Tony can respond with anything. He manages to catch Steve’s eye as he waves back at Tony on his way out.
”), which became a blush whenever Tony directed one of those goofy, face-stretching smiles at him, the ones that make his crows feet accordion. Then Tony invited Steve into the workshop the first time he worked on Bucky’s arm, and the compassionate, gentle tack he took with his childhood best friend was like a bit of sun come to earth, a warm, blue glow that melted the hard edges of him in Steve’s eyes until he was just Tony, a mechanic, a man, wearing goggles and an old t-shirt stained and threadbare past all hope of saving, doing his best to
Tony does the obedient thing for once and waits, because he wants to see what Steve’s got planned—sure, he’ll reassert himself later, but for now it’s a thrill to lie spread out for Steve and
Steve—walks through the main doorway into the kitchen and stops dead in his tracks the moment he lays eyes on Tony, whose thoughts are spinning out at the sight of him. Steve’s presence alone is enough to derail him, but Steve dressed in perfectly tailored slim-fit chinos, a black jacket, and what Tony suspects is nothing more than a plain black T-shirt is icing on a large cake Tony desperately wants to devour.
Tony’s tongue is heavy and sluggish from orgasm, from watching Steve come like that, but that nasty, pestering phantom taste is still there on the back of it. He doesn’t feel as bad as he should when he shakes his head and replies, “Still itching.”
He’s staring. At Tony’s chest. He knows he is, but there’s no helping it. Just like there’s no helping the way he reaches out and pulls Tony into a hug like it’s the last thing he’ll ever do. It wasn’t long ago he’d carried this same body, suit and all, off the battlefield, crying himself hoarse even as he laid Tony out on a patch of grass in the sun away from the smoke and desolation. He’d watched this man die not seventy-two hours ago, and here was Tony, in his arms the way Steve should have held him years and years and
as he pets him, kisses him quiet in this exact state, suspended in the sublime afterglow of a marathon fucking.
Funny—ten minutes ago he was coming back from a team exercise, prepared to give Tony a friendly but firm talking-to about missing it, and instead here he is, breathless, heart racing, sitting and listening to Tony talk humbly about fixing people because he knows it’s the right thing to do. Because it’s the
So when Tony feels the itch start in his fingertips, that telltale tacky dryness prickle in his mouth, after days of fighting everyone from the prisoners at the Raft to corrupt SHIELD agents and dinosaurs in the Savage Land, he goes dark. Says goodnight to Jarvis and the team, the
because it's raining outside. because here you are, high up among thick grey clouds that smother every inch of the city, so it's just you two, in this bed, together in your own little world, and you're watching that stubborn ember of doubt in Tony's eyes finally get washed away.
“Oh thank god,” Tony groans, head falling back. Steve prides himself on managing to look at anything other than the long, fluttering line of Tony’s throat in that moment. “You’re a saint, Cap. We’ll get it done first thing tomorrow, promise.”
“Shh,” Steve hushes him with a soft kiss to the corner of his mouth, “it’s alright, honey, I’ve got you. Just tell me what you want and I’ll give it to you.”
looking, like Tony is a jigsaw puzzle and Steve’s just found the missing piece. It’s an unnerving look, piercing through and exposing parts of Tony he’s spent years hiding under layers and layers of false confidence and sarcasm and armor, so much armor—shiny, pretty tricks to draw people in and keep them at a safe distance at the same time.
him. It doesn’t change the fact that Steve wants nothing more than to hold his hand, now that it’s hanging at his side like its string was just cut. “A while back I dug into Air Force records, talked to Rhodey, got some names.
“Yeah, let me know how you feel in twenty minutes when it starts getting crusty.” Grousing helps Tony ignore the discomfort-slash-embarrassment of having come in his pants and the fact that he still has yet to talk to Steve about the thing. At least Steve looks as rumpled as Tony feels, hair ruined and clothes disheveled, patchy with sweat and twisted in all the wrong directions and stained in some pretty obvious places.
“Y-yeah,” Tony manages, voice trembling, weak and watery, despite his efforts to quash it. “I want it. I want—I want it.”
Redhead is gabbing excitedly, gesticulating like Tony does when he’s in the mad depths of an invention binge. Steve sees the glint of metal and hears the whir of mechanisms working smoothly together in tandem and realizes both of the man’s hands are prosthetic.
Together in the darkest part of the room he and Steve work in tandem to load the first reel onto the projector and let it run: it’s early footage of the first Avengers team, recorded off of a news broadcast. Down in front, the rest of the team throws popcorn and jeers, laughing themselves hoarse at the costumes, the villains, the dialogue—“‘He’s a real ball of fire!’” Clint wheezes from his beanbag before Natasha pelts him with Milk Duds—while Steve and Tony sit back behind the projector, shoulder to shoulder, running their own private commentary all the while:
“What did I tell you,” Tony says when Steve moans softly again. This time, he doesn’t miss the way Tony stares lingeringly at his mouth like he wants another taste. “
, it’s so easy to laugh with Tony. The man is hilarious, sure, but little things like that—things that only Tony would think to ask Steve because they know each other so well and he likes making fun of Steve’s idiosyncrasies, likes making Steve loosen up and laugh at himself—make Steve feel like the champagne he drank earlier: bubbly, light,
“Really?” Natasha keeps unwrapping her hands, staring thoughtfully over Steve’s shoulder. Her face journeys from skeptical to wondering to shocked—as shocked as Natasha Romanoff can ever be, Steve assumes. “He
against Tony's skin. There's a white patch of fabric underneath the panties, just a narrow line of white going in between his globes, and Steve hasn't yet noticed what lies just below it.
,” Tony sing-songs, imitating the sound of Steve's voice as Steve sits back down on his ankles. Tony sends him an adoring look despite his mocking – he's so happy Steve is as much as a pervert as he is, even if he attempts to hide it, really. “What are you going to do with it first, darling? Give it a good slap?
“Fuck, Tony,” Steve mumbles, taking a good grab of his right cheek. Tony moans softly, the pain still too vivid to be ignored; he feels Steve's hands moving gently up and down his skin after he puts his phone away, Steve's thumb stroking the meat of his cheeks with a little too much strength at first and then unbelievably gently, and Tony's ass and nipples are on fucking fire and he really feels like crying for a good hour or two, but he also doesn't want to ruin his make up.
