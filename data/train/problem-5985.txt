“Don’t make me go through that again,” Steve says. “Tony, I can’t do that again. I can’t keep doing it. I can’t.” He bites it off.
It still couldn’t save me, he doesn’t say. It still didn’t heal all the wounds. It opened some new ones that never closed. I learned volumes about new kinds of pain.
Rhodey says, “Ok, you need to listen to me,” and Steve puts down his assault rifle and sits on a moldy wooden crate and braces himself.
It leaves Tony gasping. It takes everything he has not to scream. His chest is burning, it is so close to when Steve had his shield in Tony's chest he is certain this must be some sadistic, karmic lesson. He twists his torso around as much as he can, dry-heaves.
“Lower your voice, Mr. Stark,” she snaps right back. “As important as he is to you, so are all the other people on that list.”
Tony looks at the ceiling and sighs and blinks and blinks and blinks. “I honestly don’t know what you get out of this,” he says.
Steve still smells like the plane, like the airport, like the AIM base he’s been building his cover in for the past 3 months. It’s true; he can’t call Tony selfish for wanting him here. Pepper isn’t his partner. Pepper can run his company but no one can make Tony do anything.
What if it doesn't work, Tony says. What if it doesn't. I can't handle it if it doesn't, Steve, I can't do that -
Tony sits there, frozen, with the silence stretched out between them, Steve just out of his reach. Blood sliding out of his mouth.
drowns out even the antiseptic, the industrial sizing on the never-used upholstery. He opens his mouth to tell them to fight somewhere else but there's a tube in his throat and the place where Steve's bite sits on his throat feels swollen and full.
He hopes it's enough. He doesn't know how to say that he's been busy dying while Steve has been busy cowering.
Steve throws himself on his belly, hugs the body of the drone; inches back down as they climb through a cloud. Tony can barely make out his shape, but then Steve’s hand closes around his, pulls him up.
He looks like he could use a good fucking, Mike is saying; already back in their loft, through the wall. They don’t think he’s home, maybe. They don’t know he’s listening. He tucks the card into his belt.
Clarity is slipping away from him, there’s just warmth and need and urgency. He wants to stop being upright like this, he wishes Tony would just plant a foot in the small of his back and tip him onto the carpet face-first, hump him into the rug, pull the strap on his collar again, he wants all of the noise
“It does bring out my eyes,” he concedes. He gives himself another once-over. A little shudder runs through him. He’s flushing, up his chest and over his cheeks and a bloom of it on his back.
,” Steve all but screams, which is a line he’s never used before but god help him, he’s going to be using it for the rest of Tony’s life. “He’s – fuck,” he says, more to himself than to her. He scrubs his hands over his face. He’s so tired of this.
“I just want to help,” Steve offers. “Will you let me help you, at least?”  He reaches out to touch Tony’s shoulder and Tony flinches violently away.
Mike, Mike, Mike, Gary says, and Steve is left with silence and Tony’s rapidly receding face and one hand crammed into his boxers.
“I know you’ve made up your mind,” Strange tells him. How unfair, that it’s only now, under cover of darkness, behind Stephen’s heavy oak doors – that he is understood. That he is seen. That they can let this ugly secret thing between them out in the open for a little while. “But people always want them back,” Strange continues quietly. “You know, Tony came to me, after Norman Osborn–”
He has fantasized every flavor of reconciliation. He has bargained, in the dark: anything to have the taste of Steve's skin one more time. One more moment of the softness of his voice in Tony's ear. He kept telling himself that if he willed reunion to be, then eventually it would be. That Steve would recant. That Steve would apologize. That the entire world would turn on its axis so they could be together again.
Tony looks genuinely hurt, and the petty part of Steve that’s been growing these past few months shudders with delight.
“It’s nothing, Steve,” Tony sighs. He doesn’t even seem to notice that he’s losing his erection. He runs his fingers through his hair like he’s going to start pulling it out by the roots.
Tony doesn’t know where they’re taking him, but they transfer him three times on the way to the airport and exchange his cuffs for the SHIELD-standard manacles that he designed for Steve. They pack him into a Quinjet knockoff that looks like it infringes upon several of his patents just as it starts to rain.
"It will be slower, this time,” Strange says, finally. “It won't be instantaneous; it could take hours for everything to go. Steve, do you fully understand what you’re asking me to do?”
You're not even sorry, Tony says, and he reaches out across the bond before he realizes he's staring into space, again, there's no way for him to transmit his anger even if he wanted to. It feels like screaming all alone in a padded room. The line goes nowhere.
Tony is crying again. It just climbs up and spills out of him, like there’s no stopgap at all. Like he’s a poorly engineered dam, one flood away from catastrophe. He’s crying over letters. They’re not even love letters.
“No one did this to me, no one – I don’t have a fucking – pimp, or whatever you think. It’s my business,” he says, and his voice is harder now. “It’s my business who I fuck and what I put in my body and I’m perfectly capable of driving myself into the ground without your help.” His eyes go unfocused and slide up away from Steve’s face. “Not that you were around,” Tony says.
Tony decides that he's going to comply. He will let Steve knot his mouth. He will let Steve bite at his gland until he's sobbing. He will let Steve drive his temperature up until he burns alive, he will let Steve take. He will live.
“Say what,” Tony presses, “That I’m a fag, steve? That Tony Stark is a cocksucker and Captain America cruises 54-”
Steve perches on the edge of the bathtub, close at hand in case Tony passes out. “He picked up your distress signal from an island in the North Pacific,” he recites, “You wouldn’t say anything to him, Pepper says you’ve been missing for two weeks, you had no armor and you were barely conscious.”
There’s a misery here, too, thought. It’s just too high to notice. You think something is going to last forever – the war, the team, the party – and it ends. Everything ends.
Because Tony is a problem solver, he snatches the card and Rubell’s secondhand shit and turns the powder out and lines up another bump, and one more for good measure. He’s going to dance. He’s going to feel like a million bucks if it kills him. He’s going to find someone that looks like Steve and that will be enough, for a while. He’s not here to be sober.
At some point it gets away from him. Most things do. It’s why he was so effective. Why he has so many ribbons on his dress uniform.
Steve wants to ask why Tony couldn’t have written that part out when he made all those fucking upgrades – the part of him that’s convinced that no one could ever want him as he is.
Steve rides the elevator with a beautiful woman who smells like Tony’s cologne. She gets off the elevator on the 83rd floor, where Tony’s executive offices are, and Steve lets the doors slide shut and rides right back down to the lobby.
Jocasta can’t tell him what happened, she was offline. Steve wishes he wasn’t facing whatever this latest trauma has been alone, but Rhodes had to get back to work. It’s just Steve and Tony and Tony’s issues for now. Steve does his lap, does it again, jittery, off-kilter. He should have done more than leave messages when Tony missed the team meeting last week. It’s not like him; Steve should have known better. He has been quietly losing his mind ever since Rhodey called him yesterday from the air.
“No,” he says, and Steve must be dripping on Tony’s foot. “I don’t think so.” He’s not pulling all the way out anymore, just slides out long enough to tickle Steve’s gag reflex then pushes back down. He stays there for seconds and Steve’s ability to care slides further and further out of his reach.
The technician tells him they don’t know why it’s happening, and Tony finds he doesn’t really care. Another mystery, another obstacle to closure he already fears will never find him. It’s fine; he nods in the appropriate places. They think he’s grieving. They think he is heartless. They think this is another chore for him.
Steve is working on how to tell him he doesn’t know how to exist in a world without Tony when Tony collapses in the hallway.
she’s saying, and armed SHIELD agents descend like they were waiting in the wings. Like everyone knew this was going to happen all along.
Steve has to carry Tony into the elevator and sit there, Tony’s head in his lap on the helicopter pad while he nudges aspirin into Tony’s mouth to chew.
Steve didn’t say that there was no kid, that the pilot died. That the plane crashed into the forest and the debris field was two miles long, that Steve walked away from it with a pair of dog tags clutched in his hand and third-degree burns over his chest that would heal in a few weeks. That he’d limped back to camp with his hands still stained with blood and acted like it was nothing.
Tony’s eyes snap up to meet Steve’s. He looks awful, up close, carries dark circles under his eyes. He doesn’t look sated or well-fucked or moderately content. He looks like Steve feels. Like he wants to stop.
“You’re this perfect thing,” Tony says, and gestures uselessly with his hands, “you forgive me when I shouldn’t be forgiven, you’ve forgiven me for things I can’t even remember and you
Steve coaxes Tony onto the sofa, armed with new gauze and a warm washcloth and fresh underwear. Tony lets him change the bandages, lets him scrub at his skin one inch at a time and smooth new butterfly strips on and daub Neosporin on his stitches. He goes somewhere else, his eyes vacant, his gaze sliding away.
“I can pretend this never happened,” Tony breathes. His eyelashes are very long. They’re face-to-face, chest-to-chest.
“– not gonna lie, this is bad, ok, you’re lucky Maria pulled out her dick and took a page out of your book and found some obscure bylaw in your stupid fucking bill that gives her jurisdiction over convicted Metahumans–”
Steve sits with his knees curled up to his chest on Tony’s cot. Something warm sparks in Tony when he recognizes his face. It’s a strong face. Like Steve has strength for the both of them.
Tony won’t meet his eyes. “I’m fine,” he says, undoes the buckle on Steve’s collar. “Are you?” He drapes a towel over Steve’s shoulders, like he owes him something.
“I have an idea,” Tony says, tentative like he never used to be, it’s horrific. “I think – Reed had it, actually.”
Steve’s eyes snap open. The man is licking his own spend off his fingers, catching a trickle that’s threatening to run into his beard. When he turns his face up, the strobe lights up his face, hits his eyes just right, just for a moment.
Steve sits back on his heels and swears. There’s nothing in here they can use, and he knows if he’s able to coax Tony to standing it will be a long shameful walk upstairs and Tony will disappear into their bedroom and odds of getting him out again – fed, sunshine, human interaction – are slim. “I can’t, we can’t,” Steve says. “Damn it–”
Tony shivers, his eyes barely open, lets Steve hoist his ass up a little, sprawls out against the pillows with his mouth the color of sin in the light filtering in from the late afternoon sun. He palms himself, unhurried, and it’s been so long since they’ve gotten more than a few stolen moments of this, since they’ve been on these terms – shaky as they are – since they’ve smiled at each other instead of sniping, they’re
Steve’s gaze keeps drifting back to that thing shining in his chest. The skin around it is red and angry and tender, like Tony is somehow generating new scar tissue before Steve’s very eyes.
The man who’s trying to kill him flips him over, drags him through the mud, gets one red-gloved hand around his throat.
He’s Nomad, now. The garishness of his costume helps a little but he still feels like a predator, sometimes. The difference between hero and vigilante stalker is the press team, he thinks. Tony’s money earned him freedoms he took for granted. He’s been careful enough that he’s only made the papers twice now in three years – blurry photo on both occasions, police blotter mentions.
Jen is going through her briefcase. “That’s not what I said,” she says. “There’s no precedent for this hearing. You answer to Congress, you’re being scrutinized by the UN, they should have told us Maya was gonna testify, ok? You need to pull yourself together and we’ll deal with it, whatever happens, I’m not gonna bail on you. I’m on your side.”
“Steve, please just do something,” Tony says to the ceiling. “Just tell me you want me,” he says, soft enough for a normal man to miss.
He laughs and puts one hand over his chest. He touches his face and maybe he’s smearing his eyeliner and he closes his eyes and thinks about how it felt to wear a mask and how it felt to have a home and how it is to watch it all sliding out of his reach. He feels the rev, feels the onslaught of neutral regret and what-if’s building.
Steve, Tony says. Steve puts the tip of his cock to Tony's mouth. His skin feels hot, which can't be correct, they can't both have fevers. Tony's muscles protest, rigid, unused. He reels. Unaccustomed to being upright.
Tony takes a while to answer. “I’m wondering if I’m something you’re going to regret tomorrow,” he breathes. “I’m wondering if you want all of me.”
The part of him that is living in the future, that is inaccessible, wants to know what really did it. If it was Thanos. If it was the hunger. If it was the cumulative loneliness of the whole affair. If it was sealed from the moment he decided he was going to go to Siberia and
Steve reaches for his cock, and Tony kicks. His limbs aren't mapping right, his scant body is wracked with chills, but he fights with all the ferocity he channeled on Titan. He has all his blood. He's taken Steve down before on a thousand mats, in a thousand simulations. He can do it again. He throws the sloppiest roundhouse of his life and –
“I love you,” Steve tells him, because he can never say it enough, because he has a year and some days of lost time to make up for, time that Tony is never getting back, and despite – or because of - having come back to life several times himself, he lives in constant fear of tomorrow, the what-ifs drumming madly through his head in the still hours, in the dark. What if he leaves you. What if he dies again. What if
and he is blind from tears and all he wants is to not be alone, all he wants is three words he’s never going to get –
Steve looks upset. Like Tony should have let the thing eat his hand. Like he wasn’t properly maimed. He sits crowded into one corner of the helicopter and drifts alongside Tony’s gurney and looks at the morphine drip as if Tony’s forgotten he’s an alcoholic.
He has lived this moment enough that he knows to anticipate the moment when the faceplate breaks apart, when his nose fractures. When he can finally see Steve’s eyes with his own.
Steve cradles the back of Tony’s head and drags him into a filthy kiss that would feel entirely inappropriate to the situation if it weren’t for Tony’s enthusiasm: Tony’s wandering hands and Tony’s teeth dragging at Steve’s bottom lip and they way Tony
He pulls away, chest heaving. He’s flushing again. Always so transparent. Tony looks at him, dazed and hungry.
Tony punches him. Steve doesn't even lean out, just lets it happen, just lies there with his head on the same pillow and blood running out his nose.
Leonard says other things. He has been watching security logs. He has been talking to Maria. Even now Tony is erasing footage from the past few hours, equally damning.
This isn’t new. Sometimes, he takes himself off the team. In his head, just for the weekend. He drives out here on his bike and he does normal things, laundry, dishes, runs away from that feeling of
We were running away, Steve said, maybe just to get them all to shut the fuck up, and Tony should have seen it then, how he was getting tired around the eyes. We’d blown up a Hydra base. The bridge was out. There was an airstrip, there was a plane to steal. So we were clear, he said, like anyone off the street could steal a plane, and all the Avengers held their breath, because that was then and Steve could carry anyone’s attention if he wanted it. We were in the sky, he said.
It’s a terrible privilege and a terrible roller coaster. He’s miles ahead of Steve, he’s a genius, he’s dazzling when he’s at the top of this game and violently sad when he’s not. It’s all Steve can do to try and anticipate, to minimize the collateral damage, to forestall the inevitable place Tony circles back to: self-loathing and entropy and dispossession. And Tony’s not crying anymore, but his face is still wet, his eyes are still watery, he still looks like he never wants to go out in the sun again, it’s like walking over land mines and orbiting a star at the same time and if Steve can mitigate this disaster with his body, well.
Steve rides the edge of unconsciousness. The man cradles his head, touches his wrinkled skin like it’s precious, coaxes him through the unrelenting agony that's happening in his frontal lobe. "What am I supposed to do," he cries. He rocks them together and Steve is dimly aware of the feeling of sobs racking the body adjacent to his own. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” the man is chanting under his breath. “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
Steve must wait too long to answer, because Tony draws in a shuddering breath and buries his face in his hands. “Rumiko came to my house and told me she loved me,” Tony says, like he’s forcing the words out. “And the armor was right there and I just stood there like a coward and I didn’t say anything–”
Steve eases them to the wider part of the couch, one hand carefully on the small of Tony’s back, dips him like a woman and lays him down while Tony is still reaching for him. “Steve, ah,” Tony says. “I don’t, I don’t know if I can.”
“Director,” the technician is saying, because Tony has bent one of the struts on the industrial shelving lining the room. His hand is bare; he’s taken off his white glove. He’s put his hand over Steve’s heart; he’s got rust-stained dried blood on his fingertips.
like this. Tony wants to memorize it, he is seized by a recklessness, a greed, a hunger that will never be satisfied.
“Ok, stop, deep breaths, Tony,” Steve says, because they’re dangerously close to a full panic attack and Tony’s ribs are broken. Steve dares to look at the thing and he wants to deny it, but Tony is right: yesterday it perched on his chest, protruding like some sinister parasite, today it’s almost flush with the skin. “Jocasta said it was fine, right?”
His psychiatrist has four guards, today. They fan out behind her as she brings the barrier all the way down. They point rifles at his body. They wear armor.
Maria visits him hours later to check up on him. She is armed with words like ‘help’ and ‘rehabilitation’ and ‘acute stress syndrome’ and Tony yells at her until he is crying and two junior agents are pointing guns at him and Maria’s sympathy has evaporated.
Tony lets out an ugly laugh and runs his hands over his face. He nods to himself and bites at his lip and smiles a dead smile.
with Tony going on missions with five fingers of scotch in him and Tony sitting at the breakfast table pouring rum into his coffee and not caring that Steve noticed.
Tony taps at his watch. “Jet’s on the tarmac,” he says, like there wasn’t a time they slept in the same bed. “Window closes in 30 minutes.”
Something that looks like candlelight flickers in Tony's periphery. Something wet is in him, around him. He is so open, so, so wet. He can feel Steve's come on his skin where the air currents hit, Steve's weight on his back.
"Was that ok," Steve murmurs. He wants to be gentle. He feels dull and wrung out and the furthest thing from kind there is, but he can do a fair approximation for Tony.
“You leave all your dates high and dry?” Tony says, spinning his armor with words like the hurt isn’t spackled all over his face, but Steve knows better. He’s known him too long. This part is ugly, without the cloak of sex and drugs and anonymity. Steve is a stranger, it’s nothing. They have nothing, in this alley, on this night.
“I know you’re mad at me, so just, cut it,” Tony says. “I know it’s my fault. I haven’t been paying attention, I didn’t do enough prep for Y2K, I let it happen – no, I did, Steve, it’s my job to think of things other people don’t think of, it’s just. I hate that it turned out the way it did,” he whispers. “It killed Whiplash, Steve, it tried to kill me, it was obsessive and it said it
“You have Extremis,” Steve says, and Tony feels his anger surge, like the air is electrifying. Steve’s grip on him tightens. It’s like Steve thinks if he can just hit Tony hard enough maybe he’ll shake the monster out of Tony.
Tony presses a hand over his belly, where his sleeve is, where his little controller sits and runs his heart.
I do, Tony says, and the truth of it feels like an ambush. But I've never known - I've never seen this work, Steve, I-
“I fucking know now,” Tony says, and he’s flushing. He shoves his hands in his pockets, but not before Steve can see how they’re shaking.
“It’s been said,” says Steve, and places his feet back where they were. Tony makes a sub-vocal cry of dismay and turns back to the mirror. “Your color is whatever I say it is.”
“Your review is coming up,” she says. She ducks her head to try to catch Tony’s gaze. Tony wrings his hands under the table to stop them from shaking. She is kind enough not to use the word “trial.”
before Tony throws himself into his task and Steve’s cock is out and then buried safely in Tony’s mouth. Steve threads his hands through Tony’s hair - he likes it this length, it’s almost as long as it used to be before Tony woke up in that hospital room with his memory gone and his head shaved to his scalp - and then Tony is pushing his knees apart and Steve is bucking up into his mouth because Tony is doing a sinful suction thing with his mouth.
Steve smells like body odor and hasn’t shaved in two days and goes into the hallway to listen to some asshole doctor tell him that Tony needs a new heart and there’s a goddamn waiting list. Survival rate, she says. No alcohol. She says other words, exertion and stress and The Best Care.
Something runs through his brain, a zap, a jolt. There’s no pain, just the deep, nagging sensation that something is wrong.
Steve looked at the cards in his hand and threw them face-up on the table. It was too late, he said.
You're still in pain, Steve says quietly, as he pulls out and replaces himself with a plug. Aren't you.
Steve pulls his arm away without explanation. He gets out his cock, and Tony knows: they're not going to talk about it. He lies there like a precious bequest. Preserve at all costs. Like if Steve touches him wrong the patina will spoil. Tony feels Steve jerking himself, feels the heat of it at the small of his back. Only has a moment to process the idea that maybe he is being violated. Maybe he should care. Smells the wet salt smell of it when Steve takes a handful of it and massages it into Tony's neck, right against his glands. A trickle of it drips down his collarbone.
He doesn’t press it. No one uses these anymore, anyway. There’s no way Tony’s kept one, he's better than that. You don't carry around broken tech for nostalgia’s sake. These cards are relics. Fossils. If Tony had any sense he's already auctioned the rest of them off.
Steve’s nose is pressed into Tony’s stomach. The urge to pull back is useless; he’s fully bound, he couldn’t break the bonds if he wanted to. He remembers: swallow, keep swallowing, just hold it together until Tony pulls out. He has to pull out.
Tony lets his face drift into a placid smile. “No,” he tells the psychiatrist. “There’s no one here.”
“You know what,” Tony says. “Fuck you.” He fumbles with his wallet, the beds of his nails paler and paler every day, comes up with a few hundreds, throws them on the table. Marches out to where Happy is parked, holding the wall for guidance as he goes.
. It does the trick – Tony sighs and some of the tension goes out of him. He strokes a thumb over Steve’s cheek. He finds his rhythm again, and Steve vaguely realizes it’s happening, it’s going to be over. It’s going to be a memory.
“I can’t feel anything,” Tony says, and he can’t keep his hands away, now. He’s softening and the silicone follows his form. He picks up his own cock and drops it, fondles himself, runs his thumb over the pinhole at the tip. “What is this? I should be – very aroused, because this is – a revelation, but it’s like.” He bites his bottom lip. He presses his mouth into a line. He swallows, hard.
There's no Friday, Steve says. I took her away. You're not getting better because you don't trust me, he hisses.
It’s fitting, he thinks. It’s like the first time he took medication, after Afghanistan. He feels blunted and wrung and slow and he is a criminal among his own kind and he should feel the bright lash of shame for what he’s done.
Steve looks at him, a fight starting in his jaw. He shakes his head, casts his gaze down. He wipes his nose. Tony feels absence when he slides out of bed. He retrieves cool cloths and new sheets and a new gown and linens for Tony. He produces sweats from somewhere.
Tony drags himself back from wherever he’s gone, blinks at him, once, twice. His eyes get a little sharper. “I wish you would,” he says, quietly.
“No,” the man says, and he sounds different. Distant. Bitter. “No, you’re not dying.” His laugh sounds hollow and wet. “If I’d known you despised me this much, I’d have left you alone. I wouldn't have pushed,” the man says hoarsely. “You know, you called me a coward once for doing this.”
, did he hire you to fuck me and run, am I going to wake up to some story about what a fag Tony Stark is, was the ambassador not enough for you vultures–”
Steve sets the coffee on the bathroom counter, sets the bagel on top of that, tucks the blanket around Tony. Tony lets him.
Steve presses his mouth together and shoves his feelings down as fast as they try to bubble up. Distance. This is why he doesn’t come to Midtown, this is – a disaster.
,” Steve says, and whirls around so he can gesture at Tony’s whole body. “I don’t know what’s going on with you, I don’t like that this is the second time in two months that you’ve almost died–”
He almost pulls the flask out of his pocket before he remembers he can’t and he grips it so tight that he feels the metal bending in his pocket.
Sometimes Steve forgets that Tony's body is older, that he has accumulated decades of injury and trauma. That it's not always a matter of fighting.
Tony rolls over and looks at the wall. “Don’t look at me like that,” he tells Steve’s ghost. “Don’t do that.”
so rarely. His scar looks pinker than usual, today, he’s got bruises all up the side of his ribs where he must have been throwing himself around in the suit. He’s lost weight, he’s not coloring his hair. He’s not coloring his beard. His pubes are limned in silver, too. The joke is always the same, thrown carelessly at Steve – nonagenarian, senior citizen, grandpa – but Tony has lived three decades longer than Steve. He has a way of making Steve wonder if he’s drawn to titans because his whole life has been constructed for him.
“…sell that, you know,” Gary is saying, hoarse and lazy enough to make Steve flush, and then someone is in the hallway and Michael’s laughter is echoing just on the other side of Steve’s door and something slides under the gap and skids to a stop on the linoleum.
“That’s stupid,” Steve says, and Steve’s hand is on his, Steve’s fingers are guiding Tony’s hand to an open, the shield strapped to his wrist. “You need to call for help.”
Friday, call someone, Tony tries, but his voice bounces off the ceiling and Steve smothers his mouth.
Steve sags on his knees and lets the tears slide out of his eyes. He doesn’t care, it’s just endorphins. It’s just the sex. It doesn’t mean anything. Tony pretends not to see, and so they orbit each other, together, utterly alone.
at him, roving eyes and wandering hands. He stares at Tony’s throat. Tony wants to tear his face away but he’s stuck on the guy’s eyes, the fullness of his lips, bright and pink when the lights strobe over them. Tony wonders what color his cock is.
The unfairness of it burns in him. He is a greedy man; he wants to cradle Tony to his chest, he wants to wake him up with a kiss, he wants to comb Tony’s body for his off-switch and break it so he can have Tony’s undivided attention forever. He wants this, again.
, buried, unmoving, so close that it’s unfair to both of them, he knows, and he can feel the gasp run through Tony’s body, feels it hitch in Tony’s chest and Steve bites his earlobe and Tony halfheartedly tries to get away but he’s moaning, he’s saying something unintelligible and Steve can feel the weight of his cock, the heat of it, trapped between them.
The pageantry of it, the wild thrill of it all, reminds him of one of Tony’s galas. After dinner, at that point in the night when the booze was flowing freely and the men would leave their jackets and the women would quietly slide their shoes under the table. This place is flashier than any of those places, this is lights and sweat and living and those places were gilt and repressed and judgment. This place is dark and wild and
“Mm,” Steve says, and fishes out the fun part of the jock. “That’s too bad.” He presses his face into Tony’s fragrant hair so he can whisper. “If only you had a benevolent keeper.”
Tony still sees space racing out in front of him every time he closes his eyes. He wanted that light – blinding, impossible - to be Steve. Even now he wants Steve to be saving him.
He's too weak to do anything about it, so he lies there and feels the soft puff of the cannula taped to his face and tries to relinquish some of his lonely terror.
He melts into it. He lets Steve support him, like he can’t bear to be awake for another minute, like his limbs are made of lead. He clings like if he lets go of Steve he’ll lose his tether on reality.
Tony tries to flex his fingers, but his body is several inches left of where he thinks it is and the pain drops him back with an agonized scream. He feels like his brain is stuffed full of cotton. Like the world is a distant spinning galaxy and he is far into the stratosphere. Like he is watching himself fail.
He’s had so many chances, Steve thinks, as he rolls Tony’s sac around in his palm, as he licks his way up to the head of Tony’s cock. He hasn’t been inside Tony for weeks. Months. The most they do is roll themselves together, if Tony is feeling up to it, if Tony can get over his issues long enough to hike up his shirt. No more fucking Tony on his hands and knees or over the counter or up against the wall, no more physical resolutions to their altercations.
Except it isn’t SHIELD, it’s Happy, Happy sounding like he’s shouting into the receiver, and then Rhodey with a give me that and speaking in that voice he reserves for his men, and for Tony when Tony has done something unforgivable.
Tony thinks he's crying. His temporomandibular joint feels like it's going to rupture. Like his teeth are going to crack. He has no idea how he's not biting Steve - maybe he is, maybe Steve doesn't care. Steve strokes his throat, drives himself in deeper, and Tony is forced to swallow and swallow and swallow. He doesn't - they've never done this, he's going to break his jaw, he's going to break his jaw and Bruce is so far away and Bruce is maybe dead and Steve is -
Steve pulls his mangled leg out from under him and Tony bashes his head into the floor trying to overcome the pain.
“Make it stop,” Steve moans. He’s bleeding on this nice man’s shirt. Something is lost on him. He thinks he’s having a stroke. He feels like he’s done something bad. Something wrong.
He thinks that maybe Leonard is right. That maybe it’s not a problem with Extremis. That maybe he is just a useless, broken man.
Liar, Nat tells him. Wheels up in 10. You've never been a coward a day in your life, Steve. The air behind her smells like dahlias.
“But you don’t actually want me to romance you, do you,” he says, extends one leather shoe to toe at Steve’s balls. “You want to be my filthy little secret. You want me to pull your hair and tell you you look like something I could sell to Playgirl.”
There was a golden age, he thinks, when he really, honestly believed he was bulletproof. That no matter how bad it got, no matter how many nights he spent drinking himself to sleep, no matter how many close calls when his heart was in shreds in his chest, he couldn’t picture it. The nightmares were about everyone else: Pepper, Happy, Steve. Bethany. Rumiko.
Hallucination dances across Tony’s mind, and Janet keeps talking. Thor laughs, and Thor’s deep booming voice puts fear in him, now, and Steve’s eyes are darting around like he’s terrified and he opens his mouth and Tony shouldn’t be able to hear him through the ice but Extremis picks his scream up because Tony is in hell and the decibel count goes up and up in the HUD –
“I’m waiting for someone,” Steve lies. He blows a cloud of smoke into the air and wishes the nicotine did something for him.
He holds Steve, cradles the back of his neck when he could be holding the lead – he wants this to be personal, wants it to sting. Tony moans, tips his head forward, drips sweat into Steve’s hair. He drags his cock out of Steve’s throat and snaps back in, murmurs incomprehensible things while Steve’s vision fills up with static. Steve can’t grab him, can’t push back, he’s bound and stiff and open, he’s here until Tony wants to be done with him.
She smiles a sad smile. “This is it. He needs the transplant, he’s not in a good place for eligibility unless you can get him to go through with the apheresis. Not unless you have a clone up your sleeve,” the doctor says. She stands on her toes to pat him on the shoulder.
Steve smiles something pinched and forced, throws his arms wide. “Does it look like Sharon’s here, Tony?”
Steve's on hold with someone. He tucks his phone between his ear and his shoulder and sits on the edge of the bed and traces Tony's lips with one of his massive fingers. Slides the tip into Tony's mouth.
Steve stands. Undoes his belt. Deliberately leaves his fly for Tony’s clever mouth. “In a minute,” he says. “I think you have a debt of gratitude to settle, first.”
Steve would talk about the cold, the smell of smoke. The way the buildings were run through with jagged wounds, the way their windows had fallen out like missing teeth. The brilliant color of the sky once the fires went out. The way you knew you were riding the edge of a wave, that just a few miles away the Germans were still dug in.
“’Don’t ruin this?’” Steve fires back, digs his fingers into Tony’s hips before he remembers he can’t do that because he’s going to bruise. “Can you understand why it might be concerning to hear that while we’re doing this?”
Steve lies behind him; he's already taken that liberty. The room is dark. The beeping of the heart monitor and the tubing running from his elbow and the hot mass of Steve's bulk on his scant nothing is enough to make him feel like he's suffocating.
You can't lie to me, Steve says, and he looks mad with it. He taps his temple like it's gone insane. I can feel how fucking scared you are, Steve says. And you're scared of me. And I have to listen to you and you tell me something and the bond tells me something else, who am I supposed to listen to, Tony -
“Don’t swallow,” Tony pants, and his the tip of his cock is finally resting in Steve’s mouth and Steve wraps his tongue around him and shudders. Tony comes like he hasn’t had an orgasm in weeks, spurt after spurt after spurt. Steve’s mouth fills up but he doesn’t dare disobey. Some of it is leaking out the side of his mouth, it’s too much, it’s exquisite, he feels like a filthy secret and a personal slave and it’s the furthest thing from Captain America he can possibly imagine.
, Steve wants to say, he wants Tony to completely fucking ignore him, he wants to feel like the hole Tony is trying to use him as, he wants to come out of this hollowed out, empty, a vessel.
The grapevine is a priority mail envelope, because all the kids left in the fucking divorce so there’s no one except Deadpool to actually bring him gossip anymore. The envelope contains the deed to Avengers Mansion and a form letter that Tony didn’t even sign himself. Steve stands there with the paper in his hand, shaking, reading and re-reading the last line:
“Tony,” Steve hears himself say. Tony had a heart attack, he’d thought this was over, he’d thought that this was a thing he didn’t have to constantly worry about anymore, the chest plate is gone, god, if he has to go back into it Steve thinks he’s going to die –
The door bangs open behind them and a group of shirtless men filter out, laughing and touching and smiling. They make their way around to the sidewalk as if Steve’s entire world isn’t falling apart right here, right now. Steve ducks his head, pretends he’s looking past the dumpster and not thinking about diving into it.
She fears him. He exists above her; he looks evil. All the gold paint in the world can’t make that right.
Mystery Man shudders and his back muscles move beneath Tony’s hand. Tony’s pants grow tighter, still. He smells like Barbasol. A well-respected man. Tony wants to disrespect him.
“Leave it,” Tony says, the first thing he’s said in a while. He’s panting, his head bumping against the armrest as Steve thrusts into him, his hand loose around his cock.
He can feel it, every time Tony punches past his gag reflex, the tickle, the burning sensation when Tony slides down his throat.  Sometimes he stays there, and Steve can feel his distended throat pressing against the collar, it’s so deliriously good, he’s not getting enough oxygen but he wishes he were getting less, he wishes it were Tony’s hands and not the fucking collar –
He cries. He sees Nebula's dark eyes and feels her prosthetic arm on his spindly wrist and he is dimly aware that his chest feels hollow.
He's dizzy almost immediately. He chokes, because he's not ready, he's not fit for this, and Steve doesn't even let up for a moment, not for recovery, not for Tony's comfort. Tony's head knocks against the tile and it hurts but everything hurts, he just has to trust that Steve will know if he has a concussion, Steve is in control even at his worst - but he's not, he knows that now, sometimes he's not in control, sometimes he's out for blood, sometimes he is unrefined savagery and he's done it to Tony once so what's to say he won't do it again and -
“What a concept,” Steve says, and Tony grits his teeth. “How does accountability feel, Tony?” He stalks across the cargo area, proud and tall and pale as death.
The pain lasts longer, this time. Steve’s crying. He doesn’t understand what’s going on; he doesn’t live this life anymore. He wants peace.
“I think this is between you and Tony,” he keeps saying, but Tony won’t take the fucking phone call, so Commander Stark just stands there on the sat phone while his team waits, just looks at the useless piece of plastic in his hand.
Maria calls him at two. “We got it,” she tells him, the roar of a copter in the background. “Your portal thing.”
He doesn't voice his discomfort. Steve had him do miserable, halting laps earlier - with a plug, no less - dragging his IV tower along, Steve's big hand splayed across the small of his back, trying not to touch as if he hasn't funneled quarts of his own fluids into Tony's body. Now he is swollen and sore where Steve pushes into him every hour and a half, bruised around his glands, his nipples raw under his grey hospital gown.
Tony's hand goes to his chest, but the nanotech is gone. He slapped it into Steve's hand. He let it go.
Tony finds his eyes – bloodshot, but clear enough. Enough cylinders firing. He nods, once. He looks like he wants to die.
“Tony, it’s me,” he says softly, letting himself in through the thick oak door. He knows better than to slip in unannounced. He’d like to avoid panic, or flight today.
Steve sits back on his heels and learns what it’s like to be the source of all misery in the universe.
It's intentionally cruel. It topples every single fantasy Tony has cultivated in his absence. Tony's eyes water with the pain of it. He looks for the affection in Steve's face and Steve looks wrong, as wrong as Tony has ever seen him.
Tony has been crying. His eyes are puffy and his hair is peroxide yellow and his chin is covered in day-old stubble. He’s wearing sweatpants with his wallet jammed in the waistband. He’s clutching a meaty file folder to his chest.
There's another alpha who touches him, who he's handed off to. He doesn't smell like anything. Tony feels nothing about him.
It’s fine, it has to be fine. Out of his mind, here and now, sweat and sex and this Adonis with the beautiful ass. Step, step, step, and the man dips him, twirls him. Tony is breathless and knows maybe it’s the coke, maybe he’s been pushing too hard lately, knows that his heart sometimes flips in his chest and it isn’t the romance, but this is so different from the colorless world he usually inhabits that he doesn’t even care. He would let this man dance him to death if it meant that he could keep feeling this way. The rev likes this man.
That feels wrong. He usually remembers everything. His memory is better than most, even for his age. The nightmares leave him with perfect clarity.
He should be able to get something from it. Anything. An impression, an ache, a sharp taste at the back of his throat.
Steve feels exposed, feels violent and blunt and ashamed of what he is, how he is when he comes here to rattle himself around until he feels like he can rejoin the living. He doesn’t expect visitors. Tony always blindsides him.
Steve tries very hard to go about his life, but the knowledge of how they have wounded each other and his impotent, useless anger follow him. His nightmares persist: sometimes Tony is erasing him, sometimes Tony is laughing. Sometimes Tony tells him he’s a fucking idiot and it was all a game. He was never needed.
A SHIELD agent is shepherding him through a wall of cameras. White gloves, black suit. Her weapon is holstered. They’re leading him to an ambulance. He tastes blood in his throat. His hands are shaking. His nose feels like it’s broken. He runs his tongue over his teeth: all in place, everything intact.
“You climbed into bed with all those well-dressed men in Washington, Stark,” Steve tells him, and Tony blinks and blinks and blinks and wonders what the fuck he did to earn this, sees what’s left of his life stretching out before him and in every scene, Steve is there, a vengeful ghost, a friend he’ll never earn back, a specter come to drive him into his own grave.
“I wrote them,” Steve tells him. “I think they’re mine.” He reads one, and Tony watches as his face starts to go hard.
Steve swears. “Don’t move,” he says, like Tony is going anywhere. He trots out to the kitchen, takes the kettle off the heat, and slams it down on an unused burner like it’s personally targeted him. He grabs Tony’s coffee, and digs around in the bag for an everything bagel – still warm, good. He snatches a blanket off the couch on his way back.
Steve looks as exhausted as Tony feels. He puts a pillow under Tony's hips, arranges his feet, gently massages his genitals like he's tempering Tony's body.
Steve is nowhere, and Tony looks at his ankle and reaches for Extremis and feels a terrible empty maelstrom where nonstop data was before and imagines the taste of liquor.
Steve’s good as his word. He undoes his tie while Tony watches, pulls it out, frees the first few buttons on his shirt. He slips down to his knees on the floor, bends to press an open-mouthed kiss to Tony’s neck, feels the flutter of his pulse under his tongue. Slides his broad hands down Tony’s sides – never his front, never his wretched chest or his stomach where the line emerges like some alien thing. He lets himself run his fingers through the wiry curls at the base of Tony’s cock, well shy of the wire where it dips down almost to his groin and curves up again.
I don't feel you, Tony croaks, and he shakes through it. Saying it aloud precipitates a fearful overturn in his otherwise inert body: shame and guilt and fear and over again.
, Tony would say, if they were back in the mansion and it were the light of day and they knew who they were, but this Tony has glazed eyes and enormous pupils and sways on his feet and traces the muscles in Steve’s neck with his fingertips.
Steve blinks. He sniffs, as surreptitiously as he’s able, but Tony just smells like stale sweat and tears and a tiny hint of copper where his bare feet have found the crystal shards all over the floor.
This dream isn’t new. Sometimes the color of the sky shifts from the red-grey of particulate and smog to a bright bright blue. Right now it’s the golden hour of dawn, and the wings on Steve’s cowl are backlit by a halo of fledgling sunlight.
Two precise little nicks on each leg, neater than they should be. One last push of the serum. The way Steve goes the extra mile. The way he always knows exactly how much force to exert.
“Where is this coming from,” Steve chokes out. “Do you,” and Steve can barely make himself say the words out loud. “Do you not want this? A relationship? With. Me?”
“No,” Tony says flatly. Tony’s not paying attention or maybe he doesn’t care, because he didn’t clench when Steve pulled out and there’s come all over the couch and he’s just laying there looking catatonic, indolent and half-hard and apathetic about the entire situation.
” Steve gasps, because Tony is three steps ahead of him and swings a leg over him and sinks down all in one fluid motion and it’s
He catches a glimpse of the red soaking through Steve’s uniform before someone is smashing his head into the floor.
Tony has positioned him, kneeling, on the rug with his knees and ankles spread wide, his hands caught at the small of his back. Tony’s added a wide leather collar today, hooked his head back with a lead that connects to the spreader bar keeping his ankles apart. It is his least favorite configuration to date. He can’t pull his head forward, can’t close his legs. He is open and sore and may as well be carved out of stone for all the attention Tony has given him.
He looks out into a sea of strangers. Whispers run through the crowd. The front few rows he roped off, just in case, are empty. They’re not here. They think he’d arrest them for coming to Steve’s funeral.
Steve covets it; it so rarely happens. Steve needs to know what nerve he’s hit. He wants to hit it repeatedly for the rest of their lives. He has half a mind to tell him: cancel everything and kneel there and don’t you dare move, I’m getting my sketchbook.
for this,” Tony shouts over him, with his snotty nose and his hands balled into fists. “Let me have this one fucking thing, Steve –”
Tony twists back in forth in front of the mirror, assessing. He presses the jock up to himself, traces the line of it where it would cut over his glutes. It’s very clearly a piece meant to contain, even though it’s made of the softest leather and overlaid with a heavy dark blue Chantilly lace.
This is better than the waitress. He can’t remember her name and it was three days ago, but he’s going to remember this. He’s going to turn this over and over in his mind’s eye for months. Steve should say something responsible, VD – that’s still a thing, probably, and he doesn’t have a rubber, but he’s not the one at risk here, and all his accountability drains right into his genitals as this man slides to his knees in a beautiful controlled collapse.
Tony is pressing the flat of his palm to his length, grimacing, glancing at Steve in the mirror with a look that says he is running simulations. He is gauging how far to push, how far he wants to be pushed, how far he wants Steve to take him.
Tony’s eyes glimmer. “I anticipate your needs,” he says. "I anticipated you might need to be reminded of the situation between us." He tangles his fingers in Steve’s pubes, traces the base of his very-hard cock with deft fingers, fondles him. Takes some of his own wetness and brings it to his mouth, rubs it on his lips. Lets Steve suck it off his fingers.
Steve slams the coffeepot on the counter just hard enough for a spider web crack to sneak up the side of the carafe.
He feels his blood pumping in his ears, tries and fails to bring his hands up to cover his head, gets a boot to the side of his head and a ring springs up and drowns everything out.
Tony meets his eyes. “Yes,” Tony says, his cheeks aflame, his voice low and deliberate. “I’d be happy to wear it all day, Commander,” he tells Steve.
Tony had plans for this. Angry speeches. Contrition. Non-engagement. Murder. Begging. Lies and fucking and destructive honesty and all of it to compensate for the fact that Tony is weak and Tony was always going to beg to keep the bond.
not realize), and palms him. Steve can’t stop the gasp from leaving his mouth - he’s still so sensitive, it’s so wrong, it’s so dishonest – and that’s when Tony leans forward and presses their lips together.
“I just wish I’d known it was you,” Tony says, drained and completely without guile. He looks Steve in the eye. “I don’t regret it.”
He tries to imagine Tony is in his armor, that they’re somewhere else in a better time. Tony’s kiss is so gentle, so tentative, so different than Steve imagined. Tony kisses like it’s the last one he’ll ever get. He nips a little, nibbles at Steve’s bottom lip, soothes the edge of it away with his tongue. He tastes like Steve’s come and the martini he was drinking and the pit in Steve’s stomach widens and –
Steve ends up down at street level because he sees a flash of red and shining gold and his heart leaps in his chest.
Steve leaves him to his own devices, mostly, sneaks away to Howard’s office to plan his search for the New Team. (“We need some old friends,” Tony had said, looking utterly defeated, before Osborn had even shown up, before they’d even been back to visit the rubble of the tower.) It’s partly self-serving, he knows, but he doesn’t want Tony to stumble onto a half-composed roster. Not now, it’s been barely six weeks since they dusted the rubble off their boots and retreated here to haunt the place and it still feels like they’re squatting.
The clouds are breaking up. Steve can almost see the stars. “You didn’t need me,” he says. “I was bad press, Tony, I didn’t – you know how I felt at the end of it. I couldn’t wear the flag on my chest like that, not in good conscience–”
Tony stands there shifting his weight. His heart sounds fluttery. Steve aches to tell him. It’s the right thing to do; it’s what Captain America would do.
Tony kisses the nape of his neck, puts the remote for the vibrator in Steve’s hand, edges Steve’s thumb onto the button. He won’t turn it off, they both know it. Tony puts one broad hand on Steve’s hip and Steve is dimly aware that he’s been thrusting at nothing; he feels sweat running down his back. The plug is too much and not enough, overwhelming sensation, barely enough volume to make him feel like he’s being manipulated for someone else’s leisure.
I called Helen, Steve tells him. She'll be here in the morning. I gave you more Percocet. I set your shoulder. He pauses. And your wrist. There's an ice pack for your collarbone. I put –
Under his phone is a plastic card, cracked down the middle. A tiny green light blinks in the corner.
She checks the collar that sits around Tony’s neck before they start. It's a better design than the anklet. Increased durability, adaptive materials. It can't be removed because it's wired into his brainstem.
The usher stares at his chest for a moment longer and takes in Steve, drawn up to his full height, and holds open the doors.
“It just buys me time,” Tony says, for the thousandth time. They’ve talked it to death, and the conversation always ends the same way, because Tony’s fire is slowly burning out. It’s too easy to capitulate.
Tony strokes a hand through his hair. “Last chance, Captain,” he says, and then it’s violent, then he’s pulling and Steve’s eyes are watering and he feels a fresh welter of precome sliding onto his thighs. “Tell me how you want to
Time isn’t elastic. Tony would argue, he would have some equation up his sleeve to prove it, but Steve felt it then, and he knows it now: their window has passed. The hurts have scabbed over. They’ve scarred. You don’t open old wounds, they’re just there. They persist. You have to look at them every day and maybe if you’re lucky you forget how they happened.
, Tony had said once, when Tony still said things like that and he had the lungs to double over in laughter or shout at Steve until he was hoarse.
Time contracts. Jen is herding him out of the room, into a hallway packed with reporters holding their phones out–
The screaming feels distant. Steve’s face looks softer. Kind, maybe, if Tony didn’t know better. The old anger is slipping from him. The disappointment in his eyes is a little harder to see.
He thinks it will make him feel better. He thinks of all the times he has used his body to soothe the ugly things that have always arisen between the two of them. He thinks of the most erotic things Steve has done to him. He thinks about Steve in rut. He thinks about the way Steve feels when he knots.
“It’s okay, you’re okay, it’s okay,” someone is saying. Steve looks up. A man, bright blue eyes, black hair. It's the face of a man who’s been condemned to a slow death. He’s crying but his face is set in something like grim acceptance.
A click, two, and Tony’s undone the spreader bar. Steve’s lead hangs loose down his back, but he can kick his legs out, he can curl over onto himself. Tony sits back and something is shoved between Steve’s legs, hot, solid –
Steve remembers the way they crowded around Tony’s bedside after Norman Osborn did everything but cave Tony’s skull in, how he had that tube in his mouth, how Steve thought
It feels like it’s never going to end. Steve feels like he’s going to die. His head is a nothing but agony. He’s vaguely aware of someone wedging something under his head, of the sensation of swallowing his own blood, of the blood rushing in his ears.
“Don’t waste any,” Tony says, and then he’s sliding out of Steve’s mouth and Steve wants to gasp and cry but he has to keep his mouth shut.
He opens a laptop and watches shiny new code scroll out on the screen. It’s just maintenance. He will find the bug; he will go through every line of his own coding. He will be unassailable. He will fix this.
Steve keeps trying. Keeps moving in him. Not yet, he says. He presses his cheek to Tony's, buries his head in Tony's pillow. Tangles his hands in the sheets so they're not touching more than they need to be.
“Where the fuck are you,” he barks into the speaker, because they’re over an hour late, no call-in, nothing.
Tony feels like his body is buzzing. Steve has solidified, somewhat. He stands in the corner while Tony endures a cavity search, while Tony holds his wrist out to be stamped with the sub dermal barcode they’d designed. He gives them his wallet with his pictures of Rumiko and that day the Avengers first saved the world.
Maria’s testimony is fair. She can’t stay; she comes in full uniform and shoots him a piteous smile as she walks out the door. Dugan spends his time deflecting and insisting that there’s no one better to manage the Initiative and Tony feels an intense surge of gratitude. Dugan owes him nothing. Both of their testimonies are professional courtesy. Neutral. Dispassionate.
Tony isn’t soft. He’s big, he’s heavy. Steve thinks maybe Tony could rough him around with his fancy new biotech. Tony has a way of moving that’s deliberate and restrained; subdued in a way that suggests violence may not be far behind, if requested.
“I’ll take myself off the team,” Tony offers. “Those were extraordinary circumstances, but I was a liability, I’ll be the first to admit it–”
“No,” Steve says, and it’s a lie, he has several things to be doing, but Tony needs him and Tony is so warm and he’s
Steve grabs Tony's wrist midair, slams Tony once, twice against the wall like he's a rag doll. Something pops in Tony's shoulder. He hears his wrist snap, feels his collarbone break under Steve's open palm.
Not Steve as Tony knew him, but Steve as Tony grew up with – leather jacket over burnished blue scale armor, his helmet painted differently, brown boots, brown pouches, blood on his knuckles and a split lip, his shield speckled with the ghosts of deflected bullets.
He wakes up with the gold on his skin, his body perfectly calibrated for restful sleep, and punches a hole in the wall. He looks at his hands and is both disturbed and mesmerized by his new strength.
He is able to tell Extremis to monitor his heart rate, because he remembers the first time something like this happened, remembers waking up with the lost time and a body count and stopping his heart to shut out the intruder for good. He can’t do that again, he can’t –
They ask Tony if he wants to make a closing statement, and Tony slips up, sees Steve sitting in the front row of the Assembly next to the Wakandan ambassador, and he presses his lips together and blinks his eyes and feels like his chest is collapsing and shakes his head.
Tony levers himself up, carefully. The pain shoots up his spine, and the monitor spikes momentarily. He fixes his IV. Looks at the list, changes the bag. Pushes himself pain meds. Takes his temperature - finally, no fever. Reaches behind him to feel at the little wet spot on his gown.
Tony looks, for just a moment, like he might cry, and then it passes. He does that thing to his face, sublimates, compresses, compartmentalizes. Steve has always envied it. He's never mastered it like Tony has.
Steve doesn’t know what makes him do it: he reaches up a shaking hand to touch the man’s beard. He traces a cheekbone with his fingers. He wipes at a tear inching down his nose.
“Look at his costume,” Tony hears, like someone is whispering in his ear, and sees something red and black flit across his vision.
The man laps at him even after he’s done, and it’s all Steve can do to hold himself up and not fall to his knees.
If that kid can walk around in his underwear, Steve can attract the right kind of attention. He slides onto the dance floor and takes his cigarette with him. Fake it til you make it. He thinks he heard that first from Tony, after he woke up. He thinks about the desperate, empty way Tony was starting to smile when Steve left. He runs a hand through his hair, puts his cigarette out on the bar. He’s build like a truck. They’ll look. He knows how some men pretend not to stare when he goes to the gym, knows what he’s wearing leaves little to the imagination.
There was a time he would have blamed this on Tony, but his anger has seeped out of him and he dwells in a haze of grief and gives orders and runs his team and wishes he could just walk away. His bitterness gets the better of him, sometimes. He snaps at people. He is becoming everything the Illuminati told him he was: intractable, archaic, willfully ignorant. Useless.
Steve holds him until the guards show up. “You don’t get to leave me alone,” Steve whispers fiercely. “You’re stuck with me.”
Tony shakes three of them into his hand. “I should have asked Janet to come,” he says. “I should have.” He chokes the rest of it off, because there are so many useless
Fabrication is slow in analog: he has to drag cables across the floor and rewires some of the lines because almost everything is off for the renovations. He has to pour the metal himself, has to crank a generator to life with his own two hands. He crushes his hand in a vise and dials 911 manually and lies on the floor curled up in pain and grunts into the mouthpiece.
Tony's fever has subsided into a low-grade nuisance, but it's the only concrete marker of improvement he's noticed. He listens to the air recirculating, watches Steve do laps through his little window out on the compound, watches him stop and pick up one of the sculptures on the lawn and hurl it into the lake.
Tony hates it. He puts up a good show for about a week and then he won’t take his shirt off anymore. He designs a special pouch that sits around his waist and hides the fact that his life is resting in a little box.
Tony swallows and swallows and swallows because Steve does not get another single ounce of his pain for self-flagellation.
He folds his ancient body into bed at night and sometimes he wakes up and smiles and murmurs good morning to someone who is not sleeping next to him, and then he remembers.
“You won’t,” Tony says, “feel,” and guides Steve’s hand with his own. To Steve’s utter shock, the blunt tip of Steve’s thumb slides right into Tony’s body, and there’s something warm and slick and it’s
Steve nudges his cock out of the way, presses his mouth to Tony’s balls, sucks one of them into his mouth. Tony’s breath hitches. He passes a hand through Steve’s hair.
