To everybody’s shock and horror, Cain yelled, “That’s bullshit! You were begging for it, you little slut!”
“He and his friends broke into their high school’s football field and spray painted, ‘Mr. Higgins’ who was the principal, ‘loves cock’ on the fifty-yard line.” Gabe doubled over in laughter at the memory.
Dean snuggled himself close to Cas’s side, “You’re an amazing father.”
“Thank you but I promised my sister she wouldn’t be alone for dinner tonight.”
He was laying on top of the covers with his legs obscenely spread when Dean walked into the room. When he turned on the light, Dean’s heart stopped in the best way possible, “Cas? What are you doing?”
Chuck shoved him again, harder this time and stumbled into the house without saying a word. Cas faithfully followed him and prayed that the night didn’t get worse.
Dean was greeted by Gabe and Anna walking in the front door on his way out. Anna quickly hugged Dean, “Hi, Dean!”
“Oh… yeah… sorry.” Dean’s blush grew as he willed his boner to go away.
One foot in front of the other his thoughts roamed from Naomi begging Chuck to stop beating her to the soggy weather to seeing Gabe again back to his father being in jail for the rest of his life for murder to… Dean’s eyes? Surprisingly, that’s what Cas got stuck on as he walked the streets of his childhood; Dean’s bright green eyes. The life in them, the hope, the courage, the strength, and what crushed Cas the most, the pain. The pain that plagued Dean’s eyes when he talked about his father’s death or his mother’s drinking. Cas wanted to take that pain away, to make it stop. He couldn’t though; he couldn’t try to take his pain away because he would eventually make it worse… he always does.
“God, I hate him so much.” Dean snarled, trying to push away his anger.
Dean scrubbed a hand over his face, “Nobody knows, he moved here half-way through Sophomore year. He is psychotic.”
He tried to be confident, hearing his usual supporters cheers. People collectively had bet over three hundred dollars on Cas.
“Sure thing. You have a nice day.”
Against all better judgment, Cas stripped off his t-shirt and laid down on his stomach. Dean’s brain shit itself. Cas had huge black wings tattooed across his shoulder blades that spread out down his back. Each individual feather was intricate and detailed. The dark feathers resembled Cas’s hair; dark, black and slightly rumpled. Dean didn’t even know he was staring until Cas cleared his throat, “Everything okay?”
For the rest of the week at school, Anna was glued to Charlie, Jo, Dean or Sam so it didn’t surprise Cas at all when Anna asked if Sam and Dean could hang out at their house Friday night. This had been a long, stressful week for Anna and Cas wanted her to be able to relax and have a fun night with one of her new friends so he gladly agreed to have them over.
By Annie’s reaction of cheers and running to go get her shoes on, both Cas and Dean could tell she was totally on board with that plan. Gabe grabbed his backpack and started out the front door calling over his shoulder, “Bye Cas! Bye Cas’s boyfriend!”
C: ‘Baby, Gabe is watching Annie tonight.’
He gently shook Anna and Sam’s shoulders, “Hey, guys. Sam, you and Dean are going to stay here tonight, okay?” He only got half-awake mumbles back, “Feel free to take Gabe’s bed. Anna can show you the bathroom.”
Mary was going to be in rehab for one month; while she was gone, Sam and Dean were going to stay with Ellen and Bobby most nights.
As promised, an agonizing half-hour later Cas came back into the room and Dean politely asked everybody to give them a minute. To Dean’s dismay, Cas didn’t immediately come over to hold his hand as he usually did. Instead, he nervously paced from the bed to the window. He sounded absolutely devastated, “Why didn’t you tell them?”
Cas slightly shook his head, knowing that they could see him no matter where he was.
They teased each other about cars and wardrobe choices, waiting for the first bell of the day until Alastair Stevens pulled up next to them in his disgusting monstrosity of a shit-brown colored pickup truck. Sticking his head out the window he sneered at them, “Hey, fags! Save it for hell, yeah?”
Charlie followed Cain’s dark figure across the city to a normal looking ranch house. It was a small white home with a well-groomed lawn and a fresh coat of paint on the shutters. But inside, a monster stood with blood splattered clothes and a cold look in his eye.
Realizing he was staring intently at the other boy's face, Dean quickly said, “I like your tattoos.”
Cas chimed up again, trying to distract both of them, “What’s your favorite hobby?”
Clearly, Dean was uncomfortable talking about his father so Cas didn’t push at the sudden change of topic, “Yeah, my partner and I got a call about an abandoned baby. When we got there she was left in a box under a bridge. She was only two-months-old. As I was taking her vitals, I fell in love with her. She fell asleep curled up in my arms and I knew I needed to protect her.”
A sweet voice on the other end started to speak calmly, “Hello, this is nurse Mosely calling from Lawrence Memorial Hospital. I have Anna and Castiel Novak here, Anna asked that we call you. Unfortunately, they were in a motorcycle accident tonight. We ask that you get to the hospital as soon as you can.”
Dean was still sitting on the edge of the bed, realizing now that Cas had managed to curl himself around Dean with his thighs against one of Dean’s and his head still snuggled into his pillow, “You miss her, huh?”
Luke flicked Cas’s ear, making him jump, “That dog has you whipped. You need to get laid.”
He didn’t mean to but Dean’s face expressed that he disapproved, “Oh, that’s nice.”
Growing tired, he flipped the pages of the book, searching for the right quote until he found it, “Once for all; I knew to my sorrow, often and often, if not always, that I loved her against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be.”
As soon as he got there, Dean bounded up the stairs and loudly knocked on the front door.
Dean’s eyes were full of shock and fear; he wanted to push Cas away, instead, he clung onto the front of his open leather jacket, “What the hell are you talking about?” Subconsciously, he pulled Cas even closer to his trembling body.
Cas placed his bag next to the couch, “It’s okay, Dean. Really, I don’t mind.”
Dean re-watched the footage a few times before scrubbing a hand over his face and sighing, “Alright, forward me and Novak the whole days’ worth of footage, we’ll comb through it.”
They had been together for two years the day they moved in together, Cas was twenty-seven and Dean was thirty. Cas, after going back to school for a bit, became a guidance counselor at the local public high school. All the kids are kind to him, mostly because Cas is awesome at his job but also because of his service dog who doubles as a therapy dog for the kids, and maybe because of his super-hot husband who brought him lunch sometimes.
Gabe was by his side in a second, “Shit, you okay?” Gabe’s strong hands heaved Cas to his feet and immediately started to try and stop the blood that was pouring out of Cas’s nose. Half carrying Cas inside, Gabe sat Cas down at the kitchen table while Alfie ran off to get a towel.
Cas ran a hand over the top Dean’s head, “Yeah… no, you’re not driving home like this. You’re staying, okay?”
Dean quickly took long steps towards Cas, he put a steadying hand on his trembling shoulder, “I’m so sorry. Go home, I’ll stay here and help Ellen. Text me if you need anything.”
“Fine, what’s yours?”
The next morning, Dean found the courage to do something he hadn’t done in far too long; he pulled the box Anna had given him out of the back of his closet. As he leaned against the side of his bed, he put the box next to him on the floor, taking a deep breath before opening it. Not being able to bring himself to look at the pictures, Dean only grabbed what he needed.
Dean led Cas over to a close bench, “So, how are you today?”
“Yeah, she’s doing better. The doctor said it was angina. Thank you for taking such good care of her.”
For the first time Dean’s known him, Cas raised his voice at him, “Go away!”
The next morning, Dean woke up with a familiar pain in his ass and an unfamiliar warmth next to him. Rolling over, he was greeted with Cas’s stunning body, “Holy shit, good morning to me.”
Gabe shook his head and led Cas to the living room, “No. You’re going to the couch, we are keeping an eye on you today.”
They hadn’t touched each other since they got back together and now, two weeks after they made up, both of them were aching for more.
Dean brooded at him, a scowl plastered on his face, “No.”
Cas moaned, “Oh my god. You stretched yourself out for me, didn’t you?” The pressure against his cock was becoming too much so Cas quickly took off his pants and held his arms out, inviting Dean in.
The older man was thankfully still very strong from working in the shop and easily lifted Cas up and carried him to his truck. Bobby knew he needed to get Cas out of the December air. He didn’t know what happened to Cas, he just knew that being outside in the frigid winter for too long wasn’t good for anyone.
Cas was slightly surprised at the sudden affection but he didn’t hesitate to wrap his arms around Dean’s shaking shoulders, “Okay, I got you. Come on, let’s get you inside.” Keeping a protective arm around Dean, the two walked through the hospital until they found a quiet waiting room to sit in.
Cas could see the multi-colored leaves fall to the ground, the different shades of orange and yellow littering his small front lawn. Looking at his right wrist, his black watch read: 7:10. It was getting late so Cas called down the hallway, “Honey, do you have your shoes on?”
Cas kissed Dean’s perfect lips one more time before answering, “Of course I will, baby. Lay down for me.” As Cas stripped off Dean’s shirt, he placed slow kisses over his lightly freckled-covered chest, “Fuck…you’re so perfect.”
As promised, Dean knock’s on their front door a few minutes after six. To his dismay, it is Alfie who opened the door. Quickly recovering, Dean smiled, “Hey… Alfie, right?”
Dean moaned at held onto Cas’s arm, “Please, touch me. Fuck… please.”
By the time the pizza got delivered and they had eaten, it was getting late but Cas couldn’t just let the vibes he was getting from Dean go, he needed to do something about it before they both went insane. He waved his hand back towards his room, motioning for Dean to follow him, “Come here a second.”
Bobby came into the room a few minutes after the doctor told him the news. He pulled Dean close against his body, rocking the sobbing boy, trying desperately to calm him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean gave his little brother a high-five before ruffling his shaggy hair, “One, good job. Two, you’ll have to ask Cas if it’s okay.” Dean had started to get an idea of what Cas was like and he knew that Cas would want to know about this before Dean says anything for sure.
C: ‘Talk soon.’
When he was back in the safety of his room, Dean opened the box and didn’t bother trying to hold back his tears. The first thing Dean saw was Cas’s old, well-used copy of “Great Expectations”. Dean cradled the delicate pages in his fingers before gently placing the book on his bed. When his fingers wrapped around the smooth black leather of Cas’s jacket, Dean couldn’t help but smile at the memories they shared together. Inside the jacket, Anna had tucked a delicate flower crown made of white, green, and blue flowers. Dean's mind couldn't help but think of the future they wouldn't have together.
Again, and again and again, Cas’s fists slammed into his wall until he was leaving smears of blood on the white walls.
That’s when Dean saw Cas’s back. The messy patchwork of purple, green, and yellow littered his back as evidence of long nights and bitter fights; along with horrible raised streaks, some new and bright red and others a fading white, they looked like harsh belt marks. It took Dean a minute to find his breath to be able to talk, “Cas… what—”
They got dressed in a comfortable silence and Cas out on Abby’s harness before sneaking past Gabe and company. At the front door, Dean sweetly kissed Cas, “I had an awesome time with you.”
Gabe finished moving the last box into the guest room, now Cas’s bedroom, before walking back out to the kitchen, “Don’t you worry about my little brother’s ass. We are going on the prowl for dick.”
Back in the Impala, Sam and Dean dropped Anna off at home. Before she left, she smiled at the two boys, “Thank you guys for letting me come with you today, I had a lot of fun.” Dean smiled at her in the back seat, “Anytime. You sure you’ll be okay alone until Cas comes home?”
C: ‘Guess so. Text me for a reason?’
Dean closed his laptop and cleared a spot on his desk so Sam could put his stuff down, “Yeah, he’s um… actually at my house now.”
The slow drag of Cas’s hard cock pushing completely into Dean’s needy hole was like heaven. Dean’s hand grabbed onto Cas’s back trying to hold him as close as he could.
Cas nudged Gabe’s shoulder, “Ah… Mike. Didn’t miss that dickhead. Alright, don’t work yourself to death. I got to get some sleep.”
Surprisingly, Annie seemed completely unfazed by her teacher and her father screaming and Dean found out why when he pulled her aside after school to try to explain, “I just want to apologize for getting into an argument with your father.”
Cas started laughing, “Hey, baby?”
Jo grabbed a menu for her, “Pick anything, it’s all good here.”
Dean panicked, he had no idea that it was supposed to be a secret, “Anna mentioned it at lunch.”
When they got back to Dean’s, they both got changed into pajamas and Cas decided to go lay down. Dean agreed that after the long day Cas had, a nap was probably a good idea. As much as Dean wanted to crawl into bed with Cas, he had some paperwork that needed to get done. Sitting at the kitchen table, Dean tried to focus on the facts of the case and not let his emotions cloud anything but writing ‘the victim’ didn’t seem right. Because Cas wasn’t ‘the victim’ he was the sleepy guy wrapped up in his bed. He was the guy who wormed his way into Dean’s heart and changed the way he saw things. He was the one who made waking up in the morning worth it.
The old man’s demeanor quickly changed, “Thank you, good job on her.” He turned to Dean, “You staying for dinner?”
I promise some good smut next chapter ;)
Dean’s head rested against the wall as Cas pounded into him, filthy words slipping out of his mouth, “You’re such a good little cock slut for me, around you? You’ll take exactly what I give you. So needy, so tight. Tell me, baby, you going to cum? I want to see you cum untouched. Be a good boy for me.”
Dean answered the same way he always does, “I don’t like to talk about it.”
They carefully walked around downtown Lawrence, the early autumn sun shone down on them and even though Cas couldn’t see what was around him, he could feel the warm sun on his skin, he could smell the crisp air, and hear the stranger’s kind voices around him saying hello to Gabe and introducing themselves to Cas.
Crowley didn’t seem like he was expecting that, if anything he was inconvenienced by Cain’s outburst, “Your honor, I’d like to request a recess for the day. I have no further questions for this witness.”
Even Dean had to laugh at that. Sarcastically but jokingly, Dean rolled his eyes, “You’re hilarious."
Dean knew he wasn’t winning this battle, “Alright, fine. Come on, I’ll take you to go get your car.”
Cas soon found out what Dean had in mind when they got back to the station and had a meeting with Jody Mills, the local D.A, Sam, Charlie, Kevin, and Bobby. They all decided on setting a trap and the for the bait?... Cas.
Feeling down his boyfriend’s legs for any injuries Cas hushed Dean, “I’ll buy you some more.” Once he reached his right ankle the swelling and color of it signified an obvious issue, “I think it’s fractured. We’ll get you an x-ray.” After putting a splint on Dean’s ankle, Cas covered him with a blanket, realizing that his boyfriend was pretty much naked, other than his boxers.
And then Chuck smacked Cas and every rational thought flew out of Dean’s mind. Taking Cas from around his waist, he moved him behind his back so he was standing between Cas and his father. Dean spoke evenly but full of anger, “Cas, go pack a bag. You’re staying with me.”
Cas ignored his father but Dean couldn’t, “Leave him alone.”
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
After a few slow experimental thrusts, Cas wrapped his slim legs around Dean’s waist and encouraged Dean to fuck him harder.
The brothers waited on the hood of the Impala for Cas and Anna to walk out, when they finally did walk towards Cas’s Harley, Sam bounced up to them, “Hey, guys! We were just wondering if you wanted to go to the Roadhouse with us to grab some lunch?”
“There it is! I promise everything will be okay.”
Just as they did every night they spent together, Dean held Cas and Cas held Abby as they drifted off to sleep. It wasn’t until two in the morning when Abby’s loud barking jolted Dean out of his sleep. He sleepily nudged Cas, who he had turned away from in his sleep, “Abby’s barking.”
Over the next month, Dean and Cas hung out more and more; starting to build a real relationship over dinner dates and long phone calls. One day, Cas texted Dean during the day;
Cas said nothing in reply and turned back to the stove. When he turned around to grab a plate, Cas didn’t realize that Chuck was standing directly behind him. Cas ran into his father, sending his loosely-held glass on whiskey crashing onto the tile floor.
Cas tightly squeezed Dean’s hand, his heartbreaking for the man in front of him, “You have every reason in the world to be scared. I just want you to know that I would never mean to hurt you.”
Chuck told her to go to her room, Anna started to cry, he stood up and grabbed her arm, she pushed him off, Chuck slapped her, Cas saw red.
That night, Dean sent Cas a text at seven o’clock.
Cas felt nothing but sharp, debilitating pain as Cain forced himself into Cas. Cain pinned Cas down and roughly fucked him. Everything was a blur or pain; unable to see through his tears or a red film over his eyes. Blood. His blood. Bleeding. He’s alive. Stay alive.
Dean wrapped his legs around Cas’s waist and let his head fall forward onto Cas’s strong shoulder. When Cas slammed Dean’s back up against the wall and smoothly slid into his needy heat, Dean bit down hard on Cas’s shoulder; muffling the moan that ripped through him.
“I do, would you like to call him with my phone?” Cas pulled out his cell phone as an offer which Mary happily accepted.
Dean snuggled against Cas’s side, “That was nice. Missed you.”
The warm summer air was still and dry as Dean approached the upright grey headstone with Castiel’s name and angel wings engraved on it. Dean managed a weak smile as he sat facing the grave. Holding the red and black flannel close, Dean started to read the book he had read a million times.
That afternoon in the parking lot, Dean, Charlie, Jo, and Sam made plans to go to the Roadhouse after school. The Roadhouse was a small diner owned by Ellen Harvelle and Bobby Singer, Jo’s parents; it served as the friend’s usual hangout.
And that was it for Mary, “OH! My baby’s getting married!”
After they ate and started to drive home, Cas noticed Dean getting antsy, “You okay, baby?”
Dean grabbed the lube and slicked himself up before wrapping one of his arms securely around Cas’s lower back and using the other hand to hold himself up. It took every ounce of self-control Dean had to go slow as he pushed into Cas. He couldn’t help the groan that escaped him, feeling the warmth squeeze around him. Once he was fully inside Cas, he looked at his beautiful face, “You okay?” Dean started to panic when he didn’t get an answer so he made sure Cas made eye contact with him, “Sweetheart, you still with me?”
Chuck snarled back, “You want him? Go ahead, have him. I don’t want him.”
She stood up to go retrieve the dusty old albums, “I think we can arrange that.” When she came back with the
They were half-way through their drinks when Cas groaned, “Gabe… can we go home?”
Dean wrapped both of them up in his arms, “Even all the way in San Diego, you’ll always be our little girl. Don’t you forget that.”
Cas hesitated after being interrupted but hugged Dean back, “Is everything okay?”
They were lazily kissing each other when Dean whispered, “Cas, will you fuck me?”
Charlie watched their exchange with wide eyes, maybe things between them were worse than she thought.
Cas’s sobs were heart-wrenching and it was clear nobody wanted to hear more, even though they needed to. It was Sam who said what everyone was thinking, “Let’s take a break, okay?”
After getting a bottle of water, Dean walked back past Cas and saw, even threw in dark, that he was shaking, “Alright, come with me.”
Cas smirked at him and wrapped his hands around Dean’s waist, manhandling him onto his hands and knees.
Dean heavily sighed, relief flooding through him, “You need to tell me what’s going on with you. All I want is to help you.”
Now that they’re closer, Dean can easily see the angry bruises on Cas’s otherwise fair skin. The swollen red, purple, and sickly yellow bruise stretched from his left jaw up to his eye and across to his nose. It looked painful and as much as Dean was curious as to how it happened, he decided not to ask. Instead, he thought to himself,
“Oh my god! That was terrifying.” They finished getting dressed, both in a white shirt and a black suit. Dean was wearing a tie that was the same color green as the bridesmaid dresses while Cas had on a baby blue tie that Dean helped him pick out. Although the looks they were giving each other on the ride to the nice hotel, it was questionable whether or not the suits were going to stay on the whole time.
Even though Cas wanted to jump at the offer, he manners told him otherwise, “I wouldn’t want to impose.”
Cas sighed and poured the cooked eggs onto a plate, “We just got into a fight. I just need to let him calm down then we’ll talk. Will you go wake up the princess?”
Cas snapped his head up, his whole body stiffening, “I do not need help.”
What the dispatcher said back to him, Benny doesn’t remember. All he could focus on was holding pressure on Dean’s calf where the bullet entered. He tried to shake Dean’s shoulder to wake him up and eventually Dean’s green eyes opened as he groaned and tried to sit up, “Oh, fuck! Benny? …Benny! Tell me you got the little fuck.”
Dean crawled back into bed after closing the sliding door and wrapped an arm around Cas’s waist, pulling Cas back against his chest, “Sweet dreams, Cas… I love you.”
Bobby smiled at Cas, “Maybe be honest with him. Tell him what’s going on and why you did the things you did… anyway, it’s getting late. I have my truck, we can but your bike in the back.”
When his father gets home at three, Cas finally manages to get a couple hours of sleep before his alarm blares at six.
It didn’t take him long to find it; quickly pulling up to it, he turned off his bike and waited for Dean to pull off the helmet and get off before he did. Dean gave Cas a questioning look, “You didn’t take me out here to kill me, right?”
“Awe! Cassie, you look so nice!” She fussed with his black suit jacket and the white collar of his dress shirt.
The same woman Cas asked turned around with a horrified look on her face, “That’s horrible!”
Under Gabe’s stare, Dean uncomfortably shifted on his feet, “He texted me and he was drunk and I just wanted to check on him and—.”
What Charlie didn’t know was Alastair was lurking behind them and he heard every word. A sick smirk spread over his skeletal face and a devilish plan forming in his brain.
Cas took a long drink of his beer, “Long but you know how it goes. How’s the business doing?”
Dean quickly drove off towards Perry, “Where to?”
It was approaching one in the morning when Dean drove back to the hospital, his blood still quickly pumped adrenaline through him. When he got there and approached the front desk, he was greeted by a very tired looking nurse, “Excuse me, I’m looking for Castiel Novak.”
Cas scrambled to get away from Dean and ended up on the floor. He curled his legs up close to his chest and hid in the corner.
Just as a quick review: Cas and Anna left Seattle because their dad was abusive (He ended up killing their mother).
When he called the next day, Cas was praying that Dean would even answer. Thankfully he did but Dean didn’t sound too happy about Cas calling. He answered the phone and definitely didn’t sound happy, “What?”
Cas’s surgery was scheduled for three days later; the doctors wanted to remove it as soon as possible because it was clearly a fast-growing tumor.
Breathlessly Cas answered, “Bedside drawer.”
Cas’s eyes snapped up to meet Dean’s, “Dean? Are you alright?”
Gabe matched Cas’s aggressive tone, “You had a fucking Pilocytic Astrocytoma. I watched you lose your vision. I sat by your bedside after your surgery. I was there for all of it!”
In his panic and quick movements, Dean succeeded in scaring off the coyote which made Cas pout and wiggle out of Dean’s arms, “You scared it away!”
Now that he was closer, Sam noticed the small, delicate, white flower crown perched on top of her head, “So, are you new here?”
Sam looked up from his sandwich and with his mouth half-full, skeptically asked Dean, “You did go and get him, right? Or at least call somebody?”
Dean stopped and apologetically winced, “Sorry… I just haven’t seen Sammy in three years. What if he’s not the same? I’m not the same.”
“Dean?"
Instead, one of the faceless cops answered, “They were driving down I-70 when a driver who was drunk slammed into them, sending the bike into the concrete barrier.”
After checking that Annie was wrapped up in the movie, Dean quickly kissed Cas’s cheek. Cas turned back to him with a lust-drunk smile on his face and snuck another quick kiss, bumping his nose against Dean’s but turning back to the T.V before Annie noticed her father kissing her teacher; they weren’t trying to hide their new feelings but they also didn’t want to make Annie uncomfortable.
Cas took a deep breath and let himself relax against Dean, “When we were in the subway, he grabbed my arm and pulled me into an empty hall. He held a knife up to my throat and told me to beg for my life and I didn’t. So, he pulled out a gun and made me walk to the factory. He… stabbed me and kept cutting until I did beg him to stop. He put the knife to my throat and I thought he was going to kill me but he…” Cas’s sobs ripped through his body as he shook, his tears streamed down his cheeks and neck.
Not pushing anymore, Dean dropped the conversation but not before trying to get Cas to smile, “I get it. If you need somebody to get a beer with, I’m around.”
Gabe’s stress levels continued to rise, “Cas, this is the second day in a week you’ve either passed out or almost passed out. What is going on with you?”
Cas grabbed Dean’s sweatshirt and pulled him into a loving kiss, needing to feel Dean the way Dean can look at him. They held each other close and showed their love the way that was just theirs.
Dean’s face went bright red as he rubbed the back of his neck. The smile Cas gave him was as bright as the sun, “You tried to shake my hand, didn’t you?”
Dean looked just as confused, “We had plans… we made them this morning?”
After Cas stopped talking, Abby started to whimper and pace, only making Gabe more anxious, “What’s going on?”
Dean almost couldn’t answer he was so worn out, “Yes… yes. God, that was… amazing.”
Dean grabbed the Impala’s keys before slinging Cas’s backpack over his shoulder, “Yeah… no. I’m giving you a ride.”
Obviously agreeing, Cas reluctantly walked back out to the ambulance knowing Dean was in good hands.
“Cassie! You need any help?” Gabriel called out to his younger brother who had just walked into the house carrying a cardboard box.
Annie’s bath and the rest of her bedtime routine went smoothly. For the first time, Dean tucked Annie in all by himself. Feeling like it wouldn’t be weird, he snuggly wrapped her blanket around her and whispered, “It’s bedtime for little girls.” Before kissing her head and turning out the light, still leaving her door cracked after he left.
D: ‘Hey, Cas. Just checking in, how are you doing?”
Cas felt a large hand wrap around his bicep and harshly pull him behind the booth, the suspect's hand flew over his mouth before Cas could scream or say anything.
When the movie was over and they were walking back to the Impala, Alastair, Crowley, and Zach walked past them in the parking lot. Alastair stalked up to Anna and brushed his fingers down the goosebumps on her arm, “My, my look who it is… my little Anna.”
These are the five times Cas wished with his whole heart he could see and the one time he didn’t need to.
Dean waved him off but had to remind himself that Cas couldn’t see the gesture so he cleared his throat and tried again, “No problem. You feeling alright?”
Right now though, neither of them were thinking about anything negative. Cas whined and clung to the sheets, “Dean… please, I need to cum. I need…”
Cas’s blue eyes stayed trained on Dean’s face, trying to comprehend how he’s changed but still, he said, “You’re just as beautiful as I remember.”
And they stayed there, in their own personal heaven until the day Cas woke up from the same nap as usual only this time, Dean wasn’t curled up with him. He was alone. Terrifyingly, desperately, and hopelessly alone, “Baby?”
After being seated and ordering, Mary cleared her throat, “So Cas… tell us a bit about yourself?”
Mr. Winchester was leaning against his wooden desk, chatting with the few students already in their seats. When he saw Cas and Annie standing in the door, he warmly smiled at them, trying to ignore how attractive Cas was, “Hey there! I knew I had a new student coming!” He walked over and gently shook her small hand, “You must be Annie.”
Cas leaned on the window sill, his shoulders shaking as he silently sobbed, “I thought I lost you. I need you to listen to me—” When Cas turned around to look at Dean, Dean’s heart shattered, “— I love you. Not just right now, not because I need you, not because you saved me but because I love you. I’m not going anywhere. You don’t have to be scared that things will change. I need you to not be embarrassed by me or scared of losing me and I need you to be fucking careful because I swear to god if you get shot again, I’ll finish the job myself.”
Dean walked up to him and tapped his shoulder with the back of his hand, “Get up, Novak. We got shit to do.”
Dean could barely get his answer out through Cas’s thrust; all he could manage was a moan and an enthusiastic nod. With his partner’s confirmation, Cas started to fuck Dean harder. The white-hot heat of Dean was overwhelming.
Cas hung onto Dean’s right thigh and snuggled against him, softly smiling, “You’re warm… comfy.”
Dean basically drags Cas to the Impala, “What were you fucking thinking?! Why would you take the subway this late at night?!”
Cas buried his face I Dean’s neck and sobbed, just wanting everything to stop. How much more could these tumors take from him?
Cain held a large, sharp, curved knife to Cas’s small throat. His blue-green eyes were full of thunder and hate. His grey beard and waved hair were trapped under the hood of his coat, “Beg for your life.” His voice was like a demon trapped in a man; anger and loathing seeped from him.
That’s when Bobby started the story, “Last summer, Charlie’s intern named Garth went to the morgue with Dean and he made a mistake—.”
After putting Annie to bed, Cas got Dean comfortable in bed with a pillow under his ankle and about a million more around him, Dean finally gave him a fed up look, “Cas please, stop fussing. I’m okay.”
Cas let himself melt into Dean’s touch and finally crawl into the bed with him, holding his love close.
Charlie piped up from her chair, “No. We all talk about it… you don’t.”
Cas tried to stand but that plan was quickly destroyed with the intense head rush he got. Bracing himself on the table with shaky hands, he weakly nodded, “Yeah… I just—headache.”
But the protective EMT was having none of it, “Dean Winchester, so help me God, tell me what hurts or I’m going to lose it.”
The harsh crack of the judge’s gravel filled the air, “ORDER! Mr. Crowley, I strongly recommend you control your client!”
“She mentioned that a girl named Rebecca wasn’t being too kind to her.” Cas wasn’t trying to make trouble but nobody hurts his little girl.
Cas’s blush spread from his cheeks, down his next, and up his ears, “My first thought when I saw you was how much I wanted you.”
Listening to Cas, Dean scrambled onto all fours with his round ass facing Cas and pulled the thin fabric of his panties aside, revealing his slick and open hole. As seductively as he could, Dean slightly wiggled his ass and moaned, pushing a finger into himself, “Wanted to stretch myself out for you.”
“Yeah… she was the best.” Cas looked like he was on the verge of tears again. Thinking about his mother wasn’t something Cas did a lot. It was too hard to think about her dying alone in that empty, dark parking lot; “A robbery gone wrong” is what the police told them.
Fueled by pain, anger and the crowd's jeers, Cas shoved Donny off of him. They both scrambled to their feet and waited for the other to make the next move.
Still, by the front door, Cas grabbed his motorcycle keys and snaked a hand around Dean’s waist, “Let’s go for a ride.”
Cas took the shirt and thought it felt soft but there was one issue, “What does it look like?”
Cas bumped Dean’s hip with his, “I don’t know… ask Dean.”
As soon as Cas was gone, Sam slapped his older brother’s foot on his injured leg causing Dean to wake up and jump, cursing under his breath, “Ow! What the fuck?!”
Dean scoffed and happily walked over to where Annie was sitting with her stuffed bunny, zebra, and teddy bear, “Well, any good tea party needs a waiter.” As he went to go fill up her small plastic teapot with the iced tea in the fridge and try to find some proper tea-time snacks, Dean couldn’t help but smile at how sweet and innocent Annie is. That quickly changed when he remembered how her life started and the horrific scene Cas had to endure today; it made him hate the world and the people in it. However, when he walked back into Annie’s room, back into the small bubble of make-believe, Dean tried to forget about the bad in the world and focus on this moment of happiness.
“His CT scan confirmed a severe brain bleed and a fractured skull. Right now, he is in a coma and on life-support.”
C: ‘ ;)’
Unfortunately, Cas’s phone rang again. Groaning, he rolled over to answer it, “Hello?”
Dean, Sam, Charlie, Jo, and Anna chatted for a while about lots of different things; the school, what to do around town, classes, and funny stories. The conversation stayed light and happy until two hours had passed. As they got up to leave, Anna pulled out a ten-dollar bill from her small white wallet.
Charlie beamed with pride when she talked about Dean’s intern, “It was Cas, he found something on our suspect. He called every tattoo parlor in the area and after asking around, he found the artist that tattooed our suspect. Some guy named Zeke, he owns a shop on thirty-second street.”
Dean got into a fighting stance and tried to sound intimidating, “Castiel Novak, if you touch me with that fucking reptile, I swear to God I will leave you out here!”
Anna looked up at Cas with hopeful eyes, “Please, Cassie!”
Alfie quickly closed the door and walked back out into the kitchen, “Um… Gabe? Cas is naked in bed with Dean Winchester.”
Gabe’s demeanor changed into a look of acceptance and forgiveness, “Not me you should apologize to. Look, I know Cas can be a little bit of a doof but he’s a good guy.”
When Dean didn’t say goodnight to her as well, Cas gently nudged Dean with his elbow. Affectionately rolling his eyes, Dean sighed, “Goodnight, Abby.” Cas happily hummed in response and fell asleep with a smile on his face.
After doing a few loops of neighboring towns and spending almost two hours quietly riding together, Dean pointed towards the Roadhouse when they got back to Lawrence. When they got to the diner, Dean ran inside to grab two cheeseburgers while Cas parked his bike.
“Of course, sweetheart.” Dean took a second to apply more lube to a second finger before working it into Cas and very slowly working him open. Much to Dean’s relief, Cas moaned and spread his legs further. He wanted Cas to feel good; the last thing Dean wanted was for this to be a chore or unpleasant for his boyfriend.
Dean seemed completely confused, “What? No, not that. Do… do you think I would be a good dad? Like, I wouldn’t be like dad?”
Dean rolled his eyes and dropped Zeke’s shirt, grabbed his picture, and led Cas back out to the Impala. What he didn’t notice was Cas’s situation growing in his pants because Dean moving Cas out of the way to protect him was hot... no other way to say it.
He smiled at the warmth his daughter brought him, “Goodnight, sweetheart. I love you very much.” After hanging up, Cas rolled back over and soothingly rubbed Dean’s warm back, “Sorry, that was Annie. I tell her the same thing every night before bed and she just wanted to hear it.”
Cas could feel the tears start to build behind his eyes so he drained the other half of the whiskey. He messed up, with Dean, with Anna, with school, with himself.
Stick with me folks! Let me know if you have any questions! xxx
Dean could feel his knees get weak and his boner press hard against his zipper as Cas moved his lips down onto Dean’s neck, sucking a dark purple mark onto his pulse point before harshly grazing his teeth over the same spot.
Jess was already on the verge of happy tears, “You didn’t say anything, congratulations!”
Cas was quick to slip the elegant ring onto Dean’s left ring finger before pulling him into a kiss only to break it a minute later, “I found your grade book, it’s under the bed.”
Gabe strongly held onto Cas’s shoulder, “Yeah, I’m right here.”
Charlie put a hand on her small shoulder, “Hey, it’s okay. You can hang out with Jo and me today.”
They fell asleep with a smile on their faces but Dean and Cas weren’t the only ones; Annie fell asleep cuddling her stuffed bunny and the house phone. The smile her father put on her face peacefully turning into pleasant dreams.
Cas barely managed to mumble out, “I love you more.” Before falling asleep and having the nurses push Cas’s bed off towards the operating room.
Cas knows that his plan to stay in the closet already wasn’t going well and this definitely wasn’t going to help. Before he could stop himself he answered, “Sounds good.”
Dean threw his head back laughing at the image of Cas in his leather jacket and spiky black hair with a dainty little flower crown on. Then the thought manages to sneak its way into his mind,
Cas snuggled his face closer into his pillow, “Orange.”
D: ‘Do me a favor?’
In the ambulance, Cas tied a blue band around Dean’s right arm and softly said, “Big stick, keep your arm still.” Carefully, he pushed in the I.V needle and winched at the hiss Dean let out, “Sorry, baby.”
Dean gently shook Cas’s shoulder, “Oh, now I’m curious… come on, tell me. Pretty please.”
“No. He’s good at hiding.”
Cas’s cheeks turned a bright red, just as Dean’s had a few minutes ago, “I’ll see you around, Dean. Let’s go, Abby.”
Jo and Charlie, who had arrived a minute before, walked up to them, “Hey guys, everything okay?’
“Fine… want to fuck?”
Dean closed the door behind him and shuffled over the Cas’s bed after he stripped off his jacket and converse. Leaving him in his grey Henley and worn-in jeans, “What are you reading?” Dean laid down next to Cas, adjusting himself against the pillows.
Letting out a warm, deep chuckle, Cas pulled away from Dean, “If I wasn’t so goddamn hungry I’d take you up on that offer.”
Cas jumped and dropped the novel he was holding, “Hey, didn’t hear you guys come in.” He picked the book back up and walked over to his bed. He flopped down and patted the spot next to him, “Take your jacket off, stay a while.” Dean couldn’t help but notice how much more relaxed than usual Cas was in his plaid pajama bottoms and an over-sized t-shirt.
It was early Tuesday morning when it happened. Cas was deep in sleep when his phone rang from his nightstand. The first thing Cas read on his phone was the time, ‘1:09 AM’. The second thing he read was the caller I.D, ‘Dean’.
The two brothers said goodbye and made plans to meet up soon, Dean was walking to his car when his phone rang. Looking at the caller I.D, his phone read, ‘Novak.’ Dean hated the part of him that was excited that Cas was calling but even more than that, he hated the part of him that was annoyed he was calling. Groaning, Dean answered the phone, “Novak, what did I tell you about calling me?”
Cas is physically shaking; from anger or fear, Dean can’t tell, “I’m fine. Check his arm.”
On their blanket, Dean sat cross-legged and started to put her down on the blanket to try and access the damage but Annie made her protests known.
While the friends enjoyed their delicious food, Cas cruised down Central Ave until he pulled his bike into Singer’s Auto Shop. He was greeted by a surly looking man who was wearing a baseball cap and his dirty work clothes.
He couldn’t help but notice the empty beer cans and whiskey bottles, the broken picture frames, and glass, “Novak?” Dean stepped through to the kitchen and found Cas shirtless and bleeding from a cut on his temple on the kitchen floor. He quickly ran to Cas’s side and gently shook his shoulder, “Cas? Hey, are you okay?”
After being strong-armed into staying, Cas decided it would be best to call Bobby and beg for his job back. The phone rang the usual four times before Bobby picked up, “Singer Auto.”
“Yes… yes. Cas, please… more.” Dean rolled his hips, trying to get Cas to move and was successful when he started to slowly fucking Dean with one finger before sliding another.
Inside the house, they could hear Chuck throwing things and stomping down the stairs and when Dean first saw Chuck he felt the undeniable urge to kill him. And how Chuck looked at Cas like he was less than human, worthless, no better than the flies; it pissed Dean off to no end. What was worse was Chuck’s words. The words he spoke to his own son, “Who’s this? Your new fag?”
“Of course we can. I need a shower anyway.” Dean kissed Cas’s cheek before holding the front door open for him and following him out into the street.
Dean laughed again and god—Cas wishes he could see it because it sounds so beautiful, he can only imagine how it looks, “Well… seeing you is nice but I just got off of work. I’m just going to get some dinner.”
Cas, none the wiser, was confused at Gabe’s laughter until he made fun of Dean, “Dude, you know he’s blind, right?”
Dean started to angrily pace around Charlie’s office before slamming his fist into the wall. While he didn’t see Cas jump and instinctively cover his face, Charlie did. She quickly stood up and grabbed onto Dean’s arm before turning to Cas and trying to smile, “Cas, why don’t you head home for the day?”
Thank you, Katie, for the suggestion of writing an epilogue! I hope those of you who liked this story enjoy this. Much love xx.
Cas took Dean’s hand under the table and happily squeezed it, “You’re going to be seeing him a lot. So, we were thinking if you’d like to call him Dean, you could.”
Dean opened the front door with a smile on his face that quickly faded, “Hey, Cas! Oh my god… you look fucking amazing.”
Anna gave her older brother a hug before sitting down at their old kitchen table while Castiel shuffled through their ever-dwindling supply of food. He really needed some more money.
Back at Lawrence Elementary, Dean was helping the kids start their math lesson; adding and subtracting single digit numbers. Annie was being a model student; she was attentive, kind, respectful to her teacher and her fellow students and she was for the entire day.
By the middle of May, Cas had his own desk that was facing Kevin’s. The two twenty-year-olds would throw things at each other and goof off until Dean, who could see Cas from his office, would text Cas and tell him to be a good boy and get his work done.
Anna, already being a nervous, easily-spooked person was pushed over the edge by Alastair’s disgusting behavior. She started to shake and tear up, clearly upset by the encounter with the upperclassman; her vision blurring around the edges. Sam carefully took her small hand in his, “I know Alastair is terrible. Cas will always protect you and as long as I'm around, I will never let him hurt you.” Anna didn't respond, she just buried her nose in her book for the rest of the period.
Cas tried to speak even softer, he just wanted to talk to Dean and understand what was wrong, “Dean…”
Dean chuckled and quickly kissed Cas, “Sweetheart, if I said that was just okay… I’d be a goddamn liar.”
Sam came into Dean’s office around noon with food and paperwork, “Hey, Dean. How’s Cas doing? Have you talked to him?”
Jess and Mary both knowingly gave him a small smile that came from a woman’s intuition. Jess glanced into her glass, “I know, Dean. It’s alright. I really am happy you and Cas are happy together. You know me, I worry about everyone.”
Chuckling at his daughter, Cas nodded, “Of course we can.”
“He’s so confusing.” Dean thumped his head on the counter and groaned, “He’s so sweet sometimes but then he pulls away and gets so aggressive with Alastair and other people. I just… he’s confusing. He is a nice guy though, I think you’d get along with him.”
The empty house wasn’t creepy quiet instead it was peaceful. Mary and Sam were out looking for Sam’s first car, his gift for graduating high school.
Sam interrupted the awkwardness, “So… Novak’s, what can I get you today?”
Cas held him close against his body, gently rubbing his back in soothing circles, softly hushing him, “Oh, baby. I’m so sorry. You’re safe, everything is okay.”
After giving Cas a quick kiss, Dean ran up the stairs stripping off his flannel and t-shirt on the way up. In his room, he pulled on his black suit, white button up and a green tie, that perfectly complimented his eyes, before running back downstairs.
Feeling like an absolute failure, Dean apologetically said, “She was playing on the rocks and slipped and scraped herself. I’m so sorry, Cas. I should have been watching her more.”
“Bathroom.” Cas reached out for Gabe’s hand and let himself be pulled to his feet and half-carried to the bathroom.
Alfie busied himself attaching Mary to their EKG machine while Cas called Dean. He was answered with a grumpy, “What?”
“I’m not ashamed of you! Oh… fuck it! You don’t understand!” Cas turned and quickly walked past Charlie where she was still frozen in place.
They finished their walk and Dean went home to relax. His small, white ranch-style house was welcoming and just enough for Dean. For somebody who has always had a house but never truly had a home, it was the closest thing he’s had. Needing to talk to the one person who’s been with him through everything, Dean called his little brother, praying he would answer.
Dean took another drink as a silent rebellion, “RELAX, OLD MAN. YOU’RE GOING TO GIVE YOURSELF A HEART ATTACK!”
D: ‘JESUS CHRIST! I’M IN A MEETING, CAS!’
Cas’s pained voice snapped him out of his thoughts, “I’ll be ready in one second.” He heaved himself up and started to walk away from Dean, towards his room.
Cas easily recognized the painful tone in Dean’s voice, “He ever mess with you?”
C: ‘I fuskin neerd a dirnk.’
From where Cas was sitting in the ambulance he playfully slapped Alfie’s shoulder, “You owe me dinner.”
He was quickly put on the ground and straddled; the way the older man pounded on his face was similar to how Cas had beat Alastair weeks before. His jaw, cheek, nose, and eyes were turning back, blue, yellow and bloody.
The sight in front of him broke Dean’s heart. Cas was curled up on the bed with an I.V in his arm and an oxygen cannula in his nose, bandages covering his body and stitches on his face. He had tears in his eyes and his hands were shaking as he looked up towards the door, “Dean? Can you please shut the door?”
Still, Bobby waved him off, “It was his first body, Anyway, Dean dragged him into the station by his ear and yelled at him in front of everybody. Garth cried and never came back.”
All Dean wanted was to wrap Cas in his arms but he was bed-bound, “Cas, sweetheart—.”
Once Dean was plenty stretched, Cas pulled his fingers out at an agonizingly slow pace. Dean whimpered at the slow leak of lube dripping down his thigh; Cas was sweet enough to help him clean it up by licking it before sucking on his tight balls.
D: ‘She’s drunk… again.’
“Please…” Cas’s voice wavered and broke, his eyes filling with tears as he shook, “Just go away…”
“Yeah, baby?”
They laughed through their embarrassment and stayed in bed a bit longer after cleaning up, sharing sweet slow kisses. Dean frowned and stroked Cas’s cheek with his thumb, “As much as I wish we could spend today together, I have to go to the shop.”
Mentions of domestic violence/death/abuse
“Look, I know you don’t want anything to do with me but please, I need to explain myself to you.”
Dean couldn’t look at him anymore, he put all of his anger into the punch that knocked out Chuck.
Dean’s heart ached with sadness and anger, “That’s awful. But I’m so glad she has a loving family.”
She hopped into the driver’s seat, leaving Anna and Cas to roll their eyes and groan, remembering how … exciting (?) Amara could be. It was nice to see her, even under these circumstances.
Looking up, Cas saw Bobby’s worried face and tried to push him off but his words came out slurred, “Nothin’… ‘m fine.”
Dean looked up at him with a confused face so Cas explained, “… for money.”
“I can’t depend on other people.”
After another day of vomit and a hot shower later, they were both feeling much better and decided that a nice, long summer drive in the Impala was exactly what they needed after being cooped up in the bathroom for a week.
“Look, Bobby, I know I said that was my last shift and I was an asshole to you last night and I didn’t even say thank you for you helping my sorry ass but—.”
“Oh, shit dude. Get this, his dad was a cop.” Charlie looked heartbroken but Dean didn’t quite understand why.
Then it was Sam’s turn to introduce his partner, putting one hand on the pretty blonde girl’s back, he nudged her forward, “This is my girlfriend, Jessica.”
“I said, get the hell out.”
“Sir, please. He is a danger to himself and others, stand back.” The older male doctor was obviously trying to placate Dean and the detective was having none of it.
Looking especially disheveled, even without the dark bruises plaguing his face, Cas ran into the squad room twenty minutes late. He managed to slam into Chief Singer, who was holding a mug of fresh coffee, in his panic of upsetting Dean by being late. He only spilled a small amount of coffee on the front of Bobby’s old jacket but his panic amplified, “Oh my god, I’m so sorry, sir. I—I didn’t mean to, I’m so sorry—.”
“Well, you should be proud of yourself. It’s amazing.”
Finally, after two days of suffering, Dean started to feel better and was sleeping on the bathroom floor when he woke up to a disgusting noise at five in the morning, “Cas?”
She kissed his forehead and smiled lovingly, “I love you too, sweet dreams.”
After another minute of coaxing, Cas finally got up to shower while Dean tried to find some of his old dress clothes that may fit Cas. Luckily, he managed to find a small white dress shirt, a jacket, and a pair of pants from when he was in high school.
Cas clicked on the photo in question and blushed profusely, “That is what happens when Annie and my mother team up on me.” The photo was of Cas in makeup and jewelry with hair clips holding his black hair up in odd directions.
Dean cringed hard, “Jesus Christ, mom! …We were… you know, and it was a total accident but he put his hand on my throat and I freaked out. He tried to help but I told him to go fuck himself and I left… Mom, I yelled that in front of his kid.”
She happily stuck her hand out for Cas to shake, “It’s so nice to meet you, Cas.” Turning to his little sister, Mary shook her hand as well, “Anna, right? It’s nice to meet you as well. Please, come in.”
“Guess so, I basically built mine from scratch.”
Everyone in the room gave Mary a strange look but it was Sam who stepped in, “Mom, Dad… this is Cas.”
Not long after, Dean followed him with a groan, finishing deep inside Cas and tightly holding onto him. After a moment, Dean flopped down next to Cas and raised an arm to high-five him, not remembering that Cas couldn’t see him.
When they finally got to the courthouse, Dean lead them to Jody Mills’ office. She was a kind woman and an incredibly talented District Attorney. Jody greeted both Dean and Cas with a handshake and a hug.
“I guess we have to make up for lost time.” They both smiled and instead of Cas kissing Dean again, he tightly wrapped his arms around Dean’s neck and hugged him. Returning the sentiment, Dean held Cas around his waist.
Dean pulled Cas in for a sweet kiss, only breaking away when he couldn’t hold back his smile anymore, “Let’s grab a motel room for the night and get some dinner. We can finish the drive tomorrow.”
Dean agreed and at the same time they both said, “I’ll go.”
Yup… that was definitely a stroke. Dean could feel his eye twitch, “I’m sorry, are you fucking kidding me?! We are looking for some fucking crazy subway serial killer and you what? Just don’t care? Are you fucking crazy?!”
Dean bit his lip as Cas carefully unbuttoned his jeans and tugged them off of Dean’s lean legs. He slowly licked Dean’s hard cock that was still covered with the thin layer of his boxers.
Second, was the day Cas proposed… and the day Dean did as well. They were sitting on their front steps one late summer night after dinner, drinking a cold beer when Cas took Dean’s hand after reaching into his pocket to pull out a small silver band and nervously smiled at him, “Dean, I know this isn’t much but, me and you well… we’ve never been ones for grand romantic gestures but you’re my only love for the rest of my life. Will you marry me?”
Cas shrugged and mumbled against Dean’s warm skin, “A day or so… wanted you to be okay.”
Realizing that Annie was calling Dean her dad left him in a state of shock. The only thing he could do was wrap her in a towel and hold her.
Dean helped Cas up and watched as he dried his eyes, “I’m really sorry, Dean.”
Surprisingly, Cas pushed back even harder, “No. Just stop, okay? I’m not some poor victim you need to save. I’m fine.”
It wasn’t until three in the morning that Cas woke up to an empty bed. He reached to where Dean usually slept, hoping to pull him close and quickly doze back off to sleep. Unfortunately, when he heard the retching coming from down the hall, Cas knew he wasn’t going to get any more sleep that night.
Dean hugged Anna one more time before she turned and walked out of his life.
Chuck wheeled around and roughly shoved Cas by his shoulders, “Get the fuck off of me.”
Valentine’s Day. Horrible, scary, intimidating, insecure, awkward, high-expectation bullshit. How was Cas supposed to know what to do? Flowers? Chocolate? Grand romantic gesture? At a complete loss and the dreaded day quickly approaching, Cas enlisted the help of Charlie.
Dean jumped at the sudden movement, “Jesus, Cas! Don’t do that!”
“This isn’t funny!” Cas’s face was bright red as he repeated himself, crossing his arms and pouting, “I really despise you right now.”
In the middle of the living room, Dean shoved Cas off of him and yelled, “FUCK YOU!”
Dean whimpered and in his desperation started to babble, “Fuck, you’re so hot. Oh… Cas, please. Come on, fuck me. Please.”
Dean almost had a stroke because Cas is gorgeous; his tan skin is stretched over his strong muscles. His chest and abs made Dean’s mouth water and his dick strain against his dress pants. Dean had never moved faster than he did when he took his pants off; not caring that he was now completely naked and Cas was still half dressed, clad in only his jeans.
Cas crawled out of bed only to get his cell phone out of his jeans and dialed Gabe’s number. Dean could only hear what Cas was saying, “Hey Gabe, do you mind watching Annie tonight? …I have a life! Just make sure Annie gets to bed on time and no cake before bed, you know that makes her sick… And Gabe? Tell her I love her, okay?” Cas hung up and got back under the covers.
Dean started to get frustrated. He was trying to help and Cas started this… didn’t he? Why was he pushing Dean away now? It wasn’t fair. “Please just—.”
After wiping his eyes with the back of his hand, Cas walked over to Dean and stroked his freckle-covered cheek with the back of his hand before softly kissing him, “I love you, Dean.”
Her bouncing quickly stopped and she started to eat her lunch, earning Dean a thumbs up and a wink from Cas.
Cas was cut off by Bobby putting a steady hand on his shoulder; pulling the young boy close, he whispered so the many curious eyes staring at them couldn’t hear, “It’s alright, Novak. I’m not going to say anything about you being late but I strongly suggest you step outside and pull yourself together.”
Cas’s eyes weren’t the beautiful, bright blue that Dean pined over; they were a sickly grey that matched the dark bags under his eyes, “My dad killed her. He beat her until she stopped breathing.”
They spent six happy months getting to know each other. In the middle of June on Annie’s last day of first grade, the three of them got dinner together. About half-way through their meal, Cas cleared his throat, “So, Annie… you may have noticed that Mr. Winchester and I have been seeing each other a lot. How do you feel about that?”
Somehow, their feet had brought them to Dean’s bedroom. Neither of them noticed until the back of Cas’s knees hit the bed. Dean carefully laid Cas down and kneeled over him, “Is this okay?”
“Yeah, Sammy is still running around here somewhere, probably out back playing with the junkers. I just have to go home and pick up mom.”
Three days into their vacation, they were back at the beach. Cas walked to the concessions stand to get some drinks for them while Dean kept an eye on Annie.
The younger boy took a slightly smaller sip and coughed at the dark whiskey that warmed from his throat to his stomach, “Holy… that’s like gasoline.”
Dean blushed and smiled at Cas who gently held Dean’s free hand and ran his thumb over Dean’s knuckles, “So, baby… your birthday is coming up in a few weeks. Any idea what you want?”
Dean needed to help; he grabbed the blanket off the back of the couch and moved so he was leaning against the armrest, “Come here.” Dean held out the blanket and wrapped it around Cas when he scooched over, leaning back against Dean and being held between Dean’s legs. They would both be liars if they said they didn’t enjoy being so close. Dean wrapped his arms around Cas, pulling him close, “Go ahead, whenever you’re ready.”
They ate the yummy pasta, Cas and Dean were sitting together on the couch when Cas took Dean’s hand and sheepishly said, “I’m sorry I ruined our date.”
They both knew that they weren’t going to last much longer so Cas wrapped a hand around Dean’s cock and started to jerk him off in time with his thrusts. He growled and nipped at Dean’s neck, “Fuck, baby. You’re so perfect.”
But his blush was nothing compared to Cas’s when Gabe’s voice came through the door, “Are you guys done?!” It only grew with Mike’s voice joining him, “It sounds like it!” And grew with Luke’s, “What it sounded like was fun!” And grew with Alfie’s, “Was it fun?!”
Dean threw his hands up in the air, “You can’t even see my shirts!”
Gabe made a disgruntled noise as he parked the car in their driveway, obviously not believing his brother. They started to walk up their front steps when Cas tripped on the uneven steps and fell on his face… hard.
“Twenty-one.”
She nodded understandingly but supplied, “He means well.” Dean suppressed the urge to scoff and roll his eyes.
Dean could easily tell Cas was uncomfortable because he crossed his arms before answering. He tried to offer some help, “I’ll be there the whole time.”
Cas could barely move until he realized that the firefighters were prying the passenger door off Charlie’s car. He grabbed his med bag and started to run to the car; on the way, he saw Charlie being wheeled away on Hannah and Miriam’s stretcher. He stopped quickly to make sure she was okay. With tears in her eyes, Charlie was trying to calm her panicked breathing as she shakily said, “D—Dean…”
Before they could leave the waiting room, the same doctor from last night approached them, “Hello, just so you’re aware, we did have to give Castiel a bit more sedation so, between that and the morphine, he’s a little out of it. He consented to you being his emergency contact instead of a parent so I should inform you that we did a rape kit and we did find evidence of assault.”
Dean handed the young intern the large sealed plastic bag and watched him root through it until he pulled out her wallet. After looking through the small leather wallet, Cas shyly handed Dean the woman’s subway card and ticket receipts for the purple line.
With diplomas in hand, Dean, Cas, Jo, and Charlie all went to the Roadhouse for celebratory milkshakes. They planned out this summer to be the best one of their lives before college had to start. Charlie was going to MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Jo planned to go to UNH, University of New Hampshire, Dean got accepted to KSU, Kansas City University, and Cas was going to WSU, Wichita State University.
Castiel died August 18th at 1:47 PM. That day, the sky was the same summertime blue as his eyes. God… his eyes. Dean would never see them again; instead, he dreamt of those eyes every night. How they could change from lust-filled to loving, from happy to rage-filled, from sad to laughing. No matter what those eyes were projecting, they were always Cas.
They both returned the strange look and John smiled, “Oh! Dean’s intern, right?”
The early morning sunrise shone through the curtains as Cas placed his hands on his yoga mat, stretching down and pushing his hips up, easily flowing into downward dog. Over the past two years the scars, cuts, and bruises on Cas’s back had completely healed except for a few particularly bad ones but somehow, he had managed to take the best of a bad situation and use it as a reminder of strength and recovery.
Dean rolled his eyes as Cas started up his bike, “Fuckin’ smart ass.” He watched Cas drive off, a little too fast for Dean’s comfort level. He couldn't help but notice how relaxed the slightly older boy looked; had one had steering and the other hanging loosely by his side, he looked at home on that bike.
Abby bounced off the bed and Dean tried to put on her service dog vest and collar regardless of her wiggling. He made sure to grab a ziplock bag of food, her toy duck, and her vaccine papers, just in case.
It was one month into the school year, a particularly cool October morning but the morning sun still shined bright in the sky. The colorful autumn leaves were starting to wilt and turn brown as winter quickly approaches. The Impala's engine cut through the quietness of the early morning as Dean stepped slightly harder on the gas. Dean could feel the engine spring to life from under his worn-out black converse. The vibrations traveled up his jeans into his stomach and through his hands. These seemingly insignificant moments of peace were Dean's favorites.
Dean shrugged and laid back down, “Never came up.”
Cain snarled at him, “What can I say? I love to hear people beg for their lives. People are so clueless, they see somebody and just pass them by well, I’m not somebody you want to forget.” The end of his confession was finished with a smirk that made Bobby’s stomach twist.
Thankfully, Cas didn’t get upset by the comment. Instead, he smirked and pulled on his helmet before flipping up the eye guard, “Thanks, mom. I’ll get right on that.”
Trying not to run to the room, they closely followed the doctor, breathing out a sigh of relief when they saw Cas alive and doing well in the hospital bed. They both pulled up a chair on either side of the bed and held each of his hands. It took Cas about an hour to wake up but now that they knew he was okay, the hour seemed to fly by.
Dean grabbed the hose from him and completely drenched Cas, only stopping when Cas splashed him with water from the tub, “You’re such a shit!”
“I want it to stop. Everything… I want it to stop.” The pain, the dehumanization, the fear, the anger… it was all just too much.
Dean seemed confused by that, “But nothing. I had an amazing time and I’d love to see you again like A.S.A.P… like tonight.”
Shaking his head, Cas scooched over to make room for Dean. He flicked on the lighter and held it to the end of the joint, breathing in as he lit up. He took a long drag and held it, breathing in the smoke before exhaling and handing the thick joint to Dean.
Anna obediently and swiftly put on the helmet before climbing onto the bike. She waited until Cas climbed onto the bike and wrapped her arms around him as he always told her to.
Sounding much happier now and slightly muffled by her pillow, Annie mumbled, “Goodnight, Daddy.”
C: ‘Race you home.’
