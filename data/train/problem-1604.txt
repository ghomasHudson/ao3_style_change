They walked through the gate stifled by the arched hedge and Watson admired the beauty of the garden. Flowers of such variety. It was well kept and clear that someone really cared about this garden. Maybe even a bit OCD about the whole thing. Near the building were three little white house shaped blocks. Slabs of concrete were placed under the quant huts, keeping them high and prominent above all else it seems. They looked secretive and suspicious all at the same time. When John pointed them out to Sherlock on route to the front door, the smile that spread across Sherlock’s face! It was unfathomable. He excitedly skipped over to the white blocks, with his hands emphatically reaching towards the boxes. “Oh Eleanor! You brilliant woman!”
Why would he send them a letter if he had done it? Guilt? Ego? Was he covering for someone? Why have someone you know is bloody good at his job investigate a murder you have part taken in? It didn’t make sense. John went through the logic and he couldn’t make sense of it. It was simple thinking he tried to brush it off but he had to follow his gut. Sherlock was in mid sentence about something to do with the smugglers when John interrupted, “mister Scott why did you write us a letter?” Sherlock looked offended and he shuffled his feet under the table to lightly tap his foot against his doctors, he was agitated, this was not what they had discussed. Henry looked tearful but bemused, “Mister Holmes is the best there is, and I knew he’d find out who killed her.” Then it hit Sherlock too, the nagging blaringly obvious fact he had missed all along, god did he hate when that happened, why would he send them a letter if he had done it? He’s been so dragged down by the horrid but true fact of the incest he’s missed the complete obvious. It was the forced morphine in Nanjing he blamed for such a misjudgment.
The letter was written on very nice paper, thick and embossed with a sort of eggshell tinge rather than that usual grey-white colour we know so well on the cheap printing paper that’s used in everyday life. This, this paper then obviously came from somewhere important. By the time Sherlock had read it John had returned from his room and on John’s entering Sherlock held out the letter, inviting John to read it’s hand written scrawl. Once John freed Sherlock of the paper, Sherlock lay down on the sofa and placed his pressed fingers upon his chin. The words required thought then.
John and Sherlock made it through six vodka and cokes in an hour, and the questions became increasingly personal. They were all hypothetical innocent scenarios up until the fourth drink. And then they just at some point hit the fuck-it wall; by the eighth they could hardly string a coherent word together. In a slurred drunken manner John asked “best sex you’ve ever had?”
There was disturbance in the hall. Feet marching with purpose their way. "Voici la police! Bouge toi!" Several voices shouted and the two guilty parties looked at each other panicked. There was no way out. The gun was dropped and they hugged one another knowing it may be the last time. The police arrived batons up, "se tourner vers le mur!" The two Americans were pulled apart and cuffed. The gun was collected and placed in an evidence bag. One officer approached Sherlock and John, "qui êtes-vous deux?" Sherlock stepped forward with an outstretched hand, "I am Sherlock Holmes and this is Dr John Watson." The officer took it eagerly and shook his hand with excitement and spoke with a thick French accent, "Merde! Mr Holmes, it is a pleasure to meet you! Is this about the American man who was murdered in England?! Merde, well come wiv us to zee station and we will talk it all out. We can transfer these men to your jurisdiction no problem." With that Sherlock and John followed the troop of armed blokes back into public domain. John could almost taste the fish and chips they would be getting once back in Somerset. "Fuck Sherlock, the son, I didn't even think of that." Sherlock placed his hands behind his back like a proud peacock, "Ah John, remember that you must not make me full goldfish." John smiled, "I vow never to do that Sherlock."
Everything was colour and blurred faces. Loud noises, strange smells and so many vehicles! Speeding buses, black taxis, bicycles, cars and even the London Underground shook the tarmac beneath your feet, This is how London should be seen. With purpose and pace.
Once they reached the main road Sherlock turned to his short friend and mockingly said, “I think you might have had a growth spurt Watson.”
Sherlock was happy with his progress with John and to prove a point he moved his King one-step closer to its castle attacker, from D1 to D2. He felt no need to defend himself in any capacity with John, he knew they were on the same side, somehow even whilst playing chess. This was so different, so new to Sherlock, everyone has felt like his enemy up until this point. John has been the first he has felt safe with.
Every inch of his being screamed 'John pay attention to me!' He had a point, John had barely looked at him since he had awoken from his unconscious terror. What was wrong with him? Sherlock was so focussed on the case of which the answer lay literally thousands of miles away (most likely) that he made the faulty, nay catastrophic assumption that John was just distressed of the isolation endured, if only he could string together all the signs of desire that lay behind John's, well everything.The body language, the blushing, the not so secret stares, everything. John turned and finally connected eyes with his detective. Those electric eyes, so full and enigmatic John wondered if it was even possible to not let your heart become totally lost in its misty waters. John said nothing and Sherlock waved his hands dramatically mid air as if to say 'What the actual fuck? You have not been yourself for daaaaaaaaaaaays, I need the actual you! The doctor, assistant, trusted companion, therapist, the lot! Get here NOW.' John got it, he had been waiting for this for days to be frank.
John and Sherlock walked determined. Lestrade met them at the door, hands deep in his pockets. Instead of a greeting, Sherlock noted, “Lestrade stop biting your lip, it shows weakness.” Lestrade rolled his eyes and John spoke softly, “morning Greg, don’t worry I’m nervous too, as is Sherlock but he would not dare admit it.” Sherlock was the next to roll his eyes. Lestrade and Watson shook hands, this seemed to be the way they would indefinitely greet one another. Professional but oddly intimate, it was a mutual way of indirectly letting the other know that they knew Sherlock was weird but they also both knew of his brilliance. Make sense?
It was at his nod that six faceless individuals came into the room and preceded to forcefully walk John and Sherlock to a larger room and instead of attaching them to the seats they sat on, they were attached to one another. Hand cuff to hand cuff, wrist to wrist. John felt brave now, with Sherlock he felt like he needed to defend them, Sherlock was clearly weak and who, had obviously endured some horrific things. With this notion John even ignored those in front of him and looked into Sherlock’s eyes, “Sherlock, we are going to be okay.”
John started to laugh then, really laugh. He was hit with relief. He was going to get married and his friend was alive. In fact Sherlock could be his best man! That is something he couldn’t consider until thirty minutes ago. Sherlock bloody Holmes. Only he could return from the dead. John always had a teeny amount of hope. It was large at first, for example at the funeral he was resolute in his belief that Sherlock would jump out from behind a tree by the church and expect everyone to laugh. When he didn’t John covered it up with maybe tomorrow. John would find himself buying necessities at the supermarket expecting Sherlock to put Jam in John’s cart when he wasn’t looking, even if he didn’t reveal himself this would let John know that Sherlock was okay. That is all he would have needed.
John began to hyperventilate, and now he was being manhandled to stop him from passing through those doors. “I have to be with him!” Sherlock by this stage was long gone, and John after a lot of wasted effort, gave up. He threw his hands up in the hair and said “fine! Okay! Fine! Is their a viewing window?!” One of the nurses nodded and said, “come.” John said an angry thank you and followed her to god knows where. Once more he was on automatic. He realised that he was on his way to witness his friend being cut open.
They placed the opened letters flat out on the table that Sherlock had recently stood atop, and the two men inspected the letters in front of them, hoping it would lead them to the justice Eleanor deserved.
Mary had no pretense of allowing Sherlock into her and John’s house. How could she? After what he had done to her John. Or rather, their John. THEIR John. Mary told herself often that she wasn’t the first. Yet, a small part of Mary was rooting for Sherlock. After all the incredible adventure stories she had squeezed out her boyfriend, how could anyone not be curious. Besides the man successfully staged and faked his death for TWO years. He had to be worth something, some form of reconciliation. He was after all the reason as to why she met John, maybe she deserved to give John and him a chance.
John was so shocked by the request that he almost dropped the heavy book on his toes. “Sherlock it’s late! And it’s his daughter who had been murdered!”
The room was very dark, almost pitch black but six eyes soon adjusted. The room was small, and the men had to stand within each other’s personal space, something that may have been a nuisance in other circumstances. However the individual gazes focused on only one wall in particular. This wall almost entirety consisted of a window. A one-sided window of which the other side was a mirror. Another disguise, brilliantly designed so that when the suspect was looking at you, with full knowledge that someone lay beyond the glass, they were forced to look at themselves. An introspective, self-conscious inducing target making anyone weaker than if they were being questioned anywhere else. “The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown” was the quote that sprang to Sherlock’s mind, Author H.P Lovecraft. The genius of it made Sherlock smirk. How fitting.
To that the attendant brought over their drinks and even more alarming to John, Sherlock said “We’ll start a tab please. This won’t be our first.” The woman nodded and then left the men to their drinks.
They knew Heathrow well and proceeded to swiftly exit the terminal, they entered Sherlock's favourite transport, the black taxi, their driver's card stuck to the perspex barrier informed them their driver was called Rajesh Pankhania. An excellent London name. One of the reasons why Sherlock loved London was just how multicultural it was. Every culture and creed was represented amongst it's winding streets. Every face was different and it made everything and everywhere in London interesting. Fascinating, secret and assuredly different from the rest of England, and many other cities around the world. Sherlock had several documents saved on his apple laptop awaiting at 221b Baker Street, all of which encapsulated Sherlock's love for London. He felt the essay in particular that assuredly described his feelings the most was entitled
John stood to pace but on his first step, there was a ping sound resounding amongst the many many people and a green number flashed next to their flight time. John and Sherlock both nearly strained their necks at the speed they went about focusing on the board. Gate number sixteen. It was all hands on deck and John was weaving Sherlock in between casual travelers, holidaymakers, all suitably relaxed, whilst John and Sherlock were fleeing for their lives. They reached gate number sixteen and John was covered from head to toe in sweat. He was breathing hard, the action of it made Sherlock painfully smile. Even Sherlock could begin to see a way out. He wouldn’t have been able to do any of it without John. He would have died hours ago without him. And even if he did some how survive, he never would have made it this far and he would be shipped back to that concrete room and been killed in god knows which way.
Anderson was now a meter away from the Detective and the Doctor, he paused in his chase and uttered “well I don’t know Sh…” Sherlock waved the letters around midair as if in mocking, “Do the police know?”
Sherlock and John arrived at Kings Cross at 3.46pm. On seeing the boards it became obvious that this station would not take them to were they wanted to go. Oyster cards in hand they took a very short tube ride to London Paddington. John loved the Underground. Unlike lots of people, the Underground made him feel safe. Its intricate series of tunnels and opposing streams of people made him feel oddly secure. Maybe he liked the anonymity about it. Becoming a soldier gave him a code and a position meaning that he was just a part of the thousands of other men that had signed up, important but minor all at once, the city did the same thing for John. London: the city that literally never sleeps. Millions of faces to be amongst and be a part of the beating heart of the place. The underground did this especially, he felt simultaneously at the centre of the world and insubstantial all at the same time. He asked Sherlock over the screech of the metal on metal that lay beneath them "why do we not use the Underground more?" Sherlock looked up from his free copy of the 'Evening Standard' that awaited him in the seat to look at his assistant. "Being above ground is more beneficial for the work. Looking out the window of a taxi you can see it all and the crime that may have or will occur, it allows me to really see London as it truly is. Underground only allows you to see people on platforms, who you share a seat with and the black innards of the tunnels, may sometimes be useful but, that's all it offers from a professional perspective." With that Sherlock fleshed out the paper with a single shake and continued to read a story about the drug abuse caused by a Surrey member of parliament. John just nodded, accepting the reasoning, he looked at the front of the paper and realised that tomorrows headlines would probably be about the man of which they were heading to investigate.
“Yes Dr. Watson I do, and I play mean. There is no benefit to letting people win.” The coy playfulness in Sherlock’s voice was unintentional, but John didn’t know that and the comment made him snicker.
John nodded and said, “erm right, Henry worked with the gang that Eleanor also worked with in Shanghai, if that isn’t enough as a threat we can also point out malpractices and weaknesses of his profession, if the incest isn’t enough, obviously,” John rolled his eyes and the mimic of his flat mate made Sherlock have to hide his giggling, John continued, “the crime boss loved Eleanor meaning that he’ll most likely try and kill whoever killed Eleanor if the police mishandle it, after all they may know something we do not, Mark is in the closet, and we have come up with a way to get Henry’s hand writing giving a viable way to take him to court.” With every fact Lestrade’s face became more and more telling. Each sector of his facial muscles contorting further to demonstrate the pace his brain was attempting to work at. As he went to speak it was like watching a computer reboot painfully slow, “How?!”
Sherlock flashed John a look, his brow now crinkled upright in excitement, John on the other hand wiped his top lip nervously and shifted on the balls of his feet, making his knees click once more. Dark curls leaned forward slowly, the boat shuddered as he did so, neither men believed in premonition, somehow though it felt as if the whole world was watching. Sherlock pinched the exposed corner and slipped it out, moving as slowly as if he was trying to detonate a live bomb. Labeled all along the rectangle card were the words 'fragile do not bend,' written in strong red, unwilling to be ignored and screaming for demands to be met. As long fingers began to pry the opening, John shifted nervously to check their onlookers were in fact preoccupied; no one was at the door nor helm, they were unwatched. John returned to watching Sherlock reveal the envelopes hidden contents. What was pulled out was a wad of crisp white paper. Stapled in a vary of manners making it obvious what was relevant to what. Sherlock skimmed them all, and after each one was assessed he passed it on to John to finalise his own findings. Most of it John could not make out, there was banal talk of percentages, shares and profits. How anti-climactic, something put at great pains of hiding and John could not understand any of it. He huffed, "I don't get it." Sherlock continued to look through his own stack, silent for a second, eyes moving frantically between words, webs interweaving in his mind palace, then all at once he was on his feet, laying the documents in an order. John followed, slower, Sherlock clicked his fingers and gestured to John's papers, unable to open his mouth through fear that his revelation would escape his head. John knew what he meant, and passed the sheets to his fake husband for the day.
Lestrade added to the conversation, "I thought the same, he insisted even though I followed protocol in homicide and said it was just a 'chat' but he insisted, so he's bringing a fellow lawyer with him, a colleague actually, guy called Mark Warren."
“Everyone does. But if you genuinely feel that way, then I’m afraid you may as well walk out of here a lifer.”
"How can you be bored already?! We have around eight hours at least left, I refuse to believe you're bored." John was driving, they'd agreed shifts but in easy dramatic fashion Sherlock slumped down in the passenger seat and gave the most almighty sigh. A sacred John persisted, "alright look, talk about the case, maybe you can use this time to solve this thing without us even having to go on this bloody drive." Sherlock now rolled his eyes and spoke intentionally slow, "John, we don't have any further information to go on, American politician on beach, four fatal stab wounds to abdomen, no murder weapon, its probably at the bottom of the ocean by now, unless the murderers are stupidly sentimental and on running away, or rather sailing away I very much doubt such an idle notion," Sherlock began to talk faster to simply get his reasoning out of the agonising way, "murderers are skilled sailors aboard the stolen Cleopatra, they go to France, please don't make me explain that one again, so what do we do? John, you and I, we go to France." Sherlock slumped even further in his seat to extend his confinement, John gripped the steering wheel tighter in an effort to not grind his teeth. "Sherlock you know you are the most sarcastic arse I think I've ever met." Sherlock didn't reply he just looked out the window like a bored six year old wanting anything, something to do. "Sherlock, okay there are some things which are unexplained, for example, why was he here?" Sherlock lolled his head to look at John's profile, "easy, his heritage is here, his mother is buried in Minehead cemetery." John opened his mouth and flailed his thumbs on the wheel, "how the hell do you know that." It was more an accusation rather than a question. Sherlock sighed once more, he'd never understand the normal mind, "whilst Delaney is an American name, Musgroves is not, that's a Somerset name. Mother's maiden name is guess what John, Musgroves. He was visiting his mothers grave, for probably the hundredth time since her death, last night whilst you slept I got up in the middle of the night and went to the grave yard, she's there, Sandra Delaney, buried alongside mummy and daddy Musgroves, I only had to leave the hotel room for fifteen minutes." John's face scrunched up in confusion, "then how come no one mentioned an anecdote or just the fact that they knew him personally?" Sherlock turned his shoulders so that he could really witness John respond to this, "John do you know which region of England is the most superstitious?" Now John gritted his teeth. "I'm assuming it's here Sherlock" he forced out between pursed lips. Sherlock spoke as if he was the human embodiment of sarcasm, "that's right John! The South West Coast of England buys the most bollocks there is, whether that is stones believed to own spiritual powers or just the simple idea that no one should speak ill of the dead." John ignored all of the increasingly less bearable tone and tried to shift focus on something else, "okay smart arse, so why kill him?" Now Sherlock crossed his arms, becoming less bored for the moment, John took a brief glance at the change in movement, pleased at the direction he'd enforced, "where's the motive?"
“Erm, right, loss of blood, high blood pressure, muscle weakness, anaemia, rhythm disturbance, overactive glands, err, heart failure could be hereditary, or heart attack caused by a many number of things, bad lifestyle, diet etcetera, again genetic likelihood again, or it could be caused by shock, or…”
It was only on entering the vehicle and turning on the heated seats that made John make the assessment that Sherlock had money. He had never thought about it before, but clearly Sherlock had money. Serious money. It made sense with a fancy long name and a brother of such ministerial importance. So they had money. That is definitely something John could get used to. The car made him think of the hotel they were heading to. Imagine.
Sherlock just gave a look and so John turned around. ”You realize Sherlock that I was in the army, I have seen a lot of naked men.” Sherlock completely ignored the comment and was in full focus of the task in front of him. He attempted with as few whimpers a possible to undo his belt and hover daintily to allow gravity to let the trousers slide down to his ankles. It was at his stage Sherlock was glad he went commando that day many days ago, taking underwear off would have been a nightmare. He did smell of dirt and the metallic smell of blood arose from his body but he would have to shower later. He definitely did not enjoy being unclean, but being alive felt better, even if he was alive in his own filth. At this point he could not help but whine like a puppy as he as quickly as possible pulled the bottoms over his long legs. On getting them to his waist he sighed in relief and told the back of John’s head, “We need to get out.”
John, and I don't mean the kind of twisted fun I have when there is a corpse in the room, or a dangerous situation at hand, I mean a high from just being with another person, you are making me an extrovert John, a gold fish fucking extrovert, but only with you and it is fascinating, we need to make experiments around this John because how the fuck do you do this to me, we went crabbing for fuck sake, how do you make every zone a comfort zone, it is bizarre I feel like a new person, and I am so confused and slightly concerned by it but simultaneously I don't care, because as long as we work together I think I will be happy and I won't feel lonely. My whole life I have watched countless social interactions and seen how people fuck one another over time and time again and I never saw it, saw why people enjoy others company, and now you have come along and I see in my own life that I can, I can enjoy being with people, but maybe it is only you John, I don't think I could live with anyone else, it doesn't make sense for that to be needed, I feel I'm becoming dependent on you and I hope that is okay."
“Sherlock” she said cheekily whilst tapping him across the chest with the back of her right hand “well who is the boyfriend? Introduce me to the man you’ve obviously ran away with for the past two weeks.”
Sherlock and John make several promising admissions to themselves and each other, and with a few hours to kill John persuades Sherlock to go on a childish crab hunt amongst the stones of which the potential murder weapon may be found.
kill an American Governor," which made John giggle. Most of what Sherlock said now was to either impress or humour John, it was a nice change to how he used to live. Speaking to other people was usually a bitter exchange. Everyone was so stupid and vacant. John was like no other, Sherlock could speak to him, really speak to him, and not only could he keep up but he would come up with things Sherlock wouldn't even think of. It was normally the human touch, the heart behind a motive. John had more humanity than anyone he had ever met. It made the illogical side of the cases more accessible to Sherlock. People are illogical, and John could see it, it was invaluable.
Sherlock and John were let into the, albeit arguably going downhill, dock of Mine head. A police officer who must have been near retirement age was required to follow them around the duration of their deducing in the now pitch black boat harbour. He opened the gate that clearly protected nothing, with a key to a simple padlock. The padlock was so rusty John was convinced it would not open. The elderly key holder was very small, smaller than John, making Sherlock giggle on meeting him. Not only was he small, his back was also curved, and his glasses were so thick they made his yellowing eyes look ginormous, as if an owl had been assigned to watch them the entire evening. He was quiet, John attempted at small talk but unfortunately he did not rise to any of the questions, it seemed as if he wanted to go home, a dead man on a beach was evidently a nuisance to him rather than a point of fixation that the rest of the village had been engulfed it. The effort of opening the padlock and then the creaking gate left the old officer puffing and on John asking if he was okay, the gentlemen waved him off and said with his face turned to the ground in an effort to catch his breath, "you youngens' just go and get your work done." John was rather flattered to be called a 'youngen.'
Without even questioning Mary came and took the mug from her John’s hands. She sat back down and placed her and John’s mugs side by side on the side table, preparing herself to break up a fight. This was more than likely as John was in his ‘Captain’ stance. Feet wide, Shoulders back, arms to the side and chin up.
At this stage Sherlock was becoming animated, he was moving his hands and excitedly linking his words together. John smiled in surprise. “Sherlock I thought you’d be difficult, I thought it would take hours to get a genuine peep out of you.”
It wasn’t a simple surgery then, but it was without its complications (thank fuck.) John felt himself take a real deep breath then. Sherlock wasn’t going to bleed out and he wasn’t going to suffocate. He was okay. They’d stitched him up, and he was as of now (besides the tube still in his side) blood free. Post-op and ready to become conscious once more. Now that Sherlock was going to be okay, John’s mind whirred; they hadn’t in fact got far from Shanghai, let alone out of the country, being so close to the smugglers hide made him feel nervous. What if they found out? What if they said it wasn’t good enough? Thought they had double-crossed them and took them back to kill them after all? John forced himself to relax. To be honest he just needed to sleep. He was exhausted. He hobbled his way back to the reception to find a very sweet and old Chinese woman who pointed John in the direction of his recovering friend.
John awakes in his Shanghai hotel room to find a surrendered Sherlock and six gunmen. They are taken god knows where and to John's peril separated. John doesn't know where Sherlock is, nor if this is related to the Eleanor Scott case. Will they get out?
John and Sherlock said farewell to Mrs. Hudson and made their way up the short flight of stairs to the, their, flat. John’s new home. In admission on arriving at the door he realised he really hadn’t thought this through very much. He just followed his gut like he had his whole life. It felt right. Once the door swung open and they both walked through the door, Sherlock didn’t say anything he just took his whooshy coat off and hung it up on the wooden coat stand before walking around and checking everything was in tact. He didn’t check round to see if John had scarpered, he just continued as he would if John wasn’t there, or rather as if John had always been there.
John felt a bit strange about the news, just for that initial moment when someone tells you some news that you expect to be indifferent about. Up until this moment Sherlock had been all Johns, they had just been with each other. But on meeting Mrs. Hudson, he didn’t feel his way? She knew Sherlock just as well as Molly imaginably, probably more. Was it the fact that she liked Sherlock? That she may have some kind of ‘claim’ on him? John needed to shake this off and accept that Sherlock clearly wasn’t as isolated as John had envisioned. He was never going to be the first. Was John needy? He hadn’t ever been needy in his relationships; his girlfriends had always complained that he was the opposite, too independent and distant.
John sat back in his chair and folded his arms. He placed his right thumb to his lips as if the taste would provide him with the thoughts he needed. Once the correct thought hit him he placed both his hands face down on the table as if to give him some grip on their discussion. He took a deep breath before his words chimed from his voice box.
"Sherlock, don't turn it down! You've just been in major surgery!" Sherlock turned the dial anyway and said "Morphine affects thinking John, we need to get on with this case, process it, you definitely aren't going to let me leave here for the next few days even though it was what I would prefer, so let's get on, we are still in the country, relatively close to our capturers, so still in danger, therefore we need to solve this." Sherlock's face turned to a wince as the lack of morphine took affect. John turned the dial back up and said "I'd rather you worked pain free for fuck sake." Sherlock went to turn the dial back to its previous position but John sternly said "leave it or so help me god." Sherlock admitted defeat and sat up as comfortably as possible. "It wasn't them, it wasn't them that killed Eleanor."
John followed Sherlock to the sofa and sat down next to him. Anderson at this stage may have not even been here. “When did you learn all that?!”
John and Sherlock pulled up to 221b and on thanking and paying the driver, John hastily followed after Sherlock who had already entered through both entrance doors to their flat and made himself comfortable on the sofa. Their sofa thought John. He had splayed out all of the information they had on paper; all five letters, all photocopies, two bank statements, both photocopies also and the notes Sherlock had been making. All in Mandarin of course. On seeing the script John thought ‘cocky shit.’
Sherlock and John have begun a conversation that has no patience, and something needs to be requested that has never been asked before...
After John's dream of kissing Sherlock makes John realise his feelings, Sherlock awakes in Nanjing hospital, much to John's relief, and a discussion ensues when Sherlock makes an admittedly alarming deduction.
The tantrum that Sherlock erupted into was like that child you see in the supermarket who is told by their mother to put the chocolate cereal back on the shelf. He was all like ‘oh god why’ and ‘no’ and ‘Anderson is the worst.’ Amongst all of this, John raised his hands in a questioning manner and asked a now stressed Lestrade “who’s Anderson?”
Once the laughter settled John turned on his side and stared at his breathing friend. There wasn’t even a mark on his head but John remembers the smell of the blood. On bad days he even tasted it in the air. There was so much of it. All over Sherlock’s brilliant head, his brain apparently made to mush on impact. Just the thought made his stomach twist.
Sherlock and John arrive back in London after what feels like an age away. A friendly cab driver provides a new opinion and a reunion with Lestrade proves most fruitful.
John leapt out of his seat and bolted down the aisle, shouting all the while “I’m a doctor and his friend!” On reaching Sherlock’s aisle the two people from his row had already left their seats and were standing in the aisle unsure of what to do with themselves. John sat down next to Sherlock who was hunched over with his head awkwardly squashed against the seat in front of him, and repeated his name over and over again in the tiny hope that consciousness was even an option. John pushed the same staff alert button that Sherlock had pushed over and over again to order drinks on the way here, then he gently lifted Sherlock’s head to reveal the last thing he wanted to see. John awkwardly held Sherlock’s head and panic rippled through his core. “Please! I need water! Please! And a straw!” John shouted for everyone to hear and that was the aim.
Sherlock and John made it onto the plane that was supposed to be their salvation. Sherlock is severely injured and he collapses on the plane. John needs to save his friend. Why can't he save his friend. Live Sherlock live, please.
. All of these documents were password and encrypt protected. Sherlock never wanted anyone to read them, especially of which John. He knew the mockery that was likely to fly his way.
“Sherlock I don’t understand and I may never quite get it, however you are back now and I need you to stand up.” Sherlock looked like a child getting told off at school. He too placed his mug on a table and ever so slowly stood, his eyes never quite looking at John. He was also bracing himself for a kicking.
"I'm not getting dressed." John placed the mugs down on a crowded table, "I didn't even say anything." Sherlock's footsteps could be heard from his bedroom crossing between the wooden floor over the rug and onto the wooden floor again, "no, but you know I can hear you think." John sighed, they needed a case. It had been just over a day and already John, a trained man now understood why Sherlock needed his mind so focused. He was like a rabbit with epilepsy. Then the violin started up again. When the subject of moving in together first breached Sherlock had warned John about the violin, and sure mostly it was still charming, and he was very good, and watching the composing was bloody interesting, but when it was just Bach's Allegro Moderato over and over and over again, the ice was getting a bit thin. Hopefully the next case would be a long one. John felt a twist in his gut, what was that? As he took his first sip of his tea his face proved confused, was that guilt? Had he already become so banal to this stuff, so used to the pain this work came along with. Murder, crime, death, torture, exhaustion. Maybe he didn't want the next one to be long. Shit, what if he wasn't ready.
Once they were ready to go, the next mountain was just getting Sherlock to move. He was in a lot of pain, and the weakness in him was unavoidable despite his stubborn will power. John then had an idea. He picked up the landline phone and dialed to the hotel reception on the many floors below his feet. Before the unsuspecting employee had time to go through the whole script John said “Hello there, may we have a wheelchair taken up to room 506 please? Make it quick. Thank you.” John then hung up the phone and within three minutes of anxious pacing, on Johns part, there was a knock on the door. John practically ran to the door to find a very happy Chinese man with a wheelchair. John could have clapped. On seeing Sherlock the man was immediately concerned, on voicing his worry it became clear that his English was really not up to scratch. “Man, hurt, we, phone hospital.’” The last thing John wanted was more time wasted. “No no, really that is okay, he’s okay.” John got Sherlock’s wallet from the desk and forced some notes into the mans hand before practically man handling him out of the room, “thank you, thanks, okay bye now.” John shut the door and stood with his back touching the wood. He huffed and then walked over to a horrifically pale Sherlock. “Right Sherlock.” John wheeled the wheelchair to be right in front of his detective, a mere step away. John bent down and with Sherlock’s accommodating, he put his arm underneath Sherlock’s armpit on his good side to stretch around his back. With some huffing Sherlock was soon on his feet and he slowly sat in the chair with some painful hums.
John and Sherlock have made it to the airport in Shanghai, there is crime organisation out to recapture them and with only two hours to get out the country and back to the safety of 221b the chances of survival are looking slim. Will they or won't they make a flight?
John leant forward and said with a safe smile upon his lips, “Sherlock, you are one of the most intelligent and provocative people I have ever had the pleasure to meet. And I say people, because even if you don’t believe it or feel it, you are human. You care and you strive to benefit others because you need to. You have no idea why you need to, or why you are this way, yet you are. You just be Sherlock. You exist as much as everyone else, if not more for all you feel, or all you avoid to feel, you experience the darkness and the greatness of humanity with every death you look into.”
So it was definite, John liked Sherlock. He liked liked him. He couldn't get over it, for hours and then days Sherlock just spoke from his hospital bed. Non-stop and even though John listened, he wasn't really listening. He would pace and pace and Sherlock thought he was listening, well not that it would have mattered, he would have spoken to himself if John wasn't present. But Sherlock knew something was wrong, the usual 'amazing' or 'fantastic' didn't escape John's lips when Sherlock finally strung together a deduction about the case. John would just pace and 'mmmm' about the whole thing. Unusually severe about even the supposed steps of progress. Sherlock would even practically scream "don't you see John! See and observe it John! Come on! It's all there!" It wasn't until Sherlock was due to go back into surgery to have the menacing blood draining tube removed from his side that Sherlock finally demanded "John!!"
Sherlock had woken John once before, in Shanghai, however that was at gun point. He wanted to do it right this time, pacifistic and at zero threat. John had heard Sherlock watching him this whole time. He knew Sherlock was looking at him for he could feel it, and he heard the detectives foot steps inch closer, making faking sleep increasingly difficult. He walked over and shook John's arm gently with an open hand. "John" he hushed. John took a deep inhale and opened his eyes as slowly and sleepily as he could muster. On breathing out a tired "morning" he think his acting passed. He felt he'd made the right decision in not embarrassing the detective. Sherlock mimicked a quiet "morning" before going about his routine. John rolled out of bed for the second time today and made his way into the bathroom and on shutting the door and undressing, Sherlock was doing the opposite. Sherlock heard the shower turn on and thus thought it safe to disrobe. The suit he was to wear today was one of his best. Savile Row, exact measurements with secret seam pockets and his favourite red thread to the collar button hole to match his Belstaff coat. It was a very dark grey, almost black at a vacant glance, but a trained eye would have spotted its true colouring. The shirt underneath was crisp white and he questioned whether to have two or three buttons undone before deciding upon two. And of course this suit meant that going commando was the only way forward.
“John stop, you are not trivial like this. If we argue, we argue, but the work is the most important thing John. It's the most important thing to me, and if I know you as I think I do, it will soon become the same for you, if not immediately. So 221b Baker Street?”
“Oh for god sake John, on top of the fridge.” Sherlock said it as if it was the most obvious place in the world. John sauntered over to the fridge and slid the pages off its surface, and it soon became clear that it had not been used nor cleaned in a while; John had to cough out the dust that commenced to enter his lungs. On handing Sherlock the thick yellow book John asked, “is that even the updated version?”
John felt his stomach flip, he wanted to ask ‘fucking why?’ all this time he never truly appreciated the incest theorem yet now the man involved in the escapade of what takes two to tango sat in front of him, begging them to not tell his wife, it was all just sad really, not quite the final hurrah he had anticipated, Henry didn’t even look mean, he just looked weak and disappointingly normal, but John held his tongue and let Sherlock continue, “that you what? Say it, for the microphone and for your very confused lawyer.” Henry took a deep breath and said out loud for the first time in his life, “don’t tell my wife that I, that I, had relations of a sexual nature with Eleanor.” Mark looked disgusted, heinously repulsed, he couldn’t help himself, “Henry?! With Eleanor? Henry I can’t defend that! You told me I knew everything!” Sherlock thought this was all going very well; they were even more like gold fish than he had imagined. With every word Henry spoke to defend himself, Mark shrunk further and further away from him, “Mark I love her! I still love her! It wasn’t like that! She was a half sister! And we met when I was a teenager, and she was older! I love her Mark and someone killed her!” Mark had clearly decided enough was enough and he said “good day to you gentlemen” before leaving the room to then subsequently leave the building. Henry said “Mark?!” over and over again until he had left the room. Henry turned panic towards Holmes and Watson, he said limply, “you can’t question me without a lawyer, it is against the…” this time it was John that was irritated, “for gods sake mister Scott, be your own lawyer, you know this game, we, like you just want to be aware of what happened to your sister, clearly you want us to find out who did it otherwise you would never have given us this letter!” Then a light bulb went off in John’s head.
Sherlock nodded and interrupted, “back to him later, do continue.” John nodded back and did just that, “the letter informed us of the death, the smuggling and some stuff about its author, next was the visit to the morgue, she had bruising in certain places, suggesting she was bound, we concluded she died of shock, her heart gave out, then we went to her house, nice, clean, full of books, and the beehives, she was dedicated, clever, then we found the other letters, from her father and one from whoever anonymous is, for the writing was the same…” Sherlock interrupted a second time, “
“I must be honest Watson, the lasagna looks rather disappointing.” Said Sherlock whilst poking at it lamely with his fork.
The taxi was hot. All Sherlock could do was think of John. Where was he. What had they done with him. He needed to figure this out and he needed to figure it out now. "Shut up and think" he said to the air. The taxi driver was concerned. This guy looked well dressed but was clearly a loon, he wanted to drop him off as soon as possible. Sherlock unaware of his drivers concern, shut his eyes hard and felt his mind race. Connecting the dots before he even could. The victim, Paul Delaney, he was arrogant, asking for too much. His pattern was greed and pride. The man went after what he wanted and felt like he would not be stopped. This was established. They had seen that back in England. Oh how Sherlock missed England. John WILL not die in France was his overall emotion. Stop. Stop thinking of John and solve this. He punched his leg hard and brought himself back. Back to the case. The case. Paul was a patriot. White supremacist with a Christian agenda. Homophobic. Divorced. The man was not likable. Rich, alcoholic, his face was purple. His stomach had nothing in it but drink. But who would kill him? Who. Think Sherlock. The DuPont fortune. Who else got that money. Who else.
“It’s of £100’000, for around a month ago." Sherlock stopped pacing. “That’ll be just before the letters in Mandarin arrived here. That’s the big pay out. She wanted more than that. Is that the last pay out?”
They collected their bags from the oval shaped bag collection point and sauntered thorough the unfamiliar faces and environment with an unbelievable confidence. Maybe it was the remaining pangs of alcohol, but the confidence that surged through John was something he had never felt before. They entered the departures lounge looking as if they would fit in a James Bond film, and proceeded to look for a sign with their names on it. There was a Chinese man in a very suave suit and white ray ban sunglasses bearing an Ipad saying “Watson & Holmes.” They shook the mans’ hand and followed him to the Mercedes SLK limozine.
The three walked in a line, Sherlock in the middle, John to his left, closer to in-land, Olivia to the right, closer to the very waves that washed up the body and therefore closer to death itself. They walked parallel to the beach, looking at the full expanse of the westerly coastline in now largely a pale moonlight. It was only until the crunch of stones was beneath their shoes as they met the beach that Olivia began her prepared words, "Mister Holmes, and erm Doctor Watson, thank you so much for coming, we do have a small team here for this sort of thing, but they are all stumped, we are not used to this kind of work, any of it, you know, we deal with stolen bins and missing cats and that sort of thing, we just don't know what we are doing." She was clearly overwhelmed. Her nervous babbling progressed, "and this being so big and all, we only knew that this man was Paul Delaney because the lady that found him was a woman, Sandra, who had spent a lot of time in the states, she said this chap was a bit infamous, we haven't run no tests, or moved nothing." John did listen, and he did actually sympathise, but Sherlock did not hear a word, right then his sole focus was the little white tent that rested about half way up the beach maybe another two hundred metres away. The light reflecting off the moon, lit the tent like some kind of beacon, it's whiteness echoing along the sand. It stuck out like a smile at a funeral, and even John found himself very drawn to it, like a distant fire on a cold night. As they got closer both men picked up the pace, anxious to hone whatever was inside. Olivia did keep talking but even John now could not hear anything. He thought, 'i'm sure you are a very nice person but I really cannot focus on you right now.' Her mouth was moving and she was walking very fast to keep up but she was not a part of this duo.
John physically sunk into his seat and placed his hands over his mouth. “Oh John lighten up, this is what normal people do, that’s what you want right? To be like everyone else, or for me to be like everyone else or something. People drink on planes, you wanted a consequence we have a consequence. We have...”  Sherlock looked at his watch and said, “five hours and forty-five minutes left on this plane. Let’s not be boring. Now I believe you have a question to answer.”
Of course John would notice. Sherlock was secretly pleased. It was a test in any case. John smiled after he made his move, “Sherlock you bastard.” John began to laugh. “Well’s that plan A out of the window. Good move detective.”
"Sociopaths typically emotionally destroy those that are close to them, we feel a sense of entitlement, of which normally comes from rage, a deep underlying psychological rage, it means we act in a way that nothing is off the cards, anything could happen when around a sociopath, especially a high functioning one, we are the pinnacle of Machiavellian nature and all we want is success John," Sherlock wrung his hands as he spoke, "usually sociopaths and kind, trusting people don't get along and find each others company a nuisance, so theory one, you are neither kind nor trusting," John rubbed his eyes as if temporary blindness would somehow make his sense of hearing better, "theory two, whilst unlikely, I am a selective sociopath, theory three, I am a sociopath, however, in the chase of a cure, in various studies it has been proven that whilst sociopaths do not respond to punishment, we do respond to incentives, and somehow you have provided me with such things, or you yourself are the incentive John."
diag-nonsense, facing one another as he did so. "That makes me very happy and proud to hear you say such a thing detective." Sherlock fiddled with the hem of his coat, "oh yeah?" Moments shared happiness was embellished with a question, "you want to talk about anything else?"
John walked to stand opposite Sherlock so that the dead woman was in between them. It had been a while since John had seen a dead body, and he had to confess he’d never seen one this decayed before. The dead he’s been around had always been fresh, almost as if in sleep. Yet the woman before him had been dead for seven days, almost eight. Her jaw had started to hang loose, her skin was clearly dry and tight, and there was a definite aroma.
“Erm right well, Sherlock do you think we should be leaving? I’ll drive you back to Baker Street not a problem, besides we have a lot to catch up on, well Mary if you need…”
He stood and walked towards John, Sherlock put John’s face in between his hands and squeezed his cheeks together as if he were a little boy who had put something into his mouth that he wasn’t supposed to, like a piece of Lego or glue. “John, this is very important, these painted-white-to-be-pleasing devices are the source of my imagination for years, they are bee hives, the home of the intricate living that are bees. Their whole world exists in these boxes. Their hierarchy, matriarchy and work lay in these, and there are thousands of them in each box. These innocent in appearance containers bear something that is very dear to me, and at this point in time something that was also dear to Eleanor. If she kept bees, she was meticulous. Methodical. No victim John, but a player.”
John simply twitched his nose and nodded. The men began to step towards John and Sherlock, but John went against the plan, “wait,” he said, without hesitance and with visible strength.
Sherlock watched as John headed for the entrance to St. Bart’s’ West wing. Sherlock had to practically run to catch up with his doctor. For Sherlock this is all he had ever wanted, a smart person to confide in about cases, to have some ideas that don’t have to rely to come from him. Sherlock really didn’t want to lose this, if this went awry and John left, Sherlock would feel even more lonely than before, and Sherlock would often feel so lonely he that he would sleep on the sofa in fear that he would go to bed and die in his sleep because his heart would fail from loneliness.
John and Sherlock are still on China but Sherlock needs answers about the case of Eleanor Scott that only Lestrade can answer.
“Mycroft I was only a child, a confused and desperate child, please don’t use it against me like this. I accept that I often require some form of drug to stimulate something other, something unbeknown to me, it’s my head, it runs and runs and sometimes I need it to stop. You and I both know that. Work is all I need, I understand your concern, well actually admittedly I don’t, but you appear to possess it anyway, like the weak idiot you are. Rehab is for those who have nothing else. I have my work and if I leave, people will die and cases will remain unsolved. I cannot leave my work.”
John moved from sitting to lying in a very awkward manner, and with one hand attached to the bed by cuffs he could do nothing but lay uncomfortably, but at least he was lying down. Almost instantly he crashed into a very deep sleep, for as of right now unconsciousness was all he craved, and he had not slept for a very long time.
However, Lestrade stood before him. Hearing of a booking from a ‘mister John Watson’ being involved, Lestrade had to come. He had not heard from John in a while, but he always thought Sherlock would have been appreciative if he helped him out. Now he stood dumbstruck. Mouth gaping. Sherlock was now so unsure of what to do. This had all gone wrong. Greg didn’t disappoint him though. He did exactly what Sherlock thought John would do, Lestrade hugged him. With the words ‘you bastard’ it appeared that all was forgiven between them. John was more hurt by the whole affair it seems. Something Sherlock had realised arguably too late.
At this stage all of the flight attendants where trying to pick John up to get him back into his seat. Once they managed they buckled both he and Sherlock into their seats, as you would imagine a parent would buckle a small child in to reduce as much havoc as possible. They still hysterically laughed for the next eight minutes. Once they calmed down, wiped the tears from their cheeks for the second time in this flight, the female flight attendant informed them, “there is still four hours of this flight left, that is enough time to, erm, to sober up,” she laughed nervously, “if you could maybe pay your bill now?”
John and Sherlock reach Calais, on finding the murder suspects boat, they devise a plan on how to enter such a vessel for their investigation, the only problem is that in order to do so, they may have to pretend to be bound till' death do us part...
“Well Sherlock I think you’ll find (* hiccup *) I am very good in the bedroom. Most memories I have of any sexual encounter are phenomenal to say the (* hiccup *) least.” When Sherlock went to reply, the same air-hostess who had been serving them their drinks the entire time wandered over and said, quite concerned, “Sirs, I have to tell you that we cannot legally provide you with anymore alcohol, drunken behaviour on arrival is an arrest-able offence. So…” She was interrupted by the eruption of laughter that came from the two drunken men. They could not stop laughing, to the point where John fell off his seat into the aisle, which made Sherlock and he laugh even more. Sherlock had his knees up to his chin in an effort to try and make himself breathe.It probably wasn't even her words, they just couldn't help it.
On arriving at 221b John commented on its prime location and other tattle that Sherlock generally ignored. He admired Speedy’s café and how it would be great for hangovers and such of that nature. Sherlock just gave the occasional ‘hmm’ whilst reminding John to pay, unpacking the car with their small number of possessions and finally unlocking the front door. The gold knocker was at it’s usual ajar, meaning that Mycroft wasn’t in, much to Sherlock’s relief. As John entered behind Sherlock grinning ear to ear, Sherlock called for Mrs. Hudson.
The two of them had drunk that much in only an hour and forty-five minutes, no wonder they were shit-faced. Sherlock still swaying and blushed from their laughing pulled the wallet out of his jacket, John went to protest but was too drunk to take any genuine action; he could barely lift his head from the head rest. Sherlock handed over one of his several cards to which John just uttered the word “money” as if drunk he had made an association and just had no other choice but to say the word. They paid for their drinks and by the time the woman went to hand back the card the two buckled in men were fast asleep. The lady smiled with relief and placed the card on the moveable tray in front of Sherlock for him to find when he woke up.
“No, but I know a bluff when I see one.” The unflinching manner and the growl John could feel in his belly was a strength he had no idea where it was coming from. But he had to admit, he liked it. The boss laughed and breathed through his cigar. “Well, we did not kill her Doctor.”
Sherlock placed clenched fists on the desk and moved his whole form down to be eye level with Lestrade.
On reaching the room he felt a feeling of relief. He placed his things down on the old wooden floor and immediately removed his shoes and socks to feel the cold floor under his toes. He flexed those ten digits as if it was like taking a very deep satisfying breath. He took his jacket off and flung down on the bed before returning bare foot to where Sherlock waited in their living room, reading through a letter that had apparently been sitting on the living room floor pushed under the front door for all of five days.
John sighed. “Come on Sherlock, he’ll just take us to the case and then you can out deduce him until he gives up and leaves?”
Mycroft let out a slight disappointed chuckle. “Isn’t it obvious you need it? Your intelligence is suffering from it Sherlock, you believe it aids it, somehow you’ve convinced yourself that it makes you work better, but a high does nothing but lie to you Sherlock. Before long your brain will be nothing but scrambled egg, and one day you’ll come to me like you did all those years before and ask me to end your life because you were too much of a coward to do it yourself. I didn’t do it then, and I will not do it now. I am not going to sit by and watch you become a vegetable, a goldfish, you are so much more than that brother.”
Sherlock had his hands around his coat collar held close to the skin on his throat as if something was going to strike any second. He was attempting to make deductions about the place and Dr. Watson himself but he was currently on a bit of a come down and it was proving to make things rather difficult. His deductions were more like benign assumptions at this stage. They entered a room right at the end of the corridor to the left. The sign next to it read ‘Dr. John Watson, rehabilitation expert.’ Sherlock rolled his eyes. Books lined the walls on either side of the doorframe for at least two meters into the room. They were sectioned and alphabetized under certain categories. The first was all alcohol related, the next parts were all dedicated to different drugs, all of which Sherlock had tried. John caught Sherlock eyeing the shelves quite intently. “Ah so I see you’ve spotted my weakness Sherlock. Can I call you Sherlock?”
Sherlock took a deep breath, the first intake he had taken for a very fast minute or so, John sat back, his mind whizzing. Sherlock did not like the silence. Had he said too much? He had definitely said a lot, it washed out of him like a river and John was the rock sat in the water unable to move despite the racing current that seethed about him. Maybe it was overbearing, oh fuck it was overbearing wasn't it. Fuck fuck fuck, Sherlock felt himself internally panic, his oesophagus tied it a knot in his throat and his breathing stifled. Then John said the best possible words, "well we have hours until the sun comes up, and clearly you've been thinking about this a lot, what kind of experiments do you suggest?"
John hurriedly got his life back together once security checks were over; he put on his belt, got his shoes back on, collected their things, and on pushing Sherlock in the departure lounge he definitely felt safer. Surely they couldn’t have monitors through security? If they went through security then the only way to leave is to fly? Right? The monitors would have seen them exit security, and gone back to their hive to inform mister clinically insane crime boss that they had gone and all was well. Or at least that is what John was telling himself.
“John, sentiment is for the losing side, his daughter died, many people just died, we all die eventually, I told him that as a tactic, he wasn’t involved, his response suggests he genuinely didn’t know of her involvement, not even a clue, the pitch of his voice and the general tone and emotion fueled words tell us that, now we know for definite that he isn’t anonymous, and that more than likely he didn’t kill her. We can tick him off. See, John I’m working.” With that Sherlock picked up the chalk and crossed through
John stroked his brow with the letter-free hand. “And what’s with all the ‘I have a contact with Scotland Yard?’ How can you even do that?”
"I think we should pick them up, put them in 221c, leave a window open a little bit, then you can have bees then?"
They both took a sip before Sherlock said "John we need to think tactics, brother in interview." John nodded enthusiastically and made several 'hmm' noises in agreement. Sherlock continued, "this is a man who has been involved in the smuggling lark, he knows partially what he is doing, also to have an incest relationship you need to be, well a particular kind of person." John interrupted "hm yes, bat shit crazy." Sherlock and he giggled once more, such a relief, to be giggling properly, together again. Sherlock and John were beginning to leave the stress behind them, it ebbed from their now clean skin (airport showers) and their words were much more freeing than the previous fortnight or so. What with the gangs threats looming over them and Sherlock's nonstop pain. That was all starting to be a part of the past, their past. Now it was on to better things, and both parties were more than pleased to be back on the case, especially with resolution to the case in sight.
Sherlock himself was caught out by the mood, the atmosphere John was creating, it was a joy Sherlock had never personally experienced himself. “I didn’t do anything John, it can’t have been anything I did!”
With that Sherlock hit the 'reply' arrow button and sent the single word 'coming.' John saw the word being written out and then sent and he felt butterflies in his belly. He rolled his fingers against his palms twice and watched the detective race to his room to assumedly finally get dressed. John saw clothes being thrown everywhere but not the detective actually dress. Without seeing Sherlock he asked, "who's Reverend Paul Delaney?" An admittedly out of breath Sherlock shouted back, "he was a governor for the state of Alabama." John made an audible gasp and he too raced to his own room to pack a bag. This was big. A case that spread internationally, even more so than their first and last case. John had a million questions immediately. Within another one-hundred and twenty seconds, the pair met in the kitchen prepared to go. Sherlock asked "ready?" John nodded and with that they were out the door headed to Kings Cross train station to go to the town of Minehead.
The building was large, almost prehistoric with its layout. You can easily imagine this building being used as a temporary hospital during the Blitz. The large red brick walls encased a long corridor with private rooms divvied off of it. Most of the carved wooden doors were closed filled with secrets and personal stories of a troubled life pre-rehab. The only things modern about the place were the signs allocating the different sections of the rehabilitation facilities. Obnoxious and plastic they read things like ‘therapy room, Dr. Philbert’ or ‘MRI’ or ‘liver analysis ward.’ God it smelt awful. Smelt like sobriety.
John’s jaw had dropped the entire time, and whilst Sherlock’s hands moved continuously to match the flow of his words, John could look nowhere but his eyes. They had come alive once more; so different from when he first walked in.
On their way to a case John teaches Sherlock the importance of the sea, and they truly appreciate one another in the mutual newness that engulfs them.
It was approaching nine in the morning, their included breakfast ended in an hour or so. On exiting the bathroom and pulling on his socks and shoes John said, "Sherlock we must be going, otherwise we'll be hungry," practically immediately after, his tummy rumbled, thus proving his point. "Yes doctor, fine fine, head down without me, I'll be straight behind" the detective spoke cooly as he still remained sat down, shoes now tied, flicking through his phone. John stood and thrummed his fingers upon his palms, anxious for Sherlock to change his mind, but he didn't so John grabbed his phone and coat and headed down for breakfast alone. At the floor lobby John decided to walk down the three flights of stairs rather than wait for the lift. On reaching ground floor, it was evident the place was busy, very busy. The place was teeming with people, all smartly dressed and eating quickly to get the day started. John didn't take much notice and met the young man who was seating guests at breakfast. "Name?" the stranger asked, John paused before saying, "Holmes," the man nodded before showing John to a bay window table, which had appropriately two seats. Once at the table the waiter asked if he'd like tea or coffee, John chose a very British option one. Milk only. Just as John sat down, a voice from behind him said, "I do apologise but did you say your name was Holmes?" John turned around to be greeted with a man he recognised immediately as someone from off of the telly, a reporter for Channel Four News if his memory was right, "erm actually no, but I am here with a Mister Holmes, he should be down any minute, anything I can help you with?" John asked politely. "Is it Sherlock Holmes by any chance?" John laughed and nodded alongside a nervous giggle, "is he here for the Delaney murder?" John hesitated, he should not have got involved, why the hell did he nod?! This man was a reporter, one with arguable influence over an international story such as this, he chose to protect his friend, not the professional, "who's that?" The reporter made a funny sigh before candidly saying, "maybe he just doesn't tell his boyfriend everything." John's face arched confused, "boyfriend?" The reporter visibly blushed, "oh I do apologise I just assumed...," now John realised in horror and reacted so, "no I'm not... we're not, I work with mister Holmes, it's not.." In his panic, John seemed to have put his foot in it, "work with him? So you are here for Delaney! So who murdered him?!" John deepened his foot print further, "what makes you think it's murder?!" The reporters face stretched out in pure joy, "so it is murder!"
Michael then hung up the phone, and John stopped trying to grab the phone off Sherlock. John rubbed his hands on his forehead in an attempt to calm himself down; it didn’t work. “Sherlock what the HELL are you doing?! His daughter was just murdered and you just called and told him all that! What if he goes round telling people?! And just, HIS DAUGHTER JUST DIED.” Sherlock had placed his phone back in his pocket and was now smoothing down the front of his suit jacket.
Sherlock is told that he has to remain in hospital for a few more days and boy is he furious. He asks one thing of John and one thing only.
Sherlock sat on his side, with the white chess pieces stoically placed in front of him atop the piece of checkered wood.
Sherlock ignored the antics of his brother, most of which were to upset him anyway, but he didn't want to go either. It wasn't the flying, at least he didn't think it was. It wasn't the destination either. All he could feel was that he wanted to be with Redbeard, he wanted to sit with his friend and talk to him. Talk to him like he could no one else. Get grassy knees and a slobbery face. Why could he not come. Surely they could have let him on the plane somehow. Redbeard was better than most people Sherlock thought. As they turned the final corner to their gate, Sherlock felt hot tears well out his eyes and down onto his mothers cardigan. He wanted his puppy. They were the last ones to board, but they made it on. Mycroft was plopped into his seat and he shuffled uncomfortably until his freshly pressed trousers were creased. Sherlock angrily kicked the seat in front as soon as he was sat down. "Sherlock, stop. You know better, would you like it if someone was kicking your seat?" his mother asked. He stopped and let his feet dangle in the air. As all family members sat and buckled up, Sherlock was offered some comfort. "I know you want Redbeard sweetheart, I know you miss him, but he'll be fine, of course he will, he's a good boy, and we'll bring him something back, he'll be very pleased with you darling, hey?" She stroked her youngest sons head until he relaxed slightly. The plane started to move to its starting position when the crew addressed the flyers,
Nearing the exit Sherlock shouted, “John I need a yellow pages, we need to know everything about the woman! Who she knew, who she worked with, who she loved, hated, all of it.” John breathily replied “Why are you running for a yellow pages?!”
The landing was smooth. So much so that the two relaxed gentlemen barely even noticed the plane make contact with the tarmac. Such a knock better befitted a speed bump in a hummer. Both men actually slept for most of the long haul flight, so were strangely refreshed. Although the past two weeks had had a definitive strain. Less than a month on the job and John already felt like a holiday. They hastily collected their bags and Sherlock could not wipe the smile off his face. On walking through the automatic doors at 'arrivals' Sherlock even did a little twirl and said to John "breathe it in John! London!" John just laughed. He too was very relieved and did share Sherlock's excitement.
The surgery was without a doubt a success, and once more John was impressed by the standards and ethical practice of this place. Everything about it was alien, practically no one here spoke English yet they knew the human body regardless of where it came like a children's maze. It was all easy, and completely unfazeable, it made John proud to call himself a doctor. He wished all doctors unanimously practiced this way on an international scale. Like clock work, nothing to worry about. As Sherlock departed the four walled surgery into no mans land, once more John returned to Sherlock's bedside awaiting his return. He decided that regardless of what was to happen, he had to ensure that no matter what he wanted to remain by Sherlock's beside, as only friend or more. Even then John didn't want to risk it, he wanted to be here with him, wherever here was he didn't care. As long as he was with
Sherlock and John are finally flying back to London to reemerse themselves in this open ended case that is Eleanor Scott. On the flight they joke, discuss tactics and John goes over his feelings for Sherlock and what they mean.
Mary kept her face calm and she yawned for affect. “John, honestly you have just got your friend back from the dead, be guilty for once. Go out with your friend.”
Sherlock slouched in his chair, not wanting to admit defeat however it seems that this game of chess had not gone to plan.
Sherlock pulled his eyebrows into close collision with one another and pulled his head back like a confused dog, John explained himself immediately, "I'm sorry but for such a clever man you are thick." Sherlock pulled his head back even further now, completely unprepared for insult, "Theory four, you are not a sociopath." John said, imitating Sherlock as he did so, "that's not even remotely like me" Sherlock huffed. "That's not even remotely like me" John repeated in a very flourished fashion, making Sherlock go for a soft punch to Johns arm whilst telling him to "fuck off." John snickered, as he finished the second whisky, he felt the alcohol beginning to get to him. His fingertips seemed to hum under their nails and he felt the disconnection heading his way, "another two whiskies please" he half shouted. Again they were on the table in what felt like no effort at all. As John sniffed his fourth beverage of the night, Sherlock picked up his own whilst he watched his companion, "how could I not be a sociopath?"
They spent their days together, and even some nights, the nights that Sherlock was finding drug withdrawal particularly difficult, but during their days they would chat and do a bit of Sherlock's paperwork as fast as possible. They'd talk about everything, from the unimportant to the dark things. Sherlock’s worst case, John’s worst army experience, Childhood memories and what John was to expect in joining Sherlock on cases. On the eleventh day it was as if John and Sherlock had run out of things to discuss, so they sat and read. Mostly in silence but sometimes they’d read certain passages to each other which would lead to brief discussions, but mostly the silence was something they both thoroughly enjoyed.
“Actually, Lestrade, Greg, sorry, I think Sherlock should wait until John wakes up, erm, maybe they should give it a second go?”
They both thought Sherlock was a good man, despite what the man in question and apparently the rest of the world said. They walked in silence to the interview rooms. There was a door along from Lestrades’ office, which looked perfectly bland; a secret disguise was created by its plainness. However on closer inspection there was an electronic tag system screwed to the wall on the left of the doors metal and curved handle; sticky with perspiration, from the previous person who opened it. Lestrade had to use a key card to gain access. And on opening the door, John noted a smell that reminded him of the library he used to go in as a child. A large ancient building, with its millions of recycled and mostly unwanted literature. It smelled like peppermint tea and old people. That is what the corridor to the interview rooms smelt like. Once the door squeaked close behind them, Lestrade gestured with an out stretched open palm towards a door on the right, at the very end of the corridor. This too also needed a key card to gain entrance.
“Sherlock no listen to me okay, I am not sure of what I am about to hear, nor that I will necessarily like what I will hear and I know that you struggled, struggle, with how you phrase things, particularly sensitive subjects however I would appreciate it if you spoke with a, with an erm well controlled tongue and I mean I guess, what I want to say that I am glad you are here, irrevocably glad it has been a dream of mine, well I mean ever since you… ever since you.” John’s sigh reverberated around the room.
The woman across from John typed something into a computer and with a confused look on her face said, “you are not supposed to be leaving until next week?”
Therapy truly commences and Sherlock and Dr. Watson discuss Sherlock's apparent need for drug use. Who knows, it may even end in a game of chess? ;)
“Well even though those five people are strangers, that doesn’t make them any less important than my ‘loved’ one. Besides they might be parents with children, or a leading doctor whose death would cause hundreds of other people to die. Sure I would be sad, and the rest of my family and friends would most likely struggle to understand, if they knew. My life would be ruined, but that is one persons life rather than the potential hundreds associated with those five.” Sherlock nodded and there was a moment’s silence before John continued, rather shyly in his tone, “Besides it probably helps that I don’t have a particular someone to envision as that one person. It makes me more detached from the scenario I suppose.”
John and Sherlock now had less than two hours to get out of the country. On arriving at the airport John looked anxiously around to spot the ‘monitors’ the masked men had spoke of. So much so that he nearly forgot to pay the taxi driver. John uttered an apology and handed him over way too much and before the driver had time to question the amount, John had painfully placed Sherlock into the wheelchair and was essentially sprinting him into the terminal.
“Well this account looks like it was the input, they pumped her pay into this account, and it’s as anonymous said, between 20’000 and 60’000 pounds, always, bar one.” Sherlock placed his hands into the steeple position under his chin and continued to walk backwards and forwards. Then asking “regularity?”
He heard nothing and felt everything. His stomach tied into a knot at his trachea and he couldn’t breathe. Could not hear, could not do anything other than fall.
Without missing a beat John threw down the paper and stood up and went to leave the room, "John where are you going?"
Both of them were admittedly still quite drunk, however they were in between a good night out and being the most hung-over anyone has ever been. Which made the realization of what was to come resentful to say the least. John went to speak again but found his mouth immensely dry. Thank fully the woman who charged them for the drinks had seen ahead and placed two small bottles of water on their trays. John opened the bottle and downed the whole thing. Just the act made him realize how much he needed a wee.
John scrambled to find his shoes and coat. He hobbled down one set of stairs from his room trying to get his left shoe on and he hobbled down the next set of stairs in an attempt to get on the right. On reaching and shutting the front door of his new residence he turned to face Sherlock who was already holding a taxicab door open. Without any hesitation John jumped into the cab and thanked Sherlock, which Sherlock apparently ignored before defiantly informing the driver that they were going to “St. Barts, morgue entrance on the west side” before sitting back in his seat and staring out the window not facing John.
John unbuttoned the detective’s shirt as fast as his hands could move, and what he found underneath was more than alarming. The shirt had to be pealed away from the skin, all the blood and sweat had made a sort of glue between fabric and flesh. That action alone made Sherlock hiss through his teeth.
John scowled and Sherlock gave a non-chalent "relax Watson, relax, we are going home." He patted John thrice upon the knee and it made John smile. Sherlock knew him so well in such a short space of time. He was right, John told himself to relax and took a deep breath and with that a beverage was in his hand. Hopefully they'd make it home this time.
“Sherlock, I don’t think this kind of sitting therapy is going to work for you, you need more, you are so much more. Your body needs a rest though, so I say stay here for a week or two, we need to get your weight up, during that time we can do whatever you like within these walls, we can talk, read, play chess whatever, but when I deem you physically fit, I think you should take me on a case.”
Sherlock shuffled uncomfortably in his apparent near nakedness. Even though he hated to admit it, he did fear death. He knew that logically nothing lay beyond death; nothing awaited him once he was in his coffin. There was no enlightenment to find, he didn’t even fear the act of dying. It was the ceasing to exist, the nothing. The fact that his head would no longer run. Sometimes a non-spinning mind is what he has craved, which may be why he uses. But for it to never run ever again, no thinking or moving pieces around in his magical palace. No he wouldn’t die from overdose. That wouldn’t do. He’d die solving a case, drug free meaning his mind is fully functional. He’d die thinking about hard difficult things that normal people avoid with their meager distractions. When he dies his brain will be at 100%. No drugs it is.
The faceless men took the rope from their ankles, told them to do “nothing bold” before untying their hands. They held guns in their direction before all backing out of the room. The last words they received from this group were “pack and leave. We will have monitors at the airport, you have four hours.” The door was closed, and for the first time in god knows how long they were truly alone. No CCTV, no crows, nothing. John could have once more wept but it was not over yet.
“It’s a private practice of course, I’ll pay for it all, and you won’t have to see anyone other than the Doctor you are assigned. He’s the best in his trade.”
Sherlock moved his hand from his mouth to point at the page furthest on the left in one swift movement, chin lowering in preparation. "See that one?" Sherlock practically whispered, John nodded a single nod, shuffling his feet in order to feel more ready. "It details a..." As Sherlock was just about to begin, the French man appeared at the door, a second cigarette smoking on lip, hands holding the frame in a tight grip, "venez, you going to be much more?" Sherlock lost it and his voice escalated to a loudness that would have made the wind change its course, "Yes we are, now go!" Normally John would have attempted to correct his behaviour, yet the game was on and all the mattered now was what was on those bloody pages. "Alle! Vous ne pouvez pas me parler comme ça!" He was evidently upset, Sherlock retorted back in perfect French, the deceit was over, "cela est une affaire de police si vous ne descendez pas ce putain de bateau, je vais vous jeter par-dessus bord, puis les autorités britanniques ont fermé votre quai bas pour toujours, tu comprends?" John had to stop himself from laughing, he had no idea what was just said but God it was fantastic. The man nodded fervently and his eyes spread wide like a rabbit caught in headlights, he left almost instantaneously. "You speak French?!" Sherlock rolled his eyes, "what the bloody hell did you say?" the taller man smiled now, "fuck off." John began laughing hysterically, the seriousness of before was all but gone and even Sherlock giggled momentarily.
Sherlock reached forwards with his left fingertips and moved a pawn piece from E2 to E4. “Do you know why chess was invented John?”
On coming up to the glass he was glad and both terrified that he couldn’t see Sherlock’s face. It was turned away, facing the furthest wall. He had tubes up his nose and blood was draining from his nostrils. He had an oxygen mask hovering over his face above all the tubes and the nonsense, but to John’s delight he could see Sherlock’s breath fogging up the plastic mask. They were about to start a chest tube insertion. Sherlock’s arm was pushed upwards so that his entire left flank was exposed. A small incision had been made and a tube had been entered just below his armpit not too far from the nipple. The tube was being funneled through to drain the lung of fluid. It appeared to be working to. Whilst this was going on another person was re-stitching the entire temporary stitches John had made back at the hotel that felt like forever ago, and simultaneously a further two people where making an incision into Sherlock’s front. Immediately John knew what they were doing and he was happy with their decision. With a hot piece of metal they then fused the broken lung tissue together to form a scar but a seal. It was Sherlock’s ribs that were the real mess. The two lowest ribs were completely shattered, and were just removed entirely. The two above those appeared to be fractured. John knew that only time would heal those. They re-stitched Sherlock up and now started preparing for post-op. Sherlock was okay. He was actually going to be okay. John had been standing there for what felt like five minutes, and when Sherlock was pushed out of the doors, once more out of view, John looked up at the large clock in the surgery beyond the glass, and in actuality he had been there for over three hours.

Sherlock could barely eat anything the next morning. He was supposed to meet John in his office at 11am but he was so weak. So at ten minutes past the hour Dr. Watson appeared at the door. “I never expected Detective Sherlock Holmes to be a late man.”
Sherlock scoffed a laugh and John continued in the chase to further that merry noise, "it doesn't need to be big, it's not about size, a tiny cupid of a crab will do." Sherlock looked up from the rocks at his feet to catch eyes with the frankly ridiculous doctor he'd now proudly call a friend. He admitted defeat. "Alright John, you are clearly the expert, where do we start?" John smiled and excitedly tucked the file and photographs into his coat before zipping them in secure. He then rubbed his hands together before bending down to untie his laces. Head as close as possible to his feet John huffed out a "well, first of all, we simply must be bare foot." Sherlock rolled his eyes, pleasant at the humour this direction was continuing, "oh must we now" was sarcastically strung out from between his teeth. John with one foot now bare, removed sock shoved into its allocated shoe, a defiant "yes" brazenly reaped the sound waves. With that John bent down to remove his second shoe and sock whilst Sherlock followed, being purposefully slow which caused John to be bouncing impatiently on the flat ancient stone as he waited for the detective to also be barefoot. Once all twenty toes were free Sherlock placed his shoes next to Johns. "Follow me" John said with all the youth that befitted this activity, Sherlock followed, smile forcing its way upon his mouth. He led Sherlock to a rock pool maybe ten feet away from their abandoned foot wear, it was full of large stones that would require some determination to shift, but theoretically was possible. John dipped in a toe, the water was warm due its time apart from the tide, which was a good sign. There was seaweed around the edges, another good sign. Like a children's television presenter, John asked, "so Sherlock do you think this pool will hold us some crabs?" Sherlock began to laugh and said in a high pitched disbelieving voice, "oh for fucks sake John." This made John laugh now, alongside which he said, "shh! You'll scare the crabs away." Sherlock funnily cussed some more as John began his 'hunt.' He stepped daintily into the ankle deep water, the bottom of his jeans touched the waters surface, but he didn't care; this is what this was about.
Of course, Sherlock wanted John to be in this moment for as long as possible, never before has he heard such praise.
Ask yourself what they are, point your mind to a star, or maybe there's no need to look that far, place your ideas in a jar and try your hardest to tackle the tsar...
"Whilst I was not in fact born out of wedlock, I am in fact silly" Sherlock held up a hand and said rather loudly, "Air hostess, two Gin and Tonics please!"
“Well detective bring it on. I have spent many days playing chess and I too am competitive.” John rose from his chair and stroll to his desk that lay consumed by the left side of the extensive book collection. He bent over with one leg straight in the air in order to keep his balance, whilst pulling what appeared to be a large foldable chest set from under the desk; there must have been a hidden shelf under the initial wooden paneling, for he didn’t bend down low enough to enter one of the cupboards on the side or even to where it could have rested upon the light wooden panels on the floor.
Once Sherlock ended his speech John spluttered, “Sherlock that was amazing, you are amazing, yes! Yes to everything! What’s my move?”
John sighed and rubbed his eyes before pinching the top of his nose. John turned the hazard lights on and then took a deep breath and got out the car, slamming it shut. The motorway was loud and cars whizzed past completely ignorant of John and Sherlock. John climbed the boggy hill and on getting closer to Sherlock he noticed he was inspecting a tall piece of grass. Twiddling it in his fingers and watching the light bounce of it. John slumped down next to him, his hands resting in his pockets in an effort to not show their nervous twitch. Their arms rested in comfortable contact and they said nothing to one another for a moment. "European Beach Grass" Sherlock mumbled. "Sorry?" asked John, watching Sherlocks long fingers flick at the tiny seeds. They watched them float on the wind to wherever they may plant themselves to fulfil their small destiny. "Ammophila Arenaria, or European Beach Grass, strange for it to be here, it's a South Africa native." John turned his gaze to Sherlocks profile, "why's it called European then?" Sherlock giggled for a single syllable, "we claim to have found it, it was brought over and planted around Europe, but it's strange for it to be here, it's used to salt water and sand." John gave a polite hum. They were being so careful of one another, in fear the other might break. John looked out to the horizon blocked by concrete, "Sherlock, I'm sorry if I, that wasn't my intention to, I..." Sherlock interrupted him, "John, I'm, i'm not very good in social situations, I never have been, I envy you you know." John pulled back his body and finally met Sherlocks eyes. "Me?!" Sherlock nodded and gave a sad smile, "Of course, you are comfortable in every environment you come across, I find being in a morgue much easier than being in a bar or well, anywhere that requires what most call 'fun.'" Sherlock said 'fun' like it was a foreign language, "I don't know Sherlock, I mean we've had fun right? For example, what about my old office, we had fun then? Or the plane journeys, well, several of the plane journeys, not the one where you passed out, that, that was definitely not fun, and what about since coming here hey? The hotel room, breakfast, for fuck sake we went crabbing like six year olds this morning!" Sherlock smiled with teeth and really listened to John's words, "Yeah exactly that was fun, and just because you don't like bars or being surrounded by extroverted strangers doesn't make you any less enjoyable to be around," Sherlock could feel himself well up, it was like a big swell rising in his chest and he attempted to force it away by staring at his leather clad feet. John continued, he knew Sherlock needed this. "it is okay to be cautious about people, it took you a while to be used to me didn't it, and look at us now? Living together, working side by side, driving to France for christ sake," Sherlock laughed and John joined in, "Sherlock you are like no one I have ever met, and for once in your life believe that is a good thing, you are like no one else and that's good, so many people would be dead if you were more like me, and you know things like what this type of grass is, if you were more like me you'd just walk on it, but you have already seen it doesn't belong here and you want to know why, and that is great, like you have said to me before, never stop asking questions, you're the same, just a much more intellectual same." There was a brief pause, a moment for Sherlock to engrain these words to the inside of his self. "and Sherlock."
As soon as John sat down and made himself comfortable, Sherlock was up on his feet again, John threw his hands in the air and huffed. One day on a case they’d had together, one day, and John had already pretty much figured how it was going to be. Sherlock began collecting things from about the flat, paper, pens and most curiously what appeared to be a very old professor style blackboard on wheels. It had a wooden frame and the board flipped over 360 degrees on particularly squeaky hinges. Sherlock pushed the ancient beast from his bedroom, with arguably a dramatic effort, and placed it in front of the sofa where John sat.
John had a brief smile before turning back to his patient. He sat daintily on the end of the bed and said “whatever I can do Mr. Holmes just let me know.”
John and Sherlock hopped off the train at Taunton Station. From here they would need to get a one hour bus to Minehead, their final stop. They talked a many number of potential theories on the train journey, who would kill an American Governor? Why? Sherlock made the crude comment of "who
John was assisted in carrying their things and they entered the hospital building in a rush. It was horrid and concrete and the sight of it was intimidating. John didn’t feel good about this place. He shook it off and as they entered the building, John was stopped from following Sherlock through a set of double doors. He began to panic and say matter of fact “no I’m going with him.”
It turned out alright in the end, John just watched the country whizz past him, and before he knew it, they were at the sea. It came around all at once. The vast expanse of the blue, merging in one moment with both the sky and the curvature of the earth. John didn't want to blink, it had been so long since he had been to the sea, he'd forgotten the feeling it provided. A reminder of how small our own self importance is and how enlightening that can be. Sherlock saw John sit up tall as soon as the water came into view and it was curious. He thought of small children and how they are when looking out of a window on a plane. Being so amazed by it all, all the life that goes on. Sherlock was envious of John in that moment, he wanted to know what that was like. To feel all of life all at once. Sherlock crossed his arms and asked in a quiet husk, "you like the sea John?"
John jokingly shook his head before placing out his hand in front of him to shake the hand of his opponent, just as he had the first time they met. Except Sherlock took his hand this time. Whilst mid-shake John said, “Well Sherlock we shouldn’t play chess ever again I don’t think.”
John and Sherlock are heading to France to solve the murder of a controversial American Politician, and part of that journey involves a ferry ride in which John doubts all that he is doing.
John giggled slightly and said, “I see we haven’t even lived together yet and you’re already taking advantage of me. Yes Sherlock I have cash.”
Sherlock looked incredibly pale and he experienced nausea shake through all his vital organs making him hunch over even more. John felt like he was flying back out to war, he sensed dread all throughout his belly and it felt as if he was some how never going to make it home. Finally the brunette perk of a woman asked, “Will you need the wheelchair?” John looked at Sherlock for a second before hesitantly suggesting, “just until we get to the gate.” She nodded and then went to type for god knows how long.
“John, the pain.” It was then that John saw what he was truly witnessing. Sherlock was sitting on the bed, exactly where John put him around ten minutes ago. He was looking the worst John had ever seen him (bearing in mind that John had sat with him through his nights of withdrawal) and his face was that of a child’s. Sherlock was slightly hunched over and he was using his left hand to clutch his collapsed in rib rage which sat on the right side of his body. His face was contorted with pain and his eyes were so full of tears John couldn’t understand how the water hadn’t reached its fill and breached to slip down his bruised cheeks, then roll over his dry lips before dropping from his chin to pool in his palms that lay beneath him. John took a deep breath and wandered over to Sherlock to kneel and take Sherlock’s free hand in his.
An extremely slow twenty minutes after arriving at the gate, they were called to board and due to the wheelchair, both Sherlock and John were allowed to board first. John could have cried with happiness when he saw that plane. They left the wheelchair at the bottom of the plane entrance steps and witnessed it be taken away by an employee of the airport whilst they ascended the steps. Sherlock nearly collapsed every other step, but by some miracle he made it to the top and even said a relieved ‘hello’ to the welcoming crewmembers on board. John could have kissed the pilots with their stupid fake tan white smiling faces. But in that moment they were Jesus coming to save John from hell itself. John saw Sherlock to his seat and did one final health check before he felt comfortable enough to go to his own seat a few rows ahead.
“If they are telling the truth John, about all of it, then clearly he must be someone high up, maybe even someone in the public eye, with lots to lose.”
John stood and once more visited the hotel fridge; he pulled out a small bottle of liqcorice-flavoured tequila. He loosened the cap before handing it to Sherlock, “here. Drink it quick, nasty stuff but it’ll ease the pain.” Even before John could finish his sentence Sherlock had downed the drink in one swift action. The vile taste made him painfully cough once he’d swallowed it all. John lightly patted Sherlock’s shoulder before finishing the collection he was on before his patient needed seen to.
