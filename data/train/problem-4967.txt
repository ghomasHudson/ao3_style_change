Steve had to do it. He had to have the alpha mate with him, otherwise, they both would be punished. Steve didn’t want to get punished again and he didn’t want the alpha to suffer because of him either.
“What about Pete?” Steve questions, brows drawing together. The apartment was too quiet; Peter was usually babbling or cooing to himself.
“When...when I said I missed you. I-Tony, I didn’t mean it. I mean, I did but...I’m sorry. I know we’re just friends.”
“Yeah! Look!” Peter pulls away and stretches one arm out, his palm upward and fingers bent in a way Steve has never seen before. Then something shoots out his son’s wrists and Steve’s eyes widen.
Steve is hesitant when he’s forced to stay in the alpha’s private quarters. He’s only been allowed in the upper level a handful of times. Most of his days are spent locked away in his room until he’s forced to be bred or give birth again.
But sometimes he wishes their roles were reversed. When they talked about having a baby, it was supposed to be Steve to get pregnant. His body was stronger and capable of carrying a baby compared to Tony’s body. Steve may be older in age but his body still resembled that of someone in their late 20s.
“Guess you were starving, huh?” Tony grins, his smile growing brighter when Peter’s eyes open and lock with his own. Their eyes are identical in shape and Tony knows the color would be the exact same. “This is crazy,” Tony whispers. “You’re my son.”
“He usually sets the table,” Bucky says as he does Peter’s usual job. Sam nods in response. “Where is he? He’s okay, right? Should I call him again?”
His son eventually latches on and nurses greedily, the sound of his suckling filling the room. Steve keeps his gaze on him, studying his tiny features. It was too early to decide who he resembled the most, but his money was on Tony. The dark hair was something he already inherited from his father, and Steve already knew he’d probably have the same matching eyes.
Not much is said between them after that. Steve takes his beer and leaves, returning to the sofas to chat with Sam again. Tony watches from the bar, wishing it didn’t have to be this way. But it was for the best.
If Tony could then he’d just hide in his lab until the baby was born. Actually, he’d prefer to stay longer. He could hide away until the kid was all grown up and off to college. Leaving the baby in Steve’s care would result in a happy childhood for the kid. They’d never be miserable.
Sam nods in understanding and pulls his husband close. “I know,” he whispers and presses a gentle kiss to the side of Bucky’s head.
Steve huffs in annoyance when he still doesn’t get a response from his husband. “Jarvis, where is he?”
He’s able to push aside his own discomfort, his focus entirely on Tony. He stays by his side, holding his hand, speaking encouraging and comforting words. It doesn’t help, at least not really, but it’s all Steve can do at this point.
“I’ll live,” Peter sighs and sags in his seat. He glances down at the lunch, the food still unappealing and he pushes it away. “Do you want to come over?” He asks, turning toward his friend. “I need to tell you something.”
As much as he appreciates the concern, Peter doesn’t want anymore condolences. It wasn’t going to bring his papa back.
Instead Happy sighs sadly and reaches out to stop Peter before they get to the door of Tony’s penthouse.
“Hey,” Tony says soothingly, pulling up another chair beside Steve and lowering himself in it. He leans closer, reaching out to rub along Steve’s shoulder. “Steve, talk to me. What’s wrong?”
“Get up,” the gruff voice of Rollins fills Steve’s ears. He remains still, unable to bring himself to comply with the command. He gets kicked again, this time a little harder. “Get. Up.”
Tony quiets down after that and decides to leave for work early. The last thing he wanted to do was upset his son even more.
Steve sighs sadly and gets up from the bed, taking the few steps it takes to get to Tony. He places both hands over Tony’s shoulders, then drags them down so that they’re both gently fisting the material of Tony’s shirt. Their eyes meet, giving each other a glimpse of the pain found in them. Their pain isn’t the same.
Peter had always been around for the training portion, but never an actual mission. The closest he got was the time he snuck onto the jet. He doesn’t regret sneaking into a mission, he regrets not doing anything to help his family when they needed him.
Tony holds up a hand to stop his son from lifting up the sleeve of his shirt to show off the bruise. “I’m good. So what are you some kind of super kid?”
Tony smiles and kisses him gently. Steve grows impatient and tries to deepen the kiss by teasing Tony’s bottom lip with his tongue. The alpha parts his lips, granting Steve access into his hot mouth.
JARVIS must be upset. It’s been two hours since the AI stopped interacting. Two hours since Tony got home and locked himself away. Two hours since he reached for the bottle.
“I can help you out,” Sam offers and Steve nods. “What do you like to do? Read, work out, watch bad tv? What’s your hobbies?”
Steve’s blood runs cold when he hears Rumlow’s gun cock. The alpha only makes it to the first step before he’s pausing and pressing his fingers to his ear, listening to an order Steve can’t hear.
Steve swallows hard and quickly wipes away the tear that rolls down his face. “He’d hurt me. Sometimes it was just a slap or a punch. Other times I would be locked in this room and...he’d just beat me. It wasn’t just him. Other alphas were tasked to hurt me until I understood my place.”
“Oh.” Steve frowns. An idea comes to mind and he smiles shyly. “What about a small party? You can have Pepper over and I’m sure Happy would like to come.”
“Obviously, Pep. Look how I came home.” Tony shuts the mirror and hands it back to Pepper. He lets out a heavy sigh and leans back in his chair. His head is still pounding. He rubs at the spot that aches. “Did Pierce say anything else?”
Tony is in the nursery when Steve returns, organizing their son’s belongings and placing a few items into an overnight bag. Steve steps into the room, brows furrowing slightly.
He’s not officially alone. His friends are there, just like they promised they would. Peter may only have one parent raising him, but he had the Avengers. And that was better.
Peter’s eyes widen at the amount placed in his hand. “Whoa! Mr. Stark, I can’t accept this. It’s too much!”
“Yeah, you’re right,” Tony says and he rises to his feet. He grabs his suit jacket and slips it over his shoulders, adjusting the front. “How do I look? Better?”
Sam lays another comforting hand on the omega’s shoulder. “It wasn’t your fault, Steve. I know you’ve probably heard that before but it’s true. Alphas like him...they’re the bad guys. I don’t want you for even a second to think you were in the wrong or you had something to do with his actions. You didn’t. You’re not the bad guy. He is.
Any other threats waiting for him back off. The men stand down, watching in shock and horror as their leader is dragged away. Pierce screams out for his men, but they hide away, ignoring his pleas.
Steve chuckles and gives Tony another kiss, pulling back when Peter stirs. Steve smiles down at him and runs his fingers through the messy curls on Peter’s head.
The ability to speak is gone. All Steve can think about is letting Tony take control and use the cuffs. He wants to test it out and see if the cuffs can hold him.
“Yes,” Bruce replies with a nod. He steps away from the exam bed to grab his tablet from off the countertop, tapping away on the screen and pulling up the data he’s entered so far. “All your pups are okay.”
“Take this seriously? What do you think I’ve been doing? We wouldn’t be going down to meet my new doctor if I wasn’t.”
“Yeah,” Steve says and unravels the wrap from his hands. He peers up at her, noticing the smile was gone. “What? Isn’t that the right thing to do?”
“T-Tony,” Steve whimpers and bites down on his bottom lip to stifle a moan. Tony continues to suck, enjoying the whines and whimpers Steve makes below him. He brings one hand up to play with the other nipple, rolling the sensitive bud between his fingers.
“Need help?” Steve decides to intervene when Tony struggles with the stove. Tony turns at the sound of Steve’s voice, his face heating up at the realization of being caught.
Peter takes another few seconds to gather himself, then he’s rushing back to the safety of the jet, excited to see the look on his papa’s face. He wonders if his papa would praise him for his bravery.
It’s not long before Steve has both of his children close and drifting off to sleep. He glances down at both of their sleeping faces, a smile forming at the sight. He loved his family. They were perfect.
Morgan is placed in Tony’s arms and is greeted with kisses and hugs. Steve makes sure to give her a kiss on the head before stepping away to finish the packing.
“This is still cool. I’ve never been in a penthouse before. I mean the compound was awesome but I never got to see anything else.”
“It’s not so bad,” Tony admits. He gestures for Steve to bring him the overnight bag he somehow managed to finish while having contractions. His water had yet to break and he was already informed by the staff that he would most likely be in for a long day. It could be worse.
They break apart when the sound of little feet padding against the floor captures their attention. Steve turns away quickly, using the bit of dishes left over in the sink to distract himself from the little boy coming into the kitchen. He doesn’t want his son to see him with tears in his eyes.
Steve gives himself a few moments before searching for his alpha. The pup was already awake, rolling around and stretching his tiny limbs. Steve smiles down at his belly, eyes transfixed on the movement his son produced.
Steve somehow finds the ability to force aside the thoughts of their future child and focus on his tasks. He has a team to run and protect; a world that is always needing saving. Thinking about the family he desperately wanted to have would have to be put on hold.
Tony gives a nonchalant shrug in response. “Don’t know yet. He might want a little vacation. Haven’t been to Bora Bora in a while.”
He’s not sure how much time he spent upstairs, but it must have been long because Jarvis interrupts to remind him of dinner and a missed call from Tony.
“You’re okay, squirt. Daddy’s gonna make you feel better alright? That’s what daddies are for.” Tony brings his son closer, pressing his lips against Peter’s head, inhaling the familiar baby scent mixed with lavender.
Peter sucks in a harsh breath and gives up on his lunch completely. If Ned wasn’t asking about Flash then he was asking about Peter’s parents. A part of Peter wanted to tell them about the predicament he’s found himself in, but the other half argues against that. It would be better if no one knew.
“Come on,” he whispers to himself and tries the lock again. His hand trembles and his vision blurs with tears, stealing another opportunity to get into his locker. He fights the urge to scream and slam his first into the locker door.
His belly tightens again and for the first time, he wonders if maybe he should start paying attention to himself.
That wasn’t an option of course. Sure he could step down and let someone else take the reins while he figured out his life and the son that was now in it. But he’s been away for so long and it was his responsibility to clean up his mess.
“Tony, it hurts!” Steve groans and clutches onto his baby bump. Tony can only nod his head as he leads Steve out of the elevator and toward the medical wing where the staff is already waiting for them.
“Why are you up?” Peter asks, plopping down beside her and reaching for the remote. He begins skimming through the channels. “Oh yeah. That thing with dad.”
It was going to take a lot to comfort James and assure him that he was safe and away from any harm. Steve doesn’t know the story behind his pups and what Pierce had done to them. A part of him isn’t sure if he even wanted to know the truth. His pups didn’t deserve any of the abuse they had endured. Steve still blames himself and wishes he could go back and prevent any harm from ever coming to them.
Tony can vividly see Steve smiling. It was a sight he was going to miss. Steve had a great smile. It was bright and always full of confidence.
“Can I kiss you?” Tony glances up just in time to find Steve nodding his head. Tony moves closer, leaning in until their lips brush together. The kiss is careful, not lasting more than a few seconds.
He had accepted that one child was all they were getting, and that was enough. Peter was their pride and joy. But a big family was something Steve wanted.
“But that’s not our son,” Steve argues and adjusts the phone to balance between his chin and shoulder while he works on gathering the trash from the bathrooms.
“I’m home!” Tony calls out once he steps through the front door. He’s not greeted like he usually is and he can’t help but frown. Steve was off and normally spent the day at home tidying or catching up on anything that needed attention. Peter should be home from school by now, but Tony doesn’t stress about his son’s absence. He was probably with Ned.
Defeated, Tony has no choice but to follow the command. Usually omega’s weren’t the ones to give orders, but this was a new world and omega’s were free to make their own choices. Steve had been deprived of that freedom for so long, and now he was gaining it. He called the shots now.
Steve sighs harshly. “I did yeah but...but I still went to my mother when something was wrong. Peter is avoiding us. Last night he didn’t even want to watch tv with us.”
Pepper bites her lip and comes over to join Steve on the sofa. She adjusts the little girl in her arms and gently brushes the strands of blond hair out of her face.
“Not right away. I know you’re hesitant to leave, but maybe in a couple of weeks we can start preparing. That kid’s gonna be here soon.”
Tony doesn’t want to say it gets easier-he still struggles with his son on occasions-but he eventually understands more of what his son wants. Tony becomes so proud of his ability to care for his son that he no longer hides behind the walls of his penthouse. He takes Peter out, showing him around the compound.
Hi! I swear I’m trying to update my stories but it’s been so hard lately. But I won’t give up! I hope you all enjoy this chapter 😊
“Okay.” Tony is forced to slide his arms off of Steve, something he hasn’t done in a long time. Steve was always allowing him to touch, even before Morgan was introduced to their lives. During the pregnancy, Steve actually encouraged Tony to feel how his body was changing. Now he was pushing him away. It hurt.
“Look at my face!” Peter points at the one of him during his first birthday and the chocolate frosting covering his cheeks and eyes.
The hand in his own squeezes and Peter opens his eyes again. The tears stream down his face. Steve’s free hand comes up to cup his son’s cheek. Peter leans into the comforting touch, and a sob escapes him.
“I’m sorry. I have a lot on my mind. Trust me a party was the last thing on it. Steve’s just happy now and he wanted to do this. And I promised after it’s over I’ll fly back and do whatever you need me to do.”
This time he does sob and Natasha quickly pulls him into a hug. He holds onto her tightly, burying his face in her chest and releasing all the sobs he tried to contain. No one even bats an eye at his behavior. They understood the pain that came with losing one of their own. But none of them would hurt more than him. They had lost a friend, a brother, a hero. But Peter lost a parent. The only parent he had.
Their lips meet again in another desperate kiss. This time Steve can’t stand the bitter taste of the alcohol and he turns his head away, only for the alpha to grip his jaw tightly and force him to meet his gaze.
Steve nods. “Yeah. I’ve been away for so long and...and I guess I thought I could move on from it, but I can’t. I still think about the people I left behind. Sometimes I wish I did things differently. At least then I wouldn’t be in this mess and I would’ve been able to spend my lifetime with them. Now they’re gone and I’m forced to live this life.”
“But you need to think about yourself, sweetheart. Maybe this is what you need. A break, and I mean a
“I don’t want to do this again,” Tony says. Steve lifts his head to meet Tony’s eyes and Tony continues, “This. I can’t. I don’t want this anymore. I hate seeing you like this. I hate...I hate all of it.”
As if on cue, Steve is emerging from the bedroom and entering the living room. He’s dressed and has his hair nicely groomed; it’s a look Tony hasn’t seen in a while. Since the baby, Steve has cared less and less about his appearance. He preferred to lounge around in his track pants and a plain t-shirt. Tony didn’t care what his husband chose to wear, but seeing him put some effort in his appearance made him wonder if he was feeling like himself again.
“Thank you!” Peter calls out after his papa leaves. With a huff he pulls out a plain white t-shirt and slips it on, frowning from how the article of clothing clings to his belly. He finds his favorite hoodie to hide the bump.
“Is this your first pregnancy, Peter?” Bruce asks, turning away from the computer to face the teenager.
Tony sighs heavily and leans back in his seat, one hand coming up to scrub harshly over his face. “Yeah. I know, buddy. Sorry. I’m just...I don’t know.”
“Wait, wait.” Steve pulls away and his eyes flicker down to the bump between them. “The baby…” he places a hand over Tony’s belly.
Tony holds up a large brown paper bag. Peter’s interest piques and he steps closer to accept the bag from his dad’s outstretched hand.
“Feel like it too,” Steve winces again. “I’m fine,” he quickly adds when he catches Tony’s lingering stare. “If it was bad I’d tell you. How many times have I come home like this?”
Happy narrows his eyes and shrugs Tony off. “You bet you do. I won’t let anyone hurt you. Even…” The beta tips his head in the directions of the stairs.
Hey! Sorry for the late updates. I just moved into my first apartment and it’s been a pain. I’m trying to find the time to update all my stories so bear with me! I appreciate your patience 😊
Steve chuckles softly and moves across the room to attend to the piles of baby clothes that desperately need a home. He works quietly on folding the clothes that are ridiculously small, only reminding him of the tiny person they’re meant for.
Steve can’t conceal the moan that escapes him when Tony enters him. Tony voices his own pleasure above him and slides in all the way.
Tony’s heart flutters at those words. They hadn’t shared those three words yet, but just because they hadn’t been said didn’t mean Tony hadn’t thought about saying them. There was no denying the way he felt for Steve. It wasn’t just trying to protect Steve and the pup anymore. Tony loved them both, more than he thought he could love anyone.
The room grows silent and for a second Steve wonders if Jarvis had abandoned him. Then before Steve can even ask his question again, the same holographic image of his son is conjured up, displaying the growing pup.
Tony doesn’t bother stopping him again when Steve makes another attempt to leave. He can feel Tony’s gaze following him, but he forces his own to remain forward. He can’t bring himself to look at him again.
He huffs and glances down at his watch. He’s only been waiting ten minutes, but it seems like longer. He blames his anxiousness on the fact that he could be meeting his dad for the very first time. It was nerve wracking.
“Not...working…” Tony groans and squeezes Steve’s arms tighter. “I want the drugs. I need the fucking drugs, Steve. She promised me.”
Tony grimaces again and moves across the room to retrieve the gun beside the fallen agent, doing his best not to step in the blood and guts near his feet.
Steve visibly stiffins. He thought he had gotten better about keeping himself together when his abuser was brought up, but just like everything else in his life, it was a work in progress.
“You should sleep,” Tony says, leaning back in the chair he’s been occupying since they returned back to Steve’s private room.
Those words only edge Steve on and he continues to pleasure his mate. He’s tempted to take the cock in his hand into his mouth, but before he can put that plan into action, Tony is reaching between them and gripping his wrist, forcing him to stop.
Natasha steps further into the room and takes a seat beside him. Her eyes fall on the picture Peter had been looking at and she smiles.
Steve realizes he hasn’t said anything, but honestly, how the hell is he supposed to respond to ‘long time no see’? He had written various letters and left hundreds of voicemails, pouring out his heart and all he gets is a pathetic greeting.
He’s already on his fourth cup of coffee by the time Pepper comes into his office to inform him of the new interns. Tony chugs his drink down, ignoring the way his assistant frowns when he spills some of it on his tie.
Steve gives a small shrug in response. “Fine. Dr. Nielsen just recommended a few things to try. He also wants me to see a therapist.”
“Yeah.” Tony nods, then he points at the image of their pup. Steve’s eyes follow and he gasps again, this time because he’s able to see the fluttering of his baby’s heart.
“I got you, sweetheart,” Tony promises and nibbles at the mark he put on Steve’s neck. The mark that symbolized their love for each other.
“I think so. I mean, you risked your life to save others. If that’s not a selfless act then I don’t know what is. She’d be proud.”
The restroom door opens and Peter gasps softly, pausing to listen and try to guess who just walked in. When he can’t determine the person by sound alone, Peter wipes his eyes quickly and tries to make himself presentable. He discards his used tissue into the toilet and flushes, then grabs his backpack and exits the stall.
“I’m sorry,” Tony apologizes. There’s no ounce of sincerity in his words. He wasn’t sorry. Not anymore.
For months he went on believing that he could never have a baby. He had eventually learned to accept it, and maybe that’s why he disregarded the signs of the life growing inside of him. But now that life was cradled in his arms.
“Pep’s good, she says hi. And Happy misses you like crazy. I think I have some serious competition.”
The lock on the door clicks and Tony takes a small step back when the door opens and Steve appears in the doorway. It’s obvious that he’s been crying. His eyes are red and slightly swollen, and his face is blotchy and stained with tears.
Peter stands proudly at the end of the line, mimicking his siblings and presenting his own shirt for Steve to read. It says: My daddy?
“Sir,” Jarvis interrupts. Tony has to fight the urge to roll his eyes and tell the AI to go away. He’s ready to do just that, but then Jarvis continues. “Miss Potts is on the line.”
“Just hang on okay? Uncle Bruce is going to fix you and…” Peter trails off when he notices his papa shake his head. “Papa…”
I had to add more Steve& Nat stuff because they’re adorable and I love them. She really was the first one he told about the baby and now she’s helping him out so much because she cares. Their friendship is so good! 😊
Tears are streaming down his face, making it impossible to see clearly. He pauses his packing to take a deep breath and wipe at the tears, then with his vision clear, he resumes shoving clothes into the backpack.
Steve is tempted to call out to the guards and beg to be taken somewhere safe to give birth, but he holds back. The other pups had always been ripped away from him the moment he brought them into the world. This one needed to be with him. He wouldn’t let them hurt his pups anymore.
“Not exactly,” Sam replies and Peter frowns. “Don’t worry, Pete, you'll get there. But I think you’ll need an outfit first.”
“No! No. God no. We’re not there yet. And no I’m not embarrassed of you but it’s gonna draw a lot of attention. Let me deal with that. Don’t worry about it.”
Peter rushes toward his father, pushing through to get to him. Sam tries to protest, but one look from Natasha has him backing away and allowing the teenager closer.
“I know what you’re thinking,” Tony says as if he can read Steve’s mind. “I designed these for you, big guy. These are made from the strongest metal on earth.”
Morgan grabs the small carry on suitcase from deep in her closet and begins filling it with clothes and a few keepsakes. The idea of living with her Uncle Sam and Bucky crosses her mind, but she tosses out that idea. They’d side with her papa and have him come pick her up.
“Great. I’m thinking pizza. We don’t even need to leave the house. Hey, J, place an order will you? You know what I like.”
“If it helps I see now why Tony can’t get enough of you. I’ve never seen him so happy. I don’t know what you did but he’s changed and in a good way.”
Steve appeared happy to see his friends again, but it was the sight of his daughter that had his eyes glistening again. Natasha brings Morgan over and Steve welcomes her with open arms. He holds her close, his body shaking with the sobs that he can no longer conceal. Tony has to blink back his own tears. He never realized how much Steve truly missed their daughter.
“Everyone did, Tony! But you blew us off because all you care about is yourself! What the hell were you doing?”
“I’m sorry,” Natasha says, her voice low. Tony still catches the apology and he pulls her into a hug. It’s more for herself than him.
The shirt is a little tight around his middle and the jeans don’t button all the way. Steve gives up on the jeans and searches through the shopping bag until he finds something a little more comfortable. The jogging pants would have to do for now.
“Look, I don’t know how to explain,” Tony begins, making sure to keep his voice low. “But he’s sort of, well actually there’s a possibility that he’s carrying my kid.”
Peter ignores him at first and continues getting the supplies he needs. “I want to,” he eventually says. “It’s my fault you look like that.”
“Well I don’t. I still see that little punk that I used to color with and run around the living room playing superheroes. I hate him being alone.”
Sam offers Tony a beer and he accepts it. Sam cracks one open for himself and takes a sip, his eyes never leaving Tony.
Peter goes ignored when Tony turns away from him and starts making his way toward the doors. Peter tries to follow after him, but he’s forced to stop when his dad turns around again to face him.
The anticipation is killing him. He can feel the bed dip as Tony moves away and he can hear the sound of him undressing. He’d give anything to see and feel him, take in his naked body and enjoy it just like the way Tony enjoys him. But he’s reminded of the tie around his eyes and the cuffs holding him in place.
Hello, everyone! I’m so sorry I haven’t updated this one in a long time. Endings are hard for me so I kind of pushed this one to the side until I could come up with an ending. Guess that didn’t work because I’m adding another chapter after this. Just an epilogue or something. This one mostly focuses on Steve’s progress and his time in the program.
Tony sighs harshly. He can’t understand why Steve would want to try again after the traumatic experience he had a few months ago. But Steve was both stubborn and determined. There was no stopping him once he'd made up his mind.
“Stop, stop. You’re perfect. I love you so much, regardless of your past. I don’t care about any of that. I just want you to be happy.”
“Dammit, Steve, look at me. I did feel sorry for you and the situation you were in. And believe me at the time I didn’t know what the fuck was going on and if what you were telling me was true. You have to understand where I’m coming from. I went from showing up at some charity event to coming home and not remember a damn thing to you telling me we met and we’re having a kid. So I’m sorry that I reacted the way I did but it wasn’t just you going through shit. My life was turned upside down too.”
They finish up the shopping, and end up getting more than what was originally planned. Tony hadn’t intended them on getting so much, but if it made Steve happy, then he was going to do it.
Tony gets in first and makes sure to take a deep breath to calm himself before Peter joins him. Peter is just as excited about being inside the car than he was just looking at it. A bright smile appears on his face.
“I don’t care about your past, Steve. I know you’re not just some omega. You’re more than that. I’m honestly wondering why you’d even give me a chance. I’m the one who-”
The sharp pain shooting through his head dazes him, and he falls to the floor with a small groan. His arms wrap tightly around himself to protect his unborn child from any harm. He waits for the kicking to start.
When Morgan grows fussy, Tony panics, terrified of Steve reverting back and spiraling out of control. But then Steve surprises him by calming Morgan down, talking softly to her and even humming a song Tony remembers Steve doing when Morgan was still in his belly. Tony doesn’t interrupt their moment, deciding to linger in the doorway of the nursery and give them their time to reconnect and make up for lost time.
“It was before Steve-that mission,” Bucky says, his voice thick and eyes growing misty. He sniffs before continuing, “I didn’t know how to say it. And then we lost Steve and I just couldn’t.”
The footage JARVIS has decided to broadcast is the day Steve first moved into the tower along with the rest of the Avengers. Tony had thought it would be fun(and obnoxious) to record it all. Steve appeared the most annoyed, not a fan of being recorded. Especially when he was still trying to adjust to a new world, a new home, and new friends.
“I do help,” Tony quickly defends himself. “But I also have another kid that needs my attention and-”
Just thinking about his mate makes him nervous all over again. He’s wondering how he’s doing standing in front of the press. Tony’s probably used to these types of things, but Steve still doesn’t understand how he can do them so easily.
“Something’s different,” Steve replies. “If you need to tell me something, anything, I’m here okay?”
For once Tony is in his office bright and early Monday morning, ready to start the day. Usually his Monday’s aren’t always like this. It’s rare for him to be bright eyed and bushy tailed, but the past few days haven’t been brutal towards him.
“I know,” Peter says softly, his eyes flickering in Bucky’s direction again, then quickly back to Sam’s. “I guess it’s just easier to pretend it never happened.”
He sounds every bit as sad as he looks. It was crazy how he went from happy about his son’s name to reverting back into sadness. And it was all of Tony's doing.
“I’m pregnant,” Peter says, his voice so low that he’s almost sure Ned didn’t hear him. But then he’s glancing at his friend again and by the look on his face alone, Peter is positive Ned had heard.
“You need to take him downstairs. The lab is set up for-” Tony begins to say, only to catch himself when he notices the uneasy look on his mate’s face. “Honey, he’ll be fine. Bruce is gentle.”
Peter’s aware of the tears that form in his eyes and he has to turn away from Ned to hide them. Ned doesn’t appear to notice and continues to talk about his weekend. Maybe he does notice and doesn’t know what to do. He’s seen Peter cry plenty of times throughout their friendship.
Tony is hesitant to leave Steve’s side, but meeting the new interns wasn’t something he could delay any longer. Pepper had already gotten on his case about the schedule, and being nagged was the last thing the alpha needed. He had enough on his plate.
Peter comes home drenched and shivering. He doesn’t go upstairs right away, too ashamed to face his uncles and explain the situation he’s found himself in. Just thinking about telling them the truth hurts. He can’t bring himself to do it. They’d never let Tony back into their lives, and his uncle Bucky would go ballistic. Peter can’t hurt them. Not when they’ve already suffered enough.
Steve unbuckles the belt and lets it hang loose in the loops of charcoal colored slacks. Tony’s breath picks up when Steve’s hand gets close to his aching cock. Steve peers up at the alpha, watching his face as he lowers the article of clothing down Tony’s legs. Tony takes over from there, removing the rest of his clothing and tossing them to the side.
The alpha is locked behind a heavily sealed door. Steve throws himself against it, grunting each time his body collides with it. Its looks are deceiving; Steve proves to be stronger and his body creates dents in the metal. He eventually brings the door down with a loud crash and enters the room.
“I know. I just want to do more. You always said these powers were a gift and I don’t want to waste them. The Avengers mean something to so many people and I guess I just want to be a part of that. I want to do something good,” Peter says.
Tony doesn’t miss the way Steve’s voice cracks. One glance up shows tears running down Steve’s face.
“Buck?” He mumbles. There’s a moment of silence and Steve peers up, expecting to find his friend asleep. Bucky’s eyes are closed but he doesn’t appear to be sleeping.
“Tony, I swear if you’re-” She begins to say, only to stop herself and peer up. Her eyes go wide in surprise. “Oh my God!”
The sight that greets him is a completely different one than what he’s used to. He had been so accustomed to Steve feeding and comforting Morgan in the middle of the night, but something about this scene was all wrong. That smile Steve wore whenever Morgan locked her eyes with him was gone; instead he was crying, soft sniffs escaping him and shoulders shaking from the sobs he’s desperately trying to conceal.
“How did he do last night?” Steve asks, glancing down at Peter for a moment when he squirms, then his eyes are back on Tony’s.
He reaches out, only to catch himself and retract his hand. Steve takes his hand and leads it to the bump, smiling softly.
Tony completely avoids Clint and Bucky. Sam and Natasha were being civil and even Thor had managed to start up a conversation with him. Tony knew he wouldn’t be welcomed back with open arms, but at least more than half of the team were willing to interact with him.
Tony inhales sharply and makes a fist, struggling to hold back and not collide it with the wall. Steve rises to his feet and approaches Tony, laying a hand on his shoulder and rubbing it to calm him down.
“Full,” Steve gasps when Tony shifts and his cock hits that spot inside of him. “Shit, Tony, that feels good.”
“Then...then how come I don’t feel it? How come there are days when I wish...when I wish I wasn’t-Tony, I can’t do this. I’m a horrible parent and she knows it and-”
It’s a struggle at first to get his son to latch on. The baby whimpers, the sound making Steve’s heart clench.
His older room offered more comfort. Alpha had rewarded him with his own room and bed. He was special, at least, that’s what Alpha liked to say. The omega didn’t feel special now.
“It’s insane! How did you not even know! Ow!” Clint cries out when Natasha smacks him upside the head.
Steve would have to reveal who he really was and how he came to know the billionaire. Pepper had been helping create a story that would make the most sense. It wasn’t like they could come forward and talk about the night Steve and Tony met. Tony’s reputation would be tainted. Tony Stark wasn’t a rapist. He wasn’t a bad alpha.
Peter knew all the bad stuff, which is why he had held off on meeting his dad. He didn’t feel it was necessary when he had a father that loved him unconditionally and was there for every single aspect of his life. His papa was enough and they were happy.
It only takes a few more pushes for Peter to slide out to his shoulders. Another contraction builds and Tony leans forward, screaming and squeezing Steve’s hand while he pushes one last time. One glance between his legs shows the doctor’s smiling face and the screaming baby boy in her arms.
Tony makes his way over to help. He struggles a bit at first and he curses quietly to himself when he sits down. “Giving birth sucks,” he complains. Peter is still fussing, his face growing red. Steve tries to reach out to calm him, only to retract his hand when Tony gets him in the right position to nurse.
With a grunt Steve pulls himself off the sofa, one hand resting over his protruding belly. His son moves, his tiny foot gently pressing against Steve’s hand.
The fight was going to be rough, but no one ever walked away from a fight unscathed. He’s reminded of his son and the other pups before him; the ones he had failed to protect. He would fight for them.
“He’s healthy,” Bruce says and gently gives the pup back to his mother. “He’s a little hungry though. If you need help nursing-”
“Guess we’ll never know.” Tony leans forward and stretches his arms over his head, groaning softly when his back cracks. “I can order dinner? I mean, if you’re okay with that.”
“I don’t believe he’s dead,” Happy says. “He can’t be. I don’t believe it. Something’s wrong with all of this.”
He hadn’t told his mate about it yet, or anyone else for that matter. Harley knew but only because Tony trusted him not to say anything. The toddler didn’t have a very big vocabulary just yet.
“Off,” Tony mutters. More articles and videos flood the screen. “I said off!” Tony yells. The screens go black, leaving Tony to stare at his own broken reflection.
It’s heartbreaking to see such innocent, fragile lives so distraught and traumatized. Tony can’t even begin to imagine what they went through. He had witnessed firsthand what their mother went through, and all he can hope is that they didn’t suffer as bad as Steve had.
With Steve busy getting ready, Tony leaves the room with Morgan, deciding giving his husband some space was a good idea. They were so close to enjoying a nice night out together. The last thing he wanted to do was ruin it.
“I’ll keep you safe,” Steve says, his voice soft as he begins rocking his son soothingly. “James, I love you so much. I’m sorry I couldn’t be there, but I’m here now and I’m never leaving you again.”
Tony sighs harshly. “And you believed him? Honey, I’m sorry but you just can’t have a baby. Your body-”
Tony makes a noise of displeasure, which earns him a warning look from his husband. Leave it to Steve to push aside his own feelings just to satisfy those of others. Tony understood that every second was precious with their son, but a few hours to allow Steve some time to rest wasn’t the end of the world.
“Yeah, well, you’d do the same thing if this stranger shows up claiming they know you and they were having your pup.”
When he comes to, he’s unable to tell how much time has passed. He does notice one thing, the sack has been removed from his head and he’s being escorted inside Hydra’s new hiding spot. Tony is being held down by two alphas and led down a corridor opposite from Steve.
Flash’s jaw tightens, along with the grip he has on the keys. He looks around the parking lot before settling his gaze back on Peter.
Steve frowns at the newest addition to his husband’s Halloween collection. “I don’t think cute is the right word.”
But then Tony is driving up toward a lake surrounded by trees and shuts off the ignition. He turns toward Steve and smiles again.
Tony has to put on another fake smile around his teammates and pretend that he was happy about becoming a father. Deep down he loathed the idea of being a father. He wasn’t cut out for parenthood.
Tony frowns. “I don’t whine and complain. Kids cry for everything and then there’s diapers and them getting into everything and making a mess and...Lordy, that’s terrifying. I just saw it all and I can’t deal with that.”
Peter stirs when he’s laid down and Tony quietly shushes him and runs a finger along his cheek. It helps calm him down, and soon Peter is back asleep.
Tony doesn’t really deserve any chances...well, I don’t know. He definitely needs to earn Peter’s trust and it’s going to take a lot of work on his part.
Steve frowns and is ready to march back up the stairs and change, but then Tony is rushing after him and taking his hand, forcing him to sigh in defeat and turn back around.
Tony stirs in his sleep, eyes fluttering open and an annoyed sigh leaving him. “I was having a good dream. You both ruined it.”
The scene is different. Harley is splayed out in his bed, snoring loudly with his blankets thrown off and one arm hanging off the bed. Steve shakes his head with a small chuckle and steps into the room to adjust his son.
“What about the baby?” Peter asks. He doesn’t miss the way his uncle Bucky tenses and grips his fork a little tighter. “Uh I mean...you know I don’t want to...be in the way.”
“Let me go!” Steve screams, struggling against the alpha holding him tightly. Steve manages to break free and spin around, connecting his fist with the alpha’s jaw. “Don’t,” Steve growls when the alpha takes a step toward him.
Brock strikes first. Steve is faster, dodging the attack and issuing one of his own. The alpha stumbles back and wipes at his lip, scoffing at the blood he finds on his fingers.
The thought of having to deliver this pup on his own strikes fear in him. All of the others had been safely born by some type of medical professional. The pups were important and Alpha made sure they were delivered with care.
“Don’t,” Steve warns and he gets out of bed, ignoring Tony’s pleas for him to stay. “I’m sorry,” Steve apologizes. He can’t hold back the rest of his tears. “I’m sorry I can’t do this part for you. I’m sorry that you’re miserable and I can’t do anything about it. I’m sorry that we did this in the first place.”
The world was always going to need saving, whether he carried on as a hero or not. The Avengers could withstand anything thrown at them, even losing one of their own. They would be able to carry on if Steve stepped down.
“I know. This just parallels my last experiences and-” Steve stops himself, taking a shaky breath to calm his nerves. Tony is taking his hand and offers a smile.
But now after seeing the baby for the first time, he feels torn. The decision should be obvious. They were too young to be having a baby. They still had school and their whole lives ahead of them. Not to mention that they weren’t even a couple. They weren’t even friends.
“And we appreciate it, but if you need a moment to yourself then tell me. Something is going on with you, more than just needing a break.”
Tony smiles and places the jar down for Steve. He moves around him to get to the other side, his hand lightly coming into contact with his shoulder. The spark that shoots through him is difficult to ignore.
He rolls over onto his side, finding Steve already drifting off to sleep. “You want me to stay the night?” Tony asks.
“Then I had another boy. He kind of resembled me a little bit, or at least the parts of him I could see. His name was Harley. He-he wasn’t the one either.”
“Fine,” Steve replies, his voice is still thick from sleep, but there’s something else about his tone that worries Tony.
Inside is warm and welcoming, something her own home could never be. It was a shame her aunt couldn’t have kids of her own. She would be a wonderful mother. Maybe she’d take Morgan in.
Steve nods and he places his hand over Tony’s. There’s a hint of a smile on his lips when Tony takes his hand and squeezes it. With Steve in a better mood, Tony decides to take the plunge and ask Steve about yesterday.
I finally got around to this one! I’m trying to do better with my updates! Thank you so much for being so patient and understanding!
His own mark is still tingling. Steve had bit him during their second round of mating. The feeling of having the gland broken was indescribable. For so long Tony wondered if he would ever create a bond with an omega. He had accepted living out the rest of his life alone. But that all changed when Steve entered the picture. Now Tony had a mate and pup on the way.
“Steve!” Tony calls out as he makes his way up the stairs. The first room he checks is Morgan’s, only to find her room empty. A few of her belongings are scattered around the room, proof Steve had been there at some point. Tony keeps looking.
Steve’s screams throughout the night only seem to get worse. He not only wakes Tony and Peter, but the rest of the children during one of his nightly episodes. He hates it. He hates how much he scares the pups when he’s screaming and begging for help. He hates that’s the image they see of him.
“Just say it. I’m sure I’ve heard it already but it sounds like you need to get something off your chest.”
Steve nods. Tony rises to his feet and disappears to the bathroom, rummaging through the cabinets until he finds the first aid kit that they kept in case of minor accidents. He returns with the kit and takes his spot beside Steve.
Peter’s eyes fill with tears and he forces himself to look away and make his way toward his bedroom. He can’t bring himself to go into his papa’s room.
He knows the kitchen still has boxes that need unpacking, but spending time with Peter felt more important. Steve hadn’t decided if he wanted to hang up the shield and pass on the Captain America title to someone else, but the more it crossed his mind, the more he found himself leaning toward the idea of retiring.
But it was too late to dwell on the what ifs. Tony couldn’t change the past, but he could change himself and make his future a little brighter.
Peter grips the bag tightly, fighting the urge to rip into it. A part of him wants to wait until he’s surrounded by the rest of his family, but his curiosity gets the best of him and he opens the bag. He gasps at what he finds inside.
“He needed you! I needed you! All you had to do was answer the stupid phone!” Peter screams and continues to punch the suit he used to admire.
The gray blob that appears on the screen never fails to amaze him. He’s seen this same image before, and each time his heart fills with love and joy. That was his baby. No matter how his pups were conceived, he still loved them more than anything.
But Nick had other plans, and now he was once again face to face with the person he thought had been lost forever.
“Really?” Steve frowns, not entirely convinced that his husband wasn’t feeling any pain. He’s never experienced labor-nor will he ever unfortunately-but he’s heard it’s not a pain-free experience. Perhaps Tony’s pain tolerance was strong. He hands Tony the bag, his frown deepening when Tony rummages through it to pull out his Stark pad. “Really? You brought it anyway?”
Tony gently places her in Steve’s arms, standing awkwardly while Steve struggles to get her in a comfortable position to latch on. She’s not having any of it, only growing more agitated with each attempt Steve makes. The shift in her attitude is doing nothing for Steve’s.
“Thank you.” Steve smiles softly and leans down to kiss each of his pups again. He glances up when a small whimper can be heard. “How’s Pete?”
But that all seemed like such a long time ago. They had been broken up for months, and during that time, barely saw or said a single word to each other. The birth of their son changed all that, and Peter’s presence was working on them again. They were working things out, rekindling their love. And now they were going on a date.
“Leave me alone!” Morgan yanks herself free from his grasp and runs up the stairs. He doesn’t go after her either.
Tony gives a small shrug in response. “I don’t know. I came across it the other night and meant to tell you, but you were asleep. We don’t have to name him that if you don’t want.”
“I could tell. You came so much.” Tony can’t help but grimace at the warmth trickling down his thighs. “If I’m not pregnant after this then I don’t know what to tell you.”
The rest of the team hasn’t come in yet. They wanted to give Tony space and time to be alone with Steve before paying a visit. A part of Tony wishes Morgan was with him. Maybe she would be enough to coax Steve awake.
Tony groans and drags his cock slowly out until just the tip remains inside, then he’s thrusting back in and fucks Steve roughly.
“I don’t know. I’m hungry.” Tony opens the bag and pops a few blueberries into his mouth, chewing the fruit happily. He lets out a content sigh and leans back against the pillows he brought from home. “So far this is nice. I get to lie in bed and eat snacks, finally get around to that upgrade for your suit, and let you pamper me. This is great!”
Steve gasps when Tony’s hand slides down to his waist, and he jumps, pulling away from the unexpected touch.
“There’s my two favorite people,” Tony says when he enters the room. Morgan tries to turn at the sound of the familiar voice. Steve assists by turning her so that she can face Tony. Her face lights up. “Hi, Maguna. You having fun with papa?”
He doesn’t go up to the apartment; it wouldn’t be home anyway, and he follows the team into the communal room. The reception following the service was worse than being at the cemetery. Peter didn’t want to mingle and hear everyone’s condolences. He just wanted to be left alone.
“When have I done that?” Steve questions. Tony doesn’t miss the way his voice takes on a defensive tone.
They share one last look, then Steve leaves and doesn’t look back. Just like a breakup is supposed to happen.
“Beside leaving you and Steve behind? It’s hard to say when that has probably been my biggest regret to date. I wish I could go back and do things right. But I’m trying now okay? Can that be good enough?”
Steve swallows hard and glances back down at his lap, then up again to meet Pepper’s soft gaze. She smiles.
A faint smile forms over Steve’s face again and he squeezes Peter’s hand gently. “I believe in you. Do you remember what I taught you?”
Then Steve is taking his hand and bringing it back, placing it directly over the bump. Tony’s breath gets caught in his throat at the feeling. His baby was right there.
His knot softens and Tony pulls out. He keeps himself on top of the omega, eyes shut and chest rising and falling rapidly. He’s afraid to move. His legs feel unsteady.
And then he smiles. It’s not very big, but Steve can still see it appear where a usual scowl goes. “Yeah. Guess you do. Your secret’s safe with me. I won’t let SHIELD interfere. Well , except for providing care. All of your medical needs will be taken care of.”
“I know, I know. You don’t need to apologize. If you need space then tell me. I can give you that if that’s what you need.”
Peter says nothing and just continues to cry. Tony holds him close, willing to comfort him for as long as he needs to.
“Don’t sweat it,” Tony waves him off. “I don’t sleep much in here anyway. And besides, my scent is all over this place. That calms you, right? Sorry. I’m not great with omegas. Or anyone actually.”
Tony rolls his eyes and steps away, inching closer to Steve. He keeps a safe distance, not wanting to crowd around the omega and scare him off. He wonders if he already has when he suggested Steve stay with him.
Peter pulls himself to his feet and quickly wraps the test in toilet paper before tossing it in the trash.
But then Peter met Ned and it was the start of a beautiful friendship. Ned had come to Peter’s rescue, just like Bucky had come to Steve’s. Peter had found someone he’d have till the end of the line.
Getting to know Tony took time, and even then there were still days when Steve was discovering something new about him. But he loved him despite his flaws and their differences. They didn’t make sense to some, but they didn’t need permission from anyone to feel the way they felt.
Steve is taken into a new room, the light blinding him and causes the omega to shut his eyes. The room smells clean, but despite the fresh scent, Steve coils. He hated the showers.
Peter snaps his head up, ready to defend himself in case Flash decides to hit him. But much to his relief, it’s not the kid that’s been picking on him since grade school.
“What!” Tony cries and Steve knows he’s not just playing it up for their son. “No costume? No, no we will find you a costume. What do you want to be?”
Tony comes closer, taking cautious steps to avoid upsetting the omega even more. Steve grants him permission to come close and he reaches out for Steve’s hand.
“I know, I know. I just thought it would be fun. Baby shopping is exciting. We still have so much to do before he gets here and I guess I just want to be prepared.”
One glance at his alarm clock shows he had been asleep for a little over 3 hours. It’s not nearly enough and his body begs for more rest, but the loud noises coming from outside his bedroom are too hard to ignore.
But before she can form any words, the subject has been changed and she’s left to listen instead of speak.
Tony turns in his seat so that he can see Steve properly. Lately the omega had taken a liking to hanging around the lab whenever Tony was working. Tony wonders if it’s because they’ve recently created a bond and Steve needed to be close by, or if he generally liked spending time with him. Maybe it was a bit of both.
“Because I said so!” Tony’s voice raises. He turns toward his son, finding him staring wide-eyed at him. “Fuck. I’m sorry.”
“I thought you said he was doing better?” Bruce says, his brows furrowing slightly. “Why are you afraid to leave him alone with Morgan?”
Tony is forced to look away when he’s jabbed in the side again. He glances down, eyes landing on the edge of a shiny, black shoe. He doesn’t even have to look up to know who’s standing in front of him.
Steve sighs and he starts the car. They drive in silence the rest of the way home. Tony keeps his head toward the window and hands in his lap. One hand finds its way to his middle. The movement catches Steve’s attention and he glances in Tony’s direction, smiling softly at the scene.
Steve still appears hesitant to let his son go. He’s ready to protest but then Tony is assuring him again.
His stomach churns at the thought of them being successful and ripping another pup away from him. He wouldn’t let them. He’d keep fighting until his baby was safe and out of harm's reach. Maybe now he’d be the successful one.
“It’s not that simple!” Peter’s voice rises slightly. He takes a deep breath to calm himself. “You don’t think I tried? But I couldn’t do it.”
“Yeah.” Steve’s sure he sounds every bit as confused as he looks. He had already answered this question. “Tony-”
The other omega sighs and shakes her head again. She walks over to Tony and takes the coffee that’s meant for her.
There’s only one place Tony knows where to go, only one person he can rely on for a time like this. It takes a couple of knocks on the door to get a response, then it’s opening and Natasha is standing in the doorway, a deep frown etched on her face. Tony understands her confusion. Here he was in the middle of the night at her door with a fussy baby. It’s not just confusion that crosses her features. She looks concerned.
Peter smirks and positions himself in a fight stance, his hands rolled up into fists and raised. “I can do this all day.”
He scolds himself. It wasn’t just Steve’s body that was perfect. Everything about the omega was perfect.
He immediately recognizes Steve’s shoe and he rushes over, finding the rest of him lying face down on the floor.
This is what Steve had been dreading. The last thing he wanted was to lose Tony. They gave up on their relationship, and though it took time to heal from that loss, Steve accepted that they weren’t meant to be anything more than friends. But now their friendship was fading too.
“You can do it, Uncle Bucky,” Peter assures. “If my papa could then so can you. You’re already doing an amazing job.”
Peter is fast asleep, snoring softly and messy hair sticking out from under the comforter. Steve enters quietly and lowers himself down on the bed beside his son. He shakes him gently.
Steve puts aside the bag and murmurs a quick apology before rising to his feet and moving as fast as he can toward the kitchen. He rests both hands against the island, his fingers growing white from how hard he’s squeezing it. Another tear rolls down his face and then another until they’re streaming down his face.
The click of heels against the floor is what captures Steve’s attention and he glances up, finding Pepper entering the kitchen. She smiles politely and makes her way over to the island where the bottle of wine has been left out. She pours some into her glass.
“Pep, please!” Tony grows frustrated. He takes a deep breath to calm himself. “I’m sorry. Just please reschedule for me. Tell him I’m away and I’ll contact him later. Don’t interact with him after this.”
“You’ll like Happy too. I promise he’s not a bad guy. Listen-” Tony takes Steve’s hands again. “-if I have to go back then Happy will stay here and keep an eye on you. I’ll make sure I won’t be gone long.”
“You didn’t mean it. That wasn’t you, remember? That version of you doesn’t exist anymore, and she knows that. Look how happy she is now that you’re home. If you never came home…” Tony pauses, a shaky breath leaving his lips. He couldn’t even begin to imagine Steve not being around anymore. He thought their separation was difficult, and it was, but losing Steve for good would be worse. He was thankful Steve’s attempt at taking his life failed. He needed Steve. Morgan needed him more.
Tony’s head is slammed into the wall and then drops down to his chin. His ears fill with the sound of dress shoes on the floor, followed by the door being unlocked. It opens and then shuts, leaving them alone at last.
“Oh no.” Peter’s eyes widen and fill with tears when he realizes what he’s done. “No. No.” He rushes over to inspect the shield, his heart sinking at the damage he’s created.
“No. No, Uncle Bruce please! Please, guys help him! Please!” Peter begs. “Please you have to do something. He’s-”
“Uh...last year. I’ve been thinking of going and Papa said he didn’t mind and...I just haven’t worn it because of you-know-who and-and-”
Steve ignores her, too busy getting the rest of his children out of the vehicle. James helps out the best that he can, taking his younger brother’s hand while Steve gets Sarah out next.
He doesn’t even understand why he would be going into a rut. Steve wasn’t in heat and was already pregnant. There were no heat pheromones to kick start his rut, and yet Tony’s body was responding like there was. He wonders if his cycle was just off. It wouldn’t be the first time.
The sound of the front door captures Tony’s attention and he looks up, his smile widening at the sight of the person stepping through.
Tony deepens the kiss, emitting another soft moan from Steve’s lips. He’s not aware of the pressure he’s applying to Steve’s middle until a strong hand is pushing against his chest, forcing Tony to pull back slightly and frown down at Steve in confusion.
“It’s okay,” Steve assures and he lifts his shirt off his head, tossing it on the floor to join Tony’s discarded one. He lies back and removes his sweatpants and underwear, then takes his own cock into his hand and strokes himself. “Take your time.”
But it’s more than that. The urge to start a new project isn’t to benefit the world like past creations, but to protect the tiny world he created with Steve. The safety of his mate and pup would always come first.
But then Harley was born and Morgan lost the chance of having a little sister. It was fine though. Harley was cute and didn’t scream and fuss like most babies Morgan had been around. He wasn’t so bad.
Just the thought of him has Peter choking out a sob. He buries his face into his hands and sobs into them. His legs threaten to give out and he has to grip the railing to keep himself from sliding down to the floor.
There’s still some hesitation and Tony can practically see the argument Steve was having with himself. Then he’s nodding his head and allowing Tony to take her from him. Tony brings Morgan close, trying to get her calm.
Steve gasps and drops his hand, but Tony takes it and grips it hard. Steve struggles and Tony fights back, pushing him deeper into the bench. The pressure on his belly sends warning signals.
“Speaking of...I made a call and-it’s nothing bad I swear!” Tony quickly says when Steve tenses. “He’s a friend of mine. I just figured since you probably haven’t had any medical-”
The floors tremble again and the walls crumble, dust and debris filling the space. Steve moves quickly to grab the weapons, but another wave comes through and he sways.
Pepper sighs sadly and wraps her arms around him. Tony turns and clings to her tightly, sobbing quietly.
Steve wracks his brain for a reason for his son’s discomfort. He double checks his diaper and finds it clean, then he takes his temp just in case. Everything appears normal, and yet Peter was still upset.
He huffs at his appearance. Tony wouldn’t care about the little weight left over, he made sure to tell Steve everyday that he was beautiful. It was difficult to believe those words when Steve still battled with himself, but he was getting better.
A smile forms over Tony’s face and pulls Steve into another kiss. They’re forced to pull apart when Peter squirms between them.
“Yeah, well, I’m busy. I need to...I have to go.” Tony jumps up from his seat and quickly grabs his belongings.
He’s happier now that he has a steaming cup of coffee and a change of scenery from his tower. He doesn’t get to spend too much time in the cafe. Happy makes sure to drag him away when he starts flirting with the pretty omega behind the counter.
Sam had a point. There would be no illegal operation if the building and everyone inside was destroyed. The only ones that needed to get out alive were himself and his team.
Pepper sobs loudly and this time Bruce comforts her with more than just a tissue. He wraps his arms around her and she holds him tight, sobbing into his chest.
Steve lifts his head in his husband’s direction, finding his worried gaze. Tony smiles softly and reaches out for his husband, using his hand to brush away the strands of hair that have fallen in Steve’s face.
“You won’t. I promise you’ll be out of here soon. You’re getting better, Steve. You may not see it but I do.”
“Why didn’t you force me off? If I came onto you and you didn’t want it then why didn’t you fight back?”
“I know, but he’s here now. He said something about you wanting to see him again and-Tony, what’s wrong?”
He decided to track Bruce down, finding him in his lab. Being around a familiar environment was the perfect space to clear his mind and think. It also helped that he had a friend.
Flash says nothing and gingerly sits down on the edge of Peter’s bed, scrubbing a hand over his face. Peter moves toward him, then second guessing getting too close and crossing the room to find a clean shirt. It was the least he could do.
“Well you’ve been promoted and now you get to keep my mate and son safe. Don’t screw up or you're fired.”
Steve tenses and he tries to move his hand away, only for Tony to chase after it and interlace their fingers. “Honey, I want to help you. Talk to me. Please?”
It’s near his 16th birthday when Peter’s life changes again. To say he’s confused about his Uncle Sam dragging him away for a special meeting would be an understatement. Peter’s never been more confused and nervous in his whole life.
Steve flushes. He had forgotten about the hat he had borrowed from Tony. It was not the best disguise in the world, but it would have to do for now.
Steve sighs sadly and slips his hand free from Tony’s. “I just need a little time. Can I have that?”
Thank you so much for the wonderful feedback! The kudos and kind words never fails to put a smile on my face! I wish I could see these two stop being idiots but...yeah that's not happening. We love them anyway :)
The support of their friends was exactly what they needed during that tough time. Sam and Bucky were always looking for ways to take Peter out of the house and distract him while Natasha comforted Steve with long talks. Tony grieved the only way he knew how.
“Go be with him. He’s probably confused and scared. I can take Morgan for the night and give you a chance to properly talk with him. He means a lot to me and everyone else, too. We want him to be okay.”
“Speaking of money,” Steve begins and he gets up from where he’s been sitting for the past hour, stretching his arms over his head and groaning softly when his back pops. “I don’t want a big, extravagant wedding.”
One shove. That’s all it would take to get the alpha off of him, but Steve knows better. He doesn’t want to be punished again.
Steve stares at it again and with one shaky hand, reaches for it. His fingers wrap around the test, his grip on it so tight he feels he might snap it in two. The tears in his eyes can no longer be concealed and they escape, rolling down his face and creating wet tracks.
“You’ll see.” Tony shoots Steve one of his confident smiles. It could be a sign, but Steve had decided he’s stopped looking for those signals.
Tony grins and glances down at himself. He had chosen to replicate Steve’s stealth suit for many reasons, one being that Steve looked amazing in it and surely Tony would too. Well, he didn’t look half bad. He has yet to put on the helmet and the famous shield was still in the hands of its original owner but otherwise he was ready for another Halloween.
Steve visibly tenses at that name and hides himself in Tony’s neck, deeply inhaling the soothing scent to rid himself of the nerves coursing through his body. Tony responds by pulling Steve close and scenting him.
He doesn’t want to talk about who he’s going to live with. It was a big decision, one he never imagined he’d have to make. He should be deciding on college, a summer job, or what he wants for lunch. Not new parents.
Tony brings him closer and presses a kiss to his forehead. “I love you,” he whispers. “we’re getting out of this. I promise.”
But he can’t lie to his son. They were supposed to be creating a bond. Lying wasn’t going to make them grow closer. He had lied to Steve and the last thing he wanted to do was lie to his son.
The sight is difficult to see, but Tony can’t help the spark of joy that shoots through him. His plan was working.
“Remember Liz’s party?” Peter asks and Ned nods his head. “That’s when. I said I’d only have one drink so I could be cool and-”
The question has Flash spluttering out the water. Steve is out of his seat in seconds to grab a towel and Peter rushes to Flash’s side to help.
Staring at Tony is difficult now. The alpha’s face is decorated with deep purple, bruises and dried blood. It’s just a painful reminder to Steve. He was the one who brought harm to his mate.
Peter shifts uncomfortably again and forces himself to stare at his uncles. There’s a look of anger and disappointment from one and a confused and worried one from the other. Peter honestly hates both.
“I love you too. I guess so much that people are beginning to wonder why I haven’t popped the question yet.”
He takes his time popping open the buttons of Steve’s shirt, exposing pale skin. Tony runs his hands down the front of Steve’s chest, admiring the sculpted chest. He pushes off the article of clothing and tosses it somewhere behind him.
“I suppose I don’t understand the part where you lock yourself away for days with barely any food or water while an omega that cares about you very much is left in the dark.”
Steve allows Tony to pull him close and kiss him softly on the lips. He instantly relaxes the moment his mate’s arms are around him.
“I’m gonna fuck you,” Tony promises and presses his lips against the sensitive skin on Steve’s neck. Steve sighs and tilts his neck to the side to offer more access. Tony places kisses and bites along Steve’s neck, marking the soft flesh. He trails one hand between them, rubbing Steve through his jeans and eliciting a moan from him.
“I’m sorry.” It’s barely above a whisper, but Tony picks up on the two words. Steve lifts his head and turns toward Tony, his once vibrant blue eyes lack their shine. Tony has never seen them so dull.
“You okay?” Tony asks, turning away for a moment to take two mugs out of the cabinet and fills them. He peers up just in time to notice the way Steve’s eyes shine with tears.
It’s tempting to expose Steve’s neck and place the mark, but Tony holds back. He doesn’t even know if Steve would want him that way. They might be having a baby, but Steve didn’t give permission for them to bond. Steve’s lost so much already. Tony didn’t want to take away something else.
“I know, and I’m proud of you for how much you’ve opened up. Steve, this is going to take time. I’m not going to rush you or pressure you into talking to me. I’m here to help you.”
Steve tunes the banter out, deciding to give all of his attention to the little boy in his arms. It still hadn’t hit him yet that he had given birth. Harley was unexpected, but a blessing at the same time.
“I don’t have a favorite. I appreciate the help. Peter would probably try to help and end up playing with the toys.”
Steve smiles. He’ll never grow tired of hearing Tony referring to the pups as his. It makes him love his mate even more. If that was even possible.
He doesn’t realize it at first, but he’s moving closer to the alpha, the gap between them getting smaller and smaller. They’re both leaning in, just inches away from closing that gap completely. Steve’s breath hitches when Tony’s ghosts over his mouth, warm against his lips.
“Steve?” Tony shakes him gently, doing his best to keep any panic out of his tone. He can’t freak out. It would only scare the omega. “Steve, wake up?”
“How’d you sleep, sir?” Jarvis is quick to change the subject. Tony only grumbles again. “If it helps, Steve is waiting for you in the kitchen.”
Despite the warning Tony can’t help but flinch. The transducer is pressed to his stomach and the screen lights up. Steve keeps his gaze locked on the screen, breath hitching when he sees the black and white images displayed.
“I don’t know.” Tony gives a nonchalant shrug. “He wants another pup so I thought marriage would be fine.”
“Do you feel better?” Steve asks, peering down at his son. James glances up, showing off his whip cream mustache and nods. Steve chuckles and wipes it clean. “Good.”
Clint is flying the jet and Natasha is up front with him, chatting about their past assignments and laughing from the memories. Sam and Bucky for once appear to be getting along. They’re bickering about each other’s uniforms, but from where Steve’s standing, it comes off as playful bantering. He can’t help but smile.
Tony shakes his head. “You scared the hell out of us. A part of me wants to ground you but...I’ve ran away too so I get it. What did we do?”
“Don’t look at me like that. I’m the cool uncle. Don’t listen to whatever Sam says. And I think I’m the coolest godfather too…” Bucky trails off, sending a glance Steve’s way to confirm.
Steve is relieved to know that his husband was feeling better and the pregnancy wasn’t being too rough on him, but he can’t help but sympathize when Tony complains about the new symptoms. He wishes he could take Tony’s place. It should be him suffering for their baby.
To his surprise, Tony doesn’t move back to his original spot. He stays nearby, keeping his gaze on Steve to make sure he is okay. Being this close to the alpha is comforting. Steve can’t help but want to be closer.
“We’ll take it slow,” Tony promises. “We’ll see what happens. And who knows maybe...maybe we can be-”
“Be quiet, Omega,” The alpha threatens, clasping his hand over Steve’s mouth. “I won’t hurt you. I know you want this.”
“Ah, yes, I see where this is going. Mr. Stark, I can assure you that your behaviour was nothing to be ashamed of. You were the highlight of the party,” Alexander says.
“You’re hilarious.” Steve rolls his eyes and pushes Tony’s hands away. “But a new suit wouldn’t hurt.”
Tony rolls his eyes but doesn’t pass up the chance to get a break. God, he feels like an asshole for wanting one when Steve was in dire need of a break. He reminds himself that Steve was currently getting one and that maybe it was his turn for once. He hadn’t had a chance to get any coffee yet and his body was demanding the caffeine.
Harley was a different story. He would get into anything and everything. Tony was constantly having to keep both eyes on the toddler. Harley’s favorite thing to do was follow Tony into the lab when he was supposed to be napping and watch the alpha work. It got to the point where Tony would bring the pup with him and have him skip nap time.
Jarvis sighs again, this time sounding agitated. If he had a face Tony pictured him rolling his eyes right about now.
“Don’t lie to me. I can smell you. I can-” the alpha pauses and reaches down with his free hand, pressing his palm into the omega’s groin. “-feel you. You want this. You’re only good for one thing.”
Not needing to be told twice, Tony positions himself between Steve’s legs and dips his hand below, circling a wet finger over Steve’s entrance. Steve tips his head back and his eyes fall shut, quiet moans and curses slipping past his lips when Tony rubs around his hole.
Pepper sighs again. “Don’t apologize. I know you’re busy dealing with...something I don’t understand. I just hope you’re taking care of yourself.”
“Relax. You secret’s safe with me, remember?” Sam reminds the omega. “I’m almost done here. Pretty soon this room is gonna fill up.”
There’s a sense of relief knowing that Steve was pulling through. He was a fighter, always has been and always will be. But that doesn’t change the fact that he had been ready to give up. It was out of character for him to surrender and accept that there wasn’t any other way. Steve had been knocked down in the past but he’s always gotten back up with raised fists. This time, he stayed down and kept his arms to his side.
Steve closes off immediately and turns back to the window. Tony gets the hint and doesn’t push for more.
Steve wasn’t perfect, he knew this, but he couldn’t help but want a perfect evening. He prepared Tony’s favorite dish and brought out the good bottle of wine. Dessert was planned for later, and that was something that definitely couldn’t falter. It’s been too long since they’ve been able to do anything like this.
Tony enters the apartment with a smile on his face and the keys to their new home in his hand. The first thing he hears is Morgan’s giggling followed by Steve laughing. The sound brings Tony to a halt. He hadn’t heard that sound in so long. Sometimes he wondered if he’d ever hear again.
Tony rises to his feet and closes down the lab, making sure to instruct JARVIS to activate the alarm around the penthouse. He knows no one in their right mind would try to break in, but he’s being cautious now, more so than he’s ever been. He has a pup and omega to take care of.
Tony sighs and sets his beer down, no longer interested in the beverage. He contemplates joining the rest of the party, but he holds back, not wanting to disrupt what they have going on. They were hurting because Steve wasn’t physically with them on this day, but they still had each other and that was enough to keep their spirits high. Tony would only ruin that.
He tries to force Tony out of his mind and focus on helping the omega’s that need him. But then he’s reminded of the little pack waiting for him back home, and their needs. Tony might be the alpha, but it wasn’t just his responsibility to care for their family. Steve had a role to play too, and right now he felt as if he wasn’t taking his job as seriously as he should.
“I’ll see you I guess.” Tony frowns at his own words. “Sorry, I don’t know what I’m supposed to say here. Usually, the other person is pissed off and throwing things at me.”
“Hey, don’t do that. You can. Don’t let them control you anymore. I know that’s easier said than done but you can’t let them win. Not anymore.”
“Because you deserve them,” Tony says, “and I’m gonna give you another. I can feed her and you go back to bed.”
A little girl with long, dark hair emerges from the tunnel slide, wearing a smile similar to Steve’s. It’s Bucky who scoops her into his arms and she giggles when he kisses her cheek.
Peter sits down on the bed, and this time his eyes land on the photograph. He takes it in his hands, tears blurring the two people in the photo. He blinks a couple of times to clear his vision.
“Okay,” Tony frowns and leans against the counter, folding his arms over his chest. “So does this mean he’s…”
Life didn’t work out that way. He lived the bachelor lifestyle for a while until he met Steve. Steve had changed him almost instantly. Falling in love and settling down never crossed Tony’s mind until he met the person he was supposed to do all of those things with. Steve was his everything.His whole life. He couldn’t imagine living in this world without him.
Steve inhales sharply at the last name mentioned. Iron Man was still around, saving New York occasionally. But Steve was beginning to see less and less of him. Maybe Tony walked away from his suits for good too.
He just wanted to be left alone so he could think and plan and then think again. He could figure this out. He was smart enough.
The mansion didn’t compare to the penthouse back in New York, didn’t even come close. It’s too big for Steve’s liking. He felt too small inside of its large walls. For a split second he begins to miss the penthouse.
The group of alpha’s are closing in on him, forcing him further into the elevator and backed up against the wall. He keeps the knife raised and ready. It doesn’t compare to the weapons his enemies have, but it was better than nothing. He wasn’t going to stand down.
“You didn’t waste my time, Mr. Stark,” Alexander assures. “In fact this visit was helpful to both of us.”
Peter keeps the picture secretly tucked away in the pocket of his hoodie. There would only be one reason for him to bring it to school. Ned still needed to know.
“Yeah, yeah,” Peter quickly replies and sniffs. He hopes his eyes aren’t red. “I’m good. Real good. Never...never better.”
Tony is curious to know what else Steve has gone through the past few years, but he holds back. They had so much that still needed to be said and unpacked. But it was going to take time. They still didn’t really know or trust each other.
Just the thought of his mate makes Steve’s stomach churn. Tony was forced into this abuse. It wasn’t fair. He didn’t deserve this.
“You can’t go five minutes without hitting on someone, can you?” Happy asks, staring at his boss through the rearview mirror.
Steve curses when he’s met with Tony’s personalized voicemail instead of Tony himself. For hours he’s been trying to get a hold of his husband, only for the calls and messages to go ignored. If it were any other time Steve wouldn’t have cared if Tony didn’t pick up right away. But this time was different.
His intentions weren’t like that at all. Sure the omega was extremely good looking once he saw past the dirtied face and disheveled the hair. It was his eyes that Tony couldn’t stop staring at. They were so familiar.
Tony tries to force the conversation with Steve out of his head. He needs to focus on the mission and coming home. Steve was a distraction that Tony didn’t need right now. But not thinking about Steve was easier said than done. Steve was all he could think about.
Steve chuckles before joining in, chasing after his son and catching him in his arms, using his strength to lift Peter up in the air. The little boy erupts in a fit of giggles.
“Do you still think she’ll have my eyes?” Tony asks, coming out of the kitchen to join Steve in the living room. He lowers himself down on the couch near Steve, and gently adjusts Morgan in his arms, smiling brightly when she locks eyes with him again. “Honey?” Tony glances up in Steve’s direction when he doesn’t receive a response.
Being bonded was still an experience Steve struggled to describe. Sometimes he wondered if it was even reality. For so long he believed that he would never find a mate and he’d be under Hydra’s control forever. But then Tony rescued him and promised him happiness and freedom, he promised him a life worth living.
It’s Sam who comforts him when Bucky releases a sob. He pulls him into his arms, whispering something Peter can’t quite hear from where he’s standing. Peter eventually turns away, his gaze straight ahead on the wooden casket and American flag spread out neatly over the top. He can’t look for long and he turns away.
Steve trails a hand between them, running it along the bump before settling it on Tony’s covered cock. He’s rock hard now. Steve gives the bugle a squeeze, pulling a curse from Tony’s lips.
“About an hour,” Natasha replies, adjusting the baby in her arms and smiling when he emits a tiny whimper. “We got in early.”
“The kitchen. Or living room.” Tony glances down at the ground, picturing the type of flooring he’d have installed. A hardwood surface would look nice. “Come here,” Tony says and stretches out his hand for Steve.
“Not that. I’m sorry I can’t be...good enough for you. I thought I was better and...and I’m still destroying things.”
It was at that point when Steve wished he could have sent the alpha away, but he knew better than to step out of line. It wasn’t his place. They were supposed to mate. It was all part of the plan.
“Sir,” Jarvis’ speaks up, forcing Tony to stop working and huff in an annoyance. Of course the A.I. would put in his two cents, as if Tony actually cared to hear it.
“It’s okay. I mean, you have every right to be. Having a baby is...well, you know how it is. This was the last thing we expected.”
But again, Steve was different. He had the damn serum. No doubt that was the issue. That’s what Tony decides to pin the blame on.
“He will. He’s like you. Stubborn as hell and ready to fight anything that comes his way. He’ll be okay,” Tony assures, leaning forward to brush away the tears on Steve’s cheek.
“This is ridiculous,” he sighs and scrubs a hand over his face. A soft bark in the dark responds and he sits up, eyes drawn to the figure near his feet.
“Ignore the mess,” Tony says when he catches Steve’s wandering eyes. He returns to his original task of cleaning up. “I’m working on it.”
“He doesn’t sleep.” Steve tries to stifle a yawn but fails miserably. “He kept me and Buck up all night.”
He can’t help but reach out anyway, gently running his fingers over Steve’s belly. The muscles ripple under his fingertips. He wonders what it would be like if their roles were switched, if it was him carrying the baby instead. Maybe Steve wouldn’t have been so careless.
Rhodey rolls his eyes playfully and gestures toward the sofa. Tony smiles and drags his friend over, pushing him down on one side and then plopping down next to him.
“Please, no. Please,” Tony quietly begs to himself as he waits for the information to download. Then his screens are broadcasting the footage and news articles Tony was hoping didn’t exist.
“Cap, forget the weapons,” Sam cuts in. “The point was to shut this operation down. Let this place burn.”
“Fine,” Tony gives in, doing his best to ignore the pleased smile that’s plastered on his son’s face. “Five minutes, got it?”
A part of Steve wishes they had worked. Their team wouldn’t be missing its member right now, and the baby growing inside of him wouldn’t be a secret he was going to have to keep. Maybe he and Tony could find a way to come together to raise their child.
“I have to go.” Tony jumps up from his seat, grabs the letter, and rushes out of the room, ignoring Pepper when she calls out to him.
Peter is standing still, the glasses held loosely in his hand and tears streaming down his face. Tony doesn’t even hesitate to run toward him and pull him into his arms. Peter cracks, releasing a painful sob and clinging onto Tony tightly. The glasses slip from his fingers and hit the floor.
Bruce gestures with his chin for Tony to follow him and together they make their way toward the elevators. The silence that surrounds them has Tony growing uncomfortable and wishing he was hiding back at his tower. But what kind of person would he be if he hid from his friends and son again? He promised he’d be around and unfortunately there was going to be some awkwardness at first.
Peter shakes his head and slips himself free from the shield. “Then if I get to make the decision...I choose you. He wanted you to have this. I know he did.”
Steve smiles. He continues to run his fingers through Tony’s hair. He’s taken back to the night when they had done this for what was supposed to be the last time.
Tony drops down to his knees and buries his head in the bowl of the toilet. Steve can only watch with a mixture of sympathy and disgust. His own stomach is acting up, but he figures it’s because he’s witnessing Tony’s vomiting episode. Steve pushes aside his own nausea to help comfort his husband.
They’d talk later, and hopefully, they actually do it this time. Steve takes Peter into the communal living area, carefully lowering himself down on one of the empty sofas and cradling Peter in his arms. Peter doesn’t fuss, instead he keeps his gaze trained on Steve’s face, dark eyes roaming over the features he’s come to recognize.
“Aw but he’s so cool!” Tony whines and circles the island to get to his hologram. “He’s going to scare-”
“They’re so selfish! All they do is talk over me and hog the attention. Peter is always training with them and Harley...I know he’s little but he needs to share too. I don’t want to live there anymore. They don’t care.”
Steve reminds himself that he wasn’t in heat when it happened, but that didn’t mean the chance of conception wasn’t possible. There was still a chance it took.
Tony is sitting in the middle of the room surrounded by crib parts and the packaging material from the box. He’s hard at work assembling the crib, too engrossed in his project to realize that Steve is watching him from the doorway.
“And the father?” Tony asks. Peter peers up at him, his jaw clenching. “Okay, okay. You don’t have to tell me. I just hope he’s not being an asshole.”
“Just say whatever you want to say!” Tony nearly shouts. The amusement on her face doesn’t even disappear, it only grows until Tony can’t take looking at her anymore. He turns away, glancing at the entryway he had stepped through just moments before. He contemplates leaving, but then he’d be breaking his promise.
“She’s good,” Steve assures, giving his daughter a look over. Her hair is dark like Tony’s, and Steve just knows she’ll have his eyes too. “She’s beautiful, Tony. She looks like you.”
“Yeah,” Steve replies with a yawn and he sets the paper down to stretch. “I think around 4. I couldn’t go back to sleep.”
Steve was not the biggest fan of Halloween. Fall was his favorite season. He enjoyed the cool, crisp mornings and the warm, spicy drinks. The sweaters he wore were always soft and comfortable. Tony’s lost count of how many times he’s taken Steve apple picking. The man loved this time of year, but not the way Tony did.
Steve nods and lays his head down on Tony’s shoulder. He’s exhausted and his body demands rest, but he longs to hold his son again. He’s only held one pup but even then he never got the chance to bond with her. Peter would be different. He would get to keep this one.
“Guess I need to find a new place to sleep.” Steve chuckles and pushes slightly against the pillow that has taken over the bed. He finds a comfortable enough position, though he’s wishing he could cuddle with his husband. The pillow replaced him.
Tony cocks his head in confusion, his brows crinkling and creases forming in the center of his forehead. “That’s today?”
After Peter is fed and burped, Steve places him back on the changing table to swaddle him in a blanket. He tries to secure it correctly so that Peter is comfortable and snug.
“He’s not…” Tony trails off and steals a glance in the direction of the shut door. To avoid the possible risk of Happy or Steve eavesdropping, Tony places a hand over Bruce’s shoulder and steers him away. “He’s enhanced.”
They haven’t noticed yet but sooner or later they were going to find out. His scent always gives him away. No matter how hard he tries to be discreet, his scent lets everyone in on his secret.
Their shopping trip had been a bust and Tony wondered if maybe Steve had been right. Maybe they did have time. So they decide to wait.
“I don’t know.” Peter shrugs. “Maybe because deep down I know you care. You’re just scared. And that’s okay because I’m scared too.”
Tony had been interrupted from his newest project when he had received the alert. He can’t decide what was worse: Steve’s screams or the way his body tossed and turned as he fought off the person only he could see. Tony decides that both were things he never wanted to experience again, and he can’t imagine what it must’ve been like for Steve.
“So listen,” Steve begins and this time Peter turns toward him. “I know you haven’t decided about what you wanted to do, but I think it would be a good idea if you saw a doctor.”
Peter nods and nibbles at his toast. He can still feel his papa’s eyes on him but is relieved when he’s not questioned again.
Steve’s first instinct is to wrap his arms around Tony and bring him closer, but he’s held back and something cool snaps around his left wrist. Steve pulls back and turns his head, finding one pair of cuffs around his wrist and the other locked around the frame of the bed. He tugs at the restraint, finding that the cuffs hold true and he’s unable to break free.
Tony almost feels bad for closing the door on Dodger, but then Steve is kissing him again and for a moment he forgets that they even own a dog now. It’s not until the whining and scratching on the door starts does Tony remember that it’s not just him and Steve anymore. That was going to take some getting used to.
Peter steps closer to the monument and places a hand over the shield. His anger bubbles until he can no longer keep it contained. He’s never been so angry with his papa for leaving. If his papa would have listened to him then he’d still be alive.
Steve smiles. “Sounds exciting to me,” he says, then his smile is faltering. “I hate missing everything.”
Steve nods and buries his face in the crook of Tony’s neck, inhaling the comforting scent of the alpha. Steve’s breath is warm against the sensitive skin there. One bite and Steve could claim him. Tony would be his alpha.
It only gets worse. After the funeral, Steve loses interest in everything. He hangs up the shield, burying it deep into the closet and vowing to never touch it again. He gives up on life. There was no point anymore.
Peter was everything Steve needed and more. They had their bad and good days. Raising a child alone wasn’t a walk in the park, and more often than not Steve found himself struggling. Luckily he had his friends to help him when he was on the verge of a meltdown.
Peter does as he’s told, no longer nervous or worried about somehow damaging the expensive piece of furniture. He plops down with a tired sigh, happy to sit down and catch his breath from all the swinging he had to do to get here.
“Pa!” Peter pats Steve’s leg and looks up at him with his bright, brown eyes. He flashes another smile. “Pa-pa!”
“Tony?” Steve’s voice comes through the other side of the door, followed by a knock. “Tony, open the door. Jarvis told me.”
Tony has to fight back the urge to protest. He stays silent instead as they stroll through the courtyard. There are others outside enjoying the fresh air and warm sun just like they were. Pretty soon it would just be Steve doing this. He’d be alone, or maybe, he’d make some friends during his stay. It would be good for him.
Natasha lets out a sigh and hugs Morgan close. “They do care. They’re trying to figure out how to keep up. That doesn’t mean ignoring you is right but I don’t think they’re doing it intentionally. They love you so much.”
Peter replies with a whimper. Brown, glistening eyes open to meet those of his father’s. Tony smiles down at his son, hoping he’d get one in return. Peter loved to smile at Steve whenever they were around each other. It was one of Tony’s favorite things to witness.
“Just give him some space. I’m not going to tell you not to bother with your dad; that’s entirely up to you and I don’t have a say.”
Peter does his best to force a smile and accept the condolences given to him. He’s happy to have all of the Avengers gathered; it’s been years since they’ve been together like this. Peter just wishes it had been for a different occasion. Maybe Christmas or New Years. Not a funeral.
Steve peers up from the files he’s been reading and sets them down in his lap when he notices his son lingering in the doorway of his bedroom. Peter is holding onto his Thor bear, eyes bright with tears. He must have had another nightmare.
“At least he won’t be sneaking out anymore,” Bruce says, then he turns toward Sam and Bucky. “How did he manage to get past you guys?”
Steve doesn’t even protest and he takes the muffin back into his hand, only to not eat it. He picks at the top before deciding it must not be appetizing and he sets it back down on the table.
“I’m sorry,” Natasha apologizes when she catches the glare being sent her way. “It’s cute. Seriously. Peter Ben.”
Steve chokes back sob and brings his son closer, quietly shushing him when the baby’s face scrunches up and he whimpers. The nurse lingers around for a moment to make sure the new parents are comfortable, then she excuses herself and quietly shuts the door behind her.
Happy is taken aback by those words, but the smile that appears over his face is proof that he was both interested and flattered to be offered such a role.
“Papa, wait!” Peter runs faster until he’s close enough to throw his arms around his father. “I didn’t say goodbye.”
“I still want you. Steve is comfortable with you. Honestly, I think I scared him a little bit back there. He’s used to people.”
“Steve,” The doctor is coming over now, laying a hand over his shoulder and trying to coax him away. “I know you want to be here but I still need to examine you.”
“It's a shame.” Pierce mocks sympathy. “Stark would’ve done wonders for us. I’ll just have to mate you with another alpha.”
It’s the exact same thing he did with Steve and the Avengers, and Rhodey, Pepper, Happy, Jarvis, and now his son. Everyone he ever cared about was kicked to the curb while he ran and hid. It wasn’t fair to any of them.
Steve sighs sadly. “Pete, this is too dangerous. I need you here. When you’re older you can do these missions but not now.”
They’re surrounded in silence after that, and it’s not until Steve glances down does he realize why. Tony is fast asleep, his mouth slightly open and softly snoring. Steve pulls the blankets up around them, making sure Tony is comfortable.
“Pete, please? Did we really come this far just to throw it away? He wanted us to meet and be a family. You promised to give that to him.”
The drive home is silent. Steve keeps his eyes toward the window, tears rolling down his face as he cries silently. He still has one hand over his belly, wishing his child was still growing there. He lets out a small sob, the sound capturing Tony’s attention.
“And that’s why I have to do this. I’m not safe around her. What if I do something worse next time? What if...what if I hurt her, worse than I already have?”
“Maybe you need to hear it again because you did the exact same thing I did. I had too much to drink and one thing led to another and...well, you know what happens next.” Steve playfully nudges his son’s side, chuckling softly when Peter’s face heats up with embarrassment.
“I know but I need you to do it. If I’m right, and I’m pretty sure I am, then...then you can’t stay here.”
Steve smiles and kisses his son on the cheek. Peter responds by wrapping Steve in another hug, this time holding him a little tighter.
Double update? I think so! I busted this next chapter out and couldn't resist posting. I'll try to space the next one out...maybe.
I just want to say thank you for all of the lovely comments. I know this story is rough and probably not what you’re expecting, but I want to thank you all for pushing through this with me. The support means a lot ❤️❤️❤️
He wanted everything with his dad to be perfect. He wanted to have movie nights with him, train to one day become a part of the Avengers, go to Disney World. All the things he had done with his papa was what he wanted with his dad.
Morgan smiles again and her little legs kick out happily. Tony peers up at Steve and they share a look, then all attention falls on their daughter again. She keeps her eyes locked on the familiar face of her father for a moment, then she begins to rock from side to side until she’s rolling over onto her back.
This time his parents ignore them as they return downstairs and rush toward the front door. Peter makes sure Flash is out of the building and walking safely to his car before heading back up stairs.
“I’m fine.” It’s obvious she’s lying, but Peter knows better than to call her out. “You’re home kind of late.”
The medical wing is no foreign place to him. For years he’s found himself in this part of the building, whether that was getting stitched up from his many failed attempts at fighting back, or when it came time to check on his pups.
A part of Tony wants to tell her everything he knew so far, but he stops himself. He starts to listen to what she’s saying. Maybe she was right. Maybe it was a lie Steve fabricated to get money and a moment in the spotlight. The story Steve had told him was insane. Was that all a lie too? Was it just a reason for Tony to feel sorry for him and give him anything he wanted?
“Oh I would, huh? Probably not. I wouldn’t have to worry about you missing meetings and staying late for unnecessary parties.”
Alexander nods and mirrors him. “I hope I do, too. He’s very important to me. I just want him and our baby home safely.”
Peter is already in bed when Tony is allowed access to his son’s room. Tony steps inside and makes himself comfortable on the edge of the twin bed, his eyes taking in his son’s flushed and clammy appearance.
Peter sighs sadly and sits crossed legged in front of the stone base. He follows the line of other gifts left behind, wondering if everyone else was hurting just as bad he was.
The alpha above him picks up on the name and his lips curl into an evil grin. “He can’t save you. He’s not your mate. Why don’t you be good for him anyway? Put on a good show. Just like you always do.”
“Hey, we did fun and educational things. We learned about colors, some math equations. You know...kid stuff.”
They gather in the kitchen for breakfast. Tony’s attempt at eggs and bacon didn’t go as bad as he thought. It would be easier to have food delivered or to hire a personal chef, but Tony wanted to learn how to take care of Steve without any help. They weren’t mates and Steve didn’t need Tony to do everything for him, but Tony would be lying if he didn’t think about making Steve his mate.
“I’ll sleep on the couch then!” Tony calls out to his boyfriend. He wouldn’t of course, not when he was here first and it was his bed. The dog had no business showing up uninvited and claiming everything as his.
Tony grows quiet, keeping his attention on the hand that needs to be wrapped up. He listens, waiting for Steve to continue. It’s heartbreaking to hear his confession.
With Happy gone, Tony decides to get more information out of the omega. Steve hasn’t bothered to sit down, and instead he waits quietly for Tony to return to him. It’s not until Tony is offering him a seat again does he carefully lower himself down on the sofa. Tony joins him.
“It’s good, huh?” Tony tells his daughter, chuckling when she reaches out for the bottle. “You know what else is good? Coffee. I guess I should’ve got some before this, but you come first. You’ll always come first.”
Steve finds him tinkering away on his newest inventions, still clad in his work suit and smearing grease along the front of the white shirt. Steve sighs loudly and moves toward his husband, coming up behind him and wrapping his arms around his shoulders. Tony doesn’t even flinch or acknowledge that he was there.
Morgan begins to whimper, the sounds rising in volume until they’re loud wails. Steve struggles this time around to calm her down. The cry she makes is easily distinguishable to Tony’s ears.
Maybe one day he’ll hang up the shield for good and give all of his attention to his son. Peter needed him more than the rest of the world.
“Great,” Peter says, doing his best to hide his relief. Or maybe it was happiness. He doesn’t know. All he does know is that Flash was willing to talk with him. “Just come by place later. You know where it is right?”
Steve leans back in his seat, blowing out a breath now that he's made room for his lungs. Peter responds with a hard kick, aiming directly for Steve’s ribs and the Captain winces. He’d rather have his son beat him from the inside than suffer from another backache.
The sound of footsteps reaches his ears and Steve peers up, finding the familiar face of Doctor. Patterson. She smiles warmly at him, but he knows behind the smile is a load of questions for him. Steve dries his eyes quickly, hoping that she’d mistake his tears for joy and not the fact that he was scared out of his mind of the two tiny humans in the room.
It grows silent between them. Tony is contemplating taking Bruce’s advice and talking to Steve, but he’s hesitant. He doesn’t want to set him off.
Steve nods, liking the idea of having his doctor around. The last doctor he had experienced was no good, only caring about the future of Hydra and not that of the pup Steve was forced to bear. Not once did the doctor show him any remorse when his pup died, nor did he stop when Steve begged him not to take another away.
“No. I mean not really. One he lost, the other was sick and the other three-” Tony pauses, unsure of how to continue. He couldn’t tell Bruce that his mate had once belonged to an Alpha that used him for breeding. The story was crazy on so many levels. Tony himself had been guilty of not believing it.
“You’re leaving?” Steve asks, finally breaking the silence. He’s no longer staring down at his lap, and instead he lifts his head to connect his eyes with Tony’s. The deep frown etched on his face hasn’t left since they’ve started this conversation. “Why?”
Tony sends her a small smile of reassurance before she turns and leaves. The door closes on her way out.
Tony rolls over with a sigh, letting his eyes land on the ceiling above him. He has no problem taking the blame for their current fight. It was his jealousy that put him on the couch.
Bucky is still lying beside him, holding him tight and encouraging him with comforting words. The pain is getting worse with every passing minute, forcing Steve to cling to his best friend and muffle his cries against Bucky’s chest.
“Do you want a raise?” Tony asks and he pulls himself to his feet. “I can do that. Maybe a new position too.”
Tony sighs. “I just want to give you some space. I’ve probably come on too strong and...yeah. I’ll be in my lab if you need anything. Jarvis can probably help too so…”
“Before you were born, Steve disappeared from his own party because it was a little overwhelming. That’s why you’re hiding, right?”
“It’s okay, it’s okay,” Bruce assures and quickly comes over to assist. “This is good. I need to check your dilation, okay?”
“This is all that fits! And I’m not wearing your jeans because those are too big!” Peter exclaims, on the verge of tears.
Morgan looks around the room. The mess wasn’t terrible and she could probably have it cleaned up in five minutes, ten at the most. It would make her parents happy.
Steve nods, unable to form any real words at the moment. He collapses beside his husband, completely spent. “That was amazing.”
She turns on her heels and makes her way back to Peter, taking the empty seat beside him and wrapping an arm around him. Tony can only watch as she comforts him. It’s something he should be doing, and yet he feels like he can’t.
“Yeah, yeah I am. This place is-” Steve’s eyes wander around the room. “-it’s huge. I’m not used to living like this. The apartment I had in Brooklyn doesn’t compare.”
Steve still has his back turned. “Y-yeah,” he replies and he winces from how broken he sounds. He clears his throat and continues with the dishes. “Daddy makes good pancakes, huh?”
He doesn’t miss the confused look on his dad’s face when he steps into the kitchen for breakfast. Tony smirks behind his coffee cup when he recognizes the pants.
Steve sneaks out the front door. The corridor is empty, but he knew better than to trust that he was alone. Guards were constantly roaming through the compound. Though they didn’t come up to their leader’s private floor, they lurked around and monitored the lower levels.
It brings a smile to his face nonetheless. Clint and Natasha are both sitting in the middle of the room with the pups taking turns climbing on them as if they were pieces of a jungle gym. James and Harley are wrestling with Clint while Sarah is curled up beside Natasha and babbling about her baby brother in the alpha’s arms.
“Steve,” Tony pants and thrusts harder, hitting Steve’s prostate with each thrust. The base of his cock tingles, his knot growing and rubbing against Steve’s sensitive rim. “I’m gonna knot you. Fuck.”
The couch is just fine, but Tony would be lying if he said he didn’t want to be curled up around Steve instead. He huffs and adjusts the pillow Steve had given him, but sleep never comes. He can’t roll over much unless he plans on sleeping on the floor, so he lies on his back, his eyes glued to the dark ceiling above him.
Peter was still too young for Steve to notice anything strange about him. Hydra had wanted him because they believed he had the serum running through his veins. Steve didn’t know if he believed that. He couldn’t imagine his children being cursed with something like that. The serum aided him in many ways, but it also made him dangerous. A threat to others.
Steve doesn’t respond; he can’t. He grips the door handle and squeezes, no doubt crushing it and destroying more of the car. Tony shouldn’t mind.
“Cap!” Tony cries in panic. Blue eyes are shooting open and Steve raises his head, brows crinkling in confusion. “Sorry,” Tony apologizes. “Don’t fall asleep on me.”
“He can’t help you,” the alpha above him says and he forces Steve to look at him again. “I’m your alpha. I know you want this, want me.”
Steve sits down beside their daughter and leans down to kiss the top of her head. “I love you, sweetheart,” he whispers against her soft hair.
“Hey.” Tony is the first to greet. “Morgan missed you. I think she’s waiting for goodnight cuddles.”
“They talked to me too,” Happy says and with a sigh he leans back in his seat. His eyes grow misty again. “I didn’t even know if I helped them. I have no idea what the hell was going on with Tony. If he would’ve just…”
“And what? We still weren’t ready. I gave up a lot but I don’t regret our son. We have to be there for him.”
Peter was a month old and the thought of leaving him behind, even for just a few hours, made Steve uneasy. It was one thing for him to be separated from his son for a week because he was with Tony, but Peter alone with someone else, that was a different story.
“I got it,” Tony mumbles beside him. He’s exhausted, more so than he’s ever been, but he wants to do this. He wants to be a dad. “Go back to sleep.”
“We better get going,” Steve gestures with his head toward the door. “I have some pants you can borrow.”
With a huff Steve reaches over for his phone, finding the number he wants, only to hesitate to make the call. He wondered where Tony was or what he was doing; if he’d even answer his phone call.
“No! I mean yes but it was an accident and…” Tony sighs. “We were driving and the guy just came out of nowhere, right in front of the car.”
Pepper smiles softly and reaches across the desk to take one of his hands. “I know you want him back and things to be normal again. They’ll get there. It just takes time. Right now he needs you more than ever.”
Their last day in their apartment is bittersweet. It’s almost unrecognizable with the array of piled boxes that litter the once put together space. They had made this place their home, but now they had a new home waiting for them. They’d build it from the ground up, just like they had done before.
The ring is still on the kitchen counter. It’s a painful reminder of their latest fight. Not once has Steve ever taken his ring off. No matter how bad past arguments had been, the ring never came off.
Sorry that this has taken be a while to update. I’m starting a new job soon and moving into a new place so it’s been crazy! Thank you all for being patient with me and supportive. I appreciate it 😊 ❤️❤️❤️
Tony huffs and Steve can’t help but chuckle. “You can wait, Stark. I don’t remember getting a wake up call like that.”
He can’t help but let his eyes linger a little longer on the poster of a smiling father cradling his new baby. Peter wonders if he’ll be that happy when he’s holding his baby for the first time. It’s a scary thought, he can’t imagine holding something so delicate in his arms. He couldn’t even carry his workbooks down the hall without dropping one of them.
Someone is gripping his wrists, their hands tightening and trying to hold him down. Steve kicks and screams, begging to be let go. He can’t let it happen again.
Steve’s flushes and he throws an arm over his face to hide his growing blush. Tony frowns and gently removes his arm, wanting to see his beautiful mate.
Jarvis complies and shows the footage Tony had struggled to watch. It still hurts to see Steve’s smiling face and hear the sound of his laughter. But Tony forces himself to watch the full video.
“Being an Avenger is tough,” Tony agrees and he leans against the island and folds his arm over his chest. “A lot of sacrifices need to be made. He sacrificed Disney World I guess.”
“I could schedule an interview,” Pepper suggests and Tony takes a moment to think it over. “It will be more controlled and Steve won’t have to worry about a crowd full of people throwing questions at him.”
It’s his close friends that help him back on his feet. Tony figures they’re tired of seeing him deteriorate. He doesn’t protest, but he doesn’t tell them that they’re efforts aren’t working. He deserves to suffer. He doesn’t deserve happiness. Not when Steve lost his.
“Whatever you want. The choice is yours. I promise we’ll be fine with whatever you want to do. You want to chill in that guest room from time to time that’s cool with me. And if you’d rather stay with Nat then that’s fine too. There will be no hard feelings.”
“No,” Tony shakes his head. “I’ll do it. And if anything happens JARVIS can alert security. Um I have to deal with that now so... can we reschedule everything later?”
“Morning,” Steve mutters, deciding to be the civil one. Tony doesn’t reply at first and he takes another sip from his mug.
I know it wasn’t Pierce who ruined the party, but it’s still bad. Don’t worry I have plans for that guy 😉
“I think you need to take a minute,” Sam tells Bucky. He removes the hand he has on Bucky’s chest and reaches for Bucky’s cool, metal one. He knew what this arm was capable of, and he’d be lying if he said he wasn’t worried.
“It’s better than a press conference,” Tony reminds. He was right about that. Steve couldn’t imagine facing that many people and telling them his story.
“Tell me,” Tony says again, this time a little sterner. “You said we mated. Did I...force myself on you?”
Harley grows braver and stands up, wobbling for a moment before losing his balance and staggering forward. Steve catches him and to his surprise the pup doesn’t respond negatively. He allows Steve to pick him up.
Tony finds the omega fast asleep and curled up around his favorite pillows. Tony is able to recognize a few of the pillows from the couch. He almost doesn’t want to wake him, but Bruce would be arriving soon for the next appointment.
Tony frowns at them and directs his attention back at the baby in his arms, using Peter as distraction from his friends. Steve frees one arm from around Harley’s sleeping form to rub Tony’s shoulder.
Tony collapses in his chair, a choked sob escaping him. Countless articles and pictures of Steve fill Tony’s line of vision; it’s all he can see, and no matter how hard he tries, he can’t bring himself to look away.
But as he sits in the sterilized room and listens as the doctor tells him that his body was fine and healthy, he finds himself questioning the doctor.
Steve pulls away to glance up at him, his brows drawing together in confusion. “The two of us?” He repeats. “Tony, we have a baby now.”
Steve glances up at his mate, ready to apologize for coming on too strong. Tony had assured him that he wanted to take the pups in and raise them as his own, but Steve still can’t help but fear that he’s said something wrong.
“No,” Peter shakes his head. He grows nervous all of sudden, and his stomach grows queasy again. He glances at the small trash can in the corner of the room, contemplating if he’ll need it. He decides he doesn’t and takes long, slow breaths to calm himself. “I’m gonna get an abortion.”
“Fuck,” Tony breathes out and gently runs his fingers through Steve’s hair. “Honey, that was amazing. I might need a minute.”
“I screwed up. I get that. When are all of you going to let it go and move on from it? It seems like I’m the only one trying,” Tony tries to defend himself.
“I did.” The alpha nods, considering his original plan. “But then I discovered that you were the perfect donor. I had my suspicions. Why else would I ask for your contribution?”
“Shh. I don’t care about any of that. I think you’re beautiful, even more now than before. I don’t want to rush you. Baby steps, remember?”
They’re currently curled up in bed with Tony on the verge of passing out and Steve lying beside him. Steve is holding Tony close, gently rubbing his hand up and down his arm. His other hand is where it always is these days-resting on the small bump.
Tony nods and tries to do as he’s told. He closes his eyes and breathes steadily. Steve is touching him again, teasing his hole with the tip of his finger before slowly pressing it inside. Tony tenses, preventing Steve from pushing any further.
“Sit,” Alpha gestures toward the small table and chairs that are usually set up for dinnertime. Steve’s eyes flicker in the direction of the furniture, brows drawing together in confusion when he notices the two plates set up. It’s like the alpha could read his mind. “You’re joining me for dinner tonight,” he explains and he waves the omega over. “Sit, sit. You must be exhausted.”
Tony doesn’t even give Steve a chance to decide if that’s something he wants to do. The alpha is already on his phone and asking his friends to come down stairs.
The omega flinches when a hand comes out to touch his cheek. The feel of the alpha’s palm is familiar, it awakens nightmares Steve has tried to forget.
Tony joins Steve back on the bed, stretching one hand out to place over Steve’s thigh and remind him that he was still there. Steve jumps at the contact, then relaxes when Tony gently rubs circles along his leg and slides higher toward the inside of his thigh.
“No. I mean I don’t want this for him. I don’t want to spoil him with material things. My parents did that and I didn’t even want any of it. I wanted them.”
“Tony,” Bruce says, the tone of his voice bringing Tony’s attention back to him in an instant. “He’s not eating, and I heard you telling Natasha that he doesn’t care about-.”
Tony doesn’t know what it is that makes him conjure up such a ridiculous plan. Maybe it’s because he feels guilty for almost hurting the omega. Maybe it’s because he’s drawn to him in a way he never thought possible. Whatever the reason, Tony wants to act on his plan.
Tony rolls his eyes and rises to his feet. He doesn’t bother cleaning up his work station when he’d probably be back down to finish. He asks Jarvis to lock up the lab, then he’s going back up stairs.
“You should. I can’t imagine being you. Not that that’s a bad thing…” Steve sighs. “We’re just different I guess.”
“If you’re not going to take your education seriously then maybe you shouldn’t be training. Maybe you should be studying, right?”
“Just because my tower is there doesn’t mean I have to be. I can work remotely or travel if need be. I do it all the time,” Tony says.
His body is buzzing. There’s an itch under his skin that he just can’t seem to scratch. The feeling is familiar.
“I don’t want to wait anymore. I love you and I trust you. You’d never hurt me. You’re one of the good ones,” Steve says, his lips forming into a small smile.
“Hmm…” Tony hums. His brows scrunch together in confusion, reminding Steve of the times when he’s in is lab and stumped over an equation. “Maybe JARVIS can-”
She’s curious, that much Steve can tell. And maybe one day he’ll tell her everything, but he didn’t know the small group Tony insisted was both of their friends well enough and they’d just have to wait a little while longer until he felt comfortable to open up to them.
Clint curses and slams his fist down on the kitchen counter. “And what about him?” He gestures to the sleeping boy. “Wasn’t he more important?”
Tony sits up and grabs Steve’s pillow, then he leaves the bedroom and goes downstairs, deciding the couch would be more comfortable than the large empty bed.
“I’m fine.” Steve waves him off. He doesn’t mention the pain in his stomach; it’s already gone away and he’s forgetting about it. “Let’s go.”
“Yeah.” Tony nods. His eyes drift to the car seat laying near his feet. Morgan is still fast asleep. “I guess we better go. You and Happy wore her out.”
He was laid out on the bench, restrained with his arms and legs spread out, giving Tony the perfect view of his leaking hole. It’s tempting to rut up against him and fuck the omega, but Tony holds off.
They don’t speak after that. Steve has fallen back asleep, curled up in Tony’s arms and his nose buried in his neck. He’s purring, the sound soft and appeasing to Tony’s alpha side.
He knows where he needs to be, and without being noticed, he swings through the city until he reaches his father’s gravesite. It’s not a basic stone with his name and dates of birth and death; he was a symbol to many and greatly recognized. The bronze statue stands tall, a perfect replica of his father and the mighty shield that aided him in many battles. The base of the statue has his name, the two important dates, and an engraved message describing the type of person he was in life.
Steve shakes his head and sits up to lightly kiss Tony on the lips. “Keep going,” he says and lies back, his legs falling open.
“Hey, hey.” Tony is quick to pull Steve close. “You’re not a bad parent. You’re just dealing with a lot right now. It’s going to be okay. I promise.”
Tony swallows the lump that’s formed in his throat. “He was but they revived him, or maybe it was the serum. But he’s...I don’t know. I haven’t heard anything.”
On his way out, he can’t help but stop by his father’s office. The door is slightly ajar and he finds himself pushing it the rest of the way and stepping inside. Just like the rest of their home, the space is immaculate. Peter’s almost afraid him being in the room would somehow disrupt how his papa left it, but he can’t help but want to stay a little longer.
It would be easy to decline and walk straight out the door, but Peter finds himself considering to hear his dad out. He didn’t want to walk away without hearing what he had to say. He wasn’t like him.
True to his word, Nick had managed to keep Steve’s big secret hidden from the rest of the world and provide care for both himself and his unborn child. The medical staff worked for SHIELD and they too had orders to keep their mouths shut or else face consequences Steve was too nervous to question.
With his son fed and dozing off, and his boyfriend out on a morning run, Tony takes advantage of the quiet and works on his latest project. A few of his teammates were in dire need of an upgrade, and he had promised a week ago that it would be completed. But taking care of a baby and checking up on SI left him little time for anything else.
Pepper chuckles and wraps the tie around Tony’s neck. “So you two are good? He hasn’t been by much, or I just miss it.”
Steve makes his way over and Tony turns in his seat, smiling brightly at him. “Morning, sleepyhead. How’d you sleep?”
Tony nods, forcing a smile. It leaves his face the minute Steve is gone. With a heavy sigh, Tony directs his attention back to his daughter, their eyes meeting.
Tony doesn’t tell his son that he’s afraid to go back, especially during Steve’s birthday party. He doesn’t tell Peter that showing up to the party would probably end up causing more harm than good. The last thing he wanted to do was show up and somehow ruin the event.
After a few minutes, Natasha lowers her gun. It slips through her fingers and hits the floor. The ear muffs come off next and land beside the forgotten gun, and that’s when Peter sees her break down for the first time. She screams and drops to her knees, her back hunching over and hands coming up to cradle her head. She pulls at her red hair, releasing another scream and sob.
California was growing on him. The weather was comfortable and the days were always sunny. This time of year New York was cool, but it was still Steve’s home. He had envisioned meeting an alpha there and raising their large family. He missed Brooklyn.
A shaky breath leaves him when he steps inside. He glances toward the kitchen, remembering all the meals they prepared together. A lot of the time it failed, but it didn’t matter because it was a chance for them to be together and have fun.
Steve remains silent but does as he’s told. He gingerly lowers himself down in a chair, his eyes never leaving the alpha’s face. Something feels off about being in his presence. Steve wishes he was back in his room.
The SUV pulls away and disappears behind the tower, out of sight and away from the swarm of news reporters.
Steve is ready to protest, but even if he wanted to, he’d never be given the chance. His belly contracts and the urge to push can no longer be ignored. He grips the side of his seat and gives in to his body’s need, bearing down as hard as he can. His efforts pay off and more of his daughter emerges.
Steve wrestles with the men holding him down, desperate to break the chains around his wrists, but he’s bound tight and his efforts to get free prove futile. He doesn’t give up, not when his son needs him now more than ever. The shackles around his wrists dig deep into his skin the more he struggles, but the stinging pain is the least of his concern. He needed to get his son back.
Peter wants to decline; he’s not even hungry, but he doesn’t want to leave his uncles just yet. He enjoyed staying over. They bickered sometimes but his papa always told him it was what married couples do.
Their relationship was never going to be the same now that they were adding Peter into the mix, but sticking together was something they had to do for their son.
Tony sighs sadly. “Stupid, stupid things. I was a kid myself, a little older than you actually. I honestly didn’t know how to cope with it.”
“I know. I didn’t mean for it to go south. Just too many of them I guess. And I didn’t have you,” Steve points out.
“It’s all your fault. You ruined everything!” Peter screams and he fires strings of web at the shield, not caring if he’s ruining the memorial. He yanks on the strands and pulls as hard as he can; the stone shield begins to crack. “I don’t want this stupid shield! I don’t want it!”
Tony crawls off the bed to grab the other pair of handcuffs and attach one end around Steve’s wrist and the other to the bed frame. Just like the other one, Steve tests it out and is just as pleased as Tony to find it strong enough to keep him in place.
That seems to get the beta’s attention. He narrows his eyes, unsure of what his friend was telling him was true.
Well now these two have a baby and a whole lot to figure out! It's so weird for me to be writing them after a breakup and having the baby in the beginning of the story lol Like I said in my first note, I don't know what's going to happen next so if any of you have any ideas or want to see anything, just let me know! I need some inspiration! Thank you for reading!
“No, you’re not. You’re not supposed to present or let me take control. This is about you. You’re in control now.”
Pepper sighs and moves around the desk, lowering herself into her own chair. “I can’t. All I can think about is him and Steve and...their son.”
The nursery is illuminated by a nightlight plugged into one of the outlets, painting the room in a soft glow. Steve’s eyes are already well adjusted and he can easily make out his son’s fussy form in the crib.
Just like the message had said, Peter finds his dad outside the compound. He’s dressed sharply like he normally is, the only thing missing is his signature sunglasses, giving Peter full access to his eyes and the emotions behind them. He appears happy, his eyes shining with excitement at the sight of his son, but there’s more than just happiness behind them. There’s fear and hurt.
For the first time in a long time, Tony falls asleep in his bed. It’s warmer now that Steve’s in it.
The only thing missing is the person on everyone’s mind. Peter wishes just once he’d catch a glance of his father in the kitchen with his uncles. They were always spending time together.
“Daddy, again!” Harley exclaims, his eyes full of excitement. He’s not the only one. His older brother is just as excited to see their father blow up something else.
“I've been through worse,” Steve replies and lays his head back, eyes focusing on the ceiling above him. He can still feel eyes on him and he knows it’s Tony staring at him again. He can’t bring himself to stare back.
Before Steve can form any words, his pups are rushing toward him to welcome him with hugs and kisses. Steve smiles and kneels down to properly greet them.
“Yes!” Steve practically shouts. The feeling of Tony’s fingers was too much. He was going to come again. “Fuck me!”
Tony releases a sob and collapses on the couch, hunching forward and burying his face into his hands, sobbing into them. The video is still playing in the background, the sound of Steve’s laughter only making Tony cry harder.
I’m sorry if it’s taking me so long to update. I felt like I’ve lost my muse or something. I’ve also gotten into another fandom ship and have been thinking of writing something for them. Maybe on another account or something. I don’t know. Stony is still my number one and I’ll never stop writing them!
“Don’t mention it.” Tony hugs his son back, then he pats Peter’s shoulder and pulls away. “I guess this is perfect timing. I have designs for your room.”
The bedroom door is wide open, giving Steve a perfect view of a very irritated Tony. Steve can’t help but smirk to himself and lean against the doorframe to watch the scene a little longer. Tony is clearly struggling with his jeans, huffing and puffing as he fights with the little button that never used to give him problems before.
“I’m sorry!” Peter cries out, tears streaming down his face. “I’m so sorry! It was just a stupid party at Liz’s house and I-”
“Your guess is as good as mine. He won’t talk to me about it. To be honest I don’t think he knows what he wants to do. He wouldn’t even tell me how the father took the news.”
Tony is awake and dressed by the time Steve makes it back to the apartment. He’s casually leaning against the kitchen counter and nursing on a cup of coffee. Steve sends a disapproving look his way.
The alpha had apologized. No other alpha has ever done that before. They usually took what they wanted and left; no apologies, no regrets. But this one had shocked Steve the moment he apologized.
Steve arrives home later than usual. Tony would be lying if he said he wasn’t concerned about the tardiness. The alpha in him grows uneasy and afraid of any potential threats to his mate.
Tony locks himself away for the rest of the night. It’s better this way. At least then he wouldn’t be near Steve and risk hurting him again. It seems like everything he did was causing some kind of harm to the omega. But none of his actions compared to the horrible thing he did when Steve was still held captive.
Steve smiles and gets back to his sketch. “I like it. I’m not sure where it came from but I like it. If you don’t…”
“He looks so much like you,” Tony comments, his eyes taking in the same familiar features Steve had been doing. “We don’t have a name for him, huh?”
“I will if you keep doing that. You know how much I love this part. I mean, the sex was great, not gonna lie,” Tony says.
The nightmares were something he still struggled with and every night he was waking up screaming or drenched in a cold sweat. His mate was there to pull Steve close and comfort him, soothing him back to sleep with his calm voice and scent.
Steve rolls his eyes and reaches for the rest of the ice cream, chuckling when Natasha cries out and tries to take it back.
“I get that. Then why do this?” Tony gestures to the decorations and the banner, his heart sinking at the words displayed.
“Don’t. I’m fine, J. You know I always get like this,” Tony replies and continues with his current task. He reaches for the glass again, only to pause and roll his eyes when he hears Jarvis sigh.
“That’s not right,” Bruce says and he takes off his glasses to rub at his eyes. “This kid doesn’t deserve any of this.”
“Sir,” JARVIS decides to finally speak up. Too late. Tony wasn’t interested in what he had to say. It wasn’t like JARVIS cared. “I recall you promising to quit drinking. Do I have to remind you of your son?”
For now, someone else would have to take the shield. Steve had always envisioned Sam taking his place until Peter was ready to lead the team. He hadn’t had a chance to sit down with his teammates and discuss what would happen once he stepped down. They knew that day was coming; Steve made it clear that he wanted to be a father first.
But he’s been feeling off lately and the little voice in the back of his head reminds him to go out and get a test. Maybe he was being too hopeful, but he can’t help it. He’s been through enough suffering, and all he wanted was something right to happen.
The day they learned they were having a boy, Tony immediately began preparations for the nursery. It was both amusing and exciting to see his boyfriend obsess over their son. There was no doubt in Steve’s mind that Tony would be a great father. He had seen how he was with Dodger, and his relationship with their son was going to be full of nothing but love.
Tony hums and cups Steve's face. “I love you, too. Even if you are in better shape than me. But I guess that’s nothing new.”
“I know, I know. But what else could this be? I haven’t seen you this sick in a long time. You haven’t had any bad shrimp.”
“About time,” Bucky tells the god. “And would it kill you to have a normal entrance? You’re scaring my kid.”
I told you I’d update again! I swear I’m trying not to since I have other stories that need my attention but I just have so much planned for this one I guess 🤷♀️
Peter sniffs again and uses the sleeve of his hoodie to wipe his eyes. “It’s okay. Sorry. I’m a big baby, huh?”
“Uh sorry. I was with Ned and then I went to the cemetery again.” Peter doesn’t feel that guilty about his lie. He wasn’t telling a complete lie.
The elevator dings when it arrives and the doors open. Peter gasps when a tall woman with auburn hair appears on the other side. He wasn’t expecting anyone else to be in the tower, especially this early in the morning. He panics, unsure of what he’s supposed to do or say.
“You see it, too? I thought it was just me,” Tony says followed by a sigh. “I don’t know what’s going on.”
