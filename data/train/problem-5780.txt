" Steve said again, and there were sentences in that utterance, there were paragraphs, there was a whole damn
Steve had thought about it so many times. He wanted to kiss him both in victory and in quiet pride of everything Iron Man stood for. He'd never said anything about it to Iron Man, but Steve knew it must have been written across his face more than once.
a name that bears a weight in modern society that Steve thinks might be a lot like the pressure of the name
No. Probably not. Tony's ego was bandied around so easily when people talked about him, like it was some massive thing, like he didn't care about anyone but himself. Like it swallowed up all the good things he did, bigger than all the charity work he did, or the hours he put in to make sure his employees were safe and protected. They were wrong. Tony's reputation might be a fucking tire fire, but he didn't deserve to be used. Not by anyone.
Tony frowned. Steve looked distinctly unimpressed, verging on angry. Tony knew that look; Steve meant business. "Can I at least get some recovery time first?" Steve looked unconvinced. "I need a lot of time. In bed. To get better." Steve was definitely being swayed. "In bed."
Tony doesn't go catatonic again. Instead, their morning routine swiftly changes; Steve comes out of the bathroom to Tony's eyes, trained on him, and Steve's nodding yes before the question's even asked.
Tony let Steve's door open fully, showing the gaping, clinical emptiness within. Jan ambled over, shock replacing her concern.
Steve huffed a laugh; Tony risked a glance to the side to see a hint of a pink hue in Steve's cheeks. "Maybe it's excess holiday spirit."
Tony swallowed up his words in another eager kiss, because otherwise he'd argue that maybe, technically, he made the first move, hadn't he? "I am," Tony replied, just as coherent as Steve, "I am
The further he walked, the lighter he felt. That was probably a bad thing. Or a good thing. It meant he
Carol smiled, almost fondly. Tony missed the version of Carol that looked at him like that. "Exactly," she agreed. "That's
Tony let Steve struggle untangling the lights for five minutes before stepping in to rescue him; he tried to tell himself that it was because he was enjoying the equalization of their inadequacies, not because he was still rattled by imagining Steve might have wanted to kiss him.
, and instead, he ended up sending Professor Eitri floating in a giant bubble to the rafters of the dining room. Eitri had a hatred of heights; he promptly quit, as soon as he landed back on the ground.
Tony tried to hang around anyway, but Steve just kept looking at him with sad eyes, and Sarah was crying, picking up on their tension, and Steve wouldn't budge.
Iron Man's navigated them to a quieter part of the floor and now Steve can hear Iron Man's actual voice and oh, it's…
Every morning, he takes the time to make them breakfast, changing it up as often as he can. He plans dates for them, at least once a week. One day, Steve looks up from the dials to see that Tony's torn apart all the paper packaging from the food to make a shadow theater, and he tells Steve the truncated adventures of Harry Potter, a whiny wizard who dies to save the world (Steve cries before Tony can explain Harry comes back from the dead.)
Iron Man glances at the doors and then back at Steve. His pretty mouth is pushed into a line. "I'm sorry to cut this moment short. And I was having such fun."
"You know Mr. Stark really well, don't you?" Steve asks. "To know about him not having any food allergies, I mean."
He decided to give Steve a taste of his own medicine, attacking him in the hallway, just outside the training room, when Steve had been on his way for a scheduled sparring session with T'Challa, Robbie, and Carol.
what it is I'm feeling. If I manage to get it out in words, then these misunderstandings wouldn't happen the way they do. If I could have talked, I wouldn't have gotten too far into things with Bernie when my heart wasn't fully in it. I wouldn't have let Rachel take me over lines I wasn't happy crossing. And Sharon – Sharon wouldn't have—" Steve closed his eyes and shuddered, unable to finish the end of whatever that sentence would have been. "It's a lie that I don't know what my feelings are. I know exactly what I'm feeling, but I get scared. I get scared, and I run away. Instead of just
"Don't tell him you said that," Iron Man says. "His head might grow so big he can't fit through doorways."
conditions, which in hindsight was a mistake. It was the tactical equivalent of saying “hey, what’s the worst that could happen?”, which as everyone knew was the magical phrase that would invite disaster into your day.
expression, although Steve's fists weren't clenched in anticipation of an actual fight. "Is there a problem?"
the mask as a grown adult was beyond humiliating. Better for Tony to wear one more mask so he could pretend to be a functioning person. "But—you're going to laugh."
"You should tell me," Tony demanded, instantly. "When I wake up from this in my body again, you should tell me
Tony opened his mouth to protest, but stumbled, a rush of something washing through him. When he looked up, Okoye and T'Challa were gone again. Dammit. And Steve – he had a beard now?
Steve's eyes were wet, but he wasn't crying; he was just shaking his head over and over like he couldn't believe any of this. "What the hell does it say about me, that I'd rather throw myself in front of a thirty-foot troll with just a shield to protect me, than talk about my own feelings?"
Tony's not wearing a costume either, just a well-tailored suit. Those thighs are subtly hidden under smooth dark fabric, but Steve knows they're there,
It turns out that when somewhat caught in a lie, Tony gets these small spots of pink, high on his cheeks. "Yeah, I—yeah. He tells me things, sometimes."
Steve frowned at that like he didn't fully believe it, but looked up for his next question. "Weren't Jen and Thor a thing?"
A horrible, practical voice said if Tony died, Steve could risk snapping the pole, try to dig his way out. How could his strategic mind still be ticking like that, when his active mind—the part that admired Iron Man so much—said if Tony died, Steve should just close his eyes and hope not to be found? This parking structure was as ugly as sin; functioning as a tomb would suit it far better.
"Only you think this is morning," Tony assured him and then he nodded at the tree. "Thought I'd get this set-up while my diary wasn't trying to eat me alive."
Tony glanced up at the rearview mirror again, expecting to see Happy still amused at his expense, but there was a soft smile on Happy Hogan's round face. Happy was a good man; Tony was lucky to have him. It was a shame that he hadn't been able to keep Iron Man's identity from Happy, as the knowledge seemed to put him in danger more often than not, but at the same time, it was nice to have someone as dependable and kind as Happy to share the secret with.
Steve squints at Tony, almost wanting to tell him that his Iron Man was showing. He should. This is probably the right time to tell him. If Tony's this messed up by a couple of kisses, maybe he'd be okay with the fact it was Steve all along? Steve can shuffle closer, tell Tony he knows the identity of the mystery guy, it'll be fine.
"Do we have to talk about this now?" Tony shoots Steve an appalled look; Avalanche is shooting wave after wave of energy at them, loosing so much debris on them that Tony's having a hard time blasting it away before it hits them.
time of year, you mean," Robbie snarked, and then looked guilty like he'd only just realized who he'd been overly familiar with. "Uh, sorry. I'm just tired."
Tony nodded throughout it all, shell-shocked. Steve had a baby. An actual baby. For real. That was legally his.
"Oh, there you are," Steve says, moving to stand between them. He turns to smile at who he is 99% sure is Iron Man, and the last 1% of certainty slides into place when he sees the bright blue eyes peering at him through a mask made of black leather and peacock feathers. "Finding someone in a sea of masks is quite the ordeal."
human inside the suit was pretty damn exceptional. But by then, I was just honored to fight by his side."
"I hate the McCallisters, they have no idea about the sacred space of a good party," Tony says and Steve stares at him, because
Steve wakes on Day 601 and nearly forgets how to breathe, because Tony's back is toward him in a curve, and he reaches out desperately because he can't lose Tony again like that, he can't, he won't survive it—
"I wanna see if we can." Steve's gaze flickered to the door, like it was see-through, like he could see the others beyond it, before he returned to staring intently at Tony. "I don't—the others—"
Steve and he were just holding hands. Just one hand. There was no way it should possibly feel this good.
Tony took pleasure in the fact that Steve sounded a little wounded at the idea that Tony would talk to Carol first, and not Steve. "We exchanged a couple of words," Tony said. Steve's face fell a little more. "About twenty-six."
"Good. I need you to reach into my helmet. On the right side is a small strip of fabric. It won’t look like much, but it’ll do the job."
"Remember what I told you earlier about the systems here having backup generators for every floor?” Iron Man asked.

because wounds were impossible puzzles. Wounds were shitty little hungry creatures that ate and ate and ate what you pushed into them. And Tony
"I needed another baseline reading from Tony's body," Strange said, slowly. "I promise you, all my resources are focused on figuring this out."
Steve pulled a noise which either meant he hated that Tony had said something like that, or maybe he didn't like the implication that they'd
Then again, maybe Steve doesn't always make the best decisions on his own, so maybe Jarvis has a point.
something amazing. It was such a big thought that Tony, for the briefest moment, almost wanted to run, rather than strip himself open, rather than be so vulnerable to another person. But then he remembered Steve in the kitchen, bravely taking that first move, and that's something Tony needed to learn too. He needed to learn to be as brave as Steve.
"No. It’s a deduction. I’ve seen how slowly you recover from some hits. You get bashed up in that tin can of yours. Has to be hell on the human beneath the armor. You always disappear into the mansion after a mission, and I’ve been on every floor of the mansion but the third sub-basement, where you’ve said he stores the submarine. So, unless Mr. Stark has a hospital somehow squeezed into the space—"
Steve. Tony could run back to his car and drive back to New York overnight and no one would ever know he'd failed. No one would ever believe a random nobody in Maine who said Tony Stark had briefly appeared on their doorstep for ten seconds.
I hate the idea that I might only get to know who you are from your gravestone. Or a...a toe tag! Even the idea of having to admit to hospital doctors that I have no idea who you are—this is—this is so unfair—you’re so amazing and you deserve the world! Not dying in a hole like this with just me; in pain
Tony's lap. Tony was a frozen, captive audience. All he could do was watch as Steve swung a leg easily over Tony's and slowly settled his weight down, obviously bearing some of it himself. His movements were slow, but deliberate. Steve was broadcasting them clearly. Giving Tony plenty of time to react and push him away.
get something he wanted so much, but Steve's weight on his anchored him, as much as Steve's kissing was sending him off into the stratosphere.
"Tony," Jan said, emerging from her bedroom, close to Steve's; her hair was a mess and she was wearing a big fluffy robe covered with pink hearts. She looked at his downcast face and looked instantly worried. "What's wrong."
"Ha." Steve's exhaled laugh was bitter. He wasn't amused by that, but then, neither was Tony, that their dynamic would be boiled down to something that didn't feel true.
Steve glared at him. Tony stared back, smug, like he'd won this weird argument. ″Wants,″ Steve muttered, after a long pause.
Steve hopes Iron Man is as disgusted as he is; he doesn't feel as bad for interrupting as he would have had he not been eavesdropping.
There was a beep at his console; someone else demanding entrance to his lab. So that was why Steve had pulled back; he must have heard them approaching. Tony pressed the command to let them in and he smiled warily over to Thor.
When the date comes, it's really nice. Italian food, a lovely tasting menu, and Steve's engaged enough when Tony talks, laughing politely at the funny parts. But still, Tony feels like something is wrong. Like only half of Steve has come on the date with him.
"Listen—" Iron Man starts, and then there's a loud coughing noise behind them and Steve freezes, in absolute mortification. It's almost like cold water's been thrown over them, except not enough, because Steve immediately realizes how compromising they look. It's worse when Steve lifts his heated, embarrassed gaze to realize it's Jarvis standing at the open door.
Tony side-eyes Steve. "This is not a respectable hour in anyone's morning." He sighs. "It's just—I met this guy—" And then Tony freezes, like he's said something wrong.
Tony was an ex-Merchant of Death with blood on his hands he'd never be clean of. He'd been such an idiot, kidding himself that he could ever be worthy of someone as pure and good as Steve. Tony was good enough to sneak around with. A warm body for a good time, but that's all he could be. Of course Steve wouldn't
Tony huffed, “I’ll keep that in mind for future.” He darted in with a brief kiss, fast like he wasn’t sure he was allowed to, but like he wanted to steal one anyway, while he could. ″I'm so glad I didn't die before getting to kiss you like this,″ Tony whispered.
maintain the surprise, if you go to bed now. Then you can still be surprised by how I decorate it this year."
So he mentally put on his big boy pants, finished the damn latches, packed up his toolkit, and shakily announced to Steve that he was going.
trying to figure out who was yanking strings behind the scenes, and aching in guilt for not being able to save Friday.
But that moment, if it was even real in the first place and not wishful thinking on Tony's behalf, didn't last long enough.
Tony was glad he had the safety latches to focus on. It meant he was doing something active with his hands, and when he was doing that, he wasn't thinking, and if he wasn't thinking about this whole thing, he wouldn't be screaming.
Tony was already busy thinking of a way to make a repulsor-powered flying sleigh with holographic reindeer for next year, but that was beside the point. He had turned up at the Annual Toybox Appeal expecting to do his usual job, convincing other rich businessmen to add extra zeroes to their checks, only to find the staff in a flap because their Santa had passed out in the staff room.
Steve leans across so his mouth is by Tony's ear. "I guess I haven't done a good enough job, if you're still able to think."
"You said that—" Steve started, struggling to keep his voice even because his eyes were stinging. The truth hurt, but not in the way Tony was probably dreading. The words he had said before implied Tony was expecting
Somehow – maybe because Steve was standing there looking strung-out and a thousand miles away from happy, or maybe because Tony was exhausted from fighting and didn't have the energy to mount a defense, or maybe just because Tony was so in love with the asshole standing in front of him that he couldn't
he rarely faltered for long. He straightened his shoulders and looked away, starting to unwrap his gloves, looking at them like he wasn't freaking out.
Steve carefully gave it a shake between two fingers, being careful not to jostle the pole. He didn't know what he'd been expecting, but a face full of material wasn't it. He pushed the fabric away until he could see again.
"It’s practical," Steve insisted, pushing past the shame. "We will be found soon. But you’re hurt. And hurt bad. You can’t just go to Tony Stark and have him patch you up in his basement—"
"How can you know that?" Steve asked, his eyes scraping over Tony's limp hand, clasped between both of his own.
They barely could be alone in the same room together for more than a few seconds before Steve's mouth found Tony's, and they were kissing like the end of the world was imminent.
"Ha, ha," Tony said, slowly. The cookies left in the tin were all fancily frosted. As difficult as it was to stop milk from soaking the beard, Tony didn't want to have to explain white goo to the dry cleaners, so he peeled off his gloves and placed them neatly on the table before reaching into the tin and passing one to Steve.
"And cause a diplomatic incident? That's a brave idea. Fetch the extinguisher, I can summon the suit, a handy repulsor blast should cause a good enough conflagration—" Tony looked at Steve then, taking pity on him again; Steve did look a little stunned. "I believe Doom thinks it would be
"He's not there," Strange said, frowning down at Tony's body after doing a multiple number of things that looked ridiculous and were, in Tony's opinion, unsurprisingly useless.
There was a rattling noise of someone loosening a chain, drawing back a bolt, and then the door opened.
Baby-proofing Steve's house was even easier than Tony imagined; he made an early-morning run to a nearby hardware store, slinging on a baseball cap and sunglasses and promptly ruining his disguise by using his credit card, but thankfully Tony was able to pass it off with a laugh and a muttered,
This time, Steve was slumped over Tony's body. He was asleep. Tony felt something akin to an ache ripple right through him. He hated seeing Steve like that.
until they realize Steve is working from the books and Tony's working from the movies; that somehow makes it funnier. Steve tries to introduce him to Tom Bombadil, but he can't really sing; he improvises and uses the puppets to tell Tony some stories about the Howling Commandos instead.
The circulation to Iron Man’s stomach had been cut, then. Steve had to fight to keep his breathing even. Iron Man was probably clammy under the armor, and adrenaline would be keeping Iron Man’s heart rate up. It was when it dropped that it would be a problem, because that would mean low blood pressure. It also meant that he’d probably lost around three quarters of a liter of blood already. Damn it.
"Kissing," Steve said, because he was an irritating little shit sometimes; Tony didn't know why he liked him so much, but he
Tony stopped suppressing his smirk. "You know me too well. Only it wasn't scissors." Steve looked confused until Tony held up his hand, palm forward.
long enough? This was working, wasn't it? Steve was already starting to frown, and Tony wondered with a sharp pang in his stomach if Steve had figured out what he was about to suggest, and was reacting accordingly, but then—
Jan gropes at Iron Man's upper arm again; Steve frowns at her but her face just lights up as she backs off. "That's much less fun to do now, Shell-head. But it's
He was weary now. All he wanted was to lie down and let Steve kiss him and – no, no, that wasn't a good idea. It hadn't been a good idea at all. That's probably why Tony had been so swift to agree to keep their dating (god, that was
Steve had been so unreserved with his attraction. If he closes his eyes, he can remember the way Tony had drawn
"It's fine," Tony says, reassuringly, even though his own heart is sinking. Well, it's not like his heart isn't already damaged; what's a little more bruising to add to the scars, eh?
"Right," Tony says. "Well. I just. I can't stop thinking about him. I never have this problem. Ever. So...I guess I just don't know what to do."
in Steve's eyes, that made Tony's heart leap. Three times, now. Three times in quick succession, and Tony couldn't be imagining this, could he? Steve wanted to kiss him.
and didn't want any of them to know, so he was nobly running away to die alone in the state of lobster shacks and pine trees?
Steve holds out his arm to her. He hates dancing, but he'd hate to let Jan down more. "I'd love to dance," he lies.
" He hummed under his breath. She didn't settle until he started singing AC/DC. There was probably something wrong with Steve's baby, especially when she fell asleep to Tony singing about being on a doomed kind of road.
Eventually, Tony pulls away, shivering; Steve tugs him even closer to compensate and Tony makes a contented noise as he settles into Steve's chest.
"I stand corrected," Iron Man says, and pulls Steve back into another devastating kiss. Steve's knees actually go weak, which he's almost pissed off about, because he'd assumed that was some sort of lie concocted by Hollywood, but then he's too consumed by Iron Man to even be angry for long. Iron Man kisses like he fights, control and ruination, and Steve moans, because he can't help it, he's never been so quickly turned on by a simple kiss, although what's simple about this?
Steve knows Tony now, better than he'll ever know anyone again. He probably shouldn't like the thought of that so much.
Instead, Steve moved the Thor figurine to the tree and slipped it over one of the branches, staring intently like it might throw its tiny hammer and fly off he wasn't careful.
"Your muscles," Carol clarifies, staring openly at Iron Man's arms and legs. "We always assumed Stark just formed the metal that way to look intimidating. But you're really that strong?"
Tony lowered his arms and turned his head to squint at Steve in the dim light of the storage closet. Steve was smirking. Tony probably couldn't blame him. "I got it up there to start with."
not some faceless stranger. "What kind of person refuses to remove their mask anyway?" he adds, unable to remove the sourness from his tone.
should be so lucky." He dusted his hands on his pants and ushered for Steve to fold up the ladder; he took it from him as he grinned up at his handiwork. Anyone coming into this room would be surprised by it. It was an excellent placement. When he glanced across at Steve to gloat at how great this idea was, Steve was frowning. Captain Killjoy, Tony thought, carrying the ladder back over the tree so he could hang the higher ornaments more easily.
Tony did the math on their first day there. Two hundred dials, each with fifty potential numbers. Tony tried to figure out just one dial at first like each was an individual safe to crack; it took them four reset days to figure out that each dial just needed to be set to one number. That still meant there is….a lot of possible permutations. On day 6, Tony spoke a number out loud which had approximately 47 zeroes.
"I guess you're not as dumb as me and you actually know who you—" Tony frowns, failing at finding an end to that sentence he's happy with. Steve can empathize. Words are difficult. "Anyway, is that going somewhere?"
been wearing his armor at the time in order to lift the crates on his own; he didn't have the armor on right now, so moving to let Steve pick it up was the smartest option.
Tony couldn't even hate Steve for it, because it was self-sacrificing, and noble, and pretty damn heroic.
Iron Man makes a gesture and the material instantly hardens again; he raps on his head and a clanging noise rings out. "And now it's polarized," he says.
"Just—the location. I thought maybe you'd put it in the corner, if you were gonna hang it. Here's dangerous." Steve squinted up at Tony. "Anyone could end up underneath."
Tony straightened up from his slump of misery and began to plan instead. He wasn't a quitter. He would go and find a hotel room, and return to Steve's house in the morning, refreshed and ready to apologize for overstepping his bounds (he didn't think inquiring about nurseries and doctors was an overstep, but Steve clearly felt so, which was the important thing), and get the answers he needed that would help him convince Steve to come back to New York with his kid. Tony could totally baby-proof the tower; he'd
"Because you always have to get involved." Steve's jaw was clenched mulishly; he ran his spare hand through his hair, leaving it stuck up every which way. Tony had the instant urge to comb it flat again and he swallowed; trying to do that would just prove Steve right. "This isn't your kid, Tony. She's mine. I'm going to raise her however damn well I please."
Tony beamed like it was a brilliant compliment. "I already moved the crates to one of the storage closets. Help me get them out?"
Well. Their superhero names, anyway. Steve dutifully hands them around—Falcon, Wasp, Vision, Ms. Marvel, Beast, and the last one's for him—before he realizes there isn't one for Iron Man.
Tony followed Strange through the Mountain next. It was weird, walking; he had to remain focused, or his toes would dip into the steel, make it look like the corpse they lived in was trying to swallow him up. Maybe it was. Maybe it was the teleporter itself that had caused this...temporary evacuation from his body.
"True love's kiss wakes people in fairy tales," Jan beamed at him. "Tony and I aren't dating anymore, but I still love him. Platonic love is
Tony tried lying down in his body again, concentrating enough so he could scoot up onto the bed. It didn't work. He didn't think it would. When he closed his eyes, he opened them to Steve looming over him again.
"I need to take a look at the site of the attack," Strange said, straightening up and backing away from Tony's body.
"Some people just don't have their brains connected to their mouths," Iron Man sighs. He glances over Steve's shoulder then back at Steve. "Speaking of, I know it's a dire request, but you wouldn't mind being my hero one more time, would you?"
He did fall, and land hard, but it wasn't on stone. Steve was a wash of pain; he felt at his chest, awkwardly realizing he did at least still have his wand. Why hadn't he used
,″ Steve said. Wait. That probably wasn't quite right. Tony's kisses had kind of melted his brain. Tony was laughing, so it was most likely
"Thank you for the offer." Tony stretched his smile into a more rueful variety. "I'm kind of seeing someone at the moment. Thanks, though."
"Your reputation..." Steve added, his voice trailing off at the end, unaware that Tony's glass insides were shattering to fine, sharp sand; Tony was a silence broken by a cry; Tony was a heart that couldn't remember how to beat.
"I'm considering it." Tony tried to keep that gruff element in his voice. Steve was sitting so close to him. Did Steve
Steve hurriedly gulps in cool air, willing his body to calm down, but Iron Man still lingering close isn't helping, being all handsome and distracting and ridiculously hot, seriously, how come Tony Stark makes someone so attractive hide their body so entirely?
If it hadn't been the logs that required passwords that couldn't be faked, and camera footage from several directions of Steve voluntarily leaving the tower with two big bags, with no one forcing him out at gunpoint, Tony was sure people would believe him that something must have happened.
When Steve had returned to life, Tony had just been so desperate. He'd spent so long pleading and begging helplessly to the void for Steve to come back. Just him being
It was a complicated story, compounded by the accompanying sensation that Tony couldn't shake: that he was actually losing his mind.
"Apart from a hint of some impressive downstairs numbers, no." Iron Man's voice sounds genuinely annoyed, even suppressed and camouflaged by the modulator, and Steve flushes, because, oh god, Tony had noticed that?
Steve takes a deep breath and forces his expression to stay level, because it's been over a week now since the masquerade ball, so it must have been some other lucky guy grabbing Tony's attention.
Steve's abdomen feels tight. Of course Tony's going to see Steve again. They see each other every day, what is he talking about?
Tony's voice had gone missing, but Steve's hadn't. Steve straightened his shoulders and stared at Tony.
wanted, but the concept of leaving Steve was so painful. But it would only grow worse if he stretched it out any longer.
"Ha, ha, you're hilarious. Nah, it's nothing." Tony waves a hand casually, like he's trying to affirm it's no big deal, but he stares intently into space, like something really is bothering me.
Tony grinned briefly. "I hear you. Caffeine is the only thing keeping me running at this time of year."
"And there's absolutely nothing you want for Christmas?" Tony blurted out, desperate to say something normal. He was definitely sweating. Maybe he should get the Santa suit dry-cleaned
Iron Man's smirk does something to Steve that leaves him a little dizzy. "You don't have to leave your hand there, y'know."
to sit so close? Tony resisted the urge to adjust his fake beard. Casual. That was what he needed to be. Santa
Happy beamed. "You can call me Happy, if you like. Everyone does. Except today I guess you can call me Rudolph."
"I don't like the idea of any of us being alone right now," Jen said, shaking her head at Tony. "C'mon, Stark, wake the hell up. You're freaking us out. And Steve's freaking us out too."
Baby-proofing, though; there was a thought. Tony hadn't seen much of Steve's new house, but he'd caught a glimpse of an open socket, and a sharp table edge. He'd put good money on the fact that Steve was so overwhelmed by learning how to parent Sarah that he hadn't had time to learn you were
"You could have asked me to help," Steve said. There was a thread of something through his voice that Tony couldn't identify and Steve's expression was carefully blank.
When Tony comes out of the bathroom, his expression is drawn. Steve hates that his first impulse is to hurry in after him; he hates that he exhales
infecting his armor. He should really look into seeing if Shevaun Haldane would be interested in working for him again.
There's a moment of dismay, that Tony hadn't trusted him to keep the secret, but that's quickly swept away, because Steve gets it. It's important that Tony and Iron Man are separate identities; Iron Man can do things that Tony Stark could never do. And Steve can feel it now, the thrill of being someone
"What?" Steve whirled on his heel to stare at Tony in wide-eyed, slack-mouthed confusion. "Of course not, I'd never – Your reputation is
need to learn to talk to each other and use our actual words." He pulled a wry face. "That is, if you still want to. Y'know. With me." Ugh, okay, that wasn't exactly a
He could feel the ghosts of Steve's kisses on his lips. If this hadn't really happened, if Tony had gone insane and lost his mind… he wasn't sure sanity was something he wanted to chase.
"They’ll have to take the armor from you at the hospital." Steve kept his voice as level as he could. It was a Herculean effort, and he wasn’t that successful. "They’ll see who you are, and I’ll need to inform your loved ones where you are."
"Very funny," Steve said dryly, rising from Tony's lap. Tony stayed seated, intensely glad the Santa suit was very baggy.
Steve opened his mouth, probably to ask exactly what that meant – apparently Tony hadn't explained being able to
"So what are your plans this year? For the actual day, I mean." Tony stared at the current bauble in his hands, his distorted face a smear of color in the silvery surface. "Back to your usual soup kitchen?"
"They, uh, decided it wasn't a good idea for me to go this year," Steve said, slowly, because he was brave, he was always so damn
Steve grits his teeth. "I'm a gentleman, Wasp," Steve says, punching the bag again, trying to stick to the same rhythm in an attempt to stay in control of his emotions. "I don't kiss and tell."
Steve stared up at Iron Man wordlessly for a moment. His blood pressure should still be high for now from all that vasoconstriction, his body trying to squeeze shut some blood vessels, to clamp off the bleeding from within. He had to keep Iron Man calm. That was the best thing to do in this situation. Talking might be a good distraction. Talking also kind of hurt, but that didn’t matter; Steve would do anything for Iron Man, any time.
bit stabbed, and it made more sense for her to patch him up rather than go to Madame Temple and probably get ten points knocked off Gryffindor for the privilege.
Okoye's smile was brief, rueful. "Not doing so well. I had to file a formal complaint against him this morning." At T'Challa's obvious confusion, and Tony's matching invisible bafflement, Okoye explained, "Gorilla-Man. Kevin wanted to take the Christmas tree down; according to his statement, Rogers went feral, almost ripped his head off. If She-Hulk hadn't been there to restrain him—"
"I have to go," Tony says, backing up, his fingers automatically going to his mouth as he does. "Look out for your invitation, Hero."
Tony laughed, mostly because he had been so worried there was something wrong, and he didn't know how to feel, and laughing was a default response to most things these days, both happy events and abject terror. "Of
necking last week, so either she and Thor are no longer a thing, or they're a thing where kissing other people is okay, which doesn't render mistletoe as a
Steve grins. There's nothing like a good fight to get his brain back on course, and sparring with Iron Man always counts as a good fight.
For all that the Avengers have rooms at the mansion for when they need, it doesn't mean the large building is always occupied. Sometimes it's just Steve and Jarvis rattling around the place, if Tony's off on one of his international jet-setting business trips; Jarvis refuses to leave when that's the case, like he presumes Steve might lose his mind if he's left alone.
Tony's fingertips tighten, digging into Steve's back, his eyes widening a little before he laughs, gently. "You
"I'll make sure to put coal in their stockings," Tony said, just to make Happy laugh. "Right after I sock it to 'em, of course."
The inter-house war spilled out on Hogwarts' corridors. Textbooks were stuffed with charms designed to explode when the target opened them to a particular page. Howlers were sent during dinner, shrieking embarrassing gossip and secrets at a volume impossible to ignore. Someone turned Sam Wilson's hair blue for a week while he slept.
Tony shrugged. "All they needed was someone to boss them around. I'm good at that. It was getting so
sorry for not leaving a note," Steve said, stiffly. "And for—for yelling at you last night. That's not how I wanted to leave things."
how fucking messed up he was by Steve's words. "You, me, whatever the fuck you think it is we have going on here. It's done. I'm done."

Pancakes. Tony makes pancakes on the days he takes "off" from turning safe dials. Sisyphus pushing boulders; Steve's knuckles twisting numbers.
This part was the only interesting part of this chase—the five seconds when it felt possible that the villain was hiding on the next floor. Steve could feel the excitement of it, the exact moment when the chase would really begin in earnest. Perhaps he would see a shadow out of place, or the edge of a weapon. They’d already chased their quarry down five blocks and through three large office complexes. They were slippery, and inordinately fond of hiding. Steve had found their hiding spot twice so far, when Iron Man’s scanners had failed him (resulting in a few more technical mutters in response, of course.) Once it had been an errant shoelace; another time, the tip of their nose had been visible around a door.
to say Steve's name like it was special, and Steve hadn't known there were so many ways to hear his name where he would
Tony pulls a face of disbelief at that, because Steve thought chatting about this date was a perfectly fine situation to talk about during a supervillain fight, but he can't exactly bring that up right now.
It all went finally and very wrong during a Charms lesson. Steve was on edge, mostly because he'd spent all day avoiding the sneaky little attacks Tony had perpetually taken to launching at him in-between lessons, designed to knock him off course, or into abandoned classrooms; Steve had managed to fight each one off, and, even worse, Tony denied being the perpetrator, which was ridiculous – since Steve had yelled about the Sorting Hat trying to place Tony in Slytherin, Tony had started to be a loner again, like he had for the first few days of First Year; skulking around on the outskirts, everyone eyeballing him distrustfully. Tony didn't have any allies left; he had to be the one trying to send those annoying curses at him. Besides, everyone knew the Starks didn't just break curses, but they made them too. It had to be Tony.
Steve kind of relates to that. He doesn't feel like himself. He's not the kind to sneak out of a party, to kiss a stranger, to give in to that long-repressed desire and kiss another man. Maybe it is the mask. He does feel invincible in it. Like he can do anything. It's so weird that it takes a mask for Steve to feel the freest he has in years. He can do anything and no one would know it was him.
as they were wont to do—Tony was tired. Which was why as soon as they got to the Mansion, the only concession to comfort that Tony made was tugging off the beard and pocketing it.
Had Tony been too hasty, yelling at Steve like that? What had he been thinking? That he was worth more than a quick lay and a warm body to kiss? Maybe that, not Strange, was the real ridiculous thing here.
Fatherhood was rumored to turn your brain to mush a little bit. Tony was glad to see it worked for all
“Oh?” Steve raised both eyebrows and then, when he realized, his stomach flipped awkwardly, but that could be his own body’s vasoconstriction kicking in. He pictured his veins squeezing shut, desperately trying to divert blood flow, like there was a tiny person redirecting traffic inside him. Hm. Maybe this whole blood loss thing wasn’t working too well for him either. “Oh,” he repeated, eloquently. “I just. I’m not opposed to it.”
to go into the foster system if Tony insisted on cutting Iron Man's hours at all, because Steve would have to be Captain America to compensate for it, and he couldn't raise a child
Tony hurried up the path, knocked loudly on the front door, and found he was weirdly holding his breath. Steve disappearing without word had really rattled him.
″It doesn't have to mean anything.″ Steve's face felt hot. Well, at least that meant he had some spare blood and it wasn't all seeping out of his body. ″I mean it as a compliment. I won't—jump you, or anything, it's just—it is what it is. I'm not the kind of coward who retracts a statement just because it's awkward, or unwanted—″
he had secrets, and this was an excellent way to find out things, but when Tony looked down at himself, he was looking a little… more translucent than he had, in the med lab.
"I've been dreaming about this," Tony mutters, before kissing Steve again and yep, Steve's body is going to be found here, and Steve should be freaked out by how little he cares, as long as Tony keeps going. "You should put your hand in my hair, I like that," Tony adds, during another pause for air.
"I'm okay," Iron Man said. Wheezed, maybe, from the rush of white noise that came with those two words.
Happy laughed when Tony pulled out a bottle of milk and a tin of cookies, but the amusement didn't stop him from generously helping himself to both. Jarvis had been baking non-stop since the start of December. Jarvis enjoyed baking and counted himself as a pro; he was deeply delighted to have the excuse of hungry superheroes to indulge his hobby.
"Let me, I've had practice," Tony suppressed a smirk, taking over the task as Steve apologetically stepped aside. "Barton somehow figured out I was pretty good with wires. Do you know how many times he summoned me over to his apartment to untangle his entertainment system?"
where he couldn't touch anything. Tony wanted to touch Steve so badly right now. Not even for one of those ridiculously good kisses; just to hold him. To be the one to anchor
"What if it's like… reverse Narnia," Tony says, staring up at the rows of dials, shaking his head. Narnia had been written after Steve's turn as a human ice-cube, but Tony had paper-theater'd all seven books; Steve really enjoyed Tony's Puddleglum voice. "Like, the Pevensies step into Narnia as kids, grow up to become Kings and Queens there, then at the end they step back through the wardrobe and they're kids again—but we'll step out
Today was an additional headache of clean-up, too – four different pockets of creatures rearing their heads at once. T'Challa was hunting down Rock Trolls in Greece; Thor and Jen were battling Hel-Hounds in Australia; Robbie and Carol were chasing a rumor of a herd of Bilgesnipe in Tennessee; Steve and Tony had been left to deal with a group of Dark Elves causing havoc across downtown Manhattan.
When Tony blinked next, he was almost scared to open his eyes again. Steve would have to give up on him at some point. The world needed Captain America, he couldn't be constantly glued to Tony's unconscious side.
If Steve had been alone, he’d have snapped the metal pipe in two and taken his chances. With Iron Man so hurt, Steve couldn’t take that risk. To Steve’s chagrin, they really would have to rely on their team, and bank on the fact that the explosion hadn’t taken them out too.
Tony's heart was racing and he wanted to know if Steve was feeling it too. There was a light in Steve's eyes that said yeah, he felt it too.
"Ah, the old empirical method," Tony said, pulling the fake Santa beard back out of his pocket and fastening it back on his face, silently vowing to call up the company that was arranging the secret vacation package he'd planned to surprise Pepper and Happy with for Christmas and adding an extra round of spa treatments to it. Happy deserved it for not calling him out for changing the subject.
Their mouths part and Steve pants; the small bit of space allows the air in again and Steve realizes he's almost
They’d gotten close, and each time, their mark had let off a small explosive device and slipped away in the chaos.
Who was Iron Man. Steve hoped he got the chance for both of them to live long enough for him to get used to that fact. He was finding it hard to reconcile, for all that it also felt so logical. But now that Steve thought about it, there was no one else it could possibly
They would have been right, to keep Steve and Tony apart, and that just made the ache in Tony's chest worse. His heart was new, but it hurt like it still had shrapnel headed directly for it. Phantom Heart Syndrome, perhaps.
Steve interviews Tony like he's on the news, using a rolling pin as a microphone, and that's when they learn that some of their languages overlap (Russian and French) and some don't. Steve teaches Tony Spanish and German; Tony teaches him Japanese and Korean in return. Steve's mouth can't handle the Mandarin Chinese, so Tony uses that to whisper things into Steve's ear during their morning sex some mornings.
Everyone seemed to be having fun. Tony tried to just settle into the moment, but he did feel a little disconnected, like he was watching himself do this with his teammates. Everyone else seemed fully engaged with the activity.
the power that gives you. Maybe Iron Man's real strength is tied to the anonymity. He can be free of the expectations of the name
As far as Steve was concerned, the last time they'd talked (argued), Tony hadn't wanted much to do with him. Steve hadn't known how wrong he was.
"Sipping it looks safe enough," Happy surmised at Tony's first attempt. "But wouldn't he have to slug it down quick, to drink so much milk in the timeframe?"
Steve stares, realizing belatedly he's completely lost the Avengers. "Uh, training over, I guess," Steve says, too late by the way the others mill out of the room, excitedly chatting about the ball.
You were brave and you kissed me first when I couldn't even do that much. If you knew how many times I
"We've been here three years," Tony says, softly, deciphering Steve's puzzlement correctly. Oh. Steve missed that.
hurt. Tony had a shelf-edge digging into his back, but he couldn't feel it. He couldn't feel anything but Steve. Tony had kissed people in easy passion before, a crescendo culmination of desperate pining. He'd been in love, and opened his heart to it, over and over again. That was just how he was built; he never threw himself partially into any relationship, no matter how fragile the premise or how easily they could crash and burn. He was hurt repeatedly by this character flaw and never learned his lesson over it; sometimes he wondered whether it was part of some twisted self-harm cycle, but that was just when he let the small pessimistic voice inside of him speak.
Tony ended up holding Sarah while Steve packed up the house, rocking her while Steve picked up the essentials; she was loudly discontented at being away from Steve.
The party is just as lavish as Steve was expecting. He's learned to expect Disney-movie levels of glamor when it comes to Tony Stark, especially anything that involves his mother's name. Tony doesn't skimp when it comes to helping support the work of the Maria Stark Foundation. His dedication is awe-inspiring.
Steve nods awkwardly, then looks at Tony speculatively. "You know Iron Man really well," Steve says, "does
She was a real cutie too, as far as babies went. Steve, exhausted as he seemed, was a natural with her too. Tony had to admit he was having very wobbly feelings about Steve, seeing his strong arms cradling such a small baby.
"Rest," Steve said, the single word cracking into pieces. Tony had never heard a more beautiful sound.
big tumble," the man laughed. "Must have hit your head there. Must have been a mighty big spell to do that to you."
the one who said you wanted to kiss me.″ Tony arched an eyebrow, still somehow able to sass Steve from the jaws of death. ″Who's the insane one here?″
"I didn't break," Tony argued. "I wiggled your back-door lock a little. You should get a better one. But the entering, yeah, my bad." He lined up the latch, squinting at it carefully. "I'm nearly done, though. Then I'll be out of your hair. For good," he added, in a vicious, unhappy tone.
Steve's new baby – Sarah – wasn't genetically his own child. She was the grandchild of Dino Manelli, one of the Howling Commandos that Steve had served with during the war. Dino's own daughter had died in a car crash a few weeks ago, leaving Dino as the proxy carer. But then Dino had died, and for some reason – he'd chosen Steve to be Sarah's guardian, should something happen to him. The paperwork was solid; apparently naming Captain America as your child's guardian was acceptable, even though Steve and Dino weren't even remotely related.
Tony stared at him as surely as he could. This was probably it, the moment he would have to lay himself as bare as he possibly could. Steve was right—wanting things was difficult. The idea of being disappointed was heart-rending. The idea of a life without Steve was worse. It was funny, Tony thought, how three small words could be so difficult to say and feel so epic, all at the same time.
"Bet you've had basically zero hours of sleep since you picked up your bundle of joy, huh?" Tony nodded to himself. "That's fine. That's why you're not really supposed to parent alone if you have a choice."
wrong. Steve's lips still tingled from the kiss, so he didn't much care. ″But I refuse to accept the fact that
"Would it be so bad if they knew it was true?" Tony asked. His rebuilt heart was pounding loudly in his ears. It felt like he was holding it out on his palms, ready for Steve to take it.
"Give or take," Steve murmurs, as loudly as he dares risk with Tony resting against him. Tony's only pretending to be asleep, Steve thinks, but he knows Tony needs to keep up this pretense for now. Steve understands. Everything's overwhelming. Shutting it out is better than letting it in and losing himself again.
"Couple of months." Steve's words were scratchy, his throat tightening, like he hated having to push those words out too. "We were—just trying it out, y'know? And we were arguing, just before—"
"How about you?" Tony asked. He wasn't quite brave enough to look at Steve directly as he asked; he gathered a bundle of the mistletoe together instead, sniffing at it tentatively, tugging at the ribbon the bunch was tied with like it might unravel easily.
"God, this really better be a good deal to risk never seeing you again," Tony sighs, as he pulls away.
Problem seemed like the right word, Tony thought, because as he shuffled aside, awkwardly negotiating the small space, Steve put a hand on Tony's hip to help him turn in the right direction to make it work more easily. Tony opened his mouth to mutter an automatic protest at being man-handled, but the words died in his throat, a lump of intention that got stuck, because Steve was close. So
Steve stared dubiously at the small strip of material carefully pinched between his fingers. He couldn’t hold himself up anymore and had to let himself drop back to the ground, sliding him back down the pole an agonizingly painful four inches. He knew he hadn’t hidden his wince of pain from Tony, but Tony was politely not mentioning it.
Steve makes a noise under his breath. "I've never done this sort of thing before. I was too busy with the war, and then I was busy getting myself deep-frozen."
that lie. I was supposed to be invincible. I told myself that you all finding out I was a flesh-and-bone human might destroy that mythos. That it might shatter your faith in me on the battlefield. Especially when you found out how scared I am, all the time.″ This time Tony
Steve rubbed his head, coughing painfully; when he opened his eyes, it was bright. Too bright. He opened his mouth to gasp and had to cough some more when sand got in his mouth.
It shouldn't feel so good, for something that was just kissing. Steve seemed content to hold him there and maul him with his mouth, and it felt so
It was common for people reaching the second stage of shock to panic. To get a sense of impending doom. Was that what was going through Iron Man’s mind, as his body adjusted to the first wave of shock? Was delirium setting in? Iron Man was
Tony laughed at that, even though it clearly caused him physical pain to do so. ″I dare say lying to Captain America probably comes with a cost, too, and I've done
Steve would never forget Tony's expression as he stared at Steve, in shock and dismay and open pain.
Robbie, Tony realized slowly. It was Robbie. And from his words, it was clear he wasn't alone. Tony opened his eyes and found Steve wordlessly staring back at him. There was a hint of panic on Steve's face that Tony identified with; he didn't want the Avengers to see them both like this, seconds out of a passionate clinch.
"Ha," Tony breathed, grateful to be able to latch onto a conversation topic. He felt strung apart at the edges, desperate for something to hold onto. "Well, I am Santa," he said. "Normally people just sit on my lap and
"You can stay in Maine if you really want," Tony sighed dramatically, "but as the Head Arch Supervillain of the New York division of the People's Adversary Network and International Council, PANIC for short, I will probably have to be distracted thoroughly in order to minimize my maniacal schemes for world domination."
Steve could still see a hint of his mother’s kindness in his eyes when he looked at his own reflection; he could see a little of the way his father’s hair had swept over his forehead. It was enough to remind him of who was really inhabiting this fast and strong body. He assumed, one day, he would settle into his strength and it would feel like slipping on a pair of perfectly worn shoes, but it hadn’t happened yet.
Steve preferred using the Quinjet for clean-up, but the remnants of Malekith's forces didn't cause chaos on schedule. Tony had his own issues with the Circulator, but that was more the fact his professional pride had been a little bit dented by the advanced tech still lingering inside the Celestial corpse that they called home. The Circulator could transport them to and from anywhere, but T'Challa thought it best that the technology was kept under wraps for now, so for this mission they were headed to a quiet alley where they wouldn't be seen disappearing.
Steve smiles at him. "I'd rather you fucked me." He considers it for a moment. "Maybe after a nap." He squints. "I don't think I could stand up right now."
He couldn't believe what was happening here. What Steve had already implied. Steve wasn't going to come back. Steve was never going to be an Avenger again. Steve had chosen this small, unremarkable town to raise a child that wasn't really his,
"….Tony?" Steve’s question was uttered in a ghost of his usual voice, but Tony had obviously heard him loudly enough.
Steve blinked furiously, trying to get his vision to clear up. He wasn't in Hogwarts anymore, that was for sure. He was standing in… some sort of a desert? He could see a lot of sand, stretching away into the distance, and some mountains. And in front of him was an older man, his mustache grey, long, and twitching above a friendly smile.
A few minutes later, Tony takes his coffee off to his lab, and Steve watches him go. He'll tell Tony at the ball who he is. See what happens. Yeah. It's a good plan.
Tony shrugged. He was only half-kidding at the world domination part, but he had baby-proofed a lot of Steve's life in the last few weeks, maybe he
"Steve," Tony breathed, because there weren't really any words that he could string in a row to reassure him.
"You blush so prettily," Iron Man murmurs. His smirk widens and his gaze flickers briefly down Steve's body and back up again. "I wonder how far down that blush goes."
"I had to," Steve said nonsensically, tearing his mouth away briefly to press warm, wet, desperate kisses along Tony's jaw, "sometimes you just—you're
"Hmm," Iron Man hums low in his throat, before putting one of his hands on top of the one Steve has perched at his waist, and, his eyes fixed on Steve's, he slowly lowers Steve's hand.
covered his tracks, and maybe it was for a good reason, so that was why Tony drove, instead of just taking his armor out for a spin. Lots of people tried to get footage of that; it wouldn't do for someone to piece together pictures of him on social media into a flight plan. Instead, he picked his least flashy car, and used one of his own inventions to obscure him from security cameras as he went.
"I'm just—gonna take this and go," Happy mumbled, picking up another cookie and getting to his feet, a smile fixing to his face as he backed up toward the door.
"Oh, no, no, the secret identity—that makes sense, especially with your public profile. We all agreed to it anyhow, it would be remiss of me to be upset about something I agreed about. It's just—" Steve finally managed to look Tony in the eye. "It's just—you kissed me back."
He knew he had to. This was important. This felt important. This moment felt the same way as it had the first time Tony put his armor on to save people. Fundamental. Everything was about to change again and Tony couldn't proceed on damaged foundations.
Tony turned on his heel as soon as the large blank walls of the Circulator room came into sight, ready to yell at Steve, to demand to know what he was
he was a mystery, although that makes Steve feel weird, because it turns out he never missed out on all that much not knowing Iron Man's real name until these past few weeks. It's probably because…is it really a surprise? A masked man who is good and strong and kind, removes their mask to reveal that the person behind it is good and strong and kind? What would Tony think, if Steve took his mask off? Would he think the same? Or would he be horribly disappointed? Maybe it's only the fantasy Tony liked.
Steve turns back to the dials, focusing on them; Tony hums something under his breath, one of Bach's unaccompanied cello suites, because Tony might play rock records in his workshop for his documentaries when the cameras are on, but he's a classical nerd when no one's paying attention.
him, and the next time Steve panics, when the thoughts won't leave him alone, he can still feel echoes of how good Tony makes him feel. It keeps the darkness at bay for a while.
There was something oppressive about the homogeneous gray space. It wasn’t just the uniformity and the low ceilings; everything screamed carefully curated artifice. Even the air was stiff, false somehow. When Steve voiced that thought, Iron Man cheerfully rambled on about how mechanical ventilation provided a fresh airflow, which in normal conditions, would disperse all the car exhaust fumes.
Even the kisses. If he was thinking about time travel, Steve should probably choose a time before he'd ever kissed Tony Stark to go back to. But the thought of never remembering those amazing moments felt like a stab to the gut. Kissing Tony had been such a bad idea, but oh, it felt like coming home, all at the same time.
He was utterly okay with the fact that Steve wanted him gone. This was what Steve wanted and Tony always wanted Steve to have what he wanted. It was a whole pile of wanting. The only thing that fought against that was the
might not," Iron Man said, quietly, and Steve’s heart broke all over again. If he could physically yank the serum out of himself and give his precious healing factor to Iron Man, he would.
"It's irritating that you always know it's me," Steve declared. His distinctive footsteps quietened as he drew up to watch what Tony was doing. "Do I even want to ask what you're doing?"
Tony had just broken up with him anyway, even if a relationship implied shower-perving consent in the first place (he was pretty sure it didn't), so he was already slowing down before he realized Steve wasn't even in the showers.
″Show me a twenty-foot creature, shove me in a high-tech tin can, and I'll hurl myself at it,″ Tony said. ″One could argue that's not exactly
Tony lurched up quickly, because he knew that voice, and knew it well. "Steve," he called out, instantly cursing that his voice sounded a little strangled. "Hi."
Had this been a land of myth and magic, there might have been a prophecy to foretell the following events. Something lyrical and pretty, involving three beautiful masquerade balls, and true love's kiss, and the unmasking of a love that had been in front of our champion's eyes all along.
Steve's opponent disappeared instantly and Tony tried not to think about how close he'd come to a similar fate. Steve's face was a complex storm – like a wheel of emotions, his brain cycling him through them one by one – before it settled onto something ambiguous.
on that impulse, and he's never felt brave enough to take that step. Except… right now… he almost feels like he might be able to.
They managed to keep damage to a minimum, a fact Strange didn't agree with when he dropped by to pick up the unconscious Dark Elves; he disappeared with them in a flourish of showy magic, promising to dropkick them through one of his portals back to where they came from.
presence, Steve can feel something thrumming underneath his skin, brimming with potential and promise.
Steve thinks about the way the Iron Man armor went soft. How Jan squeezed the arm that's pressed up against him, and how delighted she was to feel it. His throat feels a little dry. That isn't something he can suggest. He wonders how Iron Man would respond, if Steve
the idea that Steve saw it as a compromise that he'd give up being Iron Man, or reduce his role with
" Tony said, drawing out the two syllables, "is obsessed with those cinnamon pastries from that bakery on twenty-fourth, and they do gift certificates."
Tony stared at Steve, suddenly hateful. "You… couldn't tell me you'd been bequeathed an entire child, because you knew that I was in
Steve frowns. Tony Stark's been nothing but nice to them all since agreeing to fund and house the Avengers. Especially now they're relying solely on his money. He hates it when Iron Man slyly makes digs at his own employer. Shouldn't Iron Man be nicer to the person he's vowed to protect?
How long had he fantasized about kissing Steve for? Years now. It had been a virus of a thought, a daydream for so long that Tony classed it as just one of those idle fantasies to drag out only when he was single and horny. He only knew it was more than that when he saw Steve bleeding out on the courthouse steps at the denouement of the first Superhero Civil War (he tried his best not to remember there had been a second one; he tried his best not to think about the ramifications of that, because there were questions about his soul Tony wasn't ready to hear the answers for); it was only then that he knew he'd lost the war. They all had.
"I'm sorry," she said, lifting up her wand. "We can't have you in the way. His plans – oh, the Dark Lord's plans – they're going to be so
I do the same things, over and over again, expecting different results – that's the definition of idiocy, isn't it? You deserve – you deserve
She handed him a business card before turning on her heel and scurrying away with her colleagues. Tony carefully slid the card into his armor, into the panel he built in for occasions like this one. Sometimes he threw them away, if they weren't watching, but he appreciated that she left so he didn't have to do an awkward shuffle to excuse himself from the situation.
Steve's automatic Iron-Man-related smile fades as he realizes that everyone has stopped training in favor of staring at Iron Man. What's going on? Why aren't the others continuing with their exercises? Steve's stomach tightens. Is something
"But then you wouldn't have had that warm moment of surprise on seeing the tree." Tony shrugged. "I don't mind the task. It's nice to contribute something to the season before work bogs me down. This week in December tends to be the only time my schedule isn't squeezing the life out of me."
"Cap got lucky too," Jan says loudly, and Steve resists the urge to wallop his head face first into the punching bag, because
Iron Man to him, desperate to keep him there, an anchor to this moment. Steve's dizzy again, dizzier than he was inside. Iron Man's mouth is hot and addictive and Steve wants to kiss him forever. Steve's not like this, he's
the overbearing control-freak you were worried I'd be. I mean, look at me now. Couldn't even successfully storm off."
Steve's shoulders sagged, the only visible proof he'd listened to her. Carol stepped closer to him, leaning against him, letting him know he had support.
Steve stared. Maybe he was more injured than he thought. There was no way what Tony was saying made any sense. This whole thing was some sort of delirious nightmare. Maybe Steve was hallucinating. Oh, that made sense. Iron Man being Tony Stark did feel like some sort of fever dream because Steve liked Iron Man
and Steve waggles his eyebrows, and that's how an hour later, they're lining up food items on the table, and Steve's pulled down the light covering to make an impromptu golf club. They take down one of the curtains and Tony immediately wears it as a cape, admitting he's always been a
"There might be one thing I want." Steve's voice was strained, like he was aiming to talk normally too and failing. Tony watched him attentively. This moment was a bit weird, and he felt strung out, but if he could walk away from it with a clue for the Secret Santa, maybe that could be a good thing? "I just don't know how to ask for it."
″It's just a built-in suit mechanism,″ Tony said. ″It just means that if I suffer from a tension pneumothorax, the armor basically... stabs me and works to drain the fluid; lets me breathe again. It's totally
. Besides, she’s adopted a handful of teenagers, and doesn't have time for anything fun, so we're just… friends. We're friends. It's good."
"Frost giants spotted in Iceland, my friends," Thor boomed. "I was hoping you might want to come smash some heads with me, Stark?" He seemed to notice Steve there a moment too late; Thor hadn't quite adapted completely to the one-eye lifestyle yet. It was never a good idea to mention his lack of depth perception to him, though; Thor could out-sulk Steve. "And you, of course, Cap."
"Nice. That's a nice amount. Better than the $5 one going around your HR department Pepper roped me into."
They weren’t getting away, not this time. Not with Clint and Simon in the staircase, and Wanda and Vision coming from the top, and Steve and Iron Man sweeping up from the ground. They
The New York Times once described parking structures as "the grim afterthought of American design" and Steve couldn’t say he disagreed. He understood the concept of utility and need, but surely a little aesthetic thought wasn’t too much to ask? But no, instead, the Avengers were currently being forced to sweep every single level of the ugliest enclosed parking garage Steve had encountered yet in this decade.
An identical floor awaited them, and Steve could already picture it: a low ominous ceiling; vertical pillars uniformly spread out; horizontal bars around parts of the dull gray walls; painted parking spots on the concrete floor; red doors that led to the staircase that Clint and Simon were scouring; an emergency phone that in better times connected straight to security on the first floor. Wanda had insisted the company evacuate and lock up the garage and had sent the two security guards on duty home as soon as they saw the villain escape into it. The guards were obviously paid too little to even hesitate at the sight of an Avenger encouraging them to flee.
Tony was being stupid if he thought it wasn't enough. That was it; it was just Tony's brain misfiring. Probably some sort of semi-buried instinct for self-sabotage: Tony
of gray—Steve immediately regretted thinking the word tomb because it felt defeatist, but was it wrong? There was gray debris, collapsed walls of concrete around them as far as the eye could see. He
"Oh, don't worry about it," Iron Man says, when Steve starts to apologize for not having one for him. "I've already had my invitation."
" he says, but he doesn't haul back to try and punch Steve, which is probably a good thing, seeing as Tony would probably break his fist on Steve's face if he tried.
Steve takes advantage of the cold air to stand and gather his thoughts. The temperature also helps dampen his body's enthusiasm. Even without Iron Man's—
