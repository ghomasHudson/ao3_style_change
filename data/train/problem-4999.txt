Walking into King’s Cross, Dean grabs his younger brother’s hand. The minute he sees the Hogwarts Express, he freezes up and felt his hand go clammy. The nine-year old smiled knowingly and patted his brother’s arm, and said, “I’ll be fine, Dean. Go and learn something.” Dean relaxed automatically, and hugged his younger brother, Bobby, and Ellen goodbye. He takes a seat by the window in a car where there is only one other boy, and waves goodbye to his family as he begins his new adventure in a new place.
(Dean remembers all the times he stayed up at night, thinking of what it would be like to become one with Cas, to kiss him, to lay claim to him, to hear what he sounds like when he’s coming apart. Those times have not stopped in many years, and Dean knows that next time he sees Cas, he has to do something about it.)

“Well that was easy.” And then the floppy haired man turns on his heels and walks to Charlie.
this took forever to get out because i am indeed not manic and write sparingly when not in an increasingly extreme mood.
And boy, she is
It’s a big group hug at King’s Cross, and by the time Dean has reached home, Cas is already calling him, informing him of how his bees are doing in the beehive his mother built while he was at Hogwarts as a welcome home gift.
. Once Dean had gotten over his homesickness or nervousness or whatever he was going through on the train, Castiel realizes that this boy is going to be his best friend. The two of them have much in common, even though Dean grew up in a non-wizard environment, and Castiel grew up with magic apparent in every facet in his household.
Because overall, it’s just amazing to have his best friend back. And he doesn’t want anything to change that ever again.
They whisper secrets to each other, Dean’s mainly about how sometimes he thinks that he could have done something more for his parents in their house fire, and Castiel holds him as he cries silently because this is something that he has never gotten over.
Overall, it wasn’t a bad night. But he still misses Dean.)
Dean, in his gone state, pays no heed to what his best friend is saying. “But you’re so pretttttttty.” He slings his arm around Cas. “I think you’re so great.” He leans his head on his shoulder, and green eyes gaze up into blue.
His best friend, who is currently writing furiously on parchment, his tongue sticking out between his teeth. It’s early December and normally it’d be Charlie studying like crazy, but apparently Cas had forgotten about an essay that was due that night.
these two are pining, hard. sam and anna come to hogwarts, there's an awkward moment, and lots of flirting and, like i said, pining.
“Hiya! Let’s do some plan-” Sam nudges her. “Let’s do some reading! Reading is what we’re doing!”
you.” he grumbles, but he can feel a smile growing on his face as he gets closer to his best friend. The two of them hug, and it definitely is not the length of a normal hug, and Bobby clears his throat and Sammy laughs. Dean steps away from Cas (but still closer than anyone else he’s ever let stand near him for long periods of time, of course), and the band of them head into Diagon Alley. It’s Gabe’s last year at Hogwarts, so he’s already gone ahead and gotten his things earlier, but, like Sammy, this year is also Anna’s first, so she tags along this time, shopping for robes and books.
, Dean’s brain supplies him.)
It’s several weeks later, around mid April right before Easter, when Dean is confronted by his brother the same way Cas had been. Which annoys him, because it isn’t like Dean hasn’t thought about what had happened, but he’s been
Dean’s too busy staring into Cas’
Castiel feels himself beam at that, and Dean responds in kind, which, if Castiel is honest, makes his heart flutter just a
He has no idea what two of his friends and sister are doing that week, but there sure is a lot of giggling, scribbling, and furtive glances his way those seven days. Cas busies himself with reading up on Irish honeybees, and continues eating all the ice cream in the house and moping up until it’s time to go to Hogwarts.
And although they have to part ways for the summer, Dean going on an exchange program to a Canadian wizardship program for Charms that he won on a scholarship, and Cas going up to Scotland to study under a Herbology and Animus professor to learn more about plants and animals, the six of them promise to stay in touch, as usual. Charlie and Alice are spending half the summer together in Paris, and Sammy is going to go home and study (in the summer! Dean exclaims, and Cas nudges him with a laugh), but they are all close friends who will be starting their next school term before they know it.
So Dean picks up the phone, dials Cas’ number… and promptly hangs up when he hears Anna’s voice.
It’s Cas’ birthday, and as a present Dean gets him a set of wizarding chess, and Cas lights up in response. He right away challenges Dean to a game, and while Cas wins, Dean couldn’t care less. He knows he’s watching him with what Sammy has affectionately nicknamed “heart eyes”, and he couldn’t care less. They spend the rest of the day in classes, but at night they play another game, and Cas doesn’t let him win.
(Denial is real.)
(It’s fucking noticeable.)
Dean did not realize that someone could wedge their way into his heart as deeply as Sammy has, until Cas came along. He knows he’s only twelve, but something about the quirks that his best friend has is so adorable that his heart clenches and he can’t help but smile. The little things that he does, such as the way Cas tilts his head when he doesn’t understand something that is basic knowledge to someone who has been living in human society for so long, is endearing. The way Cas seems to see into his soul, however, is slightly unnerving, because it causes the butterflies that Dean tries to desperately to keep down to come right back up.
“So, young padawan,” the seventeen year old pauses for dramatic effect, and Dean feels his chest constrict in anxiety. However, Gabe just says, “I have something for you and Cassie over here.”
Cas has plans to go to Hogsmeade that weekend they get back to get Dean something for his upcoming birthday, and he has roped Charlie into distracting Dean for a half hour in exchange for some chocolate cauldrons.
The two of them have endless topics to discuss when they arrive back on the Hogwarts Express in January, even though they had been keeping in contact nearly every day. Charlie is back with them in the same car, eating chocolate covered frogs and talking about the books she finished during break.
i'm so proud of myself, and these two idiots, for getting their shit together and living happily.
(Cas doesn’t look him in the eye again after that incident. In fact, things get even more awkward, and it’s like they’re back to square fucking one.)
Or rather, that’s what he tells himself.
It takes him nearly an hour to properly notice that there is now someone in the car with him, and does a double take. A boy, obviously a first-year like him judging from his shaking legs, has settled by the window and is gripping an amulet of sorts in his hands, and has his eyes closed.
“I… wanted to thank you.”
do much except wreak havoc on Cas’ internal systems, but that’s beside the point. A few times they invite Sam along with them, who’s been settling in fine at Hogwarts, and Cas notices Sam looking curiously between the two of them, but he doesn’t know if Dean sees it too. Dean’s previously complained about his younger brother being too knowing for his own good. Cas wonders if this is one of those times.
They finally make it across town to King’s Cross, and Castiel feels his excitement mounting as the famous Hogwarts Express looms in front of him. He and his brothers hug Anna and their mother before leaving for the train, and Castiel picks the nearest unoccupied car to sit and munch on the sandwich his mother had prepared for him. He has no idea where the rest of his brothers are but is sure that within the time it takes to get to Hogwarts, something will go awry. Until then, he settles back and enjoys the landscape pass by in front of him.
it's their second year at hogwarts, and dean starts to realize some things. the same things that cas is pushing back, however.
Ketch and he are fooling around in one of the closets when, lo and behold, Cas walks in, claiming to be looking for a different broom closet. The blue eyed boy avoids Dean’s eyes, and Dean feels ashamed before he catches sight of his brother darting away, laughing with Charlie.
There’s much excitement that night, with partying going on in Gryffindor (Cas and Gabe are there, as well as Charlie and countless others from other houses), and Dean gets a little tipsy on one glass of firewhiskey.
And in each of those classes, Castiel notices how Dean’s eyes look from the glances he manages, and marvels at how smart the green-eyed boy is. Charlie is right there beside them, taking notes meticulously and answering every question the teachers have, but Castiel notices Dean. Dean also takes notes, and listens diligently, but his attentiveness differs between classes. Whereas Charlie obviously loves
this is when things get real, folks. it's full on pining and love-struck shit from here on out. and their friends being really tired of their dumb, if not oblivious, selves.
Right at that moment, Sam wanders into the room, and Dean tries to jolt away but Cas keeps a firm grip on his hand.
He let out a louder moan than he'd intended as the sound of Cas's hips slapping against his grew louder. He worried for a moment about Sam, and then there was another thunderclap. And then Cas thrusted forward and the worry was gone.
It wasn't Cas's first time being human. So, the first time it'd happened, he knew what was going on. About two weeks after Cas had come back, Dean had just finished a shower and came into the kitchen. He had a towel wrapped loosely around his waist and his hair was poking up at different angles. He'd come in to grab something or another. Cas, to be honest, hadn't been paying attention as to
And Dean laughed. He lifted Cas's chin up ever so gently. "Are you uncomfortable?"
," he begged. Usually in these scenarios it was Dean begging. Frankly, Cas didn't care who was doing the pleading. But, in this moment, he was glad it was him
“Yeah,” Sam laughed. “I’ll go get him. We’ll have a family dinner.”
"You can come," Dean said, pulling Cas into another kiss.
Michael eyes flash a pure blue.
"What?"
Jack simply stared at the food. Dean did the same. He wasn’t hungry. He knew he should eat, but the thought of it made him nauseous. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
"I don't know yet, but -- Sam we've fought too hard for too long to give up now. To lose . . .
Michael was in no better a state of mind than his nephew.
Something about Lucifer's words brought attention to Jack's gut. It had been a week or so since he'd felt like this. Felt . . . powerful.
In 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
“And one thing you taste?”
. Michael lunged forward, the archangel blade sinking deep into Lucifer's stomach. The red light in his eyes flickered out as Michael pulled the sword back. The God Book fell from his hands and splayed, open, on the ground. Lucifer's head fell back and his scream echoed around the bunker. The light, as he died, seeped from his eyes and mouth. Sam and Dean looked away.
Cas's hips jutted up, striking the same spot. Dean was in shambles. Every breath was some noise between a moan and a scream and every thrust was pure ecstasy. His hand fell between he and Cas's as he jerked himself off.
Jack, after a moment’s hesitation, sat down next to Dean.
"Sam —" Cas panted, jerking his head towards the door. "He'll —
“Did he ever find someone like that?” Jack continued, looking intently at Dean.
"Dean, I'm here." The voice was Castiel's. Plain and clear. A bit gruff, but real nonetheless. Dean's heart plummeted as Cas grunted in pain. "I'm hurt. Can you let me in?"
." He lowered the foot rest of the recliner and stood up. "That why you got up?" He asked, a grin growing on his face.
Cas's heart dropped. "Of course," he stuttered, his legs feeling weak as shame colored his cheeks. "
He could still smell him. A scent he'd never been able to place. Perhaps it was a divine scent. Perhaps it was something specific to angels. But, even now, it lingered thick in the air around him. It was strong enough that, when he closed his eyes, Dean could almost feel the bed dip under the weight of another. He could almost feel the sheer warmth the angel had always seemed to radiate. But, when he opened his eyes, he was alone in a room full of scattered ties and discarded shoes.
Dean slowly pushed Cas back until he hit the wall. He was going slow — Cas knew that. His movement weren't hesitant, but they were planned. Every time Dean moved his hand from Cas's hair to his back or from his shoulder to his cheek there was a certainty. Dean knew what he was doing. He was savoring the moment and he wasn't pushing Cas too far too fast.
Cas stared. "So . . . this is okay?"
“Hey,” Dean said in the way of a greeting.
— Dean, I'm gunna come," Cas moaned, his fist tightening in Dean's hair. With some last ounce of self control, Cas pulled Dean away. He didn't want to finish yet. Not quite yet.
He didn't want that, though. He just wanted to be a normal kid. He wanted to learn to tie his shoes. He wanted Sam to help get him into a good school. He wanted Dean to teach him how to bake. And maybe Cas could teach him all about real life. After all, Cas had had to figure it out. He wanted to feel like he had when Ms. Butters had been around.
But that had never been in the cards for him. Not ever.
"Hey, Sammy."
Dean opened his arms. “Come’re, kid,” He whispered.
Nope. No, he noticed that anyways.
They were sat in one of the recliners. Dean siting in between Cas's legs, smiling in content while Cas played with his hair. There was nothing sexual in anything they were doing. And yet, Cas was having trouble keeping himself from imaging his hands creeping from Dean's hair and to his chest. And then to his stomach, then hips, and then creeping under his waistband.
That had happened a few other times. Not exactly, of course. But Dean would say or do something that dissolved Cas's ability to process anything and he would escape to his room in a panic.
I just wanted to let you all know that your comments literally make my day. So thank you.
"We're going to get them back," Dean finally breathed. He found it harder than usual to hold down the uncertainty in his voice.
He still felt laggy.
He restrained himself, however, and, when Dean told him to move, he did. Slowly, at first. Pulling out almost all the way and then pushing back in. The pain, after a few minutes of this, started to seep away. It was becoming easier and easier for Dean to focus on how fast his heart was beating. How his breathing was speeding up with Cas's pace.
would kiss him more. However, every time they kissed, an explosion of excitement shot through Cas.
And, thus, a plan evolved.
Sam moved so that he could stand square in front of Lucifer. "
And Dean laughed. He laughed a cold, sharp, bitter laugh. It hurt to know just how right Jack was. “Yeah, he would.”
Dean smiled and took the stuffed bear. “Thanks, kid.”
The silence didn't last long before Dean's phone rang. The strangeness of a ringing phone in an empty world didn't strike Dean as odd, immediately. It was such a familiar sound. However, by the time he'd gotten it from his pocket and checked the Caller ID, his heart was pounding.
He told himself.
Lucifer laughed once again. "
it in this moment.
"Wow, you are really getting rusty at this, Buddy." He was across the room now, drawing the attention of his son. "Bye." In the same fashion as Michael had done, Lucifer's hand stretched out and the same ball of energy sped towards Michael. The archangel, unlike his brother, did not move in time.
Dean grabbed another beer from the table. And then another. He carried them out with him, but he didn’t go to his room. Instead, he made his way to the library.
The book flew, still open, into Lucifer's hands. He grinned wickedly.
"So where does this leave us? We need that book open and we're out of options," Sam muttered, turning to look at Dean who was sat on the other side of the door frame.
How do I fix it?!’ But all that game out was another gurgled sob.
"He loved me," Dean repeated, looking up to meet Sam's eyes. Tears were threatening to fall now. He could feel the burn in his throat and the heat rise to his face. The muscles in his cheeks twitched painfully and he gave into a sob bubbling from his throat. "He loved me and it got him
The same thing had happened on the fourth month. And now they were in their fifth month. Cas and Dean had had a few moments that could've led to something, of course. Dean would pull Cas close and kiss him on the hood of the Impala while they were stargazing. Cas's leg would travel just a bit too far up Dean's leg as they cuddled while watching a movie. And yet those moments had never gone farther than that.
They all got out of the car. Maybe —if you ignored the tension in their shoulders and the exhaustion in their eyes — maybe they were just a normal family out for a picnic or a little fishing trip.
Sam and Dean were standing now. Dean had a small cut on his head that was bleeding into his hair. They watched Jack.
Michael had told Chuck a lie that Sam, Dean, and Jack had found a spell to kill him. In reality, they hadn't found jack squat in the books. Michael told Chuck that the spell had to be performed in a specific place at a specific hour.
Cas gently slipped a finger in and listened as Dean let out the softest of groans. Cas pumped and curled his fingers, ensuring that Dean was well stretched, before adding a second finger. Dean's hands balled into fists against the wall.
Dean cocked his head at Cas. "Uncomfortable is a word you could use, I suppose."
A part of him wanted to leave Dean covered in marks. Undertones to the freckles scattered around his body. He wanted Sam to know what Cas had done to his brother in the morning. And, after all, Dean wasn't complaining about Cas's bites or the marks they left.
Dean's hurt and confusion quickly changed to fury.
Whether or not Michael and Adam's affection was romantic or platonic, Dean didn't know. He didn't care. Because, one way or another, they were soulmates in a very literal sense. They made each other feel happy. They made each other feel safe. At the end of the day, that was all that mattered.
“It helps me sometimes,” Jack muttered, rather awkwardly.
Michael glared. Now it was his turn. He lunged forward, only for Lucifer to disappear and reappear a few feet away.
They prayed. And prayed. And prayed and prayed and prayed. And then they prayed that their prayers went through.
“Dean?” Jack was standing at the end of the row, looking more concerned than Dean had seen him look since before he’d lost his soul. “I heard noi — oh my god, you’re bleeding.” Jack rushed forward and prodded at Dean’s face. Why Dean’s face?
“Love has saved Sam and I more times than I can count.”
Dean looked away.
Dean, though he wouldn't say it aloud, liked the plan because it meant Cas would be there. He would be there to fight by their side. He would be there with Dean. And maybe, after the fight, they could go on a drive and talk. Because, Heaven knew they needed to.
He was returned to an exceedingly primitive mindset. He had only one thought: get to Cas.
Dean's eyes widened. "No. Cas, no. Baby, that's not what I meant." Dean's face went pink. He hadn't intended to use a nickname. It had just, kind of . . . slipped out. "I meant it in a good way."
“I’m sorry,” Jack muttered, backing away from Dean. He wiped his eyes with the back of his hands. If Dean’s shoulder wasn’t wet and he hadn’t seen the tears beforehand, he wouldn’t have known he was even crying. His cheeks were a bit flushed, but, other than that, he looked perfectly normal. There was no indication to the trauma they’d all endured. “I didn’t mean to bother you, I just wanted to talk.”
Hold 1, 2, 3.
Then the praying had started. They prayed to every fallen angel in hopes that they'd at least listen. With luck, the direct prayers would wake them enough to break through the Empty's haze. If enough were awake, then the Empty couldn't put them all back to sleep at once.
Dean, upon hearing his name, turned around and peered at Cas over the back of the chair. "Hey," he said, smiling softly. His seemed to catch sight of Cas's growing erection. "
“Dean, look, you’re okay. Alright. Hey, look at me.” Sam grabbed Dean’s shoulders. “What are five things you can see?”
“God, he’s like a mini you,” Dean scoffed, taking a swig of his beer.
He was disgraceful. Pitiful. Weak.
He pushed open the door.
now."
Dean stood up.
!" Dean gasped, his eyes falling shut as his head rolled back. And Cas struck it again. Dean abandoned Cas's hair and reached over his shoulder, clutching to his back. His nails, as short as they were, were likely to leave marks. Well . . . if Cas was leaving marks, he'd do the same.
Dean’s inner musings are interrupted when Gabe suddenly claps him on the back to get his attention. Cas slips his hand out from under Dean’s, and he wipes his clammy hands on his robes. He doesn’t look at Cas.
It’s right before Christmas break, and Dean, Charlie, and Castiel, or Cas as Dean has started calling him, are hugging goodbye on Platform 9 and ¾. It’s a heartfelt “see you later”, seeing as Charlie lives in London, as does Castiel, but Dean is on his five hour journey back to Blackpool for a month before returning for the second part of the year at Hogwarts.
Cas gasps. “Is this the Marauder’s Map?”
attractive. He had a small crush on a girl in his primary school, but that is it.
Dean is made captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and to follow tradition, Cas slips him a note in Charms that congratulates him, and Dean’s grateful for the small contact that he has with his best friend. He misses him, but Dean’s too proud and stubborn to do anything about the rift between them.
The bright light stops, and standing in front of him is Cas, in all his glory. Even his worn trench coat makes something clench in Dean’s stomach, and he’s honestly tired of fighting it. Ever since Cas told him he loved him before he died, Dean could not stop thinking about it. He knows he’s not exactly the most emotionally mature human, but even he can figure out what the fondness he feels is, the need to be around Cas and make sure he’s okay all the time, the urge to hug him and yes, kiss him.
Both families head to a pub for dinner, and then back to Cas’ flat for the night. The next day, there are four kids on the Hogwarts Express, and Bobby, Ellen, and Naomi smile as they wave goodbye to their kids until Christmastime.
reading, and thinks girls are cute. She also reminds both of them that they need to change into robes before arriving at Hogwarts, which Castiel is glad for because he nearly forgot.
“I mean… the last eight months have been absolute hell. I don’t care what happened between us anymore, I just want my best friend back.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean looks at him, just
He brushes it off, but resolves to ask Sam what that was about, later. He never actually does, because that same day in December there’s
“Yes, I think I can.” Jack responds, and his smile slowly grows wider as he catches onto what Dean can’t bring himself to say. “I can’t promise anything, but I can try.”
, his mind prompts him). He drives, hearing the air whistle as he whips the Impala around the corners just because he can.
“Dean! Dean! Hello? Jerk, look over there!” the abnormally tall ashy haired boy screams in Dean’s ear, and he flinches.
It’s in their second month at Hogwarts that he tells Dean that he feels that he is closer to him than anyone else other than his younger sister, and is given a hug by the other boy.
Dean can hear the laughter in his brother’s voice as he calls out, “Don’t mind me, just grabbing a book,” before walking back out of the room.
Even if there is no metaphorical shoe, he doesn’t want to lose what he and Dean share, so Cas is determined to keep his feelings to himself and smother them down even more than in previous years. They’re best friends, and that’s it.
Dean’s stunned. He definitely wasn’t expecting that to come out of his little brother’s mouth.
“No, I mean… I feel the same.”
hasn’t let go of Cas’ hand. He doesn’t know why. He doesn’t know how to. He altogether just doesn’t know anything, because all he can focus on is that one point of contact between them. He’s pretty sure he’s missed half the conversation, but he sips his butterbeer and Cas squeezes his hand.
Gabriel and Cas’ dynamic is an interesting one, which is where Gabriel teases him but yet helps his younger brother with anything he needs. Michael and Balthazar are off doing their own thing, Dean and Cas never cross paths with them, but at least once a day Gabriel pops in and says hi. Where he appears from, Dean still has no idea.
Castiel is in Hufflepuff, and he figured judging from what his brothers had told him about the four houses. Dean is in Gryffindor, which interests him (amongst other things about the boy), and Charlie is in Ravenclaw. Castiel doesn’t let it bother him too much that none of his new friends are in his house, because Gabriel is in Hufflepuff, and he knows he can spend time with them in common areas around the castle.
Cas is grinning even more sunnily when Dean looks back at him finally. He’s ready to acclimate to even more staring when Cas asks,
He then slaps Cas on the back. “Make me proud, Cassie. Make me proud.”
So, in all, all is well. Sort of.
Cas spends his days burying himself in his studies, focusing on Herbology and his O.W.Ls, as well as helping out with Hagrid down at his hut with his creatures and spending time with his friends. Who are also Dean’s friends. It seems that the two of them have started almost sharing custody of their four friends, seeing as Dean has certain days and Cas has others.
They study in the Room of Requirements, eat the food that the elves have given Cas because he’s really gotten to know them well in the kitchen in his spare time away from classes and Dean, and spend a lot of time playing wizarding chess and studying.
day they met). Dean can sense the way his body is aching to see Cas in a way that is not exactly foreign to him after all these years of pining silently after the dude, but not knowing when he’s going to see him next is terrifying. Now that he’s in Heaven, he can admit it. Having Cas be a constant the last decade or so has been at least calmed his mind a little, because he had not only his brother, but also Cas (
“Where have you been, man?” Dean asks him, because he desperately wants to know why he hasn’t seen him since that fateful night.
Just as that thought comes to a close, Dean drives into an opening. There’s a bridge, with a nice outlook onto a river with luscious green trees that whisper in the slight wind. This is definitely his Heaven, but there’s a couple things missing.
Cas, in his usual Cas manner, responds with, “I know an officiate down the road from Mary. We could ask her.”
First years are required to take seven courses, of which four Dean shares with Castiel. They sit next to each other in Potions and try not to blow things up, help each other in flying lessons, discuss the stars in Astronomy, and talk about their latest teacher in Defense Against the Dark Arts. It is known that the teacher for that class changes almost yearly, because most professors cannot stand staying for more than a full school year.
i'm hoping to finish this fic by dec 23, seeing as the holidays are in full gear by then. so it's three chapters in four days. welp. wish me luck.
o.w.l prep is upon them, and dean and cas still aren't talking. sam, charlie, and the rest are so done with their shit.
i ended up putting together the first two chapters of this fic! so, year one is together now.
enjoy x
Cas feels like shit, though.
He is packed two days before they need to arrive at Platform 9 and ¾, and has been anxiously bouncing up and down in his eleven-year-old way since then, getting more and more jittery the closer it came to departure.
And it just gets better.
So, shit.)
Goddamn it, his little brother knows him way too well.
“So… uh,” he begins, and he feels his ears turning red. “About what you said before you… saved me.”
“Yes.” Cas replies, patiently.
(It was probably because they had spent the previous night outside talking about constellations and catching up on each other’s lives because the time right before Christmas is always hectic at Hogwarts.)
(That is, until Dean wakes up the next morning, a slight headache pounding above his eyes, and remembers what he did.)
there's a lot of tension, the boys are busy, and something major happens.
“Sam? To what do I owe this pleasure?” He asks, and Sam smiles stiffly.
“Hey, so who officiates weddings here? Do ya think Bobby’ll do yours?” Sam asks once they pile into Baby, and Dean groans, berating himself for not expecting the ribbing to start right away.
“You want to what?”
. He sits down between the two boys, and the moment is ruined.
They spend the majority of their days going to class and eating in the Great Hall, and Castiel makes it a point to be outside of the Gryffindor Tower’s entrance waiting for Dean every morning. He’s diligent in all he does, and Dean admires him for that. Sometimes they mix it up and go watch the Quidditch games, unsure who to root for if it isn’t their houses playing. Charlie joins them most days, and the three of them laugh and study the days away together.
He meets a sixth year Hufflepuff named Ketch who’s practicing on the field at midnight, same as him, and they get to talking, and before Dean knows it, they’re tumbling into bed together while giggling over firewhiskey. They have classes the next day, but getting off has never been so much fun and Dean doesn’t even regret the fucking hangover that’s killing him the next day.
Dean grins, aware that his entire face is probably turning red, but he couldn’t give a damn. “Yeah, I do, man.”
their pining comes to a head, and they get through their sixth year.
(Damn little brothers.)
The three of them walk with the rest of the first years to the Great Hall, and wait. The doors open, and then, their new life begins.
is fluttering and his palms are sweating, and he is ever so thankful that Charlie Bradbury comes into the car because she is talking their ears off a mile a minute, and he can focus on her and not on the (very) pretty boy across from him.
, and Cas feels like he’s looking into his soul. “Were you jealous?”
As he navigates down the winding road, Dean lets his mind wander a little. He knows that he’s going to see Sam eventually, that it might take a little time, but the missing piece has always been Cas. Back at the house, when he told Bobby that there’s one person missing, it was about Sam, but also wasn’t. It was about the person that’s had his back since he first stabbed him all those years ago. Cas has been by his side, ready to fight and defend since the day they met (well maybe not the
And he thinks Dean really wanted to kiss him, too.
Cas seems to accept it, and Dean tells himself that the red in Cas’ cheeks are from the cold. He keeps telling himself that, just like everything else.
He ends up going back to Hogwarts, of course, because Bobby would kick his ass if he didn’t and Sammy would lose his shit. Speaking of annoying little brothers, Dean’s annoying little brother is definitely planning something. He’s definitely up to something, if not has been for a while, because Dean barely saw him all of winter break and that’s saying something.
This is more or less how the rest of their time before the Christmas feast and break starts. Sammy has no idea yet, but third year is actually much harder than any of them thought it would be. Having nine or ten classes per week is much harder than Dean or Cas would have thought it would be. Charlie’s the only one who’s thriving, because she has somehow managed to take on eleven courses, a successful relationship with Alice, as well as make time for her best friends and participating in other activities on campus. How, nobody will ever know, but she does. Dean does notice that she disappears from time to time and has two classes often put at the same time, but he doesn’t try to wonder too much, because god knows what Charlie’s up to.
Sam, Charlie, Alice, and Anna watch in amusement as the two of them fight head to head, taking the game extremely seriously with bouts of flirty banter (at least from Dean it is), and Dean can see something turning in Sam’s mind.
Maybe he’s a coward, okay? But he isn’t the one who ran away and didn’t talk to him for the last two months! Then again... he could have tried to talk to Cas at least. But he didn't, and now he has to deal with the repercussions of his actions.
Cas has no idea what to do. He has laid in bed since two in the morning, wracking his brain on how to act when he sees Dean the next morning. He isn’t sure if Dean’s going to remember, because he doesn’t think that he had
“Me too. Sammy’s always been my only friend other than Jo, and now I have you and Charlie.”
Dean wasn’t going to sit in the same car as Cas on the train, he really wasn’t. However, Sammy kept pushing him to sit in
“First of all, Gabriel, you are 17 years old. Second of all, what do you mean?” Cas tried to play innocent, but he knew the elder one could see right through him.
eyes to realize that he and Cas are now holding hands.
They make no mention of the fact they’re
“I love your accent! It’s so cool! I want to hear all about it another time. See you soon, Dean!” she says, before slipping away to see her brother and parents.
Later, it’s the shushing as they rush into Dean’s bedroom, locking the door and smiling giddily at each other as if they’re both teenagers again, because goddamn it they saved the fucking world once again, and they came out victorious, and they’re in fucking love and nobody’s going to take that from them anymore.)
He and Sam spend the entirety of Easter break at odds, combined with surreptitious looks from Sam and eye-rolling from Dean. Dean talks to Cas a few times on the phone, but not as much as usual because there had been a talk about how they didn’t need to spend so much time talking to each other because they would be best friends no matter what.
The feelings are still there, though. Sometimes Dean is kept up at night thinking about what it’d be like to hold Cas’ hand as a proper boyfriend, rather than sometimes as an excuse. He pushes those down real quick, though, because it isn’t worth it.
(Kissing Castiel is lips on lips, mouths opening, tongues twining together as they try to figure out how to fit together like puzzle pieces. It’s open mouthed kisses down necks, it’s quiet gasps, it’s the frantic breathing into each others’ mouths as they run out of breath but don’t want to separate. It’s everything, and it’s perfect. It’s knocking over beer bottles as they jostle the table, it’s laughter while kissing, it’s teeth clacking because they’re too busy smiling.
They walk around the grounds together, talking about a novel by whatever author they have in common, or discussing their favorite constellation. Castiel offers bits and pieces of his childhood, and Dean does too, eventually.
(And overall, the Yule Ball goes off without a problem. There’s lots of eating, lots of dancing, and lots of pining stares from a certain green-eyed and blue-eyed pair of boys. There’s a party afterwards where a lot of people get drunk, and Cas avoids that area like the plague with the memories of what happened the last time he got drunk around Dean.
They change into robes once someone announces they are almost at Hogwarts, and there are furtive glances between the two boys, and slight reddening cheeks, and Dean resolves to push this feeling down. He thinks there is a friend in Castiel, even though the two have barely exchanged words, and he doesn’t want to ruin it. He thinks about what his father used to say -
“There’s no need to be nervous, Dean! Once we get in, we’ll process into the Great Hall and get sorted, and then Professor Hanscum will give the opening speech, and then we have the feast! Lots of food! And everyone will mingle!”
this has been a lil shit to write.
They come back in January after some much needed time away from school. If Cas is going to be honest, some much needed time away from Dean, as well. He’d been getting overwhelmed by how much he likes Dean, and he needed some time away.
so there's inaccuracies but honestly i cranked this out in two hours so i am really proud of myself. it's long but it's good to me, and i hope you enjoy!
AHHHH IT'S THE END
“I’m Dean Winchester.” the green-eyed boy says, and he lets out a tentative smile. Charlie moves over next to Dean and gives him a side hug.
dean and castiel arrive at hogwarts. it's go-time, baby.
It worries him, yeah, but they are still as close as before, and things are good. Better, even. They still touch frequently and hug a lot, and maintain steady eye contact until one of them breaks it (he heard one of the ghosts call it “eye-fuckery” but that’s breaching territory Dean isn’t ready to get to, yet), and they are each others’ confidants. They’re best friends, and practically soulmates through and through.
Dean Winchester is
Cas tells him about how he has always felt like an outcast and how before he came to Hogwarts, he had been thinking about running away to go somewhere, because he does not feel at home in the rich posh area of London he lives in. They hold each other and watch the stars, and that’s how they spend the rest of the spring term after Easter.
But sometimes, being around his best friend and crush is just
As per tradition, Sammy and Anna are separated from the group and put on the boats to be brought over to Hogwarts, while the rest of them pile into the thestral carriages, and then they’re off to start their third year at Hogwarts.
“I’m Castiel Milton.”
“Hey Cas,” he says, and he’s being pulled into an embrace before he can even get another word out.
“A little.” Cas admits readily, because he too is ready to move on from this constant back and forth that has been going on between the two of them the last half a year.
“Beer.”
tell him that he was loved?!"
(See the end of the chapter for
And, even now, Castiel's words rang in his ears. "
Dean sighed and turned away. That reflection wasn’t making him feel any better.
Dean smiled and pulled his head back, keeping his hips firmly on Cas's. He was moving in this torturously slow speed, possibly not even moving at all. Maybe Cas was imagining it. But he needed something. "What is it, baby?"
"Touch me," Cas gasped. "
—————•—————
Lucifer held a hand out, forcing them back and to the ground. "Nope."
At a glance, it all stood out. Even as an angel the sight would've been . . . provoking. However, as an angel, he would've been less overwhelmed. Instead of seeing the way Dean's hip bones peeked over the top of the towel, he would've seen the water molecules beading his hair. Instead of seeing the waves of muscle across his chest, he would've seen the ink particles that made up his anti-possession tattoo. Instead of noticing how his hips wagged just a bit more than usual, he would've noticed how the towel moved aside to reveal just a bit more leg than Dean had likely intended.
. You're not our 'pal'."
If they could get Chuck to exert some of his energy, Jack would absorb it. And, even then, it was likely Jack would lose. They needed an army to defeat Chuck. An army that had open gateways between their death and life. They needed the dead angels. And they needed thousands of gateways to the Empty to be open constantly.
Sam patted Dean’s shoulder. “Great. Just — just breathe, man. You’re alright.”
Sam looked over, the oddity of a ringing phone finally hitting him as well.
Dean hummed, finally leaning down to kiss Cas. And Cas kissed back. His body hummed with excitement. He'd kissed Dean before. It wasn't something they did often, which was okay. Perhaps now Cas would kiss him more. Perhaps now
They’re led next to each other, unmoving and flat on their backs. Dean’s right leg is about to fall off the bed and Cas’ shoulder looks like it’s digging into the nightstand. Maybe this bed wasn’t made to fit two fully grown men too afraid to touch.
You came back again.”
“Hey, Eileen. What’s the sign for ‘husband’?”
He’s got company.
“Not unhealthy enough!” Eileen voice calls out, a little further away.
“You remember the first time you woke me up here?” He says after a long pause. “You threatened to throw me back into Hell. Real nice of you.”
But he doesn’t.
“Hmm.” One of Cas’ hands rubs languid strokes up and down his back. “I should hope so.”
“Choking.” Dean says and swallows hard against his healing throat.
good. Not nearly enough to repay his debts. Not anywhere near what Cas deserves. He deserves a real home, a huge garden, a fucking
“No.” Cas says firmly. “This is...this is good. Thank you.” He sounds so earnestly grateful Dean almost cringes in shame. “I spend quite a lot of time alone. It’s good to have company.”
“Oh, yeah? When?” Dean’s lips brush over warm skin.
Instead, he just feels warm.
Dean watches him stare up at the moon, the pearly light making him look as otherworldly as he is. Dean is reminded there are wings somewhere behind Cas. Broken, yes, but still there. It’s weirdly exciting that Cas isn’t human. A strange thrill shoots through him when he really thinks about it. He feels like one of those people who inadvertently tame some dangerous beast and have their photos taken with the thing sat on their couch with them. It’s that precious feeling that you’ve been chosen, that something that would normally kill you with a snap of jaws or a click of its fingers saw you and thought you were special. So it decided that it wanted
“I was afraid that feeling would follow me. That I would still feel that fear no matter how far I ran.”
He doesn’t want to.
“Are you gonna be ok by yourself? I mean, you said before that it was lonely being in the Empty. Thought maybe you’d want company?”
“Oh.” Cas half turns away from the TV. “That seems unnecessarily harsh.”
“Wanted you to have something to come back to, you know? I know this was always kinda your room but there was nothing in here and I thought...after what you said before about the Empty...thought you’d want something good to come back to. Bright and full of life...or whatever, I dunno. Just thought you might like it.”
Dean takes the last glug of coffee to think. There’s an obvious question that’s been lingering between them for the last ten minutes.
“You can sleep, Dean.” Cas says, almost chastising. “I’ll watch over you.”
“Right.” Coffee.
“You could rest with me.” Cas says, just like that. Like it’s not a big deal at all. Like guy friends just clamber into bed with each other all the time and die for each other and confess their love for each other...
Being in the dark with Cas is easy. But being with him in the light is better.
“What a surprise.” Cas sighs, world-weary and affectionately irritated. Dean wants to make him sound like that every day.
“I could but I believe that will be unnecessary.” He stands and looms over the couch. He looks intimidating from down here – tall as a skyscraper and dark as a void. Dean clutches at the blanket for something tangible to hold on to. “Your body still hasn’t recovered from the physical and emotional trauma of the last week. And when you sleep you have nightmares thus reliving the pain. You must rest completely to correct this and regain your full strength.”
“I have no need for - ”
He opens his door and chucks the empty bottle down again, letting it roll off to some dark corner of his room. He scoops up the next one and cracks open the top, taking a deep swig. It hits him hard; neat alcohol on his turbulent stomach makes him gag but he perseveres. He’s exhausted but he can’t close his eyes.
“You should sleep.” Cas says, softly. “I can watch over you.”
He snorts. “Got the gist, at least.”
he’d think.
“Oh, it’s not, not really. But I knew my place and I knew what I required to do. And I was known. Understood.”
“You are not sleeping.”
“Sam’s good now.” Dean says quickly, half to reassure himself. “You screwed him over, not gonna lie. But at least you fixed it.”
Cas joins him suddenly, with that eerie angelic stealth. Dean only just manages to stop himself from jumping like a kid. Cas sits on his left, watching him intently.
Sobbing.
“Yes.” Cas smiles, gummy and a little crooked where he’s resting his head. “It is.”
He steps back into the open doorway, unwilling to take his eyes away from Cas because he’s
Cas’s expressions softens and he edges a little closer. Suddenly – wildly – Dean thinks if Cas kissed him now he’d be fine with it.
Dean rolls onto his back, heart hammering as he stares at the ceiling. Cas’ eyes are still on him – he knows the feel of that gaze like a dangerous coastline knows the relentless glare of a lighthouse.
He slumps down next to the toilet and takes in breaths he doesn’t really want. The cool title presses against his burning back and he closes eyes. Which is a horrific mistake.
Even as Benny regales them with some batshit story, even as he eats his handful of berries, even as he wanders the perimeter of their little camp.
So he’s aiming for blackout.
Dean pushes open the door with a sweaty palm.
“Not ever.” His hands are moving now, big and slow in soothing motions against Dean’s back. He can’t remember the last time he was held like this.
Dean raises his eyebrows against his makeshift pillow. “What, you don’t like Benny?”
“I assume you had plenty of time to watch it then.”
?!” Dean hisses, only keeping his voice down for Benny’s sake. “You mean you’ve been in spitting distance before and you didn’t say anything?! You could have...” He thinks about the sleepless nights, the desperation to find him alive. “I was afraid you were
Cas’ hand is just caressing his hip and his tongue is getting hotter and more demanding in Dean’s very willing mouth when there’s a knock at the door.
“An intruder? Judging by our current position, I assume I am the being most visible from the door.”
“Yes.” Dean feels his arms tighten around him for a moment. “And I believe my body would shield you from the vast majority of attacks.” He sighs and his breath tickles Dean’s hair. “Of course, if someone were to gain access to the Bunker, it’s likely they would be a supremely powerful being. That would reduce our chance of survival by quite a lot. However, if you really insist on being armed, I am confident that in the few seconds I could shield you, you could at least reach for a makeshift weapon. Whatever good it would do.”
“Do we
So they get into bed together.
like a momentous romantic confession made by a guy madly in love with his best friend before he sacrificed himself to save said best friend but maybe...maybe it wasn’t really like that.
” He fidgets on the bed, fighting the urge to pull a blanket over himself.
He laughs and rubs a hand over his face. “Yeah, this isn’t great. Maybe if we...uh - ”
Once they’ve eaten in relative silence, Cas perches on the edge of one of the beds staring wide-eyed and blank faced at the television. Unfortunately, it’s not Dr. Sexy. Just some grim drama about murders and family betrayals. Like they don’t have enough of that to deal with already.
He potters about, feeling eyes on him wherever he goes. He doesn’t let his hand shake.
His arms are wrapped around him and not just because they haven’t got anywhere else to go. Because he wants them to go there. Because he
“Last night.”
His knee jerk reaction is to tell the angel that’s weird. In any other situation it
But he might still laugh a bit. That’s a big brother’s right.
For what seems like the first time in an hour, Cas blinks. “Is that possible?”
The silence stretches and Dean contemplates hitting his head on the floor. If he does it hard enough, there’s a good chance it’ll knock him out for a while, maybe a few days if he’s lucky.
It’s the first real colour he’s seen in months.
“What about if we do this?”
“Yes.” Cas whispers back. He’s only whispering because Dean is. Dean feels completely normal about that and not giddy at all.
Cas chuckles, mouth thick with sleep. Dean pulls a blanket over himself and wraps an arm around one of the pillows.
“But if you’d rather - ”
“Best brother in law ever.” Eileen says and Sam almost falls off his seat. She just shrugs cheekily. “
he thinks. When he was a kid. He knows he must look pathetic – six foot plus guy that’s been to hell and back being held like a baby. He should move, should pull away, wipe his eyes and tell Cas it’s time he went back to his own room.
Cas stands, flicking off the TV and sitting against the pillows of his own bed. The quiet makes Dean realise that he’s alone with Cas in a motel room. He isn’t sure why it sets his teeth on edge – it shouldn’t be any different from sharing with Sam. So why does he feel a bit too hot under his shirt?
there?’”
Cas seems surprised when he faces Dean again. “Oh. Well, yes, of course. I would enjoy you staying for a while. But please don’t feel like you have to.”
“I suspect she did not imagine that to come true in Purgatory while you are travelling with an angel and vampire, but the sentiment is lovely nonetheless.”
He stands on shaking legs, picks up the empty bottle and goes back to his room where he’s stashed another. Thankfully, he doesn’t pass Sam on the way. He can’t deal with the pity, he can’t deal with the logic and he can’t deal with his stupid, childish
Dean smiles as Cas’ breathing gets even and heavy. He watches for a moment and squeezes the pillow tight against his chest before turning out the light.
Dean feels a pang of something in his chest so intense he almost squirms. “Alright, maybe
“You’re like...
“Dean? You hear me?”
“I’ll shoot you one day.” He says over his shoulder. “That’ll show you.”
Dean’s eyes flit over to him again. He isn’t used to it yet. They only found him a few hours ago.
He drives them to a motel because that’s the least he can do.
“Oh?” He sounds a bit more awake now – that familiar dry, teasing tone creeping in.
“You didn’t let us down, man.”
. I should have...if I hadn’t been so damn caught up with other stuff. If I had just been there more - ”
Dean’s heart clenches and he feels the urge to move, unable to sit still in his grief. His knee knocks against Castiel’s solid thigh but the angel stays perfectly still.
Cas leans back further, turning slightly to rest his head on the pillow. His eyes look almost velvet in the soft light. Dean finds himself turning a little too, cheek brushing the cotton pillowcase.
“Dean?” Cas sounds a little slower now. “Tell me something?”
Dean has never felt more pathetic.
His body jerks and his foot knocks the empty whiskey bottle with a jarring clatter.
“Give you some privacy.”
He starts awake, half-reaching for the gun tucked under his pillow before he can pull himself back. He glares and throws the blanket off his lap, immediately regretting it when the cool night air hits his legs.
Cas’ eyes are still very blue.
“Uhhh...” He flounders. He hasn’t done this since he was a kid, making up stories for Sammy to fall asleep to in the back of the Impala. “Ok. Once, this guy woke up. Let’s call him...Dan. He woke up and realised he was underground, being suffocated. So after he panicked a bit, he dug his way out and almost goddamn blinded himself ‘cos it was a sunny day, right? He walks to this old gas station and keeps thinking ‘how am I alive?’ ‘cos he’s pretty sure he was dead.”
Yeah, Dean’s the worst friend in the world.
“Hmm.” A murmur, breathed into Cas’ neck, is all Dean can manage.
When he speaks again, his tone is unnervingly soft. “Your friends.”
“It’s incredible.”
Cas steps inside the room and Dean can finally look up from his feet. His eyes go straight to Cas’ broad back, casually dressed in one of Sam’s sweaters. The sleeves are too long but Cas says he likes it. He’s wearing a pair of joggers that Dean kept aside for him and a pair of socks with a hole in the toe.
. That he wanted –
“He’s doing ok. I was...” Dean trails off, his good mood momentarily dipping into guilt. “I was kind of a dick to him at first - ”
“I liked having eyesight.” Cas mutters, burying himself into the covers.
“I love it.”
“And?”
“Yeah.” Dean clears his throat. “Well, Sam helped too. Turns out he’s kinda nerdy about plants too. But I bought ‘em all and watered ‘em and...Jack got you that stuffed bee, by the way.”
Even though he can’t see him properly, he’s sure Castiel is staring straight at him even as he ponders his answer. It’s another reminder of how alien he is. He doesn’t have that need to look away, to hide his face as his mind races to find the right way to say the right thing. Dean envies him that.
Dean whispers his name, a private prayer of desperation. There’s still some dumb part of him that thinks he might just appear again, slightly dishevelled and annoyed at Dean for not looking after himself.
With all his might, he rolls onto his side before he’s suffocated completely. His head spins as he turns, his stomach churns and his eyes roll back. When he finally passes out, he doesn’t see anything at all.
“Good.” Cas smiles at him and he has to grip the railing again.
Dean almost whines, his head lifting to follow the touch. He half opens his eyes again and sees a smile, unhurried and adoring. Cas leans down a little and kisses him, stubble rough and lips soft. Dean’s fingers curl against skin and his legs squeeze a muscled thigh beneath the blankets.
In the soft lamplight, Cas’ profile looks striking as he thinks. “Yes and no. I miss the simplicity of being with them.”
“Right. Ok. Great. That’s...good. I’ll just...” He gestures over his shoulder to the door. Being in here with Cas is too intense, like staring at the sun or holding your hand over an open flame. “You probably want to rest.”
Two fingertips brush his forehead and he sleeps.
. Mom’s gone. Ain’t no sense in pretending otherwise. Gone just like –
He doesn’t.
He tries to lift his head but it’s too heavy. A wave of panic rushes over him as he starts to feel paralyzed – trapped in his own body and smothered with grief.
Well, that isn’t quite true. Cas always leaves but he always comes back too.
When Dean asks Cas where he can drop him, the ex-angel avoids his eyes and says something about being ‘between places’.
Dean’s face heats unpleasantly. He knows it’s not like that but he can’t quite bring himself to argue about it. Instead he stares into the fire as Benny wanders off to rest. He feels horribly cracked open. He’s gotten used to his hardened shell – Purgatory took all the resilience he had and coated him in it. But the first sight of Cas had split him apart and now his usual racing thoughts have come rushing back with the force of a ten tonne truck. He almost wishes he could go back to how he was yesterday, pure focus and drive.
In the dark, Dean has to rely on Castiel’s voice to judge his expression. “Yes.” The word sounds solemn, like he’s disappointed that Dean remembers it. “I did say that.”
But Cas still looks unsure. “That’s not...” He sighs. “Yes, I suppose you are right.” He gives Dean one of those rare, small smiles as he looks down at him. “Sleep.”
“I like having a window.”
“Hmm.”
“- but we’ve gotten better.” He knocks Cas’ shoulder with his. “I’ve gotten better.”
Cas slides in as though this is his regular night time routine, looking totally at ease in his new ‘jungle dreams’ bedding and borrowed blanket. Dean’s hands shake as he lifts up the covers and slides in too. He waits for it to be weird, waits for discomfort and his father’s face swimming in front of eyes.
“Dean?” He says again, sounding slightly alarmed. “Are you alright?”
“Yeah, yeah, I know.” Dean turns to lean his back against the counter and almost jumps again when he sees that Castiel has silently followed him to the kitchen. He can count the number of worn tiles between his bare feet and Castiel’s shoes. He has to swallow before he speaks. “Didn’t ask if you needed it. You
“You...you son of a
They stay that way for a while – bodies warm and entwined, gently greeting each other as the new day dawns. The rising sun has drenched the room in rich yellow light, soft and muffled through the curtains.
Castiel is hesitating. This is new behaviour for him and it’s dangerously human.
“Alright, alright!” Dean glares but he’s itching to get started. “Goddamn demanding baby. Eileen you could do so much better. Sadly, I’m already taken - ”
Dean does as he’s told but frowns too. He tells himself it’s a good compromise. “You gonna stare at me until I fall asleep or something?”
weird. But here, he really does need someone looking out for him.
Dean can’t stop looking.
Castiel is an
He’s still
“Nothin’, nothin’.” He waves a hand, but the smirk hasn’t left his face. “Just startin’ to feel like a third wheel, is all.”
Cas’ deep voice rumbles through his body, rocking him out of his spiralling worry so quickly Dean briefly wonders if he used some of his remaining slither of grace to do it.
“’Angels are watching over you.’” He says, thinking of soft blonde hair and a warm smile. He swallows around the lump in his throat. “That’s what my mom used to tell me every night when she put me to bed. Guess that’s true tonight, huh?”
“It’s wonderful.”
Dean is sick.
He clears his throat. “Yeah. Just...weird to see you, I guess.”
“Wait – ”
“For now.” Dean winks and Sam splutters.
“Apologise for what?”
“Then he looks in the mirror and sees he’s got this mark on his shoulder. A handprint. So he’s like, ‘who the hell left
Dean watches him, aching with joy.
It’s too much focus on him, on
Cas hesitates before saying, “Yes. I suppose I should. Thank you again for this. I really love it.”
“Not your fault.” He mumbles and means it. It never occurred to him to blame Castiel. He’s been too busy blaming himself to consider anyone else’s actions.
“You think I don’t get you?” Dean asks before he can stop himself.
“Mornin’!” He calls cheerily, rummaging in the fridge for eggs and milk. He emerges triumphant, plopping them onto the counter with a grin. “If the lady wants pancakes, the lady gets pancakes.”
He’s just one slightly shitty human lost in Purgatory.
It can’t be too far away – he can’t remember when he last ate. He’s aching all over, boiling hot and he’s...
“Oh ok, smartass – thanks for clearing that up!” Dean huffs good-naturedly and has to grip the railing until his knuckles turn white. He’s got so much happiness in him his body doesn’t know what to do with it. He feels energy thrumming through him and he has the sudden urge to start sprinting and laughing.
As they slowly detangle, he catches a glimpse of silver as Cas stretches. Dean’s hand feels heavy and warm, like someone’s been holding it for hours. Dean yawns and dangles one leg out of bed, then another. He’s easing himself into the day, taking it a bit at a time.
Now Dean just feels happy. And tired. He’s pretty tired too.
“Lie back down.”
Like,
to travel with the vampire?” Cas grumbles beside him, sounding wonderfully like himself.
“Yes.” Cas’ fingers twitch on the railing and Dean thinks that if he moved his left pinkie, he could feel his skin. Cas’ hand drops before he can really contemplate doing it. “But I did escape.”
The silence drags and his fingers itch to switch the TV back on.
Better than this stupid room, better than this miserable Bunker. Better than Dean.
The memories come back easy and bright, playing like a dream behind Dean’s heavy eyelids. The stillness of their bedroom is punctuated by the sound of quiet voices in the living room. He grins at that, relishing waking up with the love of his life and his family just in the next room. Happy. Safe.
(They’re going to be okay. After this last battle, they can add a couple more scars to the collection, both physical and metaphorical, but they’re ultimately going to be okay. They don’t know what the future is going to hold, but at least they have each other now, once and for all.)
Charlie and Sam start spending a lot of time together, and Dean doesn’t know whether to be happy or concerned. Both of them mean well, but they’re the meddling types, and he knows that Cas and him are not being exactly subtle. However, all he can do is try to focus on his classes and ignore what’s happening around him, and spend as much time as possible with his best friend.
Even if Cas returns those feelings, which he most likely doesn’t as much seeing as how he never brought the near kiss up after the party, they’re better off as best friends.
He hands them a folded piece of paper, and they open it curiously. In it is a map with names of different professors and people. Wait - it’s a map of Hogwarts!
He’s extremely drunk, and singing some off-tune rendition of
All of a sudden, Jack starts glowing, right there in the middle of the street.
They don’t touch. Dean thought that things would go back to normal, as in no personal space would be acceptable, but Cas seems determined to keep a distance between the two of them that has never been there before. Dean respects it, but is undoubtedly confused because really, shouldn’t he be the one who’s keeping the distance because he was the one run out on? But oh well. He’s taking what he’s being given, and not questioning it.
It’s their third time sneaking out of the castle when Gabriel catches them, and he nearly shits himself laughing (his words, not Dean’s) when he sees their scared faces. He assures them that as long as they don’t get caught, they can do pretty much whatever, but Dean and Castiel stop doing that for a while because they’re afraid of getting kicked out and getting sent a Howler by their families (well, mainly Castiel’s).
obvious.”
one more chapter to go :) it's happiness from here on out.
