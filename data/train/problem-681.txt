Sherlock felt his face redden and quickly threw another log into the crackling fire so he could turn his rosy face away.
John smirked a nasty, intimidating smirk and puffed out his chest, “I’ve just returned from Captaining my 4th tour in Afghanistan, I have seen things your tiny, ignorant mind can only imagine. I’ve shot people, I’ve put people back together in the middle of a desert with nothing but gauze and Jesus as bullets have flown past my eyes. I’ve been to war, I don’t need to take advice from you, thanks.”
“I'm fine, maybe it's the painkillers, but I would very much like you to embrace me.” Carefully, John wrapped his arms around Sherlock, so gently he may as well be made of glass. “I was so scared, Sherlock,” John whispered pulling him just a little bit tighter, “it was like being back at the hospital where you were lifeless on the pavement, your brains on the floor, bleeding, dead at my feet.” Before John could stop himself there were tears running down his face, his body quivering as he held his dearest friend tightly, finally allowing his grief that he'd hidden and battled with for so long, to surface.
“Morning,” as if on cue John Watson sauntered out, he wore Sherlock’s second best dressing gown loosely tied so a large portion of his gorgeous chest was bared, at least he had pants on, although that was the only saving grace. The doctor passed the crowd, calmly strutting to the kitchen, giving Sherlock the filthiest wink he could muster before idly putting the kettle on, leaving Donovan and Lestrade gaping and Sherlock hoping the ground would swallow him… or that the gun was in reaching distance.
“I'll always take care of you,” perhaps against his better judgment John went over to the settee and sat next to Sherlock, “I know things have been,” John hesitated not wanting to admit to the devastating distance that was forcing itself between them, “a little difficult lately butI mean it, I will always take care of you so talk to me, please. You nearly died and I can't let that happen again. I can't just walk away knowing you might bloody overdose again. Talk to me Sherlock, I'm here, I care about you, let me help you. Tell me, please tell me why, I need to understand, I need to help.”
“I'm a man with a past too. I have demons, I’ve done things I'm not proud of. When you met me I was a traumatised army captain with a psychosomatic limp on the brink of suicide. But I’m not defined by my past and neither are you. Sherlock in just a week you've changed my life, given me hope again, make me laugh, made me feel alive, been a friend to me. You're a good man, you have a past, that doesn't change how I feel.”
For a while Sherlock simply sat, letting the silence consume him, he needed to do something, anything. It was pushing midnight he really should go to bed, his abused body was crying for rest after the cocaine related stunt he'd just pulled but his mind was racing. Trembling hands betrayed him once again, he needed something to get through this, his heart was hammering and he wondered if he might hyperventilate right there and then, how undignified. Really Sherlock needed a large glass of water and a binge of sleep, but in reality he was going to put some sort of harmful substance in his body and work on a bizarre experiment until he literally collapsed. John had left some scotch there, that might do the trick. Sometimes after a case they would pour themselves a generous dose before engaging in some less than angelic activities or even just drifting off into a comfortable sleep after putting the world to right. Sherlock lived for those moments, yes the sex was amazing of course, it was with John Watson after all, but it was the intimacy, the warmth the camaraderie that Sherlock lived for and what he missed the most. Sherlock shook his head quickly, willing those thoughts to leave before they consumed him. The scotch wasn't going to cut it, he couldn't bear drinking it without John anyway, there was a pack of cigarettes under the second floor board nearest the fire, quite why he hid them he wasn't sure, no one was around to check, he could smoke himself into a coma in the lounge if he so chose and no one would be none the wiser until poor Mrs Hudson discovered his corpse when she brought him a cuppa.
John only felt a little bit guilty when he sent the text to Mary that the case had run late so he was going to crash at Baker Street. Mary was a smart lady, a very smart lady and if Sherlock had been a woman there was no way in hell John would be getting away with the affair. As much as John convinced himself it wasn't, an affair is exactly what was happening, John was having an affair with Sherlock Holmes, it was ridiculous, it was wrong, it was unfair but John couldn't stop, he didn't want to stop. Whilst he'd be lying if he said there wasn't a bit of guilt when he went back to Mary, when he was with Sherlock nothing else seemed to matter, everything else was conveniently forgotten. So many times he convinced himself it was the last time, that he would in fact crash on the sofa, enjoy an innocent takeaway with his longtime best friend after solving their latest case. Yet each and every time they ended up naked and spent, yearning for one another, needing to be close, desperate for the touch, for the intimacy of being together.
Just as Sherlock opened his mouth to protest, his post-orgasm brain taking a tad longer than usual to craft a soul destroying verbal assault, Sally Donovan in all her smug glory strutted in. With all the subtlety of a sledge hammer she looked the detective up and down and said with pure relish, “busy night then, freak?”
“I’m sorry,” John whispered, “I'm so sorry, you're still by best friend, I still care so much about you, I love you Sherlock, you know that.”
“Hey, John mate stay still,” a pair of hands gently pushed him back to the bed and as much as John wanted to create a scene he didn't have the energy, simply slumping back to the bed. “Take it easy John,” Lestrade said gently, patting him on the arm in the least condescending way he could muster, “it's ok, Sherlock’s ok.
“I've got to go my love,” John said quietly, faffing around for as long as he could, feeling like a wanker, waking Sherlock not only to leave him but leave him when he was sick. “I've got you some more tea and water. Let me help you take some painkillers before I go,” gingerly he eased Sherlock into his arms and helped him knock back a few pills before placing a cool cloth on the clammy forehead.
“Yes you’ve made that abundantly clear” Sherlock snapped, he stood to storm away but only made it to the chair before half collapsing back down.
“You’ll never be pedestrian,” John said softly, taking Sherlock’s hand with a small smile he hoped Sherlock would return, “it’s been a difficult few months. I know, you’re suffering and I don’t want you to suffer. I’m so sorry Sherlock its just with Mary and the baby…” John trailed off his face flushing a little, “I want us to be together, please know that, you’re the person I’m meant to be with. It’s just right now I need to support Mary, she’s having my baby, I don’t have a choice.”
John's heart lurched, Sherlock shouldn't have to tell him he was struggling, that he was battling the demons that nearly killed him so many years a go. John should just know, after everything they’ve been through together, he suddenly detested himself as he battled for the words.
“I worry, yes things are complicated but nothing has changed how important you are or how I feel about you.”
“Sorry John,” Sherlock murmured, rolling up the sleeve of his increasingly grubby dressing gown. The heroin was some of the good stuff, he couldn't even remember how it came to be in his possession, he had more than enough money and time on his hands to get the best quality with relative ease nowadays. Maybe things would look up when the baby came and life calmed down, Sherlock thought, his mind frantic and bitter, maybe their unrequited love would win and maybe Sherlock would finally sort his pathetic life out and be the man that John Watson deserved. Or maybe John will be with Mary forever and Sherlock will continue to not do a thing about it like the coward he truly was.
“Thinking so loudly, you're blaming yourself for my overdose. Don’t, it's not you, it's my issues, my demons.”
“Tell me what you want love,” John whispered, bringing his lips into Sherlock’s ear, who gasped as the hot breath met his skin and sent chills much further south. John’s tone had suddenly darkened, deliciously his tone dropping half an octave, a lustful power in his bright eyes, Captain Watson was making an appearance! “Do you want me to suck you, do you want to fuck me… oh you want me to fuck you?”
Whilst his mind place didn't have a room for pregnancy, Sherlock guessed between 3 and 18 hours Baby Watson would be in the world. What would they call her, John would want a traditional name with Scottish roots, Mary would want something obscure and everyone knew who wore the trousers in the Watson household and it certainly wasn't the Doctor. For a while Sherlock had wondered if it was a fake belly, even wondered if Mary would somehow drug the entire ward and her husband, miraculously find a baby and everyone would be none the wiser. Sherlock was aware those were deeply unpleasant thoughts but he wouldn't put anything past her anymore! He had tried with Mary, initially he’d genuinely liked her, then she put a bullet in his chest and it all went a bit down hill. Looking him in the eye, pointing a gun at close range and pulling the trigger then leaving him to bleed to death on the floor did leave one a tad bitter. Yet although there was a constant ache in his chest, that wasn't what caused Sherlock the most pain, it was the fact that even though John had cradled Sherlock’s dying body, begged him to return to the land of the living and held his hand every moment, he still chose Mary.
“Well that's good to hear,” John murmured, delighted that a blush had crept into Sherlock’s pale cheeks, a curl falling perfectly across those icy orbs which John was starting to drown in.
“It's fine,” Sherlock said suddenly, ploughing through the moment of uncomfortable silence like a bull in a china shop, he yanked at his t-shirt but hissed as his feigned enthusiasm jarred his wound. Without a word Sherlock lay back down with a grimace, exposing his bare flesh to John, looking away as the Doctor's gentle hands tended to his latest injury.
“Yes, god yes!” Sherlock was practically panting in arousal, sweat was dripping down his back but nerves suddenly overcame him.
“No John,” Lestrade said gently, “he fell off a balcony, the perp pushed him after the bloody moron ran off in his own. He's in surgery, he broke a rib that punctured his lung, mild conclusion, broken wrist a few scrapes and the like, but he will be fine.”
“John,” Sherlock practically moaned the name, a needy growl in his voice as he gripped the doctor like his life depended on it, “John I can't do this. If we do this I can't go back, I can't not need you, I can't ever let you go, you can't ever let me go.”
“So you like boys?” John’s frankness surprised even himself but he couldn't help himself as this beautiful, strange creature was clearly unashamedly flirting with him.
“I didn't say that, I said women aren't my area,” Sherlock brought the glass to his lips, looking over it with a gaze that suddenly smouldered, his pupils blown wide, almost covering the hypnotic blue irises, a seductive smile playing at his lips.
“She dotes on you, I could tell the second I met her. Oh god, she’s not waiting to give me the break his heart I break your legs lecture is she?”
“I've got you my darling, I've got you.” John shucked off his clothes and pulled on a pair of pyjamas before sliding next to Sherlock who instantly threw himself into the warm embrace burying his clammy face in John’s shoulder, John's good shoulder of course, which was fine because John preferred to sleep on the left anyhow. The bed upstairs was just for show, John hadn't slept there since he moved out the only visit it had was when Lestrade was too drunk to stagger home and he had to sleep the hangover off before he picked up his kids, if the Inspector had clocked that John and Sherlock weren't just being good mates by sharing a bed and letting him have the spare room, he didn't say anything.
“Yes,” John instinctively took Sherlock’s hand relieved when the detective didn't snatch it away, holding it tightly back, somewhat cautiously running his thumb over Johns knuckles. The doctor had seen Sherlock’s mangled flesh, the scars, the way Sherlock flinched when a car backfired, couldn't stand being in small dark spaces or that he limped after a long day. Of course John saw, of course he knew the most important person in his life had been broken by his time away.
“You nearly died, you can't nearly die on me again. I've lost you once and damm well nearly lost you again on that operating table, I can't do it again. You can't leave me again.”
“The only place I have to be is right here.” Sherlock smiled his cat like smile and simply nestled into John's embrace, resting on his bare chest as soft fingers gently stroked his unruly curls until he fell back into a peaceful sleep.
John wanted things that Sherlock could never give him and certainly had no desire to give him, after all he was most definitely not father material. Mycroft could probably adopt him some kids pretty easily if he so chose, he could plonk the crying, smelly little thing on John's lap and give him the domesticity he craved. But that would be cruel, irresponsible and in Sherlock's mind, downright tedious. Sherlock was a ridiculous man but he wouldn't put an innocent child through the bedlam that was his life and quite frankly couldn't stand the thought himself! One couldn't really say to a toddler, ‘would you mind just looking after yourself as Daddy is going to run through London after a knife wielding Russian Mobster, which will likely end in a dramatic first fight and a gory injury, then Daddy is going to sleep for 12 hours, have a cigarette then fuck other Daddy senseless.’ Sherlock was too selfish, too volatile and quite frankly too uninterested. He was a train wreck really, a junkie through and through desperately seeking his hit, he made his best friend, the greatest thing that ever happened to him, watch his tragic and bloody death. John was too good, far too good for him and the idea of John leaving his nice, normal wife was a tragically laughable thought... So Sherlock made every single second with the good doctor count. Sherlock knew this would end, it would probably crash and burn and kill them both a little bit, damage their already irreparable souls. Yet when John moaned in his ear, 'my beauty, my love,' as his lips soothed a tender nip to his sensitive neck, at that glorious moment in time, Sherlock couldn't bring himself to care.
“I’m not yours to worry about John,” the words stung as they made way for a dark silence that hung in the air, the bitter lack of sound taunted them. Neither were able to look at the other as Sherlock simply slumped in the sofa and looked away as John stared at the cold toast waiting for his watery vision to clear.
“I, yes,” Sherlock squeaked, catching himself, “but we don't have to, we can do whatever you want, I just want to be with you.”
“No John I want you to stay, I never want you to go,” the lanky detective let out an all mighty cough and curled in on himself with a woeful, dramatic moan. Johns heart melted a little as he took in Sherlock's sorry state, fussing around with the bed clothes and pillows. Sherlock's face was white, a light sheen covering the pale skin as inky curls stuck to his face and splayed out at all angles like a demented halo. As much as Sherlock would deny it, he was quite simply run down, having a lingering cold coupled with no sleep or proper food since a particularly ridiculous case involving a tiger smuggler and a two mile foot chase thorough Camden Lock in the pouring rain.
Sherlock often marvelled how he lived alone without dying for so long, somehow John had got him to eat and sleep in a slightly more normal fashion and he hadn't touched drugs whilst the doctor shared his home, hadn't even been tempted in fact. Although cigarettes were a slightly different story, Sherlock’s mind was too active, his world too colourful and soul too damaged to survive without some sort of hit, at least John helped turn his 3 pack a day habit into a not-so-secret drag at midnight every now and again. John always seemed to know when he was craving one, although Sherlock would loathe to admit it but he actually loved the proud little looks John would issue when he successfully directed Sherlock into a new activity to ease his troubled mind. Nicotine probably wasn't strong enough right now as Sherlock threw himself on the settee and curled up, loathing everything and everyone including his own blasted transport that was crying out for something, anything to take the pain away. John and Mary were having a baby, that was it, they were a family, a part of each other for eternity snd Sherlock wanted to die, it felt like his heart was being physically ripped from his chest. They made a human that will keep them together, and John away from Sherlock. A selfish thought but the detective would admit he was a selfish man when John Watson was concerned. Sherlock never wanted to be apart from John, he wanted to hold him, grow old with him, go on their ridiculous adventures forever more, but John didn't want that, he can’t want it otherwise they’d have bloody shacked up by now!Despite their recent interrupted passion and John’s declaration of love, Sherlock was certain John actually wanted a family, a house in the suburbs watching school plays and attending PTAs, the thought made him gag. Although it tore Sherlock apart, ripped his bleeding heart to shreds, John’s happiness was all Sherlock wanted… and he didn’t think he was part of that. Sighing, Sherlock lit a cigarette not even attempting to go outside, the nicotine would do for now and John wouldn't be calling any time soon.
“You're the most important person to me also. I just thought we would get back to how we were again at some point. We've barely had a conversation for the last 6 months, I miss you so very much.”
“No problem mate,” John said mildly, smiling amicably at the DI as if it was a totally normal occurrence that they walked in on Sherlock the morning after shagging the life out of an army doctor who killed a murderer 12 hours earlier and was now sat pleasantly in the kitchen drinking coffee in his pants. Sherlock let out a breath he didn't know he was holding as Lestrade stood with a dramatic sigh and walked to the door, politely John followed them and opened the door with a friendly smile. However the newfound serenity was quickly shattered when Sally Donovan strode straight up to John and snarled viciously in his face, “You didn't take my advice about staying away from the freak then.”
Sherlock sighed and continued, his voice flat, “I wasn't trying to kill myself John but that wouldn't have been the worst outcome, my last conversation with you, your laugh the last sound I heard, reading your blog as I slipped off. It wasn't my intention to die on the plane but it would have been a pleasanter way to go that having my head blown off in the middle of God only knows where on some meaningless suicide mission.”
“And John, when you leave, don't wake me, go when I'm asleep. I can't watch you leave John, I can't do that.”
Sherlock staggered out, pale to the point of being white, an unhealthy sheen across his face as he flopped down on the sofa, reaching for the tea with shaking hands.
“You haven’t let me down.” John reached over and gently laid a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, “We’ll get through this, I’m not going to let you suffer.”
But he never would have given up the opportunity to have John and Rosie in his life. No amount of applause could ever compare.
Yes, hello, I love Stephanie. She was originally only meant to have a couple of lines, but after the first exchange between her and Sherlock, I decided, nope, I need more of her. I actually had to reel it back, because I wanted to keep writing her. Even though it doesn't enter into the story in any way, I can tell you her favourite films, the names of the cuddle toys on her bed (which she absolutely has about a dozen of) and what she ate for lunch this afternoon.
Once again, I want to thank Christy and Bel. My cheerleaders, my supporters, my editors, and my best friends. I love them so much, and this one is definitely for them.

I agonised for ages about what song Sherlock should sing for his audition, to the point where I actually considered writing two versions of this chapter. I'm still considering writing the other version. The conflict was the the song I have in mind for the other version is both more impressive and I personally feel it touches a chord to who Sherlock is as a character (And every version I've heard of it being sung has at one time brought me to tears) but it doesn't really have much opportunity in it for dancing. Seize The Day is a great song, don't get me wrong, but it's more about the dance for me. If you've seen clips of Newsies live, you'll know exactly what I mean.  Any guesses what the other song I was planning on going with might be? I'll give a clue, it's also from a Disney Renaissaince film
The play is cast, the actors have arrived, and it's time for the first read through of the script. John takes advantage of his role as Stage Dad to do a bit of investigating of his own. Investigations aren't the only thing he's becoming more comfortable with, either.
“I'd like to change that too, John. You are kind and noble not to mention the most beautiful man I’ve ever laid eyes on. For the record I’m not going to run a mile, you have a past too and I hope you will one day feel able to share that with me. You are special John Watson, nothing could say would change that.”
“Jesus Sherlock, I’m not going to last,” John panted, “I want to touch you, come up here!” Eagerly obliging, Sherlock released John’s throbbing member and shimmied up so their bodies were aligned. None to gently, the tall man thrust his hardness against his bedfellows, the friction was utterly delicious, rutting like horny teenagers might not have been the most sophisticated way to get off but dear god it was effective!
The sheets mostly covered John's naked form but a strong arm was flung out, turned in such a way the vicious scar that ended his army career was on show, the white lines seemed to glisten in the midnight light. Knots, thick scar tissue and gradually healing lines were twisted together to create the starburst of mangled flesh on John's shoulder. Clearly it caused John pain, Sherlock already new there was an element of psychosomatics with the injury but physical pain could not be denied with a scar of this magnitude. Throughout their dinner Sherlock quietly deduced it was his left shoulder, a through and through that got infected, leaving nerve damage and irreparable muscles. Occasionally John flinched when reaching for something or gesticulating a tad too grandly. When they became intimate Sherlock noticed John struggled a little pulling the jumper over his injured shoulder and Sherlock wondered if the doctor was comfortable revealing his wound, the sleuth was fairly confident this was the first sexual encounter since the ill-fated discharge even before John had confirmed as such. Instinctively Sherlock wanted to touch the mark, learn about each line and deduce every detail of the garish ordeal… yet something stopped him. This stern little army doctor who he'd only known a week with a heart of gold and nerves of steel had changed him, so Sherlock had simply left it alone. John didn't seem shy about revealing the wound but Sherlock still didn't touch it, didn't look too hard, he couldn't hurt John. A smile crept across the pale face, still not quite believing that this person had come into his life, someone who genuinely seemed to like him, wanted to hear about his life, didn't think his quirks were weird, or that he was a freak, John was kind, funny, generous not to mention incredibly beautiful and Sherlock could only hope John wouldn't regret what happened between them.
“I'm not sure I can keep it down,” Sherlock muttered, he looked up at the doctor with sunken eyes under full lashes, “you're trying to take care of me, I appreciate that, you’re a good man.”
“I'm not the soldier in the room, I wouldn't stand a chance against an army man! I'm sure it's because of your military charm the waitress gave us the bottle to take back.”
“Of course my love.” Sherlock nodded and allowed John to kiss him, to stroke his hair, run his hands over his naked flesh as he let himself believe this wasn't the last time, that John would still be there when he awoke and his one true love would love only him back. Birds sang, the traffic started to thunder and the detective's heart was hammering violently, the sunlight was streaming through the slight gap in the curtains and it was only a matter of moments before John would be gone. Sherlock had been awake most of the night, he couldn't sleep knowing this was the last time John would be in his bed, that he would never hold the good doctor again, never feel his lips on his skin. Eventually John stirred and Sherlock closed his eyes, he could feel John's gaze on him and had to hold back a sob as a hand gently ran through his wild curls. He kept his eyes closed, Sherlock couldn't watch John leave, he'd ensured pain, anguish and had been on the brink of death more times than he cared to admit but watching John Watson leave, knowing he wasn't coming back was the one thing Sherlock knew would truly destroy him. Keeping his eyes shut he felt John crouch next to him and softly kiss his cheek and sweep a stray curl off his face.
“I do believe you,” John said gently, his tone was genuine, “getting clean is something you should be proud of.”
One more miracle, that's all John had asked for, even prayed for, he'd got down on his knees and begged to a higher power he wasn't even sure existed. John had screamed, he’d pleaded, he’d sobbed, knowing it was all in vain because Sherlock Holmes was dead. His best friend was dead, the man who had saved him from the tragically endless monotony the snipers bullet had forced upon him, who'd taken him away from his lonely life of self-imposed uselessness that would undoubtedly end with the invalided doctor fingering the trigger of his pistol for a final time. Sherlock had saved him, that mad, violin playing maniac who leapt around the flat like a deranged dervish, put eyeballs in the freezer and used John's toothbrush in alarming experiments had saved him. John wasn’t sure if he'd ever truly been in love before but he knew he loved Sherlock, more than anyone else in the world save his own Mother. Perhaps not the conventional violins and red roses kind of love, although in this day and age John mused what conventional love even meant, however what John did know was whatever he and Sherlock had, was definitely some sort of love. That crazy, glorious man was always in John’s mind, ridiculous curls, razor cheekbones and all, when Sherlock hurt, John hurt, when Sherlock laughed, John laughed. When Sherlock died so did a little part of John. The good doctor would quite happily die for that man because he knew deep down Sherlock would do exactly the same for him, without even blinking. Hat-man and Robin, Holmes and Watson, best friends, soulmates, whatever they were, whatever they had been, it was over and it killed John every single day. He would never see the swish of that stupidly expensive coat Sherlock wore even in baking sunshine, never hear the beautiful trills of the violin that always soothed him after a nightmare the beautiful madman always knew he’d suffered, John would never share a Thai green curry whilst Sherlock rambled about the case before collapsing on John's shoulder or in his lap when he was especially tired despite the protests he was fine. Sometimes John was convinced he'd heard the rumbling baritone when the leaves rustled, he swore he'd seen the mop of inky curls in a crowd, was positive he'd smelt that musky cologne mixed with tobacco despite the detective’s insistence he'd given up smoking. But of course he hadn't because Sherlock Holmes was dead and now John's world was forever a darker place.
“You need to eat something,” John said, suddenly hauling them out of the awkward silence they found themselves drowning in.
“You're a good man Sherlock, I’ve only known you a short while but you've changed my life for the better. You're a man with a past, there's a lot I don't know about you, there's a lot about me you don't know, but over time, I hope we can change that.”
“For Christ sakes!” Sherlock fumed, stomping dramatically across the lounge with as much distain as one could manage after being pounded into blissful oblivion by a sexy army captain a few hours before. He turned to the DI and snarled, “Lestrade, you can't just barge into my flat unannounced.”
John chuckled, “well you’ll have to. Now I don’t have to deal with the early wakeup calls I’ve come to realise I’m not a morning person! Also morning sex is far more enjoyable when a I don’t taste like a rubbish bin and I’ve had a cup of coffee.”
“You're not the only one who was saved this week.” Their eyes met, a stare so intense everything else it the room evaporated, the only sounds were soft breathing and a crackling fire.
“Oh shush,” John swatted his hand with fake annoyance but his ears went crimson and Sherlock could tell he enjoyed the compliment.
“What?” Sherlock sounded genuinely surprised and spun around quickly, “no of course not, quite the opposite I would very much like you to stay but after what you've just heard…” he trailed off, looking away, his face crumpled and shoulders sagged in defeat, “and hearing it from that awful woman. I should have told you, I would have told you… It just didn't seem like the time, we were having such a truly wonderful time together and I just,” he sighed dejectedly, “it doesn't matter, these are just excuses, I’m sorry John.”
“Such a diva Dr Watson, but I will be the gracious host and make you a coffee but don’t come back out here with clothes on because I’m not done staring at the sexy naked man in my bed!”
John sighed and closed the book he wasn't really reading and put it on the perfectly organised shelf in the perfectly organised flat he shared with his wife. John was happy, of course he as happy, he had a steady job, a wonderful wife and a nice flat close to work and at a decent price. John was normal, John was happy. He had to be happy because for the last 2 year his best friend, the reason he hadn't put a bullet in his head when he was discharged from the only thing in his life he'd ever been good at, the beautiful mad man with sharp cheekbones and an even sharper tongue had been gone. He'd died at John's feet and he had grieved and cried and even wished it had been him splayed at the bottom of the hospital instead of the closest thing to a soulmate he’d ever had. Sherlock was back but unfortunately that didn't change 2 years of grief and 2 years of trying to have an ounce of happiness back in his life. “John?” “Coming darling,” John was happy, of course he was happy, maybe life was a little calmer, a little less exciting, a little bit less Sherlock, but he was happy. John was happy...John had to be.
Without warning he took Sherlock’s face in his hands, his heart breaking at the tear-stains and continued speaking, his voice urgent, “Life is complicated right now and I wish it wasn’t, I can’t change that Mary is having my baby.
“Don’t apologise, it’s sexy, knowing little old me is occupying your thoughts,” John planted a tender, reassuring kiss on Sherlock’s lips before he nipped at the pale earlobe, earning a gasp from the tall man.
“It's not ok, no, let me see him please!” The world was spinning, the air was becoming thick, John needed to gulp it in but his throat was closing, he couldn't think, he couldn’t stand, he couldn't even breathe. The only thing he could do was whisper a name before the world went black and darkness consumed him.
So many times John came close to plucking up the courage and leaving Mary and committing to Sherlock but every time something stopped him. Sometimes it was the late night talks with his wife about moving to the countryside, having a dog and a few more kids to run around after, sometimes it was Sherlock's coldness usually coupled with his dangerous obsession with the work and disregard for life that left John half way between despair and rage. Sometimes John thought Sherlock would never settle down, would hate the mundane life a stable relationship would bring, that he’d realise John Watson was ordinary and he was extraordinary, perhaps Sherlock didn’t mean to but sometimes he made that abundantly clear. The work was Sherlock’s life, John was his friend of course, an enjoyable shag but he’d never actually settle down and commit, sacrifice his ridiculous, exhilarating, death-defying exciting life for ordinary John Watson. Yet sometimes it was John’s own cowardice, Captain John Watson the reliable, sturdy, family man, he had a good job, a wife who he loved, a baby on the way and a future that he so yearned for. Mary was nice, she was safe, she was beautiful… but Mary wasn't Sherlock, which is exactly why John fought every natural instinct and had been keeping his distance from the beautiful genius. It wasn't fair on either of his lovers but John didn't know what else to do, he had to be there for his wife and child, had to step up, Sherlock himself would never have forgiven him if he'd abandoned the pregnant Mrs Watson. Whilst a twisted chivalrous act, it meant that Holmes and Watson could barely be in the same room, neither would be able to keep their reluctant pact after spending time together with so much love, and not to mention raw animalistic attraction between them… The detective jerked a little, crashing John out of his thoughts, Sherlock writhed slightly as the comedown tore through his body. John wanted to hold him, to heal him until Sherlock was his beautiful madman again, kiss him until he was senseless, never let him go. But John didn't, he couldn’t, so he simply sighed, rubbed his betraying eyes and silently placed the sickly sweet tea next to the broken man.
“We don’t have to do this, we can carry on fooling around, it’s all good I just want to be with you. Sherlock look at what you do to me, whatever you want is fine my darling, I promise.”
“There was always something to fight for, always a reason to keep going no matter how bad it got. Keeping you, Molly, Mrs Hudson and Lestrade safe, coming back to Baker Street, seeing my parents again, being back with you, that's what kept me going. It was a battle but I won it, I did my job, it was worth the fight.” The grip on John’s hand suddenly became tighter, “This was a bullshit mission they made Mycroft send me on, some abstract drug cartel in the middle of nowhere that the secret service are too incompetent to solve, or don't want to risk their own men to bring it down. I don't want to fight again John.”
“If it makes you feel better to think that,” the detective muttered, reluctantly taking a tiny bite of the cold toast, “I don't think that is a discussion to be had right now.” Sherlock murmured through a mouthful of crumbs, his face wrinkling in distain at the cold, hard bread, pushing the plate away, looking even more queasy that before.
“I would never hurt you John but I’m tired, so tired, I’m in pain and you’re in pain. This isn’t what I fought for, this isn't how the battle was supposed to end.”
With a long, wheezing gasp Sherlock awoke with an unpleasant start, practically flinging himself out of the bed, a disorientated, sweating wreck. Sherlock Holmes was a man of steel with the brains of a philosopher and the brutality of a hungry lion who didn't flinch at the bloodiest of battle, yet here he was shaking like a leaf because of a bad dream. It wasn't the first time he’d had a bad dream in his thirty odd years on this miserable planet but this one was pretty high on the list of shit ones. When he was a child he used to dream of pirates, usually they were fun he would be the captain of the ship commanding what mysterious islands they would travel to. Occasionally he wouldn't be the captain and would be thrown overboard to a watery grave, Mummy always said he had got over excited but she would still tuck him back in bed with a soft smile making sure his teddy was in reach. Mummy always made the bad dreams better, except for the ones with Red Beard in. Ironically he dreamt his beloved dog was actually still alive and would cry so hard, shaking with heaving, gasping sobs when he realised his fluffy companion was never going to be in his arms again even Mummy couldn't calm him back to sleep. With a weary sigh Sherlock got out of bed with shaking legs, he was a grown man but right now he would do anything for his mother to ruffle his hair, bring him some milk and hug him. Of course that was ridiculous because his mother was getting old and was probably on a cruise and grown men don't hug their mothers after a bad dream. Although he supposed grown men did need comfort sometimes, he had hugged John many times when he had a bad dream, he was a wounded army veteran of course he slept badly and Sherlock didn't mind looking after him, John was a hero after all, he was his best friend and he wanted to help. Sherlock quite liked it really, he’d never been good at comforting people, never really knew what to say but with John, hugging him after a nightmare, making some sickly sweet tea and playing Beethoven on the violin at 3 in the morning seemed to soothe John’s troubled mind.
“I wasn't talking about Mycroft,” Sherlock snapped, but the quiver in his voice threatened to outshine the facade of anger he was half heartedly clinging to. “I'm not talking about anything. I need to use the bathroom.” Sherlock practically staggered out the room, his usual glide was unsteady, his whole body suffering the effects of the dramatic comedown. Stalking out a few minutes later the detective now had his dressing gown on and he pulled it tight around his dangerously skinny frame.
“He’s fine.” John took a steadying breath as he said the words aloud, needing to convince himself, reiterate that joyously, sobering fact. “Yes.”
“Oh god!” Suddenly John stopped in his tracks, his face noticeably greying, their passionate embrace suddenly halting. Putting a hand on his shoulder Sherlock said softly, “Its ok John, you need to go, it's ok.”
“I love you too, Jesus of course I love you, you are the most gorgeous, intelligent, kindest man. I know we aren’t in a great situation but I need you to know that this is it, it’s you and me, whatever happens I …”
“Can't you stay?” Sherlock’s voice was a cracked whisper, he wasn't listening for the answer, he knew it was no, knew John had promised to have lunch with some of their other couple friends but had to do the grocery shop first. The thought of John Watson mooching around Asda picking which crisps and dip to serve to his couple friends with their 9-5 jobs and 2.5 kids was ironically hilarious, yet that was what John Watson was doing with his Saturday morning instead of spending it with Sherlock making sweet lazy love and chatting nonsense for hours on end. “I'm sorry my love, feel better,” planting a tender kiss on those razor cheek bones, John left Baker Street knowing the only thing that would be in his mind whilst he ate lunch with his wife would be 6 feet of snivelling consulting detective curled under the covers wearing John’s hideous jumper that did in fact clash with his hair.
It's fine love, it's all fine," John said softy, gently pulling the detective in for a passionate kiss which Sherlock reciprocated with a playful tug on John's lip who let out a needy moan.
Coughing a little as the smoke travelled through his body Sherlock tried to steady his hand that held the light, still shaking noticeably. His mind was spinning, the nicotine wasn’t helping, thoughts of John, his new life, the life he would never have with Sherlock were racing through his head. It was suddenly a reality, any shred of hope, the fantasy that one day John would walk away from Mary and be with Sherlock were crumbling. On the plus side John had asked Sherlock to be the godparent, well for normal people this would be a plus side Sherlock thought bitterly, almost laughing out loud as this own sardonic thoughts. Godparent! The thought made Sherlock sick, watching over the very thing that will tie John and Mary together forever, the thought was laughable. ‘How do you know Daddy, Uncle Sherlock,’ Baby Watson might ask one day, ‘well actually I used to sleep with your Daddy under your Mummy's nose, we were going to run away together then she got pregnant with you and it all went somewhat to shit!’ Suddenly Sherlock couldn't stand his own thoughts anymore and threw the cigarette to the floor stamping on it, ignoring the slight pain as the heat touched his bare foot, the burn was actually a welcome distraction.
“Let’s go to the bedroom,” Sherlock purred, John cupped his face and planted another kiss to Sherlock’s pouty lips who let out a little whimper of pleasure. With little grace they fumbled their way to the bedroom, Sherlock was practically ripping off John’s shirt who was half carrying the gorgeous detective, refusing to part their lips for more than a second. John’s mobile phone suddenly started to blare, startling them both, he silenced it quickly with a hurried apology before planting his lips back on Sherlock, trailing kisses along his collarbone as they finally reached the bedroom. Obnoxiously the phone range rang again and although John let it ring out, the text alert then sounded and John felt compelled to check, quickly skimming the message.
John simply nodded and the detective kissed him softly before watching him hurry out of the flat, those betraying tears once again pricking at his eyes as the front door shut.
at the sleeping form but he couldn't help it. The faintest glimmer of sparkling moonlight was shining through the gap in the curtains catching that stunning face, seemingly illuminating the tanned skin. Sherlock released the breath he didn't even realise he was holding. John Watson is the most stunningly beautiful man he'd ever laid eyes on and now he was in Sherlock Holmes’ bed after a glorious night of laughter and friendship unexpectedly ended in a far more intimate way. Allowing himself another moment to drink John in, Sherlock marvelled at the beautiful doctor, how could he not? It was no surprise John was an army man, his body was firm, gently toned under that hideously endearing wooly jumper. During their wonderfully endless conversations Sherlock had got lost in John's eyes on more than one occasion, there was pain behind them, a deep rooted anguish the soldier probably wasn't even aware he carried around but they were also so beautiful. Honesty and kindness shone through the hazel orbs and there was an infectious glint in them when he laughed, a sound that Sherlock was sure not many people were lucky enough to hear.
Anxiousness forgotten, Sherlock threw his head back and opened his legs, he couldn't remember the last time he was this excited, this unashamedly turned on!
Sherlock’s tone was suddenly harsh, an uncontrolled desperation to his voice and he looked away, his face as bitter as his words.
“A few hours won't make much of a difference,” half naked, sex rumpled, John had reappeared and calmly plonked himself down next to Lestrade, sipping a coffee like he'd lived there forever.
“I'll make some more tea,” John muttered, unable to bare the silence he hurried to the kitchen, the chances of anything being consumed were slim but he had to do something, he was a bloody doctor for Christ sakes, John couldn't let his friend suffer, especially as he knew full well he was part of the reason for Sherlock’s anguish. John heaped some sugar into the tea and brought it to the detective, who was curled up against the back of the settee. John took a moment to stare, he couldn't help it, neither of them ever could, which is partly why they were in this damm mess he thought bitterly. Sherlock looked wrecked, there were no two ways about it. Pale to the point of grey, skinny as a rake and dark, sunken eyes more haunted, more pained than John had ever seen. It broke his heart to see his beautiful madman in such a state but what shattered it was that deep down John knew he was part of the reason for Sherlock’s pain. Every time he and Sherlock were so much as in the same room John asked himself what he was doing, why they weren't together, why neither of them had done anything about the overwhelming passion that burned between them. John hated himself for it, he'd cheated on his wife with his best friend, who he then pretty much abandoned when Mary fell pregnant. Realistically Mary probably never suspected anything, undoubtably John's borderline obsession with his best friend’s resurrection irked her a little but the chances of her figuring out that John was in fact having the best sex of his life with his eccentric former flatmate, not innocently crashing on the sofa for convenience after a case, was highly doubtful.
Mary was great, smart, funny, beautiful and the guilt always hit when she earnestly encouraged their little get togethers, insisting he accompany Sherlock on a case, smiling with a gentle roll of the eyes at his stories, happy that her partners’ best friend that he grieved so long for was back. Undoubtedly Mary would feel differently if she knew John was shagging that said best friend more often her, significantly more often. Mary had a soft spot for the crazy defective so was more than happy, eager in fact, for John to help him after his latest injury, as frustrating as the long recovery had been for all parties at least it was an excuse for John to come over more, with the added benefit of Mary's blessing. She even packed John an overnight bag when Sherlock's surgical incision became mildly infected, very mildly infected and the doctor had a less than orthodox way to help the mad detective feel better. John never thought he would be an adulterer, always holding himself to a higher moral standard, he served for Queen and Country after all, but it was all too easy really. Mary had taken a job at a hospital, much better money, more interesting work and closer to the flat, her shifts meant she was often working through the night and since John had taken on some locum work they could go days without crossing paths. Days where John would arrange his work strategically so he and the detective could have hours of uninterrupted bliss and nights of endless passion without Mary suspecting a thing. This couldn't go on forever, something had to give, John couldn't keep lying to his wife, he couldn't keep deceiving people and living a double life... but as a pair of very full, very male, very Sherlock lips descended onto his, at that moment, John couldn't bring himself to care.
“I didn't want to suffer either,” Sherlock murmured, “in my youth, drugs were how I took myself out of the hell that I found reality to be. For a long time I could never truly fathom finding a place in this miserable world, I never knew how I fit into it, how to fit in with others. Then I discovered that drugs took the edge off reality, they sharpened my focus, allowed me to block out the foolish distractions, they made the world make more sense, something I always struggled with. John, I don't need to lie to you, manipulate you into believing one false excuse or another, you always get the truth from me. As much as I try to deny it, recently I've found myself distracted, as pathetic as it sounds I feel somewhat lost and am unable to resist reverting back to my old habits. For a long time I've not been tempted, I never felt the need, I had the work, I have people who for some unfathomable reason care about me and the world made a little bit more sense... but at present my world does not make much sense and the drugs seem to be a struggle I cannot overcome. I need something to sharpen my focus, to keep my mind vaguely sane and to stop the distractions of this hellish reality. I was going to be exiled John, likely get my head blown off in the middle of nowhere,” he sighed and rubbed his red eyes, “I didn't want to fight any more, I'd already fought for two miserable, lonely years. I'm older, weaker and I've had a bullet through my chest since then. Yes, there were times after the fall when I was on top of the world, where I lived for the adrenaline but I didn't fake my death to be clever, you know that. It wasn't all terrible but it was hard, it was lonely, it was painful, you've seen what they did to me.”
Then a little more than a decade ago, there had been an insane palace coup – again Mr. Mott's description – after a secret psychic princess telepathically imploded on Betazed and had the planet committing mass suicide. Deanna's description of feeling the emotions of her mother's death was harrowing.
Love rattled its cage, but he told himself there was no point in saying anything. They'd be off for new assignments soon.
Mshindi Victorius, Victor, paced in front of the window planning for when they would take on the trek when they were older.
John grew more and more tired. Small wonder given the restless drumming inside him. Devouring his body with mass.
Veema said, "They continued to drive many insane until some brave souls returned to this world to hold the first of the Conchordia. That was before we developed the radiation shielding. They could not be allowed to contribute to reproduction after that event, and so we developed our current methods of," Pavan coughed, "Never mind. But you must have gone to the future. Who else could it have been? It's only logical."
Sherlock hummed and stepped away quickly, leaving John swaying. Sweating. Too hot for all these clothes. Aching. His back ached. He rubbed against the table, but that didn't help his restlessness. He arched his back into open space, balancing by pushing up with his knees under the lip of the well secured lab table. That didn't ease the ache. Another textbook indication of heat, which wasn't possible.
Chin said, "Billy. We've found Connor. There will soon be security everywhere. Leave with me now. I can take you to Beta Augurea. You remember that planet I told you about. You'll be fine there. You don't even have to… we don't have to… come away with me."
The implications of Lucy and Sherlock's work with the Ceti Sexus Pollinis were still very much playing out within the Andorian scientific community and larger society.
Also, I had thought about drawing this one out like the actual ST:NG Episode Conundrum, but it was more fun to have Mama G clock Moriarty, who is wearing a crown because of this outfit
Mollyhoo held back slightly. "Sarabeth, be careful." Mollyhoo held the tip of her braid to her lips. "I wouldn't let her rub against you like that. I don't have a vasopressing 1b receptor gene, but you do."
"Hey, there. I'm new. Is there a place I can settled down?" He held up the small bag full of the contents of Sh'Alaack's package. He was glad that Sh'Alaack's kids had wanted to give their grandmother treats from around the galaxy and handmade blanket, and not something less useful.
Both the anal and vaginal stimulators quietly vibrated inside John, stimulating his prostate and graphenberg spot simultaneously. John swallowed a gasp. He hadn't remembered the lowest setting feeling so intense in the past.
"That's not the only reason," said Killander quickly. "Ambassador West died under your watch on a mission where Captain Holmes' brother attempted to gain access to Federation secure records."
But when Connor lay back, no longer straining against the force bonds and said, "Mum. How are my friends? Could you tell them I'm feeling better? I don't want them to worry if they don't have to worry," Billy knew he could let go just a little.
Sherlock nodded and didn’t share his plans for self-destruction to make John leave. The possibility that they would have mingled. The thought that he could have created a simulacrum of a body to carry him on. He did say, "You do realize that the systems containing your consciousness are not entirely stationary. I could have them moved if needed. Perhaps develop the technology necessary to remotely store your consciousness." He would need to examine the records on the positronic android, Commander Data, but it was possible.
He must take it as an honor that Mummy has sent him to as their representative to the hasty meeting of the Alignments. Outside of the usual festivities of the Meiosis. While they had a conversation with their new ally about the meaning of the term, "Hands off."
She peered out at the next valley. In the distance there was a white box like shape pulled by some a yoked team. Larger than any cart she'd seen the Fenisals use in this time period. Around the massive cart were figures astride vashcats, but her eyes were no longer good enough to make out more than vague shapes. She said to Sherjo, "What is it? Another attack?"
She turned and addressed his diploma on the wall. "Did you ever follow up after we got our DNA results?"
Mollyhoo headed down to the entry cave where most of the others were gathered. A few people were tending the fire. The unishaps were grazing on the greening hillsides. Jovas had been carding the unishap wool and was teaching a few of the others to spin it, slowly, half the time they dropped the spindle, but there were now skeins of yarn. One or two of them knew how to knit. Kenner was certain she could make a hand loom. There were possibly very many children on the way. If they survived.
"A day at most," said Doctor Imprid. He was lying. His heart rate was up. There was a slight acrid tinge to his scent. At any time in the last year or so, Billy would have berated the doctor to stop lying to him. To stop acting as if Billy didn't know exactly what was involved with juvenile heat. He'd lived through it.
"No, it would have made more sense," said John. "The cave is nice, but you could build a place to live."
At its basis, the neural neutralizer associated negative impulses with memories of unpleasant sense memories. While positive impulses were given positive sensory associations. In lives so empty of positive associations, these could be added. The scent of warm bread. A parental hug in a life where no hugs had ever been provided and the like. Using technology to gently thwart the dagger of the mind's eye as it were.
She went to get two new pickaxes, tired as she was from working all day. A few people were trying to sleep, but they didn't need to earn their air just at the moment. She didn't know where the captain was digging, but she could help. She slammed it less effectively than the captain into the stone. "Just because it's a bad idea, that doesn’t mean you're not thinking about it. We all think about bad ideas."
Donovan said, "Commander Hudson, you should relieve yourself from duty. This could be a fucking cluster fuck of situation that will require a clear chain of command."
"You too." John hugged his Mother. Her scent surrounding him. Comforting him as sense memory took him back to childhood.
John said, "Show me how to use the device." The bowl felt strange on his head. Prickly. Stranger was the knowledge flooding into him. Everything seemed brighter. Bolder. He knew what he needed to do. He also knew he had three hours to complete the operation or he'd forget, and once started, he needed to finish. Fortunately, he also didn't need to do it alone.
Sherlock looked down. He was still in Slytherin professorial robes. He pulled on an expression he'd seen his mother-in-law use many times. "What, you don't recognize John Watson of the Watson theater troop! My performance of the House of Gint had Ferengi paying top latinum for seats on Ferenginar." Oddly enough, he had seen several presentations of the House Gint once he got the communications arrays set up to take outside signals in his early teens.
The light from the tablet turned Sherlock's eyes pale green. His eyes flickered over pages. Finally he said, "My immediate thought would be Mummy. It's possible that they modified my genetics. I do know based on anecdotal comments by Mummy that… they have the same reproductive issues as the majority of the Augment population."
"It contains parameters for a plaque listing your many accomplishments on board this ship. Now that you have received a commission as a Lieutenant and will be building ships at the Tri-Rho Nautica shipyards, I wish those who will serve with you to understand your depth of knowledge. I would have replicated it, but this will travel better."
Euros didn't understand. She knew her siblings played games all the time. Games hunting and foraging. Tactical games. Strategy games. She knew that other children played pretend. She'd heard them. She walked in their dreams since Mummy said they were going to try an experiment, because she'd been doing so well, and let her leave the lonely palace where all the people were illusions.
"Now Twig's glad he brought me," said Finney. "Now Toothpick's thinking to himself he's glad he brought the old man."
It didn't bring any of the other adults back to the ship, and much less Sherlock. But really that wasn't the point.
He wasn't looking forward to telling Billy. Who'd been tentatively working his way up to asking her if they were serious.
She shook her head and pulled back farther into her closet. John held up one finger, reached into his med kit, and pulled out a ration bar. He peeled back the wrapper, took one bite to show her it was fine and handed it over. She took it slowly. Bit in and sighed. "Oh! Most of the before time food is gone." Then she looked down and sobbed slightly.
Trelane looked at him scandalized. "John, I am practically an adult. It's been literal ages since the last time you saw me." By which he must mean he was approaching whatever passed for a teenager for his people.
John pulled several small purple crystals out of his socks. "A gift from the planet. I gave my um… Daddy your gift," he said glancing back at the Ferengi outside the door.
Chin Singh said, "Mummy kept the situation quite secret. But you must understand, only the Representatives for each alignment had access to the sacred recording. There was a general understanding that the Breen believed they came from us, but until, the… hard to call it a prophecy… time travel prognostication came to pass no one quite understood what it all meant."
Because John was gravid with their second try for Tertius and John had told Sherlock in no uncertain terms to sod off for a few days because he felt like shite and it was Sherlock's fault for smelling so good and crying so beautifully when John fucked his arse that Sherlock had fucked up the illegal suppressors that John had gotten a hold of in just under seven days of them being together again. Thus, Tertius.
"True. Juvenile heats. Depression. Odor sensitivity." She looked at the image of the planet and the birds of prey. All of them orbiting in space. "Sometimes I wish I hadn't given into pressure and had kept up my vivo biology studies instead of going into botany. I want to know more about… me. My daughter. My mother. Why we present certain Augmentation traits and why we sometimes don't."
Mollyhoo said, "The vasopressing 1b receptor gene is the part of our olfactory system that allows us to scent the difference between alphas and omegas. I don’t have it. If and this is a big if, an omega breeds with an alpha, through micro-chimeric transfer from the blastocyst to the omega that alphas scent become… really you wouldn't understand, but the pheromones in an adult alpha's urine that they haven't bred with can um…cause a pregnant omega's hypothalaumus to release dopamine, which prevents the secretion of progesterone, which could cause a miscarriage." She raised her hands palms up and shrugged. "Autopsies." Her lashes flickered. "Late stage autopsies."
For his upcoming trip, he couldn't decide if she actually had gotten word her niece was visiting Beta Aurigae, and wanted to visit her, or if she was being kind yet again.
Sometimes this felt so good, he lingered. Always surprised at how good it felt. He moved slowly. Really working him in and out.
"The Breen traded the Ferengi the technology for space flight in exchange for their moons among other things,"
"He's not my father, he's my Daddy." John sauntered forward, his entire gate different. A bizarre simulacrum of seduction given his apparent age and he was very clearly with chi… that he was very clearly pr… that Sherlock had bred a great many…. Sherlock's mind stuttered. John said, "The captain here picked me up on Deneb IV. He told me he'd get me to Risa. That all I'd have to do to pay for my passage was let him fuck me. Easy choice given that's what I was selling on Deneb IV." John came closer to Lurin.
"Time paradox," muttered Sherlock with some loathing. Then after a bit of a snuggle, Sherlock said into the fold of John's neck, "I thought about returning to save the younger me from the holographic palace where I grew up. Or prevented my parents from transporting me from the Academy," he looked up, "being there when you found out after that first time," and John knew like cold lead what he meant. "But any of those things would have unraveled the whole of where we are now."
Suddenly tired, grey fog flirting with edges of him. There wasn't enough spice or heat in the world to hold it back. He called it a night.
The Andorian local government refused to release John and Donovan, claiming that they'd attacked and seriously injured several people. They wouldn't even let him speak to John, claiming that he'd been placed in solitary confinement for the safety of the other prisoners.
Which made her next choice all the more difficult, but really she couldn't see another way through the situation.
Lieutenant Hunter came into the ready room. "Captain Holmes," her tone that slight bit more formal with the dreaded Internal Affairs on-board, "there's been several more incidents on Janus VI." Her eyes darted to Killander. "An off duty miner was killed at the refinery. At roughly the same time, Lieutenant Hebron and Crewman Stonn were eye witnesses to an attack at the colony by a silicon based lifeform fifty-six kilometers away."
Mycroft straightened the perfect lines on his suit. Reminded himself caring was not an advantage. That tensions might rise again after the Conchordia Ancestrum came to some form of conclusion, or no conclusion at all. Given the nature of things, there might not be a sign that anything had happened at all. After all, there was no way to know when certain key events had and would occur. Mycroft could not bring himself to suggest he arrange each detail, given what that would mean.
However, what John is doing here is less how to change DNA than how to understand DNA. For example, how certain SNPs (pronounced "snips") relates to how people respond to therapeutics. Although, in this case, how Sherlock's SNPs are a therapeutic.
That he even mixed it up. The next time Mycroft came for a visit, Elim was just heading out the door to meet with Captain Sisko about some clandestine work placing self-replicating mines at the entrance to the wormhole. Mycroft said, "I understand. You must cutoff the Dominion's supply lines." Although Elim had only mentioned a sartorial emergency. "Don't worry about the Breen coming into the war. They'll be dead in four generations from a self inflicted wound. What's the point of conquest if you won't be around to see it. Good luck on keeping the Dominion from standing on our graves."
None of the guards reacted to seeing someone who didn't belong on the monitor or even seemed to care about what was going on in any of them.
He walked down dimmed hallways until he came to control room of some sort. A Starfleet crew person was watching an entertainment vid on one monitor and the brig with the other.
But as soon as John noticed the bonding marks, he'd murdered every other omega in the palace. Insisting that Sherlock save all his love for John. Perhaps it had been because of the first flush of pregnancy hormones, but Sherlock had felt so wonderfully loved. Perfectly held. The perfect click of all his raw edges meshing with the broken edges of his perfect match.
"Here's how I see it," said John moving carefully away from the bed. "You've got three options. Option number one, use your considerable resources to help get me home, returning the other John here."
Garak reached up and wrapped the tape around Sherlock's neck. Held it there. "Why would I know anything? I'm just a tailor."
When John came, he drank that down. Breathing quietly as John loosened his grip in Sherlock's hair. Pulled away. John whispered, "You are my favorite. I'm going to send all the others right off. You're the only one I need."
The memories of that particular morose and critical gentleman faded away in warm, pulsing, blue light to be replaced with those of a far more agreeable person.
"I..." The alpha turned to look around them. Seemingly confused by their surroundings. "I need to go."
"Because of me," said Connor. He squeezed when his mum started to protest. "I don't mean in a bad way. It's embarrassing, but I'm not responsible for my genes. But because I would have reacted badly." He could still remember the craving, the almost mindless need, which had made him act so badly to mum. His mum had said he'd had it even worse than Mum had. The Doctors hadn't been sure why it had been so bad.
"I meant, why are you at the relay station?" Sherlock reminded himself not to make suppositions before the evidence, but that a resident of the penal colony had been missing for some months without followup to the sole location on the planet where he could go didn't speak well for their security practices at a minimum.
Sherlock found that tears were trickling cold down his face. John hummed and pulled him to his feet. Kissed his cheek. Whispered. "Love you."
"Did your father know that you knew that he was Kodos?" The only confirmation so far had been Harry's murder of the ambassador and her attempt on Sh'Alaack.
He shrugged. Trying to look as if he didn't care. "Trying to fill in some information about early Augment DNA and try as I might, I can't find any details about what Khan Brittanus did to cure you."
Mummy's old home was nothing to him. Also, the specific location had been destroyed in an explosion.
Nom said, "I know where the indenture papers for the omegas are. I'll trade them to you in exchange for passage out of this horrible system." He made to stand up, but a Breen pointed a disrupter at him. "Or I'll sit here while you kill the Starfleet officer, who could keep you from claiming this system for yourself. He definitely won't let you kidnap the omegas."
Billy's heart squeezed looking at Connor's expression. How much he cared about all his friends. About everyone. "It's awfully late, but let me talk to Mr. Washington."
The omegas clustered together. Tediously talking. Finally, Sarabeth said, "You can stay, but if the two of you become violent when you revert, you're out."
Lurin barked a command, and an opening appeared at the top of the force shield. A fresh gust of air blew into the mine shaft. The opening quickly closed. Lurin said, "I have given you another six hours of air. If you want another six hours, I suggest you work for it." He smiled pleasantly.
It was apropos of nothing and everything that when they arrived it was to find Sherlock arguing with Mycroft.
"Ha!" Sherlock would have gestured his opinion of yet another blatant lie from his mother, but he was too constrained.
Her devices were telling her was that the schematics were grossly out of sync with what had actually been implemented in the facility.
True to her word, Sarabeth worked on a stunningly beautiful painting in the next cave, which was for the best. John couldn't draw more than simple shapes.
"What if that doesn't happen? Please, John. It's possibly not the right time to decide. Hormones flooding through me, but," Sherlock peppered him with kisses, "just think. Your genetic material will transfer into my body as a result of my bearing your children. You'll be part of me forever. Forever!" Sherlock spun John around until they both toppled to the ground. Sherlock straddled John. "Forever, John, you'll be a part of me." His mad genius grinned. "Let's have babies together."
Supersmart went into the ready room and looked around. There was not much personal information to be had. There was a desk at one of the room by a faux fireplace and a bearskin rug. Some aromatic herbs in a curling slipper. By the wide window was a long table surrounded by comfortable chairs. The scents of the personnel on the bridge – with a few exceptions – were present in the room. They had all sat in these chairs. Even, he noted with delight, himself. Although, his scent was strongest by the desk. No doubt placed there by his love to give him a space to be near while his love worked. He said, "I can detect the scents of everyone but two individuals in the ready room. Connor, who presumably is not in the bridge staff," Connor giggled, "and the self proclaimed captain."
She was too busy fabricating the right identity for what she called reconnaissance. A year or so among the enemy learning their weaknesses. Father Noonian laughed and told her it was well past time that she ran away from home. Mummy was enigmatic as usual. Father Meiying reminded her of her duty.
"Why?" John was genuinely puzzled. "It's not your fault that your parents are," he waved a hand to encompass everything.
Chin didn't waste an instant. She tackled Victor before he could jump and knock her off the balance beam. It was a three way battle. They climbed over equipment, while Victor narrated their journey competing to find the treasure that lay in the cave of the ancestors. Something to do with ancient rocks.
They all looked at the spot where Sherlock scent lingered in the air where he and John often sat by the fire.
John didn't turn back around. "I cannot believe this. Do you understand that? I cannot. I will not believe this of my father. He won’t even kill a spider. Mum has to do it. I cannot believe that not only did he kill all those people, but that he kept killing just to keep himself hidden."
"You want to publish," said Donovan flatly. "Your boyfriend published his big story about Andorian reproduction and now you want a spot of glory."
John smiled slightly, and glanced back at on older woman, who had started yelling at him. "How do you think Sugar Babies are born?" He winked at Sherlock.
He was still wobbling afterwards when Sherlock, the berk, changed a setting on his tricorder. "I figured it out. Flip the frequency. I've found the source of their power."
The Hippocrates lurched forward in a way it really wasn't designed to do. Spinning as it went under the remains of the Cortez, massive hold doors open, and scooping up air and debris and people. Parson's trembled as he slapped the controls for the holds a little more forcefully than was necessary.
John crossed his arms to avoid punching the bastard. "Yeah, well, the military runs on documentation."
He delicately removed John's clothes, if unfortunately not the pain belt, with hand units 444 to 450. 440 and 441 took possession of both coms. Held them next to John's ears. Whispered, "I love you," as he lifted him up with 412 to 420.
"My brother, Sherlock, and Doctor Watson are the progenitors of the Breen race." She put her hand over Mummy's. "Time travel. It brought us together. It allowed them to go back in time and create the Breen race, and as they returned it may as yet allow them to…" she stopped and looked down. "Obviously, I'm glad they were able to determine a treatment for Connor."
John leaned his head against Sherlock's shoulder. "Too bad we can't send a message to the future to get a ride home."
He hand wrote the longer message on paper and put it in the box to rest with all the other potential.
Alexis did not cry until they were back on board ship and in their quarters, and even then they held back tears until they poured some wine onto a potted plant as a sacrifice.
It came free. She flipped it on and jabbed again. There was a sizzle of burned flesh. Acheron fell to the ground dead.
John's little monologue to Tomalak is my little nod to ST:TOS "Enterprise Incident", as much the lines are cribbed from Kirk's explanation for how the Enterprise ended up in the Neutral Zone, as well as Tomalak's own excuses in STNG "The Enemy" about navigational failures.
That none of the omegas who had had sex wish Sherlock had resumed their estrus cycle was evocative. That they'd all expressed feelings of improved health. But Mollyhoo was a scientist. They had been sterilized. This was not their first winter or the first time they'd taken their lives in their hands having sex with the alphas. There was ample proof that none of them were reproductively active after Sarpedon's doctors had done their work.
John was at loose ends for the first time in his adult life. He had nowhere he needed to be. It felt like all the sorrow in the universe pooled in his veins. Almost thirty years old and going through adolescence.
"Fuck this," said John. "This is wrong and you know it or you'd be talking with more conviction than a limp noodle. Or is this how Augment… what do you call yourselves Augment Superiors, is this how you get all your spouses. Buncha Sabine brides."
"Agreed," said Apollo. "But not her," said Apollo pointing at Donovan. "She is not welcome. She reminds me of the one who,"
She would have responded, but Gomtuu sang in her mind. A friend. An ally. A home that was really real. A place to be the Ice Queen.
He should have identified that their current reproductive difficulty was a possible concern earlier. He should have done something to prevent it.
"So, was I," said Sisko. "My wife died in that battle leaving me raise our son without his mother. And now I'm hearing that we could have prevented not only her death, but saved the lives of over eleven thousand brave Starfleet officers."
John showed them around the ship. His mother nervously flitted with conversation. His father quiet and serious. Like always. They ran into Lucy and Eva. Mum cooed and looked significantly at John. His father looked like he always had. Taking a moment to show Eva a slight of hand magic trick that had her wide eyed with awe.
"You're a bi-product of an experiment," said Killander, and wasn't that just a lovely way of eliminating John's humanity.
"You survived this long. Made pots. Flaked stone knives. That thing where you're using that cave with the cliff opening as a wind chilled refrigerator is dead brilliant." He looked at the far end of the valley. "Speaking of which," he looked meaningfully at Mollyhoo, "Sherlock's back."
"Like a dog," said Chin Singh. "Run away from home." An insult. A polite fiction. "There is nothing wrong with my ship. You may follow if you wish." She told herself no one was following the clues she'd left and girded herself for the duties of home.
Mycroft got up and dull and boring things, and it didn't matter. John was smiling at him. It didn't even matter when Garak sat down next to Mycroft, and Sherlock was not looking in that direction.
"That's," said Mollyhoo raising a candle cup… "I… the hunting I understand. But heating this pool with volcanic rocks warmed in a… that's the pot we use for smoking meat… that means that means that you're still capable of complex reasoning. Future planning, but the time dilations neuro inhibitor effects should prevent that."
They reached the valley floor. Sherlock didn't stop. He raced towards the music. Towards the light, which divided. Shattered. Spreading out in a long line of brightly lit doorways.
Sherlock returned with a pot of the soup generally left bubbling by the entry fire. He looked like he'd been rolling in the dirt and possibly shit. There were tufts of wool stuck to his arms.
John had sent information for possible drug therapies as soon as his research reached that point, but the progression from getting the information to testing to human trials had been agonizing. The first two treatments had been failures. In the end, John had found the cure analyzing genetics from every member of his family descended from Anthea cross referenced with Connor and Billy's DNA.
"What's wrong is that an intruder has taken over my body," said Sherlock pitching his voice. "And given he didn't bother to analyze the purity of the organic components from the wreckage, that should be obvious to an idiot."
There was a high pitched beeping noise. John grabbed his hand. "Sherlock, we've got to go." He pulled him forward. They were approximately one hundred meters away when the fusion unit exploded, lifting them off their feet and throwing them another thirty meters forward.
Mollyhoo was glad she was past her initial nausea as she prepped the things for the stew pot. When they arrived back, Marida threw up in a clay pot, which set three of the other omegas off. They drank the blue unishaps milk afterwards, which really was high in all sorts of nutrients.
Billy watched his grandfather watch Connor bounce happily around the living room as if he hadn't tried to throw a chair through the window trying to get out. He watched his grandfather when Connor asked, "When can I start school again. I know became really behind and I want to catch up." There hadn't been time to start school after they'd arrived. Had been taking a break to get to know each other and then biology happened. "There were only a few kids on the Bakerstreet. Are there lots of children at the schools here? Do you think they'll like me?
But her questioner, persistent as a child could be, remained. Their gaze reminded her of something, but she could not quite place what or who it was. She tried to imagine what Donovan or Watson would do, but found nothing. Instead, there was the bloom of a thought. She pulled out the tricorder and scanned the bin. She held it in front of the child. "See. Worms. They're consuming the refuse and producing compost."
"You're supposed to monitor both sides of the perimeter at all times." She angrily slapped the control that she damn well knew should show her the external monitors. Most of it was dull as fuck. But the north east quadrant was littered with bodies. None of whom were wearing breathers or face masks.
Billy held his shaking son in his arms and said to Chin, "I want you to call the Bakerstreet and have John beam down. He kissed his son's head. "Doctor Watson can fix the Horta and it'll all be fine."
John growled, as if to say Sherlock shouldn't keep John waiting. Sherlock came closer. Closer. Closer. He crouched down. John rolled them both over. Sherlock could easily have struggled free, but he didn't want to. Not with John made of wet heat and rich scent. His mate above him, fierce and alive and lit by moonlight.
As Sherlock left, John followed him out. The panel was still leaning against the wall outside his door. He said, "I don't want to hear your deductions. Not this time." Sherlock made a slight gesture to his jaw line on both sides. Then again by his nose.
A pine tree's rough bark scratching at his back. Silk pushed aside. Willingly. Joyfully. Sherlock needed John. Needed nothing so much as him.
John did the first thing he could think of. He lied. Loudly. Grandly and somewhat nauseously. "It's true. Please, you can't tell anyone. It's just, there was this very wealthy merchant when we made port on Maralonia. And he offered me ten bars of gold pressed latinum if I would gestate his children. Ten bars for nine months work. If you can call it working. Sitting around. No danger of dying at all." He waved his hand palm down in front of his chest. "I haven't told my father. I don't want to cut him in on the money. I thought I could conceal my condition."
Sisko's brow wrinkled. He looked down. "Hey, there, Eva." His tone changing in that way humans so often did when confronted with evidence of their fellow Human's reproductive success. "She's grown so much in the last few months."
Sebastian didn't understand immediately, but when Culverton explained what some of the symbols meant, he had to ask, "Is this real? This…"
The Breen directed them out of the chamber into a long corridor with many doors. As entered the corridor, another Breen in black armor scanned them.
Killander going to be on board ship with them. They could not afford for him to have an extra tool to use against them.
He stared. Surprised. In a sudden jolt, he found himself back in his own body. Bound and with a gag in his mouth.
Admittedly, John's mum was only vaguely Anglican, but he was fairly certain that was not on, but not really his problem right then. White acid filled his stomach at the idea that he'd had children and memories were like a bunch of fish in a barrel. Squirting away as he tried to grab them. A flutter of sensation. Some sort of orgy. Sherlock's head bobbing as he fellated John, almost hidden by the curve of John's belly by firelight. He swallowed. "I… we… abandoned our children in the past?"
Strangely it was Donovan, never one for small talk, who opened up on a range of issues. It would seem that she'd been to Elba II before as a raw crewman, third grade, before her first post had gotten trapped in a time loop. "Crazy sort of place. Fucking sort of resort where they've got mass murderers and fucking psychos playing farmer John," here she gave John a look, "braiding each other's hair, while every move they make is watched at the top of the dome over the whole thing."
John blurted. "Breen are Augments, but this makes no sense. She mentioned silver rings. That's not even a point of evolution. It's a cultural thing. An Earth Human Augment cultural thing. A twenty-first century cultural thing."
Sarabeth raised her spear even higher. "Then they can't stay. It's only a matter of time before they turn on us. Before he turns on us." Sherlock was interested to note that many of them had woven small rings out of felt: brown, white, and a mix. A useless affectation to indicate gender and relationship status given the size of the community.
"I'm not a whore!" Sherlock whispered, even managing a single perfect tear that glimmered as it fell. "I'm a free citizen of…" he jerked his chin out of John's hand and mumbled, "Crete."
"With all due respect, Admiral, but while those were quick to build, they were poorly designed and under engineered," said LaForge, whose tone reflected that he'd spent the last decade on a Galaxy class ship, before being transferred to Starfleet Command as part of the current shuffle.
While Sherlock's Mum, Brittanus, was wearing a crystal ring. It was green or blue or gold. John tried to remember what all the colors meant, but came up with all of the above.
Second Father tapped her fingers along the tight curves of her leather trousers. "The Breen do revere their ancestors, which we now know means us. Perhaps," she crossed her arms, "there is the still the issue of the Alignments self-induced problem. There's advantage to be gained there."
So not the same timeline. They hadn’t lost their ability to think until months later in the past and their clothes would have been far worse for wear if they'd been in the past long.
Billy with Connor, Gendel, and Chin in tow had also attended, and John ought to get out of bed. For some insane reason he'd arranged to meet Billy for breakfast instead of later. Much later so he could spend a few hours snuggling in bed with Sherlock.
Terellhoo said calmly, unruffled as they always were, "I was merely going to relate the parable of the crèche that trusted in fate when their life support failed rather than making their own using the help of the Ferengi, the Klingons, or another crèche."
"Perhaps, I will kill you instead," said Lurin, "while the captain is forced to watch while all he has built is destroyed."
Three years before, a raiding party of Fenisal had burned the fields in the next valley. They'd always known there was the beginnings of a good sized Fenisal empire to the south. Now they knew when that empire expanded north. The alignments had voted. Each matriarch speaking for her family. It wasn't as if there weren't fragmented Fenisal city states in the farther north. Some had wanted to head to the South continent. Largely uninhabited, but in the end they'd voted to stay. For now.
By the time his parasites reached the size of sesame seeds in the fifth week, they'd start competing for resources. Given he was the resource, that wasn't good.
"Arrest this man," said Wilkes, who had actually replicated a podium to stand behind. "He's a dangerous criminal. I have reason to believe that he's responsible for the deaths of fifteen archeologists on Camus II."
"Let him finish," Connor said, putting his hand over Fenrir's. She stared at him. He pulled back his hand suddenly worried that he'd done something wrong. She sniffed her hand. Which had him tucking his hands under his arms uncomfortably.
John heard the shrieks first. Ferengi ran into the room clutching their ears just ahead of a purple cloud of dust. As they approached their shuttle, John and Julian turned on the portable force fields, creating a triangle around them in the middle of the room.
"As I said, we are coming to that conclusion." Grandfather paused. "There has been so much occurring this last year, I hesitated to tell you, but the Khans have decided to discontinue our purchase of our grandchildren from third parties."
Ten days, which put an interesting spin on heats, and provided an explanation why he'd gotten pregnant the time they were separated on planet Mafia. John had gone into heat, but had been nowhere near Sherlock. He'd spent most of the time fending off hooligans with a tommy gun, and making the perhaps unfortunate decision to fuck himself with what looked like a turkey baster. The baster must have caused an ovum to release, which had been caught by a dreadnaught.
As he went by, Henryba and Sawyersa were on their knees, exposing their necks. A waste of their time. He already knew they'd submitted to him and John. Still he cuffed Henryba's head affectionately, before heading back to John, who was stroking himself while watching Sherlock lazily.
Billy said, quite honestly, "I don't know anything." His only hope was that when he broke down, they'd believe him because they'd had to work at it.
"But…" John stopped, once again reframing what he knew. Again. Again. Again. "I thought he had surgery to change his face so he wouldn't be recognized."
Sherlock pretended to rub his wrists as they removed his shackles. Primarily, he wanted to palm the small device they were using to remove his shackles. He'd need it if he was going to modify the children's tricorder.
Killander went a few rounds going on about his father. Then went on about Harry's murderers. It was like going through an emotional meat grinder.
His father stood up, quietly. Nodding as if this all made sense. "And so the play catches the conscience of the king. Let not Polonius nor Ophelia die. Kill Claudius even if he is at prayer. Who is to say if it is false or true."
John lay against Sherlock thinking. He looked at Sherlock, who said slowly, "Mollyhoo sad. Sarabeth sad. Sarpeidon hurt. I fix." Then even more softly. "Love you." John felt a surge of love for Sherlock and knew he was right. There was only one way to heal the others. Fix what had been done to them.
There had been the poison in the food from the replicator unit. Again, long past training had informed Finney what to do if he'd ingested an unknown element in his food.
Washington gave the humanoid his food bars, while John focused on guiding Sherlock's body into the cave.
Sherlock took off at a run. John almost sprinted after him, but Sherlock could take care of himself. He reminded himself that he had ample evidence of that over the years.
Even to the point of cancelling his next assignation with Mycroft and never getting to hear what lie-truth Mycroft would have told him. Which was everyone's loss.
But it did mean he was awake when Killander stormed onto the bridge demanding, "What's the meaning of this?"
John wondered what it said about them that he didn't have a problem with the idea. He waved his fork at Sherlock. "I'm not turning into a teen again."
Mycroft was droning at her about something. He'd built walls in his head since she'd last seen him. He'd gotten old. Older. She'd remained the same. Frozen.
"I don't think so," said Sherljo standing up and shading her eyes. "I… Mother, they look like Breenava. But we didn't send out a foraging party and the herders aren't due back from the eastern slopes for at least two weeks."
He didn't turn it in to Donovan. He unpacked every item of his and Connor's few possessions in their rooms, which smelled like ozone and lilacs.
"Children," said Bihr looking down at one of the stains in question with a bemused expression. Bihr lifted her chin. "If we can't find anything on the bridge, I'm going to keep looking." She let out a long sigh. "Children. I can't believe I didn't document that."
John had to give the order to pull back from the front line because there was no way – Sherlock would have found a way - the shields could withstand more blasts.
She tried to explain. She even told him the truth. Victor's last thought before the bad horrible sound. "Victor's the one who injured your pet. An old cataract knife to the tendons." Sherlock was screaming inside and so utterly silent outside. "It was Victor's fault."
The ship lurched, which really wasn't the reaction he'd expected. Tricorders generally didn't do that when he blew them up. Still, no time to think as they went through the doors and into the smoky bridge. Billy slammed the medkit into the head of the night shift pilot, just as John registered what was on the ship's main monitor.
The climb back up the ladder felt infinite. The hatch that she'd come through was locked. If Bihr hadn't had her full tool belt that might have been an issue. Might. She rebooted the door into safe mode, which caused the electronic lock to open.
The soft sweet center that that the story man had told her was there was crumbling and falling apart.
High above, John could hear a chilling sound. Somewhere a panel had been lost on the air handling units. The pressurized air inside the dome was escaping through that panel.
Cafa, one of the guards, who John got the impression was some sort of cousin to Daimon Lurin, said, "There is no profit in this Lady of the Flowers story. Why tell it?"
"You wanna suck arse," said, John wasn't sure which kid had said it, but there was a shoving match among the kids.
He also had to wonder what would happen if word got out. It was bound to eventually. What if beings thought all Augments had that special something in their blood?
Eva ate her breakfast of algae cereal without enthusiasm. Eva saved her food credits all week for replicated meals on the weekend with her mom.
The pleasure of a body that functioned the way it was supposed to without the aches and pains gained by years of exactly this sort of activity.
John's attention drifted to the rest of the audience. Everyone was focused on what was on stage. Except Sherlock, halfway round the room, he was watching John.
Maybe it was when they realized that they had two siblings that hadn't survived gestation. Not to mention the ones Mum lost before she had them.
John knew what he meant. His dad had had an accident. Years ago. Not long after he met Mom. Got banged up pretty badly. He'd had to have surgery, which was why it was ridiculous for Sholto to have claimed to have recognized his father. He couldn't have looked the same.
No sooner did his alpha release him, did he demand more. Always more. On his knees, forehead resting in the earth as his alpha thrust wetly inside him. On his back gazing up at twin moons and starlit sky. A slow moving light marking the Bakerstreet. Vague thought swept away as his alpha woke from his nap at Sherlock's nuzzling. By his strong and steady alpha release inside of him. Teeth safely clamping the skin of Sherlock's neck. Legs wrapped around his alpha to ensure he would never leave. The knot the promise it was true.
"Now the Sugar Daddy got so absent minded with jealousy that he flipped the red switch. The one he wasn't supposed to flip while his Sugar Baby was around. That naughty Sugar Baby got hot."
Sherlock growled and pushed himself up, but Sarabeth clutched his arm. "Please. John, don't let him go down there. I need him here."
John held on to the sound of Sherlock's voice. The feeling of his arms. His scent. Held onto the sound as another wave crashed around him. As Sherlock lowered him into warm water. After crushing weight, he floated.
Julian's face transformed into a soft smile. It was fascinating, given that he was nothing but light and algorithms. "Yeah, we are."
"We don't know who we are either," he said. "We woke up and couldn't remember. But… you called the kid Connor. How do you know Connor's name."
Thil had forgotten his gift for his grandparents and had fretted about it to the point of fighting with his twin until Sh'Alaack promised to go back to get it.
Bihr wondered if this was home. She had considered it so for last several years. Here in her quarters that Khel had changed to their tastes. A piece of Andor when Andor itself had not felt like home.
"Ah," smiled Apollo. All smiles now that Alexis had reassured him. "Of course, those kinds of questions are only natural. I am a god in that I have the power of life and death." He held up his hand and a tiny sun appeared to glow there. "I am immortal as far as you would understand it. My kind came to your world long ago and taught your ancestors many things. In return, we feasted on your love." Another drowning kiss. "It has been so long since I tasted the love and worship of your people, I am starved for it." He consumed further kisses from Alexis' lips. "Better than any ambrosia."
"But it would be very dangerous to stop treatment before getting the full round of medicine. I'm a doctor. I know that sort of thing." What John knew was that Sherlock's cock was going to feel amazing. It was going to fix everything if he could just get it inside of him.
His primary clue was the intrusion detection system (IDS) that had not alerted when a line of code had been uploaded onto the server for the cafeteria replicators. The code itself was nothing unique. A commonly used algorithm meant to take advantage of systems where the Admin password had not been changed from the default value. Since the cafeteria servers were within the internal and completely unsegmented network, whoever had access to one system had had complete access to the entire network from the moment John and Donovan arrived.
"That was pregnant. Now they're birthing. The babies need to come out someplace warm and free of alpha musth and that's as good as we've got. Go."
He glared, because she could not be this dense. "The one with the best access to observe Doctor Watson's parents, who are staying in his room."
"No fucking shit, Holmes," said Donovan. "The only way that you would leave a search for Watson to someone else was if you were dead or not you. And I'm not really discounting the dead part."
"Oh, dear," said Martha. She sent him the logs anyway and then asked in her most comfortable sweater tone of voice. "I don't get to hear about the old office as much as I used to. Is Tom Veaker still in charge of area seven assignments?"
"He wanted to know," said Sherlock, who moved closer. Took his hand. John could feel Sherlock's hand. That was something.
Killander stood up. "But your Assignment Officer can give you the details." He left and a very harried looking woman came in.
John sent his genius off to find the computer. If a building hadn’t just fallen on Sherlock, he might have realized why John wanted him away.
"Yes, but," Lucy brushed her hand in Eva's hair. "I've been talking to Ms. Hudson and I need you and the other kids to be big kids and give up some of your toys."
Dad looked at Sherlock with a sort of melancholy smile. John sat next to him. "Hey, Dad are you okay?" He didn't ask if he'd been with Mum all day. He didn't ask a question he didn't want the answer to. That he simply could not believe had even occurred to him.
The bridge was all John. Given he almost always showed up with some form of silicone inserted in his anal or vaginal tracts. So that was more on John. Sherlock knew it wasn't a test. He wasn't failing when he pulled whichever plug it was out only to take its place, holding John against the view port or bending him over Sherlock's desk.
Watson indicated that the single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs, provided in the study proposal were de-identified from the genetics of four Augments of British decent. There were only three Augments of British decent on the Bakerstreet. Sherlock Holmes,John Watson and Owen Tregennis.
"Yeah, and I do. Anyway, John may love him, but Sherlock looks like a whole lot of work. But," she stared at the monitor with its peaceful planet and ships, "you've given me something to think about."
Finally Sherlock slid him back down to the ground. Bodies still pressing against each other. "You kept them. You wanted to keep them."
Sherlock jumped into the climb. He could hear Finney laughing all the way up to the second level and even after he burst through the hand operated latch into the cool blue corridor and came face to face with the mural of a massive hound.
Sherlock leaned halfway back over his chair. He asked the ceiling, "When was the last time you did an audit of Khan's cryo chamber?" Dull to have to follow Mycroft's advice.
Sherlock went to his workroom, the location of so many wonderful moments being inspired by his John, and tried to select the right weapons to kill every guard surrounding Victorious. And the weapon that would allow him to die if he failed.
Lucy put her hand on John's arm and sniffed significantly. "You need to be careful what you expose yourself to. What if," she lowered her voice, "it hurts the baby."
Sherlock leaned closer. Scented John's neck. The vanilla cedar smoke of Sherlock's scent had John's heart racing. "Fine." Sherlock bit out. "But the clothes stay on."
"Lay off, Macduff," said Harry, and for a moment, just the briefest moment, he remembered what it had been like when they were just kids then he heard Sh'Alaack shifting next to him, and remembered.
John laughed, suddenly feeling lighter. "I could use a party." He shot Donovan a look. "But maybe have Khatri arrange it."
Not that either of them failed to charm the crew and attending children when the Watsons troop put on a short comedy play in the cargo bay.
"Did Chin suggest this location? Or did you?" Connor's expression said he'd be like a dog with a bone if Billy gave the real answer.
"No, I'm John Watson," said the other Watson, but she no longer believed her. She felt a certain lightness. Relief at being able to sort out who was the killer and who was her friend.
Billy looked out at the blue waves crashing in on the white sand. At the crew of the Bakerstreet chatting and laughing by a giant bonfire. Connor was waving his hands wildly and talking to his bemused looking great-grandfather.
The daimon said, "Take the adult omega to Profit's Aspiration and the Andorian down to the planet. We'll keep the children here as leverage in case our new employees get…" he gave a snaggle toothed grin, "ideas."
"Sorry sir," squeaked John. "I don't know what's come over me." Even John could scent his own pheromones blooming out of him at the sensations.
Admiral Th'Azetron smiled genially. "Your brother mentioned that you would be coming into Starfleet headquarters today to receive your new orders. It was a good thing too. There was some sort of snafu with your orders," he rolled his eyes, "a miscommunication no doubt related to so many personnel being processed this year, but I had my aides cut you some more suitable orders. Your brother mentioned that you would prefer to be assigned to the Bakerstreet with a promotion to full captain, of course. But if you'd prefer a different assignment, the Reliant has not yet been assigned a new captain."
"The ethics around studying medical studies involving children is always tricky." Julian's expression was calm. "Given Augment history, most Augmented parents won't participate in studies even now."
Sherlock sighed grabbed one of the creature's legs and pulled. Since John knew very well how strong Sherlock was, he left his brilliant husband to do the heavy lifting while he kept an eye for other predators. Given her lack of the same level of strength, plus the lack of vasopressin 1b receptor gene seemed to indicate that maybe Mollyhoo was a regular Augment like himself. He really hoped this wasn't where Augments unrelated to the various Khans' followers had been sent by the Breen.
Uterine replicators being a term borrowed from the science fiction of Lois McMaster Bujold to skip coming up with a name for a mechanical uterus.
It was brilliant. John's scent and heartbeat and expression all indicated his focus was on what they were doing.
"They broke up the company. Took a job doing Tellarite dinner theater on Rigos so they could be near the school. Looking back, I think my parents may have almost broken up over it. They argued all the time about it. Course, Harry, my twin, thought I was just trying to get attention. We were close before that, but after… we haven't really spoken much."
"Doctor Watson is Mum's thirteen times nephew," giggled Connor. "Which isn't really all that related. Not really. You can't keep people here just because they've got some distant relationship with you. You can't. You need to let them go!"
Connor thought of the way his mummy had stood kept trying to get to him when then Colonel Green's men threatened to kill him. He thought about Ms. Hebron shouting. That was when he knew.
How John had raged and cried that he wanted to be more than just a broodmare when the marks on his neck turned red again. Had only ever faded to a sort of pink. When Sherlock realized what the change in John's scent meant and had gotten on the floor so John could kick him. Walk on him with sharp heels. Whatever he wanted. As long as he forgave Sherlock.
Finally, they came into a wide open chamber full of fascinating bioluminescent rock formations. He was about to explain that to Connor, when Connor pointed. There were two of the creatures in a large shallow hollow in the room. One creature was far larger. Its surface was cracked and pitted, charred in some places, as if it had been subjected to an explosion. Perhaps the one the shop keeper had described. The other was much smaller. Only half the first creature's mass. It had a red pulsing wound where Sestre's father and Ms. Hebron had shot it.
He learned this by dint of trial, error, and a growing number of holo cubes. Although, he did confirm that if he had sex with Sherlock after fertilization – the time they were trapped by Plato's psychotic and psychic Step children – at least he didn't go through the cramps from hell when Sherlock's tiny spawn attached themselves to him.
She removed the gag from Sherlock's mouth. He spat out the lint and said, "Britannus' blood does amazing thing. Bloody Hands, Redbeard, and Yellowbeard."
Billy said faintly, blood pounding in his ears. "Self-defense class from Donovan." He wrapped his arms around Connor. Kissed the top of his head. "We'll keep each other safe. Yeah."
"Vesha, you know better than to get so far from the others." Marida gathered up the scattered fruit into Vesha's basket in quick, angry movements, glancing repeatedly in the direction the alpha had gone. "Always go out with at least two others. Or did you want them to drag you off like Petervin or Mavisoff?"
An omega, who worked in craft services, was from Beta Aurigae, and had logged into her account while Sherlock had been arguing with the Andorian detective. So, not just an organization that could field operatives, but one that had operatives already in place in major Federation population centers.
"with my parents when they visited me in the… place where I grew up. They appeared to be there willingly, but they could have carefully screened individuals before allowing them to visit where I was kept."
"Ah, but have you met any?" said Sherlock. Decades in Starfleet had left him with many stories to tell. He wasn't John, to spin a story whole cloth, overly dramatize events, and completely leave out all the relevant facts, but he could suitably alter his own history.
"So you say, but there is a break in both the brig and sickbay logs for the time you were in the past. How unfortunate for you that the logs documenting your nerve damage and your psychologically induced limp were copied to Starfleet central."
"Then I must enjoy their blessing while I can." John pushed back Sherlock's hair. "And enjoy Venus revealed." Sherlock blushed.
Dread pooled in John's stomach. He riffled through possible explanations. Alien civilization with mysterious monolith. Energy anomaly. If the last few months hadn't been spent patrolling with a side trip to DS9, maybe. But even if he'd known Killander was waiting for him, the level modifications to ship's logs, perjury was… fuck it. John tossed the stylus back at Killander, who was less adept at catching it. As he fumbled for it, John said, "Must be some latent healing. Didn't want to report it without having a chance to properly study it."
After Sherlock grumbled and shivered, which was John knew was because he didn't want to get up. He blinked sadly at John and shivered again. John splashed him, but laughed and pushed himself up over the side. Used the wide flat tool to pick up another rock warming in the fire and drop it in the water. It steamed and hissed as it sank.
The rest of the omegas were scientific crew, but they had all, in theory, taken yearly combat effectiveness training. "I'll need the rest of you to take of the engine room."
"My apologies, I was wrong," said Bashir. He smiled at Odo. "Do you think he'll admit Section 31 exists?"
He left Julian to haul the Ferengi onto biobeds and give them enough sedation to keep them under. John headed for the nearest Jeffries tube. When he reached the shuttlebay, he commed Hudson, "In first position."
"No," said Euros pulling out the word. He had to wonder if she was searching the minds of the people around them.
That he would only clean with his tongue and lips. His husband spent what remained of the night with his head resting between John's thighs. Licking and sucking on John's cock while working a dildo – the large ridged red one or the small blue one with the clitoral and anal antennae or the pronged green one – named the Klingon, the Andorian and the Vulcan respectively – inside John. Until John couldn't have said which sensation was the one that made him come.
"It's locked," said Protector regaining the sour tone to her voice. "We have actually tried to figure out what's going on."
"Oh, you know how it is. Accidents happen. Backup instruments aren't calibrated. We were supposed to in for maintenance months ago. Now we're here having this conversation."
Sherlock went through multiple rounds of questioning. His interest in science. His curiosity. His very self was at question. Sherlock would soon wear a groove from pacing the floor in the security office.
Killander laid the stylus next to the tablet. "There are two possible explanations. You were rewarded for your complicity with Soon Lin Yao by being given access to Khan and his followers."
Letrade was prepared for that and pushed the updated specs for the Bakerstreet to LaForge. "Implement the improvements that Captain Holmes added to the Bakerstreet."
Finally, he said, "No. She changed me, but you all changed me." He looked up for a brief glance. "You gave me curiosity. I've never thanked you, so thanks. Doctor Bashir's template gave me optimism. My lead programmer gave me sarcasm." He touched a wall of sickbay beneath a camera. The actual method Julian was seeing Sherlock. That and all the sensors laced in the walls around the room. "My full designation is EMH Program AK-1 Diagnostic and Surgical Subroutine Omega-323. The majority of holographic doctors on being turned on asked to be called EMH, Doctor, or Mark. I'm a Mark II. But the tech who installed me is the reason I asked to be called Julian. She thought it was better than being named for what version I am."
Ms. Melusine said, "Now, Connor, if it's alright, I'd like to switch to our history module this afternoon. You can tell the class about your experiences with Colonel Green. Perhaps some of the other Augments you met at that time."
"Obviously she is not," said Sherlock. "If you paid attention, you'd realize that some form of disease afflicted the figure from before and this girl. They're both Humans at different stages of the disease."
"Mummy, as you might imagine, was very upset that there had been a hole in security that allowed Sherlock to escape, but," Mycroft sighed that weary, annoying, older brother sigh, that had plagued her all her life. "If he could not escape, then he could not have saved you, and based on my analysis of events, his partner could not have saved Sherlock. Mummy was too blind to see that the palace was… not a healthy place for him. The only way through all of this was if…" he smiled sourly, "he were out of our control. We have to trust," another sour twist, "he'll come back."
John walked until he couldn't. He wandered in circles until he came to the place that he'd been looking for.
"Excellent resale value," said the other Ferengi grinning over his disrupter. "Especially two adult omegas and one adolescent. The others are barely worth anything but mine labor, but Augments always get top latinum from this particular buyer. These days there's no point in selling to anyone else. Disgusting biology, but worth the effort."
Sherlock observed the cadence to the way she talked. He did not ask her to repeat the words he'd once asked John to say to identify his accent.
Billy tapped the small monitor on one of the controls panels and tried to hail the Bakerstreet, but there was no response. They changed the display on the monitor and couldn't find it. It wasn't there. His relief at rescue crashed around him in white noise.
The world felt small in his mother's apartment. He knew that logically this was not correct. It was larger than his quarters on the Bakerstreet.
"Go!" Mollyhoo held up the cannon and a candle. "I'll stay here and shoot anyone who tries to get past Toby and me."
That she would not only not receive a similar courtesy when an agent would be boarding her ship was insulting. But even worse was that the only reason she had any warning at all was Garak had had sent her an amusing video of a cat toying with a mouse when sending her a message listing some of her sartorial options for the next time she visited DS9.
"Hey, there. Easy." John resumed carding his fingers through Sherlock's hair. Sherlock melted into his touch. Time, if that was an accurate term given the location, passed.
"Yes," admitted Mum. "You're right. Because if I'd touched Chin and brought her scent with me when I visited you, it would have made things harder for you."
Finney cackled a laugh. "Adams. Makes no sense. No sense at all." He leaned forward with a yellow toothed smile. "I was the one who turned the power on when he was alone with his infernal machine. Saw him trying to use it on some kid fresh in Starfleet. A Crewman third class. No more than eighteen. Not one of us inmates." Finney's gaze grew fierce. "He died of a broken heart with no one to tell him what to think. Tried to break our hearts so I gave him a piece of what it felt like." He cackled grimly.
"Oh, not entirely deleted. Some data was retained," said Hudson, completely oblivious to how the words would affect Lucy. "There was this was this one mission where I was given… well, let's not tell stories out of school." She smiled. Oblivious to how close Lucy was to screaming.
By mid-day, Sarabeth's scent signaled that she'd gone into heat again following the loss of her kits. Mollyhoo whispered frantically, "It's postpartum estrus. Baby, tell me what you want?"
"Why he made a little Shakespeare reference in response to mine, very droll. So droll. This way," Frankland headed for the door. They made their way through a series of hallways and curving ramps. There were a number of patients in pale green, blue, and purple scrubs walking in the opposite direction. "Ah, I see you've noticed our color coding system. My own idea. To indicate our guests readiness to move on to the next phase in the sylvan resort – to use your compatriot's words – above. I developed it after I perfected grandfather's design of the neural neutralizer. He worked at this facility as well. Well, worked. I mean he designed the facility and ran it. Such a tragedy that his life was cut short. In the prime of his life. So much left to do. Well, we carry on his work in a small way. But we have big dreams. Such big dreams. As you're a doctor yourself, I'll name drop a bit. Doctor Adams. Perhaps you've heard of him."
Oh, he'd indulged himself for several rounds of going back in time and killing every member of Sherlock's family who had hurt them. Gotten in their way. But who wouldn't do that given the chance. Since each murder had resulted in timelines where the Borg destroyed the Khanate, timelines where Sherlock and John were confined by Mycroft to a prison on Elba II, or the intolerable one where Sherlock had been bred with John's twin, Harry, to produce what the Khans had promised the Breen. At least the Guardian showed John a sort of black cloud of butterflies following Sherlock in that dimension.
Connor gave a watery smile. "I just." He rubbed at the snot running from his nose, before awkwardly wiping the mucus onto his hospital bed. "It's just…" His smile was watery. Beautiful. Rational. Sweet. "I feel like me again. I can think again."
"I had every confidence in Yarhuse." Really, she was an amazing pilot and clearly more than a little bit of an adrenaline junky. Took one to know one. John ran for the lift. "Stamford, get anyone else beamed aboard and pull back. You have command."
Sherlock did not need a hologram to tell him the obvious. He'd been there through the surgery. He was also well aware of the required dexterity levels for Starfleet doctors.
"Not exactly." He flipped his stolen tool in his hand and opened the computer's case. "The less said, the less revealed."
"Benjamin, as you may remember, our ship has more Augments than um… most," said Lucy, peeking from behind the other crew members, pushing her stroller with a sleepy Eva in it. "Not that I want to push a family connection, but, well, you're a parent. You know."
"Yeah, an odd duck trio, your mum in particular, but," he pressed down with his foot to let Sherlock know it was fine, "they did at least one thing right. You."
"An aggressive immune system that attacks foreign cellular material and heightened healing," said John.
The V1RL87 gene is one that humans share with rodents that detects pheromones. There is such a thing as a vomeronasal organ. That said, the gene could be inactive in humans. The organ is vestigial. In Augments, it's active. Because SCIENCE! And genetic engineering. Course, there's more than one gene associated with pheromone reception, but nothing brings out the flow of a story like a long list of letters and numbers.
Sherlock scoffed. "Don't insult my intelligence. You've ordered every Augment in the fleet to report to a Starbase. I've learned through outside sources that there are orders to question any Augment, who has been a member of Starfleet and has left the service. Not only do you not have a specific suspect, but you don't have a specific timeframe for when the cryo chambers were liberated of their cargo." His words came faster and faster. "If you had a suspect, you'd only be questioning those personnel who were in the general proximity to that base. Also, you have no concept of a motive other than vague genetic solidarity, or you wouldn't be requiring that Doctor Bashir be brought into custody given his augmentation is entirely unrelated to the original experiments." He drew himself up to his full height and arched an eyebrow. "That's enough to go on for now I should think."
Really, the most likely thing was that like the Romulans, the Breen would sit out the conflict and move in to take on the weakened victor. But Elim did appreciate that Mycroft was making an effort at some artistry to his lies.
Sherlock shouted and the massive alpha turned. He saw Marymor's smile as she rubbed against Vesha, reinforcing her scent in the presence of so many alphas. Not stupid. She was counting on Sherlock and the lead alpha killing each other, or at least injuring each other. Marymor casually kicked another pot of grease into the flames, which shot higher.
Which to remind everyone is how Sherlock's brain works. Because Euros. Because brain damage. So both he and John are basically now teens. Well, John just got all the hormones dumped on him at once, which is why his emotions are so out of wack.  Um... science...
Who was John to deny that? The sun grew closer to the horizon. Really time in ancient Pompeii didn't move like normal time. Plenty of time to stretch Sherlock's sphincter muscles with the smallest of the wooden dildos, while teasing his labia with the larger. Size was lovely and all, but knowing where Sherlock's prostate and graffenberg spots were was better. John had Sherlock coming before he'd made it to the largest dildo, and after that, he rolled Sherlock over to enthusiastically enjoy another round of making a two backed beast. All the better because John could see how happy Sherlock was.
John did have to keep his mum from asking Billy a thousand questions about their ancestress, Anthea.
John felt horrible, but he pressed on with, "Yeah, I actually meant um… Christ this awkward. It's just I haven't wanted to talk to you because I know what you went through with Colonel Green, but Augments don't have a lot of records on why our augmentations present certain ways." He shrugged. "Too much mixing from the original strain." He held up his hands. "I'm not saying now, but if you're ever ready to let me take a look at your DNA, you might be able to help augments know a bit more about ourselves. Understand some of the problems we have, medically speaking." It hadn't been his first reason for wanting to ask, but when John had thought of it, the reasoning actually made sense.
Sherlock prepared for his first acknowledged encounter with John. He reviewed his charts and studies about every desire that John had ever evinced any interest in. Because there was considerably more at stake now that John knew that Sherlock was Sherlock.
He didn't realize that he'd been crying until Sherlock and John, naked and looking a bit like Robinson Caruso towards the end of his time on the island, tumbled out of the Atavachron's energy field. They fell to the tiled floor and vomited.
Sherlock face did that sort of soft eyed melty thing that John was not going to respond to. "That's," Sherlock cleared his throat, "not my fault."
"Eggs," said Connor. "You've been taking away their babies." He darted from under his mum's arm and grabbed the egg from the miner's hands. He rolled it to the largest Horta. "Here you go."
As they emerged from the shuttlepod onto the Bakerstreet, four tiny figures flung themselves at Sh'Alaack. Clinging limpet like to her legs. "Mama Bihr!" The two younger children were sobbing. One of the older ones was wiping tears from his little blue cheeks. Bright white hair sticking up in all directions.
Sisko scraped his fork on his plate. "I'm not letting any of you go anywhere without someone advocating for you. I'm sure there are some additional repairs that would require the Defiant to get a once over at the Utopia Planitia shipyards, and she's four times faster than the shuttle Killander arrived in."
He smiled at the study and said, "Got you!" At the ass end of space where he was currently buried, there were no other officers to hear him speak aloud. No one to hear him shout, "Yes!" when he ran analysis of the genetic information from the cryo chambers.
As it was, he'd only been able to work on one device in the hopes that John would return. That he could finally fix things after so many broken promises.
Would John be like Lucy and still have time for research? Would he be like Sh'Alaack and have space for exploration? Medicine? Last, but certainly not least hours just for cuddles with Sherlock in a warm bed? He wondered if it would have been easier if he and Sherlock had had kids, not thirteen, but maybe one or two, maybe after the polywater incident, if that would have been easier. Not something to decide to do, just caught by circumstance and go.
They'd had variations of this conversation a few times, which was fine. But still, John was glad that the Bakerstreet was nearby.
Stamford had been a mildly forgettable lay back in the day, but he was a damn good XO. John's bridge crew was rounded out by his second officer, Commander Norburton, who'd come out of retirement to run security. Fresh from the academy, Ensign Parsons on nav, and Crewman Yarhuse on the helm.
She might have ended her forty year career teaching at the academy scouting for fresh – read young – talent as an adjunct agent, but she had done those things.
He moved the box to his office desk in sickbay, which had its own dangers of exposure, but Sherlock was completely uninterested in John's desk, having separated medicine as John's problem. The box somewhat took over the lowest drawer.
Speaking of mammary tissue, John's was tender. His nipples felt painfully sensitive against the fabric of shirt. Actually, all his skin itched and tingled. As if an electrical current sparked over his skin. His bones ached. He felt restless, needing something. Wanting to pace. Rub his back against the wall to ease the ache in his back. His labial tissue felt full, engorged with blood. His cock was semi hard. He had a low grade fever.
Chin straightened in a posture that reminded him achingly of First Father. "Perhaps you thought I was dead, but I survived the Feradon attack and the fall into the crevice. For years, I thought you were dead. Our parents lied to me. I only learned when I went on the run of the ancestors, and your name was not among the fallen. But by then you'd already left the home our parents created for you and I had no idea where you'd gone until much later."
But the brown eyed Breen kept talking. "Just because Sarpeidon," inspiring several rude gestures, "believed it doesn't mean it isn't true." They turned to John. "I am Terellhoo of the 22
John took a step towards his twin. Gone was the long hair that she had started growing out when she'd decided to shift her gender identity to female, a year after their gender party. In its place was a short cut that looked remarkably like the one that John saw every morning in the holo mirror.
He drew in a breath. Massive fans spun in air handling units on a snowy planetary surface. Filtering the air. Warming it. Removing residual radiation.
He was able to open a connection with Donovan. Just about. Static and all. "Sh'Alaack has a plan to get us back," he whispered loudly into the communicator.
The apartment had an excellent view of the town center. The transport facility that led up the New Gol shipyards, which were experiencing a boom. Vulcans from all over New Vulcan coming to work in the shipyards, which had been converted from civilian ship production to support building ships for Starfleet. It was understood that Vulcans couldn't join Starfleet, not with so few of them left, but they could provide ships.
A small fire burned near the entrance. Both for warmth and a deterrent to predators given its placement.
John had his own question, "Chin, why did you come onboard the Bakerstreet? It wasn't to kill Khan. He'd been free for… forty years before you showed up."
Mummy had told him it was all his own fault he had lost his pet for not taking good care of him when he begged Mummy to bring John back when Mummy came to tell him the news about Tertius. Had coldly told Sherlock to be logical and face the fact that John would already be pregnant again if Mummy had left him there with Sherlock.
Many of them had bred with Marymor. He watched the way she looked at the one or two she hadn't bred with. He and John would have to keep a watchful eye on her after the omegas gave birth.
Doctor Imprid had said, "Would that our ancestors had thought to treat the symptoms rather than eliminating the cause."
John did not laugh at the question. It wasn't funny and Lucy had made different choices than he had. "For now, let's focus on getting us out of here. Yeah."
Sherlock froze immediately after. Eyes carefully watching John, who sighed. "We are very bad at not having sex."
They made their face be stone. "I am not your love. I am not your anything. I don't love you. I just met you." Alexis stood up. "You're an entity pretending to be a god."
He was genuinely curious. Two people. Raised in the same environment. Seeking in different ways to differentiate themselves. With such wildly divergent ideas about how to solve the question of serving the needs of the many or the one.
"Uh," said Hunter, which was about how John felt given the main point of a report of an attack by a silicone based lifeform was the silicone based lifeform.
A voice boomed over the coms. "Welcome, my Terran children. You've left behind wine dark seas to sail the stars as I was certain you would. Where I have waited for you."
Billy looked up at the star map. "Okay, let's research some more about the planet together. Show me that city map again."
Whatever Sherlock got from that, he nodded. John stayed and helped Mollyhoo try to stop the bleeding. There was much more blood than with the others, but then Sarabeth had been farther along. Not much farther, but farther.
She and Freddy discussed it. He was being transferred to be the chief of Security on the Cortez with a promotion as a commissioned officer, Lieutenant. It was a good promotion. Better for his career than stagnating on the Bakerstreet had ever been. Not that either of them regretted the Bakerstreet's unstable stability.
"Maybe that's why they're having so much sex," said Marida. "I just thought they were…" he shrugged, "it had something to do with the time dilation. But maybe Sherlock's… I don't know… keeping him healthy with his magic cock."
Instead he said, "I saw how the shop owner operated his storage unit. It contains its own battery power."
"In that I have not yet beamed down to the planet, no." Sherlock braced himself for a stream of pointers that he should have picked up from the recordings and chemical analysis of the tunnels. Failures in his abilities. Proof that Mycroft was always the superior of the two of them, but it didn't come.
"I'll remind you that I had to escape a Breen holding cell this morning, which was not easy," said Hudson. "Although, it certainly became easier when your grandfather sent word I should be released and given a shuttle. And just think, we know so much more now than we did a few days ago. So, as unpleasant as the trip was, it was certainly worth it. Now," she tapped her chin, "if only I knew what these old Augments were up to with the Breen."
"Please, don't take my child from me," said Billy. Every ounce of fear Lucy was feeling just then in his voice.
Told himself every damn data cube was a promise that he was going to see Sherlock again. Pulled up his chin, put back his shoulders, and got to it.
"Sir, please. Let me please you." Sherlock's narrow chest was moving rapidly. His eyes wide and silvery.
Both she and Sun were questioned extensively about their interest in the sciences. Since it would seem that Killander thought that would particularly cause an Augment to break into a secure facility or join Augment dissidents, which he had offered no proof as to their existence beyond ranting about a significant rise in the disappearances of omegas in the last three decades.
The creatures conferred again, before several of them explained in a good deal of detail why they had spent many years planning and expending vast resources to free Brittanus from their cryogenic prison. They even provided a gift. A vial of blood, which they had obtained not long after Brittanus left Earth.
He felt proud that his mate had chosen him again. His mate's scent enriching wonderfully. Painfully. Driving Sherlock on to answer his mate's commands.
Memories further back, conversations heard and unexamined with Connor the focus of his whole attention yielded much the same results. Whispered conversations the Breen perhaps did not realize he had the augmented hearing to hear. They were Breen. No one in the 23rd Alignment would have made that mistake. If Grandfather had been there, could have been there, he'd have told them to be quiet.
Under different circumstances, John might have asked Sh'Alaack what kind of modifications the engineering team had made to the shuttles to make the chairs easy to remove. Under different circumstances he might have chatted about what items had been replicated on the Bakerstreet and how many had come from Starbase 280, or explained what an infra-sensory drug even was.
"Is that why didn't have any more children when you were unfrozen. Or did you miss mother and my aunts and uncles too much?" asked Billy. Feeling exposed to have asked the question. Wanting to retreat.
The Hippocrates wasn't much to look at. It had been a Y-500 freighter in a previous life. It had minimal attack capabilities – mostly good for pot shots at pirates. All its power went into its massive engines. Shields. Some set aside for holo-generators for one hour bursts for up to twenty holographic doctors with no long term memory capacity, and rows of biobeds lined up in three of the former cargo holds. Although, to John's mind, the one hold converted into a morgue said how Starfleet really expected the upcoming battles to go.
He also got to absorb, what Sherlock said next. "As you know I can't remember my early childhood. I don't recall ever being touched as a preteen. Teen." John couldn't resist a stroke of Sherlock's hip at that statement. "Every morning, I would wake at four. Swim in the river the flowed beneath the… place where I lived. It was set to ten degrees Celsius. Run for ten miles. Study during my waking hours. My parents or my brother would periodically check in on my progress. There were… call them servants who watched me. Monitored me."
John looked around them. "What is this place?" He examined a candle, which had mostly burned down to the stanchion. "Where are the inhabitants? Someone had to have lit these."
"That one cause a lot of discussion for millennium," said Veema. "Sarpeidon designed the Atavachron based on the image to mock us and our beliefs."
John thought furiously. "The only reason you'd care about proof is if you've got your own black mark on your record. Section 31 not happy at the level of exposure they got? I don't think you have the authority to make anything disappear."
"What the buggery fuck is going on?" asked John in a tone reasonable for someone who'd been stunned twice and run through the ringer once in the last few days.
Yao was correct. The burden of proof was being put upon them to prove that something had not occurred. Difficult, if not impossible under the circumstances.
The daimon shrugged. "He's not too young for us to sell his indentured papers, and," he put a hand over his heart, "perhaps we can sell your indenture together."
Harry said, "Don't fuck with my childhood!" She slammed Lethe's head against the wall again. "Memories. Gender. Orientation. Just,"
Connor frowned. "I'm pretty sure all you're supposed to be is you. According to Grandfather, they need kids and teens here."
Harry turned to look at him and smiled sadly. "I have to go to her. She is my sister. The one who always stood by me. She stood by me when everything came out about dad. She visits me all the time."
John leaned against Sherlock's lovely warm lovely side. Told the room. "Get Donovan and Sh'Alaack what they need." John hoped Sh'Alaack had a plan to get out of this mad universe. Also, that Sherlock knew what he was doing.
Sestre turned his attention to Connor. "What made you roll the rock towards the creature? How did you know that would cause it to leave? Your answer to Captain Holmes was very vague."
Admittedly, while John had been away, Sherlock had also enjoyed torturing Victor Hatherley. He was aware, he was not an idiot, why John had selected that particular individual as the vehicle by which he left the palace. Why he'd had sex with him. John only did that when he really wanted to upset Sherlock.
"Then its fine," said Euros. She wrinkled her face and crawled backwards into the belly of the beast.
Their lips brushed together. Softly at first. The omega slid their tongue inside his mouth. He did the same tasting the omega. Delicious. It made him long for more. Tongues swirling against each other. Mouths parting only to shift and find each other again. Breathe growing rapidly harsh. His heart pounding. The omega's hands already finding their way inside the silky robe to slide it wonderfully back over the skin of his upper chest. The omega pushed the robe back to let it fall to the ground.
When he arrived back at the cottage in Cornwall, Sherlock wasn't back yet. He went into the sun room to have a think.
One of his cameras spotted a woman – Kara – supplied the remotely stored dataset – who said, "Good, Controller."
There was a rattle at the door below. Sherlock looked out the window overlooking the main square. Parked in the center was the shuttle, which was certainly not where it had been when it landed.
"Ah, revenge." Stonn spread his fingers in a Vulcan greeting. "Sh'Alaack, the Maquis sent me. I am your contact." Bihr's brief relief was countered by the thought that for the other her to be worth a resistance group sending an operative, there must be something they wanted from that other her.
"Yeah, there'll be a first time." Then since John was about to say the most hated words in any relationship, that they needed to talk, he put the collar on Sherlock's neck. Stretched out his neck to have Sherlock do the same.
He found himself wanting what he hadn't on the Bakerstreet. Needing it. He bent his head up and kissed Sherlock. Searchingly. Aching. Longing to feel something good.
As it happened, the Horta were a good deal nicer than John would have been and agreed to allow the colonists to stay on planet provided that they stayed above a certain strata of the world.
"You need to know that… thirteen months ago, I started automatically backing up medical logs. Certain key data points to offsite storage." Sherlock looked up to meet the hologram's gaze. "People had been tampering with my data records." Julian's expression was grim. "All I am is my memories. My program."
Sherlock blinked water clumped lashes. He looked very young for a moment. Sherlock nodded. "Yes. I… as long as John… yes. Help." Ducked his head under the water. Looked at John with shiny eyes. Bright as candles. "Babies." He quickly kissed John's cheek and hid his face in John's neck for an embarrassed nuzzle.
She still had her spectrum calibrator in her hand. A cylindrical device that she jabbed up into his throat. Not hard enough to do damage to him or the device, but enough to make him take a step back. Unfortunately, not enough to make him stop. His hands closed around her neck, cutting off her air. "You took peace away!"
Harry whispered, "Ashes, ashes. They all fall down," as grey figures crumpled to the ground in the dim light. High above them, air continued to howl out of the dome.
His thoughts ran in hysterical little circles like Zyan snow weasels on a wheel. This could not be happening.
She gave him a droll look. "Try inmate. Sorry, long term guest. As I understand Finney was due to be released half a century ago, but his daughter had died, grandchildren were getting on themselves and didn't know him. He stayed in the only place he knows. Not that uncommon truth be told. But there's nothing he doesn't know about both Baskerville and Tantalus." She shrugged. "A bit before my time, but he was a... guest back when Adams ran Tantalus. But it's time for the pièce de résistance, your new office." She turned a corner into what he could only describe as a closet with a desk jammed into it.
He'd long since deduced that the Analyst in John's family folklore had been the first Mycroft. A remote connection thirteen generations and three hundred years removed from Sherlock. When Sherlock had been a child, he'd met Grendel, Billy and Anthea's Augment progenitor, who was also one of the other three Augments to carry the gene for juvenile heat. An alpha carrier could still pass it on. He cursed himself for not doing more than a cursory genetic analysis to determine the distance between his and John's genetics. For not delving more into what Augments in the Federation knew about their own genetics. He'd been more interested in exo-biology than his own.
Sherlock was screaming inside. Victor's skin was warm and soft under his fingers. His hair thick and smooth. He wasn't breathing.
Billy braced himself to take the blow as the Klingon raised his hand, but Connor darted between them. "Please. There is no honor in beating a captive. My mother is in love. That's all. He wanted to contact his lover to let her know that he hadn't abandoned her. Love makes us all foolish."
Two Ferengi ships sending a signal that the ship should surrender or be destroyed. No ship's registry.
Section 31 was not monolithic. The right hand not only did not know what the left hand was doing, the cybernetic arms were completely out of the loop, and don't get Martha started on the tentacles.
John cleared his throat. "I guess, I've never asked about your tattoo. Why the monster and the flower?"
Every part of him ached. He rubbed his back against the wall. Against a rubber ball. That didn't ease that ache either. He'd forgotten how he used to soak through his pants with vaginal emissions. Wanking didn't work to relieve him. He came. It just didn't help to relieve the ache. He was too hot. He was alone in his quarters. Their quarters.
"Stockholm syndrome," mused John. He looked at Sherlock. "Holmes syndrome. Not sure how we report this. If we report that the Khans are running around, at this point, all I'm certain we'll get is more dicks like Killander coming out of the woodwork, or," he waved in the general direction of the bridge, "fucking tits like this Wilkes character. Fact is, Normal Human's can be as fucked up as they want, but one Khan is proof we're all out to murder everyone."
"No," said John, flushing a brilliant red. "You should go directly to the bridge. I'll be fine. I am a doctor. I know how to dispense a pill." His heart was beating rapidly. But as with everything since John had reappeared as a teenager, that could mean anything. His tells wildly varying based on every new emotional spike.
"The profit is how I get paid by adults to entertain and occupy their children's time," said John absently, before remembering that it was something that his father used to say when Ferengi asked him the same question. Glory for Klingons. Position for Romulans. Profit for Ferengi.
Sherlock positioned the butcher's knife over the curved half of a yellow onion. Slowly pushed down and there was the heavy thunk of the blade hitting a freshly replicated cutting board. John would bet the steel blade of the replicated blade was razor sharp too.
John mouthed the words along with Beatrice as he always did, "O that I were a man for his sake! or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake! But manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving."
Finally John sat up and picked up the fallen tablet. "And the Sugar Daddy gave the naughty Sugar Baby a big fat knot that made him cry out, 'Oh, Daddy,' as his Daddy filled him with medicine. But the naughty Sugar Baby wasn't cured. Oh, no." John licked his lips. "He needed a full round of injections."
"I can't help you with who, but this is the USS Bakerstreet. A Starfleet Pegasus Chimera." The blue person held up the tablet. "I woke up in the engine room holding this. I think my name is Bihr Sh'Alaack, if this is my tablet. It contains many pages of documentation and a complete set of schematics. I've been using it to explore. I've made it to Sickbay, which was empty, and this level." Bihr smiled and a dimple appeared on their right cheek. "Don't worry. I left a copy of the documentation with the other two people who were down there. There's was quite a lot of instructions on what not to do."
"Bailing out a crew member on a drunk and disorderly." Donovan's expression was sour. Whoever it was would not have an easy time when the Security Chief reached them.
John swayed forward and got a little shake of the head from Lethe. "Uh, uh. I'm afraid I can't afford to take the time to fill you with happiness and peace."
"I would protest that that a brother doesn't need a reason to contact his little brother, but I was curious to see if you've made any progress on determining the cause of the equipment failure on Janus VI."
Had needed John from the moment that Dionysus first transformed him. From the moment the Dionysian festival had begun.
They'd both put on gold rings for their Gender Reveal party. They'd played the same roles on stage. Switching out for each other. When they weren't doing children's versions of Shakespearean twin confusion. Real twins. Not just two eggs, but a single egg splitting into multiples as a result of the treatments mum had gotten to be able to have them.
"It's your bed, but I've slept here a lot recently." Another kiss. "I think I just get the same uniform over and over. That's why I have no clothes. I keep a book my father gave me when I left home to join the military. It's precious. The pages have been looked at. They are well loved. That's not something you leave in a lover's quarters. A mistress. A concubine." Another kiss. "Maybe I work long hours. That's why I haven't slept here all the time. Maybe we're newlyweds, given we've had sex twice in the last," he twisted to look at the chrono on the wall, "hour and a half."
Something in her didn't so much soften, as pile other things on top of it. "You were helpful the last couple of weeks." They kept walking. When they reached the bridge, she asked the computer how to close the doors to the shuttlebay and run a continuous message that any move to break out of the force field would result in the shuttlebay being vented into space.
They shook their heads, eyes growing wider. She could see Sh'Alaack listening to Harry. Harry kept going. "Well, I'm your evil fairy godmother. I was supposed to give you gifts when you were born so you'd know how to get your revenge me when the time was right, but it's not too late. I'm going to start giving you gifts now. So you'll be ready."
Sally shrugged. "I didn't want my message," and wasn't this just playing without a fucking net, "to be intercepted."
An unpleasant task. He went to meet his brother in an observation lounge in the Armstrong dome of the Lunar colony.
Sherlock didn't resist kissing John to distract him. Sliding one hand down to lift up John's tunic, causing Julian to yelp and disappear, while Sherlock gripped the spongy folds of skin around John's cock that were already firming with the tissues where a knot would form.
was hidden. She had the modifications to her face removed. She told herself that needed to be done first.
Sky Father, for that was his name, though to the Greeks he was Patḗr Zeus, followed Ganymede's ember. Shooting as a star from the horse loving plain where the towers of Ilium no longer touched the sky.
He continued to work his way through the ship. There were a couple of people with minor injuries. One broken leg, which he set in sickbay.
Sherlock looked around him. The mountains looming over the valley, the ice cliffs, everything was strangely familiar. As if in a dream.
Washington reached into a pouch and pulled out an energy bar. At John's look, he said, "I have a five year old, I always have snacks." He peeled it open and handed it to the man. "Yummy food, and more when you take us to the bringers of pain and delight."
Years away from old prejudices, and with an alpha child of her own, she could see the same spark in Sherlock's eyes.
Fortunately, the cavalry arrived in the form of Donovan. She said, "I found the fucking missing pump in Gremel's quarters." She grimaced. "Right where Holmes said it would be. Lower your weapon. I haven't gotten to shoot anyone today, and my finger is getting fucking itchy."
"I should say that my step-mother says that. As I recently found out that she's not my birth mother."
The intermission bell rang and John did not hold Sherlock's hand through the final act of the play, when love went from silly laughter to deadly serious. As they got to his favorite scene, he leaned forward watching Beatrice and Benedick realize the seriousness of their love.
John wanted to say that he was ready. He wanted to speak. But he didn't. He bit his lower lip and held all words at bay.
The next morning Sherlock was ordered to report to the station security office. He did not go to his memory palace to think.
Perhaps this time around she could avoid recruitment into a secret government agency. Although, it had been quite a lot of fun.
Instead of going into heat, she experienced horrific cramps. Then the part where the past was made of tiny organisms trying to disrupt her intestinal tract took over. She became extremely nauseous. No diarrhea thankfully, but plenty out the other end.
No one had ever described her parents like that. The aching part of that thought was she had no idea where to put the thought.
"Yeah," John looked down at his hands. Found himself sitting in the chair opposite Harry. "Yeah, we were. Until I went away to school."
He did wonder if he got a desk job, if it would be anything like DS9. But probably not. More likely a larger base with a full complement of medical staff.
"Who?" said Connor, which was how he learned a very, very, very different version of the Lady of the Flowers story than the one John told. It featured Aunt Anthea and the Analyst, whose real name was Mycroft, but it mostly focused on the role played by Ti-Lia, a Breen augment, who had volunteered to go to Earth to save Augment kind to maximize the chances that the Breen race would come to exist."
Sherlock was aware that John did not wish to know more about the events on Taurus IV. It may as well have been written in lights over his head.
John went inside. The arch of what once had been a grand lobby was packed wall to wall with beds and people. Telarites. Caitian. Bolians. Races from all over the Federation. Fewer Andorians than he would have thought what with this being their planet.
Stonn wanted to call security. Billy wanted Connor back and in his arms and getting a severe talking to, and for security to stay far away. "I know someone else we can ask for help."
John didn't have long to wonder how a bunch of children snuck in and took everything, giving Donovan a nasty head wound, and trapping Sherlock for the necessary few minutes in a crumbling building.
"It's only been a few weeks," said Hudson. "I know you're concerned about her, but this will be good for her."
Sherlock was not fooled. He bared his teeth to let her know he saw through her plan to be taken into the cave, and be fed and fucked.
He went to the space port near the academy. More specifically, he went to a bar. He saw cadets. They looked young. He tried to figure out how they had gotten so young. He wasn't that old.
He'd thought himself such an adult. Now he understood just how young he'd been. The nature of the pressure Mummy had placed on him. That reminder that caring was not an advantage.
Jake fussed over Eva. Lucy and Eva were cousins on his mother's side. Eva claimed to remember Jake, and told him a story with Flopsy. It took up much of the conversation until Lucy took Eva off to bed, and Jake went to sleep.
The twins put their heads together as they tried to remember the name of the planet and made some suggestions. Mr. Shroleb said, "That's not quite it. Remember I showed you vids of it last week."
"You're not going without me," said John. Firmly. Stoically. With that little lift to his chin that made Sherlock's heart stop a beat.
Doctor Frankland himself was waiting with some Humans in guard uniforms and others in blue scrubs, and an Orion female. Her pheromones were a faint echo of burnt apples, but then John was an omega. Alphas tended to react to Orion pheromones differently, which made John was just as glad wasn't added to the joy that was this adventure.
alignment. He grinned and took the stories that they'd just been told and made even better ones. He said, "I'm Redbeard, the dread pirate. The first to navigate the splinter asteroid field in five parsecs."
"Why's it called Twins, Papa Ishros?" asked his little sister, Shrilaas, even though she perfectly well knew. They all knew. Ugh.
John grinned slowly. "I love the sound of the word please in your mouth." He twisted his hand in the collar. "It pleases me to give in to your request. But remember, you can't touch yourself. Only I'm allowed to touch you."
He almost blacked out at the sensation when John's knot was finally captured inside him. His cock's head brushing all the way up to his cervix and rubbing everything in between.
Like Sherlock was most likely at least somewhat pregnant, which fine, John rolled his eyes at his own thought. There was no such thing as somewhat pregnant, but John had spent a lot of time looking at Sherlock's DNA recently. He knew Sherlock had the same genetic trait for high order magnitude pregnancies.
As Bihr was shen, her spiritual element was water. Her gender represented blood and the connection between generations. Her parents had not bled when they'd died. Burned to ash, there would never be a funeral mask or cubes containing memories of them for the clan. Many in her clan had been reduced to dust. Those that had not starved.
The lights were left on full lumens, which was against the Khitomer Accords, but what was one more war crime for a covert organization.
"As a representative of Internal Affairs, I have to tell you that Starfleet is very concerned about the psychosomatic limp. Then there's the," he looked down at the tablet, "social anxiety resulting in hypersexualized behavior at the academy." He told himself not to respond, "Your nearly catatonic response to your father's death," he nearly exploded at that. "Subsequent violent responses to authority figures." John told himself that hitting Killander would only feel better momentarily. "Starships are such small communities. Starfleet takes the mental health of their crew very seriously. However, you are a potentially valuable resource. I have enough authority to put you on inactive status. If your memory improves, you can go back on active status."
Victor sighed. "You say that as if I don't care about my brother. I'd really hate to have to kill him. It would be like the rest of our family all over again."
John arranged Sherlock how he wanted him, which was exactly how Sherlock wanted to be. On his knees in front of John. Beneath John as John pushed the head of his cock into Sherlock's backside. Stretching him. Filling him. Moving slick with animal fat. Pushing Sherlock forward into Mollyhoo's soft heat.
"I want to become a black hole that swallows other black holes until there's nothing left." He pulled out a silky handkerchief and blew his nose. "She doubts that I can be a Gentil Parfait Knight. I want to show her that I can, but," he waved a hand, "I'm worried about black butterflies."
