“It’s not slavery, it’s property,” Lord Woodley argued.
Ireni took her hand. “I promise,” she said sincerely. “No matter how many you have.”
just wanted to be mayor of their little village
“Then why…” Holmes struggled to articulate what he meant. “We have new worry lines, but we do not worry as much. And that is correct, but I worry…I worry deeply about the consequences of this love, John. Why do I appear less anxious?”
It wasn’t really Mycroft, Sherlock’s older brother, general stick-in-the-mud and awkward dinner conversationalist that came in, though. This was the Duke of London, and one of his people—his youngest subject, in fact—had been taken. He was furious.
Mindful of the dire threats Kitty had made if Rachel got wind of certain ones of their adventures, Watson kept it light, describing some of their more madcap adventures. Holmes chimed in every once in a while, mostly to correct timelines. “My dear Watson, I dressed as the old woman
But it wasn't either child. It was two men holding hands, both who looked oddly familiar. They reminded Sherlock of—oh.
“Why are we here?”
“I’m sorry, love.” John actually looked tired. “But it really is the quickest way through, and I’ll protect you.”
“Just give her back, and we will not harm you,” Grezzik promised.
Now there were definitely people staring. John swallowed and lowered his gaze. "Of course you'll get bored of me."
Holmes picked up his phone. Sherlock had shown him how to use one. John had downloaded Angry Birds for him. Watson had given him an earful for that one.
“My dear Watson, all I am good for is thinking.”
“Me?”
Suffice it to say that Sherlock and John stood with their families in late April on a sunny day. The best men were present, having put in long hours with the grooms to make sure that all four of them could take the day off without London (or the world) exploding. Mrs. Hudson was there, beaming brightly in her role as mother of the groom. Mike was officiating and had been there since dawn practicing with Molly’s help. The good wishes of those who couldn’t be with them were also there in recorded video messages from New Scotland Yard, Afghanistan and a small cottage near the east coast, where two very grumpy people were too ill to attend their son’s wedding—a recording was set up for their benefit.
“Must have been a trick of the light.” Ireni chuckled.
Sherlock watched as Molly entered Gruner's house as Mrs. Ford, a secret manga enthusiast. He was desperately worried for her, but he knew that Molly could hold her own. She'd always been very capable of making people underestimate her.
Holmes kissed him for a long moment, longer than they ever could have in London. When they broke apart Holmes' eyes seemed darker than usual. He helped Watson to his feet. "Do you want to try now? I...I don't wish to lose my nerve."
Kitty, on the other hand, knew full well that the Inspector hated Katy Perry (oh, how John wished now that he hadn't let that slip), and started singing her latest song at the top of her lungs.
John nodded. “Thank you for answering my questions at last.”
"You told me that you desired me when we first...came together. That we oughtn't do anything about it, because the risk was too great, but you wanted me to know that if we could have been safe, that you would want to."
Watson takes a bullet for Holmes not long before they retire. Holmes was apoplectic, but Watson was secretly glad; now his leg has reason to twinge in the cold weather, and he still has his husband to distract him from the pain with soft music.
“Aren’t you concerned about the types that usually wander the night?”
“So…” Ireni looked around. “I’m glad we all know each other, but did you say
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock kissed him. “As good an argument as any. Shall we begin?”
The crowd began to disperse as Greg and Dimmock came up.
“Who did all of this?” Watson asked.
“I’ve missed you.”
“I know he is,” Moran said. “I don’t care.”
John grinned. “I do. And I’m not telling you. I’m going to surprise you somehow.”
“Is it painful or something?”
“What does that mean for our countries’ relations?” Janine asked.
Sherlock and John stared at Anderson.
"Really?! Is it like when Daddy's a policeman? What's it like?"
"Better to go now, don't you think?" Donovan asked soothingly. "He's cruellest to those who disappoint him. you've seen that. Don't let him find out those things on his own. Make some excuse. I can help you find a cheap flat if you like—"
"Think of the child," he urged her. "Think of your husband."
With the police force so new, any help was welcome, particularly help that did not demand credit or compensation. Thus, when Sherlock Holmes requested to consult on cases, he needed no help from Mycroft Holmes; which, coincidentally, meant that Lestrade didn’t encounter the older Holmes until Holmes and Watson were married.
“We’ve got a playlist for the rest of the night that Myc and Molly and I sorted out, but interestingly enough the first dance was chosen by both John and Sherlock.” Lestrade grinned at Sherlock’s shock. “You two should have known better.” He hit play.
“What have you done?”
Next week is the first multi-part story, which shares a certain...theme, shall we say? with this one. Thanks for reading!
Sherlock’s mouth tightened. “That may have been a factor.”
“So thirty-nine, right? That’s not so bad.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Right.” Sherlock put the last moonblossom in his hair and followed Molly to the garden.
The man in black kept moving forward.
Sadly, the end of days was closer than they thought.
“Long enough for both of us to heal,” Molly said, gesturing between herself and John.
“Oh.”
“He doesn’t know that Sally’s mother is dead, then."
“I’m not afraid. Are you?”
“Mycroft. Enough of this lord business, my name is Mycroft.”
“No, love, I don’t want to stay here longer than we have to. We’ll be on my ship very soon, and all our troubles will be over.”
“No.”
“And I don’t like Jamiarty,” Sukiv growled. “It’s good to see there was a reason.”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows as he searched John's face intently. "You...you don't actually believe that, do you?"
John considered him for a moment. “You saved my life,” he said hoarsely, “I think you can call me John.”
"Anyways, no, that's not my problem." Kitty closed her eyes, her face drawn quiet again. "My friend is in trouble."
John cleared his throat. “Sherlock, I can offer you only my promise to be your partner in all our life together, whether we are hunting criminals or cleaning the bookcases. I love you…more than words can say.” He put Holmes’ ring on, voice thick with tears.
Sally was napping, and Grezzik had taken Waverly out to the gardens. The little girl loved being outside. Grezzik would sit with her in the middle of the grass and listen to her babble intently. He’d talk to her sometimes too, because she was an excellent listener, all big eyes and curls. He would tell her stories about his parents, about the beautiful places he’d seen on his travels, and even his worries about his place in London.
Somehow, that was worse.
Ireni did. “It’s nice stuff, you know. From America.”
“The man who saved you? James? No, that wasn’t Mycroft.” Sherlock closed his eyes, memories of the little boy he’d left behind, just as Mycroft had once left him. He hadn’t thought about him in years. “That was someone else.”
Dimmock gulped. “Alright. But you—if Jamiarty—”
Mycroft raised his hands. “As the captain of this vessel the
“How are you feeling now?” John asked.
That was the only reason Molly hadn’t stabbed him yet.
"Okay. And you want to get out? We can help with that."
“To be great, one has to be terrible.” For a second Mycroft’s face hardened, and Grezzik saw a power, a force he’d never known. It spoke of searching, of scratching remorselessly away at reality until it gave up its secrets. Then it was gone, and in its place was a tired man.
“It’s a bit of a long story—” John stopped as a popping noise began.
“And now?”
sake, I know what it is.”
“My spy network’s heard nothing of the sort, my Prince. Are you sure?”
“Why not? I cannot give what other men can give so easily—entertainment, kindness, affection. All I have to offer is my brain, so is it really so awful that I ask the world to give me more to think about?”
“Well, I don’t exactly want the baby. I want to demand the baby, them to refuse, and then we invade.” Jamiarty cocked his head. “But I take your point. Moran, how long has it been since you were there?”
Count Magnussen clubbed him before he could say another word.
“It's what we want to happen.”
Kitty’s text, filled with expletives that made John raise his eyebrows, came early the next morning. He debated about showing Sherlock, but decided that could wait. He put his phone down again and nestled back against his husband.
Sherlock laughed. ‘You would check that.”
Her father squeezed back. “I’m alright, Sally. I just…the evil of that…”
Greg grinned at John. “Absolutely. Though you might have to put up with me shouting at the television. The sheer amount of shoddy police work…”
Moriarty giggled. "Oh, the big guns aren't here. Well, one of them's...somewhere around here, telling you exactly where would be cheating. There's one near Scotland Yard as well, and one just across from your flat. Big is a relative term, but I'd say they're guns you need to worry about."
“Need isn’t always the same as want, Molly. Is there anything you want?” Ireni’s eyes were serious. “I do want to give you something, you know. And we are going into battle tonight.”
It was a fairly ordinary day when it happened. Watson had worked in the garden most of the morning, weeding his rosebushes and watering all the wildflowers that Holmes was careful (after the first disastrous time) to not call weeds themselves. Holmes had puttered around his beehives for a while, making exclamations that Watson hadn't fully understood. The afternoon was spent walking in to the village together and getting the post, walking home and reading Billy's letters (he insisted on writing to both his grandfathers, even though they were often the exact same letter) and Kitty's latest article about women's rights. Stan had even sent a postcard from Paris, on a work trip to the Sureté to learn about new policing techniques.
“We’ll be back together before you know it,” Molly finished. She kissed Janine. “Sweetheart, we’ll come home.”
Holmes and Watson have never had much room for peace and quiet. Retirement changes that.
“Moriarty will want Sherlock to kill himself,” Mycroft continued without remorse. “So Sherlock will, but we will plan a way to save his life. Moriarty will relax his guard allowing my people to arrest him; Sherlock will unravel Moriarty's Web from afar.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Nearly two.”
Stam shook his head and put simple food on a tray. The others were still in the library making diplomatic plans, so he took Seb’s dinner down alone.
"What did I do to deserve this?" he moaned. "What?"
“Then they must know that the child is illegal.”
He’d never been afraid of heights, and his stomach was calm as he tumbled down after the precious bundle. He was focused on one thing alone—getting to Waverly.
Jim might be her friend, but he wasn’t a woman. He couldn’t understand. So she just wouldn’t tell him.
"Wait, we need to go—"
"Our first Christmas together?" Holmes finished. "Never." He swallowed guiltily. "I'm sorry John, I should have explained, I don't know why I didn't."
Sherlock took his hand. It helped.
“Don’t you dare!” he screamed. “You cannot do this!”
The strangers didn’t react, and Watson walked forward, bringing Holmes with them. The strangers advanced as well, but just before they passed each other the shorter stranger stopped and reached out. Watson stopped and watched breathlessly as the hand of a much younger man laid itself on Holmes’ free one, a wedding ring nearly glowing.
“I will.”
John was still pale, still unsteady on his feet. But sixteen hours of sleep and his grandparent’s healing techniques had given him some colour in his cheeks and he walked on his own. He smiled at Sherlock, a bouquet of moonblossoms in his hand, his grandparents and Grezzik behind him.
And there you have it! Happy ending, everyone's going home...
Sally flinched. “But Waverly—”
Grezzik obeyed, and Miracle Max inserted the bellows into John’s mouth and began to pump air into his chest. Maria watched, spellbound, as the man’s chest began to rise.
Compared to the loud, long church service and burial in London, this one was deeply calm and quiet. Stan dug a deep hole on the edge of Watson's garden, the edge that faced the beehives. Together, Kitty and Rachel wrapped the box in one of Watson's scarfs. It was a light box, holding only a journal and a folded piece of faded paper covered in a messy scrawl. The cufflinks were buried with the lovers, but these last reminders of the love they held, the love that never dared to speak its name, were better kept at their sanctuary, so hard won.
"So we need to find them."
By evening their fevers had broken, and Kitty dared to hope that it was over. Lucid now, her fathers were able to sit up in bed, and they even drank some tea.
Kitty and Hopkins have been seeing a great deal of each other in the last few months; they are officially courting.
“The letter, I mean. Jamiarty killed Carla, so he must have written the letter or got someone else to do so, but he doesn’t want to be King. He told me so when he hired me to kidnap Sherlock.”
They were both silent for a second, breathing hard.
John sighed. “Love, if you say that again, I might have to gag you.”
“No.”
Sherlock got to his feet. “Do we have to?”
John laughed. “Yes, indeed. Murray was the third in the line. The real Roberts lives in Patagonia like a king. Anyways, he wanted to pass the title on to me. And I asked him to let me go instead, if he didn’t mind, because I had to get back to you. But he told me with a couple of good raids, I’d have enough money to take you anywhere in the world, and we could travel without care of money. And I thought…well, what was a little more time? I wasn’t worth much to you otherwise.”
And that’s where things changed for the better. People
"Yes," John said, and there was no more doubt, no more worry that he would give in because it was expected of him. Sherlock was ready, and so was he.
Sherlock brought him breakfast in bed for a start. It wasn’t any special day at
No, that couldn’t be it.
Who could say?
“Thank you, Greg,” Sherlock whispered.
Rooftop. St. Bart's. Come and play.—A.
When the door was shut Grezzik walked down the hall. The effort of the day was finally catching up with him, and his arms ached. Clearly he’d gotten out of shape in the last year; he might soon have to begin exercising.
“Because it doesn’t make sense for there to be a hound with glowing eyes,” Sherlock said. He went boneless in John’s arms, nearly bringing them both to the floor, but John held them up. He could be strong enough for them both.
“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.”
“Of course I do!”
Sherlock went back to his typing. “Perhaps it’s money troubles.”
And that’s when the duel really began.
John raised an eyebrow. “Of course we are.”
Cheers,
Stan looked away. "I reckon I'm not what most fathers want for their daughters."
“I know you cannot understand that, because you are a performer in every way,” Watson went on, squeezing Holmes' hands. “And that is wonderful, and I delight in the part I have in bringing you a wider audience. You were made to be remembered, Sherlock Holmes, and I will make it so. But I am not. My deeds are not known to many, at least the ones that do not involve you. I led an unextraordinary life and did my best; there are thousands of men like that. There will be thousands more. And I am satisfied in this. I do not wish for the high honours of my country; they are made for different people. The honours I desire I have already.”
“Lucky you.”
“We might have a way around that,” Ireni said. “Your Grace, where…where is Carla buried?”
Cheers,
"Well then I'll oblige him," John replied. "I'll see you soon, then?"
Three days before the wedding, the Thieves’ Quarters was nearly empty. Most of the thieves went quietly. They knew they’d be out of jail soon, there weren’t enough cells for all of them. That was the whole point of the Thieves’ Quarters.
Kitty nodded, suddenly shy. "Yes, Dr. Hooper."
Molly watched in horror as Jamiarty changed, as he started to fight his chains with vigor, his face stretched in a horrible grimace.
"Good morning!" Grandad John was smiling hugely, and he picked Billy up and swung him onto his knee. "You've got a lot of energy today, Billy. You must have slept better than Holmes!"
“I’m glad you think so,” Grandfather John said. “Come on, then, we’ll get you unpacked, shall we?”
“No,” John said. It wasn’t quite a lie. The group that had taken him was brutal but physical violence wasn’t exactly their
Stan smiled. He looked up at Sherlock, suddenly looking a bit shy. "I've heard...I've read everything on your blog, Dr. Watson. That's why I wanted to be a detective."
“You just moved your fingers!” Grezzik said proudly.
“Yes, although transportation for two will be more difficult.”
Of course, wouldn't they be younger as well?
“We have to go somewhere. And London’s just a start.”
Well. They might as well get it over with.
He stepped forward and grabbed hold of John, yanking him by his bad shoulder towards the edge of the roof. Moriarty peered down; John did as well. There were a few people walking around even this early, and he briefly contemplated calling for help.
They were in bed together, sated and happy. Or at least, John was sated and happy. He had his husband, they had fantastic sex, they had friends and family. Little Waverly had recovered quickly from her difficult birth, and she was the happiest baby John had ever seen. Sally was still recovering herself, and she and Anderson spent many days in the gardens, playing with their little daughter.
John looked at Sherlock in disbelief.
, I hereby pronounced these men married. Any who object are getting thrown overboard immediately.”
It was their neighbour, Andrew Doyle, standing with his husband in the street, staring up at the window in surprise.
The train to Sussex took an interminable amount of time. Watson tried to sleep, but he was too excited, as was Holmes, who kept glaring at the telegraph lines as though they were responsible for their speed.
“Not at all.” Chessa’s teeth gleamed in the torchlight. “We want a safe escort for the new Princess. If there is to be fighting…we will not start it. Is that sufficient.”
He dropped to his knees and placed his hands on the young woman’s shoulders. She was still asleep, her wail getting shriller.
“Your Highness?”
Greg nodded quickly and got up. "I can drive you home."
Greg looked across his desk in disbelief. “You two are getting married?”
Kitty laughed. “And I always hated it when people did that to me, didn’t I?” She ducked her head. “Stan, Uncle John…well, he’s not my uncle. My name’s Kitty Winter.”
“No, my husband’s. Philip.” Suddenly Sally couldn’t wait another moment. “Your Majesty? Could I speak to you alone?”
“Offer me money.”
“We need to confer about Sherlock and John’s wedding song.”
(See the end of the chapter for
She thought Sherlock Holmes was a good man, a good friend to John despite what everyone said, and he’d been nothing less than courteous to her. She was happy to have him in her life.
“Is that part of being supportive?” Sherlock smirked. “Help me, John, I’m clueless about these things.”
"Why are you letting her speak like this, John? You're wasting your time and allowing Donovan to waste her breath, though I suppose the latter's not so terrible..."
). He didn't waste time, just grabbed her and yanked her into an alley.
Molly and Janine’s gift was a beautiful picture Janine painted, with the sun high over a wintery day. It was framed with one of Molly’s beautiful frames, made from silver. Molly made beautiful things from metal—never swords, but almost everything else. Janine was wearing one of her necklaces, and Waverly had a small metal statue of a bird, decorated with red gems.
Billy had a flash of insight. Obviously, he had to prove that he didn’t
"We have all night," John promised.
“We are honest with each other, if not the realm. And it’s none of their business anyways.”
“And I won’t love you.”
"I don't like it either!"
"Oh, you can still have cases," David said. "There's loads of cold cases, and I mean cold, five hundred year old cases you can work on. And of course all the little interests you all have; plenty of time to indulge, plenty of material to find the answers." He winked. "Or Google anything you don't want to take the time to discover, that's utterly up to you."
Sherlock stretched, looking for his clothes. “I think we should go over land,” he suggested. “London is still connected, after all. We just have to cross the bridge. ”
This is likely the darkest chapter I've published, and hopefully it will remain so, but this is an issue I felt needed to be dealt with.
Sherlock had gone very still. “Why bother? You’re the obvious choice.”
And he never did.
His men cheered, and they rode on, following the footprints up the hill.
Grezzik sank into a sort of trance as he concentrated on his bond with the baby girl. Waverly was confused and frightened. She wanted Mama and Papa. She still couldn’t form words, even in her thoughts, but he could feel their faces.
So Sherlock hasn't been eaten by the Eels (like I TOLD you), but there's quite the climb ahead. Meanwhile, the Man in Black encounters a Spaniard who hates waiting, especially to be out of trouble.
“I don’t need much, Mycroft. I just don’t want to be alone.”
Kitty smiled at Stan. "He's the best sort," she answered, kissing Stan's cheek.
Sherlock inclined his head to the judge. “Apologies, Your Honour. As my partner could tell you, I tend to ramble when I am excited. I will stop…showing off.”
“Just because I didn’t know it doesn’t mean those acts weren’t part of him,” Sebastian replied. “I pledged my loyalty. How could I reverse that pledge after he trusted me with his crimes?”
that she would never have this kind of hope.
“Will Sherlock be in control?” John smiled. “If so, I'm not worried. I trust my partner.”
Stan sat next to his wife, doing his best to put his arms around her and their child. “I love you,” he whispered back. “And I love our baby, oh gosh…”
Cheers,
Curious about the rest of the cottage, Billy peered next door. There was a study there; partly for Grandfather John (writing desk), partly for Grandfather Sherlock (music stand and chemical instruments). There was another door that, when opened, proved to lead outside to a small garden. There was only one door left. Billy peeked in. Another large, cheerful bedroom, with…two beds?
“It was the 'Study in Pink' case, and Sherlock came banging in to give us the answer, except he had someone in tow. A rather short, grouchy looking stranger with a cane.” (He tipped a wink at John).  I asked Sherlock who he was. The response I got was ‘he’s with me.’”
“How do you mean?”
I will post another chapter this Friday, and the third will be up Sunday.
“I beg your pardon?”
Molly blinked awake. It was the middle of the night, and she was lying in Janine’s bed, their bodies pressed close together.
“He killed you.”
This one must be different, though. After all, it was the trial of a Prince.
Next chapter there will be some fluff to make up for it!
Jamiarty shook his head sadly. “Too soon, angel. Perhaps tomorrow? It will take at least that long.”
“I’m good with dead. Bring him in.”
It was Grezzik’s quiet voice that broke the silence. The giant was still trembling, but his voice was confident. “She is frightened, but alive. The woman hasn’t hurt her.”
“I will hear Mrs. Hudson if she comes, and quite frankly I don’t care what she thinks.” Holmes’ voice was tense, but Watson could feel his arm trembling. “I can invent some reason—it’s a cold night and you need watching—”
All four of them whirled. Sherlock blinked. There was a man in the room he didn't quite recognize.
Grezzik fell.
“I will do the same for you,” Sherlock interrupted. “Jamiarty had me fooled last time. He won’t again.”
“Far be it from me to deny a woman that,” Ireni sighed. “Come on, Grezzik!” She stomped away.
“What do you want to know?” John snapped. “That I have no living family?”
Exactly what it says in the chapter title bar.
When dawn came Sally was still laboring, and the contractions were no closer together. Martha wasn’t worried. “It’s your first, darling. This is normal. It took me twelve hours to birth John’s father. And that was with every tincture Max could give me.”
“Alright.”
"How will we...what if we interrupt them?" Watson asked. "That might be rude."
In those five years Grezzik had some trouble finding a place in the troupe. He was huge now, and strong without exercise. He tried to play fight, but it didn’t work very well. He couldn’t quite stop when it was time, no matter how hard he tried.
He didn’t want to be late to his second wedding.
He snatched Waverly up into his arms, nearly hidden in his hold. She was safe now. And he looked around, trying to find the source of the fire.
There was time to figure all of this out. The 500
“Sir,” Maria interrupted. “I apologize, but we’re in a rush.”
a pirate?”
He opened his eyes, his lover’s worried face the first thing he saw.
“We’ll be over in an hour or so,” Stan said before he hung up.
The twins, on the other hand, were ecstatic. "Do you know any good dragon games?" Lily asked her. "I like dragons."
“Do not mock me!” Sherlock snarled. “
Carla was the latest of Waverly’s siblings. There were six now—Ellie and Hela and Trevor and John and Molly. The last three had come as babies, so they were given names, but the others were adopted older. Waverly liked all of them, and she was glad that her mother didn't have to be pregnant with all of them. That would have been a long time without her being able to play.
There was no reason for Sherlock to be doing so; the room was well lit, he wasn't currently reading anything at all, and no one was speaking loudly or presenting something far away.
The phone chirped again.
“What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It’s odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid…and is one of the more deadly poisons known to man.”
Mrs. Hudson considers herself the matriarch of her Baker Street Clan. Mrs. Holmes has no objection.
“That’s assuming I live long enough to have more emotions.”
Sally was already running for the palace gates, and Molly was right at her side. The lights were going off, one after the other, and Molly waited for the alarm bells to start ringing.
Cheers,
He looked up to see Sherlock come in and slam the door.
And Watson, of course.
Cheers,
Sherlock didn’t look back.
"Sherlock told you it could wait, now come on!"
Riley stared at them. Her body started to tremble, and Janine was worried that the Veritas drops wouldn’t be enough. But then she relaxed back into her chair.
IT MADE ME SAD TOO.
When they separated, the Queen beamed at her and took her hands. “I am so glad you know at last, Sally. May I hold your child?”
“He’s doing it by trying to claim that Janine stole his property when she took Sally in,” Grezzik said. “Sally is from the Carrier family.”
Seriously though, the name is Winkin the end k thx byyyyyyyyeeeee
“Grezzik, row quickly. I can take Waverly.” Molly tucked the baby into her arms. Waverly cooed up at her, and Molly couldn’t help but smile. Holding this child that wasn’t her own, she wondered if maybe she was ready to be a mother at last. She couldn’t fathom the idea when she was looking for Count Rugen, because she was a failure as a daughter. But Janine wanted kids (and needed them, for the throne)…perhaps they could have a child now.
“She’s technically Extra right now,” Raz answered. His eyes were overbright. “The Crown’s loss, my gain. Please help her.”
And of course a librarian helped them out; I'm two days away from finishing that degree, librarians are powerful!
“Hello Sally,” Molly said. She crawled onto the bed, taking Sally in her arms. “Your little one likes to be early, does he?”
John studied her for a moment. "You're about the same size as a friend of ours. Her name's Molly, and we trust her completely. Would it be alright if I asked her to bring you some clothes?"
For answer, Holmes came closer. Gently, he lifted John into a sitting position, just long enough to settle himself in. John leaned against the other man, sighing in relief. It had only been a few days, but he hadn’t realized how big a difference human contact would make.
“Positive. Not by much.” Sherlock glared at Moran. “We’ll sort out this end.”
The man laughed, but he didn’t sound happy. “And what is your word worth, Highness?”
“The same. I can do more than they can with my strength. It should give them time to run away. Do I have that wrong? I sometimes do.”
“Ten months. There wasn’t much competition.”
“So she didn’t bring much,” Sherlock continued, ignoring the commentary. “So Riley’s got to get Waverly far away enough from here that neither Jamiarty nor us could find her, and find sanctuary. But look—to the west of London lies Florin, to the North Archenland. If she knows our allies, and I imagine she does?” He looked towards Moran, who nodded. “Then she knows not to take either route. That leaves across the Channel.”
“Aren’t we worried about speed?”
“You’re mostly there. I do take Sherlock for my husband and my Queen.”
She shook her head. "I'm trying to help you,
“One last question, Riley. How did Jamiarty kill his half-sister?”
“Very smart,” the man in black replied.
Molly had clambered off his back and sat curled in a ball in the front of the boat. She knew to keep out of the way when he was getting himself sorted. He was always clumsy when he first got into a boat.
“I think I could beat you in a fair fight,” Riley replied agreeably.
“Go fuck yourself.”
The man in black raised his hand, but didn’t hit him.
John’s eyes lit up. “With the colours?”
“And now what?” John shouted right back. “Now that we're lovers, you're going to tell me goodbye before you leave me behind? How kind of you. Damn you Sherlock, I was your friend before I was your partner. How do you think I would have coped without you there?”
“There is something she could do, Molly,” Grezzik offered. “She could help us against Jamiarty.”
There was a long pause.
The count sighed and stepped away from his horse. “Very well.”
He clubbed her head, and the last thing Maria felt was someone laying her gently on the ground. “Good luck, Molly.”
“Sherlock, love, listen.”
"My old room," John replied. He hesitated. "It might be a bit tricky for you to get up with your ankle."
Hi Everyone!
A family he’d never thought he would have.
This is the most NSFW I've ever gotten, and I feel accomplished. (shhhh I know it's not that much shhhh) Just a heads up that from now on I'll be skipping more around in both timelines; next week's Victorian, for example, is set almost twenty years after the one three weeks from today.
“I’m carrying three people, and he only has himself.”
“Really? But all these rooms are so…so like you and Grandfather John.”
The pain became an impetus, and Sally kept pace with Molly.
Molly never liked Jim Moriarty. She used him entirely to make Sherlock jealous.
John should have hesitated. He should go to the Diogenes Club to stage his confrontation with Mycroft, then on to Bart's with Sherlock. But if Sally had caught on, she had to be dealt with.
It was different for the others. Molly had Janine now, and of course the Princess had his husband. Grezzik didn’t need that kind of happiness (though it would be nice), but he was starting to feel dissatisfied. He didn’t have to fight anymore, which was nice, and his friends were here, and that was nice too. But he was starting to feel useless. Really, what had he done since coming here?
This story is set in the Victorian Era, but feel free to headcanon it as both. If Sherlock could write John and Mary's wedding song Holmes can damn well play out his feelings. And then share them. The titles are Latin numbers—Five, Ten and Twenty respectively, for the anniversaries of the Dream.
It reminded him a lot of Baker Street, but…it wasn’t. It couldn’t be. This place was bizarre—there was an edge to it, a taste in the air that convinced Watson that he was very far from home indeed.
"She's very sweet, " Molly said quietly. "I know you can't tell me everything, but...John, is she in danger?"
Sherlock looked on his windowsill. Watson had gotten him a pot, and he’d planted the moonblossom. It was midnight, and the petals were open, almost glowing in the light.
Sherlock’s cheeks were suddenly hot, but it wasn’t warm. It was a crisp fall day, and he’d made the first important discovery of his life.
It was a good day for Holmes’ leg and Watson’s back, so they offered to take the children for a walk along the beach. Mycroft went with them as far as the pool, but regretfully announced that he had to turn back. “I’m afraid I’m only going to slow you down.”
John smirked. "I'll text Greg, make sure he's home."
“Do you think this is a trap by warriors of Guilder?”
Just behind him was an enormous man, tall and…it wasn’t fat, so much as a sheer amount of mass. He seemed far too cheerful to be Mycroft, but his eyes—piercing and thoughtful at the same time—removed any doubt.
Those people fail to understand that to love another person, and to make them feel extraordinary, is an accomplishment all in itself.
Or maybe…
Holmes opened his mouth. The sound that came out was the deepest, harshest perversion of a laugh Watson had ever heard: his skin crawled just to hear it.
Molly bowed her head. “I suppose she died doing what she loved.”
Grezzik snapped out of it, and looked behind him. Molly was right. The Cliffs were beginning to loom in the distance, over his left shoulder. He grunted and turned the boat.
Mary smiled at him. “I am, sir. Is my fiancé?”
“We’re in a hurry, Maria!”
Billy’s tears fell, and Kitty choked on her own sob. Watson tilted Billy’s chin up. “Lad, don’t be scared. It’s going to be alright.”
“Of course.” Sally fumbled with the strap. “Her name is Waverly,” she added as she laid the child in Queen Bella’s arms.
“One of my guards—well, I suppose he was one of Moran’s guards, really. The second we heard that, we knew we’d have to act fast.” Janine gestured behind her, and Molly saw several cloaked figures.
Martha’s eyes filled with tears. “We had one daughter, and she married and had a son. When her child was two, the three of them moved, and a few years later we heard that they’d…that they were all killed.”
“Be quiet, Max! One of the spies came back late, and Philip’s speaking with her!”
Moriarty was infuriatingly calm for someone who was inches away from plummeting to their death. "What, you think my goons will stop shooting just because I'm dead? You've clearly never met Seb. The others are loyal enough to my cash—they'll finish the job. Doesn't matter, really. Would you really trade one for the other two?"
“Is my brother secure?”
(If for some reason you're starting this story here, for goodness sake go back to the arc starting with 'Eye'. It's a bit different to what happened in the show)
“Not really,” Molly said truthfully. The first few days she knew Ireni had been a booze-filled haze, and the month after that of painful withdrawal didn’t bear thinking about.
“I haven’t got anything wonderful for you, Princess.”
Mycroft's got a case for Holmes and Watson. Or does he?
Right now all she could think about was making sure that in this time of sickness, her fathers could still be together, without anyone finding out what they meant to each other. She and her little family would protect them.
“You’ll never have to do it again,” John promised.
Kitty and Stan sat down, rather pointedly two feet apart.
“I hate waiting.” Maria thought for a moment. “I could give you my word as a Spaniard?”
“This is my second masterpiece, Molly,” he said, eyes blazing. “This will fulfill me.”
Ireni sighed. “I know what you think of me, and you’re right. I’m a monster. I’m rude, I’m demanding, and selfish. I did little other than abuse you both.”
“Excellent point.” Janine drew her closer. “You’re incredibly useful, Lady Montoya.” She looked at Moran. “Officially, we accept this scroll as truth, and we will carry it as truth to our allies.” Then she beckoned Moran closer. “Mycroft, come here.”
Far too far away, as a matter of fact.
Holmes stepped forward first, Watson only a step behind. The door was unlocked, the key shining in the handle. Holmes put it carefully into his pocket and opened the door.
Sherlock looked away. “I suppose.”
He’d tried wriggling out of his chains as he regained strength, but it was hopeless. They were far too thick, bolted into the metal walls. He’d tried shouting, but no one came. The only response had been a roar of a lion and the high shriek of some nightmarish bird.
Not Good.
Grezzik stepped forward. He hesitated for only an instant before he took Mycroft’s hands in his. “You don’t have to be terrible all the time, Mycroft. I could help you.”
There was a long pause; Sherlock could tell John wasn’t quite done.
And Molly left the room.
“We’ll have to rescue them. All of them, before Jamiarty gets anything out of them.”
Greg winced. "You fight dirty, Doctor."
“What are we assuming?”
“No. To the pain.”
“Family’s important. And I had a good job. Besides, I had no real reason to go other than hating the Prince, and that’s most of this country. I was just waiting for an excuse.”
Mycroft steepled his fingers. “I cannot say that it is exactly what I envisioned for Sherlock—I did not think he would give his heart at all, and certainly not to a forbidden lover. But then again Sherlock’s never done what I predicted, and he’s often ended up the happier for it. And you are a good man, John, that much is obvious. So long as you do not cause him pain, I am happy to support you.” Gray eyes turned to steel. “And you will not cause him pain, correct?”
It was John who’d realized that Jamiarty would be in the throne room. They’d run there right after making sure Cerise was safe (not that she needed help, she was running through the halls, her bandaged arms more than capable of holding two pikes). Then it was a simple matter of waiting for Jamiarty to reveal himself. The throne room had at least eighteen different hiding places, and most of them had exits out of the room.
“Well,” the taller stranger said, and his voice sounded thick. “We’d better leave you to get on with it. We mustn’t waste your time.”
Sherlock stared at his parents. “Did you hear what he just said?”
“I agree, John,” Mycroft said. “But not every adjustment is unpleasant.”
Prince Jamiarty beamed as he moved to take Sherlock’s hands. “And our wedding will go ahead as planned! Tonight we marry, and tomorrow we depart for our honeymoon. All the ships in our Armada will follow us out of the Channel, and we will have a glorious time, my darling.”
He hung up; what was the point of going on? There’d never been enough time to say everything to Sherlock.
When Molly Morstan was ten, Jacob asked her if she wouldn’t mind having another new name. “If your Mummy agrees, I want to share my name with both of you,” he said. Molly agreed, as long as she could call him Dad. They shook hands, and once they’d talked to Mummy and bought her a pretty white dress with sparkles she and Molly became Hoopers.
“Sorry!” Grezzik exclaimed.
“Wait.” Miracle Max stopped. “I make him better, Jamiarty suffers?”
Will they succeed?
“Rise and report.”
“All you need to know right now is that help is coming, and Jamiarty won’t be Prince for much longer.”
“If we can’t have your birthday in London this year, I’m happy to make the trip.” Uncle Mycroft ruffled her hair. “Sit down, Princess, there’s plenty to eat.
“Whine, whine…’ Grezzik brightened. “Even when we’re doing fine!”
John glared at his partner, who smirked back.
John steered Molly into the kitchen, for some reason quite sure that Kitty had this in hand.
“Sally,” Sherlock said, and he didn't know how he was still so calm, how he could sound so cold. “Sally, where is John?”
An almost immediate response: Good. Moriarty en route. Go to a bar and text Lestrade. He'll provide good cover.—SH.
“And you know plenty about loyalty, I suppose cousin? You left me without a backwards glance.”
They were there.
John was about to agree when he heard Sherlock’s phone chirp.
Blackwater recoiled. John glanced to the right, saw Greg and Dimmock coming down the hall. Blackwater saw them too.
Sally looked at him. “But—”
“Sleeping in her crib. Not a problem.”
There was a whoop from the living room. John poked his head out and saw Kitty laughing as Lily and Jacob were bouncing up and down on the couch cushions.
“Of course they are. They know who did it. That’s not why you’re here.”
“The Crown calls its first witness,” the King said. “Myself.” He stood up and, amidst the muttering of the crowd, sat in a chair in the no-man’s-land between the royals and the prisoner. “My name is Lotharon, King of Florin. After my first wife died I became despondent. I laid with a member of the Carrier family, Cerise Donovan. She bore me a child, who I named Carla. Three years later, I wanted another child, but Cerise wanted to wed within the Carriers. I agreed to this, and laid with her sister instead, Abigail Donovan. She bore me Sally Donovan, but sadly died in childbirth. When Carla was seven, she went on a trip with myself and Prince Jamiarty. Jamiarty knew that Carla was his sister, though I never made it clear whether she could inherit.”
It didn’t matter. He could cope with torture.
Holmes stomped up all seventeen stairs and opened the door with a bang. Watson looked up, startled. “Hello, Holmes, what on Earth?”
Whoever can solve the (really very simple) anagrams of the countries wins a 'smart award'.
“Grezzik?”
"Sherlock?"
“Not recently. He was shot at about a year ago. His bodyguards took care of the shooter—terrible shot.”
“That is not my choice, Highness. I do not like to kill the innocent. But I promise you that Ireni will keep her word. You will not die in pain.”
Watson squeezed his hand, then slowly, as cautiously as the old men they'd been, they made their way down the stairs.
The group in the South returns to the capital, Molly decides on her favour, and some unexpected company sparks the beginning of the end for Jamiarty.
"Play it."
Lestrade and the others had managed to round up ten of the other seventeen, and with Lisa Stark’s contact list it wouldn’t be long for the rest. John sat next to Sherlock, wrapped together in a shock blanket (“for my bloody peace of mine,
“I am his beloved,” John answered, and he moved closer. “I know this room. I was here. I was tied to that same table, in that same place. We speak the truth. We know that Sally is the King’s daughter. And we know that Jamiarty murdered your daughter. He told you that tonight, didn’t he? He probably thought that would make you speak, that the pain would loosen your tongue. But he doesn’t really understand how love works, does he?”
For once, the towels weren’t threadbare nonsense, and there were several large fluffy ones. John dried Sherlock carefully, relieved to feel his pulse calming down when he touched his wrists.
“But if—if he says that—if he had you, and he told me if I came back you could live…I don’t know if I’m brave enough to say no.”
"I think you may have one," John started, then cringed as the doorbell rang three times downstairs. "Make that two." He stood. "That's Mrs. Hudson, I'd better go explain what's going on."
The man in black slowed but didn’t stop. “Let me explain…”
“In the diary, he says he was truly proud of conquering the creature’s threat. He said that its corpse lay in a pretty place for years, and he decided to move ‘what remained’.”
“Is it going to be a big wedding?”
Molly almost stopped in her tracks, and Sally did.
Grezzik set John down gently just beside the castle wall. Molly was calmer now, and that scared him. “Shouldn’t we wait longer?”
“Where would I find a worthy man?” Prince Jamiarty said dramatically. “One who is beautiful enough to be worthy of me?” This, of course, was the condition for royal spouses. It didn’t seem to have much effect on the gene pool.
John turned to him, a bundle over his shoulder. “I’m glad you think so.” He started for the door, but Sherlock stopped him.
John's phone beeped and he dove for it.
They'd made their excuses after that, leaving to a cheering crowd. Sherlock hadn't let go of John's hand the entire way home, and insisted on sitting right next to him, curled close in the back of the cab.
“It’s alright, love. Is he secure?”
“Kitty, darling, why not?”
Molly stared at Ireni. “What vow are you talking about?”
would you make today more clear? Give yourself some oblivion, man.”
It was a simple ring, a gold band with a small diamond set into the ring so it wouldn’t catch on anything. John thought it was beautiful.
P.S. Johnson (Shinwell Johnson) is a character from the original story. Very minor, he introduces Holmes to Kitty, knows a fair bit about Gruner.
There were occasional threats to Greg because of Mycroft’s work. Mycroft always ensured that anyone making such threats had to apologize to Greg personally before they were…dealt with.
Without saying a word, the count drew his own sword and stabbed Domingo through the heart.
"I mistook your husband for someone else."
Why not be rewarded for that?
It's the wedding day, and the Brute Squad has a job to do. One member in particular, however, meets up with an old friend...
“Hush,” Sherlock ordered. “Just in case.”
John beamed. “Thanks, mate.” He  shook Greg’s hand and left.
The woman who’d been wailing was writhing, her eyes tightly shut.
Sherlock looked at him. “Mycroft and I are seven years apart, while you and Harry are barely five. You would have been around her more often than I with Mycroft. Why don’t you remember?” Sherlock felt his gut tighten. John had an excellent memory.
“You’re becoming sharper with age, Gregory.”
“I could give that a try,” Ireni said. “The idea of being kind has never really appealed to me, but then again…people can change.”
“You take me with you, or I will follow you,” John said simply. “And I know you, love, better than you know yourself. How long do you think it will be before I find you?”
That next day was a difficult one for Mycroft. The strains of running the British Government were more noticeable when you were nearing seventy two, and Mycroft found himself wondering, for the first time, whether it might be time to retire.
“Why didn’t you fight those three, then?”
“No, John. I’m worried I won’t be brave enough to lose you again.”
"The main thing is," and now David's face became more serious, "that you don't need it anymore. You're not tied to your bodies anymore, and your souls have been refreshed, so to speak. There won't be any more minds racing off the tracks."
“I believe they’re still asleep. Little Carla was awake half the night.”
Grezzik unslung the Princess. He chafed the man’s ankles, and set him upright. “Can you walk?”
He was still glad that he knew how to want.
"Yes," Grandad Sherlock said finally. "Yes, there have been very scary moments for both of us. But we're alright, and they're over now."
Please tell me someone got that reference. I also thought I’d give another style a try. Let me know what you think! Set about a week after ‘Sleeping on It’. Also John has a potty mouth.
And since his mother was busy ignoring her children and his father was busy arguing with his wife, they agreed to make Watson do the work.
Everyone stood and cheered them, and John stood and gave Lestrade a tight hug. Then he stepped away—
“Miracle Max?” Stam grinned at him. “We need your help.”
“We’ll find you one in the Brutes’ headquarters.”
John stared at Moriarty. He didn't put up his hands; there was no need. Moriarty knew he wouldn't move.
This is for merlynnllwyd, hopefully I've done your request some justice. It was tricky to write but I enjoyed the challenge.
Sally wanted to fight the woman, but her legs had already given out.
“You know what’s interesting about you and Grezzik?” Ireni said. “You were the ones who had to work for me, to put up with all that nonsense and all that risk, yet you are determined to give your favours to someone else.”
Ireni glared. “Pick up one of those rocks, and hide behind a boulder. The moment the man in black comes around the corner, HIT HIM WITH THE ROCK!”
“Don’t worry, I propped it open. We’re fine, John.” Sherlock took his hand. “Now…why don’t we let the people’s voices be heard?”
“Come, sir. We must get to your ship.”
John didn’t reply, trembling in his arms.
“To the Zoo of Death,” Alissa said. She was calmer now, but still trembling. “I heard Father scream it when they took her away. She’s terrified of the creatures there.”
Nothing left but brandy, drowning herself in the liquid to get her through the night. And the afternoon. And the morning. By the time Ireni found her, Maria couldn’t afford brandy, and she lay in the street, the sword by her side still enough to protect her but that was all.
The sun was coming in at an awkward angle and John grumbled as he tilted his laptop screen back and forth, always coming back to the same position. Sherlock grinned.
“Of course women can be smart. I just want to know how smart you think you are.”
“Well said.”
Max was staring at her. Without a word, he grabbed her wrist and tilted her hand palm up. He traced the lines on her palm in shock.
Sherlock thought—and let Sherlock hug him too.
Now they just kept the two of them separated as often as they could. It was a shame, John thought as the argument died down outside.  If the two of them hadn't had such a bad beginning, it might have been a wonderful friendship. They were very alike in some ways—both terribly keen and clever, both anxious to look after the victims and survivors. They both enjoyed the same sorts of books, too (except Brontë). Yes, it was a shame.
John dug out his key and opened the door. Mrs. Hudson was likely asleep, and John helped Sherlock up the stairs as quietly as he could.
...Look, I couldn't decide what name I liked best, so this Kitty and Stan have a girl!
And there you have it! Look...I really wanted this, okay? Mostly because I wanted to make Victorian!Mycroft a literal shipper. I hope you enjoyed it. I'm going to be away next week, so posting might be a bit late, but I will do my best to get a chapter up. Worst case scenario, you get two chapters on the 4th.
“Got taken for treason, remember?” The man’s skin was as dark as Sally’s. “S’all right, Alissa. Jamiarty’s gone off his rocker.”
“It’s nearly midnight.”
John let her go, pulling a handkerchief out of his pocket.
Kitty looked disappointed. “So it was just because you could?”
Moriarty backed off with a smirk. “Of course. Take all the time you need. Although my marksmen do have itchy trigger fingers…maybe not too long.” He walked until he stood ten feet from John, and then pointedly put his fingers in his ears.
Four hours overdue.
Think it worked—JW.
John glanced over at Sherlock, who was nodding off in the seat next to him. They'd chosen to go south for their honeymoon, to Bermuda in fact (this had been settled by a game of darts). What John had not factored in while debating different sunscreens and hotels and things to do (they were not going to go diving for sharks, he didn't care if it was mostly safe, he wasn't going near predators on purpose on his honeymoon) was that Bermuda was far away.
Alissa’s eyes flew open, and she wrenched against her bonds. The man she was tied to cried out in pain, and that seemed to get to her. She stopped, looking around in shock.
“I just don’t want you to die embarrassed,” Grezzik soothed him. He made a grab for the man in black, but he jumped away.
“Compared to those,” Watson whispered, “this fear is nothing at all. And so I enjoy my life far more.”
He hadn’t wanted to ask about it, worried that he was making it all up. But he
“Don’t be ridiculous,” he heard Holmes say. “I’ve got a much better idea.”
He cut her, first one cheek, then the other. Then he picked her up, let her blood drip once on the ground, and licked each cut. “Be careful, little baby,” he whispered. “There’s no one to protect you now.” He threw her to the ground.
"Oh darling." Kitty held her too-tall, too-smart boy close. "No, darling, no. They can't."
“Right. Look, I will do everything in my power to love your little brother with all I have for the rest of my life, or as long as he wants me, whichever comes last. And if I hurt him, I will fully expect to feel the wrath of the British Government, though I do hope you’ll eventually learn to trust me with his heart. Are we done?”
“You were dead,” Sherlock repeated. His cheeks were wet. Was he crying again? After all this time?
He put his hand over mine. “I suppose not.”
"I don't think we should take sides, dear," John answered. "I think our best hope is to see them both. They might change their minds, after all. I just wish they'd give each other a chance."
When Stan was still Eliza, he was told to be a physicist. When he went to uni at his father’s order, he dropped both the gender and the dream someone else had given him, and signed up for police training instead.
“Oh. Oh, Sherlock.” John held him as tightly as he could, and silently cursed as his husband shook in his hold. “Darling, I won’t let him take you.”
“Hush.” John stroked his hair. “I understand. I should have known you better.”
“Will you two
The man in black released him immediately and rolled him over, checking to make sure he was breathing.
John is determined to surprise Sherlock for their anniversary. Will he manage it?
“In a minute,” Sherlock interrupted. John letting go was not at all Okay right now.
It was late afternoon, judging by the light. They’d come staggering home from St. Bart’s, unwilling to let each other go for a moment, stopping just long enough to explain to poor Mrs. Hudson why the nice young man fixing the fridge now had a bullet in his skull. They’d collapsed in bed right after their phones were switched off. John fell asleep almost immediately; apparently being knocked unconscious for several hours didn’t make up for missed sleep.
“Then we need to get back to Florin. That’s the only place she can become your Heir, right?”
Watson raised a hand and patted Holmes’ shoulder. “Sherlock, it’s alright. I promise, I will be quite alright.”
I joined him at the window, watching the two walk down the street, walking so close they almost seemed to be one figure.
“No, there hasn’t been time for some of it, and the rest is—I’m ashamed.”
“Oh. Well, Waverly is very young. She has much more of her life to live. I wanted to give her a chance to experience all of it. Besides, I was the only one large enough to shelter her.”
It nearly cost John his.
“John?”
John looked the elderly woman up and down. He spun her around, ignoring her surprised squawk. Satisfied, he moved back. “You’ll do, love.”
Watson took his hand, not caring who saw. “You helped me, dear. One of the many reasons I love you—you have the skill to heal a doctor.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Kitty waits until everyone in her house has fallen asleep before she goes to bed. She likes to have a moment alone to savour her new happiness.
“Anyways, once I knew that, I decided to keep dancing!” Moriarty did a strange little hop-skip, the gun rock-steady in his hand. “Let you make your little plans—quite good, I must say. Though not quite as good as mine.”
“So am I,” John replied softly. He kissed Sherlock, hand sliding into his curls. “We should go home.”
Mycroft was staring at him like he’d lost his head. Grezzik shifted uncomfortably. “I will not harm myself, my lord.” Perhaps that was what was bothering the man—as the High Priest, he had a duty to lead people away from suicide.
After many weeks of not being sure when to end this, I thought my anniversary (year 4!) was a good time. This was written for enby-angel a while back on a bad day, and they very kindly let me share it with the world. I hope it's a good way to usher in the New Year!
"So you'll hear if I sneak out, then?"
"And Kitty?" John raised his eyebrows. "Do be good to the lad, eh? He's a good sort."
“Watson…John.” That was his real name, the name everyone else called him. “John, help me up?”
“Holmes!”
The table was laid with two places, Mrs. Hudson's nicer plates and good silverware nestled amid sprigs of holly.
John whirled and kissed Sherlock furiously. “No, you complete and utter idiot. Have I got to prove it to you?”
Sherlock’s long limbs wrapped around him as tightly as they could, and John hugged him back as tightly as he could. “It’s alright, love. You’re safe as anything, I promise. I’m not going anywhere.”
“It’s over now, Sherlock.”
“Coming, sir!” Hopkins’ voice was floaty too, and Watson wanted to close his eyes again.
“Stupid.”
“It was a nice day,” Holmes agreed carefully.
“This will not help,” Mycroft snapped. He turned back to Moran. “Tell me what the plan was.”
The plan now was simple. Molly and Gruner were going to the collector's room. Sherlock, through an open window, was going to watch and make sure nothing untoward happen, and climb in to retrieve the book once they were gone. John, meanwhile was going after the girls, making his way quietly through the house to the basement. If all went well, Molly would point out where the book was or Sherlock would see it himself, the girls would be out of the house, and everyone would be safe.
(See the end of the chapter for
(Sherlock probably knew anyways, the git, so why go to the trouble of admitting it?)
Of course, neither Mycroft nor Janine trusted Jamiarty as far as they could throw him. So they sent spies into Florin, both to the little villages and the larger cities. One person was at the castle, but that person, of course, wasn’t Anderson. The former spy’s cover had been blown when he left with Sally, and Mycroft refused to risk him when he had a child coming. Anderson still knew plenty about Florin though, so he planned each mission. Stam consulted with him, and went on some missions with darkened eyes, a hood and long gloves (priests were an excellent cover). Every time that a spy came back, Anderson would hear the report, no matter the time.
Moran bowed. “My name is Lord Sebastian Moran, Spymaster for Prince Jamiarty. I was entrusted with the Prince’s secret plan to murder Princess Sherlock of London, after which I read his book of deeds, all foul in nature. I am guilty of crimes in the Prince’s name, your Majesty. But I never thought it was treason. I never knew I was abetting the murderer of a child.”
The floors of the Summer palace were all thin carpet, perfect for ocean-soaked bathers returning to the halls. It also made their footsteps nearly silent, and Sally led her party in total quiet to the library.
“He really loves you,” Jamiarty whispered to John. “And you truly love him, and you could have been really, truly happy. Not one couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the stories say. And so I think no man will suffer more than you now.”
“Hello, Doctor, Mr. Holmes,” she said, and her smile seemed genuine. “I believe I have, Mr. Holmes, though why you want to help me is still beyond me.”
"Child, there are many wonderful things about being old. And in a way, this is one of them." Watson's eyes were glistening with tears. "You will understand when you get there. It is painful to say goodbye, but we need rest. Do you understand?"
John stopped typing. “Like what?”
“If they’re smart, they’ll stay quiet,” Ireni said. “Now I know we’ve all slept on different kinds of beds, but right now we need to work together and plan a distraction. What is the best way into the Heir room, your Majesty?”
The bitterly cold April had finally ended, and the first few days of May were soft and warm. Delighted by the turn in weather, Holmes and Watson had spent the entire day outside, going so far as to take their dinner and eat in the park. That drew some stares, but Holmes didn’t mind. They’d done far stranger things in public.
Mrs. Hudson looked at him sharply. “Will you be going upstairs then, Doctor?”
“What?”
John smiled, though it was crooked. “Should have taken you up on your offer, I suppose. But I thought…there was a moment when I knew I was dying.”
Maria put her hand on her heart. “I swear on the soul of my father Domingo Montoya, you will reach the top alive.”
“But still…Hopkins!” Holmes shook his head. “The fellow’s got half her brains.”
Mrs. Hudson nodded. “The Yard’s issued an apology to the two of you.”
Unfortunately, it became immediate when the King died suddenly.
Well, all alone except The Woman. Ireni had been sitting in the crowd at his last performance. She saw his value; well, his value to her. She needed his strength. Grezzik needed a job.
Mycroft loves labels; he organizes, he files, it’s what he does. On the other hand, he refuses to find a label for his own orientation. He doesn’t like the idea of filing a part of himself away—he likes the idea of analyzing how he feels about Greg even less.
John discovered he was bi because of a boy named Victor Trevor. He never shares the story with Sherlock, or he would know that Sherlock solved his murder.
Sherlock's smile widened. "Come along, Stan," he said, pulling the boy down the hall. "Now, the first thing to remember is to notice everything. Not everything matters, but..."
Mild spoilers for Game of Thrones ahead (specifically for the Red Wedding if you're far behind), and some swearing.
That stunned Holmes speechless.
Maria loved her father.

“I would never kill an artist like yourself,” the man in black said, circling her with his sword still out. “Besides, you have your quest. But I can’t have you interfering with mine.”
“I love you.”
Anderson nodded. “Life is ridiculous, isn’t it? A spy becomes a King.”
John glared at the man, his eyes desperate with pain. His hands shook as he turned his back to Moriarty and walked towards the edge of the roof.
“Janine?” Molly hissed. “What on earth are you doing here?”
"Dad!" Kitty straightened her shirt. "Um, this is...not what it looks like?"
“That leaves the Sicilian Crowd,” Ireni crowed. Her smile faltered when Grezzik and Molly looked at her. “What? It was a good name. We can go to the South and find the King and Queen. Do we know where the Palace is?”
“What is it?” John stepped closer, and Mycroft offered him the bottle.
Well, if John was working towards their happiness and love, then surely he should do his part! He needed to be strong and fit, so John would never have to leave him again! Sherlock leapt up, tucked the note into the pocket against his heart, and sprinted outside.
Holmes thought telling Watson how he felt would be the most terrifying thing he’d ever done. Then he stood outside the door to the Stranger’s Room at the Diogenes Club for three hours
"How could I ever be bored by you?" Sherlock said wonderingly, stroking a hand through John's boring blond hair. "John Watson, you surprise me every day."
Watson rolled his eyes. “My dear Holmes, I’m perfectly—OUCH!” He jerked away as Holmes placed the
Was she angry with him? Sally struggled with that one. It wasn’t the lack of crown that bothered her—the Carriers were all given a lovely house and ate as well as the royal family, if not with them. She had an education, pretty dresses, and a family that cared about her. No, she had never suffered for the material wants.
“Which is what?”
"I hope you don't feel the need to do that," John answered quietly. "But if you do, remember that we'll still help you. Your friend will be alright."
“Grezzik, tear his arms off,” Molly said.
Sherlock kissed up his jaw. "And what if I said I was ready now, John? More than ready?"
Kitty stared down at her T-shirt and jeans and looked back at him as though he might be ill in the head.
Special thanks to NovaNara, who reminded me of my original plan for Sally.
“Do you mean fascinating like a pile of dung is fascinating?” Grezzik had heard Sherlock make that pronouncement a few days before. He’d politely wandered away before the Princess could explain.
“It doesn’t matter,” Ireni snapped. “We’ll be at the Cliffs by dawn.”
John stared at him in horror. “What?”
“We have three things to do,” Sherlock said. He patted his husband’s hand. “We need to prove this murder, we need to depose of Jamiarty peacefully and we need to bring the King and Queen back from the Summer Palace to witness this. They’re the only ones who can make it stick.”
“So I put down my sword and you put down your rock and we’ll try and kill each other like civilized people?”
“Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says otherwise is selling something.” The man in black paused. “Actually, I think I might remember your farm boy. He was a cabin boy. I could tell you about our meeting. Would it bother you to hear?”
Holmes was indeed at the door before he was less than twenty minutes later; waving enthusiastically as their family pulled up. Rachel Hopkins, all of five, leapt out and barrelled towards them. Billy helped his mother down and followed his sister in the same manner, and Stan just shook his head.
“I will. Now, will you stay to rest?”
Sherlock and John go to a party thrown by Scotland Yard, and some misunderstandings are cleared up.
Prince Jamiarty lifted Sherlock’s hand and kissed it. “I will see you then.”
“Maybe that’s why you’re here,” Holmes mused.
Sherlock smirked. “Why don’t we get married here? It’s a lot of bother, going to Canada.”
The woman looked well-fed and groomed, but her eyes were full of hate. Nevertheless, she curtsied low.
"Nothing about this is easy," Watson whispered. "I am sorry we are causing you pain."
Sherlock looked up. And up, and up…
John smirked. “I will.”
Greg sat bolt upright. “Mycroft?”
"Molly, no. You can't go."
Watson blushed. "Never should have written that," he said gruffly. "I was angry with you for leaving, I thought perhaps you wouldn't care that this was—"
Sherlock put a hand on her knee. “Sweetheart, anyone who can’t see how much you two love each other are idiots and don’t deserve to be in your life anyways.”
When Mummy left, Grandad Sherlock took out his chemistry set. Billy was never, never allowed to touch, but he watched and listened as his grandfather explained how different chemicals turned different colours when you did different things with them. Billy didn't quite understand everything, but he loved the pretty colours, and he was fascinated when some of them made puffs of smoke when you poured them together—one even popped and seemed to spark!
“Comforting,” the man in black said as he wedged himself against the wall once more. “But I think you’re going to have to wait.”
But Mycroft Holmes had just helped them on a case, Holmes was abed ‘not sick, Watson, merely tired’ and Watson enjoyed the elder Holmes’ company.
Sherlock still couldn’t quite believe his eyes.
“That’s alright,” Sally whispered. “I have my daughter, and I thank you for it.” She kissed the baby’s head. “Although I don’t know what to call her.”
The doctor saw her sorrow, and ran a hand through her hair. Like any father, blood or not, it killed him to see his child in pain, but there was little to be done.
They held hands on the ride. Sherlock didn’t talk much and John stared out the window, trying to figure out where they were going.
Grezzik sighed. “I suppose you need less wine in you before you hear news like that.”
And John suffers for it.
The thought forced his eyes open. John stared around in complete shock, because clearly something had gone wrong.
The law of gravity states that objects follow the same rate of falling, but Sir Isaac Newton had never met Grezzik. Grezzik started flutter-kicking through the air, keeping a smile on his face in case Waverly saw him.
One last time, MAJOR CHARACTER DEATH. This is pt. 1, and if you want to wait until pt.2 is up tomorrow, feel free to do so.
This one would be different.
Something happened today that is not entirely to do with us, but is another story that must be guarded. And yet…I will still write it, in case someday there comes a reader who wishes to know the full truth.
When Mummy came to collect him just before supper, Billy was ecstatic.
He disarmed her, sending her sword flying across the rocks.
Grezzik nodded, and the two of them left. The King and Queen were lying down together, and they’d somehow managed to fall asleep.
“It’s very pretty,” he said diplomatically.
Introducing....
Mary was innocent, but not naïve. She knew that love was between man and woman, that marriage was the highest form of love, and that she and John were meant to be together.
“You’re not mad, love. You were drugged. It’s different. Come on, I want you to take a shower.”
“Ireni gave orders too! We wait when a job goes bad, wait where we started!” The woman’s words were slurred. “I am waiting for Ireni…”
Mycroft cleared his throat. “As Head Priest of London—”
“Oh, no. We’ll have an heir and a spare, and we’ll get nannies to take care of them.”
"I'm trying to finish typing up my case notes, Dad!"
Unable to speak anymore, she kissed their foreheads and left the room, heart and eyes full. "Come on," she told her children, curled up together on the sofa. "Let's go for a walk. Your father will join us soon."
Watson startled. "Of course, Sherlock. I can remember my own anniversary." He glanced at his partner. "What is it? Do you not want to have the family here?”
“You had love in your hands! Better to die with it then come back to garbage! I won’t bow to you, Queen of Rubbish! Queen of Filth, Slime, Muck! Boo! Boo! BOO!”
“I want a library.”
“I will be fine, my friend. I will see you soon.” The woman’s lips were tight.
Good old Kate, she didn’t ask questions, though she was clearly bursting. “They’re in the library, I believe. Leave your horses here, I can take them to the stables.”
They could have walked all day, but storm clouds were brewing on the horizon, and Rachel was growing sleepy. She still napped in the middle of the day, and fell asleep clinging to Billy’s back as they returned to the cottage.
“This is odd, Sherlock,” Watson said quietly.
John gasped, taking Rachel in his arms. “Goodness gracious! Congratulations!”
“Should I be?” Sherlock turned his head.
“Your ship. So you
“That’s his last name!” Grezzik blurted. “That’s what Moran called him.”
“John, I am attempting to be supportive. Sex might be an important component of their relationship—”
“I’m trying to give you a chance. Prince Jamiarty will find you, and he will take your life for taking me.”
Sherlock tried to grab the giant’s hand, but it closed around his neck gently and pressed against the side, sending him into darkness.
“What is it, Holmes?” Watson was half-asleep, coming down the stairs without limping for the first time in two weeks. Lovely.
The man blushed. "Well, not really. I just borrowed him for a moment, all those years ago. I wanted you to meet."
As Grezzik readjusted Sherlock, this time tied with his arms around the giant’s neck and hanging off the back (the first time he’d felt short in
“What on earth have you two been doing?”
John smiled at himself in the bathroom mirror. It was still dark outside; barely half six in the morning. He wasn’t a morning person in the slightest, but today he was as cheerful as he could be.
“Over my damn dead body,” John exploded. Then…. “oh, right. How much time do we have?”
“Yes?” Sherlock said sharply.
“You took this job from him.”
Sherlock chuckled. "I'm planning nothing of the sort." He put a wiry arm around John's waist, stooping a bit to do so. "I just thought it would be a change of venue from our usual rendezvous."
“Yes, Father.” Sally looked at Queen Bella. “I’d…I’d be proud to call you Mother. I never knew mine.”
“Then Florin needs a Princess.” Her father took her hand. “Sally, I know I haven’t given you the training, but you are my only living child. And I think you would make a wonderful queen someday. Will you become my Heir?”
John shook his head. “I wasn’t mad at you. I mean, yes I was, because you did push it, but…I didn’t want to talk about it, and that wasn’t really fair.”
“He beat me with steel, he beat you with strength, yes?” Maria began to pace. “He must have out-thought Ireni! Anyone who can do that can plan my castle onslaught with no problem!”
“I accept.”
Watson laughed. “You and your bees,” he said fondly. “Of course.”
“Maybe because you’re my lover, and my flatmate, and my friend, and you deserve to know why I don’t want to talk about my family?” John retorted.
“Of course!” Ireni clapped her hands. “Yes, that’s perfectly possible. There are a few different ways to do that, but the simplest is a potion. Do you have any preference as to who is the sire?”
“I remember,” Miracle Max continued, and his voice was softer now. “But you need to have faith. Grezzik knows she’s alive.”
A wave of remorse swept over Billy. He was trying to trick them, but he hadn’t done anything to show that they…well, that they were safe. After all the times they’d protected him!
Prince Jamiarty was just setting aside his wedding gloves to write one last report when Moran arrived and knelt.
“Yes it is,” Watson gasped. “It is very funny indeed, my dear Holmes.”
“Anderson?!”
“No, Uncle Sherlock.”
John remembered now; Sherlock calling him in an utter panic at Harry’s, saying that he’d just stitched up a dream. “He’s alright then?” he asked.
Mycroft smiled when he saw them. “Good afternoon Dr. Watson, Sherlock. Fine day, is it not?”
Molly groaned. “I told you, I don’t need anything.”
Another woman stepped forward. Her red dress was almost as long as her hair, and her eyes were intense, as sharp as knives. “You’re Sally, are you?”
“We’re going to stay in, order Chinese for lunch and Thai for supper, watch crap telly, catch up on Cabin Pressure and invite Mycroft, Greg, Molly and Mike over for tea.”
To John’s shock, that was Mycroft.
Last part of the trilogy will be up tomorrow!
“Looks like you’ll be getting what you want after all,” Sherlock said. Despite her initial gratitude, the two of them had spent most of their time together sniping at each other. Sherlock guessed it was because Sally was afraid he knew about her strictly forbidden dalliances with the idiotic guard Anderson. He did indeed know, but he hadn’t found a moment yet to tell her that of course he wouldn’t reveal that. The penalty was death, and as irritating as she was, the other Carriers were far worse.
“Don't do it, John,” Moriarty whispered. “Why bother? You'll be down there soon enough.”
Watson snapped. He reached forward and snatched the needle, tossing it on the table behind him. “What lie, Sherlock? Why would you lie to me about this.” He checked around him, but there were no sounds from downstairs. Mrs. Hudson must have gone to bed. “Sherlock, dear, tell me. What’s going through your mind?” He reached out and took hold of his lover’s shoulders, who shuddered under the touch.
(See the end of the chapter for
Count Magnussen thought. “I’ve heard rumours,” he said slowly, “of a man in a village with hair like darkest night and eyes like winter sun.”
Cheers,
“And you think Guilder will help?”
“Thank you, Grezzik.”
“Can you help me, young man?”
“North of Regalia could cause a problem,” Sukiv rasped. “Lord Banesworth of Nepce doesn’t like Jamiarty, but he’s a fanatic about the Right of the Crown.”
Ireni started to chant in a language that Molly didn't understand, and the chant ended with a flash of sunlight. Grezzik's arms went slack, and he dropped the bag he was holding. Molly caught it before it hit the ground.
Eventually, Kitty calmed down. "Maybe you ought to explain it, Mr. Holmes," she croaked. "I dunno if I can, now that it comes to it."
When the sun came up, Molly took one look at Sally’s still face and knew. “She’s dead.”
The man in black hurried to undo first the gag, then the blindfold. The Princess stared at him with wide eyes. “You’re immune.”
"We're going to take good care of them, sweet," she promised. "We'll make them comfortable, and then...well, then we'll see."
So this conversation takes place both post- and pre-sex, but that is not the focus of the chapter. Just wanted to give a heads up.
Sherlock was so wrapped in his own misery that he didn’t hear John come downstairs in the darkness, long after tea had been forgotten.  Didn’t notice him at all, in fact, until he was standing in the doorway of their room.
“Right, hello, Carin. My name’s John. I’m Princess Sherlock’s husband. We’re here to help with a coup.”
Images were coming through now—the gang of jewel thieves at the dock, the police not responding to their summons…Hopkins getting knocked down, the leader raising a knife…
And looked at his wedding ring.
), Maria drew her sword. “I’ll duel him left-handed.”
Molly’s eyes went wide, almost as much as the girl’s husband. But he turned and walked out without a word.
“…Goddamnit.”
“I mean under ten guests, even if everyone comes.”
emale and Male.”
Molly glanced toward the still shattered window and the mess of the living room. "Good luck."
“I didn’t know I would become one.”
Surprised, Mycroft raised his eyebrows. “Courage?”
"Yeah." John frowned as Molly smiled. "What?"
Holmes turned away. “It was no fault of your own, John. It was always my decision.”
"I hope you're right." The old man's voice was weak.
“They don’t have to come if you don’t them too,” he said gently.
A lovely spring day for the lovers. This is a few months after 'The Dream'.
John kissed his temple. "That's my job. Come on, let's get some rest."
Sherlock was sobbing now.
“Perhaps there can be an arrangement?”
When the chant died down, Cerise bent her head to the King and Queen, and they whispered together for a moment. Then Queen Bella stood up. “Today we have justice for my husband’s daughter. Now we must honour her life, in the way that she would wish.”
Sherlock walked from the palace steps towards the stables, letting people stare at him, let them brush their hands against his arms. They were so awed by his presence that none dared speak, which was good. He had no words for them. He had very few words to spare anymore.
“Good.” Mycroft’s tone was brusque. “It will take a couple of weeks to ensure our readiness.”
There was a pause.
“You are right, and with the wedding tonight…”
It took John a full twenty seconds to process the scene in front of him. There was Mycroft, and Greg…and considerably less clothing than normal.
Sherlock startled, and the crowd fell silent. The woman was old, bent with age, and her face was twisted with hate.
Lestrade shuffled as the guests chuckled. He was nervous, Sherlock could tell. He hadn’t really wanted to make the speech, but it was him or Mycroft, and Lestrade knew that Mycroft couldn’t do public speaking, not like this.
Molly listened as Moran outlined the plan, to use Waverly to start a war, and felt absolutely sick to her stomach. “Fucking monsters,” she snarled. “She’s an infant.”
Holmes chuckled, relief soothing the burn in his throat. "I don't understand why you always call it summoning."
"I don't want to," Billy whispered.
“Yes. You have my gratitude for my child.”
Anderson smiled at her. “I like that. It’s pretty.”
“I was…we were going to tell you.”
Sherlock's phone went off in the darkness, startling them all. Sherlock answered without looking at the Caller ID.
Kitty dropped by late one night in the middle of a summer storm. She accepted the hot tea John pressed on her without a fuss, so they knew something was up.
“Excellent. Now come on, we need to put some miles between us and the shore.” Ireni stalked off, doing nothing useful. As always.
Interesting. They hadn't seen the girl, which was peculiar. It was quite dark, but there were streetlights still, and someone climbing down (or up? still wasn't positive on that point) a building should have been noticed. But on the other hand, there were no sirens, no yelling outside other than Andrew, and if it wasn't for the broken window he wouldn't have guessed there was anything amiss outside.
—five years since the night the song was made whole, five years since the master knew his listener's heart, five years of love without longing.
"Kitty," John said calmly, "you need to drink your tea. You're going into shock."
Whatever they were doing, Holmes and Watson and Sherlock and John were finally safe, finally able to enjoy themselves and be happy without the scars of the past and without fear of discovery.
A small window in the door opened, and an old man’s face peeked out. “Beat it, alright? Or I’m calling the Brute Squad.”
Cheers, and thanks again,
**********
Greg didn’t say anything for a minute.
“No! Watson…John, stay with me! Can you hear me!”
table.
Even before they got together John was determined to find Sherlock a book that he would enjoy and not toss away. He started reading his favourite books aloud, with varying amounts of response from Sherlock. John almost gave up until he awoke from a two-day coma to Sherlock’s deep, shaky voice reading
Molly was wonderful. Within twenty minutes she was at their door with the twins, their old diaper bag slung over her shoulder. Jacob and Lily were three and had mastered the toilet years before, but it was just the right size for hiding extra clothes.
Without breaking eye contact, Sherlock took the ring and carefully slipped it on to John’s third finger. He raised John’s hand to his lips and kissed it tenderly. “We’re engaged,” he said, voice trembling.
“I’ve managed perfectly well until now, Doctor. Even after…well, but that’s done now.” Miss Winter shook her head.
John looked over at his husband. There was no mirth in Sherlock’s eyes, and his jaw was clenched tight.
“Not this time, lad,” Watson said firmly. “Your mother will murder you.”
Kitty can’t sing, but she can play the piano. The first thing she and Stan buy for their flat is an old piano, and they make music together.
Mollified, the judge sat back. “Continue, Miss Sorrel.”
“Sherlock!” Watson chastised, but he, too, looked surprised.
Cheers,
Absolutely no one paid for their meals that night at Angelo’s.
You see, while Anderson had been a spy, he knew that Riley and Jamiarty were buddy-buddy. So he’d developed a friendship with her, which developed into a romance by Riley’s choice. Anderson had gone along with it, partly because it gave him good information for Duke Mycroft, and partly because it provided cover for his relationship with Sally.
Uncle Sherlock and Uncle John were travellers, and Uncle John wrote about their travels. They always came back with amazing gifts and stories.
Molly thought the same thing when she fell asleep next to Janine. But the next morning she woke up to see Stam looking down at them, and knew there was more to be done.
“Hello,” Mycroft called. He didn’t look at all surprised to see them. “Good heavens, there’s a lot of you. You’ve made friends, little brother.”
After a few arguments in the kitchen (Molly had to intervene about the proper wine to have with the potatoes), they all gathered together at the table. Well, John allowed as he sat down, it was actually three tables jammed together, one from Mike and Molly’s, one Mycroft had delivered, and one that was actually a night table from the room upstairs.
Molly shook her head. “There are a few things wrong with that, my friend. In the first, it is
“He’s beaten Molly!” Grezzik whispered. His heart ached; Molly was his only friend. The Princess peered at the man in surprise.
“Come in.”
“No one can guarantee the safety of a woman and child in labour,” Max said bluntly. “No one ever has. Oh, there’s been improvements, there’s been medicine and healing…but it is still the hardest act a body can go through, and little things can turn into huge problems. It is not possible yet to make that pain worth it every single time. I’ve delivered dozens of living babies, and I’ve buried many dead ones, and many dead mothers. I buried yours, actually.”
“But think how much fun it’ll be to go back to work and watch them fumble apologies.”
When Molly Hooper was thirty-two, Sherlock Holmes met John Watson and Molly realized that she might lose Sherlock forever. She thought John was kind and good, of course, but not very interesting—goodness, Mike Stamford was more interesting. Part of her wanted to interfere between the two, but that would be mean, and she did love Sherlock enough to want him to be happy. Then she went on a date, then two, then three with Jim Moriarty, and learned that liking a psychopath was altogether too easy, and not at all a good idea.
“I don’t like
“Sherlock, I know you believe me worthy of such an honour, but I am not.”
“I don’t…I don’t know how to be without you,” Billy whispered. “You’ve shown me everything. And I’ll…who am I going to talk about vegetables with?” He wrapped his arms around the frail old man. “I’ll be okay though. Don’t worry about me, please.”
“I don’t suppose you could go faster?”
“See, you’re making rhymes again!” Grezzik said proudly. Then he remembered his second piece of news. “The six-fingered man is Count Magnussen. He lives in the castle with Humperdinck.”
“Come here, dear,” he called Sherlock. “Come and hold our granddaughter.”
“I couldn’t agree more, my dear…John.” Billy felt a strange lump in his throat; he’d never heard anyone’s name spoken with that much reverence. “Well, Billy, you’ll hear a story tonight you must never tell. Your Mum and Dad know most of it, but we never have told one part, not to anyone.”
Sally was having trouble finding her tongue. She looked helplessly at Molly.
“You wanted a dress? Love, you should have said something—”
“No.” John paused. “But Sherlock, think about Kitty’s biological family. From what she’s told us, they’re quite fortunate they’re dead and out of our reach. But she’s brilliant with kids.”
Sherlock shooed the twins off his knee. "Bring your biscuits in to Kitty," he instructed. His smile faded as the two rejoined Kitty under the cushions. "We don't have much time."
“Well, what my plan has been from the beginning, Johnny!” Moriarty smiled brightly. “Come on, walk with me.”
And people would boo.
(If, subconsciously, he was attempting to change the outcome, trying to forget the memory of another woman, smiling bravely through this pain and not uttering a whimper, he didn't realize).
“Will he continue to do so?”
Kitty was breathing hard.
Also, I am still taking prompts! Victorian or modern, either is fine; again, my only request is no porn--can't write it on technical grounds. If someone wants to write porn (or even other things) in this verse, or draw something...I mean, that would be awesome. Just link it to me so I can see it!
The other guard looked more nervous in the pre-dawn light. “Fine.”
“Sally!”
; words that came out not in the strings of a violin, but in the notes of a clarinet.
"Or else I'll tell Sherlock once he's calmed down that the best way he could show his support for you and Mycroft being together would be for him to stand in front of the entire Yard staff and make a declaration."
“I can protect Molly,” Grezzik promised.
“That’s the first time anyone’s dared insult me.”
“Let Waverly go,” Grezzik demanded.
“We should have dinner,” was all the Duke said. “Those of you who are leaving should leave at dawn. I’ll have bags packed.”
It was a lovely blue dress, but it did seem a bit…short for her.
The robe was so light Sally feared it would slip from her shoulders, so she held onto the ties.
Despite their best efforts, they didn't reach the capital until just after dusk. Ireni returned Grezzik's strength, and they parked the carriage at the edge of town.
“Sherlock, I will
“No more than an hour,” Martha answered. “But the contractions are coming faster than I’d like.”
Sherlock stood up. "I think you'd better get to bed, Kitty. John, will you help her get upstairs?"
And now Grezzik had a dilemma, because he didn’t want to confront the witch midair. Not only was it far more dangerous for Waverly, it was more dangerous for himself and Molly. But if he let the witch get too far ahead of them, she could lay traps.
I am proud of Kitty, but I am also proud of Stan. Confessing love is never easy, and loving someone with a difficult past is not easy, but if you can give someone the gift of a happy future, the effort is worth it. I am sure they will both know this soon.
“Please be careful, my darling,” Janine whispered.
Sherlock had understood that he was going to be married, and that he would be married to Prince Jamiarty. But today, standing on that balcony, he truly felt it. It was strange; he’d hardly felt anything in three years, even when his parents died a month apart.
Cheers, and Happy New Year's once again,
“Stay and see.” The woman put a coin down by her plate and got up to leave.
“Right. Well…I know where Max is.”
“There was nothing you could have done.” John tried to protest but Sherlock held firm. “John, they hurt you. They made you think you were nothing. You were very lonely, weren’t you?”
“And now,” Anderson continued as if he hadn’t heard, “I accidentally married the King’s illegitimate daughter, and she’ll be Queen if,
“Sherlock?”
The wail came again, louder now.
“See you soon!”
"Call me an idiot, call me a desperate slut, call me whatever you like," Kitty all but snarled, "but yes, I have been. Believe me, I've paid for it." She was starting to hyperventilate.
And Kitty did. But she said no to Molly's offer of a room in their house, preferring to move in with some flatmates.
Sherlock put a hand on John’s arm. “Anderson, John’s right. If you don’t talk to each other, you’ll begin to drift apart. Life will give you reasons to separate, don’t make up reasons of your own.”
Grezzik approached Maria. “Be careful, Molly. People in masks can’t be trusted.”
“He definitely would have.” Sherlock was on his feet now, pacing. “If he called her a friend, that meant she actually spoke with him in confidence. Which means that even if this wasn’t the plan, he won’t be shocked. He’ll just go after her, hunt her down with the child.”
“I’ll create some magical distractions within the Castle grounds,” Ireni explained. “Chessa, Sukiv and the Hudsons will stay here to keep the villagers from coming to the Castle.”
“To hells with useful! We care for you, Grezzik. All of us.”
So yes, Molly and Grezzik are the #DreamTeam, and Prince Jamiarty continues to be the worst.
But as Molly spoke, the bird began to shift.
‘Because You Loved Me’, very popular for father-daughter dances (or any parent-child tribute, really).
Before he could think, Sherlock threw himself down the cliff, down after the still rolling man in black.
“Quite.” Sukiv’s voice was almost as musical as Riley’s. “And right now it looks as though Jamiarty is inviting conflict. Is the child alright, Princess?”
“So tweasure your wuv, forewer and ewer…”
Maria got to her feet, every breath a blast of fire in her lungs, but she was up, and she raised her sword.
Holmes beamed when he saw him, and the brothers clasped arms. “Hello, Mycroft.”
“What, there are people who wish to be asleep at this hour?” Watson queried, reaching for his trousers. “Imagine that.”
Sometimes love is simply happy, and those occasions deserve note.
John froze. Sally being smart wasn't part of the plan. She was meant to be the police officer who hated Sherlock enough to set things in motion. That was all.
Hopkins looked like he wanted to protest, but kept his mouth shut.
Also, if anyone wants to write the 'after the fade to black'...you are heartily welcome. For either timeline. Seriously, just send me a link so I can read it. Blanket permission.
King Philip smiled. “No, sweet. They’ll be here soon, but they ate when they left this morning.”
“A few hours’ sail,” Sherlock answered. He was lying with John in his arms, his bridal gown shimmering in the darkness. “We’ll still be ahead of our enemies.”
“I never said I do!” Sherlock snapped.
In that day and age, autopsies were much more thorough, able to tell many certainties where once there were only guesses. When Sherlock and John first met, you could tell time of death within a span of hours.
“I’m on the Brute Squad,” Grezzik said, stepping into view.
were interested in him. Who on earth cared about
“No.”
“Which leads to Guilder.” Janine’s eyes were fiery. “She can’t imagine she could hide there either.”
"She reminds me a lot of you. Of both of you, actually."
“I’m sorry,” Grezzik apologized. “I’m not always very clear. What confused you?”
“Good afternoon, Dr. Watson!” Mycroft Holmes was as large as ever, his gray eyes still piercing, but his handshake was friendly enough. “Would you care for tea?”
“I forgot that was the lie I went with,” Holmes said when the sound stopped, turning his attention back to the needle.
Holmes clapped. “Capital, Watson!”
John watched in surprise as he offered his arm to Mycroft Holmes, who took it. The two walked out, stately as kings.
“I will. After I have ridden.”
"Sherlock, I don't have a choice."
“Are Mama and Papa awake yet?”
And, to his delight, she was also a detective, though she wasn't doing so much running about now since he was born.
“Sherlock, dear,” John said, speaking slowly and clearly, “this is what we do. We solve crimes together. Sounds like a fun case…”
Her brother, Prince Sukiv, had come from Regalia. The underground kingdom technically existed within Guilder’s borders, but they lived so far down no one bothered. Sukiv had a heavy hood and wore thick gloves to protect himself from the sun.
Mycroft observed Lestrade as they stood together. He had no idea of how long it had been since he’d died. All he knew that today was the first time he’d seen Gregory.
“I was a child, and Jamiarty hadn’t met Seb yet. It’s possible. And she wasn’t lying…”
Sherlock woke in a panic, eyes still squeezed shut.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft said. He put his hand on his brother’s shoulder, eyes bright. “It is
John pressed a light kiss to Sherlock’s lips and closed his eyes. They could get up later.
John smiled. "We may be able to let you know right now."
Sherlock still rants about it sometimes.
“Tell me about it. I’ve been mostly dead, and my husband went from a dairy farmer to a Princess.” John squeezed Sherlock’s hand. “We should get moving.”
Sherlock laughed. “We’ll try not to be too…fluttery.” He was entirely too giddy this morning. He couldn’t
When they wake up, they're somewhere very different.
When they got to the little cottage Kitty almost burst into tears. There were two strange women there. They introduced themselves as Mrs. Riley and her daughter Gertie. Her fathers had written about them occasionally, and Kitty was grateful that the women had been there to help, but she had an idea about the damage they'd caused. Her fears were confirmed when she went inside and found Holmes in the guest room, shaking miserably, and Watson in the other room. The other bed was turned over to look like a table, a security feature Stan had insisted on when he built the cottage beds. Kitty had always hoped her fathers would never feel so cornered, and certainly not when they were deathly ill. Who'd fallen ill first, she wondered, and who knew that they couldn't be found together?
John laughed out loud. "I think that's the best idea you've ever had, husband. Come on, I've got a list of things I've thought up, since this is a special occasion."
Cheers,
Sherlock stopped speaking.
John reached over and took his hand. "Sherlock, you okay?"
“Which isn’t that much. I had a very pleasant month with you.”
“Sherlock, you have to hurry—I've done something terrible!”
John pressed a kiss to Sherlock's forehead, wishing dearly that they were in a fairy tale, and his love could soothe Sherlock's anguished brain. "What number are you at?"
“What?”
Across from that fancy table was a plain wooden table, and Jamiarty was chained to it.
“We need to get there—” Sally cut herself off and pointed. “Look!”
Moran had been removed from the chair, replaced with Riley. Jamiarty’s best friend was now in the dungeon, safe and secure. Stam had volunteered to watch him, but Janine had refused. “You were in the inner circle once,” she told him. “We’re going to need yours and Sally’s help most of all.”
“Wonderful. Henry’s going to do the same thing, and tomorrow we’re going to figure out what the drug is and where it came from.”
“Exactly. Mycroft has a certain level of protection, but he…doesn’t. He’s more hands on, my little brother.” Sherlock turned to Mrs. Hudson. “What did he say?”
“What time is it?”
After nearly three years of thinking Sherlock didn’t love him, having a dream Sherlock who loved him, really loved him, was more than enough to keep him patient. His opportunity would come.
“Best of luck.” The man got to his feet.
“As the stars,” Ireni promised. She winked at Waverly, who giggled. She had a guess what they would do last night, and while it was safe, it would certainly make plenty of noise.
Sherlock cracked a smile at that. “I suppose.” He looked over his shoulder at the table. “Well, I have the necessary equipment to do those tests you mentioned.”
"Not just you."
John leaned away from him, just enough to make it seem natural. “I don’t think so, not really. She’s quite a bit older than me, you know.”
“And get past sixty men, the Prince and all the rest of his guards in the process,” Miracle Max retorted. “That doesn’t sound safe, and he’s not going to be at full strength, you realize.”
"We'll sort it out," he said brusquely. "Whatever it is, I promise you."
“I deny these charges,” Jamiarty answered. He sounded just as bored as he looked. “Any action I took last night, Father, was on false information. I had heard from a reliable source that the Carrier whore was going to stage a coup. It seems as though it was true.”
Martha gasped. “It can’t be…”
"It appears to be a mingling of both of our favourite places," Holmes said thoughtfully. "I rather like it. I'm not quite sure what that is, though." He pointed to the television.
Mary sighed. She’d hoped to avoid thinking about the man until after she was Mrs. Watson, after she had crossed the last hurdle.
“What did you say?”
Sherlock kissed John. “I’ll be back soon.”
"You wouldn't."
When the song was called
There were chains attached to each wrist, and chains attached to a collar around his neck. There were chains at his ankles too, and his knees were attached to the chair by rope. Stam stood next to him with a knife.
So it was true. Sally looked down at her daughter, who was probably so confused by the last few hours, so bewildered by the suddenly strange.
“And mine to yours,” John answered, before he was pulled back into the dark, dank room with the leaky faucet. But he was resting in Sherlock’s shaking arms, and Kitty was sobbing “Dad, Dad, Dad!” over and over again. Perhaps it wasn’t such a terrible place after all.
"Make them get it right," he said, surprising himself. "Show them that who you are matters, that you can be better than all of them while you're still solving your own case. You'll be fine, lad."
Prince Jamiarty slipped off his horse. “I am your Prince and you will marry me.”
“Alright.” Jamiarty kissed her hand. “We’ll punish him, dear. Don’t you worry.”
Greg whistled cheerfully as he came into work that Wednesday morning. He waved to Dimmock, sorted his paperwork without the usual groaning, and was pleasant to everyone who spoke to him, even Anderson.
Justice is served...though not in a court of law.
to be the parent of my children, to be the companion of my house.
“A good detective,” Sherlock allowed, though I saw his gaze harden as Kitty took the bag from Hopkins, her hand brushing against his. “Any official business, Hopkins?”
“There are sixty men at the gate,” Stam said with a grimace.
“We don’t need to be quite so subtle now; speed is of the essence. So we came by ship and disguised ourselves only so we could get through without spies knowing for sure that—”
“You’re in love with her, yes? And you’re married?
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well in that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.”
Alarming, certainly. But it wasn’t until the figure burst into flames and continued to roll towards them, that everyone began to shout.
Queen Chessa frowned at the map. “Well, we can assume those in the room are safe…” her voice trailed off, and she looked sternly at them all. “Right?”
“Well—you write too many words.”
And now she was the one pushing back, still scoring no hits, but breaking through the defenses, wearing down the man in black. And now he was the one with his back to the Cliffs, up a set of stairs and onto an ancient lookout.
Dear oh dear! What could possibly happen next?
“There’s nothing to explain. You’re trying to take my stolen goods, and I don’t appreciate it.”
Mike had resigned himself to a single life well before he introduced John to Sherlock. He just didn’t see why anyone would put up with him.
And just like that, Sally stopped being afraid.
Stan loves Jane Eyre, but hates Wuthering Heights. Kitty allows this as a compromise. They both enjoy Jane Steele when it comes out.
“I deny it. Your daughter’s death was sad, I suppose, but she was sick.”
"I don't know whose side to take," Sherlock confessed. John nodded. Kitty, of course, was their daughter, and had been for nearly three years now. But Stan, though newer, had no family other than Dimmock, who was currently busy trying to decide between a college boyfriend and a new lady. They couldn't just stop letting him come over.
I rolled my eyes. “It’s really quite simple. If you have a family background it will be easier for you to obtain lodgings in a safer part of town. You will also be questioned less if people believe that you have a family to live with but have made the choice to live apart for reasons of independence.”
“Unfortunately,” the King said grimly. “We’ll need to get past my son.”
Ireni laughed. “You only think I guessed wrong, that’s what’s funny! I switched glasses while your back was turned! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders. The most famous is never get involved in a land war in Asia. But only slightly less well known is this: never go in against a Sicilian, when death is on the line!”
Holmes glanced up. He and Watson had spent the last two hours exploring the ship and then attempting to find their bags, which had mysteriously disappeared from where they’d left them. A deckhand had finally told them that their belongings were safe but they weren’t to disturb the several locked rooms. It was enormously frustrating, and if Mycroft had not been aboard the ship Holmes would have taken Watson and escaped via on of the lifeboats.
The man in black put his sword down. “I appreciate the offer, but I believe my chances may be slightly better hand fighting.”
“Sherlock, dear, what’s going on?” John said drowsily.
Sherlock thought that would have to do. What could you expect from a poor farm boy?
Mycroft stifled a smile. Kitty’s children had inherited their mother’s spirit and their father’s earnest, innocent eyes. It was a powerful combination.
“Alright, dear,” John said quietly. “You saw it, the way Henry did. What did it look like?”
Cheers,
Mike is insanely proud of Molly. Molly is insanely proud of Mike. When they get drunk, they try to outdo each other with praise.
“Yes,” Molly murmured. “You’re right. I need her better. I need the man in black.”
The figures behind Janine removed their hoods, and Molly recognized Queen Chessa and Prince Sukiv, along with Miracle Max and Martha.
Grezzik wasn’t smart enough to understand how he and Waverly were so connected. He didn’t even remember the night of her birth; only the scar on Sally’s stomach and Waverly herself were proof that anything had happened at all. Something must have happened when he saved her life, something…could it be magic?
Mike cleared his throat. “I now pronounce you husbands.” He grinned as he paused for another moment; John glared at him indignantly. “Alright, you can snog if you want.”
“No, but you did discuss it with Greg Lestrade. And at Scotland Yard, too. Dear me, Dr. Watson, dear me!”
Lestrade pulled away in shock, but Sherlock simply patted his shoulder and joined John a few feet from the round tea table. There was a speaker on a table near the wall, and Lestrade, after wiping his eyes, walked over and pressed a few buttons on the iPod.
“You’re the one who took your eyes off your future.”
John bustled around the kitchen, trying to finish the last of the food amongst Sherlock’s latest experiment. “You’d better clean this up, love.”
They never go to bed angry. They’re both too scared of waking up to an empty bed.
“We’re all here, aren’t we? It’ll be alright, Sal.”
“Holmes?” Watson asked.
Cheers,
A Fire Swamp, a ravine and a couple mile’s run away, Grezzik huddled among the rocks. He’d come to just in time to hear the soldiers, and he’d hidden, but what good was that? Where was he supposed to go? If Molly was dead, he didn’t want to go back to Ireni, but Ireni was better than nothing…
The small church was crowded with off-duty policemen, several of the scrubbed-up Irregular lads and a few of her friends from boarding school. John was probably (hopefully) at the altar, waiting with his best man, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
“Nothing.” John wished his hands were free, but they couldn't spare the lock-picking time. “I'm just...I want this over.”
Since the King had been ill, they’d only spoken a few times, the last when she was chosen as Jamiarty and Sherlock’s Carrier. And before his illness, they still had only seen each other about once a month. And tomorrow she would face him, and confirm if she was his daughter.
“But Molly, we don’t know where he is!”
Unfortunately, the child wasn’t born
The four left the cottage.
“How…ah.” Watson’s brow furrowed. “Women are like this openly too?”
“Thank you. I’ve worked for it.”
“Yes. Sally’s given birth.”
“Alright,” Billy said easily. He could tell he’d upset his grandfather. “Tell me about your bees, Grandfather Sherlock.”
He landed on top of John, and kissed every inch of his face. “Oh, my dear, you’re here!”
Watson started shaking. Alarmed, Holmes stopped walking, drew him into an alley. “John? What—” Then he glared as Watson burst out laughing. “This isn’t funny!”
Unbeknownst to anyone except Watson, Kitty went to see Gruner in prison. She didn’t speak, just watched him look around blindly, demanding to know who was laughing.
John, unfortunately, was not on the
Anderson bowed his head. “Before we were together, Sally. I was a spy, I needed information. And she was always so cold about it. We spent a lot of time together, but she always refused romance and…and kindness. She just wanted to talk and fuck.”
“Some of them are on the Brute Squad, so…perhaps ten? Twelve, if they were slow.”
Jamiarty was still awake, deep in conversation with Moran and Count Magnussen, who Sherlock ignored immediately.
“Yes. Sally’s safe. You did it, my friend.” Molly patted his arm. “Wait, she?”
“Yeah, him and his husband.”
Watson chuckled. “Oh, believe me, we’ve all heard it. John, can you get it set up?”
“You may use my first name, Dr. Watson.”
John spun. Holmes was staring slack jawed at Mycroft and Greg.
Sherlock reached out hesitantly to touch John's face. “I knew it would be awful for you,” he admitted, “but I tried to tell myself that you thinking I was dead was better than me really being dead. Or you being...either is unacceptable.”
“What was unclear about that?”
But not the kind that Max did, where he coaxed plants and medicine to their fullest potential. No, this was the kind that scraped at bones and souls, the kind that was drawn from deep caves and high mountains.
“Jamiarty has no Veritas,” Anderson said. “I checked that.”
“As…you…wish.”
“Who said I was buying?”
Sherlock didn't seem in a rush to talk when he arrived home. He chatted with the twins, consulted on the fort that Kitty was building to be the dragon's cave, and even asked Molly if she and Mike's garden was turning out properly this summer.
Then Sherlock remembered. “Oh no, I…John, can you forgive me?”
Holmes replied.
“Because I just called Brook, to tell him that I knew what he was doing and—” Sally choked. “He thanked me, he said that I'd helped him to get right to the heart of the matter, and that he'd take care of John. And I know that means—”
It was over before Mike and Molly could get there with pain relief and paramedics, but John never forgot that hour. He’d treated friends and family before, treated Sherlock with hands that stayed steady until it was over, but this was something different. This pain had a purpose; the real agony had been the years of suffering his daughter had endured, the despair his son had felt. It was terrifying, delivering without tools, in a still messy bedroom, but somehow John knew everything was going to be alright.
“Of course.” Janine was there now. She went to Molly and took her hands. “I am glad you are all back. Where is the witch?”
“I do,” Jamiarty said hurriedly.
“It’s my business to know, especially about you,” Sherlock replied.
“Waverly,” Molly suggested.
In case you haven't seen it yet, the sequel, Sally's Baby, is now posting! It's the next work in the series, and here's the direct link: http://archiveofourown.org/works/13862772/chapters/31889805
Her left hand was already at her wound, and she drove it deeper, holding it together as best she could, and she pushed against the wall, helping her rise.
Dreading the scene he’d find, Watson climbed the stairs, his leg twinging painfully. He ignored it; rain always made it hurt, and the exertion of the night had been pointless, why bother coddling it? If he’d only been faster…
“Congratulations,” he finally remembered to say. “I’m glad for both of you.”
When they reached their silent flat, John attempted to let go of Sherlock's hand.
John understood. He feinted towards the rat, leaping back just in time so the lunging rat took the brunt of the flame. It died with the same horrible shriek.
“When Jamiarty was ten, a girl of seven died. She was his half-sister. Riley was given Veritas, and she claimed that he murdered her.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Speaking from personal experience, Doctor?”
“Where’s Anderson?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock took just enough time to throw on a pale blue robe before he sprinted down the castle hall.
John looked up at him in shock. “How did you know?”
Watson knew that there was nothing they could have done. They were called in too late, the police hadn’t even been notified until the husband was taken as well…Mrs. Brown had been fearful, taking hours to tell them who she suspected…and she’d been right, but they were far away by then.
Sherlock drew in his breath. "You've been involved with the Gardener?"
Cheers,
“Of course, my lord.” Grezzik followed Mycroft into the library. “What can I do for you?”
Watson chuckled, then winced. “How poetic,” he managed.
Watson does write poetry sometimes, very badly. There was one very good piece, written at three in the morning in frustration as he tried to sort out his love for his dead wife and his love for his living husband. Entitled simply ‘Two Halves’, it tells the story of a man who was never made to choose and therefore got both his heart’s desires, yet fears he deserves neither.
“Dear daughter,” he whispered.
Stan wasn’t born female. The idea of being a different gender than his sex was unthinkable; then again, so was the idea of two men in love.
“I never thought I would have the courage,” Lestrade said.
John yanked off his tie and threw it on Mycroft's sofa. Mycroft shot him a glare, but John was past caring. The day at court had exhausted him. Moriarty had looked his way every chance he got, a horrible smirk on his face. The rest of the time he was staring at Sherlock, but John couldn't see his expression. He wasn't sure which was worse.
Molly turned. Sherlock and John were standing at the door. The crowd parted to let them through. Sherlock was carrying a bracelet in his hand, and Cerise covered her mouth with her hands.
“Oh?” Sherlock asked. “Our phones have been off.”
Sherlock threw on a long coat and rushed outside, his feet crackling through broken leaves. The moon was high over Watson’s hovel. There was candlelight under the door, and Sherlock banged on it.
John stood in front of him, hands in his pockets. His eyes looked funny, though they weren’t red. He’d probably not been blinking enough, Sherlock deduced—John did that when he was upset, it was one of his tells.
“NO!”
“Dear, can you move at all?”
Moriarty was gone.
"We'll do it, if you want," John said firmly. "Why don't we mingle for a while and then pretend we've got some write-ups to do? Then we can go home."
Kitty looked away. "I'm a prostitute."
“Well…” Watson said slowly. “We can hold dinner for a while. Are you two at all fond of Midsomer Murders?”
For annegirlblythe, whose request helped me shape this chapter.
It was a reasonable question. The conflict between Florin and Guilder had been going on at different levels for centuries. Open war was a thing of the past, and Janine admitted that her parents were tired of the fight, but justifying a war against Guilder would be easy for Jamiarty to slide under the rug.
And a shot rang out.
Reminder that prompts are still up and open!
It was strange—six months ago, Molly would have predicted she’d be fighting a war right now, not helping deliver a child. After all, she’d participated in the kidnapping of Prince Jamiarty’s intended, and killed his best friend. True, the best friend had murdered her father twenty years before, and the Prince was going to kill Sherlock, but Jamiarty was never one to understand subtleties.
“Waverly,” Sally crooned. Her eyes were drifting shut again, and Molly could tell this time it was because she was going to sleep. “Our Waverly.”
Yes, a rope. And he started to climb.
“You’re not?” Now Grezzik was thoroughly confused, and a little afraid.
“I’m concerned about you,” Mycroft replied. “I believe I misunderstood you earlier.”
Waverly flushed. “I didn’t really curse them. The curse wasn’t a real one, and I’ve no magic. But for a minute I…I felt like I did, and it made me brave. And when he stumbled and fell…well. I was free. I didn’t really care how it happened.”
And Ireni stood before them.
“Rest assured, Doctor, that Sherlock informed me himself of the new…nature of your relationship.”
Next chapter is the reception, the best man speech and the dance. Cheers, Acme.
“It’s weird that way,” Ireni muttered. She wasn’t sweating—the sun didn’t bother her. But she was sure Waverly needed to cool off.                 S
Footsteps came from down the hall, and Watson tensed. A tall, pale man clothed in a strange robe walked in and did a double-take. “Who are you?”
In the end, he didn’t have to make a choice.
, John.” Sherlock stared at him desperately.
“I know.” The King looked him in the eyes. “And you killed my daughter.”
Sally shut her eyes. She couldn’t think about Waverly. She couldn’t.
To his shock, the albino answered.
Sherlock rushed to the chair and grabbed hold of some scarves. “Your name is Stam?”
“Inconceivable!” Ireni stamped her foot. “Give him to me.”
“You can relax, Princess.” The giant’s voice rumbled through Sherlock’s body. “I will keep you safe.”
"She's doing beautifully," Watson said with no small amount of relief. The wild-eyed, delighted young woman upstairs was miles from the shadow of his wife after giving birth to their daughter. "Come on up, then, so you can meet your son, and see about getting your wife some rest."
This is John and Sherlock's first anniversary, very early on in other words.
Raz’s eyes widened. “Princess? Is that you?”
Watson felt the blood drain from his face. He’d never heard this voice before, but by the way Holmes’ hand was suddenly tightly in his...he was right.
“I need a sword. One I may use with all my fingers.”
“Regalia already has people on their way,” Sukiv growled. “They’ll be on the London border by sundown.”
John whirled again, wanting to thank James, but to his surprise the man was already gone. He walked slowly towards the door, stopping only for a second to bend down and check Moriarty’s pulse. Gone. Done. It was strange to see the consulting criminal so still so…so human, despite his best efforts.
Set during 'The Hounds of Baskerville'. A different take on Sherlock's reaction to seeing "the hound".
John laughed and relaxed.
Sally nodded. It was stupid, she supposed. “I just…I’ve felt so weak and useless since she was born. And Grezzik is always so capable.”
“We would have had two more years together,” John whispered. “And my foolish pride…I couldn’t even go and check. If I’d seen you…”
Mummy shook her fist at him, but she was smiling so big Billy knew it was a joke. "Why'd you tell him the story about Lady Frances?"
Ireni took the bag and pulled the drawstrings open. A white powder lay inside, and she sniffed carefully.
Holmes had already dashed up the stairs and Watson took a moment to prepare himself. The last six months had seen great progress in his quest to wean Holmes off the needles, but this kind of case, and the horrible ending were exactly the kind of events that promised a setback.
Mike and Molly become the hottest topic of discussion at St. Bart’s. It changes to ‘ohmigod did you see Sherlock Holmes punch out that bloke for saying Molly settled?’
By the time the Council had convened, Riley had changed her clothes back into her Guard uniform. Her face was often cited as ‘too pretty to be a guard’, but those who spoke to her knew that the pretty face concealed a poison tongue. No one wanted to be on Riley’s bad side, so everyone tried to be friends with her.
Now I know I said Kitty, but I realized I needed to establish one last couple first. Cheers, Acme
Sherlock couldn’t watch for long, but he kept sneaking looks at the man. He was getting closer now, and Sherlock could see that he wore a mask across the top half of his face.
“Are you sure you want to use that?” Janine asked. She still didn’t like it.
“Did you fuck her?” Sally asked.
“What was that?” Prince Jamiarty asked.
“I love you.”
Prince Jamiarty grabbed him, yanked him into his arms and ran down the hall to Sherlock’s room. “That was a mistake,
“Billy?”
And when she sat on the throne, the weight was nothing.
John covered his face with his hands. “I’m so, so sorry.”
The wedding started twenty whole minutes early, but Sherlock didn’t mind. John could just as easily be early, and he would be looking his best. He’d designed the wedding costume back when he was committed to the marriage, and it was lovely. Diamond blue and shining, it draped his body well, and contrasted beautifully with the pearl-encrusted tiara.
“Watson, you are utterly missing the point.” Holmes tried and failed to light his pipe.
“Perhaps…” Janine blushed. “We can discuss this when all is settled.”
Cheers,
"I'm up on the roof," he whispered. He saw Sherlock look up, could almost make out the confused horror on his face.
"People say that it's wrong. What if God thinks it's wrong too?"
“Strong horses.”
Kitty bowed her head. "Her name's Delia, but he's started calling her Violet. She's...she's not like me. She's...dainty." Kitty stared out the broken window for a moment."
“You’re one to talk, Philip.” Riley’s voice sharpened. “You kept a lot from me.”
Miracle Max traced the birthmark. “Put your money away. I don’t charge for family.”
John watched them go with a fond smile. He turned to Greg, who he was surprised to see was scowling. "What?" he asked, suddenly apprehensive. Greg surely wouldn't have hired someone if he had problems with their gender identity, would he?
“Hello?”
“Then it’s a promise. We keep each other alive, and we will always look for a way to be together. Sound alright?”
“Damn it!” Ireni cursed loudly. “Bring the boat around.”
It should have only been an hour ride, but the effort to avoid leaving a trail took an extra hour, and allowing Molly and John occasional breaks took another. But they were still well within their deadline when they got to Stam’s boat.
The Count stared at her curiously. “Are you…are you that little Spanish bitch I taught a lesson to all those years ago?”
Stan blushed. “Yeah. Um, no rush or anything.”
“Thank you, Jamiarty.” To his own surprise, Sherlock found himself kissing Jamiarty’s cheek, and letting his ex-fiancé hold him for a moment. “I’ll go write that letter.”
“Don’t be stupid,” Jamiarty said. He had to make a decision, and make it fast. “You can’t resign. I will need you when I’ve conquered Guilder.”
“I liked your other story better. Why don’t we just ask him—what’s his name, anyways?”
“Ah. I did take that ship. But there were many women aboard.”
Still scowling, John shuffled into the kitchen. In the fifteen minutes since he’d left their room, Sherlock had somehow managed to get dressed, get up without disturbing him in the loo, and make tea and toast.
“I can cope with whatever they throw at me.”
Then he smiled. “Prince Philip and Princess Sally!” he shouted.
(Literally all of my stories have Mystrade, that's the joke).
“Sundrops,” she breathed. The rarer cousins of moonblossoms, they grew only in the south.
John shook his head. "We need to move tonight. Is there any way we can move it up?"
Holmes threw his hands up. “Who else is here?”
“Oh, I know when I’m beaten,” Ireni said amiably. “Fair play to him; love is supposed to be powerful. I’d destroy anyone that got in my way too. So what’s Jamiarty doing now?”
Sherlock gets a migraine. John is there to help.
John drew in a deep breath and continued to stare at the floor. Dimly he realized that the music had stopped playing and that meant everyone had just heard that and he shouldn't have ever said that in front of people but the words couldn't stop once they started coming because they'd been in his head for so long, even before they became lovers, and...
They are due to be married in November. Hopkins has asked Sherlock to be his best man, and Kitty wishes for me to escort her. Kitty knows about us now. She has promised not to say a word, and calls our arrangement ‘frightfully romantic’. I am not entirely sure this is a compliment.
Kitty buried her face in her hands. They would have to do this alone; Wiggins was swamped in London with Stan down here, and the few other Irregulars who knew about Holmes and Watson were all busy with their children. Kitty's heart ached; before last year, Mrs. Hudson would have been an option, but the kind old lady had died last spring. Mycroft Holmes was also in the graveyard, not far from Watson's wife, as per his dying request. Kitty knew what he was trying to accomplish, but she didn't want to think about those preparations, about trying to decide where anyone else was buried.
“Excellent. Then you deserve your present. We worked especially hard on it.”
“No,” John said firmly. Greg wasn’t surprised. “Sherlock said I could have what I wanted—I’m fairly certain he’d be willing to rent Buckingham Palace—but I just want something small.”
They had the rings, the reception was ready, and it was exactly 3 PM, the time they met.
“No, you bastard. I won't leave him, not willingly. I promised.” John slipped into a fighting stance. “You want me dead? You kill me.” Maybe, just maybe he had a chance. If he could push Moriarty off the side…
The next three days went by in a pain-filled blur.
“I never meant to hurt you, Riley. You told me you didn’t love me. That’s why I wooed you. I knew you weren’t going to have feelings for me.”
“What?”
“I would have protected you.”
Sherlock entered the suite. It was a lovely room, supposedly, but Sherlock hardly saw it. Sally was there, her eyes huge.
Sherlock felt John grip his hand tight, and he clutched back, fingers suddenly trembling. Everyone looked rather misty; even Mycroft had a handkerchief moved within easy reach.
(See the end of the chapter for
This is waaaaaaayyyyy into the future for Victorian--don't fret, there'll be moments in between.
The performance group fired him at last. They were being booed now, and they could see they wouldn’t get much more out of Grezzik. They left him sitting on a rock in Greenland, all alone in the loneliest country in the world.
“Fierce, short and unstoppable?” Molly asked when he was gone.
The two went up the stairs together. Hopkins was lying on the bed, cradling his wife and child close, staring at his son with a tenderness that brought tears to Watson's eyes. The boy—for really, he would always be the young boy detective hanging on Holmes' every word and stumbling over praise when he brought Kitty flowers—seemed charged with joy, his face determined and gentle at the same time.
Sherlock looked hesitant.
Sherlock took John's hand. "My husband's not quite used to this sort of entry, miss..."
But…there was also Sherlock Holmes.
This chapter's going to start off a small Mystrade trilogy (don't worry, John and Sherlock will feature in both timelines.) The next chapter will be up tomorrow, and the third on Christmas Day. Happy reading!
For her people.
“You were recovering from being mostly dead,” Anderson pointed out. “Don’t be hard on yourself.”
Grezzik made to run, but now the fire was behind him. Waverly was struggling in his arms.
Also, I forgot to ask this last chapter, but did anyone recognize the names of the foreign dignitaries and their countries? If you did, congrats, you and I have read the same books :)
“How soon?”
Then Waverly screamed. Grezzik bent forward immediately, worried that they might be the kind of ants that bite. To his horror, he saw that the ants were catching fire one by one, all down the line.
This is a terrible joke based on the fact that the word lesbian is a reference to Sappho, a lesbian poet from Lesbos (and others like her).
“Good. Now, how the EVERLOVING FUCK did you ever think I'd agree to something like this?!”
The Count screamed and fell dead at her feet, dead of fear.
Sherlock took John's hands in his; they were trembling now. John was starting to get very scared indeed.
Moriarty shrugged. “It was inevitable, really. You crave danger, he craved an audience. Throw in a little UST—the Virgin learning how bodies worked, wish my cameras didn't break in your bedroom, I would have loved to see that! Two junkies choosing to fuck each other instead of fucking each other over, isn't that how your story has gone?”
But Sherlock was here. That was all that mattered.
John smiled. “Now this is why I love you.”
Moran was still tied to a chair, but he wasn’t exactly trying to get out. He was slumped in his bonds, the same position he’d been in since Stam had brought him up.
Seven years after Billy’s born, to their complete surprise (Watson laughs and asks them what they could expect; it was bound to happen the way they ‘carried on’) Kitty becomes pregnant again. She delivers a daughter; they name her Rachel for Stan’s sister.
He left Maria covered by his Brute’s cloak and went hunting for buckets. He filled one with icy cold water, and heated a kettle near to boiling to fill the other. Then, as gently as he could, Grezzik began dunking Molly’s head, first in one bucket, then another, making sure he gave her two seconds in between to breathe.
Cheers,
“I will.”
“Which is?”
I chuckled. “Agreed.”
“And how, exactly, is it?”
Too bad. It's happening anyways.
This one's actually a bit personal; it was on a similar kind of visit to my aunt's cottage that I discovered she was with a woman I thought was her friend (the amount of people didn't match the number of beds). Their wedding anniversary is coming up, so this one's for them.
“What, Ireni?” Maria asked. “Did you forget your hat?”
Kitty nodded, then turned her back to him, clutching the pillow to her. "Goodnight, Doctor."
Kudos to Willow for seeing it coming :) Your squinty eyes were valid, my dear.
“Then I will be the happiest man on earth for the rest of my life.”
(See the end of the chapter for
you have a child together?”
John craned his neck. “Looks like morning. I can check my phone—”
“Sally, is that you?”
Sherlock gave him a Look.
John pressed on. “This is where Jennifer Wilson died, right?”
Well, that wraps up this part of Kitty's story--don't worry, there'll be more to come down the road (cough Stan cough). Just to be clear, it's hard to adopt a 24 year old girl without a birth certificate, but having the British Government as your older brother does have some nice perks.
John had lost track of time ages ago.
"I'll be there with you," Sherlock promised. "Every step of the way."
But they weren’t Jamiarty’s. He’s always had small hands, but these hands weren’t his. There was a mark in the left palm; it looked like a scar.”
Angelo turned.
Holmes gripped his brother’s arm. “It’s good to see you, Mycroft.”
John looked flummoxed, but he let Sherlock take him by the hand, and they left the dungeon together.
Stan often consults with Kitty on cases he gets stumped with. When the two of them can’t come up with an answer after a pot of tea, they go to Holmes and Watson.
"Lovely. Although now I'm concerned about my husband."
It was still three weeks away, and the King was fine.
“I’m not now,” John whispered. “And death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.”
Sherlock took his hand, bright eyes worried. “He knows. He just doesn’t understand why.”
Watson couldn’t believe his ears. “You would retire?”
Hope you enjoyed, and shout out to Willow_Angel for the request!
“Then come on. We’ll brave the Swamp together.”
“No particular reason other than custom. That’s what the Duke of London has always done.”
If some of you think Ireni's method of resurrection is familiar, that's because it is. I borrowed it from Supernatural.
John bit his lip hard.
IS EVERYONE READY FOR REICHENBACH?!
“I’m your son!” Jamiarty spat as John dragged him to his feet.
Sherlock didn’t speak as the King and Queen escorted him to the honeymoon suite.
Waverly blinked awake, and broke into a smile. “Shade!”
“But will the Duke see that? Will Princess Janine see that?”
“Decent reasons,” John said. He kept his thoughts about Molly’s reason—true to a point, but he had a guess her worries about titles might have prompted it too—to himself. “So…what are you doing—oh.”
"But Mummy, we want to play with Uncle John!"
Sebastian bowed his head. “He buried it—her—in the basement of the Zoo of Death.”
“Then I’m coming with you. I have money too, and I want to help this man.”
Molly recognized an Invasion when she saw one.
“I’ve been there once before, when I was a child,” Sally answered.
Watson reached over and took Holmes’ hand under the blankets. “I’m glad you’re staying,” he murmured. “Goodnight, my dear Sherlock.”
“John, Moriarty's going to be let off.”
“If you come back now, I swear you will die without pain,” Ireni said. “I doubt the Eels will offer you the same choice.”
Holmes slammed his hand on the table, eyes turning fierce. “Don’t you ever say that again!”
What happened next was an absolute roar of human voices, yelling and screaming, and it was coming from the Castle.
“Very brave,” Prince Jamiarty said. “Don’t ruin it with stupidity.”
“Sherlock?” Molly's eyes were worried. “What do you want to do?”
John sat up. They were approaching the London docks, and the whole city was ablaze in the sunrise. It was larger than Marseille, larger than the capital, and John felt very small. He was used to the open sea, a ship where all were loyal to him…
getting sentimental.
I will likely write a modern set of these in the future, but I just didn't have the time this week, sorry. Next week we'll have another Victorian chapter, and the following week we'll be back to modernity with another arc...I've got someone to introduce you all to...

“Lies.” The hoarse voice belonged to the wounded Carrier. There were shallow cuts covering every inch of bare skin, her dress in rags. “Sally is nothing. Why would she need anything? Who represents a common whore?”
There were no cries of outrage at the meeting. There were no recriminations, no vows of vengeance, no dashing about. Everyone sat still and quiet.
“Why didn’t she just fly wherever she was going?” Molly asked.
“Hey,” Grezzik said gently. “Go easy on him. He’s had a rough day.”
"Either way it's a fine name," Kitty agreed.
“Oh, nothing.” Sherlock leaned back, not letting go of John’s hand. “I just realized why I recognized this argument.”
“So do I! There’s so much out there, it’s a crime we don’t know about it! I swear I’m going to leave this place someday.” Sherlock leaned forward excitedly. Too close, and Watson’s eyes went huge. “Sorry.”
In the book it says that Kitty got a sentence—the lightest one possible—but it also says that Watson wasn’t living at Baker Street so….I do what I want.
"What's your name?" he asked.
"I don't think so," Watson said slowly. "I think we may be dead."
"Watson," Grandad Sherlock said quickly, "you remember what Kitty said?"
“She can breathe, right?”
“Do you?” Holmes asked.
Grezzik sighed. “She still thinks she’s in trouble. I try to convince her that she’s not.”
